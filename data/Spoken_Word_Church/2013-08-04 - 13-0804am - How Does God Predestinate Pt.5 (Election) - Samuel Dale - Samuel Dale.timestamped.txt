[1:50] if you'd like turning your scriptures
[1:52] turn to Romans 8 where we've been
[1:54] reading and then we will go to Second
[1:57] Peter 1 Romans 8 2 Peter 1. we had a
[2:03] real good time last night at least I did
[2:05] at the Bible study everybody got to
[2:08] listen to me for an hour almost two
[2:10] hours so you know if I got any voice
[2:13] left we'll try to preach today but you
[2:16] know I didn't ask you if you would if
[2:18] you want to listen to it brother Joe
[2:20] would be glad to make you a copy so we
[2:22] got into a lot of things talking about
[2:25] the order of the rapture
[2:28] and coming down to it you know in dying
[2:31] and I hope you enjoyed it but remember
[2:33] that remember brother George Quinn will
[2:35] be with us uh this coming Sunday the
[2:38] 11th
[2:40] and brother Danny Monday will be with us
[2:43] on the third Sunday which is the 18th
[2:46] now if anybody wants to go along we are
[2:49] planning on trying to go up to the
[2:53] Friday night meeting at Ruth
[2:56] so if you want to go with us we will try
[2:59] to take the van and whatever Vehicles is
[3:01] possible to go up to be with them and
[3:04] but we got to leave wage that no later
[3:08] than two o'clock
[3:10] so if you're planning on going with us
[3:12] you'll have to let us know where we can
[3:14] make arrangements you know and try to
[3:16] leave from there by two o'clock because
[3:18] we got to get up in time for the service
[3:21] and it's about two hours and something
[3:24] right on the three hour drive so just
[3:27] remember that if you want to go with us
[3:28] let us know
[3:29] but don't show up 10 minutes after
[3:32] because you'll be left at home unless
[3:35] you drive okay because we we have to
[3:37] have schedules and things and uh you
[3:40] know to do that but just remember that
[3:43] okay Romans 8
[3:45] 28
[3:46] and then second Peter 1. the heavenly
[3:50] father we thank you for this day we
[3:52] thank you for the hour that we're living
[3:53] the the time upon the Earth that we have
[3:56] to
[3:57] set aside a little time today to
[4:01] sit down and fellowship together about
[4:03] you
[4:05] we just asked you that you'd come on the
[4:06] scene now and speak to our hearts and
[4:08] our lives
[4:10] because that's what we desire more than
[4:11] anything it's a revelation
[4:13] because that will be what will change us
[4:17] the prophet said the bride would be
[4:18] waiting for the revelation of the
[4:20] Rapture so Lord we can look assuredly to
[4:23] a place in a time that you're going to
[4:26] reveal to us the reality of what is
[4:29] going on and then that will change our
[4:32] whole vile bodies and take us on off of
[4:35] the Earth but we love you and we thank
[4:37] you bless those that are not here
[4:39] remember Wade and June there's going up
[4:41] and in her
[4:43] ER
[4:44] Daddy's girlfriend's mother passing away
[4:48] we pray that you would just be with a
[4:50] family and take care of all of them
[4:52] people waiting them traveling Just Have
[4:53] Your Way remember these others some are
[4:55] missing but we commit them to you
[4:57] believing you'll take care of everything
[4:58] guide us now we love you and we thank
[5:01] you as we read your words you come and
[5:03] speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen
[5:07] laughs
[5:10] Romans 8.
[5:13] let's start 23 where we've been at it
[5:16] I mean 28 excuse me
[5:19] and we know that all things work
[5:20] together for good to them that love God
[5:24] to them who are the called according to
[5:27] his purpose for whom he did for no he
[5:30] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[5:33] the image of his son that he might be
[5:35] the firstborn among many brethren
[5:38] moreover whom he did
[5:40] predestinate them he also called and
[5:43] whom he called then he also Justified
[5:45] and whom he justified them he also
[5:48] glorified
[5:49] what shall we say to these things amen
[5:52] it'd be the best thing to say if God be
[5:55] for us who can be against us amen all
[5:59] right we'll go over to
[6:00] second Peter 1 and verse 10.
[6:04] says wherefore
[6:07] the rather
[6:08] or therefore what for whatever see
[6:12] we're for the rather Brethren give
[6:14] diligence to make your calling an
[6:17] election sure
[6:19] for if we do these things we shall never
[6:22] fall you may be seated the Lord had his
[6:24] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[6:27] I made about 50 copies of some of the
[6:31] quotes if one of you will that we've
[6:34] used lately and all on predestination
[6:39] and if it's not enough we will be glad
[6:41] to make some more
[6:44] but we've been talking on predestination
[6:47] now for quite a while this is message
[6:50] number five
[6:51] and we're just trying to get into a
[6:55] point
[6:55] because I ask you a question
[6:59] how does God predestinate
[7:04] how does he predestinate
[7:07] all right
[7:10] and we went through the point of seeing
[7:12] that
[7:13] uh the point is how does he predestinate
[7:17] we can understand the word predestinate
[7:19] because we talk about an eternal God
[7:22] I mean you know an infinite God and all
[7:24] kind of thing but how can he
[7:27] predetermine something to be
[7:32] and not then be a respecter of persons
[7:38] you know are
[7:40] be in the bases well I chose this one
[7:44] and didn't choose that one
[7:46] so we've been through Jacob and Esau
[7:48] trying to uh study the point and go
[7:51] through it and you know and trying to
[7:54] see thank you brother some things that
[7:58] oh
[8:00] the way he does it
[8:04] it's a very simple matter
[8:07] that he predestinates by foreknowledge
[8:11] he said well that's just too simple well
[8:14] you know come to find out sister
[8:17] uh Kathy while ago was showing me
[8:19] something that as many times as we spoke
[8:22] about the one God and the things but and
[8:25] not if she didn't see things before but
[8:27] brother 40 there Wednesday night when
[8:28] he's preaching he said something about
[8:30] God is a spirit it just opened up
[8:32] something and she had a revelation about
[8:35] one God
[8:36] well
[8:38] you know you say well well I got that
[8:40] right off well amen anytime you got it
[8:43] as long as it's revealed is the main
[8:46] thing but when it's just head knowledge
[8:48] see we can quote all of that
[8:51] and still not have the revelation of
[8:53] what it is a revelation will change
[8:55] things
[8:57] you don't have to worry about anything
[8:58] that's revealed to you I have no
[9:00] problems with anybody discussing it I
[9:02] don't care if it would be a theologian
[9:04] out of a denominational church or or
[9:07] whatever it would be I would not be a
[9:09] have no problems with discussing uh the
[9:14] Bible with them
[9:15] not that I would know as much as I would
[9:17] know I wouldn't even think about it but
[9:19] it the part that I do know
[9:22] we could talk about I'll talk to you
[9:25] about what's been revealed now the
[9:27] others we'll talk about this is your
[9:29] opinion and that's my opinion and and
[9:31] they're you know they're just like noses
[9:34] we all have one
[9:36] you know
[9:38] it's what gets us in trouble is our
[9:40] noses but but
[9:43] think about it
[9:46] how would God predestinate
[9:50] and not be
[9:52] picking one and rejecting another
[9:56] you know
[9:59] and then how would it be that he would
[10:02] all be saved
[10:05] no
[10:07] you know God would that all be saved
[10:11] but yet he knew that all would not be
[10:13] saved true
[10:15] I mean we understand that don't we
[10:17] that we understand that all won't be
[10:20] saved because people just will not
[10:24] accept it
[10:26] you know
[10:27] they just won't uh won't have anything
[10:31] to do with it or a thought because they
[10:33] have their preconceived ideas
[10:36] and once we do those things you know we
[10:38] we wind up uh having a problem uh Aaron
[10:43] would you come up and click the thing
[10:44] we've having so much trouble with our
[10:46] air conditioner system I clicked it up
[10:49] this morning on 72 and it's 72 but 71
[10:53] you freeze to death now there's no 70
[10:56] and a half or 71 and a half
[10:59] we've been running for the longest we're
[11:01] not even running a center fan it was
[11:03] only 71. I clicked it up to 72. and you
[11:08] start Fanning and everybody's burning to
[11:10] death right so what are we going to do I
[11:13] still say that I'm going down to Florida
[11:15] and I'm going to buy all of those little
[11:17] suits that they've got for those people
[11:19] that are at Disney World you know for
[11:22] Mickey Mouse and all because I asked one
[11:24] of them one time I said how in the world
[11:25] can you stand this hot temperature you
[11:28] know you're inside of that thing he said
[11:30] there's a little air conditioner in here
[11:33] so I'm going to go down one of these
[11:35] days and purchase so you get to pick out
[11:38] whether you're a Minnie Mouse or Mickey
[11:40] Mouse or Donald Duck and I'm going to
[11:43] give everybody one but it's got to have
[11:44] a heater and an air conditioner
[11:47] any word that you can
[11:48] all right we do the best we can forgive
[11:51] us
[11:54] but now
[11:56] how does God then predestinate
[12:01] and not just being choosing one
[12:07] and rejecting the other
[12:11] how does he do that
[12:13] so we've been dealing with it now for
[12:16] about four messages of what he does it
[12:18] by foreknowledge all right man all right
[12:23] Now by foreknowledge
[12:25] we say you have but we we just all
[12:28] talked about before now I can't help it
[12:30] that if the Armenian doctrine of
[12:33] foreknowledge runs into works and ideas
[12:36] and things like that and and dealing
[12:39] with life
[12:41] and the calvinistic runs into the well
[12:44] that we're just saved anyway it don't
[12:46] matter what we do
[12:47] see that would be going into the
[12:49] predetermined stamping It Like It Is God
[12:52] chose me for the world so hey Gloria I'm
[12:54] here I can live like the devil
[12:57] he said I don't say that no but
[13:00] that's where the doctrine come from
[13:03] at least you can just live like the
[13:05] devil
[13:06] Calvin had a man killed
[13:09] but he didn't believe in one God right
[13:14] so now you want to go with Calvinism or
[13:16] you want to go with armenianism or are
[13:17] we going to try to find a truth in God's
[13:20] word
[13:21] all right so I gave you a bunch of
[13:23] quotes
[13:25] to where you can read them but we've
[13:27] been over them
[13:28] brother Branham says predestination
[13:31] looks back to foreknowledge
[13:35] all right
[13:36] amen
[13:38] and foreknowledge looks to Destiny
[13:41] all right
[13:44] now then for knowledge
[13:46] is prior to predestination
[13:51] because if not he would be saying
[13:53] predestination
[13:54] you know
[13:56] would be first and then for knowledge
[13:59] you you can't make that in God and make
[14:01] him nor he wouldn't be a respecter
[14:03] person
[14:05] you got to make it to where the person
[14:07] can make a choice
[14:11] um
[14:12] is that not what the scripture says
[14:14] choose you this day whom you will serve
[14:18] now if we're going to believe that God
[14:20] just say so many and there's just so
[14:23] many sitting in the building today well
[14:24] the rest of you get up and go home
[14:27] you know it might as well that's right
[14:30] if that's the way you're going to think
[14:32] about it
[14:33] well see that's why I love foreknowledge
[14:37] because in foreknowledge God
[14:40] foreknew what I would do
[14:47] he foreknew my desires
[14:52] and he operates according to my desires
[14:59] gives me a connecting link
[15:02] into my salvation or what you want to
[15:04] call it or a thought
[15:06] that you know I do have something to do
[15:09] with this it's not just a flop back with
[15:11] and he shows me here if he showed me
[15:13] didn't you
[15:14] you know
[15:17] it means the life we live
[15:20] proves
[15:22] whether we're saved or not
[15:26] the life we live proves our
[15:28] predestination
[15:31] see then that gives me a great
[15:33] opportunity to think about it right
[15:37] greater than the fact that he just
[15:40] I just took it don't make no difference
[15:44] you see
[15:46] that's what people have taught on
[15:49] predestination well Paul didn't have a
[15:51] choice God just knocked him off the
[15:53] horse and made him take it
[15:57] no
[15:59] I'm glad the prophet would come along
[16:01] and we can depend upon his words
[16:04] from the day Paul stood there Darren
[16:07] Stone saw Stephen stoned
[16:11] from that day on Paul was not right
[16:16] he saw something real
[16:20] as mean as David is what it was we'll
[16:23] read in a minute where the Prophet said
[16:25] David I know your desires
[16:32] well that's something in it
[16:33] he knows what you want
[16:38] in any acts according to what you want
[16:41] but now if you ever stop wanting
[16:44] right you understand the point if you
[16:46] ever stop Desiring God in his ways and
[16:50] wanting him then
[16:52] you're sealing away your own Doom
[16:55] but if there's a desire in your heart
[16:57] for God
[16:58] there's got to be a God to answer that
[17:00] desire
[17:04] all right so then we can go back then
[17:07] and say to us it everything hinges on
[17:09] foreknowledge
[17:11] I've got a little drawing that I'm
[17:13] making for Joseph and he said he thought
[17:15] I'd done one like a few years ago in
[17:18] predestination but anyhow we'll put a
[17:20] little drawing up
[17:22] because see what I'm dealing with and
[17:24] what I've been dealing with in
[17:25] foreknowledge draw a line in your mind
[17:29] there's a line
[17:30] we're not back on this side of that line
[17:32] yet
[17:34] we're still out here
[17:39] we're not in time you know in looking at
[17:42] it
[17:42] we're looking at it as what God foreknew
[17:47] and you know that he foreknew that Jesus
[17:49] Christ would
[17:52] be slain right
[17:56] he foreknew that
[17:58] he foreign you you got to make him
[18:00] infinite or is your peanut brain and and
[18:02] what's he need and serve in that kind of
[18:03] a god
[18:05] you know
[18:09] I wrote a list of like the mind
[18:13] that we covered this Wednesday
[18:16] see when that line here this is God the
[18:18] infinite the Great
[18:20] Elohim self-existing
[18:23] the line that shows like where you would
[18:26] start with the mind
[18:28] and then going forward towards time
[18:31] and when we wind up in time if the Bible
[18:34] is right that Jesus was to be slain in
[18:38] the mind of God before the world is
[18:40] there any way that it could ever be that
[18:41] he wouldn't be slain
[18:43] now come on you got a carnality of the
[18:46] mind but that's not that's stupidity to
[18:50] think that God said it and then can't do
[18:53] it
[18:54] you know that's beyond carnality
[18:58] and see we look at it then as God's
[19:00] foreknowledge
[19:04] that he foreknew all things
[19:09] see then he knew whether you'd be here
[19:10] today or not
[19:13] but see you had a choice
[19:16] right amen
[19:19] and we'll get to it in a minute the
[19:21] scripture we read about making your
[19:24] calling an election sure that is after
[19:27] this message of
[19:29] II Peter of the Statue of a perfect man
[19:33] so then we we're going to tie together
[19:35] something the Lord willing if we can get
[19:37] into it but listen what your Prophet had
[19:39] to say we give these things over and
[19:41] over
[19:45] go ahead we're number one brother John
[19:47] all right brother Bob never wish
[19:50] they get back there and they kind of
[19:52] understaffed today because brother Benny
[19:54] he he decided to fly to California
[19:58] her back one of the two and
[20:00] I just hope it don't go under while he's
[20:02] out there you know maybe he'll be up off
[20:05] the ground and you know
[20:07] but anyhow just joking but listen what
[20:11] the prophet said in 1963 11 29 super
[20:13] sign but remember God's clock will be
[20:16] just exactly on time all these things
[20:18] has to be why it has to all be done
[20:22] according to his great knowledge his
[20:25] foreknowledge by foreknowledge he could
[20:27] predestinate
[20:29] not by his desire
[20:32] the Bible says he desired it all be
[20:34] saved right
[20:35] right all right
[20:37] desires he's not willing that any should
[20:39] perish but by his foreknowledge he knew
[20:41] he would accept it and who would not
[20:43] therefore he can make everything work
[20:45] according to his big time clock that's
[20:48] ticking because he knew back in the
[20:49] beginning and all of the things all
[20:51] right
[20:53] now God does a predestinate my desire
[20:56] because that would be choosing see I
[21:00] take this one reject that one take this
[21:02] one reject that one
[21:03] his desires would motivate him
[21:07] to just
[21:09] take a few
[21:12] but he doesn't do it that way
[21:15] he lays The Plan of Salvation before the
[21:18] world
[21:19] and I thank God for a prophet see
[21:22] because of a lot of answers he's given
[21:25] us
[21:26] that even the Heathen who know nothing
[21:30] about God
[21:33] when I read that I rejoiced to find out
[21:37] that God would not send that heathen
[21:41] whether it be you know
[21:43] in America or
[21:45] not send that heater into hell
[21:48] because he'd never heard the truth
[21:51] he'll be judged according the prophet
[21:53] said according to his own laws
[21:58] you just think about it sister Gail
[22:00] he's so great until
[22:03] those people back there that know
[22:05] nothing of him
[22:07] and yet he heals them
[22:09] he delivers them guides them takes care
[22:13] of them
[22:15] seemingly more than he does to us
[22:17] right
[22:22] because he's God
[22:25] and then being judged according to their
[22:28] deeds and talks and the way they live
[22:33] we'll be judged according to Salvation
[22:35] on the basis of
[22:36] eternal life because we have a group of
[22:38] people that we wouldn't teach us back in
[22:40] the organized religion we didn't know
[22:43] much about it called a foolish virgin
[22:45] Matthew 25. you got five wives five
[22:48] foolish the Five Wives had the Holy
[22:51] Ghost the five foolish didn't have it
[22:54] and they're going to be judged according
[22:56] to their own lives
[22:58] that's a wonderful God Amen
[23:02] I thank him every day
[23:06] for showing me is true
[23:08] that's right but the questions I once
[23:10] had are beginning to be answered
[23:15] you know
[23:16] and thoughts that I wondered and
[23:18] pondered about
[23:21] was why I titled this
[23:23] how does God predestinate
[23:26] the Bible says he does
[23:30] but then he tells us that he
[23:32] predestinates
[23:34] because those that He foreknew
[23:37] we read
[23:39] he predestinates
[23:44] well see then he forward knew
[23:45] everybody'd ever be in the world
[23:47] that's what I was trying to get across
[23:49] Wednesday
[23:50] about the mind of God
[23:54] he knows every person ever be in the
[23:56] world
[23:59] see we think that so many people was
[24:01] made to be saved so many people was made
[24:03] to be lost
[24:05] now could God be just and do that
[24:11] come on you can't do it
[24:14] so he doesn't have predestinate
[24:15] according to his desires even
[24:22] because see you take it as thinking of
[24:24] his desires
[24:26] I take it on the opposite direction
[24:29] in an answer to my heart
[24:32] he doesn't predestinate by his desires
[24:36] he said well his desires would that he
[24:39] choose certain people
[24:40] no I look at it that he predestinates
[24:43] not according to his desires because he
[24:46] desire that everybody be saved so then
[24:49] he would have to save everybody
[24:53] but he doesn't do it that way
[24:56] he could not display his attributes
[24:58] of healer savior Etc
[25:01] under those conditions right all right
[25:05] so he doesn't predestinate according to
[25:07] his desires
[25:09] he really predestinates according to
[25:11] what we desire amen
[25:16] he won't override we'll get to it this
[25:18] evening he will not override your free
[25:20] moral agency
[25:23] now on the message they're so revelated
[25:27] do you know what preachers a lot of them
[25:29] in the message three more agency is
[25:31] foolish virgins don't have nothing to do
[25:33] with me I'm predestinated eternally
[25:36] laughs
[25:40] you know that God will read in a minute
[25:42] or this evening we'll read that God even
[25:45] gave the devil
[25:46] of free moral agency
[25:50] he didn't make him the devil he made him
[25:53] the anointed church right right
[25:57] that's what your Bible says
[26:00] but see that's what I don't understand
[26:02] why we can't just go down simple about
[26:05] it
[26:06] and look at it God does a predestinate
[26:08] My Desire he's not willing that any
[26:10] should perish but by foreknowledge he
[26:13] knew who would accept him who would not
[26:16] this is what I like
[26:18] therefore he can make everything work
[26:20] according to his big time clock
[26:24] that's ticking away
[26:27] for he could foretell the end from the
[26:30] beginning
[26:32] what kind of a god do we serve amen
[26:37] well maybe God knows a little bit maybe
[26:39] well that means you know more than he
[26:42] does
[26:43] if you ain't got enough sense to figure
[26:45] that out I'll tell you
[26:48] when we think we can straighten God out
[26:50] that means we're God
[26:52] we're greater than he is if we can
[26:54] correct his errors
[26:57] that's what gets me about the people
[26:58] this message probably jumping on to the
[27:00] prophet they didn't do it while he was
[27:01] alive
[27:03] is afraid of that but now they're just
[27:05] running just
[27:07] if you straighten him out come on I need
[27:09] to kiss you big toe
[27:13] I'm playing on that
[27:15] you know what that means don't you that
[27:17] bow down to the pope and kiss this toe
[27:19] because he's God
[27:21] hmm
[27:24] do you straightened right around them
[27:25] out you need to get your toe kissed but
[27:27] just be careful around me you might get
[27:29] it hit with a hammer
[27:33] well because I don't believe you or I
[27:35] either one that won't straighten the
[27:37] word of God out
[27:39] if we can it's not God's word
[27:43] sorry for being plain but why not
[27:48] at least you know where I stand
[27:51] well I don't know what brother Dale
[27:52] believes there ain't nobody to tell you
[27:54] that
[27:56] I never heard anybody say I don't know
[27:58] what brother Dale believes they'll say I
[28:01] don't understand what he believes with
[28:02] them
[28:03] they know I don't told them we look at
[28:05] the number two about it what what do we
[28:07] think about it
[28:10] right around them on a message
[28:11] dedication 62. 11 11 morning service
[28:16] look what he's talking about
[28:19] David is constantly thinking of God
[28:22] back in the Psalms he writing
[28:25] too many of us today think of our
[28:27] achievements
[28:28] and something we could do or better
[28:30] ourselves
[28:31] but David was constantly thinking of
[28:34] what he could do for God
[28:39] now I hope it's Dawning on you what I've
[28:42] always preached to you
[28:44] God said your
[28:46] sacrifice and offerings has become a
[28:49] stink in my nostrils why because it was
[28:52] just a haphazard get it go to the lamb
[28:55] face the lamb for me make sure you write
[28:57] my name down
[29:00] I want a record that I you know give me
[29:02] a receipt where I can take it home when
[29:03] I made this offering
[29:07] but look what
[29:13] God would say I know your desires David
[29:18] and I want you to know what I've done
[29:20] for you
[29:22] he goes through to describing where he
[29:24] took him from
[29:25] said but your desires are correct
[29:29] David desired after God the Bible said
[29:33] he was a man after God's Own Heart
[29:38] now the notes that I gave you today is
[29:39] not the ones I'm using this morning so
[29:41] you won't find those quotes Okay you
[29:43] have to read that off the board some of
[29:46] them will be in there but no
[29:49] see God knew David's desires the Bible
[29:53] said an honest and a contrite heart
[29:57] is what God desires
[30:00] he ordained the offerings in the
[30:02] sacrifices
[30:03] he wasn't saying do away with him
[30:05] he just said it's become just a natural
[30:07] there's something to go do
[30:09] and to become a stink in his nostrils
[30:15] but a man after this
[30:17] a heart like David
[30:19] that he could get in the Psalms and sing
[30:22] and
[30:23] talk about God
[30:27] he said yeah but he was a murderer and
[30:28] everything else you know
[30:30] that was the time and that was before
[30:32] the New Birth was given
[30:34] so we don't get over here and start just
[30:36] going killing a bunch of people so it's
[30:38] all right
[30:39] but David was defending Israel
[30:45] I'm going to ordain for those people to
[30:47] be killed
[30:48] right
[30:50] he commissioned him to do it
[30:54] but think about it
[30:56] what kind of desires do you have
[31:02] just remember
[31:04] God will give you
[31:06] the desires of your heart
[31:13] see a lot of people that I could always
[31:15] tell you when I hit that point
[31:19] that you can just see people's minds
[31:21] when you're saying you know God's going
[31:23] to give us going to take this body and
[31:25] make it eternal
[31:27] and we'll be 18 years old
[31:30] and they're just going
[31:34] how beautiful I'll be
[31:38] well that's not exactly
[31:40] the way it's going to be
[31:43] you know what
[31:46] that kind of person won't be there
[31:49] because their desires in the wrong place
[31:52] go down and get your workout center and
[31:54] straighten it up that away if you want
[31:56] it
[31:58] but don't blame it on God
[32:01] listen Church
[32:03] what are our desires what do we desire
[32:08] because God works according to what you
[32:10] desire
[32:16] my brother Dale I've had these desires a
[32:18] long time God ain't fulfilled them yet
[32:23] well so what
[32:27] does that mean
[32:30] s God hadn't heard you
[32:33] he might be giving you a little time to
[32:34] figure out your desire
[32:37] we'll get to it in a minute if we have
[32:40] time don't we'll get to it this evening
[32:43] you see but we we were having to deal
[32:46] with the fact of God
[32:49] and
[32:51] being him being infinite
[32:56] and whatever thought he had in the
[32:58] beginning
[33:02] he can't change that
[33:06] so the first person was to be saved by
[33:08] the blood you agree
[33:10] so that means everybody should be saved
[33:12] by the blood
[33:14] the first person that was healed had to
[33:17] believe God
[33:19] how does God heal Us by believing him
[33:22] he doesn't change his mind so all we got
[33:25] to do is find that channel
[33:28] all right so it was by the blood
[33:31] then we go through the Old Testament by
[33:33] the blood
[33:35] then comes the blood of almighty God
[33:37] into being in Jesus Christ and we're
[33:41] saved by the blood
[33:44] we really kept saved by it and we're
[33:47] saved by grace through faith right
[33:48] that's according to the scripture
[33:51] but really kept saved by the blood
[33:53] but see thinking about serving a god
[33:58] whose thoughts are eternal
[34:02] amen so you're dealing with it for
[34:05] knowledge
[34:07] as his thoughts
[34:10] right right
[34:11] then he pre-determines the destiny
[34:18] is that predetermining because of his
[34:20] desires and his talk no it's because in
[34:23] his thought he knew exactly what we'd do
[34:31] amen the Bible says a thing for him
[34:32] can't say why did you form me this way
[34:35] because he didn't form us this way
[34:38] we formed ourselves
[34:41] we made ourselves sinners
[34:46] right because of the choices we made
[34:50] all right
[34:52] so then the thoughts of God are eternal
[34:56] he can never have a new thought about
[34:58] anything
[35:00] because all his thoughts he has always
[35:03] had and always will have 149 Church age
[35:06] book
[35:08] thus the thoughts of God are Eternal
[35:10] they are real
[35:14] listen to a definition now
[35:17] they are not simply like a man with a
[35:19] blueprint he has grown up
[35:21] which one day will be translated into
[35:23] substance
[35:26] and form but they are already real and
[35:31] eternal
[35:31] and part of God
[35:36] all right
[35:38] if he thought of you being saved
[35:42] now here's what people look at you know
[35:44] well if he thought of me being saved I'm
[35:46] going to be saved but if he thought of
[35:48] me being lost I'm going to be lost
[35:51] now he thought of you thinking that
[35:58] right right right
[36:01] we ain't pulling nothing over on him
[36:05] he knew what we think
[36:07] if you know never that whatever bat his
[36:10] eye
[36:13] and then you mean to tell him he didn't
[36:14] know our thoughts
[36:18] well
[36:21] the Bible says think on these things
[36:24] we'll get down in a minute just the
[36:26] scripture
[36:32] look what he says and I'll give you this
[36:34] from before in Harvest Time number four
[36:36] any notes brother
[36:38] he's talking about how that
[36:41] Harvest Time 1964 12.
[36:44] paragraph 122 through 124.
[36:50] God is Not
[36:53] omnipresent except that he's omniscient
[36:56] right
[36:58] see we make him a spirit
[37:01] that is just ever were
[37:06] oh God is a being
[37:11] he says he sets in the heavens with his
[37:14] feet on Earth
[37:16] it was my Throne a nurse my footstool
[37:19] see we go back in there well it was a
[37:21] time that God was just a spirit
[37:26] that's her human terminologies
[37:29] but what else could we say
[37:37] God is not just like the wind that blows
[37:41] it's over here and it's over there
[37:43] that's what they say of the amoya that
[37:46] in Africa you know their Doctrine is a
[37:48] Moya I believe it's a word which means
[37:51] that you breathe in
[37:52] I breathe in brother Donnie breathes out
[37:54] I get his soul I breathe out he breathe
[37:57] in he gets mine
[38:00] oh my god sister spirit
[38:06] he said well the Bible says he's a
[38:08] spirit I pray with it I believe it
[38:14] but he's omnipresent in that he's
[38:16] omniscient he knows all things
[38:21] he knows to be there he doesn't have to
[38:23] be on the moon today there's nobody on
[38:24] the moon right as far as we know if
[38:28] there's anybody else died then he's up
[38:29] there as a witness
[38:31] right go back and study those
[38:35] first space travels
[38:38] and see if those astronauts didn't say
[38:43] and a lot followed him there and
[38:45] followed them back
[38:51] see maybe you don't read I like to read
[38:54] I don't believe everything I read
[38:57] all right
[38:58] but I do believe it when it fits right
[39:01] okay
[39:04] but see
[39:06] he desired that every person be saved
[39:12] therefore by his foreknowledge he can
[39:14] predestinate
[39:16] and make everything work to his glory
[39:23] to be a savior
[39:27] it would mean that he would have to have
[39:29] some way for someone to be lost
[39:32] you agree
[39:34] so God in the beginning before the world
[39:37] or anything when he was self-existing is
[39:40] he's the only word we can use is called
[39:42] Elohim which means self-existing
[39:49] and in that he had the attribute of
[39:51] being a father
[39:54] but there was nothing for him to be a
[39:56] father over
[39:58] all right now listen he had the
[40:01] attribute of being a god
[40:04] I use that because of the first stage
[40:07] coming this way was what
[40:10] to be God he made angels
[40:13] and they worshiped him
[40:16] that made him our word god
[40:19] because God means an object of worship
[40:22] but the angels
[40:24] had nothing to do with salvation other
[40:26] than
[40:27] working backwards and forth and helping
[40:30] you and I Minister unto that to The
[40:32] Heirs of salvation
[40:36] I believe that way that I believe we've
[40:38] got an angel that helps us and guide us
[40:40] and takes care of us
[40:41] and I sure work mine to death a lot of
[40:43] times
[40:44] you know hanging upside down off a deer
[40:47] stand building on things and
[40:50] Donnie's down on the ground said get
[40:52] down I'll do it
[40:53] you know
[40:55] but
[40:56] listen
[40:59] he had an attribute or a part of him
[41:02] that he desired to be a father
[41:05] we had no children
[41:09] but at the same time see if he only had
[41:12] that one attribute as being a father
[41:16] he could have created
[41:19] a family
[41:22] and that would have made him an
[41:24] attribute of father in the fact of
[41:26] creation
[41:28] with the same time he desired to be a
[41:30] healer one of course the scripture says
[41:33] by Stripes I'm Healed so he desired to
[41:36] be a Healer now to be a Healer meant
[41:39] somebody had to be sick
[41:42] to be a father he didn't have to make us
[41:45] lost
[41:46] he could have made us
[41:49] and we would have made him I called him
[41:51] father but that wouldn't have been the
[41:53] kind of father he wanted
[41:56] you know what
[41:58] the kind of father he wanted
[42:00] to be
[42:03] was one who would come and die for you
[42:05] and I
[42:08] you think all of that wasn't in his mind
[42:10] as he was before the world and all of
[42:12] the things
[42:15] see then it would be necessary
[42:18] that to be a fall
[42:22] but God can't make the fall and be just
[42:24] I'm quoting from the prophet right
[42:28] he can't be judged and make us fall how
[42:31] would he condemn us for being Fallen
[42:32] that wouldn't make him a savior or
[42:35] healer or anything
[42:38] foreign
[42:41] but he knew if he made us we'd fall
[42:46] take the Holy Spirit Away right now and
[42:48] you'll fall
[42:49] come on you don't believe that but
[42:52] that's all right I don't care
[42:56] so holy righteous I wouldn't fall take
[42:58] the spirit away and you will go right
[43:00] back to your own lust
[43:02] you tell me you won't I don't care how
[43:04] old you are
[43:07] amen you never stop thinking
[43:10] that's right
[43:13] there's no way to stop that thinking
[43:15] that's right and you're going to go
[43:16] right back but I thank God we're not
[43:19] going to fall again
[43:23] we're going to be changed why because he
[43:26] said it
[43:27] yeah and I believe it
[43:29] but now here's a scripture that kind of
[43:31] strikes us
[43:34] look what it says there what we read to
[43:36] start with go ahead and pull up a second
[43:37] Peter
[43:40] I want you to think about this scripture
[43:43] number five
[43:48] or for or therefore what for or whatever
[43:50] you know get this straight line it up
[43:54] the rather Brethren give diligence
[43:58] to make your
[44:01] calling an election sure right
[44:07] well how'd I do it he either told me he
[44:10] didn't choose me well then you're not
[44:12] worried about your calling an election
[44:15] you ain't reading the scripture
[44:18] Peter says
[44:20] make sure
[44:23] in other words no
[44:29] calling
[44:31] well I know about the calling Bible says
[44:35] no man come to me unless your father
[44:37] draw him
[44:40] well has he drawed you
[44:42] just make sure
[44:44] make sure it wasn't mama that's why I'm
[44:48] against altar calls and the basis of
[44:50] begging people to come to the altar or
[44:52] come back to you
[44:54] and tell you you better get in the altar
[44:56] because you know you need to be saved
[44:58] you need
[45:00] I'm not going to do that that's
[45:01] overriding you're a free moral agency
[45:04] right that's overriding your choosing
[45:07] and I'll make you a twofold child of
[45:09] hell right it's going to be harder to
[45:11] get you back in church
[45:14] when I was little the Lord
[45:16] you can't kill me
[45:18] I'd letter the Lord to tell them
[45:20] brother now you just don't tell people
[45:26] you think I don't know what your
[45:28] thoughts are a lot of time
[45:30] that ain't even the Revelation that
[45:32] don't need discernment to do that I just
[45:34] know what we think about you know I know
[45:36] I called it them things a roll
[45:39] you know what I thought my drove
[45:43] who am I thinking
[45:45] right
[45:47] but make
[45:49] is a word meaning you have something to
[45:51] do with it
[45:53] right right
[45:55] if not you would take out that word make
[46:00] and you would just say
[46:02] you're calling an election assure
[46:04] Lord
[46:07] just don't worry about it
[46:09] eat drink and be merry you're either
[46:12] going to heaven or you're not
[46:16] look Peter says make
[46:19] you have something to do with this
[46:22] that's right make sure God has called
[46:24] you and not Mom and Daddy called you
[46:29] we talk about preachers that way right
[46:31] we talk about preachers that Mama called
[46:33] daddy sent
[46:35] the rest of them got up and went
[46:42] but make your calling
[46:47] make your calling sure
[46:51] and I heard this voice calling me
[46:56] okay
[46:59] okay
[47:02] but was it the voice of God
[47:04] that's it that's right
[47:08] the voice of God don't call us to error
[47:14] well I did a voices spoke to me and said
[47:19] that that Trinity is correct
[47:21] I can just see a father here and a holy
[47:25] ghost over here
[47:26] and a son over here
[47:28] and a voice told me that was right
[47:32] yeah I don't doubt it don't say that
[47:36] right when that
[47:37] show me that in the word
[47:41] because in the word there's one true and
[47:44] living God
[47:48] see we think we know all about it
[47:51] like I always say we say oh I heard the
[47:54] voice of God it was so sweet
[47:57] it told me that it didn't matter what
[48:00] I'd done
[48:01] I could wear any clothes I wanted to and
[48:04] act any way I wanted to because I'm
[48:07] saved anyway
[48:10] thank you
[48:12] people hear voices
[48:19] but the voice of God is sweet now it is
[48:23] the voice of God is sweet
[48:26] have you ever heard him say sit down
[48:29] shut up
[48:31] you're going wrong
[48:34] you keep going that away and you're lost
[48:37] you ain't never heard him say that
[48:39] he maybe he talks sweet to you
[48:43] but according to my Bible God loves to
[48:47] chasten us to try us to see whether or
[48:50] not we are his children
[48:55] he doesn't want to just well you're so
[48:58] sweet I just love you so much go ahead
[49:00] and just live like you want to it don't
[49:02] make no difference
[49:03] now that's not the voice of God I don't
[49:05] care what you say
[49:07] and I don't care if you tell me the
[49:09] Dead's raised to prove that's right I'll
[49:11] still argue with you because that's not
[49:13] the word of God
[49:15] when my Bible says if a prophet take you
[49:18] to another God
[49:20] don't believe him no matter what time he
[49:22] has
[49:30] make your calling an election sure
[49:36] no
[49:38] make your calling sure
[49:40] was it the voice of God that called you
[49:45] now
[49:49] then make your election sure
[49:53] right now the only way I know to make
[49:54] anything sure is to know how it works
[49:57] maybe that's carnal but that's the best
[49:59] way I've done it uh
[50:03] you know
[50:06] brother-in-law Peggy's brother
[50:09] he runs a machine shop you know and he's
[50:11] a and what you call it
[50:13] a drawer you know
[50:16] you know and all of them things you know
[50:18] Richard used to work for him
[50:21] well that boy wouldn't it be something
[50:22] me going there and it's in that jury I
[50:24] want to tell you
[50:25] you draw down that little thing that you
[50:27] had to her and you put out but that
[50:30] won't work
[50:33] in each side but but according to
[50:38] what we've learned is supposed to work
[50:41] I said no no that's not the way you do
[50:44] it
[50:45] well I'd sure prove to be a dummy
[50:47] wouldn't I
[50:48] wouldn't it be nice to talk to Einstein
[50:51] until Einstein I know all about
[50:53] electricity
[50:55] we got one sitting right back there it's
[50:57] been to school all of his life to learn
[50:59] electricity
[51:00] and he can't still can't tell me where
[51:03] the electricity runs
[51:05] on that wire or in that wire right
[51:09] foreign
[51:10] you can't do it
[51:14] if it runs away we think you could plug
[51:16] it into anything that'd work but it's
[51:18] got to have a ground
[51:22] the ground is more important than the
[51:25] positive
[51:28] right
[51:30] why do you put a double ground anything
[51:34] you don't put double electricity to it
[51:38] right
[51:40] do you understand what I'm saying
[51:43] yes we think in our peanut brain waves
[51:46] we can tell God how to do things
[51:51] well what you would have done in the
[51:52] beginning you should have done it this
[51:53] way
[51:56] but make your calling an election sure
[52:00] think about that
[52:04] in other words understand your calling
[52:05] okay I'm called of God God called but
[52:09] now uh
[52:11] the next one is Matthew 24 4 22 14. it
[52:16] says many are called but few are chosen
[52:19] right
[52:21] so now do you know which way you're
[52:23] seeing many are called
[52:26] you can be called of God and it's still
[52:28] not be right
[52:32] and few are chosen
[52:35] well because God knows what what you
[52:37] believe and what you want
[52:40] so make your calling correct
[52:44] make sure you know about your calling
[52:49] okay
[52:50] and that's still in foreknowledge
[52:53] amen now
[52:56] and your election
[52:59] well now brother Dale recording what I
[53:01] believe about election election is just
[53:03] reaching over and getting this one and
[53:06] getting that one and getting this one
[53:08] and getting that one and leave all in
[53:10] between is not to be because I elected
[53:13] that
[53:15] um
[53:17] you're gonna have trouble at the polls
[53:19] when they start trying to figure out
[53:20] who's going to be president
[53:21] because the election is going to take a
[53:24] long time
[53:25] before you can do that picking
[53:28] you understand what I mean
[53:31] it's going to take a long time for
[53:33] everybody to blabber about what they're
[53:35] going to do when they know they can't do
[53:37] it when they get in office
[53:39] right that's election
[53:42] no brother Dale that's natural election
[53:45] well that's what I'm trying to show you
[53:47] you don't know what election is
[53:51] the Bible said
[53:53] elect
[53:56] according
[53:59] to the foreknowledge of God
[54:04] right
[54:07] now come on to my quote in the Bible
[54:08] elect according to foreknowledge
[54:12] so then election is based on
[54:14] foreknowledge
[54:18] right
[54:21] see now we're seeing everything
[54:22] everything in life
[54:25] from the day one or the starting or
[54:27] whatever it was to the end of all of
[54:29] this is based upon God's foreknowledge
[54:35] you said well brother Dale you know we
[54:38] got up we come to church today
[54:40] you made a choice
[54:43] right you could have chose to stay at
[54:45] home and probably right now you're
[54:47] saying I wish I had but that's all right
[54:52] but listen
[54:56] do you believe it this way
[55:00] see this is the way I believe in
[55:01] election for knowledge predestination
[55:04] the mind of God
[55:06] uh for ordained for new for no
[55:12] Ford Nation
[55:15] is because God foreknew
[55:18] and could predestinate according to his
[55:21] foreknowledge
[55:24] but do you believe
[55:25] that everybody in the world today
[55:28] could be saved
[55:32] if they desired it
[55:39] um
[55:41] seven billion of us right
[55:44] that's just talking about in our
[55:46] generation
[55:49] do you believe that
[55:54] way I I just go with this certain
[55:57] election is his choosing
[56:01] well the Bible says choose you right
[56:05] this day
[56:06] whom you will serve
[56:11] but brother Dale you don't understand
[56:13] I've got those notes laying on the table
[56:14] so don't worry about it I'll go ahead
[56:16] and office
[56:18] but the Bible said we were chosen in him
[56:20] before the foundation world
[56:26] remember the line
[56:33] chosen in him before the foundation of
[56:35] the world got to fall on this side of
[56:37] that line
[56:39] the same as foreknowledge predestination
[56:41] be determined cruising election
[56:47] it's got to be his foreknowledge if not
[56:51] you are saying that God chose me
[56:57] but but but I got the quotes
[57:04] come on quote yourself to death
[57:08] I didn't choose him God chose me
[57:13] why did he choose you
[57:16] if he didn't choose you because of the
[57:19] foreknowledge of what you
[57:21] watch your person
[57:26] no problem
[57:28] so we draw a line
[57:33] from that line
[57:34] for knowledge is predestination mind of
[57:38] God
[57:39] desires
[57:40] Lounge Book of Life written before the
[57:42] foundation of the world all the things
[57:44] has got to fall onto this
[57:47] for knowledge side
[57:53] but my brother so-and-so preaches it and
[57:56] he he makes me feel like that I was just
[57:59] back there
[58:01] so does Napoleon
[58:06] everybody maybe not understand that
[58:07] space on the internet you might not
[58:08] Napoleon thought he was pre-existent
[58:11] from some other world
[58:13] right
[58:16] people who say I just feel I just feel
[58:18] the knives up in heaven What Do You Feel
[58:20] It by
[58:22] all the difference to your box all over
[58:24] me go get me some ice
[58:27] I'll drop it down your back and we're
[58:28] going to see about your chill bumps
[58:31] you say you're silly you you make fun no
[58:33] I don't make fun I don't make fun of
[58:35] God's word I believe in killbox
[58:38] I believe in the movie no God
[58:40] yes I've smelled him I've seen him I've
[58:42] done everything so don't make fun of me
[58:44] and say that I'm making fun of God's
[58:46] word
[58:49] I'm just telling it like it is
[58:52] you shout your shoe healed off and still
[58:55] be lost
[58:58] but you can't be born again and be lost
[59:02] if you're born again you are going to
[59:04] have feelings all right
[59:10] I love them little babies that just
[59:12] wiggle and kick and moving oh it is
[59:17] I used to get some tickled I'd get next
[59:19] to my wife
[59:20] when she's carrying the babies
[59:22] I'd get close to her where I could feel
[59:24] that baby kicking
[59:27] she said yeah but you don't feel what's
[59:29] inside
[59:30] it might be true
[59:33] but you know one day I was able to feed
[59:35] what was outside
[59:38] I I don't like to see a baby to just lay
[59:40] back
[59:43] you fattened them too much take a little
[59:45] food away
[59:47] right fat and a horse and what good is
[59:50] it
[59:53] starving a little bit and he'll go to
[59:55] work
[59:56] that's the way God does
[59:57] God don't fatten you and I all over at
[1:00:00] one time
[1:00:03] he gives us a little bit at your time
[1:00:05] just enough to make it to the next meal
[1:00:08] and you know what Brother Gary sometimes
[1:00:10] how long is that about three to six
[1:00:12] months to the next meal
[1:00:14] I told him something the other day he
[1:00:16] said it'll take you years to preach it I
[1:00:19] saw creepy
[1:00:21] because it made me years before he
[1:00:23] speaks to me again
[1:00:27] how would you like to be a preacher
[1:00:32] and get up here and say
[1:00:35] you know I sure hope is what he wanted
[1:00:37] me to say
[1:00:39] but listen Church
[1:00:43] do you believe everybody in the world
[1:00:45] could be saved
[1:00:48] if you don't then your God is no
[1:00:50] infinite God
[1:00:52] your God is a your
[1:00:56] makeup of your own mind and your
[1:00:58] thinking
[1:00:59] because he wouldn't all be saved
[1:01:04] but in you some would not be saved but
[1:01:06] you know
[1:01:09] why is it that if that's not true why is
[1:01:12] it that you can go to a country you can
[1:01:15] go to we used to say Africa all the time
[1:01:17] because that just meant a continent you
[1:01:19] know you can go to Alaska and you go to
[1:01:21] anywhere go back into places where
[1:01:23] they've never heard the name of Jesus
[1:01:25] nobody's never spoken to them about God
[1:01:27] and you find them worshiping a totem
[1:01:29] pole
[1:01:31] you explain it
[1:01:35] you explain that those people are
[1:01:37] worshiping an animal
[1:01:39] and God comes down and heals them
[1:01:45] you've got to agree with that right if
[1:01:48] there's any here
[1:01:52] it's the faith of that individual
[1:01:56] in believing
[1:01:58] God
[1:02:01] you didn't listen while ago when I said
[1:02:03] that even the Heathen would be judged by
[1:02:06] his own living by his rules of his life
[1:02:11] and can go to heaven because he's a good
[1:02:13] person
[1:02:15] well yet he's a cannibal yeah he eats
[1:02:17] people so what
[1:02:22] see that's where we don't want those
[1:02:23] times
[1:02:25] look
[1:02:30] look at the next quote
[1:02:33] I've tried my best for years to get us
[1:02:35] to see this and I know that it goes
[1:02:37] contrary to the grain of organized
[1:02:39] religion on predestination and the
[1:02:41] people of this message on predestination
[1:02:43] and I don't I'm not just saying I'm in
[1:02:45] the middle and I got it
[1:02:47] I'm just saying is it a truth
[1:02:49] look at the number quote number seven
[1:02:51] taken from why Christ speaks 63 7 14 the
[1:02:55] morning service paragraph 29 30 31.
[1:03:02] many times when we take when we look at
[1:03:05] the scripture
[1:03:06] in our own way of looking
[1:03:08] it seems to be very hard
[1:03:11] but if we study it a little bit we find
[1:03:12] out that the all-wise God knows just
[1:03:14] what he's doing
[1:03:16] and he knows how to do these things and
[1:03:18] how to deal with man he knows what's in
[1:03:20] man he knows him
[1:03:23] we don't we only know from the
[1:03:25] intellectual side
[1:03:27] he knows from
[1:03:29] he knows what's really in the man
[1:03:32] Moses was born in this world
[1:03:36] and a gifted boy you agree with that
[1:03:39] he was to be the deliverer of the Israel
[1:03:41] right amen all right
[1:03:44] now he wasn't to deliver it when he's
[1:03:47] first born
[1:03:49] right but what was it he was born A
[1:03:53] Gifted boy
[1:03:54] he was born to be a prophet a deliverer
[1:03:57] he was born with the equipment born in
[1:04:00] him
[1:04:02] as ever man that comes into the world is
[1:04:06] born with this equipment
[1:04:10] as I firmly believe in the foreknowledge
[1:04:13] of God the predestination
[1:04:18] no no no yeah and we'll get on to it
[1:04:20] later
[1:04:26] he's not meaning
[1:04:29] that bodies born to be a prophet is he
[1:04:32] because you would have a world full of
[1:04:33] prophets
[1:04:36] what is he saying
[1:04:41] that that hot and tot back in Africa
[1:04:44] that knows nothing about God yet he
[1:04:47] cries before and worships an idol
[1:04:50] and believes that that God can speak to
[1:04:53] him and God comes down and heals him
[1:04:56] and delivers him and saves him and keeps
[1:04:58] him
[1:04:59] right
[1:05:05] yeah but I've never thought about God
[1:05:07] the way you think about him well maybe
[1:05:08] that's
[1:05:10] maybe that's why you need to change your
[1:05:12] thinking about your God
[1:05:16] I'm sorry I'm just honest
[1:05:21] I believe that that person that knows
[1:05:24] nothing about God can be healed
[1:05:30] and not even believing in Jesus Christ
[1:05:31] as the Healer you know what I mean
[1:05:33] believing in it and the basis of knowing
[1:05:35] anything about it
[1:05:37] he enters a law by faith to believe
[1:05:41] and God drops down and heals him
[1:05:45] now he actually going to explain it
[1:05:49] see then everybody
[1:05:51] is born because of it being a human
[1:05:54] being a creation we're born to worship
[1:05:57] God
[1:06:04] Born To Worship
[1:06:08] born to serve God
[1:06:12] the desire after God that's why I was
[1:06:15] reading about David said David I know
[1:06:17] your desires
[1:06:18] you're rotten stinking murderer
[1:06:22] you're an adulteress you're all kind of
[1:06:25] thing I know you desire
[1:06:30] you desire to serve me
[1:06:33] you want to build me a house
[1:06:35] but I'm not going to let you
[1:06:37] but you know what David David didn't get
[1:06:39] mad bless God Gorgeous I'll tell you
[1:06:41] what he he just told me that that he
[1:06:43] wasn't gonna let me build it so I'm just
[1:06:45] gonna forget it
[1:06:48] now he'd approve then just there's
[1:06:50] something wrong with him right so what
[1:06:52] did David start doing
[1:06:54] you know when Solomon got ready to build
[1:06:56] a temple he didn't have to send after
[1:06:58] nothing
[1:07:00] reads your Bible David set out
[1:07:02] immediately to bring it in
[1:07:05] the things to build the temple
[1:07:09] he just wasn't able to put him together
[1:07:14] Solomon didn't have to call for this and
[1:07:16] sure he did because they needed but you
[1:07:19] get the point most of the things were
[1:07:20] laying on the ground
[1:07:22] that David provided
[1:07:26] now what did I tell you it said uh
[1:07:28] brother Marlow you can't build me a
[1:07:30] house
[1:07:31] it's okay I ain't gonna try
[1:07:38] but would that be a brother or a
[1:07:40] Christian
[1:07:41] no you'd say well okay
[1:07:43] let me start getting together
[1:07:46] the things that you're going to need
[1:07:50] that's what God was looking at
[1:07:53] that man loved God he sung in them songs
[1:07:55] in the first person
[1:07:57] amen they pierced my hands and my feet
[1:08:01] sung like he was hanging on the cross
[1:08:06] because of his desires but everybody's
[1:08:09] born with this equipment
[1:08:13] right
[1:08:15] not that God is willing that any would
[1:08:17] perish
[1:08:19] but all might come to repentance but
[1:08:21] being God he had to know and he does
[1:08:23] know the end from the beginning see if
[1:08:26] he doesn't then he isn't infinite and if
[1:08:29] he is not infinite he isn't God so he
[1:08:33] was willing
[1:08:35] so he wasn't willing
[1:08:38] certainly that any should perish
[1:08:41] but he he know knowing who would perish
[1:08:45] and who would not perish that's the
[1:08:48] reason
[1:08:50] the very purpose that Jesus came to the
[1:08:53] Earth was to save those that God through
[1:08:55] his foreknowledge seemed that wanted to
[1:08:58] be saved
[1:08:59] see because the whole world would be
[1:09:02] condemned and I don't see how we could
[1:09:04] teach
[1:09:05] any other way
[1:09:07] than the foreknowledge
[1:09:11] argue with your prophet
[1:09:13] of God and the Bible plainly saying that
[1:09:17] he knows the end from the beginning
[1:09:20] and can tell it
[1:09:22] I don't see how you can do it any other
[1:09:23] way he says of course
[1:09:26] what do you mean
[1:09:28] I got these other quotes
[1:09:34] I quoted it one ago first Peter one and
[1:09:36] two elect according to the foreknowledge
[1:09:38] of God the Father through sanctification
[1:09:41] of the spirit unto obedience and
[1:09:42] sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:09:45] unto you in peace be multiplied
[1:09:48] elect according to foreknowledge
[1:09:55] let me read these facts because he won't
[1:09:57] be able to keep up with me no can't do
[1:10:00] it
[1:10:03] number nine he chooses which is trying
[1:10:06] to do God a service
[1:10:07] and just in case out there on internet
[1:10:09] that you want things after the seals
[1:10:11] broke basically all of these quotes the
[1:10:13] days after the sealed broke
[1:10:18] you say well what are you saying that
[1:10:19] because there are people it says brother
[1:10:21] Ryan was wrong before the seals broke
[1:10:23] and right after they broke
[1:10:25] I don't believe that
[1:10:27] those things he didn't see before the
[1:10:29] sealed broke yes
[1:10:31] but he saw a wonderful and living God
[1:10:33] and God come down and Vindicated it
[1:10:38] he chooses his own person
[1:10:41] that's four knowledge
[1:10:43] like he said in Romans 8 here Esau
[1:10:46] that the election of God might stand
[1:10:50] the election of God might stand
[1:10:54] Esau and Jacob was born both of holy
[1:10:56] parents twins that his election might
[1:10:59] stand sure and true he said I hate Esau
[1:11:02] and love Jacob before either boy was
[1:11:04] born he knows what's in man he knows it
[1:11:08] from noted from the beginning what it
[1:11:10] was therefore he can make everything
[1:11:12] work just exactly on
[1:11:14] plot of time we get all nervous and
[1:11:17] frustrated
[1:11:19] you never seen him flustrated
[1:11:21] you know everything's working just right
[1:11:23] see he knew exactly what Jacob would
[1:11:25] want
[1:11:26] and he knew exactly what he saw would
[1:11:28] want
[1:11:30] by his four knowledge
[1:11:36] see that's the problem with people with
[1:11:38] their predestination Doctrine they said
[1:11:40] well then if he noted
[1:11:43] ain't nothing we can do about it see
[1:11:45] that's where you're blind
[1:11:47] he noted it by his foreknowledge
[1:11:51] he looked down through and seen what
[1:11:53] Jacob would do and seeing what Esau
[1:11:55] would do
[1:11:57] and he could write it down before
[1:11:59] right
[1:12:00] simple to me I know I'm illiterate
[1:12:03] dumb stupid and everything in the book
[1:12:06] with that simple to me
[1:12:10] that God don't choose by his desires he
[1:12:14] chooses by his foreknowledge that he
[1:12:16] looks down and sees
[1:12:19] gonna be Joe Jacob and rejected Esau
[1:12:22] without it being by foreknowledge of
[1:12:24] what they would do he's a respecter
[1:12:27] person
[1:12:29] that's right
[1:12:32] election let's just hit one or two
[1:12:37] a sign of this time
[1:12:39] 63 11.
[1:12:42] 13.
[1:12:45] it's just the church chose Matthias
[1:12:49] but God chose fall see that's the
[1:12:51] difference God always does his choosing
[1:12:53] his election he does that by election
[1:12:58] by foreknowledge
[1:13:04] he does it by his foreknowledge
[1:13:07] then he's saying that's his election
[1:13:10] he elects my foreknowledge
[1:13:13] that's the next one
[1:13:15] 1960 it is I
[1:13:18] paragraphs Eve 55.
[1:13:21] and how many believes in foreknowledge
[1:13:23] of God
[1:13:25] that he foreknowledge and election is by
[1:13:31] for knowledge
[1:13:35] election is by foreign
[1:13:39] 58 316 door to the heart
[1:13:43] he's not willing but his foreknowledge
[1:13:45] lets him know
[1:13:48] and his election might stand right above
[1:13:50] her you don't say I'm going to say this
[1:13:52] one and lose that one
[1:13:54] he wants you all saved but his
[1:13:57] foreknowledge no who would so therefore
[1:14:00] he could predestinate according to
[1:14:02] foreknowledge
[1:14:04] in that selection
[1:14:07] so when I don't make the election go
[1:14:09] back past four knowledge
[1:14:13] right read this unto you many times
[1:14:19] of the message adoption 1965-15 listen
[1:14:22] predestination looks back to
[1:14:24] foreknowledge
[1:14:25] I mean election
[1:14:31] looks back to foreknowledge
[1:14:35] and predestination looks to Destiny
[1:14:39] now here's one of the people message
[1:14:41] really don't like
[1:14:43] but he's the one that said it
[1:14:47] and predestination looks to Destiny
[1:14:49] don't forget that
[1:14:51] an election looks back here
[1:14:56] I was a kookaburra
[1:14:59] don't you tell me I was a kookaburra
[1:15:02] I always was a seed of God
[1:15:06] you ain't never heard that preached
[1:15:12] wake up
[1:15:16] always was eternal
[1:15:23] I guess this quote's wrong let's turn
[1:15:25] this down throw it away
[1:15:29] right
[1:15:32] don't forget
[1:15:34] that election looks back here here it is
[1:15:37] I was a kookaburra I was born in sin
[1:15:39] shaping an iniquity come to the world
[1:15:41] speaking lies born among Sinners father
[1:15:44] and mother and all my whole family
[1:15:46] sinners
[1:15:47] I was a kookaburra but all of a sudden I
[1:15:51] became a quick train
[1:15:53] how did it happen
[1:15:58] uh that what is that election
[1:16:01] God before the foundation of the world
[1:16:04] elected that to kookaburra was to become
[1:16:07] a grain of wheat
[1:16:12] you just don't understand brother Tale
[1:16:16] we just was this great
[1:16:22] once now I know I'm a grain of wheat
[1:16:25] because I'm saved how do I do it look
[1:16:27] back and see that he predestinated long
[1:16:30] time ago by foreknowledge he seen that I
[1:16:34] would love him so he made a perpetuation
[1:16:36] through his own son that through him I
[1:16:39] might become from a couple bird to a
[1:16:41] grain of wheat
[1:16:43] now where am I at now I'm saved I'm
[1:16:46] walking in the grace of God what does
[1:16:49] predestination look to this destiny
[1:16:53] where will he take me to
[1:16:55] and where am I going
[1:17:01] you see you say but I I wouldn't know
[1:17:02] don't tell me I serpent seed
[1:17:05] will you tell me what she was
[1:17:09] I always was a seed of God
[1:17:15] go ahead
[1:17:17] and read a few
[1:17:19] message in Israel if he gets them up
[1:17:21] face that's fine but you're saved by
[1:17:23] grace election God's foreknowledge
[1:17:25] predestination for the nation
[1:17:28] all time together message God's covenant
[1:17:31] with Abraham
[1:17:33] now that's brings us down to election
[1:17:35] now now God by for knowledge could set
[1:17:39] election
[1:17:42] by foreknowledge he could set election
[1:17:47] therefore Abraham when he's called
[1:17:50] who was he
[1:17:52] carrying Idol is worse than either
[1:17:56] God's covenant with Abraham and his seed
[1:17:59] but now Abraham was called of God by
[1:18:01] election or foreknowledge
[1:18:03] knowing that Abraham would walk before
[1:18:07] God
[1:18:09] listen
[1:18:13] knowing that Abraham would walk before
[1:18:15] God
[1:18:17] and that's the only reason tonight
[1:18:21] but the same way
[1:18:26] it's the only reason In You and I
[1:18:34] a second-handed robe
[1:18:37] 56 11 25.
[1:18:41] we cannot make one Higher black or one
[1:18:44] white
[1:18:45] neither can we add one thing to our
[1:18:47] statute by taking talk
[1:18:49] but God in his infinite grace
[1:18:52] and by his election and his
[1:18:54] foreknowledge set those things in order
[1:18:57] and every will works exactly right
[1:19:01] I like that I would be a discouraged man
[1:19:06] this morning
[1:19:07] if I didn't believe in the election and
[1:19:10] calling of God
[1:19:14] Abraham election
[1:19:16] God calls Man by election for knowledge
[1:19:18] that's Abraham's Abraham which is 56.
[1:19:24] I love this part that Christianity has
[1:19:26] no negative
[1:19:28] nothing to it ain't nothing negative in
[1:19:31] Christianity
[1:19:36] Jehovah Jireh
[1:19:38] God called Abraham not because he was
[1:19:40] Abraham God called Abraham by election
[1:19:43] Abraham was no good man no better than
[1:19:47] nobody else
[1:19:48] he probably come out of it you go drop
[1:19:51] down but I want you to get it God by
[1:19:53] foreknowledge called and elected Abraham
[1:19:56] he knew his heart he knew from the
[1:19:58] foundation of the world and Abraham only
[1:20:01] fit into God's program
[1:20:05] looked Elisha
[1:20:07] Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 book 1.
[1:20:13] brother not long ago before the world
[1:20:15] was ever had a foundation do it God
[1:20:18] through his eternal Grace he looked down
[1:20:20] and by foreknowledge he's seen you and I
[1:20:23] he knew what age we live in he knew what
[1:20:26] we would be therefore by election he
[1:20:30] could choose us before the foundation of
[1:20:32] the world to be with him without spot
[1:20:36] hmm
[1:20:40] think about it
[1:20:42] put up the lights when brother Joan will
[1:20:44] go
[1:20:45] you remember last Sunday or Wednesday
[1:20:47] when I was talking about
[1:20:50] that God was so infinite
[1:20:55] that he knew that Richard Marlowe would
[1:20:57] marry Charlotte
[1:20:59] how many kids that would have how many
[1:21:01] grandkids over the house and all that do
[1:21:03] you believe it
[1:21:07] but you see I believe God
[1:21:10] is infinite
[1:21:12] I believe God knows if Richard had not a
[1:21:16] married Charlotte
[1:21:17] and married
[1:21:19] you know somebody else
[1:21:22] and how many kids they would have had
[1:21:25] no no I don't believe that now
[1:21:28] I just believe in full knowledge
[1:21:30] before knowledge he knew he was married
[1:21:32] but he knew what would happen if he
[1:21:34] didn't now you want scripture
[1:21:36] was your after the service he said let
[1:21:38] me give you a scripture
[1:21:40] look
[1:21:41] Exodus 13 17 18. and it came to price
[1:21:45] when Pharaoh had let the people go that
[1:21:48] God LED them not
[1:21:51] through the way of the land of the
[1:21:53] Philistines although that was near in
[1:21:57] other words a shorter route
[1:22:00] for God said
[1:22:04] pre-adventure
[1:22:06] last pre-admission the people repent
[1:22:09] when they see the war and they return to
[1:22:11] Egypt he knew if they went this way
[1:22:16] but he also knew what they'd do if he
[1:22:18] went this way
[1:22:20] what kind of a god do you serve
[1:22:22] I'm sorry what kind of a god do you
[1:22:24] serve
[1:22:25] but God led to people about to the way
[1:22:28] of the Wilderness of the Red Sea
[1:22:32] because he knew if he took him any other
[1:22:34] way
[1:22:35] they mess up
[1:22:39] he knew what to do
[1:22:43] well I only just believe brother there
[1:22:44] you finally got me down to believing in
[1:22:46] foreknowledge okay hang on don't lose it
[1:22:51] you see God knows
[1:22:54] but we don't
[1:22:57] he knows why you
[1:23:00] you ever been going one way and
[1:23:02] something tell you to turn and go
[1:23:03] another way
[1:23:06] come find out there was a wreck there or
[1:23:09] something went wrong or whatever
[1:23:17] I said well you sure got an odd way of
[1:23:20] explaining God
[1:23:22] I love him anyway
[1:23:25] I love him anyway
[1:23:27] I just try to explain to you what he is
[1:23:29] to me
[1:23:34] you're going to put your own limitations
[1:23:36] upon God
[1:23:39] and make him not know
[1:23:43] I'm trying to put it to work that your
[1:23:46] thoughts would be that in his
[1:23:48] foreknowledge he knew exactly what would
[1:23:50] be
[1:23:53] and he could predestinate accordingly
[1:23:59] but he knew whether or not you'd choose
[1:24:01] him
[1:24:03] so he said to you choose you
[1:24:07] not I chose choose you
[1:24:09] this day whom you will serve
[1:24:14] he's looking at our choice
[1:24:16] he's looking at our desires to be saved
[1:24:19] and he's got it ready for us
[1:24:23] what greater thought would you want
[1:24:32] than to know that we have eternal life
[1:24:34] today because before the world
[1:24:37] God knew we'd want it
[1:24:40] and he'd have it ready let's stand we
[1:24:42] won't even have the musicians come we're
[1:24:43] just saying I love him if anybody wants
[1:24:46] to call just five minutes till 12.
[1:24:48] anybody needs
[1:24:49] healing salvation or something I'll be
[1:24:52] here with you and pray the rest of the
[1:24:53] day but that's you know we get people
[1:24:55] tired and I'm sorry I went a little
[1:24:57] empty
[1:24:59] but take on these things
[1:25:02] make your calling an election sure
[1:25:07] make sure you know what you're talking
[1:25:09] about
[1:25:12] don't just take somebody's idea well
[1:25:14] brother so-and-so said
[1:25:21] if he's in the truth he's got the truth
[1:25:23] or not he's a liar and what it don't
[1:25:24] mean no difference who the liar is
[1:25:28] right
[1:25:29] that's right
[1:25:32] here
[1:25:36] and one day last week it's not come up
[1:25:38] with my elbow
[1:25:43] just gonna agree we're gonna
[1:25:46] pray for our brother he's got to run
[1:25:48] goes out of tests made tomorrow you've
[1:25:50] got to knock come up on his arm and
[1:25:51] things we're going to believe
[1:25:52] everything's gonna be all right
[1:25:54] because we believe it
[1:25:57] oh
[1:25:58] yeah
[1:25:59] and see prior then can change it
[1:26:03] you know how it can change he can take
[1:26:05] away this or not

[1:26:14] complete physical tomorrow

[1:26:21] you're not going to say how you doing so
[1:26:22] much I'm doing wonderful
[1:26:25] if everybody was feeling as good as I am
[1:26:28] you'd be out of business

[1:26:33] problem I said I got a bad cold
[1:26:36] give me something for it
[1:26:38] why because I believe in doctors and
[1:26:41] helps and uh when I tell him in a hurry

[1:26:51] so we believe that brother Ray when he
[1:26:53] goes tomorrow that's all going to be all
[1:26:54] right

[1:26:59] it father in the name of Jesus Christ we
[1:27:02] lay our hands on our brother believing
[1:27:04] that tomorrow when he gets tired the
