TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and they celebrated every year in in the uh day of purm which is p r i m which is the day that they were saved from destruction as far as natural destruction but what a what a type of of you and I that where we saw that there was a day at Calvary right amen a day of purum at Calvary where a man purified himself and died at Calvary to set us free then here we see that there was a story here in the book of Esther of how that God worked through and I want us to see the the actors and the the parts of the play I don't know if we've a lot of you are new that since 2007 and 8 so maybe you can uhu bear with me the ones that already have heard this but I'm sure probably most of you forgot because I it's been a while so Book of Esther and then we're going to do 1 Corinthians 10:1 so just sit back and relax and we're going to go through the whole Book of Esther and show how God put all these people in their place and how it's a perfect type of you and I cuz Esther is a type of the bride all right so let's bow our heads before we get started dear heavenly father we pray Lord that today you will take this word Lord that's being spoken and make it alive in our hearts we know this happened some 3,000 years ago Lord in in history and we know that many things have been spoken about it and we know Lord that many commentaries have been written but you sent a prophet Lord that opened the book he showed us what was going on in scripture so now we can take the same Bible and and use the types and the shadows and see how Lord that we can apply it to our life and how that these things that went through a a common girl's life and and a man that she meets and certain one and and how that all is applied to our life and all the people around the players and the and the things that went on in this in this story Lord may we take it today and apply it to our life and let it not be let it not be something Lord that we just fill up time and space but Lord as the scripture says may it be an example Glory of what you and I here in this congregation what we need Lord I pray father that you just be with us heal the sick and afflicted be with the ones Lord that need salvation be with the ones that are not here today Lord the ones that are traveling be with a little bride around the world Lord bless the missionaries on the Foreign Fields Lord give them fruit for their labor the ones that are out there Lord pressing the battle we pray now that you just be with us bless us keep us we put all things in your hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen all right we got First Corinthians 10:1 now all these things happen unto them talking about the Old Testament to them all those things happen unto them for examples right and they are written Paul said for our admonition amen upon whom the ends of the world are come right which is you and I you may be seated and the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word but they're given to us four examples amen now if you'll turn to the Book of Esther and uh brother Bob said his kids were actually having some some questions about the Book of Esther so maybe this is a a very fitting time that we that we go through it but I want to go through and and it is not coincidence that this happened it's not that it's written in scripture this way for a coincidence we just saw that they were written for our example right so let's go if you have a if you have a scull fill Bible look at Scofield's footnotes now it won't be up here but if you have a Scofield bible I'm going to read his commentary because this is going to set a stage and tell you where this is going to happen all right so if you have a scull field Bible look in the footnotes if you don't just listen to what I'm saying the significance of the Book of Esther is that it testifies to the secret watch care of Jehovah over dispersed Israel the name of God does not once occur but in no other book of the Bible is his Providence more conspicuous in other words the Providence of God working in a group of people a mere Remnant returned to Jerusalem now listen to this the mass of the nation preferred the easy and lucrative life what is le to right now this is commentary from a man scofi it says the mass of the nation preferred the easy and lucrative life under the Persian rule in other words they like the normal he High minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God so it's l to see all the way up but God did not forsake them you now are inlay you drove a leot ofan car you're feeling some good leot of and air conditioning right now right so we're not but we're not part of the leosan doctrine of of of the taking the rights of the people and all that but we are a little bit at ease and a little they like the lucrative life so the story of this is is Israel was dispersed or the Jews were dispersed but there was a group that stayed in Persia that stayed there because of the easy life they weren't exactly slaves they were actually integrated into some of the civilization there in the mes and Persians and this King he was over 127 different provinces so this guy aurus he wasn't just a mere king of just a little bitty country he ruled from Russia all the way to Egypt that's pretty big the m Persians were some of the greatest they were some of the greatest writings and some of the greatest men and and philosophy of the day came from the me and Persians so here we got a we're starting we're setting a stage here that where the Book of Esther begins says now came to pass and the days of a surus this is the sorus which rained from India to Ethiopia all right over 170 and 20 provinces that's a lot all right so now he was a king and this King had power and he was a great ruler so we're going to look at him and see that that this man and even if you'll pull up the the Greek Lexicon the word asaurus there's no title there's no meaning to his name yeah his name was a mystery m-hm his name was a mystery question mark they don't know what his name was you know what we're going to give him God right we're going to give him the name God cuz he was a God over that Province all right so that in those days when the king aurus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shushan the palace that word shushan means Lily he's a lily of the valley amen you see how this you watch you're going to see all this this picture come into into being and and if it bores you then God forgive me for taking up your sweet time in the third year of his Reign we're going to see a lot of Threes And Sevens and you're going to see this all right in the third year of his Reign he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants the power of Persia and media he didn't leave nothing out he's almighty God he owns everything all right the Nobles and princes of the provinces being before him when he showed the riches of his glorious Kingdom and the honor of his excellent Majesty many days even 104 score days and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people people all the people so it wasn't excluding anybody that were present in shushan the palace but unto Great and Small there's no big eyes and little you there's no great ones to God and there's no little ones we're all the same so what but watch this King show and this is what it really helped me because it's it's it's presenting this King as a very righteous man now he might have not been but he's it's portraying in this in this story that he had all power but even common people could come to his Feast yeah right even Great and Small right seven days are seven Church ages in the court of the garden of the king's Palace all right now look you had to be present look at verse five he made a feast on the ones that were there right on Sunday yeah and Wednesday yeah right if you weren't there you weren't invited yeah both great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the king's Palace where were white green and blue hangings fashioned with cords of fine linen and we could go through all that look at verse seven now they gave them drinking vessels of gold the vessels being diverse from one from the other in other words they all weren't the same right build they were not the same Personality yeah but but he gave them all drink and it was all in Gold but they were diverse one from another and Royal Wine in abundance not just a portion he gave it to them in abundance remember we're in the lay out of seean church age he give it to us in abundance according to the state of the king and the drinking was according to the law in other words nothing got out of control he gave us the word as we needed it all right because remember you got a group that drinks of the wine of the fornication that gets drunk on it right in Revelations the old wh Church remember right she drinks it and gets drunk off of it this was this was given out in portion according to the law none did compel in other words nobody complain for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to Every Man's pleasure all right let's go to verse n because here's where vasy comes in now vashy was the wife she was the queen she was the one that was the that was the king's wife right and Vash time which the word Vash time means beautiful she was a beautiful Church she was adorned in many things she was very beautiful she wasn't ugly she was beautiful John admired her yeah in the Book of Revelations yeah John admired this queen and Bash the queen Made A Feast for the women in the Royal house now look the king made a feast and she decided she was going to have a feast right a separate one yeah all right so we got to get a stage set here for Esther to come on the scene because King aorus he said we're going to have a feast and we're going to have this and we're going to have that and then bashy pops up and she's going to make a feast for the women in the Royal house which belonged to King aorus on the seventh day when the heart of the King was married with wine he commanded these people now hang on just a second because what vashti was doing was she was setting up a separate Feast oh yeah denomination the king didn't cut her off she cut herself off right by making her own Feast see that's what got the king God to thinking hey she doesn't want to be at my Feast she wants to make one of her own all right so that got the natural King to thinking here and showing that that Vash though she's beautiful she didn't do what the king said to do all right cuz she had a feast for the women yeah churches yeah mhm right come on over here on my side she says oh yeah but now look on the seventh day listen when the heart of the King was married with wine he commanded seven people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7even look at the last one what's his name carcass where the carcass is there the Eagles shall be gathered you see how this is kind of working in because he commanded these people and these other ones have names like man man means faithful abatha means god-given they all have a god-given name each one of these do like the seven Church ages you come up to where now what did he do he gathered he commanded these Church age Messengers yeah everybody okay right he commanded these Church AE Messengers seven of them the seven chamberlains which were what Unix right they were Unix before the before the king and actually you can look they served in the presence of the king yeah they were right there with him the Seven Stars the seven Church Ages were right there with him the whole time but now because remember what's going to develop out of these seven Watch What Happens now what they were going to do was to bring vashi the queen before the king with the Royal Crown to show the people yeah her beauty he was wanting to show his bride exactly all right to show the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on but the queen vasti refused refused to come to the king's commandment not by the king he sent it to The Messengers right and The Messengers went to vashan by his chamberlains the king didn't do it he had one of his Messengers go do it or his Messengers to go but the queen vast refused to come what he sent seven Church age prophets to call out a bride he called a bride out but there's a bride refused yeah right there's a there's a group that refused furtherment of the word the prophet said she refused actually you know what she's saying she's refusing the king she wasn't refusing just to come to the feast right she was refusing the King right and any part of what he was having to do right you see how she's separating herself because of what she wants cuz she wanted to have a feast all right but the queen basti refused to come to the king's come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very rough and his anger burned in him then the king said to the wise men which knew the times thank God for so was the king's manner toward all in you the law and judgment in other words what did he do he commanded down to his servants or his his uh wise men and then they carried out what he said that's the way a true that's the way a true leader should be and the next unto him now watch this and the next unto him was carena shethar aditha Tarsus meis marsana and mukan now when you come to Maman you you don't have to look it up but he was number seven all right keep that in mind because he's going to pop back up in a minute now why didn't the other six pop back up number seven pops back up all right so watch what he's doing mukan the seven princes of Persian now these were the wise men these were not the chamberlains these were the wise men all right and the Seven princes of Persia and media which saw the king's face and when sat at first in the Kingdom so they were right there with the King what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to law they couldn't do it any other way they had to do it according to law according to law because she had not performed the Commandment of the King by the chamberlands and mukan which is the seventh Prince number seven he gets up and does the talking right now why didn't the other six number seven is got a read he re you have to watch number seven in all this happening listen and mukan answered before the king and the princes vast the queen hath done wrong not done wrong to the king only mukam brought it to his attention that she wasn't just doing this to the King right she was doing it to all the people right but also do all the princes and all the people that are in all the provinces of the king so he's bringing it to the attention of the king said hey King this is not just you that she's you hear what brother Brown's coming in here you hear where that seventh angel messenger is calling out saying hey this is not right this is not only just going to it's just we're not just turning God down you're turning everything down all the princes all the people and all the province for this deed of the queen watch this for this deed of the queen shall come abroad un all churches women are churches right so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be reported the king of sorus commanded vashi the queen to be brought in before him but she came not yeah likewise shall the ladies of Meda and Persia say this day unto all the king's princes which have heard of the deed of the queen thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath that seventh messenger was telling the king if we don't stop this right MH it's going to grow now what did Brother R come out doing he was preaching to the denominations get out of that thing you've become too much of a big of a big part of the of the Christian World come out of that because you're going to there's going to rise what brother R say the Pentecostal that you're contentious and you got this and you got that you see how God is doing this but I want you to to watch but now Esther's not come on the scene yet right cuz she's the bride she's not the messenger right she's not the Chamberlain she's not she's not that she's the bride all right but she's staying head for a little while until all these things can come out all right so now verse 19 if it please the king now he's telling the king this the king's not telling him this he's telling the king what he should do right now we're not telling God what to do but remember brother B said we're supposed to remind God of his promises and what he will do with his word right all right so that's what we're looking at here if it please the king Let There Go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and and mes that it be not altered right boy pretty strong words that it be not altered that vashy come no more brother Brown said they lodges remember we talking about that the other day when he said they were lodges they can't be any more than that they're dead you can pull the people out but you cannot convert a church right they're dead they're done they're just like the Moose Lodge or the Masons or anything they're that's all they are all right so that's what he's saying this seventh messenger is telling telling the king that vasai come no more before King ass serus no more cut off looks like she's dead right and let the King give her Royal Estate unto another that is better than she he's taking that furtherment of the word that vasti should have received and going to give it to someone else all right so you see how this is set up and when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published about 1,00 of them mhm so sermons yeah right published H right cuz he said Let It Be written and when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his Empire for it is great all the wives shall give their husband's honor in other words putting it back in order right that's what the prophet's message is for is to put everything back in order all right both great and small I like that in there because it's not we're not talking about some great group of people no it's a great and small it's everybody the congregation and the whole works that you give your husband honor and the saying pleas the King right and the princes and the King did according to the word of Maman yeah now the king did according to his word yeah for he sent letters to all the king King's provinces into every Province according to the writing thereof and every people after their language thank God they're doing that now that every man should bear rule in his own house yeah bringing everything back to order where the husband is the head and the wife all right into every Province according to the writing thereof and every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house and it should be published according to the language of every people right so he wanted to make sure that that sermon got out to all the world and that all the world was able to hear those sermons and understand that headship is where it's at right he didn't talk about whether she could cook good or cook bad or headship the husband was the rule and the wife was to go under him all right so now let's go to Esther 2 you're going to find a lady comes in to being now after all this after these things when the Wrath of the King was appeased he remembered basai and what she had done and what was decreed against her yeah then said the king's servants that ministered unto him you it it actually like the king ain't got a lot of sense but the king does have a lot of sense because what it is these people are around him so much they know what they know his mind exactly they know what kind of person he is they know what kind of uh uh they know what he's going to dish out so they're just going to remind him then said the king's servants that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the King right and let the king appoint officers and all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto sushan the palace to the house of the women unto the custody of Hagi now the word Hagi in the strongs is a little bit different but I looked it up in another place and I didn't write it down but you know what the word h g means the word the word yeah now where else would you put a where else would you put a man right under the custody he's going to bring the young virgins and the women and how more to teach the young virgins than to teach the women than the word cuz remember Hagi or Hagi was a unic he was where he could be around the women this is the natural story he could be around the women and be The Keeper of the women and not have a problem all right same way with the word we're neither male or female in the gospel we're all females you know but until to the custody of hagga the king's Chamberlain Keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them now we'll talk about that in just a second cuz we know what the purification is in their part but in our part we see what the purification was right where more can you get purified than to go to hagga the word all right and the maidens which pleaseth now listen this is still the guy this is still the servants Talking To The King and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be Queen instead of Asti and the thing pleased the king and he did so so he calls all the virgins in he says all right come in you're going to go over here and see this person named Ha guy and you're going to be purified and then I'm going you're going to present yourself to me all right but now look now we got to interject another character yeah into the life of Esther which was a a family member yeah all right and his name was Mori right now what does the word morai mean you can pull that one up about 5' five yeah 5' 6 now why would this person name being morai and it mean little man well brother Brandon was a little man right he this was this person was the cousin and the adopted father because Esther's mother and father was dead her old family was gone so she had to be raised by a cousin but if you'll go on through where we wanton today but if you'll continue in the studies look where he came from right and look who he was a student of right oh zerubabel what did zerubabel do zerubabel built the temple right so he was a Jew who returned from Exile with zerubabel yeah and you can read that in over in the book of Zechariah over in there about zerubba but that would but you see how they're all connected yes he come out with zerubabel who was to build the temple back and he was to restore order and here's Mori which we'll read right here it says now in shushan the palace there was a certain Jew so he wasn't outside he was in he was there he was in the palace whose name was Mori the son of gy the son of shami the son of Kish a benjaminite come from The Tribe of Benjamin not too bad right when the benjaminites are considered to be the 144,000 right okay you see how this is kind of all coming together here and remember who Kish was Kish was the father of Saul yeah all right you say how'd that tie in brother R's family wasn't in very good line drunks made whiskey right so you say well that's a great tribe but now when he come from right here he wasn't a very good guy but still God's used that lineage and brought it all the way from Benjamin down to Kish Shi to Mori so he or gy now look who had been carried away from Jerusalem verse 6 with the Captivity which had been carried away with Janiah king of Judah when whom nebuch bzar the king of Babylon had carried away and he brought with her he brought I mean he brought with him hadassa yeah they were K folks yeah and who is hadassa but Esther right that's the word hadassa means Myrtle now if you'll look in Leviticus 23:33 see this just breaks out to a whole different study if you want to I'm just going to do this real quick today but the study of Esther brings you right back to Myrtle which is used in the Feast of Tabernacles in Leviticus 23:33 and that's where the word hadassa came from is Myrtle but then you've got Esther which means star his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother she had neither father or mother she didn't have somebody to tell her what to do but she was brought up by his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother the maid was fair and beautiful who Mori when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter all right so here you've got Esther which is the type of the Bride now she shows up her Jewish name is hadassa but she got a name change to Esther but her Jewish name was hadassa and she kept that name for a little while but that's something else to get into later so it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree Was Heard got to be there to hear it and when many maidens were gathered together unto the palace to the custody of Hagi that Esther was brought also un the King's house to the custody of the word right of Hagi The Keeper of the women in other words Mori said here this is my daughter this is my family here's I'm turning you over to be part of those virgins right and the Maiden pleased who not the king she hadn't met him yet right please haga the word and the Maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him he's talking about hagga not talking about the king not talking about Mori talking about Mori turned the bride over to the word right and the word is what's nurturing us now right and look he speedily gave her her things for purification he didn't lag around and he didn't let her dilly dally around he gave her speedily gave her things for her purification all right now that word purification we can get on down a little bit further but it really means to scour to polish to scrub and to cleanse and that's what they did they took the women they took them through a time of purification which such things as belong to her and give her seven maidens which were meat to be given her out of the King's house this girl is special because hey guys not just giving her just some maidens and giving her some he's given her seven maidens which were out of the King's house already okay and he preferred her and her Maids unto the best place of the House of the women now why Esther must be special yeah but now remember Esther was a Jew yes keep that in mind Esther was a Jew and and she didn't want to show herself or her people right okay cuz look Esra had not showed her people let me read get my oh estra had not showed her people nor her Kindred for morai had charged her that she should not show it but now watch verse 11 Mori didn't just leave her I hope you're thinking a little spiritual here yeah right Mori didn't just leave her with Hagi right and leave her in the palace and leave her alone Mori walked every day he didn't miss a service right he walked every day before the court of the women's house now he couldn't go in right he can't go in he had to stay out here but he kept watch that's right Glory before the courtner of the woman's house to know how Esther did and what should become of her he didn't just kick her out and go kick his feet up and set under a shade tree somewhere no he wanted to see what was going on he wanted to make sure she was giv the best and that she was doing her best Now read this now when every maid's turn was come to go to king asaurus after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purification if you want to read that you don't have to pull it up but it's strongs 47 95 and 4838 IP means a purification the scouring of the people are the women for were the days of their purification accomplished to it 6 months with the oil of myrr now what does myrr mean gold frankincense right myrrh my means death deity dedicated to death all right so you got to die out 6 months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of the women then thus came every Maiden un the king remember the prophet said there's been Brides brides churches brides and churches right there's been all kind of people trying to present their s to the king yeah and whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women under the King's house in the evening she went and on the tomorrow she returned turned into the second house of the women to the custody of shagar the king's Chamberlain which kept the concubines all right now that word Shaz God has got a good meaning to it it means servant of the beautiful the king's Chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in under the king no more except the king delighted in her and then she was called by name do you understand what it's doing it's saying that these women would would go see the king at in the evening time and if he if he liked what he saw he would call her by name and she would come back she came into the king no more except the king delighted in her and she was called by name yeah got it yes she came no more to the king except the king called her by name now when the turn of Esther the daughter of Abigail the uncle of Mori who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but what the word gave her right remember that's ha guy right nothing else the prophet of God said she required nothing else she didn't require earbobs or pained face or tight dress that's what he was saying in quotes that we got but I'm I'm just kind of cutting the quotes out but just kind of get you to look at the Book of Esther and see that it was it's a beautiful picture of even if you break it down a little bit more of how you and I are supposed to act and about the the um the seven steps like we're talking about downstairs and the statue of a perfect man and the things she had to get to that place she had to get to a place to where the king called her name and it was not ashamed to call her name see now when the turn of Esther came the daughter of Abigail the uncle taking her for daughter was come to go into the king she required nothing but what hagga the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them not just the king she obtained favor of all of them that looked upon her all right so Esther was taken under the king into his house Royal in the 10th month which is the month tth in the seventh year of of his Reign seventh why' it have to be the seventh why couldn't it have been the fourth or the sixth or the eighth or the 12th in the seventh year of his Reign this bride shows up and she's so beautiful right she just knocks him off of his feet right and the King loved Esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal Crown he didn't even let her leave the palace and come back he put the crown on her right there yeah so he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of vashti then the king made a great feast under all his princes and servants even Esther's Feast see what God does God presents the bride and he wants all the attention to what the bride he doesn't want all the attention to him my goodness he created the world what else do we need yeah but he wants to present the bride and show it in this in this story of Esther he wants to show how that you and I have come to a place that this King loves us so much right and he is he's self-sufficient he can know all and do all but he doesn't want to do that he wants to listen to the chamberlains he wants to listen to The Messengers he wants to listen to even he's going to listen to here in a minute and like I said you'd think this king didn't have no sense but he had but he was one of the greatest Kings in this story he was one of the greatest kings that ever reigned because what did he do he wanted the other people to get the honor he wanted the other people to get the glory all right then the king made a great feast into all his princes and his servant even Esther's feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king he was kind of happy amen and when the ver were gathered together the second time then Mori sat at the king's gate now see Mori didn't leave he's still there that's right cuz remember there's a problem coming up and she needs Mori right yes there's a problem coming and she's going to need Mori she can't talk to the king she got to talk to Mori first right all right Esther had not yet showed her Kindred nor people as Mori had charged her see what did Esther look at Esther Esther was always she she she did what Mori said she was not a rebellious child that's right for Esther did the Commandment of Mori right like as when we she was brought up with him in other words she listened to what he said and then did what he said all right and that caught favor with Mori and also you'll see in a minute with the king in those days while Mori said at the king's gate two of the king's chamberlains big them and terish of those which kept the door were wroth and sought to lay hands on King aorus now what happened is this is going to be into the natural story of where Mori hears these two guys trying to take over the kingdom and what's going to happen is Mori is going to hear this and then Mori is going to go back mhm and he's going to tell it to Esther and Esther's going to tell it to the King right all right in those days while Mori sat in the king's gate two of the Kings chamberlains beIN and terish of those who kept the door were wroth and sought to lay hands on King of sorus and the thing was known to Mori he had some discernment who told it unto Esther the queen right whatever I get from God brother BR said I'm going to tell you amen right I I like what brother Claude said the other day brother Claude said I'm glad brother brand you know brother BR said I can't keep a secret remember he said when he said I can't keep a secret well I'm glad he couldn't right amen I'm glad he couldn't keep a secret cuz whatever God told him he told us he couldn't keep a secret thank God that's kind of one way that you it's all right to tell those things like that and the thing was known to Mori who told it unto Esther the queen and certified the king there of in mori's name and when Inquisition was made of the matter it was found out therefore they were both hanged on the tree and it was written in the book of Chronicles before the king now that's going to go in a book and that's going to be left over to the side this is a natural story all right but it's going to have an implication here in just a few minutes all right Esther chapter 3 after these things the king of sorus PR hmon the son of hamadaa the agite and advanced him now the word hmon means magnificent now hmon kind of sounds like ham Hamman remember ham was the right one that did the sinning so hmon we're going to he's going to be the devil from now all right so hmon but he was beautiful because remember the king promoted him you say how's that work out God promoted the devil did he not made him as number one right-hand Man song leader yeah anointed but after these that but that's the truth it's what brother Ram said it was his song leader he was he's anointed he's an anointed cherub he's the one that can anoint you to do the wrong thing all right and after these things did King ofur promote hmon the son of ham hamadaa the agot and advanced him and set seal upon all seat above all the princes that were with him and all the king's servants that were in the king's gate bowed in reverence hmon but one guy yeah one guy this guy was always a thorn in Hon's flesh and all the king's servants that were in the king's gate bowed in reverence hmon for the king had so commanded concerning him but Mori bowed not nor did him any reverence he didn't like that right then the king's servants which were in the king's gate said unto Mori why transgressed thou the king's commandment all right now came to pass when they spoke daily unto him he didn't answer that question he didn't have to he didn't answer that it just goes down and says now it came to pass they asked him H why are you doing this now it came to pass when they spake daily unto him and he hearkened not unto them that they told hmon to see where the mori's matter would stand for he had told them that he was a Jew all right so he told him he was different he had a different lineage and when hmon saw that Mori bowed not nor did him any reverence then was hmon full of Wrath so this little man on the scene here he's not giving the devil any credit all right and and the devil's mad about this all right and he thought scorned to lay hands on morai alone for he had showed him the people of morai wherefore hmon sought to destroy all the Jews so now hmon knows that the Jews are that close that Mori is a Jew but now he's going to find out also about Esther all right cuz God don't tell his secrets to everybody right that were throughout the whole Kingdom of asaurus even the people of Mori which is the Jews so now what hmon has got to do hmon has devised a plan Mori has made him so mad he's found out he was a Jew so he's going to kill the Jews to get back at Mori right all right ain't that the way the devil does oh yeah he's that way all the time you do something good he's going to try to make you do something bad to get back to thing you done good all right so here's the devil and here's Mori and then Esther's fixing to pop up in just a minute in the first month that is the month Nissen in the 12th year of King of Swords they cast poor which that's where purum is going to come from they cast poor that is the lot before hmon from day to day and from month to month to the 12th month that is the month Adar let's keep reading and hmon said unto King ofor there is a certain people right they're scattered abroad and dispersed right despised and rejected amen I want to be part of that group right I don't care I like that the devil don't like me all right and hon said into King ofus there's a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom and thy their laws are diverse from all people yeah neither keep they the king's law therefore it is not for the king's Prophet to suffer them now they did keep the law he was lying they did remember it says here they were at ease they did keep the law that's why they stayed where they were all right if it please the king Let It Be written that they may be destroyed and I will pay 10,000 talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business to bring it into the king's Treasury and the King took his ring from his hand now you think boy this is something now watch the king took his ring from his hand and gave it to hmon now remember the Lord knows what he's doing oh yeah cuz remember you say how can you type that now did not God say hey devil you you remember my servant job in other words he said say take my ring in other words take what you can go down there and just do what you want to with him he brought job up to the devil he said hey satan if you if you you can wellow you got a hedge around him well watch this the king took his ring from his hand and gave it to hmon the son of Heda the Jews enemy and the King said unto hmon the silver is given to thee the people also to do with him as it seemed good to thee then were the king scribes called on the 13th day of the first month and there was written according to all that hmon had commanded to the king's lieutenants and governors that were in every Province and ruler of every people of every Province according to the writings thereof to every people after their language in the name of King it was written and sealed with the king's ring now what was it it was sent to kill and destroy cuz remember when the church AG messenger sent his letters out and sent his sermons out there was a copy behind it oh yeah Satan's always a copycat right so what's happening here these letters are being sent out to kill and to cause to perish all Jews both young and old little children and women in one day now when is Israel going to be born in a day but he was going to kill them in a day you see how this is going to flipflop here especially on hymon and the letters were sent by post into all the king's Province to destroy to kill to cause to perish all Jew Jews both young and small and women in one day even until the 13th day of the 12th month which is the month Adar and to take the spoil of them for a prey so now the decree is written and sealed with the king's Ring It Was Written In The Name of the King and seal with the king's ring right but now remember the king didn't do it no the king didn't do it he gave the ring to hmon he gave the writing to some the other the other people all right the copy of the writings for a commandment to be given in every Province was published unto all the people that they should be ready against that day what hmon was going to do is he was going to go and kill the Jews in one day he was going to kill that race of people in one day now the post went out being hastened by the king's commandment and the decree was given in shushan the palace and the king and hmon sat down to drink but the city shushan was perplexed all right so this is where we go into watch Mori when morai perceived all that was done now Mori wasn't there so this little guy must have a little discernment cuz he perceived all that was being done Mori rent his clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out in the midst of the city and cry with a loud and bitter cry but now watch and came even before the king's gate for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth and then he sees all this and in every Province whatsoever the king's commandment his decree came there was a great mourning among the Jews and fasting and weeping and wailing and many laying sackcloth and Ashes so Esther's Maiden her Chamberlain came and told it to her then was the queen exceedingly grieved and she sent Raymond to clothe Mori and take away a sackcloth from him but he received it not then called Esther for hatch one of the king's Chamberlain who had appointed to attend upon her and gave him a commandment to Mori to know what it was and why it was so hatx went forth to morai into the street of the city which was before the king's gate and morai told him of all that had happened unto him of the sum of money that hmon had promised to pay for the king's treasure for the Jews to destroy them also he gave him a copy of the writings of the decree that was given at shushan to destroy them to show it into Esther and declare mared unto her and to charge her that she should go in un the king now why did Mori go he wasn't the bride right he wasn't the bride he was part of the family but he wasn't the bride so he had to get a message to Esther how to approach the king cuz remember without Esther being called she could be killed you had to be called or summoned by the king or you or you had to be or you were killed also he gave gave him the copy of the writings of the decree given to shushan to destroy them to show it unto Esther and declare it unto her to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him and make requests before him for her people right you see why Esther's so great as far as even just a person she wasn't thinking about her anymore after this what she found out what hmon was going to do she had compassion for her own people and hatch came and told Esther the words of Mori that's right again Esther spake you missed one go back down again Esther spake unto hatch and gave him commandment unto Mori all the king servant and the people the king's Province do know that whatsoever whether the man or woman shall come into the king to the inner Court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such whom the king shall hold out the golden seer right that he may live but I have not been called to come into the king for 30 days but he's not going to forget her and they told to Mori Esther's words then Mori commanded to answer Esther think not with thyself right that thou shalt Escape in the King's house more than all the Jews right for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thy and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knowest whether Thou Art come to the king for such a time as this what's Mori telling her he's showing her her position right who knowest whether Thou Art come to this Kingdom for such a time as this right in other words he was telling Esther this is what you were brought here for amen this is what you were brought into all this was to go and try to save your people then Esther B them return Mori this answer go gather together all the Jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me neither eat nor drink these day or night I also and my maidens will Fast likewise and so will I go in unto the King which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish amen God I got nothing else I'm coming to you uh nothing I can bring and hadn't seen him for 30 days that's what she said she he hadn't called me for 30 days if I perish I perish so Mori went his way and did according to all that Esther had commanded him now it came to pass on the third day kind of something about these third days and seven days right on the third day Esther put on her royal apparel dad just got finished with that in Revelations 19 right cuz remember she's not a bride anymore she's his wife amen but she still got to put on that garment cuz she knows that King wants to see her if she's going to see the king she didn't have on curlers and flipflops right she didn't you know that's how you get in trouble a lot and I'm like Daddy and he got in trouble and I guess I'll get in trouble too but you know your sisters you put on your best and you put on everything you got to go work for your boss but when your husband comes home anyway but Esther but Esther knew what to put on right amen she was at a place where somebody didn't have to tell her she she's not conferring with anybody right here right she's going at this alone but she knows from her past experience come on somebody they know you know from your past experience how to approach God right she knows how to approach this King in a way where he can't turn her down now wouldn't you do that if it was my life dependent on it and I'd already been his wife for a long time I ought to know what pleases him and I'm going to put that on if he hates red and green together I'm not going out there with red and green on if he loves blue I'm going to be blue from head to toe but that's what she done she put on her royal apparel amen not somebody else's she put on hers right and stood in the inner Court of the King's house outer Court inner court she couldn't go into the holy of holies yet right she had to be asked to come in right and the inner Court of the King's house over against the King's house and the King sat upon his Royal Throne the King was in the palace right in the Royal house over against the Gate of the house and it was so when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight yeah amen glory oh he hadn't seen us with his eyes yet not his physical eyes but when he does when he sees us when we go meet him in the Air Buddy there's going to be a meeting she obtained favor in his sight and the King held out to Esther the goldm scepter that was in his hand so Esther Drew near and touch the top of the scepter then said the king unto her now do you know what a scepter is most scepter in the olden times were a ball and there was a cross on top of it now we don't know that's what happened but I'm going to say that's what happened yeah cuzz that's what that's the only way we can approach God Is by The Cross so Esther Drew near and touched the top of the scepter then said the king unto her What wilt thou Queen Esther he didn't hesitate he said what do you need and what is thy request and it shall even given the shall be given be even given thee to half now listen if we get to this if we don't we may stop and do it some other time cuz there's a great story that keeps on going all the way into where Mori is is put up in a position but we'll maybe not get to that cuz we I don't want to hold you too long so maybe we'll stop in just a minute but it shall be given to thee under half the kingdom but now remember he says that twice but when he gets to the very end when all this is over and haymon's dead and Hon's sons are killed and uh everything's restored back to order he walks up to Esther and he says Esther what do you want he didn't say up until half the Kingdom right he says whatever you ask that's what you'll get and Esther answered and said if it seemed good unto the king watch her she's not some dumb kid she know who's she knows who the problem is it's the devil and she's fixing set a trap for him and Esther answered if it seemed good unto the king let the king and hmon come this day into the banquet that I have prepared for him then the king said cause hmon to make haste that he may do as asther has said so the king and hmon came to the banquet that Esther had prepared all right now look and the King said unto Esra the banquet of wine what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request even to half the kingdom there it is again even to half the kingdom it shall be performed then answered eser and said my petition and my request says if I have found favor in the sight of the king and if it please the king to Grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and hmon come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them and I will do tomorrow as the King has said yeah then went hmon forth that day joyful oh yeah and with a glad heart but there was another guy there but when hmon saw Mori in the king's gate that he stood not up nor moved for him he was full of indignation against Mori nevertheless hmon refrained himself wasn't time and when he came home he sent and call for his friends and zarus his wife you always got like Dad said you never sin alone he brought his whole family into this one and like Daddy said you know the the spirits of those devils are are there Satan's subjects I mean they're Satan's family just like God's got a family Satan's got a family but you're going to see Satan's family destroyed here and hmon told them of the glory of these riches and the multitude of his children and all the things wherein the king had promoted him and how he had Advanced him above the princes and Servants of the king you see how the devil is he he thinks he can do something he thinks he thinks he's got some power hmon said moreover yay Esther the queen did not let no man come in with the King into the banquet that she had prepared but myself she was setting a trap for him and tomorrow am I invited unto her also with the the king yet all this availeth me nothing so long as I see that nasty guy Mori the Jew sitting at the king's gate then said zarus his wife and all his friends let a Gallow be made of 50 cubics high tomorrow speak thou unto the king that Mori may be hang there on then go thou merrily with the King into the banquet and the thing pleased hmon and he caused The Gallows to be made so you see what's happening Hon's familyes even getting involved and his wife is involved saying hey kill this guy he didn't have enough guts to do it but I guess his wife did there's a thought there on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicle and they were read before the king and it was found written epistle that Mori had told of the two guys that that were that were uh conspiring to kill him they sought to lay hands on the king and the King said what honor and dignity has been done to Mori for this in other words what have we done for this guy I I don't remember it but now I've brought back to my memory I I'm you know the Lord said bring back the things to his remembrance you know all right then said the king's servants that ministered unto him there's nothing we done for him and the King said who is in the court now hmon was come he's got bad times here a couple of times he's got real bad timing but the devil's got some pretty bad timing now hmon was coming to the outward Court of the King's house to speak unto the king to hang Mori on the Galla that he had prepared for him now he was fixing to concoct some story and actually he was fixing to tell the king and he was a Jew cuz hmon knew that all right and the King's servant said unto him behold hmon standeth in the court and the King says let him come in so hmon came in and the King said unto him what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honor yeah now the devil thought in his heart to whom would the king Delight to do honor more than me you see all that I me me me stuff you know that's not a servant that's not a servant attitude this whole hmon guy has got the devil just I mean he's got him right just the character is perfect I wish they'd make a movie out of this I mean they made parts of a movie but they ought to make one totally by the Bible when hmon thought in his heart to whom would the king Delight to do honor more than myself and hymon answerers the King for the man whom the king delighted to honor let the Royal apparel be brought which the King used to wear and let the horse at the king rides on yeah a white one and the Crown Royal which is set upon his head and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hands of one of King's most noble princes H yeah that he may array the man with all whom the king delighted to honor and bring him on Horseback through the streets of the city and Proclaim Proclaim therefore him thus shall it be done to the man who the king delighted the honor and the King said to hmon make haste take the apparel and the horse as thou H has said and do even so to Mori now about that time the devil's face is turning red more than it is is read that he thought he was going to get all this glory and H now you know this is the character what watch in all the things of of Satan even in the Old Testament and the New Testament watch he sits in the temple of God showing himself to be as God here Satan that exalted himself remember there in in Ezekiel where Satan had exalted himself the prince of tire and all that you know this is the Devil Himself just doing this but now look God's fixing the to pull a fast one on him here and let nothing fail of all that thou has spoken he was doing what the devil said to do you see how God's going to honor his people and that's right because the devil is our best he is he's the best guy to get us to go to God that's right he he's the best one there's nobody else can do it right he's the only one that can drive us to God the only one all right and that's just it is cuz the king said unto hmon then took hmon the apparel and the horse and raid Mori now you think this guy didn't want to kill him and brought him on Horseback through the street of the city and proclaimed before him thus shall it be done unto the man who the king delighteth the honor and Mori came again into the king's gate but hmon hasted to his house crying and having his head covered he was embarrassed and hmon told zerus his wife and all his friends his wife and his friends everything that befallen him wi he wise he woo then said his wise men and zarth his wife unto him if Mori be of the seed of the Jews before him who has begun to fall Thou shalt not Prevail against him but Thou shalt surely fall before him look at they're prophesying against their own right he can't win even his own family it's prophesying against him and while they were yet talking with him came the King's chamberlains and hasted to bring hmon into the banquet that Esther had prepared now let's get back to the banquet so the king and hmon came to the banquet with Esther the queen so here's all the players you got the king you got hmon and you got Esther that's right all right so you got so you got the Lord you got the devil and you got the bride right all right and the King said unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine I like that banquet of wine we're fixing to take communion but wine is a representation of what the Holy Spirit all right what is thy petition Queen Esther and it shall be granted unto them what is thy request and it shall be formed even to half the kingdom here he is telling her half the kingdom again then Esther the queen answered and said if I have found favor in thy side oh King and if it pleased the king look at her servant life and if it please the king let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request now here she's telling him I'm a Jew right for we are sold I and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we had been sold for Bond men and bond women I had held my tongue although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage now what she's saying is the King's already said it and there's nothing she can do about it unless the king reverse it that's right but now the king's fixing to tell her he can't reverse it once it's written it's it's written you can't take it back all right but now look but King aurus answers and said unto Esther the queen who is he and where is he that dur presume in his heart to do so and Esther said the adversarii and enemy is this wicked hmon yeah then hmon was afraid before the king and the queen he wasn't just afraid of the king y he was not just afraid of the king at this point right the lord the devil and the bride he's not just afraid of the King right now he's afraid of the king and the queen right cuz he has been listening to the conversation Esther saying if it please you do this if it please you do this you hear the words coming forth and the King arises from the banquet of wine and his wrath and went into the palace garden and hmon stood up to make requests for his life to who not the king where the devil 's worst enemy right we are he can talk to God he can understand what God's doing kind of sort of a little bit but he just can't understand us that's right I don't think he can cuz we were once his partner we were once in his family right and now we're over here acting a different way yet we're in the same body so we're a paradox to him for he saw that there was evil look and hmon stood up to make requests for his life to Esther he didn't go out there to the king he went to Esther yeah for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king he was thinking if I can get Esther on my side see how the devil is if I can get Esther on my side she can petition the king to save my life not then the king returned out of the palace Garden into the place of the banquet of wine and hmon was Fallen upon the bed where Esther was bad mistake bad mistake then said the king will he Force the queen also before me in the house he might have had a chance at first but when he goes to messing with the bride when Satan goes to messing with the bride that God's not going to pull he's not going to pull no punches as the word went out of his mouth they covered Hon's face and harbona one of the Chamberlain said before the king behold also the Gallow 50 ft which hmon had made for Mori he's telling him what's going on now who had spoken good for the king standeth in the house of hmon then the king said hang him there on right so they hanged hmon on The Gallows that he had prepared for Mori then was the king's wrath pacified now to finish the story right here real quick I'm not going to do the rest of it but what happened was Now esther has come and Mori now look let's let's read this on that day did the king of sorus give the house of hmon the Jews enemy unto Esther the queen and Mori came before the king for Esther had told what he was unto her and the King took off his ring which he had taken from hmon and gave it to Mori now that was the man that needed it right there all right there was the adoption signal to Mori and Esther set Mori over the house of hmon yeah and Esther spake yet again before the king and fell down his feet and besought him with tears to put away the Mischief of hmon the aite and his device that he had devised against the Jews then the king held out the golden scepter toward Esther so Esther arose and stood before the king and said if it please the king and if I have found favor in his sight how many times has she said that she's reminding God right that she has done now if she wasn't hadn't done what she said she was do going to do she couldn't say that same way with you and I if our life don't line up you can't go up and say God I've done everything I can do if you haven't done everything you can do all right and she said if it please the king and if I have found favor in his sight and the things seem right before the king and I'll be pleasing in his eyes yeah let it be written to reverse the letters devised by hmon the son of hameda the agot which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces for How Can I Endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people now what happened is when he sent decree out the king couldn't take it back right but he can make a way right the king hey look this is full of condemnation if you take it the wrong way this is written the written word of God which will kill you right that's right right but there's Grace listen How Can I Endure to see the destruction of my Kindred then the king ofor said unto Esther the queen and to Mori behold I have given Esther the house of hmon and to him they have hanged upon the Galls because he laid his hand upon the Jews write ye also for the Jews as it liketh you in the king's name and seal it with the king's ring for the writing which is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's Ring May no man reverse exactly so it was all written it can't be reversed right all right but then were the king scribes called in at the time of the third month that was the month cvon and 3 and 20 days and it was written according all that Mori commanded to the Jews and to the lieutenants and the rulers of the provinces were from India to Ethiopia 127 provinces every Province the writings thereof and to every person of their language in other words what what is Mori doing he's giving them a chance right and that's where you see the story that God can't reverse his word but he can give you a chance what he done was is he gave them a chance to defend theel right amen he didn't disallow the law he actually sent the armies out God said my great Army I sent and Joel what to destroy but what he's doing is he's saying okay I'm going to make a way verse 10 and he wrote in the king of s's name and sealed it with the king's ring and sent letters and posts by horseback and Riders on mule camels and young dramedies wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life to destroy to slay and cause the perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them both little both little ones and women and take the spoil for a prey so what happened was all these copies went out and they knew the day he was coming they knew the day that they were going to destroy right the Israelites but all these posts came out and all these letters came out and they were able to bring their SEL together and to finish the story the Jews got together and wiped the other Army out right so there was the story of Esther petitioning or the only chance this world has is the bride amen the only chance this world's got is for that bride to petition to God and that's what we do as as being like Esther we come to a place to where we see that there is a message that we have amen that we can give to the people to defend ourself right none of the others could defend theirself none of the others could do anything except for the ones that had that letter that was published from Mori and Esther all right so then you're going to see that that later on in the story in the very last that Esther in verse 29 go all the way from to 9:29 and here's what happened to the whole story right here right there w then estra the Queen the daughter of Abigail and Mori the Jew wrote with all authority yeah exactly King's not anywhere to be seen you see that Esther the Queen the daughter of Abigail and Mori the je wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter which is the letter they sent of purum but you see what they've come to a position you don't see the king in that you see the messenger and you see the the bride amen God has given the authority to The Queen Esther and to Mori they wrote with all authority there was no looking back and look what verse 30 what happened look what they wrote with words of what peace and Truth yeah the whole story comes down to peace and Truth amen and you can see in chapter 10 verse two go to chapter 10 which is the last chapter verse two and all the acts of his power and then the king of sorus laid a tribute upon the land and upon the aisle and all the acts of his power and of his might and the Declaration of the greatness of Mori where unto the king Advanced him are they not written in the book of The Chronicles of the kings of media and Persia for Mori the Jew was next unto the king and great among the Jews and accepted of the multitude of his Brethren not just the Jews look at this seeking the wealth of his people people and speaking peace to all his seed amen it wasn't he wasn't seeking wealth to himself it says seeking the wealth of his people so here you have a story and there's a lot more into this that you can go into that for saving time we didn't but you see that Esther has come to a position to where she was given full Authority amen and she was the one that was speaking the peace and the TR truth and all authority was given to them to do whatever they needed to do in that Kingdom and I wrote in my Bible when I was reading this I wrote where's the king yeah he's in Esther right he's in Esther he's not anywhere else he's in Esther because to give to give somebody full Authority you've got they've got to have the same mind you got I wouldn't give authority to somebody that didn't have the same mind that I did so you come to the Book of Esther let's stand and we see a great group of people but you see that those were given to us for example to show us that we Glory as Esther can go before a king right and not change his mind he did she didn't change the king's mind the king's mind was made right but she came forward with an opportunity for her people to make it right at least Let Them Fight for their self and that's what you and I have done we've come to the time to where at least God at least at least give us the ability to fight and he has through a five-fold Ministry he gives us the ability to fight with right Esther man it's a great subject to look at and look into and and look at all the people's names but you know that wasn't in there just to fill up space right that was put in there to show you and I what a queen is supposed to really be like what a queen and but now not what just a queen is like but what a queen ex gets for being right right you understand what I'm saying what a queen gets for being right vashi was beautiful she was the wife but she done something wrong and God Cut Her Off God finished with those denominational churches and he said I want a bride that's true to me now there's not a time there's not a time that you see where Esther is not going have I found favor have I found favor in your sight do you hear that and she keeps reminding him have I not done these things have I not kept my word have I not kept your word and that's what God's waiting on you and I to do to where we can boldly walk up and he stick that Seer out and you walk up and talk to God face to face and you know what solve your problems cuz she had a problem she had a big problem she had a problem bigger than what most of our problems are she had a problem of her own kin folks being wiped out of her own family being wiped out and she made a petition she said if I perish I perish so she went in there with death on her mind you and I are walking into that part but I say today if I perish I perish but I'm walking into that line I'm walking into that place to where God can talk to me and I can talk to God and we can have a conversation and I can remind him of his promises and remind him that there was an Esther that saved the whole Jewish community and how that you and I right are exact example I mean they were example of us remember I preached a sermon where we're not a type anymore we're not a type everything's typing us cuz there's nothing for us to type everything types the bride so everything around the Bible and written is a type of me and you when you talk about literally turning somebody back that means literally not figuratively not a metaphor these are metaphors these are examples these are um what' you say what these are these are things that that are examples to you and I they're Parables we're not a parable that's right what are we a parable of the Bible is a parable of us cuz this talking to me and you Robie it's not talking to somebody else and when he got to where Esther was walking in there and Buddy when she put on what she was supposed to put on and he hadn't seen her in 30 days my when I don't see June for about 3 or 4 days I get all excited when she walks in the door so what about a god though they said hey I want to have communion with you amen you put on the right clothes so whatever you ask it doesn't matter right he didn't didn't put stipulation on it when he told her said whatever you ask I'll give it to you let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we pray Lord that what's been said today has been a little enlightening to the people and that they'll take it Lord and and when they hear the word Esther they'll think of redemption and they'll think of how that a a little girl stood in the gap for a group of people Lord and as we stand down here in the gap for for sinners in the in the world Lord that the only thing that they're going to see the only they're going to see is you is you through us and now we see that you were working through Esther and you were working through Mori and you were working through all the things that were going on on this in this story but Lord let's not make it a story let's make it a reality where the ends of the world have come upon a group of people that are not examples Lord that's what Esther was talking about that's what the whole Bible was talking was pointing toward here pointing toward a little bride in the end time that would take your word and put on the Garment and do the right things and not be ashamed Esther was never ashamed to go before you Lord she was never ashamed to go before that King cuz she knew she had done things right and we pray Lord that you would take the as we say the players of the the mamans and the hag guys and the moris and all the the players and the acts of the play that you would put them around us Lord that will help us that will help us be our support group that will help us Lord to be closer to you father cuz they were the ones that that little Esther listened to and was able to get in front of the king Lord we want you to be our King we want you to be our husband we want you to be our lover we want you to be the one that you can't take your eyes off of but Lord we've got to live right and do right and act right before that'll happen I pray that that'll happen today Lord yes Lord that if anybody has anything in their heart Lord or anything about them Lord I pray myself that you'd forgive me of my sins Lord forgive me of my actions and my thoughts wrong thoughts toward others that you'll forgive me of the things that I do that are not pleasing to you so that when I need something from you Lord when I have to get up in the middle of the night and make a petition for someone else Lord that there won't be anything in the way that I'll have on the right garment that we all as a congregation will have on the right garment that we'll know what to to do when we present oursel to you Lord when we present our for our children our family our husband our wife our sickness our the things that we need Lord we we need to get these things out of the way so that we can come boldly to the throne of grace where we can come to you father and know that you'll give us that petition not just not just hoping but that knowing Lord that we've done the right thing on our side and that you definitely always do the right thing on your side we pray that you'd sanctify us now for this journey sanctify us now for the communion that's coming up Lord bless brother as he ministers over the communion Lord thank you for raising up these young ones Lord that are coming and and preaching the gospel and and being deacons and elders and helping in the church Lord we pray that that you would just sanctify them and clean us all up and get us ready for this for this last push this last this last moment this last moment of time that we're heading toward you Lord and when you stick out that scepter and say Well done my good and faithful servant yes Lord enter into the joy of the Lord that's been waiting for you since the foundation of the world we thank you for that Lord we ask your blessings on the people now in Jesus name amen let's sing he is here just for a moment let brother Bob come if you have a need he is here hallelujah he is hereen he is here holy holy
