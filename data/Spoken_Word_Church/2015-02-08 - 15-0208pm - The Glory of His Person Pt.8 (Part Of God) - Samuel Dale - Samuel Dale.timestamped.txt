[1:03] by heart it'll be through by the time
[1:05] brother Dale comes
[1:07] um
[1:16] not changing
[1:20] to give us so many blessings
[1:44] to give us so many blessings undeserving
[1:49] that's what we are
[1:53] thinking
[1:57] a little more today
[2:07] amen
[2:11] amen
[2:12] Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord
[2:27] I want to see you
[2:31] foreign
[3:09] holy holy holy holy
[3:18] shining in the light of your glory
[3:23] pour out your power in love as we sing
[3:49] I want to see you
[3:55] seated for one minute I got about a five
[3:57] minute testimony I just want to share
[3:59] with you
[4:01] I can't think of a better time
[4:04] for a test for without a test you cannot
[4:06] have a testimony then the study of the
[4:08] stature the perfect man
[4:12] and I want to ask you a question and
[4:14] just think about this I'm gonna
[4:15] be kind of broad but I'm gonna bring
[4:17] very simple
[4:18] where were you setting when you were 15
[4:20] years old
[4:24] just think about this
[4:26] and think about a journey
[4:28] 15 years old
[4:31] my father had built a company
[4:34] a plant from the ground up he'd lost his
[4:36] job
[4:38] he went out
[4:40] about a million and a half dollars
[4:43] built a plant
[4:46] and
[4:48] made
[4:49] the 1967 air conditioner pulley for Ford
[4:54] Motor Company
[4:57] and that went on for a couple years
[4:58] until the guy that loaned him the money
[5:01] died in an airplane crash
[5:03] it devastated my father
[5:07] I grew up
[5:08] Two Cadillacs in the garage a Jaguar I
[5:12] mean life has always been good I've
[5:13] always been blessed but that was on the
[5:15] material side before I ever heard the
[5:17] word amen so I've been at the highest
[5:20] high and I've been at the lowest low
[5:24] I've been in a place at 18 years old
[5:26] when our family split
[5:29] my father said leave
[5:31] my mother my brother and my sister
[5:34] walked out of a house down a highway
[5:36] no place to lay our head
[5:42] but you know
[5:44] that was my journey
[5:48] built some character
[5:54] but I just want to share with you a
[5:56] couple things that's happened as you
[5:57] most of you might know I lost my job
[5:59] last Friday
[6:01] because I I really believe it's because
[6:03] for what I stood for what I believed in
[6:08] I'd been asked to terminate four people
[6:11] and I couldn't justify it
[6:14] so time went on
[6:17] so every dog has his day as they say
[6:22] so I just turn around and walk away but
[6:23] I've never been without a job more than
[6:25] a weekend that that happened on Friday
[6:30] I was getting calls Monday morning
[6:32] people shocked that I lost my job
[6:36] they were no better more shocked than I
[6:38] was trust me
[6:40] have you ever been hit in the face with
[6:41] a shovel you could just imagine what it
[6:43] feels like when you're totally
[6:45] unexpected when a man now listen man's
[6:48] word comes to you
[6:51] every day for six years or once a week
[6:54] at least and says you're never going to
[6:55] leave me are you you're never going to
[6:58] retire you'll have a job here as long as
[7:00] you want
[7:02] and you put Faith in what that man tells
[7:04] you
[7:05] there's a lot of employees listening in
[7:07] today
[7:08] I invited him to hear the word and how
[7:11] the Lord has worked in their lives and
[7:13] they never recognized what he was doing
[7:18] maybe they're watching maybe they're not
[7:21] but there my boss would call me and he'd
[7:24] say I need you to pray for me
[7:26] in situations and I would pray for him
[7:29] and things would happen
[7:31] there's a young man out there that I
[7:33] believe has taken my place last I heard
[7:35] last night
[7:37] that was a citizen or tried to become a
[7:40] citizen he was from another country
[7:43] he had a little problem in his
[7:44] background as a young man before he
[7:47] really became at the age of
[7:49] 18 years old
[7:52] it stopped him from becoming a citizen
[7:55] they came to me asked me to pray
[8:04] I wrote letters to the governor because
[8:06] I know a lot of people throughout the
[8:08] state and to our home school stands what
[8:12] we went through and met a lot of people
[8:15] well you know this problem this young
[8:17] man had in his background mysteriously
[8:19] went away
[8:21] now it's not mysterious how it went away
[8:23] I know how it went away
[8:27] okay
[8:28] there was an engineer that came to me
[8:30] and he asked me
[8:31] I said something in the email and I
[8:33] prayed and mentioned something he kind
[8:35] of made light of it laughed about it
[8:39] three weeks later his house burnt
[8:43] but he they restored it and he's back in
[8:45] it
[8:46] I'm just trying to tell you some things
[8:48] that happened on the job
[8:50] and funny thing about this job that I
[8:52] just have left
[8:54] I was working for a gentleman I helped
[8:56] him start a company and he's actually
[8:57] building a new plant right now but he
[9:00] was uh I was standing there been there
[9:02] five years with him just working minding
[9:04] my own business
[9:05] yeah being a good employee and one day I
[9:07] asked the Lord I said Lord
[9:08] If It Be Your Will I change jobs Give Me
[9:10] A Sign 30 minutes I hadn't looked for a
[9:13] job in five years 30 minutes my phone
[9:16] rings takes me to this job that I just
[9:18] left
[9:21] so with that said faith
[9:26] in the study of the statute perfect man
[9:28] is what's made me strong
[9:30] amen
[9:32] it's funny and we're studying if you
[9:34] have a book extra book about what does
[9:36] the Holy Spirit it was the Holy Spirit
[9:38] given for we should bring it to us to
[9:40] use in our Sunday school class because
[9:42] the students and I and kids were
[9:45] studying beginning that study what is
[9:47] the Holy Spirit
[9:49] and I often tell them I said you Watch
[9:51] What Happens downstairs here and when
[9:54] you go upstairs and tell me if you don't
[9:55] see the Holy Spirit working
[9:57] well today
[10:01] I didn't prepare as well as I should
[10:03] have but the Lord laid on my heart to
[10:05] read John 1.
[10:07] we talked about John 1 all the way
[10:09] through it
[10:11] and what happened
[10:12] we come up here brother Dale reads it
[10:16] Josiah looks at me and he goes
[10:20] because I tell him I said you watch
[10:21] where the holy spirit's working amen
[10:25] okay
[10:27] and then just a couple weeks ago I told
[10:29] Jan I said you know I wish I had some
[10:31] way that I could be with you all the
[10:32] time
[10:34] well I had a boss tell me one time he
[10:36] said be careful for what you wish for
[10:39] you might get it so they might think
[10:42] that they terminated me but I believe or
[10:44] we separated whatever but I just believe
[10:46] that the Lord's worked in a way for me
[10:49] to be around how and Audrey and help
[10:51] them at the time of need of things going
[10:53] on we got so much things to do he's
[10:56] prepared us a way to step back
[10:58] I sat down and I was wanting somebody to
[11:00] read the chapter Isaiah 2 before I
[11:02] started my testimony this morning
[11:04] because of what talked about the silver
[11:05] and the gold and all the things in it
[11:07] but just read that when you leave here
[11:10] sometime and just see how he dismissed
[11:12] yourself laid that on the heart when I
[11:14] sat down this morning open my bible
[11:17] but I've laid hands on equipment I've
[11:19] laid hands on
[11:22] stuff at work and it's just amazing the
[11:25] problems went away and things went to
[11:26] running
[11:27] when I started with that company six
[11:29] years ago they hadn't made a profit in
[11:31] five years
[11:33] and tell you how the Lord's blessed what
[11:35] we did and it took every one of us is
[11:37] not what I did but it's what he did
[11:39] and they need to realize that's what he
[11:41] did because another reason why I'm being
[11:44] probably parted with a company is they
[11:46] have to the plant business plan has
[11:48] changed where they have to recover
[11:51] before anything happens they have to
[11:53] recover a hundred and forty thousand
[11:54] dollar negative to the month
[11:57] then your expenses started I had a
[11:59] budget about forty thousand dollars a
[12:00] month so they had to recover that much
[12:02] money every month just to make their
[12:04] profit line
[12:06] last two three four five years they
[12:09] would come to me and say they're sixty
[12:11] thousand dollars you need to spend it
[12:12] this month there's fifty thousand
[12:14] dollars extra you need to spend it this
[12:16] month
[12:17] today they've got to recover a hundred
[12:20] and forty thousand dollars starting
[12:21] January one
[12:23] to even get back to where they were at
[12:26] so my work was finished there
[12:28] I shared with the Lord they called me a
[12:30] man of the cloth a preacher all that I
[12:33] never walked around talking about the
[12:35] Lord unless somebody asked me
[12:38] right I never forced it on them
[12:42] and that's what I'm trying to tell my
[12:43] children in Sunday school just
[12:46] take on the son of man Ministry make the
[12:49] word come alive in the flesh
[12:51] that's what the message is
[12:54] amen
[12:57] but all of this is about building
[12:59] character
[13:01] amen
[13:03] I stand proud with a clear conscience
[13:06] that I have served and owe nothing and I
[13:10] thank you all for your prayers and
[13:12] continue to pray for me amen
[13:25] amen let's Stand Together somebody left
[13:29] some glasses in their keys downstairs
[13:32] laying on a table
[13:34] uh okay here Richard take them back
[13:39] they just somebody walked by and found
[13:40] them laying there and didn't want to
[13:41] leave them out in the open
[13:43] you know you know but uh
[13:46] you know you followed the Lord he'll
[13:47] take care of you
[13:49] sister Johnny I used to talk to her a
[13:51] lot on the telephone when she was up in
[13:52] New York
[13:54] and uh it took a long time for it to get
[13:57] through to her what was going on
[14:01] because they would get ready to shut
[14:03] down certain things of what she was
[14:05] doing and
[14:06] you know just right before they'd shut
[14:08] it down they'd move her out of that
[14:10] department into another
[14:12] and she'd come tell me she said they
[14:15] just moved me out
[14:17] well three months later they just moved
[14:20] me out one day I said Do You Realize
[14:21] what's taking place
[14:24] he said well I believe the Lord lead me
[14:27] you know she wound up being up under and
[14:30] I even knew the the lady that was the
[14:33] CEO or whatever Don Lowe's you and she
[14:37] would you know right up under her
[14:39] and then they finally shut down
[14:41] everything
[14:42] you know and she gets to retire
[14:45] well sometimes you know the Lord's
[14:47] working things out so just go along with
[14:51] it and wait to see what he's doing he
[14:53] might work it out in the right way the
[14:56] boy said he'd done receive three phone
[14:59] calls about a job
[15:01] well Lord will take care of it
[15:03] he always has he's never left it you
[15:06] know where that he doesn't lead all
[15:08] right think of these things amen
[15:12] if you'd like turning your scriptures
[15:13] turn where we'll read in Revelations one
[15:17] and then we'll go to Philippians
[15:20] 2.
[15:22] try to continue our thought on from this
[15:25] morning
[15:27] so we'll
[15:28] it I thought it was a good time maybe to
[15:30] do a little background catch up to where
[15:33] we're at and just preach a little bit
[15:34] you know and then we can move on all
[15:37] right so remember these remember waiting
[15:39] them on the way in home this afternoon
[15:40] and pray that the Lord would bless and
[15:43] take care
[15:45] Heavenly Father we thank you for
[15:47] everything we love you and we carry Lord
[15:49] for what you are Desiring to do among us
[15:52] we care very heavily about it because we
[15:55] want to do that
[15:56] and we know and realize that there's
[15:58] none of us worth anything so we just
[16:00] leave it all aside and say thank you
[16:02] Lord you're taking care of it now you
[16:05] always will and we believe you these are
[16:08] just little tests and trials down here
[16:10] in life that we lord have to put up with
[16:13] but they're great trials for a day
[16:15] coming when things maybe get worse and
[16:18] and all like that but we don't look
[16:20] forward to those things but we do know
[16:22] that they will be coming because it has
[16:25] been said and so let it be Lord but yet
[16:28] give us Grace when it comes to those
[16:31] times and the hour that is needed we
[16:34] just ask you now to open our eyes to the
[16:37] word that we're trying to speak about
[16:40] and father forgive me when I'm I try to
[16:43] get so hard to try to get people to
[16:45] believe that I know sometimes I turn
[16:48] people off and they're thinking
[16:50] but I'm just trying and you you know
[16:53] that
[16:54] and father we just pray that you'd bless
[16:56] and guide each one we were waiting them
[16:57] on the way home and father this
[16:59] afternoon him ministering be with him
[17:02] and Lord bless and God each and every
[17:03] one of us remember the sick remember
[17:06] Brother Gary there Lord we know that his
[17:08] foot's busted open and a lot of problems
[17:11] with it and we pray that you would just
[17:13] reach down and touch him and deliver him
[17:16] from that because we believe you have
[17:18] your way now as we read your words you
[17:20] come on the scene to speak to our hearts
[17:22] in Jesus name
[17:24] amen
[17:30] verse 10 Revelations 1 I was in the
[17:32] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[17:34] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[17:36] saying I am Alpha and Omega
[17:39] the first and the last and what thou
[17:41] seeest right in a book and send it unto
[17:43] the seven churches which are in Asia
[17:45] unto Ephesus and under Smyrna and unto
[17:48] pergamus and into titira and under
[17:51] Sardis and under Philadelphia and
[17:54] underlay you see him and I turned to see
[17:56] the voice that spoke with me and being
[17:57] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[17:59] and one in the midst of the seven
[18:01] candlesticks
[18:03] and in the midst of the seven
[18:04] Candlestick one like unto the son of man
[18:06] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[18:08] and gird about the pouch with a golden
[18:11] girdle all right let's go over to
[18:15] Philippians to try to pick up our
[18:17] thought from this morning
[18:19] and maybe move on into
[18:22] some things
[18:25] verse five let this mind be in you
[18:30] which was also in Christ Jesus
[18:35] who being now that's not your brain
[18:36] that's not your brain mind
[18:40] that is the Holy Spirit
[18:43] to dwell in your heart
[18:45] to give you understanding all right who
[18:50] being in the form of God told it not
[18:53] robbery to be equal with God
[18:56] but made himself of no reputation and
[18:59] took upon him the form of a servant was
[19:01] made into the likeness of men and been
[19:03] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[19:06] himself and became obedient unto death
[19:09] even the death of the Cross you may be
[19:12] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[19:15] reading of the word
[19:18] now
[19:20] to try to move pretty fast through
[19:23] our background point
[19:26] remember that we have been talking about
[19:29] the condescending of God
[19:33] we'll give a couple of quotes in a
[19:34] minute and I hope you listen looked on
[19:36] your computer and just write in
[19:38] condescend or condescending you'll find
[19:40] out brother random covered a lot on that
[19:43] and you think that I'm trying to drag
[19:45] this thing out I'm trying my best to
[19:48] shorten it and even like this afternoon
[19:50] I want to pack three messages into one
[19:54] okay so if I take a few extra minutes
[19:56] forgive me
[19:58] and just bear with me because I want to
[20:00] talk about you know uh
[20:04] how that God
[20:07] can come down
[20:09] and reveal himself
[20:13] to a mortal being
[20:15] now that's that's uh that's something
[20:18] isn't it amen and I believe that
[20:21] and we've been talking about you know
[20:23] that
[20:24] and go ahead brother if you will pull up
[20:26] the uh
[20:27] the little drawing
[20:29] with the attributes written on it and
[20:32] we've been talking about that
[20:35] how that brother Branham would say in
[20:36] the beginning but before the eternal
[20:39] and then you say in the beginning was
[20:40] the word and when time began it was word
[20:44] but before it was word it was attribute
[20:47] or thought
[20:49] all right then we made a little drawing
[20:52] just something to help you to understand
[20:53] and we place the word Eternal in the
[20:56] middle and we back up onto this side to
[20:59] say before the Eternal which is just an
[21:02] expression a way of saying that you say
[21:05] yeah but there's nothing before well
[21:07] that's where you're not listening you
[21:09] you know you need to go back and listen
[21:11] to the other day when I was trying my
[21:13] best to express that we have really made
[21:17] it something by saying eternal
[21:20] you know because that put it into a
[21:23] position that has no beginning or no
[21:25] ending how can you bring a word that
[21:27] would would say anything
[21:30] that is the best word that could be
[21:32] thought of
[21:33] so then it's placed there as Eternal all
[21:37] right
[21:37] but back before that Eternal part could
[21:40] be is to me to me the prophet is trying
[21:43] to explain
[21:45] how that way back in eternities back
[21:48] here in eternities you remember on
[21:51] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[21:53] said let's go in the back part of God's
[21:55] mind so you keep on going on back
[21:58] you know going this way and uh in doing
[22:02] it we can see those things as they're
[22:05] there
[22:06] all right and then we we know for Surety
[22:10] that the word creation
[22:14] in God's terminologies doesn't deal with
[22:16] creation like we do because the prophet
[22:19] went on one day to say that the first
[22:22] creation was God himself
[22:26] your mind goes like that because there's
[22:28] no way to comprehend that it has to be
[22:31] revealed and by thinking about it then
[22:35] it's really just him in his ways of
[22:39] trying to express it
[22:41] to work would give us some idea
[22:44] or a thought you know that we could be
[22:46] able to to comprehend
[22:49] that there was a time that there was
[22:52] nothing
[22:53] as far as we think
[22:54] well now watch what I'm saying now this
[22:56] is a direct quote right a time there was
[22:58] nothing but remember God was there
[23:02] so he's not meaning there was a time
[23:03] there was no God
[23:05] that could be a thought as well as
[23:07] anything else if you're just going to
[23:09] deal with it on that way you know
[23:12] there was a time that there was nothing
[23:15] like we have here existences and
[23:19] different things but there was never a
[23:21] time that there wasn't God
[23:23] if it is you had him beginning
[23:26] you know well if you have him beginning
[23:28] then he's just like us
[23:31] and who created who that's what I've
[23:33] always said about the the Trinity people
[23:35] you know who created who did the father
[23:37] create the Son and the son create the
[23:39] Holy Ghost and you know that's
[23:42] that's beyond all comprehension of the
[23:45] human mind
[23:47] but we try to do it all right
[23:51] but now remember we talked about
[23:53] each attribute
[23:56] and looking at those attributes spread
[23:58] around them said that so in his great
[24:00] mind he wanted these attributes to be
[24:04] expressed in him was love in him was to
[24:07] be father and him was to be son and him
[24:09] was to be Savior and him was to be
[24:12] healer and these attributes that we see
[24:14] already expressed they were in him I
[24:19] remember this morning I said we look at
[24:21] it as we think that what it is is just
[24:24] they're just a possibility
[24:27] for something to be able to go over that
[24:29] away
[24:30] no
[24:31] they were already there he said but but
[24:33] there were nothing lost
[24:39] let me ask you a simple question
[24:43] did being blocks make him a savior
[24:51] now being lost is an attribute upon
[24:54] Earth
[24:56] it didn't make him a savior
[24:59] it made him display
[25:01] the point of a savior
[25:04] because if not then some were he had to
[25:07] develop the Savior point
[25:10] right
[25:12] and remember what I said this morning
[25:13] then we think that he just had these
[25:15] abilities but there was nothing there
[25:17] well all of the quotes from The Prophet
[25:19] is we'll read will say that they were
[25:21] already there
[25:23] all right now I wish you would look at
[25:26] that drawing for one thing
[25:30] and then you can see what we're trying
[25:32] to talk about and was this morning about
[25:35] and we'll be spending a lot this
[25:36] afternoon about God not changing and but
[25:40] only thing he changed is changing his
[25:42] form
[25:43] and then trying to tie attributes with
[25:46] him and with it and going into part of
[25:49] God
[25:50] and uh
[25:52] look at the drawing
[25:54] and think
[25:57] now he didn't develop
[25:59] father
[26:01] I mean he he didn't become father he
[26:04] brought it into being
[26:05] right through it already watched father
[26:09] now look at each one of those
[26:11] individually
[26:14] is
[26:18] that of manifestation of God
[26:22] father
[26:24] his son of manifestation of God
[26:28] it's logos
[26:30] speech of manifestation of God a savior
[26:33] of manifestation of God
[26:37] is healer theophany Christ
[26:40] is the word of manifestation of God
[26:43] then you realize that you can't take out
[26:45] any one of those
[26:48] because you're taking away
[26:50] from God
[26:52] but he realized each one of them is God
[26:55] in another form
[26:58] right
[27:01] now that should become simple
[27:04] is God in another form but if you take
[27:06] out one of them what have you got
[27:09] you're taking away from his
[27:11] form
[27:13] look at that as each one a form of God
[27:16] then you can look at Father Son and Holy
[27:18] Ghost the prophet would say the three
[27:20] attributes of God his father Son and
[27:22] Holy Ghost take away one of those any
[27:24] one of them and you don't have the full
[27:26] truth do you
[27:30] so if you do away with any form of God
[27:33] anywhere here or thereafter or before
[27:36] whatever
[27:37] if you do away with any form of God
[27:39] you've really you've gone into worse
[27:42] than trinitarianism or or the one that's
[27:45] concept
[27:46] you've gone into what the scripture says
[27:48] that if you take away what do you say
[27:51] you take away you
[27:54] right see just look at it just simply
[27:56] look at it and think about it
[27:59] each one of those is a form of God
[28:03] you say well how do you know because
[28:04] they have come over to hear and been
[28:07] displayed down through time
[28:11] right
[28:12] and that's the point I want you to get
[28:14] is looking at it as we know the prophet
[28:17] would give the words you know of in
[28:19] morphe
[28:20] God changing his form
[28:24] all right
[28:26] see then if once he does away with one
[28:28] fault in other words move from one form
[28:29] to the other he doesn't do away with
[28:32] that form
[28:34] it wouldn't matter if I lived to be 150
[28:36] years old I wouldn't do away with the
[28:39] fact of being
[28:40] husband
[28:43] father
[28:44] grandfather
[28:46] great grandfather
[28:48] you keep adding instead of doing away
[28:53] you know unfolding as things come into
[28:56] being but now watch that just take that
[28:59] thought
[29:02] and think about it see we we want to get
[29:05] to a point where I just can't quite
[29:07] understand
[29:09] but why not do as he said they are from
[29:11] Christ the mystery and all these great
[29:14] attributes that we see already expressed
[29:16] they were in God
[29:21] all right
[29:22] so we never gained an attribute
[29:25] investment he says
[29:29] were the Great attributes of God where
[29:32] he will before he was for he even was
[29:36] God
[29:37] before there was God is an object of
[29:40] worship
[29:41] before he even become that
[29:44] he was still God he is the Eternal and
[29:48] these attributes was in him
[29:51] and they just display themselves
[29:56] it was in him
[29:58] now I want to drive that hard because if
[30:01] you can't see that those attributes was
[30:03] in him then you can't follow anything of
[30:07] coming on over and display on those
[30:08] attributes because you're going to be
[30:11] adding taken away Etc and it will not
[30:14] work
[30:15] God's provided approach
[30:18] I'm just quoting these to where we get
[30:20] to it and then we'll start reading in a
[30:22] minute
[30:23] now these attributes was in him so that
[30:27] may so that made it display something to
[30:31] worship the first thing he made was
[30:33] Angelic beings
[30:36] attributes
[30:37] he had attributes to be sun and
[30:40] attributes to be
[30:41] savior
[30:43] in him was the attributes of healer
[30:46] attributes to be God
[30:49] see that's back before he ever brings
[30:52] anything into being
[30:55] that would be a worship part or would be
[30:59] healing that would do you can't make an
[31:01] eternal healing I mean an eternal
[31:03] sickness
[31:05] all right so we know there was a time
[31:07] sickness started
[31:09] but there was never a time that God
[31:12] started
[31:14] it's only the basis that you're dealing
[31:16] with he's made Angelic beings and they
[31:19] worship him now we've come up into the
[31:21] understanding of the word God but he
[31:24] always was God
[31:26] well I can't understand that well that's
[31:28] what I say you need to pray
[31:32] because I I can't explain it and if
[31:35] you're profiting me reading it to you
[31:38] from what he says
[31:41] that can't explain it either
[31:43] it takes a revelation
[31:46] right
[31:48] I can do the best I can of simplifying
[31:50] it the prophet done the best I believe
[31:53] he could do or simplifying it
[31:57] but yet our minds are still connected
[32:00] back to that
[32:03] link of seeing things
[32:06] but remember how I tried to explain it
[32:09] right
[32:12] this attribute of father
[32:15] well you know one day he was displayed
[32:19] the attribute of sun one day was
[32:22] displayed
[32:24] because that's the condescending of God
[32:27] to bring it to where we can see those
[32:29] signs
[32:31] all right
[32:32] and see we know there couldn't be a uh
[32:35] you know which came first
[32:39] brother Louise is getting him our
[32:41] Wednesday about it the which one came
[32:43] first the chicken or the egg and uh the
[32:47] you know we believe the chicken came
[32:49] first because it was created he didn't
[32:50] create eggs and let him hatch all right
[32:53] well see which came first sickness or
[32:57] savior
[32:59] did he become a savior because it was
[33:01] sickness
[33:03] no
[33:05] he was a savior so thereby we know
[33:09] before the world and I hope you're
[33:11] listening to what I'm trying to drive
[33:14] that before the world
[33:17] he knew what he was going to do
[33:19] you agree with that he knew he was going
[33:24] to create man
[33:25] he knew if he created man he would go
[33:29] wrong do you need those quotes they are
[33:31] there in the prophet's message so you
[33:33] ought to know it
[33:35] but which came first sickness
[33:38] or healer
[33:40] the Healer was already there or the
[33:42] sickness wouldn't come
[33:44] right see we we want to make it that the
[33:46] sickness would come then he becomes a
[33:48] Healer you've made him change
[33:52] and see you're not listening to the
[33:55] thought because of what I said here each
[33:58] one of those could be isolated by itself
[34:02] and make him a father
[34:05] it could be isolated by a sun
[34:08] but each one of those is God made
[34:11] manifest
[34:15] now where do we get to it had a while in
[34:17] the message and we'll be reading where
[34:18] brother random said that he didn't send
[34:20] a son
[34:24] he said he came himself
[34:28] well all right let's start off right
[34:33] let's start off right he came himself
[34:38] see like I said who could talk like a
[34:40] prophet
[34:42] he said now our English word
[34:46] I can't remember what it is in there but
[34:48] he has like vomit and dime
[34:51] he said but that's not right with God
[34:54] he said but a part of God went out
[35:00] part of God
[35:06] you said that ain't even sensible
[35:11] I agree with you
[35:13] but it's truth
[35:16] he said not an arm went off
[35:21] now one of these days you're going to be
[35:23] able to understand and catch it then
[35:26] you'll see that why I believe
[35:30] when he comes here all God was poured
[35:33] into Christ
[35:36] now I'm going to say it so you go ahead
[35:38] and laugh and differ with it that's a
[35:41] part of God
[35:47] but let's go on over
[35:49] and all Christ was he poured into the
[35:51] church
[35:53] that's a part of God
[35:58] see that requires thinking
[36:01] it requires revelation
[36:04] it requires us to get rid of our
[36:06] mentalities of what we think is right
[36:08] and believe God's word
[36:11] well I don't understand you really
[36:13] confused me I didn't confuse you I just
[36:17] made known you're confusing
[36:21] then you get mad at me Paul said if I
[36:23] become your enemy because I tell you the
[36:24] truth
[36:27] all right see then we say what the
[36:30] prophet said unto everybody why don't
[36:31] you say what the prophet said well I
[36:34] want to hear you
[36:35] women or who
[36:38] Wade finishes this series I'll even give
[36:41] you your dear sisters a week or two to
[36:44] explain one God
[36:46] some other way than what I've tried my
[36:48] best for 50 years to express to you
[36:53] but remember I'm going to do you like a
[36:56] man at work one time
[36:59] he differed with me about the godhead
[37:01] and I said okay now what I'm going to do
[37:03] I'm going to stand here and listen to
[37:05] you and I want you to start explaining
[37:07] your great revelation
[37:11] I said but now remember you've been
[37:14] fussing with me
[37:16] you know everything I said no that ain't
[37:18] right no it's got to be this one I said
[37:20] you've been doing that with me so now
[37:21] for a minute I'm going to change the
[37:24] story around a little bit and I want you
[37:26] to start explaining your great
[37:27] Revelation but I said when you come to a
[37:30] point that you're off the word I'm gonna
[37:31] raise my hand and say hold it you're out
[37:33] of the word
[37:35] I said you agree with me he said yeah he
[37:37] said two words I write my hand
[37:41] that's no joke
[37:44] because he's already went off the word
[37:48] but you see then to me then see I'm
[37:51] called a smart alec
[37:53] on intellect because of doing that
[37:56] well if it's
[37:59] I thought God could work in any way he
[38:01] wanted to
[38:02] I thought he could use a Dom donkey to
[38:04] bring the truth
[38:06] all right it don't give you no right to
[38:08] reject it don't matter who it's brought
[38:09] by
[38:11] you dealing with God you're not dealing
[38:13] with with man
[38:15] what do you understand what I'm getting
[38:16] at
[38:19] when he displayed himself
[38:23] as father
[38:24] that was an attribute or form of God
[38:30] all right now each one of these is God
[38:34] that can be made manifest
[38:38] right
[38:39] simple
[38:41] does it make that many gods
[38:46] no it makes a guard it can be made
[38:48] manifest
[38:50] so remember we're not looking at a first
[38:53] person sinning the second person that
[38:55] needed a third person to get it to you
[38:58] brother Branham said he's not even do
[39:01] you want this quote I may have it in
[39:03] here but if I he said he's not even the
[39:06] first person
[39:07] that's right you remember that he said
[39:09] he is the person
[39:12] because see if you made him the first
[39:14] person that would mean his ability to be
[39:15] doing more persons
[39:17] but when he's the only person
[39:20] there's no ability to change anything
[39:24] was to me you you call me a smarter
[39:28] looking hard but you listen to him I
[39:30] ain't never got around to saying that so
[39:32] that Doctrine y'all got his soul shallow
[39:35] that you you know
[39:37] look it off a shot of a chicken and
[39:39] starve to death
[39:41] you know but everybody said home run
[39:43] around love me yeah okay he did
[39:47] or he wouldn't have said it that away
[39:49] all right but do you understand now
[39:53] these attributes was in him
[39:56] before anything developed
[40:01] of any form
[40:02] they were in him
[40:05] now then
[40:07] maybe you'll realize one of these days
[40:09] why I believe God is real
[40:12] and why did I believe that he's a being
[40:14] and that's what I've been hammering
[40:16] about
[40:18] I don't believe it before the world back
[40:21] over here in the eternities that he was
[40:23] just a glob of iron floating around
[40:24] because it wasn't nowhere
[40:26] that's what your Prophet said now go
[40:28] ahead and argue
[40:29] he said before I or anything Adam from
[40:32] all the cues
[40:37] right
[40:39] you know it might have been a beautiful
[40:40] place
[40:42] that he lived in
[40:47] yeah but you're just making him too real
[40:50] I wish I could drive it so hard to let
[40:53] you to see how real he is
[40:55] anything you think is real remember he
[40:57] created it
[41:00] and how can the thing that created it
[41:02] be lower than what is created
[41:09] you know that this is a plain language
[41:12] he could sit back before the world
[41:16] before anything
[41:20] and he could think about all of the
[41:22] things that was going to relate to
[41:23] father
[41:28] he could think about all the things he
[41:29] was going to relate to son
[41:33] he could think of all the things he'd
[41:35] relate to healer savior
[41:38] the theophany the Christ the low gospel
[41:40] we think are beautiful words that we
[41:42] really think makes us something because
[41:43] we say them
[41:50] what do you think about before this
[41:52] world ever got started in any form
[41:58] I remember I vote and I believe it
[42:01] that's more real than what this is yes
[42:07] you mean brother the hell do you think
[42:09] that that back to her that God could
[42:11] have been up there doing that now I'm
[42:12] not exactly with the Thor and the thus
[42:15] ideas
[42:16] okay your kids would understand more
[42:18] than adults maybe but you know they say
[42:19] thunder is is Thor or Zeus one throwing
[42:22] rolling balls through the heavens and
[42:24] they're running into the clouds and boom
[42:26] boom boom you know
[42:29] no not exactly that way
[42:33] I just believe he was real
[42:36] you know what I believe he's real
[42:37] because I believe he's real now
[42:40] whatever remember that comes over here
[42:43] had to be over here
[42:46] what do you believe that there could
[42:47] have been another world before this
[42:49] world no
[42:51] glad you thought of that
[42:53] no I don't
[42:56] because when we use the word word world
[42:59] we look at this form of what we have
[43:05] right
[43:06] when the word world means Cosmos or
[43:09] World Order
[43:15] why do you think they would come up with
[43:17] it and I'm not saying this to get any
[43:19] point of making a point they would make
[43:21] a movie in things and call them Superman
[43:24] that he come from this planet of Krypton
[43:28] no I'm not talking about nothing like
[43:29] that because remember if it comes from a
[43:31] planet then it couldn't have been
[43:32] created until this went over here and
[43:34] created it so get that out garbage out
[43:36] get the point
[43:42] brother Reynolds said he was a super
[43:45] being
[43:48] so that would mean Super intelligence
[43:52] right
[43:56] just use those things as words
[44:00] to express how real that I believe God
[44:02] is
[44:05] and he had all them attributes in him
[44:08] well he could sit there about two
[44:09] million years and think about how he was
[44:11] going to
[44:12] be a father
[44:19] and he's going to display and be a
[44:21] savior
[44:24] I was going to be a Healer
[44:28] they wouldn't have to have two million
[44:29] years but that's what I'm what I'm
[44:31] pulling is
[44:32] the point is to try to get you to look
[44:33] at something simple
[44:35] if it took two seconds he still was
[44:38] thinking
[44:40] and am I right that he thought that when
[44:43] he made man that man would fall is that
[44:46] true
[44:47] he knew we would fall
[44:49] so he must have thought it over
[44:53] right
[44:55] well that makes it more real than what
[44:56] we are
[44:58] that's attributes
[45:01] in any of those attributes that you deal
[45:03] with he could have set millions of years
[45:05] and thought about how to do
[45:12] you said word brother Dale in heaven
[45:18] that's the only words we got isn't it
[45:20] then we got heavens of heavens of you
[45:23] know
[45:26] but that's the word we use signifying
[45:28] another place above this one
[45:30] or something you know existence
[45:35] all right
[45:37] might as well get out of that and just
[45:39] go on and forget it
[45:41] because if you can't see it
[45:43] by that then I don't know what else I
[45:46] could say
[45:48] and remember one thing
[45:51] Hebrews 13 8 said he's the same
[45:54] yesterday today and forever
[45:57] so whatever was here has got to be here
[46:00] whatever here's got to be there
[46:02] no additions or Hebrews 13 8 would be
[46:05] wrong
[46:06] all right then so would it be wrong in
[46:10] um Malachi 3 and 6 I believe where he
[46:13] said I'm God and I change not right
[46:16] all right
[46:17] so let's just run through a little bit
[46:19] of what the prophet had to say
[46:23] watch it real carefully then in a minute
[46:25] we'll start reading on the message of
[46:27] the unveiling of God paragraph 88 he
[46:29] says
[46:31] down Through the Ages the same word
[46:35] so he did not change his nature when he
[46:38] come he is always that Prophet he's even
[46:41] talking about that part all down to the
[46:43] age
[46:44] same thing the word the word the word
[46:46] the word see he cannot change his nature
[46:51] but he changed his form
[46:55] Hebrews 13 8 he's the same yesterday
[46:57] today forever he just changed his mask
[47:04] all right see then if that's what it is
[47:09] then
[47:11] why are we concerned about the
[47:13] condescending part when we know that he
[47:17] all he done was just change the form
[47:26] he didn't change his nature write that
[47:28] word nature down until we get back we
[47:29] won't get it today I told you the other
[47:31] day I was listening to message I suppose
[47:33] you ought to write down nature
[47:34] uh if I was you I'd go home look up a
[47:36] little bit about nature you might find
[47:38] something enjoyable
[47:41] look at the next one we'll read for a
[47:43] little while the Mighty God unveiled
[47:44] before it's 1964 paragraph 35 coming
[47:48] through from 34.
[47:51] and Dr Scofield you'll find here that
[47:53] his word changing from form we find the
[47:55] word amorphy in the Greek which means
[47:57] the Unseen was made visible something
[48:00] that cannot we know it's there
[48:05] all right
[48:06] it can be cannot be seen but yet we know
[48:10] that it's dark
[48:14] and we know it's dark
[48:16] uh you know brother ruddle I remember
[48:18] him years ago he had a real good say and
[48:20] he said anybody who went out in high
[48:21] sense and that stuck with me I laugh
[48:23] every time I think of it you you get
[48:26] that point any white invitable one-eyed
[48:28] and half sense
[48:30] that way that's pretty good but listen
[48:35] and when he changed his form of the
[48:38] amorphy which means that he changed from
[48:41] Supernatural to Natural
[48:45] and he just changed his mask
[48:48] in other words it's like the drama he
[48:49] was acting in the Greek and they would
[48:51] change their Mass maybe one play you
[48:54] know player might have acted in several
[48:56] parts he just changed his mask in order
[49:00] to come out to the impersonate another
[49:02] character all right so that's coming
[49:05] downward all right
[49:10] and when you do
[49:13] look at what he's covering
[49:15] go ahead with number eight it's pretty
[49:17] good reading off questions and answers
[49:19] on Genesis
[49:20] we'll start with
[49:23] verse
[49:26] 26.
[49:29] now no man has seen the father at any
[49:31] time no man has seen God in the bodily
[49:33] form because God is not in body form God
[49:36] is a spirit see all right no man has
[49:38] seen the father but the only begotten of
[49:41] the father hath declared him first John
[49:43] okay now we've been through that we've
[49:46] expressed it when he says that he that
[49:49] God is a spirit we went through giving
[49:51] many of it and we'll give a few more but
[49:53] he he said God is a spiritual being
[49:57] and he's not like the wind that just
[50:00] floats around
[50:03] but see we still hook but God is a
[50:05] spirit
[50:09] well what image is he going to create
[50:12] the man now eventually
[50:15] are you going to create even spirit
[50:20] I wonder where do we get there
[50:23] but now notice now there's nothing
[50:25] there's your space there's no light
[50:27] there's no dark there's no nothing it
[50:29] just seems nothing
[50:32] but in there is a great supernatural
[50:34] being
[50:36] and all of this nothing
[50:39] is a great supernatural being Jehovah
[50:42] God who covered all space of all places
[50:44] of all times he was from Everlasting
[50:47] from Everlasting
[50:49] he is the beginning of creation that's
[50:52] God God can't God can't see nothing but
[50:56] can't hear nothing not a move woman Adam
[50:59] he's talking about what was back Darcy
[51:01] but yet God was there and that was God
[51:04] and watch down a few minutes in it no
[51:07] man has seen that
[51:09] now that's the father
[51:11] that's God the Father
[51:13] then after a while I begin to see a
[51:15] little sacred light begin to form now if
[51:19] we had the drawing up
[51:21] you would realize you just stepped on
[51:23] the other side now that's the first time
[51:25] that I've stepped on the other side
[51:28] uh all I've been before has been back
[51:31] here on this side
[51:32] in eternity
[51:34] now we step over
[51:36] and we start into what is the creation
[51:38] Now watch The Creation then and you'll
[51:41] see what I was talking about this
[51:42] morning
[51:43] who created all things
[51:46] the Sun
[51:50] yeah because he stepped across but what
[51:52] was that son God
[51:54] in another form called a son
[51:57] and created all time right
[52:00] see the sacred light began to form like
[52:03] a little Halo or something you're going
[52:05] to see it by spiritual eyes to look now
[52:08] while we're looking and the whole whole
[52:11] church now and we're standing on a great
[52:13] big banister watching what God's doing
[52:16] and we'll get right down to this
[52:19] question here what people were talking
[52:20] to now no one has seen God and now the
[52:25] next thing we begin to see by eyes of
[52:27] Supernatural looking we see a little
[52:30] white light
[52:31] forming out dire what is that
[52:34] it was called by Bible readers logos or
[52:38] the anointed or the anointing
[52:42] or the as I was going to say
[52:46] the part of God begin to develop into
[52:50] something so human beings could have
[52:53] some type of an idea what it was
[52:56] it was a little a little light
[53:00] moving he that was the word of God
[53:05] now God gave himself birth to this son
[53:09] in which the son which was before there
[53:13] was even an atom
[53:16] and remember when we moved over I said
[53:17] you don't dark time
[53:21] see we want to start time when we jump
[53:23] over from eternity
[53:25] you got the seven days creation that's
[53:27] fine but time really began when sin come
[53:30] into the world
[53:32] right
[53:34] because remember it says God created
[53:38] watch now now God gave himself birth to
[53:42] this son which was before there was even
[53:44] an atom into our air to make an atom
[53:47] that was Jesus said glorify me father
[53:50] with the glory that
[53:51] we had before the foundation of the
[53:54] world see way back in Yonder
[53:56] now Jesus could say that the flesh
[53:58] wasn't talking right
[54:01] flesh wasn't before world
[54:04] right
[54:07] so now who's talking
[54:11] God who stepped over in another form but
[54:16] remember when he stepped over
[54:18] it was only part
[54:22] each one of those attributes I pointed
[54:24] out a while ago can be the fullness of
[54:27] God but they can also be just apart
[54:31] ours were going to take a revelation
[54:36] because of our mind twisting of that
[54:39] word part
[54:41] and he goes on talking about John 1. and
[54:44] the Word was God and the Word was made
[54:46] flesh and dwelt Among Us God unfolded
[54:48] himself down to a human being Now watch
[54:51] how he did it now back there now that's
[54:54] what I said it I was going to caution
[54:55] you when you come because when he gets
[54:58] over brother random is explaining before
[55:00] the world and then he's explaining after
[55:02] the world how Jesus Come into being
[55:05] but just remember one point okay
[55:10] if he's explaining after he comes into
[55:12] being he can't come into being no other
[55:14] way than what he was before
[55:18] right
[55:21] so don't get all confused well he don't
[55:23] know what he's talking about because
[55:24] that's talking about Jesus coming into
[55:27] the world
[55:29] well that's exactly what I'm talking
[55:30] about that's how he started from back
[55:32] there to come down to where he could
[55:34] come out to be Jesus standing here
[55:40] right
[55:42] when this little Halo of light
[55:45] we can't see nothing yet but just by the
[55:48] eyes of just Supernatural we see a Halo
[55:50] standing there now that's the Son of God
[55:52] the Lord gods and I can see him playing
[55:54] around like a little child before the
[55:57] father's door
[55:59] make us wrong
[56:01] I ain't no Theologian figure that out
[56:03] and you and I can't either
[56:07] you're gonna have to believe it to let
[56:09] God reveal it
[56:10] see the Son of God the Lord gosh now I
[56:13] can see him playing around like a little
[56:15] child here child before the father's
[56:17] door
[56:18] and watch
[56:20] he'll come in another quote a minute and
[56:22] he said now see the Irish where it said
[56:23] in the beginning was the word
[56:26] all right now remember he's a little
[56:29] child playing before the father's door
[56:30] then what I was reading this morning was
[56:33] right
[56:34] Jesus Christ is the creator
[56:38] the father is not creating
[56:42] it's the father in the form of the son
[56:45] or else you've missed all them
[56:46] scriptures I gave this morning
[56:50] I changed a lot this morning because the
[56:52] company uh that was fine but I didn't
[56:55] change a lot because all that was in my
[56:56] mind are from
[57:01] remember all those scriptures verified
[57:03] that Jesus Christ
[57:08] was the creator
[57:11] these quotes are verifying the same
[57:13] thing
[57:14] I can see him playing around like a
[57:16] little child before the father's door
[57:17] with all eternities in
[57:20] and now then in his imagination who
[57:24] the son of God
[57:27] is that who he's explaining
[57:30] all right and here's an imaginary makeup
[57:33] he began to think of what things would
[57:36] be
[57:38] and I can hear him say
[57:40] let there be light
[57:42] and when he did an atom bursted and the
[57:45] son came into existence
[57:51] remember Wednesday night brother Louise
[57:54] done a good job of what he was
[57:55] explaining
[57:57] you remember what he was talking about
[57:59] in the bases that uh
[58:03] God that gay
[58:05] Adam
[58:07] the ability
[58:09] to name all the animals
[58:12] right
[58:13] now where did he get that from
[58:18] it wasn't a guess and hit in the mess
[58:21] well that looked like a virus I'll call
[58:22] it a bear he didn't have nobody to look
[58:24] at
[58:26] that right
[58:29] one of these days we'll realize why over
[58:31] in the Old Testament that a man could
[58:33] walk out there one day and he said Lord
[58:36] I'll give you everything I got he said I
[58:38] don't want that he said I'll give you
[58:39] ten percent
[58:42] or do you think he got that thought from
[58:45] where do you think Moses got to thought
[58:48] to write what happened in Genesis
[58:51] it was Moses thought yeah
[58:54] it was Adam's thought and word but who
[58:57] was directing his thoughts
[59:03] come on
[59:05] and let there be
[59:07] name it a squirrel name it a bear name
[59:10] it a horse
[59:11] coming from God down through a human
[59:14] being though
[59:16] that would speak it out
[59:22] and remember
[59:25] he was speaking it out before he went
[59:27] into human flesh
[59:30] because he was leading the animals then
[59:32] when he got into human flesh he could
[59:34] surely bring out what God wanted to call
[59:35] him
[59:36] but you got to put them two together
[59:37] because if you don't you're going to run
[59:39] into trouble but you understand what I'm
[59:41] getting at
[59:46] where do you think this one
[59:48] then watch and now then in his imaginary
[59:52] makeup
[59:53] the son
[59:54] of God
[59:59] where did he get the thought from
[1:00:04] if he was another person you had to
[1:00:07] direct it down one to the other
[1:00:09] but if he was the person then whatever
[1:00:12] was back on this side of the world of
[1:00:15] the thoughts of God in his mind would
[1:00:17] come over on the other side are you with
[1:00:19] me
[1:00:22] and then you can say let us make man now
[1:00:25] you've got not two people
[1:00:29] right
[1:00:31] come on
[1:00:33] do you understand what the prophet is
[1:00:34] getting to when he began when he got his
[1:00:37] imaginary mind when he got everything he
[1:00:39] picks up the thought
[1:00:41] the thought is transmitted down and when
[1:00:44] it's transmitted down here stands the
[1:00:46] logos the speech the Son of God to
[1:00:48] Christ and he said let us make man
[1:00:54] Our Father and Son
[1:00:56] or if you wanted another way to help you
[1:00:58] to understand there's word and spirit
[1:01:01] word Spirit of one right if it's quicker
[1:01:05] you understand what I'm getting at yes
[1:01:08] then you're going to find out the
[1:01:09] prophet is saying
[1:01:11] that that logos that speech is speaking
[1:01:15] the things into existence
[1:01:17] playing before the father's door the son
[1:01:20] of God
[1:01:24] and he can say let us
[1:01:29] because there's two forms of God's there
[1:01:35] that's right the great eternal
[1:01:38] and the son of God
[1:01:42] okay
[1:01:43] are you listening
[1:01:46] playing around before the father's door
[1:01:49] look at the next one which goes into the
[1:01:50] message called life
[1:01:52] e22
[1:01:57] let's close our eyes to our imagination
[1:01:59] for a few moments and go back into the
[1:02:01] for there was anything the great
[1:02:03] Fountain of Eternity the spirit and all
[1:02:05] the honesty what to do then out of the
[1:02:07] existence of the father went the logos
[1:02:10] which was the son
[1:02:16] plain language to me
[1:02:19] if it confuses you I suggest you pray
[1:02:22] because out of the existence of the
[1:02:24] father
[1:02:25] could move over into another form
[1:02:29] and I will keep making this statement
[1:02:33] that a part of God went out
[1:02:36] called a son we'll read them quotes in a
[1:02:39] minute
[1:02:44] he said brother Dale is it necessary for
[1:02:47] us to understand these things
[1:02:52] is it necessary for us to understand
[1:02:56] Father Son and Holy Ghost comparison to
[1:02:59] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:00] in water baptism
[1:03:04] if one other part of the word is
[1:03:06] important
[1:03:08] I thought all of it was
[1:03:16] if I was out here trying to bring some
[1:03:19] great discourse without reading what
[1:03:21] your Prophet said
[1:03:23] you could make that statement that we
[1:03:26] don't need this
[1:03:27] but when the prophet brought it
[1:03:31] I thought
[1:03:32] that he came to bring us
[1:03:35] the word
[1:03:37] well you know when these are this was
[1:03:40] preached in 1953 questions and answers
[1:03:43] on Genesis
[1:03:48] right
[1:03:51] Brother Ray was missing another day a
[1:03:52] message called who is God
[1:03:54] now you'll have to look at it sometimes
[1:03:56] it'll say attitude and who is God
[1:03:58] uh 1950 is it 7 29 1950s 1950. and
[1:04:05] brother Branham is explaining these
[1:04:06] things there's a couple of quotes in
[1:04:07] here in a minute
[1:04:11] so you go back to those old mix we don't
[1:04:13] get over into the third pool after the
[1:04:16] steel broke
[1:04:23] if we don't understand this don't be
[1:04:27] concerned with the seals
[1:04:29] don't be concerned with the rapture
[1:04:32] don't be concerned with those things
[1:04:38] but you see when I quote things like
[1:04:40] that people get all upset
[1:04:42] but random said if you don't understand
[1:04:43] Daniel 70 weeks you can't understand the
[1:04:46] seals but nobody wants to preach on
[1:04:47] Daniel 70 weeks
[1:04:49] right
[1:04:50] I didn't make that statement it's in the
[1:04:52] book
[1:04:55] I'm the smart alec I found it
[1:04:59] right
[1:05:00] baby but look then out of the existence
[1:05:03] of the father went the logos
[1:05:05] which was the sun okay all God was
[1:05:10] he poured into Christ
[1:05:15] his pouring in was way back there
[1:05:21] that's where it's going you're gonna
[1:05:22] have to listen one of these days if I
[1:05:24] ever get enough time to get to it
[1:05:27] told you 40 years ago I said I see
[1:05:29] something but I can't explain it
[1:05:32] that's no longer that day
[1:05:37] that Son of God was God in another form
[1:05:41] not another God
[1:05:47] are either English missed his wording
[1:05:49] then out of the existence of the father
[1:05:51] went to logos did it do away with the
[1:05:53] father
[1:05:55] it enhanced the father
[1:05:58] it made the father into a greater View
[1:06:01] which was the theophany
[1:06:03] which was the body that great Jehovah
[1:06:06] God went forth in a Celestial body
[1:06:08] that's the logos the word spoke out of
[1:06:11] them great Fountains of life and went
[1:06:14] forth and there was the theophany which
[1:06:16] was God made into
[1:06:19] word
[1:06:24] amen
[1:06:27] his words
[1:06:32] let's read on
[1:06:34] number 10 preparation
[1:06:40] sitting way back in eternity that was
[1:06:42] God and then going out of God this is 19
[1:06:45] and 53 11 11.
[1:06:50] then going out of God our God unfolding
[1:06:53] himself come to logos which was the son
[1:06:57] of God or the word of God
[1:07:02] see now you're getting to the John 1.
[1:07:05] the beginning was the word word with God
[1:07:07] the Word was God now you're getting good
[1:07:08] because that's what he's saying here in
[1:07:10] the beginning was the word and word with
[1:07:12] God and the Word was God and the Word
[1:07:13] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the
[1:07:15] logos now watch we're seeing God
[1:07:18] unfold himself
[1:07:24] then he said in Genesis
[1:07:26] let us make man in our own image
[1:07:30] what kind of a man was he
[1:07:36] he had to be a spirit man
[1:07:40] because he's in the image of God
[1:07:43] but we want to make him a spirit
[1:07:47] um
[1:07:49] you hear God's not real if you got him
[1:07:51] just a spirit floating around
[1:07:56] because he's not like the wind he's not
[1:07:57] like the air come on
[1:08:00] look
[1:08:01] he had to be a spirit man and then he
[1:08:04] put him in five senses to contact his
[1:08:07] Earthly home you might give him a foot
[1:08:09] like a bar and a hand like a monkey I
[1:08:12] don't know what he did
[1:08:15] Genesis one man
[1:08:18] let us make man our image was put into
[1:08:19] flesh in Genesis 2 right
[1:08:24] is that true
[1:08:26] I mean that scripture or with it see who
[1:08:30] was that that was created then in
[1:08:32] Genesis
[1:08:33] let us make man whatever
[1:08:39] the image
[1:08:42] that the man came into
[1:08:45] if it's right according to the
[1:08:47] scriptures and the prophet it's the same
[1:08:50] image when the man is brought
[1:08:53] I'm talking about his flesh man all
[1:08:55] right girlfriend
[1:08:56] Spirit man
[1:09:01] and whatever the image is it's got to be
[1:09:03] the image of the father and the son
[1:09:08] because let us
[1:09:11] man you're close to trinitarianism
[1:09:14] I love to walk here
[1:09:18] because here is where I dwell
[1:09:23] look the next one
[1:09:25] thirsting for life
[1:09:30] and I have the Catholic people here the
[1:09:33] book called facts of our faith and they
[1:09:35] use the word of Eternal sonship of God
[1:09:38] the word don't even make sense to me the
[1:09:41] word Eternal means eternity which had no
[1:09:43] beginning or has no end and Son means
[1:09:47] had a beginning
[1:09:48] so how could it be it could be a eternal
[1:09:53] godship
[1:09:58] but never an eternal sonship
[1:10:05] remember the quote just before then out
[1:10:07] of the existence of the father came the
[1:10:08] son
[1:10:13] making two out of it
[1:10:21] what about an eternal godship
[1:10:26] you believe in the Eternal godhead I got
[1:10:28] one in here that he did
[1:10:31] now according to my understanding what
[1:10:33] do you mean when you say godhead
[1:10:35] father son Holy Ghost make godhead right
[1:10:39] well what about an eternal godhead
[1:10:46] you better make the son the father in
[1:10:49] another form are you just lost your
[1:10:51] wording and trapped your own self
[1:10:59] okay
[1:11:01] it could be an eternal godship but never
[1:11:04] an eternal sonship a certain one is
[1:11:06] that's begotten off so it had to so it
[1:11:09] had a beginning so the logos which was
[1:11:12] the son of God went out created by these
[1:11:14] great Fountains of purity God as those
[1:11:18] Spirits went out and it created the
[1:11:20] logos
[1:11:22] you know the word problem using the word
[1:11:24] create and it was a body
[1:11:27] it was in the form
[1:11:30] of what we are now
[1:11:35] which is called in clergy way of
[1:11:38] speaking
[1:11:40] of theophany
[1:11:45] it's a body that doesn't have a spirit
[1:11:47] in it
[1:11:50] it's a body that's waiting for you
[1:11:52] Christians
[1:11:54] as soon as you die
[1:11:57] and you remember now because we're
[1:11:59] getting into something now we're going
[1:12:01] to pick up some ground
[1:12:02] you remember when brother Branham went
[1:12:04] beyond the curtain of time the angel of
[1:12:06] the Lord said this is theophany
[1:12:10] he said that's where he saw him in
[1:12:11] theophany remember he could feel them
[1:12:15] he could see him
[1:12:18] he could hear him
[1:12:25] no we're getting to Something Real
[1:12:33] think about it
[1:12:38] okay
[1:12:40] let's go to the next one
[1:12:44] questions and answers on Hebrews this is
[1:12:48] the part 2 57.
[1:12:51] 1002.
[1:12:53] now he says it don't even make sense
[1:12:55] Eternal sonship of God see there cannot
[1:12:57] be an eternal son because a son had to
[1:13:01] have a beginning
[1:13:03] and so Jesus had a beginning
[1:13:07] now show me where he ever said to Christ
[1:13:09] had a beginning
[1:13:11] Jesus the flesh
[1:13:13] at a beginning
[1:13:15] right right
[1:13:17] okay
[1:13:21] so Jesus had a beginning God had no
[1:13:24] beginning see but the son was not
[1:13:27] Eternal sonship but the son that was
[1:13:30] with the father in the beginning was the
[1:13:34] logos that went out of God
[1:13:41] God in another form
[1:13:44] you want the quotes ahead of time a part
[1:13:46] of God
[1:13:51] and he was the theophany of God that
[1:13:52] went out the human formed it didn't have
[1:13:54] eyes like you see a better eye
[1:14:04] he didn't have ears like you
[1:14:07] here with a far more hearing
[1:14:10] it was a it was a theophany and all this
[1:14:14] rainbow condescended into theophany
[1:14:16] Moses saw it when it passed through the
[1:14:19] rock like that he saw the back part said
[1:14:22] it looked like a man
[1:14:25] well you know brother random when he saw
[1:14:27] those people beyond the curtain of time
[1:14:29] they were real
[1:14:33] they were not Spirits floating around
[1:14:35] Hey Brother Branham you remember in his
[1:14:37] early Ministry
[1:14:39] if you think I can't remember decent you
[1:14:42] remember in his early Ministry he
[1:14:44] thought that's what they'd be you
[1:14:45] remember that he thought they would be
[1:14:47] he said brother Neville I couldn't shake
[1:14:49] his hand he said caught his hands in the
[1:14:51] grave
[1:14:52] he said but I'd see him and I know he's
[1:14:54] standing there
[1:14:57] but then when he went beyond the curtain
[1:14:58] of time he come back and he said they're
[1:15:00] real
[1:15:05] one of these days we're going to realize
[1:15:08] eternal life is real
[1:15:12] eternal life is not thoughts and ideas
[1:15:14] it's a person
[1:15:18] here's the message who is God go to
[1:15:20] number 13.
[1:15:22] preached in 1950 8 15.
[1:15:25] what
[1:15:27] great space and
[1:15:29] no way to confathom it and
[1:15:32] he said that's Jehovah God out there and
[1:15:34] we're taught in the beginning that the
[1:15:36] logos or the Son of God went out of God
[1:15:38] I do not believe in eternal sonship
[1:15:42] that's even radical to even mention such
[1:15:45] a thing
[1:15:46] Eternal sonship how he had a eternal
[1:15:49] he had a Eternal sonship now watch him
[1:15:52] what he's not saying
[1:15:54] that he was eternal sonship it's even
[1:15:57] it's even Eternal sonship how could it
[1:16:00] be a son
[1:16:02] see he's not saying that there could be
[1:16:04] an eternal sonship he's explaining it
[1:16:06] not so look what he said so he first was
[1:16:08] god Jehovah and out of him let's just
[1:16:11] picture now it's a little drama so you
[1:16:13] can get it
[1:16:14] let's see coming out of space where
[1:16:16] there's nothing
[1:16:18] let's make it a little white light like
[1:16:20] a Mystic light like a Halo that was the
[1:16:23] logos that went of God in the beginning
[1:16:25] that was the son of God that came out of
[1:16:27] the bosom of the father
[1:16:30] that was what was in the beginning was
[1:16:33] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:16:36] the word God was God and the Word was
[1:16:38] made flesh now that's jumping all the
[1:16:40] way to the flesh man and dwelt Among Us
[1:16:42] in the beginning was God and then out of
[1:16:45] God came to logos
[1:16:48] a part of God
[1:16:50] that went out of God
[1:16:56] now
[1:16:58] a part of God
[1:17:01] that went out of God
[1:17:07] oh you I thought I had it figured out
[1:17:10] all these years I've been studying it
[1:17:13] and now you're dividing him up in pieces
[1:17:17] no I'm not
[1:17:22] simple terminologies to me
[1:17:25] father
[1:17:29] steps over into son
[1:17:35] steps on over in the Holy Ghost
[1:17:38] the same God
[1:17:41] yeah yeah but you just don't understand
[1:17:43] we'll explain this
[1:17:46] that son that you believe to be almighty
[1:17:49] God in human flesh and we believe that
[1:17:52] right we believe in him was the fullness
[1:17:54] of the godhead bodily we believe that
[1:17:56] you know that he didn't know when he was
[1:17:58] coming back
[1:18:01] and brother Randall said he didn't know
[1:18:03] his part in the Kingdom
[1:18:05] until he come to the Isle of patents
[1:18:11] well I thought I had it figured out I
[1:18:13] was beginning to
[1:18:14] and now you
[1:18:16] now you skunked me again
[1:18:19] all right now you're gonna have to pray
[1:18:22] rolling up a little further because
[1:18:23] there's more to that
[1:18:25] or is that that depart okay
[1:18:29] I was looking for E17 yeah that's it
[1:18:33] and and our now we see this just like a
[1:18:35] child playing before the door it was the
[1:18:37] Son of God the logos I can see him out
[1:18:40] there
[1:18:41] and he's fake and said let there be
[1:18:43] light
[1:18:44] and there was nothing
[1:18:46] but there was something happened in Adam
[1:18:48] verse Adam turned there and began to
[1:18:51] whirling around this way the sun began
[1:18:53] to come into existence because he said
[1:18:56] let there be
[1:18:57] there's the authority where did he make
[1:19:00] it from I don't know
[1:19:02] there was nothing to make it from but he
[1:19:04] believed his own word
[1:19:06] and there was light and I can see a
[1:19:08] peace fly off of that it's a meteor
[1:19:11] after a few million years or 100 million
[1:19:14] bit 100 billions of years you want to
[1:19:17] call it and it circled way out I see him
[1:19:20] standing there watching it
[1:19:23] and it falls down in here
[1:19:26] he stops it after it falls a few million
[1:19:28] years
[1:19:30] and let it hang out during orbit
[1:19:33] here comes another one flying off the
[1:19:35] Sun and goes over here and hangs down
[1:19:36] stopped it there
[1:19:39] what's he doing
[1:19:41] he's making all of the stars and the
[1:19:43] moon and the universe and all the things
[1:19:50] from the word
[1:19:58] and we're still tied up
[1:20:00] uh what happened on day one
[1:20:09] World created on day one
[1:20:14] you're mighty quiet because you're
[1:20:16] afraid to move
[1:20:18] ah
[1:20:20] it says that's why I brought around and
[1:20:21] said it don't matter about all these
[1:20:23] things they claim it's so old he said it
[1:20:25] says in the beginning God created the
[1:20:28] Heaven in here period
[1:20:32] and then day one
[1:20:35] things begin to be created
[1:20:37] day one was not creation of the world
[1:20:40] your prophet's right right millions of
[1:20:43] billions
[1:20:48] and then day one we'll get to that when
[1:20:50] we get time day one this was created day
[1:20:53] two that was created
[1:20:55] showing his nature oh I'd love to get to
[1:20:58] that
[1:20:59] but watch him in the next one
[1:21:03] the unveiling of God
[1:21:05] paragraph 77 and 78.
[1:21:08] and when he said here that he emptied
[1:21:10] himself or poured out and we would think
[1:21:12] like this that he vomited up the English
[1:21:15] word of emptied or poured out from him
[1:21:18] see that's what we think it it signifies
[1:21:22] to us the English word vamach poured out
[1:21:26] something went out of him that was
[1:21:28] different from him
[1:21:30] that's what we think when we're looking
[1:21:32] at the word but the word kinos in the
[1:21:35] Greek does not mean that he vomited up
[1:21:37] or something his arm went off or his
[1:21:39] eyes went out
[1:21:41] another person
[1:21:44] he didn't mean an arm go out and I go
[1:21:46] out or another person
[1:21:47] that is he changed himself he poured
[1:21:49] himself into into another mask into
[1:21:51] another form not another person went out
[1:21:54] of him called the Holy Spirit but it was
[1:21:58] he himself you get it
[1:22:03] not another person went out
[1:22:05] it was he himself
[1:22:10] but keep in mind what he's saying a part
[1:22:12] went out
[1:22:15] now you see why did I'd bring it and say
[1:22:17] well don't leave an empty space now when
[1:22:19] you say oh God what pour it into Christ
[1:22:21] and all Christ into the church just
[1:22:23] don't leave an empty space
[1:22:26] because you're only dealing with what
[1:22:27] God's going to make manifest down here
[1:22:29] and you're only dealing with a part of
[1:22:31] God that's what your Prophet is
[1:22:33] explaining to go ahead
[1:22:38] what was your explanation
[1:22:40] oh the great father created the Son and
[1:22:43] the Creator son Creed the holy ghost or
[1:22:45] you know
[1:22:47] you know we're ooh
[1:22:50] I won't get that
[1:22:52] not another person
[1:22:55] me
[1:22:57] into another mask another form not
[1:22:59] another person went out of him called
[1:23:01] the Holy Spirit but was he himself
[1:23:04] congregation holiday amen he poured
[1:23:06] himself into the people Christ in you
[1:23:09] how beautiful how wonderful to think God
[1:23:11] pouring himself into the human being and
[1:23:13] to the believer pour out
[1:23:15] it was a part of his drama to do so
[1:23:18] God all the fullness all the godhead
[1:23:21] bodily was in this person Jesus Christ
[1:23:24] he was God and God Alone not a second
[1:23:28] not a third person or a second person or
[1:23:31] a first person
[1:23:32] but the person God failed in human flesh
[1:23:37] and you see how much further I can go
[1:23:40] let's see if we can get these things on
[1:23:42] the part and then I'll quit on the other
[1:23:43] part okay go ahead to the next one which
[1:23:45] is Hebrews chapter 1.
[1:23:48] wait a minute we got to 15. I better
[1:23:52] 14. come on Chef where you at
[1:24:00] let's get on the back of the page I can
[1:24:02] find it
[1:24:03] all right
[1:24:04] sure it's the father and it'll satisfy
[1:24:06] us and look what he says
[1:24:08] and there he come out there was nothing
[1:24:10] and then here comes the logos that
[1:24:13] looked like a Halo
[1:24:15] hanging Yonder no man has seen God at
[1:24:18] any time now eye to eye and here's the
[1:24:21] logos looks like it's a supernatural
[1:24:24] being it's a Halo that's the Son of God
[1:24:26] not Eternal sonship because the words
[1:24:29] don't do good together that's the
[1:24:32] Catholic Doctrine but Eternal how could
[1:24:34] it be a sonship and be Eternal if he's a
[1:24:37] son he'd had to have a beginning of time
[1:24:41] eternals forever see so Eternal sonship
[1:24:44] there's no such a word to make that
[1:24:46] sensible but it was the logos that went
[1:24:49] out of God and there he was playing out
[1:24:52] there in space just like a child before
[1:24:56] the door I can see him draw the whole
[1:24:58] picture in his mind of the kingdom and
[1:25:02] what it might be
[1:25:04] do you have any problems then or saying
[1:25:07] well
[1:25:07] let us the father transmitting over are
[1:25:11] coming over into another form called a
[1:25:13] son
[1:25:15] and he can have so much connection until
[1:25:17] what this father had in mind is in the
[1:25:20] mind of the son
[1:25:22] is that any problem
[1:25:28] you know
[1:25:32] all right
[1:25:38] can you give me about 10 minutes
[1:25:41] okay we'll get this part out of the way
[1:25:43] where I can go on look at number 16. God
[1:25:45] I love this Hebrews chapter five and six
[1:25:48] part one wrote it up God didn't have
[1:25:51] three persons up there and send one of
[1:25:53] them his son it was God himself come in
[1:25:55] the form of a son
[1:25:59] now brother Branham could talk about a
[1:26:01] son being back there
[1:26:03] into eternities
[1:26:05] and say he didn't believe in eternal
[1:26:07] sonship
[1:26:09] right
[1:26:14] people want to say brother random made
[1:26:15] all these mistakes why don't somebody
[1:26:17] get a hold of something like that
[1:26:19] it's got even a little sense to it but
[1:26:21] it ain't got no sense if you go on and
[1:26:23] read
[1:26:25] he's talking about something existing
[1:26:28] with the father that's Eternal and says
[1:26:31] he don't believe in eternal sonship
[1:26:34] within the sun would have to be the
[1:26:36] father made manifest in another form
[1:26:39] right
[1:26:41] or else you got eternal sonship
[1:26:44] okay
[1:26:45] God didn't have three people up there
[1:26:47] and send one of them his son he was God
[1:26:49] himself come in the form of a son
[1:26:54] a son has a beginning and the son had a
[1:26:57] beginning
[1:26:58] that some of you dear Catholic people I
[1:27:00] got your book fact of our faith the
[1:27:01] Eternal sonship he said how could that
[1:27:03] be that word is not right for everything
[1:27:06] that's the son had a beginning
[1:27:08] and eternal has no beginning so it isn't
[1:27:11] Eternal sonship Christ become the Flesh
[1:27:14] and dwelt Among Us he had a beginning
[1:27:16] wasn't no Eternal sonship it's the
[1:27:19] Eternal godhead
[1:27:22] not sonship
[1:27:24] now he came to redeem us and he didn't
[1:27:26] read and he did redeem us going to the
[1:27:29] next one let's read Feist
[1:27:31] this is yours the father
[1:27:35] and look what he said let us plural make
[1:27:37] man plural in our image
[1:27:41] what was he there is a supernatural
[1:27:43] being there's the one that could not be
[1:27:45] seen God the father never was seen never
[1:27:48] will be seen he's all nature and there
[1:27:52] he is and now here's the son which is
[1:27:55] the logos that went out of him made into
[1:27:58] His Image a supernatural being that went
[1:28:01] out in the beginning
[1:28:06] I'll be glad to give you these if I
[1:28:07] started to just do them all off
[1:28:10] you know and and let you read all of
[1:28:12] these but
[1:28:14] questions and answers on Genesis 53.
[1:28:17] he made the Sun the first thing you know
[1:28:19] a big clinker
[1:28:22] a big clinker fell off of it Wade
[1:28:24] just about like this Earth and went pew
[1:28:27] then this logos here now the Son of God
[1:28:30] is watching it he lets it fall for 100
[1:28:32] million years and he stops it then
[1:28:34] another one flies off and he lets it fly
[1:28:37] off that it flew off
[1:28:40] fall for millions of years then he stops
[1:28:43] it and we're standing watching this as
[1:28:45] it comes into existence
[1:28:49] he's got something in his mind he went
[1:28:51] on to say
[1:28:54] look at these now for a minute
[1:28:57] and if I just sketch down through it
[1:28:59] forgive me and read what we're getting
[1:29:01] at I want to go to paragraph 128. bring
[1:29:05] it on up because save time now that's
[1:29:07] the reason back down you ain't go too
[1:29:09] far let me get this no no judgment
[1:29:12] doesn't fall at all no you know and when
[1:29:15] judgment was passed by law which brings
[1:29:17] death and there's no one could pay that
[1:29:19] the penalty but God himself and he paid
[1:29:22] the penalty of our death and took our
[1:29:24] sins upon him that we might be the
[1:29:27] righteousness of God through him now
[1:29:29] when these great Lights Went Out are the
[1:29:31] great rays of spirit love peace that's
[1:29:34] all there was that there wasn't no
[1:29:37] suffering there wasn't no hate No Malice
[1:29:40] it couldn't come from this fountain that
[1:29:43] was Jehovah that was Jehovah God and now
[1:29:45] as the theologians call it a theophany
[1:29:48] went out from that which was called in
[1:29:51] the scripture the logos the logos that
[1:29:54] went out of God it's hard to explain but
[1:29:57] it was a part of God
[1:30:02] now don't connect that is
[1:30:05] God in part
[1:30:08] it's a part of God there's a lot of
[1:30:10] difference in the two statements right
[1:30:12] right a part of God can be
[1:30:15] God made manifest
[1:30:18] but don't try to divide him up in parts
[1:30:21] all right at Thy word go ahead let's get
[1:30:23] five
[1:30:25] so the first
[1:30:27] okay who is
[1:30:29] so he first was god Jehovah out of him
[1:30:32] let's just picture now it's a little
[1:30:33] drama so we can get it let's see coming
[1:30:35] out of space where there's nothing let's
[1:30:37] make it a little white light like a
[1:30:38] Mystic like like a Halo did a readout
[1:30:40] and why don't him in the beginning that
[1:30:42] was the son of God that came out of the
[1:30:43] wisdom of the father I'd already read
[1:30:45] that that's logos part of God okay go to
[1:30:47] the next sorry about that
[1:30:49] next one is at Thy word 1951. when
[1:30:53] you're talking about even the Holy
[1:30:54] Spirit and the angels and all that was
[1:30:56] just attributes from God it's just a
[1:30:58] part of God
[1:31:00] it says make up
[1:31:02] it's part of it that went out his spirit
[1:31:05] and so forth that he created to be his
[1:31:07] helpers around to the great see all
[1:31:10] right
[1:31:12] keep on reading grab the next one
[1:31:16] this is taken from the unveiling of God
[1:31:19] all right his arm went off his eye went
[1:31:22] out because that's what the Greek word
[1:31:23] means in vomic out but it's not the
[1:31:25] Kino's word that is he changed himself
[1:31:29] he poured himself into amen into another
[1:31:32] mask into another form not another
[1:31:35] person went out of him called the Holy
[1:31:36] Spirit but it was he himself
[1:31:38] you get it the congregation says amen he
[1:31:42] he himself poured himself into the
[1:31:44] people Christ in you how beautiful how
[1:31:46] wonderful I don't read this but I want
[1:31:48] to read it again himself into the human
[1:31:49] being and to the believer pour out it
[1:31:51] was part of his drama all right go to
[1:31:53] the next I wanted to read that and again
[1:31:55] because a lot of these I repeat
[1:31:57] taken from the message curtain of time
[1:31:59] God which was a part of God God seen
[1:32:02] what the end would be from the beginning
[1:32:03] and the logos come to the Earth which
[1:32:05] was the Christ the word spoken word of
[1:32:07] God part of God and was made flesh and
[1:32:10] dwelt Among Us and there and then we
[1:32:13] come out of Christ which makes the same
[1:32:16] life that was in God in Christ in you
[1:32:20] all right
[1:32:22] what is the problem
[1:32:24] go to the next one
[1:32:28] this is questions and answers on Genesis
[1:32:32] he was in other words Adam the first man
[1:32:36] in the lower creation of God
[1:32:38] the first creation you know this quote
[1:32:39] because we get it before the first
[1:32:41] creation was God himself then out of God
[1:32:43] came to logos which was the son of God
[1:32:45] did out of the Lord Gods which was the
[1:32:46] word in the beginning was the word and
[1:32:48] the words were with God and the Word was
[1:32:49] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:32:51] dwelt among us out of the low guys came
[1:32:53] forth what the man
[1:32:56] Genesis 1.
[1:32:58] 26.
[1:33:00] the man all right
[1:33:03] then where are we going
[1:33:06] look at the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:33:11] page 34 really Church age book
[1:33:13] would you like an Old Testament type
[1:33:15] let's go back to the Garden of Eden when
[1:33:17] the first news came to Glory that the
[1:33:19] son Adam had been lost did God send an
[1:33:21] angel did he send a son did he send
[1:33:24] another one like unto us no he came
[1:33:27] himself to redeem that lost son
[1:33:29] Hallelujah God did not entrust his God
[1:33:32] did not entrust his Plan of Salvation to
[1:33:35] another watch him
[1:33:37] he trusted only himself God was made
[1:33:41] flesh and dwelt Among Us and redeemed us
[1:33:43] unto himself were saved by the blood of
[1:33:45] God the Eternal God indwelt a mortal
[1:33:49] body in order to take away sin he became
[1:33:52] the lamb in order to shed his blood and
[1:33:55] enter into the veil go to the next
[1:34:01] this is the message
[1:34:02] and thy seed shall possess
[1:34:05] in the Garden of Eden when God had to
[1:34:08] his knowledge and true to his word when
[1:34:10] Eve and Adam had done evil when God
[1:34:13] himself running up and down through the
[1:34:15] garden hollering Adam Adam Where Art
[1:34:18] Thou or art thou Adam if somebody wants
[1:34:22] to know where who this man was Jesus who
[1:34:26] was he coming hunting his first lost son
[1:34:31] that God sent an angel
[1:34:33] become himself
[1:34:35] he came himself
[1:34:38] right
[1:34:39] okay go to the next one
[1:34:42] this is taken from the message Jehovah
[1:34:44] Jireh
[1:34:46] and another thing did you notice God
[1:34:49] never sent an angel down to hunt up his
[1:34:50] Lost Child he came himself that's the
[1:34:53] reason that Jesus was made
[1:34:55] I love that one
[1:34:57] I love that statement above all the
[1:35:00] statements I've ever made
[1:35:02] that's the reason that Jesus was made
[1:35:05] to save you and me
[1:35:08] right
[1:35:09] God flesh Among Us God came himself to
[1:35:12] redeem his child that's why Philip could
[1:35:14] say show me the father he said Philip
[1:35:16] I've been so long with you you've seen
[1:35:19] me you've seen the father
[1:35:21] but he couldn't comprehend it he came to
[1:35:24] redeem his own that's the reason Jehovah
[1:35:26] was made flesh in his own son to die to
[1:35:29] sin that was placed upon him to redeem
[1:35:32] The Sinner
[1:35:33] all right go to the next one
[1:35:36] God who is rich in Mercy
[1:35:39] there it was to be an eternal atonement
[1:35:43] this was to be an eternal go ahead of
[1:35:45] 105.
[1:35:47] because he came himself God came down in
[1:35:50] the form of sinful flesh to make him
[1:35:52] make an eternal atonement and suffered
[1:35:55] In the Flesh and made the Eton atonement
[1:35:58] and returned back in the form of the
[1:36:00] Holy Ghost to confirm that atonement all
[1:36:03] right go on to the next sorry to read
[1:36:05] fast but I want to get this done
[1:36:08] God's provided way
[1:36:10] and I can see God come to the Garden
[1:36:12] himself did you notice he never sent an
[1:36:14] angel he never sent some servant he came
[1:36:17] himself and up and down the garden he
[1:36:19] went screaming Adam Adam Where Art Thou
[1:36:23] you get into the omnipresent omniscient
[1:36:26] right
[1:36:27] God manifested In the Flesh God never
[1:36:29] sent a prophet or an angel he created a
[1:36:32] body in the wombs of the Virgin Mary and
[1:36:35] he was the son of God God left his own
[1:36:37] regions of glory and he crossed his own
[1:36:40] cast to come down and become human to
[1:36:43] dwell Among Us
[1:36:45] and there in the beginning
[1:36:47] when man was lost God never sent an
[1:36:50] angel he came himself and he saw and he
[1:36:53] saw through the garden and under every
[1:36:55] Bush and behind until he found his Lost
[1:36:58] Child remember I warned you not to think
[1:37:02] that was only the creation of himself
[1:37:04] coming into flesh to be
[1:37:06] and the Word was made flesh because
[1:37:08] whatever he is here he's got to have
[1:37:10] been back there okay go ahead
[1:37:14] this one is that down Calvary
[1:37:17] godhead required it no man was worthy no
[1:37:20] man was able you remember the kinsman
[1:37:21] redeemer you remember the lambd and all
[1:37:24] taking the book no man could do it and
[1:37:26] God came himself and was made human and
[1:37:28] lived a human life under human desires
[1:37:30] and was crucified at Calvary and our
[1:37:32] when Satan thought he wouldn't do it he
[1:37:35] wouldn't go through with it he went to
[1:37:37] Gethsemane no wonder God in human flesh
[1:37:40] was dying
[1:37:43] my God can't die now you just cut off
[1:37:48] and you'll lose every bit I said in the
[1:37:50] message
[1:37:52] brother so-and-so said God can't said
[1:37:54] his God couldn't die who it was so and
[1:37:57] so
[1:38:01] your Prophet I said
[1:38:04] all right
[1:38:10] he was nothing less than almighty God in
[1:38:12] human flesh he came himself the word
[1:38:14] Perfection to offer his blood
[1:38:17] that had to even come
[1:38:19] the way it came
[1:38:24] look what he says on his last one
[1:38:27] having conferences
[1:38:31] I guess that's the right one e19
[1:38:34] now having conferences should be the
[1:38:36] last one number 33.
[1:38:40] all right we got it
[1:38:42] there you go come on up now
[1:38:44] that God was manifest In the Flesh in
[1:38:47] Jesus Christ to come to the Earth not
[1:38:49] trusted in the hands of an angel or some
[1:38:51] church Authority but he came himself
[1:38:53] made flesh and dwelt Among Us hunt out
[1:38:55] his Lost Child God didn't take Gabriel
[1:38:58] and say go down and hunt my children he
[1:39:01] came himself it was a man-sized job a
[1:39:05] god-sized job let's stand
[1:39:10] sorry to reach suffice and to do him I
[1:39:12] want to get that out of the way
[1:39:14] because
[1:39:15] I want to move on
[1:39:18] but think about it
[1:39:21] what are you saying brother Dale
[1:39:24] I believe that I'm saying what the
[1:39:26] prophet says
[1:39:27] and I believe what he's saying he isn't
[1:39:29] it
[1:39:32] the great eternal
[1:39:36] had all these attributes in him
[1:39:40] and then when it comes to start it to
[1:39:42] display in it he didn't send an angel
[1:39:46] he came himself
[1:39:48] to redeem
[1:39:51] he came himself
[1:39:53] who was that on the River Jordan who was
[1:39:56] that in the Cradle the baby Jehovah
[1:40:00] who is that on the River Jordan
[1:40:06] almighty God
[1:40:10] but yet brother so-and-so says when he
[1:40:12] become God
[1:40:18] that's what I'm telling you be careful
[1:40:21] once you listen to
[1:40:25] the Bible said he was born to Emmanuel
[1:40:28] so I'm going to take the Bible
[1:40:31] you said well what happened on the River
[1:40:32] Jordan right he was anointed for the
[1:40:34] ministry that he went forth exactly
[1:40:38] right not for our sins at two years old
[1:40:40] he could not die for our sins when he
[1:40:42] was arguing with the priests at the wall
[1:40:45] of 12 13 years old or whatever it was he
[1:40:48] couldn't die for our sins when he first
[1:40:50] started his ministry
[1:40:57] but then one day
[1:40:59] at the River Jordan the anointing came
[1:41:02] on him for the ministry that he was to
[1:41:04] bring and he brought that Ministry
[1:41:08] right
[1:41:09] he brought the ministry you know what
[1:41:12] happened in the garden the anointing the
[1:41:14] prophet said left him
[1:41:16] what anointing the anointing it came on
[1:41:18] in one River Jordan about the anointing
[1:41:20] not the anointing of him being God
[1:41:22] because he cried out on the cross
[1:41:24] he said into thy hands I come in my
[1:41:26] spirit
[1:41:29] it was either God died on the cross or
[1:41:31] when you and I are still in our sins
[1:41:35] but we don't want to believe it
[1:41:37] I'm sorry I missed it we're supposed to
[1:41:39] give a doing uh brother Homer Fraser had
[1:41:43] an accident on a tractor most of us know
[1:41:46] brother Fraser he had an accident on a
[1:41:48] tractor busted up his pelvis in
[1:41:51] different things with it in his hips and
[1:41:53] things
[1:41:54] it was something on the thing and I
[1:41:57] forgot to say that to where we could
[1:41:58] pray for him but most all of us know
[1:42:00] brother Fraser and he had this accident
[1:42:04] so let's pray for him
[1:42:06] that God will touch him and bring him
[1:42:08] through this
[1:42:09] he's the one you remember that fell out
[1:42:10] of this free stand got busted up and all
[1:42:13] back a few years ago his brother Ron
[1:42:15] Spencer's father-in-law
[1:42:17] and uh so let's let's pray now before we
[1:42:20] before we do anything in okay father
[1:42:25] we're sorry we forgot about this
[1:42:28] at the beginning our mind was so twisted
[1:42:30] and pulled and but now we were brought
[1:42:33] to our remembrance that we've forgotten
[1:42:35] and we asked Kitty this will be with
[1:42:37] brother Fraser Lord and reach down and
[1:42:39] touch him and take care of all of these
[1:42:41] things that he's had and all the busting
[1:42:43] up the bones and the things because he's
[1:42:45] on up in age probably somewhere in his
[1:42:48] 80s Lord and we just ask you father to
[1:42:51] touch him and to be with him father and
[1:42:53] set him free all the pain the agonies
[1:42:56] and things we love you and we thank you
[1:42:58] in Jesus name
[1:43:06] a little bit over this afternoon but I
[1:43:09] wanted to get the point
[1:43:12] and to bring out about the part of God
[1:43:18] you say but I just can't see how that
[1:43:21] part
[1:43:22] if you get your mind to thinking
[1:43:29] stepped over into
[1:43:32] another foreign
[1:43:46] will be
[1:43:48] will ever be the same now here's what
[1:43:51] we're going to get into so think on it
[1:43:55] run around saying if you read the Bible
[1:43:58] and don't see Christ in every verse
[1:44:02] go back and read it again
[1:44:05] we got to come down through that Old
[1:44:07] Testament before we bring
[1:44:10] God into being upon the earth called
[1:44:13] Jesus Christ
[1:44:14] so we got a large journey to make
[1:44:20] but I hope it's an understanding you
[1:44:24] a chance
[1:44:35] he is here
[1:44:38] amen he is here
[1:45:01] in prayer for us about these things the
[1:45:05] doctors is telling us and all of the new
[1:45:08] age that it won't ever have we believe
[1:45:10] you father thank you thank you for
[1:45:12] speaking to our brother thank Lord we
[1:45:15] love you yes Lord and we thank you that
[1:45:18] in Jesus name amen
[1:45:23] holy I will
[1:45:25] put his name again
[1:45:28] he is here
[1:45:32] please
[1:45:40] please
[1:45:44] father what he's asking for we thank him
[1:45:48] in Jesus name foreign
[1:46:14] down through time and you know different
[1:46:17] things
[1:46:18] now he just
[1:46:19] he can't even do without medication they
[1:46:22] just about have to keep him knocked out
[1:46:24] right
[1:46:25] only relief they get let's believe it he
[1:46:30] helped back here build the back part of
[1:46:32] the church home back there because if it
[1:46:34] hadn't been for him we would have been
[1:46:36] really bad shape because
[1:46:38] the guy that was supposed to be in
[1:46:40] charge he kind of locked out y'all
[1:46:43] and he kind of got left us and he left
[1:46:47] all the cement poured out I just
[1:46:49] happened to be that my wife and I and
[1:46:51] brother and sister would be come up we
[1:46:53] were going up to the mountain to a cabin
[1:46:55] we had and here we are and we get up
[1:46:59] here and there's James
[1:47:02] hardly one arm to work with you and he's
[1:47:05] trying to smooth that out well I had to
[1:47:07] get out in my good clothes and do and
[1:47:09] and help them smooth out the concrete we
[1:47:12] didn't even get it exactly right but we
[1:47:13] got it close enough
[1:47:15] but he's the one that helped do this
[1:47:16] back here to the back home going that
[1:47:18] way so let's let's believe that God will
[1:47:21] take care of it all right father we send
[1:47:25] this prayer clause
[1:47:27] for James Lord and you just reached down
[1:47:30] and touch him and you bring him out of
[1:47:33] all of this hurting and things the
[1:47:35] problems is going on
[1:47:37] in Jesus name amen
[1:47:43] just hold it a minute it'll be Anna's
[1:47:46] coming
[1:47:47] then we'll pray but I wanted to make an
[1:47:49] announcement
[1:47:51] a little been sick in her stomach right
[1:47:54] okay Lord Jesus her throat and her
[1:47:58] things is bothering her her stomach Lord
[1:48:00] we just committed to you father and
[1:48:03] believe in you that by your stripes
[1:48:05] she's healed in Jesus name
[1:48:07] okay amen and amen
[1:48:10] most of you know that they've been
[1:48:12] playing around with me for quite a while
[1:48:14] about an irregular heartbeat
[1:48:17] and they've done everything thanking
[1:48:20] this out of the other and they set it
[1:48:21] for this date and everybody thinks I'm
[1:48:23] going to set another date and everybody
[1:48:24] thinks I'm going but nobody knows yet
[1:48:27] still when we're going because I got to
[1:48:29] go Thursday all right the doctor will
[1:48:32] determine Thursday whether or not I need
[1:48:35] the shocking of the heart you know to
[1:48:38] try to put it back in Rhythm all right
[1:48:40] but it'll be Thursday when I go back to
[1:48:43] the doctor they do have me on the sleep
[1:48:46] machine that I'm you know Piggy's not
[1:48:49] hearing me snore but you're hearing
[1:48:53] all night long and can't turn over and
[1:48:56] look at me a lot of times because the
[1:48:57] Iron's going out
[1:48:59] and mine's not like the old ones that
[1:49:01] put it out this is because it's leaking
[1:49:03] around it I don't have it set on my head
[1:49:05] correctly but you just pray that the
[1:49:07] Lord and that's what I've done I'm still
[1:49:10] believing that
[1:49:11] by the time we get there Thursday that
[1:49:13] the doctor is going to say everything's
[1:49:15] all right
[1:49:16] even that
[1:49:18] all right you say but brother
[1:49:21] still be believing what are you gonna do
[1:49:25] I know by his stripes I'm Healed I don't
[1:49:28] care what the doctor says or what they
[1:49:30] got to do to this body to bring it under
[1:49:32] subjection
[1:49:33] you know it doesn't bother me none
[1:49:36] whatsoever
[1:49:38] I'm not concerned about what you think
[1:49:40] scared because of this out of the other
[1:49:43] if it wasn't for my family in this
[1:49:45] church I'd love to be in heaven right
[1:49:47] now
[1:49:49] but I said if it wasn't for this my
[1:49:52] family in this church I'd love to be in
[1:49:54] heaven
[1:49:56] I would you know I'd be glad to go home
[1:49:57] because I don't care
[1:49:59] the first attack that I had of any
[1:50:01] problem I sit out there for three hours
[1:50:03] outside
[1:50:05] in a deer hunting land
[1:50:07] it just rejoiced it
[1:50:10] and said Lord
[1:50:12] if you want me to go on here today
[1:50:15] we won't have none of that problems to
[1:50:17] take out a run here and run there just
[1:50:19] take me home but take care of the family
[1:50:21] but if you ain't through with me
[1:50:24] then just make everything all right
[1:50:27] and we'll we'll do that
[1:50:29] all right and I believe he still I
[1:50:32] believe he's going to take care of it I
[1:50:34] don't have no concern
[1:50:36] but I'll leave it up to him but it's
[1:50:38] like I told the doctor I said listen
[1:50:39] DACA I believe in your program because
[1:50:42] we believe in medical science up to a
[1:50:43] point that's what I told him I said but
[1:50:45] who do you think is taking care of me
[1:50:46] for 74 years
[1:50:49] you know
[1:50:50] 74 years before you wind up with a an
[1:50:53] irregular heartbeat
[1:50:55] well you think I'm worried about an
[1:50:57] irregular heartbeat I just laughed when
[1:50:58] he said I said doc who's been taking
[1:51:01] care of me all these years
[1:51:04] I said that's one I depend on we had to
[1:51:06] go over the other day to another doctor
[1:51:07] which is a sinus infections and
[1:51:10] different things you know
[1:51:12] and he turned around told me he said
[1:51:14] I know about all these other things
[1:51:16] you've got on here and he said we just
[1:51:18] have to put them on the list well it
[1:51:20] struck me I didn't get exactly what he
[1:51:22] was meaning and he said you know what I
[1:51:24] mean we're going to talk to God
[1:51:27] it's okay the good doctor that's okay
[1:51:32] went to the chiropractor the other day
[1:51:33] because I had a problem in my neck they
[1:51:35] don't want to turn
[1:51:36] you know he got a good life when I told
[1:51:38] him I said it's not my head hurt and
[1:51:40] it's my neck
[1:51:44] and I said the wife is the neck
[1:51:47] he lied back in the other room
[1:51:51] because you know
[1:51:53] the turning the the neck wasn't thrown
[1:51:56] off on her but it's just funny because I
[1:51:58] live that kind of life I'm happy

[1:52:27] do gives them
[1:52:29] a picture perfect

[1:52:36] that's what we're all praying and
[1:52:39] believing it

[1:53:00] sorry for being a little into this
[1:53:02] evening but just remember that remember
[1:53:03] waiting him on the way home but just
[1:53:05] think about it
[1:53:07] the great Eternal God
[1:53:10] is condescending
[1:53:13] down to man
[1:53:16] to save the man
[1:53:19] how beautiful a story
[1:53:22] we had the Plan of Redemption when we
[1:53:24] talked about it in the Methodist the
[1:53:26] Baptist the Presbyterian the
[1:53:27] Pentecostals what did it wind up being
[1:53:30] a good thoughts and ideas
[1:53:33] but now we're down to the bases that we
[1:53:35] can look into the scriptures
[1:53:37] and see God's plan and purpose
[1:53:41] write in the scripture and then look
[1:53:43] back and see it unfolding
[1:53:45] around us
[1:53:48] right
[1:53:50] that's wonderful
[1:53:52] I'm happy about it I don't know about
