TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign God bless you thanks and good morning we sure enjoyed the um brother John Sunday School and uh appreciate him filling them for us and uh y'all just be in prayer for me the next three weekends I'll be we'll be I'll be going ministering so um fulfilling the Great Commission take the gospel into all the world so but yeah we just want to start with James chapter two um just read this scripture and then we'll kind of get into our lesson that says yay a man may say thou has faith and I have worked show me thy faith without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works that I believe is thou that there is one God I'll do as well the Devils also believe in tremble but wilt thou know Will O vain man that faith without works is dead you know we're talking we're looking at Hebrews chapter 11 talking about faith and What a Wonder wonderful uh it's wonderful how God gives us a balance we'll start um brother Joe I I can't make it any bigger I'm sharing the slide let me see try it one more time oh there we go okay I'll match the wrong button I guess um so faith faith without works is dead God gives us a balance when we kind of get on it's toward one side of the of the road and start going into one side of the ditch and God will straighten this up and start going right down the middle so you say you got faith like like James is saying you've got faith well that's that's fine to say that you have faith but it's going to do something now I got this little picture on the side that uh that shows you know if you're if you really got the engine working and you've got gasoline in there and you've got the spark and it's firing away it's going to do something it's going and that's what your faith your faith is to do something it's going to produce a change in your life it's going to produce a change in your walk something's going to happen that's why the Bible says that signs and wonders follow them to believe now we're not looking for signs of Wonder that's not the thing that we're chasing after we're looking for the word but when you believe something will something's going to happen in your life and so faith faith without works is dead and brother Adam would say in the works that I do bear witness of me and that message that he preached in 1951 he said now I want to speak just a moment or just bring your attentions to a few words here that Jesus said at the works that I do bear witness of me now you think about what a great thing that the works that I do bear witness I mean you can see what type of man that Christ was as he lived that you just by looking at his life he would say he could make declarations about who he was and those kind of things but the works actually bore witness of who he was he said the things that I do what I say is what Bears record of me and that's what Bears record of every person do you know I'd rather you'd live me a sermon than preach me one it'll be a better evidence that you're a Christian isn't that right live a sermon and what we are is what we live what we do our actions shows what we are and if we say we have faith and then afraid to step out and claim our faith and put it to work then our faith doesn't do as much good does it the Bible said that faith without works is dead just as the body without the spirit is dead so Faith real faith is going to produce a living something something is actually working something that's doing not just something this just lays there something nice to look at and say well well we've got it no it's going to be something that produces now you think about that as we go into Hebrews 11 that Hebrews 11 is a great book a Chronicle a hall of Faith as Paul would say a cloud of witnesses in Hebrews chapter 12 he says a cloud of witnesses that we could look at and see examples of how when you believe it's going to produce you can see how it produced something when enables life that God actually Vindicated in Enoch's life he got up and started walking up and built a monument of his faith and walked off the Earth and Noah's life it didn't just sit there and he didn't just say well I believe that he'd actually he actually got up and started building and started producing and his faith was Vindicated because God prove that he what he said was right by rain falling on the earth like it is this morning rain rain coming down and so you you see this is Hebrews the whole book of Hebrews chapter the whole chapter of Hebrews chapter 11 is an example that faith is going to do something and verse 4 it says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by he being dead yet speaketh and let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we get to verse five Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather here this morning we just absolutely your blessing on brother Wade is he studying and preparing that you'll prepare our hearts this morning for the word that you've got laid up for us to receive this morning we ask Lord to get your blessing upon the service in your name amen so verse 5 says by faith in Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God and what was what was uh Paul laying out earlier that that you can't please God unless you've got faith so if you want to please God then have faith and so as we're coming to church and as you're listening listening to the word and reading your Bible your faith is being built up because and that's that's what that's what is going to be pleasing to God you think you think about how Enoch walked with God for 365 years yeah according to the Bible what the scripture says and and that all that time he he just kept walking kept just staying right with the word and you see that's an example for us for us in this day as brother Wade's preaching on the Statue of perfect man and coming up the Sun to the revelation of the son of man and all these things that that Enoch was a type of what we are actually doing right now now I I've got this Viewpoint you can see where uh it's a picture of where the capstone's supposed to come down on the pyramid and you can see all the the uh the where the uh the the stones they used to be that they took off that used to be laid on top of it where they uh there was 144 000 Stones all around over the pyramid that you could would actually reflect the light of the Sun that ever they say everywhere you look you can see like that The Gleam of this pyramid and it's actually a an example of what's of what we're doing today and the ten verges in the 144 000 brother Raymond said oh God May someday the church which is a type of Enoch 500 years you walk before God walking walking in the light with a testimony that everything God said he did it he didn't displease him what the Lord said do Enoch done it now if you think about your testimony this morning that if if God said do it you did it if God said to dress different you did it if God said be baptized you did it be baptized the right way God said be filled with the Holy Ghost you did it and all you can look back like Enoch did and see all the things that you did and that everything that you did was by faith and that God is pleased by the faith that you have by a revelation of who he is and and all of those things and then Enoch took us took a trip off the Earth but come with us to fulfill our all righteousness he said I can see Enoch as he knowed it was becoming to him for he was a prophet and he knew what was going to happen so I can see him kiss his wife goodbye and say darling I'll see you later take up his children and kiss them goodbye and go down to his married son and his married daughter and kissed him goodbye and it wonderful to have a prophet that can lay these things out to us and show these things that uh exactly how it happened kiss his married son his married daughter and kissed him goodbye and say where where are you going father are you going out for a little walk yes going for a stroll but he never took the old familiar path that day he took the King's Highway and he went on to glory and it was becoming him to do so he didn't want to leave now you think about that he didn't want to leave but yet it was becoming to him that he fulfilled all righteousness because he was a type of the church today he was a type of the church that's going to take an afternoon stroll one of these afternoons we're going to strike the King's Highway and Away we'll go and the true Easter seal brother random said they weigh tons and tons up there how they ever got them up that's still a mystery to man but they take this razor blade and can run along and it's so honed out so perfect until you can't even put a razor blade where mortar should be now that's what God is doing to his church he's honing off the people and making it in such a perfect way that when The Headstone Christ comes it fits the building together and then a resurrection of the whole thing the church is going up oh thank God that we've got the plan of how to get out of here that we can see actually what's happening in our lives as we as we come to church as we kind of go through the motions of life that God is building us up so that we can get out of here through a revelation of of who he is and all these things and why I'm against organized religion he said and that's the way God does the church he beats every Creed every denomination every man-made Dogma until he sees his own life reflecting in you right if I now there's that that scripture that I was reading earlier if I do not the works of my father believe me not see if what is purpose to the church the life that was in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't you stand still if you haven't got patience virtue all these things and Temperance and things and godliness and brotherly kindness and all these things that's required of you so think about that this morning that this required of you to have these virtues in you and brother Brown will say in another place that if you don't have these virtues and it becomes a stumbling block to the belief why is it a stumbling block because if you say you have faith and then all these things are not on display then it creates a question in somebody's mind why are you flying off the handle why do you not have to why are you not tempering why are you why you get so upset with somebody and not able to deal with somebody it creates a confusion because people are expecting the works of Christ to be on display if you say that you're a Believer faith that's where the The Works The Works of my father are these things right here on that that we're talking about the word what is it it's Christ actually on this play in you in the body of Christ and when you come to church you want you expect to see Christ you expect to see Christ in The Believer and you think about what brother Brown was saying here he says no matter what you've done no matter how much you've shouted how many churches you've joined how many feathers you've panned into yourself don't do it wait till genuinely from your heart oh think about what he's saying now a real Holy Ghost Field believer can forgive somebody wait till genuinely from your heart you can forgive till in your heart you have brotherly kindness no matter if they pull a handful of beard from one side you can turn the other cheek with sweetness see until those virtues no matter what they say to you no matter what they say to you that God's God's given us the the recipe to achieve this by his word as we receive the word it's actually changing is to make us to make us like him to make us be like Jesus so you think about you think about the higher you go up that pyramid I've got a little picture here of a young man that climbed that pyramid illegally and he got up there and he he sat on the top and you think about when you get up you it changes the way that you view things it changes you think about what he's saying here until you can forgive in your heart that you have brotherly kindness that you can look on somebody differently maybe than you did when you were down you just got born again and you were looking maybe with a critical eye and maybe all you could think about was about whether somebody had a Christmas tree or not and you're just ready to criticize criticize but the higher you go up it changes your Viewpoint where you're now you're looking at other people that now you're realizing they're going through a a journey themselves and that the same God that took you through your journey is able to take them through their Journey because he promised that the spirit of truth will lead and guide you into all truth so if he took me and led me to where I am that he's able to take you and lead you to where you are and that's what Peter was talking about the second Peter when he said but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off oh God wants you to get up high that's what that's what he got divorced that John heard come up higher he wants you to come up higher so you can see things differently the higher you go the more the more love you can show with the other person the more grace you can show the other person things look a little bit different when you get up higher you cannot see a far off if you don't have these virtues but he that lacketh these things as blind and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins oh you think about somebody way down at the bottom maybe they're they're kind of getting started and they they're all they can think about is well you you just you're something wrong with you and something wrong with you but when you get up higher you remember how God delivered you of your own sins and you can show Grace to somebody else Grace that's why it's Grace Grace Craig great crying Grace To The Headstone Grace where you can show Grace to somebody else and minister to somebody else with love and show them a little bit of Grace and kindness kindness let's keep going with this study so so the Bible says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him uh you you think how you when you read the Bible you've got to read it in context so you could isolate that scripture where he's talking about that Enoch please God and say how do I please him but just keep reading that by faith without faith it is impossible to please him so with faith you can please God and believe in God brother Adam said now if we are born of our Heavenly Father God who calls those things which are not as though they were there's got to be something in us like that see that's the reason that a real consecrated Christian that's all out for God looks to what God Said instead of what you see or feel that's the Earthly man there if we walk in the flesh we can't please God we walk after the spirit you think if you're if you come to church living by faith that you're not looking so much even to please the other person or the other you're not maybe even to please the minister but you're looking to please God and that's when something will happen if you if you want to please God and make sure that God is Happy Look to Him and look to his word instead of all the circumstances and all the things around like like Noah did when he just ignored all the circumstances like Abraham did when he ignored the circumstance of his life and where you know all like no Moses did when he got to the Red Sea and the Egyptians were on his tail and and the Red Sea was before him and he just he just looked to what God had promised instead of all the things that he could observe by his natural eye my brother Adam said in diseases and afflictions he said you can't have anything from God Only By Faith by faith the walls of Jericho failed by faith Moses Refuge to be called the son of Pharaoh's Daughter by faith to Gideon did so and so by faith the only way and without faith is impossible to please God and if you want to please him you must come to him with faith believing his word is truth brother Adam said when you are saved God gives you Faith to rise from the muck of the earth your faith overcomes the things of the world what is your faith your faith is that act that God has did in you to make you a Son of God oh to think about that this morning that faith is not just just studying something and not just being educated but faith is actually something Supernatural in your life he said you quit your line you quit your stealing you quit your drinking because your faith Rises you up above it if you don't do it you don't have any faith and by faith are you saved and that through Grace and he said as much as you think about this as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you can have now you you think as you're studying the message you think about all these things that brother Ryan said to build our faith that all these things that Paul is saying all the way up leading up to Hebrews 11 and closing out with Hebrews 12 and 13 was to get you to believe that there is nothing impossible with God if you can believe it if you can believe it you can speak a world into existence and go live on it and there is nothing impossible and nothing means nothing nothing nothing there is nothing impossible with God if you can believe it if you can believe it God will put that pocket knife in your pocket if you can believe it he'll make the little keychain move if you can believe it your family can be set in order if you can believe it you'll get the Holy Ghost there is nothing impossible with God if you can believe it a little faith is as a grain of mustard seed will move a mountain if you can believe it if you can move it believe it the Red Sea will be parted the Egyptians will be destroyed all those things that have been trailing you that you've got problems with what all your life maybe all addictions and things if you can believe it it'll be it'll be destroyed just like God destroy the Egyptians God dwells in you and you are Sons and Daughters of God there you are but it's your faith Jesus said according to your faith be it unto you if thou can't believe all things are possible verily I say unto you if you say unto this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe that what you have said all things are possible that's why even the song that brother Brown said it said that's saying in his ministry was only believe all things are possible because he wanted people to believe that it didn't matter whether they had cancer in their body it didn't matter if they had uh problems in their minds it didn't matter it all things are possible if you can believe and he said you could speak a word into every present water from The Rock he said you could speak a world into existence and go live on it there you are that's what power is in the church now but it is controlled by a law let's see what kind of law he's talking about it's controlled by law and that law is not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's not just like an intellectual idea like Cain say thought or Esau when they came trying to come with their intellectual idea what the message of that day was it's a law of faith faith Jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours the whole to think about that this morning if we could just grasp it if you can believe it whatever you need is yours every place The Souls of your feet foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you oh that's what Paul's talking about in Hebrews chapter 11. now you can believe it something's going to happen if you can believe it there's going to be Works following there's something something will be demonstrated where people can look at your life and see there's a real belief where people can look at the evidence the evidence of something happening in your life because faith will produce something it'll do something and that's what that's what Paul is talking about as we keep going he said by faith Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by Faith by faith Noah got up and did something he believed God enough to start building on that Ark and uh there's there's so many things that you can study here that the three pools of what Noah was doing and so forth and so on but by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have received an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he'd sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God you think now would that have been faith if Mo if God talked to Abraham and he just sat there in the land of shinar or wherever he started off from and just just sat there and and said well God told me he maybe say I believe the message I believe what God told me but no James is telling us it's not Faith unless you get up and do something because faith is going to produce works and Abraham started on his journey and started started started looking for the city that God promised him right and we'll get we'll get to it here in a minute that Abraham was looking for a city that he never got to but we it Paul as Paul lays out in Hebrews chapter 12 we have come to the Mount Zion we have come to the New Jerusalem we've come to the to what all those things that that the Old Testament saints were looking at for we have come to those things and then the only ones at the end time brother Brown said what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you will believe it but but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God so by revelation it was a Abel got the revelation of the will of God when he offered a sacrifice that the right kind of a sacrifice not just fruits from the field but he offered a little lamb and Noah got a real revelation of what God wasn't going to do and you think about God can give you a revelation of his will that will inform where you should go and how you should act and what church you should go to and who you should marry with the rebel a revelation is the will of God so by Revelation and the churches today don't even believe in spiritual Revelation they believe in a dogmatic teaching of some system by Revelation Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain which God testified he was righteous I hope you see that see where we're living see the hour I was talking to a gentleman not long ago a Christian scholar and gentleman he said brother Branham uh Mr Brandon we refuse all Revelations I said then you have to refuse Jesus Christ for he is the revelation of God Amen God revealed in human flesh and unless you see it you're lost but to the church he said in the Rapture the bride the Rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that Revelation for the Rapture it is a revelation for the Revelation is Faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that's been revealed to you like it was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what had been revealed him as though it wasn't so now Faith that's what faith is is the revelation of God the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire excuse me the whole entire body but he said oh how we need Revelation by the spirit we don't need a new Bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good in the musicians can go ahead and come forward some are very good and I'm not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank God we can have what we need for God wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit aren't you glad he said that thank God we can have what we need and God bless your Saints [Applause] [Music]
