[15:19] unrighteousness and help us to walk in
[15:22] you we love you and we thank you in
[15:24] Jesus name
[15:29] young one in the beginning was the word
[15:36] and the Word was with God and the Word
[15:40] was God
[15:41] the same was in the beginning with God
[15:43] all things were made by him by who God
[15:51] we're gonna get into a little bit of the
[15:53] Godhead today to try to express
[15:56] something and maybe we can follow her
[16:00] along but said all things were made by
[16:02] the word and the word is God right and
[16:09] without him was not anything made that
[16:10] was made
[16:11] in him was life and the life was the
[16:15] light of men
[16:17] now I shine a thin darkness and the
[16:19] darkness comprehended it not man let's
[16:23] go over now because we're gonna pick up
[16:25] some creation so we'll try to move on
[16:30] into our thoughts we were bringing the
[16:32] other day so let's go to Genesis to
[16:37] verse 4 said and these are the
[16:39] generations of the heavens and the earth
[16:42] when they were created in the day that
[16:44] the Lord God made to earth into heaven
[16:48] not now who made do well the heavens
[16:51] everything the Lord God notice now
[16:56] that's capital L Ord and then it's
[17:02] dassault small
[17:03] lowercase G OD its meaning whatever it
[17:09] is heaven or earth huh you follow me
[17:16] whatever it is heaven the capital L Ord
[17:21] he's the author of that whatever it is
[17:23] on earth that's why you get in a minute
[17:26] and you're reading Genesis it's the
[17:28] lowercase G OD alright that will follow
[17:33] that and try to get her thought in every
[17:38] plan of the field before it was in the
[17:41] earth
[17:42] and ever above the field before it grew
[17:44] more the Lord God had not caused it to
[17:48] rain upon the earth and there was not a
[17:51] man to till the ground which I went out
[17:55] of mist from the earth and watered the
[17:57] whole face of the ground and the Lord
[18:00] God Jehovah Elohim alright formed man of
[18:08] the dust of the ground and breathed into
[18:12] his nostrils the breath of life and he
[18:14] became a living soul
[18:18] you may be seated lord have his blessing
[18:23] upon the reading of the word as I said I
[18:25] want to I want to back up a little bit
[18:29] in what we've been talking and move on
[18:33] in - oh you know some other things you
[18:37] know they can pick it up that may help
[18:40] us and and give us understanding because
[18:44] we've all until we came to the light of
[18:47] the truth we may have read a lot of
[18:53] scriptures or talk about it but we had
[18:56] in our mind that the creator was the
[19:01] great eternal God and that's true but
[19:06] you remember your thoughts as I was
[19:08] bringing out the other night about it
[19:10] you remember your thoughts back there we
[19:12] thought about God we talked about God we
[19:15] considered God we knew the word garden
[19:17] an object of worship we could go back
[19:20] through the terms of Jehovah and tell
[19:26] him and all of that we could go through
[19:30] those things back in the Baptist
[19:32] Methodist you know Presbyterian whatever
[19:35] we come from but comparing that
[19:39] understanding of God to what he has
[19:44] revealed to us in the last days after
[19:47] the message you know because that's the
[19:50] only way you and I could get it with no
[19:53] denomination you can get it no nobody
[19:55] can get it
[19:56] way the word comes to the Prophet but
[20:00] then after all that he has said do we
[20:04] really understand the real truth one
[20:08] true and living God and how it's made
[20:11] there were quite a while we've been
[20:13] dealing with one thought and I don't
[20:18] understand why we can't read and stay
[20:22] with that we're discussing it life's not
[20:25] with it
[20:25] sisters are at the house that why we
[20:28] can't just read it and believe it you
[20:32] know I mean we're not theologians that
[20:36] we have to talk in terms but we do use
[20:39] words that the theologians use because
[20:43] that it is a way of expressing it and
[20:47] that way in this it's good to use but
[20:52] see what was our lifestyles drilling
[20:55] hard upon bringing it to a thought what
[21:00] is a human being a human being is a
[21:06] wonderful thing is he's a triune being
[21:11] just as God is a triune being not a
[21:13] Trinity God is not a Trinity the triune
[21:18] in other words he has many many
[21:21] manifestations you as a human being
[21:25] you're a body you're a spirit which is
[21:29] there within you and then that's a soul
[21:32] that makes you a person a being My
[21:37] Father Son and Holy Ghost makes God a
[21:42] person not three persons me because
[21:47] that's that's not even in the scriptures
[21:49] of a Trinity it was never told until
[21:52] coming on up to about 325 AD and they
[21:57] begin to speak about using the word
[22:00] Trinity and they started out with making
[22:04] Jesus a lesser God and as they did then
[22:08] they started with the idea and
[22:10] concept of Father Son and Holy Ghost has
[22:12] to be a Trinity but yeah it's not that a
[22:18] way it's trying to express the one
[22:20] person and that's what we'll try to do
[22:22] throughout the Bible to the show and
[22:25] I'll give it to you before we start
[22:27] we'll talk and see how that God created
[22:32] the heavens God created man God created
[22:36] all of these things there's only one God
[22:41] that created this
[22:42] I mean I'm quoting scripture huh
[22:46] and then we get down you know and we'll
[22:49] get into the John we're talking about
[22:53] the word and God and who it is is being
[22:56] one and then how that he created all
[22:59] things it follows all the way through
[23:06] the Bible until we come into the book of
[23:10] James then God will go through the
[23:12] Colossians in the different scriptures
[23:15] Hebrews but it winds up in James saying
[23:20] all things were created and agender
[23:25] efficiency's excuse me it winds up
[23:29] saying all things were created by Jesus
[23:31] Christ then you find him in the Book of
[23:37] Revelations as the one sitting on the
[23:40] throne and you know who that is he comes
[23:44] upon the throne and sits down in the
[23:45] Book of Revelations which is the Lord
[23:48] Jesus Christ and it says you created all
[23:52] things and all things were made for you
[23:55] and by you but do we understand that and
[24:02] one thing for certain when we talk about
[24:05] Jesus Christ we're not talking about a
[24:08] human flesh we're talking about Almighty
[24:13] God so don't get confused and think that
[24:17] when I talk about Jesus and if I fail to
[24:20] say Jesus Christ keep it in your
[24:22] thoughts and I just say
[24:24] Jesus remember we're not talking about
[24:26] there's no such thing as the human flesh
[24:30] of the Lord Jesus Christ being back
[24:34] before the world and creating all right
[24:38] so if I slip up you know I'm getting old
[24:42] and I do a lot of things and you know
[24:46] but then he says I repeat myself a lot
[24:49] but that's one thing for sure I was
[24:51] doing that when I was 40 so I don't
[24:54] worry about it at 77 because I want you
[24:58] to understand what I'm talking about all
[25:01] right
[25:02] and to follow the line in the right
[25:04] order and to see what we're really
[25:09] looking at because we're gonna talk
[25:11] about the Creator God and we're gonna
[25:16] see that it'll tie together bring out a
[25:19] beautiful picture the revelation of one
[25:24] true and living God what was their life
[25:27] stops our life stops was talking about
[25:31] man we've been on that for quite a while
[25:34] and talking about there's a saying that
[25:37] man is a body a spirit and the soul
[25:41] that's what it takes to make a man all
[25:45] right now see then when Jesus Christ
[25:48] came to earth you know see then he
[25:54] became in our image was his body spirit
[26:01] and soul and we've expressed to you'd
[26:07] went over and over and over about the
[26:09] things but you see when that little baby
[26:12] was born your prophet said Jehovah
[26:16] crying in a cradle he said your God with
[26:24] no teeth no can we comprehend that we
[26:33] said well yeah we can see Jesus
[26:38] we can see Jesus with no teeth but that
[26:43] wouldn't know where he said it he said
[26:46] little Jehovah the Bible says what that
[26:52] he was born Emmanuel which is by
[26:58] interpretation God with us but now do we
[27:05] believe that or do we want to try to
[27:09] make it a second person or why can't you
[27:15] say then according to according to
[27:19] Hebrews 5 10 5 a body was provided by
[27:30] way of the Virgin Mary to be our brother
[27:34] that was the purpose Melchizedek it
[27:38] stood back there with Abraham was a
[27:41] human body but he was not kinfolks to us
[27:49] he was just spoke into existence a body
[27:53] created God stepped into the body came
[27:56] to earth you know the Prophet explaining
[28:00] that see then the two that went to Sodom
[28:03] he said God just he just created her
[28:07] body for them and they went down to
[28:09] Sodom we remember you saw no more of
[28:14] Melchizedek because Mel chasity became
[28:19] Jesus Christ know that who is this Mel
[28:22] chatter I've asked you to read that
[28:24] message over and over
[28:26] alright see then to find out then that
[28:31] we could look at man and see God is that
[28:36] hard when the Bible says that the even
[28:42] the eternal Godhead can be understood by
[28:48] the things that we see
[28:50] are you with me but the Bible says yeah
[28:54] but we want to see God but you're
[28:57] looking in the wrong direction
[28:59] because that was the trouble back
[29:01] daughter you a man I didn't say you're
[29:06] God making yourself a god did you a man
[29:11] making yourself God they couldn't follow
[29:16] that we get the word has spoken that
[29:21] just that's the way he would be all the
[29:24] types of the shattered every time
[29:26] pointed to a human element coming to the
[29:30] earth that they would call him and you
[29:33] would call him the Messiah that would be
[29:36] our brother
[29:38] they said Melchizedek or any other form
[29:41] that you find three Hebrew children and
[29:44] the man in the furnace with him anything
[29:46] you find you can't make that anything
[29:51] that would have anything to do with
[29:53] Redemption all right it would require
[29:57] that God Himself would come to earth
[30:03] once sin entered the picture that God
[30:08] himself would have to come to earth now
[30:12] you remember the story the Prophet said
[30:14] he said he didn't send another person no
[30:19] he said didn't send a son then wouldn't
[30:22] that be something for you to you know it
[30:25] comes up and you're gonna have to die
[30:26] and you say hey wait a minute he's all
[30:29] you need is one life they say yeah okay
[30:34] come here son goodbye I love you now
[30:39] that wouldn't be too good of a human
[30:41] being now the Almighty God that could at
[30:47] the flick of a finger or whatever and
[30:49] annihilated the mankind if he wanted to
[30:52] I don't think he would try to send the
[30:55] son so he never sent her son he came
[30:57] inside
[31:01] so that it plainly tells you God with us
[31:08] and that God would be on earth did he
[31:15] create a body probably said it like this
[31:20] enter body that is for he said the
[31:22] father to be a son has to be a father so
[31:31] then he spoke a body into existence and
[31:35] just stepped into it his soul is the
[31:40] soul of Almighty God his spirit was the
[31:43] spirit of Almighty God but Ron said
[31:46] that's why Jesus wouldn't know all
[31:48] things because he was theophany before
[31:51] he became flesh then in understanding
[31:59] that man is created we went through
[32:02] Genesis 1 over and over and over to
[32:07] understand that mankind is built in the
[32:13] image of God now that man in Genesis all
[32:20] mankind o people mankind that's why it
[32:26] said ezekiel 18:4 all souls are mine
[32:29] alright Satan can't give you a soul he
[32:33] kept doing the all souls belong to God
[32:35] alright
[32:37] but then Genesis 1 we established that
[32:42] that was a marvelous person that would
[32:45] be standing there because in that one
[32:48] person would cover the redemptive plan
[32:53] of mankind
[32:57] alright now that would give you a right
[33:03] to come to a position somewhere that
[33:08] you'd be a child of God let's see Jesus
[33:14] Christ now we know that the only name
[33:20] God ever had is Jesus but you just don't
[33:25] go around saying Jesus Jesus Jesus
[33:27] right because you get connected as the
[33:30] oneness and you know so the better way
[33:36] of saying is Jesus Christ our Lord Jesus
[33:40] Christ
[33:42] no it's like I've always said to you I
[33:47] want you to get one point a prophet has
[33:49] no power to change any scripture I don't
[33:56] care how great a prophet you want to
[33:58] think he is he has no power to change
[34:01] one description it wouldn't be a prophet
[34:05] if he did so he's got to come according
[34:08] to the word but it isn't isn't it
[34:11] amazing that the Bible and here's one's
[34:20] gonna throw you so listen there is no
[34:23] scripture that says the baptize in the
[34:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ you get
[34:34] quiet on that won't you
[34:36] the Bible says in the name of Jesus
[34:40] Christ why was your profit and mankind
[34:47] was already baptizing in the name of the
[34:48] Lord Jesus Christ before brother Branham
[34:50] came on the scene right you know that of
[34:53] of coming down why would your profit
[34:56] emphasize though that the correct way to
[34:59] baptize would be the name of the Lord
[35:01] Jesus Christ it says Jesus Christ in
[35:07] learning in the book of Acts but then a
[35:12] little bit later of saying the name of
[35:13] the Lord
[35:20] see what your prophet is doing he's
[35:23] taking all of the Scriptures pertaining
[35:27] to baptism and by the authority given
[35:31] unto him not to change scriptures no way
[35:39] and making a false prophet I hope you
[35:42] understand that strong that would be if
[35:45] he changes anything is false prophet he
[35:47] can't do it you've got to come according
[35:49] to the word well yet he would see that
[35:52] the Lord is involved in one time Paul
[35:56] peeks over that his baptized in the name
[35:58] of Lord Jesus and that's why your
[36:05] oneness and I went to that never thing
[36:07] but it won't work see then the Prophet
[36:12] said the correct way was the Lord Jesus
[36:15] Christ he said because you're giving him
[36:20] all of the titles involved in that
[36:28] because everything there is everything
[36:34] there is there's nothing that you can
[36:38] get outside of Lord Jesus Christ because
[36:44] redemption healings everything is
[36:50] connected with Lord Jesus Christ
[36:56] now as the brother was talking last
[36:58] night in this morning that enjoyed me it
[37:02] is time to settle down to the
[37:05] understanding because we cannot just
[37:10] keep playing along and said well this is
[37:13] what I believe at least we ought to be
[37:18] able to come to a position to say why we
[37:21] believe it what if somebody comes to you
[37:26] and said how do y'all baptize you say
[37:30] Lord Jesus Christ what are you going to
[37:35] say to them when they say that ain't me
[37:36] in the in the Bible there's no verbatim
[37:39] scripture that says Lord Jesus Christ
[37:47] Richie Bible it's not making it
[37:53] deceptive for Peter to say you know are
[38:00] they writing in the Acts about Jesus
[38:03] Christ but it does say we said everyone
[38:05] in the about 2000 imma Jesus Christ
[38:12] would you accept a person into your
[38:17] congregation etc - preacher I'm talkin
[38:19] me whatever you if they come up and they
[38:23] said I was baptized in the name of Jesus
[38:26] Christ you think I need to be baptized
[38:28] again what would be your answer because
[38:34] according to you and your studies and
[38:37] the things of the prophets message and
[38:39] the way he done it said he baptizing
[38:41] named Lord Jesus Christ let me change
[38:46] the scripture what are you gonna say
[38:57] see I was approached by that years ago
[38:59] and the first person when only was and I
[39:03] baptized him in the name of the Lord
[39:04] Jesus Christ all right but I asked a
[39:08] person the question I said what was your
[39:13] previous understanding of the Godhead
[39:19] when you was baptized in the name of
[39:22] Jesus Christ dead well I guess it was
[39:32] under regeneration and I told him as
[39:38] much as I tell you I don't care how many
[39:41] times you've been baptized name of the
[39:42] Lord Jesus Christ I said Lord Jesus
[39:45] Christ I don't care how many times
[39:47] you've been baptized in it but if you're
[39:49] connecting it in any way to regeneration
[39:53] under the name of that way
[39:55] then it wouldn't be right true just
[40:02] talking to you hmm just talking to you
[40:07] just asking you some simple questions
[40:09] but you see God knew that it would come
[40:17] to the point of sending a prophet and
[40:21] that he would take all the scriptures
[40:26] and he would say like I said if somebody
[40:31] come in and said I've baptized named
[40:33] Jesus Christ don't you think that's good
[40:35] enough I'd ask him the question what was
[40:39] your thoughts before then now I'm asking
[40:41] you another question would you be
[40:44] willing to be baptized in the name of
[40:47] the Lord Jesus Christ if they say no I
[40:51] said your baptism dry yeah I have to be
[40:58] straight I'll I'm pastor I have to talk
[41:00] straight okay what did somebody come and
[41:04] ask you those things what would be your
[41:06] answer
[41:11] see my answer was that I so brother I
[41:13] said what would you believe in when you
[41:16] baptized name of Jesus Christ he said
[41:19] where we was believing what about tears
[41:21] I'm under regeneration and I said well
[41:24] then for conscience sake if nothing else
[41:28] I would make sure that I got baptized
[41:33] again and I told him I said and for
[41:36] straight truth sake if I was you I would
[41:41] never baptize anybody just the name of
[41:44] Jesus Christ I would make it Lord Jesus
[41:49] Christ you understand what I'm saying we
[41:55] claim a prophet has come and brought us
[41:58] the truth now I thought according to
[42:03] brother Branham that this messenger of
[42:05] life days had no certain how did he say
[42:09] that wanted no certain mystery of what
[42:11] was it he said he said but he was to
[42:14] take all of the loose ends and bring
[42:19] them together all the loose ends to
[42:25] bring it together all right we got to
[42:26] loosen them he's Jesus Christ okay oh
[42:34] why do we baptize the Lord Jesus Christ
[42:40] and see they're not like I said we
[42:42] always do it I always say to fulfill
[42:45] Matthew 28:19 it says it was a name of
[42:52] the Father and of the son
[42:54] you know the holy God i baptize thee my
[42:58] brother sister in the name of the Lord
[43:00] Jesus Christ see that fulfills it but
[43:03] what if he left out one of those what if
[43:07] you just took Jesus Christ and he took
[43:09] Jesus as Matthew said baptize in the
[43:16] name was he wrong to say that or was he
[43:20] telling the truth
[43:23] me see the only way you could be
[43:26] baptized in the name of the Father the
[43:27] Son and the Holy go
[43:29] you'd be baptized in the name of the
[43:31] Lord Jesus Christ it's not the way you
[43:33] can do it see so you said Lord Jesus
[43:37] you'd be leaving one off and you
[43:39] wouldn't be according to Matthew see
[43:43] then when Peter is a sinner power one it
[43:45] was Paul comes over any baptizing them
[43:48] said they were baptized in the name of
[43:50] the Lord Jesus
[43:51] well it's okay to be baptized the name
[43:54] of Lord Jesus is it okay to be about
[44:01] 2,000 on the Lord's head no so a prophet
[44:07] brings all of the scriptures together
[44:10] and brings you to an understanding that
[44:14] ties everything together then it cannot
[44:17] be questioned then of what you're saying
[44:22] see when you finalize it by saying to
[44:26] fulfill the Great Commission the baptize
[44:29] in the name of the Father and of the son
[44:31] of the Holy Ghost
[44:32] I'm baptizing my brother with it in the
[44:35] name of the Lord Jesus Christ see Satan
[44:38] can't question that now don't mean he's
[44:42] gonna believe it because he's won it
[44:44] started the Father Son and Holy Ghost
[44:46] out of it going the other way
[44:49] well my point is do we believe God sent
[44:53] a prophet that away he was to bring us
[44:59] the perfect interpretation of the word
[45:03] of God but that he could not change
[45:05] Scriptures so he puts together the
[45:11] Scriptures a paul said lord jesus oh
[45:16] jesus saying father son holy god a peter
[45:23] every which one over in the book of acts
[45:24] they said in the name of jesus christ
[45:29] see now you put together the scriptures
[45:32] to come out with a conclusion
[45:35] that that is it and it's settled
[45:47] see because that way the word of god is
[45:49] so perfect then what's this place like
[45:53] that you can't question it well I'm
[45:56] sorry to say it and I'm human I'm sorry
[45:57] but and I don't mean to be derogatory or
[46:00] hateful but that's like I've tried to
[46:03] tell you when brother mode asked me said
[46:05] what do you believe about baptism I'm
[46:11] not totally father son holy God what do
[46:14] you believe about God I said God in
[46:18] three persons because that's all in you
[46:24] and I was reluctant to use co-equal Co
[46:27] eternal even in those days but still I
[46:29] was caught like everybody else
[46:31] and let me say it like you you don't
[46:35] want to admit it but you're caught with
[46:37] it seeing that that's part of your
[46:39] trouble right now is you don't want to
[46:41] admit your pice to be caught with
[46:43] something no I didn't believe it out we
[46:47] just didn't understand well what's the
[46:50] difference
[46:51] you'd understand but you see when
[46:56] brother mode said now father's and not a
[46:59] named son Holy Ghost not a knight that's
[47:05] true he said you say God in three
[47:09] persons he said a person's personality
[47:11] personality's an individual individuals
[47:14] a person well I'm not saying I had so
[47:19] much education or it's so smart in my
[47:21] brain I just had a little bit of sense
[47:24] and that's why I told you what happened
[47:30] to most people they would have argued
[47:32] with him I'll tell you bless God this
[47:35] family that's not the scripture that's
[47:36] right I looked at him and I said I don't
[47:39] believe that no more
[47:45] because I knew I didn't have a leg to
[47:49] stand up he had given a simple
[47:53] illustration that concluded the story of
[47:58] all the scriptures and me a good Baptist
[48:00] deacon that had been trained and tutored
[48:03] and all of that into those things I was
[48:08] a human being that was looking at a man
[48:10] and said okay you know my hide to the
[48:12] wall man I don't have nowhere to go now
[48:15] explain it thank God I had somebody that
[48:22] could explain the scriptures not just
[48:25] somebody you got to believe it God sent
[48:27] a prophet if you don't believe God sent
[48:28] a prophet you gonna die and go to hell
[48:30] he never said that he started laying the
[48:35] scriptures down on me day in and day out
[48:39] he laid the scriptures went through the
[48:41] name I well remember them of how many
[48:46] times I had never noticed before then of
[48:48] how many times the word name was used in
[48:50] the Bible until that man started nailing
[48:53] me from every scripture from Genesis to
[48:56] Revelation about the name what are you
[49:02] getting that brother Dale I'm getting at
[49:03] one time when are we gonna believe what
[49:05] God has said to do his work not even
[49:10] able to understand it we had to believe
[49:15] it
[49:22] and to believe a prophet would come to
[49:25] explain God to you and I how wonderful
[49:30] he do it he'd go back before the world
[49:34] he said I've got this in my mind it
[49:37] stalled in my mind I said let's go back
[49:39] said we're looking over the banisters of
[49:41] heaven you don't remember all of those
[49:44] messages from that and he starts
[49:46] explaining the condescending of God to
[49:51] mankind he used the terms are words that
[49:57] the theologians used we yet he explained
[50:01] those things in simple terminology that
[50:07] I liked what he says on Christ a mystery
[50:11] of God revealed that the most illiterate
[50:13] person can be saved I like that you
[50:19] ain't gotta have this great be the
[50:20] education well does that know to be
[50:21] saved you just gotta have a brain
[50:25] that'll work just a little bit and a
[50:30] consciousness that can believe and
[50:33] accept it see their lifestyle swears
[50:40] based on it has been for quite a while
[50:43] now this is all the background and we'll
[50:47] get to the scriptures in a minute and
[50:48] Colossians and Hebrews and the thing but
[50:51] this is all the background to show you
[50:53] how prophet could tie all of that things
[50:56] together but yet sum it up in simple
[51:01] language there would be so marvelous
[51:08] until even if the Elohim couldn't argue
[51:10] with him well he didn't believe him now
[51:13] but he couldn't argue and he remember
[51:15] the the Godhead explained I believe the
[51:18] title of the message we listen to it
[51:20] just recently and we're brother Adam was
[51:22] talking to those guys and one man come
[51:24] out of it later on brought around
[51:25] telling it you know did he come out of
[51:27] it and said I want three hundred tapes
[51:29] I'm gonna take it to all of them and the
[51:31] preachers and things and give them out
[51:33] about
[51:34] you know about the water baptism he said
[51:38] never come back and go to one
[51:43] what about standing there why would it
[51:47] be such a problem
[51:50] you see that's where we don't we're not
[51:52] prophets it didn't change none of those
[52:01] people now according to him they didn't
[52:06] come back they never came back and got
[52:11] baptized name the Lord Jesus Christ when
[52:18] he put the scriptures he'd say the name
[52:21] of the Father he said we go back in the
[52:26] book and said we read it and said John
[52:28] and Mary
[52:28] he said we go back and we look and it
[52:33] says Father Son and Holy Ghost it's just
[52:39] one true and living God and he said
[52:42] that's just like you are a simplicity
[52:48] your father you're a son and you're a
[52:51] human you remember that one
[52:54] when rosemont nailed me with that and
[52:56] that said settle that part right there
[52:58] that that was too simple for me not to
[53:00] understand is that crazy enough to say
[53:02] it better work he's had it simple that I
[53:06] could follow it your prophet could
[53:09] explain the things that the theologians
[53:13] could never attempt in any form and he
[53:18] say out of the Father came the son he
[53:27] said now we're not we don't believe in
[53:29] eternal sonship for the Catholic charts
[53:32] now but said he was a son well father
[53:41] and son
[53:43] there's two of them
[53:48] they trying to express one God then we
[53:53] spent months waited spent months talking
[53:57] on Genesis 1:26 and 27 and try to
[54:00] understand and the Bible said let us
[54:02] make man in our image and notice he made
[54:08] a male and a female in his image because
[54:19] Eve was in Adam remember remember the
[54:22] quotes he was in Adam in theophany he
[54:27] said she was in that original creation
[54:29] for the one 26 and 27
[54:31] he said and she was in him in the
[54:34] literal creation because she was in his
[54:36] body
[54:40] see then the mind comes to comprehend
[54:44] well that would mean that had one
[54:46] theophany and see then that would throw
[54:54] the mind to pieces to try to understand
[54:59] then when the Prophet would come on
[55:01] later and he'd say or in that same quote
[55:06] and he said see he said God is the soul
[55:17] that's his soul that's he's a beating
[55:19] he's at the asana he's a person
[55:23] he's real city ain't like the wind
[55:25] blowing and said he created us in His
[55:30] image and said that man he created
[55:33] control the animals said see he was in
[55:41] theophany he said the man was theophany
[55:44] and he said see that's why he put a soul
[55:48] in a man that he didn't put in the
[55:50] animal he's because that soul in that
[55:54] man is that the offering
[56:00] now you got any better way of explaining
[56:03] that I'd love to hear it but you know
[56:08] what you're blinded your mind to and the
[56:10] biggest portion of people this message
[56:12] is blinded at that point they cannot
[56:15] follow a simple terminology that's a
[56:18] soul isn't theophany not the often he's
[56:21] up yonder not the often he's up yonder
[56:29] he's up in the heavens it's eternal
[56:39] I'm sorry to be a human being that
[56:43] instead of trying to figure something
[56:45] out I just said wait on God let me ask
[56:52] you a simple question what do you
[56:57] believe you sold you the oven there
[56:58] whatever it is what you what you believe
[57:00] yeah well see you believe that the soul
[57:06] is real the soul is what you are we went
[57:12] through the scriptures that you can't
[57:14] find the body of God in the Old
[57:16] Testament right because it was a human
[57:22] body but you can find the Spirit of God
[57:27] in the Old Testament and that or anoints
[57:30] people and can still even anoint and be
[57:33] anointed ones older than you whatever
[57:35] you're in but I ask you a simple
[57:38] question can you find the soul of God in
[57:42] the Old Testament because the soul is
[57:49] more real in the body in the spirit see
[57:58] do you listen to try to understand or
[58:01] listen to try to argue which is the
[58:04] point when we read that scripture in
[58:11] Corinthians I'll get to that point and
[58:13] we'll just say this but just let you
[58:16] look at what you're talking about in
[58:18] Corinthians where it comes from you know
[58:20] it says if this earthly tabernacle were
[58:24] dissolved we have one waiting is it
[58:34] waiting is it there waiting
[58:47] or is it there when you pass away which
[58:51] one is it
[58:54] when you pass away it can go die right
[59:01] if this earthly Tabernacle were you've
[59:05] done got to if to question your point
[59:07] you done got the word to establish that
[59:09] the only way you're gonna get dark
[59:11] I'm way you're gonna get to that point
[59:13] over there is to die alright didn't is
[59:23] that true for everybody we've got to
[59:29] admit its truth for everybody and
[59:33] everybody is standing here body spirit
[59:38] so they don't have somewhere to go to up
[59:42] there they have a place that's not dire
[59:48] until they die will you agree with that
[59:54] it is not art to you die so sinner
[1:00:02] what's the problem we say in the sinner
[1:00:07] and at the Alpha knee which is it so
[1:00:21] see there's more to that scripture than
[1:00:24] just thinking if there's earthly
[1:00:27] Tabernacle we're dissolved we have one
[1:00:29] waiting do have one waiting up there
[1:00:33] well it says it's waiting I'll remind
[1:00:38] you I have read 17 times in the
[1:00:47] beginning was the word the Word was with
[1:00:52] God we always talked that is being with
[1:01:01] God meant God was over here and
[1:01:03] someone's over here
[1:01:05] right I mean trinitarianism takes that
[1:01:08] right there's something over here
[1:01:10] there's something over here because it's
[1:01:12] with God but then we read that it says
[1:01:18] in the word what's God now that erases
[1:01:25] your thought of a God and another person
[1:01:31] if you listening and listening sensibly
[1:01:36] the autumn say that erase is that with
[1:01:39] don't so it don't mean one sitting here
[1:01:45] and one sitting here it means something
[1:01:52] took place that cannot be explained with
[1:01:56] human words and God saying in the
[1:02:00] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:02:02] with God
[1:02:04] that's not two people
[1:02:11] it's like your prophet will say let us
[1:02:17] make man showing him this last night
[1:02:21] the Bible said let us make my hand
[1:02:26] better brendham said he was talking to
[1:02:29] another being oh man you really build
[1:02:42] and you really can't comprehend when
[1:02:49] Jesus was standing here on earth praying
[1:02:52] to a father that was in heaven
[1:02:56] he's the noise in him no he was in
[1:02:59] heaven
[1:03:00] according to the Bible I know he was in
[1:03:04] him that's no problem but there was also
[1:03:06] something related what you see we just
[1:03:12] take what we want to think about instead
[1:03:17] of listening for God to express to us
[1:03:21] what are you saying so then a sinner has
[1:03:32] a place to go when he dies it ain't up
[1:03:37] there until he dies or over there or
[1:03:41] down there or wherever he goes so
[1:03:47] Christian doesn't have something up
[1:03:50] there waiting well that scripture then
[1:04:01] would apply to them
[1:04:02] everybody world in wouldn't it now let's
[1:04:07] see if you can follow that song how can
[1:04:10] it apply to everybody in the world when
[1:04:13] it's got some more words on the end of
[1:04:15] it this earthly time when I could wear
[1:04:17] this off we have one waiting eternal in
[1:04:22] the heavens
[1:04:23] mr. Bible that scripture is only talking
[1:04:29] of born-again Christian it don't change
[1:04:35] a thing he calls a sinner as a soul
[1:04:40] that's his being that's what he is he
[1:04:43] has a place to go we went over and over
[1:04:46] the Bible says spirits in prison right
[1:04:53] they don't say souls in prison since
[1:04:57] Paris in prison who was brother branham
[1:05:02] wrong when he said that spirit is soul
[1:05:06] and city spirit went back to God who
[1:05:10] gave it
[1:05:10] but said his soul went to hell city
[1:05:14] spirit couldn't go because that would
[1:05:17] mean God would be dying then we've been
[1:05:22] through these would you listening so
[1:05:30] everybody in the world is a body spirit
[1:05:34] and soul in everybody when they die as a
[1:05:40] place to go to let her run said once
[1:05:43] pulling you upward rug pulling downward
[1:05:45] one of the two you going somewhere
[1:05:48] but my point is is it dire before you
[1:05:53] get down no it's in you but brother you
[1:06:04] you seem to think so
[1:06:06] it's just like me you tell me why not
[1:06:09] what am I not thinking that if you could
[1:06:15] see my soul you'd be seeing me numb
[1:06:18] about getting the scripture with it when
[1:06:21] that what Jesus said didn't Jesus say if
[1:06:25] you've seen me you've seen the father
[1:06:30] so was the father looked like see that's
[1:06:35] why I love the message
[1:06:37] the father looked like the Sun right
[1:06:40] father is not an old man with a beard
[1:06:43] and a son the young man so if it's right
[1:06:49] and Jesus is right if you've seen me
[1:06:51] you've seen the father so the father and
[1:06:53] the son looks identical why because they
[1:06:54] are the same person
[1:06:57] that simple and see what I love about
[1:07:06] the message now let's take the message
[1:07:08] through that little point right there
[1:07:09] let's just take the message of that
[1:07:11] little point and to see what we've had
[1:07:14] brought to our benefit that people just
[1:07:18] life that's you about it I preached over
[1:07:24] and over and over how real God was
[1:07:26] before the world message after message
[1:07:30] of how real he was to get us away from
[1:07:34] that God is the spirit and the spirit
[1:07:38] don't hide don't fall into it it's just
[1:07:39] mr. spirit my spirit in an animal has a
[1:07:45] form you ever heard this one well
[1:07:49] brother Hiles gonna like sister cleaner
[1:07:53] probably ready knowing I doubt if in the
[1:07:56] rest if you'd know it you take a horse
[1:08:02] higher and put it in water and it'll
[1:08:07] move when you touch it did you know that
[1:08:15] I'm gonna have to get too tight with
[1:08:17] listening to the other night cuz it what
[1:08:19] brother I'm saying I'll be glad to give
[1:08:21] it he said you put a horsehair in the
[1:08:25] water and touch it it'll move he said be
[1:08:29] cause now listen to it he said because
[1:08:32] it is a spirit higher spirit well that's
[1:08:41] what he says that's what I'm saying see
[1:08:46] in old timers old enough with life ask
[1:08:49] you about it cuz I remember it
[1:08:51] I remember saying something one time
[1:08:53] with dinner that meeting in maislin and
[1:08:55] her brother dawn run was once talking
[1:08:57] about it said talking about sugar tits
[1:08:59] well this old man he if we did not
[1:09:02] nobody else in the meeting but they have
[1:09:03] old man that old man was sitting there
[1:09:05] and when he said sugar tits
[1:09:07] he just started dying laughing you know
[1:09:10] what he knows what it was it was coffee
[1:09:14] with sugar in it and putting the rag and
[1:09:17] give it to the baby you know different
[1:09:20] for different ways but it was okay we've
[1:09:24] had a profit nota lot okay but listen
[1:09:28] let's take a simple illustration and
[1:09:33] follow that illustration through to see
[1:09:38] that our soul is what you really are and
[1:09:45] if you die it's your soul going
[1:09:47] somewhere it's not you going to a soul
[1:09:50] or another body it's your soul that
[1:09:53] leaves this body I mean over and over
[1:09:57] and over it we're giving you the quote
[1:09:59] from brother Branham saying Jesus his
[1:10:01] soul went to hell - preach - this souls
[1:10:08] in prison when the Bible had called his
[1:10:12] spirits in prison but yet Brethren
[1:10:18] called it souls and Princeton and those
[1:10:23] people that were especially when he come
[1:10:26] into paradise they're coming back up
[1:10:31] Abraham said Sarah come here that's the
[1:10:36] man we fed the cave - what do you look
[1:10:41] like
[1:10:45] said you've seen me you've seen the
[1:10:48] father the father and the son looks at
[1:10:49] identical alive then why are you life
[1:10:52] and the people on the tapes and I why
[1:10:54] would you life in any way of saying that
[1:10:57] brother Branham says the closest thing
[1:11:02] picture of Christ is Hoffman's so what
[1:11:06] does garden look like the closest thing
[1:11:09] we can see of Hoffman's that's what he
[1:11:14] looks like you remember when he raised
[1:11:24] what was wrong with Mary the reason she
[1:11:26] didn't recognize because you didn't read
[1:11:29] her an old man with bloody proof
[1:11:30] commencement I'm blood all over him
[1:11:32] he's raised as a young man stand she
[1:11:36] thought he was a gardener he wouldn't
[1:11:38] all bloody and beat-up and scarred up he
[1:11:42] was in a glorified state or some way
[1:11:45] transforming because the scripture
[1:11:47] covers it why would you make light of
[1:11:51] somebody thinking that their guard looks
[1:11:53] like Hoffman's Hoffman caught something
[1:11:56] and painted it
[1:11:57] I thank Joe for doing this other one I
[1:12:00] told you we're gonna put a picture up on
[1:12:02] this other side over here and be
[1:12:03] different you know and and I hope you
[1:12:06] see what's over here is that 33 picture
[1:12:11] in boost into work the pillar fire
[1:12:15] coming down the angels of God and things
[1:12:17] you know like the brother preached last
[1:12:20] night and today see that's mean
[1:12:22] something personal to me it means that
[1:12:27] we know what God looks like now you have
[1:12:33] something that comes up to you and some
[1:12:35] kind of thing in the middle of the night
[1:12:37] and it's all twisted up where it says
[1:12:39] I'm God bow down and worship me now
[1:12:43] you've got a right to say get out of
[1:12:45] here you ugly mug no you don't look God
[1:12:48] don't look like that would just be
[1:12:50] careful about the one that can
[1:12:52] impersonate how close he can get listen
[1:12:56] nobody's got to say to you
[1:13:03] what does it know what are you getting
[1:13:05] at okay if you can believe that your
[1:13:11] soul is the real you and it regardless
[1:13:17] whether your Center assigned don't lay
[1:13:21] no difference
[1:13:22] the minute you die you step into a body
[1:13:29] not step into a body like stepping it's
[1:13:32] the body that goes huh
[1:13:36] it's the soul of the individual it is
[1:13:40] your theophany let's see it's easy to
[1:13:44] think about guarding the theophany I've
[1:13:47] been very very careful to make sure it
[1:13:50] stated correctly
[1:13:51] a sinner's theophany is not eternal
[1:13:56] no that's it so that's his being he said
[1:14:02] well if you've seen a theophany of a
[1:14:04] sinner what would you say you ain't
[1:14:07] gonna make no doctor or not ever but he
[1:14:10] could be as old as mud he could be 90
[1:14:12] years old you could see him cuz you had
[1:14:19] no right to connection to anything of
[1:14:22] eternal life so whatever he looks like
[1:14:25] that's what he'd be you know but to a
[1:14:30] Christian see if some way God could pull
[1:14:37] from me and stand my theophany here you
[1:14:40] wouldn't see a 77 year old man why
[1:14:44] because I have the connection to eternal
[1:14:48] life that's the one thing it's been the
[1:14:51] hardest thing for me to try to get
[1:14:53] people to see see me you see we don't
[1:14:56] have to wait till we get some words out
[1:14:58] a sinner has to wait officials you even
[1:15:06] has to wait to oh when I was cute they
[1:15:10] got to feel silly Old Testament
[1:15:12] they got fished a little technical Old
[1:15:16] Testament Saints that didn't raise and
[1:15:18] things back there goes the Bible said
[1:15:20] all of them denied they have no right to
[1:15:25] any form of eternal life they have to be
[1:15:28] given eternal life but the day you're
[1:15:34] born again your soul is just as eternal
[1:15:40] as God is because God has imparted to
[1:15:44] you into your soul that at that time
[1:15:50] would be 75 say to me in listening
[1:15:57] listen close if I wasn't born again my
[1:16:02] soul that looked just like I am right
[1:16:07] but today I'm born again that soul
[1:16:12] becomes eternal and there is my real
[1:16:16] theophany because it's theophany simply
[1:16:21] means a body a body for you to go to
[1:16:23] when you die when you step out of this
[1:16:28] one you step into that one but to catch
[1:16:31] up it is to everybody but the bride the
[1:16:38] bride steps into eternal life here we
[1:16:40] don't have to fool with thinking about a
[1:16:42] body eternal in the heavens
[1:16:46] here's the heavens heavenly places is
[1:16:50] right here in your being today so you
[1:16:59] may be 70 years old if you're a
[1:17:02] born-again believer that soul is eternal
[1:17:07] it's already in the image of what it was
[1:17:12] supposed to be so your soul is your
[1:17:17] theophany it's your soul
[1:17:27] and the soul is more real than either
[1:17:30] they don't say this body or spirit
[1:17:32] that's in he said the soul that sinneth
[1:17:33] it shall die cuz that's the real you but
[1:17:38] get the difference we don't have to wait
[1:17:41] now I'm not throwing off on nobody but
[1:17:44] then you know yourself he was back there
[1:17:45] and listen let's Baptist which preach
[1:17:48] there's none good no not one one week
[1:17:50] and the next week we preached be
[1:17:52] therefore perfect one time we'd have
[1:17:54] everybody in heaven by the time we'd
[1:17:56] have everybody inhale come we would know
[1:17:58] and we say I hope we'll say to believers
[1:18:00] say maybe I'm saved
[1:18:02] oh I'm saved I want my confession to be
[1:18:05] I'm saved
[1:18:07] he's like I say you say I'm healed I got
[1:18:13] cancer but I'm healed
[1:18:15] I want you to know I'm healed you'll go
[1:18:18] pretty good for a little while the
[1:18:20] matter a while you don't whip that
[1:18:22] cancer you'll start saying well you know
[1:18:25] I believe I better go to the doctor
[1:18:27] bruise you didn't have faith to start
[1:18:30] with get a mental conception most
[1:18:34] Christianity is based on a mental
[1:18:37] conception that's why they're not born
[1:18:43] again it's just a confession but the
[1:18:46] Bible says brother do if I confess with
[1:18:49] my mouth and believe in my heart that
[1:18:51] I'm saying yes if you mean it if it's
[1:18:57] real as the brother said if it went that
[1:19:00] foot down from the head down into the
[1:19:03] soul and then it's real but if it don't
[1:19:08] you just as lost as you ever were
[1:19:16] see
[1:19:20] the soul is where you go when you leave
[1:19:23] here death takes you there you go to a
[1:19:29] place one way or the other brother
[1:19:34] Randall my love the way says thing he
[1:19:36] said held not even held tonight right
[1:19:38] now fire burning inside he says just to
[1:19:40] follow their way you know there's
[1:19:43] something are for keep you but to a
[1:19:47] Christian his soul is already eternal
[1:19:52] your born-again Christian you're so he's
[1:19:55] just as eternal his guardian why because
[1:19:58] God's life come in and made your soul
[1:20:01] eternal God like to Adam breathe into
[1:20:07] your nostrils in the new birth the
[1:20:12] breath of eternal law I said like a head
[1:20:19] of God we'll get back to him he said
[1:20:21] yeah but I came time don't worry about
[1:20:23] it he's got his place you're not in the
[1:20:27] body of Christ these are for the reason
[1:20:29] yeah but listen he said well what are
[1:20:33] you talking about I'm talking about one
[1:20:35] time your prophet said one day if it
[1:20:43] wasn't for the fact of a holding power
[1:20:45] some way he said you did speak a world
[1:20:48] into existence and go to it never that
[1:20:51] one now you started going wrong he did
[1:20:54] speak a world existence and go God he
[1:20:57] said we can't be done would you know
[1:21:01] what he told it right did he say you
[1:21:08] don't have the power to create a world
[1:21:10] he didn't say that he said the power is
[1:21:16] there but it's controlled by how a
[1:21:19] higher power to keep you from speaking
[1:21:22] it
[1:21:29] when I finish the message I hope you see
[1:21:31] one time I hope you see one time for
[1:21:38] certain if you have eternal life that
[1:21:41] eternal life was always has been and
[1:21:45] always will be the Creator that's why
[1:21:52] you have a right to speak the word come
[1:22:00] on are we in the scripts the scripts you
[1:22:02] don't say if God says to the mountain
[1:22:06] he's brought around say you're a little
[1:22:08] Creator don't lose me now way to the end
[1:22:14] of the thought to where we can find out
[1:22:17] something so we went through all of the
[1:22:21] things it's a prophet gave talking about
[1:22:26] the soul was the first thing that God
[1:22:29] created it was the soul and he said he
[1:22:35] created the one twenty six twenty seven
[1:22:37] million that's what he created but it
[1:22:44] was a one person point standing there we
[1:22:49] went up there is a little bitty spots
[1:22:51] identities her anything we went over and
[1:22:54] over it we were in Jesus Christ and if
[1:23:04] we wasn't in Jesus Christ we never will
[1:23:06] pay true alright
[1:23:15] think about it something brother branham
[1:23:17] saying he said god's first creation was
[1:23:24] himself
[1:23:25] you remember that quote boy that blows
[1:23:29] the mind knowing that God's first
[1:23:30] creation is himself well he created him
[1:23:39] there's another one of them with you
[1:23:43] know Word was with God
[1:23:47] you still got see two thoughts clear it
[1:23:51] down to one
[1:23:57] there is no scripture now watch it when
[1:24:02] we get to it in a minute
[1:24:03] there is no scripture about the father
[1:24:06] creating it stipulates who the Creator
[1:24:15] is because is keeping it right but
[1:24:19] there's no scripture that says the
[1:24:21] father don't create well because the
[1:24:26] father and the sons of self same person
[1:24:30] it's his form these years but you know
[1:24:35] yourself that I've tried to explain over
[1:24:38] and over for 40 years people say all God
[1:24:41] was he poured in the crotch all Christ
[1:24:42] in the church take her back to the
[1:24:44] Garden of Eden I see you don't realize
[1:24:47] what you're saying
[1:24:50] her sermon Ida sermon all means all it
[1:24:54] means every time all is all within oh
[1:25:01] god was he poured into Christ but ain't
[1:25:04] no God no more he only exists in Christ
[1:25:08] he's that rod that's what you're reading
[1:25:13] the scripture there's a quote from the
[1:25:15] Prophet you know Christ is poured in the
[1:25:18] church sweet Christ anymore he's got
[1:25:20] Church well I think about that
[1:25:27] well what'd you think about Oh God pour
[1:25:31] it into Christ
[1:25:33] you ain't got no God no it's all in
[1:25:36] Christ and all Christ pour it in the
[1:25:39] church you got no Christ no more so you
[1:25:43] only got Church
[1:25:44] well you're silly I agree we would you
[1:25:48] think about that is what I said true
[1:25:53] you've just done away
[1:25:55] you see God don't do that I tried my
[1:25:57] best to get the brothers years ago some
[1:26:00] of them here even argued with me about
[1:26:02] it I said just please do one time
[1:26:06] whatever you do with the condescending
[1:26:08] of God don't do away with anything
[1:26:12] because the more God condescends
[1:26:15] downward the greater he is the more in
[1:26:20] manifestation he is as he conned us in
[1:26:24] down it's not doing away with he's
[1:26:27] condescending down word to you and I she
[1:26:34] didn't don't just take the father and do
[1:26:36] away with him and put him in the son
[1:26:38] brother I didn't say that he said a part
[1:26:43] of God went out called a son he said in
[1:26:53] that son was the logos with the often II
[1:26:57] the speech now you'll see why it says
[1:27:02] Jesus Christ created all things but just
[1:27:08] don't do away with anything in the
[1:27:09] father don't be that narrow-minded I say
[1:27:15] that for my heart of love it understand
[1:27:17] it don't be so narrow-minded till you
[1:27:21] said well cuz you got the same thing you
[1:27:23] said in the beginning was the word Word
[1:27:25] was with God so I mean there's two of
[1:27:28] them cuz it's with in brenna random
[1:27:31] would say let us make man he says he he
[1:27:35] was talking to another being
[1:27:41] you know stride
[1:27:49] father decided not to people these two
[1:27:54] manifestations not people are
[1:27:56] personalities it's manifestation so in
[1:28:02] the beginning as I preached to you over
[1:28:04] and over and over the great eternal God
[1:28:06] all those attributes all those things
[1:28:09] back before the world ever begun he was
[1:28:12] the great eternal the divine said a part
[1:28:17] went out he said a son of God
[1:28:18] he said God has stepped over in another
[1:28:21] form
[1:28:22] now did he step over to empty up a place
[1:28:25] back here those you'll never understand
[1:28:31] why Jesus would stand on this earth and
[1:28:34] say my Father which art in heaven he
[1:28:43] said what was he doing he was
[1:28:46] communicating he was communicating
[1:28:54] alright here is the father before the
[1:28:58] world all the attributes all the things
[1:29:00] we covered I told you we get to the
[1:29:03] Creator eventually don't do away with
[1:29:08] the father just leave it leave it
[1:29:11] that all you thinking that leave it but
[1:29:14] out of the father comes the same God in
[1:29:19] another form it don't do away with that
[1:29:22] goddess back there it don't do away with
[1:29:26] that father it just makes a way to bring
[1:29:32] it into manifestation and he brings in
[1:29:35] that he called him he said out of the
[1:29:37] father came to son now the son was the
[1:29:41] low-cost at the Alpha knee to create
[1:29:50] and that we were back there with him
[1:29:56] come anymore you won't I still got a lot
[1:29:58] to read if you want we were back dire
[1:30:02] when he created man as a soul not as
[1:30:06] many souls he created one soul are
[1:30:10] stepped over in the form of a soul he
[1:30:13] didn't create it he didn't create a Sun
[1:30:18] it was whatever was needed from God
[1:30:24] stepped over into another form to make
[1:30:28] his plan come to pass
[1:30:33] you remember how he gave the little
[1:30:35] drawing that we covered it with two
[1:30:40] lines in two parts and see brother
[1:30:45] Branham said the first thing God created
[1:30:48] was angels Missy angels had a beginning
[1:30:56] angels are not eternal they're
[1:31:01] ministering spirits made to minister
[1:31:03] under the heirs of salvation they got a
[1:31:05] job that's why they could shout like
[1:31:08] everything when they knew what God was
[1:31:10] gonna do and he was gonna come forth and
[1:31:14] human flesh himself and walk on this
[1:31:17] earth just don't do all they were the
[1:31:22] father just leave it alone
[1:31:26] yeah but I can't see a father Darden
[1:31:28] shun over here you better be able to see
[1:31:33] something because if not you sure our
[1:31:35] Trinity but if you didn't let God just
[1:31:41] stay where he's at and then you can have
[1:31:44] him to step over into another form to be
[1:31:48] the create taller all things were made
[1:31:51] by the word right
[1:31:57] and that word is the eternal God that
[1:32:05] word is the eternal God the word created
[1:32:13] all things Jesus didn't create all the
[1:32:18] time the father didn't create all things
[1:32:24] he moved over into another form called a
[1:32:27] son son and father can communicate why
[1:32:34] can't you see where he said let us make
[1:32:35] man let me use it this way first we
[1:32:38] won't trick your mind word and spirit
[1:32:41] are one when he said let us make man
[1:32:46] that was exactly right go listen did he
[1:32:51] make the man now listen
[1:32:54] did he make the man plural - no but
[1:33:02] inside of him was - there's the image of
[1:33:07] God the plural the plurality that's why
[1:33:10] man can't understand it it looks like
[1:33:15] there's many gods good it looks like
[1:33:18] pluralities when he made man in his own
[1:33:25] image he made a male and a female in his
[1:33:30] image but his first creation was angels
[1:33:39] and they worshipped him he become God
[1:33:43] now you come to Genesis 1 now you got in
[1:33:47] Genesis 1 it says God created all the
[1:33:50] things God created all the times ok then
[1:34:02] it says the Genesis 1:1 in the beginning
[1:34:06] God created heaven in there this is 1:26
[1:34:11] and God said let us make man in our
[1:34:14] image us make man in our that sounds
[1:34:23] like plurality doesn't it sounds like -
[1:34:29] it is in one way because it's father and
[1:34:32] son remember the point now leave the
[1:34:40] father would let something step over or
[1:34:43] whatever you want to call it form change
[1:34:44] with it then you step over in another
[1:34:46] form and begin to create and call it a
[1:34:49] son that's what your prophet did he said
[1:34:53] he's like a child playing before the
[1:34:55] father's door and said he said let her
[1:34:58] be
[1:34:58] they just flung out a world who we read
[1:35:06] in Genesis says God we read in Genesis
[1:35:12] 1:26 it says God
[1:35:15] 1:27 so God created man in his own image
[1:35:18] Malachi 2 and 10 hath not one God
[1:35:25] created us what is that smell co2 it
[1:35:31] t-half not one God created us so they
[1:35:36] were one God neighbor one God one
[1:35:38] creator mark when he comes over in at 13
[1:35:42] and 18 or 19 beginning of the creation
[1:35:48] was God created unto this time God crea
[1:36:00] john wong says in the beginning was the
[1:36:03] word word with god and the word was god
[1:36:05] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:36:07] all things were made by him and without
[1:36:13] him was not anything made that was made
[1:36:18] Colossians 1 in 13 who had delivered us
[1:36:22] from the power of darkness and that's
[1:36:25] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:36:27] dear son in whom we have redemption
[1:36:30] through his blood even the forgiveness
[1:36:32] of sins who is the image of the
[1:36:35] invisible God the firstborn of every
[1:36:37] creature for by him the firstborn of
[1:36:44] every creature we're sons and daughters
[1:36:49] by Jesus was we come by Spoken and Jesus
[1:36:56] come right straight he not to be spoken
[1:36:59] he was that just moved in another form
[1:37:02] for by him we're all things made that
[1:37:05] are in heaven and that are in earth
[1:37:06] visible visible and invisible whether
[1:37:09] they be Thrones or dominions or
[1:37:11] principalities or powers all things were
[1:37:14] created by him and for him who's he
[1:37:17] talking about Hebrews 1 God who at
[1:37:23] sundry times and divers manners spake in
[1:37:25] time past unto the father's by the
[1:37:27] prophets has in these last days now
[1:37:31] we're getting closer to what we want
[1:37:32] right spoken unto us by his son I mean
[1:37:38] reading his Christian getting closer to
[1:37:43] where we won't come in with Jesus Christ
[1:37:44] now let's he has in these last days
[1:37:48] spoken unto us by his son whom he hath
[1:37:52] appointed heir of all things by whom
[1:37:54] also he made the world's revelation 4:10
[1:38:02] the four and twenty elders fall down
[1:38:04] before him they said on the throne and
[1:38:07] worship Him that liveth forever and ever
[1:38:09] and cast their crowns before the throne
[1:38:11] saying thou art were
[1:38:14] the O Lord to receive glory and honor
[1:38:17] and power where thou has created all
[1:38:20] things and for thy pleasure they are and
[1:38:26] were created one God now we get to the
[1:38:33] good when it's anchors it down right
[1:38:35] Ephesians three and nine to make all men
[1:38:38] see what is the fellowship with a
[1:38:40] mystery which from the beginning of the
[1:38:43] world has been hidden God who created
[1:38:47] all things but Jesus Christ who's the
[1:38:54] creator not a god the son the son of God
[1:39:06] we don't use God the Son God that
[1:39:09] doesn't work right it's the son of God
[1:39:12] we don't believe in eternal sonship we
[1:39:16] believe in the eternal God ship no
[1:39:19] quoting rid of random so what happened
[1:39:23] our leave the father existing where he's
[1:39:26] at and let a part of God as a prophet
[1:39:30] said come out and would be called a son
[1:39:33] lo gosh theophany word and let him speak
[1:39:39] when he stood on this earth Peter said
[1:39:48] the greatest thing who demands Jesus to
[1:39:52] Peter who do men see how the son of man
[1:39:55] he said thou art the Christ the Son of
[1:39:59] the Living God
[1:40:02] he said Jesus you created all things
[1:40:07] that's what he's just saying all things
[1:40:12] were made by Jesus Christ so in Genesis
[1:40:15] it was the word that spoke you said let
[1:40:19] there be and created the world it was
[1:40:22] the word that spoke and said let's make
[1:40:25] man in her own image community
[1:40:27] getting back to the father how do we
[1:40:29] make him don't ever lose that
[1:40:33] communication because you're going to
[1:40:36] get out of the scripture because when
[1:40:38] Jesus then came to earth he prayed to
[1:40:42] the Father he said that was just the
[1:40:46] flesh wasn't it was it just a flesh
[1:40:53] wound would he say now there's my soul
[1:40:55] trouble yet for this cause I can't one
[1:41:02] true and living God he Jesus was the
[1:41:07] word according John 1:14 wot and the
[1:41:11] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:41:17] the Son of God was back there
[1:41:20] not his sonship as another person the
[1:41:25] back door is a part of God they would
[1:41:29] come forward to be the Creator or their
[1:41:35] quote the Prophet Jesus never come to
[1:41:38] give us an inheritance he come to pay
[1:41:40] the price the inheritance was eternal
[1:41:43] life before the foundation of the world
[1:41:44] right okay so he was in him before the
[1:41:50] world he was chosen are you listening
[1:41:58] see then if God is in you in the new
[1:42:02] birth why would you worry about mark 11
[1:42:08] in that mark 11 work is youth if you say
[1:42:12] to this mountain he says it doesn't say
[1:42:17] if God says it if you say do you realize
[1:42:24] what I'm saying you have within you the
[1:42:28] eternal God that created the world
[1:42:32] because listen the lies creation
[1:42:38] of mankind you remember was why that
[1:42:45] they kept calling Jesus on a man got
[1:42:48] around and said the only way he could be
[1:42:50] father was to become the son of man that
[1:42:54] son of man stood on this earth and sewed
[1:42:58] the children of the kingdom
[1:43:00] you remember that message preached a
[1:43:02] couple of messages on it that that word
[1:43:05] from the Son of Man
[1:43:08] so de-seed
[1:43:18] Jesus stood on earth right before his
[1:43:22] ascension he made a mighty statement he
[1:43:29] breathed on the disciples and said
[1:43:33] receive ye the Holy Ghost but around
[1:43:37] takes that spoken word and reading the
[1:43:38] seat
[1:43:39] he says bribed borned by the breath of
[1:43:43] God you realize he sold you he sold you
[1:43:55] he called your name sister Cathy went
[1:43:58] back dire when he was walking the shores
[1:44:00] of Galilee he sold you into being from
[1:44:07] that one that was back there coming down
[1:44:09] now to a multiple form and they went to
[1:44:13] Pentecost and received the Holy Ghost
[1:44:15] and it made their souls eternal because
[1:44:18] when he said he breathed on them the
[1:44:20] prophet said it he said that was a
[1:44:23] promise they didn't get the Holy Ghost
[1:44:26] right then
[1:44:26] why cause Jesus hadn't died he said that
[1:44:29] was a promise he said bride born by the
[1:44:32] word of God
[1:44:33] he said the promise now can I back up to
[1:44:41] another message when we preach that Adam
[1:44:44] and Eve was told multiply and replenish
[1:44:49] the earth they would have brought forth
[1:44:54] the spiritual mankind had sin not
[1:44:59] entered they would have brought forth by
[1:45:03] the spoken word human bodies for us to
[1:45:06] lived in had there been no sin but now
[1:45:08] here's where you're going so you lose
[1:45:10] the me right there because you're not
[1:45:12] listening I'm quoting brother Branham to
[1:45:15] the tee and you're not listening because
[1:45:17] your mind says it can't be no other way
[1:45:19] because sin was already there the tree
[1:45:21] of knowledge was dying in the garden I
[1:45:23] got a sense I know that but your prophet
[1:45:27] said that it was an ongoing
[1:45:31] Commission or Adam and Eve till multiply
[1:45:39] to replenish the earth
[1:45:43] okay this read this and come on
[1:45:46] musicians with you see I keep a lot of
[1:45:50] notes but they don't never get to people
[1:45:55] don't internet at least they get him off
[1:45:58] the message the spoken word is original
[1:46:00] seed paragraph 53 and 54 Adams bride
[1:46:04] could not wait God had told Adam and Eve
[1:46:08] multiply and replenish the earth it was
[1:46:12] an oncoming thing a promise
[1:46:19] see you could wait when words regional
[1:46:29] seed 7576 if God said multiply to the
[1:46:33] bride to Adams bride and replenish
[1:46:36] multiply and replace their that was
[1:46:38] God's Commission and she would have done
[1:46:42] it but she couldn't wait she hybrid it
[1:46:49] he said she would have done it both
[1:46:55] words original seed paragraph 1 47 Jesus
[1:46:59] coming that seed he proved it everything
[1:47:02] that Adam lost Jesus was and he is the
[1:47:05] correct Eve would have finally brought
[1:47:08] that crop child forth but she hybrid but
[1:47:17] words regional seed forgot 160 162 if
[1:47:23] Eve would have have brought forth that
[1:47:26] child she would have finally done it
[1:47:33] did not God tell her multiply and
[1:47:37] replenish but she couldn't wait
[1:47:43] you maybe thought I was crazy too saying
[1:47:45] that we're born by spiritual
[1:47:46] multiplication marriage and divorce
[1:47:49] paragraph 230 know this ye said to Adam
[1:47:54] before sex was ever in induced or
[1:47:57] introduced multiply and replenish the
[1:48:01] earth when he was yet in the beginning
[1:48:04] when he was yet both male and female in
[1:48:07] himself dark shows then that the bride
[1:48:10] has got to come from the word by
[1:48:13] spiritual multiplication that's why you
[1:48:17] got to have a preacher you gotta have
[1:48:19] somebody bring it to you come on I don't
[1:48:21] do it all the way you sister's supposed
[1:48:24] to speak to each other
[1:48:25] so let's don't run all the garbage the
[1:48:28] sisters speak to the sisters they can
[1:48:30] carry the gospel right you believe that
[1:48:36] the women will say Amen but didn't do
[1:48:38] away with a thoughtful ministry that's
[1:48:40] all right
[1:48:41] no problem you ain't gonna do away with
[1:48:43] my job
[1:48:45] mine was settled before the world ever
[1:48:48] becoming now I hope you listen to what
[1:48:51] I'm saying with one final point if you
[1:48:54] will leave and not bring all of God over
[1:48:57] to the next forum and then dump you ball
[1:49:00] over the next phone if you'll just
[1:49:02] simply leave the father and let a part
[1:49:08] of him move over and be the son the
[1:49:10] logos the theophany the creator and then
[1:49:14] you can see why Jesus would stand on
[1:49:18] this earth and pray my father or your
[1:49:23] father he's the same one and he prayed
[1:49:30] that will be done in earth
[1:49:37] he was still praying to the Father
[1:49:40] well now you got it ready again no he's
[1:49:46] praying back to the original because
[1:49:48] that way then listen when the word is
[1:49:52] revealed to you and there's quickened
[1:49:54] the word and the spirit are one so when
[1:50:02] it says let us make man you know who
[1:50:04] that was back there they said that
[1:50:05] father to son mother son said let us
[1:50:10] make man that's not Trinitarian Israel
[1:50:14] it's communication between because I'm
[1:50:18] gonna finish it with what the Prophet
[1:50:20] said when they asked him the question
[1:50:21] about Jesus pray unto the father he said
[1:50:24] who do you pray to who do you pray to do
[1:50:31] you have to pray out loud is he up
[1:50:34] somewhere well no you can just talk to
[1:50:40] him quietly can't you not in the middle
[1:50:42] of the night and see I can go through
[1:50:48] the my house and I say father thank you
[1:50:51] so who are you referring to I'm referred
[1:50:55] to my father
[1:50:56] so now I know who is that he's waiting
[1:51:01] on us to finish this route and then the
[1:51:07] bible says that the son himself shall
[1:51:12] become subject that God may be all in
[1:51:20] all when you're standing there didn't
[1:51:27] you see him as he is you will see Jesus
[1:51:33] but who's the Hall at all he's in all
[1:51:40] standing there but he's in are all
[1:51:42] standing there with him
[1:51:43] cuz that's his children
[1:51:47] Nestene well we got rid the create or is
[1:51:58] still here you still here with us God's
[1:52:22] attributes were manifested to his bride
[1:52:26] in this last stage we have
[1:52:32] nice profits message God Seneca
[1:52:37] would you listen to it he'd explain an
[1:52:41] eternal God to a human element of a
[1:52:47] human
[1:52:49] [Music]
[1:52:53] I thought that what to me the message
[1:52:56] was done for God
[1:53:00] and revealing
[1:53:02] [Music]
