[0:00] who is if when we get to this study will
[0:05] do some more on the Sun man try to get
[0:09] it finished and then you start on the
[0:11] side of Davy but when we start on us
[0:12] under David and start doing the statute
[0:14] I mean we start doing down 70 weeks we
[0:18] may start about 10 minutes till and just
[0:21] have a small scripture reading before so
[0:24] everybody try to get in here so we can
[0:27] have some time recent reason being out
[0:29] of water run down 70 weeks to six months
[0:32] I would like to have about 40 minutes of
[0:35] ever sending to kind of get into the
[0:38] deck of the of the dates and the times
[0:41] and all that and breaking down because
[0:45] it does have something to do with son
[0:46] David he can't settle his throne until
[0:48] the seventy weeks of Daniel is finished
[0:50] so that's the restoration of Israel you
[0:52] can't set on that throne until Israel is
[0:54] restored everybody got that again
[1:03] 29 work your magic and my mind all the
[1:14] time well well when the wicked are
[1:17] multiplied transgression increases with
[1:20] garages shall see their fault that's
[1:22] exactly what we're going to do we're
[1:23] going to bible said we're going to walk
[1:24] out on the ashes of the wicked look at
[1:27] center carcass right the righteous will
[1:29] see the wicked back to stop no it says
[1:33] here look but do not just shall see
[1:35] their way to the wicked ok now we're not
[1:40] going to laugh at it or we're not going
[1:42] to we're not going to be haughty about
[1:44] it or will be part of it awaited you all
[1:47] right we'll we'll probably mourn for
[1:51] those people but but there comes a point
[1:55] in time to wear when when judgment said
[1:57] you know a natural judge probably in his
[2:01] mind wanders when he gets finished with
[2:02] the case if he gets finished pronouncing
[2:06] judgment as a human he has feelings did
[2:10] I do the right thing did we make the
[2:12] right judgment but remember when God
[2:14] said that's it that's the only judgment
[2:16] there is so we must be satisfy them that
[2:18] if they were judged transgression and
[2:22] create the wicked when we see them fall
[2:25] we're not going to be well look at us
[2:28] but with no we're going to look at what
[2:30] Jesus Christ did for us and be happy in
[2:33] him but we must also have the
[2:36] consolation that that judgment was with
[2:39] perfect so we don't have a thought in
[2:43] our minds him what I'll make no no that
[2:46] that Judge he's the righteous judge the
[2:49] Bible says and he judges right every
[2:50] time so so there's no we can have
[2:55] consolation that he didn't make a
[2:57] mistake see we might not have a
[3:00] consolation that are a real judge he may
[3:03] make a mistake than they have before
[3:04] because we're
[3:05] and bend but not all mighty can't make a
[3:07] mistake remember he judged it's before
[3:10] the foundation of the world this is just
[3:11] happening out now and he already has
[3:14] made ice was I was thinking I got to
[3:18] about three o'clock yesterday morning
[3:20] then go back sleep so I went sat down
[3:22] read few scriptures but most of the time
[3:24] I think oh you know some of y'all made
[3:26] pray or or read your Bible or read I I'm
[3:30] like run probably around at the house
[3:32] yesterday he said when I put on a sermon
[3:34] and I'm driving down the road he said I
[3:36] get sleepy so if you want to go to sleep
[3:38] start reading the message book it's not
[3:40] reading the Bible I'll guarantee you'll
[3:41] call clean but if you'll sit there just
[3:45] constantly let things run in your mind
[3:46] and that's what I was running in my mind
[3:48] you know about the Word of God I don't
[3:53] think we see that this word of god is so
[3:54] perfect because if a guy in a brother
[3:58] and Africa he needs a certain scripture
[4:00] to come to the war what God had it in
[4:02] the Bible in 66 books of the Bible
[4:05] billions of people are going to be saved
[4:07] by certain sections of that body your
[4:10] friends have what I'm saying then you're
[4:12] perfected by the whole bottle if I got
[4:15] that see you come in with one scripture
[4:18] maybe right you come in with one
[4:21] spiritual but then you're perfected by
[4:23] the whole Bible well all the saints that
[4:25] are going to be perfected are going to
[4:27] be perfected five what's in that bottle
[4:29] right there every word that's my brother
[4:31] Graham said every word and if I was
[4:33] exactly correct God saw what we need so
[4:36] we put it in writing perfect writing so
[4:41] that every individual that makes it to
[4:43] heaven I even foolish virgins even a cup
[4:46] of water is going to one identify with
[4:49] what what's in the Bible so all
[4:52] salvation all Redemption everything was
[4:54] written in this 66 books of the Bible
[4:56] for the billions of people it's going to
[4:58] make it to heaven that's why my brother
[5:00] brother Graham could say that's the
[5:02] Eternal Word of God now he's not going
[5:05] to be the Eternal Word of God written
[5:08] we're not going to do see like we take
[5:10] the Declaration of Endor
[5:11] in it and we put it up in the in the
[5:14] Hall of Justice there in wherever in
[5:16] Pennsylvania and that's a it's a relic
[5:19] it's something to look at you know so
[5:23] you go back to the Declaration of
[5:24] Independence but now remember this Bible
[5:28] is not going to be something that we're
[5:29] going to walk up to every day and go
[5:30] into the librarian well I wonder what
[5:33] that said and no it's a living body I
[5:37] don't think God ever and I want to get
[5:40] into this boom doyline we're on it I
[5:42] don't believe God intended to write it
[5:44] all now he knew he had to because in the
[5:50] fall I saw what brother Dale's preaching
[5:52] now because of the fall of all this
[5:53] covenants and all these all these things
[5:56] had to come in fact there's no covenant
[5:59] with a jensen 126 manning we would have
[6:01] come eternal there's no covenant we are
[6:03] God made manifest in another corner
[6:06] that's what we're going back to ok
[6:10] that's why there's no eternal covenant
[6:12] you don't need one there's eternal
[6:15] Redemption but there's not an eternal
[6:17] covenant there's no we don't need it
[6:20] coming up when we get to heaven if you
[6:22] do this don't do that or I know it was
[6:25] all set but because of the fall we need
[6:28] all this but God knew that and already
[6:31] had it wrote down remember the Bible was
[6:32] ready for the foundation to work putting
[6:34] the mighty God not only piece of paper
[6:36] oh I didn't have start handing out paper
[6:39] please sir you know he rise that yeah
[6:42] this is what you're supposed to say I've
[6:43] already wrote it down no here this is
[6:46] where we're going to have it that's why
[6:48] I was thinking too I thank God you knew
[6:51] what every one of these people in the
[6:52] world would ever think before a better
[6:55] that's your world and we try to limit
[6:58] you to all these things when he knew
[7:01] every thought of every person
[7:04] ever live from Adam talking the
[7:07] Millennium New Era's all then we worried
[7:13] if we worry about what is God going to
[7:17] do this for me and got you over this
[7:18] thing won't worry yeah it takes the fear
[7:21] away I don't had no fear because you
[7:23] know what he didn't have a Bible to read
[7:27] he was remember he was walking in the
[7:29] mind he was walking in the Word of God
[7:31] the Garden of Eden was created the Word
[7:34] of God remember Moses is one who wrote
[7:36] the Bible go starts my book Abraham
[7:40] didn't have a lot no what'd he do he
[7:43] heard from somebody so my talk to him
[7:46] okay so that's what we're getting to
[7:48] then not now because see we still need
[7:50] in Redemption you need the work the
[7:53] letter so you can read it comprehend it
[7:56] with your brain but brother grounds that
[7:58] we become the word as we receive the
[8:00] word well we're going to become a look
[8:02] no but I'll become a book we're going to
[8:07] be the rim word made manifest in a form
[8:09] called a bride and that's the way out of
[8:12] them and Eve should stay behind them
[8:15] word that God give them and then what
[8:18] needed about we don't need a Bible in
[8:22] heaven you need a Bible down here
[8:25] although this is redemption this is for
[8:26] redemption happen none of them is down
[8:28] there so this is the important part we
[8:30] must read the Bible we must study sure
[8:32] but how many times though have you set a
[8:34] lonesome wearing God start bringing
[8:37] things to you need not be the exact
[8:39] verbatim scripture right but the thought
[8:42] process of that Scripture is brought to
[8:45] you and God starts dealing with you when
[8:47] I see you didn't you didn't quote the
[8:50] scripture you were part of it you became
[8:53] part of that scripture john three
[8:55] sixteen only you become part of that and
[8:58] you don't have to go back and read it
[8:59] every day I don't have to go read john
[9:02] three sixteen everything I'm god save my
[9:03] soul now somebody LTX a gesture they
[9:07] need
[9:08] 36 thing okay we need a scripture to get
[9:12] us in and we needed the Bible to get us
[9:15] higher up in God right so that's when
[9:18] God promised he would speak to us
[9:20] through this word but it's not going to
[9:23] be a continuation the continuation is us
[9:26] yes going up magazine about go see these
[9:30] are experiences you can use a lot of
[9:35] David or whoever film okay listen now
[9:39] let's get started let's go to back to
[9:44] Matthew booming we're at last week well
[9:53] I won't go read under equal interest
[10:01] because what I want to do is that song
[10:03] man mastery that son of a ministry let
[10:10] me tell you something about
[10:20] let's get up here and right here
[10:26] because I'm going to get right here and
[10:28] show this is the trial 1964 we noticed
[10:32] when Jesus came and tried to rip truck
[10:34] look try to reveal himself tried shewe
[10:40] said try to reveal himself as the Son of
[10:44] man is he tried comes remember no one on
[10:49] earth it's like brother Bob brother Bob
[10:52] sent me a text or an email and he said
[10:57] I've read and he said to the Bible said
[10:59] and I think I'm good thanks how much 940
[11:04] you know when I told you about last
[11:06] Sunday about Paul will not have a
[11:10] revelation with some man proved it in
[11:14] the bottom right here right here
[11:18] offshore team
[11:22] well short they are really
[11:28] Bob black Paul's first sermon acts 9 20
[11:35] and straightway he preached Christ in
[11:37] the synagogue's that he is the Sun God
[11:40] not the son of man he had a son and God
[11:43] revelation and there's the first sermon
[11:45] in the freakin pax nine and twenty he
[11:49] preached Christ that he was the son of
[11:51] God not the Sun man alright so they're
[11:54] still proves more that the son of man
[11:57] revelation when he went up like I told
[12:00] you last Sunday when he went up he took
[12:03] that revelation women cuz what they
[12:04] rejected him because what Jesus come
[12:08] who'd he go did he came to his own and
[12:11] his own received him not who was it on
[12:13] the Jews all right when Jesus coming
[12:16] tried to reveal himself that Sun man
[12:19] don't miss this when he revealed himself
[12:21] and call himself constantly the son of
[12:25] man israel would blend right they know
[12:30] nothing about what son of man men but
[12:34] they said son of David got what blind
[12:38] Bartimaeus ran out a recognizing my
[12:40] blind Bartimaeus kept saying something
[12:42] he kept saying something he said thou
[12:44] son of David have mercy on Manny turn
[12:47] why because that was his son Martinez
[12:50] was a Jew all right David McDavid met
[12:54] King remember son of man son David Sun
[12:57] God with more this cube got what he
[12:59] asked for because he approached him in
[13:01] the name of the son of David the king he
[13:05] wasn't Savior but he was king remember
[13:08] you want to save it to the Jews at that
[13:10] time remember he went Seder to the Jews
[13:14] at that time he wasn't Savior but he was
[13:17] king but when the Greek woman the Sarah
[13:20] Phoenician woman at what was she what
[13:23] was she she was a gentle Gentile she
[13:27] wasn't a jew so she said the sheriff
[13:30] initial on a freak sorry the style
[13:33] Phoenician woman approached him in the
[13:35] name of the son of David remembers his
[13:37] son they become mushy on me he never
[13:40] raised his head you see how precise
[13:44] Jesus was Jesus was God he couldn't make
[13:48] everybody says he did these things wrong
[13:51] he never made a wrong move all right
[13:55] because like brother Ron Spencer said
[13:57] they would have been one mark against
[13:58] Jesus they would have brought it up in
[14:00] the hall pilot the Delta would have
[14:01] brought it up so he was he never even as
[14:04] much as raise his head she had no claims
[14:07] on him in the name of a Sunday right
[14:12] that's why the Bible says they a lot of
[14:14] people say Jesus Jesus have I not done
[14:18] these things in your name captain he
[14:20] said the park men never knew you wanted
[14:21] them have a personal relationship she
[14:25] had no claims on him in the name of the
[14:27] son David he wasn't son of David to that
[14:30] sovereign Asian woman but when she said
[14:33] Lord he turned around right he was the
[14:37] Lord's the Lord he was lord no son of
[14:39] David to her now why wasn't he
[14:45] recognized at some ma'am the son of man
[14:47] was a spiritual revelation of profits on
[14:49] a man named means probably he's talking
[14:51] about going to Ezekiel remember we're as
[14:56] evil you'll find out his ego was the
[14:57] property the working dog for that day
[14:59] and Jehovah himself called me on the son
[15:01] of man Jehovah called him a man the son
[15:04] of man the same as Jesus revealed
[15:06] himself as I am what was it the promise
[15:09] were that our being made manifest now
[15:13] that's the same thing here is to promise
[15:15] word of the Son of Man Man history being
[15:17] made manifest now Darla's equals town go
[15:21] to Jesus this time so man he was not at
[15:24] that time what you stopped he was the
[15:26] son of man because he had
[15:27] to reveal himself to Israel as the
[15:30] prophet and what did they do they
[15:32] rejected him all right they rejected the
[15:36] Soto and so then he just went over into
[15:40] the Son of God dispensation what Paul
[15:42] and then bringing it to what the jeep
[15:45] the jeep the Jews attacked I'm 120l run
[15:48] with Jews but they took it to what the
[15:50] Gentile all right and that was the
[15:53] prophecy that they should receive him in
[15:57] then I understand that it's ceq Son of
[16:01] Man promise I they should have looked at
[16:03] Jesus through what Ezekiel said and said
[16:05] you're that's not a man but they did see
[16:09] God had brought that revelation to them
[16:11] on some man who is evil they rejected it
[16:14] and that was the prophecy that they
[16:17] should receive him in in the name of the
[16:21] son of man of property because it was
[16:23] according to the word you running the
[16:24] 1815 the Lord your God shall raise up
[16:26] for profit likened unto meeting I
[16:27] remember that's talking the moment and
[16:30] when he come he identify himself in his
[16:35] ministry as a man not a son of God
[16:37] thought a man son of God the spirit so a
[16:44] man was the God in spirit into mini God
[16:49] is a spirit revealed himself as son of
[16:51] man what he claimed the beef and they
[16:54] was blinded than said but now unto the
[16:59] Gentiles he reveals itself now the Son
[17:02] of God which is the Holy Ghost hi that's
[17:07] down duterte when he just said Paul the
[17:10] church was built member Peter said jesus
[17:13] said Peter I'll build my church on what
[17:15] you just said but the revelation signed
[17:16] on now Arthur cry the one that created
[17:19] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[17:20] Living God he reveals himself now the
[17:24] Son of God which is all the go now you
[17:25] sit as it wasn't amazing thought let's
[17:29] get that wound over here Jesus it as it
[17:32] was in the days of Sodom when the son of
[17:34] man is being revealed now what's that
[17:37] that's the end time all right in the
[17:41] days of Sodom was the son that was God
[17:43] revealed in human flesh which was one
[17:45] time Cole male candidate the father no
[17:48] Cassidy cat that time had no father
[17:49] mother no beginning of days ending of
[17:51] life everybody was he remains the same
[17:53] Jesus had father mother nature I'm like
[17:55] the flesh right but this man had me the
[18:00] father the mother he appeared to Abraham
[18:02] in the form of a son of man right hello
[18:05] me I'm Jehovah church now has served the
[18:07] term through the church age in the
[18:10] baptism of the Holy go so I'm good right
[18:14] there by okay with that Sun God that's
[18:17] the Sun God revelation it's what john
[18:20] three sixteen regards all over the world

[18:24] to believe the name shall have eternal
[18:25] life only know the church now I serve
[18:28] the term through the church age in the
[18:30] baptism of the Holy note but jesus said
[18:32] here lame alki for and rest of these
[18:33] creatures real to you see that in the
[18:36] last days just before the coming the
[18:39] world setting will be like the Sodom and
[18:41] the Son of Man will reveal himself as
[18:44] the Son of Man like he did in the days
[18:47] of Sodom blind prosecutor can't you see
[18:50] that nothing else garden Princeton thorn
[18:53] in words of truth it's the sub God
[18:56] impersonated in his church that son of
[18:58] man everybody got them now you think
[19:02] well that's a bad choice of words but we
[19:07] look at the impersonation is is you know
[19:09] I try to fix myself up to look like
[19:11] Danny and deny going person ate him no
[19:14] it's the person it's the Son of God in
[19:18] person in his church as the son of man
[19:22] now that's us look at the real good son
[19:24] a man like daughter father gone
[19:26] hold on since the same guy three
[19:29] different attributes of the same God now
[19:32] this is the son of David Son of Man
[19:34] reveals the Prophet son updated the king
[19:36] now the Son of God to the church agent
[19:39] as God is a man God is a spirit and the
[19:43] spirit son is the Holy Ghost everybody
[19:45] got that which is revealing the church
[19:49] agent honestly honestly in the church
[19:53] ages what happens is you get a
[19:58] revelation that Jesus Christ sure he's
[20:02] the son of man but you get a revelation
[20:03] that what inside of him was going to
[20:05] save you then I got that and who was
[20:08] inside of the Son of Man the Son of God
[20:10] right the Sun God was inside the Son of
[20:14] Man revealing himself so down to the
[20:17] church ages they believed on the Lord
[20:20] Jesus Christ and they would say all
[20:23] right they didn't really like heart let
[20:26] her say the pub drink the beer smoke
[20:29] product that wasn't God that wasn't the
[20:33] fullness of god and what the fullness of
[20:35] god that was that was man not a man man
[20:39] all right but he had a son of God inside
[20:41] up in a limited form God wet limited the
[20:45] word was limited to be happy if I
[20:48] understand them but in the end time
[20:51] that's when I'm brother round had to
[20:53] come that's why there had to be a
[20:54] prophetic tropic brother branham sure
[20:56] the Holy note but through brother round
[20:58] had to bring us the revelation that hey
[21:01] you are not just a part of them tell me
[21:05] you're part of God but that son of man
[21:07] is going to make your flesh going to
[21:12] make your flesh like this letter
[21:15] nevermind I'll says you will have a body
[21:17] like and hit 40 place a man because well

[21:21] a body saying the soul man takes a body
[21:24] chain that's one of the people with the
[21:26] Son of God revelation or gain have died

[22:26] of God that the world had ever seen he
[22:29] saw his self because he lived through
[22:32] that but yeah as a Malachai for the
[22:36] angel coating has not been made
[22:39] I bet you that floor that man humanly
[22:41] probably went what else is left no
[22:45] thanks a lot left don't worry about it
[22:47] so when they took him out their own
[22:49] sunset mountain and God adopted him in
[22:52] front of the world he came back out here
[22:55] and then he started preaching the shrine
[22:57] in the Son of Man headstone because he
[23:01] Jesus was all this standing here this
[23:03] was his feet his loins its neck and his
[23:07] head all right they cut his head off
[23:11] just figuratively they cut him off
[23:13] brother Brown said that said they what
[23:15] they cut him off called the son of man's
[23:18] got to be risen again from the dead
[23:20] which meant they killed him they killed
[23:21] him they killed his attack right they
[23:25] killed his effect he didn't have a lot
[23:28] of effect here when he was hearing
[23:30] person you know but they killed his
[23:32] attack they killed the son of man you
[23:35] can't kill something on they killed son
[23:36] man but the Sun man is what to the body
[23:41] change joys and glory now this is his
[23:45] body but this has got to come back to
[23:49] unite to what to make it fully Jesus
[23:51] Christ here so I do believe that the
[23:53] brownie Jesus Christ is the son
[23:55] revelation of the Son of Man like it
[23:57] should have been in Jesus remember right
[24:00] now this is the way it should be so it
[24:03] looks bad I'll lift you my friend only a
[24:05] few are going to come to that son of man
[24:08] revelation to the Jews he was the son of
[24:12] God to the Greeks he was lured to us
[24:15] he's lured to the Gentiles and now in
[24:16] the last days he would return back again
[24:18] as son of man because Malachi promises
[24:21] that there would be a profit rise up in
[24:22] the last day that will return the hearts
[24:24] of the people back to away from them
[24:26] organizations back to the original word
[24:28] the faith of the Father see original
[24:30] Pentecost alright comes remember brother
[24:34] grounds hadn't met the messenger those
[24:36] two things what restore back to hear
[24:39] time to loose ends together leuchars
[24:42] message was not the fullness
[24:44] subscribe nobody got that same man hey
[24:47] man you what the Foley's cuz people know
[24:49] you're doing things that he shook that
[24:51] Jesus wasn't done right right done
[24:54] Wesley same thing they were some things
[24:57] over here that he was doing the Jews
[24:58] wouldn't do alright but now you come
[25:00] back you see brother branham you see him
[25:02] come and you see him praying the word
[25:04] and you see him doing the things that
[25:05] Jesus did so close to where they thought
[25:08] he was God manifested god I say he was
[25:12] good I say you are if you manifest God
[25:14] but you're not God himself in one person
[25:17] you're a manifestation of God all right
[25:19] all the bride of Jesus Christ is the
[25:21] manifestation of God doesn't matter if
[25:24] you know these more i'm in the grave now
[25:26] than then they will you know then you're
[25:29] alive were the only ones left we're it
[25:34] see how you going to reveal the
[25:37] mysteries see what Luke are left off see
[25:39] what Leslie left off see what Hancock
[25:42] left off and reveal the secret of the
[25:44] heart to make it the same guy to every
[25:47] age which is nothing but God's Word
[25:49] being made manifest back to the son of
[25:52] man again we don't look for nail scars
[25:54] we look for the word made manifest so
[25:57] what's he saying we're not working we're
[25:58] not looking for the Corporal body of
[25:59] Jesus to walk in with the now scarf not
[26:03] till the millennium or not what we meet
[26:05] him in the air and go to the lens up
[26:07] right right so the Son of Man revelation
[26:12] bottom line is if the son of man had
[26:14] been revealed brought them the seals and
[26:17] you say well brother Brad was the first
[26:19] one to preach them knowing what they
[26:24] were in Matthew ankle
[26:27] brother Brennan Santa salvisa Jesus
[26:29] preached six seals in Matthew 24 and he
[26:33] was the seventh he was the revelation of
[26:35] those sealed so Brett Brown didn't come
[26:38] and preach a new model he took every
[26:42] scripture that was in the Bible and
[26:44] showed us what he meant Wesley let's see
[26:51] what and of course back door wanna be
[26:53] able to see that was brother branham
[26:55] know I was different than any cuisine
[26:57] could tell he brought the secrets of
[27:00] their heart so that was an addition
[27:03] watch what he's saying back to son of
[27:05] man again we don't look from house
[27:08] guards we look for the word made
[27:09] manifest to notice gun promise these
[27:11] things now and he does he just as he
[27:13] said I could say more but we'll leave
[27:15] the subject it's getting late so it's
[27:18] getting late for us to but the Son of
[27:21] Man revelation the sundog revelations in
[27:25] the seven churches the Son of Man
[27:27] revelation was the opening of the
[27:30] Seventh Seal from nineteen sixty-three
[27:32] in march through nineteen sixty-five at
[27:35] brother Brown's death and its continued
[27:37] on because he brought he opened them
[27:40] we've gotta look in them right because
[27:44] remember John didn't take the book from
[27:48] the angel that was revelation 10-7 and
[27:54] tell you from the name
[27:58] he took it from the mighty anger so join
[28:02] with the top of who the bride so we must
[28:06] take it you say what are you doing away
[28:08] from around no in fact 10-7 profit if
[28:11] that I angel had become what he do did
[28:15] he make himself Christ no he pointed us
[28:18] to cry so John takes the book from the
[28:20] mighty angel brother I've said that
[28:21] mighty angel was crying so John takes
[28:24] the boat from the angel what we're
[28:26] supposed to be like the Bible instance
[28:28] my late brother round over the steel
[28:30] form Jesus Christ blue and brown over
[28:33] the seal but did that do anybody any
[28:35] good that cause rapper yet dead cops
[28:40] were after 1963 he actually said not
[28:44] getting this it's not for you when you
[28:49] say live a good what was he saying live
[28:51] a good simple son of God revelation
[28:54] Christian life that's what he will say
[28:58] you've been born again you've been
[29:00] baptized into the body your your full
[29:02] Christians just live that full Christian
[29:05] life because the people that is supposed
[29:07] to come to is somebody's been born yet
[29:11] double y'all work with so many work now
[29:13] it's three years old 1963 so that
[29:17] generation coming brother is what he was
[29:18] saying he said this generation is not
[29:20] getting and he said but now that
[29:21] generation coming they're going to give
[29:23] it a revelation not only the revelation
[29:25] the son of god they're gonna get
[29:26] revelations in a man see watch van right
[29:31] next same wave right now does everybody
[29:34] get what we're looking at with a snowman
[29:36] it was son of God through seven turkey
[29:39] the Son of Man revelation was not the
[29:42] flesh of God coming back we're not going
[29:47] to peace nothing touch your shirt we're
[29:48] gonna meet him in the air the flesh of
[29:50] god it's my brother Graham said no nails
[29:51] cars no you guys wasted oil in the hand
[29:55] blood all that stuff people was
[29:56] impersonating he said no it's the Son of
[30:00] Man being revealed through the bride of
[30:02] Jesus Christ I don't see why people
[30:04] don't understand that because let's
[30:05] before we go let's read a lot of people
[30:08] don't read revelations right let's go to
[30:11] Revelation till I had a preacher he was
[30:16] he was preaching a sermon and and I
[30:20] didn't say anything I did but he was
[30:23] saying John took the book from brother
[30:26] ground and I just let him go on in about
[30:29] two weeks later he told me bad he said I
[30:31] was wrong so CLE incorrect to say I let
[30:34] him cry because I didn't want to jump on
[30:36] him correct him out that would have been
[30:37] just that would have not been good so I
[30:40] just went God correctly and got a crack
[30:42] somebody this good that's right I mean
[30:44] somebody's got it on his heart he will
[30:48] first five in the angel which I saw
[30:50] stand upon seeing upon the earth lifted
[30:52] up his hand to heaven the who is that
[30:53] Christ alright and swear by him that
[30:56] liveth for ever and ever that work
[30:57] humans not supposed to swear to who of
[31:00] them dead he's already talking about
[31:01] what he swore by himself because he
[31:05] liveth for ever never could create
[31:06] heaven a hoodie talking about God and
[31:09] the things that they're in the earth
[31:11] thinks they're in and seeing other
[31:13] things that they're in that there should
[31:14] be time no longer know who was this
[31:15] mighty angel had to be Christ the
[31:17] crossing the Creator all right but 47
[31:22] but in the days of the voice of the
[31:24] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[31:25] sound the mystery of God should be
[31:27] fenced as he has declared to his
[31:28] servants the prophets and a voice which
[31:31] I heard from heaven span done to me
[31:34] against they go and take the little book
[31:36] which is open in the hand
[31:38] the angel you know all this brother
[31:40] around no what's he identified what
[31:42] angle it was we expanded upon the sea
[31:44] upon the earth so who do you take the
[31:47] book from he took the book from Christ
[31:48] we're supposed to take the book from
[31:51] Christ brother renamon is to what the
[31:54] conduit that brings the revelation truly
[31:58] truly truly nobody got that revelation
[32:01] okay until the end time and I went unto
[32:05] the angel said unto him give me the
[32:07] little book and he said to me take it
[32:09] here she'll make up any better yummy in
[32:11] the mount sweet honey I took the book
[32:13] out of the Angels hand the worst books
[32:16] to take the book out of the mighty angel
[32:19] Christ is a mighty angel had to eat it
[32:22] up you didn't leave a page out he didn't
[32:26] leave the for work he didn't leave with
[32:28] concordance he'd eat the whole thing
[32:29] right cuz some of the people take it
[32:33] from the angle man they eat it all but
[32:35] about a two sold doctrine or 700 doctor
[32:38] that's not in that book and it was in my
[32:42] mouth sweet as honey obviously when we
[32:44] come to churches all sweet honey and as
[32:46] soon as i eat it my belly was better
[32:47] what he had to go out living he said
[32:49] unto me thou must prophesy again before
[32:52] many people the nation come to team so
[32:54] what's he doing the voice of the
[32:58] bridegroom was in the bride and he said
[33:01] unto me who's me John the joint ops the
[33:05] bride so he set it to the pride that I
[33:08] must promise idea where the one who's
[33:10] taking the message to the people i don't
[33:12] understand what people have this have
[33:14] this real fuzzy feeling about us having
[33:17] the revelation right big brother brown
[33:21] know most people are preaching that
[33:23] brother branham had a revelation that's
[33:25] going to get you putting the grave you
[33:29] got our room John had to have a
[33:31] revelation when he took that book he
[33:32] took that book any 80 so it became part
[33:35] of John he disappeared and it is
[33:37] disappearing in the bride now because
[33:40] it's going to be a secret catching away
[33:42] amana so next week we will review just a
[33:46] few minutes and then we'll talk about
[33:47] sunbathing then we'll begin in the
[33:50] nineteen seventy weeks right
