I may need some reading glasses here for a minute Psalms 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty surely he will deliver thee from the snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence there shall not be afraid for the terror of night by night nor for arrow that fires by day a thousand shall fall at the side and ten thousand at that right hand but it shall not come nigh thee because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation or he shall give the angels charge over thee amen to keep thee in all thy ways thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet [Music] he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I

for the Lord good to see brother Herman and sister garland back there with us I'd have them say welcome you know we're glad to have brother Ernie Villanueva with us for the day in the services so

draw the deck on remember brother Bob he's down preaching for brother Harris today so keep him in your priority all right let's just saying open the eyes and my heart is brother Ernie Villanueva comes to bring the word of the Lord unto us this day open the eyes of my heart we need eyes of my heart I won't to see a man I want to see No thank you my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to see I want to see fine shining in the light of your glory so route your power and my old [Music] shining the light of your glory shout out your power Lord holy holy holy [Music] holy Oh only I want to see [Music] amen god bless you this morning each time I hear that song I remember there was a minister who came after that song and he just dropped the little thought in there and he says you know you can't get holy in a hurry it takes time to be holy it takes time to be in the presence of God and let that Shekinah glory just come and bathe bathe all the way down through your soul so I'd like to get started right away but I want to give greetings from our church from brother Bisco each time I speak with him he reminds me of the the great meetings that your assembly put on when we had here is one of the finest meetings that I've ever been a part of and the the the forum that it was in it was wonderful the reception that we had was wonderful and it was just one of the one of the most memorable weekend's that I've ever had and you know I love coming here and sometimes when you come to a church every church has an atmosphere and those of you who attend here be very very thankful because you have a church that has real love you know the brother branham talked about the kind of love the the eros and the filio and the agapo and they say that the closest that a man or a woman ever comes to agapo love is when they received their first child and I've never had that experience but I've had many people say well that's the truth you know when you have that love and it's it's like super filial love and semi agape love so you folks here you have that kind of a love one for another and for your pastor and his family but most of all for the word I'd like to turn in your Bibles right away and invite you to second Timothy chapter 3 and verse 1 and Paul is speaking to Timothy who he loved and you know Timothy Paul said the Timothy was his son it was not his flesh and blood son but anybody that Paul had personally witnessed to and brought to the message he considered them his son like Philemon you know when when he was sending Onesimus back he says Onesimus my son who I've been begotten in my bonds so Paul had a great love for Timothy and here he's exhorting him this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof so we'll stop right there for a second let's bow our heads father we're so thankful that that your message is an up-to-date message and Lord this this epistle could have been written this morning so up-to-date father as we look around at the world that we are living in and the state that men's minds have gotten into and how Paul describes them this is going to be in the last days that this mandate is going to have that man are going to be they want to be God's in their own mind and lovers of pleasure and despisers of those that are good lord I pray that you would you would give us the the essence of what Paul is saying and as we describe it to the day and the challenges that we are living in and the challenges that we face how Plus father to be able to to get the essence of it and let each person let them gird himself a little bit tighter father as we approach the oncoming storms and we know that we will crest every way by faith we ask these blessings and your precious and holy name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you you can have your seats and I'd like to speak this morning on a subject that that God just dropped into my heart and the subject is invasion insanity and deliverance and truly as we look around the world we can say that today the world truly has become an insane asylum and the inmates are running the asylum and that as a believer and last night I was listening before I went to bed and I was listening once again to the message brother Branham preached on super-sense and you know a lot of people outside of the message we in the message we have the opportunity if we dig deep enough we have the opportunity to understand the supernatural world that we're living in because you know we are pilgrims aliens and strangers down here there were citizens of a supernatural civilization and you know I've often thought all these people that are UFO UFO people they call them ufologist and they're out there and they're looking for people from another planet and they've got these telescopes and they've got these great listening devices and they're trying to define these sound signals coming in from another planet well I can walk up to him I say hey you don't have to look there I think Here I am right here and let me tell you IIIi have got some signals from another world that are absolutely you want to talk about a higher intelligence I'll give you the higher intelligence that you're looking for and in the you know you're always wondering how our government would receive these people if they came from another dimension or another another planet well I want to know how are you going to receive me because I'm from another world and I've been alive for a long time I've been I've been around since before the foundation of the world in the mind of God I was I was as real then as I am right now standing before you and and so brother Branham is talking about the super sense and so we as believers we have the privilege and the opportunity to understand how we are wired but the world they don't understand that they just go by their emotions they go by their feeling they go by their intelligence or their knowledge and they have goals and they set goals and by human ability they're out there and they're able to churn through and maybe drive over people walk over people whatever it takes to achieve their goals and and they're just driven they call them you know that type a personality you know and other people you know real docile and real humble and you know they just kind of casual about life but you know if you're casual about life you're gonna be a casualty and if you're casual about this message you're going to be a casualty and so as believers I know when I wake up in the morning I know there's got to be two deaths today I got to die and the devil's got to die and so the best thing to do is to is to stop the yapping of that dog first thing in the morning just bind him and don't wait until he brings the attack on you you go and bring the attack on him and bind him first thing in the morning because the Bible tells us if we resist the devil he will flee from us and in my mind what would I have in my mind when the devil comes I had my mind I'm here in one of these Georgia southern plantations and I'm up on the porch and all of a sudden this dog there's a rabid dog he comes up there and he's growling and and all the foams coming out of his mouth and and you can see his teeth and you know if he could get a hold of you he would do damage to your leg but I also know if I went over and got a big old pot of boiling water and I just walked over there and dump that water on that rabid dog what do you think would be the results of that dog he would flee he would be running he'd be yelling he'll yell and that's what we have the privilege of doing with the name of Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ praise prayer power righteousness all these things they are weapons of our warfare and so as we begin to dissect I want to go I'm going to do part one this morning in part two this afternoon and I just don't want to get in a hurry because I just want to lay this in so so if you took an egg and you looked at that egg by experience you know that the egg has a shell but you also know there is an egg white in there and as egg yolk in there well the human being is much like the egg we have a shell we have a physical exterior brother Branham says it's by those five senses that we contact the world the outside world and so we have our eye we'll go through our eyes and ears first a person would be very handicapped without the ability to see and they'd be handicapped if they could not hear now just an admonition we have got to be super vigilant as to what we allow to come into our eyes and into our ears because the greatest power that man has been given is the power of choice we choose we can choose God or we can choose the world one or the other but you know when you choose God you put you put a guard on your eyes because once you allow something by choice to go into your eyes or into your ears it takes an instantaneous journey to the back road of your mind and they're in the back road of your mind is produce a thought and thoughts become words and words produced actions and actions form habits habits produces character and character determines your destiny but how did it start it started by a choice that you made to look at something read something watch something hear something these are choices that you made you know brother Branham it when he talked about gossip y'all talking about nailing something he said we now listen when you go around and you start gossiping about your neighbour you do it Melissa he said just mark it down the Holy Ghost has just left you he can't stand that kind of a spirit he said now he's not gone far away he's just out on on the tree on that limb of the tree he said how do you get him to come back again just become a lamb again and the dove of God will come back and and live in that nature of a lamb and so now we go to eyes or ears then we go to our taste and our touch and our smell many people they are that they are they are abducted by Satan with their sense of touch you know in in the world that we're living if you just break it down and hope you remember this the world at large if it looks good they want to look at it if it sounds good they want to listen to it if it tastes good and smells good they want to eat it and if it feels good they want to touch it and they want to touch it and touch it and touch it that's where many people fall many people there in the flesh and the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes it traps them and they become addicted to it and they don't know in their own natural mind you know they can try to reform them so I remember how many times when I was a kid when they started coming out was smoking is danger how many times I tried to quit smoking I quit smoking for a day a week a month three months I used to get a little bit pen the size of a cigarette and put that thing in my pock and pull that thing out you know because I knew after I ate there was that sensation I needed and it was more something to do with your hands and it was not until I had my first experience with God in a little Southern Baptist Church in Winter Park Florida I will never forget that blessed man brother JC Mitchell and I mean if you would have go to Hollywood and cast a Southern Baptist minister it would have been brother JC Mitchell he was about six foot three weighed about 220 had a shock of white hair back there and he would preach and I when he preached that message about God's divine judgment for the sinner he was reading my mail I was all the way in the back row of the balcony I was just there trying to make a sale from some customers and that were going to buy something and they invited me to come to church now coming from a Catholic background I walked in that Baptist Church no Saints no angels no crosses no holding water no candle nothing I said this must be a pretty poor Church you know they don't have much in here and and it was kind of strange so I said all the way in the back row of the balcony I was the only one back there and when that preacher when he began to preach and he was a pointer and when he pointed he was pointing like that he was pointing right at me and I'm talking just reading my life you know by every standard of what a sinner was he nailed it and then cinched it since the nail and I mean I was shaking the whole back row was vibrating and so but that day after that experience I walked out and the desire first the very desire for cigarettes was gone the desire for alcohol and I was not a big drinker I didn't even like the taste of alcohol but I drank with my friends because it was the thing to do I even gone to the point I used to get a bottle I called that slow Gin Fizz it was a little red ball and I would take that little tiny bit of sloe gin and put it in some ginger ale and stir it around and so I walked around with a dress you couldn't you could drink a whole gallon of that stuff and nothing but people oh he he's drinking slow Gin Fizz that wasn't an oddball but if I hadn't drunk they would have thought something was strange that's the atmosphere the environment I was living in you know some people say that you know the problem with my son or my daughter they got involved with the wrong crowd anybody ever hear that well back when I was young that was me I was the wrong crowd and the whole bunch of us that were running around we were the wrong crowd and we didn't know anything about positive attitude and we didn't know anything about about love and none of those things so anyways the desire for drinking and desire for smoking the desire for all those the desire for a goal into the horse track and going to the dog that was gone and I mean I walked out of that church and I'd asked the pastor I said is what you're saying here the true that if I'll ask Jesus Christ into my heart cause he read second Corinthians 5:17 If any man is in Christ is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things become new and then he preached God will separate your sins as far as the east is from the west into the sea of forgetfulness and remember them no more and now I'm a Catholic you know and when you want to get your sins forgiven you had to go to the priest and you had to go in the little box and you had to you know say a little greeting everybody said insane greeting and then you confessed your sins and then he said okay go say 10 Hail Marys and 10 our fathers go to the altar and you say it and you walked out now I didn't know anything about true justification but that was Catholic justification 10 Hail Marys 10 our Father walk no problem it's all gone so I had an idea about what justification could be until I found out in the message what justification really was you know I just dropped this thing you know there's two things that I know of that God cannot do number one he cannot fail and number two he cannot find sin that has been confessed and is in the bleach under the blood of Jesus Christ cannot find that sin now if we could if we if each one of us could just walk out of here today with that understanding that our sins our past is truly gone dead buried never to be remembered again it's the greatest gift that a believer has when it come to the message is the relief of the guilt and the shame and the condemnation of our path it is gone and for most people it takes a while for that to really sink in and for Pete I know people in the message it still hasn't sunk in yet and the devil still beats them up every day comes with that Club brings up the past you know what I tell the devil you want to bring up my past let me tell you I want to bring up your past and I remind him of what he does and all the murders and all the sins and all the all the alcoholics and all the murders and everything that he has been the problem he's been the source of it all I said yeah I got a pass but I tell you my past is gone your past is still with you and I got a future let me remind you of your future in the lake of fire and you know what the devil don't like to hear that they do not like to hear that you know in Ephesians let's turn to Ephesians real quick before I go any further just as a found a in Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 very familiar this this is something that every believer it I mean it should be a verse that is memorize scripture finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and then the power of his might put on the whole armor of a god now you know what this is not a suggestion this is not just good advice or something you might want to do every once in a while every day friends do you know you would not consider me if somebody I mean there's a lot of crazy people walking around almost nude but if somebody walked out totally nude and just had no clothes on they would surely call the men in the white coats and they'd have them you know a committed but people who walk out without the whole armor of God you're putting yourself in a very vulnerable position because as a believer when you wake up in the morning you've got a bull's-eye on your back and every demon every principality every power everyone in the neighborhood knows who you are they got your address your email address they got everything about you they got a whole they got a whole dossier on everything you've ever done every weakness you've got every time they've ever tricked you and believe they have been tricking and deceiving men for 6,000 years they are precision deceivers and if they can't do it by themselves they'll go and get a whole gang of them and they'll come and they'll have a joint assault on you and sometimes the assault may come from your family from those that you love those that don't understand you those that misunderstand you so he says put on the whole armor of God that you may be the stand against the wiles that word wiles it means the cunning devices that you may stand against the cunning devices of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood for a lot of us is a good thing I wouldn't want to go an arm wrestle with some of these guys that go to the gyms and they get all bulked up and they sit there they look yourself in the mirror I wouldn't want to wrestle with those guys we don't wrestle against flesh and blood we wrestle against something that is so much more powerful we wrestle against the powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may believe 'old a this is the evil day this is more evil than any other day that's ever been this is more evil the Bible's as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man and if somebody cannot see that we are living in the days of Sodom something is wrong with them and so having a that you may bless that withstand in the evil day and having done all the stands stand therefore having your loins Girt about with what with truth that's a part of your armor that the truth is God's exclamation point and this message is God's exclamation point it's truth at a very high supernatural level and so the truth is the first weapon that we talked about here having your loins Girt about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness and only God can give you true righteousness you know the most of the world they don't even understand or no they don't know how many gods there are so how can they have righteousness I talked to people and him the brother who witnessed to me about the UPC and brought me out of Trinity he had the whole Bible memorized took him 16 years and the first I asked him about brother Branham he's a homo boy brother and he watched that serpent seed don't let it get you know I hadn't even I didn't even know what a serpent seed was at that time I had just met Arnie a few days before that so here's the guy that got the whole Bible memorized and I mean it was true I watched him preach I listened to him i cross-referenced his messages it was he walked up there and he would pre he use a hundred scripture it was like a performance but he was lost in Genesis 3 and Genesis 3 he took a left-hand turn and that left-hand turn net he'll never ever ever hit the target never it's like brother brother Sam was telling me he had the sight in somebody's gun I think it was brother Jules gun that's what's the problem but brother branham talked about he said if your site is off just a little bit here you're never going to hit the target and it is impossible to hit the target without the message and without somebody who can break the word of life to you yeah I know people who don't they don't think we ought to have preachers I would shudder to think I love the message I love the tapes I love the voice but I would shudder to think how bankrupt I would be without all of the insight and the knowledge that men of God who have looked at the word like a diamond and they've gone and they have attacked or they brought forth this little jewel or this little nugget of the diamond and and you know it's the worst the Bible plus the message plus the fivefold ministry brother branham said I laid it out there now you guys go and dig it up all those wonderful facets of those diamonds coming out all the types and the shadows in the mysteries and the way they would just take bring things out it's one it's the mystical body of Jesus Christ you're a mystic in the the definition of a mystic that's one who's who seeks after and attains direct intercourse with God that's a mystic and the bride is the only truth that the new world they get a whole bunch of false mystics but the bride are the only true mystics in the world they seek after and they attain direct intercourse with God one of my favorite thoughts is this Bible it's a supernatural multiplication of inspiration and revelation for communication with God when you know this word and you know this message you are linked up with omnipotence linked up with infallibility God's got a supernatural transport system waiting for you just just like Elijah had one that we got a same kind of transport system waiting for us it will either before at the rapture or if it's a grave out of the grave and we're going to be there living a lie eternity you can't even you can't even begin to imagine because eternity has no time and we're never going to be bored for all of eternity there's going to be something to know something to learn maybe we won't be learning about galaxies that are you know in our mind maybe there are zillion trillion miles away or light-years away from us we're going to be riding the word through the word oh my what a privilege friends yeah brother branham often says I he's I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with what God is doing amongst us and then brother ray know a lot of people they were going too far with brother Branham in his ministry and thinking that he was a big somebody and brother branham he says you know you always talk about the people that go too far but you don't talk about the people who don't go are enough and we understand what what brother Branham was he is a brother our precious brother he was Elijah to this day he was anointed to take us all the way back to the faith of our fathers and then forward into a rapture we had to go back to the faith of our fathers first and to understand that but now we're living in an elevated supernatural age and you can go there anytime that you want to of what you want to all you got to do is close your eyes you see and so here we are we're told now let me just finish this having your feet shed with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God and so you're going out you're a soldier you got your sword you got your shield and remember all your all your armor is front armor there's nothing on the back there's not a card if you run the devil's got an open shot at you the Bible you know when you're in the middle of a great trial when you've done all the stand stand you know if I stand I might be in the greatest trial the devil cannot make me raise my arm if I don't want to raise my arm he can't make me raise my feet if I just want to stand in the middle of a trial and wait for God to move or wait for God to give me instruction on how to move I'm going to stand a brother Ram said you know when you raise your hand that's a supernatural act that's a decision that you made to lift your hand up to God that's what we want to lift our hands up to holy hands with praise and thanksgiving and so now as a human being your eyes your ears your taste your touch and your smell now that's just the outside and most people they live in that realm looks good look at it sounds good listen to it smells good tastes good eat it feels good do it and see each one of those compartments of your physical life they're an intricate compartment your eyes are so much different than your ears and your smell and your taste is so much different than your touch but and we do all of them simultaneous we don't even think about it we do them natural just unconscious you know you walk around do things go over there but put the oven on put the boiler you know again it automatically without even thinking oh what treasures our eyes our ears are here this people that have gone through treatment medical treatment they have no sense of taste they have no smell everything tastes the same and the only reason they eat is for calories just to keep their body could you imagine having no taste no smell there's people who have been that they've lost their arms and their legs and battle they don't have the sensation of touch sometimes people know the price of everything and the value of nothing so now we'll go a little bit deeper let's go into the second round your brother Branham says that that that first realm is a physical it's like the first pull and you are only as safe as the realm that you choose to dwell in now in the spiritual realm you're conscious yeah I think about what a gift our conscience is to us when it's cleaned when it's scoured out when there's no guilt there's there's nothing in there to hold you back from that personal relationship with God you can come there and you can get on your hands and say father as the son would come to his father and even though you know because you know in your mind what you were before God just allows us to remember that to understand what he has done for us and so here your conscience and your conscience I call it's like a double-edged sword over here is a sinner his life is full with sin debauchery anger bitterness wrath jealousy strife all those things and he's liable to do anything he has no conscience of what how it's going to affect somebody if he does something to them people can go and they can they can rob some they can go to a little old lady on the street and grab her purse and run away they did a survey awhile ago brother Wade in New York City and they asked the women if you were going to get mugged because getting mugged in New York City is the reality if you're gonna get mugged would you rather they take your wallet your pocketbook or your cellphone 90% said take my wallet take pick my pocketbook don't want to lose their cellphone with all their contacts and all that that's their communication system and they they be like they're on another planet without that that thing and so now that the conscience conscience that is clean what a gift that is to a human being I know I said it before a lot of people think that there are a human being that's come to earth to have a spiritual experience but in reality we are all supernatural beings and we've come to earth to have a human experience and that human experience is to overcome the eyes the ears that taste the touch and the smell and then your conscience is all cleaned out and then your memory a memory what a double-edged sword that memory is you know and I I've tried to exercise my memory especially when I was going through a trial with my feet had a lot of time on my own a lot of time in the house a lot of time studying and praying and I try to do exercise and I tried to stretch my memory tried to think back as far as I could and I can remember not much but I can remember my mother's sister when I was four years old I can remember her taking me out she had a black Buick taking me out for ice cream and candy and my grandmother showed me the picture I had a little gray suit on with a little gray cap getting ready to go into that black that black car so I can remember I can remember my first grade teacher in Catholic school I remember what her name is I can remember the first priest that I ever had First Communion now I didn't always remember that I had to exercise my memory see so it's a double-edged sword because Satan wants to use your memory to club you over the head with but God he wants you to remember his promises to you he wants to remember who you are in Christ you're a king's kid kings and priests unto God you're you're the elite of God by the grace of God you're the most blessed people we are that have ever walked planet Earth no other generation has had what we have in this day the understanding I remember when the computer first came out and her little little ebooks came out oh we thought we're a big timer had the message in this little little mini computer then they had the one that used to roll the scripture - oh man that was big time and see now we got the whole thing on our cell phone we can read it listen to it understand that question cross with all these things God has made it so simple for you to understand who he is and who you are in him but it has to be a conscious decision that you make a conscious choice that you make it's got to be a habit that you form it you know many people they're just they say I'm too busy well if we're too busy for God we are too busy and so here we are the conscience and how different is your conscience from your memory even though they sometimes intertwine your conscience is guilty because of the memories that you have but each one of them is like a separate if you want an elevator each one of them is like a different floor then you go down to your imagination another double-edged sword you know you could Satan wants to bring up your it wants to bring fear upon you that's what most people they live in a state of fear they live in a state of panic yeah I get IIIi just hear about these college students out there you they call them snowflakes you know and there I'm not comfortable I'm not comfortable with that that may be a man's coming to speak that's made maybe thirty thousand people on the campus he's going to speak five miles away and yeah I'm uncomfortable with that man being on the campus and and they got little rooms they can go to cry rooms now believe it or not I know corporate America corporate America is now starting to incorporate that they have cry rooms if their employees if they get intimidated if they get afraid if somebody speaks to them in the wrong manner and they get nervous they have a panic attack they have cry rooms that they can go to now it's gone so crazy I remember I read about people who were shell-shocked in the war and they came back and they had memories of horrible memories well now everybody that comes back from the war everybody's got PTSD if you travel now all the service I mean the service the guy comes walking on there got a little dog there's some people they've tried to carry on a little peacock that was there gonna be their service animal was a little pica somebody tried to carry a monkey on there and now there's these these students on college campuses the ones that are really stressed out they're allowing them to have service dogs to go to class with them that's the world that we are living in give me a break please give me a break the but that fear that fear binds people it paralyzes people it immobilizes them fear I know you hear this fear f.e.a.r false evidence appearing real false education appearing real or what most people do forget everything and run that's the new one today but the Bride of Christ face everything and rise that's who we are in this day we rise above the circumstances I talked to people well how you doing today well under the circumstances rise above the circumstances and so your conscious memory imagination reasoning reasoning all mine how many people have come and they've tried to reason the message they've tried I remember when I first come into the message and I was studying and the serpents eat that way one day it was just as crystal clear as anything and I go and talk to people and then they put that little doubt inside of me and next day is it really true you know I mean a serpent you know standing upright talking to even and having intercourse and having a I mean and I was going back anybody remember that anybody remember having to reason out that God sent the Prophet and that brother Branham was the manifestation of Malachi for Elijah for this generation and you have been chosen and selected and elected and protected to be ejected out of this world you are the virgin bride of Jesus Christ and you say me why would God choose me you know why we know ourselves too well we know other people after the flesh we don't know their internal work we don't know where they've been we don't know the mistakes they've made we don't know all the error we all as we see well that's brother stolen sister so-and-so you know or somebody at war he's a good man much better man than me but you've got a seed gene of God inside of you you can be quickened that's why you're an alien a pilgrim you look at people nowadays friends you look at the world and we are bombarded brother Branham said every generation for the young people he said now mothers remember this generation that your daughter is being raised up in is 10 times more difficult than what you were raised up in think about the temptation we got children eight and ten years old they got a smartphone they closed the door in their bedroom and they can tune in Facebook okay I think I'll go to India today or I'll go to China I'll go to Africa and they got the whole world in front of them the good the bad and the ugly and most of it they tuned into is the bad and the ugly let me tell you how nuts the world is they got one of these crazy Hollywood stars you know and you want to talk about egomaniacs narcissist you know they say the smallest package in the world was the person all wrapped up in themselves and this woman I mean they said to her she puts they call they call them selfies where you getting a camera and you get the right pose and take a picture is this woman brother Sam she said she has to take 2,000 pictures before she gets the right one that she wants to put on the Internet mm snaps and look I don't like that one another one another maybe take her all day and she gets one and it makes her look just exactly the way she wants to look to all of her fans you know that word fans made fanatics all my fanatics out there so reasoning we got a reason out the message the Bible says cast down reason cast down memory cast down imagination you know my imagination of God I've named my imagination it's a station of creation in my imagination it's a dream machine of excitement and enchantment and supernatural ecstasy I've even named my brain it's called the village of anything is possible see I mean that much to the world that sounds crazy you they say we you're you're enough I said I might be a nut but I'm screwed to the right bolt I'm screwed - thus sayeth the Lord friends I don't care what anybody says I was have a brother a while ago he's coming into the message and he's got a brother who's a Messianic Jew he's a Christian but now he's at least he's that he belongs to these Jews for Jesus the Jews that have recognized Jesus as Messiah so he says he said he said Ernie you need to speak to my rabbi my rabbi he can run rings around any Christian as far as theology here you speak to him he'll straighten you out I said really I said that Rev your rabbi he's got as much chance of straightening me out as the mesquita would of coming down and swallowing a whale that's how much chance he's got a straightening me out or taking me away from from this message he and so now your reasoning cast down reason and reason why God sent a prophet you know why you know why God sent a prophet because he said he was going to send a prophet that's why I sent the Prophet the Bible would be in think of how incomplete the word would be without Elijah coming how numb how dull how frozen desensitized people are without this word and then the realm of affections that's a great one friends young people nowadays you know brother Branham was talking in the invasion of the United States back in 1954 he said he said he he said God has ways of showing me things he said now he talks about fourteen fifteen-year-old girls he said what's going on and then he said why he says he said you'd have a better chance of finding a needle in a haystack than trying to find a virgin among these young girls that was 1954 friends that was the good old day that was the Ozzie and Harriet days you know little Ricky had a little Ricky back there you know so and so all these things are coming into total manifestation now and people they are addicted their feelings whether their feelings is for television or movies or music some kind of entertainment or whether their affection is maybe it's the lust the lust of the flesh how many you know they say it is it is exploding exponentially the number of men who are addicted to pornography they think they're just gonna take a little peek in that's it it's like somebody taking a shot of Crystal methedrine that's it it's that you know why because the psychologists have said that when they take that shot they take that one shot it takes them and it opens up a passage in their mind that man was never meant to go - it's this passage that Satan opens up into this temporary ecstasy and they feel like like they are in heaven but they're only there for a short time and when they come down from this demented artificial experience and they come down to where you and I live right now that seems like hell to them and you know what they'll do they'll rob anybody that robbed their mother their grandmother that robbed a bank they'll prostitute themselves anything they can just because they got to get back to heaven again wasn't meant to be you know how hard that is to get those people clean from that very few only the Holy Ghost can bring somebody back from that and we've got so many people that are addicted you know they've got these clinics now they've got a you know the the AAA Alcoholics Anonymous and they got Narcotics Anonymous then they got the sex anonymous you know sex addicts and then they got one now as crazy it's called beaters Anonymous it's for people who have domestic violence issues and the judge makes them go to court and have to go to counseling to stop beating their wife or sometimes it's white beating their husbands you know and so so that that realm of affections we've got to get victory over there the Bible said set your affections on things above that's the only way it's a paradigm shift here's the world here is lost here is the devil here you're serving sin over here you're clean you're pure your spotless your holy with a personal intimate covenant relationship with the King of Kings Lord of lords and you know what he is said about you you know your position and cry you got victory over the enemy you know think about all these sensations now just to kind of wrap this up eyes ears taste touch smell conscious memory imagination reasons and affections the world that we live in now there are they used to be if somebody was a star that was somebody maybe back in the 50s in the 60s then they said he's a superstar and maybe the 80s maybe the 90 you know some of the rock and roll guys some of the Hollywood you know a queens in Hollywood but now they've got to be a megastar to get anybody's attention and they're out there friends every day around this country there are hundreds of rock and roll concerts and lap concerts where young minds young teenage minds are going there and they're watching these demons perform now you look at that person and it looks like a sweet young girl 13 years old you have no idea how her mind is being wired they have no idea how that young man's mind is being wired for the future they are creating monsters every day if mothers knew what was going on if mothers knew what was going on in the child's bedroom with that cellphone they would snatch that thing out of there and they would handcuff them to the bed and make them go to sleep didn't matter how much they cry didn't matter nothing I love my daughter I'm not gonna turn her over to the devil that one brother in our church says I refuse to be a lamb chop for the devil I like that that's how most people are they're just lamb chops for all the demons the demons had to eat him up now so that's music stars and you've got the TV stars and the Hollywood quit brother Branson it started way back in the 1890s back in Paris and in Paris they sent all their fashions over here you know what until the turn of the century there was no such thing as a moving picture some of you young people may not realize there was no television there was no movie there was none of that things over there but Satan and at first Satan came up it was Charlie Chaplin and it was the talking just just people moving around no sound and people were dazzled by that the talkies you know and no talk just it's action that's how most people are you know I call it NATO na tio no action talk only and see so then Satan came along and he had motion picture and then he had people talking while they were acting brother Prince they're actors they act out apart and many of these actors they have played so many parts and they have engrossed themselves in so many parts they do not even know who they really are I see some of these guys you know one guy he's a big tough guy Holly he played all the tough-guy roles in the acting movies when I used to watch way back before I became a Christian he said I'd like to take that president I'd like to pop them you know and use some horrible language you know he thinks he's a tough guy because he's act out so many tough guy he's taken on that persona everybody expects that of him he's probably a wimp we know one thing he's a supernatural wimp if a person doesn't have it doesn't have this message they are a zero pound weakling these talk about the 90-pound weakling these are zero pound weaklings so now you have the movies and the TVs and then the sports stars oh my nowadays the baseball the football stars and I mean it's just incredible the money they're being paid and how everything in Satan's realm it's beginning to merge it's B it's the it's the actors and they get involved in politics and the sports people they get involved in entertainment and then they get involved in politics and it's all Satan it's a it's a homogeneous a homogeneous pancake that he's making up there and people are influenced by what the celebrities say let me say something especially to the young people if you can get this the so the so-called celebrities of this world whether they're TV movie sports business whatever kind of a realm they're in they should have zero percent influence on you doesn't matter how beautiful they are doesn't matter how good they talk or how good know how smart they are I see some of these commentators and they think Oh wisdom started and ended with me the final voice and they said so cocksure and they're not even in pre-kindergarten not even in pre nursery schools many of them Catholics bowing yes how does it just boggles my it boggles my mind how I could have been so stupid to believe all that Catholic doctrine but now you know I was telling brother Sam your former representative here in Georgia how many know knew or heard Newt Gingrich most Pete Rose your hand if you if you remember him okay do you know that a few years ago he converted he became a Catholic and now he got involved with the president's election campaign and now his wife his third wife now she is the ambassador from the United States to the Vatican and Newt Gingrich he has drank the kool-aid big time he's intoxicated oh my the Wonder and the awe and the mysteries and and and oh my he just walks her and he's anything she's to catch me out walks around like a peacock he lives in Rome he just comes to Georgia to vacation but he lives over there among all the Michelangelo's among all the friar among all the treasure among all the seminary and the Theological gone gone and they tell him brother salmon sometimes people I said they look at people a real smart like president Trump's daughter Ivanka oh my so sophisticated savvy smart businessperson I think she can't be too smart she went from being a Christian to being a Jew she's going backwards how smart can that be I mean the smarts that really count the things that really count so we'll get off now we'll get off the the the the affections now you know I'll just one more you know people who want to pump himself up and and a lot of times it's the people the people who pump these pee and these people start believing their own press you know PT Barnum he said one thing he said he said there's no such thing as bad publicity just make sure you spell my name right and that's how a lot of people are a lot of people they become famous for doing something stupid and everybody knows their name then they turn around and they want to like this guy this guy that is crazy the guy that was the lawyer who was representing the porn star who was accusing the president now he's one of the leading candidates to be the president in the Democratic Party you want to talk about stupid on steroids stuck in stupid deep and dumb you know when God was passing out brains they thought he said trains and asked for slow one that's how many people are in the spiritual realm I want to give one more you know and and and those have got a little Asia you would remember Superman you know how many people brother how many people have played Superman every one of them came to a bad end horrible you go look at a candy the last one he was paralyzed in a wheelchair for the last year but boy when he was Superman he was tough stuff anybody old enough to remember the Marlboro Man oh my riding off Marlboro Man the camel got all these people that was when they could advertise he's killing cigarettes on television and so Superman all turned out wrong how about people who said I am the king or people said they were the king how about Elvis Presley the king brother random said it took five or six psychiatrists to keep him on stage but he was the king anointed Wow charisma draw millions of people people intoxicated with his mere presence it was an atmosphere it was an anointing friends it was a supernatural anointing but it was a demonic supernatural anointing how about I am the greatest yeah how did he end up Superman I am The King how about the King of Pop Michael Jackson wow you want to talk about a presence and anointing and atmosphere that man could create in the video the music videos that came out you know what the last few years he had so many demons in his brain he had to have anesthesia to put him to sleep and a professional doctor and it's honest like the if you're gonna have operation they put you under anesthesia that's what Michael Jackson had to have just to put him out so many demons in his mind could not sleep what an Elvis Presley died of drugs couldn't deal with what was going on in his brain how about Hitler Hitler oh ma look at the allegiance that Hitler had with the German people talk about a super intoxicant my everybody's got their hand up in there millions upon millions upon gonna die for him I'll give you one more before I get off that subject is one more now he's the new king that's King LeBron LeBron James the King I'll tell you I saw a little somebody sent me a little clip of him it was in one of the the playoff games he had and he just I mean here's a guy almost seven foot tall and he takes a little orange ball and he jumps up and stuffs it in the basket and he goes and he comes running down he and he's like this and I took the picture I saw the picture of it he would have made a better King Kong than King Kong would have made scary literal scary but he's the king nobody like nobody's ever been like him you know what the king he just left Cleveland nowhere he moved to LA he got a twenty five million dollar mansion and he's building another twenty five million dollar mansion and he got a long term contract brother sam and i believe he's the king is going to be there when la just slides right off into the ocean that's gonna be the last we hear of the king thank God we won't be around to see that one so now we go out of the realm of the physical and the emotional the spiritual and we go into the realm of the soul the realm of the soul that's a that's either God or the serpent there's note that there's no happy median in there a person is either anointed and led and guided and directed and motivated and inspired by one or the other that's the Holy of Holies a sacred place a holy place it's not a place for your tiptoe out and your tiptoe back in you live there permanently full-time God's not looking for any part-time Christians he's looking for full-time soldiers and warriors and I'll tell you friends just closing now when when when he lives in that realm but the random calls it the control tower and when that when God is in your control tower your ship is safe the navigate it's a supernatural navigation system and it is set for you unto eternity it's set for you for the wedding supper it's set for you for the Millennium it's set for you for eternity and it's a holy place a sacred place the outer court the lorentz that was okay the inner court that was a little bit better but the the the the Holy of Holies and he says did you ever meet somebody who's been there they live there they come out always sweet always kind always nice never have anything bad to say about anybody because they been with him and and their habit is holiness their habit is love brother Branham said that without perfect love no rapture sometimes I think people have skipped over that they use the Bible and the message they use it like a menu it's like going to a smorgasbord well I like the chicken I don't like fish tomorrow I'm gonna get you can't use the Bible you can't use the message like a menu friend you've got to take the whole thing lock stock and barrel and you have to take the barrel to let's stand to our feet friends in first Peter Peter said beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happen to you no this is not the exception that you're targeted that's don't think it's well why me how come you know I read the Bible I know every one of us how would you like to have gone through what Paul went through whip five times with 39 lash I don't believe there's too many men alive today that could survive one of those kind of beatings with 30 he got it five times three times they beat him with rods shipwrecked they hated him they hate imprisoned for most of of his ministry in jail I had to write with big big letters and knowing knowing that all the churches that he had planted out there that the wolves were going in to try to grab the sheep you know who most of them were they called them the Judaizers the ones that went there and they went into these newborn Holy Ghost filled Christian Church and they tried to say well that's okay but you have to keep the law yeah Moses said the loss and they tried to make these newborn Christians some of them that were heathen didn't know anything about anything except Christ they tried to go back and make them become Jews now Paul what what a burden he went through and then I think about what our prophet went through my you know the most transparent prophet in all of history you know when you go back and you read Isaiah Jeremiah Ezrin any of the prophets we read and maybe it's you know Isaiah is 66 chapters you know what that's like a a minut cliff notes into what isaiah did we don't hear about what how many children he had we don't hear about is why we don't hear about the strife and the family we don't hear about money Pro we don't hear none of the whole I say yeah and we have I say up on this great big pedestal let me ask you a question if Jesus was alive today right now what do you think social media would have to say about Jesus Christ today right now talk about being barbecued they would crucify him so you can I mean they're taking Jesus Christ out of every have taken the commandments we got a guy high school football coach in Washington he just wanted to have prayer with his football players before they went onto the football field fired that guy done toast gone you know sometimes people say well you know if you don't want to know something go to Google Google knows everything ask Google who Jesus is Google don't know when you're living in that sacred place think it not strange consign concerning the fiery trial which is a try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice and as much as year partakers of Christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad with exceeding joy in 1st Peter 5 it says be sober be vigilant that means be aware be alert attention because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion glad he said as a roaring lion he's like snagglepuss to lion he roars but he's got no teeth some of you young people might have to look up snagglepuss and find out who he was walketh about seeking whom he may devour resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same fliction czar accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who hath called you unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while whatever kind of suffering God has allowed to come into your life to perfect you as he did with job after you've suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you to him be glory and honor forever let's bow our heads father we thank you that you give us the privilege of living in a sacred holy supernatural atmosphere and Lord how much more when your children come together and each brings or lick a fire each brings that anointing the wise virgins had that oil with them that revelation Minds that they come hungry they come expecting they come to encourage one another to lift up one another we thank you for the privilege of being a part of the body of Jesus Christ and what I I pray that today each one of us would have taken just a little step higher in our desire to know you and the power of your resurrection not to look at the world not to look at at the entertainment not to look at the fashion magazines not to look at the romance books or any other of Satan's delicacies that he dangles before the world and intoxicates them and then as a vulture he feeds on his own children as he did with Elvis Presley as he did with Michael Jackson and all the rest of them that we could mention father he lifts them up he allows them to be glorified for a while and he breaks them and humbles them and their end is in hell father I thank you for this day thank you for brother Sam brother Wade and the ministry the Deacons trustees song leaders those that work behind the scenes those that nobody knows about especially the heroes the prayer warriors Lord the ones that we sometimes know absolutely nothing about but you know them bless them I pray we ask it in your precious name of our
