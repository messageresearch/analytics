TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all right i'm going to teach a little lesson this morning about holy matrimony and i'm going to open with a word of prayer heavenly father we thank you for letting us get together today in your name and pray you'll just help us with teaching this lesson let it be a blessing to your people helper bob once again ministering in tennessee brother wade here and all of us teaching sunday school may everything be done for your glory and honor and uh once again thank you for touching all the sick and needy and give us understanding of your word i pray as we study this morning jesus name amen uh okay so this came on me really strong the other day when i was driving the chicken truck and i've thought of this for years this is nothing new but i really don't know why i haven't taught it before but uh the other night i was driving and i thought my wife some of these days i need to teach about this holy matrimony this uh certain idea about holy matrimony and i thought as strong as this anointing is i just seemed like i just got a teacher this sunday and then it was the next day brother bob said i need to teach sunday school sunday so i was like all right lord that makes sense because it came on me really strong thursday night so uh and then at the end if there's time i'm gonna try to show a little testimony video not really relevant to the lesson at all so the idea of um marriage that most people have in mind it seems like to me i'm talking about people in christianity as a whole not just in the message per se is that to put god in marriage you start off the marriage on the right foot so to speak you come to the altar get married by a preacher in a church and that's kind of your way of committing yourselves to god and saying lord we want you to bless our union we want you in our marriage and that's good and that's how it should start but the life after that is what's really important it's kind of like salvation when you come to the altar you confess your sins you say lord i want you in my life but then if you go out don't go to church don't read the bible after that you're really telling god i didn't really mean what i said you know you made the confession you invited into your heart but then you didn't live the life afterward just like with marriage if you come to the altar say lord we want you in our union we want you to bless our marriage but we're not going to read the bible together we're not going to pray together we might go to church together to do a few things but we're just not going to have any communion with you in our marriage and that's telling the lord the opposite of really what you want you want him in your marriage every day that's what makes it a holy matrimony that's the reason it's called holy so basically what you've done at the start of marriage is you've planted the seed a love seed you started this little form of love we can maybe call it puppy love i don't mean to belittle it because it's really strong when it starts but it can grow from there can go about two different directions it can either start an upward trajectory and grow and become stronger if you nurture it with the word of god or if you don't it can start to diminish and start to disintegrate and over the years in just a few years time you're about ready for divorce you know ready just all the time bickering and fighting and it can become a terrible thing after just a few years if you don't do what i'm talking about and this is such a simple thing that i think a lot of people overlook it it's so simple it's just as simple as reading your bible and praying every day in your own walk with the lord is what makes you grow closer to god but then people don't do it sometimes so holy matrimony is a divinely blessed lifelong union between a man and a woman and the holy part that part means dedicated or consecrated to god it means sacred so what am i talking about if you don't even read the bible together at least talk about the lord at least you know go to church together listen to sermons together and daily be communing with christ in your marriage in some way okay that's that's the focus here me and gabby read the bible together every day we consider it critical but uh even if you don't do that at least talk about the lord together at least say you know spouse i've been thinking about this about the lord today and and that starts a conversation that can go on for hours if you just start that just get it kind of triggered that little meditative state between you and your spouse and that is so key for god to bless your marriage and be in that union and one example i want to give right up front i've thought about them i've watched them for years his brother and sister dale even since before they heard the message they were going to church every service there was never a question as to whether they're going to church when they were in the baptist church never a question about it they always went to church they come into the message you say well he's the preacher he's got to be here even if he wasn't i'm sure they'd have been at church their whole marriage of 63 or 64 years they put christ in their marriage they've had a christ-centered marriage the entire time and talking about the lord together walking together in communion with christ and look what it's produced today they're still sweethearts today they're still in love like they were even more than than when they got married so it's caused that love to grow and manifest and they bear the fruit of it and i've watched their life for years and i've said god i want that in my marriage that's what i've been watching for all these years and and it'll just keep on getting better as the days go by because they're doing the right thing so i want to go back to the first marriage genesis 2 and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him and help me for him and adam gave names to all cattle and the fowl of the air and every beast of the field and adam for adam that was not found and helped meet for him and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and took one of his ribs and closed the flesh instead the roof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto him and adam said this is now bone in my bone flesh from my flesh he should be called won't be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh so this whole idea marriage came out of the mind of god this is his product okay he's the inventor the author of marriage he's the author of love he is love so if we're talking about love and marriage and how should we structure it we should look back to that original type and look at how god formed it in the beginning and say let's do that and quite simply the first marriage had the lord in it i'll show you here in a minute purposes of marriage these are just a few things i named uh one that types christ in the church you know how do we know god is a savior because we were lost and we needed salvation we know him as a healer because we were sick and needed healing likewise we see him how he deals with his his us his bride because we are husband and wife in a marriage we can really see that firsthand this love i have for gabby keeps growing such that i don't know how to express it i'm always writing her love letters and sharing love songs with her and talking to her and sending her text message at random just tell her how much i love her because i can't figure out how to express it sometimes it's so strong and that's then i think lord that must be how you feel towards your bride number two it teaches us to love it's a lifelong love lesson you're never done learning love learning what it means to be selfless and not think about your own self and everything about love it's it's just constantly every day you're learning more about love as you experience it in marriage it glorifies god through enhanced spiritual growth i mean by enhanced i mean in light it accelerates your spiritual growth if it's done this way it should accelerate you sh i should be helping gabby grow closer to the lord and she is i can testify to the fact that she has helped me grow closer lord in our marriage by us uh having this communion with christ if i don't think to mention it you know he said where two or three are gathered i'll be in their midst two makes a marriage and if you invite him in there every day he'll be in your marriage genesis 3 this is right after the fall this is the only place i can think of in the bible it's kind of hard to find anywhere in the message or in the bible that i can see where it's plainly spelled out to do this you'll be surprised where i got this idea from i don't think it's actually written down i'll just go and tell y'all this idea came to me in 1999 in the baptist church this was a youth pastor my youth pastor in the baptist church i was 15 years old he told us a group of teenagers he said someday you all get married if you get married he'll say this is how he said this is how you should structure your marriage he's the one that told me this i don't know why it seems to be so hard to to find exactly a place in the message or bible where i can support this but right after the fall it did show that the lord was evidently coming down in the cold of the evening walking with them because it says they heard the voice of the lord walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hear themselves from the presence of the lord amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou so if he came down after the fall i can only infer maybe possibly most likely he was communing with them before the fall right walking with them in the garden daily in the cool of the day and doing what he would do what he did 2000 years ago with his disciples you know talking about himself using maybe parables and examples to kind of unfold and reveal himself to them so god wants to be in our marriage it's plainly to me this is just plain is this day fellowship brother barron said now man was born to our fellowship man beginning back in the garden of eden he had wonderful fellowship god come down and fellowship with this company men and every evening in the cool of the evening god will come down under the great palm trees perhaps this sacred lightest was shining down on adam and eve and that great cathedral in the open fellowship with god had nothing to worry about as long as they were fellowshipping all right so true headship i wrote there equals fellowship and unity um so it's important to keep the headship in order so it's christ i'll just read it but i would have you know as paul saying i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god so if we keep that in order and um you know there's everything that the lord reveals to me i immediately go to gabby and share with her you know she's the first one i want to talk to when maybe when i'm riding around the chicken truck at night and thinking meditating on the word the lord showed me something as soon as she gets up the next day she called me i started telling her about it you know it's important to keep these things in order and also she is the kind of like the pastor of our little flock you know our little kids because i can take something maybe that's preached here and break it down for gabby but she can break it down further to the kids and so then we have you know everything in order to where god can just reveal on each of our level this is the simple diagram that was given me in the baptist church 22 22 years ago i was 15 years old it's a simple triangle or a pyramid you could say it shows husband on the left god on the top and wife on the right this is not some kind of perversion okay i'm not mean any anything uh perverted or corrupt here by saying this um you know it's just keep our minds pure all i'm simply saying is that god is in the marriage in that headship order i'm saying these arrows show relationships so i'll break them down one at a time this is what was given to me by that minister uh so the husband has to have his own walk with the lord okay that is crucial for this to work and bringing christ in marriage does not negate your individual walk with the lord is no substitute he the husband has to have his own walk with the lord so i read the bible and pray every single day no matter what listen to sermons every day likewise the wife has to have her walk with the lord for this thing to work she has to read her bible and pray and listen to sermons every day and commune with christ in her own private time now this is a salvation issue this is us working out our salvation individually because there's no collective salvation it's not like me and gabby are saved because we read the bomb pray together she has to work out her own salvation and i have to work out mine that's separate now and then of course husband and wife have a relationship together that's marriage but the middle part is what i think a lot of people miss the daily communing together collectively with christ that's what i'm talking about fellowship communion with christ all right so satan despises unity oneness fellowship love marriage etc everything god stands for satan despises and he is attacking marriage vehemently he is there marriage is almost unheard of anymore in the world people just shack up they don't get married you know they just check up together and whatever but i'm talking about in christianity even where marriage should be maybe i wouldn't say easy but it should be able to work you know two married people who are both christians should be able to work out their little differences and come together in unity in christ and doing this doesn't take away the problems it just gives you the ability to work them out so much easier so much better than if you try to just say well i'm gonna serve the lord over here you go over there and you serve them yourself and we'll just come together and eat supper you know i mean you got to have somewhere where you meet in the middle and talk about the lord he is adamantly satan is adamantly attacking these things causing strife division divorce etc and hatred it's quite an attack and i know i know some things you know it's just like i hear problems in people's marriages and i hate it i despise divorce i despise it with a passion i don't think it should ever happen it really shouldn't especially in christian marriage it should not happen uh root cause and marital problems if you dig down to the very bottom of it you could say oh well he said she said that he did this he did that all kind of little bickering and fighting at the very root of it it's our adamic nature and we all have that we're all born with that that's the point of needing the new birth so our damic nature everything that the fall produced enmity strife division sedition all kind of little jealous feelings that rise up the remedy for marital problems is the new birth daily communion with christ individually and collectively frankly i know it's kind of funny but if anybody comes to me saying i'm depressed what i do i say read the bible and pray every day it doesn't seem like it really directly addresses depression but it does it worked for me just do it every day and you won't see an effect maybe for years but keep doing it somebody said well i'm having lust problems i say read the ball and pray every day it'll work just keep doing it you're sowing down seeds you wait on god to quicken those seeds but you got to keep bringing the word of god in feeding on it constantly and then john 15 now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me so it's not just a one time we come to the altar we say lord come into our marriage we're getting married in a church by a preacher we want you in our marriage no it's an abiding in him and that process of the word cleansing us from all of our wrong things uh amos three can two walk together except they be agreed this is all about talk talking about agreement it's hard to walk together in life two people at in any case is hard okay but especially if they're in disagreement about what they believe and and what they see in the word but if you just keep reading the bible and praying even if there is a disagreement or misunderstanding or confusion or whatever any kind of dispute you just keep sowing these seeds keep sowing the word of god in your marriage and your lives individually and collectively and watch what happens you'll start to come together in the unity of faith it might take years but it'll happen matthew 18 again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven uh and then matthew 6 33 but seek you first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things should be added unto you um i want to give y'all just in with just a little bit of hope about something um you know the hollywood kind of paints this picture in the movies you know of a man and woman true love at first sight they fall in love they get married and they live happily ever after and growing up i used to wonder is that real does that really exist and you know many people i think come to marriage and and and with that high hope that they're going to have that happen they're just magically going to write off in the sunset and live happily ever after and then the bickering and the fighting and all these things money problems money fights and problems about other things in marriage come up and they're like well i guess that's not real it's just a picture i want to tell you it is real true love does happen and it's a real thing happily ever ever after it does happen this is a passion of mine because i thought for all these years lord i am experiencing this it's a real thing i love gabby so much and that i can't even express it to her and lord i wish that that could be in everybody's marriage i wish there's some way i can convey that to help everybody have that i want it so bad for people and like i said i don't know why i haven't shared it in a testimony in a class before i did give it out to the young people maybe a year or two ago i wrote it down like a testimony mailed it out to the young people that might be getting married to make sure and do this put god in marriage but it is such a key such a crucial thing to do and it really works i ended a little bit faster than i thought but um i have this testimony video a lot of you saw it on whatsapp but this is for those who didn't get to see it if brother anderson could play that at this time please [Music] every year around iva's birthday we testify to remind everybody about what the lord did for us her name abba means god is gracious and he's been so gracious to us to spare her life so many times around her birth and all throughout her life so far so we want to give testimony about that in the bible we find the lord likes us to remember the things he's done for us because we tend to forget god and his blessings and benefits and everything he's done for us in the past but going back and rehearsing the things that he's done for us causes us to uh realize how much god is with us and how real he is how much how real his presence is among us so when iva was born uh in 2014 july 2nd 2014 right after her birth she had complications uh her lungs were underdeveloped she was a big premature baby and that made it even harder because her lungs were not getting oxygen to her body and she had this seven and a half pound body a lot of body mass and no oxygen and so um after a few days she was on her deathbed right then we had received two of three witnesses back to back telling us the same thing don't fear don't worry even if iva dies just don't worry don't fear no matter what and right after that dr heidi carping came in the room and sat down and said first she introduced herself she said i'm [Music] your baby's dying yeah real blunt real straight forward [Music] so now by that time i had received three life witnesses three death witnesses three times the lord had told me through three different things that don't fear and three times i've been told by three different medical professionals that your baby's dying so now i have to choose faith or fear believe or doubt and we chose to believe no matter what see don't reason believe no matter what the circumstances don't pay no attention to circumstances believe [Music] faith in the old testament mastered the lines and shut their mouth shut them up how many lies do you want shut up in your life listen we're in a lion's den every day when we walk out in that world there's something or somebody wanting to eat us up all the time but when faith masters that circumstance see it masters all all circumstances you know why because god said so brother william bull of uncreates one sermon that morning i had one service and then the left went back down to atlanta and turned out she was getting better on her own without any procedure without any additional medicines nothing changed procedure-wise medicine equipment all that nothing changed and then so from that point on she was improving and finally about a month old she came home from the hospital a healthy baby she turned four found her sitting on the couch indian style but she had fallen forward and i thought it was cute so i snapped a picture you can see that her eyes are still open so i investigated a little bit and find that she is unresponsive she's staring and right away i kind of knew it was a seizure so i get her up put her in the floor and that's when she starts not fully convulsing but it's uh twitching jerking or spasming or whatever you want to call it but it was a full-blown seizure by that point take her to the hospital and by that time it's been over an hour well over and out just like everybody was there hands on deck everybody last option was to sedate her and put her like an on life support medical induced coma to get it to stop lana and they called in the helicopter to send her off and the obvious concern was that she was going to have brain damage yeah because her lack of oxygen in over an hour they did their scans when she first and was admitted and they said it looked normal and she's perfectly fine i woke her up pulled her out of all that medical induced and first thing out of her mouth is where's my clothes and then she still hadn't no didn't realize that there was time that had progressed her next thing that she asked is are we still going shopping yeah so she was perfectly normal and picked up right where she left off right before her eighth birthday she had an eeg which is just a study overnight study for her seizures and she didn't have a single one and so they took her off all medication and she's been okay so this is our little healthy eight-year-old iva say hello hi so did jesus make you better when you're a baby yeah yeah you feel okay now yeah yeah so jesus always makes you better doesn't he yeah so thank you all for watching you can look in the description down below for the original testimonial video where i testified back in 2014 god bless y'all [Music] you
