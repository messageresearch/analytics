[14:45] thank you brother canada it's a great
[14:47] privilege to be here today to speak to
[14:50] you people out in radio land we don't
[14:54] know all the people that are listening
[14:56] to us but we do hope and pray that this
[15:00] program will prove a blessing unto you
[15:03] that you'll be instructed from the Word
[15:06] of God and that you will hear things
[15:08] that that you don't ordinarily hear from
[15:12] the different places that you go we
[15:15] certainly hope that this broadcast will
[15:17] be a source of strength unto you and we
[15:21] know that all of our help comes down
[15:23] from our Father above we know that all
[15:27] of our strength and power comes from him
[15:31] now as we read the scriptures today we'd
[15:34] like for you to to just begin to thank a
[15:38] little home well with say pro and con
[15:43] and I'm going to read to you from the
[15:46] sixth chapter of Romans beginning with
[15:51] the twenty second verse but now being
[15:55] made free from sin and become servants
[16:00] to God you have your fruits unto
[16:02] holiness and the end everlasting life
[16:06] for the wages of sin is death but the
[16:11] gift of God is eternal life through
[16:16] Jesus Christ now before I get started in
[16:21] this message I like for you to think
[16:25] about the payoffs
[16:28] the wages the wages is what you receive
[16:33] the wages of sin is death but the gift
[16:38] of God is eternal life through Jesus
[16:43] Christ now we know that there is only
[16:48] one source of eternal life and that
[16:51] comes through Jesus Christ and this
[16:55] might sound contradictory to a lot of
[16:58] people but what most of you have heard
[17:02] priests out in radioland is that the
[17:07] wages of sin is eternal life inhale and
[17:11] at the gift of God is eternal life
[17:14] through Jesus Christ but may I say again
[17:20] that there is why only one source of
[17:22] eternal life and that has to come from
[17:27] God himself Jesus Christ in the Greek is
[17:34] the same self existent life that the
[17:38] Lord God is in the Hebrew the self same
[17:43] life and that life comes through Jesus
[17:48] Christ that life is eternal those that
[17:54] go into hell forever and ever is a space
[17:59] of time for the unbelievers that their
[18:04] soul may be destroyed inhale remember
[18:08] the scripture said fear not him that is
[18:11] able to destroy the soul or the able to
[18:15] destroy the body but rather fear Him who
[18:18] is able to destroy both soul and body
[18:22] inhale the word forever comes from the
[18:27] word a on which means a space of time
[18:31] the word eternal comes from the word Zoe
[18:36] which is eternal life
[18:39] now the wages of sin is death but the
[18:45] gift of God is eternal life through
[18:49] Jesus Christ I remember how that John
[18:53] spoke of this eternal life he said I
[18:56] eyes has seen and our hands of handle
[19:01] this eternal life and we showed unto you
[19:04] which was manifested unto you and which
[19:07] was with the father that word alive and
[19:11] that word of life today is the same as
[19:16] it was yesterday Jesus Christ the same
[19:19] yesterday today and forever because he
[19:24] is the word he is our righteousness the
[19:29] wages all sin is there but you must
[19:33] understand that in order to have the
[19:37] light you must also know what it is to
[19:41] be in darkness in order to be set free
[19:45] you must also know what it is to be in
[19:50] bondage so in order for us to understand
[19:55] what it was to be in bondage God sent
[19:59] forth the law through Moses and that law
[20:04] said thou shalt not kill and I should
[20:07] not steal and thou shalt not commit
[20:09] adultery but man's very nature was to do
[20:13] those things that was contrary to God
[20:16] because the carnal man is at enmity
[20:19] against God it's not subject to the laws
[20:22] of God neither indeed can be now if you
[20:26] happen to be a center out there in
[20:28] radioland you say well i'm so glad that
[20:30] i am not all the law let me tell you
[20:34] that you are under the law until you
[20:38] accept the Lord Jesus Christ and come
[20:41] out of the prison at your end because
[20:45] the law is ours
[20:46] Master to latest unto christ and the law
[20:50] brings our knowledge of sin and you
[20:53] would not know except it had been for
[20:55] the Lord said thou shalt not you would
[20:58] not know that you or is sin and remember
[21:03] today except you except the Lord Jesus
[21:06] Christ as your personal Savior you're
[21:08] condemned by the law and the wages of
[21:13] your condemnation which proves that you
[21:16] are Center is death destruction done
[21:24] inhale far that sounds very plain
[21:28] probably a lot of people said I don't
[21:30] believe you or to top that plane the
[21:33] senses already pasted you already in
[21:37] prison condemned to death until you
[21:42] accept the only source of eternal life
[21:45] and that is the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:48] friendly little in what is your payoff
[21:51] what is your wage is going to be now we
[21:55] know that time is growing short we know
[21:58] that the shadows of darkness are
[22:01] occurring a denominational world because
[22:05] they're just like the Pharisees it would
[22:07] not accept the baptism of John jesus
[22:11] said it the Pharisees and the lawyers
[22:14] rejected a counsel of God against
[22:17] themselves not being baptized Oh John
[22:21] are you in that predicament today are
[22:26] you one of those that were not for the
[22:29] complete word of God and let me tell you
[22:33] just like Jesus told the devil in his
[22:35] day let me sandy ulit man shall not live
[22:39] by bread alone but by every where they
[22:42] proceedeth out of the mouth Oh God what
[22:45] is your wages going to be why are you
[22:48] gonna come
[22:49] at the end all the way you say well I
[22:53] belong to the biggest organization let
[22:57] me tell you that the way of destruction
[23:00] is the Broadway blood is a way that
[23:03] leadeth unto destruction maybe that go
[23:07] in there but matter and straight is the
[23:11] way that leads to life eternal and few
[23:14] there be that find it if you're in the
[23:17] majority today then you should know of a
[23:21] certainty by the scripture that you are
[23:23] wrong to begin with because it always
[23:26] going to be of two that will find the
[23:30] way that the lawyers provide for his
[23:33] chosen predestinated seed but let me say
[23:37] unto you out there there in bondage to
[23:40] the nomination you're just like old fire
[23:43] was in the day that moses went down to
[23:46] the river the churn of Israel out of the
[23:48] Gyptian bondage God had to show forth
[23:51] his glory by heart in a horror file that
[23:54] he wouldn't let the children of Israel
[23:56] go and you would tell for signs surely a
[24:00] servant and final would get not let him
[24:04] go because the Lord would harden his
[24:06] heart let me say today that you are
[24:10] serving your purpose you are proven to
[24:13] the world just exactly the position that
[24:17] you're in but those predestinated seed
[24:20] that are out in radioland better hell
[24:24] and advantages of Pharaoh God is going
[24:28] to leave them out by his word god is
[24:31] going to settle free from the bondages
[24:34] all sin and from the bondages our
[24:38] unbelief those are bound that are the
[24:42] Sheep of his pasture are going to walk
[24:45] three one of these days because your
[24:48] walls of Babylon are going to fall you
[24:51] are
[24:51] Leonys in church you are that church
[24:55] this lukewarm that's going to be spewed
[24:57] out of his mouth to go through the
[24:59] tribulation let me say the cry has
[25:02] already been made some of you are gone
[25:05] trying to get all youth you trend your
[25:07] lamps you again preaching the coming of
[25:10] Christ you said behold the bridegroom
[25:13] cometh and you begin the trail your
[25:16] lamps and some of y'all seen your
[25:17] mistakes Episcopalians privateer badness
[25:21] a lot of different people have gone and
[25:23] tried to buy all but let me just say to
[25:26] you I hope that you're not one of those
[25:28] it's going to be too late because when
[25:31] you go as a whole I am certain that the
[25:35] church will be gone when you get back
[25:37] the door will be shut those people in
[25:40] Moses is day that art was only built so
[25:44] big but the door gradually closed if
[25:48] they had a bit of predestinated see they
[25:50] could have probably run and got in just
[25:53] before the door quick behind them and I
[25:56] say to you today after in radioland if
[26:00] you are one of those that the Lord has a
[26:02] place prepared for you general walls of
[26:06] babblin the denominational walls that
[26:11] are built around Julis sponsored and
[26:14] mothered by the heart church of
[26:16] revelation 17 I believe the proverb says
[26:21] over there I don't remember exactly
[26:22] where to find it but he says as the
[26:26] mother is so is the daughter that's one
[26:30] way that you may know whether that you
[26:32] are a daughter or the mother harlot
[26:34] Church or not is what you will go along
[26:37] with this word and take the Santa Lord
[26:39] all right you were far what your Church
[26:44] teaches but fan around news for you that
[26:48] was a man
[26:48] present one day with the name of
[26:50] Barabbas he was behind bars and a
[26:54] sentence of death with a pony and they
[26:56] come in late now because they had chose
[26:59] to let him go free that the Lord Jesus
[27:02] Christ will be led to Calvary to take
[27:05] this place I can imagine is all Barabbas
[27:09] come out of that place somebody probably
[27:11] said lover going up that hill younger
[27:14] look he go up that hill burning a cross
[27:17] on his back that's the reason you're
[27:20] free but friend today it's not like it
[27:23] was in paralysis date he paid the price
[27:27] for every man and woman boy and girl you
[27:32] that place of the school called Gaga a
[27:35] He shed his precious blown up on
[27:38] Calvary's cross that you could be set
[27:41] free that through Jesus Christ you could
[27:45] reap the wages of eternal life but you
[27:48] have to walk out take up your cross and
[27:51] follow him hell song there's our crops
[27:57] on the hill it's an mo more suffering
[28:01] and shame but it's a reality unto us
[28:04] today that belief because the word is
[28:08] the power of God unto salvation do they
[28:10] literally to the Jew first and also unto
[28:14] the Greek I'm so glad today that even
[28:17] though i had a seal of some death upon
[28:19] me I step out from that prison into the
[28:22] marvelous light
[28:25] of darkness into the gospel light after
[28:29] John the Baptist was put in prison Jesus
[28:34] Christ come along to Lublin Hannah well
[28:39] it was Galilee of the Gentiles I believe
[28:41] the scripture says and those that said
[28:44] and dark is so great light and all set
[28:48] in the region and the shadow of death
[28:50] lot is from my friend today you are in
[28:54] the darkness unless you have accepted
[28:56] the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal
[28:58] Savior your wages is dead inhale but if
[29:04] you'll accept or Jesus Christ take him
[29:08] as your own and all walk in the word
[29:12] mash you're not alone by bread alone but
[29:15] by every word that proceedeth out of the
[29:17] mouth of God walk in every bit of the
[29:20] light that you can see you can reap
[29:23] eternal life but it must be through
[29:26] Jesus Christ no organization has any
[29:30] strings on this life no Creed can cover
[29:34] the words of eternal life the all
[29:38] Creed's are just like those Pharisees
[29:40] and lawyers they fall short and will not
[29:43] accept the full gospel they rejected a
[29:46] counsel of God against them sealed
[29:48] because it would not be baptized of John
[29:51] today if you will not follow the Full
[29:54] Gospel you reject a castle of God
[29:57] against yourself because you are not fun
[30:01] you will be spilled into the tribulation
[30:04] and when you stand before that great
[30:06] white throne judgment if you have ever
[30:10] heard the word of truth oh my if it come
[30:13] through me he will say to / from me
[30:16] around you you you worker of iniquity be
[30:20] callin equity is a deviation from the
[30:22] truth not far in a full word of God then
[30:25] how you want to go in the rapture then a
[30:28] stand before the judgment to be
[30:31] condemned because you I refuse the true
[30:34] gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ how
[30:37] praise him for his mercy today
