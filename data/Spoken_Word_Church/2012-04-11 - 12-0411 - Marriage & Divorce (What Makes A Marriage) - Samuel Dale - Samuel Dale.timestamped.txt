[1:28] 1 and
[1:32] take an opportunity to speak on
[1:34] something that was requested back a good
[1:37] bit ago
[1:38] now I've had the note L on my desk for
[1:41] quite a while for me to speak on and I
[1:43] was going to try to bring it on over and
[1:45] bypass it and get on over to later but
[1:48] it just buing on me so we'll just cover
[1:50] it but we're going to talk about
[1:52] marriage and divorce amen all right now
[1:56] and the main thing we're going to do is
[1:57] tonight is we're going to try to cover

[2:02] marriage Etc and then we'll go into uh
[2:05] later on you know what is a divorce or
[2:09] what can be or who can be divorced
[2:11] whatever can be and we'll try to cover
[2:14] that so uh I have it in here and I'll
[2:17] state it again to you that are are
[2:20] listening by way of Internet are live
[2:23] now or will some hear maybe uh the tapes
[2:27] then I ask you if you will to just do me
[2:29] one favor and that is to listen all the
[2:32] way to what I have to say because that
[2:35] way you know I can say something you you
[2:38] say well I don't agree with that well
[2:40] you you might find out that it's right
[2:42] so you know just uh just do the best you
[2:45] can and listen and and everything
[2:48] because we're not trying to uh beat on
[2:51] nobody because of a a situation or an
[2:55] existence uh I've done this many times
[2:57] before and I think it's NE necessary to
[3:00] do and then I I receive the question
[3:03] there and I I generally do this about
[3:05] every 3 or 4 Years anyway is to run a
[3:07] series and and speak on marriage and
[3:09] divorce because we're constantly getting
[3:11] new people in and and I want you to know
[3:15] what I believe you know that's the thing
[3:17] that I want you to know is what I
[3:19] believe and then you say well I don't
[3:21] agree with that's all right that's no
[3:23] problem just just see whether it's in
[3:26] the word or not you know we we just find
[3:29] out if it's in the Bible if it's in the
[3:31] prophet's message now if we preaching to
[3:33] the denominations and things we wouldn't
[3:36] be able to speak the things we do here
[3:39] because they wouldn't follow it or
[3:41] believe it but yet we can can uh speak
[3:44] on them here and and say this is what we
[3:47] believe you know and if you hear don't
[3:50] believe what I believe about it then
[3:52] that's up to you to to you know answer
[3:55] for your own conscience of of what is
[3:58] doings but let's see what the Bible says
[4:01] and see what the prophet has to say you
[4:03] know and that way we can cover it in
[4:05] that form okay Luke 1 Matthew 1 Heavenly
[4:09] Father we thank you for your love and
[4:11] your grace we thank you for all things
[4:14] and Lord we thank you for the
[4:15] testimonies we've heard tonight there
[4:17] will being with
[4:19] little brother Ryan's baby Lord and
[4:22] stopping to bleeding and the and all of
[4:25] the things we thank you for all things
[4:27] that you've done Among Us and and we
[4:29] praise you Your Great Name because you
[4:31] are great and Lord we ask you now to
[4:33] just come and let us meditate upon these
[4:36] things speak about
[4:38] them and Lord just deliver our heart and
[4:41] soul to the people as to what we believe
[4:44] and why we believe it and just let your
[4:47] love be made manifest with each one of
[4:49] us we love you and we thank you bless
[4:52] the sick among us you said you sent your
[4:54] word and healed us so we believe you and
[4:57] Lord just have your way and Lord just
[5:00] let the Revival begin in me because
[5:02] that's what we need tonight more than
[5:04] anything in the world is a Revival in
[5:06] our hearts we know that there's not
[5:08] going to be a worldwide sweeping Revival
[5:11] but we know the bride has promised a
[5:12] Revival and Lord we've been in a Revival
[5:15] ever since we came in this message as to
[5:18] the opening of the word now come on the
[5:20] scene to make that manifest in our
[5:23] hearts and lives in the last days and
[5:26] it's not hard to pray that because you
[5:28] promised it you see it would be here so
[5:30] we believe you father just as we look
[5:32] out there and see all of the world and
[5:34] see what the Bible has said about it
[5:35] being then we look to Thy word to see
[5:38] what you said about all the other things
[5:40] and the promises unto each one of us we
[5:42] love you and we thank you Father forgive
[5:44] our sins cleanse us and guide each and
[5:46] every one of us in Jesus name
[5:49] amen he Luke I just shortened the the
[5:53] part from Luke and then we can go over
[5:55] to Matthew to pick up the other part as
[5:58] to what we we want to you know to cover
[6:02] but Luke
[6:05] 1:26 and we
[6:07] will read it and in the sixth month the
[6:11] angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a
[6:14] city of Galilee named Nazareth to a
[6:17] virgin a spouse to a man whose name was
[6:20] Joseph of the House of David and the
[6:23] virgin's name was Mary and the angel
[6:26] came in unto her and said hell thou thou
[6:31] that art highly favored the Lord is with
[6:34] thee blessed art thou among women okay
[6:37] now we'll go over to Matthew because if
[6:39] we read the other part it would be
[6:41] basically what it will be saying in
[6:43] Matthew so we go to Matthew 1
[6:48] 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[6:50] this wise when is his mother Mary was a
[6:54] spouse to Joseph before they came
[6:56] together she was found with child of the
[6:57] Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being
[7:00] a just man and not willing to make her a
[7:03] public example was minded to put her
[7:05] away privately but while he thought on
[7:07] these things behold the angel of the
[7:09] Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying
[7:12] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[7:14] take unto thee Mary thy wife for that
[7:17] which is conceived in her is of the Holy
[7:19] Ghost amen and she shall bring forth a
[7:21] son and thou shalt call his name Jesus
[7:24] or he shall save his people from their
[7:26] sins now all this was done that it might
[7:29] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[7:32] Lord by the prophet
[7:34] saying you go back into Isaiah Behold a
[7:37] virgin shall be with child and shall
[7:39] bring forth a son and thou shall shall
[7:41] call his name Emmanuel which being
[7:44] interpreted is god with us then Joseph
[7:46] being raised from the sleep did as the
[7:49] angel of the Lord had bidden him and
[7:51] took unto him his wife and knew her not
[7:55] till she had brought forth her firstborn
[7:57] son and he called his name Jesus you may
[8:01] be seated the Lord add his Blessing to
[8:04] the reading of the word
[8:08] now what I said what we're going to do
[8:10] is we're going to cover of what is a
[8:14] marriage we're going to go through the
[8:17] the Bible and we're going to go through
[8:20] uh you know the prophet's message and
[8:23] like I said if we was out in the
[8:25] denominations we would be taking the
[8:28] Bible
[8:29] and we would only be saying well I
[8:31] believe this well another person would
[8:33] take the other part of the Bible I
[8:34] believe this well I don't believe that I
[8:36] believe this and see then you know it
[8:39] would become up and has made a uh
[8:42] Masterpiece of confusion because the
[8:45] prophet said anytime you get to talking
[8:47] on Bible terminologies marriage and
[8:50] divorce comes up because that's
[8:52] everybody's idea or thought they want to
[8:55] know uh you know what it is well we're
[8:59] here in the end time and being here in
[9:02] the end time we ought to uh be able to
[9:06] believe the message of the hour and go
[9:09] to the message for the answer instead of
[9:11] saying I believe it's this or I believe
[9:13] it's that amen because uh misinterpreted
[9:16] theology brother random said which is
[9:19] man's ideas placed upon the word of God
[9:22] right has made the mass confusion well
[9:25] if the same thing is still here in the
[9:27] message of the hour with the prophet's
[9:28] message that has been brought Mass
[9:30] confusion is around the the message or
[9:33] the hour about marriage and divorce or
[9:36] whatever you know and things and and
[9:38] that's just normal because you're
[9:40] dealing with human
[9:42] beings long as you're dealing with human
[9:44] beings you got human problems I believe
[9:48] cuz that's what happened with Eve in the
[9:50] garden right she said I believe and that
[9:54] messed this whole thing up all right now
[9:57] don't don't try to go in into and you're
[9:59] thinking of divorces and things until we
[10:03] get back and speak on it okay amen
[10:05] because you're going to be running your
[10:07] mind out here and and you're you're not
[10:09] going to understand what's over here let
[10:13] me give you an example just came to me
[10:15] in the study there a while ago
[10:18] uh suppose we didn't have a prophet's
[10:21] message and as I said a moment ago we
[10:24] would have the
[10:26] Bible and by that Bible it has made Miss
[10:29] interpreted theology right amen all kind
[10:31] of mass
[10:32] confusions you're okay here you're not
[10:35] okay here this group here that group
[10:36] here and all like that and and they will
[10:38] none of them take all of what the Bible
[10:42] says all right now we will show these
[10:45] things as we get on into the message
[10:48] more and I believe every
[10:51] scripture is inspired of God and it is
[10:55] God's word all right but now we must get
[10:58] it lined up
[11:00] correctly because if we don't then we
[11:03] will misinterpret what is being said
[11:05] sensible all right now in the organized
[11:09] religion world and probably a lot of
[11:13] people in this message are believe in
[11:14] the same thing uh they don't believe
[11:18] that uh you know that an engagement is a
[11:23] wedding all
[11:25] right
[11:27] now I I know maybe I'm carnal and that's
[11:30] that's just I just like to speak carnal
[11:31] a lot of time if we was an organized
[11:34] religion and talking about an engagement
[11:36] and you'd say an engagement is
[11:39] wedding say I'm putting this in here now
[11:41] because it'll pop up in somebody's mind
[11:44] so you'll just realize that the Holy
[11:46] Spirit can answer something before you
[11:49] ask it all
[11:50] righten now suppose we had no message of
[11:53] the hour to go to and we would run it
[11:56] backwards and forth and try to pick up
[11:58] this or that or the other out of the
[11:59] scripture or even having the message of
[12:02] the hour we would just pick out what we
[12:04] want
[12:07] now to have a
[12:12] marriage let's see how I can
[12:19] State how are you going to have a
[12:27] divorce
[12:31] upon what we believe of marriage
[12:33] according to the world
[12:35] standards and denominationalism and
[12:38] let's say the people of the message a
[12:40] lot of how can you have a
[12:49] divorcement
[12:53] okay but you see if you can have an
[12:56] engagement oh
[12:59] in the correct
[13:01] order you can have a
[13:07] divorcement all right now putting this
[13:10] in because I know it's going to come up
[13:12] see in your mind so that's
[13:14] why somebody will
[13:17] somewhere see if you're engaged that's a
[13:20] vow right
[13:26] right then if you're divorced you know
[13:29] what that is that's breaking a v amen no
[13:34] it's legal paper
[13:37] see you can't solve the problem in
[13:39] Humanity's mind amen they won't even
[13:42] listen to
[13:44] you whatever grounds will constitute a
[13:47] marriage
[13:49] right to reverse that
[13:52] grounds would constitute a
[13:55] divorce you following me right
[14:03] now you want me to state that again
[14:05] whatever constitutes a
[14:08] marriage a reversal of
[14:11] that would constitute a
[14:15] divorce because you're going to have to
[14:17] deal with a lot of things see
[14:20] um not throwing off on the the African
[14:23] people or whatever but you know what I
[14:26] say is true there is places where you
[14:28] just step over a stick and you're
[14:31] married
[14:32] right well do you step back over the
[14:36] stick the other way and you're
[14:38] divorced what but there's got to be some
[14:42] form or or way of handling things and
[14:46] they have one you know they have their
[14:50] ways of doing you know of constituting a
[14:53] marriage and they have their ways of
[14:56] constituting the fact that it's not a
[14:57] marriage anymore
[15:00] and
[15:00] see a vow is a vow and a divorce is
[15:05] disan that
[15:07] vow to take it away so I'll put that in
[15:09] before you start then when we get into
[15:11] the message the then you realize that
[15:15] I'm cutting it off now if you don't have
[15:18] the much you know if you don't think on
[15:20] it that because you know a lot of people
[15:23] have the concept of weddings and a lot
[15:25] of things or
[15:26] marriages as to being this way that away
[15:29] whatever this is that is it's going to
[15:30] be here that got to be
[15:32] there but just remember wherever it's
[15:36] at whether it's stepping over a
[15:42] stick there has already been a
[15:45] vate all
[15:48] right that is your
[15:50] vow all right now that's why you know
[15:54] automatically then that brother Dale
[15:57] believes no and we will try to prove by
[16:00] the Bible
[16:02] that a
[16:04] marriage is not when you're given the
[16:07] right to go to bed together that's
[16:10] right if it was how you going to divorce
[16:15] that you
[16:17] see to put them up front see and I'm not
[16:21] picking on nobody I'm just putting up
[16:22] front to
[16:24] point so we better settle down in to see
[16:26] what the prophet in the Bible has to say
[16:29] amen all right then we can take our
[16:31] thoughts and ideas that's why I chose to
[16:34] title it for a while we'll be marriage
[16:36] and divorce but we will be dealing what
[16:38] is a marriage or what constitutes a
[16:41] marriage we won't be talking about a
[16:43] wedding because see you have your vows
[16:47] you have your engagements you have you
[16:49] know the things of that then you have a
[16:51] wedding supper and and then you have a
[16:53] wedding well then in some countries you
[16:56] have the vows and and the things and you
[16:58] you have a this and then you have a
[17:00] wedding supper on the other end of it or
[17:02] something cuz we're going to the wedding
[17:04] supper in the
[17:06] sky all right so now remember also that
[17:10] the thing that I've always taught
[17:12] you that the only way I can follow
[17:15] anything in the correct line up for me
[17:18] now is I must
[17:21] see by my new
[17:26] birth amen
[17:28] when anything is cuz if it don't line up
[17:31] in my new
[17:33] birth then then I can't believe it right
[17:36] well you just don't believe the word
[17:38] it's all
[17:38] right we'll find out whether we do or
[17:41] not but that's all right what do you
[17:44] judge it
[17:49] by see a lot of people in the message
[17:51] are still judging things by what their
[17:55] organizational mind was before they came
[17:57] in the message
[18:00] and that's what the hindrance is it's
[18:03] what grandma taught
[18:05] him you
[18:07] know what was taught by the churches
[18:09] they came from still makes a bearing
[18:11] upon our minds and our
[18:15] thinking and in doing that then it makes
[18:17] it into a a mass
[18:21] confusion all right but now let's just
[18:23] deal with what is a
[18:25] marriage CU there's no need to speak on
[18:27] a divorce until we find out what a
[18:29] marriage is right see then we'll be able
[18:32] to easily find out what a divorcement
[18:33] can
[18:34] be all
[18:36] right now I wrote this cuz I write my
[18:39] own notes to myself there's many people
[18:42] that believe in many different ways or
[18:44] thoughts about what is a
[18:47] marriage you know what constitutes a
[18:56] marriage and that's why I chose
[18:59] to use the word marriage and not the
[19:01] word
[19:03] wedding because if you if you talk about
[19:05] wedding everybody have the same
[19:07] thought because wedding is a terminology
[19:11] of the day wedding you know getting
[19:13] we're getting married wedding see that's
[19:15] what most people thinks is is when you
[19:19] stand before the preacher and repeat
[19:21] your
[19:23] vows that you're married right all right
[19:27] now some believe when you go to the
[19:30] bedroom you know what I'm see
[19:33] honeymoon that that's when you're
[19:37] married
[19:38] right but you see how would you tie that
[19:41] together to get it to come out to the
[19:43] right order and especially tight with
[19:46] your new
[19:50] birth
[19:54] now see let's go through and let's see
[19:58] that there's a
[19:59] process and Wade's going to cover these
[20:01] later so I'm not going through it uh of
[20:04] the dating the things like that all
[20:06] right he's going to get into that so I'm
[20:07] not going to go through that okay uh he
[20:10] can use the he can take the time to
[20:13] express those things we will mention
[20:16] something things as we go along but you
[20:20] know a man told me one time he
[20:22] said you can go up to
[20:26] courthouse and he said
[20:29] you can see that I've never been married
[20:31] at one
[20:34] time well what he meant was the
[20:36] paperwork right I mean sensible that's
[20:39] what he meant he only had
[20:43] paperwork but how many times was he
[20:46] engaged before them or
[20:49] whatever you
[20:52] know see we we need to get down to the
[20:55] to the bar facts of it and just put it
[20:57] down and say well this is it and let's
[20:59] see what we're going to
[21:01] do see there can't be a divorce until
[21:04] first there's a
[21:06] marriage all right now I got it wrote
[21:09] here quote this to you that are
[21:11] listening in by way of the internet or
[21:14] by the way of the tape systems uh please
[21:18] pay me enough respect to listen to All
[21:21] That is said about the point of what is
[21:23] a marriage or what makes a marriage or
[21:26] what will make a divorce you owe me that
[21:29] much because you listen to a one-sided
[21:32] thing you get a one-sided
[21:34] story all right see then you won't know
[21:37] what's being said all right now as I
[21:42] said whatever would constitute a
[21:48] marriage the reversal of that will
[21:51] constitute a
[21:53] divorce see we think of divorce as the
[21:55] paperwork at the court we think of a
[21:58] marriage is the paperwork at the court
[22:01] you
[22:02] know right but see that's not
[22:07] scriptural that's not what we read there
[22:09] in the
[22:12] Bible now we put a lot of emphasis go
[22:14] ahead brother
[22:16] um Anderson pull back up Matthew
[22:21] 1 those who want to even use the quotes
[22:26] of a spouse
[22:29] Etc will only
[22:32] mention that it says to Joseph fear not
[22:35] to take unto the Murray thy
[22:38] wife all right but look what the
[22:40] scripture
[22:43] say now the birth of Jesus Christ on
[22:45] this life when his mother Mary was a
[22:46] spoused to
[22:48] Joseph that's easy to con engaged the
[22:52] word engaged is only used one time in
[22:53] the Bible that's in the Old Testament so
[22:55] that's a modern terminology of forms of
[22:57] word words okay it's only used one time
[22:59] in the old test the word engage is is
[23:02] used different but
[23:04] listen we'll prove in the minute the
[23:07] spouse to gug and all will be the same
[23:08] word all right let's see mother Mary was
[23:11] spoused to Joseph before they came
[23:12] together she was found with child of the
[23:13] Holy Ghost then Joseph her
[23:17] husband see we're quick to to speak
[23:20] about if you're not to take unto thee
[23:22] marry thy wife we don't look at the
[23:25] other where it says in Joseph her husb
[23:27] husband being a just man you know and
[23:30] the Lord appeared unto him and and tells
[23:32] him you know that it's conceed then it
[23:35] says you know and reminds him of the
[23:38] scriptures that a virgin shall
[23:41] conceive and bring forth a child all
[23:44] right now here's a little point that I
[23:46] just always try to put in on marriage
[23:48] and
[23:50] divorce had it not been that Joseph had
[23:53] accepted Mary what would happen to
[23:56] her
[23:58] she would have been stoned
[24:01] right you agree that was the law she
[24:05] would have been stoned all right now A
[24:09] Father's
[24:11] protection of a dog of a his daughter is
[24:14] one thing and we'll cover
[24:18] that but a
[24:20] husband has the greater Authority
[24:24] amen because he's taking her unto
[24:27] himself amen the father is only covering
[24:31] his
[24:34] daughter you
[24:36] understand so the Bible said it was her
[24:39] husband amen and she was his wife now
[24:42] they were only a spouse and before they
[24:45] came
[24:47] together now we understand terminologies
[24:49] we know what that means right amen right
[24:53] before they came together all right now
[24:56] in doing that let's think about
[25:00] it husband and
[25:05] wife how did they become husband and
[25:10] wife and I'm asking the
[25:13] point why was it not just a father's
[25:18] protection for a virgin to be able to
[25:25] conceive are you listening why wasn't
[25:28] just a
[25:29] father in his disallow allowing of vows
[25:33] etc etc as we get into
[25:37] Deuteronomy but it says her
[25:40] husband see because the husband would
[25:42] would be the only one who would have the
[25:45] perfect total legal authority of the
[25:48] word of God to be able to take
[25:53] her and we know there was no father back
[25:56] there in Genesis but Adam had to take
[26:01] Eve all
[26:03] right
[26:05] now we know that Joseph never knew Eve
[26:09] never knew Mary until she
[26:11] conceived the child but the Bible said
[26:15] never and knew or
[26:18] not he knew or not until she F the baby
[26:21] was born all right see because that
[26:25] wouldn't that would have been wrong for
[26:26] him to done that
[26:28] right but he was the only one that could
[26:30] protect her right so look the way God
[26:34] does things that's right had he sent a
[26:38] virgin without a protective covering
[26:41] they would have killed her
[26:44] right so he sent it to where that it
[26:47] would be the husband that would
[26:50] protect you know her all right in other
[26:54] words marry her not intercourse that's
[26:57] what everybody want to do in the message
[26:58] with Adam and Eve you know he had
[26:59] intercourse with her to save her no no
[27:01] no no he took her as his wife that's
[27:04] right the Intercourse was a
[27:09] secondary
[27:13] right but see it meant it had to be a
[27:17] husband and the husband part comes in on
[27:19] the part that they were a
[27:23] spouse all right now we're going to use
[27:26] a lot of scriptures and lot of things
[27:28] together so I hope you'll follow with
[27:32] us and in Luke 1:27 go ahead
[27:36] brother
[27:39] Anderson I want to give you the verses
[27:41] and the word and then the
[27:43] definition okay so that way you will see
[27:48] you know what's going on in luk we find
[27:50] to a virgin a spouse to a man all right
[27:53] what does the word espouse
[27:55] mean the word espouse house comes from
[27:58] the Greek word
[28:00] 3423 and don't ask me to pronounce him
[28:02] big old words cuz I ain't got the
[28:04] education forget it but it means a
[28:07] spouse in other
[28:08] words but the definition is to woo
[28:14] her and ask her in marriage now that's
[28:17] the word of
[28:21] spouse see to be promised in
[28:25] marriage be betr
[28:29] betro is not a new testament
[28:31] word it is not used in the New Testament
[28:35] it is only used um nine times I think
[28:38] that's right I'll get to it in a minute
[28:39] and tell you it's used in the Old
[28:41] Testament it's an Old Testament word but
[28:43] you'll find a definition for that but
[28:45] what's the definition of the word
[28:48] espoused all right we'll find in a
[28:50] minute it means
[28:52] engaged all right now we will find in a
[28:56] little bit when
[28:57] what what is an
[28:59] engagement now I like to cover the whole
[29:02] thing where you don't have no problems
[29:04] with what is an engagement or a spouse
[29:07] or a
[29:08] betro it means when a boy has asked a
[29:11] girl to marry
[29:12] him and she accepts that's
[29:16] amen now if he asked her to marry
[29:20] him that don't make a marriage that's
[29:24] right amen you understand right right
[29:27] cuz it did you just walk down the street
[29:29] and say I accept you as my wife I accept
[29:32] you as my wife I accept you as my that's
[29:33] the way the world's done it you know in
[29:35] a roundabout way but that would be the
[29:38] carnality of
[29:41] mankind I Know a Man one time that a
[29:44] lady sang a song and he told went and
[29:46] told her said you're my wife you know
[29:47] she wound up in his wife so evidently it
[29:49] didn't work out but that didn't make her
[29:52] his wife is my point because he went and
[29:54] told her all right so so Joseph and Mary
[29:58] if you want the quotes I can give them
[29:59] to you where brother R said they would
[30:01] set out on the porch after Sunday school
[30:04] or after going to church and and said
[30:07] they would talk about the Bible and the
[30:10] things you know right and that finally
[30:12] Mary told Joseph you know all right but
[30:16] the word
[30:17] espoused it means to woo her and to ask
[30:22] her in marriage to be promised in
[30:24] marriage or be
[30:26] betr
[30:27] now girls if some Boy comes along and
[30:29] ask you to marry and we're not talking
[30:33] we're not playing kids okay all kids
[30:37] which they shouldn't do it cuz they've
[30:39] heard the people do it but you know the
[30:41] little kids and I come in from school
[30:42] one day and she said that mama said so
[30:45] and so is going together well I mean
[30:48] you're 5 years
[30:49] old I want to know where they
[30:52] going I mean I'm
[30:55] done I said where they going you know
[30:58] now you know what I mean they're going
[31:03] together well now how many times you
[31:06] girls and how many times little boys
[31:08] have you got into discussions with
[31:10] things with girls and
[31:11] boys don't do that because it's it's
[31:15] improper you know and after you reach a
[31:18] certain
[31:19] age you're accountable that's right
[31:24] amen all right we will cover the vows
[31:26] and things probably in another message
[31:29] but you're
[31:33] accountable Billy Paul come to his
[31:36] daddy he said Daddy that I'm getting
[31:41] married brother brother told him to go
[31:43] stick his head in a bucket or
[31:45] something he went in and told his mother
[31:47] that they was getting
[31:49] married and said she laughed at him now
[31:52] brother Brown said he married some
[31:54] common grade school now what is a common
[31:56] grade school
[31:57] it would have to be probably 8th or
[31:59] ninth grade or 10th grade would be
[32:01] common right I don't know what the word
[32:03] common means when you're talking about
[32:04] schools anybody know what year is it I
[32:07] mean is it fifth grade sixth grade
[32:09] seventh grade what I don't know but he
[32:10] said some common grade but he said they
[32:14] got
[32:15] married and he said they was
[32:18] married he said we had to wedding an old
[32:22] her father and I but he refused to do
[32:25] his own son's wedding
[32:27] cuz he said he's married
[32:30] he so just get to point now what brother
[32:33] Dale believes whether you want to
[32:34] believe it even with all we
[32:36] read when a girl a boy ask a girl to
[32:38] marry now come on we're in a day when a
[32:40] girl ask the
[32:42] boys right right right well some of you
[32:46] boys say well now I never asked her she
[32:48] asked me well did you accept
[32:56] her
[32:58] and we would read where the Prophet said
[33:00] boy
[33:02] girl see we don't play we we try to
[33:05] bring it by the
[33:06] truth but see just don't make your
[33:10] vows because
[33:12] Matthew I got it in here somewhere by
[33:14] your words you be justified and by your
[33:16] words you be
[33:17] condemned that's Matthew
[33:21] 12:37 right all right so don't make and
[33:25] play
[33:25] games parents teach your children not to
[33:28] play games
[33:31] amen you know wedding
[33:35] games if we'd have been taught that way
[33:37] all the way down then when some boy ask
[33:39] a girl to marry her then you
[33:44] know but you see what I'm getting at a
[33:47] wedding what is a
[33:50] marriage Joseph and Mary was married
[33:54] right amen but they never lived together
[33:58] as husband and wife until after the baby
[34:00] was born that's
[34:04] right now I've looked to try to find
[34:06] this but I'm sure that anybody with
[34:08] common sense ought to realize Joseph and
[34:10] Mary somewhere went on and went through
[34:13] the fact of
[34:15] vows wouldn't you think so somewhere in
[34:18] that one year don't you think that they
[34:20] would because he protected
[34:23] her irregardless of whether you believe
[34:25] that or not it don't make no difference
[34:26] that's all right because they had
[34:28] already made their
[34:31] vows when he asked her to marry him and
[34:34] she
[34:36] accepted God counted him married and
[34:38] called him husband and
[34:42] wife called him a
[34:44] spoused all right now in doing
[34:51] that look what you turn out to
[34:55] be the word espoused is
[34:59] used the same way in Matthew 1:18 I
[35:03] don't have to pull that one
[35:06] up it is the word of spouse which comes
[35:08] from the
[35:10] 3223 which is to to woo
[35:13] her and ask her in marriage
[35:17] see that would turned out to be a
[35:19] wedding all right now the word espoused
[35:23] is used five times one time in the old
[35:26] Testament and four times in the New
[35:28] Testament all right now Paul uses the
[35:32] word
[35:34] espoused in 2 Corinthians
[35:38] 112 all right for I am jealous over you
[35:41] with Godly jealousy for I have
[35:44] espoused y now when we cover in this I
[35:50] want you to think on
[35:52] it uh foreign
[35:55] countries a lot of lot of places they
[35:57] pick the husband and
[35:59] wife you know right especially the uh
[36:03] the wife for the
[36:05] husband and you
[36:08] know they go through that they they
[36:10] don't give them now brother per even
[36:13] said they do know about the things and
[36:15] kind of in an agreement form and know
[36:17] about it a lot of times but a lot of
[36:20] times they're just put
[36:23] together and maybe they might be put
[36:25] together when they're young as as far as
[36:27] counting them
[36:28] married some of you your African folks
[36:30] you know what I'm talking about in your
[36:32] your countries and what you do but it's
[36:35] still a it's still when you come
[36:36] together according to them it's a
[36:38] wedding
[36:40] right because that's the custom the ways
[36:43] and to do it so look what Paul said Paul
[36:45] said for I have espoused
[36:53] you Paul said us because that a word a
[36:57] spouse Paul is saying I set you to
[37:01] Christ to be married to
[37:05] him I've set you aside because that
[37:07] Greek word is
[37:09] 718 all right and watch it says to join
[37:13] or to fit together to betro a daughter
[37:16] to anyone to join to oneself in other
[37:19] words to marry the daughter of any one
[37:22] to bet TR to give one in marriage to
[37:25] anyone all right Paul is saying I have
[37:29] given you I have by the gospel I
[37:32] preached unto you I have espoused you to
[37:36] Christ see because those that received
[37:39] the new birth under Paul's message was
[37:41] espoused to
[37:43] Christ all right that's even you and I
[37:46] see we're still being espoused to Christ
[37:48] by Paul and his his message I'm just
[37:51] giving you the fact of what it means
[37:53] even to the word espouse I just used one
[37:56] time in 2 Samuel 3:14 in the Old
[38:01] Testament and David sent Messengers to
[38:03] whatever who the name is Char son saying
[38:06] deliver me my wife Michelle which I
[38:09] spouse to me for 100 forkins of the
[38:12] Philistines all right now that's when
[38:15] David goes back you remember the whole
[38:18] story his wife she goes off marries a
[38:20] guy he comes back and they send over
[38:22] there to get her you remember the story
[38:24] they go over there to get her want I
[38:27] mean David wants
[38:29] her you know to come back because you
[38:32] know she's his spoused really wanted her
[38:35] just because she was the King's Daughter
[38:37] and to keep his record running good you
[38:39] know make everything okay but beside the
[38:41] point I'm getting at the point what the
[38:42] word means David knew that she was
[38:46] espouse to
[38:48] him they had never come together as
[38:50] husband and wife she was spouse David
[38:53] gets run off and all givs her to
[38:55] somebody else huh well look what the
[38:57] word of it it means see to betr or
[39:01] engaged
[39:02] engaged to be
[39:05] betral all right so David had an
[39:08] understanding there that that is my wife
[39:11] we were
[39:13] engaged all right now then that would
[39:17] cover that part the word
[39:20] engaged the word engaged because it can
[39:22] mean Engage The Enemy engage the truth
[39:25] the enemy you know but the word
[39:28] engaged which is taken from Jeremiah 30
[39:30] and
[39:32] 21 and the noble shall be of themselves
[39:35] and their governor shall proceed from
[39:37] the midst of
[39:38] them and I will cause him to draw near
[39:41] and he shall approach unto me for who is
[39:44] this that engaged his heart to approach
[39:47] unto me sayth the Lord now someone
[39:51] engaged his heart or dedicated or set
[39:54] his heart cuz that meaning of that word
[39:56] is to pledge comes from the Hebrews 6148
[40:00] it means to pledge to exchange mortgage
[40:03] engage occupy undertake for give pledges
[40:07] to to become you know you read all the
[40:09] rest of the definition don't it's just
[40:11] meaning of it's the same word for
[40:15] engage because then we' see that
[40:17] engage and the spouse is the same
[40:21] word right all right now let's go over
[40:24] to the word betro
[40:27] the word
[40:28] betro is
[40:30] used only uh three times and it's only
[40:35] in the Old
[40:36] Testament is actually the word betro but
[40:39] the word
[40:40] betro all
[40:42] right is used nine times and they're all
[40:45] in the Old Testament form so we look at
[40:46] the wording now if a Downs that is a
[40:50] verion be betroth unto a husband and a
[40:52] man find her to sit in line with her now
[40:54] we'll get more to that and explain it
[40:56] after a while if we have time tonight we
[40:58] will get into to that point so just hang
[41:00] on to what I'm getting the definitions
[41:02] of the words okay it comes from strongs
[41:05] 3259 which is mean to fix a point
[41:08] assembly meet set betr to a point assign
[41:10] designate to meet in other words coming
[41:13] out to be something set or the point
[41:16] because it's the same
[41:18] word
[41:20] betroth she was
[41:22] betro this virgin be betro she she was
[41:27] engaged she was a
[41:29] spoused she had made her vows as
[41:33] to the boy they had made their vows
[41:36] because that's where you're married at
[41:38] you're married by your
[41:39] vows you're not married by what the law
[41:45] says it's not whether the law says it
[41:48] it's whether you say
[41:50] it and what you
[41:52] mean now I I know we live in a day when
[41:58] um what president was it said he he
[42:01] couldn't remember Reagan was it Reagan
[42:04] had a lapse of memory believe it's right
[42:07] we're in we're in the day when people
[42:09] want to have laps of memory you know and
[42:12] they'll say I really can't remember
[42:14] whether he asked me or I asked
[42:16] him but we've been married for 40 years
[42:19] you know or we've been living
[42:22] together and people in the message has
[42:24] got it going real good you know as long
[42:26] as you don't have the long as you don't
[42:29] make your vows and as long as you don't
[42:30] go down to the justice of peace and get
[42:33] you just live together all you want to
[42:34] and have 14 kids and then separate and
[42:36] just go somewhere else you know you want
[42:39] be nine
[42:40] names okay no we need to but it's
[42:45] there CU it's a garbage can right now I
[42:49] don't mean the truth of marriage and
[42:50] divorce the truth of marriage and
[42:51] divorce is wonderful cuz it types your
[42:53] new birth that's what I'm G all the go
[42:56] PA said I espoused you the same
[42:58] word for your new birth that you're
[43:01] espoused to Jesus Christ by that new
[43:03] birth is in you is the same word that
[43:05] Joseph and Mary was a spoused right it's
[43:09] the same word that we make our vows as
[43:11] husband and wife is a
[43:14] spouse see we can come up and say well I
[43:17] don't really
[43:20] remember what's the
[43:23] problem you can sure remember the day
[43:26] you've done this that and the
[43:28] other why can't you remember what's
[43:30] going on that's blunt sorry but
[43:35] listen right now according to the
[43:39] Bible if you're
[43:41] engaged if you make your
[43:44] vows you know the boy asks the girl she
[43:49] accepts then that's an engagement
[43:53] amen that's a spouse right
[43:57] that's
[43:58] betroth that's what I'm giving all those
[44:00] words for am CU it all turn out to be
[44:03] the same same thing something set to a
[44:05] point and even like a foreign country we
[44:08] covered where the mama and the
[44:13] daddy they pick out for their son a
[44:17] wife and they go through the Diaries or
[44:19] what those words are you know and paying
[44:22] for it and all this that and the other
[44:24] now probably there's not word there in
[44:26] their languages means
[44:30] engaged right I remember when I was in
[44:34] Brazil and I had made that mistake of
[44:35] saying meat you know the sister was a
[44:38] help meat and the guy interpreted help
[44:41] meat me8 and I'm me T all right so it
[44:46] got a
[44:47] problem so I said all right what's your
[44:51] word it was what I asked I said what is
[44:53] your
[44:54] word
[44:56] for me our our marriage and God pointed
[45:00] to his ring and said
[45:06] commitment all right that was their word
[45:09] they it now the word
[45:11] engaged and now the word betral it was
[45:14] commitment right now maybe they got it
[45:16] in their language you understand what
[45:17] I'm saying I'm just trying to to
[45:21] speak but you see we claim stupidity in
[45:24] our minds that we don't know that when
[45:26] the law even tells you that what is
[45:28] it you you you can't
[45:31] plead uh that you don't
[45:34] know when something what is it ignorance
[45:38] ignorance yeah you stand out on the side
[45:40] the highway and you're standing there
[45:42] and you walked out of your house you
[45:44] walk down to the front of your driveway
[45:45] at home and you stand there and two guys
[45:48] gets in the car and they drag race
[45:51] you're an accomplice whether you want to
[45:53] agree with it or not they go all get you
[45:54] for that right
[45:57] you don't have to be all of these other
[45:59] things all right now they might not have
[46:02] the
[46:03] words
[46:05] Kenya might not have the words espoused
[46:08] engaged betrothed Etc but they've got a
[46:11] word
[46:13] there that the couple has made their
[46:16] commitment in one form and the
[46:18] other now they can't step over the
[46:24] stick come on
[46:26] right it ain't a guy that goes gets his
[46:29] wife and say step over his s and you
[46:31] mind no they're not
[46:34] dumb they have to take mergency test you
[46:37] want to read from your
[46:38] Prophet they're supposed
[46:42] to all
[46:44] right the commitment is your
[46:47] mindset you understand that's
[46:51] right in the state of Georgia if you
[46:53] live together over 24 hours with the
[46:57] thoughts of getting married you are
[47:00] called common law
[47:02] marriage whether you like it or
[47:06] not see because they know you had some
[47:09] form of
[47:11] commitment this is not just a point of
[47:13] grabbing somebody's hand step over a
[47:15] stick and you're
[47:17] married I saw a a documentary on a
[47:21] wedding one time where this man over
[47:23] here was going goes over to you know and
[47:26] he asked the father's permission he gets
[47:29] all of the different things and he
[47:30] offers the dowy and he builds a house
[47:33] they ain't stepped over the stick
[47:36] yet and they're not living
[47:41] together it's just their vows but
[47:43] they're married when they've commit
[47:46] themselves I got tick with that one
[47:48] because the way that everything went but
[47:51] it they finally got married you know
[47:52] what they finally stepped over into his
[47:54] little house he built you and you know
[47:56] what is
[47:58] married but now we'll cover later what I
[48:00] know going have time tonight that if he
[48:03] found some uncleanness in her
[48:06] right that's
[48:08] right some
[48:11] problem
[48:13] righten he's automatically divorced and
[48:18] killed right so let's get it
[48:21] straight an
[48:24] engagement is a marriage
[48:28] right yes sir when you ask that girl to
[48:30] marry you and she accepted yep you
[48:33] marryed that's
[48:36] right now that don't give you no right
[48:38] to go out and start living together
[48:41] right right that's unclean living right
[48:45] the state don't even allow
[48:47] that you know you're not supposed to do
[48:49] it we'll read what the Propet is
[48:53] say but you see still when you ask that
[48:56] girl to marry you and she accepts
[48:58] according to the Bible the way I see it
[49:01] amen Joseph and Mary went through that
[49:03] process and they were a spouse right
[49:06] amen remember she goes over to see
[49:08] Elizabeth and tells Elizabeth she's
[49:10] caring a child well you and Joseph done
[49:11] got married now that's a word that goes
[49:14] up
[49:17] married
[49:21] no because the word married is
[49:24] interchangeable
[49:26] you can use the word marriage to
[49:30] refer you
[49:31] know people say when you
[49:34] married now if you don't agree with this
[49:37] just Coast it down
[49:40] but suppose sister brother collie you
[49:44] and sister Ruth went through the vows
[49:46] you know of your own asking that's not
[49:48] the wedding vows at the church now the
[49:52] asking is your vow all right
[49:56] then somebody come along and say you you
[49:58] and you and and James married
[50:03] no right that's right well because it's
[50:06] an
[50:07] engagement all right but as far as God
[50:09] is
[50:12] concerned CU it's not a drunken
[50:14] magistrate will read it your Prophet
[50:16] said joins you
[50:17] together he really says it this way it
[50:19] said what God has joined together let no
[50:21] man put us under he said not what a
[50:23] drunken magistrate he said that can be
[50:25] put us under
[50:26] anytime you know they can just divorce
[50:28] married whatever going
[50:31] on but what is a wedding
[50:34] now a
[50:36] marriage I'm just talking about you
[50:39] accepting you the boy asking you accept
[50:42] that's what I'm talking
[50:44] about far as God is concerned you're
[50:46] married right amen right and we can
[50:50] cover more into these other things but
[50:54] girls and
[50:57] boys amen girls and
[51:01] boys you have a
[51:05] virginity Paul speaks of both girls and
[51:08] boys men and women
[51:11] whatever man has a virginity as well as
[51:14] a woman we're in the day the man can
[51:16] like my mother used to say the the man
[51:17] can get out and commit adultery and run
[51:19] around and do all kind of things and put
[51:21] a suit on go to church and he called a
[51:22] brother make him a good Deacon yeah
[51:26] cuz he ain't been to the courthouse and
[51:27] got married cuz we don't believe it in
[51:29] having a deacon here that's married it's
[51:31] more than one time you know she said a
[51:34] woman do one thing she got to wear an
[51:35] adultery around her neck you used to do
[51:37] that right
[51:39] right but see that's not the Bible the
[51:42] Bible Paul tells you of the the man with
[51:44] his virginity as well as the woman with
[51:46] her
[51:47] virginity all right
[51:52] now the same way he can cover those fors
[51:54] when he gets to it
[51:56] all right does everybody understand what
[51:58] I'm saying not I ain't ask you never ask
[52:01] nobody to agree with me you know
[52:03] that I ask you what does the word say am
[52:09] right now we don't want to get into all
[52:11] the others we're going to get into
[52:12] divorce if you get into the other parts
[52:15] of it we're going to get into the
[52:16] divorce
[52:17] situation let's stick to the marriage
[52:19] all
[52:20] right well then according to a spouse
[52:24] engaged
[52:28] mro when you ask the girl that she
[52:30] accept you you're
[52:33] married that's in God's eyes amen right
[52:38] you go and marry somebody
[52:40] else we'll read in a minute when the
[52:42] prophet tells you what that turned out
[52:43] to be boy ask a girl to marry him and
[52:47] she accepts and the girl goes off and
[52:48] Mar somewhere outse she's committing
[52:50] adultery but it's the same for him if he
[52:52] ask her and he goes off and Mar married
[52:55] somebody else he's living in adultery
[52:57] right am that's
[53:01] right that's
[53:03] Bible that ain't our thoughts and
[53:06] ideas so it's straight blunt
[53:13] plain we can get down into really some
[53:16] some scriptures if you want to in the
[53:18] prophet's
[53:21] definition but we'll just try to stay
[53:23] with it as best we can
[53:25] all right let's go to what the prophet
[53:29] had to say about a
[53:33] wedding but the first quote brother
[53:36] which we have seen his star in the east
[53:37] and come to worship Him
[53:44] 63126 let's see what brother brand man
[53:46] to
[53:47] say you talking about the almighty God
[53:50] and raled Joseph in a dream and Joseph
[53:53] was a good man he was son of David and
[53:55] was espouse to
[53:57] Mary and I'd like to pass this on before
[54:00] we go further espousal in the East was
[54:04] the same as marriage is betral now if I
[54:07] pronounce that word wrong you make it
[54:09] right
[54:10] okay as soon as they as they were
[54:13] espoused they were
[54:17] married when that sacred vow between
[54:19] them was taken read Deuteronomy
[54:23] 22:23 and you will find out that when
[54:26] this woman and man agreed to be married
[54:29] yet they did not take the vows for
[54:32] months later you know what he's talking
[54:34] about they didn't go before the the the
[54:37] preacher and repeat the vows all right
[54:40] you understand
[54:44] it if they did not take the V for month
[54:48] later if they even broke that vow they
[54:50] were guilty of adultery that's right
[54:53] when they were spoused they were just
[54:55] the same as marriage marriage the law
[54:58] had not given them rights to live
[55:00] together as husband and wife yet but
[55:03] before God when they promised one
[55:04] another their words were sealed in God's
[55:06] kingdom and to break that was just
[55:09] committing
[55:10] adultery and now Joseph was a spouse to
[55:13] Mary if Minister Brothers you'd study
[55:16] that right now right good and clear you
[55:19] up on this marriage and divorce case
[55:22] that's so so hard and different among
[55:25] most of the people today and notice
[55:27] Joseph her husband being a just man see
[55:30] now we find out that this could not be
[55:35] broken so now a spousal marriage go to
[55:39] the next one questions and answers
[55:42] 1964 8:30 the evening and the morning
[55:46] service book
[55:49] three M he's talking and bringing it
[55:51] down so you get all of it above
[55:54] and
[55:57] what it was this was a most of you know
[55:59] the story this is a man he comes walks
[56:01] into a church and he gets into the
[56:03] church and when he does he's coming in
[56:05] and there's nobody there and all at once
[56:07] he hears a man and a woman down at the
[56:09] front of the church and they're
[56:11] exchanging
[56:15] vows so when they get through and kiss
[56:17] and start out you know he stops and asks
[56:20] them you know what was going on so
[56:23] here's what the answer after a while he
[56:25] noticed here come he heard somebody
[56:26] talking he slipped up there to look and
[56:29] looked around to see whether it was the
[56:31] custodian it was a man in a woman
[56:33] standing before the altar holding one
[56:34] another's hand and said I take you dear
[56:37] to be my lawfully weeded wife see she
[56:40] said I take you dear to me my lawfully
[56:41] wted husband well he said this is a
[56:44] strange thing said this Pentecostal he
[56:47] said this man in woman getting married
[56:50] without a preacher and so we just sat
[56:53] down so we just sat down and waited and
[56:56] after they made their vows to live true
[56:58] to one another only death would separate
[57:01] them they put their arms around one
[57:03] another kissed each other turned around
[57:05] and walked out smiling he said just a
[57:07] moment he said I'm kind of curious I'm a
[57:10] stranger said you all getting married
[57:13] said yes without a
[57:16] preacher he said no then we've been
[57:19] married 40 years he said we've got and
[57:22] watch
[57:23] it we've been married 40 years he said
[57:26] we got married right here at this altar
[57:28] 40 years ago and every year we come back
[57:31] and renew our vows that's a good idea
[57:34] but as far as
[57:36] married when you promised her she takes
[57:39] your
[57:40] word and that's why I covered that a
[57:42] while ago it's not you just ask her and
[57:44] then she has nothing to do with it you
[57:47] know don't play that part where you
[57:49] women you don't have anything to do with
[57:50] I ask you and you're married to me now
[57:53] is she don't accept right all right she
[57:56] takes your word you take her word god
[57:58] takes both of
[57:59] you so just don't
[58:02] promise all right don't do the promises
[58:06] look at the next
[58:08] one now this is a continuation of
[58:11] reading so we'll go all the way down
[58:14] this is questions and ansers 60 question
[58:17] aners book two really is what's the two
[58:19] on there for on the old Styles 64 823
[58:23] the evening service paragraph 193
[58:26] through 197 I think brother Brandon what
[58:29] is the meaning of enement are people
[58:31] free to marry or is this just another
[58:33] word for divorce I would like some
[58:35] information on this sure they're married
[58:37] as long as they take that vow they're
[58:39] married just like a boy if a boy
[58:41] promises a girl to marry her under good
[58:44] faith he's obligated to that girl he's
[58:46] just as good as married to her the only
[58:48] thing the law does is gives you a Bill
[58:50] of Rights to live together to keep from
[58:53] being common law
[58:55] husband and wife but when a man tells a
[58:58] woman I will marry you honey I will take
[59:01] you for my wife will you take he's
[59:04] married your vow is
[59:06] sacred that's what marries you
[59:09] anyhow there's not no preacher can marry
[59:13] you no magistrate or nothing else it's
[59:16] your own vow to God and to this man when
[59:19] you promise you are
[59:21] married when you promise you're married
[59:23] it's not some
[59:25] preacher look at you say brother bradam
[59:27] is that you say you said you only
[59:29] answered that by the
[59:31] Bible did you want the Bible on it raise
[59:34] your hands if you want it now we got
[59:35] about six or eight minutes all right
[59:38] Joseph her husband being a just man her
[59:42] spouse husband already called her
[59:45] husband Joseph her husband being a just
[59:47] man who was mindly to put her away
[59:50] privately on this wi but before they
[59:52] came together she was found with a child
[59:54] of the Holy Ghost and the angel of the
[59:55] Lord appeared to him in a dream and said
[59:57] Joseph thy son of David fear not to take
[1:00:00] unto thee marry thy wife already married
[1:00:03] he's already promised
[1:00:07] her and of and little lady if you
[1:00:11] promise to marry that boy you're
[1:00:12] obligated to do it if you marry another
[1:00:15] after that obligation you will from now
[1:00:19] on anyhow you see you will be living in
[1:00:22] adultery and notice the same thing the
[1:00:24] boy promising to Mar a woman don't you
[1:00:27] make your vow to anybody unless you mean
[1:00:29] to stick with it remember there's the
[1:00:31] Bible for it Joseph promised to marry
[1:00:34] Mary and God said that's that that was
[1:00:38] read the Old Testament laws on that see
[1:00:40] the old test law if you promised to
[1:00:42] marry a young married woman and you
[1:00:44] married another one you was committing
[1:00:46] adultery and it drow you out of the camp
[1:00:49] yes sir you have to keep your vows when
[1:00:52] you promise a woman that she's a sacred
[1:00:55] little vessel and that's to bring CH
[1:00:57] child life into the world again so when
[1:01:00] you promise her you must marry
[1:01:03] her and that's why when somebody comes
[1:01:06] to
[1:01:07] me I ask this
[1:01:11] question I say have either one of
[1:01:15] you been married
[1:01:19] before they'll automatically say no okay
[1:01:22] question number two has either one of
[1:01:25] you ever been
[1:01:32] engaged if you have I will not do the wi
[1:01:36] now you know what I'm saying if they
[1:01:38] were engaged and the boy got killed or
[1:01:40] the girl got killed we got scripture
[1:01:43] right we're not F talking foolish come
[1:01:45] on we're talking a straight line of what
[1:01:48] it is I ask those questions I do not see
[1:01:52] in my ability as a minister to ask a boy
[1:01:57] has he ever had a
[1:01:59] girlfriend right you may differ with me
[1:02:01] on these ministers out there go ahead
[1:02:03] show me where it's at I do not see in my
[1:02:06] Ministry or far to what I can ask the
[1:02:09] girl has she ever had a boyfriend and
[1:02:12] you know what I mean by had on the boy
[1:02:15] and the
[1:02:16] girl because I always tell
[1:02:19] them the ones of you that have PR to me
[1:02:22] and that you know what I said
[1:02:25] I said your life between you two is your
[1:02:29] responsibility that's right if you've
[1:02:32] been untrue and he marries you and you
[1:02:34] don't tell him the prophet says he can
[1:02:36] put you
[1:02:38] away I explained this to them to the
[1:02:41] point of understanding it it's not from
[1:02:44] my my point of wanting to have the itch
[1:02:47] and ear to delve into what's going on
[1:02:50] it's my point to be
[1:02:53] blunt but I tell them say if you don't
[1:02:55] straighten up your life
[1:02:58] now if you don't tell that boy what
[1:03:01] you've done or that girl what you've
[1:03:02] done you're going to have trouble down
[1:03:04] the road so get it out of the way now
[1:03:07] right amen and why did God I would do it
[1:03:10] my wife is sitting there before I would
[1:03:13] ask her to marry her and I was a sinner
[1:03:15] lost in the world I told her before we
[1:03:18] talk about marriage I want to tell you
[1:03:21] my
[1:03:22] life right
[1:03:25] I didn't know the prophets and the
[1:03:26] message or anything but I wanted that
[1:03:30] straight I said I want no problems when
[1:03:32] we get
[1:03:33] married things to come up that you don't
[1:03:36] know
[1:03:37] about I want it to be settled here then
[1:03:40] if you want to marry me okay but I want
[1:03:42] to tell you and I even told her God I
[1:03:45] didn't know I said you don't have to
[1:03:46] tell me but I got to tell you cuz that
[1:03:50] was in my
[1:03:52] heart she didn't have any problems to
[1:03:54] tell me I had a lot of problems to tell
[1:03:59] her see a lot of preachers would
[1:04:01] disqualify that okay go
[1:04:05] ahead maybe I'm not supposed to be
[1:04:09] preaching
[1:04:11] okay but you show me one preacher in
[1:04:14] this world that can stand
[1:04:15] it the test of the
[1:04:19] word that's why we better all believe in
[1:04:22] grace and marriage and divorce that's
[1:04:24] right
[1:04:26] I don't care how pure you are you better
[1:04:27] believe in it we'll get down to those
[1:04:29] things all right so where did we get
[1:04:34] to we finish that one up then okay let's
[1:04:37] go to the next one which is invisible
[1:04:39] Union the Bri of Christ now if you'll
[1:04:41] notice these these points that I've been
[1:04:44] bringing out here have all been at least
[1:04:47] from the seals on
[1:04:49] up CU a lot of people thinks he changed
[1:04:52] his mind later so we just keep it above
[1:04:55] the seals and things
[1:04:58] okay so look what he says on invisible
[1:05:01] Union on the Bri 65 11:25 paragraph
[1:05:04] 83 Joseph fear not take unto thee Mary
[1:05:08] thy wife for that which is conceived in
[1:05:11] her is of the Holy Ghost he was minded
[1:05:14] to put her away privately see after he
[1:05:17] had already engaged to
[1:05:20] her when you're engaged to her as far as
[1:05:23] God is concerned ConEd you married to
[1:05:26] her okay that's his words right going on
[1:05:30] to the next one God in his is his own
[1:05:33] interpreter 64
[1:05:37] 205 it was so unusual until a good man
[1:05:40] by the name of Joseph her husband being
[1:05:42] a just man was not willing to make her a
[1:05:45] public example that good man in those
[1:05:47] days how it must have been with Joseph
[1:05:49] when he was engaged ESP spoused to Mary
[1:05:52] she was espoused in that day to break
[1:05:54] that was just the same as committing
[1:05:55] adultery and of course to Joseph it
[1:05:58] seemed like that Mary was trying to use
[1:06:00] him for a blockade or make him a shield
[1:06:03] for her wrong see another The Shield you
[1:06:04] see what I'm talking about want to go he
[1:06:06] could Shield
[1:06:09] her cuz the law couldn't kill her he had
[1:06:11] to cast the first stone right right now
[1:06:15] because here she was found to be a
[1:06:17] mother not being married only engaged a
[1:06:21] trick like that would be stoned to death
[1:06:23] it to be by the
[1:06:28] law the presence of God unrecognized 64
[1:06:34] 618 when no man should ever kiss a woman
[1:06:37] I'm just putting this one in wait you
[1:06:39] can use this one
[1:06:40] later till he Mar till he is married to
[1:06:44] her that's male and female glands
[1:06:46] Crossing let it be wherever it may be
[1:06:49] it's wrong it's potentially a set that
[1:06:53] when male and my glance touch it's a
[1:06:55] second and it's made a man kiss a man in
[1:06:58] the mouth remember this is

[1:08:07] lifted and folks we're not throwing off
[1:08:09] on nobody we tell it like it

[1:08:14] study one night I said is there any
[1:08:16] couple here they can say that they never
[1:08:20] kissed and I was referring to each other
[1:08:22] you know not who else kissed and never
[1:08:25] kissed before they married and I had one
[1:08:28] couple Bob and

[1:08:59] Crossing he said that's potential
[1:09:02] adultery don't do

[1:09:07] guilty I've been
[1:09:09] guilty so have

[1:09:34] man and before they come together once
[1:09:36] she's done she is found pregnant by
[1:09:38] somebody else then her own seed which is

[1:09:47] her boyfriend her engaged husband is
[1:09:51] found full of seed of another man what a
[1:09:53] disgrace
[1:09:54] that's exactly what Adam found that's
[1:09:56] what Christ has found couldn't wait
[1:09:59] that's what's the matter with the people
[1:10:00] today they can't wait for the real Holy
[1:10:02] Spirit to take the church in position
[1:10:05] they got to manufacture something work
[1:10:06] up something initial evidence speaking
[1:10:09] in tongues to get more members in the
[1:10:11] church all these kind of a Tommy Rock
[1:10:15] instead of waiting upon the Lord for the
[1:10:17] real manifestation of the resurrection
[1:10:19] of Christ making himself known among the
[1:10:22] people you can't
[1:10:25] wait bringing people into the church I
[1:10:28] get tickled at people let me say
[1:10:32] this you know people leave one church
[1:10:34] and go to another they say they're
[1:10:36] leaving the word cuz they left us I've
[1:10:38] never said that about nobody that's ever
[1:10:40] left
[1:10:41] here you find it see if I ever said that
[1:10:44] somebody left a word when they left here
[1:10:46] a lot of you said they left the word
[1:10:48] when they left here I never
[1:10:50] said why because that's their own
[1:10:52] business and my Point's always been one
[1:10:56] thing CU we can use it what we want
[1:10:59] to you got people leaving your church
[1:11:02] going somewhere else you say they're
[1:11:04] leaving the
[1:11:05] word well you know what the people over

[1:11:29] next time for the
[1:11:32] V now the church now is engaged to
[1:11:37] Christ

[1:11:44] wedding that's what Paul said I spous
[1:11:47] you I've engaged
[1:11:51] you you see that's like I said the start
[1:11:53] with if you get tight with your new
[1:11:55] birth what do you
[1:11:58] got when you're New
[1:12:01] Birth you accepted Jesus Christ
[1:12:05] right and he accepted
[1:12:11] you that might just be
[1:12:13] justification but it's the
[1:12:16] beginning and you know that holds
[1:12:18] because you want quotes on this that's
[1:12:22] what's wrong with the organized religion
[1:12:25] they accepted Jesus
[1:12:27] Christ he accepted them then they went
[1:12:30] out and start burying children to
[1:12:32] something
[1:12:36] else prove their an
[1:12:41] adulterous right come on now the church
[1:12:44] now is engaged to Christ for the wedding
[1:12:47] now
[1:12:48] listen before you click out there
[1:12:50] somebody listening just remember I do
[1:12:53] know how to
[1:12:55] read the prophet will talk about engaged
[1:12:58] we're only
[1:13:01] engaged and he may use the word that
[1:13:04] we're already married don't we get
[1:13:06] married
[1:13:10] here right
[1:13:14] right and what's he
[1:13:17] saying the same thing I've been trying
[1:13:19] to prove to you that when you're engaged
[1:13:22] you're married right amen
[1:13:27] amen when you engage to Jesus Christ
[1:13:29] you're married to him
[1:13:32] amen when you have a new birth you're
[1:13:34] married to
[1:13:35] Christ Paul is espoused us brother R
[1:13:39] spouses to
[1:13:44] Christ but watch it the words he
[1:13:47] used now the church now is engaged to
[1:13:50] Christ for the wedding the wedding has
[1:13:52] never been performed
[1:13:56] yet it will be at the wedding supper of
[1:13:58] the
[1:14:02] Lamb I see you spiritualize bring that
[1:14:05] all back down here it's okay but just
[1:14:08] remember we're going up there right
[1:14:12] right there is some things to take place
[1:14:16] don't spiritualize it so much until you
[1:14:18] spiritualize everything out of
[1:14:21] existence I've heard people say it ain't
[1:14:23] going to be no future on CU you're
[1:14:25] looking at
[1:14:26] it beating on the
[1:14:32] chest that's preachers in this
[1:14:35] message so just get it right we're
[1:14:38] engaged to Jesus Christ as far as God is
[1:14:41] concerned we are already married to him
[1:14:44] that's right but we are going to a
[1:14:46] wedding supper amen right and then we're
[1:14:49] going to have a
[1:14:51] honeymoon righten listen the wedding has
[1:14:55] never been performed yet it will be at
[1:14:57] the wedding supper of the Lamb do you
[1:14:59] see that the church is now engaged like
[1:15:01] a man engaged to his wife what does he
[1:15:03] do while you they're engaged he's just
[1:15:06] bestoring all kind of gifts all kind of
[1:15:08] things upon her go ahead to the next
[1:15:11] one 6 seal 63 323 paragraph 359 it's a
[1:15:16] time for The Sixth Seal pretty soon to
[1:15:18] be open and when she does oh my the end
[1:15:23] the bride has done gone forth what she's
[1:15:28] done the Queen's done went to take her
[1:15:31] place she's being married now to the
[1:15:35] king see iate that one and you got the
[1:15:37] quote for now but watch it he is being
[1:15:41] married now to the king while this was
[1:15:44] going on what six
[1:15:47] seal we're going to a wedding in the
[1:15:52] sky
[1:15:55] right but we're already married to
[1:16:00] him there just steps to go through the
[1:16:03] climax the thing look at the next
[1:16:06] one the future
[1:16:09] home paragraph 495
[1:16:12] 64802 help us Lord if there's one here
[1:16:15] that's called to this wedding supper of
[1:16:17] the Lamb this thousand years of
[1:16:20] millennial Reign and to then ENT into
[1:16:23] the city after the honeymoon is over the
[1:16:27] Millennium is merely the honeymoon then
[1:16:29] she the bride takes his bridegroom takes
[1:16:32] his bride home it's hers her bridegroom
[1:16:36] his bride oh he's gone to prepare our
[1:16:39] house amen since we've become engaged
[1:16:42] amen so what's the prophet
[1:16:45] saying well end on that
[1:16:50] do we're engaged to it now
[1:16:54] right as far as he's concerned we're
[1:16:56] married as far as we're concerned we're
[1:16:58] married to Christ right the word read
[1:17:01] spoken word Original Seed and you'll see
[1:17:03] what went
[1:17:07] wrong we were married to him already
[1:17:11] amen we haven't been to the wedding
[1:17:13] ceremony yet we haven't been to the
[1:17:15] marriage supper yet we haven't had a
[1:17:17] honeymoon
[1:17:21] yet so it's still right
[1:17:25] right the day you're engaged is the day
[1:17:27] you're married
[1:17:34] right that's the prophet's message in
[1:17:36] the
[1:17:37] Bible and we'll get to the espousal on
[1:17:40] the next on the vows we don't have time
[1:17:44] they sh want to stay till
[1:17:47] 10:30 course all we say you go outside
[1:17:50] we quit 10 at 9 you go outside and stay
[1:17:52] with 10 talking when he day going fool
[1:17:54] you preach to 10 but I won't because the
[1:17:58] mind can only comprehend what the seek
[1:18:00] can
[1:18:00] endure so back on these
[1:18:05] things what constitutes a
[1:18:08] marriage what's the word constitute or
[1:18:11] forms or makes or whatever word you want
[1:18:13] to
[1:18:15] use when are you married to
[1:18:17] Christ by the New
[1:18:21] Birth by your V that you've accepted him
[1:18:24] as your savior and he's accepted you sir
[1:18:29] you marri
[1:18:30] it when the boy asks the girl to marry
[1:18:33] him and she
[1:18:37] accepts we call that an
[1:18:41] engagement but God calls it a
[1:18:46] marriage but the r parts of the marriage
[1:18:48] is not
[1:18:50] complete because in in the spiritual
[1:18:53] there's a wedding supper for us to go
[1:18:57] to and we're going to be getting married
[1:18:59] according to the prophet while the world
[1:19:01] is getting blowed away down here you
[1:19:03] know blowed
[1:19:05] up it's going to be a beautiful
[1:19:11] thing to see our bridegroom
[1:19:17] amen you know
[1:19:21] that how many types do you want or
[1:19:27] thoughts who was it that went down and
[1:19:33] got somebody help
[1:19:36] me said her husband for Isaac
[1:19:40] Rebecca went down she'd never seen him
[1:19:45] right right
[1:19:47] right but he sent a
[1:19:51] DIY
[1:19:53] and she accepted his word
[1:19:56] through who was the
[1:20:00] eler she'd never seen Isaac that's
[1:20:03] right amen but that was her husband
[1:20:06] that's that's
[1:20:07] right when she agreed to
[1:20:11] go that was her accepting his offer amen
[1:20:16] right eler took the offer and presented
[1:20:19] it that's what Paul's talking about he
[1:20:22] presented any Christ to you and
[1:20:25] I and espoused us to
[1:20:28] Christ this prophet's message has
[1:20:31] presented Christ to you and I yes we
[1:20:33] know what our bridegroom looks
[1:20:37] like she knew so much about him till
[1:20:40] when she got close she said is that
[1:20:44] Isaac standing out in the field he said
[1:20:47] yes she just jumped right off that cam
[1:20:50] took off right that through that now
[1:20:53] they never run in the house jumped in
[1:20:55] bed that's what everybody thinks a
[1:20:57] wedding is that consummates a wedding
[1:21:00] that brings it on in to a bedroom a
[1:21:05] fire it was probably no telling how long
[1:21:09] because there were a lot of things that
[1:21:10] had to be going
[1:21:11] through getting her prepared to get
[1:21:16] married and one day her
[1:21:19] and Isaac was
[1:21:21] married
[1:21:25] but to show how p and true it
[1:21:28] was Isaac never took her to the new
[1:21:33] home he took her to his father's
[1:21:36] house is that
[1:21:41] Bible then went to her his
[1:21:46] house you see brother R says in John
[1:21:49] what is it in my house are many mansions
[1:21:52] it would not so I would have told you
[1:21:53] but R said that's so theop in other
[1:21:56] words that's
[1:21:57] right he said but that's not the future
[1:22:01] home he said when I go to prepare a
[1:22:03] place for you he said he up there right
[1:22:05] now making us a future
[1:22:08] home you were in the father's
[1:22:12] house
[1:22:15] right where Isaac and Rebecca went to to
[1:22:19] get
[1:22:20] married we're here being married to
[1:22:22] Christ yes cuz he's my
[1:22:29] husband but there's many more things to
[1:22:32] take
[1:22:33] place stand many more things that take
[1:22:36] place we'll get into the vows and the
[1:22:38] things next Wednesday and cover
[1:22:43] those if you want to read
[1:22:45] Deuteronomy 22 read Deuteronomy
[1:22:49] 22 and study it
[1:22:54] then we'll cover the vows and the things
[1:22:58] to show what a wedding really
[1:23:01] is and how strong it is meant to
[1:23:04] be if we violate that we're to be
[1:23:10] killed don't go around boys and girls
[1:23:12] asking girls to marry you you don't mean
[1:23:15] it that's cheap talk I I heard one guy
[1:23:18] say one night said that him and a girl
[1:23:21] was out together
[1:23:23] said she said well I only do that if if
[1:23:25] you ask me to marry you he said well
[1:23:26] I'll ask you to marry you right now but
[1:23:28] he didn't mean anything by
[1:23:32] it cheap
[1:23:35] talk but
