[16:18] beginning was the word
[16:20] where it was with god and the word was
[16:22] god
[16:22] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[16:24] among us and we beheld his glory the
[16:26] glory of the only begotten of the father
[16:28] full of grace
[16:30] and truth you may be seen in the lord as
[16:31] blessing to the reading of the word
[16:32] we'll read romans 8
[16:35] but remember the word was made flesh and
[16:37] dwelt among us 2 000 years ago now
[16:39] the word has made flesh
[16:46] hey lois
[16:50] i was praying you'd be here today
[16:52] so
[16:53] god bless you good to have you with us
[16:56] i'm not gonna ask you where your
[16:57] brother's at

[17:05] sister lois and uh
[17:07] and brother lauren
[17:09] uh
[17:10] come to me i love that mom and dad
[17:12] the mom is the one that that made all
[17:14] these those of you that have these own
[17:15] that says
[17:16] buy his stripes i am healed i shall not
[17:18] die
[17:20] but live and declare the words when i
[17:21] have a bad day i look at that well there
[17:23] is lauren
[17:26] rachel is not that funny sister
[17:29] she about dropped her head off backwards
[17:31] laughing i'm getting old okay no i'm not
[17:33] getting old i am there good to see you
[17:35] man
[17:36] i pray for both of you to be here today
[17:38] so we we're going to pray you're here
[17:40] how many of us are going to pray that
[17:41] they get here every single okay
[17:42] hallelujah thank you see you there
[17:45] and you got on a certain time
[17:47] wow dude
[17:51] miracles happen
[17:53] for our reckons that the suffering of
[17:55] this present time are not worthy to be
[17:56] compared with the glory we shall be
[17:58] revealed enough so it really doesn't
[17:59] matter what we go through
[18:01] trials and tribulations we're going to
[18:03] have them
[18:04] they're going to be there like i said
[18:06] before when you become a christian your
[18:08] grass doesn't quit growing your bills
[18:10] doesn't quit coming into the mailbox i
[18:12] know because i deliver them
[18:16] yep
[18:17] y'alls especially
[18:20] but
[18:20] all that doesn't stop it's not that you
[18:22] live in this flowery bed of ease but
[18:24] what you have you have a typos
[18:26] you have a spiritual rudder that when
[18:28] that boat when that wind starts blowing
[18:30] that rudder turns and you know you can
[18:32] turn yourself into the wind and you can
[18:34] make it through problems will not go
[18:36] away but how to handle them is what god
[18:38] is wanting to give you he gives you a
[18:40] way to handle your problems and your
[18:41] issues everyday life by the baptism of
[18:44] holy ghost that's why brother brown said
[18:46] the holy ghost receiving the baptism of
[18:47] the holy ghost is the most important
[18:49] thing in your life
[18:50] and that's what we're talking about now
[18:51] let there's not a
[18:53] there's a teaching in the message that
[18:54] you got to go all the way up here before
[18:55] you get the holy ghost well i you can't
[18:57] get you cannot get the character of god
[19:00] without having part of the character of
[19:01] god in you already
[19:03] that's just to me that's just i don't
[19:05] say the word stupid anymore
[19:07] that did
[19:08] so it was stupid it really is i mean you
[19:10] look and you go how in the world if the
[19:12] bible tells us that then i'll read it in
[19:14] a minute where the bible says we can't
[19:16] even call jesus to christ we can't even
[19:18] call his name
[19:20] without the holy ghost because you just
[19:22] jesus listen jesus christ without the
[19:23] new birth is just like
[19:26] robert doherty
[19:28] it has no meaning behind it
[19:31] i don't say you know what you know what
[19:32] i mean
[19:34] thank you brother
[19:35] that's
[19:36] maturity a young kid would be going what
[19:39] you mean ain't nothing
[19:41] but you understand what i'm saying
[19:44] you got the baptism of the holy ghost
[19:46] that puts you in christ and that puts
[19:48] his nature inside of you so so now you
[19:50] have the ability to live the life
[19:53] that jesus christ lived aren't we in the
[19:56] aren't we in the dispensation of the son
[19:57] of man
[19:59] amen we're in the dispensation of the
[20:00] son of man and like i said before
[20:03] we can't go back and get more
[20:08] one more time
[20:09] we can't be in the son of man revelation
[20:12] and say well that's not for me and then
[20:13] you drop back to the son of god
[20:15] revelation which is the church ages
[20:17] which is the new birth which is somewhat
[20:20] of growth development but not full
[20:21] maturity
[20:23] all right so you can't go then all the
[20:25] way back here
[20:27] once you've got here
[20:31] because you're moving backwards
[20:33] you got to move forward
[20:34] and listen there's a way to do it
[20:38] there's a way to get to that next step
[20:40] there's a way to get to that that using
[20:42] that gps gps god's positioning system or
[20:45] god's predestinated seed you can get
[20:48] that gps and that gps is going to take
[20:50] you to the headstone because that's the
[20:53] requirement of this day
[20:56] not a requirement of just saying god
[20:58] sent a prophet and we're good and we're
[20:59] okay and and we just we're gonna fill
[21:01] the church up with people and and we're
[21:03] just gonna all you know be okay we'll
[21:05] have birthday parties and and we'll do
[21:07] this and we'll take a minute once a
[21:08] month and no
[21:10] that's not what god wants
[21:12] god wants you to be a moving living
[21:14] breathing instrumentality of itself
[21:17] that only the world will see god through
[21:20] you there is no way they're going to see
[21:21] god
[21:22] and how they're going to see god through
[21:24] you if you don't have god in you
[21:26] like i said how you go you got you don't
[21:29] have a clue what virtue knowledge
[21:30] temperature and godless brother kindness
[21:32] is without the basis or foundation of
[21:35] having the new birth
[21:38] because remember
[21:40] jesus himself
[21:43] was god almighty in human flesh
[21:45] but he learned by the things he suffered
[21:47] when he got into that flesh
[21:49] right but remember he was a son already
[21:54] hello
[21:54] he was a son already
[21:56] then he grew
[21:58] he only did that what the father shall
[22:00] well what the father show him virtue
[22:02] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[22:04] and brethren kindness
[22:05] that's what god showed him
[22:08] in his life
[22:09] i only do that what the father boy
[22:11] that'd be a good idea wouldn't it
[22:13] if you could do only what god tells you
[22:15] to do
[22:17] sometimes we fight for days to do what
[22:20] he to not do what he said
[22:22] i said to not do what he said
[22:25] amen sometimes we fight our
[22:28] we fight our way and stuff where you're
[22:30] supposed to just be going okay god
[22:32] i'll do it don't worry but you know what
[22:34] we're hard-headed
[22:36] so romans 8 verse 8 well maybe not y'all
[22:38] are not but i am just pray for me for i
[22:41] reckon that the sufferings of this
[22:42] present time the sufferings
[22:44] of this present time are not worthy to
[22:46] be compared with the glory which shall
[22:47] be revealed in us
[22:49] for the earnest expectation of the
[22:51] creation or the whole creation
[22:53] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[22:55] of god listen it's good
[22:58] it's good to preach that you need the
[23:00] holy ghost it's good to preach that you
[23:02] get all these virtues and god's working
[23:04] like peter and and and paul and the
[23:06] people get healed in your shadow
[23:10] amen
[23:12] but unless you manifest this part yes
[23:18] that's not the call of this age the call
[23:20] they say is to manifest
[23:22] jesus christ himself
[23:25] in your human flesh
[23:27] that's the mandate that we have to live
[23:30] under
[23:31] you say well that's really hard listen
[23:34] i'm telling you one more time you say
[23:36] you read the bible or you read the
[23:37] prophet's message and you said you say
[23:39] well i just said that a different way
[23:40] because that's kind of hard to
[23:41] understand now why are you trying to
[23:43] change god's mind
[23:44] god saw somebody get this
[23:48] god saw somebody get something out of
[23:50] those 1100 sermons and that's the way he
[23:52] said it
[23:53] he don't have to say it 10 different
[23:55] ways he says it one way
[23:58] i'm like brother brown and brother brown
[23:59] said if i was god i'd just say forget it
[24:02] but no he's long suffering
[24:04] he wrote the bible
[24:06] he gave us 1100 sermons
[24:08] and he gave us the holy ghost which is
[24:09] the man that wrote the sermons and the
[24:11] man that wrote the bible he's inside of
[24:13] you today so he gives that to you but
[24:16] what do we do we clamp down on it
[24:19] remember read the conservation
[24:20] imagination that's our problem that's
[24:22] where the clamp is everybody with me
[24:24] all right
[24:25] so we're waiting for the manifestation
[24:27] of the sons of god
[24:30] let's look at number one where
[24:33] brother ryan says teaching places a man
[24:34] positionally what he is and we can never
[24:36] rightly have
[24:37] be able to have faith
[24:39] faith now that's not faith
[24:42] at the new birth
[24:43] that's faith to continue on because
[24:48] what now look i don't want to say only
[24:49] but the only thing the new birth does is
[24:51] it puts you in the body
[24:54] then you have to know find your position
[24:58] all right i'm in the body now let me
[25:00] find my position listen the day i got
[25:02] born again god didn't say you're going
[25:03] to be a preacher and you're going to do
[25:05] this and you no
[25:07] he lets you go and figure things out
[25:10] he lets you go and deal with things he
[25:12] lets you have trials and tribulations
[25:14] and troubles and move from church to
[25:15] church and somebody hurts your feelings
[25:17] and somebody did this and somebody did
[25:18] that and you found this and you quit
[25:20] that and you
[25:22] see what i'm talking about
[25:24] but positionally faith to be
[25:26] positionally placed has to come by
[25:28] teaching somebody must teach us
[25:31] how to get to these things
[25:33] because listen we were born confused
[25:37] we are confused until the new birth and
[25:39] that doesn't do away with the confusion
[25:42] amen
[25:45] and you say i'm sick rebecca's laughing
[25:46] but you do that i mean but you then you
[25:49] say well well then i can't make it no
[25:51] keep moving
[25:53] keep moving
[25:54] you got a position to get to
[25:58] i like i like what brother chad lamb
[26:00] said i was watching him the other day
[26:02] and
[26:03] he said look you can't if you get the
[26:05] new birth you can't sin enough to be
[26:07] lost
[26:09] but you still got once you go up a
[26:10] statue of perfect man you're gonna have
[26:12] problems but you'll never lose that
[26:15] foundation
[26:16] [Music]
[26:18] that's where you got to start
[26:20] jerubable lay the foundation and then
[26:23] build the building
[26:25] lay the foundation and then build the
[26:27] building
[26:28] lay the foundation god and then as you
[26:31] go up the statue of perfect man if you
[26:33] see that where's boyd
[26:35] where i thought she was up here
[26:38] oh
[26:39] oh there must be some ghost sitting up
[26:40] here
[26:41] god bless you brother
[26:44] he had a temper
[26:46] are you okay
[26:48] we're good he had a temper
[26:50] i saw it a couple times but that's okay
[26:52] he saw stuff in me but i'm talking about
[26:54] he have to he don't have that temper
[26:55] anymore
[26:57] right
[26:58] the lord
[27:00] i know now look that proves two things
[27:04] number one
[27:05] he's a child of god
[27:07] because the devil would never take away
[27:10] that
[27:12] he loves temper
[27:13] he loves to get you confused he loves to
[27:17] stir you up even in your new birth he
[27:19] still likes to stir you up
[27:22] hey man
[27:23] like when y'all start falling asleep
[27:24] that stirs me up nope just kidding
[27:27] you're not yeah i'm awake i'm awake i'm
[27:29] awake
[27:33] we do it jericho march but we can't get
[27:35] past the wall over there it'd be enough
[27:38] it'd be like this and everybody fall
[27:39] over each other especially older ones
[27:42] they'd fall over each other
[27:44] but brother boyd had a problem he knew
[27:46] that i know what problems i have
[27:50] i'm going this way
[27:51] i know what problems i have
[27:55] it's not my business what problems he
[27:56] has
[27:57] i tr we try to help because being a
[27:59] minister you try to help you you see
[28:01] things and then you through the holy
[28:02] ghost you try to help
[28:04] but he's got to work it out himself
[28:06] but now when you see it's gone
[28:09] when you see it's gone
[28:11] every one of you you say well i've never
[28:13] had a temper they some of it people
[28:14] never really never had a temper
[28:17] sister clay did you ever have a temper
[28:20] well let me ask tony tony did your mom
[28:22] ever have a temper
[28:25] he's smiling
[28:29] that's that's sometimes tough
[28:36] but not like you used to be
[28:40] boy it still tries to raise up some time
[28:41] doesn't it
[28:43] because that's your memory reason
[28:44] conscious affectionate imagination
[28:47] that's not your new birth
[28:49] what proves in your birth is that things
[28:50] gone like it was
[28:52] amen
[28:53] okay then hold on to that yes
[28:57] don't don't go through life and say well
[28:58] i don't know if i'm born again or not
[29:01] confess you are even though maybe you're
[29:03] not
[29:04] confession god goes by your confession
[29:09] confess these things
[29:18] but you used to not
[29:21] turn over desk he told me one time
[29:24] in a in a plant that's pretty tough to
[29:26] turn a big old desk over
[29:29] but you don't do that no more
[29:32] you know what he'd do he'll pray for the
[29:33] people that he was mad at
[29:38] instead of wanting to curse him
[29:40] you're praying for him
[29:42] that's the difference to me that shows
[29:43] you there's growth
[29:45] that shows me that god has given you a
[29:47] foundation
[29:48] called a new birth
[29:50] and then now he's what
[29:53] he's chopping
[29:54] he's chopping big chunks at one time
[29:56] sometimes big chunks hurts bad
[30:00] but then now you got to get to a time to
[30:02] where brother brown talks about the
[30:03] masterpiece where you get to a time
[30:04] where you're not knocking places pieces
[30:07] off this big you knock them off this big
[30:09] then you get to the finished product and
[30:10] all you're doing is sanding
[30:14] you're getting the detail
[30:15] i believe now a lot of people are
[30:17] getting the detail
[30:19] a lot of people are still like me just a
[30:21] big old chunk
[30:22] i'm trying i'm on the keto diet so i'm
[30:24] not going to be thank christian
[30:27] wherever he's at
[30:29] he said i filled up the whole
[30:32] screen
[30:37] patience
[30:38] virtue
[30:40] um
[30:42] a lot of temperance
[30:44] and the knowledge that he ain't got no
[30:45] sense
[30:49] but look
[30:51] i'm trying to make it so simple
[30:54] because we make it so hard
[30:57] to be perfect
[31:00] according to like i said this morning
[31:02] the way we see perfect
[31:04] perfect is you get up every morning and
[31:06] your teeth already brushed
[31:09] your clothes are already ironed
[31:12] get out of that fantasy
[31:14] but that's what we think as human beings
[31:16] and then i'm not gonna ever have a wreck
[31:18] in a car if i get bored again
[31:21] i'm not gonna with brother gary i'm not
[31:22] gonna hit my finger with a hammer even
[31:24] if you use a hammer anymore
[31:26] use a nail gun shoot em through your
[31:27] fingers like i did
[31:31] that's our thinking
[31:33] but thank god for a prophet thank god
[31:35] for a prophet that told us
[31:37] cloudy days
[31:39] are not a sign
[31:41] that you're having a bad day
[31:42] and that god don't like you that's right
[31:44] but he says sunny beautiful days when
[31:46] you walk outside and say man this great
[31:48] day to be a christian guess what the
[31:49] devil's in the bushes
[31:52] he's going as soon as he walks out to
[31:53] that car i'm gonna make sure it don't
[31:55] crank
[31:58] that ever happened to anybody
[32:00] sure it has
[32:03] that's our mentality though
[32:05] so let's keep reading hebrews 6 1.
[32:09] therefore leaving the principles of the
[32:10] doctrine of christ let us go on into
[32:12] what perfection not laying again the
[32:14] foundation of repentance
[32:19] excuse me from dead works and of faith
[32:21] toward god
[32:22] of the doctrine of baptism a laying on
[32:24] of hands and the resurrection of the
[32:25] dead of eternal judgment
[32:27] this will we do if god permit now listen
[32:30] god didn't permit certain people in
[32:33] certain ages to go so far because they
[32:34] didn't have the word to do it with
[32:36] you and i don't have that excuse
[32:39] all forward
[32:41] full all the way up to the capstone we
[32:42] we there's a way to get there
[32:45] like i said before why try to change
[32:46] god's word why try to change the prophet
[32:49] of god's word to fit our
[32:53] slowness
[32:54] or our excuses
[32:58] we got to conform to him he's the potter
[33:00] with the clay
[33:01] all right he's the one we got to listen
[33:03] to not what we think supposed to be we
[33:05] listen to what he says in the word of
[33:07] god and it does not change
[33:09] for me or you either one
[33:12] let's go into perfection not laying
[33:14] again the foundation of repentance now
[33:16] look not laying again the when we start
[33:18] the new birth you say well brother wait
[33:20] you don't have to repent yeah you repent
[33:22] every day but you don't have to repent
[33:23] like you did before
[33:26] we'll talk about that go ahead and pull
[33:27] the uh
[33:29] pull the new chart and chart number two
[33:31] up and we'll look at that just for a
[33:33] minute
[33:35] which will be the coming to the new
[33:36] birth all right but you got to come to
[33:39] perfection and remember i'll read this
[33:40] while they're pulling that up
[33:42] the greek lexicon said this means a full
[33:44] age brought to its end i like that
[33:46] finished
[33:47] wanting nothing necessary to
[33:49] completeness
[33:50] nothing perfect that which is perfect
[33:53] consummate human
[33:55] integrity and virtue of men full grown
[33:58] adult of full age mature now look
[34:01] that's not this picture
[34:07] that's your foundation
[34:10] you're not as complete as you're going
[34:12] to be right here
[34:14] in your soul you are
[34:17] but remember that soul is always moving
[34:20] that soul is always doing something it's
[34:23] really a paradox that when you're laying
[34:25] asleep at night and you're having an
[34:27] awful dream there's a holy ghost inside
[34:30] of you that's not having that dream
[34:34] when you have that nasty thought in your
[34:36] mind y'all never had those before
[34:39] i have
[34:43] the holy ghost didn't do that
[34:45] when you have a dream you're like where
[34:46] did that come from
[34:48] that was from your memory reason
[34:50] conscious affection imagination that is
[34:52] not from your soul that is satan
[34:54] bombarding you from this angle
[34:57] not coming from the inside this way
[35:00] amen but now remember god does use
[35:02] dreams now what does god use dreams with
[35:04] the holy ghost is inside of you to tell
[35:06] you a dream or to give you a prophecy or
[35:08] to prophesy to someone that comes from
[35:10] the new birth
[35:12] but you have to really be careful
[35:13] because remember brother brown met those
[35:15] two guys one of them had a new birth one
[35:16] of them didn't living with another woman
[35:18] and he was interpreting tongues that's
[35:20] why we read that this morning
[35:22] everybody puts emphasis on speaking in
[35:24] tongues paul said i'd rather say five
[35:26] words
[35:29] with wisdom
[35:31] than to speak ten thousand words in
[35:33] another tongue
[35:35] ten thousand
[35:37] y'all couldn't know well maybe you could
[35:39] you could all if we all start speaking
[35:40] in tongues it might be ten thousand
[35:41] words in an hour
[35:44] but five words is what he said
[35:46] five words give me five words that's
[35:48] full of grace
[35:49] give me five words that's full of the
[35:51] holy ghost give me five words that will
[35:53] help me up the statue of perfect man
[35:56] rather than all that speaking in tongues
[35:58] i'm just telling you what paul said
[36:00] all right
[36:02] we take some of these gifts and we think
[36:03] man i wish i had them i wish we did have
[36:05] the gifts because the gift keeps us
[36:07] clean
[36:08] and we do but now listen you say well
[36:10] well there there's nine of them and we
[36:12] pick two
[36:13] the two bottom ones
[36:15] speaking in tongues and interpretation
[36:17] there's wisdom there's faith
[36:19] knowledge
[36:20] all those different gifts that god's
[36:22] given listen those are gifts that god
[36:23] give us
[36:25] a full age brought to its end and
[36:27] finished wanting nothing necessary to
[36:29] completeness
[36:32] human integrity and virtue full grown
[36:34] adult full age mature
[36:37] let's look at the next one is a finisher
[36:40] a perfector
[36:42] one who has in his own person
[36:44] raised faith amen
[36:47] now listen
[36:49] where'd y'all tell me to stand
[36:51] sorry
[36:52] this is perfect faith
[36:56] in a minute in a minute um portion
[37:00] everybody with me
[37:02] because there's not an imperfect faith
[37:04] in god
[37:05] because when you receive perfect faith
[37:07] that's the new birth because brother
[37:08] brown said who are these people said
[37:10] they're your converts he said what are
[37:12] they doing here he said they all have
[37:13] faith perfect faith
[37:15] everybody won't know what perfect faith
[37:16] is perfect facing new birth
[37:19] but perfect faith is not all you need
[37:20] because it keeps telling you to keep
[37:22] going up
[37:24] it says look the one who has in his own
[37:26] person raised faith to its perfection
[37:30] and so set before us the highest example
[37:33] of faith
[37:34] listen jesus had the highest example of
[37:37] faith because he was faith
[37:40] but he still had to die
[37:42] he still had to go through trials
[37:43] they hated him amen they hated him and
[37:46] called him the king of devils
[37:50] they didn't call him the messiah only a
[37:52] few very few people called him who he
[37:55] really was and they didn't know who he
[37:56] was
[37:59] flesh and blood does not reveal this to
[38:01] you but my father which is in heaven in
[38:02] other words god put the words in peter's
[38:04] mouth
[38:06] god put the words in peter's mouth
[38:08] because it wasn't a revelation because
[38:09] listen if it was a revelation to peter
[38:11] he'd have had to have the new birth and
[38:13] he wouldn't have run all over the place
[38:15] and cut cut ears off and cursed god
[38:18] three times and run away from him and he
[38:20] went fishing
[38:22] right yeah i go fishing whoever that was
[38:25] preaching the other day you know you see
[38:27] somebody raised from the dead would you
[38:28] go fishing
[38:31] would you
[38:32] no i'd follow that person because he got
[38:35] something i ain't got
[38:37] i would say i go fishing you know what
[38:38] they didn't have a true revelation but i
[38:40] believe when the day of pentecost come
[38:42] peter was the spokesman but i believe
[38:45] peter inside his psyche inside his brain
[38:48] he's like you idiot
[38:50] yeah
[38:52] there's what's supposed to be bringing
[38:54] you life
[38:55] and you messed it up he called you satan
[39:00] right
[39:02] get behind me satan
[39:03] that wasn't peter he's talking about he
[39:05] was talking about what's inside of peter
[39:07] because the new birth wasn't inside of
[39:08] peter
[39:10] right
[39:12] they were under the old testament
[39:14] paradise paradise taught type
[39:16] if they died they went into paradise
[39:18] they didn't have the new birth
[39:20] we had an anointing
[39:22] we had an anointing go preach the gospel
[39:24] but when the day of pentecost come
[39:26] peter said this is that
[39:30] he goes back into scripture and he
[39:31] brings it all the way down and he said
[39:33] man y'all killed this man
[39:35] y'all killed the messiah
[39:38] and what peter do he goes out
[39:40] and he preaches and he gives his life
[39:43] for the gospel
[39:48] we need to lay our life down
[39:50] for this gospel
[39:53] this holy ghost
[39:54] gospel the only way that people are
[39:57] going to get us to me and you
[39:59] so let's go to first corinthians 14.
[40:04] the next one just leave that up there
[40:05] because we're going to start that in
[40:06] just a second i'm going to skip over a
[40:08] couple of these things
[40:10] be not children
[40:12] brethren yeah in the church i'd rather
[40:13] speak five words with my understanding
[40:15] that by my voice i might teach others
[40:17] also than ten thousand words in an
[40:19] unknown tongue brethren be not children
[40:22] in
[40:23] how being in malice
[40:25] be your children in other words
[40:28] playful
[40:29] malicious
[40:30] mean do that you're a child you're gonna
[40:32] do that but i want you to be a man
[40:37] but in understanding be men
[40:40] and the law it's written with men of
[40:41] other tongues and other lips will i
[40:43] speak to these people he's talking about
[40:44] the bible yet for all that will not hear
[40:46] me saith the lord they're not going to
[40:47] wherefore tongues are for a sign
[40:50] not to them that believe but to them
[40:52] that believe not
[40:54] wow how about that
[40:56] everybody wants speaking in tongues
[40:57] that's to the unbeliever
[41:00] i'm reading the bible
[41:02] everybody believes the bible
[41:04] all right right group
[41:06] but to them that believe not but
[41:08] prophesying service not for them that
[41:10] believeth not but for them which believe
[41:13] we're all believers right
[41:16] then brother brown continues on he's
[41:18] talking about revelation of jesus christ
[41:19] he said i mentioned that it takes the
[41:20] holy spirit to give us revelation or we
[41:23] will fail to get it
[41:24] bringing these two thoughts together you
[41:26] will see that it won't take just
[41:27] ordinary study
[41:29] everybody with me
[41:31] ordinaries not it will not take ordinary
[41:33] study
[41:36] that's our problem
[41:41] we study the ordinary
[41:44] say the prayer
[41:45] do the hail mary's
[41:50] preachers save my kids
[41:54] i can't do it with them you help you no
[41:56] daddy said you have them you raise them
[41:58] we'll help you all we can but it starts
[42:01] at home
[42:02] parental delinquency the prophet of god
[42:04] said everybody believe brother brown was
[42:05] the prophet then he said it was parental
[42:08] delinquency okay all righty let's don't
[42:11] blame our kids a lot let's blame
[42:12] ourselves
[42:14] i don't know where that was but that was
[42:15] a freebie
[42:17] bringing these two thoughts together you
[42:18] will see that it won't take just
[42:20] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[42:22] book real
[42:23] now who wants the bible to be real i do
[42:25] i want it to be real and the only way
[42:26] it's going to be real it's not going to
[42:28] be these pain it's not going to be these
[42:29] words are going to start doing this
[42:32] no the words are going to go into you
[42:33] and then you're going to start making it
[42:35] do this amen you're going to start
[42:36] moving
[42:38] it will take one
[42:39] i'm sorry
[42:41] it is going to take the operation of the
[42:43] holy ghost
[42:45] all right if it's going to take the
[42:46] operation of the holy ghost how in the
[42:48] heavenly days are you going to have
[42:49] these operate and work if you don't have
[42:52] the holy ghost
[42:54] we'll get to that where the placing of
[42:56] that is we understand that but we got to
[42:58] get to a point here just a second
[43:01] it will take a special
[43:03] class of people
[43:07] it can't be revealed to anyone but a
[43:10] special class of people
[43:13] it will take one with prophetic insight
[43:16] it will require the ability to hear from
[43:18] god
[43:20] it will require supernatural instruction
[43:24] not just a student companion verse with
[43:27] verse that's right
[43:29] though that is good
[43:31] but a mystery requires the teaching of
[43:33] the spirit or it never becomes clear
[43:38] that's why
[43:39] teaching places you in the body you
[43:41] don't have to be taught to be born again
[43:47] you have to be taught to grow
[43:50] you have to be taught to be positionally
[43:52] placed
[43:53] that's why you must play all you want to
[43:55] and i do not care who hears this you can
[43:56] play past plus press i can't even say it
[43:59] you can press play all you want to
[44:01] you might get the new birth
[44:03] but you will not come to adoption by
[44:06] listening to tapes only
[44:08] never will boy i thought you got mad at
[44:09] me left
[44:11] you're good
[44:12] you're good okay all right he's okay now
[44:13] he went and prayed got it over with
[44:18] you couldn't say that to you you know
[44:19] that don't
[44:20] you you just couldn't do that
[44:24] we've all come a long way but i've seen
[44:26] brother boyd come a long way too
[44:28] a mystery requires the teaching of the
[44:29] spirit or it never becomes clear
[44:32] that's why you can preach a good
[44:33] sugar-tipped sermon and everybody says
[44:35] glory hallelujah that was wonderful
[44:37] well what'd he say i don't know
[44:39] sounded good
[44:41] i got this feeling
[44:45] like daddy always said you want a
[44:46] feeling i'll get you some ice cubes and
[44:47] put them down your back i'll guarantee
[44:49] you'll shout your way all the way down
[44:50] that hall
[44:51] all right trying to get that out of you
[44:54] out of your shirt
[44:57] but five words
[44:59] sit down and hear five words
[45:01] of good
[45:02] teaching then all that shouting and
[45:05] running and all that other stuff that
[45:06] they do that's okay as you can do that
[45:09] let me tell you something
[45:12] there was one time a man called david
[45:15] that he was the apple of god's eye
[45:18] he danced until he showed his underwear
[45:21] under parts right
[45:23] remember his wife said shame on you you
[45:25] went out there and everybody in the
[45:27] whole
[45:28] the whole kingdom
[45:30] saw everything about you
[45:32] you know what david say
[45:34] i'm sorry
[45:36] what didn't mean to do that
[45:38] no he said if you hang around a little
[45:39] bit longer woman
[45:42] you hang around a little bit once and
[45:44] i'm going to show a lot more because
[45:45] that was god amen that i was dancing too
[45:48] that was god that was showing me what
[45:50] was going on because here come the ark
[45:53] here comes the word of god to go back in
[45:55] this place listen once you see the word
[45:57] of god come in this place it'll make you
[45:59] happy it'll make you say hey
[46:01] that's me
[46:07] we can handle it folks the pressure
[46:10] the pressure of this age the pressure of
[46:11] what we need to listen to and learn and
[46:14] it's
[46:15] the pressure
[46:17] but brother brown said we were built
[46:20] to handle
[46:21] the pressure
[46:24] you know why we're built to handle the
[46:25] pressure god saw we'd be built to handle
[46:28] the pressure
[46:30] god thought we'd be eagles he knew we
[46:32] would fly oh that's brother branham no
[46:34] wait a minute hold on just a minute
[46:36] the line ox man and eagle was not
[46:37] william branham
[46:39] he had an eagle
[46:40] anointing right be it prophetic but he
[46:43] told us i just read you we're prophetic
[46:45] people ourself
[46:47] but we can't go as high as a prophet
[46:49] i well guess what
[46:51] he preached us to a place he said that
[46:54] rapturing faith lays in these tapes and
[46:56] books
[46:58] amen
[46:59] and what it takes is is mother eagle to
[47:01] pull those big nuggets out those big
[47:03] pieces of meat
[47:05] chews them up into little pieces of meat
[47:07] and i wish we could shove it down your
[47:09] throat
[47:13] but we can't we have to just drop it in
[47:15] there every once in a while because we
[47:16] don't want to choke you
[47:17] but you know what once that happens
[47:19] though and you get big enough
[47:22] you get your own wings you always had
[47:24] them
[47:26] you had them at the birth
[47:29] i just thought of that
[47:31] you had it at the birth you had the two
[47:32] wings at the birth
[47:34] you didn't know how to use them
[47:36] but
[47:37] mama eagle kept feeding you
[47:40] apostles prophets
[47:42] pastor teacher evangelist bible study
[47:46] sunday school
[47:48] preachers coming in talking about the
[47:50] word of god
[47:51] and guess what all of a sudden
[47:53] you go
[47:54] hmm
[47:56] that's a rabbit
[48:00] and all you see is is a piece of steak
[48:05] and then what do you do
[48:06] you go get it
[48:08] then you can eat it yourself
[48:11] not doing away with the file foam
[48:12] ministry but there's a time coming to
[48:14] where you're going to have to get this
[48:15] stuff whether we're around you or not
[48:18] you got to come to maturity i like what
[48:20] brother dale said about brother cauley a
[48:21] long time ago what'd he say brother
[48:23] james
[48:24] he said i want to get packed in you
[48:26] enough
[48:27] to where if something happens to me
[48:30] you'll have enough to make it
[48:32] that's what i want pack it in enough get
[48:35] that in the storehouse she's oh no
[48:37] that's a building nice you yeah
[48:39] the storehouse is you
[48:41] store the food up and guess what lock
[48:43] the door
[48:46] lock the door because the devil sure
[48:48] wants to steal that away from you
[48:51] that's his job
[48:53] but he's not greater than the one inside
[48:55] of us
[48:58] they ought to write a song about that
[48:59] greater is he that's in you than he is
[49:00] in the world
[49:03] a mystery requires the teaching of the
[49:05] spirit or it never
[49:06] becomes
[49:08] clear
[49:09] then we read where there's a mystery and
[49:10] a supernatural element still remains
[49:12] despite the revelation you know you get
[49:14] a revelation of of one true and living
[49:16] god leave that alone
[49:18] you get a revelation of one true living
[49:19] god right
[49:21] but is that it
[49:24] is that it you just say oh well you know
[49:25] what the bible says the devil believes
[49:27] in one god and trembles
[49:30] so you got to go on you got to get a
[49:32] supernatural element of that
[49:34] that it's inside of you
[49:36] it's in you
[49:38] it's not in the devil or he'd be your
[49:40] brother
[49:42] that's what he can't understand about me
[49:44] and you
[49:45] he can't understand why boy did he take
[49:47] the same devil
[49:48] send that same
[49:50] um
[49:53] horrible
[49:54] attitude demon
[49:56] and still going
[49:58] let me back in
[50:03] can't get in
[50:05] sealed out
[50:07] cause god is sealed in
[50:10] at me by again
[50:12] seven devils worse than the ones that
[50:14] came the fir got
[50:16] thrown out the first time
[50:18] can't get back in
[50:20] can't get back in because you're sealed
[50:23] but do we stop there nope
[50:27] we're going to get to the place
[50:30] to where this world as brother brown
[50:32] said he said
[50:33] he said death will come up your arm and
[50:35] you'll just wipe it off like dust
[50:41] that's real scary
[50:44] you know why it's scary because satan
[50:45] made it scary
[50:47] god didn't make death scary
[50:50] no
[50:51] satan made this scary
[50:54] and that little brother brown said that
[50:55] one little
[50:56] little sting that little little twang of
[50:58] death
[51:00] but when god sent him over to the other
[51:02] side what'd he say
[51:03] he said that's gone
[51:05] why do we fear death if that's what he's
[51:07] going to send me to
[51:09] even if we have to go by the grave even
[51:10] if we have to go over to the other side
[51:12] the sixth dimension so what
[51:15] somebody
[51:16] better bring me back
[51:18] i'm not staying over there but god's to
[51:21] put somebody in this dimension
[51:23] that's going to bring all that back
[51:26] a supernatural group of people a
[51:27] supernatural element still remains
[51:29] despite the revelation so we get the
[51:31] revelation
[51:32] of of serpent seed
[51:34] sex in the garden oh boy that's it let's
[51:37] just go home
[51:39] that just starts it that tells me that i
[51:41] was the one
[51:43] that caused all that
[51:45] my mama was eve
[51:49] boy it gets quiet
[51:51] because y'all know i'm feeling talk
[51:52] about marriage and divorce
[51:54] i know you all everybody swiveling up
[51:56] got the head down
[52:02] brother brown said you were born between
[52:04] satan and eve
[52:06] all right amen
[52:11] hello that's exactly what he said
[52:13] you were born between satan and eve you
[52:15] were born dead amen no life in you at
[52:19] all you had predestination
[52:22] you had the foreknowledge of god that
[52:24] knew you'd come to it but you weren't
[52:26] sitting there with it
[52:27] i'm going to tell you one more time the
[52:29] things i did when i was in the world god
[52:31] was nowhere to be seen inside of me
[52:34] like i said this morning i didn't care
[52:37] i'm sorry
[52:38] and until you're born again you're the
[52:39] same way
[52:41] you just go do your own thing
[52:43] but when god by foreknowledge knew that
[52:45] you would come to a point where you
[52:46] would just hate it
[52:48] i don't want this no more
[52:51] i don't want this no more
[52:54] and what does god do he tugs
[52:56] that little tug
[52:59] what's he tugging you those who he's
[53:00] justified he's already glorified
[53:03] because if you accept that tug
[53:07] and it's the right one
[53:10] it's going to take you to the headstone
[53:13] those who he's justified
[53:16] he is already
[53:19] glorified
[53:22] but there's a journey
[53:25] in his mind it's already finished but on
[53:27] this earth we have to go through it
[53:29] that's why the statue of perfect man is
[53:31] so important because i believe people a
[53:33] lot of people in the message
[53:36] they preach this
[53:38] and then like i've always said right
[53:40] here there's a red letter day on the
[53:42] calendar
[53:43] and god's got an x you know how if you
[53:44] got something important on the calendar
[53:46] you
[53:47] or you got those people that are in
[53:49] prison and they got the calendars or you
[53:50] see on the wall
[53:52] where they keep exiting the days off
[53:53] until they get out of prison they know
[53:55] exactly what day now listen god knows
[53:57] exactly what day but it's not because
[53:59] what he chose
[54:02] he saw someone come to maturity
[54:06] come to maturity enough to stand and say
[54:11] death
[54:12] you have no hold on me
[54:14] death you have no hold on paul
[54:18] peter
[54:19] irenaeus
[54:21] martin
[54:22] luther
[54:23] columba
[54:24] and all those people that died under
[54:26] their ages
[54:28] they're waiting on me and you
[54:30] william branham is waiting on me and you
[54:33] to fulfill what he already said listen
[54:35] he does not have to come back and tell
[54:37] us another thing
[54:39] that's garbage
[54:40] you know what that's laziness
[54:46] that's laziness
[54:48] i'm waiting on somebody
[54:51] you know what i thought brother brown
[54:52] said god's waiting on you
[54:54] if i believe bro brown was the prophet
[54:56] right okay
[54:57] got the right group
[54:58] god's waiting on you
[55:01] to fulfill what he's already said
[55:04] don't have to have a prophet come back
[55:09] there's nowhere in the world a prophet
[55:10] ever came back and and perfected a group
[55:13] of people
[55:14] amen
[55:15] show me one
[55:17] even jesus didn't at that moment he said
[55:20] i must go away
[55:22] and then i'll come back in the holy
[55:24] ghost
[55:25] and i'm going to perfect you
[55:27] the people
[55:29] the people
[55:30] god wants a mini-member bride he don't
[55:32] want to just deal with one person
[55:34] he dealt with one person then brother
[55:36] branham we know that
[55:37] and and god forbid that we ever
[55:40] from this pulpit ever degrade what the
[55:42] prophet brought
[55:44] ever
[55:45] because there's no man
[55:47] born of a woman
[55:50] greater than william man branham
[55:53] with sex you understand what i mean
[55:55] because jesus was born
[55:57] but outside of jesus christ brother
[55:59] branham was right there
[56:01] all right
[56:03] but
[56:05] he's not the only one
[56:08] he didn't preach i i mean me
[56:11] he preached you you bride you you're
[56:14] gonna come to this you're going to do
[56:16] this god's going to do it through a
[56:17] group of people the bride will be the
[56:19] fullness of the godhead bodily the bride
[56:21] will be the son of man
[56:23] he was pushing all that glory to how
[56:26] many of us in the wedding
[56:29] ugly bunch of us men standing up here
[56:31] like this right here we got our suits on
[56:32] we about as goofy as all get out
[56:35] and we got a suit on it don't fit and
[56:37] you and your your your
[56:40] event coordinator said you got to wear
[56:41] these colors and you're going i need
[56:44] some jeans and a t-shirt
[56:48] whole crowd though
[56:51] it's wedding day
[56:54] the tension
[56:56] the excitement
[56:59] for the groom
[57:03] for the groom
[57:05] no
[57:07] they do not care if he's naked
[57:11] probably so
[57:14] that's what i got in trouble doing it
[57:15] where's jeffrey they're not here okay
[57:18] when jeffrey got married he was standing
[57:19] up beside me and he was doing this he
[57:20] was up as a some of y'all were there at
[57:22] the first methodist church and he was
[57:24] just he's doing this and i grabbed a
[57:25] hold of him i said look man i said just
[57:28] just put in your mind that all these
[57:29] people are naked
[57:32] but the problem was they had turned my
[57:34] microphone on
[57:35] [Laughter]
[57:37] some of our people
[57:39] that remained nameless
[57:41] had already turned the mic on
[57:43] so the whole crowd heard it
[57:47] but were they there for jeffrey
[57:50] no
[57:51] no he's just an accessory
[57:57] if he's here he knows he knows i'm just
[57:59] talking oh he's just an accessory
[58:02] but you know what god god showed us that
[58:04] in type though
[58:06] we you know who th listen this is the
[58:08] head
[58:09] this is the breadwinner
[58:10] this is the what the protector this is
[58:13] the guy that's going to protect this
[58:14] bride this is a guy that's going to take
[58:16] this bride till death do us part and go
[58:19] into what bring her to himself
[58:23] and they're going to have a honeymoon
[58:24] but before that
[58:27] he really don't want any i'd listen did
[58:30] all y'all want that attention
[58:32] guys
[58:33] no but but i mean as soon as the
[58:36] dum dum dum
[58:38] when i and the doors open
[58:40] what does everybody do everybody stands
[58:42] and turns and looks at the groom and
[58:44] says boy is a good looking guy
[58:46] no they do not care if he's there or not
[58:50] that bride
[58:54] has entered the room
[58:56] she's arrived

[1:00:50] shut in with god

[1:01:19] up that statue of perfect man he knows
[1:01:22] you're his bride that's right amen amen
[1:01:24] and like i said before you can fail but
[1:01:26] you'll never fall
[1:01:28] amen he knows this god you know you're
[1:01:30] going to have failures you've not been
[1:01:32] married 43 years we've had some failures
[1:01:36] but since the lord got a hold of both of
[1:01:37] us we've never fell
[1:01:41] same way with god
[1:01:44] when you get into this
[1:01:47] whatever you want to call it the family
[1:01:48] of god
[1:01:50] this marriage ceremony
[1:01:53] god gives you the new birth and what did
[1:01:55] brother brown say it's him and you
[1:01:57] in there as persons
[1:01:59] you've been shut into the holy of holies
[1:02:02] nobody else can get in there
[1:02:05] satan can't get into that in around that
[1:02:07] middle realm of you
[1:02:10] but you had to get there by process
[1:02:14] of justification
[1:02:15] sanctification
[1:02:17] and the baptism of the holy ghost now
[1:02:20] what is what is this justification just
[1:02:22] for a minute let me get off my notes for
[1:02:23] a second what is justification what is
[1:02:25] that justification
[1:02:27] that justification is not
[1:02:29] the justification where you justify it
[1:02:31] freely we'll get into that next sunday
[1:02:33] or wednesday night
[1:02:34] you're justified freely
[1:02:37] that's not that justification
[1:02:39] that justification only chops off your
[1:02:41] past sins
[1:02:43] god forgive me i am sorry for what i did
[1:02:46] and he knows if you are not godly sorrow
[1:02:48] leads to repentance
[1:02:50] so he knows and there's many people
[1:02:53] there's many people in the world that's
[1:02:55] been justified
[1:02:57] because god is honored to his word he
[1:02:59] says i'll he said if you say forgive me
[1:03:02] of my sins he'll forgive you your sins
[1:03:05] put them in the sea of god's
[1:03:06] forgetfulness never to be remembered
[1:03:08] again
[1:03:10] but you still got that old nature inside
[1:03:12] of you and this next day you walk you're
[1:03:13] going to do the same thing you did that
[1:03:15] you got forgiven for
[1:03:17] everybody with me
[1:03:19] but you're justified
[1:03:21] if you die along that journey
[1:03:25] like the thief on the cross
[1:03:27] god forgive him of his past sins
[1:03:30] and he was just
[1:03:32] by the justifier
[1:03:35] and he went to heaven
[1:03:36] same way with you but if you keep
[1:03:38] walking though
[1:03:39] and you start heaping them things back
[1:03:41] on you again
[1:03:42] because the unclean spirit's still there
[1:03:44] the one that made you
[1:03:47] angry curse
[1:03:49] throw somebody out of a window
[1:03:52] it's still there
[1:03:53] and it's still on the inside and that
[1:03:55] nature is attached to your nature and
[1:03:57] it's controlling you
[1:03:59] everybody okay with this
[1:04:01] it's controlling you
[1:04:03] but then you shed that off and you feel
[1:04:05] better because that load's been lifted
[1:04:07] if you really know that god forgive you
[1:04:09] your sins
[1:04:12] if you really are sorrowful
[1:04:14] of what you did
[1:04:16] listen there's a difference in being
[1:04:18] sorrowful for what you did and being
[1:04:20] sorry you got caught
[1:04:25] big difference
[1:04:28] that's why the people talk about finding
[1:04:30] jesus in jail
[1:04:31] people find jesus in jail because they
[1:04:33] fix it to go to prison so what's the
[1:04:35] first thing they do listen what's the
[1:04:36] first thing you do when you get when you
[1:04:38] get caught doing something they put you
[1:04:39] in prison
[1:04:40] you automatically you cut if you got
[1:04:42] long hair you cut your hair the lawyer
[1:04:44] tell you say son take a bath
[1:04:46] shave all that off your face
[1:04:49] hide your tattoos we're gonna make you
[1:04:51] look like a good guy
[1:04:54] hey man they don't want
[1:04:55] you don't see them going in for their
[1:04:57] real good court case not when they're
[1:04:58] not when they're put in jail but when
[1:05:00] they come up for their trial they're not
[1:05:02] in the same look that they don't look
[1:05:03] the same way they did when they walked
[1:05:04] in the first time
[1:05:06] they're all some of them put on
[1:05:08] three-piece suit
[1:05:10] had to be gift to them because they
[1:05:11] never did buy one
[1:05:12] but but you see what i'm saying you're
[1:05:14] trying to dress yourself up
[1:05:18] god knows that
[1:05:20] but if you're sorrowful and really
[1:05:22] sorrow
[1:05:23] godly sorrow leads you to repentance
[1:05:25] because you're going to continue on that
[1:05:26] journey
[1:05:27] god i know this is bothering me
[1:05:30] smoking donny we good
[1:05:32] smoking brother only smoke for a long
[1:05:33] time
[1:05:36] so did your mama
[1:05:38] so did a lot of you but even as they
[1:05:40] come into the church though they were
[1:05:42] still doing that that's why you have to
[1:05:44] watch and be careful i was talking to
[1:05:47] brother last night and
[1:05:49] what makes me
[1:05:50] what gets my righteous indignation up is
[1:05:53] that
[1:05:53] somebody will come into a congregation
[1:05:56] and come in and sit down
[1:05:57] and they'll
[1:05:59] have bob hair and
[1:06:01] you know their what do you call them
[1:06:02] earrings hanging down
[1:06:04] and first time ever in church
[1:06:07] first time ever been in church
[1:06:10] they're soft
[1:06:12] that may be like brother dick says
[1:06:13] that's fruit
[1:06:15] really soft
[1:06:16] because they number one either in this
[1:06:19] church usually is if they do come in
[1:06:21] here like this they supposed to go to
[1:06:22] that role be under
[1:06:24] and they found their way into this one
[1:06:26] but some people come that way though
[1:06:28] cindy
[1:06:30] i know she don't mind sandy don't mind
[1:06:32] cindy
[1:06:33] your aunt right your aunt no cousin
[1:06:36] come here and she was an absolute wreck
[1:06:40] we're not gonna get anywhere but i'm
[1:06:41] gonna tell this this is life anyway she
[1:06:43] was an absolute wreck y'all remember
[1:06:46] i mean she was just
[1:06:48] on pills
[1:06:50] right
[1:06:50] and alcohol
[1:06:52] no just pills all right well she was i
[1:06:54] mean pills bad
[1:06:56] come in with pants
[1:06:57] short hair
[1:06:59] she was here for three months i guess
[1:07:01] maybe
[1:07:03] and you know you get to looking around
[1:07:04] and you go
[1:07:07] ain't nobody wearing pants because
[1:07:08] brother dale they can get up there and
[1:07:09] hammer and i'll promise you that
[1:07:14] that's a good way to run them off
[1:07:16] let's have some wisdom let's have some
[1:07:18] knowledge and some temperance and some
[1:07:20] patience
[1:07:22] we were the fellowship meet one time
[1:07:23] brother jt pages and i cannot remember
[1:07:25] who was preaching but
[1:07:26] yeah i do actually
[1:07:29] this woman pentecostal woman comes in
[1:07:31] and she sits down right here brother jt
[1:07:32] well that's on this side sits right here
[1:07:34] i mean her hair is as short as mine she
[1:07:36] got like a lot fishing lures hanging
[1:07:37] down off of her ears
[1:07:41] and he lost his sermon making sure that
[1:07:44] woman
[1:07:45] knew that it was wrong to cut your hair
[1:07:48] he beat her to a pulp
[1:07:50] she never came back
[1:07:52] that i know of never saw her again
[1:07:55] you know what it's not her fault
[1:07:57] it's that preacher's fault
[1:08:01] she's brand new
[1:08:03] do you know what though and i started to
[1:08:05] tell that preacher because he said i had
[1:08:07] to hit that that woman come in here and
[1:08:08] sat down like that and i'm just i just
[1:08:09] walked off
[1:08:11] i did not say anything hello
[1:08:14] i didn't want to bruise any fruit myself
[1:08:17] but i thought what if that woman
[1:08:21] the night before had been in a meeting
[1:08:24] and god had forgive her of all of that
[1:08:27] sin
[1:08:29] i believe the prophet of god said
[1:08:30] somewhere that says sisters if you get
[1:08:32] the new birth your hair is just as long
[1:08:34] as the other sister it's just got to
[1:08:36] have time to grow out so look at that
[1:08:38] forget the outside appearance
[1:08:42] preach the word of god to him i was
[1:08:43] talking to somebody yeah brother isaac
[1:08:46] in ohio last night i said look if
[1:08:47] there's a new person comes in now i know
[1:08:49] sister paul is in the message but you
[1:08:51] get these that come in that you know you
[1:08:53] know they're not
[1:08:54] tell them about one god
[1:08:57] tell them about water baptism
[1:08:59] tell them about how god can save their
[1:09:00] soul
[1:09:02] not how much they go into hell cause
[1:09:03] their hair short is mine that's wisdom
[1:09:06] folks that's wisdom of and dad's never
[1:09:09] done that cindy sat here for three
[1:09:10] months and we didn't have to go you need
[1:09:12] to put on a dress and i think we did one
[1:09:14] time later on didn't we because we
[1:09:16] talked to her and said look you know if
[1:09:18] you gonna start coming and buddy
[1:09:20] immediately what did she do
[1:09:21] no earrings she got better
[1:09:25] got off of the drugs or whatever she got
[1:09:27] better
[1:09:28] and took all that off no makeup and we
[1:09:30] didn't have to sit there and pound on
[1:09:32] her every week see that's bringing them
[1:09:35] in slow
[1:09:37] that's bringing them in and you know
[1:09:38] what if she just received the new birth
[1:09:42] she bored again
[1:09:43] she's my sister
[1:09:45] oh no she's got to know the seals
[1:09:47] really
[1:09:49] everybody don't it's not given to
[1:09:50] everybody to know that
[1:09:52] it's just given to some
[1:09:55] right but
[1:09:58] so there's a supernatural element i kind
[1:10:00] of got off
[1:10:01] despite the revelation what is the
[1:10:03] supernatural element the supernatural
[1:10:05] element is not that you got to live this
[1:10:07] message it's that serpent seed carries
[1:10:10] all the way from the garden all the way
[1:10:11] to the body change
[1:10:16] if you can't see that then you need to
[1:10:17] go back
[1:10:19] read it again
[1:10:21] and it's not sex
[1:10:24] okay
[1:10:27] actually it's
[1:10:29] unclean living
[1:10:30] with the devil
[1:10:32] in your mind
[1:10:35] your thoughts and ideas contrary to god
[1:10:37] is fornication to god
[1:10:40] amen that's hard to say but that's what
[1:10:42] it is
[1:10:44] it's contrary to any listen anything
[1:10:47] contrary to god
[1:10:49] is the devil
[1:10:50] anything
[1:10:52] contrary to god is the devil
[1:10:54] so if you're contrary to god there's
[1:10:56] some part of you that there's a demon
[1:10:59] i fight them you fight them but i might
[1:11:01] fight different ones than you fight
[1:11:03] but we still fighting them
[1:11:05] it's like chris brother chris long the
[1:11:08] conflict between god and satan there is
[1:11:10] no conflict between god and satan god
[1:11:13] always wins
[1:11:14] you're the conflict
[1:11:16] you're standing in the middle
[1:11:18] you're either letting this one
[1:11:20] black dog
[1:11:22] or this one white dog win the battle
[1:11:26] listen you don't have white dog black
[1:11:27] dog in you if you're not born again
[1:11:30] it's all black dog
[1:11:32] i'm sorry for the analogy but brother
[1:11:33] brown used it so
[1:11:38] it's who you feed the most
[1:11:41] amen
[1:11:43] i'll promise you one thing
[1:11:46] give god a little more attention
[1:11:49] this week
[1:11:54] and let's see how sunday or wednesday

[1:15:55] i got stuff it was me that was crying i
[1:15:58] got stung by walton and jerry comes
[1:16:00] driving up in his old white truck you
[1:16:01] know and he said what are you doing i
[1:16:03] put my arm right there
[1:16:04] i said you got any i knew he did i said
[1:16:06] you ain't trying to back oh i wanted him
[1:16:07] to give me something out of the can
[1:16:11] oh yeah that's exactly what he did what
[1:16:13] a neighbor
[1:16:14] he goes here
[1:16:20] and i'm like i feel better already
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:24] so i just mashed it up because
[1:16:27] tobacco will
[1:16:28] kill the sting i mean that's just not we
[1:16:30] just didn't do that for but he's like
[1:16:36] but that's how that spirit will get you
[1:16:38] though
[1:16:39] but you know what first thing you did
[1:16:41] filled her back out
[1:16:45] he wasn't gonna waste a good dip no he
[1:16:46] wasn't
[1:16:48] but that's how it is with us in our walk
[1:16:50] though with god there's certain things
[1:16:51] we can't get rid of and there's certain
[1:16:53] things we can there's certain things
[1:16:55] that god knows that if you keep going
[1:16:57] through your life that's going to hinder
[1:16:58] you your whole life
[1:17:01] and then satan will tempt you the next
[1:17:02] day like i said and he'll be going here
[1:17:05] you know you'd be go to your desk and
[1:17:06] sit down and then you know it's like a
[1:17:08] two for one they they got a pile of them
[1:17:11] on your desk
[1:17:12] and you're like i don't need these
[1:17:13] anymore what
[1:17:15] what
[1:17:17] where'd that person go i said he died
[1:17:20] he died
[1:17:23] he died
[1:17:25] god let it die
[1:17:26] [Applause]
[1:17:27] and i didn't have a desire for it no
[1:17:29] more
[1:17:31] no more
[1:17:32] didn't even care nothing about it
[1:17:35] i had
[1:17:36] probably 50 dollars of that stuff laying
[1:17:38] around
[1:17:40] i give it away
[1:17:42] i just said here i don't want it no more
[1:17:44] get out of my house
[1:17:45] now if we'll do that with everything
[1:17:49] every little thing that bothers us you
[1:17:51] don't have to be skull
[1:17:53] it don't have to be alcohol it can be

[1:18:46] but i got into a fog
[1:18:49] a good fog
[1:18:52] and you know what's the first thing you
[1:18:53] do when you get in a fog
[1:18:56] being a
[1:18:57] the carnality part of me
[1:19:00] you quit praying
[1:19:03] you decide not to read your bible that
[1:19:05] day because it's not going to do you any
[1:19:06] good
[1:19:08] because you got this bad attitude
[1:19:10] these things are going through your head
[1:19:12] that shouldn't be going through your
[1:19:13] head
[1:19:15] i'm just being real
[1:19:17] those things go through your head
[1:19:19] and you let them
[1:19:21] build a case
[1:19:23] you let them
[1:19:24] drag you down
[1:19:26] when the that's that's what brother
[1:19:27] dale's always said he said look he said
[1:19:30] if anything's ever bothering you the
[1:19:32] first thing we do what do we do as human
[1:19:33] beings we quit church
[1:19:38] wake up
[1:19:40] we quit church
[1:19:45] don't say you disappear and then when

[1:20:11] will help you
[1:20:13] man our woman
[1:20:14] amen
[1:20:16] so you got to fight that here's my point
[1:20:18] you got to fight that you got to fight
[1:20:20] that
[1:20:22] right
[1:20:23] just like i thought right
[1:20:25] you got to fight that thing
[1:20:28] last sunday morning it was a battle i
[1:20:30] felt like i was a flat tire
[1:20:34] y'all didn't respond
[1:20:36] to nothing
[1:20:38] but you know what i took that all on me
[1:20:40] not you
[1:20:42] because it's really easy to put it on
[1:20:43] you
[1:20:46] so i studied a little more this week
[1:20:49] i still did some things i shouldn't have
[1:20:51] done i'm human being
[1:20:55] but i took just a little more and said
[1:20:56] lord lord
[1:20:59] that part of me i'm having a problem
[1:21:00] with
[1:21:03] i can't handle it
[1:21:06] i'm going to give it to you
[1:21:09] amen
[1:21:10] i'm going to give it to you
[1:21:13] he said give me your burdens
[1:21:16] and he said even if you have a burden
[1:21:19] i'll make it light
[1:21:21] who makes it heavy
[1:21:23] we do
[1:21:25] we're the ones that get all this messed
[1:21:28] up when you just need to
[1:21:30] that's why i opened up the church a
[1:21:32] couple of sundays a couple of saturdays
[1:21:33] ago
[1:21:34] and listen you don't have to come i'm
[1:21:35] telling you
[1:21:37] but the atmosphere we had for those of
[1:21:38] you that did come it was wonderful amen
[1:21:42] just a quiet nobody's talking nobody's
[1:21:44] conversing we're not talking about the
[1:21:46] ball game we come in here we're playing
[1:21:48] some soft music and we brother donny was
[1:21:50] sitting here and i was there on my knees
[1:21:51] praying
[1:21:53] and people come in you didn't know i
[1:21:54] didn't care who was here or not really i
[1:21:56] mean i do care i wish everybody come but
[1:21:58] you don't have to
[1:21:59] but see that clears some of the trash
[1:22:01] out
[1:22:03] and that's what we're talking about here
[1:22:04] we're not talking about you know even
[1:22:05] you say well do you need to get the holy
[1:22:07] ghost some might
[1:22:10] listen you got to fight your way
[1:22:12] find your way to the new birth
[1:22:16] i've never seen a birth that was not
[1:22:18] messy
[1:22:20] didn't hurt a little bit
[1:22:23] sisters say amen
[1:22:26] and it hurt us because y'all was always
[1:22:27] beating on us
[1:22:29] for making you have one
[1:22:32] that's turmoil
[1:22:34] messi
[1:22:36] and brother brown said you can have all
[1:22:37] the white
[1:22:39] sheets
[1:22:40] and and the pink walls and the floors is
[1:22:43] all beautiful
[1:22:45] but when that birth got finished
[1:22:48] you had to clean a mess up
[1:22:50] right regardless you cleaned a mess up
[1:22:53] well that's what a birth is a birth is a
[1:22:55] mess
[1:22:57] you absolutely listen your whole insides
[1:22:59] are torn out of you
[1:23:01] that was mine
[1:23:02] because there's something new came in
[1:23:05] it's a new birth it's a new thought it's
[1:23:07] a new idea
[1:23:08] it's a new
[1:23:10] feeling
[1:23:12] okay brother don't go by feelings i
[1:23:13] don't but if you connect feelings with
[1:23:15] everything else
[1:23:18] don't just go on feelings
[1:23:20] but connect those feelings
[1:23:23] with being closer to god
[1:23:25] have more communion with him
[1:23:28] have more of a
[1:23:29] have some quiet time
[1:23:31] come to the church and pray we're going
[1:23:32] to have those again so we're going to
[1:23:34] have them where you can come in and just
[1:23:36] just pray and have have you know some
[1:23:39] meditation and
[1:23:40] and get ready for the services coming
[1:23:43] coming up we're probably going to do
[1:23:44] that before july when we have our july
[1:23:46] services we'll probably open up the
[1:23:48] saturday before
[1:23:50] and just have a prayer session
[1:23:52] amen
[1:23:54] and talk to god
[1:23:56] when i talk to each other talk to god
[1:23:59] it's not a time to talk about the sales
[1:24:01] there's time for that
[1:24:03] it's not time to talk about daniel 70
[1:24:04] weeks that's there's a time for that
[1:24:06] but it's the time to talk to god
[1:24:08] say god i got this problem
[1:24:10] i got this issue
[1:24:12] i know i'm your child
[1:24:14] because i wouldn't be here for what
[1:24:18] i wouldn't be here if i wasn't your
[1:24:19] child
[1:24:20] but i got a problem i can't get through
[1:24:22] with
[1:24:23] now you know what i'm going to do i'm
[1:24:24] going to just lay it over on you lord
[1:24:28] but you better watch it
[1:24:30] because it may not all turn out the way
[1:24:32] you want it to turn out
[1:24:34] amen
[1:24:36] trials and tribulations are still here
[1:24:38] but you ask for your children you ask
[1:24:40] for your some of your mothers and
[1:24:42] fathers are not in the message and
[1:24:43] different ones are not in the message
[1:24:45] you ask for them and then you know what
[1:24:46] you got to do
[1:24:51] i like what brother claude weissinger
[1:24:52] said he said you know what we do he said
[1:24:54] we give our children to god and then the
[1:24:56] first time they get into trouble we go
[1:24:57] oh god take that away from them keep
[1:25:00] them out of trouble bless them lord no
[1:25:02] you've done took off all that that god's
[1:25:04] trying to get them to do
[1:25:07] you have to just shut up
[1:25:11] god i give them to you i can't save them
[1:25:14] you got to save them
[1:25:17] and you promised me you would
[1:25:19] because in isaiah says that i'll be
[1:25:21] there with my offspring
[1:25:23] i'll be there with my possession
[1:25:27] and i've got nowhere
[1:25:29] with this sermon
[1:25:31] but we'll we'll catch it a little bit
[1:25:33] more
[1:25:34] [Applause]
[1:25:36] sometimes we have to come from the heart
[1:25:40] but i want to read this one before we do
[1:25:42] close first corinthians 2
[1:25:44] verse 9-14 let's read that
[1:25:52] we're never going to get away from
[1:25:53] trials
[1:25:55] but watch this right here
[1:26:00] but as it is written eye hath not seen
[1:26:03] nor ear heard
[1:26:04] neither have entered into the heart of
[1:26:06] man
[1:26:07] the things which god hath prepared
[1:26:10] for them
[1:26:12] that love him amen
[1:26:15] but god hath revealed them unto us
[1:26:19] by his spirit
[1:26:21] for the spirit searcheth
[1:26:24] searcheth all things
[1:26:28] it's going to your house it's going to
[1:26:29] your house
[1:26:30] searcheth all things
[1:26:33] yay
[1:26:34] the deep things of god amen
[1:26:37] not just of water baptism and of the new
[1:26:39] birth but the deeper things of god and
[1:26:41] the only way you're going to get the
[1:26:42] deeper things of god god's going to give
[1:26:44] them to you right there
[1:26:46] he'll choke you
[1:26:47] you'll
[1:26:48] choke all of us like meat right please
[1:26:51] don't be a vegetarian
[1:26:56] god gave you incisors use them
[1:26:58] amen
[1:26:59] thank you
[1:27:02] but did you start a little cambridge not
[1:27:04] here i was going to use did you start
[1:27:06] your baby on me
[1:27:08] no you started on milk
[1:27:10] because you don't have no teeth
[1:27:12] same way with god when god saves you and
[1:27:14] god gives you the new birth he don't
[1:27:16] expect you to understand the seal
[1:27:18] you know but you know what he expects he
[1:27:19] expects you to want to
[1:27:22] he expects you to want to do that
[1:27:24] that desire in there i want more of you
[1:27:27] to open up to me instead of this being
[1:27:29] just a boredom place to be
[1:27:34] for what man know what the things of god
[1:27:36] of a man
[1:27:37] look save the spirit of man which this
[1:27:40] is what i'm telling you about the new
[1:27:41] birth
[1:27:43] you can't have the new birth right here
[1:27:46] because of this scripture right here for
[1:27:48] what man knoweth the things of a man
[1:27:51] save the spirit of man which is in him
[1:27:54] so if you have the spirit of the devil
[1:27:55] who do you understand
[1:27:57] the devil
[1:27:58] if you have the spirit of god who do you
[1:28:00] understand god
[1:28:02] amen pretty one two three simple in them
[1:28:05] even so the things of god knoweth no man
[1:28:09] but the spirit of god
[1:28:12] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:28:14] the world
[1:28:16] but the spirit which is of god
[1:28:20] at your new birth you receive the spirit
[1:28:21] of god
[1:28:23] all right
[1:28:24] at the new birth
[1:28:26] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:28:28] the world
[1:28:29] but the spirit which is of god
[1:28:31] that we might know the things that are
[1:28:33] freely given to us of god you're in the
[1:28:36] family
[1:28:38] you're in the house
[1:28:43] all you need to do is take what you need
[1:28:46] which things also we speak
[1:28:48] not in the word which man's look wisdom
[1:28:51] you say oh no wisdom that's wisdom
[1:28:53] that's knowledge right here no
[1:28:56] man's wisdom is man's wisdom
[1:28:58] god's wisdom is totally different
[1:29:01] man's wisdom will get you all messed up
[1:29:04] which things also we speak not in the
[1:29:06] words which man's wisdom teacheth but
[1:29:09] which the holy ghost teaches look
[1:29:10] comparing spiritual things with
[1:29:12] spiritual
[1:29:13] how can you do that without the new
[1:29:15] birth
[1:29:16] you're not spiritual yeah you might be
[1:29:18] spiritual all right but you ain't a holy
[1:29:19] one
[1:29:21] you got a spirit on you there's no doubt
[1:29:23] but it ain't holy until you get the new
[1:29:25] birth then you get the holy spirit
[1:29:28] but watch this right here we'll read
[1:29:29] this and then we'll take communion
[1:29:32] but the natural man receiveth not the
[1:29:34] things of the spirit of
[1:29:36] god the natural man
[1:29:39] the worldly man
[1:29:41] even the man is in justification and
[1:29:43] sanctification you can't get the things
[1:29:45] of god because remember sanctification
[1:29:47] which we never got to we were talking
[1:29:48] about a little bit a few minutes ago but
[1:29:50] that's cleaned and set aside
[1:29:53] for service not in service
[1:29:56] not god's not going to use a novice he's
[1:29:58] not going to use somebody that's
[1:29:59] sanctified
[1:30:01] like he would use somebody that's filled
[1:30:02] with the holy ghost
[1:30:04] all right now you're working toward it
[1:30:06] don't ever forget that you're working
[1:30:07] toward it
[1:30:09] because it's the work of the holy ghost
[1:30:10] if you receive the new birth that is the
[1:30:12] work of the holy ghost
[1:30:14] now watch
[1:30:15] for they are foolishness look but the
[1:30:17] natural man receiveth not the things of
[1:30:19] the spirit of god for they are
[1:30:21] foolishness
[1:30:23] foolishness unto him foolishness unto
[1:30:26] god
[1:30:28] neither can he know them
[1:30:31] because they are spiritually
[1:30:33] discerned there's no way
[1:30:36] you can know anything about these godly
[1:30:38] virtues without having a new birth
[1:30:42] because you can't discern
[1:30:44] the next step
[1:30:46] you can't discern what god wants
[1:30:49] to do with you
[1:30:51] without him being the one inside of you
[1:30:54] you can't do it
[1:30:55] you're just wandering stars you don't
[1:30:57] you have no direction
[1:30:59] like i said
[1:31:00] before when i received the new birth
[1:31:04] i went through justification i went
[1:31:05] through sanctification i can tell you
[1:31:06] how and when because i told you some of
[1:31:08] it there
[1:31:10] but you know when i got the new birth it
[1:31:11] wasn't a shouting screaming affair
[1:31:16] i was in a i was in a
[1:31:18] motor home in
[1:31:19] kentucky
[1:31:22] lake malone
[1:31:24] i'd been listening
[1:31:26] i think it was maybe may not been
[1:31:28] brotherdale may have been brother
[1:31:29] branham i can't remember but i was
[1:31:30] reading the book
[1:31:32] and i said god i need we we need to have
[1:31:35] a meeting
[1:31:36] this this thing needs to be put together
[1:31:39] because i don't understand this right
[1:31:40] here i see this piece and this piece but
[1:31:42] there's a piece missing
[1:31:45] well but something just dropped over me
[1:31:47] like a blanket
[1:31:50] i raised my hand to god
[1:31:53] and god's my witness whatever i was
[1:31:55] studying everything just started doing
[1:31:56] this
[1:31:59] coming together
[1:32:00] oh that's what that's about oh that's
[1:32:02] why you did that that's what that's for
[1:32:05] go to this scripture right here oh
[1:32:06] that's what you're talking about and
[1:32:08] it's just like a beautiful picture and
[1:32:10] it all just started coming together i
[1:32:12] didn't have a shouting fit but i did
[1:32:13] have an experience
[1:32:16] it was in the calmness
[1:32:18] now now listen though if i if you'd have
[1:32:20] been in another dimension
[1:32:23] it's where the messiness was
[1:32:25] because the birth's always a mess
[1:32:28] my my soul was being burnt
[1:32:32] listen we don't believe in getting a new
[1:32:34] soul
[1:32:35] god don't take your soul out and give
[1:32:36] you a new one
[1:32:38] no he burns off that old nature that's
[1:32:41] in the one you got
[1:32:42] and then he takes his soul and puts it
[1:32:44] inside of you
[1:32:46] vulcanization
[1:32:48] and that's what he was doing it was
[1:32:49] burning all that out
[1:32:51] when he placed that in there and look
[1:32:53] what went away was the confusion
[1:32:58] it wasn't the cursing
[1:33:00] it wasn't the it wasn't the chewing
[1:33:02] tobacco it wasn't the
[1:33:06] whatever you want to put in there like i
[1:33:07] say your laundry list what you have a
[1:33:09] different one than i do but my laundry
[1:33:11] list was they had already left me
[1:33:14] i was in a state of sanctification i was
[1:33:15] clean and set aside for service i didn't
[1:33:17] have all that stuff worrying me right
[1:33:19] then
[1:33:20] i was worried that i couldn't get the
[1:33:21] word to fit together
[1:33:23] and what does the holy ghost do he
[1:33:25] divinely
[1:33:27] puts the word together
[1:33:29] rightly dividing the word of truth
[1:33:33] so that and and one of the brothers the
[1:33:35] other day said look if you don't
[1:33:36] understand if you don't understand the
[1:33:38] word of god
[1:33:40] pray
[1:33:42] because listen the holy ghost can't be
[1:33:44] confused
[1:33:46] listen the holy ghost can't confuse you
[1:33:50] you can confuse you
[1:33:53] but the holy ghost can't confuse you
[1:33:54] listen it's like the bible says why
[1:33:56] would a why would a father
[1:34:00] if a child is hungry and he comes up to
[1:34:01] you and says says dad
[1:34:03] i'm starving to death oh here here's a
[1:34:06] scorpion
[1:34:07] chewing out a while
[1:34:09] or or i need some bread here's a rock
[1:34:13] that's not god
[1:34:16] god's gonna give you bread
[1:34:18] he's going to give you something to eat
[1:34:20] he's going to direct you to church he's
[1:34:22] going to direct you to a message he's
[1:34:24] going to direct you to a scripture in
[1:34:26] the bible that you can compare yourself
[1:34:28] with
[1:34:29] genesis 1 26 would be mine if you don't
[1:34:31] mind you all know that
[1:34:34] but see i begin then to have a substance
[1:34:38] faith that's what i was trying to get to
[1:34:40] a substance faith what something that
[1:34:42] god can work on
[1:34:45] something that god can build on top of
[1:34:48] but if you don't have that foundation
[1:34:50] what's he going to build on if a man
[1:34:52] built on sand
[1:34:57] remember the seed the four times you
[1:34:58] know it was on stony ground it was on
[1:35:00] this ground it was on that ground and
[1:35:02] the cares of life took this one away and
[1:35:04] because of the word this one went away
[1:35:05] and because this one this they didn't
[1:35:06] grow
[1:35:08] but now there was one that did
[1:35:11] there was one so there's a promise
[1:35:12] there's one piece of dirt
[1:35:16] everybody takes a finger and do this
[1:35:19] do this
[1:35:21] that's the piece of dirt i'm talking
[1:35:22] about
[1:35:24] take this piece of dirt
[1:35:27] and put that seed the word of god the
[1:35:30] quickened word of god in this man
[1:35:32] and let it live yes
[1:35:34] let it bring forth fruit that's what
[1:35:36] every plant listen every plant that i
[1:35:39] plant in my garden it watched from the
[1:35:41] time i put it in the ground it's
[1:35:43] actually in the pack
[1:35:44] in the pack right now in my bedroom
[1:35:46] going let me out
[1:35:51] i want to produce some corn
[1:35:53] i want to produce some
[1:35:55] beans
[1:35:57] right there's a desire in every one of
[1:35:59] those seeds
[1:36:01] but what do you got to do
[1:36:03] if i leave them in the bedroom inside
[1:36:04] that seal full pack
[1:36:07] never will they grow
[1:36:11] oh they might get a little damp one day
[1:36:14] and stick a little shoot up and come to
[1:36:16] church just every once in a while i'm
[1:36:17] sorry i'm gonna say that
[1:36:19] come to church just every once in a
[1:36:21] while and all of a sudden
[1:36:26] i'm on fire for god
[1:36:28] two weeks later they're gone
[1:36:31] no you take that seed
[1:36:33] and you give it some good teaching
[1:36:36] this is where you need to go
[1:36:39] because see when i wanted to learn about
[1:36:40] my garden
[1:36:42] i asked my mom and daddy
[1:36:45] but that was 1960 something gardening i
[1:36:49] brought it up to updated revelation
[1:36:52] and i started planting
[1:36:54] the seed before i put the fertilizer to
[1:36:56] it
[1:36:57] and man they just grew like crazy then i
[1:36:59] put the fertilizer to it see that's not
[1:37:01] saying anything wrong about the old
[1:37:02] revelation but the new revelation was
[1:37:04] this was growing some big plants
[1:37:07] all right
[1:37:09] but i got it from youtube
[1:37:14] what's that where's louise
[1:37:16] well he's like what's that
[1:37:22] everybody knows what youtube is okay
[1:37:24] gardening how to grow
[1:37:28] this is what it tells you to do well
[1:37:29] that's what i've done and guess what i
[1:37:30] got a good garden guess what you know
[1:37:31] what i come to church
[1:37:33] i knew where to find my information
[1:37:38] i knew where to come to get my
[1:37:40] information from
[1:37:42] and it was right here
[1:37:44] and it was studying the bible talking to
[1:37:46] my brothers and sisters showing
[1:37:48] experiences having experiences but
[1:37:50] remember what if that seed is ever going
[1:37:53] to mature it's got to be put in the
[1:37:54] right place
[1:37:57] sure you listen you can put a seed in
[1:37:59] water
[1:38:01] and it'll sprout
[1:38:03] you put just
[1:38:04] the way we that you can you can
[1:38:06] accelerate here we go aaron i'm on a
[1:38:09] rabbit trail
[1:38:11] if you want
[1:38:13] you started on one wednesday night you
[1:38:14] hear what i said i said get back off
[1:38:16] that trail
[1:38:17] but if you take your seeds and put them
[1:38:19] in water and then put paper towels on
[1:38:21] top of them they will sprout and then
[1:38:22] you can put them in the ground and
[1:38:24] they'll grow faster
[1:38:25] okay
[1:38:27] well you know what that's a new
[1:38:28] revelation
[1:38:30] everybody with me on this i'm not out in
[1:38:32] the garden anymore
[1:38:35] same seed
[1:38:38] same seed
[1:38:39] different environment
[1:38:41] produces faster
[1:38:42] because i put it in a place to where it
[1:38:44] said moisture
[1:38:47] moisture
[1:38:49] i need that
[1:38:50] i need sunlight
[1:38:52] but you can't leave it in that paper
[1:38:54] towel
[1:38:55] because then it'll go with the carriage
[1:38:56] of life
[1:38:59] and and false teaching and
[1:39:01] and getting away from the word of god
[1:39:04] i'll just wither and die
[1:39:07] but put me in some good dirt
[1:39:10] get me a good row started and and put
[1:39:13] just a a little bit of a potting soil
[1:39:15] that's got to live just enough
[1:39:17] fertilizer to get that thing out of the
[1:39:18] ground
[1:39:19] and man
[1:39:21] i'll have beans we ain't talking about
[1:39:23] beans because we ain't plant beans this
[1:39:24] year
[1:39:25] we got thousands of cans of beans
[1:39:28] but we're gonna plant some other things
[1:39:30] but here they come out of the ground
[1:39:31] well you know what they're doing they're
[1:39:32] in the right environment
[1:39:33] and you know what they're gonna do
[1:39:34] there's no way they can't produce
[1:39:37] if i put a corn in the ground it's going
[1:39:39] to produce a stalk if i give it all the
[1:39:40] nutrition and give it all the water and
[1:39:43] take it to church every sunday and every
[1:39:45] wednesday and read the word of god
[1:39:49] washing of water by the word
[1:39:51] put it in my furrow guess what i'm gonna
[1:39:54] get i'm gonna get a cornstalk about this
[1:39:56] high
[1:39:57] with two real good ears that from that
[1:39:59] one kernel of corn there's probably like
[1:40:02] 2500
[1:40:04] seeds
[1:40:06] on each ear and you got two of them
[1:40:09] so out of one you get five thousand
[1:40:11] and if it's an heirloom you can take
[1:40:13] those two off and you can put them in a
[1:40:15] in a dry place and they dry up and you
[1:40:16] can plant that seed for next year
[1:40:19] spiritual
[1:40:20] multiplication just like natural
[1:40:23] multiplication but it takes the right
[1:40:25] environment and you know what it does it
[1:40:26] takes knowing what to do
[1:40:29] knowing where to go to get your
[1:40:30] information
[1:40:32] and now we can all plant a good garden
[1:40:33] this year
[1:40:35] let's stand our feet
[1:40:38] we'll get to the new birth wednesday
[1:40:39] night maybe
[1:40:41] but that sanctification let me get this
[1:40:43] before we before we finish this
[1:40:45] sanctification i mean this justification
[1:40:46] this sanctification
[1:40:48] is not exactly the same as this because
[1:40:50] remember this sanctification is clean
[1:40:53] and set aside for service but now you've
[1:40:55] already got once you get the new birth
[1:40:57] you can't go back and say i'm cleaning
[1:40:59] the set aside for service like that
[1:41:02] right right because you're already
[1:41:04] sealed in devil's sealed out but you are
[1:41:07] clean and set aside for the next step
[1:41:12] it's not just you it's not that you're
[1:41:13] empty and that you need the new birth
[1:41:17] you've got the new birth at faith
[1:41:19] but what you need
[1:41:20] you need to keep putting it in the right
[1:41:22] environment you keep putting the
[1:41:23] fertilizer to it you keep feeding it by
[1:41:26] the way and giving it the washing of the
[1:41:27] water by the word keep praying keep keep
[1:41:30] listening to the tapes keep out listen
[1:41:33] press play when you want to
[1:41:37] but don't let that be your god
[1:41:39] because that's not the way the bible
[1:41:41] says you're going to get
[1:41:42] perfection
[1:41:43] it's through a five-fold ministry paul
[1:41:46] even said by the foolishness of
[1:41:47] preaching
[1:41:49] foolishness of preaching sometimes we
[1:41:50] act to look foolish
[1:41:52] but this is the way god wants it
[1:41:55] you know why he knows that's the only
[1:41:57] way you can get it
[1:41:59] god didn't write this bible per se to
[1:42:01] conform to him
[1:42:04] hold on he wrote this bible seeing what
[1:42:06] you would conform to
[1:42:10] what brother brown say he said which age
[1:42:12] would you rather be in he said i'd
[1:42:13] rather be in this age around here why he
[1:42:15] was conformed to this age right here
[1:42:17] of course he was a church age messenger
[1:42:18] but you and i were not conformed to
[1:42:20] being luther's age so god didn't put us
[1:42:22] in luther's age he put us in this age
[1:42:26] he bred this one to this one this one to
[1:42:27] this one
[1:42:28] oh listen folks how many how many of you
[1:42:30] people
[1:42:31] have people that were in the military
[1:42:34] and some of your family that was in the
[1:42:36] middle that served in the military
[1:42:38] okay
[1:42:41] close like how many some anybody have a
[1:42:43] father that was in the military
[1:42:46] hmm
[1:42:48] what if he got killed in the army
[1:42:52] hey
[1:42:54] what if he died what if he got shot
[1:42:57] you never got here
[1:43:00] talk about guardian angels
[1:43:05] let's listen to a story last night
[1:43:08] man was telling that
[1:43:11] he met this older gentleman was in world
[1:43:12] war ii and he was at d-day
[1:43:15] and he was one of the fortunate ones
[1:43:17] that didn't get killed he said but as
[1:43:18] soon as he said as soon as that there
[1:43:20] was like
[1:43:21] i think it was 300 or 200 on a boat
[1:43:24] those those pt boats that comes in and
[1:43:26] got that big thing it goes down like
[1:43:28] this well once that thing i mean if it's
[1:43:29] up like this
[1:43:31] i mean the bullets ain't going to hit
[1:43:32] you because it's bulletproof
[1:43:34] but he said once that thing falls down
[1:43:35] he said the germans all they had to do
[1:43:37] it's not moving
[1:43:38] it's coming straight forward so all
[1:43:40] you've got to do is go
[1:43:42] he said they were he said they were men
[1:43:44] falling around him he said we just push
[1:43:46] forward he said the sergeant said go go
[1:43:49] go pushed him forward he said there was
[1:43:51] people falling right and left he said
[1:43:53] when i hit the water it was red
[1:43:56] he said when i got to the beach he said
[1:43:58] it was red
[1:44:00] he said and i ran to the nearest
[1:44:02] he got under some kind of cliff
[1:44:05] so he made it to that wall
[1:44:08] but why didn't he die
[1:44:10] he had somebody sitting in a man's
[1:44:12] congregation
[1:44:13] that was a son and daughter of god
[1:44:16] and it had to come through him
[1:44:21] i told him that brother ron spencer's
[1:44:22] when i preached for him several years
[1:44:23] ago
[1:44:24] i said there was 600 000 men killed in
[1:44:27] the civil war
[1:44:28] and that wasn't foreigners
[1:44:30] that was your that was here the united
[1:44:32] states and i said in virginia and north
[1:44:34] carolina and tennessee was the most
[1:44:36] death because of the battles were right
[1:44:38] there
[1:44:39] you know they have 20 000 people killed
[1:44:42] on one day i think
[1:44:44] gettysburg
[1:44:45] that's 20 000 that's 20 000 generations
[1:44:48] was cut off in one day
[1:44:51] yet they were sitting in that
[1:44:52] congregation and they all had people
[1:44:53] from the civil war
[1:44:55] that was there that was their kin folks
[1:44:58] i said you wouldn't have been here
[1:45:01] if god hadn't known you needed to be
[1:45:03] here
[1:45:04] because you were a son and daughter of
[1:45:05] god from the foundation of the world
[1:45:09] but folks that just starts our journey
[1:45:12] realizing who you are just starts your
[1:45:14] journey
[1:45:16] realizing who you are and what you're
[1:45:18] doing here
[1:45:19] the prophet of god said you'll be an
[1:45:20] invincible army
[1:45:22] let's let's bow our heads
[1:45:25] lord thank you for this day that you
[1:45:26] give us
[1:45:28] thank you for letting us share our life
[1:45:29] we know we all
[1:45:31] have things that we are ashamed of lord
[1:45:33] but we also have things that we're proud
[1:45:35] of
[1:45:37] we're proud lord that you one day
[1:45:39] save this wretched center
[1:45:42] and then about six months later you gave
[1:45:45] me the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:45:48] save my soul
[1:45:50] and put me in a kingdom
[1:45:52] a kingdom with no end
[1:45:55] and lord i've
[1:45:57] been here in this congregation now for
[1:46:00] 20-something years
[1:46:03] i've told you many times i'm sorry for
[1:46:05] wasting the time that i wasted in the
[1:46:06] world but that had to be part of our
[1:46:08] journey
[1:46:11] but lord when we come back
[1:46:13] you brought us back lord
[1:46:14] and i've watched
[1:46:16] the ones in this church that grew up
[1:46:18] with us
[1:46:19] and how that they've grown
[1:46:21] from babies to full adults
[1:46:23] not only in natural but in spiritual
[1:46:27] lord i thank you for that for letting me
[1:46:29] be a part of this
[1:46:31] and lord all the
[1:46:33] the desires and and things that that are
[1:46:35] contrary to you lord i pray that you
[1:46:37] take them away from us
[1:46:39] that our desire would be on you lord
[1:46:44] you said you're an ever-present help in
[1:46:45] a time of trouble
[1:46:48] lord we may not be in trouble physically
[1:46:51] but spiritually lord we all have our
[1:46:53] battles
[1:46:54] and i pray lord that
[1:46:57] you would protect us
[1:47:00] by the word of god that's being preached
[1:47:03] and that you'll give us a chance to go
[1:47:04] up that statue of a perfect man lord
[1:47:07] to come to maturity lord where you can
[1:47:09] use even a sister and a brother
[1:47:12] not just a ministry sometimes we think
[1:47:14] it's just a ministry in the heads of the
[1:47:16] church no
[1:47:18] you want a full body
[1:47:21] and that's a body of believers
[1:47:23] lord someone that will come to church
[1:47:25] every sunday pay their tithe
[1:47:27] support the ministry
[1:47:29] and lord live a good christian life
[1:47:32] that may be their position
[1:47:33] we all can't be preachers we all can't
[1:47:35] be deacons we all can't be song leaders
[1:47:39] but lord we can fill a church up with
[1:47:40] the holy spirit
[1:47:42] we can bring our lick of fire
[1:47:44] let's not smut it over with the world
[1:47:47] but lord that it's been trimmed our
[1:47:48] lamps have been trimmed and they're
[1:47:50] burning bright
[1:47:52] and lord in this dark hour we need more
[1:47:54] lights
[1:47:55] and i thank you for giving us a church
[1:47:57] of people lord
[1:47:58] that have those lights and i pray lord
[1:48:00] the ones that don't i pray lord that you
[1:48:01] would stir their water
[1:48:04] lord we want to see everybody in this
[1:48:05] building filled with the holy ghost
[1:48:07] that's my desire i know that's been
[1:48:09] dad's desire for years and years and
[1:48:11] years
[1:48:12] but that doesn't do away with all our
[1:48:14] troubles
[1:48:15] but it sure does give us a way to
[1:48:19] handle them and
[1:48:22] go up that statue of a perfect man lord
[1:48:23] we're we'll have virtue
[1:48:25] we'll have the knowledge of god
[1:48:28] we'll have the temperance of god
[1:48:30] that one day you stood and platted a
[1:48:31] rope in a in a house because they were
[1:48:33] doing something that they weren't
[1:48:35] supposed to do in your house
[1:48:37] you said they've made it to den of
[1:48:38] thieves
[1:48:40] lord that's where we have to
[1:48:42] we have to have deacons
[1:48:44] we have to have elders in the church
[1:48:46] to keep the church clean
[1:48:50] that gives temperance
[1:48:51] and then patience lord
[1:48:53] that will all
[1:48:55] make it to the very end
[1:48:57] in godliness and brotherly kindness
[1:49:00] how to treat our brother even though the
[1:49:02] brother
[1:49:03] hates you
[1:49:05] or talks despiteful against you
[1:49:09] lord that's what we're looking at
[1:49:11] i'm not looking for a church that
[1:49:14] that shouts the roof off
[1:49:17] i'm looking for a church that's
[1:49:18] established
[1:49:20] settled
[1:49:21] and grounded in the word of god and then
[1:49:24] let that anointing strike
[1:49:27] you promised us that it would lord
[1:49:29] you said just for a moment i didn't get
[1:49:30] to read that lord but you said to your
[1:49:32] prophet just for a moment
[1:49:35] god will be on full display god will
[1:49:37] anoint a church then
[1:49:38] and will do in one year
[1:49:40] but the theologists have tried to do in
[1:49:42] 2000 years
[1:49:44] you said but it's happening right now
[1:49:48] lord
[1:49:50] we've seen in part
[1:49:53] but that which is perfect has come
[1:49:56] that which is in part to be done away
[1:49:58] with
[1:49:59] and that will come to lord to where we
[1:50:01] will come into speaking condition
[1:50:03] and speaking terms with you lord
[1:50:06] thank you for the people that you've
[1:50:07] given us father
[1:50:09] i pray now as we go into this solemn
[1:50:11] time of
[1:50:12] of communion lord they
[1:50:15] when you were in the upper room with the
[1:50:16] 12
[1:50:17] you knew one of them was the devil but
[1:50:19] you still washed his feet
[1:50:21] you still gave him
[1:50:22] communion
[1:50:24] you still
[1:50:26] loved him
[1:50:27] you called him friend even judas
[1:50:32] lord may we be that way
[1:50:36] may we love each person lord with the
[1:50:38] love of the lord
[1:50:39] and may as we take this communion that
[1:50:41] you'll
[1:50:42] that you'll strip all the vile things in
[1:50:44] our body away from us lord all the
[1:50:45] memory reason conscious effects and
[1:50:47] imagination this is contrary to you lord
[1:50:50] i pray that you are just right now
[1:50:53] lord just
[1:50:54] create a circumcision in our hearts
[1:50:57] that you'll take that part out
[1:51:00] and lord you're a master surgeon you
[1:51:01] know how to cut where it doesn't where
[1:51:03] it doesn't do any damage
[1:51:05] it'll heal right back over
[1:51:07] and we'll continue on as the body of
[1:51:09] christ
[1:51:10] forgive us of our sins lord in our many
[1:51:12] mistakes lord as we get into the
[1:51:13] furthermore this service
[1:51:15] just lord heal the ones that are sick
[1:51:16] lord if anybody needs healing in the
[1:51:18] building lord as we take communion lord
[1:51:20] may you heal their body
[1:51:22] because it was broken for us
[1:51:24] and then you gave your life at calvary
[1:51:26] so that you can come back into us
[1:51:29] and cover us by your blood
[1:51:31] just give us this daily bread today lord
[1:51:33] in jesus name we ask
[1:51:35] amen
[1:51:42] let's read in corinthians
[1:51:49] where paul gives us
[1:51:52] the commentary of what goes on
[1:51:55] he loves the lord
[1:51:58] just spying closer together that's all i
[1:52:00] ask us to do
[1:52:02] buying closer together doesn't matter
[1:52:03] what goes on what comes what comes what
[1:52:06] goes
[1:52:06] that we bind together
[1:52:11] first corinthians 11 verse 23 says for i
[1:52:13] have received of the lord that which
[1:52:15] also i delivered unto you that the lord
[1:52:16] jesus the same night in which he was
[1:52:18] betrayed took bread
[1:52:19] and when he had give thanks he break it
[1:52:21] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:52:23] is broken for you
[1:52:24] this dew
[1:52:26] in remembrance of me
[1:52:28] after the same manner he also took the
[1:52:30] cup and he sucked when he had stopped
[1:52:32] saying this cup is the new testament in
[1:52:34] my blood he's getting ready to institute
[1:52:36] a new testament
[1:52:38] in my blood not goat's blood or not the
[1:52:41] blood of of animals it'll be human blood
[1:52:44] the blood of god
[1:52:47] new testament in my blood this do you as
[1:52:49] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:52:50] me
[1:52:51] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:52:53] drink this cup you do show the lord's
[1:52:54] death till he comes
[1:52:56] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:52:59] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:53:00] unworthily
[1:53:02] shall be guilty of the blood body and
[1:53:03] blood of the lord see we can stop right
[1:53:05] there and we'll say well we're all
[1:53:06] unworthy brother we just can't do this
[1:53:08] you got to get through that
[1:53:11] you got to get through that
[1:53:12] just what i've been talking about you
[1:53:13] got to get through that if you're born
[1:53:15] again in your soul
[1:53:16] you're good
[1:53:19] and you may be walking in god getting
[1:53:21] ready to receive the new birth that's
[1:53:22] okay
[1:53:24] but not with unconfessed sins and like i
[1:53:26] said you know forgive me of my sins lord
[1:53:29] truly forgive me of and clean me out
[1:53:32] and keep me clean not just not just so i
[1:53:34] can not just two days well it's
[1:53:35] communion day so i gotta i gotta pray a
[1:53:37] little harder no
[1:53:39] that's probably not going to do you a
[1:53:40] lot of good
[1:53:41] okay
[1:53:43] as often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:53:45] this cup you do show the lord's death
[1:53:46] until he come wherefore whosoever shall
[1:53:49] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:53:50] lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:53:53] body and blood of the lord
[1:53:55] but let a man examine himself and that's
[1:53:57] what we did today i hope you were
[1:53:58] examining yourself
[1:54:01] examine yourself i i can't examine you
[1:54:03] you have to examine yourself
[1:54:05] right
[1:54:06] the lord can examine you through me
[1:54:09] but i can't you know we're just we're
[1:54:11] just we're judges we we judge everything
[1:54:14] cut you know cut the head off you know
[1:54:16] get rid of them that's what i was
[1:54:18] thinking a couple weeks ago thank
[1:54:19] goodness y'all didn't come around me
[1:54:22] i'm just and i'm not joking i'm just i
[1:54:24] got something on me and and i believe
[1:54:26] it's gone now but but you know what it
[1:54:28] didn't come from stay away from church
[1:54:32] it came from staying right here
[1:54:34] pressing the battle
[1:54:37] we're gonna win we're gonna lose some
[1:54:38] battles we're gonna fail
[1:54:39] but we're not gonna fall
[1:54:41] the war is already won
[1:54:46] you know he looked at gideon and gideon
[1:54:48] was so scared
[1:54:49] he was hiding
[1:54:52] he was hiding behind a well
[1:54:56] god didn't say now get in
[1:54:59] you got some work to do man he said no
[1:55:01] gideon you mighty man of valor come
[1:55:03] right here you got something you need
[1:55:04] right here in your hand i said he said
[1:55:05] let's go i haven't you had enough of
[1:55:07] them philistines getting that stuff off
[1:55:09] remember what was they were stealing
[1:55:10] stuff or taking stuff or something like
[1:55:11] that you know going on and he said
[1:55:13] aren't you he said i'm sick and tired
[1:55:15] god said you got what you need go do it
[1:55:18] and he and you know what he did
[1:55:20] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:55:22] and drink this cup of the lord and
[1:55:23] worldly shall be guilty of the body and
[1:55:24] blood of the lord but let a man examine
[1:55:26] himself
[1:55:27] and so let him eat of that blood and
[1:55:28] bread and drink of that cup that's what
[1:55:30] we've done we've examined ourselves
[1:55:31] today for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:55:33] unworthy he doesn't drink contamination
[1:55:35] to himself not discerning the lord's
[1:55:36] body
[1:55:38] that's the bride
[1:55:39] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:55:41] among you many sleep for if we would
[1:55:43] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:55:45] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:55:46] of the lord that we should not be
[1:55:48] condemned with the world wherefore my
[1:55:50] brethren when you come together to eat
[1:55:51] terry one for another and if any man
[1:55:53] hunger lady meet at home that you come
[1:55:55] out together unto condemnation and the
[1:55:56] rest will i set in order
[1:55:58] when i come when paul went back to the
[1:56:00] corinthians
[1:56:01] he said the rest will i set an order he
[1:56:03] was bringing everything the spiritual
[1:56:04] gifts and all the different things to
[1:56:06] the to the corinthians so let's bow our
[1:56:07] heads just for a moment have a silent
[1:56:09] prayer
[1:56:10] brother brown said pray for your pastor
[1:56:13] and he'll be praying for you
[1:56:23] lord thank you for what you give us
[1:56:25] now pray that you give us more lord
[1:56:28] then as our cup is filled up that are
[1:56:30] run over
[1:56:32] and we be so full of you lord that we'll
[1:56:33] get out of this place
[1:56:35] or just be with us in the furtherment of
[1:56:37] this
[1:56:37] institution that you give us call
[1:56:39] communion and foot washing lord and just
[1:56:40] be with us and may your may your holy
[1:56:42] spirit just bathe us all lord
[1:56:44] and give us lord a renewing of our
[1:56:46] spirit father
[1:56:47] the renewing of our mind lord that we
[1:56:49] keep our mind more on you lord
[1:56:52] than we have before
[1:56:53] forgive us of our sins lord and our
[1:56:55] faults bless our pastor lord and keep
[1:56:57] him strong
[1:56:58] jesus name we pray
[1:57:00] amen
[1:57:01] the bible said he took the bread and
[1:57:02] then he blessed it lord
[1:57:04] thank you for this bread it's been
[1:57:07] made by holy hands
[1:57:09] lord the world sometimes they they try
[1:57:11] to do things right but
[1:57:14] lord they buy the bread and don't know
[1:57:15] where it's made from but lord we know
[1:57:17] where this came from it was made just
[1:57:19] exactly the way you said lord now i pray
[1:57:21] that you sanctify it lord the
[1:57:22] nourishment of our body and lord to the
[1:57:24] nourishment of our spiritual life
[1:57:27] and that this communion lord will be a
[1:57:28] representation that we are
[1:57:30] your children and we are in the family
[1:57:33] of god and we're doing the things that
[1:57:34] we're supposed to do lord that you'll
[1:57:36] give us blessings in jesus name we pray
[1:57:38] amen
[1:57:40] you know god don't have to bless you if
[1:57:41] you're not in his word
[1:57:43] but you know what he does have to bless
[1:57:45] you if you're in his word
[1:57:47] because he's obligated brother brown
[1:57:48] said he's not obligated anything but his
[1:57:50] word
[1:57:51] that's what he's obligated to he's
[1:57:52] obligated to his word and nothing else
[1:57:55] so everybody getting the word of god
[1:57:57] we'll get some blessings
[1:58:02] many times we think that uh
[1:58:06] i think i'll just do this you know and
[1:58:08] god's gonna bless it
[1:58:09] be careful
[1:58:11] i'm gonna do this and god's gonna bless
[1:58:12] it no you ask god to bless it
[1:58:15] and please don't uh
[1:58:17] i had a brother one time that another
[1:58:19] church not from here
[1:58:21] he uh he said the lord
[1:58:23] wanted him to go to work on sunday
[1:58:27] so that he could send all that money for
[1:58:29] that day to the mission field
[1:58:36] yes what i thought
[1:58:39] god didn't tell you to work on sunday
[1:58:42] and it was a disaster
[1:58:45] by the time he got finished and realized
[1:58:47] it was a disaster
[1:58:50] he was a
[1:58:53] spiritually broke man
[1:58:58] but see remember he thought he was doing
[1:59:00] right to begin with
[1:59:01] he had a desire well listen we all have
[1:59:03] a desire
[1:59:04] to do more from mission work and do more
[1:59:06] for the people of god but you got to do
[1:59:09] it the right way you can't do it any way
[1:59:10] you want to do it
[1:59:13] if i decide i want to work on sunday
[1:59:15] it's cause i don't want to go to church
[1:59:17] hello
[1:59:20] and that's not what did god tell us that
[1:59:22] was the right way to go nope he didn't
[1:59:23] tell us that's the right way to go
[1:59:27] and i love him
[1:59:28] you know what i love
[1:59:33] i love when this thing comes back empty
[1:59:37] i love when that comes back empty i love
[1:59:40] when they have to go back there and fill
[1:59:41] up some more of these
[1:59:43] because that means people are taking
[1:59:44] communion
[1:59:45] to heavenly father thank you for this
[1:59:47] wine lord it's been prepared
[1:59:48] with holy hands lord and it's went
[1:59:50] through the process
[1:59:52] of fermentation and now it's lord it's
[1:59:54] it's it's come to a place that
[1:59:57] it can't get old
[1:59:59] lord it just keeps getting stronger and
[2:00:00] stronger and father may you become
[2:00:02] stronger and stronger to each one of us
[2:00:03] lord as we partake of this communion let
[2:00:05] it not be just a ritual
[2:00:07] but let it be something lord that you
[2:00:09] maybe many times we
[2:00:11] we think about what really is going on
[2:00:13] in that upper room lord so we kind of
[2:00:15] try to time travel back into the into
[2:00:18] that upper room and and be sitting there
[2:00:20] and watch
[2:00:21] you wash the disciples feed and watch
[2:00:23] you take this cup
[2:00:25] and watch you take the bread lord and
[2:00:26] just pass it around and said take this
[2:00:28] and eat it
[2:00:30] lord it's a symbol
[2:00:32] and lord we appreciate that symbol that
[2:00:33] you give us father we honor and praise
[2:00:35] your name for this that we can do lord
[2:00:38] we've seen people heal by just taking
[2:00:40] communion so i pray today if anybody has
[2:00:41] anything in there
[2:00:43] in their body i pray that you'd heal it
[2:00:45] today lord as we take this communion
[2:00:47] let the healing power of jehovah rapha
[2:00:50] take over today
[2:00:52] and heal his father give us faith lord
[2:00:55] to make it through lord
[2:00:56] just as we have faith that this wine
[2:00:59] will be real good when we take it lord
[2:01:01] because it represents the holy ghost
[2:01:03] which is real good
[2:01:05] all the time
[2:01:06] thank you lord in jesus name we ask
[2:01:10] amen
[2:01:16] come morning
[2:01:18] i walk
[2:01:20] by the river
[2:01:23] i'll rest near the ever
[2:01:27] green tree
[2:01:30] i'll carry
[2:01:33] my cross
[2:01:35] through the midnight
[2:01:38] that's our trials and tribulations
[2:01:41] we'll carry our cross
[2:01:44] for me
[2:01:46] sometimes i'm despised world hates us
[2:01:51] reject him
[2:01:54] and i
[2:01:55] question oh father
[2:01:59] how long
[2:02:02] then i take one
[2:02:05] more look
[2:02:07] at mount calvary
[2:02:10] and it gives me
[2:02:12] the strength to
[2:02:15] go on
[2:02:18] morning
[2:02:19] i'll walk
[2:02:21] by the river
[2:02:25] i'll rest near the ever
[2:02:29] green tree
[2:02:33] i'll carry
[2:02:35] my cross
[2:02:38] to the darkest hour
[2:02:40] but come morning
[2:02:41] come morning
[2:02:43] there's glory
[2:02:46] for me
[2:02:48] to me that's one of the most calming
[2:02:50] songs
[2:02:53] come morning
[2:02:55] i'll walk by the river
[2:02:58] it'll all be over we won't have to run
[2:03:02] we'll have to worry about going to work
[2:03:04] bills to pay
[2:03:07] we'll have to worry about trials and
[2:03:08] troubles
[2:03:11] you can really hear the water run then
[2:03:14] i mean you know you
[2:03:15] or me and brother danny in different
[2:03:17] ones who go fishing
[2:03:20] it's a calming effect when you get into
[2:03:22] that river
[2:03:23] and you know what it may be a rapids
[2:03:25] that's just roaring like you wouldn't
[2:03:26] believe but you know what it just calms
[2:03:29] you down
[2:03:31] because you know that water's doing its
[2:03:32] job
[2:03:33] and there's some fish in that water
[2:03:37] and there's some life in that water
[2:03:40] and that's a calming effect that's why
[2:03:43] you know brother branham said he said
[2:03:44] you find me he said you find a river you
[2:03:46] should you find the river of life down
[2:03:48] there and he said you'll find a cabin
[2:03:49] down there real close to it
[2:03:52] he said you'll be hearing me sing
[2:03:53] amazing grace
[2:03:56] what about a prophet of god that's going
[2:03:57] to be given more accola accolades than
[2:04:00] any prophet that's ever been on the face
[2:04:02] of the earth
[2:04:06] prophet church age messenger brings
[2:04:08] millions of people into into the into
[2:04:10] the kingdom of god
[2:04:12] brings a group of people his message
[2:04:14] will bring a group of people to a body
[2:04:16] change that no one has ever come to
[2:04:19] amen
[2:04:20] and he said lord give me a cabinet
[2:04:25] give me a cabin
[2:04:27] uh
[2:04:28] the lord's gonna say no
[2:04:30] i think i'll give you this mansion but
[2:04:31] if you want a cabin you have one
[2:04:34] but he just says lord just give me a
[2:04:36] cabin
[2:04:38] one time he said
[2:04:40] like david he said lord just let me be a
[2:04:42] doormat
[2:04:45] in the house of god just let me be
[2:04:46] something at the door that people wipe
[2:04:47] their feet on
[2:04:49] but they're going into the house of god
[2:04:50] it's something that i do
[2:04:53] a doormat's really important when it's
[2:04:55] muddy
[2:04:57] right
[2:04:58] doormat's real important
[2:05:00] when it's muddy or rainy you can wipe
[2:05:02] your feet off
[2:05:04] and go in the house so that's what
[2:05:06] brother brown was saying he said lord i
[2:05:07] don't care let them wipe their feet on
[2:05:09] me
[2:05:11] he said just let me be a part of it
[2:05:13] that same way with me and you listen
[2:05:15] everybody's not going to be
[2:05:17] preachers and deacons and elders

[2:06:41] the supper being ended the devil having
[2:06:42] now put in the heart of judas this
[2:06:44] carrot simon's son to betray him jesus
[2:06:46] knowing that the father had given all
[2:06:47] things into his hands and he was come
[2:06:48] from god and went to god
[2:06:50] he rises from supper supper and laid
[2:06:52] aside his garment and took a towel and
[2:06:54] girded himself
[2:06:56] after that he poured water into a basin
[2:06:58] and began to wash the disciples feet
[2:07:00] and to wipe them with the towel with he
[2:07:02] was girded
[2:07:05] i don't believe he washed judas's feet
[2:07:06] no different
[2:07:09] see if that's the same characteristic
[2:07:11] they never brother brown they said you
[2:07:12] never knew who he was in who his enemies
[2:07:14] were or who his friends were he treated
[2:07:16] them all the same and when i think of
[2:07:18] that i think of that man in that upper
[2:07:20] room called jesus christ knowing by
[2:07:23] discernment
[2:07:24] that that was the devil you read it
[2:07:26] right here devil now put in the heart of
[2:07:28] jesus cat
[2:07:30] yet he washed his feet just the same
[2:07:34] treats the sinner just as much the same
[2:07:36] as he does a child of god
[2:07:41] that's brotherly kindness
[2:07:43] he rises from supper and laid inside his
[2:07:44] garment took a towel and girded himself
[2:07:46] and after that he poured water into a
[2:07:47] basin and began to wash the disciples
[2:07:49] feet
[2:07:50] and the wipe them with the towel her
[2:07:51] with he was girded
[2:07:53] then cometh he to simon peter here's

[2:07:56] and peter said unto him lord do you wash
[2:07:58] my feet jesus said hmm what i do though
[2:08:00] i know it's not now
[2:08:03] but you're going to be the spokesman on
[2:08:04] the day of pentecost
[2:08:06] and you're going to understand what's
[2:08:07] going on
[2:08:10] but thou shalt know hereafter peter said
[2:08:12] unto him thou shalt never
[2:08:14] wash my feet
[2:08:16] jesus said uh if i wash thee not thou
[2:08:18] has no part with me
[2:08:20] wow that's true he didn't he didn't play

[2:08:27] to die the next day
[2:08:28] he didn't have time to do that he's a
[2:08:29] peter uh if i don't if you don't if i
[2:08:31] don't wash your feet you're done
[2:08:34] simon peter said lord not only my feet
[2:08:37] but also my hands and my head
[2:08:39] jesus said unto him he that is washed
[2:08:40] and he that's not saved to wash his feet
[2:08:42] but his clean ever whip and you are
[2:08:44] clean but not all
[2:08:45] for he knew who should betray him
[2:08:47] therefore he said ye are not all clean
[2:08:49] so after he had washed their feet and
[2:08:50] had taken his garment was set down again
[2:08:52] he said unto them
