[3:08] if you don't take him out you want to
[3:10] put him back so it you know we don't
[3:12] have to do that we know what it's all
[3:13] about all right then so let's just pray
[3:16] father we thank you for this day in your
[3:18] grace we pray that you'd bless each one

[3:35] never one of us we love you and we thank
[3:37] you and we commit it to you now in Jesus
[3:40] name Amen
[3:44] we've been reading from Jonah bringing a
[3:49] point of salvation alright but I will
[3:53] sacrifice unto thee with the voice of
[3:56] Thanksgiving I will play that that I
[4:00] have vowed salvation is of the Lord now
[4:04] that's the main point the reason we're
[4:06] using it and the Lord spoken to the fish
[4:09] and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry
[4:11] land all right
[4:13] he was delivered because that's what
[4:16] salvation means deliverance in all of
[4:20] the ways and using it okay we go to now
[4:22] we're not gonna get as much into but
[4:26] we're gonna we want to read this because
[4:28] it tells you the Old Testament way of
[4:33] what it is and see and then you you say
[4:37] well I can't find this back here well
[4:39] it'll come over in the New Testament and
[4:40] pick up and read and you go back okay so
[4:43] keep that thought in mind and and it'll
[4:45] it'll help you
[4:46] alright verse one I say the truth in
[4:49] Christ I lie not my conscience also
[4:52] bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost
[4:54] that I have great heaviness and
[4:57] continual sorrow in my heart for I could
[5:01] wish that myself were accursed from
[5:03] Christ for my brethren my kinsmen
[5:06] according to the flesh who are
[5:09] Israelites to whom pertaineth the
[5:11] adoption and the glory and the covenants
[5:13] and the giving of the law in the service
[5:16] of God and the promises now that was all
[5:19] to Israel all right now okay the
[5:26] worthies alike to whom this pertains the
[5:27] adoption time whose are the fathers and
[5:29] of whom as concerning the flesh Christ
[5:32] came who is over all God blessed forever
[5:36] amen not as though the Word of God hath
[5:40] taken none effect for they are not all
[5:43] Israel which are of
[5:46] Israel neither because they are the seed
[5:49] of Abraham are they all children but in
[5:54] Isaac shall thy seed be called that is
[5:58] they which are the children of the flesh
[6:01] these are not the children of God but
[6:05] the children of the promise are counted
[6:07] for the seed for this is the word of
[6:09] promise at this time when I come and
[6:12] Sarah shall have a son you may be seated
[6:15] Lord that is blessing to the reading
[6:17] brother Aaron may have to come and click
[6:20] the arrow on us a little you know I
[6:23] tried to run it this morning and get it
[6:27] and did do the fan on but we may have to
[6:29] have a little more than just a fan
[6:31] because this you know stuff you all
[6:34] right now as I said people are saying
[6:37] over and over we're talking about the
[6:40] word salvation salvation means
[6:44] deliverance all right so that we're not
[6:47] dealing with the new birth yet the
[6:51] born-again experience in the point of
[6:53] salvation we haven't gotten to that
[6:56] we're trying to go real slow to show you
[6:59] all the things of the Old Testament are
[7:02] types and shadows coming to the New
[7:06] Testament you know and and things taking
[7:09] place and I hope that you've listened to
[7:12] the point of what we've been saying and
[7:16] trying to bring out an example or a
[7:19] lineup to work that it would just go
[7:21] this way this way this way this way and
[7:23] then comes out to Christ so we read over
[7:26] you know today and pick it up in Romans
[7:30] that we'll get back to it a little bit
[7:32] in there thank you very in the services
[7:35] and just pray that my voice will hold
[7:37] out because that's been I've been
[7:39] coughing and having a problems with it
[7:41] but it'll be there all right
[7:43] but now we've been talking about the
[7:47] point of trying to bring out as I said
[7:50] what that happens the Bible says that
[7:52] the Old Testament was types and shadows
[7:54] right of the thing to come okay all
[7:57] right
[7:58] now if you watch what we were talking
[8:01] about in your order of events you may
[8:04] have to listen to many messages to find
[8:07] this lineup but the lineup I've been
[8:09] using is the basis that when Adam failed
[8:14] Adam first off was God's example child
[8:18] of what he wanted you know to to to be
[8:21] and all of us would have come that away
[8:24] had a fall not taking place all right
[8:26] but then the fall came into being and
[8:29] when it came into being God could not
[8:32] bring forth his children you know the
[8:35] way he wanted to so he had to revert to
[8:38] another way but did he's going to have
[8:41] his wheel that's gonna work out for his
[8:43] honor and glory everything will have to
[8:45] come to that part of it all right we see
[8:48] that Adam in his rebellion and the
[8:52] things through even Adam and the natural
[8:57] acts the took place there in the garden
[9:00] that it brought man as we talked about
[9:02] to a fall all right fallen condition
[9:05] okay now there was no sin there was no
[9:10] problems no nothing until man come into
[9:13] that situation - were the Adam as we
[9:16] talked about it and trying to bring it
[9:18] into the messages that Adam literally
[9:21] lost the right to the earth because the
[9:28] earth wasn't eternal Adams body was not
[9:31] eternal his soul was eternal but his
[9:34] body wasn't alright but then he lost the
[9:38] right of the earth okay
[9:41] now you said what is that related to us
[9:44] was you listening when we were trying to
[9:47] talk about that in losing the right of
[9:50] the earth that he literally lost our
[9:52] bodies because our bodies were laying in
[9:55] this earth right if not where to come
[9:59] from I mean it you know it's plain
[10:01] language but our bodies were in the
[10:03] earth and when Adam lost that he lost
[10:06] not only his Park that were he would
[10:10] have come to eternal life
[10:11] in flesh had he held on and then we were
[10:14] going to come into being had to seeing
[10:15] that happen but he lost it and when he
[10:19] did he made it to the basis that the
[10:23] world the Prophet said was cursed
[10:25] remember he didn't curse at him he
[10:27] didn't curse Eve he cursed the beasts
[10:29] put him on his belly he cursed the earth
[10:32] and thorns and thistles would come forth
[10:34] and as it would come forth it would be a
[10:38] horrible situation and you realize then
[10:41] our bodies was dire alright i've inside
[10:45] that over and over to you to think about
[10:47] our bodies were laying there in the
[10:49] earth in the elements alright and you
[10:53] said what I didn't I wasn't born from
[10:55] over there I was going to see you get
[10:58] stuff like that in your mind and you're
[10:59] not even listening spiritually so I'm
[11:02] glad the Prophet said it he said not
[11:05] necessary this I'm chemical you know the
[11:07] same gases excuse me but to simon
[11:10] chemicals alright sixteen elements you
[11:13] no matter where they come from and how
[11:14] long it took you to get here you realize
[11:18] our bodies didn't been in that for six
[11:21] thousand years and we think we're old
[11:24] now okay but the point we brought was
[11:30] what that God didn't leave it in that
[11:33] situation because in the genesis 3:15
[11:38] remember he says to Adam and Eve but the
[11:42] seed of the woman is going to come to
[11:45] take away these problems that you've
[11:48] created and the seed of the woman was
[11:50] the promise of Jesus Christ because the
[11:53] woman has no seed all right but it was
[11:56] the promise of Christ in other words I
[11:58] will come and I'll make a way and he did
[12:03] come down personally you know God came
[12:06] personally stripped the animals put the
[12:08] skins upon them and everything to make
[12:11] it to where he would pay the price
[12:14] speaking of the coming of the great
[12:17] Messiah all right now what I tried to
[12:21] get you to look at
[12:22] is to look at the Bible as like you're
[12:24] not just looking at it as you read it as
[12:27] a textbook or a thought but to look how
[12:30] this is in order
[12:31] this is in order this is it why would
[12:33] God do this why would he do this
[12:35] why would he do this you know why would
[12:39] he have the world in such a horrible
[12:41] condition and then he'd send a flood any
[12:48] cleanse and climbed the earth through
[12:51] the flood you realized that according to
[12:54] what it is a future home brother Branham
[12:56] says then your body's worth in the earth
[12:58] so then you were claimed Roth IRA the
[13:02] body you're living in today was claimed
[13:05] right dark alright
[13:07] blood dropped on it at Calvary bringing
[13:11] it further on alright but remember you
[13:15] know they could come under justification
[13:19] wiping off sweeping it away God wouldn't
[13:22] put it all into one thing is my point
[13:24] but if you'd look at it look at the fall
[13:28] look at as this goes down all right
[13:32] looks like no hopes but then you see it
[13:36] as it starts an upward turn raise your
[13:39] Bibles that way sometimes I asked you to
[13:43] read Genesis I mean you know I'm gonna
[13:45] ask for a raise of hands I mean he's
[13:47] done it but I ask you to read these
[13:49] things and see what takes place I tried
[13:54] to emphasize the point see that when you
[13:56] come to the flood with Noah he had a
[14:01] purpose we get the art we get two things
[14:04] and all like that but he cleanse and
[14:06] claims the earth he starts a process of
[14:11] salvation Redemption to bring back all
[14:15] right now he cleanse and claims it he
[14:20] brings it to a situation and said I will
[14:22] not destroy the world anymore because of
[14:29] mankind then in Genesis 9
[14:33] and he starts talking about not only the
[14:36] land I hope you followed the point that
[14:39] we was trying to brain watch it pick up
[14:42] a little bit
[14:42] land world people world cleanse cleansed
[14:46] all wiped out doing great the guard just
[14:50] didn't come back and say ok now Noah
[14:52] we're gonna give you the earth no we're
[14:54] gonna give you the Abraham we're gonna
[14:55] give you that was true it happened but
[14:59] that was not his point he's moving on so
[15:03] he moved on in Jonah I mean in in
[15:05] Genesis 9 about 7 & 8
[15:08] he said multiply and replenish the earth
[15:11] all right now then he starts talking to
[15:15] Noah about his seed nobody's seed he
[15:25] starts showing the plans coming back who
[15:30] that genesis 3:15 man is the seat of
[15:35] Almighty God right let's either the
[15:37] woman cuz she don't know see then he
[15:40] starts a promise not just just to find
[15:44] the world cuz that would deal in
[15:47] cleansing of the body but he starts
[15:50] talking about his seed he deals with
[15:55] Noah and his seed all right and as he
[16:02] deals with him about that he starts
[16:05] putting it into to higher order he
[16:07] starts bringing it more back toward not
[16:09] just the world now you picked up
[16:11] something and was he listening he picked
[16:14] up a seed to start talking about first
[16:18] it was just the world we couldn't we got
[16:21] into Abraham you remember it was land
[16:24] that he dealt with first promise of land
[16:28] but then he said now you're saved see
[16:33] showing you that it's coming back to a
[16:35] Redemption not only for the earth but
[16:40] for the genesis 3:15 man to come into
[16:43] being to bring us salvation
[16:49] of a seed that's what gets me you get
[16:55] all of these great message people and
[16:59] I'm sorry but they preach about all
[17:03] these seeds and you get it all in that
[17:04] light that was great message about that
[17:06] seed that seed comes in that seat comes
[17:08] in here let's see come through this
[17:09] woman let's see it come through destined
[17:11] and brought it right to take more and
[17:14] brother brother said it was adultery and
[17:22] he said of predestination seed can't
[17:23] come into adultery when we don't listen
[17:25] to that we just all great it was great
[17:29] message we enjoyed this and wonder what
[17:33] kind of seed are you talking about and
[17:38] watch see he told him said multiply and
[17:42] replenish the earth bring forth a
[17:47] literal seed through Noah but sit
[17:53] through that now I'm lining it up to
[17:57] work it's gonna come to words Christ and
[18:01] we read there in Romans that do the line
[18:03] of that that it would come out to Christ
[18:06] alright now we see then when he comes to
[18:10] Abram or Abraham and he starts dealing
[18:15] with Abraham and he deals with him as
[18:20] didn't land first I'll give you from
[18:23] this place to that place give you
[18:27] everywhere you said the sole of your
[18:28] foot then he says and unto thy seed I'm
[18:36] gonna give you a seed and they Brown
[18:39] says I don't even have one said the best
[18:45] I've got is fluid healers are or what
[18:48] isn't everyone's a guy's name he said
[18:50] the best I got is that feller I don't
[18:53] have nothing
[18:56] he said yeah but I'm gonna give you a
[18:58] seed you realize he was promising to
[19:03] give him the beginning of the seed of
[19:06] the woman
[19:07] I remember the seed of the woman is
[19:11] Jesus Christ
[19:11] she'll now follow me what we're talking
[19:15] about so he starts talking of something
[19:17] greater than land he starts talking to
[19:23] Abraham I'm greater than just uh
[19:25] children could he speaks to know about
[19:29] the children but he starts see we went
[19:33] down now you're supposed to be following
[19:37] me coming back up following it from the
[19:40] earth in its redemptive plan but seeing
[19:45] that we start then and see we move ahead
[19:48] of the earth you realized it when you
[19:56] receive that new birth we'll get to it
[19:58] later so you've moved away ahead of
[20:00] Abraham Noah had them you moved into a
[20:06] wonderful situation and you're no longer
[20:09] gonna be dealing with flesh you remember
[20:12] will reread this in a minute
[20:13] remember what it said in there about
[20:16] that flesh is not to be counted see
[20:22] that's over into the New Testament right
[20:24] it's bringing forth back dark he told
[20:28] him in Genesis 15 he said I'll give you
[20:33] the land from here desire to that in
[20:36] Genesis 15 is the one where we count the
[20:39] Covenant chapter and he speaks of a seed
[20:48] coming toward the fact of not just
[20:50] having children but toward the real true
[20:57] seed takes that man through many
[21:00] situations takes him through the land
[21:03] that he walks don't own a dab of it
[21:08] right but yet to God and him as far as
[21:12] that's concerned
[21:13] you'll never been at it because
[21:15] everywhere you put this over your foot
[21:16] I'm gonna give it to you
[21:18] that was what I told mother even about
[21:22] an unconditional covenant an
[21:25] unconditional covenant I've tried to
[21:27] preach it over and over and over to get
[21:29] you to think an unconditional covenant
[21:32] we think it means there's no condition
[21:34] whatsoever I hope you listen to that
[21:37] last message were the very people that
[21:40] God was talking about was into bondage
[21:43] because of their sin time and time again
[21:46] the children of Israel was put into
[21:48] bondage because of their sin if it's
[21:51] unconditional why did he do anything so
[21:54] it's not you can just get by do anything
[21:56] you won't do no the unconditional
[21:59] covenant i ended it up there the other
[22:00] day by finishing boy what the
[22:02] unconditional code that means God done
[22:05] it and he's going to keep it it's going
[22:10] to be his way that's unconditional you
[22:15] don't have enough to do your salvation
[22:17] except one time you got to believe it
[22:20] we'll never get tired of see I mean this
[22:23] today I started to say we do it this
[22:25] evening
[22:25] yeah we'll never get to our today where
[22:28] I'm headed but we'll take care of it
[22:30] later now listen he brings in a seed
[22:36] point he brings in two people now
[22:42] remember Adam was people you know and
[22:45] they fail right now he comes forth in
[22:53] Abram you know Genesis 17 and comes to
[23:02] the circumcision why does it come to
[23:05] circumcision
[23:10] why does it come to circumcision because
[23:16] it's coming up he's gonna cleanse this
[23:24] world with no one did now through
[23:28] Abraham he's gonna bring forth the seed
[23:32] and he's going when that seed gets here
[23:34] and he never went into that until Isaac
[23:37] came read your Bible
[23:41] then when Isaac went when God God got
[23:45] away from a lot I mean Abram got away
[23:48] from locked and God told him to then you
[23:52] started seeing God moving toward Abram
[23:55] and his covenant that he'd made back
[23:57] before them that he was gonna come
[24:00] through him you remember he told him he
[24:04] said when I don't even have nobody what
[24:08] can I do he said what you're gonna have
[24:10] a child Sarah is gonna be the mother and
[24:15] you're gonna have a child and said it's
[24:19] gonna be a seed and said it's gonna be a
[24:22] special one and said when he gets here
[24:26] you're circumcising now he's dealing
[24:31] with this flesh I know what circumcision
[24:35] means come on we gonna go get to it
[24:38] it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost right
[24:40] but is that not supposed to work back
[24:42] through this flesh he starts showing
[24:46] thou her that he's cleanse in the
[24:48] natural flesh the circumcision that's
[24:54] what I was trying to get you to say
[24:57] following God through the line then he
[25:01] talks when he gets it
[25:03] Isaac you remember even after Abraham we
[25:07] got his name change after all the things
[25:09] that happened he still said Lord said
[25:12] Lettie a small liver for you he said it
[25:16] was gonna be this out of the earth but
[25:18] said that a who I'm talking about
[25:20] the Isaac and he named him
[25:24] rayji scripture God named him and he
[25:27] said his name is Isaac and said he's
[25:30] going to be the promised son he realized
[25:36] then that God says it three times
[25:42] God says three times
[25:46] Genesis 22 and to take thy son not only
[25:52] son
[25:54] Genesis 22 and 12 not only son Genesis
[26:06] 22 and 16 and has not withheld thy son
[26:10] thine only son remember the words of the
[26:15] Prophet this is what if God says
[26:17] something like surely surely fair leave
[26:19] early listen because something is very
[26:22] important when you see a repeat it's a
[26:26] very important point and God Himself
[26:29] repeated three times if Abraham's son
[26:33] not only son because it would be the
[26:37] promised son coming to Isaac because
[26:43] that's what the scripture said it would
[26:44] be all right and as it would come to as
[26:48] ik he would bring in circumcision but no
[26:57] one and all of those children that
[27:02] Abraham was brought forth every one of
[27:05] those sons yet eleven according to the
[27:07] Prophet I know one time I can read quote
[27:10] to when Tommy says seven but twice he
[27:13] says eleven ain't argued and many times
[27:16] it might have been in the middle ain't
[27:18] gonna do it you argue them things he is
[27:20] dying listen to what the point the point
[27:24] was he had more than them two children
[27:30] and every one of them children you know
[27:33] they've all had to be serviced you'll
[27:35] never hear my preaching about the ISM
[27:37] will be
[27:37] circumcised you don't ever hear nobody
[27:39] the message preaching Hagar and the
[27:42] promise of brother branham bring a whole
[27:45] message about Hagar and says God heard
[27:49] her voice but don't know is Hagar that
[27:52] that's a bad thing that's out of it you
[27:56] don't listen in to your prophet that's
[27:57] what I mean but listen it was coming to
[28:04] a promised seed what it started at
[28:08] genesis 3:15 promised seed now you
[28:15] seemed this taken and bringing Isaac as
[28:17] the promised seed hey I've got the quote
[28:22] slain you so don't worry about it but
[28:25] one said the world thinks that the
[28:27] promised seed was Isaac he said that was
[28:30] the natural he said the spiritual
[28:33] promised seed was Jesus Christ come on
[28:37] don't get all out into the wild lands
[28:40] with you well he don't know what he's
[28:41] talking about
[28:42] that's why I say them things because out
[28:44] there you never know who's listening and
[28:46] what's going on that's why we put these
[28:48] notes on the internet where at least
[28:51] they can read it even if I don't read it
[28:53] to you but listen Abraham then was told
[29:00] my son not only son
[29:07] it wasn't the others the children of
[29:09] Abraham Isaac what he saw was there was
[29:14] about seven more or a more 10 more I
[29:16] mean he wanted put in there are the
[29:19] children of Abraham but none of them got
[29:23] counted because God had already said a
[29:27] small she'll be the promised son
[29:33] naturally a small was God's chosen son
[29:42] it turned out sitting highs in Isaac
[29:47] shall thy seed be called
[29:53] listen God speaks and when it says in
[29:57] Isaac shall thy seed be called let's
[30:00] retail okay let's just read Romans nine
[30:05] over again
[30:06] whether they get these up or whatever
[30:08] it's okay we can go Romans nine those
[30:16] are the fathers of whom as concerning
[30:18] the flesh Christ came and who is over
[30:22] all God blessed forever amen
[30:25] not as though the Word of God had taken
[30:29] none effect for they are not all Israel
[30:33] which are Israel nepal's explaining
[30:42] Hebrew had that Abraham had more than
[30:46] just one or two kids and all Israel is
[30:51] not integral thinking everyone say a
[30:54] small right over that right now everyday
[30:58] right in the sound of all Jerusalem in
[31:01] the city the horn is proclaiming Oh God
[31:07] and each small was his son get sister
[31:14] Barbara talked to her husband explain me
[31:20] they say a small was the one that
[31:26] Abraham took up to be crucified God he's
[31:33] the son of Abraham but according to the
[31:38] Bible according to God he's not because
[31:41] you're not even looking at natural seed
[31:43] you're looking at the promise
[31:46] not as though God hath taken none of it
[31:48] they are not all Israel neither because
[31:50] they are the seed of Abraham
[31:51] this one neither because they are the
[31:57] seed of Abraham are the old children but
[32:00] in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[32:05] these narrowing it down because this is
[32:07] the New Testament writing of the Old
[32:09] Testament okay that is they which are
[32:13] the children of the flesh
[32:17] these are not the children of God but
[32:22] the children of the promise are counted
[32:25] for the seed for this is the word of
[32:32] promise at this time I'll come and Sarah
[32:34] she'll have a son listen church I know
[32:40] you don't like me being sarcastic but
[32:43] you tell me it's not the truth I knew
[32:46] them Scriptures is that in the Baptist
[32:49] Church we had a saying all Israel's not
[32:54] Israel with all Jews or Jews you ever
[33:00] heard that one that was a saying through
[33:02] the Baptist in time
[33:04] see all this realize they knew all their
[33:06] lives wouldn't cousin you eat smoke and
[33:09] then you had more sons but Jew means
[33:13] God's chosen and it ain't even dealing
[33:16] with Abraham it's coming through Judah
[33:19] see all the Israel's not Israel but all
[33:26] Jews are God's chosen we do that back
[33:32] then what's matter now what's the
[33:36] problem with understanding that all of
[33:39] that back there was to bring down till
[33:41] we could understand how that we could be
[33:45] of the seat of Abraham and it we're not
[33:50] of the seed of Abraham
[33:51] we have no salvation oh wait a minute
[33:55] now okay you want
[33:59] the promised natural come through Isaac
[34:06] Abraham to Isaac to Jacob Jacob's
[34:09] changed to Israel the 12 patriarchs
[34:13] comes out of Jacob this changed to
[34:16] Israel plenty of the leanings down
[34:20] through that comes right on down and
[34:23] comes down as I said the other day to
[34:25] Christ in that lineage on you it back
[34:28] then see go we could read the Lee needs
[34:31] come to Joseph not to Mary because you
[34:36] had no lineage of the women but Joseph
[34:39] was not the father of Jesus or at least
[34:44] how that lets you to understand it but
[34:47] the promisee back tyre was to walk he
[34:51] promised Abraham that through his seed
[34:55] now listen I made a promise with you in
[35:00] the beginning when I first started
[35:03] smoking Abraham and said now I'm telling
[35:07] you
[35:08] Isaac's gonna be that child not each
[35:11] more know anything helps cut him a hold
[35:14] it the one gonna be one seed you
[35:23] remember how I made that statement now
[35:24] many of you believed it the Covenant was
[35:29] never made with everybody it was made
[35:32] with Abraham and his seed after him so
[35:38] you better start wanting some way or
[35:41] connection whatsoever somewhere down the
[35:44] line to have a little bit of link toward
[35:46] Abraham because there is no covenant he
[35:52] didn't make a covenant with everybody in
[35:54] the world he didn't even make the
[35:56] covenant with all of Abraham's literal
[35:59] seed that was the point he made it with
[36:02] Isaac
[36:08] because it would come down to speaking
[36:10] of Jesus Christ
[36:15] how are you listening you should be
[36:19] understanding that what it done when
[36:21] when it fell and went down you started
[36:24] coming back the land comes back
[36:26] promising but then he starts talking
[36:29] about a seed then he starts specifying
[36:35] that seed then when that seed falls on
[36:39] the line and he comes forth which was
[36:42] Isaac he circumcised him he small s get
[36:47] circumcised - Abraham had to get
[36:49] circumcised - started coming towards
[36:55] this human part of you and I are you
[37:01] listening coming towards this human part
[37:03] that we are we can see our bodies come
[37:06] from the earth fine but there's got to
[37:07] be some redemptive to form to deal with
[37:10] you and I yeah we're a lot of hands
[37:16] don't blame your called we're not Jews
[37:21] and he this is you in would believe it
[37:23] wanna see
[37:24] I mean outwardly what the Jews had you
[37:25] in word it C as rulers not outwardly not
[37:28] just one see inwardly gotta be by the
[37:31] new birth the only way you and how I
[37:34] ever be worth anything but remember it
[37:37] had to be right back here so how
[37:41] wonderful it was when he just kept
[37:44] unfolding his story to Abraham in what
[37:48] he would do turn him back to a young man
[37:52] before Isaac could come on the scene for
[38:00] any promise could be made
[38:01] I kept but he said I done told you back
[38:04] you're not gonna do it
[38:05] he said now I'm gonna do it he said you
[38:08] don't get in trouble you gonna have
[38:10] problems and said your lineage is only
[38:12] even gonna be told him to start with it
[38:14] 6:15 chapters you he said your lineage
[38:17] is gonna be your peoples gonna be an
[38:18] agent for 400 errors I said don't
[38:22] you worry about it doesn't made my
[38:23] covenant I'll go get him I'll bring him
[38:26] out
[38:29] coming back two words of promise coming
[38:33] to Isaac one seed and Isaac speaks of
[38:37] Christ because in Genesis coming in
[38:41] Galatians 3:16 not unto thy seeds as of
[38:46] many but as unto thy seed which is
[38:48] Christ and had been no Isaac and a
[38:53] promise I'm trying to get you up to a
[38:57] point looking at something that dark in
[38:59] Abraham God started making it - showing
[39:05] you it was going to be the seat of
[39:07] promise not all of his descendants but
[39:14] the seat of promise was gonna fall in
[39:16] Isaac and did he top Christ and then the
[39:21] seat of promise would come into being
[39:23] you better hope you can get related in
[39:25] some way to the seat of promise you can
[39:30] argue all you won't do a brush there's
[39:32] like you know say but the guy that
[39:35] didn't want to Theron boy truth a boy
[39:36] ain't gonna take that you know know me
[39:40] because I got to raise up children to
[39:42] that harlot over there that won't endure
[39:46] that's dirty dog does that Gentile you
[39:49] know what he rejected that boy said I'll
[39:53] take it
[39:54] and from there came Christ what if that
[40:02] guy had a cookie beautiful but he didn't
[40:08] garden you and you don't do it okay I
[40:09] love that
[40:11] but Abraham had many sons but only one
[40:16] son listen one son of promise they come
[40:23] through Sabra
[40:29] no Sara had one son Isaac there was
[40:38] nothing else promised now Abraham had
[40:45] many kids running around he had a whole
[40:49] bunch of kids running around in the yard
[40:52] but that had nothing to do with it
[40:55] God was waiting on Isaac to come into
[40:58] being he had to turn his body back
[41:01] before he could do it then he brought
[41:04] Isaac brings Isaac up circumcised he
[41:08] gets him up so far some were 13 years
[41:11] old whatever close whatever time you
[41:14] want to make and God says take my son
[41:17] down only so not children kill him now
[41:23] watch this because we're gonna we're not
[41:25] gonna get to it but remember I'll ask
[41:30] you a question you remember the last
[41:33] message when we asked why did God choose
[41:37] Abraham you remember that
[41:45] why did he choose Abraham why did
[41:53] choose you remember that last manager
[41:56] why'd you choose you
[42:00] well I predestination that's just
[42:03] confusing to me I agree because you
[42:05] don't understand it
[42:09] God had a reason to choose Abraham or he
[42:12] wouldn't have chose him and I like to
[42:16] weigh the profit I gave you the quote
[42:17] where the Prophet said I know Abraham
[42:21] will raise his children and he knew that
[42:30] before the foundation of the world in it
[42:34] come on did God just look down over time
[42:38] and say I'll take that one I'll take
[42:39] that one he said what but brother daily
[42:45] you get it to Jacob and Esau you know
[42:48] well here's your answer which you don't
[42:51] even realize your answer condemns your
[42:53] answer condemns your questions and talks
[42:58] because the Bible said Jacob have I
[43:01] loved and Esau have I hated
[43:03] before either one of them was even born
[43:09] now I can adjust God do that now you
[43:15] answered it just now what you said
[43:18] garden you what Jacob would do and God
[43:22] knew what he saw would do right now you
[43:25] just condemned your own self put your
[43:28] own self out in the open
[43:30] she ain't got nowhere to hide with it so
[43:32] what do you mean
[43:33] I mean God you say does he pick it's
[43:37] huge
[43:37] no he would did everybody be saved but
[43:43] he knows who'll accept him if you don't
[43:47] get nothing out of this you get this one
[43:50] thought in your mind for the later on
[43:55] four times the Bible says
[44:01] abraham believed God and it was imputed
[44:05] or counted or reckoned unto him for
[44:11] salvation our righteousness and may I
[44:16] say it this way what is righteousness
[44:25] what is righteousness according to the
[44:30] Scriptures we just quoted it was Abraham
[44:35] believing God now you won't make
[44:38] anything else they believed God and it
[44:42] was imputed unto him do you believe God
[44:47] or do you believe in God or bow to God
[44:54] or you believe God four times the Bible
[44:58] said abraham believed this will be in
[45:03] the message for later what is the seed
[45:05] of Abraham the ability of a man to
[45:13] believe God is the seed of Abraham what
[45:26] is all of this great seed is everybody's
[45:28] born with you no one talking about you
[45:31] know how the people of the message
[45:32] preached in it you mean brother Dale
[45:36] you're telling me that it's not some
[45:38] kind of a seed I'm telling you what your
[45:40] prophet said it is the ability to
[45:43] believe God that is the only seed God
[45:47] has do what you want to you're not
[45:51] listening anyway listen Abraham was not
[46:01] concerned about all of his children oh
[46:06] yeah he want them all to be good and
[46:08] doing everything I'm sure God he's he's
[46:10] a father don't misunderstand
[46:13] but he was trying to find the promise
[46:18] the promise was in Isaac see but ran him
[46:23] on the message Israel in the church
[46:24] Abraham had eleven sons you know but
[46:27] only one of them was the promise drew
[46:32] Isaac
[46:34] now listen only one of them through
[46:38] Isaac that's the reason Paul said in
[46:42] Romans the night chapter that all Israel
[46:46] are not Israel but through Isaac shall
[46:53] thy seed be called
[46:55] and then God through Isaac representing
[46:59] Christ what about it
[47:06] Abraham had many sons Joe vajura 61 but
[47:12] the Promised One was through Isaac and
[47:15] through Isaac came Christ the Royal seed
[47:19] the real seed of Abraham are you
[47:30] listening but the promise was through
[47:33] Isaac and through Isaac came Christ the
[47:38] Royal seed the real seed of Abraham what
[47:45] is the seed of Abraham it's Jesus Christ
[47:50] how can you be the seat of a brown by a
[47:53] new birth but Jesus Christ sees not air
[47:56] were too short 1965 sister Sarah written
[48:04] that there would be a son born and
[48:06] through this son the world would be
[48:08] blessed all nations would be blessed of
[48:11] the Sun and it's commonly believed
[48:14] especially among the Jews that this was
[48:18] Isaac but it wasn't this promised son of
[48:22] Abraham is Jesus
[48:25] and he is the Royal seed the promise of
[48:30] Abraham Abraham having two sons you know
[48:36] he's talking about if smoke goes one way
[48:38] no Israel in the church but in Isaac was
[48:45] his seed called here is the results of
[48:49] Abraham's seed Jesus Christ is Abraham's
[48:54] seed that we being dead in Christ take
[48:58] on Abraham's seed and her heirs
[49:00] according to the promise
[49:04] what about it
[49:07] so you don't have a dash of your the
[49:11] seed one one seed not seeds but one seed
[49:16] these others were not seed of Abraham
[49:21] this one because Abraham's seed was the
[49:28] face seed that God was speaking of and
[49:32] not the natural seed he wasn't speaking
[49:39] of a natural seed there was a natural
[49:41] Steve Darcis okay
[49:43] listen the faith seed that God was
[49:48] speaking of and not his natural
[49:50] Abraham's seed he was Abraham's seed one
[49:53] and that was Abraham's faith seed
[49:57] pointing to the royal seed that was to
[50:00] come through Abraham's faith now
[50:03] Abraham's natural life but Abraham's
[50:06] spiritual life what about
[50:19] Steve Donaire with a shot they can pull
[50:21] these we won't do 12 if you're catching
[50:23] up with me now you see Mary through Mary
[50:29] not through sex with through faith
[50:33] something exactly like Marie was not
[50:37] that seed Marie was a carrier of the
[50:41] seat he was a genuine faith seed because
[50:46] the Word of God is by faith that he give
[50:50] to Abraham and only faith can produce
[50:54] what God said he'd do faith in his word
[51:01] modern events made clear by prophecy now
[51:04] we're supposed to be this royal seed of
[51:06] Abraham Isaac was the natural seed but
[51:09] the faith seed is the faith in the
[51:11] promise word the promise word don't miss
[51:15] it
[51:15] he said don't miss it was that royal
[51:19] seed that was the seed Abraham's faith
[51:22] and we being dead in Christ become the
[51:25] seed of Abraham what seed was God
[51:29] looking at and thy seed shall possess
[51:32] the gate of the enemy but then come the
[51:35] real faith seed the royal seed of
[51:37] Abraham Jesus a promise
[51:40] Abraham had Isaac fruit after the flesh
[51:43] but the real seed wasn't in that
[51:46] organization system it was in that
[51:48] promise of God's Word
[51:53] that he would make him a father of
[51:55] Nations not through Isaac but through
[51:59] the Royal you'll see Jesus that was the
[52:01] royal seed which actually the seed of
[52:03] Abraham Jesus was not a Jew nay there
[52:06] was a Gentile he was Almighty God spoken
[52:12] words original seed helis Christ the
[52:15] seed of Abraham not in his so much in
[52:20] his body cause Isaac that seed of Isaac
[52:23] finally fell and died it backslidden
[52:26] hybrid
[52:28] then what he can't talk straight then he
[52:32] said Isaac and finally fell and died and
[52:35] it backslidden hybrid we'll get to it he
[52:39] said see but the seed of Abraham now
[52:43] listen that he believed God's Word
[52:48] regardless of what the circumstances was
[52:52] what is the place seed of Abraham
[52:55] I just read it the faith seed of Abraham
[53:00] was to believe God's Word
[53:04] well what you mean brother I believe the
[53:06] word do you believe it like Abraham do
[53:13] you believe it's strong enough to take
[53:14] your son out on the hill and kill him oh
[53:20] that's pretty rough in what is the seed
[53:27] of Abraham what was that seed that Isaac
[53:31] only spoke of the Word of God the seed
[53:39] of Abraham what was it not Abraham's
[53:43] body but Abraham's faith Abraham's faith
[53:47] in what the Word of God no matter what
[53:51] come he called anything contrary though
[53:54] there's no it wasn't what is the seed of
[54:00] Abraham as I said now he's back there
[54:07] coming it went down physically Worrell
[54:10] mankind everything promise or the
[54:13] wrought the seed to come the royal seed
[54:15] which would be Christ right genesis 3:15
[54:19] all right you see Noah starts washing
[54:22] the earth he's getting it ready but he
[54:28] steps up higher to Noah and says no
[54:30] enough multiply and replenish the earth
[54:36] of course you know what our minds
[54:37] stopped right there and many of you stop
[54:40] multiply replenish
[54:42] what did that replenish mean
[54:53] go look it up when plain common sense it
[54:58] simply means go and bring forth not that
[55:06] something was back over there
[55:09] go and bring forth the earth not to
[55:17] replenish it of course at that time you
[55:20] had people but you don't know what I'm
[55:24] talking about
[55:24] there's doctrines that there was people
[55:26] before Adam and Eve and that's where
[55:30] they used that hmm my Bible solves it
[55:35] one problem I mean one statement
[55:37] he's the mother of all living forget it
[55:41] he faced a man on Mars today if there's
[55:44] a monkey apart looking like this and
[55:46] twisting it around that away some kind
[55:48] of something he come from here you know
[55:51] me and my ways don't tell me about all
[55:54] these extra rest girl beings if there is
[56:00] somebody out there he needs salvation he
[56:03] needs a gospel preached to him but he
[56:08] had to come from here because my Bible
[56:10] says Eve is the mother of all living
[56:14] so whatever monkeys is out there come
[56:17] from here see I'm just playing I'm sorry
[56:21] but being playing is blunt you don't
[56:24] have to worry about worth staying but
[56:25] what is Abraham's faith seed is to
[56:29] believe God's work four times they said
[56:38] four times he says in Genesis 15 and 6
[56:44] and he believed in the Lord and he
[56:47] counted it to him for righteousness
[56:51] romans 4 1 for what saith the scripture
[56:55] abraham believed God and it was counted
[56:58] unto him for righteousness
[57:00] glassing 3 and 6 even as abraham
[57:03] believed God and it was accounted to him
[57:05] for righteousness
[57:07] jain's 3 in James 2 in 23 and the
[57:10] scripture was concluded which saith
[57:12] abraham believed God and it was imputed
[57:15] unto him righteousness and he was called
[57:19] the friend of God you want to be the
[57:23] friend of God
[57:24] I think I do believe his word that my
[57:37] friends was what made God come from
[57:39] glory because he had a man that would
[57:46] believe him nobody else in the world
[57:51] would believe him
[57:53] that's why I chose Abraham he chose you
[57:58] for the foundation of the world God he
[58:00] knew what he'd do right he knew Abraham
[58:04] would believe him so before the world
[58:06] ever begun he already predestinated
[58:08] Abram Abraham to come forth and to bring
[58:17] that seed Isaac into being and believe
[58:22] that God was gonna get him a child we
[58:25] didn't have none you know no children
[58:34] say I got ahold of it and really messed
[58:36] it up didn't she
[58:37] not even a small hill never turned out
[58:43] to be anything wasn't even accounted in
[58:45] the Bible as a son of a God of Abraham
[58:51] what are you getting at getting at one
[58:54] time as that went down the word he's
[59:02] coming back he came back through door
[59:07] washing the earth your body was there
[59:13] picks up an Abraham and he circumcised
[59:17] that body the meaning is going to retain
[59:23] the body circumcision I know what it
[59:27] means I know we'll get to certain
[59:29] overseas at the top of the baptismal ago
[59:31] this is the man to whom God will not
[59:33] impute sin and may I quote brother
[59:35] Branham you know what he said about that
[59:37] he said you can't impute sin over the
[59:41] token no the only man that qualifies
[59:46] that his sins are not imputed is it
[59:48] person that's got your token see to
[59:54] believe God I studied in the Baptist
[59:59] Church and I thought that's just a plain
[1:00:02] old human man I remember it so well
[1:00:06] thinking about Abraham and why would God
[1:00:08] choose him I didn't know your prophets
[1:00:11] message to have any answers I knew God
[1:00:16] loved Abraham for some reason and God
[1:00:19] picked him above all the others chose
[1:00:24] him above everybody in the world and
[1:00:26] made a covenant with him and then to be
[1:00:30] with his seed after him
[1:00:33] Dishman disqualified Eastman's the seed
[1:00:39] but he's disqualified all he gets is a
[1:00:40] natural blessings you remember he saw an
[1:00:47] Jacob number one yeah
[1:00:50] he blessed Jacob when Esau comes in find
[1:00:55] out what went wrong
[1:00:56] what'd he do look at it look at the
[1:00:58] human being what he saw say he said
[1:01:03] father you give him the blessing said he
[1:01:08] stole the birthright he said now you get
[1:01:10] in the blessing and is there not
[1:01:12] something for me read your Bible
[1:01:20] Jacob turns around to him and he's lazy
[1:01:23] and don't even he said you'll be a great
[1:01:25] nation Kings will come out of you
[1:01:29] that's all he's holding the Esau wanted
[1:01:36] some lineage of some form Jacob wanted
[1:01:41] the birth not which would be the baptism
[1:01:46] when all that goes right see we'll get
[1:01:49] to those times but he's getting you to
[1:01:51] think about it I don't want to end this
[1:01:52] part of a man in the Old Testament all
[1:01:58] that God would do and say about him and
[1:02:01] he says he's my friend but he's called
[1:02:05] him imputed unto him for righteousness
[1:02:09] he's called a friend of God he believed
[1:02:19] God
[1:02:23] that's yours listen why can't you think
[1:02:25] about it a little what church did you
[1:02:30] come out of what do you do this or
[1:02:31] better do it why can't you think a
[1:02:33] little bit there's something about you
[1:02:41] believing can we get into the scriptures
[1:02:46] you know style evening he that believeth
[1:02:49] in this baptized
[1:02:50] she'll be saved they don't say he this
[1:02:53] baptized he said he that believeth and
[1:02:57] is baptized look at all of the
[1:03:03] scriptures as they come into view from a
[1:03:07] man of Abraham's caliber all it was he
[1:03:12] believed God he that cometh to God what
[1:03:17] does the scripture say must believe that
[1:03:19] he is a rewarder of them that diligently
[1:03:22] seek Him what a wonderful thing
[1:03:27] how's the ability to believe am i
[1:03:34] quoting your prophet he said a lot of
[1:03:35] people can't believe packin people can't
[1:03:39] believe what you tell them that this
[1:03:40] message
[1:03:44] why then we all when we heard it we went
[1:03:49] oh no we don't believe that but then
[1:03:54] after a while it just come in we found
[1:03:58] that we couldn't believe nothing else
[1:04:01] how come people don't want to believe
[1:04:03] you when you start talking about it now
[1:04:09] you know this is true you finds you
[1:04:12] about a 50 60 year-old man a woman and
[1:04:15] you start talking to him about one true
[1:04:18] and living God and this is what they'll
[1:04:21] say in the conversation they'll say you
[1:04:26] mean to tell me do you believe my momma
[1:04:28] and daddy wouldn't say you ain't mention
[1:04:31] Mama and Daddy you ain't said a word
[1:04:34] about mom and dad
[1:04:35] right you ain't called mom and daddy's
[1:04:38] name you ain't done nothing why would I
[1:04:40] do that
[1:04:42] you mean to tell me that my mom my dad
[1:04:44] is not saved because you see they know
[1:04:51] you just said something that mama and
[1:04:53] daddy didn't believe it that way not if
[1:05:01] you used any word about mom and dad
[1:05:04] right there's only one seed that I ever
[1:05:12] won't have anything to do with now you
[1:05:19] forgive me I'm blind but you tell me
[1:05:23] that's the truth I don't have to be born
[1:05:26] this or born to add or kinfolks to this
[1:05:28] can't voc's of that and invite you all
[1:05:30] night you know people say well we got a
[1:05:35] good lineage down through there he's
[1:05:37] like I told him one time they said we we
[1:05:39] got a good lineage you know cuz our
[1:05:41] people come over in the Mayflower I said
[1:05:43] there wasn't nothing but a bunch of
[1:05:44] crooks come over to my flower so your
[1:05:46] mama admit your mom and daddys crooks
[1:05:49] right they didn't send the best over
[1:05:52] here
[1:05:55] there's been a bunch of garbage can
[1:05:57] I told him I said you run a line back on
[1:06:02] my family you might not find too many of
[1:06:06] them hanging by the tail
[1:06:07] but you probably run into finding a good
[1:06:10] many of them hanging by the neck because
[1:06:14] they were crooks he said well my family
[1:06:21] come over on the Mayflower
[1:06:22] what were your news in the back what
[1:06:26] good does that do
[1:06:28] you're trying to make some leash out of
[1:06:32] it
[1:06:32] and that's what that old you said when
[1:06:38] when Boaz said redeem your right
[1:06:42] he said raise your Bible the kinsman he
[1:06:46] said I will redeem my rock raise your
[1:06:49] Bible when boys said redeem me right
[1:06:54] he said I'll redeem my right Boaz said
[1:06:59] but now sir let's talk about this little
[1:07:01] bit no I said now when you take that
[1:07:04] naomi did remember you got to take Ruth
[1:07:11] and since she's a Gentile and she's your
[1:07:14] first child it comes from you and now
[1:07:16] are you and Ruth he's got to be put back
[1:07:19] to the man's name because it was the law
[1:07:22] he said ain't having nothing to do with
[1:07:24] it you can have it he was willing to
[1:07:27] give it to him he's willing for him to
[1:07:29] take anything he didn't want no problem
[1:07:33] what about you and me Oh but my family's
[1:07:38] a good family praise God that's fine
[1:07:43] they don't like him saved salvation is
[1:07:49] of the Lord thought of any thing we do
[1:07:52] or don't do and your salvation whether
[1:07:56] you believe it or not they'll get back
[1:07:58] to more of it
[1:07:59] ministry it will have to be from
[1:08:02] somebody that can do what Abraham did
[1:08:08] they could believe God no matter what
[1:08:14] went wrong
[1:08:18] yeah but you don't understand brother
[1:08:19] Dale I I've done this i went you have
[1:08:21] not done that and the Lord filled me and
[1:08:23] he done I'll praise God but do you
[1:08:29] believe God now come on musician do you
[1:08:37] believe God now because Abraham seed is
[1:08:41] a face that and it's to believe God God
[1:08:46] said it four times
[1:08:51] did he believed God and it was imputed
[1:08:53] unto him for righteousness
[1:08:55] if you won't have anything to do with
[1:08:57] righteousness believe God you can go
[1:09:01] down no Rogerson no other way but I
[1:09:03] don't do this and I don't do that that
[1:09:06] is flesh the only thing I want is a
[1:09:13] faith seed that's all I've asked all of
[1:09:19] these seed doctrine people where is that
[1:09:23] seed in you is it in your body in your
[1:09:27] spirit any soul or is it at all I've
[1:09:34] ever stood is on one time abraham
[1:09:37] believed God I believe him and he
[1:09:41] promised me that he started to work and
[1:09:44] he wouldn't stop it I don't put it on
[1:09:49] the fact that I've even seen him at 11
[1:09:50] years old I put it on the fact that what
[1:09:52] I can believe him or not
[1:10:00] may I put it in this point for you to
[1:10:05] believe that you're healed
[1:10:06] there's got to be a PI stench point am i
[1:10:10] right
[1:10:11] did you believe it's already finished
[1:10:15] now I believe in God's gonna heal you
[1:10:18] he's already done it
[1:10:19] now that's believing God to believe God
[1:10:22] will do it is believing in God that's
[1:10:28] not the faith of Abraham the faith of
[1:10:31] Abraham believes God no matter what even
[1:10:33] God does God told him to take his son up
[1:10:38] and kill him now look at the faith of
[1:10:43] Abraham walking up that hill curing that
[1:10:47] knife and his son says daddy said we got
[1:10:50] the fire we got the wood we got the
[1:10:54] knife the worse the sacrifice you can
[1:11:00] get people to realize what that
[1:11:02] scripture he just said Abraham later
[1:11:05] statement he said God will provide we're
[1:11:14] talking about the lamb no God will
[1:11:17] provide for himself God Himself is going
[1:11:24] to provide because God's going to be the
[1:11:26] sacrifice now you getting it right God
[1:11:30] Himself will be my sacrifice in other
[1:11:34] words he said Isaac God promised me for
[1:11:39] you that would be a lineage it would
[1:11:42] come instead Isaac how can God lie he
[1:11:49] that's not written in the Bible
[1:11:50] yesterday all that's written in the
[1:11:51] Bible they pick up some wood they're
[1:11:53] going up the hill and Isaac asking now I
[1:11:57] got more confidence in my kids and my
[1:12:00] grandkids great-grandkids can't you
[1:12:06] understand probably the whole journey
[1:12:11] Abraham was trying to describe Jehovah
[1:12:14] Jireh to Isaac he got the word you got
[1:12:21] to he said what God's gonna provide he
[1:12:27] said if I kill you
[1:12:29] he'll raise ya read your Bible called he
[1:12:33] said he counted it he's oh no they
[1:12:38] didn't talk about it why don't you have
[1:12:41] a sensible conversation with God a
[1:12:44] little bit about something every once in
[1:12:45] a while and listen to him talk he's
[1:12:49] wonderful and he'll express things to
[1:12:52] you that are so marvelous he said the
[1:12:58] way I can reason I chose Abraham because
[1:13:00] he believed me then now if you're gonna
[1:13:03] be anything you don't believe me help me
[1:13:09] little Horton you're gonna walk in the
[1:13:13] word you gonna believe me and I don't
[1:13:16] mean this disrespect I mean in truth
[1:13:18] that's where I've always walked alone in
[1:13:23] God's Word I've had a lot to try to pull
[1:13:26] me into different camps yeah I couldn't
[1:13:31] do it I've walked alone that's where

[1:23:14] spiritual a promise and then it would go
