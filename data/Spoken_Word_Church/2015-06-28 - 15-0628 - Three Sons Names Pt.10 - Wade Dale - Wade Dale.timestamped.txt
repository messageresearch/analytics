[0:00] so now we're going to have to get your
[0:02] Bible doubt those we're going to
[0:03] redesign get my old Bible out because I
[0:06] got a lot of notes written on my bow I
[0:07] can't see it well I'll put a zq up there
[0:11] yet but I'm going to read out of my
[0:13] Bible then we're going to Ezekiel
[0:16] chapter 1 because we've been speaking on
[0:23] three sons names all right remember God
[0:28] come in three sons name son of god it's
[0:31] on a man son of David and they all have
[0:34] a dispensation they all come in a
[0:40] dispensation that they all have now
[0:43] listen they all have different
[0:44] characteristics but it's the same person
[0:47] all right cuz even jesus said i was
[0:52] reading it this weekend or this week
[0:54] jesus said jesus said that the son of
[0:58] man if you say something against the son
[1:00] of man it will be forgiven right but if
[1:04] you say something against the son of god
[1:06] it will not be forgiven in this world of
[1:09] the world come so sure Kevin camera okay
[1:13] it won't be forgiven in this world of
[1:16] the world to come so so that's your
[1:18] dispensation now what happened brother
[1:20] Brown said the Son of God was in the son
[1:23] of man when Jesus said that he said I'll
[1:25] forgive you here but there's no
[1:29] forgiveness if you speak against this
[1:31] one okay because brother adam said the
[1:34] atonement had not been made yet alright
[1:37] so the atonement not been made yet you
[1:39] could speak against Jesus because look
[1:41] Peter spoke against you Kirsten you know
[1:46] after Jesus told him he was going to do
[1:48] it he still did and cursed him will see
[1:51] that was spoken against the son of man
[1:53] that one that spoke Peter didn't have a
[1:55] revelation true revelation because the
[1:58] person was not inside Peter yet
[2:00] I so God would forgive that God would
[2:03] forgive these other ones that don't do
[2:06] time that spoke against him and you go
[2:11] you say well give me a good example let
[2:13] me give you one good one Paul the
[2:18] Apostle Paul caused Christians to blast
[2:22] man he caused them to in other words
[2:26] forget their religion he caused them to
[2:29] be put to death what was paul doing Paul
[2:32] was doing that in the flesh right he was
[2:35] doing that in the flesh and that's why I
[2:37] see that many people they say well he
[2:40] had this seat of God any let me have a
[2:42] seat of God in him I thought that bride
[2:44] King person keep bright or seen him god
[2:47] I can't persecutor see to God Paul was
[2:49] dead Paul was dead he said he was dead
[2:53] he was dead in trespasses then blast
[2:57] spent causing people to blast man now
[2:59] how could he do that was something
[3:00] inside of the soul that was righteous
[3:02] you couldn't do that but on the road to
[3:06] Emmaus God clicking the word that Paul
[3:08] held right I'll help a letter of the Old
[3:12] Testament he held that letter to the
[3:14] tea's at a Pharisee of the Pharisees he
[3:16] said according to the law blameless in
[3:19] other words you Paul could have been a
[3:20] high priest right but that he said that
[3:23] does me no good now right because what
[3:26] the Son of God the spirit of god was now
[3:29] involved but Paul could cause God in
[3:35] human flesh Christian to do that and not
[3:38] be held against Paul so we can ever I
[3:41] understand that okay that's why Jesus
[3:43] could say you speak against the Sun man
[3:45] it'll be forgiven you you speak against
[3:47] the son of god which is what the Spirit
[3:50] the Holy Ghost you speak against the
[3:52] Holy Ghost it will not be forgiven
[3:53] that's blasphemy okay so now we've been
[3:58] talking on the Son of God for those of
[4:00] you that haven't been here for nine or
[4:04] eight Sunday's the Sun God is the spirit
[4:08] god the low gods that the
[4:09] the speech the word in the beginning was
[4:11] the word Word was with God and the Word
[4:13] was God right all right the same was in
[4:17] the beginning with God there's your
[4:18] Creator that's the one that created all
[4:21] things that's the father all right
[4:24] everybody got that that's the spirit god
[4:27] hi now then you got to go to verse 14 of
[4:32] John that says and the Word was made
[4:34] flesh so he took the Son God the spirit
[4:39] guide or the word and that word was made
[4:42] flesh in beasts on man called Jesus
[4:46] Christ right he was the son of man he
[4:49] was all of God in one person right you
[4:54] and I are not all of God in one person I
[4:56] on my part each of these brothers
[4:59] sisters we all have our part because
[5:01] we're the body we have parts he was the
[5:04] head he was the whole body was
[5:06] everything so he had the fullness of god
[5:08] that's why he could we could say that
[5:10] the Son of God was the creator and that
[5:14] creator went into human flesh called
[5:16] Jesus Christ and they still acknowledge
[5:19] him as the creator right to go over to
[5:23] the James and over into the books after
[5:24] Jesus and loud and come back they have
[5:26] they got a revelation that out the
[5:28] Creator was inside that man alright so
[5:31] they knew that it was the same person
[5:32] but manifested in a different form so
[5:36] brother Adam told us that there was
[5:38] three manifestation chicon it's on a man
[5:40] son david right now son david has
[5:43] nothing to do with us as far as this
[5:46] journey that we're on but it does have
[5:49] something to do with us because what we
[5:52] have go there right because to Israel
[5:58] he'll be the son of David promised in
[6:02] the Bible we read it later we're going
[6:03] to have
[6:04] felt but but the son of David is to the
[6:07] Jews right we're going to read here in
[6:10] Ezekiel how gone and it's a good little
[6:12] revelation that we look here in the
[6:14] zekiel and let's look at the background
[6:16] of Ezekiel because the Ezekiel speaks
[6:19] first time it's really spoken up a son
[6:21] of man son and prophesize not a man
[6:24] prophesied 70-something times just in
[6:27] the Book of Ezekiel it says some amount
[6:28] of prophesied but watch I want you to
[6:31] see the correlation though between
[6:33] Ezekiel Daniel and God okay is the hue
[6:38] manual and John there's a there's a
[6:40] correlation there number one is Daniel
[6:44] outside of his city when he wrote the
[6:48] book of daniel remember he was in
[6:49] captivity right Ezekiel was in captivity
[6:54] he was in Babylon he was away from his
[6:57] country all right where was John John
[7:00] was not in Jerusalem John was only out
[7:02] patents so he was away from his country
[7:05] same way with you and I you and I were
[7:08] away from our country and that's where
[7:11] God is revealing but what's here
[7:13] illegally that you got to come back into
[7:16] the country right right he's telling the
[7:18] Israel you need right there that you use
[7:21] them
[7:24] you know where I got it from Schofield
[7:28] Schofield footnote says he prophesied
[7:32] out of the land and his prophecy like
[7:35] there's followed the method of symbols
[7:38] and visions he said like Daniel and John
[7:40] so I didn't get a revelation that I but
[7:42] idea read you know brother grant got a
[7:44] lot of things up don't wield writing so
[7:47] I like to read the footnotes in them and
[7:49] the headers and all that you know this
[7:51] is the beginning of you think you're out
[7:52] here and that's that's where you read
[7:54] the commentary and it really is to me
[7:56] it's a it's a great thing because Daniel
[7:59] uses symbols Ezekiel use assembled and
[8:02] da youth assembly so God's bringing them
[8:05] a symbol but I was it to us it's a
[8:09] revelation to us it's the end between
[8:11] like we were talking about it's the Word
[8:14] of God that's not written down but it is
[8:16] written in the hearts of men right
[8:19] because as we spoke many times before if
[8:23] if back when God said let there be light
[8:26] if everything to be written in a book
[8:27] there's no way we could read it it'd be
[8:30] so huge so we couldn't be able to read
[8:33] it but he condensed it down who God
[8:36] condensed into 66 books and now it's
[8:39] easy for us to read so this is the word
[8:42] of God now is this all the word of God
[8:45] yeah that we need for now but in between
[8:48] there is a lot of the things written
[8:50] that we don't that we don't see with our
[8:52] eyes that's why I love them when the
[8:56] Bible says see I don't I don't I don't
[9:00] even think of eyes it's understanding
[9:04] see because jesus said the world will
[9:07] see me no more well they won't
[9:09] physically steam that seem to us but see
[9:11] means to understand in other words the
[9:13] world will never understand Jesus Christ
[9:15] except through menu alright so same
[9:19] thing with the the correlation between
[9:21] what Daniel was what given a history of
[9:24] how they were going to come out of
[9:25] avalon back into the end of their
[9:27] homeland right brother and said god
[9:30] never deals with this rope till they get
[9:31] back in their homeland so he's he killed
[9:33] was out of his homeland God come down
[9:36] and sit Ezekiel prophesied what
[9:39] prophesied that you're going to go back
[9:40] into the land same thing with John of
[9:43] course John was a heavenly be showing us
[9:49] because the Book of Revelations is not
[9:51] totally digital it's nice alright the
[9:55] bride my brother else is to the bride so
[9:57] what is it symbols and types to get us
[10:00] back to our homeland okay right so so
[10:04] what I'm saying he couldn't have just
[10:09] been Spirit God he had to drop down and
[10:13] be flesh died hey man because of the
[10:18] fall because where did we fall we fell
[10:20] in flesh Adam didn't fall and soul
[10:24] because remember the Bible says in the
[10:26] Book of Luke as you go down through the
[10:27] chronology it says Adam was what some
[10:31] guy hi so in the Old Testament Adam was
[10:34] the son of God the only Son of God that
[10:37] have eternal life in his soul as an
[10:39] indwelling right that maybe was on God
[10:43] because it was the spirit what that
[10:45] Genesis 126 man entered the 27 man but
[10:50] the revelation of the Son of man has not
[10:53] been until the end time to really
[10:56] realize because listen obviously Adam
[11:00] was a man right and he had a son of God
[11:03] in that son of man remember he was
[11:06] prefigured Jesus Christ right he was the
[11:08] first Adam Wright showing prefigured
[11:10] Christ so he was the son of man called
[11:16] son of man is the son of God in a man
[11:18] watch what it is see even
[11:24] you gotta be real you got to be real you
[11:26] got to watch tall with the Sun man
[11:29] because he had gone in his flesh but the
[11:34] revelation of the Son of Man the one
[11:37] that was standing there on earth d Son
[11:38] of Man was not included okay because it
[11:42] even to Ezekiel he sits on a man
[11:44] prophesied saw the man prophesied what's
[11:46] he doing he's telling you that God has
[11:48] come down into flesh and it's speaking
[11:51] because that's all I week we can't
[11:54] understand what bible say God is a
[11:56] spirit and then the worship you must
[11:58] worship in spirit driven in Jesus
[12:00] turnaround said you've seen that spirit
[12:01] you've seen me know what right you've
[12:03] seen me you've seen the father so he's
[12:05] telling them that that did church
[12:07] worshipping he's standing in front of
[12:10] your now that's what the Pharisees
[12:12] couldn't get they were the god of Moses
[12:15] was up in a pillow or a fire and and
[12:17] back into ghetto the Holy of Holies
[12:20] Jesus was trying to say that's all done
[12:23] back then but I'm standing here and then
[12:26] I'll be son of man I am now God in human
[12:29] flesh standing here talking to you and
[12:32] they turned that down right right they
[12:36] turn that down they turned the goddamn
[12:39] right he said they said you a man making
[12:44] yourself God we're really it was God had
[12:47] made a supplement right hey man but
[12:50] remember this son of man to be the son
[12:52] of man listen to be the son of man is
[12:55] not born of woman I mean as we are safe
[12:58] they're 18 right they're going one man
[13:01] well a backseat to Adam and Jesus Christ
[13:06] but Adam was created a full-grown man so
[13:09] he could not exactly type everything as
[13:11] far as me and you because we were going
[13:13] through a mother Jesus had to come down
[13:15] and be the Word made flesh born through
[13:19] a human woman to take away a curse that
[13:21] happened in the garden everybody got
[13:24] that
[13:24] if I got them so that's what's going to
[13:27] happen so now in the end time to me this
[13:32] in this takes away the sin curve this
[13:39] and this takes what remember as we spoke
[13:41] many times before this has no sin never
[13:46] sent a day in his life never had a bad
[13:48] thought this is the Creator this is God
[13:50] himself this is the one that created the
[13:54] world the purest form that ever was and
[13:57] eternal now the son of man had to be
[14:00] made eternal the son of man died this
[14:07] man cannot now this man was tempted this
[14:11] man can't be 10 right this man can be
[14:16] tempted this man can't that's why that's
[14:18] why I brother branham will read it next
[14:19] Sunday he said that's the reason that
[14:22] Jesus said you can say something against
[14:25] the son of man because he was a little
[14:26] lower form you could say something
[14:28] against that son of man that'd be
[14:29] forgiven you but when you say something
[14:31] against the Creator the one that created
[14:34] off when you say something against that
[14:36] that's why that we can forgive each
[14:38] other if I have a bump against bobbin
[14:40] and you know look at Paul and Barnabas
[14:43] Paul and Barnabas was to holy ghost
[14:46] filled call being a prophet and Barnabas
[14:49] was right behind me they worked together
[14:51] for a long time but they was one time in
[14:53] the Bible they had a contingent than the
[14:55] Bible said it was so bitter that they
[14:57] separated so see when we're in flesh we
[15:01] have all these things Jesus could be
[15:02] tempted yes Jesus were tempted in all
[15:05] points yeah right yeah this man's never
[15:08] been tempted man this man is never
[15:11] sitting and the son of man had some ass
[15:13] did not sin right right but he was born
[15:18] in this sinful world he had to be
[15:20] changed they don't leave this don't need
[15:22] a change mm-hmm that's mine once we
[15:24] realize if you're born again your change
[15:27] is already started you're changing
[15:29] already back
[15:30] that was the prophecy now listen that
[15:33] was the problem that's my people are
[15:34] weighing in the grave they got a
[15:37] revelation that God died for their sins
[15:39] they accepted it and they lived a good
[15:42] Christian life they did not deal much
[15:45] with the flesh because this flesh is
[15:48] rotting discipline you know we're going
[15:49] to get a new body well you know what God
[15:51] winked at that ignorance but if that son
[15:55] of God was in those people they're going
[15:57] to resurrect just as if just like
[15:58] somebody that died in this church the
[16:01] ones back in Paul Irene is Martin Luther
[16:03] Columba brother Brown said all they done
[16:06] was just said they were Christian and
[16:09] they will kill the IMP reached 25 your
[16:15] sermon they just accepted Christianity
[16:18] accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior
[16:20] they were killed God give them the Holy
[16:22] Ghost they were killed and they're
[16:24] waiting on you and I why because they
[16:26] were not able to come to a flesh change
[16:31] cuz look this don't need a change one
[16:34] more time yes don't need a change this
[16:36] needs a change because the son of man
[16:39] went through a change death burial
[16:42] resurrection when he resurrected he said
[16:45] all power in heaven there has been given
[16:47] unto me now he didn't say that before
[16:49] why didn't he said it before because it
[16:51] was son of god in son of man
[16:53] dispensation but now when Jesus rose
[16:56] that dispensation put the two together
[16:59] sure they were together the whole time
[17:01] but the understanding got it the
[17:05] understanding of the son of man but we
[17:07] read it next Sunday and most preachers
[17:10] most people to message if you told that
[17:13] they look at you cross-eyed it looks
[17:15] like I've got a horn sticking out of
[17:16] your head or something when Jesus asked
[17:19] Peter who do man say I the Son of Man am
[17:25] Peter said thou art the Christ the Son
[17:28] of the Living God right needed answered
[17:31] Jesus this question that's because he
[17:33] didn't understand it cuz remember jesus
[17:35] said flesh and blood did not reveal that
[17:38] to you
[17:39] but my father which is in heaven and
[17:42] upon this rock revelation I'll build my
[17:47] church now you didn't build church on
[17:48] son of man with a beluga body change in
[17:50] the first entertain he built in a
[17:52] revelation of the Son of God brother
[17:54] Graham said he died son ma'am he wrote
[17:55] son of God will bring all those folks
[17:57] next sunday i just want you to get
[17:58] thinking about and we're going to read
[17:59] this in the zekiel in a minute but he
[18:02] died son of man coach Sonny God think I
[18:04] son of man got a man he's undergone
[18:08] Canada this left Jesus at the cross and
[18:12] this died cuz flesh the flesh not gon
[18:17] take that you can't die but the son of
[18:24] man died but when he resurrected brother
[18:26] Brown says hear o son of god what he put
[18:29] back together again and he's been the
[18:31] son of god through seven church ages
[18:32] what the Spirit of God people accepting
[18:35] Jesus as their Savior him the atonement
[18:40] being made they accept that coma and
[18:43] they become Christians and they live the
[18:45] good Christian life in the doc because
[18:48] it didn't come to this revelation that's
[18:50] why the prophet of God had to do two
[18:52] things brother Brown said this messenger
[18:53] Malachi forced to do two things one turn
[18:56] the hearts of the children back to the
[18:58] father's one get this straightened back
[19:00] out they have lost all this then what to
[19:05] reveal the seven thunders the sealed to
[19:08] what to literally to change your body
[19:11] amen so that's the two parts of Malachi
[19:14] 4 did was number one years of
[19:17] preparation 1947 to 1963 that was to get
[19:21] that revelation back to its perfection
[19:23] because the first church age had a
[19:26] perfect revelation of the Son of God
[19:28] they had water baptism right they got
[19:30] all the things right
[19:31] the first hurricane okay right then it
[19:34] was lost down through the other church
[19:35] ages father son Holy Ghost baptism come
[19:38] in three God's Trinity and all that
[19:40] thing what was william branham to do
[19:42] that spirit of Elijah was to what
[19:44] restore the first part 47 263 restore
[19:48] back the faith of the Father and then
[19:52] bring the revelation that had not been
[19:54] seen before he said everyone who that
[19:57] man really was but not who that man
[19:59] really was who that man really is a man
[20:04] because brother Ram even said he's they
[20:08] say you say some people say you're at
[20:10] least on a man he said no I lace on a
[20:13] man now he should have said I'm a son of
[20:15] God if he had that revelation he had not
[20:19] a different but a more of a revelation
[20:22] when he said I'm a son of man revealing
[20:25] the son of man what was he telling us
[20:27] there was standing guard in human flesh
[20:29] revealing the Jesus that was walking in
[20:33] human flesh right compete really I mean
[20:37] he talks about ntp he goes back and
[20:40] forth you'll say we're sons of God you
[20:42] know say we're sons of men but when the
[20:44] anyone somebody told a scheme that
[20:45] question he said I am NOT least on
[20:47] amenities that I am a son man in Sam Sun
[20:51] God he knew it was son of god he knew
[20:53] that revelation had come up a little
[20:54] higher that that man that was walking in
[20:57] human flesh Jesus was standing he said
[21:00] not two feet from me while he went back
[21:02] to what spirit so whose flesh is it now
[21:07] it's not flesh that he's working through
[21:10] all right let's read his eagle let's see
[21:14] if I'm gonna read some of my notes I got
[21:16] on here oh my turn
[21:18] you can read that shirt but now remember
[21:21] as Ezekiel is out of them out of the
[21:23] country out of his homeland and God is
[21:26] telling you the fuel to tell Israel you
[21:29] have sinned right same way with Daniel
[21:34] come to the Ancient of Days air white as
[21:36] well that's the same as revelation 1 and
[21:38] what we've been reading upstairs for
[21:40] months see revelations wouldn't i watch
[21:43] this now came to pass in the thirteenth
[21:46] year and the fourth month fifth day I
[21:49] was among the captives of the river
[21:51] Chebar that the heavens were open and
[21:55] where have you heard that before
[21:57] revelations for one says they what door
[21:59] was opened in heaven brother Matthew
[22:02] last Sunday I don't think you really got
[22:04] into a star and he got a little
[22:06] sidetracked but but every time you see
[22:08] heaven open and the windows of heaven
[22:10] open why did the heavens open in the
[22:12] cloud come down to brother ground there
[22:14] was a revelation coming through that
[22:15] open gap or that open door remember he
[22:18] said anywhere you see the heavens were
[22:19] open but what is it the heavens r /
[22:22] there's a revelation come down well look
[22:23] right here the heavens were opened
[22:25] revelations for once it is the door was
[22:27] opened in heaven all right and I saw
[22:30] visions of God in the fifth day of the
[22:32] month which is the fifth year King
[22:33] yokai's cat from joel 19 captivity the
[22:38] word of the Lord came expressly undoes
[22:40] each of the priests amount of booze I'd
[22:42] the land of the Chaldeans by the realty
[22:44] bar the hand of the Lord was there upon
[22:46] him all right and I look and behold a
[22:49] whirlwind came out of the north a great
[22:52] cloud and firing folding itself and
[22:56] brightness was about it have the minster
[22:58] over the color of amber i will miss to
[23:00] the fire when did that Miss revelations
[23:03] one in the midst of the seven golden
[23:04] chem stick one lock into the son of man
[23:07] to watch what's this though is it goes
[23:08] further and I looked and behold a
[23:12] whirlwind came out of the north great
[23:13] cloud of firing phone except brightens
[23:15] was about how the master of the color
[23:17] ever out of mr. fire also out of the mr.
[23:20] l came to lightness and a look there's a
[23:22] likeness of four living creatures but
[23:26] watch and this was their appearance they
[23:30] had the likeness of a man you remember
[23:35] the line aux man and eagle right well
[23:38] that's what he sees but when he when he
[23:40] sums it up he says and this was their
[23:43] appearance they had the likeness of the
[23:46] land right and everyone had four faces
[23:50] and everyone had four wings and their
[23:52] fevers and their feet were straight feet
[23:55] the soul that feels like the soul of
[23:56] taps foot they sparkled like the color
[23:58] burnished brass and they had the hands
[24:00] of a man under the wings under four
[24:04] sides and that before they four had
[24:05] their faces and remember all of this is
[24:07] summed up in one man just like when John
[24:09] turns when Daniel turns and sees the
[24:12] Ancient of Days he sees the judgment we
[24:15] join turns and he sees one lock into the
[24:17] Sun man in the midst of the seven golden
[24:19] constant now remember what is the 4 b's
[24:22] the line aux man and eco brother Ram
[24:24] said that's the holy go right that's all
[24:27] ego goes remember when he got to the
[24:29] seal back to the fourth seal he said you
[24:31] don't see the combat be skinny morning's
[24:32] it so the rapture must take place on the
[24:34] fourth seal so there's no more combat
[24:36] beef because they're there for me and
[24:38] you this is the bride that's the same
[24:40] thing you saw because if he turned and
[24:42] saw one lock into the Son of Man of
[24:44] Revelations one as if you'll turns and
[24:46] this is his revelation of it right
[24:49] alright cuz there's no bride at this
[24:51] time alright alright everybody got that
[24:55] that's for the likeness of their faces
[24:57] they four had the face of a man face of
[25:00] a line then the face of an ox and an
[25:03] eagle so there's your line ox mana
[25:05] needle right before the swill their
[25:08] faces and their wings were stretched
[25:10] upward two wings of each one joint we
[25:14] can cover all this but I want to get to
[25:15] something they went everyone straight
[25:17] forward Ryan had this ? one
[25:19] remember that you said how in the world
[25:22] can for objects be looking in four
[25:24] different directions but keep going
[25:26] straight the whole time well see it it's
[25:30] like this the latter ox man an eagle is
[25:34] the holy ghost right so these are
[25:36] symbols so the lion is bold right the Ox
[25:41] is sacrificial the man is intelligent
[25:44] and the eagle is perfect right now
[25:48] sometimes you need the Holy Ghost to be
[25:50] prophetic in your life right so it's
[25:53] going forward if you need to bonus of a
[25:56] line it goes forward if you need a
[25:59] lightness of the eagle I mean the man
[26:01] you need some intelligent sure of
[26:03] Guardian tells us we all did it goes
[26:05] forward so you see it's not it's not
[26:08] like a let's try to explain it's not
[26:11] like that you take line an ox man needle
[26:13] and there's no way they can go he says
[26:16] all four we're facing forward going
[26:18] straight well if you go straight this
[26:19] way this is going backwards but if you
[26:22] need this this is what's going forward
[26:24] if you need this this is what's going
[26:26] forward if you need this this is what's
[26:28] going forward you see what I'm saying so
[26:30] the Bible's crept i believe is easier
[26:32] was seeing that rotate the line the off
[26:36] the man in the eagle cuz it says the
[26:38] lines to the living creature their
[26:40] parents was like burning well I'm sorry
[26:42] verse 12 this is what the question was
[26:45] I'm you can't remember that you get home
[26:47] okay you've had three children since
[26:50] then and then brain dead and they went
[26:53] everyone straight forward whether the
[26:56] spirit was to go so it was what the
[26:59] spirit was leading would bring them to
[27:01] the forefront they went they turn not
[27:04] when they went that was Ryan's question
[27:06] he said how in the world can be he said
[27:09] well you just said they turn when all
[27:10] they just step forward in your
[27:12] revelation if you need the lion the
[27:15] bonus that's part of the home of those
[27:18] steps forward in your life and you use
[27:20] it because listen you're not going to be
[27:22] all time you know the big old all the
[27:25] time sometimes you're going to need the
[27:27] ops you're going to need something
[27:28] you'll need to be you're going to need
[27:29] for your children inside of the world
[27:31] been out of the world ten years and you
[27:33] going to have to have that Hawks
[27:36] grinding grinding pulling and pulling
[27:38] right we can put all those in here which
[27:45] we never did but we you know the lines
[27:46] Mountain Eagle you put in Statue form em
[27:48] and they turn not when they win as for
[27:52] the lightness of living creatures their
[27:53] characters like burning coals of fire
[27:55] likely parents of lamb what up and down
[27:58] along the living creature in other words
[27:59] all the way through and the fire was
[28:02] bright now the fire lit forked lightning
[28:03] and the living creatures ran and
[28:07] returned as the appearance of a flash of
[28:09] lightning up that no up
[28:17] I'm trying to read some of the notes on
[28:18] a month vote I can't see them now as
[28:21] I'll be held to living creatures but
[28:23] we'll keep looking at behold one will
[28:25] upon the earth by the living creatures
[28:26] with his more faces now look this is
[28:29] that wheel in the middle the wheel in
[28:30] Ezekiel saw which brother branham
[28:32] explained as Jesus he saw Christ with
[28:35] the children of Israel in motion through
[28:38] the wilderness alright well same thing
[28:41] through your life through your journey
[28:42] because it was in Israel what was Israel
[28:44] journey get back to the homeland baby
[28:46] and the forehead one lightness and their
[28:49] parents and their work was as it were a
[28:52] wheel in the middle of wheel when they
[28:55] went they went upon their four sides and
[28:56] they turned on when they went we've
[28:58] already explained that as for their
[29:00] rings they were so high that they were
[29:01] dreadful in the ring for full lives
[29:03] round about them for eyes is what
[29:06] understanding revelation all right and
[29:08] when the living creatures went the wheel
[29:11] went by them is when the living
[29:12] creatures will lift it up from the earth
[29:13] the wheels were lifted up there's your
[29:15] Raptor there's her actor right there
[29:19] alright because when they lift it up the
[29:22] wheel went up when Christ goes up before
[29:25] living creatures go up and then I see
[29:28] for seal that's my brother found me
[29:30] under the rapture took place on the more
[29:31] seal because all the creatures were gone
[29:33] you can see him in the fifth seal all
[29:34] right whether the spirit was to go they
[29:37] went there was this spirit to go the
[29:40] wheels were lifted up over against them
[29:41] for the spirit of a living creature was
[29:44] in the wheel when those went these went
[29:47] and he stood he stood when these were
[29:49] lifted up from the earth of wheels were
[29:50] lifted up over against him for the
[29:52] spirit of the living creature within the
[29:54] wheel and the likeness of the firmament
[29:57] upon a head to the living creature was
[29:58] at the color of terrible crystal stretch
[30:00] forth over their heads above and under
[30:03] the firmament will their way
[30:04] straight one or the other every which
[30:06] have to which covered on this side
[30:08] everyone had to what's covered on that
[30:09] side anyone do that and when they when I
[30:13] heard the noise of their wings like the
[30:15] noise of great water what is that
[30:17] explaining water and the Bible is people
[30:21] so there's your bride and multitude form
[30:24] he heard the voice of water the water to
[30:26] hear he heard a roaring he wore a year
[30:29] what people voices as the voice of the
[30:32] almighty the voice of speech as the
[30:37] noise of a host when they stood they let
[30:39] down their wings and there was a voice
[30:41] from the permanent that was over their
[30:43] heads when they stood and let the wings
[30:45] down then we got to get through this
[30:46] before with clothes and I saw as the
[30:48] color of amber know and above the
[30:50] firmament with over their hands with the
[30:52] likeness of a throne remembered
[30:55] revelations for one there was one
[30:56] sitting on the throne alright as the
[30:59] appearance of a sapphire stone and upon
[31:01] the whiteness of the throne with the
[31:03] likeness as the appearance of a man
[31:06] above it upon it so there's one step on
[31:10] throne same as Revelation chapter one
[31:13] and I I mean Revelation chapter four and
[31:15] I saw as the color of amber program
[31:18] sitting at amber glow that was the
[31:20] pillar fire amber Wright as the apparent
[31:23] sapphire around about within it from the
[31:25] appearance of his loins even though
[31:27] working from the parents of his lawns
[31:28] even delrin now that's the totality of
[31:30] the bride right who that I saw as it
[31:37] were the appearance of fire and it had
[31:38] brightness round about it because
[31:40] remember what what are we in judgment as
[31:42] he parents of the bow that is in the
[31:44] cloud of the day of range so was the
[31:46] appearance of the brightness round about
[31:48] it this was the appearance of the
[31:49] likeness of the glory of the Lord and
[31:53] what is the glory of the Lord his people
[31:55] and when I saw it I fell upon my face
[31:58] and I heard a voice of one that's paid
[31:59] now we're going whoops
