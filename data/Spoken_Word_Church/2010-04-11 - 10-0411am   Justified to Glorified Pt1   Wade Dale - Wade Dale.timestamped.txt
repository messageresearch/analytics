[1:01] Amen. Ain't that wonderful that we have
[1:04] that security and that satisfaction?
[1:08] Let's all stand this time and we'll
[1:09] change the size.
[1:13] It's 3:16 in the spiral book. Lord,

[2:35] change you
[2:41] [Music]
[2:47] living, breathing, walking,
[2:50] God.
[2:53] That's the mystery of this holy
[2:57] all wrapped up in one statement, right?
[3:00] Ye are God's. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[3:06] And you have to determine whether you're
[3:08] in that group or not because it's
[3:10] individual affair with God. I can't give
[3:12] you anything today
[3:15] at all. That's right. You'll have to
[3:17] receive it from God.
[3:19] Amen. And I hope you do. Amen. Love to
[3:23] be in the house of the Lord. Amen.
[3:26] Love each and every one of you. Good to
[3:28] uh have brother Richard
[3:32] with us. Amen. Amen. They're
[3:36] not visitors. They've been here before.
[3:38] So, u their names are written in a real
[3:41] book. So, we don't have to worry about
[3:43] the name written in the book on the road
[3:44] somewhere else.
[3:46] They're just here with us today. And uh
[3:50] the instruction
[3:59] here's
[4:01] not doing this today.
[4:03] [Laughter]
[4:11] Now,
[4:14] there we go. We're going to have a
[4:17] little Sunday school class today. Reason
[4:19] we're doing this is uh it was requested
[4:23] uh I did this down in St. in Augustine,
[4:26] Florida a few weeks ago and dad happened
[4:29] to be there and uh I got his seal of
[4:32] approval. So I know we're going to do it
[4:34] today and and we're going to put it on a
[4:36] video. Can everybody see this? Can you
[4:39] see it from over there?
[4:41] D you may you be okay. I'll move it.
[4:45] That's fine. Just leave it right there.
[4:46] But the Lord bless each and every one of
[4:48] you. Pray for dad. And I want to thank
[4:51] brother Joe Solace. Amen. Um, he took
[4:54] over Sunday school this morning and I
[4:56] think they just fired me.
[5:02] If I'm up if I'm upstairs next Sunday,
[5:04] you'll know that I had been put out.
[5:06] That's okay. No, he did a wonderful job.
[5:09] Then, uh, if you'd like to continue
[5:12] that, it doesn't bother me a bit. I'm
[5:14] not the only people on the beach. You
[5:17] guys know that it takes a five-fold
[5:19] ministry. It takes ley. It takes uh it
[5:22] takes each individual.
[5:24] And uh before we get into the service,
[5:27] let's turn to Hebrews 10. It's something
[5:29] been on my heart just for just for a
[5:31] moment. Uh we're going to take our time
[5:34] with this today and try to show
[5:36] something in your journey, the journey
[5:39] of life. It is a journey that God put us
[5:43] on. Amen. And uh it's he that has made
[5:47] us and not we ourselves. That's right.
[5:49] We're the sheep of his pasture.
[5:52] Um we didn't choose to be in this end
[5:55] time, but now that we are in the end
[5:56] time, I thank God he chose us to be in
[5:58] the end time. That's right. All right.
[6:00] So, we're just going to This is going to
[6:02] be just a small something that we're
[6:03] going to read. I'm going to go over this
[6:05] because it's just something been on my
[6:07] heart. This has nothing to do with what
[6:08] we're going to do here, but um I think
[6:13] it may be something that we need to look
[6:15] at. Hebrews 10 and 25. Let's pray before
[6:19] we start. Dear heavenly father, thank
[6:21] you for each one that has come today. We
[6:25] pray now, Lord, that you will settle
[6:26] each heart. That truly, Lord, this is an
[6:29] individual affair with you, Father. But
[6:31] you put in your word a place for
[6:34] pastors, teachers, evangelists,
[6:36] apostles, and all those to perfect the
[6:39] saints, Lord. And we pray today that you
[6:41] would use this unworthy vessel. Just one
[6:44] more time, Lord. May it not be a man
[6:46] speaking, but may it be the Holy Spirit
[6:48] speaking to each heart and each mind,
[6:51] Lord, that it'll go deep inside and that
[6:54] they'll eat it, Lord, as John ate the
[6:56] book. May it be, Lord, if it's bitter
[6:59] and may it be bitter, but oh Lord, it's
[7:01] so sweet. Yes. To say that we have come
[7:04] under the last day word of the hour. We
[7:08] could be out in the world, Lord, doing
[7:10] other things. We could be in nom in
[7:12] nominal churches, Lord, but you chose us
[7:16] because, Lord, you knew that we'd want
[7:18] this more than anything. So, Father, I
[7:20] pray that you would bind all the
[7:22] principalities and powers that would
[7:23] come against his service. Bind the
[7:26] brokenhearted, heal the sick. You said
[7:28] you sent your word and healed the people
[7:29] and delivered them from destruction. So,
[7:31] as the word goes forth, may someone be
[7:33] healed, Father. May someone be touched.
[7:36] May someone be saved, Father. Yes. May
[7:38] you fill us all again with the Holy
[7:40] Spirit, Lord. That's what we're looking,
[7:41] Lord, for that great outpouring that you
[7:43] would just pour it on us from head to
[7:45] toe, Lord, as the oil running down Aaron
[7:47] from his head down to his to his shoes.
[7:50] Father, just be with us now. Be with dad
[7:52] as he pack as he preaches there in in
[7:54] Tennessee, Lord. Just bless him for us
[7:56] to look bless the little bride around
[7:58] the world, Lord. Continue to be with the
[8:01] ones on the foreign field. Bless them,
[8:03] Lord, and give them strength to do what
[8:06] they need to do. Father, forgive us of
[8:08] our sins and our many mistakes because
[8:10] we make many. And Lord, may it be your
[8:13] righteousness that shone today and not
[8:15] ours because they are filthy rags, but
[8:17] your righteousness is white as snow.
[8:20] Father, just bless us and be with us in
[8:22] Jesus name.
[8:26] Hebrews 10. Now, if you read the whole
[8:28] part of Hebrews, we not read Hebrews
[8:30] 10:25. Not forsaking the assembling of
[8:32] ourselves together as the manner of some
[8:34] is. But if you'll read the before and
[8:36] the after. All right, but we're just
[8:38] going to key on 25. Not forsaking the
[8:41] assembling of your ourselves together as
[8:44] the manner of some is. So some are not.
[8:47] And I say to you that are listening to
[8:48] the internet, if you don't have a church
[8:49] to go to, you need to find one. Because
[8:52] let me tell you something, people. We
[8:54] might think this isn't an individual
[8:56] affair, and it is. But you're not going
[8:58] to make it by yourself. All right. Amen.
[9:00] You are. We are the ones that need help.
[9:04] We are the ones that need to bind
[9:05] together. I told somebody on the on the
[9:08] uh telephone yesterday, I said Paul
[9:11] said, "If an angel come and preach any
[9:13] other thing, so if William Brandon was
[9:15] to come back and walk in that door and
[9:17] say, "Hey, you don't have to go to
[9:18] church anymore. You can get it all by
[9:20] yourself."
[9:21] I'd say that's a liar. Yes. Because this
[9:24] Bible cannot be broken. Amen. Now, I
[9:28] know brother Random said we might be
[9:29] meeting in houses when the squeeze come,
[9:31] but I look around and I don't see much
[9:32] of a squeeze except for our bellies
[9:34] squeezing against our pants and our uh
[9:38] and our shirts. So, this is not the
[9:40] squeeze people. This is where we need
[9:42] help.
[9:44] I wanted to preach a little sermon on
[9:46] the on the interval between the um six
[9:49] and a seven, but the Lord just kind of
[9:51] led me to do this and and uh actually
[9:55] mom asked me to do this.
[9:58] did that. Well, but anyway,
[10:01] but not forsaking the assembly of
[10:03] ourselves together as a manner of some
[10:05] is, but exhorting one another and so
[10:08] much the more as you see the day
[10:10] approaching. Amen. Now, we might be
[10:12] scattered like the wind, but we're not
[10:14] now.
[10:15] We need help now. We need to get to a
[10:18] place to where if we have to be alone by
[10:20] ourselves, then we can sustain and make
[10:23] it by what God's planted in our heart.
[10:26] But this is not the hour because if
[10:27] you'll read in Matthew 24:24,
[10:30] he says there's people going to come
[10:31] through and say, "Lo, he is in the
[10:33] desert." Yes. Right. Let's go. That's
[10:37] right. But the Bible says
[10:41] if you know where Christ is, you won't
[10:44] go to the desert. Cuz they said it'll
[10:46] deceive the very elect if possible. The
[10:48] reason the elect won't be deceived is
[10:49] because you'll know where Christ is.
[10:52] Somebody can't come in and say, "Hey,
[10:53] Christ is over at this place." Amen. You
[10:56] got to know whether that Christ inside
[10:57] of you will take you to that place or
[10:59] not. All right. So, it is an individual
[11:02] affair. Brother Ding gave me a wonderful
[11:04] uh quote. I forgot to bring it up here,
[11:06] but anyway, it is an individual affair,
[11:08] but we must bind together. You have a
[11:11] responsibility today to pull on the gift
[11:13] that God gave me. I know what I'm going
[11:16] to say, but you're going to pull on
[11:18] something that maybe I haven't got in my
[11:22] nose to say. All right.
[11:25] But Paul, you know, Paul and
[11:27] Corinthians, if this is not a way for us
[11:30] to have church, then Paul was wrong.
[11:32] When he got to the Corinthians, he put
[11:34] preachers in
[11:36] bishops,
[11:38] right? Why would he why, you know,
[11:40] somebody asked me one time said, you
[11:41] know, why did God put deacons in the
[11:43] church if the Holy Ghost is the one
[11:44] who's supposed to lead? I said, well,
[11:46] the Holy Ghost ain't in everybody.
[11:50] That's why you have deacons. Cuz you
[11:52] know the Bible says the Holy Ghost will
[11:53] lead you and guide you into all truth.
[11:55] So why do you need a deacon and an
[11:56] elder? No, you need those or they
[11:58] wouldn't be in the Bible because we're
[12:00] human beings. We're sheep, remember,
[12:02] that need to be led. Whether we think
[12:05] we're, you know, kings and priests, we
[12:07] will be. God will give us that time. But
[12:09] right here on this earth, we're she
[12:11] we're sheep and we need a shepherd. But
[12:14] I just wanted to bring that to you and
[12:15] just you got to see in your heart
[12:19] the right thing to do. Amen. in your
[12:21] heart. You got to know that you know
[12:23] that you know that's right because
[12:25] remember look in the Bible and I believe
[12:27] this is where we at brother Dean in
[12:28] between you look at the the Bible goes
[12:30] through six seals and stops and there's
[12:33] an interval something's brought in and
[12:35] then the seventh you're going to see
[12:37] even with the statue of a perfect man
[12:39] you're going to see there's seven ads
[12:41] right but between that sixth and seventh
[12:44] there's an interval everywhere in the
[12:46] Bible brother said it was a resting time
[12:49] awaiting I believe we're in that time
[12:51] right now because God's going to shake
[12:53] the ones that shook needs to be shook.
[12:55] The ones that's going to fall out of the
[12:56] tree is going to fall out of the tree.
[12:58] Right? Let the chips fall where they
[13:00] may. But you know what? It's your
[13:01] choice. You choose. Choose you this day
[13:04] who you'll serve. Right now, let's get
[13:06] into the sermon. Hebrews 6, please.
[13:12] We're going to walk Hebrews 6 and1.
[13:15] We're going to walk through our journey
[13:16] today.
[13:19] We're going to title it justified
[13:22] to glorify. Amen.
[13:25] Now, daddy touched a little on it
[13:26] Wednesday night.
[13:29] I want you to remember one thing. Put
[13:30] this little seed in your heart. God does
[13:33] everything by threes.
[13:36] God is perfected in threes. Right.
[13:39] And when you get into the future home, I
[13:41] didn't bring the quote, but brother Bham
[13:42] says in the future home, talking about
[13:44] where we're going to live for an
[13:46] eternity, we're already eternal. He said
[13:49] justified. Yes. Sanctified. Yes. Filled
[13:52] with the Holy Ghost. Because the earth
[13:54] has to go through that. Even though
[13:56] we're all perfect, the earth has to go
[13:59] through its justification,
[14:00] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[14:01] Spirit.
[14:02] Hebrews 6:1. Therefore, leaving the
[14:05] principles of the doctrine of doctrine
[14:06] of Christ, let us go on into perfection,
[14:09] not laying again the foundation of
[14:11] repentance from dead works and faith
[14:12] toward God, of the doctrine of baptism
[14:14] and laying on of hands, and the
[14:15] resurrection of the dead, and of eternal
[14:17] judgment. And this will we do if God
[14:21] permit. Amen. All right. Now, let's turn
[14:22] to Romans 8. Your Bible should
[14:24] automatically open to that.
[14:27] Daddy's been on it for a while and the
[14:30] Bible's got a crease in it. That's okay.
[14:34] That means it's being used.
[14:36] Y'all have to forgive me. Sinuses are
[14:38] draining. I'm sure some of yours are,
[14:40] too.
[14:41] Just pray for us as the Lord dried up.
[14:43] We can get something said.
[14:46] Verse 30.
[14:48] Moreover, whom he did predestinate them
[14:51] he also called.
[14:54] And whom he called,
[14:57] them he also justified. Amen. And whom
[15:00] he justified. Lord, them he also
[15:05] glorified.
[15:07] What shall we then say to these things
[15:09] if God be for us? Who can be against us?
[15:13] You can be seated in the Lord. Bless the
[15:15] reading of the word. And
[15:18] just pray that we don't get this done in
[15:20] one, we'll do it in two.
[15:22] But we wanted to uh video it and uh so
[15:28] we can see kind of visually what we're
[15:30] what we're talking about. Let me start
[15:32] off with a quote
[15:35] from the third seal.
[15:39] You know, dad's not preaching per se on
[15:41] the seals, but it would be um it would
[15:44] be a nice thing if we all started going
[15:46] back to the seals again,
[15:49] cuz truly that's justification,
[15:50] sanctification. That's redemption.
[15:53] That's redemption.
[15:57] Try not to hit that thing
[16:00] marked in the right spot so he can show
[16:02] that. Not me, but show the board. Okay.
[16:06] Romans 8. We see that God's speaking
[16:09] about this. But watch what brother Brown
[16:11] says in the third seal. Now, we find out
[16:14] that then that these mysteries are
[16:16] supposed to be revealed. Then why don't
[16:18] these other men Wesley Lutheran these
[16:20] great reformers who brought out
[16:21] justification sanctification Pentecostal
[16:24] age with baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[16:25] things why didn't he catch these
[16:27] messages? Why didn't they get them?
[16:29] Because they were reformers. Just like
[16:31] take it on the other side. There was
[16:32] people come in who had power as kings
[16:35] but wasn't kings. See? See, you have to
[16:37] notice the Bible terminology of
[16:39] anything. See, now watch. But these the
[16:42] reason that all the stray ends of the
[16:45] mysterious part of justification, the
[16:46] mysterious part of sanctification, the
[16:49] mysterious part of the baptism of the
[16:50] Holy Ghost and why, what kind, what did
[16:52] Eve, did Eve eat an apple or a
[16:54] pomegranate or something? What was the
[16:56] serpent seed? Baptism name father, son,
[16:58] holy ghost, the name of the Lord Jesus.
[17:00] Oh, hundred of those things that has
[17:01] been left loose ends. So, brother Brown
[17:05] comes and he that truly we see that that
[17:09] Luther had a justification that put him
[17:12] in the body of Christ, but it's not a
[17:14] justification that's going to put me and
[17:16] you in the body of Christ. All right.
[17:17] Now, I know this is old half for some of
[17:19] you, but guess what? We're going to go
[17:21] over it one more time. All right. Is
[17:23] that okay? And if you can't see this,
[17:25] let me know. I'm going try to
[17:38] What's that beeping?
[17:40] Can you hear it? Yes.
[17:45] Good. At least it's still beating
[17:48] quick.
[17:50] All right. And what we're going to do
[17:53] today is we're going to look at
[17:56] justification to glorification or
[17:59] justified to glorified
[18:01] and go through our journey as a
[18:03] Christian. And it's like I told him down
[18:06] in Florida, if you can't relate to this,
[18:09] you need to be born again. So today
[18:11] people, if I lose you, please start
[18:14] right here with baby faith. Just like
[18:16] Paul, he didn't say he wasn't saying
[18:18] doing away with a foundation. Right.
[18:21] Right. He said, "Let's take the
[18:23] foundation and go on to perfection."
[18:26] Because truly this here is this is where
[18:29] you start your journey right here. This
[18:32] is your journey. All right.
[18:36] Right. Right there at faith. But you
[18:39] have to come through and we're going to
[18:41] look today and try to take our time. If
[18:44] we if we get too fast, somebody say slow
[18:46] down. But when you were born again, you
[18:50] started at faith
[18:52] because the Bible says, "Add to your
[18:54] faith." In second Peter, it says, and I
[18:58] love that it says, "Having the divine,
[19:01] there's only one divine." That's right.
[19:03] Having the divine nature. Yes. Your
[19:07] nature was not divine.
[19:09] I'll promise you that.
[19:12] It's hard for a lot of you to see that
[19:13] my nature is divine a lot of times, but
[19:16] somewhere down in there by the Holy
[19:19] Ghost, right, our nature is divine.
[19:21] Amen. But we're encased in this little
[19:24] thing called the earth. Right.
[19:28] But when we start our journey, and I do
[19:31] like that word divine because there's
[19:33] really only one divine. When I read that
[19:34] in second Peter, brother, that boils in
[19:37] my heart when it says having the divine
[19:40] nature of almighty God. Amen. That ought
[19:43] to make you sacrifice. That's right. I
[19:45] mean, it ought to just make you just
[19:46] boil over because he gave something to
[19:48] you that was divine that you didn't
[19:50] have.
[19:52] And actually, you didn't want. Oh my.
[19:54] Come on. That's right. Were you looking
[19:56] for God? No. He was looking for you.
[19:59] That's right. All right. Now, let's
[20:01] start with baby justification. Now, this
[20:04] may be elementary, but we're going to
[20:06] have to start somewhere. All right. So
[20:09] on our journey when we become justified
[20:13] now there's not a real mysterious part
[20:15] of that but you know what there is a
[20:17] real mysterious part of that. How in the
[20:19] world can can God take a man like me
[20:22] that like I've told you many times this
[20:24] mouth that he uses now was used in a lot
[20:27] of other ways to say bad things make
[20:30] people feel bad in a real bad way.
[20:34] This hand the same hand I used to pick a
[20:36] beer bottle up with all of you. We all
[20:38] use this thing out here. We know we did
[20:40] this thing, what we did with these
[20:42] things. All right. But God comes in and
[20:43] says, "Hey, if you'll believe in me,
[20:46] I'll take everything you've done from
[20:48] that point and I'm just going to wash it
[20:50] away."
[20:52] Hey,
[20:54] we're just down here. We're not even up
[20:55] here yet.
[20:58] But now, it doesn't do anything. It
[21:00] doesn't bring you a divine nature,
[21:02] but it does put you in an attitude like
[21:05] like the Bible says in and and Paul is
[21:07] correct. Those who he has truly I want
[21:10] to I'm not adding to the word, but I
[21:12] believe that's what Paul was saying.
[21:13] Those he truly justified. Amen.
[21:18] You already got a glorified condition up
[21:20] here. That's right. That's right. Okay.
[21:22] That's right. But now there's a lot of
[21:24] people that could be justified. I've
[21:26] seen it happen. You've seen it happen.
[21:28] come up, make a confession, go right
[21:30] back out in the world, and you never see
[21:32] them again. Well, I believe truly that
[21:33] God said in his word that if you will
[21:36] believe on me, I'll cut off your past
[21:37] sins. But the next day, you're going to
[21:40] do the same sin over again. Come on.
[21:42] Okay. So, that's baby form justification
[21:45] because that's what Luther done. Even
[21:46] when Luther was born again, what did he
[21:48] do? He sat in a pub, smoked a beer,
[21:50] smoked a pot, and drank a beer.
[21:53] Somebody say I'm getting ahead of myself
[21:55] here.
[21:57] But under justification in his age
[21:59] though, that put him in the body of
[22:00] Christ. That put him right here. But he
[22:03] had nothing to take him any further
[22:05] because the word had blinded his eyes.
[22:08] Right?
[22:10] It blind. You can't be blinded by light,
[22:12] people.
[22:14] All right. So baby born form
[22:16] justification. You walk up and you say,
[22:19] "Pastor, I'm tired of living this way. I
[22:22] want my God to deliver me from what I've
[22:26] done in the past. Mhm. God says, "Okay,
[22:30] I'm just I'll do it." So, he chopped off
[22:34] your past sins. You make a confession of
[22:36] faith, right? All right. It's like
[22:39] brother Brandham showed about the jar.
[22:40] You see a jar laying out on the street.
[22:43] Uh it's full of mud and water and it's
[22:45] closed up. Well, you know, God picks
[22:46] that jar up and he says, "Okay, I got
[22:48] you." Yeah. You're not going to be dirty
[22:51] in that anymore. But that doesn't clean
[22:53] the jar up. Right. So now let's go to
[22:57] sanctification.
[22:58] A deeper walk with God. The next thing
[23:01] what he does is God gives you a new
[23:04] spirit.
[23:06] That's what the Bible said. What brother
[23:08] said, brother said to give you a spirit
[23:10] that you can love God with, right? And
[23:15] you become in an order,
[23:18] a religious order. Oh my. And that's the
[23:22] most dangerous part is right here.
[23:24] Right. Right. We had a discussion in the
[23:27] ministers meeting down in in Florida and
[23:29] I don't think the preachers got what dad
[23:31] and I were trying to to get to them but
[23:34] they were saying we read in second Peter
[23:37] where God says
[23:41] after you get all these virtues they
[23:43] make you you reading in second Peter
[23:45] says they make you in other words they
[23:47] do if you receive all the virtues that
[23:49] makes you a you know a better person the
[23:51] son of God. All right. So, they were
[23:53] saying, "Well, if this makes them, why
[23:55] are our people still acting the way
[23:56] they're acting?" And buddy, I just went
[23:58] over there and I said, "Because you know
[24:00] what? They're stuck right here thinking
[24:03] they're right here." And I said, "You're
[24:05] even thinking they're right here."
[24:07] Right. See, we as ministers, we want to
[24:09] believe everybody's full of the Holy
[24:11] Ghost, saved and ready to go. But he
[24:13] said, "Fear not, little flock." Right.
[24:15] Right.
[24:17] Right there. The unclean spirit goes out
[24:20] of a man, walks in dry places,
[24:24] seekth rest, findth none, comes back,
[24:27] brings seven more religious demons.
[24:29] Religious, not drunk. Religious demon
[24:32] puts you in church
[24:34] and tells you that you have faith now.
[24:37] You have the Holy Ghost.
[24:39] That's the devil's ploy.
[24:41] But if you truly are sanctified, God
[24:43] does clean you up, right? and puts you
[24:46] in order or in in aside for service. He
[24:50] takes the jar takes the jar and cleans
[24:52] the outside of the jar up and sets it up
[24:54] on a on a a shelf and gets you ready for
[24:58] service, but you're not in service. But
[25:01] let me come back to this because let me
[25:02] tell you right here is where the devil
[25:04] has a lot of people in this message
[25:06] stuck. Believe so, right?
[25:09] And a lot of you, right? Amen.
[25:12] Oh, they going on that one. What?
[25:14] Everybody else.
[25:16] Yeah, I ain't got everybody else up. But
[25:18] when he said you,
[25:22] I've been back 10 years, man. A lot of
[25:24] you hadn't moved one inch in 10 years.
[25:26] So,
[25:28] hey, but you know what? I hope to God
[25:31] that he's reveals to you that you're
[25:33] sanctified. Amen. And that's where
[25:34] you're at. Amen. because then he can
[25:37] bring you up to the baptism of the Holy
[25:39] Spirit or faith.
[25:43] But people, it's a journey. We must
[25:45] continue. We must continue. That's why
[25:48] we need each other. We need Bible study.
[25:50] We need Sunday school. I don't, you
[25:52] know, I don't see how that's so
[25:54] organizational. I see the book people at
[25:56] Ephesus. They gathered together 12
[25:58] people. They did not just sit there and
[26:00] look at each other. Right. That's right.
[26:03] They talked about the word of God and
[26:04] the Bible said they extorted each other.
[26:06] In other words, they spoke one to the
[26:08] other. What about their
[26:13] journey? Right. What do you think you
[26:16] and I going to talk about for an
[26:17] eternity? We're going to want to hear
[26:18] everybody's journey. I am.
[26:23] Luther's going to wonder how he got
[26:24] stuck down here and we got all the way
[26:26] up here. We're going to tell him what
[26:28] his justification though took us to.
[26:30] Right? Because that justification in
[26:33] this Bible is the same one that Luther
[26:35] got a hold of.
[26:37] But we can take it and show the
[26:39] mysterious part and he's he's going to
[26:42] ask you, "How did you get from here to
[26:44] here?" Because I only got here. You
[26:46] don't believe that? I believe I believe
[26:49] Luther exactly will say, "How in the
[26:51] world did you get from here to there?"
[26:53] Right. All right.
[26:55] Brother said Luther is just like he went
[26:58] to sleep and woke up the next morning.
[27:00] When he comes back in this dimension,
[27:02] it's just like he went to sleep, come
[27:03] right back into this dimension. Right?
[27:05] But I don't believe that Luther is going
[27:07] to come back into this dimension with
[27:09] all the full knowledge of the
[27:10] headstones. I may be wrong, but I think
[27:13] we're going to be learning more. You
[27:15] say, "Well, we're going to be perfect
[27:16] and eternal and all these things." Well,
[27:18] that's right. But what about the guy
[27:20] with the cup of water in my name and and
[27:22] the foolish virgins? They're they don't
[27:24] have an understanding like you and I
[27:25] have.
[27:27] And you know what? We're going to be
[27:29] able to teach them. I believe because
[27:33] the Bible says we're priests and kings.
[27:35] Brother Random said if we're priests and
[27:37] kings, we're going to have to have
[27:38] somebody to preach to and somebody to
[27:40] rule over. Right. Now, that's the Bible.
[27:43] Not that ain't nothing me and you come
[27:45] up with. We're to be priests and kings.
[27:47] That's what it said. Okay.
[27:50] Sometimes we take look at these little
[27:51] statements we make and we don't really
[27:53] think about it. But if you think about
[27:55] it, you want to be priest and kings.
[27:56] What are you going to be a priest over?
[27:58] There's not somebody to tell something
[27:59] to. That's right. All right. Now,
[28:04] justification.
[28:07] God, I'm finished with my life. I don't
[28:09] want nothing to do with the old man.
[28:12] Sanctification.
[28:15] God, clean me up and set me aside
[28:19] and get me ready to go into service
[28:23] because what I'm doing is is I'm not
[28:25] satisfied
[28:26] with that same because remember that
[28:29] still didn't do anything to that inside
[28:31] guy, the real you, the soul. The soul is
[28:34] still black at sanctification, right?
[28:36] He's cleaning it up.
[28:38] All right. But until he comes right
[28:40] here, there is not two people in your
[28:43] soul fighting.
[28:45] It's either faith or doubt. You're
[28:47] either black or white.
[28:50] Right. Right. Black being the devil and
[28:54] white being God. All right. So, it's not
[28:56] too soul. We're not worrying about all
[28:57] that junk cuz that's neither here nor
[28:59] there. But God cleans us up. And then
[29:02] what does he do right here at faith?
[29:05] Brother Adam said he somehow he comes
[29:08] down through all that and gives you a
[29:11] divine nature of almighty God. Which
[29:14] actually a lot of people think, well,
[29:16] praise God, I got the Holy Ghost. It's
[29:18] over.
[29:20] No, it just begins.
[29:23] Your journey just begins at the baptism
[29:25] of the Holy Spirit. You're still going
[29:28] to have problems. You're still going to
[29:29] have trials. You still going to have
[29:31] test because that's what this man is
[29:33] from here up to here. We're going to
[29:35] fill this in in a minute. All right. But
[29:38] does everybody understand so far?
[29:39] Justification dropped off your past sin.
[29:43] Sanctification cleans you up and sets
[29:45] you aside for service. And then God
[29:48] comes down into your soul, burns out
[29:51] that old nature, and then puts his
[29:54] nature in. Now, that's not unclean.
[29:56] That's the divine nature of God. Right.
[29:59] This man right here
[30:02] is already right glorified.
[30:06] Right. That's right.
[30:09] This is Yes. And this is not right. Nod
[30:13] a little louder, would you?
[30:17] The devil's telling us that that's not
[30:20] right. That's what he's telling you in
[30:22] your head. Glorified.
[30:25] We can't go past Romans 8:30.
[30:28] those who he justified. He's already
[30:34] that's past tense. That's right.
[30:36] Glorified.
[30:40] So in your soul today, if you're born
[30:42] again,
[30:44] you are everything. Now, don't get me
[30:46] wrong. Your everything you need for your
[30:48] journey is right here.
[30:52] But that does not end your journey.
[30:54] right now. There's a teaching in the
[30:56] message that when you get the Holy Ghost
[30:57] down here that you're done. You're
[31:00] already up here because this is where
[31:01] the other church age is is up here. You
[31:03] know, where this is where we're supposed
[31:04] to be right here. Right. And um
[31:09] last year,
[31:11] right? Right. That's so so you get
[31:14] everything. Well, yeah, I believe you
[31:16] get everything. But you know, we were
[31:19] reading the other day when a when a
[31:22] little girl is is conceived in the womb,
[31:25] a girl that at what? 6 weeks,
[31:30] at 6 or 8 weeks, if you if you have a
[31:32] having a baby and it's a girl at 6 weeks
[31:34] old, she already starts producing eggs.
[31:37] Oh, what? In her body for her journey in
[31:41] life. But now, let's just be adults for
[31:43] a minute. She's not going to be able to
[31:46] make that manifest until she becomes a
[31:48] girl. I mean, a lady. Does everybody
[31:50] understand what I'm saying? 12 years
[31:52] old, 13, 14, whenever, you know, time
[31:54] starts and all that. But she has
[31:57] everything she needs.
[32:00] Everything. Got all of her fingers,
[32:02] right? One eye on each side of the nose,
[32:05] everything she needs to conceive and
[32:07] have children. But we know it's an awful
[32:09] thing. They can't do that till they're
[32:11] 12 or 13 years old. Hey, they got all
[32:14] the parts, right? They got all the way
[32:17] to do it right here. Amen.
[32:20] But can she do it? Nope. She's got to
[32:23] wait for her journey in life to take her
[32:26] to a place. Amen. That she can become a
[32:29] wife and then become a mother. There's
[32:32] stages. And truly, yes, we received
[32:34] everything because you can't go what the
[32:36] Bible said. It says justified to
[32:38] glorified right here. Right. Mhm. Now,
[32:41] we have a journey that's a three-stage
[32:44] journey that we must go from this baby
[32:47] justification to where God's going to
[32:49] change somebody's body and we're going
[32:51] to have a glorified body on this earth.
[32:54] Yes. That's right. That's right. Because
[32:56] those who he's justified, he's already
[32:59] glorified. Right. Now, we're not going
[33:02] to teach a new new birth.
[33:06] All right.
[33:07] Some people said, "Brother Random
[33:09] changed his attitude or changed his way
[33:10] about a new birth back in, you know,
[33:14] after the seals were broke." No, they
[33:16] just missed what he was saying, brother
[33:17] Dean. He just took us higher into the
[33:19] Holy Spirit. He just revealed more of
[33:22] the Holy Ghost that we had not seen
[33:23] before. It wasn't a new word. That's
[33:26] right. You don't just Hey, listen.
[33:29] Right here's where I'm telling you where
[33:31] the people are stuck in this message
[33:32] because they say this right here. I am
[33:35] in the message.
[33:42] I believe
[33:45] what
[33:47] Brother Brown said.
[33:51] You can die and go to hell right there.
[33:53] Right. You can sit in the message church
[33:55] and drive up and die and go to hell
[33:57] right there. I am in the message. I
[33:59] believe what brother Brown said.
[34:03] The devil's got you beat on that one. He
[34:04] comes to church a lot more than some of
[34:06] y'all do.
[34:09] But right, that's it.
[34:11] You must have an experience of
[34:13] justification. You must have an
[34:16] experience of sanctification. And you
[34:18] definitely going to have to have an
[34:19] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[34:21] Spirit. You're going to have to see that
[34:23] your life has changed. Now listen. Yes.
[34:26] That don't kill all that that comes to
[34:28] you from all different sides. That's
[34:29] right. Don't think we're walking in
[34:31] perfection here. But let me tell you
[34:34] something. That guy down inside of here,
[34:36] whether you like it or not, as perfect
[34:37] as Dawn is, he never did anything wrong.
[34:40] He never said a bad word.
[34:43] The guy you're looking at here did.
[34:45] Okay? Cuz we're going to see something
[34:47] in a minute that come to light to me
[34:48] just the other day. But now, let's start
[34:50] our journey because really now this is
[34:52] our journey and this is where we begin.
[34:54] Now, I'm not going to draw all the
[34:55] virtues. We're just going to start all
[34:57] over again.
[35:10] Amen. Right.
[35:17] You can put it here or there. It doesn't
[35:18] matter. You remember, brother. Put it
[35:20] right here. Right. Right. Right.
[35:22] And we will for
[35:25] and then we're going to get rid of that
[35:27] and that
[35:29] cuz we got a captain stone that goes on
[35:31] there. All right. Now,
[35:37] now we start all over again.
[35:42] Why? Cuz we need it.
[35:46] Let's just be honest, people. Listen.
[35:50] You go home and you live with yourself.
[35:52] We can pretty oursel up.
[35:55] There's a guy that the guy I bought the
[35:57] house from, uh, well, it was Terrence,
[35:59] but the one before that was, uh, Jackie
[36:02] Seagers, and he usually sees me in my
[36:04] jeans and a t-shirt, and he come by and
[36:06] he said, "You sure clean up good?" And I
[36:08] thought, "Yeah, the outside man's as
[36:10] clean as you can get when you come to
[36:12] church." But what about the inside, man?
[36:14] That's right.
[36:17] What about your daily walk? You're the
[36:19] only one that knows.
[36:22] You can fool the preacher. You can f You
[36:25] can fool your fellow people most of the
[36:27] time, but you never can fool God. That's
[36:30] right. He's always there. Amen. He knows
[36:32] what you're thinking right now. Right.
[36:37] So, let's don't fool God. Let's just
[36:40] listen to what he said.
[36:42] So now the first stage we got what?
[36:44] There was three things, right?
[36:46] So God can't break his continuity.
[36:49] Right, Gary? He can't break his
[36:50] continuity. He's got to go back to
[36:52] threes again. All right, we're going to
[36:55] look at something here. We're going to
[36:56] kind of bring something out that maybe
[36:59] you haven't thought of before. And
[37:03] that will be
[37:05] we're going to go back to justification
[37:07] again. You say, "Well, brother, he's
[37:09] already chocked off my past sins." The
[37:11] prophet of God says Christians sin every
[37:14] day.
[37:19] Now, I'm not talking about sin down
[37:21] here.
[37:23] That's gone. Cut off. Everybody
[37:24] understand that? Amen.
[37:28] This is chopped off. What you If we
[37:29] could ever get to this part, it'll help.
[37:35] Ain't that right, brother? I mean,
[37:36] really, if we get a true revelation of
[37:38] justification,
[37:40] but you still got stages that you got to
[37:42] go through.
[37:43] Because this justification, then I
[37:46] realize that this guy did something,
[37:48] right? All right. Down here, I realize
[37:52] that what happened was gone, and I've
[37:54] got to clean myself up to go to the next
[37:57] step. And I may hear here, it may be
[38:00] cigarettes. Let's just take that for
[38:01] example. justification
[38:05] chopped off your past sins. But you know
[38:06] what? Tomorrow you going to light
[38:08] another cigarette up. Right. All right.
[38:11] Even in sanctification.
[38:13] But right there is really where
[38:15] everything that's why everybody takes
[38:16] this and thinks, "Well, that's the Holy
[38:18] Ghost cuz the snuff box went out the
[38:19] door." No. When I come back to the Lord
[38:22] that day, excuse me. I knew I chewed
[38:26] tobacco for 20 years every day just like
[38:29] cigarette smokers.
[38:32] But when God clean when God forgive me
[38:35] of my sin
[38:38] and I come out of that water the day
[38:39] that daddy baptized me in January there
[38:42] in 1998
[38:44] 8
[38:46] I knew I was on this journey because I
[38:48] felt cleaner than any day in my life. I
[38:50] felt like that water had washed
[38:52] everything away. But you know what? I
[38:54] didn't start shouting I've got the Holy
[38:56] Ghost.
[38:59] Right? when I started shouting that I
[39:01] had the Holy Ghost is when the word that
[39:03] I had held all those years I can only
[39:06] tell you my journey right
[39:09] the word that I had held all those years
[39:13] God started doing this right
[39:16] oh I can tell you by serpent seed
[39:18] serpent seed comes all the way down to
[39:20] this man not just what happened in the
[39:22] garden but God started bringing this
[39:24] word alive and that's when I started my
[39:27] journey that's when God came and filled
[39:29] me with the Holy Ghost and said, "Hey, I
[39:32] need you, knucklehead."
[39:36] But you know what? Even in here, I was
[39:39] still a knucklehead.
[39:42] Cuz God still had to say, "Hey, you did
[39:45] something wrong." Because then I can go
[39:46] back in the word and see that I did it
[39:48] wrong. I did something wrong. Amen.
[39:50] Okay. Now, not the smoking. No, now
[39:54] that's gone. You still You still smoking
[39:56] here. That means you're still here,
[39:58] right? Amen. I want us to realize that,
[40:01] you know, we're doing stuff, you know,
[40:02] we're still cursing and and all the
[40:04] things like that. You're still down
[40:05] here. That's right.
[40:08] Maybe you're in a journey. That's why I
[40:10] used to, you know, when you first become
[40:12] a Christian, and brother Joe, if you
[40:14] can, I know you can hear me. We're going
[40:15] to probably take two services on this
[40:17] one, then we won't do the other one cuz
[40:19] I I don't want to do be too long, but I
[40:21] want to get all these points. But we
[40:24] look at our journey and when we become
[40:28] saved
[40:30] cuz really like brother Brandon I was
[40:32] reading I've been going back in the 50s
[40:33] and reading some of the u prayer lines.
[40:36] You know it's a strange thing. He was a
[40:38] prophet. Come on. And he would bring
[40:42] those people up to that platform under
[40:45] the total anointing of the Holy Spirit
[40:47] and he'd say, "Lady said you got
[40:50] problems. Said your husband's dying of
[40:51] cancer." said, "Oh, I see you're a
[40:53] preacher."
[40:56] That's right. Now, that was God on the
[40:58] platform. God and a prophet. He never
[41:02] rebuked that woman for being a woman
[41:04] preacher. I never heard him say, "Oh,
[41:07] you don't need to do that no more."
[41:09] But we when we become saved,
[41:13] we become legalist.
[41:18] I have my hand way up there.
[41:22] Because what? We're still under what?
[41:25] The law. That's right. You're under the
[41:28] law until right here. Until you're born
[41:31] again, you're under the law. All right.
[41:34] Yes. But you don't do away with the law.
[41:36] You just magnify it and make it holy.
[41:38] I'm not finished yet. Don't think I'm
[41:40] doing away with the law. Come on. But
[41:42] you're all lawyers. You're all
[41:43] condemning everybody. And I did the same
[41:45] thing. But I but I kept watching that
[41:48] prophet and he was not sure. Now when he
[41:50] was preaching, see he say that's a
[41:52] different anointing.
[41:54] The anointing of preaching he can stand
[41:55] here and he say woman should not get in
[41:58] a pull vet. But now when that woman
[42:00] preacher walk up there under that
[42:02] anointing of the of the discernment he
[42:04] never rebuked her. He would even tell
[42:07] sinners he said you need to be saved.
[42:10] But he never would go through and he
[42:11] he'd say now you know what you done in
[42:12] your life now. You know, he was watching
[42:15] their life all the way back in that
[42:18] vision and he said, "Now, you know what
[42:21] you've done. You need to be saved." But
[42:23] he never, what I'm trying to say is
[42:24] brother Brandham, everybody said, "Well,
[42:26] Brother Brandham was a legalist and he
[42:27] was against this and against that." To
[42:30] me, um, I don't believe that. I believe
[42:33] Brother Brandham was the biggest,
[42:35] largest, greatest
[42:38] grace preacher I've ever heard of. Amen.
[42:41] Because if you don't take the grace that
[42:43] he brought you and I, we're all dead and
[42:45] gone.
[42:46] Cuz we can't live under Wesley's age or
[42:49] or Pentecostal. We've got to see the
[42:51] grace of God because all this right here
[42:53] is grace. God's grace that he justified
[42:57] you. His grace that he sanctified you
[42:59] and grace that he filled you with the
[43:00] Holy Spirit. Cuz none of us deserved it.
[43:04] But we all are lawyers. And that's not
[43:06] too bad. But don't let's don't stay that
[43:07] way. And let's don't keep preaching
[43:08] about hair and dress.
[43:11] Get the Holy Ghost. You won't have to
[43:13] preach about hair and dress. All right.
[43:16] I thought I was reading the other day,
[43:17] Brother said about St. Martin. He was
[43:19] not
[43:21] satisfied until every member of his
[43:22] church was filled with the Holy Ghost.
[43:25] You know, he probably still had
[43:26] problems, but he probably didn't have
[43:28] problems with dress and hair and little
[43:29] things like that because you get the
[43:31] Holy Ghost and you won't do those
[43:32] things, right? So, if you cut your hair,
[43:34] you ain't got the Holy Ghost. If you
[43:35] paint your face, you ain't got no hold.
[43:37] I mean, it's really simple to go through
[43:38] here and see that that this right here
[43:42] is now a work going out the other way.
[43:44] Everybody understand it's a work inward
[43:46] work going out. All right. That's why we
[43:49] come back to here because this right
[43:51] here is justification is is working on
[43:54] everything. Right? Now, we're going to
[43:56] go into the inner chamber where in the
[43:58] inner chamber, we're there alone with
[44:00] God,
[44:02] but we still got that thing that mama
[44:03] and daddy brought us here with. Okay.
[44:07] All right. We're still in this guy,
[44:08] right? But now listen, those who he has
[44:12] justified,
[44:14] don't lose that
[44:16] already. And I'm going to put it body,
[44:20] right?
[44:21] Cuz I'm going to tell you something. If
[44:22] you're truly justified today, right,
[44:25] that body I'm looking at, I'm going to
[44:28] look at for eternity at 20 years old.
[44:31] I'm not going to look at another body.
[44:33] That's right. So those who justified it,
[44:36] he's already glorified
[44:39] body. We just have not the devil that
[44:43] that's the devil. That's what he's
[44:44] doing. He's trying to cut us off like
[44:46] Daddy says, starting in the mind and
[44:48] working his way down. He's trying to get
[44:50] us to see that we're not worthy. We're
[44:53] not. That's right. Right. But if we go
[44:56] into here and see the word of God, the
[44:59] promises, I wrote promise right here on
[45:00] top of my Bible. All right. Looking down
[45:03] to that, those who glorified justified,
[45:05] he's already glorified. But we have to
[45:08] go through stages. The little baby
[45:10] girl's got everything she needs to
[45:11] produce children. But guess what? She
[45:14] can't bring a body
[45:16] until she gets to a stage. Right. Right.
[45:18] That's right. Right.
[45:19] can't bring you can't bring the word
[45:21] into reality until she gets to a certain
[45:24] stage. And that's the second stage we're
[45:25] going to work on here. Justification,
[45:29] working on not just chomping off these
[45:31] old sins here, but our daily walk, the
[45:36] daily living. This right here, all of
[45:39] these virtues, brother um
[45:45] what's his name? Keith Reed, he brought
[45:48] this here one time and that's exactly
[45:50] what they said. You can bundle all this
[45:53] up and right here. That's right. That's
[45:56] your trials of life. Right. Because I
[45:59] don't and I don't it's it's okay to draw
[46:02] these lines to to separate faith,
[46:05] virtue, knowledge. But to me that to me,
[46:08] brother D, take these lines out.
[46:11] Yeah. Cuz it's a blending and a molding
[46:14] of of you. a nature of you don't just
[46:17] get faith and brother Ren had to bring
[46:19] it as something we can understand like a
[46:21] step but it's not really just saying
[46:24] well I got faith now I got virtue now I
[46:28] got no no it's a blending together of
[46:32] all these virtues
[46:34] uh you don't leave faith down at the
[46:36] bottom right no we need faith right here
[46:39] we need more faith right here
[46:42] all right we need virtue here we got to
[46:45] have more virtue up here because
[46:47] remember this is nothing more but this
[46:49] in a small form this is a pyramid in
[46:52] itself the headstone right and you know
[46:55] what bring him right down here he's a
[46:57] corner that's exactly where you start
[46:59] from right here that little piece right
[47:01] there you can take and put it right
[47:03] there so he's the chief corner but he
[47:06] becomes the head all right everybody
[47:09] with me right
[47:12] justification
[47:16] We need it.
[47:18] Now,
[47:20] if we have the divine nature of God, he
[47:23] is obligated
[47:25] to bring these into our life and show
[47:29] them to us.
[47:31] But you and I can cut that off
[47:35] and and not go on with God because we
[47:38] see a lot of people uh and it's not a
[47:40] hindrance to say they died um because
[47:43] they all died in Christ if they're born
[47:45] again. Right. All right. But there is a
[47:47] group of people as long as I'm alive,
[47:49] I'm going to preach and I'm going to
[47:50] make it to here. Right. If I pass on,
[47:53] you can say, "Well, he didn't have
[47:54] enough to get himself to right here, but
[47:55] it was my problem."
[47:58] Amen. Right. I'm 50 years old.
[48:02] I got some work to be done.
[48:05] But with God's help, as long as I'm
[48:07] breathing, I'm going to try.
[48:11] My old football coach said, "Lead,
[48:13] follow, or get out of the way." That's
[48:14] right. Don't stand in somebody's way.
[48:16] God don't ever let you do that.
[48:19] Justification though, in the in the
[48:21] body, once you're in the body of Christ,
[48:23] you still have to watch yourself. You
[48:25] have to watch. And I I believe you're
[48:27] more aware here even than here of the
[48:30] things that happen in your life that you
[48:31] have to say, "God, I'm sorry. I didn't
[48:34] mean to do that." Amen.
[48:37] You know, here this, remember, this
[48:39] right here is a struggle. It's a fight
[48:40] when you're down here in your first part
[48:42] of your journey. Come on. And it don't
[48:44] get a lot easier up here. But at least
[48:45] you can take the at least you can take
[48:48] and go back to that typo is inside here
[48:52] and say, "God, you promised it right
[48:54] here in this word." Because remember
[48:56] down here, you're not in the family or
[48:58] the economy of God until you're born
[49:00] again. You're beginning, but you're not
[49:03] you cannot
[49:06] you cannot have the promises of God
[49:08] until you're right here. Mhm.
[49:12] No adoption. Amen. No virtues. Right.
[49:16] Right. You're out of the economy of God.
[49:18] Right.
[49:20] But when you come into faith, that's why
[49:22] it's real wide at the bottom cuz you
[49:24] need a lot of it. That's right. Amen.
[49:28] That's right. Don't we
[49:32] get narrower? Thank God.
[49:35] I told you I don't think I'm in
[49:36] godliness yet because I it's not I'm not
[49:39] just I'm not I'm not I just don't
[49:40] believe I'm there. And I sure need to be
[49:43] better to you guys to my brother and
[49:46] sisters. But at least I know I'm on a
[49:48] journey. Amen. Right. But I believe God
[49:52] takes us through these. But it's
[49:54] something that you and I have to do. We
[49:56] can't
[49:58] Paul says leaving the principles of the
[50:00] doctrine of Christ. Let's go into
[50:01] perfection. So we're just going to raise
[50:02] this and and drop it. That's your
[50:05] foundation.
[50:07] That's your foundation to work off of
[50:10] and then start building these little
[50:12] blocks. I like to put the real pyramid.
[50:14] It's got the blocks in it. That's the
[50:16] way I live. I don't live with these
[50:17] great big long lines. I live one little
[50:20] block at a time. All right.
[50:24] Like keeping my mouth shut, doing the
[50:27] right thing.
[50:28] Bless it. Really, right? When I should.
[50:31] Praise God. And talk when I should,
[50:33] right? Amen. When I should.
[50:37] And I really, like Brother Dick said,
[50:39] we're both highly opinionated. Brother
[50:42] Dick sometimes thinks I don't like him,
[50:43] but I really love him just like me.
[50:49] He just he just done it a little longer
[50:51] than that.
[50:57] I love all of you. You know what? I want
[50:59] us all to be here. You know, I and the
[51:02] things I do say to some of you and I
[51:04] really apologize for maybe the way I
[51:06] said it, but I don't apologize for what
[51:07] I say. Because if we can't do if we
[51:10] can't come to church on time, if we
[51:12] can't do the little things, God's not
[51:13] obligated to do any of this for us. Does
[51:16] everybody understand that? If we can't
[51:18] get to church on time and pray and and
[51:21] and be here and and be a part of the of
[51:24] the uh service and praise God and
[51:26] worship me, then you know what you've
[51:28] done? You put a cap That's right. on
[51:31] anything God can do for you. You have.
[51:34] We're talking about capping a pyramid
[51:36] off. You cap yourself off down here. And
[51:38] it's not a good thing to be down here
[51:40] and be capped cuz you what you do is you
[51:42] know what that cap is.
[51:47] It ain't a stepping stone. It's a
[51:48] tombstone.
[51:51] Little boy went by drove by a uh um
[51:57] out I guess he was riding by and the
[51:59] little boy looked out the window and
[52:01] said, "To daddy, I know why those heavy
[52:03] rocks are on top of those graves." And
[52:05] Dave said, "Why?" He says, "So the
[52:07] people can't get up."
[52:11] Well, guess what?
[52:13] There's a little truth to that.
[52:16] But it's one that we put on our head,
[52:18] right? Not the one that God puts on our
[52:20] head. God wants us all to come to
[52:22] perfection, right? Or he would not have
[52:24] give us, look people, he give us a road
[52:27] map, which is the Bible. Then he give us
[52:30] I want to say the message to me is like
[52:32] Google Earth.
[52:35] round ball and you can zoom right down
[52:37] to where you live. You can see the doors
[52:40] and the windows. Well, guess what?
[52:41] That's what this message done. It zoomed
[52:43] everything down. Oh my on a life live.
[52:48] Amen. As an individual,
[52:51] okay,
[52:52] these trials of life, we go through
[52:54] justification. We have to have our sins
[52:56] forgiven every day. All right. Now, yet
[53:01] you're filled with the Holy Ghost. And
[53:03] right here, don't get me wrong, right
[53:05] here, you're you're born again. You're
[53:07] ready to go
[53:09] to heaven and be have an eternal
[53:12] glorified body. Right? But
[53:17] that's why Paul said, "Let's go on to
[53:19] what? Perfection." Right? Okay.
[53:23] This is not perfection, right? Right.
[53:28] It was for the other ages, right? But
[53:30] it's not perfection for you and I.
[53:34] That's why we have to live higher and
[53:36] better. That don't mean we walk around
[53:38] with a stuffed shirt and we're better
[53:40] than anybody else. There's no difference
[53:42] in me and Adolf Hitler. He said, "But
[53:46] Adolf Hitler turned God down and I did."
[53:48] Right. Amen. That's it. I'm sure that
[53:51] you know Adolf Hitler had a little Jew
[53:52] in him. You You know that, don't you? He
[53:54] was Jewish. His background was Judas and
[53:56] they said he read the Bible, but
[53:59] somewhere, you know, God came to him and
[54:00] he turned it down. And you see what
[54:02] happened? He may have even come here and
[54:05] here. And guess what filled that up?
[54:09] Seven devils. That's right. Worse than
[54:12] he was the first time. We don't
[54:14] understand people that we look at all
[54:16] these people in history and we look at
[54:17] all these people down through time.
[54:20] They're just like you and I. God has to
[54:22] come to them in a way to say, "Hey, yes,
[54:25] I can save you if you'll let me."
[54:28] Exactly. Because that would be a
[54:29] respector of persons if he did. Okay.
[54:32] So, that makes us dig where I'm not no
[54:35] better, right, than Adolf Hitler, right?
[54:38] It's just that I accepted God and he
[54:40] come down and done a work and then he
[54:43] let the devil do a work. All right. Same
[54:46] thing with Judas's care. Right. Right.
[54:49] Brother Brown said Judas was under the
[54:51] sanctification that Jesus gave him. He
[54:54] sent him out to do mighty miracles and
[54:56] mighty works. But look what he done. He
[55:00] let that devil come right back in. You
[55:02] know what he said? I'm in the message. I
[55:04] believe what Jesus said. You know what
[55:07] he said? He said, "Let's get on with
[55:09] it." Right? And he went to sell Jesus
[55:12] out. Cuz I believe, this is my point
[55:14] with Judas. I believe he thought Jesus
[55:17] was something. But before his time,
[55:20] before his time, he went to the priest
[55:23] and said, "Hey,
[55:24] this guy says he's this. I want you to
[55:27] prove it." Right? I want you to do
[55:29] something to him and let him say it.
[55:31] Because see, remember, even the other
[55:32] 11, right, didn't have a clue that Jud
[55:35] Judas was doing what he was doing.
[55:38] So, he must have been a pretty good
[55:39] church member,
[55:42] right? I'm telling you people, we going
[55:43] to find out a lot. It takes a lot of
[55:46] people
[55:47] I'm going to say half the people in this
[55:49] message are running around sanctified
[55:52] and don't have a clue about this
[55:53] message. What's really going on in this
[55:56] message of the baptism of the Holy
[55:59] Ghost? And we wouldn't act like we do
[56:00] sometimes. Oh my. Amen. Come on people,
[56:03] fear not little flock. Amen. People are
[56:05] building big churches and three and 400
[56:07] people in the message. what I was trying
[56:09] to get them preachers. They one
[56:11] preacher, he's got a couple hundred in
[56:13] his church and he said, "Why are my
[56:15] people still acting the way they're
[56:16] acting?" I kept pointing back to this. I
[56:18] went,
[56:20] "Right." I finally said, "Brother," I
[56:22] said, "They're just not all born again."
[56:24] That's right. Right. You know, I don't
[56:26] think he accepted that, but you know
[56:27] what? I said it in just as much love as
[56:29] I could.
[56:32] Justification.
[56:35] Now, sanctification.
[56:37] Paul said, "I die daily." We know right
[56:39] here that the old man died, right? We
[56:42] become a new creature. That's right. In
[56:44] Christ Jesus. All right. But
[56:48] I still want to be clean and set aside
[56:50] for more service of God. And the only
[56:52] way he's going to clean me and put me in
[56:54] service is he's going to have to give me
[56:56] these virtues. That's right. Knowledge,
[56:58] temperance, patience, godliness. Because
[57:01] remember here we go to again this is
[57:04] very very
[57:06] horrible place to stay. Guess what you
[57:10] come back to right here. Yep. That's a
[57:13] horrible place to stay. Right. Mhm.
[57:16] Because you can think you're somewhere
[57:18] else, right? And just be right there.
[57:20] That's right. I die daily.
[57:24] Faith, virtue, knowledge. Because what
[57:27] did brother Brown say? He said power
[57:32] without what
[57:35] these characters is the pain
[57:40] and that could work on the outside guy.
[57:44] That's why you see a lot of things
[57:45] happen to people in the message.
[57:47] Now you say, "Well, why you got quiet on
[57:49] that one?" But let me tell you
[57:50] something. Brother Brandham made a
[57:52] statement one time. He said there was a
[57:55] preacher,
[57:57] remember, that went over to the black
[57:59] man at the store and said, "I'm done
[58:02] with religion. Buy me some beer." Right.
[58:06] Right. Brother Brandham said, "God took
[58:09] his servant home." So, he had to be
[58:11] around here somewhere. God took his
[58:14] servant home so he wouldn't mar his
[58:16] name. Right.
[58:19] Yep. Where was he at? Yep. He was done.
[58:23] I've done all I can do. I'm finished
[58:25] with it. He let a devil come in. You
[58:28] going to see a lot of people, that's why
[58:29] a lot of people have to go by the grave
[58:31] because they can't get all this out of
[58:33] them. Why? Because this is what cleaned
[58:36] and set aside for God to put you in some
[58:38] other service besides down here. Mhm. A
[58:41] deeper service. Maybe not another ser
[58:43] service, but a deeper service.
[58:47] You're thinking about that one, aren't
[58:48] you?
[58:50] We got it all when we down here, guys.
[58:53] But I'm going to tell you something.
[58:55] I like brother Jim Kingston. He He's
[58:57] He's a little bit more harsh than I am
[58:59] out in Witchaw. We email each other back
[59:01] and forth every once in a while. He
[59:03] don't mind calling people's name
[59:06] and certain people died out in in
[59:11] Missouri or somewhere. And buddy, he he
[59:13] told him he called the guy's name. And
[59:16] he said, "God took that man off the
[59:17] scene cuz he was messing up." In other
[59:20] words, he was messing up the scene, but
[59:22] he was a godly man. But there was some
[59:23] things he was doing.
[59:26] That's why I'm telling you people,
[59:29] this thing's not over until it's over.
[59:32] The devil can still anoint you on the
[59:36] outside and you can still have the Holy
[59:39] Spirit inside. What do you think about
[59:42] You think, let me give you another
[59:43] example. Um,
[59:46] say if a person, say if say if somebody
[59:48] came up to me and hit me in the head and
[59:50] it changed some chemical imbalance in my
[59:52] body, which I've seen it done to an
[59:54] older gentleman one time, and he just
[59:56] started cursing like crazy. And I
[59:57] believe he was a born again Christian
[59:58] man, right? Just lived 50 years for God.
[1:00:02] Something happened to his body and it
[1:00:04] brought all that stuff up and of course
[1:00:08] he died. But we we got to look and see.
[1:00:11] That's why I want you to see that
[1:00:13] there's three stages here to put you in
[1:00:14] the body. Three stages here to get you
[1:00:18] higher, right? But let's look at it for
[1:00:21] a second.
[1:00:22] Think about that though. We always say
[1:00:25] all power without character satanic.
[1:00:26] That must be the antichrist.
[1:00:29] I don't know people. There's something
[1:00:31] about that right there. This same
[1:00:33] mystery is about something about that
[1:00:34] day. Yes, sir. That's right. that that
[1:00:36] things can happen in our outside being
[1:00:38] that we can be overtaken by a devil and
[1:00:41] still be still be born again. Why did
[1:00:45] why did um the Bible even tells, you
[1:00:48] know, to turn somebody over to the
[1:00:49] devil, right? So that their soul can be
[1:00:52] saved. Is that what it say? Well, that
[1:00:53] must be somebody up here. That ain't
[1:00:55] somebody down here. That's somebody
[1:00:56] that's already in the body of Christ.
[1:00:59] That's what I mean. Look now, I can take
[1:01:02] this right here
[1:01:04] and I'm not so much in law now. I have
[1:01:08] grace for everybody. Even if somebody's
[1:01:10] wrong, even if somebody wrongs me or
[1:01:12] even if I see somebody wrong somebody
[1:01:14] else, I know it's the devil, it's not
[1:01:16] that person, right? Okay. That's right.
[1:01:19] So, don't count everybody out that we're
[1:01:21] trying to count out. Okay? It's not us
[1:01:24] to do the separating. It's God to do the
[1:01:25] separating. That's right. Right.
[1:01:27] Everybody okay? Amen. Amen. All right.
[1:01:31] Now, let's look and see just for a
[1:01:34] minute. Let's stop right here because in
[1:01:37] these trials of life, this is a real
[1:01:38] journey. But now, what's God going to do
[1:01:42] is he begins
[1:01:45] something that
[1:01:47] they really didn't see u much. I don't
[1:01:51] think what I was talking about down.
[1:01:54] I hope they don't hear this.
[1:01:59] But it's hard to see because brother Ram
[1:02:01] comes in and he he talks about a
[1:02:04] a white horse rider
[1:02:07] and then a red horse rider,
[1:02:11] right?
[1:02:13] And then a black
[1:02:18] and then a pair.
[1:02:23] Okay.
[1:02:26] And we want to take this and and brother
[1:02:28] Random does, but I believe this is a
[1:02:30] mystery that that's hid to a lot of
[1:02:32] people is that we don't get what brother
[1:02:36] Random was talking about when he was
[1:02:39] talking about the white horse rider.
[1:02:41] Now, you got to go back and look in the
[1:02:44] message and see that the seals
[1:02:49] does not glorify
[1:02:52] the devil.
[1:02:54] Right.
[1:02:56] The seals glorify Jesus Christ. In other
[1:02:59] words, brings him out in the open.
[1:03:03] Expose the devil for sure. But how do
[1:03:06] you expose the devil? You bring Jesus
[1:03:08] Christ out on the sand. Listen,
[1:03:12] right? Here's your key. Power was given
[1:03:19] to that white horse rider. Right. Read
[1:03:21] your Bible. We're not going to read it
[1:03:22] time. Power was given to the red horse
[1:03:25] rider. Right. Right. Power was given.
[1:03:30] Now,
[1:03:31] let's go and flip this thing around
[1:03:33] because brother Brandham said God always
[1:03:37] does something and then the devil comes
[1:03:38] and copies it. Right. We always want to
[1:03:42] stay on the seals and go, "What? What?
[1:03:43] What's wrong with the Antichrist?" Well,
[1:03:46] guess what? in your journey. The first
[1:03:50] thing God does,
[1:03:52] you know,
[1:03:54] he shows you that you're righteous.
[1:03:57] Right. You are what? We know this is
[1:04:01] false. That's right. But God has to do
[1:04:04] something first. Amen. Before the devil
[1:04:06] can imitate coming behind, right? So
[1:04:09] that so God rides out. He rode out in
[1:04:11] that first church age. God rode first.
[1:04:14] He come on the day of Pentecost. Then
[1:04:16] the devil come down. Right. Right. Are
[1:04:18] we going to give the devil all the
[1:04:20] glory? No.
[1:04:23] Because when you come to right here,
[1:04:27] this is what I see for me.
[1:04:31] God shows begins to show me his
[1:04:34] righteousness, but it's blending into
[1:04:36] what I'm doing. Makes me righteous.
[1:04:39] shows me that that that white horse
[1:04:41] rider,
[1:04:43] remember, rode away. Why? He couldn't
[1:04:45] stand where he was at.
[1:04:48] Right. He was riding away. He wasn't
[1:04:51] riding toward. He was riding away from
[1:04:53] that lamb.
[1:04:55] Right here, people. The lamb comes on
[1:04:57] the throne right there. Right. Lamb
[1:04:59] comes on the throne at your new birth.
[1:05:02] Gives you the Holy Ghost and he sits
[1:05:04] down on that throne. Then what happens?
[1:05:08] That's what happens in the virtues. All
[1:05:12] these bad guys start riding off. But
[1:05:15] who's on the scene first, right? God.
[1:05:20] God shows you
[1:05:23] that you're just as righteous
[1:05:26] as he is.
[1:05:28] That's the second mystery of
[1:05:29] justification
[1:05:31] down here. You know you're a sinner,
[1:05:34] right? Nobody has to tell you that. You
[1:05:36] know that. That's right. But when you be
[1:05:38] become born again, God starts revealing
[1:05:43] his righteousness to you. That's right.
[1:05:47] Okay.
[1:05:51] Red horse.
[1:05:53] And what happened when that red horse
[1:05:56] rode out?
[1:05:57] He killed
[1:06:00] people, right? That's why the horse was
[1:06:02] red. Right.
[1:06:06] And what does he do? What sanctifies
[1:06:08] you?
[1:06:11] What color is blood?
[1:06:14] So this can show you that the blood of
[1:06:16] Jesus Christ
[1:06:21] comes and sanctifies you and then there
[1:06:23] goes that red horse rider right away.
[1:06:26] You got to see him going away from you.
[1:06:28] It doesn't do you any good to see him
[1:06:29] going away from the prophet. You're back
[1:06:31] down here again. Right.
[1:06:34] Amen. Amen.
[1:06:37] But let's take the seals and and let's
[1:06:40] make them cuz people read the seals. The
[1:06:42] white horse rider was the antichrist,
[1:06:43] red horse rider with the antichrist,
[1:06:44] black horse, antichrist. I agree 100%.
[1:06:49] But you got to see these going away from
[1:06:51] you. So seeing them going away from you,
[1:06:53] you got to see that God's doing
[1:06:55] something to make them ride away from
[1:06:58] you.
[1:06:59] Right. Is everybody okay? Right.
[1:07:03] We'll stop in a minute. and then we'll
[1:07:04] go up higher later on this afternoon.
[1:07:07] Brother Joe, just put part two on this
[1:07:09] afternoon cuz we won't get to the other
[1:07:11] one we're going to do. Okay, but that's
[1:07:12] okay. I hope this is helping somebody.
[1:07:15] Amen. Amen. Because brother, you got to
[1:07:19] see that white horse right away from
[1:07:20] you. But you got to see that is a devil
[1:07:24] trying to trick you. But you still got
[1:07:26] to see once you're in the economy of
[1:07:28] God, he's obligated.
[1:07:31] If you'll do what he says, he's
[1:07:32] obligated
[1:07:34] to make you white. Amen. That's right.
[1:07:37] I'm talking about working out through
[1:07:38] this other guy. The one your mom and
[1:07:40] daddy gave you. Right. Right. Right.
[1:07:44] Red is what? Blood.
[1:07:47] What did Brother Rom say? Jesus's blood
[1:07:49] dropped on the earth and done what?
[1:07:51] Sanctified it. That's why we have to
[1:07:54] come to this degree right here and see
[1:07:56] that it's the blood of Jesus Christ, not
[1:07:58] the blood of a man. Amen.
[1:08:01] But God,
[1:08:03] Jesus was not just divine. He was
[1:08:05] almighty God.
[1:08:07] From blood all the way Yes, sir. to the
[1:08:10] hair on the top of your head. If that
[1:08:12] wasn't the blood of God that died for me
[1:08:14] and you, then we need somebody else.
[1:08:16] Right.
[1:08:21] Now,
[1:08:26] what does black represent?
[1:08:28] Death.
[1:08:30] We name that sucker now. He's death.
[1:08:35] When you come to here, he's dead.
[1:08:43] Right. We're all dead.
[1:08:48] When you come to right here,
[1:08:51] we're all dead. Right. Cuz the old man's
[1:08:54] dying,
[1:08:56] I die daily. But see, brother Ram said
[1:08:59] that's why he said you come up here and
[1:09:00] you don't have the Holy Spirit yet.
[1:09:03] That's true. But he says in the true
[1:09:05] baptism. Now you say, well that's from
[1:09:07] false that this was a false baptism. No,
[1:09:10] that was just more
[1:09:12] of what he already said.
[1:09:16] But there's more of this. And he said
[1:09:17] little waves, right, running down
[1:09:22] the Holy Spirit coming down through
[1:09:23] Christ. Holy Spirit. Christ is doing
[1:09:25] what? He's killing us. Cuz right here,
[1:09:28] you're going to see Christ, not
[1:09:29] yourself. That's right. If you still see
[1:09:32] yourself right here,
[1:09:36] right? Amen. Come on, people.
[1:09:42] Look like a mess. I hope you understand.
[1:09:46] You want to see what was up here before
[1:09:47] I wrote that downstairs? We've been
[1:09:49] going through Daniel 70 weeks, and it
[1:09:51] looked pretty messy, too. But you know
[1:09:52] what? Every time there's a birth,
[1:09:54] there's a mess. Right. Right. That's
[1:09:57] right. Water, blood, and life. I hope
[1:09:59] this gives life to somebody or it'll
[1:10:00] help you a little bit. Amen. But we see
[1:10:03] now that you say, "Well, you got one
[1:10:05] more because remember,
[1:10:07] you got four
[1:10:09] death messengers,
[1:10:11] which are these guys, but you got to
[1:10:13] have four life messengers, right? To
[1:10:16] bring it back, but you say you got four.
[1:10:18] You said you perfect were perfected in
[1:10:20] three." What is this right here? What is
[1:10:23] that? Y if you take white, red and black
[1:10:27] and mix them all together, you get pale.
[1:10:31] Take it sometime. Take white and red and
[1:10:33] black, mix it up in a paint can, what do
[1:10:35] you get? Pale.
[1:10:38] So justification, sanctification,
[1:10:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost makes way for
[1:10:42] what? The Holy Ghost himself. All this
[1:10:45] mixed in together brings one man. Right?
[1:10:51] Then you can take it and you can show
[1:10:53] how the lion and we'll do that this
[1:10:55] afternoon, but we'll stop now because
[1:10:57] remember, you got a lion, an ox, a man,
[1:11:02] and an eagle,
[1:11:04] right? Can't forget those four guys, but
[1:11:06] they're the ones that kill all this,
[1:11:09] we'll talk about that this afternoon.
[1:11:11] Listen,
[1:11:13] magicians, come. We'll just stop right
[1:11:16] there. That way we'll have will be okay
[1:11:18] for this afternoon. Everybody all right?
[1:11:23] This may be cut and dried, but you know
[1:11:25] what? I'm a teacher and I can't help it.
[1:11:26] I can't make you I can give you some ice
[1:11:29] cubes if you want something to go up
[1:11:30] down your spine, but
[1:11:32] it wouldn't be God. It'd be me.
[1:11:35] [Music]
[1:11:39] We're not established on this word of
[1:11:41] God. People, we will be deceived.
[1:11:47] Call it whatever you want to call it. We
[1:11:49] will be deceived if we are not walking
[1:11:52] in the word of God. Amen. And let me
[1:11:55] tell you something again, people. If you
[1:11:56] can't see your life, brother, if you
[1:11:58] can't see your life in that journey,
[1:12:02] please don't leave this building. Don't
[1:12:04] go to sleep. Don't eat another bite
[1:12:07] until you realize, Amen. that God's
[1:12:10] doing that right there. Because you know
[1:12:11] what? That's the truth, people. I
[1:12:12] believe that's the truth. I believe
[1:12:13] God's told you exactly how he's going to
[1:12:15] bring you right up through that. Not
[1:12:17] just say justification. I mean, not just
[1:12:19] say faith, virtue, knowledge. That's
[1:12:20] what's all in that. Amen. That's right.
[1:12:23] But it's in a little different way that
[1:12:24] you can see how God is working on you by
[1:12:28] just three
[1:12:30] three things. Justification,
[1:12:32] sanctification, and you know what? When
[1:12:34] he brings the headstone, he's going to
[1:12:35] bring you through justification.
[1:12:37] Sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:12:39] Holy Spirit. And that'll be the
[1:12:41] culmination. And he will sit that thing
[1:12:43] right down on top of you.
[1:12:46] And like brother Brown said, let me read
[1:12:47] this one
[1:12:51] statue of a perfect man.
[1:12:53] Now that is the house that God dwells
[1:12:55] in. Not a building with a big bell on
[1:12:56] top of it and a high steeple. But a body
[1:12:58] hast thou prepared me? A body that God
[1:13:01] can dwell in, God can walk in, God can
[1:13:04] see in, God can talk in, God can work
[1:13:07] in. Amen. living instrumentality of God.
[1:13:10] God walking on two feet in you. Glory.
[1:13:14] The footstep of the righteous is ordered
[1:13:16] of God. God walking in you. For you are
[1:13:18] written epistles read of all men. And if
[1:13:19] the life that's in Christ be in you,
[1:13:22] you'll bear the life
[1:13:25] that Christ bore.
[1:13:27] We're going to see this afternoon that
[1:13:30] we know that when we started on that
[1:13:32] journey, the real you did what you did.
[1:13:34] Mhm. Then we're going to see that it was
[1:13:37] as if you never done it because you know
[1:13:39] you did it, but you went through this
[1:13:40] journey and God is is is taking all that
[1:13:43] out of you. But you're going to have to
[1:13:44] come to a place to realize. Let me give
[1:13:47] you a little let me give you a point to
[1:13:48] ponder until afternoon.
[1:13:54] When Jesus was in the garden,
[1:13:58] Peter was standing beside of him.
[1:14:01] the temple guards come to get him.
[1:14:04] Right? It wasn't the Romans. It was the
[1:14:06] temple guards cuz he said, "Why didn't
[1:14:07] you come get me now? Why didn't you
[1:14:09] arrest me when I was in the temple?" So,
[1:14:10] it was the temple guards that was coming
[1:14:12] to come to get him. Remember, one guy
[1:14:15] reaches to get Jesus and Peter pulls a
[1:14:17] sword, cuts the ear,
[1:14:22] right?
[1:14:24] What does Jesus do?
[1:14:28] He reaches down, he restores the ear as
[1:14:30] if it never happened.
[1:14:34] Cuz I don't believe there was blood all
[1:14:36] over that man. When he restored, what he
[1:14:38] done? He picked that ear up and he
[1:14:40] showed that me and you. Amen. When God
[1:14:42] touches us, he don't restore us to where
[1:14:45] there's still blood on that man's
[1:14:47] clothes. I believe he restored that man
[1:14:48] back to before his ear was cut off.
[1:14:50] That's right. I know it depicts it in
[1:14:53] all the other that's the only way they
[1:14:54] can depict it in place. But why would
[1:14:56] you think God could pick up an ear, put
[1:14:58] it back on, there still be blood all
[1:14:59] over the man? I don't believe that.
[1:15:03] But the temple guard saw it.
[1:15:06] Peter saw it. The crowd saw it. But when
[1:15:10] that man went back to tell his story,
[1:15:15] nobody saw it. Amen. It was as if he
[1:15:17] never done it. That's right. That's
[1:15:19] where you got to see people that God put
[1:15:21] me in you. He took pieces and when he
[1:15:24] touches you,
[1:15:26] he don't leave you halfway.
[1:15:29] He takes care of every bit of it. Let's
[1:15:31] sing a song. We'll talk about it this
[1:15:33] afternoon.
[1:15:35] 37.
[1:15:39] Have I own
[1:15:51] [Music]
[1:16:00] A
[1:16:13] heat.
[1:16:23] [Music]

[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:20:56] That's a very fitting song. It is
[1:20:59] because a lot of times and and we'll
[1:21:00] kind of cover it this afternoon. It's
[1:21:02] it's it's in my notes to cover this
[1:21:05] morning, but I kept it till this
[1:21:06] afternoon.
[1:21:08] It's a fight.
[1:21:11] This is not a picnic. A battle.
[1:21:14] And it's a battle that you and I can't
[1:21:16] fight. That's right.
[1:21:18] If you just turn it over to God,
[1:21:22] that's our problem. That's my problem.
[1:21:26] My problem is I try to fight my own
[1:21:27] battles.
[1:21:30] Brother Richard, that's the truth. I
[1:21:31] mean, I'm I'm being just as honest as I
[1:21:33] can be. I try to fight my own battles
[1:21:35] and I lose a lot of them. But if we'll
[1:21:38] quit fighting and let God do the
[1:21:41] fighting for us. You say, "How?" to
[1:21:44] strengthen brethren through strengthen
[1:21:45] the word to strengthen listening. You
[1:21:47] know, brother Brandham made a profound
[1:21:49] statement.
[1:21:50] He said, "If you're stinging, give your
[1:21:53] money away."
[1:21:56] He said, "Just do the vice versa." Now,
[1:21:58] that's a prophet telling you. You know,
[1:22:01] somebody asked him said, "Bro, what do
[1:22:02] you do if you stand you?" He said,
[1:22:04] "Start giving money away."
[1:22:06] He said, "If you're backwards toward
[1:22:07] people," he said, "Start doing the vice
[1:22:09] versa. Just start being happy." And you
[1:22:11] know, he didn't go to the word. He
[1:22:14] didn't go to here. He didn't, you know,
[1:22:15] but I believe that comes from heaven.
[1:22:18] Just do the vice versa. Mhm. You know,
[1:22:21] if you're stubborn
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:27] stubborn, just start giving in. Start
[1:22:29] giving in. Right. Start saying, "Okay,
[1:22:31] all right."
[1:22:34] I'm telling you what the prophet said.
[1:22:37] He said to do the vice versa. You know
[1:22:40] that's the truth because you get up in
[1:22:41] the morning, you say, "Well, I don't
[1:22:42] want to go to church. I don't want to do
[1:22:43] this." Go. Cuz who's telling you that?
[1:22:46] Is it God telling you not to go? I don't
[1:22:49] think so.
[1:22:51] I've come to the conclusion the devil's
[1:22:52] a liar. Amen. And he can't do anything
[1:22:55] but lie.
[1:22:56] Even when he tells the truth, he's
[1:22:58] lying.
[1:23:00] Cuz he told Jesus, he did the same
[1:23:01] thing. You know, he took Jesus on the
[1:23:03] mountain and on the temple and said he
[1:23:05] quoted the scripture to him. But he
[1:23:07] quoted it in the wrong time, in the
[1:23:10] wrong place. In other words, he told him
[1:23:12] what the word said. It's like daddy said
[1:23:14] the other night, "Brother Brown," you
[1:23:16] can take him back and said, "Brother
[1:23:17] Brown, you said this verbatim right
[1:23:18] here." And he said, "Oh, I didn't say
[1:23:21] that.
[1:23:23] Jesus Christ said one time, baptized in
[1:23:25] the name of the Father and of the Son
[1:23:27] and of the Holy Ghost." Right. And
[1:23:29] they'll quote you that and they'll say,
[1:23:30] "That's what Jesus said." That's right.
[1:23:32] But that ain't what Jesus said. That's
[1:23:34] right. That's right. Right. That's
[1:23:36] right. So, you know, so was it then, so
[1:23:38] is it now? If you don't have the Holy
[1:23:41] Spirit,
[1:23:42] the devil's doing anything. Let's say
[1:23:44] we're standing on holy ground.
[1:23:48] I believe we are. Hallelujah.
[1:23:50] We walk on this earth. We're just like
[1:23:51] Abraham. We have a possession. We're
[1:23:54] going to rule this earth. Yes, we are
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:24:01] a holy Christ.

[1:25:21] Come on. Go. Take that hand and lay it
[1:25:23] over on somebody.
[1:25:27] Reach and touch somebody
[1:25:30] up here. Will you please
[1:25:35] just have it on my heart? Somebody's
[1:25:37] sick. Somebody needs healing. Somebody
[1:25:41] needs a touch from God. I don't care
[1:25:42] what it is. Reach over and put your hand
[1:25:44] on somebody and bow your head. Dear
[1:25:47] heavenly father, thank you.
[1:25:51] You've impressed us to do this for some
[1:25:53] reason. Lord,
[1:25:55] I pray father that whatever it is
[1:25:58] that you'll show fruit
[1:26:01] because Lord something you told me to do
[1:26:04] Lord just now. And I pray, Father, that
[1:26:07] you'll touch each one from the musicians
[1:26:09] behind, Lord, all the way from
[1:26:11] downstairs, wherever somebody's
[1:26:13] standing, Lord, that there truly are
[1:26:16] angels standing here ready to minister
[1:26:18] healing, ready to bring that burning
[1:26:21] coal off the fire and touch our lips,
[1:26:25] Lord. And as Isaiah screamed, I am of
[1:26:28] unclean lips.
[1:26:31] But that angel came down and put it on
[1:26:33] his lips and said, "Prophesy. Preach.
[1:26:36] Tell the world
[1:26:38] about this great gospel that we have a
[1:26:40] hold of."
[1:26:42] Father, as we lay hands on each other,
[1:26:44] that angels will touch, Lord, and
[1:26:46] minister to each person. Father, forgive
[1:26:49] us of our sins and our mistakes, Lord,
[1:26:50] the things that we do wrong. We ask your
[1:26:53] forgiveness, Lord. Take us all up to
[1:26:56] that statue of a perfect man. Lord, if
[1:26:58] we're not filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:27:00] Lord, fill us complete, Lord.
[1:27:03] Justify us, Lord. Sanctify us. Clean us
[1:27:05] up. Wash us by the water of your word,
[1:27:08] Lord. Be with each one, Father.
[1:27:12] We're all getting old, Lord. We all need
[1:27:15] you more for the things than we do each
[1:27:18] day.
[1:27:19] I pray now, Lord, that you touch each
[1:27:22] person in this building.
[1:27:24] Open the eyes of the ones that can't
[1:27:26] see, the ears of the ones that can't
[1:27:28] hear naturally and spiritually.
[1:27:32] Lord, as a surge goes through the
[1:27:34] building, Father, may you heal each one.
[1:27:39] Mold us and make us into what you want
[1:27:40] us to be, Lord.
[1:27:42] Till we come back this afternoon, Lord,
[1:27:45] may we live under this shower of
[1:27:47] blessing, Lord, as you give us.
[1:27:50] Give us our daily bread, Lord. forgive
[1:27:52] us of our trespass
[1:27:54] in Jesus name we ask.
[1:27:56] Amen. Go all around your want to go.
