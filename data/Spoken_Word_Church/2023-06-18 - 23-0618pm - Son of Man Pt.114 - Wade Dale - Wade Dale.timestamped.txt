[16:16] [Music]
[16:19] [Applause]
[16:24] [Music]
[16:30] [Applause]
[16:35] [Music]
[16:38] Jesus
[16:41] hey man let's give him a big hand clap
[16:43] for nothing
[16:47] but you know brother Bradham tells us
[16:50] that we are the blood
[16:53] by the spirit
[16:55] by the spirit of God dwelling inside of
[16:57] us it makes us the blood
[17:00] because you know what people are going
[17:02] to get saved because of you
[17:04] the Bible says whatever you say
[17:07] if you've done it to the least of my
[17:08] little ones you've done unto me so
[17:10] salvation
[17:12] comes through the bride
[17:14] amen that's why that we
[17:18] that's why that we come to church we we
[17:20] try to get rid of all the junk that
[17:22] we've got out in the world and we try to
[17:24] uh
[17:25] try I say we all try to be Godly as much
[17:28] as we can
[17:29] but you got to remember like I've been
[17:31] trying to tell you you're trying to put
[17:34] something so high that you can't attain
[17:38] to and you can't
[17:39] like the song says this is all my
[17:41] righteousness it just goes so far all
[17:44] right but the blood of Jesus Christ if
[17:46] we'll give it to him
[17:47] let him cover you eradicate it take it
[17:51] away
[17:52] and let the father do it
[17:54] let the Daddy clean you up by the
[17:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the
[17:59] whole thing and so it's saying today
[18:01] we just got to realize we either we got
[18:04] it or we don't
[18:06] you just got you've got to come to that
[18:08] in the quietness of your home or in
[18:10] church or somewhere you got to know that
[18:13] you know that you know
[18:15] that you're born again
[18:17] because if you're not born again
[18:20] you just
[18:23] you're not gonna be there
[18:24] I'm just sorry you're just not just
[18:26] you're gonna fall off somewhere
[18:29] okay
[18:30] the Bible tells us is what you know what
[18:32] in other words what are we doing we
[18:34] can't even keep up with the foot
[18:35] shoulders when the when the horses are
[18:38] coming
[18:38] so we got to get ready to where we can
[18:40] fly with the Infantry we can go with the
[18:43] we can go with the calvary amen so
[18:46] that's the same with us uh the
[18:48] acceleration of the word
[18:50] ought to be to where that we're like man
[18:53] we're on the edge
[18:55] we're just on the verge of something
[18:58] we're on the verge of breaking through
[18:59] something somewhere because you know
[19:01] what has got to happen
[19:03] it's got to happen and it's going to
[19:05] happen to a group of people we might as
[19:07] well just say it's us
[19:08] a man like I said this morning we gotta
[19:12] have a Doctrine every Church you got a
[19:14] Doctrine all right our Doctrine is that
[19:16] you got to come to the Statue of perfect
[19:17] man to be a walking walking breathing
[19:21] instrumentality of God to be what God
[19:23] wants you to be you got to go up that
[19:25] statue of perfect man you've got to
[19:27] fight
[19:28] for for virtue knowledge temples
[19:30] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[19:32] and you know what God's been pleased to
[19:34] adopt you
[19:36] yeah
[19:36] um
[19:37] let's listen to a minister not too long
[19:39] ago and and it's okay to roll the new
[19:42] birth in with adoption but remember
[19:44] brother Brown said it's two different
[19:45] things
[19:47] your birth and your adoption is two
[19:49] different things
[19:50] amen it's just like the saved and and
[19:52] and and and uh born again you can be
[19:55] saved not be born again but you can't be
[19:57] born again and not be saved well same
[19:59] way with the um
[20:01] with what we just said you there's just
[20:04] you can't be adopted without being born
[20:06] again but you can be born again without
[20:07] being adopted
[20:09] all right but that's going to put you in
[20:12] a place to where you're not going you're
[20:13] going to be unfulfilled
[20:15] you're going to have an unfulfilled
[20:16] Christian life and you're not going to
[20:19] take the body change you're gonna have
[20:20] to go by the grave so brother Dale's
[20:22] taught us that for years and years and
[20:24] years right so it's nothing new
[20:26] so happy Father's Day again brother
[20:28] Louise should be speaking Wednesday
[20:29] night remember Bob and Louise coming
[20:32] back from speaking
[20:34] and all the ones on vacation uh Anna and
[20:37] Richard and Aaron and Sarah different
[20:39] ones they own vacation and George and

[21:30] um we appreciate your precipitation we
[21:33] pursue we appreciate the precipitation
[21:35] Lord thank you for the rain but
[21:37] participation would be a little bit
[21:39] different thank you for your
[21:41] participation we've got about 51 signed
[21:46] up now so

[24:14] that you have supplied our needs and not
[24:17] our wants

[24:22] are many but you said you would bring us
[24:24] out of every one of them if we just give
[24:26] it to you
[24:27] father today we give ourselves to you
[24:29] Lord we give this congregation to you
[24:32] Lord we give everything that we have
[24:34] Lord that we can hear from you father
[24:35] songs have been sung the different
[24:38] requirements that we have of tithing and
[24:40] taking up offering or singing Lord
[24:43] they've all been taken care of now pray
[24:45] Lord we'd be all attentive and listen
[24:47] today Lord to what you have to say to us
[24:50] father we ask you to be the ones that

[25:06] should be with the young people there
[25:08] father just bless each one forgive us of
[25:10] our sins in Jesus name we pray
[25:12] amen
[25:14] part 114. we'll get there sometime in
[25:18] the beginning was the word where it was
[25:19] with God and the Word was God and that
[25:21] word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[25:23] he said brother wait I don't feel
[25:25] anything you know at least probably
[25:26] today Jesus didn't feel like being God
[25:28] either
[25:30] hello
[25:31] because the Bible said he learned about
[25:32] the things he suffered right and being
[25:34] made perfect
[25:35] he didn't just wake up and all of a
[25:37] sudden he didn't have a tooth acre all
[25:38] of a sudden he he never was hungry no
[25:40] the Bible talks about him being hungry
[25:41] and him being
[25:43] angry
[25:45] hmm
[25:46] a little frustrated
[25:49] Peter get behind me Satan don't be
[25:51] talking like that yeah
[25:53] yeah he's he ain't Mr lovey-dovey like
[25:56] the world thinks he is
[25:58] but he loved you enough to die for you
[26:00] that's What mattered that's right all
[26:02] right in the beginning was the word
[26:03] where was with God and the Word was God
[26:05] and that word was made flesh and brought
[26:06] among us and we beheld his glory to
[26:09] glory the only begotten of the father
[26:10] full of grace
[26:12] and truth and now we're heading up
[26:14] statue of perfect man and besides this
[26:16] in other words beside you're a
[26:17] born-again experience giving all
[26:19] diligence add to your faith burst into
[26:21] virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance
[26:23] Temperance patience patience godliness
[26:25] godliness brotherly kindness brother
[26:27] kindness charity you may be seeing
[26:29] Laura's blessing to the reading of his
[26:30] word I want us to understand that this
[26:33] is attainable brother Brown said we can
[26:34] do this he said it listen if it's
[26:36] required then he give had to make a way
[26:38] for it to happen all right official
[26:41] requirement he had to make a way for us
[26:44] to be not like God but to be God
[26:47] to be in His image to get back and we'll
[26:50] look at it just a few minutes
[26:51] that you know what we're getting back to
[26:55] Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden were
[26:57] naked
[26:59] the whole time
[27:01] and had no issues
[27:06] brother Brown said they had a holy
[27:07] spirit Veil over their eyes
[27:10] what happened was as Eve walked out from
[27:12] under that Veil and give her them the
[27:15] key of knowledge of Good and Evil to be
[27:17] able to know that they were naked the
[27:19] first time they got out from under that
[27:20] where did they go they went in the
[27:22] bushes and made them some fig leaves and
[27:24] that's what we've been doing ever since
[27:25] so what's God doing anything that man
[27:28] has done to to degrade or to fall
[27:32] God has reversed that process to go back
[27:37] because we were made in His image we
[27:39] were made in his lightness and we're
[27:40] supposed to have dominion over the fish
[27:42] of the sea and foul the air just like
[27:44] Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden
[27:45] before the fall
[27:47] so everything that God's done from there
[27:50] to here is to roll that thing back to do
[27:53] what
[27:54] bring that Holy Ghost Veil
[27:57] back over eyes again
[27:59] because when we get to Glory guess what
[28:01] there won't be any sex there won't be
[28:03] any yeah brother Brown said you'll know
[28:04] who your wife was but there'll be no
[28:06] intimacy there'll be no like we we have
[28:08] now this is permitted not uh not the
[28:11] perfect will of God it's permitted to
[28:13] how we got here but it's the only way he
[28:15] wants Adam and Eve crossed that line
[28:17] they couldn't get back
[28:18] so when they cross that line God said
[28:20] okay I know you messed up but I'm going
[28:22] to make a way for you to get back
[28:24] all right the Holy Ghost has been taken
[28:26] away or taken off your eyes but I'm
[28:29] gonna go back in the end time and I'm
[28:30] gonna put it back on but now you got to
[28:33] remember though
[28:35] Satan had a veil also
[28:38] because remember at this age they're
[28:41] blind miserable naked and don't know it
[28:46] so see as as God comes down Satan comes
[28:49] with it there's there's really he's just
[28:51] a copycat so whatever God's doing he
[28:53] just tries to do the reverse
[28:56] so really you should we should know his
[28:58] tactics that brother Brown said we
[29:00] should know his tactics and what he's up
[29:02] to well we do the only problem is is
[29:05] sometimes the that veil of Satan got on
[29:08] their eyes in the church ages and made a
[29:11] trinity Veil made a uh three God Veil or
[29:15] made a uh baptism in father son Holy
[29:18] Ghost Veil and put it over their eyes of
[29:21] the people of the religious people not
[29:23] just over the world over the religious
[29:25] people and they took that as Doctrine as
[29:29] we were talking this morning
[29:31] but our Doctrine
[29:34] should be
[29:36] that we can do this
[29:38] we can make it
[29:39] somebody's going to let's just believe
[29:42] it's us
[29:43] let's just believe that God has put you
[29:46] in a place and me in a place unique
[29:49] place that not just that we preach and
[29:52] try to get you emotionally built up I
[29:54] wish we could a lot of you wouldn't fall
[29:56] asleep like you do
[30:02] but we just don't do that here
[30:04] that means you gotta fight
[30:06] you gotta fight for every second you
[30:08] gotta fight for every minute you gotta
[30:09] say God give me something I need
[30:10] something we're not going to be running
[30:12] the rafters or running the back of the
[30:14] pews and shouting and all that if you
[30:16] did then you'd pretty much stay awake
[30:17] and all of your other ones will stay
[30:18] awake be able to see what's going on
[30:22] well praise the Lord anyway
[30:24] Colossians 1 says in you that were
[30:27] sometimes alienated and enemies in your
[30:29] mind by Wicked worth that free pre-new
[30:32] birth
[30:33] all right everybody with me we always
[30:35] like to say BC
[30:37] before Christ all right
[30:39] so BC in our mind we were Wicked and
[30:43] even though you lived a Pure Life you
[30:45] were still Wicked
[30:46] because you didn't have God if you don't
[30:48] have God you're Wicked yet now has he
[30:51] reconciled in other words what I just
[30:52] like I said before whatever got lost
[30:55] he's going to reconcile it back all
[30:57] right and he saw a group of people that
[30:59] would be reconciled back and how they
[31:02] would be reconciled back then he would
[31:04] see a group of people make Believers
[31:06] unbelievers and True Believers he'd see
[31:08] them and he'd see who would and who
[31:10] wouldn't
[31:12] in the body of his flesh through death
[31:15] to present present you holy and
[31:18] unblameable and unreprovable in his
[31:21] sight all right now that's what God said
[31:23] about us
[31:24] when are we gonna start saying that
[31:26] about us all right
[31:28] that's right you know like brother Jewel
[31:30] will probably say in a few weeks he'll
[31:31] say wowzy wowzy woo
[31:34] what get all that bucket mouse stuff I
[31:37] ain't this and I ain't that and I can't
[31:39] this and I can't that get the baptism of
[31:42] the Holy Ghost
[31:43] it will cause you to do something
[31:45] different
[31:47] if you're continuing in the same way
[31:50] do something different
[31:52] get the new birth
[31:55] really get a relationship with Jesus
[31:59] don't ever forget that get a
[32:00] relationship with the Lord Jesus then
[32:02] he'll give you a relationship with a
[32:04] message of the hour I promise you that
[32:05] it'll give you a relationship and reveal
[32:08] to you that brother Brown was the
[32:09] prophet of the hour
[32:10] amen and not a false prophet
[32:14] the Bible says if you continue in the
[32:16] faith grounded and settled that's the
[32:18] statue of perfect man because of what is
[32:21] a baby a baby falls a baby has to be
[32:23] picked up a baby has to be fed a baby
[32:25] has to be told what to do
[32:28] Christians shouldn't have to be told
[32:30] what to do
[32:32] it's like I like what that brother said
[32:34] the other day
[32:35] he said you could you don't you will
[32:37] never have to beg a Christian to come to
[32:38] church
[32:39] never never will you have to beg a
[32:42] Christian to come to church when I say
[32:43] when I do it means you're not a
[32:45] Christian if you don't come to church
[32:46] all the time if you just decide to come
[32:48] when you need to ah sorry won't do it if
[32:50] you continue in the faith grounded and
[32:52] settled and be not moved away from the
[32:55] hope of the Gospel listen this is the
[32:57] only hope I got I hope it's the only
[32:59] hope you got
[33:00] I hope you hadn't put your Hope on
[33:02] something else to get you to heaven
[33:06] I hope you hadn't
[33:08] why are you sitting here today
[33:10] you have a hope of the Gospel that
[33:12] something's going to spark in your life
[33:15] something's going to spark in you not in
[33:17] your neighbor not in your husband or
[33:19] your wife in you Something's Gonna spark
[33:21] in you and it's going to take you up
[33:22] higher sparking you take you up high
[33:24] sparking you take you up higher you
[33:26] can't sit here 30 or 40 years and be the
[33:28] same not on a pickle like you used to be
[33:31] about
[33:32] it that's right though and I don't know
[33:33] what a bump on a pickles for so that's
[33:35] about useless as you can get right
[33:36] sister Rebecca
[33:38] it's about useless a bump on a pickle
[33:40] I don't know what it's for guess in my
[33:42] way well I guess there's something to
[33:43] hold on to so you can handle it and he
[33:46] hey don't let me forget I'm bringing
[33:48] some pickles to the thing I got to bring
[33:50] get some pickles I've been I've been
[33:52] pickle wanting today so anyway you know
[33:54] what a pickle is right it's a cucumber
[33:56] that never goes back
[33:58] that's what US US is yeah we're changing
[34:03] we can't go back once the pickling
[34:04] process happens we can't be a a cucumber
[34:06] no more we're a pickle now we might look
[34:08] like a cucumber
[34:11] and we may still have bumps on us
[34:14] if you go through the pickling process
[34:16] you become a pickle
[34:19] and we like pickles
[34:21] be not moved away from the hope of the
[34:23] Gospel which you have heard you can't
[34:25] say I have not heard
[34:28] and which was preached to every creature
[34:30] which is under Heaven whereby I Paul and
[34:33] made a minister I I just would just love
[34:35] for a moment just sit and and watch Paul
[34:38] work like in the Corinthians
[34:41] he knows that they're having Idols he
[34:43] knows that they're they're drinking at
[34:45] the Lord's table he knows the certain
[34:47] things that they're doing yet he's
[34:49] sitting there as a master builder he
[34:51] called himself a master builder he sits
[34:53] there as a master Craftsman and he's
[34:55] sitting there and he's he's
[34:58] you know sawing off the bumps
[35:02] to make that Corinthian Church into an
[35:05] Ephesian church because he you know he
[35:06] had both
[35:07] he had churches in Corinth which were
[35:10] Corinthians which were pure much raw
[35:12] Heathen then he had a church in Ephesus
[35:14] he didn't have to go see every once in a
[35:16] while he'd go see him once every two or
[35:18] three years and it'd be good because
[35:19] they were established settled and they
[35:22] were what that was God was working with
[35:24] these virtues I believe in their life
[35:26] and there was only 12 of them
[35:29] who now rejoice in my suffering for you
[35:32] and fill up that which is behind of the
[35:34] afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[35:36] his body's sake which is the church
[35:38] wherefore I am made a minister according
[35:41] to the dispensation of God which is
[35:43] given to me for you to fulfill
[35:45] the word of God
[35:47] even the mystery
[35:49] when you say this word mystery then that
[35:51] means it's not common
[35:55] all right there's a mystery there
[35:56] there's something that's hidden that's
[35:59] previously hidden that's now been made
[36:01] known as brother Brown said the mystery
[36:04] has now been history because the book's
[36:05] open
[36:07] there's always a wonderful mystery
[36:10] but once that mystery is made known once
[36:13] you've seen the movie
[36:15] whatever you want to put the in there
[36:16] once you've seen the end of it there's
[36:18] no mystery to it anymore it's that aha
[36:21] moment you go ah
[36:23] oh that's what it is I like brother Russ
[36:26] dunker you you know he's from Minnesota
[36:28] and you know he talks like a Yankee but
[36:31] bless his heart he'll get converted one
[36:33] day
[36:34] but um you start talking to him about
[36:36] the word of God and he's only been in a
[36:38] message several years you know brother
[36:39] John and he and you start conquering to
[36:41] him and he doesn't you know you've
[36:42] talked to some people and they go hmm
[36:45] all right hmm
[36:46] no his is about 30 seconds long
[36:50] he goes hmm
[36:53] so now you know he's thinking about
[36:55] something I just go hmm
[36:57] he goes hmm
[37:00] [Music]
[37:03] it was previously a mystery and
[37:06] somewhere in that 30 seconds of hmm his
[37:09] mind is running
[37:11] why don't you let yours do that
[37:14] instead of shutting it off why don't you
[37:16] let yours get have that moment where you
[37:18] go
[37:19] that's refreshing
[37:21] that mystery was just refreshing that
[37:23] just absolutely thrilled my soul whether
[37:26] my body likes it or not
[37:28] are my spirit likes it or not your soul
[37:31] is always going to agree with the truth
[37:34] amen amen it can't help it
[37:37] so even the mystery hmm
[37:40] which has been hit from ages and
[37:42] generations now has made manifest to his
[37:45] Saints now remember this is in Paul's
[37:47] age First Church age they haven't had
[37:49] the seals broke to them yet
[37:53] so they didn't get the whole book
[37:55] they got part of the book they got the
[37:58] statue perfect man up to where it says
[37:59] holy spirit but they never got the
[38:01] Capstone or the seals never opened to
[38:04] even to the Apostle Paul who taught us
[38:06] all these great Mysteries but there was
[38:09] one mystery left
[38:11] and that mystery was a mystery of the
[38:14] opening of the seals and bringing Christ
[38:16] back to the Earth like he wanted to be
[38:19] so even the mystery which has hit from
[38:21] ages and generations has now made
[38:23] manifest to his Saints that's he's
[38:24] talking about in like BC 56 now we're in
[38:28] I'm yeah A.D 56 now we're in A.D 2023.
[38:32] we ought to know more about these
[38:34] Mysteries all right
[38:36] to whom God would make known what is the
[38:38] riches of the glory of this mystery
[38:40] among the Gentiles now who is he talking
[38:41] about he really just narrowed it right
[38:44] down he didn't say Israel's going to get
[38:46] this
[38:48] this is not the Jewish mystery now that
[38:51] was used included but I'm talking about
[38:52] Jews as a nation
[38:54] it's for the Gentiles who is us
[38:57] right which is Christ in you the hope of
[39:01] glory
[39:03] now see Paul
[39:05] spoke this
[39:08] but remember when brother Branham comes
[39:11] and preaches Christ is the mystery of
[39:13] God revealed
[39:15] one of the most powerful sermons he ever
[39:17] preached in his life he said if you
[39:20] don't get it in the sales come right
[39:21] back to here and see this one more time
[39:23] take this message with a threefold
[39:25] purpose oh God what he Port was he
[39:27] poured into Christ Christ into the
[39:29] church take her back to the Garden of
[39:31] Eden now look hold it now
[39:34] brother Paul could get all God was he
[39:37] poured into Christ
[39:38] and pretty much all what Christ poured
[39:41] in the church but he couldn't take us
[39:43] back to the Garden of Eden because the
[39:45] seals hadn't been opened he couldn't
[39:46] take this back to the Garden of Eden
[39:49] he Paul could just say oh death where's
[39:53] your stain
[39:54] oh grave where's your victory
[39:57] and he went to that grave
[40:00] he had his head chopped off
[40:03] so he can preach Christ as a mystery of
[40:06] God revealed but here the prophet of God
[40:07] comes and preaches after the sales he
[40:09] preaches
[40:10] Christ is a mystery of God revealed
[40:12] showing us how God poured himself into
[40:15] Christ how Christ poured himself into
[40:17] his church and then took us back to the
[40:21] Garden of Eden condition before there
[40:23] was a fall
[40:25] Paul couldn't do that but the prophet of
[40:28] God did going back into the mind of God
[40:30] whom we preach warning every man and
[40:32] teaching every man in all wisdom look
[40:34] that you may present ever we may present
[40:36] every man perfect in Christ Jesus
[40:40] then we remember what godliness is it's
[40:42] to be like God his brother Byron said so
[40:44] that's what we've got to do work on that
[40:46] but work on it in a way where you can do
[40:48] it
[40:49] not where you can't do it
[40:51] all right
[40:53] oh I can't do it oh yes you can brother
[40:56] Ram said statue perfect man paragraph
[40:58] 301.
[40:59] if you can't you need to deal with him
[41:01] because you know what now you're
[41:02] required to do it because you know it
[41:04] that you can
[41:05] right right and then realize that you
[41:08] are deity that's what I said about
[41:09] getting the new birth if you have the
[41:10] new birth you have deity
[41:12] you're not searching for deity you're
[41:14] not looking for deity to come on the
[41:16] scene you are a deity
[41:18] deities deities is unveiled inside of
[41:22] you
[41:22] Now what is
[41:24] this age it's unveiling
[41:28] it's not veiling it's unveiling
[41:30] the unveiling of God in other words the
[41:33] unveiling of the Bride that's what God
[41:35] wants to see in the end time he wants to
[41:37] see us unveil to the world brother Brown
[41:40] said one time he said just for a moment
[41:42] God's Gonna in other words put us on a
[41:44] pedestal and say hey this is my bride
[41:47] they're here they've made it somebody
[41:50] has
[41:51] or we're all going to go by the grave
[41:54] deity fell on the day of Pentecost now
[41:56] look if deity fell on the day of
[41:58] Pentecost
[42:00] what about today
[42:03] deity fellow dead Pentecost for one
[42:05] first church age
[42:07] 120 in the upper room 3 000 downstairs
[42:12] now we're a recipient at the other end
[42:14] of it at the open book part of it and
[42:17] it's falling yes the same deity but look
[42:19] we're required more they weren't
[42:21] required to come to a body change they
[42:24] weren't required to come to a
[42:26] resurrection you and I are required to
[42:29] come to that so we're in a dispensation
[42:31] that's different from that I believe God
[42:33] believes in dispensations you know why
[42:35] because I believe he set them up
[42:37] hello come on somebody wake up goodness
[42:40] a lot of y'all are asleep Heavenly days
[42:43] pinch yourself
[42:44] you need a bowling ball
[42:48] hold this one above your head
[42:51] not down at your feet
[42:56] well I'm just going to tell you I'm
[42:57] sorry folks I'm a human as y'all are is
[42:59] depressing when you got about 20 people
[43:01] doing this
[43:03] totally out you're not listening to
[43:05] nothing I'm saying nothing
[43:09] why oh I'll get it subliminally yeah
[43:16] brother Brian said look there's a group
[43:18] of people that will do only his will
[43:21] this is where he said pick up his pen
[43:22] and write so this is the Holy Ghost
[43:24] writing to me and you no one can
[43:26] persuade them different they have thus
[43:28] said to the Lord or they keep still
[43:30] then they will do the works of God for
[43:32] it is himself in them
[43:36] so it's not you doing the work
[43:38] it's Christ inside of you doing the work
[43:41] it is himself and them continuing his
[43:44] word to fulfill as he did complete in
[43:47] his day now look he said that and here's
[43:50] that
[43:51] all right all things when he was here
[43:55] but he did not complete all when he was
[43:58] here
[43:59] because you and I weren't there yet
[44:02] for it was not time yet I promise you
[44:05] today is the time
[44:08] the Bible tells us it talks about a
[44:10] Doctrine which is according to Godliness
[44:12] the only way you're going to get
[44:13] godliness is excuse me is to have the
[44:15] true correct Doctrine Jesus stood and he
[44:18] didn't have to wonder whether he was
[44:20] preaching the correct Doctrine
[44:22] no he was the doctrine so being the
[44:26] doctrine he could preach the doctrine
[44:28] and 100 truth
[44:32] he said well I can't do that well get
[44:34] some Jesus
[44:36] get some Jesus
[44:38] get the preacher inside of you get some
[44:40] Jesus and he'll tell you what to say
[44:42] Amen
[44:45] the dictionary says it's a set of ideas
[44:47] or beliefs that are taught or believed
[44:48] to be true and you know that we there's
[44:51] a lot of things that we believe that
[44:53] others don't there's a lot of things
[44:54] especially out in the world that the
[44:56] world doesn't believe that we believe
[44:57] are vice versa all right but I'm not
[45:00] worried about the world I'm not going to
[45:01] worry we can't save the world I wish we
[45:04] could you know what if God can't save
[45:06] the whole world you sure can
[45:09] all right so let's just quit trying
[45:13] just just just just live your Christian
[45:15] Life be the best you can do bring all of
[45:18] them in that you can pray for your
[45:19] family pray for your friends
[45:23] and turn them over to God best thing you
[45:25] ever do in your life
[45:28] and if it so happens that you your
[45:30] church doesn't believe now brother Brown
[45:31] look how cordial he is
[45:34] hey he's cordial everywhere he goes he
[45:36] goes remember he's dealing with
[45:38] denominations he don't have message
[45:40] Believers sitting in his congregation
[45:42] that that hadn't happened yet now
[45:45] there's believers but they're not
[45:47] message believers
[45:49] because that a lot of them people did
[45:50] not believe what he was saying they
[45:53] wanted to see the Miracles
[45:55] well praise the Lord that's what
[45:57] happened if it so happens that you your
[45:59] church doesn't believe or you do not
[46:01] believe just the things that we speak of
[46:03] in our as our church doctrine we trust
[46:07] that it will by no means bring an
[46:08] offense in other words he'd want to be
[46:10] offensive because the very first step to
[46:12] successful Christianity now if you want
[46:15] the first step to a successful Christian
[46:18] Life read this
[46:20] to show that man has received the Holy
[46:24] Spirit is humility
[46:27] real god-given humility that it must be
[46:31] given humbly but yet a church without a
[46:34] doctor now he still tells you look you
[46:36] can't be a jellyfish
[46:38] you can't just say well well you believe
[46:40] whatever you want to do that's what the
[46:42] world does you can't believe whatever
[46:43] you want to now you can't
[46:46] but if you're going to live Godly if
[46:48] we're going to be in the message of the
[46:49] hour if we're going to listen to the
[46:50] tapes read the books and come to the
[46:52] message church then there are certain
[46:54] things that you got to believe there are
[46:55] certain doctrines that you've got to
[46:56] carry with you and you got to be the
[46:58] doctrine
[47:01] listen when we first come in the message
[47:03] in the 60s late 60s
[47:05] women didn't cut their hair and didn't
[47:08] wear pants because somebody told them
[47:10] that
[47:13] but
[47:15] they are really reading the Bible
[47:18] because this person that we're following
[47:20] now this William Branham guy we heard it
[47:22] on tape that we're supposed to not cut
[47:24] our hair and we're not supposed to wear
[47:25] pants so we don't do it because brother
[47:27] Brown said not to do it well that's not
[47:29] right
[47:31] the Bible told you not to do it long
[47:33] before
[47:36] so that Veil that Satan put on Eve's
[47:39] eyes put on everybody else's eyes
[47:43] think of the women now
[47:47] I thank God
[47:52] I'm a Post delivery I deliver mail right
[47:55] yeah
[47:56] there are certain magazines that are
[47:59] just regular common magazines that I
[48:01] there's no way I have in my house
[48:04] you can't hardly get Better Homes and
[48:06] Gardens to have something that looks
[48:08] good in it that's not got naked women in
[48:10] it
[48:12] but think about 30 40 years ago when not
[48:14] magazines were you got them in the mail
[48:16] and and all that stuff
[48:19] you gotta say no that's not right you
[48:21] got to bring you got to bring not be the
[48:22] jellyfish you gotta have a backbone say
[48:25] hey don't give me any of that well now
[48:27] it's just everywhere it's just prevalent
[48:29] all over the place
[48:32] but thank God
[48:34] he give us a holy ghost Veil
[48:37] to help us get through this
[48:40] so we gotta have a back bone in it and
[48:42] not only
[48:45] because the Church of God must eat
[48:48] the bread of life Romans 1 16 for I am
[48:51] not ashamed of the gospel of Christ
[48:53] I'm not ashamed for people to know that
[48:55] I live and try to be this message of the
[48:58] hour I have no shame in that you
[49:00] shouldn't either
[49:04] before you go to church
[49:06] River Jordan
[49:08] what's the name of your church
[49:11] what about emergency
[49:18] I mean really if you're ashamed if
[49:20] you're ashamed because listen most
[49:22] people know since that sign's been put
[49:24] out there 47 50 years ago they know what
[49:27] we believe
[49:28] the community pretty much knows what we
[49:30] believe they just kind of skirt around
[49:32] it you know
[49:35] and you get that I ain't perfect and you
[49:37] ain't perfect you know
[49:39] but I'm not ashamed of the gospel of
[49:41] Christ but it's the power so now if
[49:43] you're ashamed of the Gospel you have no
[49:45] power
[49:46] because this says
[49:48] if you're not ashamed of the Gospel it
[49:51] is the power of God unto salvation to
[49:53] everyone that believeth
[49:56] as brothers always said have we lived it
[49:59] in front of our kids
[50:01] to where they want what you got not
[50:04] don't want what you got
[50:09] think about that
[50:13] now let's look at this just for a minute
[50:15] brother Brown power of transformation
[50:17] 1965. now in God's Eden they were naked
[50:20] and didn't know it
[50:21] and now in Satan's Eden be it by science
[50:24] and education they are naked again and
[50:26] don't know it what a perversion
[50:29] look at today look at man trying to wear
[50:32] his wife's underneath clothes boy isn't
[50:35] that true and she's wet trying to wear
[50:37] his clothes
[50:45] bless your heart
[50:46] sister after went in the bathroom the
[50:48] other day and a man came in I mean
[50:49] they're using both bathrooms now so
[50:51] there's no gender you know it's all
[50:54] gender friendly I guess you might say
[50:56] but brother Brown this is back 1965. I
[50:59] mean how innocent is 1965 compared to
[51:02] today
[51:03] very innocent very very innocent
[51:07] according to now but what happened is
[51:09] though there there wasn't as much a veil
[51:12] out there there was some modesty yeah
[51:14] listen I don't remember any of my women
[51:17] School teachers wearing pants
[51:20] I do not Mom you I just don't remember
[51:23] man and listen back then it was more
[51:25] prevalent for a woman to be a a teacher
[51:28] than it was for men
[51:30] because you have to remember you had the
[51:31] old school arms you know you had the
[51:33] school and I never remember them now
[51:35] they might have but I don't remember
[51:36] wearing pair of pants they wore giraffes
[51:39] you definitely wore a dress to church
[51:41] that was no doubt about that you didn't
[51:43] see a pair of pants on a woman in the
[51:45] 60s and 70s going to church
[51:47] there was at least some yeah why you say
[51:49] wow Brothers Yonkers you didn't see that
[51:51] back then I grew up in the 60s going
[51:54] even to a Baptist Church knowing that
[51:56] they did not walk in that door with a
[51:58] pair of pants on
[52:00] now shorts them Speedos or whatever they
[52:04] wear now the women and all that they
[52:06] don't care they just go to church any
[52:08] way they want to
[52:10] but listen that's no worse than us
[52:12] turning the word down
[52:14] so let's don't put us up here and them
[52:16] down here let's stay humble and say all
[52:19] right Lord had it not been for you I'd
[52:21] be doing the same identical thing all
[52:23] right
[52:27] but you know what you
[52:30] watches yourself available to listen to
[52:32] what God said they have shut their ears
[52:35] off and their eyes have been blinded by
[52:38] the God of this evil age
[52:41] and listen that God is still here and
[52:45] that God is bombarding me and you but we
[52:48] thank God we have the god that overrules
[52:50] all that
[52:53] he's trying to let his hair grow out
[52:55] like hers she's cutting hers off like
[52:57] his oh my man trying to be a woman women
[53:00] trying to be man a perversion I
[53:02] appreciated God the other day he was he
[53:04] was being uh uh questioned in like a
[53:07] Schoolhouse type situation and and he's
[53:10] uh I think I told you about the other
[53:12] day but he was uh look talking to a
[53:15] transgender person
[53:17] and and you know the transgenders like
[53:19] well that's no different something you
[53:21] know be a man could be a woman and and
[53:23] the guy looked there and looked at that
[53:25] person and said all right answer me one
[53:28] question I don't want all your opinion
[53:30] answering me one question has a man
[53:32] since the dawn of time has a man ever
[53:35] had a baby
[53:39] and whatever that thing was said well no
[53:41] but but he said no I don't want he said
[53:43] I wanted you to answer my question yes
[53:46] or no as a man since the dawn of time
[53:49] ever ever got conceived and had a baby
[53:53] and and the person said no he said well
[53:55] then there's a difference
[53:57] yeah then there's a difference there has
[53:59] to be if you can and this one can't
[54:01] there should not be a difference all
[54:03] right but see you see how the world
[54:05] though they took it and just turned it
[54:07] back around and went the other way and
[54:08] said well you can do whatever you want
[54:09] to do and blah blah blah that probably
[54:11] didn't do anything to that person he
[54:14] just went or that person just went out
[54:15] and believed whatever he's going to
[54:16] believe anyway but thank God for a man
[54:18] who could stand up in a group
[54:20] and and stand for what's right stand for
[54:23] the truth
[54:24] amen stand for
[54:26] the way you were born is the Way You Are
[54:29] that's the same thing the church is
[54:30] doing same thing to lay out the CNAs and
[54:32] what is he talking about he's talking
[54:33] about this Holy Ghost fail listen the
[54:35] reason that you didn't know you were
[54:37] they didn't they didn't know they were
[54:38] naked in the beginning there was a holy
[54:40] spirit veiled them now listen where is
[54:43] that Holy Spirit today
[54:46] the same holy spirit that covered Adam
[54:49] and Eve where is it today it's right
[54:52] here right
[54:53] it's the same Holy Ghost he don't change
[54:55] he didn't make any difference
[54:57] he didn't change he's right here now
[55:00] inside of you that's what makes you not
[55:02] be naked and try to show yourself naked
[55:05] to the world men and women
[55:07] but there was a holy spirit Veil that
[55:10] veiled them from nakedness they didn't
[55:12] know it the Holy Spirit was over their
[55:15] eyes they see nothing but their brother
[55:18] and sister see the laws they didn't know
[55:21] they were naked the Holy Spirit now the
[55:23] spirit of unholiness uncleanness and
[55:26] lust has veiled them what the loudest
[55:28] sin Church age education science well
[55:31] it's scientific he goes on to tell you
[55:33] that science says wear shorts because
[55:36] it's cooler he said no he said he said
[55:39] the people in Mexico and the people the
[55:40] Native Americans he said they put on
[55:42] clothes
[55:43] to sweat and cause air conditioning and
[55:46] cause insulation to
[55:48] so he said that was disproven all that
[55:51] but what are we looking for I'm looking
[55:53] for that Holy Ghost Veil to Veil us back
[55:56] the other way that keeps us from looking
[55:58] at the woman that keeps us from looking
[56:00] at the man that keeps us from all the
[56:02] XYZ you want to put in there whatever
[56:04] they got in the end time it's going to
[56:07] be put in front of your face
[56:08] young children yeah beware right
[56:13] that's right be careful right
[56:15] right one wrong punch of a button
[56:17] you can be ruined for life
[56:20] you should be careful
[56:22] you know what ask that Holy Ghost I
[56:24] promise you that Holy Ghost will never
[56:26] tell you to press the wrong button
[56:29] if you'll listen to the Holy Ghost he'll
[56:31] never tell you to press your own button
[56:33] because he's never wrong
[56:35] what our problem is is we override that
[56:37] and say well okay that's not so bad
[56:41] just press play or whatever you want to
[56:43] do
[56:45] but the word Godly means a deity
[56:48] so we come up to now to a deity
[56:52] and it's where you resemble that deity
[56:54] in any way so in Genesis 1 26 God made
[56:58] an image that looked like him
[57:02] and look like him and acted like him but
[57:06] now what did he do he gave him Dominion
[57:08] you say well bro wait why you keep
[57:10] reading this I want you to know that
[57:12] that same Dominion is what we're going
[57:14] to have to have for this statue of a
[57:15] perfect man
[57:17] when you get bored again listen you
[57:19] don't have dominion over everything
[57:22] you've still got issues bad issues
[57:24] problems
[57:26] come on is it just me
[57:30] we still have issues but we must have
[57:33] dominion over them
[57:36] overcome
[57:38] remembers not what you overcome is how
[57:40] you overcome it you overcome it by the
[57:43] word of God you don't overcome it by
[57:45] your trying to will something out of
[57:46] your life
[57:48] please don't ever try to will something
[57:49] out of your life
[57:51] it'll come back every time
[57:53] but if you'll ask God to take it out of
[57:54] your life destroy it kill it murder it
[57:57] then you're fine all right
[57:59] so let's make man in our image and after
[58:01] our likeness so God didn't know he
[58:04] created man in it so he went ahead and
[58:06] just did it he and there's no other way
[58:08] he made you in His image
[58:12] all right the image of God created in
[58:14] him male and female created he them and
[58:18] now we see what God said about the bride
[58:20] which is the female part of Christ is
[58:22] everybody with me on that all right
[58:24] second Timothy 3 says persecutions
[58:26] afflictions
[58:27] which came unto me in Antioch and
[58:29] Iconium
[58:30] the persecutions he endured but out of
[58:33] all the Lord delivered me yea all that
[58:35] live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[58:38] persecution
[58:40] but evil men and seducers shall wax
[58:42] worse and worse deceiving
[58:45] and being deceived so let's talk about
[58:46] brotherly kindness just for a minute
[58:49] we know what it adds it adds all through
[58:52] this and Philadelphia is the word for
[58:54] Brotherly Love or brotherly kindness
[58:56] love of brothers or sisters Brotherly
[58:59] Love in the New Testament the love which
[59:01] Christians cherish I want you to
[59:02] understand something watch how that says
[59:04] in the New Testament
[59:06] because I'm going to read you something
[59:07] in just a few minutes when Jesus stood
[59:09] up one day and told the disciples
[59:11] he said a new commandment I give you
[59:14] now he didn't change from the Old
[59:16] Testament
[59:19] all right he couldn't change the word of
[59:21] God
[59:22] because he was the word of God
[59:24] but he said a new commandment I give you
[59:26] he said you say an eye for an eye
[59:30] right that was the law
[59:33] the law was if if brother Michael if I
[59:36] killed his brother I'm sorry about that
[59:39] okay if we killed him
[59:41] so well he's kind of looking a little
[59:45] bits but there had to be a
[59:47] Reconciliation to that there wasn't any
[59:49] Court
[59:51] no if I killed Benjamin he came after me
[59:55] the law said he could kill me
[59:58] there was only a few Refuge cities we
[1:00:01] could get in
[1:00:03] and stay there and you know what that is
[1:00:05] folks that's Grace
[1:00:07] that's Grace in the Old Testament that
[1:00:10] gives you where say that I did hit
[1:00:12] Benjamin in the head but it was a hammer
[1:00:14] that I was hammering and the head fell
[1:00:16] off and hit him in the head killed him
[1:00:17] well that was not malice murder that
[1:00:19] wasn't I intended but still if I killed
[1:00:23] him he had the opportunity according to
[1:00:25] the law to kill me I for an eye tooth
[1:00:28] for tooth right
[1:00:30] but I'm gonna show you I'm gonna read
[1:00:31] you something here that Jesus stood up
[1:00:32] one day and he said a new law I give you
[1:00:36] a new commandment
[1:00:38] that if a brother does that just give
[1:00:41] him everything you got
[1:00:42] if he hits you on one side give him the
[1:00:44] other side
[1:00:46] God is love but love typically produces
[1:00:49] obedience and for all who refuses to
[1:00:51] repent and believe in Christ they
[1:00:53] receive Justice I want you to think
[1:00:55] about that God is love and it's a god
[1:00:57] pay love and it's it's a love that has
[1:00:59] judgment involved with it not just
[1:01:01] lovey-dovey because listen this world is
[1:01:04] pent up on Jesus loves everybody and it
[1:01:08] really don't matter what you do
[1:01:10] come on somebody really you listen to
[1:01:12] them out there in the world
[1:01:16] This Love
[1:01:18] it's just like the old hippie love back
[1:01:19] and I'm sorry back in the 60s free love
[1:01:21] you just whatever it makes you feel good
[1:01:24] and I think that's the way it has become
[1:01:28] in the world
[1:01:30] because there's no judgment there's no
[1:01:32] God of judgment anymore everybody's
[1:01:34] going to heaven nobody's going to hell
[1:01:36] when the Bible tells us plainly the hell
[1:01:38] have to enlarge this gate so to get
[1:01:40] enough people in it
[1:01:42] so God is love but that love is
[1:01:44] typically produces obedience and brother
[1:01:46] Ryan said love is corrective
[1:01:48] oh we hate that part
[1:01:52] and for all who refuse to repent and
[1:01:55] believe in Christ they receive Justice
[1:01:57] for those who do trust in Christ they
[1:02:00] receive what they don't deserve Grace
[1:02:02] and we were talking about just now
[1:02:04] and have withheld what the really what
[1:02:06] they really did deserve and that was
[1:02:09] Mercy which side are you on do you have
[1:02:12] eternal life or do you still have the
[1:02:13] wrath of God abiding on you that's a
[1:02:16] question for you today because
[1:02:18] iniquities
[1:02:18] [Music]
[1:02:21] shall wax cold
[1:02:27] brother says You must be born again this
[1:02:29] read it's this morning
[1:02:31] then you got agape love then you got
[1:02:34] filial love that's the love that you
[1:02:36] have for your wife
[1:02:38] and remember Agape Love Is Never
[1:02:41] conditional
[1:02:42] it's the love of God
[1:02:44] all right you said well yeah well
[1:02:46] there's on there's certain things you
[1:02:47] got to do but your love for your wife
[1:02:50] and your love for your brother
[1:02:51] is conditional but it shouldn't be
[1:02:54] that's why you got to move from a from
[1:02:56] feel your love to agape love
[1:02:58] all right video love will never save you
[1:03:02] feel your love will never let make you
[1:03:04] love your brother either
[1:03:07] come on
[1:03:08] it won't
[1:03:12] okay
[1:03:14] that's the love that you have for your
[1:03:15] wife if some man should insult her you'd
[1:03:17] shoot his brains out because it causes
[1:03:19] jealousy but that's filial love
[1:03:21] secondary love then comes lust for
[1:03:23] another man's wife then comes Phil it
[1:03:26] just becomes perverted but all of this
[1:03:27] kind of love had a beginning
[1:03:29] but when that real genuine love of God
[1:03:32] because remember when God walked into
[1:03:34] the Garden of Eden the love he projected
[1:03:37] was agape love he's never had filial
[1:03:39] love
[1:03:41] okay
[1:03:43] but now when when Adam and Eve stepped
[1:03:45] out from under that Veil
[1:03:47] they went from agape love to feel your
[1:03:50] love
[1:03:52] because remember they had a veil when
[1:03:53] they were naked they didn't know they
[1:03:55] were naked they didn't bother them there
[1:03:56] was nothing going on there was nothing
[1:03:57] happening they were just perfectly in
[1:04:00] harmony with each other all the time
[1:04:04] that'd be a wonderful marriage wouldn't
[1:04:05] it but guess what we're all over here in
[1:04:07] video love and so Adam and Eve was too
[1:04:09] and I'm sure there were some days I mean
[1:04:12] she lived several hundred years he lived
[1:04:15] 900 and something years had to be some
[1:04:17] contention there somewhere foreign
[1:04:21] two years and
[1:04:25] oh
[1:04:26] Zach Black's not here we'll get on to
[1:04:29] him
[1:04:31] but when that real genuine love of God
[1:04:33] that I've been talking about comes into
[1:04:35] the human being by the new birth so the
[1:04:36] only way you're going to get is by the
[1:04:37] new birth
[1:04:39] being born again it had no beginning and
[1:04:41] it'll never have an end you are then a
[1:04:43] Son of God and a daughter of God in your
[1:04:45] affections are on things above filio
[1:04:48] love would make you shoot a man for
[1:04:49] insulting your wife agape love would
[1:04:52] make you pray for his lost soul
[1:04:54] that's the difference
[1:04:56] the baptism of the Holy Spirit 1958
[1:04:58] brother Adam said and then the first
[1:05:00] great spirit of God which is love God's
[1:05:02] like a great rainbow we couldn't imagine
[1:05:03] what he looks like so just we're going
[1:05:05] to say he looked like a rainbow in
[1:05:07] spirit the perfect Spirit of love red
[1:05:09] blue the perfect Spirit of Fellowship
[1:05:11] just all perfect Spirits then they began
[1:05:13] to condescend coming down and they come
[1:05:15] all the way down from filial love or
[1:05:16] agape love to feel your love and on down
[1:05:19] to lust and down to the lowest and then
[1:05:21] God himself became a man Jesus but now
[1:05:24] remember when God became Jesus when he
[1:05:27] when he condescended down he didn't
[1:05:29] condescend in Failure love
[1:05:33] foreign
[1:05:37] God can't change
[1:05:40] if not he couldn't teach us how to have
[1:05:43] agape love
[1:05:45] because he was agape love he couldn't do
[1:05:47] any different he was agape love he
[1:05:49] didn't have a carnal mind he didn't have
[1:05:50] he didn't warn his members that what his
[1:05:52] mama was and what his daddy was
[1:05:55] he knew who his daddy was
[1:05:58] right okay is everybody with me when he
[1:06:01] condescended he only condescended and
[1:06:04] that he narrowed himself in human flesh
[1:06:06] to die for me and you cause remember
[1:06:09] brother Brown said he didn't become less
[1:06:10] God
[1:06:12] come on he didn't become less God when
[1:06:14] he became Jesus
[1:06:16] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:06:18] bodily
[1:06:19] inside of him dwelt all of God which is
[1:06:23] agape love there was no room for filial
[1:06:26] love
[1:06:28] but remember
[1:06:30] he loved them with agape love
[1:06:33] but he knew they wouldn't love him back
[1:06:35] with agape love
[1:06:37] they loved him with a conditional love
[1:06:39] when he was healing them when he was
[1:06:41] feeding them when he was getting them
[1:06:43] across in a boat when there was a storm
[1:06:45] when he was walking across the water
[1:06:47] when he had a real good social problem
[1:06:48] going on they loved him
[1:06:50] but buddy when he come over here and
[1:06:53] that agape love started projecting
[1:06:56] if you don't believe that I'm he you'll
[1:06:58] die in your sins
[1:06:59] that wouldn't feel your love
[1:07:02] that was agape love and that's the same
[1:07:03] thing going to happen to me and you
[1:07:04] that's why you're going to be persecuted
[1:07:06] for being like Jesus
[1:07:10] he knew before the foundation of the
[1:07:11] world whose names were written on the
[1:07:13] book and redeemed them back to himself
[1:07:15] there you are the story of redemption
[1:07:16] cannot be fully known until we see him
[1:07:19] and we stand in his likeness
[1:07:22] brother Brown now he comes in
[1:07:24] we'll finally get to this six Lee let's
[1:07:27] add the Bible said Adam Brotherly Love
[1:07:29] brotherly kindness now that's a good one
[1:07:31] right here the sixth then he says seven
[1:07:33] but it is the sixth all right adding
[1:07:36] brotherly kindness all right when we get
[1:07:38] to that brotherly kindness put yourself
[1:07:40] in his place on the matter
[1:07:44] remember like I've always said be
[1:07:46] careful when you're
[1:07:48] out in the world and somebody's crossed
[1:07:50] to you maybe somebody that's uh
[1:07:53] um somebody that's a waitress or a
[1:07:54] waiter or something you don't know what
[1:07:56] kind of day they've had
[1:07:58] you ever tried God bless you
[1:08:00] sometimes it'll just rip their mind off
[1:08:03] because they'll look at you like
[1:08:06] well thank you I mean they don't even
[1:08:08] know they've never said they've had some
[1:08:10] other
[1:08:11] cursings during the day but they've
[1:08:13] never really had somebody saying God
[1:08:15] bless you I'm sorry you're having a bad
[1:08:17] day
[1:08:18] is everything okay
[1:08:20] and give them a little extra money give
[1:08:22] them a little extra tip oh that hurts
[1:08:26] my brother sinned against me said Peter
[1:08:28] shall I forgive him
[1:08:30] Peter was a little bit Peter was saying
[1:08:33] I got it whipped here I'm gonna make
[1:08:36] myself a name cause uh I'm just not
[1:08:39] gonna forgive one time I'm gonna give
[1:08:41] forgive seven times a day
[1:08:44] the Lord said no
[1:08:47] he said 70 times seven Peter you missed
[1:08:52] it by a bunch not really Peter's going
[1:08:55] hey I'll answer that seven times a day
[1:08:57] well that sounds good good number
[1:08:59] Jesus turned around and said
[1:09:01] that ain't even close Peter
[1:09:03] 70 times a day
[1:09:05] 70 times seven
[1:09:07] brotherly kindness now we see if a
[1:09:09] brother is All Out Of Tune don't be
[1:09:11] impatient with him see no no be kind to
[1:09:14] him go anyway somebody said not long ago
[1:09:18] I want y'all to to
[1:09:21] think about this quote because I'm
[1:09:23] fixing to read you another one
[1:09:25] that seems a little bit opposite to that
[1:09:27] because brother Brown was a human being
[1:09:29] all right you ready somebody said not
[1:09:31] long ago how can you believe those
[1:09:33] things the way you do now watch and
[1:09:35] still go to the Assembly of God the
[1:09:37] Oneness all the rest then put see
[1:09:39] brotherly kindness see see hoping
[1:09:41] someday see patience with him see
[1:09:45] temperant enduring with him knowledge to
[1:09:49] understand what he believes
[1:09:51] remember it's in his heart that's what
[1:09:54] is
[1:09:55] virtue in yourself to let it go out with
[1:09:58] kindness meekness to him having faith
[1:10:00] that someday God will bring him in
[1:10:03] brotherly kindness brother around said
[1:10:05] the seventh thing one two three four
[1:10:06] five six seven see seven things I said
[1:10:08] now you're coming now I'm gonna read you
[1:10:10] a quote hang on a minute
[1:10:12] keep your eyes closed
[1:10:14] because I got to go to the very end
[1:10:16] because it was one I put at the very
[1:10:18] last because I remember it
[1:10:20] all right you ready this is the same
[1:10:22] person
[1:10:23] this is Brother William Aaron Brown I'm
[1:10:25] everybody okay this is 1962. on the
[1:10:29] Statue of a perfect man
[1:10:32] brother Brown says I was down brother
[1:10:35] right so I think they're back there
[1:10:36] somewhere one night there was a minister
[1:10:38] down there I was speaking four or five
[1:10:40] preachers together this preacher raised
[1:10:42] up and said now I want to tell you
[1:10:43] people something oh I think you're fine
[1:10:45] people all right
[1:10:48] I said I told somebody I said that
[1:10:50] that's one sitting right there watch now
[1:10:52] look brother Ryan's telling somebody
[1:10:53] beside of him he said there's one watch
[1:10:56] so Junior Jackson back there just got
[1:10:58] through speaking and he said was
[1:10:59] preaching on the grace of God he was
[1:11:02] burning up waiting he's talking about
[1:11:04] this other guy he got up there and he
[1:11:06] was trying to understand now I want to
[1:11:08] say that brother Brown I'm here I'll
[1:11:10] tell you is an antichrist
[1:11:13] and he started off like that all night
[1:11:16] some of the preachers started I said
[1:11:18] wait a minute now don't say nothing
[1:11:21] Brothers there's only one of him and a
[1:11:24] bunch of us
[1:11:25] now here's the real thought of the
[1:11:28] Prophet I said just let him alone
[1:11:30] he's picking on me
[1:11:32] I wanted it myself so bad I didn't know
[1:11:35] what to do
[1:11:39] hmm
[1:11:41] he wanted it so bad to get up there and
[1:11:44] tell that brother that he was wrong
[1:11:46] and if you'll continue on with a quote
[1:11:48] he did get to ask your brother a couple
[1:11:50] questions because the brother was
[1:11:52] telling it saying that the apostolic age
[1:11:54] was gone there was no speaking in
[1:11:55] tongues there was no Divine Healing and
[1:11:57] brother Brown was preaching all that but
[1:11:59] he said I ordered it myself so bad he's
[1:12:01] picking on me
[1:12:03] I didn't know what to do see
[1:12:07] so you have to be you have to be
[1:12:09] what is it a balance we have to have a
[1:12:12] balance in this thing
[1:12:13] everything's got to be a balance so
[1:12:16] brother Brown was a human being but yet
[1:12:18] he was balanced
[1:12:20] all right everybody with me
[1:12:22] now remember Jesus tells us he said all
[1:12:24] mine are lying and thine are mine and
[1:12:26] I'm glorified in them
[1:12:27] then he says that they may be one as we
[1:12:30] are really to get true Oneness you got
[1:12:33] to come to brotherly kindness you got to
[1:12:34] have true wonders because there can't be
[1:12:36] anything in between
[1:12:37] everybody with me there can't be
[1:12:39] anything in between it's got to be you
[1:12:41] and God Amen all right
[1:12:44] while I was with him in the world I kept
[1:12:46] them in thy name this is Jesus praying
[1:12:47] we read this the other day
[1:12:50] I have given them Thy word and the world
[1:12:52] have hated them because they are not of
[1:12:54] this world even as I am not of this
[1:12:57] world
[1:12:58] I pray not that thou should have take
[1:13:00] them out of the world in other words
[1:13:02] I'm I'm not wanting you to shelter them
[1:13:05] they're going to have to prove who they
[1:13:07] are they're going to have to prove
[1:13:10] brotherly kindness they're going to have
[1:13:12] to prove Temperance they're gonna have
[1:13:14] to prove patience
[1:13:17] because I've got a bunch of Overcomers
[1:13:19] coming I don't have a bunch of whims
[1:13:21] I pray not that thou should have take
[1:13:23] them out of the world but that thou
[1:13:25] should have keep them from the evil they
[1:13:27] are not of this world even as I am not
[1:13:29] of this world sanctify them through thy
[1:13:31] truth Thy word is truth and this whole
[1:13:33] process is a sanctifying process yeah
[1:13:36] even though you're born again you still
[1:13:38] need your spirit realm sanctified
[1:13:44] now here we go this is John 13 34. this
[1:13:47] is Jesus now the word of God that was in
[1:13:49] the Old Testament right now he's coming
[1:13:52] into the New Testament and he has been
[1:13:54] made flesh
[1:13:56] he was Jehovah at one time where the
[1:13:58] animal blood could not let him come down
[1:14:01] and redeem anyone there was no
[1:14:03] redemption in the Old Testament
[1:14:04] everybody understand that right
[1:14:06] all right there was a covering we'll get
[1:14:07] into that uh several several down the
[1:14:09] road we'll talk about anointing but that
[1:14:12] anointing that same Jehovah brother
[1:14:13] around said became Jesus Christ now then
[1:14:16] he was able to project agape love
[1:14:20] a new commandment I give unto you that
[1:14:24] you love one another as I have loved you
[1:14:30] think
[1:14:32] that you love one another as I have
[1:14:35] loved you that you also
[1:14:37] love one another
[1:14:39] by this shall all men know that you're
[1:14:41] my disciples
[1:14:43] if you have love
[1:14:45] one to the other
[1:14:46] Matthew 5 37 says but let your
[1:14:49] communication be yay nay nay for
[1:14:52] whatsoever is more than these cometh of
[1:14:54] evil you have heard that it said an eye
[1:14:56] for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I
[1:14:58] say unto you
[1:15:00] that you resist not evil
[1:15:03] what
[1:15:05] resist not evil
[1:15:08] but whosoever shall smite thee on thy
[1:15:10] right cheek turn to him the other one
[1:15:12] also
[1:15:14] and if a man shall Sue thee at the law
[1:15:16] and take away thy coat lame have you
[1:15:19] cloak also
[1:15:20] and whosoever shall compel thee to go a
[1:15:22] mile go two miles
[1:15:25] give to him that asks this theme from
[1:15:27] him that would borrow thee turn not thou
[1:15:29] way
[1:15:31] you have heard that it has been said
[1:15:33] Thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor now watch
[1:15:35] Love Thy Neighbor and hate thine enemy
[1:15:39] all right you have been you have hurt
[1:15:41] You've Been Told
[1:15:43] to love your neighbor
[1:15:46] and hate your enemy
[1:15:48] but I say until you love your enemies
[1:15:51] bless them that curse you
[1:15:54] how many of us have ever done that
[1:15:56] I didn't think so
[1:15:58] we got a long way to go
[1:16:01] bless them that curse you
[1:16:03] do good to them that hate you
[1:16:08] and pray for them
[1:16:11] which despitefully use you
[1:16:15] and persecute you
[1:16:18] hmm
[1:16:19] that you may be the children of your
[1:16:22] father which is in heaven
[1:16:24] for he maketh his son to rise on the
[1:16:26] evil and on the good and sendeth Reign
[1:16:29] on the just and the unjust for if you
[1:16:31] love them which love you what reward
[1:16:34] have you
[1:16:38] do not even the publicans do the same
[1:16:41] thing
[1:16:42] and if you salute your brethren only
[1:16:46] what do you more than others do not even
[1:16:48] the publicans also
[1:16:51] be therefore perfect now he comes all
[1:16:53] the way down through all that and tells
[1:16:55] us to be perfect even as your father in
[1:16:57] Heaven
[1:16:58] is perfect John 15 9 says as the father
[1:17:01] hath loved me so have I loved you
[1:17:03] continue ye in what my love
[1:17:07] which is agape love
[1:17:09] if you keep my Commandments you shall
[1:17:12] abide in my love
[1:17:14] all right even as I have kept my
[1:17:16] father's Commandments and abide in his
[1:17:19] love
[1:17:20] these things have I spoken unto you that
[1:17:22] my joy might remain in you and that your
[1:17:26] joy might be full
[1:17:28] this is my commandment
[1:17:32] everybody with me this is my commandment
[1:17:35] that you love one another as I have
[1:17:37] loved you
[1:17:39] greater love hath no man than this that
[1:17:42] a man lay down his life
[1:17:45] for his friends
[1:17:47] Divine love 1956.
[1:17:52] now we are facing a day now this is 1956
[1:17:54] before he preached statue of perfect man
[1:17:57] now we are faced in a day that when is
[1:17:59] prophesied that Brotherly Love would
[1:18:01] become a strange thing among people
[1:18:03] and it's to my humble belief now watch
[1:18:06] and it's to my humble belief that that
[1:18:09] is the greatest of all the gifts that's
[1:18:12] in God's Bible
[1:18:17] what was the two greatest Commandments
[1:18:19] they asked him and I'll read that maybe
[1:18:20] later on but what was it oh what's the
[1:18:23] two what's the greatest commandment he
[1:18:24] said number one
[1:18:26] love the Lord with all thy heart with
[1:18:28] all thy might
[1:18:29] what's the second one
[1:18:31] love thy neighbor as you love yourself
[1:18:33] he said you do these two you're doing
[1:18:36] real good
[1:18:38] you know if you do them too you won't
[1:18:39] have to worry about the other eight
[1:18:41] because you won't kill you won't steal
[1:18:43] you won't do those things
[1:18:45] that's my humble belief brother Brown
[1:18:47] says that this is the greatest of all
[1:18:49] the gifts that there is in God's Bible
[1:18:51] now listen here's here here standards
[1:18:53] brother random in 1956 and Prince Albert
[1:18:56] Saskatchewan he's right in the middle of
[1:18:59] the greatest healing campaign ever since
[1:19:02] Jesus Christ walks on the face of the
[1:19:03] Earth all right
[1:19:05] so you would think he would say the
[1:19:07] greatest gift would be the gift of
[1:19:09] Divine Healing
[1:19:12] if the Lord Jesus should stand on the
[1:19:15] platform tonight and look me in the face
[1:19:17] and say I'm going to give you your
[1:19:19] choice you can be a great person a great
[1:19:21] Minister I'll give you a gift of
[1:19:24] preaching the gospel which he did or
[1:19:26] I'll give you the gift of teaching the
[1:19:28] word which God did and I'll give you the
[1:19:30] gift of Prophecy which God did or I'll
[1:19:33] make you a prophet which God did or any
[1:19:36] of these other fine Gifts of Faith any
[1:19:38] of the gifts that's in the Bible I'll
[1:19:39] give them everyone to you but then I'll
[1:19:42] withhold love
[1:19:43] from you
[1:19:46] or either I'll give you love and
[1:19:49] withhold the gift from you
[1:19:51] I say Lord take all the gifts and let me
[1:19:54] have the love
[1:19:56] see for no matter how many gifts we got
[1:20:00] they will never do us any good except
[1:20:03] the love of God is the motive behind the
[1:20:07] gift
[1:20:08] we must have
[1:20:10] love brother random 1957 I will restore
[1:20:14] it
[1:20:16] they had brotherly love and they weren't
[1:20:18] greedy they sold everything they had for
[1:20:21] the furthering of the church they were
[1:20:23] so together to leave him when one heard
[1:20:24] the other one died they said let's go
[1:20:26] and die with him such a failing now
[1:20:29] Jesus spoke of this and said let
[1:20:30] Brotherly Love continue that was in the
[1:20:32] first church but look but something's
[1:20:34] taking place and there was a fellow
[1:20:36] command by the name of the Palmer worm
[1:20:37] we talked about a little bit this
[1:20:38] morning and when he began to eat on that
[1:20:40] vine of Brotherly Love he cut the very
[1:20:42] sight line of it because it don't make
[1:20:45] any difference how smart we are how much
[1:20:47] we think we know or how much we want to
[1:20:50] be different from somebody else as long
[1:20:53] as that brotherly feeling isn't among us
[1:20:55] we're fighting a losing battle
[1:20:57] that's right we can't win there's no way
[1:21:00] for us to win
[1:21:03] so why are we not winning why do we not
[1:21:04] have Victory maybe we need to work on
[1:21:06] our brother kindness
[1:21:09] maybe we need to work on our brotherly
[1:21:11] love
[1:21:12] Christ revealed in his own word 1965.
[1:21:20] there was a certain person
[1:21:21] said to me said I believe you're an
[1:21:23] antichrist I said if that would be
[1:21:25] pleasing to my Lord
[1:21:27] that's what I want to be
[1:21:29] God bless God I'm a prophet
[1:21:31] don't you call me that
[1:21:34] he's okay buddy if that would be
[1:21:37] pleasing to my Lord I'd be fine
[1:21:39] I want to be whatever he wants me to be
[1:21:41] I love him and if he should cast me into
[1:21:43] hell I still will love it if I go with
[1:21:45] the same spirit I have now he looked at
[1:21:48] me kind of strange well praise God he
[1:21:50] probably never heard that before I seen
[1:21:52] four or five of them there young men
[1:21:53] young wives fine women I know how them
[1:21:56] boys love their wives so I said I said
[1:21:58] now here's a way to test it if you're a
[1:22:01] wife before you were married now you go
[1:22:02] back and say this married life now this
[1:22:04] is gonna be a hard one
[1:22:06] this is hard this is tough
[1:22:09] I don't know if I could give June to
[1:22:10] somebody else a pre-marriage
[1:22:15] why are you quiet for
[1:22:18] I'm not going to ask her if she would
[1:22:19] and I'm just saying I would
[1:22:25] you've been dreaming you were married
[1:22:27] you really wasn't married but you
[1:22:28] dreamed you were and you woke up and you
[1:22:31] went and you talked over with your
[1:22:32] girlfriend said you know I dreamed that
[1:22:34] we were married and we had children we
[1:22:36] lived happy and waiting for the coming
[1:22:38] of the Lord and everything and then this
[1:22:40] girl would say to you you know I love
[1:22:42] another man better than I love you
[1:22:44] thank you
[1:22:46] I could be happier with the other man
[1:22:49] could you from your heart
[1:22:52] love her well enough to say God's
[1:22:55] blessings rest on you my dear go with
[1:22:57] this other man
[1:23:01] I want you to think about that one
[1:23:04] now check that each of you men are you
[1:23:06] women see well if your love is correct
[1:23:09] you would do that
[1:23:11] for you are interested in her welfare
[1:23:14] why because we want to be selfish and
[1:23:17] say no I'm in love with you I want you
[1:23:20] for myself
[1:23:22] what you know you could have her
[1:23:24] you can live with her she's your wife
[1:23:27] you she will be she'll marry you but she
[1:23:30] won't be happy
[1:23:31] she would be happier and then if you
[1:23:33] love her then you want her to be happy
[1:23:35] therefore whatever the will of God is
[1:23:37] let God's will be done whether I'm happy
[1:23:39] with it or not I want to live so
[1:23:43] he will be pleased with what I do
[1:23:47] therefore check your objective and
[1:23:49] you're motive by that you know whether
[1:23:51] you love God or not what if he'd say you
[1:23:55] serve me if I'm going to cast you away
[1:23:56] he said I love you anyway
[1:24:00] now let's look at this word right here
[1:24:03] selfish
[1:24:04] to be selfish is to be concerned
[1:24:07] excessively or exclusively with oneself
[1:24:11] selfishness is one of the biggest
[1:24:13] obstacles to having the kind of close
[1:24:15] relationship with God and inspiring
[1:24:18] relationship with other people that many
[1:24:20] of us desire
[1:24:25] they sell selfie sticks
[1:24:27] go figure
[1:24:29] so they can take a picture of you
[1:24:31] now so they can take a picture of
[1:24:35] this house
[1:24:37] and send it to somebody that took a
[1:24:38] picture of their self
[1:24:41] and you can they compare sounds
[1:24:44] I just don't get these these um um uh
[1:24:48] YouTube influencers or these uh we call
[1:24:51] them um social media influencers
[1:24:55] I'm eating cheeseburger I'm going the
[1:24:57] bathroom I got a friend look at my dress
[1:25:00] look at my shoes
[1:25:05] and they get paid for that
[1:25:09] selfish
[1:25:11] selfish
[1:25:13] we've got to get rid of selfishness
[1:25:16] and you know what selfishness is you owe
[1:25:19] me
[1:25:23] you owe me
[1:25:25] God don't owe you nothing
[1:25:28] you owe everything to him
[1:25:31] God don't owe you nothing
[1:25:33] you owe everything in the world look he
[1:25:35] was so unselfish he died for people that
[1:25:37] didn't even want to
[1:25:39] he died for people he knew didn't want
[1:25:41] him
[1:25:42] and he died anyway
[1:25:44] that's love
[1:25:48] Paul says I am crucified with Christ
[1:25:50] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[1:25:53] lived within me and to life which I now
[1:25:56] live now remember I preached a bunch of
[1:25:58] sermons on this because that proves to
[1:26:00] you one thing Paul had another life
[1:26:03] because he said to laugh I now live
[1:26:05] In the Flesh I live by the faith of the
[1:26:08] Son of God who loved me and gave himself
[1:26:11] for me
[1:26:13] Galatians 2 20 teaches us that living by
[1:26:15] faith in the Son of God means you no
[1:26:17] longer live
[1:26:19] but Jesus lives in you what is our
[1:26:22] biggest problem us who gets in the way
[1:26:24] Jesus no us
[1:26:27] we get in the way so if you want to have
[1:26:29] a close relationship with God and other
[1:26:31] people you'll need to learn to leave
[1:26:33] yourself behind
[1:26:37] I like that
[1:26:39] second Timothy proves it for men shall
[1:26:41] be lovers of their own selves
[1:26:44] covetous
[1:26:45] boasters
[1:26:48] proud
[1:26:49] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:26:51] unthankful
[1:26:53] and Unholy
[1:26:54] brother Brown in 1950 said I tell you
[1:26:58] that's what's a whole lot of matter with
[1:26:59] the people today they're not friendly
[1:27:01] like they used to be the people have got
[1:27:03] too selfish got to a place where they
[1:27:06] think that now this is 1950.
[1:27:11] listen
[1:27:12] 1969 and 70 when I come well 74 when I
[1:27:16] started driving 75
[1:27:18] I didn't drive in the 60s done he did
[1:27:22] you waved at everybody
[1:27:24] there wasn't no such thing as road rage
[1:27:26] when I was growing up was it road rage
[1:27:28] when you sue I mean as bad as you drive
[1:27:31] they still not road rage
[1:27:36] I mean you might have made somebody mad
[1:27:37] but you didn't shoot them for it
[1:27:40] run them off the road
[1:27:44] you might have got the middle finger of
[1:27:46] fate award but that was about it now
[1:27:50] they'll shoot you
[1:27:51] why the love of Manny's wax cold there's
[1:27:53] no love for people there's no love for
[1:27:55] listen there's no love for life
[1:27:57] there's no love for life life is just
[1:27:59] whatever doesn't matter
[1:28:01] shoot bang bang you know whatever so the
[1:28:04] people's got two selfies got to the
[1:28:05] place where they think they live in a
[1:28:07] little world oh praise the Lord they
[1:28:10] live in the lower World by themselves
[1:28:12] you know that's the truth
[1:28:15] you know it used to be I own a farm when
[1:28:16] one of the neighbors got sick we'd go
[1:28:19] out and help him
[1:28:20] right
[1:28:22] that don't happen no more
[1:28:24] if your neighbor died it takes you two
[1:28:25] or three years
[1:28:27] read it somewhere on social media or in
[1:28:30] the paper
[1:28:31] 's about gone now
[1:28:33] you cut the wood and bring it in
[1:28:36] I remember dating him telling how
[1:28:38] somebody gets sick and the sharecroppers
[1:28:40] well they're gonna lose a crop everybody
[1:28:42] just pitched in and went out there and
[1:28:43] sold the crop and got everything ready
[1:28:45] for them you can't do that now
[1:28:49] you don't even know your neighbor's dead
[1:28:51] unless you read it in the paper now
[1:28:52] that's brother random in 1950.
[1:28:55] selfish people passed down the street
[1:28:58] used to we'd grab a whole one another's
[1:28:59] hand and shake their hand like that and
[1:29:00] say how are you brother today when they
[1:29:02] passed on the street they give a little
[1:29:04] silly grin now listen
[1:29:06] I'm gonna find that quote because he
[1:29:09] actually did that
[1:29:11] he's telling on himself
[1:29:14] because you're gonna see where Mita says
[1:29:16] bill
[1:29:18] did you not see that was sister so and
[1:29:20] so
[1:29:21] he said yeah
[1:29:23] she said well you just Grand and nodded
[1:29:26] your head
[1:29:28] a little silly grin throwing their head
[1:29:31] up in the air oh my no wonder loves gone
[1:29:33] his wife rebuked him I'll find a quote
[1:29:35] and I'll read it to you I despise that
[1:29:37] old somebody feel that they're bigger
[1:29:39] than somebody else after all you're six
[1:29:41] foot of Earth that's all you are that's
[1:29:42] right
[1:29:43] brother remember in 1954 we'll close
[1:29:45] right here the world coming
[1:29:47] word becoming flesh this is when he took
[1:29:50] the India trip and came back I
[1:29:52] recognized the other day a selfish
[1:29:53] Spirit coming on me of saying this man's
[1:29:56] wrong I ought to tell him about it
[1:29:58] that's wrong God's the one to tell him
[1:30:00] about it and it's none of my business
[1:30:02] but my business is to preach the gospel
[1:30:04] and love everybody and move on and love
[1:30:06] my enemies as Jesus loved me when I was
[1:30:09] his enemy whoa
[1:30:12] when I was his enemy
[1:30:14] remember he didn't unlove you
[1:30:17] he was just waiting on you to love him
[1:30:20] he loved me
[1:30:21] to his bosom when I was unlovely he led
[1:30:25] me to his bosom and anybody that's
[1:30:26] unlovely let me love him the same let
[1:30:28] the spirit that was in Christ be in US
[1:30:31] amen 1954 what you think of Christ let's
[1:30:33] stand our feet musicians come
[1:30:36] some people are so narrow-minded I like
[1:30:39] this quote you got to think about it
[1:30:41] because they don't hardly make pencils
[1:30:43] anymore
[1:30:44] everybody know what a pencil is
[1:30:47] okay well some of the young ones are
[1:30:49] going
[1:30:50] um that was a they asked me to come and
[1:30:53] and notarize some paperwork the other
[1:30:55] day at a house brother John and I walked
[1:30:57] in the house to notarize it and and they
[1:30:59] were all right they were older you know
[1:31:01] my age and older and they were writing
[1:31:03] it all they had right like a little
[1:31:05] summation of whatever it was and I had
[1:31:06] to stamp it you know sign it so I didn't
[1:31:09] I didn't read it I just looked over it
[1:31:10] it was all in cursive writing
[1:31:14] well that ain't the problem the problem
[1:31:17] is one of the ladies said I handed this
[1:31:20] to my grandson to read and he said
[1:31:22] Grandma I can't read cursive writing
[1:31:24] they don't ain't teaching anymore it's
[1:31:27] all black letters
[1:31:28] computers do not write in cursive only
[1:31:31] humans write in cursive if you know one
[1:31:34] I don't know one it's all block letters
[1:31:37] said Grandma I can't read this it's in
[1:31:39] cursive
[1:31:40] could not read
[1:31:42] frightened well anyway some people are
[1:31:45] coming their minded you you put a lead
[1:31:48] pencil between their eyes and they'd
[1:31:49] blind them
[1:31:53] think about that
[1:31:54] for those of you that don't know that
[1:31:56] that means if you put a pencil right
[1:31:57] here it'd put both eyes out because you
[1:31:59] so narrow-minded that's why brother
[1:32:01] listen it's a quote
[1:32:03] they just don't look to both sides they
[1:32:06] got some little Theory what selfishness
[1:32:08] and run away with it you have to stop
[1:32:11] and look the thing over
[1:32:12] Romans 12 verse 9 says let love be
[1:32:15] without the simulation aboard that which
[1:32:17] is evil cleave to that which is good be
[1:32:20] kindly affectionate one to another with
[1:32:22] brotherly love and honor preferring one
[1:32:24] another Luke 6 verse 26 says War unto
[1:32:27] you when all men shall speak well of you
[1:32:29] praise the Lord
[1:32:32] told me a long years ago when I was
[1:32:35] growing up he said he said son if
[1:32:37] everybody likes you you're a hypocrite
[1:32:41] think about that
[1:32:43] because that means you swayed over to
[1:32:45] this group you swayed over to this group
[1:32:47] you swayed to make this one and we try
[1:32:49] to make everybody happy but you can't
[1:32:51] please everybody trust me I'm a mayor of
[1:32:53] a city of 300 people
[1:32:56] and they're 90 of them first cousins are
[1:33:00] uncles and aunts so
[1:33:02] one do you and all men shall speak well
[1:33:04] of you for so did their fathers to the
[1:33:06] false prophets but I say unto you which
[1:33:09] here love your enemies do good to them
[1:33:12] which hate you bless them that curse you
[1:33:15] and pray for them which despitefully use
[1:33:19] you in that word despitefully means
[1:33:21] falsely accuse you
[1:33:23] hmm can we do that and to him that's
[1:33:26] smarteth one cheek offering the other
[1:33:28] him to taketh away the cloak give them
[1:33:30] your coat give her every man that asks
[1:33:33] us of and of him that taketh away Goods
[1:33:35] asked him not again and as you would
[1:33:38] that men should do to you do you also to
[1:33:40] them likewise in other words do unto
[1:33:43] others as you would have them do unto
[1:33:44] you
[1:33:45] for if you love them which love you
[1:33:49] what thank have you
[1:33:51] in other words where is overcoming love
[1:33:53] somebody loving somebody that just loves
[1:33:56] you
[1:33:57] for Sinners also love those that love
[1:34:00] them and if you do good to them which do
[1:34:03] good to you what think have you
[1:34:06] for Sinners also do even the same
[1:34:09] and if I lend to them
[1:34:11] whom you hope to receive what think of
[1:34:13] you for Sinners also lend the Sinners to
[1:34:15] receive as much again
[1:34:18] but love your enemies
[1:34:20] and do good and lend hoping for nothing
[1:34:24] again
[1:34:25] that's where you get down to where
[1:34:28] feel your love is conditional
[1:34:32] if I buy you a car you got to buy me a
[1:34:34] car
[1:34:35] you know or if I give you 500 you owe me
[1:34:39] something that's not a gift
[1:34:43] hoping for nothing again and your reward
[1:34:46] look and your rewards shall be great
[1:34:49] so it's not going to give you you have
[1:34:51] no reward your reward is great by what
[1:34:53] giving unconditionally and you shall be
[1:34:56] the children of the highest for he is
[1:34:57] kind unto the unthankful and to the evil
[1:35:02] we love him because he first love us if
[1:35:04] a man say I love God and hate us his
[1:35:06] brother he is a liar
[1:35:09] wow
[1:35:11] I've heard some of you
[1:35:14] I don't like this person I don't like
[1:35:16] this preacher
[1:35:18] so what
[1:35:19] you're a liar
[1:35:22] I'm just reading you the Bible
[1:35:24] if a man says I love God and hateth this
[1:35:26] brother or his brother he's a liar
[1:35:29] for he that loveth not his brother whom
[1:35:31] he has seen how can he love God whom he
[1:35:34] has not seen and this commandment have
[1:35:36] we from him that he who loveth God
[1:35:39] loveth his brother also
[1:35:42] First John 3 verse 13 says Marvel not my
[1:35:45] brethren if the world hates you praise
[1:35:47] God
[1:35:48] we know that we have passed from Death
[1:35:51] in the life because we love the Brethren
[1:35:53] he that loveth not his brother abideth
[1:35:56] and death
[1:35:58] whosoever hate us his brother is a
[1:36:00] murderer
[1:36:01] and you know that no murderer has
[1:36:04] eternal life abiding in him
[1:36:08] hereby perceive we the love of God
[1:36:10] because he laid down his life for us and
[1:36:12] we ought to lay our down our lives for
[1:36:15] the Brethren but who so hath this
[1:36:17] world's goods and see if his brother
[1:36:19] have need and shutters up his bowels of
[1:36:22] compassion from him how dwelleth the
[1:36:24] love of God
[1:36:25] in him my little children let us not
[1:36:28] love in the word neither in tongue but
[1:36:31] in deed in truth
[1:36:33] first Peter 3 verse 8 says finally be
[1:36:36] all of One mind having compassion one of
[1:36:38] another love as Brethren be pitiful be
[1:36:41] courteous
[1:36:42] not rendering evil for evil or railing
[1:36:45] for railing but contrary wise blessings
[1:36:49] knowing that you are there unto called
[1:36:52] that you should inherit a blessing
[1:36:56] for he that will love life and see good
[1:36:58] days let him refrain his tongue from
[1:37:00] evil and his lips that they speak no God
[1:37:04] and this is one I read
[1:37:09] he wanted himself let's go to Mark 11
[1:37:10] then we'll I'm going to try to get these
[1:37:12] finished therefore I say unto you what
[1:37:14] things whatsoever you desire When you
[1:37:17] pray believe that you receive them and
[1:37:20] you shall have them now wait a minute
[1:37:21] that sounds good
[1:37:24] but the Lord Jesus said and when you
[1:37:26] stand praying forgive
[1:37:29] if you have ought against any that your
[1:37:32] father also which is in heaven May
[1:37:34] forgive you
[1:37:37] but if you do not forgive
[1:37:41] neither will your father which is in
[1:37:44] heaven forgive you
[1:37:48] it'll do your no good
[1:37:50] to Harbor a grudge
[1:37:53] our Harbor ill feelings
[1:37:56] because you've just shut yourself off
[1:37:59] from God forgiven you for what you did
[1:38:02] can I read that again and when you stand
[1:38:05] praying forgive
[1:38:07] if you have ought against any that your
[1:38:10] father also which is in heaven May
[1:38:12] forgive you
[1:38:13] your trespasses
[1:38:15] but if you do not forgive neither were
[1:38:18] your father in Heaven forgive your
[1:38:20] trespasses
[1:38:22] hmm
[1:38:24] wow we can we stop on that one
[1:38:27] but if you do not forgive
[1:38:30] neither will your father which is in
[1:38:32] heaven well I've got a wrap you know how
[1:38:35] to ride it all
[1:38:37] you do not have a right to rail
[1:38:41] I'm breeding a scripture you don't have
[1:38:43] a right to do that
[1:38:45] but that's why when we get ready to take
[1:38:47] communion what do we do we stop
[1:38:50] right we stop and have a moment of
[1:38:52] Silent prayer and that's what I do
[1:38:54] brother John I do the checklist thing
[1:38:56] have I done this have I done that have I
[1:38:58] done this have I done that unwillingly I
[1:39:00] might have done something that I don't
[1:39:01] know about please Lord bring into my
[1:39:03] attention or if I have willingly done
[1:39:04] something like brother Brown said if you
[1:39:06] know you've done something he said go
[1:39:07] and take communion but you better go
[1:39:08] make that right because God Will Make
[1:39:10] sure you do make that right one way or
[1:39:12] the other right that's why we have a
[1:39:14] moment of silence that when we can stand
[1:39:17] praying or when we can stand and take
[1:39:18] communion that what our heart doesn't
[1:39:21] condemn us as the Bible says it won't
[1:39:23] condemn me like I told you all before
[1:39:24] and I I told you from right here
[1:39:28] I said something bad
[1:39:33] that's why I don't say bad things about
[1:39:34] preachers I don't care if he comes up
[1:39:36] here and preaches the false Doctrine
[1:39:40] you just correct didn't go on
[1:39:43] but but
[1:39:45] I had an audience to brother
[1:39:48] and it bothered me
[1:39:50] and it was hindering my walk
[1:39:53] but you know what I still let it go on
[1:39:54] for several months because you know what
[1:39:56] I'm human
[1:39:58] but finally the Lord pretty much said
[1:40:00] you're not going anywhere until you get
[1:40:02] this worked out
[1:40:04] so you know what was the most freeing
[1:40:05] thing in the world was making that phone
[1:40:07] call
[1:40:09] I said brother I said something about
[1:40:11] you that I shouldn't have said
[1:40:13] and I'm sorry
[1:40:15] you know what he said he said brother
[1:40:17] wait he said you're forgiven he said
[1:40:18] you're forgiven when you asked first
[1:40:20] right the first moment
[1:40:22] and he said when you come up says come
[1:40:24] preach for me
[1:40:26] and boy I felt good after that goodness
[1:40:28] gracious like I had took a shower
[1:40:31] and I had mud all over me brother John I
[1:40:34] I was just I just felt so good
[1:40:37] well guess what I stood and confessed I
[1:40:41] stood and asked forgiveness
[1:40:43] that's why I always tell you when I pray
[1:40:45] when somebody else is praying for people
[1:40:47] up here I don't pray for that person
[1:40:49] it's between that person and their
[1:40:51] connection is right here the anointing's
[1:40:53] on this man all right the anointing's
[1:40:55] right here
[1:40:56] what I'm saying is Lord don't let me and
[1:40:59] my unbelief something I did today
[1:41:01] something I said cross something I said
[1:41:04] wrong to a brother or a sister don't let
[1:41:06] that hinder because brother Brown said
[1:41:08] one unconfessed sin in a congregation
[1:41:10] will cause the whole congregation to

[1:41:19] judgment and have to give an account
[1:41:20] while that person didn't because they're
[1:41:21] healing because I was standing back
