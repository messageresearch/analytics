[0:01] all right here we
[0:02] go we're live good morning good
[0:06] morning hi good morning
[0:09] Bob brother teacher
[0:12] Bob preacher
[0:17] Bob all right let's turn to Matthew
[0:20] Chapter
[0:21] 5 we're um continuing on with the
[0:25] merciful and the pure in heart and um
[0:28] talk louder yeah I'm to talk loud so
[0:30] everybody can hear me thank
[0:33] you he said he'll try to talk loud the
[0:36] Elder the
[0:39] Elder if you're going to sit back there
[0:41] and be all comfortable and lean up
[0:43] against the thing and be all comfortable
[0:44] you going have to talk loud we need a
[0:47] little amplifier this microphone on
[0:50] Monica can hear him okay yeah as long as
[0:53] Monica can
[0:56] he all
[0:58] right blessed are the
[1:01] merciful for they shall obtain Mercy
[1:05] blessed are the pure in heart for they
[1:07] shall see
[1:08] God so we left off I want to kind of
[1:12] remember last time we were talking about
[1:13] how these can be grouped in two to help
[1:16] to better understand so today I'm kind
[1:18] of going to group merciful and pure in
[1:20] heart together and read a scripture from
[1:23] Exodus that really ill
[1:25] illustrates um how this is made manifest
[1:30] in us and um but take a step back I put
[1:34] this picture up here this is one of the
[1:35] new pictures from the Hubble telescope
[1:37] of this new spiral galaxy that they took
[1:40] way out in space and U this is just one
[1:43] of thousands of galaxies and each galaxy
[1:47] has millions of stars so think about
[1:49] before the Earth the foundation of the
[1:52] world when the logos went out and out of
[1:54] him came the word to create the universe
[1:58] the worlds everything each each one of
[2:01] these Stars might have you know 10 or so
[2:03] planets spinning around them and uh and
[2:07] then that same one that spoke these
[2:10] worlds into existence when he went up
[2:13] the mountain and spoke these Beatitudes
[2:15] that same word spoke these blessings to
[2:19] us to be made manifest in us and he
[2:22] promised there's a promise that my word
[2:24] will not return to me void that means
[2:26] that everything that I say it will
[2:28] accomplish the purpose that it will set
[2:29] forth to do and when the word went out
[2:32] from him in the beginning it did exactly
[2:34] what it was meant to do which was to
[2:36] form the worlds into existence and these
[2:39] blessings that we're reading about how
[2:42] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[2:43] theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed
[2:45] are they that mourn for they shall be
[2:47] comforted all of these words that went
[2:49] out from Christ will be made manifest in
[2:51] us and such a wonderful promise that we
[2:54] have that his word will not return to
[2:56] him void it will accomplish exactly what
[2:58] he said he said it with would
[3:00] do
[3:02] so blessed are the
[3:05] merciful for they shall obtain mercy and
[3:08] we kind of talked before about how you
[3:10] really can't show Mercy unless God has
[3:13] unless you have seen Mercy in your life
[3:16] and then after the New Birth then God
[3:18] begins to deal with you based on your
[3:20] your actions how you treat others he'll
[3:23] show you uh he'll he'll treat you as as
[3:26] you treat others if you uh are um
[3:32] showing forth Christ God will show his
[3:36] Mercy to you but Salvation is not based
[3:40] on works right so I wanted to talk about
[3:44] what Mercy is not and this is a this is
[3:46] a papus that uh I guess you say Papyrus
[3:51] not
[3:53] Papyrus this is this is a Papyrus from
[3:56] the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead
[3:58] and what they believe beli uh the way
[4:00] they believed um was that the son God
[4:04] raw would uh every day it would go
[4:06] through it cycle of of of uh birth in
[4:09] the morning it would be born the son God
[4:12] R will be born and go through an aging
[4:14] process in the evening will go Beyond
[4:16] the Horizon and at after it would go
[4:19] down under the Horizon it would go into
[4:21] the what's depicted here is the
[4:23] underworld and when when when raw went
[4:26] into the underworld he would uh battle
[4:28] with the serpent
[4:30] every night he would do battle with with
[4:33] a serpent and be resurrected the next
[4:35] morning as the sun in the sky that that
[4:38] the Egyptians would look up and
[4:41] see and uh so they believe that when you
[4:44] died if if you had enough wealth for
[4:47] people to build you a nice enough grave
[4:50] for people to bring you food because
[4:52] they believe that food was and things
[4:54] like that were essential for your your
[4:56] journey into afterlife then possibly POS
[4:59] L you would get to meet
[5:02] um I'm drawing a blank at what these
[5:05] God's names are right now but uh you
[5:07] would go through a uh the book of the
[5:09] deal was kind of a
[5:11] uh how to go through the perils and and
[5:15] trials in the afterlife and once you
[5:18] went through c a few certain trials then
[5:20] You' come to this scale where they would
[5:23] take your heart and this is a uh
[5:25] according to the commentators and so
[5:28] forth this is a scribe
[5:30] whose heart is being weighed on the
[5:31] scale based on his good works that's how
[5:35] a lot of people interpret Mercy the
[5:37] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[5:39] receive Mercy as if you're merciful to
[5:42] other people in your life then God will
[5:44] save you yeah but that's uh that's kind
[5:47] of like what the Egyptians believe that
[5:49] they believe that through your life if
[5:52] you did bad Works your heart would get
[5:54] heavier and if you did good works your
[5:56] heart would get lighter so on the other
[5:58] end of the scale they would weigh your
[6:00] heart against the ostrich feather of the
[6:04] god M that was the god of Truth and
[6:07] Justice and they would balance that out
[6:09] how would you like to have your heart
[6:10] weight against the feather based on your
[6:11] good
[6:13] works not not by own righteousness but
[6:19] uh by his righteousness the only way
[6:21] that will so that's if if their heart
[6:25] weighed lighter than the ostrich Fe then
[6:27] they could proceed to the god of irus
[6:29] and enter into uh their their version of
[6:34] paradise but I just wanted to I thought
[6:37] that Illustrated good pretty good what
[6:41] um well they have nothing else to go by
[6:43] right they didn't have a Bible they
[6:45] didn't have anything right and they just
[6:46] look up at the stars and and see didn't
[6:49] really
[6:50] understand let's go to Exodus
[6:58] 12
[7:02] and read about the past
[7:05] service remember we're thinking about
[7:07] mercy and being pure in heart
[7:16] together
[7:17] 12 1
[7:20] uh yes
[7:28] 121
[7:33] no 12:14
[7:41] sorry sorry 12
[7:52] 12 you got to be more you got to be more
[7:56] consistent now remember when uh the
[7:59] first first thing that Moses told
[8:00] Pharaoh when he went down into Egypt
[8:03] was Israel is my firstborn the word from
[8:07] the Lord was Israel is my first born
[8:09] give me my firstborn let them go and
[8:11] worship or I will take your first
[8:16] born so verse
[8:21] 12 I'm I'm thinking through a lot of
[8:24] thoughts um Israel God had given Israel
[8:28] a leader
[8:30] in Moses and then they gave they gave
[8:33] signs and wonders evidence that God was
[8:36] among them they saw all the signs and
[8:39] wonders they saw the uh The Hil storm
[8:42] turned The Hil turned into fire and the
[8:44] water turned into the blood and the
[8:46] frogs and the Locust and the lice and
[8:49] all of the many things that God had done
[8:51] but none of those things would let them
[8:53] go free the only way that they could go
[8:55] free was when a PRI the price had been
[8:58] paid and applied over the
[9:02] door and uh it didn't matter whether you
[9:04] were Israelite or Egyptian when the when
[9:07] the uh the death angel came through the
[9:09] land right and the Death Angel was God
[9:12] it's not like the um that Ten
[9:13] Commandments movie where it makes it
[9:15] seem like it's some evil that all
[9:16] through the scripture God said I I will
[9:19] come I will come it wasn't
[9:22] um some spooky something like in that
[9:26] movie where some Mist I I I kind of
[9:28] disagree with that
[9:29] um so uh it didn't matter whether you
[9:33] were Israelite or Egyptian if you didn't
[9:35] have that blood applied over the door of
[9:38] your heart or over over your door then
[9:41] then uh the death angel would not pass
[9:43] so let's look at
[9:45] um I'm trying to okay let's start at
[9:49] verse 12 for I will pass through the
[9:50] land of Egypt this night and will Smite
[9:52] all the firstborn in the land of Egypt
[9:53] both man and Beast and against all the
[9:55] gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I
[9:57] am the Lord and the blood blood shall be
[9:59] to you for a token upon the houses where
[10:01] you are and when I see the blood I will
[10:02] pass over you and the plague shall not
[10:04] be upon you to destroy you when I smite
[10:05] the land of Egypt and this day shall be
[10:08] unto you for a memorial and you shall
[10:09] keep it a feast to the Lord throughout
[10:11] your Generations you shall keep it a
[10:13] feast by an ordinance forever seven days
[10:16] shall you eat unleavened bread even the
[10:18] first day you shall put away leaven out
[10:20] of your houses for whosoever eateth
[10:22] leaven bread from the first day until
[10:24] the seventh day that sh Soul shall be
[10:27] cut off from Israel and and that's what
[10:29] I mean about tying mercy and Purity
[10:31] together they took they put away all the
[10:34] leavon out of their house and to this
[10:35] day the Jews still have during the
[10:37] Passover they will do a little thing
[10:39] where they uh they they make the little
[10:41] uh cakes they put like dough throughout
[10:44] their house they hide it call Mah M
[10:47] thank you m I knew you were looking for
[10:49] that M I bought some one time you can
[10:52] buy it in the store y real thin cracker
[10:55] like thing with
[10:57] stripes they just don't know about the
[10:58] stri strip stand for that's good the
[11:01] body of Jesus cuz it's got stripes in
[11:03] it's got holes in it yeah that's good
[11:06] I'm I'm never go to the store and ask
[11:09] one they got you know look public
[11:11] probably has it in the ethnic
[11:15] section yeah coer stuff but M so they uh
[11:21] that's good they'll put it in their
[11:23] house I didn't have to put it in my
[11:26] house already in my house right right
[11:29] they'll put it in their house to get rid
[11:31] of it first and go then go search it out
[11:33] and to commemorate this event of getting
[11:35] rid of the leav over seven days CU down
[11:37] through the seven Church ages right each
[11:40] uh during each each age you had to
[11:42] believe your word for that day your your
[11:46] word for that the word for Luther's day
[11:49] was justification if you were in
[11:51] Luther's day and believe well I'm save
[11:53] because uh my heart is lighter than an O
[11:56] Str so to speak then that wouldn't do
[12:00] it seven days shall you eat unleavened
[12:02] bread even the first day you shall put
[12:04] away leavon out of your houses for
[12:05] whosoever eateth leaven bread from the
[12:07] first day until the seventh day that
[12:09] Soul shall be cut off from Israel now
[12:12] it's talking about being pure in heart
[12:15] being pure and in the first day there
[12:17] shall be an holy convocation and in the
[12:19] seventh day there shall be an holy
[12:21] convocation do you know manner of work
[12:23] shall be done in them save that which
[12:25] every man must eat that only May that
[12:27] only may be done of you
[12:29] first and
[12:31] last after first and the seventh of the
[12:34] same very good and ye shall observe the
[12:38] Feast of unleaving bread for in this
[12:41] selfs same day have I brought your
[12:42] armies out of the land of Egypt
[12:44] therefore shall ye observe this day in
[12:47] your Generations by an ordinance forever
[12:50] in the first month on the 14th day of
[12:52] the month that even he shall eat un 11
[12:54] bread until the 1 and 20th day of the
[12:58] month at even right seven days shall
[13:01] there be no leaven found in your houses
[13:02] for whosoever eateth that which is
[13:04] leaven even that Soul shall be cut off
[13:07] from the congregation of Israel whether
[13:10] he be a stranger or born in the land he
[13:13] shall eat nothing Leen in all your
[13:16] habitation shall ye eat unleavened bread
[13:19] then Moses called for all the Elders of
[13:21] Israel and said unto them draw out and
[13:22] take you a lamb according to your
[13:24] families and kill the Passover and you
[13:26] shall take a bunch of hisp and dip it in
[13:28] the blood that is in the Basin and
[13:29] strike the lenen and the two side post
[13:31] with the blood that is in the Basin and
[13:33] none of you shall go out at the door of
[13:34] his house until the morning for the Lord
[13:37] will pass through the Smite the
[13:38] Egyptians and when he seeth the blood
[13:41] upon the lenen and on the two side posts
[13:42] the Lord will pass over the door and
[13:44] will not suffer the Destroyer to come in
[13:46] unto your houses to Smite
[13:49] you and you shall observe this thing for
[13:51] an ordinance forever
[13:54] so God passed over them and gave them a
[13:56] remembrance something to remember that
[13:58] Day by uh to remember to always every
[14:02] year to celebrate the Passover and
[14:05] that's what they were doing last time we
[14:07] talked about the Ethiopia he came to
[14:09] Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover and
[14:11] he went through all these ordinances but
[14:13] he didn't have this the the mercy and
[14:16] the pureness of heart and these things
[14:18] we're talking about that only comes from
[14:19] the new birth and then uh numbers
[14:25] 3:13 after God redeemed you you're his
[14:29] you're not yours
[14:31] anymore at numbers 3:13 because all the
[14:34] firstborn are mine remember he went down
[14:36] he said Moses down to get the
[14:38] firstborn for on the day that I smed all
[14:41] the firstborn in the land of Egypt I
[14:43] hallowed unto me all the firstborn in
[14:45] Israel both man and Beast mine shall
[14:47] they be I am the Lord I like how he
[14:50] repeats it twice all the firstborn of
[14:52] mine mine shall they be and ends with I
[14:55] am the
[14:57] Lord once your you're saved you're not
[14:59] yours anymore you're God's
[15:03] amen now in Joshua the second chapter
[15:07] 18-9 the two spies that went to Rahab
[15:10] they remembered all of these remember
[15:13] all all of the ones that didn't believed
[15:15] and didn't go into cadis barnea they
[15:17] died off in the wilderness and what was
[15:19] left they were uh I just love reading
[15:21] through that story of how by the time
[15:23] they crossed the river Jordan they were
[15:24] walking in Step perfectly perfect
[15:27] harmony with God's word and they walked
[15:29] across and they were all believers till
[15:32] uh when they lost the battle because aen
[15:34] took the uh uh what he wasn't supposed
[15:38] to yeah um it was such a horrible thing
[15:43] to just lose a few people in that in
[15:45] that battle that they all went to prayer
[15:48] and I I think that's how we should be
[15:50] just if we don't get healed if we things
[15:52] don't go right we should all get on our
[15:54] knees and seek God just like they did
[15:56] that everything any everything would be
[15:58] uncovered that we live pure lives so
[16:03] these two spies that went over to Rahab
[16:05] they remembered that if you're under a
[16:08] covenant if you're under an atonement
[16:11] then you will be delivered so they told
[16:13] they they told reabold when we come into
[16:15] the land Thou shalt bind this line of
[16:17] scarlet thread in the window which thou
[16:19] that has led us down by and thou shalt
[16:21] bring thy father and thy mother and thy
[16:23] brother and all thy father's household
[16:24] home unto thee and it shall be that
[16:26] whosoever shall go out of the door of
[16:28] thy house into the street his blood
[16:30] shall be upon his head and we will be
[16:33] Guiltless and whosoever shall be with
[16:34] thee in the house his blood shall be on
[16:36] our head if any hand if any hand be upon
[16:38] him and
[16:40] uh see how Mercy is withholding judgment
[16:45] and if you reject Mercy judgment Falls
[16:48] because what is with hell uh comes upon
[16:51] you so that's why they're saying if
[16:54] anyone if Mercy is shown you got the
[16:56] Scarlet thread hanging out from the
[16:57] window and then you you come out from
[16:59] under that covering then the only thing
[17:01] left for you is
[17:02] judgment and even though she was on the
[17:04] walls of the city the most D seem like
[17:07] the most dangerous place to be uh you
[17:10] know why are we so worried about who's
[17:13] going to be the next president and
[17:15] everything right I just throw that out
[17:23] there now what about Christ when he was
[17:26] dying on the cross real Mercy
[17:30] comes from something God gives you then
[17:32] Jesus father forgive them for they know
[17:34] not what they do while he was dying on
[17:36] the cross they had killed him uh and
[17:39] taking his life and
[17:41] uh I had a conversation with Zach on the
[17:44] way home last night about how he he was
[17:46] only on the cross for three hours so he
[17:48] it said he gave up the ghost they didn't
[17:50] they didn't take it from him he gave it
[17:51] up he was in total control over the
[17:53] whole situation that's right and they
[17:55] parted his arment and cast
[17:57] lots and then Luke 23:46 and when Jesus
[18:00] had cried with a loud voice he said
[18:02] father into thy hands I commend my
[18:04] spirit and having said th he gave up the
[18:06] ghost so now when that same life comes
[18:10] into came into the
[18:16] church they they heard what Steven
[18:19] said and they they took him out and
[18:22] stone him just like Jesus said if they
[18:25] hate me what are they going to do to you
[18:28] and they stoned Steven calling upon God
[18:30] and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit
[18:33] the same thing that Jesus said on the
[18:34] cross and he KNE down and cry with a
[18:37] loud voice Lord lay not this sin to
[18:39] their charge and when he had said this
[18:42] he fell asleep because the light the
[18:44] same life that was in Christ is now in
[18:46] him it makes you act
[18:51] different blessed are the pure in heart
[18:54] for they shall see
[18:57] God that's what we're going to talk
[18:59] about next now you can say well the
[19:04] Pharisees the Pharisees had the life cuz
[19:07] you could you couldn't hold a candle to
[19:10] their life but they didn't have what I'm
[19:12] talking about now they didn't there's no
[19:14] way they could talk about Mercy they
[19:16] they took that woman they found in
[19:18] adultery and threw at Jesus feet and
[19:20] said kill her that's a different that's
[19:22] a diff that's not the same life that was
[19:24] in Steven that said father forgive Lord
[19:27] forgive them
[19:29] and the Pharisees Jesus said but woe
[19:31] unto you scribes and Pharisees
[19:33] Hypocrites for ye shut up the Kingdom of
[19:35] Heaven against men for ye neither go in
[19:38] yourselves neither suffer ye them that
[19:40] are entering to go in so they the
[19:43] Pharisees looked okay on the outside by
[19:45] all everything on the outside they were
[19:47] doing they were uh going to church doing
[19:49] everything exactly right but there's
[19:51] something lacking on the inside if you
[19:54] take a look at the inside like Jesus
[19:56] said there they they were like white
[19:58] wash simpers they were they were painted
[20:00] on the outside but on the inside dead
[20:02] men's bones woe unto you scribes and
[20:05] Pharisees Hypocrites for ye paay tith
[20:07] and mint and anise and cumin and have
[20:10] omitted the weigher matters of the law
[20:13] they were so worried about in their in
[20:15] their little uh uh spice cabinet how
[20:19] much tithe they pay of of their little
[20:21] spices but they weren't worrying about
[20:24] judgment mercy and Faith what we're
[20:27] talking about now these you to have done
[20:29] and not to leave the other
[20:31] undone remember I read a quote a couple
[20:33] of weeks ago about brother BR said you
[20:35] you uh you desire God and you come to
[20:38] the Altar and you pray and you say God
[20:39] help me but then you won't actually do
[20:42] what God's word requires you'll uh uh uh
[20:47] it it's more than just being spiritual
[20:50] it's uh do what do what God's word asks
[20:53] you to do right right Matthew 23:25 26
[20:57] Lo un you scribes and Pharisees
[20:59] Hypocrites for you make cing the outside
[21:02] of the cup and the platter but within
[21:04] they are full of extortion and excess
[21:07] Thou blind F he cleanse first that which
[21:09] is within the cup and platter that the
[21:12] outside of them may be clean also so now
[21:16] we're talking about Pharisees let's
[21:17] slide it up to this day and talk about
[21:20] the five foolish vergins remember uh the
[21:24] Bible Jesus told the parable of the of
[21:26] the 10 virgins and a virgin is Pure
[21:29] Living a a pure life now you could say
[21:32] that the Pharisees were living a pure
[21:34] life but there was something that was a
[21:37] different kind of Purity than than what
[21:39] comes by the new birth in you that's
[21:41] right and you can look at the the all
[21:44] the the 10 versions and say well
[21:46] everybody is living a pure life but five
[21:47] of them had the power of God in their
[21:50] life and the other five uh maybe one
[21:54] day when they realized the Rapture had
[21:57] come or when they when they will realize
[21:59] the Rapture had come realize that oh
[22:02] wait you mean I've got to have a
[22:03] revelation too you mean I've got to it's
[22:05] important for the statute of a perfect
[22:07] man uh to be made manifest in my life
[22:10] you mean that uh I've got to love my
[22:12] brother as
[22:13] myself you mean I got to have virtue and
[22:16] knowledge Temperance meekness all these
[22:19] things instead of just going to church
[22:22] and putting on an outward show and uh
[22:25] and Israel and the church go around and
[22:26] said watch the 10 vergins that went out
[22:28] five all of them virgins five of them
[22:29] were foolish five had oil in their lamps
[22:32] what is the oil the Holy Spirit see
[22:34] that's right they were all virgins live
[22:37] good clean lives you say well brother I
[22:40] don't go to dances I don't go to shows
[22:42] that's just the moral things unless
[22:44] there has been a supernatural not
[22:46] because you shouted not because you
[22:48] spoke with tongues not because you
[22:49] jumped up and
[22:50] down not because you did this but
[22:54] something supernatural has happened in
[22:55] here that's changed you and put a seal
[22:58] put you a sealed love in God your anchor
[23:01] that's right why you don't believe I
[23:03] believe in shouting I believe in all
[23:05] these things but that isn't the answer
[23:08] it's something more than just doing like
[23:10] a Pharisees and being a a good
[23:18] person and the 10 virgins in the 144,000
[23:21] he said now watch these two churches oh
[23:24] if I could if there was some way I could
[23:25] just make the people see it just burns
[23:26] in my soul these churches are just as
[23:29] clean and holy as this one if they're
[23:30] all virgins they're all virgins just as
[23:32] clean the only difference was the oil
[23:35] and the lamp the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[23:37] Ghost if it's in there it produces the
[23:40] very same kind of fire it did on
[23:42] Pentecost but they don't have no fire no
[23:45] oil in their lamp they have church
[23:47] ritual church just as ritual as it can
[23:49] be fine ceremonies PR that would shake
[23:52] your conscience and songs like angels
[23:54] singing and there you'll put your finger
[23:56] on your their life you couldn't do it
[23:58] but still that's wrong it's not it's
[24:01] part of it but not all of it that's the
[24:03] kind that misses the Rapture
[24:09] see Paul telling
[24:12] Timothy his letter to Timothy now the
[24:14] end of the
[24:15] Commandment the end of the Commandment
[24:17] sum it all up right is Charity charity
[24:21] is love the Holy Ghost I have a pure
[24:24] heart and the definition of pure is
[24:27] there a nothing else but one thing and
[24:30] you can say what pure gold is nothing
[24:32] else but gold pure uh silver nothing
[24:35] else but silver pure heart is nothing
[24:38] there but what's supposed to be there
[24:41] and through your through your journey uh
[24:43] uh God purges You by his holy ghost fire
[24:46] and removes all of the impurities
[24:50] out of a good conscience and of faith
[24:53] uname not not faking it like the
[24:55] Pharisees just because they out outly
[24:58] lived right and uh outside they were
[25:01] painted white from which some have
[25:04] having swerved have turned aside un vain
[25:07] jangling Desiring to be teachers of the
[25:10] law understanding neither what they say
[25:13] nor where of that affirm and we talked
[25:16] before about how God you can't
[25:18] understand God's word unless you've got
[25:21] the Holy
[25:26] Ghost
[25:30] in 1 Peter 1: 12223 seeing you have
[25:33] purifi purified your souls and obeying
[25:36] the truth of the spirit unto unfeigned
[25:38] love of the Brethren see that you love
[25:41] one another with a pure heart fervently
[25:44] being born again not of corruptible seed
[25:46] but of Incorruptible by the word of God
[25:49] which liveth and abideth
[25:52] forever now it's interesting see that
[25:55] you love one another with a pure heart
[25:57] fervently and uh I was I was studying on
[26:00] uh John and how you know he used to say
[26:03] over and over and even in Scripture that
[26:06] uh and it's written by arenius that a
[26:07] lot of times uh when he was so old he
[26:10] couldn't hardly move they brought him
[26:11] into the church at Ephesus and he could
[26:13] just barely squeak out little children
[26:15] love one another and and over time a lot
[26:18] of them kind of got tired of hearing
[26:20] that over and over they thought that we
[26:21] already we are we we've heard it so many
[26:23] times should we know it why do you keep
[26:25] saying that and uh
[26:28] it's written down by the early church
[26:29] fathers he said well God told us to love
[26:32] one another and if you do that that's
[26:35] enough and
[26:37] um I got to reading uh this is I I guess
[26:41] kind of a table quote because there's
[26:43] nothing in the Bible about this but
[26:45] Clement and eus wrote this story about
[26:48] John and uh after he was on the aisle of
[26:52] patmas he went back to Ephesus and when
[26:54] he got back to Ephesus only a few months
[26:57] before Timothy had died in in January of
[27:01] that that previous year and they wanted
[27:03] him to John to take over the uh
[27:06] pastorship of that church so
[27:09] um he he uh one of his first things was
[27:12] he he started traveling around to make
[27:14] sure that all of the churches in that
[27:16] area had were set up with good pastors
[27:19] and that they were agreeing with the
[27:20] word and that everything was okay so he
[27:23] went to one of the churches and he found
[27:25] a young man that he he commended to the
[27:29] bishop over that area and he said you
[27:31] need to take special care of this man
[27:33] and help him through his journey and so
[27:36] the man said I I the brother said I
[27:39] absolutely I'll take good care of him I
[27:41] you commended me into my care and uh he
[27:45] baptized him and made sure he was on his
[27:47] on his road and John went back to
[27:49] Ephesus and later on that man got into
[27:52] the wrong crowd and uh started hanging
[27:55] around a bunch of Thieves ended up
[27:56] leading the bound of robbers and went up
[27:58] into the mountain John came back and
[28:00] said I put this brother in your care and
[28:02] you uh where is he and the man started
[28:05] crying and he said he's beyond all hope
[28:08] he's become he went into a f of robbers
[28:10] and there's no hope for him and John
[28:13] said uh just paraphrasing there's
[28:17] there's always hope unless he's
[28:18] blasphemed there's I you know I just
[28:21] reading this story I think that's how a
[28:23] lot of times maybe we act uh we think so
[28:27] because somebody's uh you know had
[28:30] troubles in their life that it's it's
[28:32] they're beyond all hope and uh so we we
[28:36] leave them and and neglect our duties
[28:39] like this this uh brother that John was
[28:42] dealing with but John he was getting
[28:45] close to 80 years old uh far too feeble
[28:49] to be making a journey up into the
[28:50] mountain but that's exactly what he did
[28:52] he went up into the mountains after this
[28:55] brother found him and uh he was was
[28:57] leading this Band of
[28:58] Thieves and the brother was so torn up
[29:02] in his heart and so uh his conscience
[29:06] was so guilt stricking that he he would
[29:08] he hid his hand behind his back his
[29:10] right hand because uh of all the things
[29:13] that he had done as a robber with that
[29:15] hand but John took his it's written eus
[29:17] and Clement wrote John took his hand and
[29:20] kissed it and said and L him back to the
[29:23] Lord that's uh purify your soul and
[29:27] obeying the truth see that you love one
[29:29] another with a pure heart fervently and
[29:33] uh you know I think how many times John
[29:36] said uh love just love one another
[29:39] little children and uh let's try not to
[29:43] grow tired of those words because we
[29:45] should um it's so important to that
[29:49] brotherly kindness is right up there
[29:51] under uh the top right up there it's
[29:54] because it's so hard it's what it's it's
[29:57] diff diffult and that's what's the it
[29:59] takes Christ to do that uh with us and
[30:02] in US is to really love one another and
[30:05] look past our faults and that's mercy
[30:08] and the pure in heart and uh I hadn't
[30:10] even got through half of my slid so
[30:13] right let's keep on next time let's stop
[30:15] right there
[30:20] thank
