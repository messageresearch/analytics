[5:11] [Music]
[5:28] amen it's good to see you all tonight
[5:32] let's turn over in the scripture to
[5:33] isaiah chapter 53
[5:36] and just get right into the word
[5:41] did you come expecting tonight
[5:46] gotta take for a title tonight
[5:50] the the flaw made it a masterpiece
[5:56] and we'll we'll just read in isaiah 53
[5:58] before we before we
[5:59] go right into the word let's just go to
[6:01] the author in prayer lord god we're so
[6:02] grateful to be able to gather together
[6:04] around your word and lord we pray
[6:06] lord that the word the songs that are
[6:07] sung and the words that are said lord
[6:09] will be
[6:10] for to edify your people and to help
[6:12] with god and lord we know that many
[6:13] people
[6:14] here tonight lord jesus in the middle of
[6:16] the week or maybe come in here needy and
[6:18] have different needs in their life lord
[6:20] jesus and i pray god that something will
[6:21] be said to
[6:23] loose the binds that satan has on their
[6:25] lives and help them lord
[6:26] god to give get liberty in you lord
[6:28] jesus
[6:29] to see to see their position and and the

[6:38] liberty to move among us tonight lord
[6:40] jesus and
[6:41] help me lord god to speak your word i
[6:43] pray in the name of the lord jesus
[6:44] christ
[6:46] and isaiah 53 verses 1 to 9 says
[6:50] and just kind of keep in your mind the
[6:52] flaw is what made it a masterpiece
[6:54] it says who hath believed i report and
[6:57] to whom is the arm of the lord revealed
[7:00] for he shall he shall grow up before him
[7:02] as a tender plant
[7:04] and as a root out of a dry ground he
[7:07] hath no form nor comeliness
[7:09] and when we shall see him there's no
[7:11] beauty that we should desire
[7:13] he's despised and rejected a man a man
[7:16] of sorrows and acquainted with grief and
[7:18] we hid as it were our faces from him he
[7:20] was despised
[7:22] and we esteemed him not surely he hath
[7:25] borne our griefs
[7:26] and carried our sorrows yet we did
[7:28] esteem him stricken
[7:30] smitten of god and afflicted but he was
[7:32] wounded for our transgressions
[7:41] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[7:44] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[7:46] and with his stripes we are healed
[7:49] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[7:51] have turned everyone to his own way
[7:54] and the lord hath laid on him the
[7:56] iniquity of us all
[7:58] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[8:00] yet he opened not his mouth
[8:02] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[8:05] and as a sheep before her shearers is
[8:07] dumb
[8:08] so he openeth not his mouth he was taken
[8:11] from prison and from judgment
[8:13] and who shall declare his generation for
[8:15] he was cut off
[8:16] out of the land of the living for the
[8:18] transgression of my people was he
[8:20] stricken
[8:21] and he made his grave with the wicked
[8:23] and with the rich and his death
[8:25] because he had done no violence neither
[8:28] was any deceit in his mouth
[8:29] he may be seated the lord had his
[8:31] blessing to the word
[8:32] amen now now
[8:36] as we read that scripture you know of
[8:37] course that's obviously
[8:39] speak an old testament prophecy of of
[8:42] jesus christ and how he came and
[8:44] and all of the things that he suffered
[8:46] for us and you know reading about that
[8:48] you can surely see that there's
[8:50] there's a lot of flaws there it looks
[8:52] like a lot of flaws he was rejected and
[8:54] he was stricken and he was smitten and
[8:56] he was despised and
[8:57] there was no beauty that we should just
[8:59] desire him and that was
[9:00] it seems like a lot of things wrong with
[9:02] him and really you know
[9:04] think think think about that the flaw
[9:06] the flaw was what made it a masterpiece
[9:08] and you know
[9:09] brother branham when he preached the
[9:10] sermon the masterpiece and
[9:12] the identified masterpiece of god when
[9:14] he preached those sermons
[9:15] he was really taking his context from
[9:17] from
[9:18] he went to this little place out in
[9:20] california glendale out
[9:22] there where they've got um they got this
[9:24] little fancy cemetery
[9:26] and uh where he he walked with a lot of
[9:28] ministers that's out there where they
[9:30] make
[9:30] they do a lot of hollywood stuff a lot
[9:32] of disney and all that but
[9:34] they had this fancy cemetery that he was
[9:35] strolling through and out there they had
[9:37] a
[9:37] a replica of michelangelo's sculptures
[9:40] sitting there in the
[9:41] in the in the uh the cemetery and he
[9:44] looked at that sculpture and he began to
[9:46] kind of think upon things that he would
[9:48] speak as he as he talked about the
[9:50] masterpiece
[9:51] and he looked at it and it's got you
[9:52] know it has a big a big foundation out
[9:54] of the bottom
[9:55] and and it's you know real big you can
[9:57] look at it and
[9:58] but central central to the whole thing
[10:00] was the flaw that it had on the knee and
[10:03] he said
[10:03] as you as you really studied this
[10:05] message out he said the flaw
[10:07] ends up being what made the masterpiece
[10:09] the flaw is the
[10:10] is the it is the main point you see and
[10:13] and brother brandon said he said as he
[10:14] was as he was looking at that
[10:16] masterpiece
[10:17] that michelangelo had carved of moses
[10:20] and he said he said i like art
[10:21] real well i like art and he said i
[10:24] believe god is in art
[10:25] and i believe god is in music and i
[10:27] believe god is in nature and
[10:29] god is everywhere in other words that
[10:31] you can look at the things that you see
[10:33] you can look at the flowers and the
[10:35] trees and
[10:36] and the way that the sun comes up and
[10:37] know that that god is actually
[10:39] representing
[10:40] a story there that you plant a seed and
[10:43] it goes down in the ground and it dies
[10:44] and it rots and then it comes
[10:46] up and and when the sun goes down in the
[10:48] evening it comes up the next morning
[10:50] because it's
[10:50] showing over and over again that the
[10:52] resurrection that when something goes
[10:54] down
[10:54] you can look everywhere and see god
[10:57] typed in his in his creation
[10:59] god is everywhere in his creation and
[11:01] anything he said anything that's
[11:02] contrary
[11:03] to the original is a perversion anything
[11:05] that's conscious of the devil
[11:07] god is in art to show something genuine
[11:10] and to show something real
[11:11] but the devil wants to get in there and
[11:12] pervert pervert things to show something
[11:14] to
[11:15] a perversion of the real thing isn't
[11:17] that true that that everybody is really
[11:20] looking for something
[11:21] genuine you think about you know the
[11:23] young kids they're they're looking for
[11:24] somebody genuine the old people are
[11:26] looking for somebody genuine
[11:28] somebody that will actually represent a
[11:30] genuine gospel
[11:32] you know i kind of been meditating on
[11:34] that line for for a while you know
[11:35] there's a lot of things
[11:37] a lot of fakeness in the world but there
[11:39] is a genuine there's fake preachers
[11:41] there's
[11:42] false preachers and false prophets
[11:44] there's there's false truths but there's
[11:46] a real
[11:47] genuine truth and real genuine preachers
[11:49] a real
[11:50] genuine gospel that god is actually in
[11:53] and representing himself in
[11:54] brother ryan said god is in dancing not
[11:57] the kind of dancing you do here
[11:59] but when the sons and daughters of god
[12:01] are in the spirit of god see that's
[12:02] dancing
[12:03] see brother brown said that god we
[12:05] believe in dancing in the spirit we
[12:07] believe in getting in the spirit of god
[12:09] and
[12:09] and worshiping god and and and do it
[12:12] like like for example when david came
[12:13] over the
[12:14] the and saw all of his enemy destroyed
[12:17] all the egyptians
[12:18] by or not not david but miriam they
[12:21] began to dance
[12:22] and then david when he was follow
[12:24] following the ark of the covenant as it
[12:25] was restored back to his place he began
[12:27] to dance and
[12:28] everybody laughed at you see god god
[12:30] brother and saying god is in there
[12:32] god is in an actual worship a real thing
[12:36] in something genuine he's in something
[12:38] genuine
[12:39] and he began to look at that that statue
[12:42] that moses had spent his whole life or
[12:44] michelangelo had spent his whole life
[12:46] a carving of moses and you know really
[12:48] if you go back in history and begin to
[12:51] kind of just think on the cost that it
[12:53] cost michelangelo
[12:54] michelangelo started carving that statue
[12:57] and
[12:58] the pope that he was working for didn't
[12:59] want to pay him and he
[13:01] had to run back and forth and argue with
[13:03] the pope trying to get his money and
[13:04] spent years of his life laboring and
[13:06] he had that vision in his mind that he
[13:08] was trying to achieve
[13:09] and brother adam said the cult but this
[13:11] and the masterpiece that michelangelo
[13:13] had made
[13:14] it cost him something to do that it cost
[13:16] him something to make that image it
[13:18] wasn't just something that he could just
[13:20] haphazardly go out and just kind of
[13:22] throw out some supplies and here comes
[13:24] an image but it actually cost him
[13:26] something to do
[13:27] he had to spend years of his life
[13:28] laboring to get to the point where he
[13:30] could do it he had to spend years of his
[13:32] life
[13:32] laboring and wiping and and polishing
[13:35] and carving and
[13:36] doing spending time and arguing over the
[13:38] money and all those things it took a
[13:40] long time
[13:41] to get to the place where he could look
[13:43] at that image and say there
[13:44] it's finished he said he was a great man
[13:47] and it cost a big part of his life
[13:49] because he was many
[13:51] many years and carving out i don't know
[13:53] how many years but if you look at the
[13:54] timeline it's just about most of his
[13:56] life
[13:57] most of his life was spent labored and
[13:59] told to get that image to a place where
[14:01] he can look at it and say
[14:02] now it's complete and brother adam said
[14:05] you might walk up and say to him
[14:07] that looking at michelangelo carving
[14:09] away and he say what
[14:10] what are you pecking on that for to the
[14:13] outsider who doesn't know what's in his
[14:15] heart it's
[14:16] nonsense now isn't that what the the
[14:18] preaching of the gospel looks like a lot
[14:20] of times you come into a church and see
[14:22] see what looks like ministers pecking
[14:24] away in foolishness and preaching
[14:26] something that they've got a vision of
[14:28] that they're trying to make manifest
[14:29] the foolishness of the gospel that
[14:31] brother branham preached his heart out
[14:33] for years and years to see the vision of
[14:35] the almighty god made manifest
[14:37] and people will look at that and say
[14:39] what are you picking on that rock for it
[14:40] looks like just a bunch of foolishness
[14:42] like a bunch of nonsense noah they're
[14:45] making his ark it looks like a bunch of
[14:46] foolishness there building the ark
[14:48] a place where he could go hide and rest
[14:50] in moses it looks like a bunch of
[14:52] foolishness leading the mid the children
[14:54] of israel out
[14:55] were just just by yourself nobody else
[14:57] to help looks like a bunch of
[14:59] foolishness
[15:00] but god was in it he said but to the man
[15:03] the sculpture himself he's got a vision
[15:05] in his mind
[15:06] what he's trying to make he's trying to
[15:08] make a vision a vision that when he
[15:10] looks at it he can see he can see
[15:12] himself
[15:13] reflected in it bill abraham said he's
[15:16] trying to reproduce what he has on his
[15:18] mind
[15:19] in the form of a monument that's the
[15:21] reason
[15:22] he's digging it out of the rocks you
[15:24] know that's why we come to church
[15:26] is to allow the gospel to dig at our
[15:28] lives and dig out the things that are
[15:30] supposed to be there
[15:31] dig and mold us into a place where god
[15:34] can get us to and
[15:35] dig and cut and and hurt and many times
[15:38] we don't want to come and
[15:40] we don't want to allow the gospel to
[15:41] mold us and cut and cut on us
[15:43] but that's the thing that's actually
[15:45] molding us to a place where god can look
[15:47] at us
[15:47] and look at our lives and see his
[15:49] reflection in us
[15:53] and in that in amos chapter 3 verse 7 it
[15:56] says surely the lord god will do nothing
[15:58] but he revealeth his secret unto the
[16:00] servants the prophets
[16:02] in other words he's revealing his vision
[16:04] to the prophets
[16:05] that's why we needed a prophet that's
[16:07] why they needed prophets in the old
[16:09] testament
[16:10] because god has a vision in his mind of
[16:12] what he's trying to achieve
[16:14] and he can he can get that downloaded
[16:16] through the prophet the conduit of what
[16:18] he wants done
[16:19] and then that prophet can begin to share
[16:21] it with others like you think of moses
[16:23] the conduit of god's vision that he was
[16:26] able to share it with all the
[16:27] all the other artificers and all the
[16:29] builders of the tabernacle and say
[16:31] i want you to build it like this i want
[16:33] you to construct it like this
[16:34] he was sharing the vision of god so that
[16:37] people could build it
[16:38] he said for in first corinthians chapter
[16:40] 1 verse 18 for the preaching of the
[16:42] cross is to them that perish foolishness
[16:45] but unto us which are saved it is the
[16:47] answer the power of god
[16:49] why is that what is the preaching of the
[16:51] cross the preaching of the cross
[16:53] is the preaching of the vision the
[16:54] preaching of the vision that was
[16:56] communicated down from a prophet
[16:58] whether that was the son of man jesus
[17:00] christ preaching for three and a half
[17:01] years
[17:02] or the prophet in the end day who caught
[17:03] the vision of god what he wanted to be
[17:05] built
[17:06] the preaching of the cross is build
[17:08] actually building that monument actually
[17:11] hewing out what god thought in his mind
[17:13] before the foundation of the world
[17:15] but brother brown said to do this to do
[17:18] this you have to start off right at the
[17:20] beginning
[17:21] and you have to follow the pattern
[17:23] you've got to stick with the pattern if
[17:25] you don't stick with the pattern then
[17:26] the building will not be built right
[17:28] it'll go off in some kind of
[17:30] denominational idea it'll get healed off
[17:32] in something that dies and falls apart
[17:34] it'll maybe build on sinking sand that
[17:37] they can't stand the test of time
[17:39] but if you follow the pattern it'll end
[17:41] up looking just like the vision
[17:44] that god saw in the back part of his
[17:46] mind you've got to follow the pattern he
[17:48] said see
[17:49] you can't get a little piece to start
[17:51] off we'll make it this way
[17:53] no i believe he said no he's got to have
[17:55] an exact pattern
[17:57] we're not building a pattern based on
[17:58] man's ideas or what we think it ought to
[18:01] look like or
[18:01] the idea that like denominations they
[18:03] run off with their own little ideas and
[18:05] go off into a little area and say
[18:07] now we've got it and they cabbage down
[18:09] and put a period on it
[18:10] on the end of it what we're building
[18:12] according to the pattern
[18:14] that god saw before the foundation of
[18:16] the world now moses when he went up into
[18:18] the mountain god gave him a pattern to
[18:20] build the tabernacle
[18:21] and he came back down because he was a
[18:24] prophet and the bible says
[18:25] the bible says in exodus it says look
[18:27] that thou make them after that pattern
[18:30] which would show thee in the mouth so he
[18:32] went up into the mountain and he got a
[18:33] pattern
[18:34] and he came down and began to share that
[18:36] pattern with others so that the
[18:37] construction should begin
[18:39] in hebrews chapter eight verse 5 it says
[18:41] who serve unto the example and shadow
[18:43] of heavenly things as moses was
[18:46] admonished of god
[18:47] when he was about to make the tabernacle
[18:49] foresee saith he
[18:50] that thou make all things according to
[18:53] the pattern
[18:54] showed to thee and the mount in other
[18:55] words moses went up into the mount and
[18:57] would showed a heavenly pattern that he
[18:59] could then reproduce
[19:00] in earth he was reproducing in earth
[19:02] what he saw a heavenly pattern for
[19:05] and this pattern is what was what was
[19:07] communicated to down through the
[19:09] prophets the pattern
[19:10] the pattern shows that there's a
[19:12] progression you start off maybe simply
[19:14] and you move on up like building
[19:16] building a monument you start off with a
[19:18] foundation and you move on up
[19:19] through the from the foundation to the
[19:21] body to the head and you wind up with a
[19:23] head and there you can stand back and
[19:25] you can see
[19:26] now i see i see what was in the vision
[19:28] of the
[19:29] of the sculptor's mind but you've gotta
[19:32] you've got to build according to the
[19:34] pattern
[19:35] and he said the pattern has got to come
[19:37] by inspiration he said
[19:38] now a genuine sculptor is inspired like
[19:41] a genuine poet
[19:42] or any genuine singer musician whatever
[19:45] might be
[19:46] so it's got to be inspired now now you
[19:48] know when you read the bible and it's
[19:50] not inspired
[19:51] you can read it and it'll actually end
[19:53] up maybe killing yourself you'll think
[19:55] well
[19:55] well i've got to save myself by doing
[19:57] things or i've got to save myself
[19:59] you can get all skewed up and it'll
[20:01] actually begin killing but if you read
[20:03] by inspiration the actual essence of
[20:06] what it's trying to communicate will
[20:07] pop off the page and you'll get what
[20:09] it's really trying to say
[20:11] many times we'll read the bible the
[20:12] wrong way and it's like
[20:14] like like beating ourselves with a
[20:17] hammer but if you read it the right way
[20:19] then you'll actually see the grace
[20:21] that's laying there for you
[20:23] he said michelangelo must have had the
[20:25] inspiration of what moses really looked
[20:28] like
[20:28] and he called it in his mind what moses
[20:31] must have been
[20:32] now if michelangelo the sculptor could
[20:34] catch the inspiration of what moses
[20:37] really looked like and then make
[20:38] make the image to look like what his
[20:41] inspiration
[20:41] showed then what what if we can catch
[20:44] the inspiration of what god wants us to
[20:46] be in that day
[20:47] and then match up match up with what god
[20:50] thought of us before the foundation of
[20:51] the world
[20:52] now brother burnham said he said
[20:54] brethren you never you see everything
[20:56] that we do has got to be by inspiration
[20:58] he said you never preached a sermon in
[21:00] your life the holy spirit preached
[21:02] through you a sermon
[21:03] that's right see we don't preach the
[21:04] holy spirit does the preaching
[21:06] oh me we might write out something and
[21:08] read it but that isn't preaching
[21:10] preaching is when inspiration comes and
[21:12] it's preached by
[21:13] inspiration and the holy spirit gives
[21:15] the unction do you remember when brother
[21:17] brandon preached what is the holy ghost
[21:19] given for that's one of the things that
[21:20] he laid out
[21:21] that is to give an unction an unction to
[21:23] preach an unction to speak
[21:25] an action to live it's the holy ghost
[21:27] that's powering us that's moving us
[21:29] that's actually inspiring us to match
[21:32] the gospel
[21:33] he said now we can read something and it
[21:35] just doesn't matter but when the holy
[21:36] spirit
[21:37] gets a hold of it and takes it out to
[21:39] the people then something takes a hold
[21:41] see
[21:41] and that's this holy spirit he said i
[21:43] may not be able to put it together right
[21:46] i only speak by inspiration and
[21:48] inspiration is just when you find it
[21:50] here
[21:51] you grab it and hand it out just when
[21:53] you find it inspiration coming and he's
[21:55] grabbing it and handing it out
[21:56] grabbing it and handing it out as
[21:58] inspiration comes and where is the
[22:00] inspiration coming from it's coming from
[22:02] the fountain of everlasting life
[22:04] it's coming from something down on the
[22:06] inside that's pulsing out
[22:07] something that you can give out listen
[22:09] when you give it out it'll give somebody
[22:11] freedom and liberty to lose somebody
[22:13] from their bonds
[22:14] because it's not coming from some
[22:16] man-made idea it's not coming from a
[22:18] broken
[22:19] cistern but it's coming from something
[22:21] genuine
[22:25] he said you reach and get it and hand it
[22:26] out it may be an old-fashioned sacrifice
[22:29] right
[22:29] way but it'll do you good if you'll keep
[22:32] it is that
[22:33] it'll stick to your ribs and hold you he
[22:35] said it save me and it'll save you
[22:37] now job 32 verse 8 says but there is a
[22:40] spirit in man and the inspiration of
[22:42] he's talking about job's talking about
[22:44] how that you think that a man that
[22:46] living a long time would have a lot of
[22:48] wisdom
[22:48] you think that somebody living for a
[22:50] long time would have would be able to
[22:51] know what they're talking about but he
[22:53] said but
[22:54] there's a spirit in man and the
[22:56] inspiration of the almighty giveth him
[22:58] understanding many times people that
[22:59] live a long time may not
[23:01] just by their intellectual knowledge may
[23:03] lack things
[23:04] that the spirit can teach you if you get
[23:06] in the spirit and stay in the spirit
[23:08] and get that inspiration that the spirit
[23:09] will bring that will bring true
[23:11] understanding
[23:12] in john 14 26 but the comforter which is
[23:15] the holy ghost whom the father will send
[23:17] in my name
[23:18] says he shall teach you all things and
[23:20] bring all things to your remembrance
[23:22] whatsoever i have said unto you in other
[23:24] words inspiration
[23:26] inspiration of the spirit and that's
[23:27] what we need is revelation of the word
[23:30] the revelation of the word is the most
[23:32] important thing in our lives
[23:34] the revelation is more important than
[23:35] anything else because it's the true
[23:38] inspiration of what is laying there in
[23:40] the letter of the page
[23:42] and brother brown said just think that
[23:43] vision on his mind for so many years to
[23:46] make it look just exactly to what it was
[23:48] he caught the vision first and how he
[23:50] had to work to that vision
[23:52] cutting off and making down and when he
[23:54] got to where he perfected it till it
[23:56] really got perfect
[23:58] he stood and looked at it when he
[24:00] finished up that morning
[24:01] with a hammer in his hand now you think
[24:03] of michael michelangelo
[24:05] stepping back from his masterpiece that
[24:07] he had worked and told that for all
[24:09] those years
[24:10] under inspiration with a vision of what
[24:12] he wanted to see
[24:13] and after all those years he stepped
[24:15] back
[24:16] with a hammer in his hand and he had a
[24:18] hammer
[24:19] and he said he was so inspired when he
[24:22] looked at it because the vision of his
[24:24] mind was standing before him
[24:26] in reality and then when it was
[24:28] completed he stood back with a hammer or
[24:30] sculptor's hammer in his
[24:32] hand and he looked at that monument and
[24:34] the inspiration of the vision that he
[24:35] had seen of how to do it
[24:37] inspired him so much till he the
[24:39] inspiration
[24:40] struck him till he got beside himself
[24:43] and struck it across the knee
[24:45] and said speak the inspiration that
[24:48] there what he had labored at for all
[24:50] those years
[24:51] was now in front of him and with
[24:53] inspiration he took that hammer
[24:55] and struck it and said speak and he said
[24:57] now now there's a flaw
[25:00] now there's a flaw on that great image
[25:02] on the knee
[25:03] on the right knee just above the knee
[25:05] about six inches is a place he said i
[25:07] put my hand on it
[25:08] about that deep and there's a broken
[25:11] place on the knee of moses
[25:13] there's a flaw and he said it made a
[25:16] flaw in it to me
[25:17] the flaw was met what made it the
[25:20] masterpiece
[25:21] the flaw was the thing that made it the
[25:23] masterpiece
[25:24] now look now look the way brother
[25:26] branham explains this as you run it
[25:28] through this sermon he kind of takes the
[25:30] flaw
[25:30] in different directions but now now
[25:32] let's take it in this direction now
[25:34] i want you to maybe examine your life as
[25:36] you look to your own life and you look
[25:38] back to your past
[25:40] and the things that you've done in your
[25:41] past that you listen i was talking to
[25:43] one of the young people one time and
[25:44] they were
[25:45] i wish that the things i had done in my
[25:47] past
[25:48] that i i'd never done and i wish that i
[25:50] could leave those things behind
[25:52] but you see god's put god's allowed
[25:54] things to go on in your
[25:56] life so so that so that to bring you to
[25:58] a place look
[25:59] he's allow he's used actually using your
[26:01] flaws
[26:02] so that you don't rely on yourself you
[26:05] begin to turn your trust and turn your
[26:07] faith
[26:07] to the one that can take your flaws and
[26:10] make a masterpiece out of you
[26:11] [Applause]
[26:13] now listen paul and in second
[26:15] corinthians
[26:16] you know paul had a flaw he had
[26:18] something that he labored with all his
[26:20] life and and he asked god over and over
[26:23] again he's will you please take this
[26:25] thing from me
[26:26] so that i can serve you but somehow god
[26:29] allow that flaw to remain
[26:31] and paul said so that i would not become
[26:33] exalted within my revelation in other
[26:35] words
[26:36] because god wanted me to put all my
[26:38] trust
[26:39] all of my efforts in him and to rely
[26:41] completely on him
[26:42] to lean on him for everything that i
[26:44] have need of
[26:46] now paul said for this thing i besought
[26:49] the lord thrice that it might depart
[26:51] from me
[26:51] and he said unto me by grace is
[26:53] sufficient for thee
[26:55] for my for my strength is made perfect
[26:57] in weakness think about that
[26:58] his strength my strength is made perfect
[27:01] in weakness
[27:02] that god actually wants you to be weak
[27:04] he wants you not to rely on your own
[27:06] abilities not to rely on your own self
[27:09] not to rely on anything that you can do
[27:11] but put all of your trust in him
[27:13] he's the one that's going to accomplish
[27:15] it he said most gladly therefore will i
[27:18] rather glory in my infirmities that the
[27:20] power of christ
[27:21] may rest upon me in other words make la
[27:24] i glory that
[27:25] that i'm not trusting in my own
[27:27] abilities it's not by my own self now
[27:29] now thinking about this now brother
[27:31] branham had a flaw his own self he had
[27:34] something that every seven years he
[27:36] would deal with a stomach ailment
[27:37] to the point where the doctor would look
[27:39] at his stomach and say your stomach the
[27:41] lining of your stomach
[27:42] is all hardened up and brother i'm gonna
[27:44] go to him and
[27:45] god deliver me of this and every seven
[27:47] years he would come back and he had it
[27:49] he had this ailment that he had to deal
[27:51] with over and over
[27:52] and then on the wings of a snow white
[27:54] dove one month before he passed away
[27:58] a month before he passed away in other
[28:00] words his whole life god let him deal
[28:02] with his flaw in his body and he said
[28:05] somehow i know
[28:06] i'll tell you before it happens the
[28:08] doctor is a good dog
[28:09] no doubt i think he's a fine man but i
[28:12] know i'm going to be over it
[28:14] it's done it's finished and i'm going to
[28:16] be well and we know the story i'm not
[28:18] going to lay it all out all the all the
[28:19] visions the dreams that he saw the the
[28:21] the squirrel thing that he crushed under
[28:24] his foot and all
[28:25] of those things but listen he he had a
[28:27] flaw that god was actually
[28:30] to put to put him to put that man into a
[28:32] place where he would not rely on himself
[28:35] you see you see if you can look back at
[28:37] your life and
[28:38] just let all the flaws all the problems
[28:40] in your life and say
[28:41] yes i've got flaws i've got problems but
[28:43] yet god is molding me into what he wants
[28:46] me to be
[28:47] amen why do we why do we have fault why
[28:51] are flaws permitted because
[28:52] listen one of the great secrets
[28:55] mysteries of the message is
[28:56] actually that the way up is down we
[28:59] think so many times and if i could just
[29:01] press myself into
[29:02] a great position in the church if i
[29:04] could just press myself into being an
[29:06] important person
[29:07] if i could press myself into being an
[29:09] important preacher in the message
[29:11] then then i'd really be something but
[29:13] the way up is actually down the way up
[29:15] is to go
[29:16] down to the dust down so far brother
[29:19] brown said that if you rise above the
[29:20] dust you've risen above god
[29:22] if we can get ourselves to a place that
[29:24] we're so far
[29:25] so far down in humility that god can
[29:28] actually do
[29:28] something with us something will take
[29:30] place listen in matthew
[29:32] 23 all these parables that jesus laid
[29:34] out for us about
[29:35] exalting yourself over and over he said
[29:38] call no man your father upon the earth
[29:40] father for one is your father which is
[29:43] in heaven neither be
[29:44] called masters for one is your master
[29:46] even christ
[29:47] but he that is greatest among you shall
[29:49] be your servant
[29:50] and whosoever shall exalt himself shall
[29:53] be abased
[29:54] and he that shall humble himself shall
[29:56] be exalted
[29:57] so if you put yourself up then sooner or
[29:59] later god's going to have to get a hold
[30:00] of you
[30:01] and knock you down a pig the way up is
[30:04] down and the way down is
[30:05] up in luke chapter 18 he says i fast
[30:08] twice in the week get telling this
[30:10] parable of
[30:10] of the of the public and praying and he
[30:13] said i
[30:13] press twice in the week i give tithes of
[30:15] all that i possess
[30:17] and the republicans standing afar off
[30:19] two two standing there praying
[30:20] and the republicans said the publican
[30:22] will not lift up so much as his eyes
[30:24] under heaven
[30:25] but smote upon his breath saying god be
[30:28] merciful to me a sinner
[30:30] god be merciful to me in other words
[30:32] this man was not standing there pointing
[30:34] fingers at other people
[30:35] and judging one another and saying i'm
[30:37] better than the other i'm better than
[30:38] the other church we're better than the
[30:39] other church we're better than the other
[30:41] people
[30:41] somehow within my own self something
[30:43] that i'm doing without my own self makes
[30:46] me better
[30:46] but he had humbled himself and he said i
[30:48] tell you this man went down to his house
[30:51] justified rather than the other for
[30:53] everyone that exalteth himself shall be
[30:56] abased
[30:56] and he that humbleth himself shall be
[30:58] exalted and luke chapter 14 10 to 11 but
[31:01] when they are bidden
[31:02] when somebody calls you to the feast go
[31:05] and sit down in the lowest room and then
[31:07] maybe they'll tell you to come up higher
[31:09] for whosoever exalteth himself shall be
[31:11] abased
[31:12] and he that humbleth himself shall be
[31:14] exalted
[31:15] why because we're not depending on our
[31:17] own abilities
[31:19] listen this is a great truth lay it in
[31:21] here in this in this message
[31:22] that it's not by your own works it's not
[31:25] by your own power
[31:26] that you're going to overcome
[31:29] but it's by his spirit
[31:33] now now brother brown set his toils
[31:34] laboring to see the vision become
[31:36] manifested he said his toils and wearies
[31:39] and long nights and housed away from the
[31:41] world for days and
[31:42] maybe eat a sandwich and rub on it and
[31:45] get back and
[31:46] no that's just not the way it was now
[31:48] it's got to come down to this
[31:50] and rubbing it and rubbing it some more
[31:52] done the old testament in the old
[31:53] testament talks about the prophets
[31:55] rising up early and working all day and
[31:58] just laboring constantly the prophets
[32:01] giving their lives for the people
[32:03] so that they could catch the vision that
[32:05] was actually god
[32:06] in them doing something god laboring to
[32:08] see his vision molded and made
[32:10] he said then when he saw it just perfect
[32:12] then he saw in reality
[32:14] the negative of the what was in his mind
[32:16] had become real it became positive
[32:18] therefore it sprung into him and it was
[32:21] so real that he must cry out speak
[32:23] to me it was a reflection it was a
[32:26] compliment to his work that his own work
[32:28] so inspired him that he would become it
[32:31] beside himself
[32:32] now think think of the almighty god st
[32:35] we're talking about michelangelo but
[32:37] think about god becoming so beside
[32:39] himself
[32:40] to see the image coming to the place
[32:42] coming
[32:43] the tabernacle coming to a place where
[32:45] he can look at it and say
[32:46] that looks exactly the way that i had it
[32:49] in my mind
[32:50] to smite it and to say speak
[32:54] that he would become beside himself to
[32:55] smite it and to say speak
[33:00] now brother brahm said i really like
[33:02] this part of this message
[33:03] he said now let us turn the page of
[33:06] michelangelo
[33:07] it's like reading out of a book of
[33:09] michelangelo
[33:10] he's got a book that he's reading from
[33:12] let's turn the page of michelangelo
[33:14] and close the book close that book
[33:18] and let's open another book and read of
[33:21] the great sculptor the almighty
[33:23] now this other book you see i i believe
[33:27] maybe we could put our own lives in that
[33:29] place up now now we'll close
[33:31] close the book of of our faults and our
[33:34] failures and close the book
[33:35] of all the places that we messed up and
[33:38] let's open this other book the other
[33:40] what book is it i believe it's that book
[33:41] that brother branham was referring to in
[33:43] the first in the first seal in paragraph
[33:45] 33
[33:46] where he began to talk about a book that
[33:47] was open a book that you can look into
[33:50] and see yourself
[33:50] identified with it and then in paragraph
[33:53] 33
[33:54] he compares that book with the bible who
[33:56] for years it was sealed up and nobody
[33:58] could read in a rev chapter rev the
[34:00] book of revelation and nobody could
[34:01] understand what the seven churches are
[34:03] but then you be
[34:04] it now it's opened up so that you can
[34:06] read the end to
[34:07] now we got a book that we can oh it's
[34:09] laying there opened up before us and we
[34:11] can look into it
[34:12] and read he said read of the great
[34:14] sculpt of the almighty
[34:16] and he said who before there was a world
[34:18] and before the foundations was laid
[34:20] he had in his mind what he wanted how
[34:23] now what
[34:23] what did he want he wanted you he wanted
[34:26] you to be part of this image
[34:28] he wanted you to be part of it and he
[34:29] wanted to make man in his own image
[34:31] he wanted to make something in reality
[34:33] of what was a vision to him what was in
[34:35] his thinking
[34:36] i said now to michelangelo that was an
[34:38] attribute of his thought
[34:39] to michelangelo that was an attribute of
[34:41] his thought but to god that was
[34:43] an attribute of his thought that he
[34:44] wanted to express and he said he wasn't
[34:47] like a man now a sculptor that has to
[34:49] take something that's been created
[34:50] to hew an image he was the sculptor of
[34:53] eternal things
[34:54] he was a sculptor that could create and
[34:56] bring into existence
[34:58] that which he has in his mind to do or
[35:00] otherwise he can make material
[35:02] what his attributes desired so in other
[35:05] words
[35:05] he's not sculpting with a chisel and
[35:08] stone but he's actually bringing forth
[35:10] by his word he's actually speaking
[35:12] something into existence
[35:14] and you see if that's how he did it then
[35:16] and he's hebrews 13
[35:18] 8 then that's how he's still operating
[35:20] today he's still working by the same
[35:22] pattern
[35:22] he's still moving the same way he worked
[35:25] according to this pattern by bringing up
[35:27] something from something simple and big
[35:29] from a foundation and working it up
[35:31] until there was standing in front of
[35:33] them the completed object
[35:35] and brother branham said and as he began
[35:36] to work upon creeping
[35:38] did you know that we actually believe in
[35:40] evolution not the evolution that's just
[35:42] haphazard where just
[35:44] some things happen that maybe god turned
[35:46] his back on it
[35:47] and and just allowed just things to just
[35:49] happen but we we believe in an evolution
[35:51] where god was actively involved
[35:53] progressing things from this point to
[35:55] this point to this point
[35:57] and brother brown said he began to work
[35:59] upon creeping things like upon the
[36:00] little animals upon the earth
[36:02] and then he began to bring it from that
[36:04] into something else higher
[36:05] then finally he brought it into the
[36:07] larger animal such as the lion tiger
[36:09] bear
[36:10] then he brought it into the life of
[36:12] maybe of monkeys and apes and so forth
[36:15] god working in a pattern he's working in
[36:18] a pattern that he's still working in
[36:19] today working from a foundation up
[36:22] up higher and higher moving higher until
[36:24] finally he said
[36:25] finally there came forth upon the earth
[36:27] a perfection
[36:28] and that was a man and then he could see
[36:31] in that man that it looked like him
[36:34] so now when he looked upon him he was a
[36:36] reflection of what his creator was
[36:38] god had now been able to achieve the
[36:40] thing that he wanted
[36:42] a man in his own image what's this
[36:45] masterpiece that we're talking about
[36:46] what's
[36:47] what's what are we talking about a man a
[36:49] man that matches what god thought of in
[36:51] his own mind a man
[36:52] that he could put himself in a man in
[36:55] god's own image and he said there was
[36:57] something about him yet that didn't look
[36:58] just right
[37:00] because that he was by himself so he
[37:02] struck
[37:03] a little blow over on his left side and
[37:06] there's that flaw again the flaw
[37:08] is what makes the masterpiece the flaw i
[37:10] wonder just maybe to dramatize a little
[37:12] bit i wonder ever since ever
[37:14] ever after that that god put adam to
[37:16] sleep if maybe he could look down and
[37:18] and maybe touch a place in his side and
[37:20] remember
[37:21] you know god left that flaw in jesus's
[37:24] side
[37:25] he could always thomas was able to put
[37:27] his hand in his side and
[37:29] touch that place where the spear went in
[37:31] and he was able to feel the flaw in his
[37:33] hands and
[37:33] touch that place where he had been
[37:35] nailed to the cross and maybe maybe you
[37:37] think about adam looking down and
[37:38] remembering
[37:39] my my my my help meat actually
[37:43] came out of me and god she's actually
[37:45] part of me she's actually
[37:47] bone of my bone and flesh of my spirit
[37:49] flesh we're actually one
[37:51] and he said from there he took the peace
[37:53] that struck off of it and made him a
[37:55] helpmate
[37:56] a wife then he wasn't by himself he
[37:59] struck a piece off of him
[38:00] struck a piece off of adam and there
[38:03] they too
[38:04] were one and there you got the true
[38:06] masterpiece
[38:08] a man and his wife there together in
[38:10] harmony a masterpiece
[38:12] family walking in the garden of eden
[38:14] together in oneness
[38:16] that you see what god is trying to bring
[38:17] us through us to a place
[38:19] where we're not at odds with our maker
[38:22] at odds with the vision that god saw
[38:24] before the foundation of the world but
[38:26] he's bringing us to a place where we can
[38:27] walk in harmony
[38:29] where two are not two but one two were
[38:31] brought together in oneness and harmony
[38:34] now see he said now first he had a
[38:36] masterpiece of himself but now he's seen
[38:38] that the masterpiece was lonesome
[38:40] like he was so he divided the
[38:43] masterpiece by striking it in the side
[38:45] and brought forth a help meet
[38:47] and now to make the 2-1 to make the 2-1
[38:51] he put them like any great sculptor and
[38:54] a place
[38:55] that's beautiful he put them right there
[38:57] in the garden of eden now if you think
[39:00] about the garden of eden
[39:02] think about think about all the places
[39:04] in the bible that talk about going up
[39:06] into aham and moses went up into a
[39:07] mountain
[39:08] and and the amount of transfiguration
[39:11] and brother branham going up into a
[39:12] mountain
[39:13] and think about eden eden was obviously
[39:15] a high place because out of eden flowed
[39:17] a river
[39:18] that split off into four rivers that
[39:21] watered all of eden it watered at the
[39:22] garden of eden
[39:23] so it's got to be up in a high place so
[39:25] eating eden was
[39:26] the garden of eden was situated up and
[39:29] brother brown begins to explain now
[39:31] that when you've got something that you
[39:32] want to show when you've got when you've
[39:34] got a light you don't put a bushel over
[39:36] it
[39:37] you actually put it out there on display
[39:39] and so that's actually what god was
[39:41] doing with his masterpiece he took that
[39:43] masterpiece
[39:44] that he had made by his word and
[39:46] actually put it on display
[39:48] in a high place in the garden of eden so
[39:50] that all could benefit from that do you
[39:52] realize that's what he's doing with you
[39:54] with his little masterpieces he's
[39:56] actually putting you on display
[39:57] in your workplace and in your church and
[39:59] everywhere you go
[40:00] he's got you in this play because you
[40:02] you're the light of the world
[40:04] you're you're shining out the gospel so
[40:06] that others can see
[40:08] in matthew chapter 5 it says a city that
[40:10] is set on a hill cannot be hid neither
[40:12] do men light a candle
[40:13] and put it under a bushel but on a
[40:15] candlestick and it giveth light unto all
[40:17] that are in the house
[40:18] let your light show shine before men
[40:20] that they may see your good works and
[40:22] glorify your father
[40:24] which is in heaven he said he placed his
[40:26] masterpiece
[40:27] the two being one in the garden of eden
[40:29] the masterpiece
[40:30] is the stroke that marred san angelo's
[40:33] moses masterpiece and the monument
[40:35] and it was the stroke that cut the side
[40:38] of his masterpiece
[40:39] that brought out the bride and now we
[40:41] see them as a masterpiece
[40:42] family in the garden of eden how
[40:45] beautiful it was and it so pleased him
[40:47] until he took rest then
[40:48] he said i'll rest now now now you see
[40:52] there's a picture there the picture
[40:53] there is that the masterpiece is there
[40:55] in the garden of eden
[40:56] and they're walled up around by the word
[40:59] and they
[41:00] they're so fortified by the word because
[41:02] every day in the cool of the evening and
[41:04] on and on
[41:05] god is actually coming and
[41:06] fellowshipping with him and sharing with
[41:08] him his thoughts and sharing with him
[41:10] his vision
[41:11] and they're catching the revelation and
[41:12] they're able to adam's able to speak to
[41:14] the mountains and speak to the lakes and
[41:16] move things and move things out of the
[41:18] way
[41:18] why because they're so fortified behind
[41:20] the word they've got the revelation of
[41:23] the hour they know what god wants done
[41:25] with the word and they're standing there
[41:26] fortified
[41:27] do you realize if you've got the word
[41:29] you've got the answer to everything that
[41:31] the devil can throw against you
[41:33] everything that the devil can come again
[41:35] come at you with
[41:36] unless there's a question that's why
[41:39] we've got to get all the questions
[41:41] answered we got to nail the questions
[41:43] down because
[41:43] if there's a question about anything the
[41:45] devil can squeeze in and slide in and
[41:48] say well
[41:49] uh are you sure are you sure you're
[41:52] gonna die
[41:53] are you sure you're gonna die but if
[41:55] you're fortified by the word you
[41:56] you won't be like eve but you can say
[41:59] god told me
[42:00] that if i eat of something that i'm not
[42:02] supposed to eat of that i pray if i
[42:03] partake of a lie that i'm gonna die
[42:06] god told me that if you stay fortified
[42:08] by the word behind the
[42:10] staying fortified behind the word means
[42:13] when the devil comes
[42:14] and tells you something that's contrary
[42:16] to the word you're so fortified that you
[42:18] just throw the word back at him
[42:20] that's how you defeat the enemy by
[42:22] staying fortified behind the word the
[42:24] word is like a wall
[42:25] it's like a shield that you hold up and
[42:27] a sword and a helmet and a breastplate
[42:29] and the and the and all the all the
[42:31] armor that paul talked about
[42:33] because you can actually use it to ward
[42:35] off the devil
[42:37] amen brother ram said now notice this
[42:40] one thing i want you to bear in mind
[42:42] that god gave this man
[42:44] a protection he gave him he fortified
[42:46] him
[42:47] inside of his word because he told them
[42:49] what they could do what they could not
[42:51] do
[42:52] and that's the same basis we're set on
[42:54] today what we can do what we cannot do
[42:57] that's a stumbling quote in there the
[42:59] same basis
[43:00] he said no matter no matter how good we
[43:03] are
[43:04] how much we go to church or do this we
[43:07] got to be born again
[43:09] you got to be born again what what do i
[43:11] need to do you got to be born again
[43:13] you say it doesn't matter what i do you
[43:15] got to be born again
[43:17] you've got to be born again and see then
[43:19] that'll begin to settle everything
[43:21] because then then you've got the
[43:22] believer on the inside that can actually
[43:24] know the correct interpretation of the
[43:26] word and then you can believe it the
[43:28] right way
[43:28] and become fortified so that when the
[43:30] devil starts throwing his darts at you
[43:32] you've got an answer for him if you've
[43:35] got an answer for the devil then
[43:36] then when he comes and says i don't
[43:38] believe that the holy ghost is for you i
[43:39] don't believe that the blessing is for
[43:41] you
[43:41] i don't believe that you can get healed
[43:42] then you've got something to throw back
[43:44] in his face
[43:45] you've got something to give back at him
[43:48] and tell him to go away
[43:49] because nothing else is going to scare
[43:51] the devil but the word will
[43:52] the word will resist the devil every
[43:54] time the word is how you defeat the
[43:56] devil
[43:57] you know jesus told us how to defeat the
[43:59] devil by demonstrating with his own life
[44:01] he said it is written and is written and
[44:04] in his weakest condition after he came
[44:06] out of the wilderness
[44:07] fasting for what 50 days or hour low
[44:10] 40 days 40 days of fasting and he came
[44:13] out in his weakest condition
[44:15] he demonstrated when he could have
[44:17] called a legion of angels
[44:18] but he demonstrated how you and your
[44:20] weakest conditions can defeat the devil
[44:22] every time
[44:23] by staying fortified behind the word
[44:26] stay
[44:27] fortified behind the word and brother
[44:29] brown said and then the enemy come in by
[44:30] deceit
[44:31] and crawled through the walls got
[44:33] through the walls of god's word
[44:34] because the door was open to him why was
[44:37] the door open to him because
[44:39] there was a like a little question a
[44:40] little doubt a little gap in eve's mind
[44:42] that well
[44:43] maybe maybe he's got a good point do you
[44:46] see the purpose of coming to church
[44:48] and reading the message and reading your
[44:50] bible and so that you become so
[44:51] fortified behind the word
[44:53] that no matter what what false prophet
[44:55] or false teacher or anybody comes and
[44:57] throws something in your lap
[44:59] you stay fortified behind the word and
[45:01] said i know
[45:02] i know that the promises of god are for
[45:04] me i know that the benefits are for me
[45:06] i know that there's a promise laying in
[45:08] there in the scripture for me
[45:10] listen when the devil comes and tells
[45:12] you that you're going to get sick or
[45:13] that there's no
[45:14] that you're just going to have to stay
[45:16] that way you could throw back in his
[45:17] face that he was wounded for my
[45:19] transgressions
[45:20] you could throw back in his face that my
[45:22] strength is made perfect in weakness
[45:24] you can throw back in his face that the
[45:26] promises to as many as are called
[45:28] you could throw back in his face that
[45:29] hebrews 13 8 he's the same
[45:32] yesterday today and forever why because
[45:34] you're fortified behind the word
[45:36] and you know what god wants done with it
[45:42] now brother ram said and the conflict
[45:44] between god and satan he said
[45:47] after you become a christian then you
[45:49] are fortified by the word and any
[45:51] promise in the word
[45:53] he said didn't know i was going to say
[45:54] that you are when you become a christian
[45:58] you're placed behind the word of god see
[46:00] now there's your fortress your fortress
[46:02] safety your fortress not not a feeling
[46:05] or a sensation but staying fortified
[46:07] behind the word
[46:09] every promise in that is yours only
[46:11] thing you have to do is just reach and
[46:13] get it and go right on with it
[46:15] how you know what's going to work i
[46:16] don't know i was going to work explain
[46:18] to me i don't know
[46:19] only thing i know that god gave his
[46:21] children the best attack that they could
[46:23] have
[46:24] and the best thing to attack with
[46:25] because he knows the working of the
[46:27] enemy
[46:28] the working of the enemy is to slip
[46:29] through into your reason and get you to
[46:31] start reasoning about something that's
[46:32] going on get you to start thinking about
[46:34] thinking too heavy about something
[46:36] it's thinking about your own the all
[46:38] your own way of thinking instead of
[46:40] taking it back to the scripture
[46:42] and reason the reason according to the
[46:44] bible there ain't nothing wrong with
[46:45] reasoning as long as it's
[46:47] reasoning according to the bible brother
[46:49] brahman said in putting on the whole
[46:50] armor of god he said we're in a
[46:52] wrestling match
[46:53] we're wrestling not with fine
[46:55] intellectual psychology
[46:56] but we're wrestling with the power and
[46:58] the promise of god
[46:59] which can break any hold on any devil
[47:02] at any time now how is how is god going
[47:06] to break the whole of a devil
[47:08] he's going to do it by his word because
[47:10] his word will fortify
[47:12] you now now let's examine this for a
[47:14] little bit he said
[47:15] jesus our lord proved it when he was
[47:17] immanuel god himself made flesh among us
[47:20] and when he met satan to show that satan
[47:22] could be defeated by the word
[47:24] every time satan would come to him he
[47:26] said it's written
[47:27] it's written oh how i would like to take
[47:30] him here on some note i got right here
[47:32] on the things that he said how many
[47:34] times that he broke
[47:36] satan's power with us written how many
[47:38] times he broke satan's power with this
[47:40] written
[47:41] now if he broke satan's power with this
[47:43] written you can break his power with us
[47:45] written too
[47:46] it's oh my showing that that fortified
[47:49] person behind the word of god
[47:50] can scream out it's written turn him
[47:53] loose
[47:54] turn loose satan for it is written if
[47:56] you're staying behind the word if you
[47:58] abide in me and my words and you ask
[48:00] what you will that's right
[48:02] can't be wrong that's got to be right
[48:04] now now you see you see that's what the
[48:05] gospel was said the word
[48:07] actually looses you from the power of
[48:09] the devil
[48:10] now how does that do it how does it do
[48:12] it let's let's give an example
[48:14] i was listening to an evangelist testify
[48:16] about how he was in
[48:18] a service and he began to preach
[48:20] combating that idea that's so prevalent
[48:22] in the message
[48:23] that that if you are a bastard that you
[48:25] cannot be saved
[48:26] and he began to preach and he began to
[48:28] lay out all of these scriptures
[48:30] and you see what it was was that it was
[48:32] actually he began to fortify the young
[48:34] people in the congregation
[48:35] with the word so that they began to
[48:37] realize that the blood of jesus christ
[48:39] was more powerful than anything that the
[48:41] devil could do it's more powerful than
[48:43] anything that their mama and daddy could
[48:45] do
[48:45] it's more powerful than anything of this
[48:47] earth the blood of jesus christ
[48:48] is powerful enough to blot off every
[48:51] spot every wrinkle
[48:52] and he began to by the preaching of the
[48:54] gospel began to loose
[48:56] loose them from the bind that satan that
[48:57] got them in do you realize
[48:59] my wife and i were talking about this
[49:01] the other day she was sharing something
[49:02] that she heard in a message
[49:04] that the devil the devil actually the
[49:05] way he works is he binds you first
[49:08] and then he starts taking see he binds
[49:10] you he makes you think he'll get you in
[49:12] a place where you are you're drinking
[49:14] alcohol and
[49:14] then he starts taking your life from you
[49:16] he binds you to a place to real
[49:18] make you think that because of something
[49:20] that your mama and daddy did
[49:21] that there ain't no grace for you
[49:23] anymore and then he begins to take
[49:25] he starts taking your joy and taking
[49:27] your taking your hope
[49:28] and it begins to take everything but the
[49:30] power of the gospel
[49:31] is to preach it the right way so that
[49:33] all the stuff that the devil is binding
[49:35] begins to
[49:36] it actually begins to loose you from
[49:38] whatever the devil's bound you with
[49:40] whatever whether it's depression whether
[49:42] it's anxiety whether it's
[49:44] fear it's actually the word of god has
[49:46] given you hope
[49:47] giving you faith unleashing something
[49:49] within your life
[49:50] that god wants you to see
[49:51] [Applause]
[49:53] that's why the message that's what the
[49:55] gospel says in matthew 18
[49:56] 18 verily i say unto you whatsoever ye
[50:00] shall bind on earth shall be bound in
[50:02] heaven
[50:02] and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth
[50:04] shall be loosed in heaven
[50:06] listen the gospel is actually looser
[50:08] it's the looser of them that are bound
[50:10] and it actually binds up the devil so he
[50:12] can't do any work anymore
[50:13] satan wants to bind the church and god
[50:16] wants to loose him so that they can
[50:17] actually
[50:18] worship him and praise him and servant
[50:20] and live for him the way that he wants
[50:22] them to
[50:23] listen people will say you the devil
[50:25] will say you can't be saved or
[50:27] god hates you or god is punishing you or
[50:29] you'll never take a rapture or you'll
[50:31] never be delivered
[50:32] or i i was listening to another brother
[50:34] he began to share how
[50:35] uh uh a a i'll say a false prophet i'm
[50:38] gonna say it like this
[50:39] began to tell him one day in a message
[50:41] he began to say i say unto thee i say
[50:44] unto thee and laid on him
[50:45] all these accusations have you got all
[50:47] these personality complexes
[50:49] and he went home and began to think oh
[50:51] god do i do i really
[50:53] have all this pride or whatever it was
[50:55] that that man was laying on top of
[50:57] you see what the devil wants to do is
[50:59] bind you and he began to he began to
[51:01] worry and he was bound up for like two
[51:03] weeks
[51:04] you see how just just a little flippant
[51:06] word so somebody can bind them up
[51:09] but then he said one day one day he came
[51:11] across the path of
[51:12] of a gospel minister that said all that
[51:15] man that everything he says is
[51:17] everything he said don't come to pass
[51:19] and it loosed him because he was telling
[51:21] him the truth
[51:22] the genuine truth will actually loose
[51:24] you from something that the devil wants
[51:26] to bind you with
[51:28] amen now brother roman said in the
[51:31] second seal
[51:33] the natural first bride of the human
[51:35] race before her husband come to her
[51:37] she fell from grace by listening to
[51:39] satan's lie after god had for
[51:41] fortified behind his word and she had
[51:44] stayed behind the word she had never
[51:45] failed
[51:46] now that's in the natural notice the
[51:48] natural woman and what was the curse
[51:50] the actual curse of coming out from
[51:52] behind god's word was
[51:53] death and so god started over
[51:57] he started over with he began his work
[51:59] all over again
[52:00] i know y'all are looking at the clock
[52:01] thinking this sermon is going to take a
[52:03] while now hang on
[52:07] start it over i thought i thought you
[52:10] were closing brother
[52:16] and brother braham said see the love of
[52:17] god after man had fallen and
[52:20] deliberately opened the door to the
[52:21] enemy
[52:22] after man had fallen and opened up the
[52:24] door so that they listened to
[52:26] the devil's lie and come in and marred
[52:28] him and set death in him and
[52:29] still god was not willing to be defeated
[52:32] still god was not willing to be defeated
[52:35] he came down and started all over again
[52:38] he was going to make that man again he
[52:40] said god went to work immediately to
[52:43] build it up again
[52:44] he wasn't willing that it should perish
[52:46] lay there like that all the time because
[52:48] he is god
[52:49] and he will not be defeated so he went
[52:51] to work immediately
[52:52] and began to build again unto his own
[52:54] image a man now listen to this
[52:56] first thing he starts off he starts off
[52:59] in the garden he said do
[53:00] don't do this do this but now he starts
[53:03] off with an
[53:03] unconditional covenant i'm going to do
[53:06] it now now you see
[53:07] you see grace really entering the
[53:09] picture here now he said now we find
[53:11] that the andalusian world come along and
[53:13] destroy the whole
[53:14] thing because the covenants that was
[53:16] made was made conditionally
[53:18] if you will not do this or if you will
[53:20] do that
[53:21] god the great sculptor seen that man
[53:24] could not keep a covenant
[53:27] could not keep a covenant so in other
[53:29] words you
[53:30] by the law you can't keep the law by
[53:32] your own work it's not by your own power
[53:35] that you run this race
[53:36] you can't do it you need something
[53:38] within you to do the keeping for you
[53:40] he said he just can't do it there is
[53:42] just no
[53:44] way at all and he said in abraham he
[53:46] started him on an unconditional covenant
[53:48] an unconditional covenant that god's
[53:50] going to make a way he's going to he
[53:52] just said i'm going to do it
[53:53] he said not not if you will i have i've
[53:56] already done
[53:57] it i've blessed you and your seed and so
[53:59] forth after you
[54:00] it was an unconditional covenant he
[54:03] started with abraham
[54:05] his workmanship again and now with his
[54:07] unconditional covenant
[54:09] then when we find out he based on
[54:11] abraham
[54:12] abraham and give him the covenant
[54:14] unconditional covenant
[54:15] unconditional with the promise now
[54:18] that's a lot that's
[54:19] really hard for a lot of us to grasp
[54:22] right before this sermon right before
[54:24] brother brown preached the masterpiece
[54:26] he had one of the only one one of the
[54:28] very few i don't know if there's any
[54:29] other personal private interviews that
[54:31] he had
[54:31] that he recorded right before this
[54:33] sermon and he recorded this
[54:35] this private interview interview with a
[54:37] little sister bruce
[54:38] and see sister bruce was wondering i
[54:41] believe
[54:42] i put it like this wondering about this
[54:44] how how
[54:45] is it by the things that i do or is god
[54:48] actually doing a work in me and it's not
[54:50] based upon my own power
[54:52] my own locomotion the on she began to
[54:55] look at her own
[54:55] faults now listen to listen to the way
[54:58] she words this
[54:58] we're talking about grace now he said
[55:00] but brother brandon i have so many
[55:02] things
[55:02] this is sister bruce talking about i
[55:04] have so many things
[55:05] that i know that's wrong now now how
[55:08] many of us sitting here today can say
[55:09] that i've got so many things that i know
[55:11] that's wrong
[55:12] so many flaws we'll say it like that so
[55:15] many flaws that we look at
[55:16] so many things that we can remember and
[55:18] and look at now even
[55:20] in our day-to-day life so many things
[55:21] that we did this morning
[55:23] he said i said but look sister you don't
[55:25] look at yourself
[55:27] it's just what your desire is and what
[55:29] you try to do
[55:31] see because when you get the new birth
[55:32] he's changing your heart
[55:34] down on the inside now where you once
[55:36] wanted to do wrong
[55:38] or you didn't care now on the inside it
[55:41] grieves you
[55:42] when when you make a mistake it grieves
[55:44] you when you hurt somebody's feelings
[55:46] it grieves you when you when you when
[55:47] you say the wrong thing or
[55:49] somebody or you or you don't you you
[55:51] misinterpret the word and find out later
[55:52] that
[55:53] that things need to be corrected he said
[55:55] listen look sister you don't look at
[55:57] yourself
[55:58] it's just what your desire is and what
[56:00] you try to do and
[56:02] if you really love the lord you try to
[56:04] serve him with all your heart
[56:06] and then all your mistakes is hid
[56:09] in the blood of the lord jesus now think
[56:12] about think how powerful that is
[56:14] all your mistakes all your flaws
[56:17] all your problems all your past are hid
[56:21] under the blood of the lord jesus now
[56:24] now you can't really
[56:25] read the personal interview and get the
[56:27] full effect of it
[56:28] you got to go listen to it and i'll tell
[56:30] you why it's not that long
[56:32] but if you'll go listen to it as she's
[56:34] saying i i feel i look
[56:36] so much at all the things that i'm doing
[56:38] you can hear the congregation out there
[56:40] before brother branham comes out to
[56:42] preach the masterpiece
[56:43] you can hear the congregation begin to
[56:45] sing louder and louder
[56:47] there is power in the blood there's
[56:49] power in the blood and they begin to
[56:51] sing that
[56:52] why why things don't happen just by
[56:55] circumstance
[56:56] she's wondering if it's by her own works
[56:58] and her own power
[56:59] and this congregation out that outside
[57:02] of singing there's power in the blood
[57:04] the blood is what covers you over and
[57:06] covers over all your faults and
[57:08] covers over all your failures i'm so
[57:10] glad tonight that we've got a covering
[57:12] that god's not looking at our faults and
[57:14] our failures he's not looking at my past
[57:16] but it's been covered over his
[57:20] sister bruce said i've made so many i
[57:21] make so many mistakes and i failed so
[57:23] many times
[57:24] he said that's why christ had to die so
[57:27] that you with your mistakes
[57:28] wouldn't be lauded to you wouldn't be
[57:31] lauded to you
[57:32] they're not allotted to you if they're
[57:33] under the blood they're covered over we
[57:36] got a covering this afternoon
[57:38] he said he took your mistakes your
[57:40] desire and your heart is to serve him
[57:42] sister bruce says yes
[57:43] all right that's what he died for so you
[57:45] could serve him see
[57:47] not your mistakes are not looked not
[57:50] allotted to you
[57:51] he is your propitiation he is your sin
[57:55] offering
[57:55] your sins are not known you're not a
[57:58] sinner before god
[57:59] christ took your sins and became you
[58:02] because your desire is to serve you
[58:04] listen that ought to lose to everybody
[58:06] from the bonds that the devil's got
[58:08] on you to know that he's not looking at
[58:10] your sin
[58:11] you know in the old testament they would
[58:13] take they would take that burn
[58:14] that sacrifice and they would burn it up
[58:16] and get take the ashes
[58:18] and pour it out on the fire throughout
[58:19] the camp and the smoke would go up over
[58:21] the congregation
[58:22] who assembled that god was not looking
[58:25] at their faults and failures
[58:26] but he was looking through the shed
[58:28] blood he was looking through the
[58:30] sacrifice
[58:31] and that's how he's looking at us
[58:32] tonight he's not he's not looking at
[58:34] your problems
[58:35] but he's looking through what he did for
[58:37] you to pay the price and
[58:38] cover over your problems
[58:41] you know so many times when we stumble
[58:44] and fall we start we start looking to
[58:45] one another for justification
[58:47] we start looking to one another to see
[58:49] did somebody else do the same thing i
[58:51] did
[58:51] did somebody else make the same slip
[58:53] with the same stumble that i did
[58:55] but you know if we'd stop doing that and
[58:57] look up and look up to what god is
[58:59] covered with
[59:00] that we've got a covering rahab at a
[59:02] covering with
[59:03] her and her prostitution and all of her
[59:05] troubles sitting there on the wall
[59:07] she hung that scarlet thread out there
[59:09] and it was a covering
[59:10] that when all the wall fell that little
[59:12] part of the wall that she was on
[59:14] did not and ruth ruth with her horrible
[59:16] lineage that she could look back
[59:18] on and all that stuff how the the how
[59:20] the tribe of moab started
[59:22] with all that incestuous relationship
[59:24] with with lot and all of his daughters
[59:26] and all that stuff
[59:27] she had a lot of baggage that she could
[59:29] look back on a lot of scars maybe that
[59:31] she could look back on
[59:32] but there her uh naomi told her to go
[59:35] out into the threshing floor and lay
[59:37] down at boaz's feet
[59:38] and he covered her over he gave her a
[59:40] covering and said you've been
[59:42] covered over by the holy ghost and god's
[59:44] not looking at you anymore
[59:46] cause you're covered over
[59:49] you see so many times we get to where
[59:51] we're looking at one another
[59:52] like brother branham did when he was
[59:54] sitting there in that restaurant and he
[59:55] began to look over and look over at that
[59:58] lady sitting there with all of her
[59:59] makeup
[1:00:00] on and look at her horrible what looked
[1:00:02] like a horrible condition
[1:00:04] and he began to judge her within his
[1:00:06] heart and he began to say
[1:00:08] he said he said i looked and i thought
[1:00:09] oh my
[1:00:11] ah he said i stood there said god you
[1:00:13] and your holiness
[1:00:14] how could you ever stand to look at that
[1:00:16] when it kills me to look at it
[1:00:19] my to think that a prophet of god was
[1:00:22] and nobody could point at him and say
[1:00:23] well you never did this or you never
[1:00:25] drunk alcohol you never
[1:00:27] nobody could you ever did anything
[1:00:29] nobody his life
[1:00:30] his life was correct and he was standing
[1:00:32] there judging standing there looking at
[1:00:34] that woman with scorn
[1:00:35] and the angel came by and said step over
[1:00:37] behind the door
[1:00:38] i want to teach you a lesson something
[1:00:41] said to me get behind the door
[1:00:43] and he said i went back behind the door
[1:00:45] and stood there he's talking about a
[1:00:46] covering now we got a covering
[1:00:48] we got a covering like ruth had a
[1:00:50] covering we got a covering like all
[1:00:52] these people in the bible had a covering
[1:00:53] on top
[1:00:54] our covering is the holy ghost a
[1:00:56] covering is the blood that christ shed
[1:00:57] for us
[1:00:58] on the cross and he said i i went back
[1:01:01] behind the door and stood there i waited
[1:01:02] a little bit of vision come i saw a
[1:01:04] world turning
[1:01:05] and around the world was a mist that
[1:01:08] looked like blood springing around and i
[1:01:10] looked in there
[1:01:10] and there i was doing things wrong there
[1:01:12] i was doing things wrong he called his
[1:01:14] remembrance
[1:01:15] my if we could just call our own if we
[1:01:17] could just realize that we're
[1:01:19] we're guilty of things every day he said
[1:01:22] every time i do something wrong my
[1:01:24] sins would start before god and god
[1:01:26] would slay me for it
[1:01:27] but jesus was standing there like a
[1:01:29] bumper he caught it i see the tears run
[1:01:32] down his cheeks
[1:01:33] and i'd do something else bad his blood
[1:01:35] would hold it keep it from touching me
[1:01:37] from killing
[1:01:38] me god would kill me the day you eat
[1:01:41] thereof the day you die
[1:01:43] the penalty of letting the devil slip in
[1:01:46] behind the fortification of god's word
[1:01:48] is death
[1:01:49] the day you eat the day you die but yet
[1:01:51] god's got a covering for us
[1:01:53] and he said i looked at it and then the
[1:01:55] vision i went up to him i said lord i'm
[1:01:57] ashamed of myself
[1:01:59] they're laying my book laying there
[1:02:00] they're laying my book
[1:02:02] with all kinds of evil wrote on it i
[1:02:05] said will you plea will you forgive me
[1:02:06] lord that i put you in that condition
[1:02:08] he reached back tapped his hand like
[1:02:10] this and rode across the book with his
[1:02:12] own blood
[1:02:12] pardoned throwed it over behind him then
[1:02:15] he did he opened up
[1:02:16] a new book he opened up a new book
[1:02:21] you see what will we do without grace
[1:02:23] we've
[1:02:24] all fallen short of the of the glory of
[1:02:26] god we've all there's none
[1:02:27] good no not one every one of us needs
[1:02:30] grace every one of us
[1:02:31] needs the grace of god what would we do
[1:02:33] without grace and we have no room to
[1:02:35] point fingers at others now listen i'm
[1:02:37] getting into something here
[1:02:39] hang on with me just a few minutes he
[1:02:40] said in john in john chapter 8
[1:02:42] is the parable that jesus tells of the
[1:02:44] woman coming up the woman that had been
[1:02:46] caught
[1:02:47] actually in the act of adultery and the
[1:02:50] people drug her up before him
[1:02:51] screaming for her death or calling out
[1:02:54] for her death
[1:02:55] and so jesus so when they continued
[1:02:57] asking me he lifted up himself and said
[1:02:59] unto
[1:03:00] unto them he that is without sin among
[1:03:02] you let him first cast a stone at her
[1:03:04] let him first cast the stone who's
[1:03:06] without sin you see because we've all
[1:03:08] fallen short
[1:03:10] amen and they which heard it being
[1:03:12] convicted by their own conscience went
[1:03:14] out one by one
[1:03:15] beginning at the eldest even unto the
[1:03:17] last you see
[1:03:18] you see god has given us a grace in this
[1:03:20] hour by the opening of the word
[1:03:22] to actually overcome the accuser they
[1:03:25] came with their accusations came with
[1:03:27] all of their false charges and things
[1:03:29] came screaming for death screaming
[1:03:33] i'm going to share something with you
[1:03:34] now i remember probably 20 years ago
[1:03:36] somebody came to me with some
[1:03:37] accusations of somebody
[1:03:39] that they could not prove and i began to
[1:03:42] discuss with them
[1:03:43] what do you want to happen to this
[1:03:44] person they were they were very upset
[1:03:46] with this person
[1:03:47] ready to ready to ready to do you know
[1:03:50] so i said i said what what do you want
[1:03:52] to happen to this person
[1:03:54] and they said i want their life to be
[1:03:55] ruined i want everything that they stand
[1:03:57] for to be destroyed
[1:03:59] and i'm maybe summarizing you see you
[1:04:01] see when that when an accuser is
[1:04:03] is a is seeking death it just shows that
[1:04:05] something's wrong
[1:04:06] when an accuser is sinking seeking
[1:04:08] something like that it shows it
[1:04:10] and that's what the devil the devil is
[1:04:12] seeking our death the devil is trying to
[1:04:14] get us to a place
[1:04:15] where you see in revelation chapter 12
[1:04:19] it said for the accuser of our brethren
[1:04:21] is cast down which accused him before
[1:04:23] our god day and night
[1:04:24] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:04:26] the lamb and by the word of their
[1:04:27] testimony
[1:04:28] and they loved not their lives unto the
[1:04:30] death how did they overcome
[1:04:32] how do they overcome the accuser by the
[1:04:34] blood of the lamb by the covering that
[1:04:36] god gave to them by the word by the word
[1:04:38] of their testimony
[1:04:39] by speaking back what had been given to
[1:04:41] them by saying the promises that had
[1:04:43] been shared with them
[1:04:47] see my defense my defense is the word
[1:04:49] we're all guilty
[1:04:50] but he is our righteousness he is our
[1:04:53] covering he is our all now
[1:04:55] when the devil says you're guilty when
[1:04:57] the devil says you've done something
[1:04:58] he's our covering that we can look to
[1:05:00] that we can we that
[1:05:01] our representation that he's he's our
[1:05:03] lawyer and our judge and our advocate
[1:05:06] that we can look to to to realize that
[1:05:08] we're not guilty
[1:05:10] he said every time every time he would
[1:05:11] start a masterpiece satan would get it
[1:05:13] because the word but when he started
[1:05:14] with abraham he said i've already done
[1:05:17] it
[1:05:17] now this is unconditionally not that if
[1:05:20] you will
[1:05:21] i will but i've already done it i've
[1:05:23] already done it
[1:05:25] and so he began to work on the
[1:05:26] foundation now now see the foundation
[1:05:29] i'm i'm gonna wind up in just a few
[1:05:31] minutes don't get word here
[1:05:34] the foundation the foundation is a
[1:05:36] foundation with flaws
[1:05:38] he said now watch every masterpiece is
[1:05:40] put on a foundation a sculpture
[1:05:42] angelo's monument of moses is on a three
[1:05:45] or four foot piece of marble
[1:05:46] it's got a foundation so god and
[1:05:48] preparing this masterpiece
[1:05:50] he put he put it on the foundation of
[1:05:52] the patriarchs now
[1:05:53] you see this whole message is about
[1:05:55] grace it's about people with flaws that
[1:05:57] god has taken their flaws and making
[1:05:59] masterpieces out of them
[1:06:01] so this foundation is a foundation full
[1:06:03] of flaws
[1:06:04] so he's taking it but the devil likes to
[1:06:08] point at our flaws and say and accuse us
[1:06:10] of our flaws but
[1:06:11] but we've got a covering for those flaws
[1:06:13] see now abraham was the foundation of
[1:06:15] faith brother brahma said
[1:06:16] he said let's say it had four
[1:06:18] foundations but think about all of
[1:06:19] abraham's flaws
[1:06:21] he had a past full of idolatry he lied
[1:06:24] about who his wife was twice
[1:06:26] he went down into egypt due to phantom
[1:06:28] famine out of the promised land he he
[1:06:30] did all that he
[1:06:31] had a lot of counts against him but yet
[1:06:33] he god placed him as the foundation of
[1:06:35] this masterpiece
[1:06:37] the foundation of love was isaac the
[1:06:39] foundation of grace was jacob
[1:06:41] god's grace to jacob anyone knows that
[1:06:43] now isaac lied and said rebecca was his
[1:06:45] sister
[1:06:46] so isaac's got that flaw there he's got
[1:06:48] a flaw
[1:06:49] but yet god takes him and molds him into
[1:06:51] a masterpiece
[1:06:53] the foundation of grace was jacob jacob
[1:06:55] the little mama's boy
[1:06:57] jacob the the waste until his brother is
[1:06:59] all exhausted and famished to ask for
[1:07:02] the birthright it looks like everything
[1:07:03] he's doing is
[1:07:04] contrary to any anything that anybody
[1:07:06] would would teach you in
[1:07:07] just like a school of how to behave and
[1:07:09] how to act right
[1:07:10] deceives his blind and bedridden father
[1:07:12] and he and he's got all these
[1:07:14] flaws keeped up on him but and joseph
[1:07:16] was perfection
[1:07:18] there's where he could set the monument
[1:07:20] upon not the first foundation
[1:07:21] the second foundation the third
[1:07:23] foundation but on the fourth foundation
[1:07:26] and it looks like you could say joseph
[1:07:27] was perfect but joseph's got a flaw
[1:07:30] joseph's got a scratch he said to joseph
[1:07:33] there's nothing against him just one
[1:07:34] little scratch for the foundation must
[1:07:36] also be a masterpiece
[1:07:38] when he told his father the prophet say
[1:07:40] to pharaoh that your people are cattle
[1:07:42] raisers and not shepherds
[1:07:44] because a shepherd is an abomination to
[1:07:46] the egyptian
[1:07:47] so it scratched it see that's why it
[1:07:50] still
[1:07:50] makes it the masterpiece it's the
[1:07:52] masterpiece because
[1:07:53] the flaw is what makes it the
[1:07:55] masterpiece because he's making
[1:07:57] something that
[1:07:59] not by your own power or on by your own
[1:08:01] works but he's taking
[1:08:03] a flawed individual and making a
[1:08:05] masterpiece out of them
[1:08:09] and it keeps on coming down he said he
[1:08:11] was the fulfilling of all the prophets
[1:08:13] he was so perfect until god seeing this
[1:08:15] he smote him and his cried out speak
[1:08:18] as michelangelo did speak the perfect
[1:08:20] image the god man
[1:08:22] god and morphy had changed from
[1:08:24] supernatural to the vision
[1:08:26] and the vision was projected into the
[1:08:28] image and the image was smitten so that
[1:08:30] the supernatural
[1:08:31] could taste the feeling of death god's
[1:08:34] perfect masterpiece
[1:08:36] and now in order for this to speak he is
[1:08:38] the word
[1:08:39] and for the word to speak he must come
[1:08:40] into the image and then for the image to
[1:08:42] speak it's got to be smitten
[1:08:45] he comes into the image and then in
[1:08:46] order to speak the perfect redeemer he's
[1:08:48] got to be smitten
[1:08:50] so that out from his side can come forth
[1:08:52] a piece smitten to get a bride and
[1:08:54] brother ram talks about how he went to
[1:08:55] the diamond mine and he asked the man
[1:08:57] why why does that why does these
[1:08:58] uncut diamond why do they not sparkle
[1:09:00] and the man told him well they got to be
[1:09:02] cut
[1:09:03] it's got to be cut and sliced up to be
[1:09:05] to sparkle
[1:09:06] and and and see brother brown explain
[1:09:08] that you take a diamond and you slice
[1:09:10] that little cut off of it
[1:09:11] and then you could take that that little
[1:09:13] piece that looks like something that you
[1:09:15] would just discard
[1:09:16] and you make a make a vitrola needle out
[1:09:19] of it you could take that and
[1:09:20] make a record put on the needle of a
[1:09:23] record player and then
[1:09:24] it can catch the voice it can catch by
[1:09:27] inspiration
[1:09:28] he said the needle is what brings it out
[1:09:31] brings out the true
[1:09:32] interpretation of the word see the flaw
[1:09:35] is actually what makes the masterpiece
[1:09:37] and it makes the master the the the
[1:09:40] masterpiece submitting
[1:09:41] it yields a another piece that matches
[1:09:44] the original
[1:09:45] matching pieces he fulfilled the old
[1:09:48] testament now it's the new testament
[1:09:50] another another piece to boot fulfilled
[1:09:52] see the new and old as husband and wife
[1:09:54] and it taken the new the old to
[1:09:57] foreshadow the new christ come the
[1:09:58] masterpiece
[1:09:59] to fulfill that now his bride will
[1:10:01] fulfill everything
[1:10:02] that's in the new testament now i'm
[1:10:05] gonna

[1:10:07] because brother the musicians can go
[1:10:09] ahead

[1:10:12] building up his masterpiece again
[1:10:14] in this day brother he said the sculptor
[1:10:16] now had the word reflected in the
[1:10:18] masterpiece again
[1:10:19] called his son god emmanuel just think
[1:10:22] that a person so
[1:10:23] yielded until god identified himself in
[1:10:26] there in that body
[1:10:27] and he became him him and god became one
