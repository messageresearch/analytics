[0:00] level
[0:02] right we all come from the same place
[0:05] born in sand shape of their iniquity now
[0:08] listen
[0:09] it's not that uh
[0:12] you know
[0:13] you can get dogmatic about certain
[0:16] things about
[0:17] life and all these things but
[0:21] like me and Jim was talking about
[0:22] yesterday we we all live in permissive
[0:24] wealth
[0:26] all of us live in the permissive will of
[0:29] God God never intended for us number one
[0:32] to come by saying
[0:34] right number two he never intended us to
[0:37] get old
[0:38] all right he never intended for us to
[0:41] sin in fact Genesis 1 26 man never did
[0:44] Sin right so we got to look to that
[0:46] image
[0:48] um and we were talking about you know
[0:49] some people are real dogmatic about this
[0:52] flesh right here is what's going to be
[0:53] redeemed well that's correct
[0:56] but my flesh at 20 years old and your
[0:59] flesh at 20 years old had earrings in it
[1:02] some of you had tattoos
[1:04] do you understand what I'm saying so
[1:06] let's not be so dogmatic we got to go
[1:08] back to that exact 20 year old body that
[1:10] we lived in when we were 20 years old
[1:11] because if you do you're in trouble some
[1:13] of you
[1:14] yeah we had long hair guys girls Jim's
[1:18] hair was the shortest mine when she was
[1:19] 20 years old so we're not going back to
[1:21] that we're going
[1:23] we're going to that Genesis 1 26 man
[1:25] because when God picture you before the
[1:27] foundation of the world at 20 years old
[1:28] like you probably said he didn't take a
[1:30] picture you at 20 years old right here
[1:33] if he would you'd have short hair you'd
[1:35] have had tattoos you would have had
[1:37] earrings you'd have had it you know they
[1:38] got piercings everywhere now but was
[1:41] that what God saw there's no way you
[1:43] could see that right
[1:44] so brother Brown said you're being you
[1:47] were being built into the image of the
[1:48] one that's inside of you
[1:50] right that's right that picture brother
[1:51] that picture that God took of you that
[1:53] brother Brown told us about that God saw
[1:57] come straight from his mind
[2:00] which was perfect
[2:02] right so brother Brown you could say
[2:04] brother Brown said well not exactly the
[2:06] same gases well you know what his labor
[2:07] lahanta said one time and I don't know
[2:09] how I'm gonna get in with this but
[2:10] there's more of you in the septic tank
[2:12] than there is standing up right here
[2:14] My Flesh when I take a shower
[2:17] is proven every seven years your body
[2:19] goes through a change
[2:21] your skin cells come off with you and go
[2:23] into the toilet I mean into the sewer
[2:26] and out into the water out into the
[2:28] ground now is all that going to collect
[2:30] back and let's don't be so dogmatic
[2:34] this don't be so dogmatic about that
[2:36] that boy this right here is you know if
[2:38] I was just flesh and blood will not
[2:39] enter into the kingdom of animals right
[2:42] 16 elements of the Earth
[2:45] absolutely I'm gonna look the way I look
[2:47] but remember what brother Brown said
[2:49] brother Adam said God took this one and
[2:51] bred them to this one this one to this
[2:53] one right this one to this one this one
[2:56] to this one to get you here why because
[2:58] he saw you before the foundation of the
[3:00] world he knew what your genetic makeup
[3:02] was going to be so he he had the picture
[3:05] so we put this one together to make Bob
[3:07] black look the way Bob black is and he
[3:09] comes right down here he is on the Earth
[3:12] to make his choice
[3:15] but let's don't be so dogmatic when
[3:16] somebody you know says well well it's
[3:19] not exactly this body or somebody says
[3:21] well it's got to be this Exotic Body
[3:22] well if you're standing here for the
[3:24] change this body is going to be changed
[3:26] now I promise you one thing
[3:27] sister's not gonna have holes in your
[3:29] ears that's right so what is it is a new
[3:31] body that's right but it's this body
[3:33] made new not throwing this body away and
[3:36] picking up a new one there's no way
[3:38] because this is redeemed right here this
[3:40] is the Redemption
[3:42] Genesis 126 man don't need to be
[3:44] redeemed
[3:45] he never needed Redemption
[3:47] he always was eternal right he never was
[3:50] born on a certain day he never did Sin
[3:53] that's right
[3:54] but we did in this body this flesh this
[3:57] is what needs Redemption yes now he's
[3:59] going to redeem me back to the 20 year
[4:00] old I was no he's going to redeem me
[4:02] back to the 20 year old he saw that's
[4:04] right that I was
[4:06] that's right did God take a picture
[4:10] what we will be when we are changed
[4:14] really the picture listen the picture is
[4:16] that that's what I've been trying to
[4:18] preach to you about that Genesis one man
[4:19] if you ever see that you're going to see
[4:21] full Redemption because that Genesis 1
[4:23] 26 man never changed
[4:27] right it come genetically from the mind
[4:31] of God and the DNA of God is exactly
[4:34] that Genesis 1 26 man what God had him
[4:37] in his mind it will not ever change how
[4:39] can God change his mind so when he said
[4:41] I will create man in my image
[4:45] he created that 20 year old
[4:48] well that's good you want to share
[4:52] them while it's fresh well I just saw
[4:54] what when brother Dale says God is a you
[4:56] know he's a man I mean he's a person
[4:58] when you say that I thought you said and
[5:01] remember God's attribution male and
[5:03] female
[5:05] you said he was made in that when
[5:06] everybody was made in the image of God I
[5:08] thought well the image is like a picture
[5:10] I mean that's right so that meant God
[5:12] was right
[5:14] right
[5:15] God's always been a human God's always
[5:18] been young God's not some great-headed
[5:21] like the world thinks it got some
[5:22] gray-headed I don't want a god like that
[5:25] if he's going to change me back I want
[5:26] him to be young yeah
[5:29] yeah you see that's why Mary Magdalene
[5:30] didn't know Jesus
[5:35] had never seen Jesus at 20 years old
[5:37] right
[5:39] that's why Mary looked and said what
[5:40] have you done with my lord well she
[5:42] thought he was just a little old Garden
[5:43] a little 20 year old guy why do you
[5:46] think the disciples had a problem
[5:47] believing who he was he didn't say look
[5:50] at my face he said look at my hands and
[5:53] my feet that was the to show them
[5:56] Hey listen
[5:58] we may get awful let's get off on this
[6:00] for a second
[6:01] he appears to Peter
[6:04] Peter was his right hand man he said
[6:07] Peter you got the Keys of the Kingdom
[6:09] right right did he tell him he said
[6:11] whatever you're buying on Earth I'll buy
[6:13] it in heaven whenever you lose
[6:15] Peter sees Jesus after the resurrection
[6:19] and read your Bible Peter gets up and
[6:22] goes fishing
[6:26] read the Bible Peter gets up and goes
[6:30] fish did he really believe who that was
[6:33] if he really believed that that man had
[6:35] been there raised from the dead and now
[6:38] we're standing among them
[6:40] I'd be around that man so much you
[6:42] couldn't keep me away from him right
[6:44] Peter didn't have a revelation because
[6:46] it he wasn't looking at the Jesus he
[6:48] knew
[6:50] everybody understand what I'm saying
[6:51] because Jesus was 20 years old he wasn't
[6:53] an old man yes
[6:55] yes he wasn't 33 he wouldn't didn't look
[6:57] 50. he was a young man that's God was
[7:00] young
[7:01] when God walked through the garden with
[7:03] Adam and him here's Adam and he's
[7:04] standing in their profession and here's
[7:05] God going good to see you all this
[7:07] morning y'all had a good day no he was
[7:10] down there rejoicing with him
[7:13] Adam could look at God and look at
[7:15] himself and said hey
[7:16] I was made in that man's image
[7:19] I don't believe Adam was a
[7:21] 40 year old man I believe he's a 20 year
[7:23] old man my brother around 820 Prime of
[7:25] Life all right that's your Prime of life
[7:28] and if you're not born again that's the
[7:30] whole thing when brother Branham says
[7:32] when a sinner dies he resurrects in the
[7:35] body he sinned in
[7:36] right now wait a minute we stand in this
[7:40] body
[7:41] what's the difference in me and them
[7:42] what's the difference in you and the
[7:44] Sarah
[7:45] you had a change from the inside right
[7:48] that's right that Genesis 1 26 man came
[7:51] and connected with you that's right
[7:54] that's why you're molding into that
[7:56] image everybody get that you're molded
[7:58] into that Genesis one image like Jim and
[8:00] I were talking that you know you don't I
[8:02] was going out on the internet but you
[8:03] don't want to preach it but
[8:05] you are actually two people
[8:07] you're the person your Mom and Daddy
[8:09] brought here okay
[8:11] and if you're born again you have the
[8:13] person of almighty God in your soul
[8:16] brother said it's you and him together
[8:18] as persons right right because remember
[8:22] this is my eye God gave it to me so this
[8:24] is my new birth when God gives me the
[8:26] new birth it's mine right because God's
[8:28] not an enemy giver's not gonna take it
[8:29] back that's right but what's happening
[8:31] is now I'm gonna am I going to be
[8:33] changed to a 50 year old man
[8:36] no there's one inside of me that's 20
[8:38] years old that's right
[8:40] and it's not up you under somewhere my
[8:42] theophany is not wading up yonder it's
[8:44] waiting right here amen everybody
[8:46] believes that we believe that in this
[8:48] church the theophany is right here it
[8:51] ain't over under it ain't brother Brown
[8:53] says 20 feet from you but what is he
[8:54] talking about dimension
[8:56] dimensional change but then Genesis 1 26
[8:59] man that came to me at my new birth it's
[9:01] a 20 year old man that's why I tell old
[9:03] people they look at me and they look at
[9:05] me kind of funny then I say you're
[9:06] younger than I am
[9:09] because he's had he or she is heading
[9:11] toward that new body that's right and if
[9:14] I live on in the world you know the
[9:17] world doesn't come to an end if I live
[9:18] on
[9:19] I'm going to get older and then head
[9:21] toward that new body but a lot of people
[9:22] that are you know in their 80s and 90s
[9:24] I'll tell them I say you're younger than
[9:26] I am
[9:27] because it's inside that's right it got
[9:30] trapped brother Brown said we were
[9:31] trapped into this what we were trapped
[9:33] in the best
[9:34] everybody understand that we were
[9:36] trapped in this yes this is the Trap is
[9:39] that we came by sacks yes and then we
[9:41] have to die and go by the grave
[9:43] sure we don't have to you understand
[9:45] what I mean we take a body change here
[9:46] but for most of the ones that went on
[9:48] and I'm sure listen I believe in an
[9:50] empty grave I believe they're gonna the
[9:52] graves are gonna be empty because if
[9:53] Jesus had an empty tomb
[9:55] you go by the grave you're gonna have an
[9:57] empty tank
[9:59] but listen it's not going to be like the
[10:01] World shows mounds of dirt coming up
[10:04] that's right Jesus proved in a glorified
[10:06] body he could walk through the wall so
[10:09] there's people those people are going to
[10:10] be changed brother Ryan's going to come
[10:12] up out of that grave and it's not going
[10:13] to be a mark left
[10:15] there's not gonna be any dirt have to be
[10:17] moved my Lord why
[10:20] he has become what the Creator
[10:23] he said he was going to be that's what
[10:25] we got to start believing in whether
[10:27] death takes us or whether sorrow
[10:28] sickness whatever we got what's inside
[10:30] of us is eternal that's my brother
[10:33] answer the new birth is the most
[10:34] important thing in the world that's
[10:36] right
[10:38] not just having a good feeling that's
[10:40] right not just having a good you're a
[10:41] good atmosphere and don't get born again
[10:43] get to where God is your desire right
[10:45] exactly
[10:47] and that's your desire is to serve him
[10:49] and your desire right your desires to
[10:52] the word
[10:53] the word of God because what that's what
[10:56] this right here doesn't this right here
[10:58] doesn't feed off of this
[11:01] we have to make this come under
[11:03] subjection that's right that's why we're
[11:06] talking about the Statue of a perfect
[11:07] man once we get born again we're still
[11:09] fighting this old nature that Mom and
[11:12] Daddy brought her
[11:13] body into the world
[11:16] we got a fallen nature
[11:19] that's right you gotta fall in nature so
[11:22] even when we get born again it's like
[11:24] that capsule I was telling you about
[11:26] God is encapsulated in your body if
[11:29] you're born again and he's trying to get
[11:31] out that's right well now he's not going
[11:33] to get out as a 50 year old he's that 20
[11:35] year old that God saw before the
[11:38] foundation of the world
[11:39] he saw it perfect and that's what God's
[11:42] looking at
[11:43] that's true
[11:45] remember God can't see us that's right
[11:46] he sees the blood covering he hears our
[11:49] voice
[11:50] amen because brother Brown said if he
[11:51] saw you for one second he'd have to kill
[11:53] you why because this right here can
[11:54] inherit the Kingdom of Heaven
[11:56] right as I'm standing here today this
[11:58] can't inherit this won't go in another
[12:01] dimension that's right I have to be
[12:03] changed because that Genesis 1 Came From
[12:05] Another Dimension that's right and if it
[12:07] came from another dimension it can go
[12:09] back to another dimension that's why
[12:10] Jesus said I come from
[12:13] God and I can go back to God right
[12:16] because I came out of that Dimension
[12:18] into this Dimension and now I can take
[12:20] this Dimension and what I'm going to do
[12:22] is I'm going to pick up
[12:24] the glorified body
[12:26] this is being changed it has to be
[12:29] changed I do not believe in getting a
[12:31] new one as some people say this thrown
[12:35] away and then appears a new body no I'm
[12:38] connected to this thing right here right
[12:40] but let's don't be so dogmatic that it's
[12:42] going to be this body when it was 20
[12:44] years old there's no way right
[12:46] does everybody understand that yes
[12:48] there's no way that can happen because
[12:50] brother Brown said not exactly the same
[12:52] gases because if you die gases are
[12:54] released like I said you're going most
[12:56] of you is in the septic tank right now
[12:57] so
[13:01] God can gather all that back up but
[13:04] that's just natural living that's just
[13:06] life and and the things that we do of
[13:09] this of this flesh
[13:11] um you know have a relations with your
[13:13] wife and your husband that's you know
[13:15] it's permitted by God and except you
[13:17] know God tells you the bed's undefiled
[13:19] so don't worry about that
[13:21] but we must keep this thing right here
[13:23] under subjection
[13:24] to the things of the world that's right
[13:26] okay we live in the world but not all of
[13:29] the world
[13:30] that's right social truly is correct and
[13:32] that was my next point it's got to come
[13:34] from
[13:35] but you got to take it from that mental
[13:37] concept that's what this is this is you
[13:39] got to get it mental first mental
[13:41] concept down to a spiritual revelation
[13:44] because this can never live it
[13:46] remember Satan chose this
[13:48] God chose this right right
[13:51] why but it's not your heart that's
[13:53] beaten and thumping no no it's the heart
[13:56] of you that Genesis one man I'm trying
[13:57] to tell you about
[13:59] because if you don't get that man
[14:01] changed first don't worry about what
[14:03] we're going to talk about Statue of
[14:04] purple man you get that man's inside you
[14:07] get that soul
[14:08] burn out
[14:10] the things of the world and get God
[14:12] inside there and then let him do the
[14:13] work do you have a hand that
[14:15] yeah yeah people say to you uh in your
[14:19] body
[14:22] right right so you're not this was
[14:24] somebody redeemed that's right not a lot
[14:26] of people in this message but you're
[14:28] gonna throw this body yeah
[14:31] nope it's not and I got a quote but I
[14:34] don't didn't bring it around said I'll
[14:36] raise in the body I lived in okay
[14:38] that's good enough for me right well
[14:40] what's good enough for me is that Jesus
[14:41] wrote now remember
[14:43] it wasn't the 33 year old looking body
[14:48] he came out of the ground with you
[14:50] understand what I'm saying it was 20. so
[14:53] it wasn't the same body you see what
[14:54] terminology will get you you say well it
[14:56] was exactly the same well no it didn't
[14:58] look like 33 year old with the with the
[15:01] I mean man look at what he went through
[15:03] yeah look what he went through at the
[15:05] cross the beaten they pulled his beard
[15:08] out now listen that one didn't come out
[15:10] of the Grave that's right
[15:11] that was changed his face would have
[15:14] been bleeding he'd have bruises all over
[15:15] his body the only thing he had was those
[15:18] sign of redemption he paid the price
[15:20] that's right he had died amen he had
[15:23] Rose he had paid the price but that body
[15:26] had been changed back to a 20 year old
[15:28] you know what
[15:30] if Adam would have been standing there
[15:32] in the garden that day
[15:34] he would have said hey daddy okay
[15:37] that's good is that okay he would have
[15:40] said hey Daddy because he knew that man
[15:42] at 20 years old gospel often he doesn't
[15:45] change that's right he stays the same
[15:47] all the way down through I I I'm telling
[15:49] you God don't have a Gray beard and need
[15:52] a walking stick he's not that way I'm
[15:56] not going back to that
[15:58] everybody understands the same man hey
[16:00] man Mr Marvel I just wanted
[16:05] you know that I lost my oldest son when
[16:08] I was 21. that's correct
[16:11] and a few years ago my oldest brother is
[16:14] a couple years older than I am had
[16:16] cancer and it was terminal and about a
[16:20] month before he passed away I had a
[16:24] dream and I saw him with my son and he
[16:28] was 20 years old
[16:30] and they were just horse playing
[16:33] converting around in my tree and I
[16:36] watched him and I called my son and said
[16:39] Kevin Kevin he said Is it true is it his
[16:41] time is going to pass right and whenever
[16:44] Kevin would talk to somebody seriously
[16:46] about something
[16:47] I put both his hands on his shoulder
[16:49] yeah so that's what he did in my dream
[16:52] and he said yes
[16:55] so when I woke up I called my job and I
[16:58] said I need a month's leave
[17:00] because my brother's got it and three
[17:03] weeks later he passed right so far what
[17:05] I wanted to say is that I saw both of
[17:08] them as 20 year olds sure and brothers
[17:11] Sam's been preaching that your soul is
[17:14] the real you that's right so your soul
[17:15] and your spirit is the body absolutely
[17:17] different kind of body did this but good
[17:19] good point
[17:21] yeah picture that he had of you it's in
[17:24] you right now that's crazy that's right
[17:29] that's my next Point your body's gonna
[17:31] match what that Genesis 126 person in
[17:34] see I'm telling you you listen to Holy
[17:36] Ghost Phil woman sometimes she's better
[17:37] than most preachers
[17:40] and I say that to all you that are
[17:42] listening
[17:43] that was well said sister
[17:46] absolutely
[17:48] but read what the prophet says you're
[17:50] being molded into the image that you are
[17:54] are
[17:57] because God's never present
[18:00] he saw you before the foundation of the
[18:02] world he's not going to see any
[18:03] different now that's right and like
[18:05] sister uh Barbara said now Ask Gary
[18:07] Atkins now his wife died and Margaret
[18:09] was in her 30s
[18:11] and that am I okay with she was in her
[18:13] 30s close to it she had to be 30.
[18:20] 17 years
[18:22] sorry
[18:23] it was 17 years ago
[18:25] about 17 years ago
[18:29] she was right at 40. she was right at
[18:32] 40. yes all right now Gary had a
[18:35] question about did she make it or not
[18:38] remember
[18:41] and she don't mind me telling
[18:43] so Gary has a dream he said God I need I
[18:46] want to know
[18:47] and she's okay did she make it because
[18:50] Margaret was just a real quiet
[18:52] unassuming just really making my own you
[18:55] know and all that and Gary wanted to
[18:56] know
[18:58] well he had a dream and as far as I know
[19:00] let me get part of it right she was like
[19:02] on a balcony she was climbing up a
[19:04] ladder
[19:06] and he looks over the ladder
[19:08] and he sees her
[19:10] well now he knew her at 20 years old
[19:12] he said that's what he saw he didn't see
[19:15] the 40 year old that went in the ground
[19:17] right he saw that 20 year old girl that
[19:19] he knew
[19:21] when they were young
[19:22] so see God's if God shows you something
[19:24] he can't make it different
[19:27] uh you know you say well I had a dream
[19:29] and I saw my grandpa and he would
[19:31] he looked like my grandpa well okie
[19:33] dokie then
[19:36] ain't saying no more about that but
[19:39] God's got to be scriptural if you want
[19:41] to know about something and he gives you
[19:43] desire of your heart and if you have a
[19:44] dream about somebody that's passed on
[19:47] they got to be in that 20 year old body
[19:49] they got to be in that form of the image
[19:52] that God saw him because that's where
[19:54] they're at
[19:55] remember brother Brown went in the sixth
[19:57] Dimension he all in his hair when I wait
[20:00] a minute he'll have his hair laying on
[20:01] the bed you see how this is something
[20:04] and it may play with some of you new
[20:05] people's mind but some of you older
[20:07] people we all start realizing that God's
[20:10] preserved this thing that's right and
[20:12] he's preserved you that's what I said
[20:14] about the pickling process the other day
[20:17] you went through the Cucumber
[20:18] but once you got pickled you can't go
[20:20] back to be a cucumber but you look just
[20:22] like a cucumber
[20:24] right and do you know actually pickling
[20:26] the word baptized and baptismal comes
[20:31] from the word pickle pickle I mean how
[20:34] oh gee it comes from the word what were
[20:37] we talking about the other day anyway
[20:38] it's the pickling process
[20:42] so that's what you go through when
[20:44] you're baptized and not just in the name
[20:46] of Jesus Christ but when you're baptized
[20:47] with the Holy Ghost
[20:49] God pickles you that's right he turns
[20:52] you you still look like a cucumber
[20:55] but you being pickled and you can't go
[20:59] back to a cucumber but you look still
[21:01] look like a cucumber
[21:08] good point y'all y'all want to do this
[21:13] all right
[21:15] the Lord's blessing us this morning or
[21:18] something so so just uh that we've been
[21:20] tough we've been taught that's correct
[21:22] we've been taught by the best teacher in
[21:24] the message I believe
[21:25] no doubt about it in my mind so so and
[21:30] the Bible's been put together and the
[21:31] prophet's message has been put together
[21:33] there's really
[21:35] um
[21:36] you know a lot of people have questions
[21:37] about certain things well one thing
[21:39] about brother Dale if he believes
[21:41] something you're going to know what he
[21:42] believes whether you believe it or not
[21:43] amen you're going to know what he
[21:45] believes so that's what I appreciate
[21:46] about um about him that um that we don't
[21:50] have to walk does he believe we're going
[21:51] to get does he believe it no he'll tell
[21:53] you what he believed and he spritzed it
[21:55] for 40 something years what he's
[21:57] preaching now like he said he's been
[21:58] preaching since 1969.
[22:00] which is a lot better than some people
[22:02] in the message I know but uh
[22:08] ain't got much more time
[22:10] but does everybody understand about the
[22:12] about the body and
[22:14] just remember one thing this was boring
[22:16] seeing such an iniquity
[22:18] this can't enter into the kingdom of
[22:19] heaven like it came from your mom and
[22:21] daddy because it's flesh it's flesh and
[22:23] blood
[22:25] it's human it's natural it's but it's
[22:27] okay to be that that's the way God
[22:29] wanted it to be because I believe God
[22:32] what's a human
[22:34] for eternity because if he was not a
[22:38] human and then he changed into a human
[22:39] God changed right
[22:41] so God can't change he always was a
[22:44] human being right he never was like you
[22:47] said he made man in his own image well
[22:49] sure I don't know why I didn't do that
[22:52] before but now remember listen to this
[22:54] though if you caught what I was trying
[22:56] to preach in that Genesis 1 26 man that
[22:58] Genesis 1 26 man was made in the image
[23:00] of God
[23:01] but now that 2-7 man is made in the
[23:04] image of animal
[23:06] right you understand that in Genesis 1
[23:09] 26 man was made in the image of God
[23:12] but now when he put it in the 2-7 man it
[23:14] just molded right in
[23:16] you understand which was Adam but that's
[23:19] animal flesh somebody had a question one
[23:22] time and I'll just try to explain it
[23:23] without being we don't have a lot of
[23:24] young people in here but the reason we
[23:26] have sex organs
[23:28] you say well God didn't want us to be
[23:30] born by save we weren't the 126 man is
[23:34] born by the spoken word of God right
[23:37] but God created Hollywood frog cow
[23:41] donkey horse
[23:45] mammal
[23:47] lizards whatever and we're the highest
[23:50] form of creation
[23:52] brother Branham says this is animal
[23:55] flesh do you know what he said that's
[23:57] right so that's why we were created with
[23:59] the organs that we have
[24:00] because we came into this world as in
[24:03] Creative Evolution they may understand
[24:05] that right we come in Creative Evolution
[24:08] then when God put that 126 man into the
[24:11] 2-7 man there was a molded image of God
[24:14] called Adam
[24:18] there wasn't nobody else
[24:20] I mean he had the rest of us that's why
[24:23] Adam was given the ability to reproduce
[24:25] me and you
[24:27] not sexually
[24:29] brother Brown's preached the spoken word
[24:32] is the original seat right right the
[24:34] spoken word is the way we were to come
[24:36] Adam wants to speak right we were
[24:39] supposed to be humans
[24:41] we were supposed to live on the Earth
[24:43] right we were supposed to rule and Reign
[24:45] on the earth we were supposed to subdue
[24:47] it we were supposed to multiply we were
[24:49] supposed to replenish we don't been
[24:50] through all this haven't we not yes
[24:52] right right but what Satan said is okay
[24:56] I can't get into the soul of man
[25:00] but I can pervert him so much
[25:05] until then I can interject myself in by
[25:07] Nature
[25:09] so he takes a beast that has a organ got
[25:13] it yes because remember Satan's not a
[25:15] man that's right
[25:17] here sayings of spirit he's not a man he
[25:20] doesn't have seed he can't reproduce
[25:22] himself that's why Satan is a bluff he
[25:26] can't even reproduce yourself
[25:27] he perverts what God already made
[25:33] so he takes Eve through the Beast
[25:36] and perverts
[25:38] what God wants to be spoken
[25:40] I'm sure the Beast walks up to even says
[25:42] Eve you're supposed to reproduce
[25:45] God told you that because remember
[25:46] Satan's standing there in Genesis 1 26.
[25:48] you believe it or not he was standing
[25:50] there because he was God's right-hand
[25:51] man remember he created angels and Satan
[25:54] and any angels and then come down let us
[25:56] make man in our own image all right so
[25:58] Satan's standing there and Satan's like
[25:59] multiply
[26:02] the dogs and the cats are multiplying
[26:04] the horses and the pigs are multiplying
[26:07] all these people are multiplying even
[26:09] the Beast was multiplying sexually
[26:11] because there's nothing wrong with them
[26:13] that's right right they don't have to
[26:15] cover themselves up and the cows do
[26:16] their business out in the field you know
[26:18] you understand there's no we don't go up
[26:20] they need to go in the bedroom no they
[26:21] don't do that that's nature that's
[26:24] natural
[26:25] I mean do we really it's like Trudy said
[26:28] if you if you live on a farm you want to
[26:30] know about conversion to me yeah real
[26:32] quick
[26:33] but remember that you say well how do
[26:35] you know they were they were reproducing
[26:37] because if God killed a lamb that's
[26:41] right
[26:42] did he not Bible says in Genesis God
[26:45] killed the lamb pulled the skins off
[26:47] threw him to Adam and Eve so it must
[26:49] have been two of them and if it would
[26:51] have just been two left over they'd have
[26:52] been no more Lambs so they were
[26:54] reproducing sexually right okay nature
[26:57] they were reproducing sexually so all
[27:00] satan had to do was it says hey I can
[27:02] get into that be stress there and I can
[27:04] talk to Eve
[27:05] see Satan's a great scientist he
[27:07] understands the principles of life
[27:08] that's what the prophet said he
[27:10] understands the what was the principles
[27:12] of life
[27:14] this goes in this and creates this
[27:16] that's the principles of life right so
[27:19] he says hey I'm getting that Beast
[27:20] because that Beast doesn't have a soul
[27:23] I can I can in other words I can
[27:25] manipulate
[27:26] that creature because he can either
[27:29] coincide with the man with the the Beast
[27:32] or the animal kingdom or he can coincide
[27:35] with the human they're so close
[27:37] so Satan walks up to him and says hey
[27:41] you see those animals out there they're
[27:43] reproducing
[27:45] and inside the Beast the Beast can say
[27:47] look I'm reproducing
[27:48] what's your problem I only see you and
[27:51] Adam
[27:52] God told you to multiply I heard him
[27:54] yeah
[27:57] and leave
[27:59] gets in her mind remember brother Brown
[28:02] said she tried to help God you know what
[28:04] he said she tried to help god well what
[28:06] was she doing she was trying to fulfill
[28:07] that Genesis 1 26 that's right but she
[28:10] was trying to do it carnally
[28:12] not by the word of God brother Brown
[28:14] said she got out from behind the word
[28:16] right
[28:18] because a word would have told her
[28:20] multiply and replenish like we are now
[28:22] by the spoken word of God by the
[28:24] children of God being born by the Breath
[28:27] of God not through the loins of man all
[28:29] right so they may understand we kind of
[28:31] had a little
[28:32] education class this morning but yeah is
[28:35] that all right I mean that kind of tells
[28:37] us where we're at and and the things
[28:40] that we've done and you know you look in
[28:41] the Garden of Eden and you know there's
[28:43] one thing for sure
[28:45] it wasn't an apple bag
[28:47] it was that hello world all right I mean
[28:52] if if Darwin would have just looked in
[28:54] the Bible he'd have found the missing
[28:56] link
[28:58] the one that stood between monkey and my
[29:03] ankles genetically
[29:05] somebody had to know that something was
[29:07] in there that could coincide either way
[29:10] right that's why everybody gets all
[29:13] weirded out in the world when you say it
[29:14] wasn't an apple it was a a beast well
[29:16] the Bible calls it a beast he was turned
[29:19] into a serpent so that he couldn't
[29:21] produce like that anymore actually God
[29:24] just took that whole line
[29:26] and destroyed it
[29:28] off the face of the Earth
[29:32] I was
[29:34] looking at stuff because I like to
[29:37] research things
[29:39] and uh found out one day that all snakes
[29:42] in the world go back to that Wednesday
[29:47] but when you look at the skeleton of
[29:49] Ebola you can see appendages where it
[29:51] used to have arms and legs and no other
[29:53] snakes
[29:55] amazing wow yeah it's pretty amazing
[29:59] so you see there that
[30:02] when that when that man asked brother
[30:03] Brown said well where's the Beast today
[30:06] he said God help me what's in that
[30:09] serpent
[30:10] he just changed it so much to where man
[30:14] doesn't see any shoulders or anything
[30:15] like that so man goes it's an apple
[30:20] now if you've eaten an apple and had to
[30:22] cover her private parts up
[30:24] why don't we when we eat out yeah when
[30:26] we eat apples like brother Ernie
[30:27] villanue said why didn't God give them a
[30:29] glove
[30:31] and something to go over their mouth
[30:34] but it wasn't that
[30:37] because remember the first thing Adam
[30:38] said was we're naked and God said who
[30:40] told you that right
[30:42] because remember they walked around
[30:43] naked the whole time and it didn't
[30:45] bother him
[30:46] but what my point is too is when we
[30:49] start when we go back to the image of
[30:51] God it's not sex anymore it's going back
[30:53] to the spoken word of God just like I
[30:56] explained the other day daddy started
[30:58] with 15 people in 1971. now we got
[31:01] almost 100 or a little more than 100
[31:03] that go here that is spiritual
[31:05] multiplication that is the Fulfillment
[31:08] of Genesis 1 26 to multiply and
[31:11] replenish the Earth see you know what
[31:13] God just took Satan's plan
[31:16] I said okay buddy you may have stopped
[31:19] the Son of God from being born in the
[31:20] garden
[31:21] but I'm going to bring him down into
[31:23] your reading
[31:24] and I'm gonna raise them all up and then
[31:26] we're gonna destroy your kingdom right
[31:29] in the same thing that would destroy us
[31:32] if we'd let it this
[31:34] because this will destroy you if you let
[31:36] it right go down we have a couple of
[31:39] questions on the water pipe body
[31:42] when we look at Jesus
[31:44] when he was come back and was talking to
[31:47] the disciples he ate food that's correct
[31:52] and he also said
[31:55] this flesh and Bone he didn't mention
[31:57] blood right he mentioned flesh and Bone
[31:59] crap didn't Jesus have blood that's
[32:01] going to be dead yes I think we're
[32:04] maybe he was trying to tell them
[32:08] that the structure of man which is bone
[32:10] and flesh because blood's not a
[32:12] structure you understand the reason he
[32:14] was eating that and he didn't hit the
[32:16] floor there was some structure there
[32:17] that was holding it together you
[32:19] understand what I'm saying because
[32:20] remember brother went across a certain
[32:22] time right brother Rand went across the
[32:24] curtain of time into that sixth
[32:26] Dimension and they didn't eat and drink
[32:28] over there why they were not in their
[32:30] right condition
[32:32] you said boy that's pretty right yeah it
[32:33] is but you know what God wants them back
[32:36] here this is where we have dominion
[32:39] he wants us back here in our flesh
[32:41] bodies all them people in the sixth
[32:43] Dimension said we don't eat or drink
[32:44] here right right
[32:46] we're waiting to come back there because
[32:49] remember when the Rapture takes place
[32:51] they're going to be standing right here
[32:53] are you saying we'll eat throughout
[32:55] eternity oh absolutely no doubt we will
[32:57] absolutely not to recreate not to not to
[33:02] recreate sales or anything we're going
[33:03] to do it because we want to Hallelujah
[33:06] and there's not going to be Weight
[33:08] Watchers and no cats
[33:11] somebody ought to sing a song there's no
[33:14] calories in glory
[33:20] we're coming back here to eat and drink
[33:25] and enjoy ourselves
[33:27] just like we enjoy ourselves now with
[33:30] all the sin gone
[33:32] amen
[33:34] Garden questions
[33:47] I might go
[33:50] away
[33:52] hey Trudy the first one would have been
[33:55] Jesus yeah
