========================================

chapter I'll see you later buddy thank you thanks Tim Matthew 5 Matthew 5 from here man from here Matthew Chapter 5 Matthew Chapter 5 thank you we're working on our speech therapy over here right what it said is raise your hand or something if you can't hear me well if they can't hear you they can't raise their hand okay you can throw him too if you want can't hear me right make him stand in the corner you Lord we're recording all right all right so let's uh let's just start reading through uh the Beatitudes to kind of set the set the stage Matthew 5:1 and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him and opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meat for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst out after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall seek God blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for persecuted they the prophets which were before you and those last week often times we forget that um it's it's supposed to happen that people will despise us that will reject what we believe and I believe that kind of helps us it should help us help our help our faith and help our um confidence to know that it's written in God's word that that's how people will behave toward us so if you break these up you can kind of see the first four are God calling you the the attributes of the of of the people that God are calling the poor in spirit mourning meekness and then hungering hungering and thirsting for righteousness and when you when you start looking at these individually they overlap so much you can almost it's almost difficult to um see what's different between mourning and hungering for righteousness and then once you're if you hunger and thirst for righteousness you'll be filled so continuing on to the next four that God after God calls you and fills you with the Holy Ghost then you can be merciful you can be pure in heart peacemakers persecuted you won't be persecuted if you're if you're not uh you're persecuted for a reason because you're filled with the Holy Ghost and youve got you're manifesting God's word just to kind of put in uh maybe as simple as I can make it those first four the first one is I can't do it I'm poor in spirit I I realize God gives you a revelation that you need something from him and then you begin to mourn for sin mourn for sin in your own life mourn for sin in in your church in the world and the around you and then meekness is really in this context being able to be taught being able to be led that you can you want to be you want to find God so God gives you the ability to be able to be lead like a sheep Meek and lo just like Jesus and then longing to be filled I turn it off so let's um look at kind of compare on the this is The Sermon on the Mount and over in Luke he preached What's called the sermon on the plane let's go to Luke chapter 6 and four the Beatitudes are from Matthew are repeated here followed by four Wes kind of compare what's the U what's kind of the opposite of the woes kind of show you the opposite of of what happens if you don't receive these blessings so Matthew 6 verse 20 l oh sorry Luke 6 verse 20 thank you and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of God blessed are you that hunger now for ye shall be filled blessed are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake Rejoice ye in that day and for Joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their father unto the prophets but woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your consolation rich not in the things that God gives but rich in the things of this world that you keep up to yourself pleasures of the world instead of the things of Heaven woe unto you that are full you for you shall hunger full of the things we want to be full of of of God's word we look at what righteousness is in a second woe unto you that laugh now for you shall mourn and weep woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets there's another place that's written in the word it's it's uh we shouldn't be dishearted when people speak ill of us because it's written in God's word that that will happen but I say unto you which here love your enemies do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and unto him that smiteth thee on the one she offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak AB bite forbid not to take thy coat also so we look at that first one uh Luke 6:24 is the comparison to Matthew where he says the poor in spirit woe un you that are rich for you have received your consolation I'm just kind of going to run through these real quick so we can finish up May on hungering and thirsting for righteousness and then mning Luke 6:25 War unto you that are full for you shall hunger War you that laugh now for you shall mourn and weep compared to mourning for the sin in your in your own life the sin in your and around you in your family and in your church and in your the people that you associate with and brother renam said in uh there it is questions and answers sigh and cry for the Abominations that's done in the city where do you see that I can show you 10,000 speaking in tongues to one that's really burdened for sin that can't even pray an hour can't even pray an hour really true burdens for sin burden for wanting wanting to have a longing to have God more in your life and then uh the meek is not the meek is one not included in uh in in Luke and really that means um in your journey toward being fill with the Holy Ghost and your journey toward knowledge of God and and righteousness meekness is the opposite of self-will toward God and ill will toward men it's really being to sum it down it's being able to be being able to be led meek and lowly in James 1 through2 he said wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with a meekness the engrafted word which is able to to save your souls that's being able to be tall to be able to receive it not being all Hardy and everything this is and 2 Corinthians 10:1 he said now I beseech myself second Corinthians 10 is just a great lesson in meekness cuz Paul's coming he says I I'm I'm beseeching you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ to impr presence and base among you base means just as low as you can get I'm not coming with a big Hy idea that I'm something big I'm coming to you in the Bas that only comes by a a true relationship with God I'm I know who I am but I know what I'm talking about too he said be being an advent and bold toward you and then move further on down and four five for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God who the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ that's that's real meekness when God up begin to tear down all of your own ideas and your own imagination that's right so he can put his word in you amen and true meekness is not weakness what people is you know a lot of might might have been taught before because true meekness will not compromise the principle of righteousness or compromise with evil there's a meekness of the world that um is is kind of like well maybe I guess the way best way to say is cifi that you'll let you'll let evil evil slip into your home and let evil um slip into your your life because you're you won't stand you don't you're not standing on the principles of righteousness right but true meekness that comes from God won will not compromise amen with with evil meekness restrain from private Revenge but doesn't conflict with the requirements of fidelity to God is calling his people now Moses was very Meek we know in the Old Testament it was written that he was the meekest man in all the Earth but when he came down off the mountain amen he saw he saw the children of Israel that had going against God's word and were going after that golden calf and he threw down the idols and slew every all the transgressions by the age of the sword and Christ was meek and lowly but he drove the desecrated from the temple with HS that he he bound up together in uh acts 16:37 Paul said they have beaten us openly condemned being Romans and have cast us into prison and now that they trust us out prively n verely but let them come themselves and fetch us out out of prison let them come fetch us out that's right in John 18:23 Jesus answered him if I have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smilest thou me m this doesn't mean you've got to be a and and I um I just let me tell you a little a few little stories that i' heard from Billy Paul giving testimonies one time uh he told his story of how his family was in a diner just to show you the two opposites extreme opposites of meekness this uh he was in a diner with his family and people he said bil Paul said people would um come up and and uh you know a lot of times people might take it try to not really meaning to but kind of take it vage said well can you come over to my house this afternoon or can you spend the weekend and and things like that and Billy Paul brother Brandon would would not uh say no I can't do that he just he'd leave it all up to Billy Paul and Billy Paul said he'd roll his eyes over to him like help me get out of this just just real Spirit of meekness he wouldn't say uh I ain't got time for none of that but he he just roll his eyes over to him and leave it up to Billy Paul to help him get out of that because he was trying to draw people to the word and didn't want to put anything in the way of somebody coming to the message but compare that to the time that he was in a diner when there was somebody at that little bar when he uh they they were swearing and cussing and these old uh fellas in the in the restaurant started swearing and cussing and uh brother brandham Billy Paul said he brother brandham got up from the table and Billy Paul is like oh no what's he going to do now and he went up to him and he tapped one of the fellas on the shirt on the shoulder that was um sweared up a storm and said are you going to put that food in that dirty mouth and he said that man turned meat in yeah right you know the real meekness is is when you have somebody backing you up right and brother Brandon had somebody to back him up right and that was the Holy Spirit now let's give a hunger and thirst for righteousness they that hunger and thirst for righteousness shall be filled and this to me when I was um seeking the Holy Ghost this was I really hung to this as as a promise that God I I I trusted God that his word would never fail and I hung on this that he would come to feel me now this doesn't this promise does not stop at the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right it's it goes all the way up and uh I if I could summarize this I maybe summarize it as how close to God can you get are you ever satisfied with if you're ever satisfied with your condition that there's something wrong We should strive to get as close to God as we can amen that's that's the summary Luke 6:25 woe unto you that are full for ye shall hunger woe unto you that laugh now for you shall mourn and we now if you're a fool now there's there's something wrong we we should always be striving to be closer to God Amen and Luke uh let's see I think uh this is kind of getting into a different topic but if you kind of look at the way that the Old Testament Tabernacle was laid out it kind of late it goes through your the whole journey of the Christian and when Jesus when when they found him in the temple he was in Solomon's porch just inside in the inside that outer court and what happened in Solomon's porch was they would come to hear the word they would come to learn and when you that first step when you go through those five gates of the outer Court you're in the first part of being called of uh and you begin to Crave to hear the word that's why it um I I think any Christian that's not hungering and thirsting to hear to God and to read more and to pray more all the time that there's something lacking in our life because that's that's really where it all begins at Solomon's torch that's where Paul listened to Galeo when uh Galeo and all the other scribes and the scholars would sit in Solomon's porch and teach in that first that first stage of the journey and then uh not going to get into it right now but moving on in through the in court into the holy of holies where they couldn't back then they couldn't do that because the holy of holies was closed off but now it's open to all us and I um I remember this when I was uh growing up I remember here this we went over to this uh some some brother and sister's house and there was this a minister brother from Texas and I I don't remember who he is but this his testimony left such a mark on my life and his testimony was that he was a drunker and one day he was going to the alcohol store and he heard about uh he'd been witnessed to maybe all his life and his his mom had told him about the message he was on his way to the alcohol store and he saw on the way a a vision of Christ over the street and he had his head down and he looked up at him the blood was dripping off but my point is that all of a sudden something was quickening in him and he went home and that weekend he read through the entire Bible in one weekend you tell me the spirit of God know somebody just like he was when Elijah ran before ahab's chariots to read the entire Bible in one weekend when that kind of echo my testimony when uh I mentioned before about how I was walking with my dad one day and he started telling me about the future home and something quickened in me and I could not keep wa you it it it's it's hard to uh growing up you know you're told over and over again to read the Bible study the message but when something happens something's quickening you you can't keep away from it and I I so I I think that's like the first stage of beginning the hunger and righteousness hunger and hunger for righteousness remember the story of the little boy that brother Bron told told about um he wanted to see God so bad and nobody could show him J and he went to his mama and she said well you need to ask the pastor so went the pastor he said no man can see God and live and finally he went to a deacon in brother br's church and took him fishing and the Deacon took him out on the water and he said I see God everywhere his old tears eyes teared up because there was God on the inside that's what we should be looking for not God when you got God on the ins side you can see God everywhere not just um something intellectual something that you're trying to prove by reading a lot or by coming in uh uh just uh a big fancy uh but what I'm trying to say y'all know so uh I start looking at some of these quotes hungering and thirsting for righteousness the lamb and the dve and said he he went to Oakland California and I thought this was real interesting he said I say this not to be any different from other any other city but I have found in this revival the most hungry and thirsty place that I have seen from New York to the West Coast and Skip on down it's about the only place that I found that a real genuine hunger is in the heart now this is in 1957 so he he's been to a lot of places a't that striking that out of all the places this is the only place that he could found that had a real true genuine hunger it just shows how rare it is to have such a craving in your heart to see how close you to get to God now I know now I know for when the anointing strikes me it's just one big blast out across this audience here and I know that you're hungry and God bless your hearts honey I hope that God just fills you so full of the Divine Love Of Christ until none of the modernisms and things will ever be able to separate you from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus stay with it the expectation he said then you want more of God you Hunger for More Of God and because that you do Hunger is a very fine evidence that there is more of God to receive you can't ever exhaust inexhaustible Fountain amen thirsting for life he said there's no satisfaction until that thirst is quenched by God's presence but the devil tells you you want to be modern and thirst he said The Thirst is an alarm it's an alarm plot that's thirsting the soul sets off alarm clock a little buzzer inside of you to tell you that death is lurking night that if you don't get water pretty soon you've got to die and it gets louder and louder until finally you keep putting it off and you'll die because it's an alarm clock and I I found that to be true even after receiving the Holy Ghost right that if you go for too long without praying you something something something got to give you got to uh if you go too long without reading the Bible or getting down getting down with God until you have been laid under the fountain for a while then uh you just it's hard to stand and and thirst he said um make sure I'm on the right down on the bottom I have nothing against uh going to church which is you know we try to satisfy a lot of time satisfy that thirst for many different things and churches might be one of them that isn't the satisfaction it's to find God the Living God the god of Heaven into your soul that satisfies that longing and thirsting that you long for if you want give that thirst the right place in your life and want thirst and take the things that God provided to stop that thirst with to quench it then Satan will lead you to some of his stagnant cesal of this world you must have it somewhere if you can't find food you eat from a garbage can but there is no reason for that when you're thirsting for God because God is a living God Amen God makes a promise and then comes around and fulfills that promise that's the interpretation of the promise and I would dare anybody to take God at his word see every word in that Bible isn't the truth that's right that's where that thirst is in there amen so just to end I'll finish with a little story that was um um I hope you'll take this right um this is story that uh somebody told me about this uh they were having a Revival down in in Florida one time years ago and Billy Paul and some other brothers were down there and this brother it was a minister brother that actually married my uh brother-in-law Monica's brother and um the power power of God was just was just present that uh spirit of the Lord was there and this brother actually died and they took him to the back and they um he been dead for 30 to 45 minutes and uh they took him back and Billy Paul and this other brother that actually relayed this story was back there and uh Billy they went to pray and Billy Paul said okay the angel is here and they prayed for him and the man came back to life later on after that he married um my uh my Monica's brother and uh it was it was told to me that this other brother and I I won't name his name right now but he said said uh you know that the presence of the Lord in that meeting was so strong and so great and the power of God came down and raised up this brother from the dead and and you a lot of times you think I've heard people say well you know all week I look forward to get in the presence of God feeling that presence that I feel at church that you kind of get in your head that you can only have that Presence at one time in your life but this particular brother said you know you can have that same presence of that same anointing that same power of God that was in that meeting where that brother was raised from the dead you can have that same presence every day of your life am every day when you wake up in the morning when you go to bed at night and that really struck to me who said that was not really important the point of it is and we should always be striving whenever you think I've I've met the max that I the maximum amount of my relationship with God there's there's a problem right cuz you can never exhaust the inexhaustible Fountain of Life you should always be striving to see how close we can get to God so with that in mind let's go Matthew 14 take hungering and thirsting for righteousness Matthew 14 verse 13 through 16 and this this little story that just has so much in it you you think well uh it's just a story it's a story of God's Crea power God's providing for us but um there's just so much you can get out of the fish and lo story right Matthew 14 13 now people had seen they had seen God's word being fulfilled in this man that had come on the scene so they were they were after they were something in them hungry and thirst time verse 13 when Jesus so John had been beheaded in prison when Jesus heard of it he departed then by ship into a desert Place apart cuz he he he had emotions just like every one of us when he heard John had then beheaded it it struck him you know um CU he loved John and when the people had heard thereof they wasn't just going to sit still they followed him on foot out of the cias and Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward him and he healed their sheep and they followed him on foot out of the city probably without any respect for carrying food or uh taking care of anything the natural boy that's when you'll really find something when you just when everything in this world just just a dropway and say I don't care how long it takes or what's going to happen I want to be filled with the righteous righteousness of God and when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this is a desert place and the time is now passed send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves VI the said Jesus said unto them they need not depart they don't need to depart because I am the word I am the bread of give you them to eat so this this little lesson right here is if you want it God will provide it you'll feel you then let's go to uh Luke 11 that we're very all very familiar with this chapter 11 let's just start at verse one and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples and he said unto them when you pray say Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so on Earth give us day by day our daily bread what's our daily bread his righteousness right and forgive us our sins for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall get go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three Lo for a friend of mine is in his journey and his journey has come to me and I have nothing to separate for him and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed I cannot rise and give Thee I say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his impunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth and I say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and he shall find knock and it shall be open unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that sheth findeth and him that knocketh it shall be open now this is really specifically for the Holy Ghost but generally for you remember God brother said God wants you to ask for big things after you get the Holy Ghost don't stop there if you want in James chapter 2 it says if you want Wisdom ask God to give you wisdom if you want knowledge ask him to give you knowledge sir if you want uh if you want to know how to raise your kids ask him to give you wisdom to raise your kids if you want to be a better Christian a better everything big things and you think a lot of things big things are are you're real sick so I'll ask God to hear you that's such a small thing that's what brother said that's a small thing the big things are knocking down the strongholds in your life the parable of fatherhood verse 11 if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him amen and what about all the other things not just the Holy Spirit once you receive the Holy Holy Spirit you can with confidence come to God believing that he hears and answers your prayer and will give you out of the abundance of his of his kingdom all the things that you need and ask for not not silly stuff like I want to win the lottery but the things that are written in his word the promises that he's made to you and uh we're almost out of time let's look at one more slide Philippians 384 to 14 Y doubtless and I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things that we count them but D that I may win Christ well that's pretty powerful is it mhm he counted everything as D that he might win Christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made con formable unto his death if by any means I made Might attain into the resurrection of the dead so uh this is just leading into next time we're going to see what righteousness is and how important it is amen because uh if you don't have righteousness his righteousness is the only only thing that will meet God's requirement not my righteousness or righteousness by the law but the righteousness that will let us attain into the resurrection of the Dead amen and let's stop there amen amen on
