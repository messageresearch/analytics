«  310       †          When He went up out of the water, he said, "I saw heavens open." The prophet saw it. He saw the heavens open.
311    And here come, descending out of Heaven, a form of a Dove; and a Voice, saying, "This is My part of the earth that I have redeemed, and from this part of the earth I will redeem the rest of it, for He is My Word made manifest." "And the whole world, I spoke it into existence by My Word," Hebrews 11. "And Satan has held it all this time, but I've come to redeem it. So much of it has made His body, and I'm coming to dwell in it."

«  312       †          John said, "I saw the holy City, the New Jerusalem descending out of Heaven, as a Bride adorned for her Husband." And where did it settle on? Just exactly like it did on there; upon the earth.
313    Jesus was part of that earth that the Holy Ghost descended upon, (is that right?) and remained upon Him forever. It never can leave Him. It's always there. He and God are One. Always has to remain!
314    And so John saw the holy City, the New Jerusalem, descending like a common, or a--a dove, coming down out of Heaven and settling upon a redeemed, entire earth, (to do what?) to claim every attribute that He made the earth for. Every man that was represented in the Eternity, and every woman, is redeemed then. She has been scoured and burned by Fire.
315    Jesus, in His fiery temptations in the wilderness, for forty days. After that, notice, it was ready for His ministry then.

«  316       †          Think of it, the Holy Ghost descending upon earth, Jesus, and that holy Blood! Now watch, and I hope I don't go too deep for you, see. The holy Blood that was created by God; the Blood, the Life, the creation of God. "Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God." Oh! You see it? God, made in creation. He was Spirit. The Bible said, "He is the beginning of the creation of...

we've been reading in Ephesians 1 and then we'll go to Matthew 13 which is the scriptures we we're using some day and had to cause of company and things move over just a little bit but drop back in tonight and pick up our thought and we'll continue on because I don't like to just when somebody comes in I don't like to just drive on I've told you about that cuz you do that and and the people don't know what you're talking about hard to understand us anyway but then when you do that but I try to do it that way okay so we just thank you and I mean you know thank you for putting up with us and and all and changing it now remember as Terren said don't come tomorrow night cuz if you do there probably won't be nobody here you know but that's uh you know and on the internets and the things I hope they got to change over we try to do everything and I come out here every Sunday see and repeat most of the announcements you know to where to make sure that we we get it in the right order and all like that so just remember no service tomorrow night but then remember that uh I think the next would be the bible study on the 5ifth or not what is it not the fifth what is a Bible study it's on the first Saturday that be the third okay and then remember the eight together time for Christmas okay and remember brother fory will be with us the Lord willing ministering the watch not service so pray for him and the things that he still needs his license the last account I found from him was he hasn't got his license yet they uh you know they something through the way the doctor done that and then when the doctor got back into it the doctor don't want to sign it but he' already put forth and done everything but all it needed was his signature and that's the best I can understand he just didn't want to clear it up and go on he wanted him to go through some more tests well sister Johnny can tell you about that when you do like that and it happens it it ties up a lot of things all right you know and they don't want to put their hand of signature to the point okay but just pray for him God will give him that I can tell you a story about him I think it was was see he went to he was a bus driver to get his license for a bus driver he didn't even know period by a bus you know and really he was just seeing what to do and he walks in you know and talks to the people and the guy said just come right on over here and he just filled out his license from a bus driver and he didn't you know he he never even done nothing he just walked out with his license for bus driver you know so God can take care of a lot of things he he's a good God Amen all right just pray for him that the Lord would bless him father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for everything and Lord we've come together tonight as T not a little early from our Wednesday regulars but knowing thanksgiving's coming up and people would want to be with their families and everything Lord and traveling backwards and forth so we we do the best we can to just try to help everybody and because we want to do right in that way Lord and and we're just concerned with the people so thank you for that ask you asking you Lord to just bless each and every one of us remember the ones that are away from us and Lord take care of them remember the sick ones and just bless each one Lord we thank you for your love and your grace as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen hey Ephesians one verse 8 wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us what the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he ha purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times you know the end of all things has now come upon you and I so we ought to be able to believe in the the dispensations of where we're at is the point they might gather gather in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him all right let's go over to Matthew 13 verse 37 remember this is explaining the parable of the S of the seed and he answered and said unto them he that sth the good seed is the son of man the field is the word the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tires are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed what the tires now not the good seed that what he sowed them is the devil and the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels you may be seated the Lord have his way with the reading of the word now I want to make a couple announcements tonight and I'll redo it Sunday so remind me to do that because we've been you know we we've kind of get slack about things and you know we we run into problems and all and we just kind of drift along and I've just always been that way I'm not one I I couldn't be uh they tried to get me to be a boss at where I was at Y and cotton mill I couldn't do that and I went to to I was work to Georgia Chair Company they were training me for that and I just couldn't do it when it come down for the time of General Motors they tried to get me to do everything there and I wouldn't do it cuz I'm not one I know you think I am but I'm just not one to rules rules rules and regulations I I'm not that way and I'm sorry and that kind of lets things float around to where that you have trouble now take what I'm saying and let it go okay we're coming up to the Christmas time time we always have a Christmas time for the people of the church all right now that Christmas time is dedicated for the people at the church those who call this their Church home okay it's not to say tithe payers or this that or the other because it it's you know you get into the kids you get into no it's for the people who count this their Church home we try to have a Christmas time to tell them our appreciation the giving of gifts for their offices and and things you know and and all of the things to try to do to get them to do that but I wish you would consider that on doing things and I'm just saying it see don't invite someone to come on those specified days that we said aside I'm just I'm not you said well you don't want them saved no see you get upset with him and go go ahead just remember you got all other the year to invite them why invite them that one day you can invite them any other time you have any other time or all the other time I'm just saying for that day only it's good to not invite because we give gifts we give gifts to as I say about all of the offices all of the the uh people of the church that have and you know and we and and we say it in love if you take it wrong you're you're the one we give away you know quite a few thousand at Christmas as gifts to people that's what we want to do that's always been my desire My Desire is not to save nothing I've always told you if I had taken the money that was due me from this church I would be a multi-millionaire that's no joke you know it's true that because you know what I've done we've took it in that way we can help the missionaries we can not have to worry about things we can help each other and do it cuz that's always been my desire all right but see we give gifts and we give them to those of the ones who count this their Church home those who work labor and do the things you know teachings and all of the things the ministers the deacons and all we we try to do that to show you our appreciation now we always have done and will keep doing we'll have have a small token now the reason I'm reading this I'm going to read it to you again Sunday we always have a small token to give when visitors comes we don't want somebody to come in and a kid seeing people getting something and the kids not get it I mean I'm just a do old granddaddy brother brandom he talks about Christmas always say every year if you want to put up a Christmas tree you put one up brother brandom did if you don't want to put up a Christmas tree don't put it up but don't make fun of the the person you know don't spend your time searching the message to try to prove that you're not take you not have a Christmas tree are you well we do have one what did Brother Brown say about the kids even he said them little kids don't understand he said don't don't Hammer them about this thing they don't understand you know and all like that he he understood he was a great person about doing that but all right but see we always try to give little tokens because we don't want the people to be offended like that all right now I'm running all the way through with it see like times that we have special dinners or special events all right don't go and invite too much into that special event I'm just saying special events like the the uh the Christmas dinner uh you know the the Thanksgiving dinner the uh the dinners that we have set aside for that uh the Valentine Banquets the uh the things you know don't go and invite everybody else you say you don't want these to come well what if everybody invited yeah what if everybody invited somebody to come we set aside those things for you as a church in a time to have together together as a church all right so just you know you got all the rest of the year don't worry about those things all right now we've cut down and Terrence mentioned the other day about the taking the prayer request and things we kind of got where it was getting more into uh running the old order of everybody waiting till they come out here and I'm going to say this sometimes the song leaders wait until they come out here and say their request that's IR that's that's against Terrence you're supposed to go to him now you say I'm let no don't talk to me about being led of the Lord okay don't even mention it about being led of the Lord if you're LED of the Lord come in my office and tell me and then I'll do it always glad to somebody come in late what did I tell you hey bring your prayer request I'll read it that's no problem but this don't do it in the wrong way to where you know that we get to talking talking too much during the song Services the song service is set aside for to build the worship service it's not set aside for your testimony I'm telling you now I don't care what you say I feel L my office is in there you come to my office then we'll tell it out here we're trying to get an order because everything's supposed to be brother random laid it down if you don't believe it I'll give you the church AG you know the where he's saying what to do and what to take care of it see it's never just talking or or anything or saying well you know I feel L to tell my testimony come to my office I'll be glad for you to I've had many times just step back and say come and give you a testimony have no problems be glad to do that see but see we we want to cut down on this one but we don't want to cut down on the other and see too much talking you say I was trying to build it up you're killing it but too much talking now you're going to get offended at me so go ahead praise the Lord at least I've done something tonight I'll make you get a little patience tribulation worketh patience so okay see so just do it in the right order and everything will be right okay now there's been some confusion that I've been aiming to approach this and I just didn't CU like I said I don't like those things of rules there's been some confusion even about the property that brother Donnie and I lease for deer hunting now brother Donnie and I at least that we have never asked a dime from anybody we pay the full expenses we've asked you to come if you're going to hunt with us and put up stands and work and you know help us plant the stuff and everything we've never asked you to do anything other than come and help us we pay the full expenses we pay the full expenses of the fertilizer the seeds the thing we do that you say well I thought that you know see back years ago you thought I was paying the leas is from the church a lot of you didn't know it brother Donnie's always paid ever since we started leasing he's always paid High the bill we just didn't say nothing about it because he said Let It Go so we just you know we invite you to come and Hunt we invite the church people to come and Hunt but don't you go invite somebody to come and hunt you see where we get in we get us in trouble I mean we've we're inviting you to come hunt we take you hunting we'll go with you we'll put you on the stands I love it they life make fun of me we hunted in a hunting club one time and I put five people on deer that year alone and never killed a thing five good Georgia deer brother call got a big old 12p pointer you want to see the pictures of that one see we try to do what we can to help you say well I thought that it was the church no it's never been the church it's brother Donnie and I you said well we gave you a raise to take care of well did we give brother Donnie a raise to take care of his uhuh uh uh uh that come out of my money that comes out of my tax money that goes on my tax status and you didn't know it for all those years that always fil the taxes is one sitting right here we just don't say things we we kind of let it to be you know but you see the point you can't just say well I'm going to invite so and so check it with brother Donnie and I and then we'll look at those things if we got the room if we ain't got too many people hunting or whatever we doing we'll do everything cuz we want you to hunt it's there but don't get the idea that the church is paying for it so we're the church so we think we ought to have a right to use it because we're the church it's not the church paying for it it's never been that way brother Donnie just didn't want me to tell what we was doing but we've it's the way it's always been done okay see now that get those things clear off of our mind see you just don't go and invite somebody ask us and we'll invite and we will take care of them I love it I tell you I do it I've tooken many a time people put them on three or four stands and I'd be well after daylight get into my stand and a lot of times I'd just go sit down somewhere but the Lord's always blessed me I got a brother-in-law he's crazy as can be he'll take 10 people and put them in the woods he'll go sit down over somewhere by sale but he'll kill more deer than you will because it's just it's meant out way okay get those out of the way we get into the message all right see I don't Like rules and regulations I don't like to have to make statements because it hurts people's feelings well if I do I'm sorry but the statement is made so let's go from there okay now we're talking about changing dispensations we're talking about that there's been so many different dispensations all the way through and what I've been dealing with lately is the dispensation of the son of man the main thing I want you to see the son of man dispensation you would count that all if you're just saying a prophet if you're just saying Jesus was a prophet look what you're leaving out to me the son of man dispensation and where he was at and what he was doing now listen is the most important dispensation of the entire Bible because there will be nothing else if the son of man dispensation is not brought in order right you say well the Son of God and I'll give you brother BR he's inherit of all things right amen but you know there wouldn't be a Son of God to come and live in your soul today if the son of man had not given his life on Calvary right you see it's where it's at you see why we spent so much time talking about him as being a savior as being a redeemer as being God in flesh as being almighty God Amen that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and see then by doing that we can come down to the basis of seeing what part the son of man played in the Plan of Redemption you see where you'd be with the people of the message and 90% of the people click on right now and you say son of man that's a prophet you don't even read Matthew Mark Luke and John to see what that son of man was doing and would do and has continued to do and that's why he's got to return back in the end time amen as not just a son of man not just I'm going to be plain blunt not just brother brandom as a prophet that doesn't fulfill it that's right but he did have a what he came and brought us the message the message to be so everything is related to him you think I'm just saying this no the entire thing is related to the fact of whether or not Jesus Christ was almighty God all right and why he would call himself son of man brother brandham said I know twice I was looking at it today he said they didn't understand why he'd say that well do we understand why he said that then you don't listen Matthew Mark Luke and John deals with the writing of the life of the time of Jesus Christ right but none of the Apostles even John and them the writing of it John is the only one that has any connection to the son of man when he went to patmas and comes forth in chapter one and sees one La unto the son of man G about the PS and sees the the rest of them said nothing about it the great Apostle Paul in all of his teachings says nothing about doesn't mention son of man sure he knew who he was and what he was for he tells us about the Redeemer The Advocate the The God Who come in human flesh he tells all about that but why didn't he talk about him as son of man and like I said it see why would the Lord Jesus walk out there in the first of his ministry and start talking about son of man I still got another message to follow this but then why with brother brandham in 48 was the earliest I found where he mentioned son of man you know in 48 he starts talking about son of man I mean that's just an early record that we have there's no telling what he preached before then you know that was not recorded that's what's recorded isn't that very odd that he starts out with son of man why are those things there and what's the purpose e the son of man would have it while I was bringing it up Sunday but it just brought it up in a little different way to where I wanted to get and stopped off we're talking about the son of man and who he was the Savior the Redeemer the all and all the you know the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelling in him who in that man that walked on the shores of Galilee that body was created right that body had a beginning it was created not be it did it had to have a Redemption we'll read it in the minute not because he was sinful but because that he had a beginning God never had a beginning Son of God doesn't have a beginning see but people don't understand the godhead that's why you got all these River Jordans in these ideas see they look at him is like well there he was he just Body Spirit and soul of man and then he comes over here in his ministry and he gets up over here and he gets over there and all at once God just comes down and then God leaves him and lets him die now you ain't got no Bible but yet your people this Glory Hallelujah but you see then we become hot balls like we done it I know two times go one certain brother was up preaching in a certain meeting and everybody in the building was rejoicing and you could look down the line where we were sitting in a line and we were all sitting there but the problem was the next time it was done a certain brother wanted to make me comfortable and he pull my seat out in the aisle and when I sat down I was like a sore thumb and everybody in the building screaming and hollering about the idea and I'm sitting there I give an amen every once in a while something like good amen but you see that's why I believe in one true and living God to believe in one true and living God then that would have to be the thing that we brought out in the Life few services that who was that in body he was a man a creation amen but his soul was the very soul of almighty God it wasn't another soul that something happened to that soul and then this happened to that and his Spirit was the spirit of almighty god well you know what that makes him the fullness of the godhead bodily right they don't Seated on the River Jordan an anointing came on him for his ministry Amen to that you know brother R said that made him to fullness was that anointing but you know what that anointing left him in the garden Holy Spirit never left him in the garden or he dead his soul didn't leave him his Spirit didn't leave him that went out on Calvary he said into thy hands I Comm in my spirit right brother R said what he said his body went to the Grave he said his Spirit went back to God who gave it he said his soul went to preach to those souls in prison he said his soul his being his person of his theophany went to hell for you and I there is one true and living God that way you ain't got no problems with the Bible and who he's talking well I just don't understand because he speaks here and over here he speaks that's what I trying to bring out in that adoption series see no matter what you are you realize it ain't going to get my message tonight but you realize that all of your life that part of you that was called a soul a being a nature whatever you want to call it was motivated and directed into the line of this world right R around and say said those demons those angels that fell with Satan he said they give us a nature right now you think the day you got born again that that just clean out everything and you don't never have no more thoughts you don't never have no more problems you don't never have no more troubles you agree that you do all right then listen to see if you agree with this he lived that too that's right and even though he was almighty God the world and the things worked upon him the same as it works on you and I he oh no it didn't well then who was it when he was taken into the Temptation in the wilderness was Satan who was he that brother ROM would say he could be tempted he said even by women who is that could be tempted it certainly couldn't be the very God cuz my Bible said God cannot be tempted and that he tempts no man amen right see that body that's why he would be called a Son of God we see we look at the Son of God as a second person instead of looking at as Son of God as being God coming down did he send his son no he came himself amen amen but see that's just too simple for people they can make the great glorious thoughts and we just Oh Glory did you hear that well what about the truth is it the truth right amen well we just can't understand them things but this is what I think okay Glory but listen his life that he lived motivated him to the basis of who he was you agree he had to eat he had to sleep right he Gran with a headache when he raised who was it the little boy from the dead or something said he sat on a rock and grown with a headache that was that man and it don't matter how much you are born again the nature of that soul is gone yes but the rest of that being is still in a human element that's right and will be until the day the change comes that's right so the Plan of Redemption is not over yet it's going to take a connection to the son of man we even got there we got to go through the church ages now from where we're at we got to go through Son of God before we can come back the son of man but listen Church what about what this son of man plays in our Redemption we read this Sunday but I want to start back over on it so I go ahead with number one and let's just see what brother Brown said on the Revelation Chapter 2 I think what yeah 1961 Revelation chapter 5 right part number two 61 he said Jesus the name Jesus in The Gospel has four titles now remember he has three names Son of God Son of Man son of David but in the Bible he has many many titles Rose of Sharon lily of the valley bright and Morning Star so why would you have a prophet I mean have a problem with a prophet when he'd say there's four titles all right you're say Glory we know a little bit about it we found out something about another title that we didn't understand look at him said four titles of son did you know that Jesus has four titles as son in the gospel one of them is the son of David we know what that's for right where it goes one of them is the son of Abraham see that was his title he was the Seed of Abraham right he was before Abraham right but look one of them is a son of David one of them is the son of Abraham another was the son of man and another one son of God titles to his name now pull it on that where we because he talking about the Redeemer and how he come you read it as the son of David he's the air to the throne till he gets that in the Millennium he Jesus Christ not David the son of David sits on the throne in the Millennium not David it was promised to David to sit there but David's he's flat ain't going to walk up there and say boy bless God I'm here I'm I'm King he's going to know who it's really talking about well that's reserved for it ain't him look what he says as the son of Abraham he's there to the Royal Grant and what is the Royal Grant I'm glad he explains it he's an N to the Royal Grant Palestine and all that's in her Abraham's seed I thought we were the Seed of Abraham by faith am I right are we the Seed of Abraham by faith then the son would be relation to Abraham as you and I to have Palestine the say as anybody else come on look he was the son of Abraham I'm watching as a son of man what does son of man what did man lose watch it oh we lost this we loost come on just stay with him stay with me and don't run too far what does son of man what did man lose he lost the Earth right so as the son of man he's the heir to the earth I mean he's heir to everything in the Earth Earth all this he's got and he has to give it back to us so then who are we going to be we're going to be air to the Earth right well are we not related to son of man then [Music] oh there got to be some relationship to the son of man if we're going to be a come on I ain't the one that wrote it little brand you'll see them in a minute I got it in one of them he said that that sons of God was meant to be gods and the Earth is our rulership Heaven is for God the Earth is for man's rulership right come on going to give it back to us brother R said everything Adam lost Jesus Christ redeemed okay amen now evidently he hasn't given it all back to us yet right go outside and kick that dog that's over there at the neighbor you might find out you ain't back where you thought you back to right come on he has to give it back to us then he's returning back as he was oh then he's returning back as he was the son of man he's now then as the Son of God he inherits all things as a son of David he's our to the throne as son of Abraham he's our to the Royal gr as son of man he's our to the Earth as Son of God he's our to all things in heaven and in Earth so you can see we've got a way to go go we got to get to that and has got air of everything we just now dealing with air to the Earth in our Redemptive plan right watch him he's air of all things what did this son of man lose he lost the Earth well then the Earth's got to be redeemed right now just remember the Earth had a beginning and remember anything has a beginning it'll have an ending to it only that's eternal will be forever all right so then where are we what are we talking about Jesus himself had a beginning go ahead with number two Hebrews chapter 7 1957 and this male chesed was not Jesus then watching for he was God God and what who is God mzc right and what made Jesus and God different oh we're not trinitarians neither was he right what made him different see Jesus was the tabernacle that God dwelt in amen the flesh right see now mdic and watch it Jesus had both father and mother right now remember I've explained that to you before it wasn't a father and a mother like we think his father is almighty God the Creator his mother is the word not a woman amen Eve was not the mother of God right the word was the mother of God the word was the wound to bring forth the body well I don't get that well didn't pray about it cuz you tell me how I can be any other way Jesus had both father and mother and this man never had father or mother okay Jesus had a beginning of Life and he had an end of life what about who's he talking about well he talking about the second person that was over here you know the first person and the second see let's get away from our trinitarian ideas and let's get some thoughts Jesus had a beginning of Life and he had an end this man had no father no mother no beginning of days or end of life but it was the selfs same person who's mesic God Almighty in human flesh who's Jesus Christ God almighty in human flesh mzd is not his name his name is Jesus cuz that's the only name the father ever had was Jesus cuz he said I come my father's name okay watch MDC and Jesus was one but Jesus was the Earthly body born and fashioned after sin and say he was sinful now come on the Bible doesn't say that he knew no sin became sin what sin my sin come on right watching God's own body his own son born and fashioned after sin look to take the sting out of death to pay the ransom and to receive Sons and Daughters unto himself you get it that's the reason he had he had a beginning he had an ending why so he could die take the sting of death pay the price the body right then his body was made Eternal in the resurrection right right amen all right and here's one in communion go ahead and 28 we'll just read these down and all see these I had Sunday so I reading I put a 2A and a 3A and I'm that the other okay communion 1965 I it was sah no it was Joseph listen the other night said to me said me and brother Perry said daddy where when did God come on the S where did he come from see he had to have a beginning didn't he didn't he have to start and a little boy watch you I said no I just a little boy asked him question anything that has a beginning has an end but it's that which had not a beginning has no end but of course he's 10 years old he said that's a pretty good mouth he's asking questions right but he explaining it why anything that has a beginning has an ending so his body had a beginning his body was not Eternal it was made Eternal in the Resurrection The Chain ascensions now his body's Eternal amen right all right because that is the body of God because it's the blood of God right that's why man had nothing to do with it now watch him as he gets over here we've been through this before but I want you to see it go ahead to number three taking for the future home you talking about when he come out out of the water I saw the heaven open the prophet saw it he saw the heavens open and then here come descending Out of Heaven a form of a dove and a voice saying now we know the voice of saying this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleasing to dwell right but what did that voice say now if you make this anything contrary to the Bible you're out but if he's explaining what the Bible is saying we're in now that's to me is the between the lines which not meaning something written in between the lines we need something secret to be able to find it it's something written that we need to have the Holy Spirit to interpret that to us as to see the in between are you with me watching Prophet saw it and a voice saying this is my part of the earth and remember this is River Jordan that I have redeemed and from this part of the Earth I'll redeem the rest of it my part of the earth that I've redeemed right now watch him as we get on later where he talks about even the city coming down the different night but just remember it don't change what's taking place this this is my this is my part of the earth that I have redeem from this part of the earth I'll redeem the rest of it for he is my word made manifest that's John 1:14 right and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us right look what he says I spoke it into existence by my word what his body now we'll get to it in a minute the world was spoken into existence by the word right we're dealing with the body watch I spoke it didn't existence by my word he Satan has held the not the body of Jesus Satan's held the world right all this time I come to redeem it so much of it has made his body and I'm coming to dwell in it and what about God explaining something so wonderful through a prophet that we don't have to wonder what that meant we don't have to try to comprehend what that meant we can read what it meant it meant that there was a human sacrifice a human body a body created by God himself Hebrews 10:5 a body th has prepared me and that body would be our savior Our Redeemer all the things and he would come and live in that body to pay the price so that he could be released from that body to be the Redeemer now watch in a minute what happened to him there something happened to him on the River Jordan that is wonderful look John said I saw the holy city new to Jerusalem sending out of heaven born John he goes over to patmas to pick up the scripture but he's talking about Jesus on Jordan right patmas you know coming down out of Heaven 21 or what it is and he's putting it right into the River Jordan John talked about the city descending Out of Heaven as a bride ofor and where did it settle on just exactly like it did on D upon the Earth it settled on the redeemed Earth there but where did it settle that back there that's right on Jesus Christ the redeemed Earth and so John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem Jesus was part of that Earth that the Holy Ghost descended upon and he's got just to explaining the city no Holy Ghost the River Jordan is that right and remain upon him forever now watch this one where they said they left him in the I don't know it never can leave him it's always there he and God are one always has to remind he said but I just caught you because you were talking about that the anointing left Jesus in the garden you've always preached that to it amen and I still do the anointing is what left you not the life of God he's talking about the life of God that's right the Holy Spirit came on him that Holy Spirit left him on Calvary amen not in the garden it was the anointing for Ministry left him in the garden we've been through that cuz that's promised to come back in the end time there isy son of man if you get it look he and God are one always has to remind so John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem descending on a like a or a dove coming down out of Heaven settling setting Upon A redeemed Earth redeemed entire Earth to do what to claim every attribute he made the Earth far he's still on the River Jordan that's right every man that was represented in eternity every woman is redeemed in she has been scared didn't burn out by the fiery Temptation bring it up think of it the Holy Ghost descending upon Earth Jesus and that Holy Blood now watch and I hope you don't don't go too deep for you see the Holy Blood that was created by God the blood the life the creation of God Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God amen the one standing on Jordan right oh you see God made in creation he was Spirit the Bible said he's the beginning of the creation of God how did he begin back in Genesis where this began to no no that ain't th that's got its own story where did he begin in the wombs of a woman which is what the woman is not the the beginning of the creation of God started in the wound of a woman I've explained to you what I think he said he said wounds if you'll go to spoken words read no seed you'll find out that Eve had a virgin mind and a virgin wound there's your two wounds virgin mind wouldn't have brought it virgin wound wouldn't have brought it yet have them together so maybe he knew he what he was talking about Mary I said okay but Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God but Jesus had to die that's right I told them to hold their notes back there cuz I didn't know which way I'm going I'm going to go which way I want to go and then we'll get back to the rest of what about this man that we call Jesus this body we call Jesus that had a beginning with the wound of a mother and it had an ending when it ended on Earth hanging on Calvary and the life went out of it right so he had a beginning he had an ending he was almighty God in flesh the flesh was a creation the beginning of the creation of God now you know we've been through it I Y got it in here come on you know it he's the beginning of creation we're the continuation of the creation so come on that's where we got to get down to where we're at to get to the Sea and the point but I want you to see something here before we go any further and if we have two willion right here what about this one that walked the shores of Galilee that they would even say never a man spake like this man you remember that in the scripture never a man spake like this man why because there was never a man like that that's why the Bible calls him the only begotten the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the only begotten amen of God he had a beginning because he started in the wound of a mergin that God created egg and sperm he was just an incubator to bring forth that's why he didn't call her mother he didn't call her woman I mean he called her woman he didn't call her mother now don't be silly I've always thought people I'm just I don't like to be this way but that's the way I am and you you mean he was a little bit baby he run around war war war now he' have probably got knocked across the room you don't like that kind of language for me but you tell me something else he called her mother but when he entered his ministry she come up to that point she had already even rejected him by saying your father and I he said I got be about my father's business he called her mother come on but when he entered the point of understanding he called a woman when he knew where he come from and what he was doing he called her woman my mother goes it was no longer a mother you see he had a beginning of Life a time that he again he the body the man the man Christ Jesus the only body that God ever had that's what I've tried my best to preach it to you for 40 50 years now you say yeah but you make God this too much like a man my Bible says he was a man my Bible says Hebrews 7:4 I think it is it says m was a man if he built a man in Genesis 1 in the order of him in a spiritual creation would not the physical creation be in the order of who he was and what he was come on he said but you you just you just make him too too tangible you mean he created you and you can think about how tangible something is like this and think it's more tangible than he is remember this come by the word of God he created it so he's got to be more tangible what I've always tried to preach the godhead for people to try to get you to understand to see the one true and living God and see what it means and what he does God came down in a human flesh he didn't send a son he stepped down himself right that was the very soul of almighty God that was inside of that flesh and the Very Spirit of almighty God was inside of there now he didn't just have a spirit and then the spirit of God in him no he was the spirit you say but but but if he was the spirit he wouldn't be tempted you CL claim to have the Holy Spirit how can you be tempted solves a problem you see we think we're so smart but what about him Jesus had a beginning he was the beginning of the creation of God no no Adam was there's where you missing it it's not least of Adam that he's the beginning of the creation of God it's listed of Adam he's the beginning of the creation of the human race right he was the first son by creation Jesus was almighty God by begotten that's what I've always tried to get you to see look at it correctly here's a body the Soul and Spirit of God God steps into that body he's Son of God Son of Man son of David Son of Abraham bright and Morning Star alpha and omega beginning end Rose of Shar and Lily of the Valley he's the all in all but he changed dispensations to make a way go remember now I cut this part out I'll bring it back back in another message of how Adam was because Adam was God's first created son and he created Him special I won't try to go that way tonight we'll go Sunday onto that cuz come on I ain't the one that said it brother Randon says it Blasphemous names that Adam had eternal life and you argue with brother brandom do what you want to that's out on the Internet or anywhere he's the one that said it go to blasphemian names and get he said especially into Adam he said he made him an eternal person well then I I guess that's right we all come with eternal life no the fall put us in a problem but Adam fail we'll have to get to that later this is the point I want tonight just to get it to where we'll think about it what about this one it had a beginning began in the wound of a mother brought a body forth he had an ending hanging on a tree and the life left out of the body that body was dead it wasn't just something playing around he's waiting for three days hiding something and he was dead amen which dead means there's no life right he's dead the Soul and Spirit came out of the body the soul went to hell to preach to the spirits in prison come back up by paradise and picked up the Old Testament Saints the spirit went back to God who gave it he come and picked up those Old Testament saints that stood on Earth in a body sure I know what he said he said Mary don't touch me cuz I'm not yet ascended it wasn't complete but then about 2 minutes later he went up and come back right you could handle him do what all you wanted to and it was a glorified body amen an immortal Eternal glorified body right yet he could eat right no problems with that they shouldn't be CU that's been the Bible World know that in the Baptist you say that's a disgrace to us loow you're a disgrace thank you you ought to be because you ought to listen back then we studied these things we we believed in in that but we just couldn't get it straightened out how many persons we had that's it right there no we couldn't I told you over and over you go to the Baptist Church and ask them what's your Doctrine we believe in one true and living God God you say explain it well it's got in three persons that's all they do because he don't know how to explain it but listen he was the beginning of the creation of God and he had to make a way that you and I could become the children of God don't brother around said he's the beginning of the cre we the continuation of that creation right what is it is it God in human flesh is any problem is any problem with you thinking about yourself in a born again experience that that God is living in your soul and that you are an amateur God Amen and lost your right in the garden to ruling the Earth but at least you ought to have the rulership of the Soul but remember what your Prophet said if he's the beginning of the creation of God with a continuation so there's got to be a made way made one day that we can come back Body Spirit and soul Eternal but we're not finishing the plan until then but this is what I want I let you go early just for this I hope I will I said that but go ahead to number 3A and let's just read something that your Prophet had to say about this man and what happened to this man we find that he was our kinsman redeemer and he took the book out of the hand of the original owner it is a title deed to Redemption we found that you remember the study it's a title deed to Redemption it's an abstract deed with it that God required life for death in the Garden of Eden was death is our he required life to come and give it then Jesus the righteous one died and took a title deed and was able to break the seals reveal what was in them and give the inheritance that belongs to him to his people now read the rest of that eternal life that he inherited by doing that by doing what that he could give the inheritance remember your Prophet said what he said Jesus never gave me an inheritance he said my inheritance was eternal life before the foundation of the world but said he come to make a way that had inheritance could come to me that's right Jesus made a way that the inheritance could come but that wouldn't just what happened this is a story go look what happened and give the inheritance that belong to him to his people eternal life that he inherited by doing that right now who inherited eternal life boy that's the reason you can't explain this message to anybody that trinitarianism or anybody remember his body was made Eternal in the resurrection amen so he did inherit eternal life but how to come it come because of doing what he done by doing what he done he gave his life right right and by the re W for him giving his life God gave him eternal life and the Resurrection come on he passed his own life back out at Calvary and divided it Among Us by the Holy Ghost see all you could get at Calvary was the Holy Ghost to come back right come on his body was redeemed right there on on River Jordan and he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell he was redeemed right there but three and A2 years later before it was ever made manifest or it could be brought into manifestation or expressed right you realize then the day you received the new birth your body was redeemed amen but it's just not made manifest yet I thought we believe the Bible those who Justified if already glorified I thought we believe the Bible sure that's what he's saying but that's that's where we ought to get around to something that we can start saying one we were talking about on the proving his word is where he says talk about that this is the beginning of the creation of God this is the the he's the beginning of creation god with this creation but look what it says said the Holy Ghost come down at the fire baptism and claim this creation talking about go ahead and pull that one up pull number for I'm sorry I said I didn't know get started on something I can't quit no you go home early if you want to I'll see you later Happy Thanksgiving I'm not upset when nobody I just preach you just do whatever you're LED of God to do I'm just trying to preach preach the truth see you go through water baptism then Holy Ghost baptism then the Holy Ghost comes down at the fire baptism and claims his creation the Holy Ghost comes down into the fiery baptism and claims this creation oh that's just a soul if he claims a soul that takes care of the body if you claim the body you got to deal with the soul find out what's going to take place but if you deal with a soul you come on look the same as it did him through the fiery baptism came down on him on the River Jordan and redeemed his body claimed it when you receive the new birth your body is claimed cuz if not folks you're going to have to get you another one amen now you see where the people of the messages went with it and all all organized religion basically believes you're going to get a new body they don't believe in Redemption look come through water baptism then Holy Ghost baptism then the Holy Ghost comes down at the fire baptism and claims his creation you say but that's the headstone I'm glad you said that cuz you just trapped yourself because there is to be a fiery baptism but if we ain't build up to th it ain't going to land on us all right see you trap Yourself by your own thoughts you ought to listen sometimes it didn't think later that didn't work too good the same as it did him claims this creation the same as it did him what happened to River Jordan claimed his body right three and a half years later or something to that degree he comes to a change so what are we worried about if we got 70 something years what are you worried what you wor sister C in 90 years why it make no difference the day you receive the new birth he claimed your body that's right it's just waiting to be made manifest his was waiting three and a half years of horrible time look the Holy Ghost and God is the self is the same spirit and it comes down and claims this body for the resurrection Holy Spirit comes on you as a new birth claims his body see then he's the beginning of the creation of God and with the rest of that creation okay let me get one more I wanted these two to come together read number five CU this is what I was trying to express to you the other day Christ a Myst of God I'm going to lay them down cuz I ain't going in the rest of there okay but what he wanted to do he L fatherhood he loved fatherhood or he was a father and the only way that he could express it bring it forth into manifestation right was to become a son of man that's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man why because he was expressing a father he didn't know what he was talking about but now you get it congregation holler amen he wanted to express himself that was his one of his great attributes and that to identify in human beings but think about it now what you remember I tried to hear a while back to preach on it a little what in the world is brother around talking about that the only way he could express the fact of him being father was to be the son of man he the only way he could be father the way he wanted to be father Adam was a wonderful creation but not Eternal except in his soul then when that was lost mankind we'll pick this up Sunday when that was lost mankind comes all lost no eternal life and soul until the new birth am see he wanted a special creation he was the beginning of the creation if he was the beginning of the creation you know what that means do you know what it means when you say he's the beginning of the creation that means they got to be the rest of the creation somewhere are you saying it wrong it would say he's the creation Now when he said he's the beginning of the creation and that's Revelations what 3:14 isn't it what about a bride what about it folks you said well how did the son of man do this I thought we read the scripture that the son of man was the Ser of the seed and he sold the children of the Kingdom amen that's right which was his word you see where he started his family come on now you're going to be upset and follow it along if you won't get it see in the Old Testament was never the creation that God wanted it was never his intentions for those to happen that way he had to do it on the basis of allowing it to be done to bring forth the problems and the things but that was not his way of wanting to be father he was father by creating Adam right you know that everybody in the world today by God's creation is a Son of God right tell me who we're sons of what if it ain't him bringing us life everybody in the world adol Hitler you want to call it is a Son of God by natural creation because God is the only one that can bring a creation Satan can't create so all of that Old Testament as great as those people were as great as could happen still there was not what God wanted God wanted a family like himself so he just made sure you remember the quotes we gave the other night where brother rown said he didn't trust his Plan of Salvation with nobody else you remember that now ain't that something if there was trinitarianism somebody ought have got offended on that because if he didn't trust it with them you know that means they're not as equal as he is and then your Baptist will be out because they call them father son Holy Ghost co-equal and co-eternal so if you're co-equal everybody's supposed to know the whole story but if you don't know the whole story you've missed the problem you see where our trinitarianism is gone or should be gone he started a family right there he was the head of that family he was the one I've got him laying here in front of me but it take too long what about him speaking you into existence I just want to say this and we'll come back to it Sunday what about him speaking sister Gil you into existence now what's he talking about well Mom and Daddy brought you and that's not exactly what he's talking about speaking you into existence because we're going to go back where he said it like this brother R said he spoke you into existence before the foundation of the world poke you into being come on read the parable the parable is what the son of man is the S of the seed right the seed is the children of the Kingdom the other seed is the children of Satan right he brought them into being the biggest problem was that's where you and I was all at we was all in that cat category of what he brought into being not that he could create us and bring us in now God created he perverted us perverted us and made us to work but the beginning of the creation of God was the Lord Jesus Christ if you and I are any part of that creation and that's the Revelation to the seventh Church age is that he's the beginning of the creation of God and if we're the rest of that creation as he just said proven his word and truly he spoke us into existence cuz come on he spoke him into existence right right God spoke Jesus Christ into or Jesus as we'll call it the flesh to be holding it right CU you get Christ and it goes off he spoke Jesus in the beginning in in his own mind and then when he come into the world he spoke him right said Mary he said the holy spirit will overshadow you he spoke him into being now something's got to happen to finish the rest of the story because the rest of the story is that we've got to wind up in this story of redemption to have what the Bible said a body like unto his exactly right glorious body amen so we better be thinking about why a prophet would have to come and emphasize so much about people speaking the word and the Bible would not say brother Brandon would not say William brandom and Lord Jesus was the only one that could say unto this mountain it even covers it listen you listen to brother rown it even covers that to whosoever what about it Church come on these s what about it he's the beginning of the creation of God you're and I are the rest of that creation listen he was what God wanted ever son Adam was only an example of what he wanted he was ruler of the earth controller he was God of the earth he was all the things but he lost that position but Jesus Christ redeemed that position to bring it back to every son and daughter of God and come forth and speak the word amen I thought the emphasis of this message was the prophet trying to get the people to speak the word if you say but see we've got it if he said it I'd believe it why don't you believe that come on you trap yourself see you say if brother Brown said it I believe everything he said that's exactly like the children of Israel when they said God you tell us what to do and we'll go do it they were Liars right to the teeth you said you call me a liar no God did do you put all the emphasis up the prophet up at gains were years ago certain brother I won't call his name because some sudden here was there probably was the old bar bar Cafe what is it what was that big bear the one you know going out we were sitting there and this brother had brought a message about prophets of course his message was that he was the chief White Eagle I knew exactly what he was saying he was saying that he was chief White Eagle Brothers found it out later matter of fact I can tell you where they were at when they found it out they were overseas they found out that that man was saying that but he kept saying and he kept making this statement and after a while it just something inside of me rung a bell I don't care what you believe man you're off you've missed it I don't agree with you but said you made a statement you know that brother randam said he just come to make way for the Eagles how would you like that quote what's your Prophet said did he come to make way for the Eagles I thought we were little eaglets that's right I thought we were little Messiah you know what I didn't go home feeling bad I went won't happy I thought Lord hey I don't believe what that man saying but he sure struck home of quote that there's going to be eaglets Little Messi before the Rapture comes into being stand for before it all finishes up it going to be little Messiah am now may I say it this way where you'll think remember what I asked you to Listen to I ask you to listen to Masterpiece and see how far your Prophet went on the Masterpiece and where he stopped and then I ask you to go to siede not air with a Shook and see that he picked up right where he left off on Masterpiece and brought the greatest Revelation that could ever be thought of about the seed of God go ahead brother what we got
