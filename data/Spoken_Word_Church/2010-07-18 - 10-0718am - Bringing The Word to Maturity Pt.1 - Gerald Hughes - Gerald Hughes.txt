marvelous it was probably i see that counted 139 here last night which was the largest amount i guess we've had in any of the meetings in this meeting here because we had to put out some seats to help everybody but we we appreciated it some of you you know the regulars were here we would have had you probably sitting downstairs because it was pretty well tied upstairs but we we thank you but we had enough food to be able to feed everybody and it was wonderful and we also have now enough to feed you your lunch today all right so everybody feel free to go downstairs now do one thing for us don't

will close slowly behind you as you go out so you will not be able to make a racket you know a lot of people want to be noticed so they make rackets you know and things but uh that's all right it's fixed now you can't do it so we'll all be the same all right but we're glad to have everybody right now brother hughes we did we had a wonderful time last night you missed the service i invite you to listen to the tape and all he done a wonderful job preaching on fellowship because i believe in fellowship you know i believe in that because it's a wonderful thing the prophet of god said one time if your church don't believe in fellowship he said get away from that cult now that's a direct quote so i don't say a lot of things i just leave it alone all right but a lot of people don't want to fellowship that's your business but that's what your prophet said but we just pray that the lord would bless you and guide you and and direct you and everything that he has for us and we pray that god will now today come and open our hearts right amen so let's just sing only believe as our brother comes to bring the word of the lord unto us and he will be speaking this afternoon for us too so remember that oh oh all things are possible oh all jesus are possible jesus all things are possible jesus may we pray this morning heavenly father before we read your word and before that we're seated we're asking once again that you will help us we're so happy to be your children we're so happy to be gathered with those of like precious faith and lord we humbly come asking that you will just be the pastor the chief shepherd of our soul the bishop of our soul this morning and lord may you be the revealer may you be the one who would take the word and reveal it to our hearts the inside teacher this little sunday school lesson this morning oh lord we thank you for the services yesterday and and the different ones lord that were represented here and we pray for their services lord this morning the different pastors that were here that you'd bless them in a very special way not only them lord but your little bride around the world oh god it's a you said from every kindred nation tongue tribe language and people lord we believe you've got a number scattered out lord and now lord this morning as we're here we're asking that you will just uh help us the little church there in columbia lord swansea area lord you bless them as well as brother wright has the responsibility of speaking there uh this morning and then lord in our evening service brother salem from the congo may you bless them in a very special way as others come in to visit oh granted dear god we look to you now for this service this morning we're claiming it together by faith bless our pastor here lord bless the pastor's wife the first lady of this church sister peggy lord god continue to bring healing to her and father may you just uh bless brother wade and sister june lord in every uh part of the board of this church from the highest to the lowest lord right down to the janitor lord and the weakest member in this assembly lord we're one amen and lord we pray for that unity to be strengthened oh lord bless the tithe that binds our hearts in christian love we look to you now father bless the reading of your word we ask in jesus christ's name amen amen amen all right we'll just before you're seated if you'd like we'll just um read the same scripture we read yesterday because i want to background just a little bit before we go forward and we were in first john yesterday and uh first john chapter one and uh i believe we read the first seven verses so let's just do that again and brother canada was asking what i would title and i just kind of helped off a little bit but i believe that we want to speak along the line this morning of bringing the word to full maturity but i want to start here and just background a little bit from yesterday do we have anyone here today that wasn't here yesterday all right several good wonderful now uh saint john's not saint john the gospel the epistle the first first john verse 1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we've looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ these things right we unto you that your joy may be full god wants us to have fullness of joy this then is the message this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin unbelief goes amen god bless you if you'll reach over and shake your neighbor's hand i'll let you be seated uh we have uh god bless you may be seated we have uh well brother wade and brother dale's been over to our assembly and sometimes the people like to sit back quite a ways you know and uh the other day i said well if you'll i had them standing i said if you'll move up at least one or two seats i'll let you be seated so i i got them to move up a little closer before um i'm going to ask if sister hughes will sing for us right quick this morning i know i didn't ask her didn't even hint to her last night but we're going to i know i've surprised her by that and i surprised you all too but i i want her to come and sing she was singing this morning uh when i woke up and so i know she got a song on her heart and whatever the lord a little chorus or something huh she sings a lot of several different songs but whatever the lord puts on her heart will let her and uh get her mic'd up there by the way i appreciate it amen in my life was tested by some major trial when the temple when darkness tries to hide the sun from my pathway hear me love then a jesus special grace in times of trouble a very special place to heal all my heartaches now jesus wants to give that special grace to you i know that i was never ever worthy my sin demanded he punished but i know christ took my place upon his very special grace it's here just to see me through a very special grace to see you through just to heal all your heartaches now jesus wants to give that's amen hey thank you sister hughes i appreciate that again before we get in before i try to uh get into the message i would like to express again my appreciation for the invitation and the privilege of being here you know i believe it's a wonderful thing a great honor to be able to speak to god's bride and i often think of how the prophet said if i had just a little drop of the literal blood of the lord jesus in a vial how i'd hold it close you know to my heart lest when i walk i might spill it or something oh how sacred it would be to have a literal drop of the blood of jehovah you know he wasn't a jew or a gentile it was the created blood of god that we were redeemed by and he said but you know this morning i have something more precious in my hands the purchase of that blood how many have been purchased by the blood the lord that's more precious amen and then to have that in your hand brother to be a pastor of a church is a great and a sacred responsibility because you're entrusting your soul amen into the hands of those who handle the word of god and so therefore we don't take this lightly and we must realize each one of us as individuals that we are precious in the sight of the lord more precious than his own blood or he had never gave his blood for your redemption the transaction would have never been made if he didn't love you more amen than his own amen son his created blood he his life through his son oh my amen god made you pay for your sins when he put christ to sleep at calvary the first adam god had not yet separated the bride from the groom when god put the first adam to sleep and the same thing when he put the second adam's sleep we were in christ when he died you died come on all right amen living he loved me died he saved me buried he carried my sins far away why did he say my god my god why has that forsaken me it was your sins on him because in the book of hosea thou are all together too holy to even behold sin cursed is every man that hangeth on a tree he was cursed by your sins for my sake for your sakes living he loved me dying he saved me cat buried he carried my sins he had my sins he didn't have any of his son he had my sins and he carried them far away you know that's what they done the scapegoat the high priest confessed all the sins you know of the nation put it on that escape building and the prophet said he the lamb of god became a goat for you all right all that steak goat was a type of christ what a goat yes cursed a goat a scapegoat they they let they confess all the sin said turn him into the wilderness take him way out of no men's uncivilized you know in the wilderness and there let him die i don't know what happened to him there but i don't have to worry about what happened we know what happened to our sins there was absolutely an alley cast into the sea of god's forgetfulness never to be remembered hey hey look did you ever think about it god see living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins for a way rising he justified him rising he justified really forever and this day he's coming oh glorious day this day he's coming oh what a glorious day but do you realize did you ever stop to think god could not have resurrected jesus christ until he first justified you god could not have just resurrected jesus christ with those sins still on him see rising he justified right oh my amen glory think about it that's right god the father with his own faith the prophet put it like this god the father with his own faith foresee you and me out there and believing with his own faith now god's faith which he invites us to use see there's only one faith he foreseen us already glorified believing that we would hold to the message and be an overcomer and he already spoke it for all that he for dude he did also pre-dish things you believe you're almost 8 28 what about 29 and 30 then what about romans 28 29-30 oh all things work together for the good those who love the lord or they call the courtney's purpose we believe that but those whom he for knew he called those that he called see he did predestinate thank you those he predestined he called and he called him and he justified him and he had sanctified him and he has also glorified it's a it's a finished work folks it's a finished work but he wants us to believe in it and be sure that to make our calling and election sure appropriate these things that's right they stand on the word of god amen be an overcomer we want to hold our balance in predestination right exactly uh in the fourth seal the prophet spoke of how that when christ returns with his bride to set up the millennium you know there's three comings comes to redeem his bride comes to get his bride then he comes with his bride and the next coming is he's coming to get us and we're in that coming now is that right blessing the holy see they have part in the first resurrection out resurrection from among the dead the second death has no power or these rule and reign with christ a thousand years but we see then that we want to be counted worthy to be in that number and as we uh prepare for the coming of the lord we want to remember now we have to qualify right sure there are some qualifications there's some requirements to be made right the waiting garment's garbage gotta be on all right all right hey man there's some whoa if we are predestinating we believe we are sure but what are we predestined unto say predestinated to be conformed to the image of his dear son if there's not some transforming and conforming to that image what is that image the reveal word of the hour see and so there brother branham said in the fourth seal he said when christ is returning on a white horse and all those fallen with him on white horses the bible says with him are the call the chosen and the faithful all right amen brother brown put us up on this order you'll find it in the fourth seal he said see paul are chosen before the foundation of the world amen chosen you believe you're chosen amen see called by the word of god the gospel of your salvation i'll say by the message of the hour call thee and then here now see that was god's choosing you didn't choose him he chose you but then he says call see chosen call and faithful to the word by their own choosing right amen oh now there's where you got something into it there faithful to the word by their own choosing right see brother said if god was to grab you in a pipe poke you in and then reach in and pull you out the other end and say blessed is the overcomer you wouldn't have nothing to do into it but you've got to choose to be faithful to this world he is looking for a faithful bride he's looking for a mature right all right that's right thank you lord and um i want to background just a little bit now from yesterday before we go into this subject this morning of bringing the word to full maturity in our lives you know when you receive the holy ghost it's kind of like christ in baby form in you amen amen but you know song of solomon i believe one said there in the scriptures we have a little sister yes and what shall we do in the day that she's spoken for for she has no breast see we must bring this word to full maturity and when it comes to that place it'll be what you're seeing right here the stature of a perfect man and it'll be no longer she it'll be he she and he is one of them he who now letteth will let thee until he be taken out of the way amen and that's one scripture where the prophet of god identified the church not just in in feminine but in masculine he shall be taken out of the way the only thing that's keeping the judgments from striking and the tribulation from really fully setting you now we're in a little lap over now as it were preparation you know but when the tribulation really sets in what really does that is when the bride's taken out of the way hey do you realize you're the restraining force right that holds this whole thing together see and so we want to see the importance of letting the word come to full maturity now and we believe that fellowship is very much an element in that and uh yesterday my subject was fellowshipping onto relationships fellowship onto relationship and uh i didn't have time or it didn't take the time that uh nobody's pulling my coattail but i just didn't feel like you know to linger yesterday but i want to go back and hit a couple highlights that i missed in my notes and uh one of them here is uh that had come to my heart that i wanted to share with you uh comes from the second coming of the lord where the prophet of god makes this statement when he's talking about the little woman that had lost one of the coins out of her tablet you know that was her sign that she was married and was faithful and uh here in this message second coming of the lord he says this now she had a house cleaning time right she scrubbed the floors she swept the walls she took down the cobwebs what was it see i was i was headed here and then then i got off on that cobweb story moe's and the cobwebs and it may be just a little too light and i but i want to come back and get this she took down the cobwebs she kept on until she fell what she had lost now he's talking about the bride of christ having lost something we've lost something folks right right amen amen amen down through the ages the church has lost something right exactly all right she found what she lost and when she did she called her sister churches to come now right come on in let's fellowship i want to show you what i found oh my god she was in a she was in a strength her husband was coming it was the coming of the lord he was coming home and if he caught her in that position with one of the coins missing white be like a harlot right but now she invites her sister churches to come down okay but lay some strong meat now listen to this i don't care if you're methodist baptist pentecostal presbyterian come let us rejoice together right when that time come when the church finds its holy love a brotherly love when the church finds its holy decency when the church finds its place in christ it'll call the other members of the body come and rejoice with us see the importance of fellowship amen there must be see that was the whole purpose of god in the message discerning of spirits he said that if a man has the spirit of god he'll have the action of god and the action of god is never to break us up but the action of god is always to bring us together amen sure amen and we see here he also makes this statement if you're a christian you long to go where other christians are and fellowship with other christians so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life amen you you can't do it right because it's like i i'm hungry but i never go to the table yeah all right yeah come on i i just i'll never eat i just ain't going to do it see you've got to go and feed on the word of god and fellowship with one another may not feel like you need me especially when i get done with you this morning but i need you i really do see i know i i i really need you i mean that now i don't i'm not trying to say that but i need and we need good godly brotherly fellowship and support listen to what he says here we need one another more now than we ever need each other is now right when you get yourself singled out from the rest of them making yourself just a little different i've done it right now i'm tempted i've been tempted i've i've been guilty hey you don't want to associate with them because they believe this don't want to associate with that you're getting on dangerous grounds that's right brother amen i've been on thin ice before and i fell through before you know what you're on dangerous ground and those aren't mountains of arkansas i was raised up jerked up with the hair of the head they say you know and uh we didn't have electricity we had that kind of water that you run out and draw you know the well or run down to the river and take a bath raised on the banks of war eagle river there is one of the fastest fallen rivers in the ozark mountains and we didn't discover electricity in 1957 i was 11 years old at that time and uh but we escaped sometimes in the wintertime the you know the the river wouldn't be running and just have pools in it like you know it wouldn't be running too much just over the shoals and and it would freeze up and it'd be a good place to go down and have fun on the ice you know but you better watch that thin ice you better watch some dangerous spots you hear that crickety creaky crack you better get you better watch your step you know what i'm saying you're old you're getting on dangerous ground right then keep away from church see come on find the one of your choice and remain there and be a christian brother to all of them a-l-l all of them thank you that's the way to be a real oh that's too simple brother brandon that's the way to be a real christian amen be a brethren all of right is that right sure he's not talking about compromising right right no he's talking about brotherly love brother branham how can you go out when he's preaching this message right here that's right and he got to brotherly kindness they he asked himself the question that they've asked him how can you go out and associate with them people like you do those oneness and those trinitarians and and you know the people that don't even believe like you and things like that he said well he said it's brotherly kindness amen trusting that someday they will see the truth you understand what i'm saying brotherly kindness trusting that someday they'll they'll see it you know brotherly love putting up with one another sure all right notice what he says it right then keep it away from church see you fi find one of your choice and remain there and be a christian brother to all of them that's the way to be a real christian then you've got fellowship protection amen people love you and pray for you do we realize the value of a home church i'm going to be getting on something here in the morning if you'll stay with me i got something a lot of hail my fork right there if you'll just pull we got some real sheep food here this morning and i've i've ventured to say something you even heard put in those words before i'm not trying to bring something new now listen you know it's got to be a word in season that's never been in season before if it's a word in season then it's a word that's never been in season before not a different word but something that god wants for us this morning right right oh my listen now see that's the success of my meetings is because real godly people pray for me that's it that's the reason success in my meetings when i come in and introduce these things about the visions and things there's many old mother and dad sister or brother sitting out there that believe that with all their heart the holy spirit drops down on them then and uh if they didn't do that i have no way of doing it no matter how great it would be for myself it had to be for you the same we have to do a unit two of us together to make the contact with god you as a believer myself as a believer all right now we're going to uh come back to something here in just a moment but let me uh i want to come back to mary here uh but before i just wanted to hit these few little points i missed yesterday now um i i asked the question you know what is your motive and objective for fellowshipping what's your motive and objective for being here this morning is it really to draw closer to the lord how many older brothers i don't know maybe some of the younger brothers too but you know it's hard for a man to scratch his own back especially when he gets stiff stoop shoulder like i am you know you you need somebody to scratch your back for you and i you know i hope my thank you brother so i said hon would you mind i got it it just got rid of it would you scratch that and uh my wife scratches my back for me sometimes you you think well what are you talking about that for well see two you can't scratch your own back you know not very good unless you get up against old oak tree with scrub bark or something you know really and you know sometimes if they just barely scratch for the deal it just makes it worse you know what i say scratch huh hey why would you say that brother hughes you don't sound very spiritual talking about scratching backs brother brown said a legalist will say bless god if you'll scratch my back i'll scratch your but a real crystal say well bless the lord brother i'll scratch your back whether you stretch scratch mine or not if you're back in this christian i'm going to scratch it now what's your attitude this morning i think what's your attitude i'll come fellowship to you brother dale it bless god you promise now and i won't you let me down you gotta come fellowship with me you gotta run all the way over to south carolina when we have a meeting what kind of deal would that be right see it's but see if you want to see it's a want-to situation right is that right right oh my it gets to where you it's not just putting up with one another you get where you can't do without one man right there you realize the importance of one another love and protection and prayer and that godly affections and bonds that's what we want right amen when a church finds his holy decency it's pretty love where's it at amen if you haven't got in your heart start sweeping get the broom out all right amen get the cobwebs out this angel restoration one of the first things we mentioned yesterday that the devil eat away from the church was those the bride tree come in the form of the locust destroyed the the leaves on the tree which represented fellowship brother but this ain't your restoration this is your restoration oh my yes and you know he said that we are leafs on the tree of life what leafs right leafs on the tree of life all right i'm the man you're the branches all right ain't that saint john 15 5 that's the bible what we're part of the tree of life right well let's say the message restoration of the bride tree the prophet of god said bride and groom one tree of life amen black husband and wife is one amen is that too strong for you go ahead true all right this is the truth all right god obama's god with us god in us amen oh it was incred god he poured into christ all's in christ he pours into the bride the church christ in bride form right amen that's the revelation bride and groom like husband and wife is one one tree of life see keep thine heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life see the thoughts of god the word of god in your heart right amen and then as a man think of these hearts so is he that's what you're going to express out see and you produce the fruits of the righteous is a tree of life right words of the righteousness and so the only way you can serve god or the only way i can serve god period is to receive god's servant exactly as god interprets the word to you through him and god has sent us a vindicated serpent amen and we just believe it that's just it we love it and we believe it is that right oh my yes absolute amen divine interpretation of the written word of god in this hour amen he didn't just say it but um now if you don't want a fellowship hey guess what and even if you do want a fellowship you might be headed for forced fellowship in alaska right because two or three different places where brother brown said they got a place already prepared up there suggested it pretty strongly anyway where they're going to take all these oddballs they don't believe just exactly like the world comes from churches how many like go to alaska yeah i mean it's already been there i have two i kind of like it up there but it might not be it's a good way to go you know have a little province i think you said for us well if they did that you know what it just it just get us together we sure have to fellowship then we probably need one another to stretch one another's back and keep one another warm oh yes god's working he's going to do this thing whether we think he is or not he didn't ask me about it he didn't ask you about it this bride is his workmanship created under good works right the bride groom creating himself a bride and she's going to have this character it's hard for you to kick against the pricks right you know a prick is what they for my understanding to go the ox with right you know get him i'll go over this way a sharp pointy stick and goad and if that lock kicked against it it just hurt that much worse and that's what paul was doing right but you know what i've surrendered his life to me that 17th fight that brother branham was in as a professional fighter yeah he said god if you let me get through this one i promise you i'll never fight again what was it god is a stronger fighter than any one of you all right he's able to surrender you to himself and he'll use your trials he'll use the circumstances he'll use the battles whatever it is oh you'll use afflictions many are the afflictions of the righteousness not just because you're seeing that they come upon you necessarily but he's molding character right salvation is a gift character is a victory no battle no entry greater than battle greater than victory right now but we must have fellowship is that true return in jubilee 62 brother man makes mistake but if you sold your inheritance and you if you sold out and done these things what am i saying return back if you joined up with some cult cult if you joined up with some cult that tries to keep you away from fellowship with other brethren leave the thing this is jubilee amen i feel religious return return this is you believe don't let it pass by remember don't let it pass by the prophet's definition of a cult is an attitude or a church that keeps you from fellowship with other brethren amen ye are the salt of the earth whose purpose is steady for joy and good fellowship you always are ready amen that's the attitude of the bride is that true sure i'm sure we don't want to have to be a forced thing desperation should be out of love not out of just an emergency amen but god's going to bring it one way or another i was thinking i'm going to get back into this here after a while murray and uh elizabeth were white cousins talk about a fellowship meeting they had a fellowship meet lasted three months yeah right yeah luke 157 or 56 we'll read it here in a minute but see uh i believe in fellowship meetings yes sir we don't want to now uh yes see like husband and wife are one and i i this one little point i missed yesterday i want to weave it in uh that way i'll you know brother brown preached a message one time on rest and we didn't get that one on tape but if you go back and check it it was probably about two or three hours long and you know where he preached to that in his bed chamber i was talking about you know the seven steps leading up from fellowship up to relationship you know maybe over here in the in the living room you have a little fellowship and in the kitchen you have a closer fellowship but in the bedroom amen that's where you have relationships and god wants a relationship not just a fellowship and i was thinking along this line you know and and the prophet said i my wife was asleep yeah she'd be a type of the bride is that true in the king's chamber and he called that the prophet's chamber also as well as the king's chamber seven steps uh in the pyramid leading up to exactly way up here in the top level there is where that bed chamber is that secret chamber right oh my right each age had a dip in the holy ghost but here the holy ghost himself comes right amen you know he said the fullness of the holy ghost right who is that that's the lord jesus christ elijah could not leave until he introduced the messiah that's right that's right right then he said i must decrease that he might increase that's it right there oh my see the reveal word is your husband you're shut in with him in a smear relationship in the invisible union right amen right oh my yes but see here's the prophet now in the prophet's chamber preaching a message not to the public brother dale justice bride alone this is not for everybody oh brother and you know what it was rest amen rest do you know faith itself perfect faith comes up here right you know what it's based on down here exactly it's based on forgiveness faith is based on forgiveness that's right amen forgiving one another fellowship with one another loving one another faith which worketh by love and so we see that he woke her up out of natural rest she was asleep he walked he said it was just burning on my heart i had to have somebody some release no he didn't just take notes he preached it he preached it right in his bed and she rose up she roused up he said she's pretty good congregation captive congregation amen she rose up and woke up and he preached right to her in the bed well talk about fellowship and relationship in the same man oh what about a comfortable position that peter preached to right in your face amen that's where the bride is in the secret chamber that's right shot in with god in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face gaining new power to run in life's race right oh i love to be shut in with yes god in the bride sealed in see shut in and and the whole thing is based on rest not in running but in resting not in trying but entrusting and it's not in wondering but in praying that we find the strength of the lord think about it rest see ruth deciding ruth working ruth resting hey ruth rewarded see amen so we see that it's rest entering into his rest entering into the true rest of god total rest total rest not worried about anything can't no more die than god can die already sealed in with you got the rapture inside you oh my married to the rapture earth amen oh my he is the resurrection and the life now the mercy seat is not a place or a thing as much as it is a person right the resurrection is not a place or a thing or a time as much as it is the person i am the resurrection then the rapture must be a person that's right and the rapture just can't take place he ain't going to leave his brother that's what he come for amen have we got that confidence here oh it just stirs my heart to think about it amen oh my well we're going to go now to our topic this morning and we've got a good 30 minutes 35 minutes to deal with this before before beans burn i i think the beans already cooked they had some leftovers yesterday kind of reminds me brother billy paul was telling about sister sarah praying at the table and they come up uh and brother branham said it's your turn to pray sarah and uh she said oh i prayed over this food yesterday he was eating leftovers but it's pretty good leftovers i'll tell you that oh my now let's go now if you'll just give me your undivided attention for a few more minutes let's go to uh luke let's go to luke and we'll begin here i won't require you unless you want to just change your position a little bit uh you know that'd be all right too but i won't require you to stand necessarily but let's begin here with uh chapter 1 and verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god into a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin a spouse to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favored of the lord uh the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus and he shall shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and his kingdom of his kingdom there shall be no end glory then said mary unto the angel how shall this be see i know no man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be borne of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age this is the sixth month with her right now remember elizabeth's already six months before mary goes to her all right i think the the uh it's about nine months is the is the span is that right with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the hands made of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her and murray arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste under the city of uh judah right now i want you to just skip over with me here to verse 56 and murray abode with her about three months and returned to her own house what about a fellowship meeting three month long fellowship meeting and did you ever stop thinking about it here is well maybe we'll just go to it i'll share with you here what the prophet of god said about about mary and elizabeth listen to this now and we're going to come to something how would you mothers that are here this morning or even the young sisters that maybe you know mary was only about 16 or 18 years old at this time how would you like to have that responsibility of conceiving the word nursing the word and bringing that word up in the full maturity in the fear and admonition of the lord how would you men here like to have been jumped who have that responsibility of receiving the word teaching and tutoring and bringing that word to full maturity that's my subject in the little sunday school lesson this morning bringing the word to maturity in your life amen amen christ in you that's right for glory that's right whether we would like you or not and we should like it every believer would like that i'm sure but we have that same responsibility right not another jesus the same jesus not another spirit the same spirit right right oh my and we each one have that responsibility right that's right pergament church h church hmm chapter 5 here is the secret is this the word is in the bride as it was in mary amen amen he is in the bride amen exactly as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word right she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted in water it comes to full harvest serving its purpose now what a sacred responsibility then we find that we have too much is given much is required you'll never hear this message and be the same come on right that's right you don't want to be the same is that right you want to grow in maturity and in the grace and the and the knowledge of the lord jesus amen truth you want him to become all in all right i remember seeing some kind of an old horror movie where that somebody from another planet come and they planted seeds you know and then that seed would be planted in your closet or something then it would take over your being and then you would die and that seed would live and they'd take over the planet like that well that was just a figment of somebody's imagination but hey we got the word of god and you got to die so christ can live amen think about it amen until you die he can't live right that old nature has to die all right and then it's christ paul said it's no longer either living come on in the message how can i overcome lord lord mercy in john baptist time in john the baptist time he's talking about that particular generation right you know coming up before jesus you know john the baptist time john introduced jesus but in john the baptist time there was found six that had overcome all ages have had their overcomers now remember the promise is only to the overcomer even in the message to the lotus since he that overcometh right will i grant to sit with me in my throne amen even as i have overcome and i'm set down with my father in his domain throne dominion his dominion reaches from eternity to eternity that's right that's where we're promised to sit right with him now think about it overcomers that's right each age has had their overcomers six had overcome in john the baptist day uh all ages had overcomers in john's time they had six and that was joseph and mary zachariah elizabeth simeon and anne right right now think of all the thousands of people but only six all right that's right a man a woman man woman man or woman man woman type of christian church christian church christian church christian church see notes it starts from the natural man joseph the natural man what was he a carpenter then the priest what was he saying a minister in the house of the lord zacharias yeah right and from that to simeon a prophet and a prophetess right and then he goes on to say see justification baptism the holy ghost amen don't you see it perfectly six amen all the rest of them they offered their sacrifice and everything but these were the elected rights these were elected they overcome now as we study the life then um just for a few moments this morning of joseph and mary zachary and elizabeth and see me in an ann okay we might have to carry this into the evening service but we'll just take it so far and then we can come back and pick it up because there's a lot in here that's really really good i want you to notice particularly the life of mary since we're dealing with her coming and uh having first been given the word right and the responsibility of bringing that word to maturity right and again now she's a type of you amen right exactly they think that in your heart not believe that you see mary was the type of you the word is in you amen as it was in mary amen hey you got to put yourself in there okay now bless it look at mary she could have said bless god i've heard from the angel messenger of the hour he gave me a personal vindication and i believe his word free and i know that i am going to bring forth the messiah but you know what she had to do that's right that word would have corrupted in her womb amen she had been stoned right had she not come under the headship of her christ her christ for that name that's right oh what right murray a type of the church joseph a type of christ but by coming under the handship of joseph properly all right right and then following under that handshape i'm talking about the headship of the word amen glory i'm talking about proper headship in the church right by her being submissive right that's it brother wait you wouldn't be worth a plug nickel if you wasn't willing just obey what daddy said humble yourself to me that's what's greatness right right see just y'all don't see how big it can be see how little it can be see how humble you can be that's oh my and we wouldn't be worth the thing unless we could come under the handshape of christ right i better not ask for a show of hands but i i'll ask anyway don't lift up your hand you might offend your wife but how many of you brothers would like for your wives to be just a little bit more subjective under your headship yes a little more respectful a little bit more you know loving well you know i got the remedy i got the formula she's there you set an example by coming under your hands of christ to him and you'll create an atmosphere and she'll want to follow you you're gonna have such love and fellowship but oh my when you're having it with the lord and she'll just say i will parliament i want a father right along with that oh at his right hand in his presence is the fullness of joy in his right hand play that pleasure forevermore i want to be among those elected i want to be an overcomer don't you i want to see that word come to full maturity in my life she come under the headship of joseph and then joseph under the headship of the leadership of the lord right saved by taking the christ child down into egypt remember saved from herod so the word wouldn't be corrupted so the word could come to mature teeth right glory the word's still in the womb of mary at that point but well it had been birthed at that point i'm sorry uh and then just a young child a young babe and then took down into egypt to fulfill the scripture i called my son out of egypt see god's working all of this has to be his leading right see we can't figure it out we have to just follow the leadership of the holy spirit now let's just follow the life of mary we won't have time to go into all these details but we see then murray one time had this word seed in her yeah but then she gave birth to this word scene and she's holding it now in her arms right and then as that word begin to mature she had the word by her side and at the age of about 12 years of age she left the word right well wait a minute i thought you said she was the elect i just read it to you i thought you said joseph was elect he left the word too what's that tell me elected ones can leave the word yes you're right but they'll humble themselves and come back right do you know the elect can temporarily maybe be deceived a little bit get out of step a little bit come on bro oh the prophet seen the bride passionate review and some in the back was getting out of step she was the bride and he said get back to the staff get back and stuff don't you get so holy and righteous that you don't think you can miss a step or two we get this attitude blessed god i'm predestinated i heard the message for myself i don't need nobody to tell me anything all i have to do is turn on the tape i heard the angel myself right oh my that don't do weight the five-fold ministry that's right after the seals was open that didn't do with the five-fold ministry in fact question answers on the seals brother brown will the bride have a a a ministry before the before the coming of the lord before the rapture yeah well the bride haven't met twice of course you will he said it's going on right now and it consists of apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers but it'll be so humble the prophet also said see what i mean you've got to come under he said every individual ought to have a church home someplace where you go and support the cause pay your tithes and offerings and so forth and you call it your church right you need that fellowship glory amen take your choice choice a wonderful thing right he said if it's my choice i'd search out the best in the land but don't dis-fellowship the other fella then is that right treat them as brothers oh yes just because see you know some people would get the idea that people and i'll have to say i i've kind of you know been a little inclined that way myself in time past blessing bless god we think lest they come to our church they just can't be saved but the prophet himself said you don't have to come to the branham tabernacle to be saved and he was no hypocrite come on brother amen what he said he knew that there was a universal bride amen you get this attitude they got to come to europe oh come on something wrong somewhere we need to humble ourselves a little bit is that right amen oh lord help us now mary look at her she's type of the bride and she's bringing the word to maturity right okay oh i feel good all right i got 15 minutes if i can just stick with this thought you all just pull now okay look this way and pray you know what i mean give me your undivided attention help me preach this you know what preaching's like pulling two-man off right takes two to do it all right if the saw is sharp it'll cut it's not the third push it's the third pull right how many ever pulled the two man crosscut saw man oh got a few okay my older brothers would say don't ride that thing if you're gonna ride it get a side saddle you know if they start working me too hard too fast i just bear down on a little bit you know that slow them down a little bit he might be stronger than me but if i put no pressure on that right amen but don't sit down on me now don't try to ride just just pull them let it glide let me cut okay she left the word but she came back to the word right she denied the supernatural birth of the word like the pentecostals today malachi 4 according malachi 4 the full word that was to be birthed back into full manifestation again today as it was 2 000 years ago in full power and full manifestation you believe he's here but the pentecostals couldn't believe that they denied the supernatural birth of the word in our day like murray did in that day but the word corrected the era right right that's it and the word creek's here today no it's down i must be about my father's business not making cabinets in the carpenter shop right but having a minister's name yeah minister's meeting had been going on for about three days and three nights after three days they found him right where they left him correcting the denominational errors in those preachers that's the father's business the word will creek there sure both answering their questions and asking them questions right so we find out ministers meetings is scriptural right brother brown done it and he told us to do it right oh i don't like the way they they argue a little bit or fuss a little bit well they might argue and fuss in church but you still got to go to church i don't want to stir up with myself just so he'd have a little activity but see there he became subject to them even though there was an era he rose up and came subject to him and went with him even though she denied him right there all the grace of god the grace of god denied the supernatural birth word and god still reaching out and he became and grew then in stature and in the sight of god and man right in fact come in the word coming to maturity see how humility brings it to what if he had just said well you all going to act like this don't you know who i am he was beginning to see who he was jesus said that he had to find his place in the word of god amen come on brother bar mitzvah 12 years old see he was coming to maturity oh my see revelation breaking all right he's realizing he's the passover lamb at the feast of passover and they had left him but they came back and he went with them then that's right now look they bring that word to maturity coming on down and here then that word that she one time corrected is correcting her right amen right mama correct and and daddy correct and little jesus all along now amen hey he's having to correct them that's right right amen can you stand correct as many as i love that's a good sign of god's love to you if you get a little whipping what's the water man is i love all right oh i thank god for ever licking him i needed every one of them i ain't got time to talk about my old made school teacher boy i needed every one of them but see now watch mary now here she is following right on with the lord and trying to stay as close to him as he can but he's got a ministry he's got to fulfill and he's out here and he she and and her jesus had brothers or foster brothers however you won't say it they went down to visit the meeting come on and uh word come to jesus your mother and your bro who is my mother they that do the will of my father the same right now he wasn't denying her in any way but he's pulling her up a little closer soon come on amen making her realize you know what well i've got a ministry i've got a ministry to take care of here and so forth and and so then we see how that at the cross here was mary following him right up to the cross right that's the bride of christ murray type of the bride right to calvary here she was and john a type of the bride in every age the raptured church the bride john john the beloved also attack here he is at the cross right you got to go to calgary folks can't bypass calvary if there's no death there'll be no resurrection amen and so here they are and jesus the word speaking to them and said now son behold thy mother amen mother behold thy son pointing to john right his earthly headship was going to be removed and john's got to fulfill that handshape and his absence right so jesus had been under the handship of mary joseph had probably passed on at that time because you don't see him at the cross i believe he'd have been there because he was one of the elected but you know he was in his 40s whenever he married mary and by this time 50 60 70 maybe something like that you know in his 70s and we don't see him no more right but here's mary and john and jesus puts mary under the headship of john jesus taught headship and you know what mary done the bible says and she went to the home of john from then on stay with john exactly maybe she's a wit at that point i want you to watch the life of mary a little bit here at this point 33 and say 18 is what that's about how old she was some of you mathematicians tell me how old she was all right mary's probably about 50 years old let's say at calvary in her 50s all right now she's put under the perhaps a widow under the headship of an apostle which later become and manifested as a pastor i said john became a pastor in fact he pastored the greatest church in that day how many knows that glory sure mary under the headship of a pastor and you know where that pastor led her right to the upper room right and that word that one time had been in her womb that word that one time had been by her side right that word that nursed and raised up now has to be in her heart all right that's right same word he is now with you but shall be in you right see right john pastor john bringing her to the upper room getting her under the headship of the word getting the holy ghost to headship insider right nothing under the headship but the heads up in you and you're in the handshake that's right amen in there where we as brothers and sisters are in god's own godhead brother brown said that right what yeah in there if you're in there that's right part of god's own godhead amen he's now complete without every member that's right god's not complete without you right that's right is that true nobody can take your place now listen and the manifestation of his spirit cannot be manifested and without you being made manifest that's right the word must come to maturity and manifest that thought that he had if you in this generation you are that portion of the word god that's been allocated this generation and that word must come to full manifestation full maturity and manifestation see what i'm saying sons and daughters the family of god oh i'm so glad i'm first all the family are gone amen oh my look now watch mary then as she went to the upper room top of the bride see come and bring the word to maturity now the baptism the holy ghost you know what then we see her and we see her still under the headship of pastor john way over in ephesus right yeah it might have been driven out of jerusalem under persecution i don't know but here they we're scattering the word of god brother said that was exactly the will of god exactly right amen jerusalem judea and the uttermost and here john the you know brother brown said it's possible for a man to have more than one gift of these of these gifts of even the fivefold ministry gifts here is the disciple and apostle john who done the work of a missionary also by the way and here he is now over here doing a pastor's work and murray is subject with him still yet under the headship of the pastor all right and you know what they're doing over there they're compiling now look they're in jerusalem she was part of this bribery ministry see but by 50 a.d or 52 a.d that this bride tree say which was mostly jewish has starting to fall away but god brought paul on the scene amen right that first church angel messenger oh brother after my departure grievous will come in but when he was there brother he lined it out didn't he at first church angel messenger establishing the church at ephesus and here john went over there led by the spirit and pastored that church and mary lived by the spirit right there with him you know what this is doing that is compiling the gospels matthew mark luke and john and the epistles of paul and peter and james and there's put them in canon form in the bible they were compiling the word of god and that's exactly why john was banished to the owl of tecmus right right because the government didn't want it done in satan's eden he didn't lack that word of god being coming to maturity and being established see the maturing of the word amen oh it's beautiful beautiful now it was about 90. i've got the quote right here 90 a.d how was mary then when john was banished to alpacas that would have been uh at 33 she was in her 50s and now uh 60 years later is that right 33 to 93 would be 60 years mary's getting pretty old right how has she been approximately 93 if she was 53 now this is sunday school lesson it's okay we could put it on the board here but let's say now uh let's just give her give her the benefit out let's say she was 18. brother man said 16 or 18. let's just say she was 18 years old um whenever joseph and her got married before they got married now they were engaged and she was conceived see with the with the christ child in fact the first three months of her conception she wasn't even around joseph at all right for that first three months of her conception she was way over here with elizabeth having a fellowship meeting and you know what she had in her womb jesus amen and you know what lesbian had in her will another overcomer there was god in the prophet talked about a fellowship and they're hugging one another's neck oh my brother think about that now we're men and they were women but here is two women hugging and embracing one another and here's god is the prophet right here talking about the holy ghost talk about and you know as soon as murray come in and and gave her salutation she mentioned the name jesus and murray see the baby had been dead for about about six months right hadn't moved you know that's unusual any mother that knows that you've had children if that you don't have any movement sometimes my wife has felt the movement as early as three months but see here was john dead the prophet dead right really mentioned to murray but murray had never breathed it immediately as soon as she got the message she went to elizabeth and the first time she breathed it oh my speaking of the word of the name of the lord jesus and a dead baby come to life in the will of an overcomer my and and john was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb right then my think about it another three months is all she he had to be in there then see and about the time for elizabeth to deliver mary leaves yeah and when she gets back there she's three months along yeah maybe start the show a little bit right i don't know but joseph you know he want he won't know what's going on where you been is that right and god had revealed to him that it was a word coming to maturity are you willing to bear the reproach of letting the word come to maturity in you talk about a reproach for the word's sake that's right think about the reproach mary had bar uh uh better are you willing that's right moses see esteem the reproach of christ greater riches and all the treasures of egypt not the blessings of christ the reproach of christ blessed are you whenever man you're persecuting for righteousness amen amen amen oh my god see to have the privilege of bearing the reproach of this message be called a cult yeah be called whatever that they want to call you are you willing to bear the reproach are you afraid to testify that you're impregnated brother said the bride's already pregnanted amen the womb is sealed then once that woman is sealed no other seed can conceive right that's right amen you're eternally sealed with this this is the complete revelation of jesus christ this is the head this is the seal up here when he sees these virtues in there brother he seals the whole it's a finish worth it right right the word must come to maturity gotta bring it to maturity in your life so he can seal it in right oh my remember these virtues have to be in there before you conceal it man you're birthed into this burst into this birth of this see oh brother but god wants to seal you off and use you for his glory as an adopted son and daughter amen amen oh my it's 12 o'clock let's bow our hands lord jesus take these few words this morning that we fellowshipped in and let them be deep into our hearts grounded their lord and bring us lord to this maturity in our day we don't want to come short we remember how that paul said he who now led us brother ben said god christ the holy ghost will let until he the holy ghost the bride the church is taken out of the way oh my he is taken out of the way lord bring us to that
