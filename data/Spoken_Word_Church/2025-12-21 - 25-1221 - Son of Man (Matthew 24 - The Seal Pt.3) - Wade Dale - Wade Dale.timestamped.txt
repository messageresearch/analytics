[10:14] &gt;&gt; This morning, we're going to be reading
[10:15] from James 5 1-12.
[10:20] And um let's speak to the author before
[10:23] we
[10:25] go to the word.
[10:27] Ready?
[10:29] Fresh heavenly father, we thank you for
[10:31] this day and we ask you Lord to forgive
[10:32] us of our sins. Cleanse us, Lord, and
[10:35] have your way with us. Pour out that
[10:38] form and let her rain through us,
[10:39] Father, that we can manifest that which
[10:41] you have brought to us and laid on our
[10:43] table here at this end time, Father.
[10:46] And we ask, Father God, today that
[10:50] you just bless every ear that's here and
[10:53] every word that spoke come from you,
[10:55] Lord.
[10:57] And reveal it to us, Father. Open our
[10:59] eyes. Let us not be blinded by the
[11:02] things of the world or
[11:06] and Father, we ask now that you'd bless
[11:08] all of those that couldn't make it
[11:10] through the door today, Lord. Be with
[11:12] them and bless them, the ones at home
[11:13] and bless our family members still out
[11:16] in the world, Father, cuz we know your
[11:18] word. Your word said we'd be here with
[11:20] our offspring. And we believe that,
[11:21] Lord, this time of season, we ask you
[11:23] just to bless each one in a special way.
[11:27] bless our pastor, Lord, as he's
[11:29] preparing to bring the your meal to us
[11:31] today that you've placed upon his heart.
[11:34] And you just be with him, Lord, and come
[11:36] down and use that vessel and bless him,
[11:38] Father, as he speaks to us. And we ask
[11:41] now, Lord Jesus, that
[11:44] you bless the reading of the word and
[11:47] have your way with us. And we ask these
[11:49] things in your name, Lord Jesus Christ.
[11:52] Amen.
[11:54] Amen. Amen. as we go to the word.
[11:59] Went the wrong way. Sorry.
[12:06] The old Bible don't have the names in it
[12:10] anymore. So, here we go.
[12:14] [clears throat]
[12:15] John five, I mean James 5 1-12.
[12:19] Go to now you rich men. Weep and howl
[12:22] for your miseries that shall come upon
[12:26] you. Miseries, I'm sorry.
[12:34] &gt;&gt; Your gold and silver is cankered, and
[12:36] the rest of them shall be a witness
[12:39] against you, and shall eat your flesh as
[12:41] it were fire. Ye have heaped treasures
[12:45] together for the last days.
[13:03] Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth
[13:05] and been lon. Ye have nourished your
[13:08] hearts as in a day of slaughter.
[13:19] Be patient, therefore, brethren, until
[13:21] the coming of the Lord. Behold, the
[13:23] husband man waiteth for the precious
[13:25] fruit of the earth, and hath long
[13:27] patience for it until he receiveth the
[13:30] early and the latter reign.
[13:40] Grudge not one against another,
[13:42] brethren, lest you be condemned. Behold,
[13:45] the judge standeth before the door.
[13:49] [clears throat]
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Behold, we count them happy which
[14:00] endure.
[14:02] Ye have heard of the patience of Job and
[14:05] have seen the end of the Lord, that the
[14:07] Lord is very pitiful and of tender
[14:10] mercy.
[14:12] But of all things, my brethren, swear
[14:15] not, neither by heaven, neither by
[14:18] earth, neither by any other oath, but
[14:22] let your yay be yay, and your nay be
[14:25] nay, lest ye fall into condemnation.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you for the opening of the word.
[14:30] You may be seated.

[15:01] song this morning.

[20:47] years

[22:04] great joy.

[22:13] laid in a manger.
[22:15] But he comes to reside in you, take up
[22:18] residence inside you.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; I'll lead you and guide you.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you.
[22:27] I'll be with you,
[22:28] &gt;&gt; even in you, to the end of the world.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; We know that Jesus wasn't born in
[22:36] December.
[22:38] &gt;&gt; But you know what? That message still
[22:40] applies today.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; Every single day,
[22:44] &gt;&gt; we worship the God of heaven.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; He took on the form of sinful flesh
[22:53] that didn't know any sin.
[22:56] that I could become what he is
[22:59] &gt;&gt; today. I'm the righteousness of God
[23:01] because of his gift.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; And we're supposed to proclaim that to
[23:19] the to the world
[23:23] &gt;&gt; to show the world he still lives today.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[23:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Like brother said, don't let ever this
[23:34] message ever get common to you.

[23:43] many years ago, the Lord come by my way.
[23:47] It spoke to me.
[23:49] He brought me out of the miry clay.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[23:54] &gt;&gt; He delivered me from the things of my
[23:57] past.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm sorry. I just
[24:09] &gt;&gt; I think about that.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful gift.
[24:19] You know, we spend so much time talking
[24:21] about people buying gifts and
[24:22] everything. [snorts]
[24:25] The greatest gift on earth is free.
[24:28] [snorts]
[24:30] &gt;&gt; And you want the world to see that Jesus
[24:32] Christ

[30:52] Has been good so far. Um, I just wanted
[30:55] to piggyback on what brother Emanuel had
[30:58] read. He read 1 Chronicles 16. [music]
[31:01] You know, the glory and honor are in his
[31:04] presence and are in the King [music]
[31:06] James version in my Bible is italicized.
[31:09] So, it's put with emphasis. Strength and
[31:12] [music] gladness are in his place. And
[31:13] if we skip down to verse 9, you see,
[31:16] give unto [music] the Lord the glory
[31:17] that is due unto his name. Bring an
[31:20] offering and come before him. Worship
[31:23] the Lord in the beauty of holiness. So,
[31:26] we've come all [music] with an offering
[31:28] of praise, I would hope. And
[31:32] my goodness, [music] there's such a
[31:34] presence this morning and my hands are
[31:36] just shaking. All right,
[31:39] so this is a a very well-known [music]
[31:42] song.
[31:44] He brought me out of the miry clay.
[31:47] So I invite all of you to sing with me
[31:49] cuz we all know the song and [music]
[31:52] clap your hands and give him the praise.
[31:54] Okay.
[32:01] My heart was distressed with Jehovah's
[32:04] [music and singing]
[32:05] W. And in the pit where my sin dragged
[32:10] me [singing] down, I cried to the Lord
[32:14] from the [music] deep fiery clay who
[32:17] tenderly brought me out to golden day.
[32:22] He brought me out of the merry clay.
[32:27] [singing and music]
[32:28] He set my feet on the rock to say
[32:33] he puts [music] a song [singing] in my
[32:35] soul today.
[32:40] Hallelujah. [music]
[32:43] He placed me upon [singing] the stone
[32:46] rock by his side. My steps were
[32:50] established. Here I'm abide. No danger
[32:55] of falling. [singing]
[32:56] While here I remain but standing [music]
[33:01] until the crowd I [singing] gain. He
[33:05] brought me out of my mind.
[33:09] He sets my feet on the rock to sing.
[33:14] He puts a song [singing] in my soul
[33:17] [music] today. A song of praise.
[33:21] [singing] Hallelujah.
[33:24] [music] He gave me a song to a new song
[33:28] of praise by
[33:31] night.
[33:35] My heart's overflowing.
[33:37] I'm happy and free. I'll praise my
[33:41] [music] redeemer who has rescued me.
[33:45] I'll sing [singing] of his wonderful
[33:47] [music]
[33:49] to me. I'll sing [singing] of his.
[33:57] [music]
[34:03] [music] I like this verse. I'll sing of
[34:07] his wonderful mercy to me. I'll praise
[34:11] him till all men his goodness shall see.
[34:16] I'll sing [music] of salvation at home
[34:19] and abroad. Till many [singing] shall
[34:22] hear the truth and [music] trusting God.
[34:26] He brought me out of the mighty [music]
[34:30] way.
[34:32] He sets my feet on the rock till his
[34:35] day.
[34:37] He puts a song in my soul today. I
[34:43] pray. Hallelujah. [music]
[34:47] He brought me out of the mighty clay. He
[34:53] sets my feet on the road to stay.

[44:23] this morning.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Well, if you if you will indulge us this

[44:32] morning. We're going to allow him to
[44:33] come and sing. Bless us this morning.
[44:37] [applause]
[44:41] God bless you.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; Sorry I get a little nervous. Um,
[44:49] this song I'm about to sing this
[44:50] morning. Um,
[44:53] once I had finally gotten a grasp of on
[44:55] English, you know, with the vowels and
[44:57] all that consonants, uh, this was the
[44:59] first song I had sang for the church and
[45:01] was able to really articulate myself.
[45:03] So, um, I'm hoping that it reaches and
[45:06] touches y'all as it did me. Um, growing
[45:09] up, wasn't a very big kid. Strong, fast,
[45:12] yes, but the eye test I failed for a lot
[45:15] of people. So, you know, a lot of people
[45:18] thought they could come in, shake me up,
[45:20] you know, get in my mind, rattle me up,
[45:23] but I shall not be moved. Amen. So, I'm
[45:27] not sure what key really to call. So,
[45:29] just go.
[45:32] Jesus is my savior. I shall not be
[45:36] moved.
[45:38] In his love and favor, I shall not be
[45:42] moved. Just like a tree that's planted
[45:46] by the water.

[51:31] By way of a few announcements,
[51:34] remember there'll be no service this
[51:35] coming Wednesday be Christmas Eve and we
[51:38] will have uh uh no service then. Um
[51:42] happy holidays to all of you.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; On and off.
[51:51] Um remember brother Chris Long will be
[51:54] here next Sunday.
[51:56] Um watch night service coming up. These
[52:00] are all the announcements next not this
[52:02] coming Wednesday and next Wednesday at
[52:03] 8:00.
[52:05] Is it not switched?
[52:08] Um I want to give you a report from
[52:10] Jamaica. U brother Keith Reed. I know
[52:12] y'all heard that Mon'nique had a chatter
[52:16] appendix taken out.
[52:18] That's what exactly what I said. She had
[52:20] her appendix taken out.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; So, she's doing good and the Lord was
[52:24] good that [clears throat] she didn't
[52:26] have that attack in the air or have that
[52:28] attack somewhere else. She was at home
[52:29] with mommy and daddy. So, we uh we thank
[52:33] the Lord for that. But we have sent
[52:37] um according to reports
[52:41] um now this is accumulative of four
[52:44] churches uh brother Thomas Ber um
[52:49] brother Dut Scott, brother Isaac Negron
[52:53] and this church have sent approximately
[52:55] $26,000
[52:57] to Jamaica.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:00] [applause]
[53:04] And brother Keith sent me a report that
[53:07] they have bought the material
[53:09] for the two roofs to go to Northampton
[53:13] and to go on Ginger Hill. And that's
[53:16] about $14,000.
[53:19] So they've got that started. They've got
[53:21] the wood bought. Uh they still need to
[53:24] buy, I think, the uh the roofing
[53:26] material for for one more church. Excuse
[53:29] me.
[53:31] But that's $26,000
[53:33] that the four churches have sent over
[53:35] there besides what brother Joe Green got
[53:38] and besides what other people have sent
[53:40] them. But we wanted to make sure to send
[53:43] it to brother Keith so that the
[53:44] believers could have a um um you know
[53:48] benefit from it. Okay. Now, we did send
[53:50] a bunch of clothes and all that that
[53:52] y'all sent and put downstairs. We give
[53:54] it to brother Aaron and he took it to
[53:56] where he works and it's a division of
[53:58] Toyota and Toyota put it on a big boat
[54:02] and shipped it over there. But now that
[54:04] won't go to all the believers. That'll
[54:07] go to the whole people in the islands
[54:08] because we believe in helping humanity.
[54:11] We believe in helping our family first.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; But we believe that there is people
[54:15] there that were suffering that needed
[54:17] these things. So we we sent that out to
[54:20] them. So we sure do appreciate all of
[54:21] you for all the stuff you brought
[54:23] together. the funds and the food and the
[54:25] different things for us to send over
[54:27] there. And they said, "Thank you so very
[54:29] much." So, I'll give you another report
[54:32] when they finish or when they get almost
[54:34] finished with those two churches. Now, I
[54:37] don't know about the um uh the brother
[54:39] that lost his home there at Ginger Hill.
[54:42] I'll have to call and ask about that,
[54:44] but we pretty much the funds that we
[54:46] sent is probably going to be able to
[54:47] take care of most of that. The $26,000
[54:51] from just us are going to take care of
[54:53] that. So, it wasn't just from the
[54:54] church. It was the four churches. Uh,
[54:56] Brother Brad uh Powell from Brother
[54:59] Ber's church jumped on the bandwagon and
[55:01] they um took up money and took up money
[55:05] twice actually. And then Brother Dutch
[55:07] Scott wanted to put some money in.
[55:09] Brother Isaac Negro. So, they sent it to
[55:12] us and we sent it through um Wells Fargo
[55:15] because we're that's our account Wells
[55:17] Fargo. And we were able to send it
[55:19] instantly to brother Keith. Only cost
[55:21] like $25, right Jim?
[55:23] to send the money over there. So, we did
[55:26] that, got that sent over there and and
[55:28] we'll get a report from them and if they
[55:29] need any more, we'll talk about it later
[55:31] later. But, but as of right now, I think
[55:33] that's enough for them to get started
[55:35] with. And like I say again, appreciate
[55:37] all of you having a part in it. So, and
[55:41] we sure appreciate all the gifts and the
[55:43] and the stuff that the last couple weeks
[55:46] and thank you so very much. And we
[55:48] appreciate the gift of eternal life more
[55:50] than anything. Amen.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've um I've been asked by two
[55:55] separate people about having Bible study
[55:59] again. So, I want to kind of put it
[56:01] before you this coming year. Uh maybe
[56:04] having it like once every two months. U
[56:07] we'll talk about it. Maybe we'll discuss
[56:09] it in January once all the holidays are
[56:11] over and brother Joe and him's going to
[56:13] be gone. brother Luis and them's going
[56:14] to be gone and our line's gone and
[56:17] different ones are going to be gone uh
[56:19] during the holidays and that's fine. Go
[56:21] visit your family and uh come back to
[56:24] your church family.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz that's the one we're going to
[56:29] live eternity with. The other one we'll
[56:31] see. We'll claim them all. We don't
[56:34] throw any of them out. We going to claim
[56:35] them all. That's what I was telling
[56:36] brother Boyd. I said, "Brother Keith
[56:38] Reed told me one time, he said, "Brother
[56:39] Wade, that's at the white throne
[56:40] judgment." He said, "We will have more
[56:42] power."
[56:45] &gt;&gt; We will have more power than the
[56:48] prevailing power that was in this Bible
[56:50] that said they got to believe in the
[56:51] Lord Jesus Christ. Because you
[56:52] understand one thing, somebody that
[56:55] never knew God ever, never knew about
[56:57] Jesus Christ, if they did something good
[56:58] for you through you, you would impart
[57:01] the eternal life to them.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how powerful your eternal
[57:05] life is. And you know what? That eternal
[57:07] life is going to carry you all the way
[57:09] to the white throne. Not to be in
[57:10] judgment,
[57:11] &gt;&gt; but to be a judge.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; And you know what? If you judge
[57:14] righteous,
[57:16] &gt;&gt; somebody's been good to you, your
[57:17] family's been good to you, your mama,
[57:18] your daddy, anybody that's not a
[57:20] believer, claim them.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Claim them. Even it's a white throne
[57:24] judge. Why not?
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's for big things.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Because that's where we're going to have
[57:31] the most prevailing power. We will have
[57:33] eternal life. We'll be eternal people.
[57:35] and we'll have the mind of God.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; So, we'll not do anything that he didn't
[57:38] think we did were going to do before the
[57:40] foundation of the world.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; But he wants to do what? He wants to do
[57:43] it through us.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Okay? If not, then we can just go home
[57:46] and sit down and just close our eyes and
[57:48] let God talk to us in our brain. Well,
[57:50] guess what? Most of the time that ain't
[57:52] God that talks to me like that.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Well, hello somebody.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, pray for me and and brother
[57:58] Gay because he's he's admitting the same
[58:00] thing. So, just pray for us that the
[58:02] devil won't be playing in our head
[58:03] anymore.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[58:06] &gt;&gt; But back then ne back then we'll have
[58:08] the mind of Christ.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; We won't have to worry about that guy.
[58:11] He's gone. He's in the He's in this He's
[58:13] in that sea,
[58:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Of of of We ain't going to never
[58:18] remember that guy no more.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; The former things will pass away.
[58:23] Behold, what?
[58:24] &gt;&gt; All things will be made new.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you. We're uh good to have you
[58:29] again. We're going to stay on the Son of
[58:31] Man. We're going to try to get through
[58:32] some of this uh through Matthew 24. And
[58:36] uh now listen,
[58:39] there's only one man on earth that ever
[58:44] understood
[58:46] really who the devil was and where he
[58:48] was.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; All right. And that's the son of man.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; He sat there and he told them, they
[58:56] said, "Is it me? Is it me? Is it me? Is
[58:59] it me at the at the supper? Is it me? Is
[59:01] it me? And he said, "Whoever sops the
[59:02] bowl," well here goes Judas the bowl and
[59:06] nobody knew a thing.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Right. Exactly.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; But Jesus knew
[59:11] &gt;&gt; cuz he was the son of man.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; So keep that in the back of your mind.
[59:15] The son of man is the only only form of
[59:18] God.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; That can tell where the devil's at.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Everybody else is deceived. Right.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Except the group that's going to take
[59:29] the body change and get out of here in a
[59:32] rapture. All right.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; So, I just believe we're part of that. I
[59:35] believe that we are in the right
[59:36] message.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; I don't mean this building, but we're in
[59:40] the right building. We're in the right
[59:41] tabernacle. We're in the right mode of
[59:44] transportation. We're in the right way.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; We got to get oursel out of the way, but
[59:49] we got to get in the way that that that
[59:51] God sent us a prophet to go down that
[59:53] path. And that's what I believe that
[59:55] these seals are for. They're not just to
[59:57] expose the Antichrist, but they're to
[59:59] reveal Jesus Christ and where he's at.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; He's in his people. Amen. So, let's bow
[1:00:04] our heads to heavenly father. Lord,
[1:00:06] thank you for this day. Thank you for
[1:00:07] all the songs and the worship, Lord.
[1:00:09] Now, we're going to worship you, Lord,
[1:00:10] in in speaking of the gospel. Father, I
[1:00:12] pray that you'd be with each one. Lord,
[1:00:14] bless the ears to hear, Lord, and the
[1:00:16] hearts to receive today, Lord, what you
[1:00:18] have for them. Father, forgive us of our
[1:00:21] sins and mistakes. Lord, bless the ones
[1:00:22] that are sick. They're not here. Brother
[1:00:23] Joe and them that are traveling. Brother
[1:00:25] Luis and them getting ready to travel.
[1:00:26] Sister Regina already where she's at,
[1:00:29] Lord. The ones that are traveling, if we
[1:00:30] miss anybody, Lord, just protect each
[1:00:32] one. Father, this time of Christmas
[1:00:35] time, Lord, is a time that that we need
[1:00:37] to uh reflect on you more and know that
[1:00:40] it's not you that was born in a manger
[1:00:42] on December 25th, that it was we know it
[1:00:46] was in April, but Lord, we know that we
[1:00:48] had a birth.
[1:00:50] That was the manger of our heart that
[1:00:53] you were birthed when we were lost in
[1:00:56] sin and didn't know anything. We were
[1:00:58] out in the world running around and
[1:01:00] Father, you come to us and said, "Be
[1:01:03] mine. I want you to be mine." And we
[1:01:07] accepted him in our heart. And we thank
[1:01:09] you for that, Lord. That we accepted
[1:01:10] you, Lord. Now, Lord, I pray that you
[1:01:13] accept us. Accept the gifts that we give
[1:01:15] you, Lord. the things that we have
[1:01:17] today, Lord, to give back to you,
[1:01:18] Father, which is listening and hearing
[1:01:20] the word of God. Lord, just bless each
[1:01:23] one, Father. Be with the bride around
[1:01:24] the world. Be with the ones in the
[1:01:26] foreign fields like Brother Keith and
[1:01:27] different ones as they navigate through
[1:01:29] all that time of of turmoil and things
[1:01:32] in this country, Lord. I pray that you'd
[1:01:34] be with each bride over there and all
[1:01:36] the humanity, Lord, that you'll be with
[1:01:38] them, Father. And may they see Jesus
[1:01:40] Christ in all these things. We ask you
[1:01:42] in your name, Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:01:46] 1 Corinthians 2:9, but as it is written,
[1:01:49] I hath not seen nor ear heard, neither
[1:01:51] have entered into the heart of man the
[1:01:53] things which God hath prepared. Now
[1:01:55] watch, for them that love him. So that
[1:01:57] puts it in a different category.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; All right. I like I like Paul. He He
[1:02:02] brings you He brings you a dissertation
[1:02:04] and he says, "This is why."
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; So we're going to get the things that
[1:02:09] God has prepared prepared for us if we
[1:02:11] love him.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; They're prepared for everybody. But you
[1:02:15] and I have got to be the one to accept
[1:02:16] it.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; But God has revealed him unto who? Us
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; by his spirit. For the spirit searches
[1:02:23] all things, yay, the deep things of God.
[1:02:26] And that's the um in one of the um
[1:02:29] versions of the Bible says, even the
[1:02:30] inmost depths of God's being. And that's
[1:02:33] what we're here for. We're here to learn
[1:02:35] more of God.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. and his being and his substance
[1:02:38] and what he is and and how that he's
[1:02:40] been hid from everything else and and
[1:02:42] without a revelation he's hid from us.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you can be seated and I'll
[1:02:46] continue reading though. Let me read
[1:02:48] this for brother Brandham
[1:02:50] trying to do God a service in 1965. Now,
[1:02:53] we're we're getting ready to start on
[1:02:54] the seals. Uh like I said before, we've
[1:02:57] kind of piecing this thing together
[1:02:58] because of people being out and uh we're
[1:03:02] going to be out in um January um a
[1:03:05] couple of days. Brother Richard Wilson
[1:03:07] is he just about pretty much lassoed me
[1:03:10] to come preach for him. So I'm going to
[1:03:11] do that on January the 11th and then on
[1:03:14] the 4th I'll be gone to hunting in Ohio.
[1:03:17] But we'll be back and then we'll get
[1:03:18] started end of January, 1st of February
[1:03:21] straight through every service will be
[1:03:23] we'll talk about the seals. Okay,
[1:03:26] thereby with now without the opening of
[1:03:28] the seals we will not take a body
[1:03:29] change. Without the opening of the
[1:03:30] seals,
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; will not get the fullness. Now, that
[1:03:33] don't mean you're not a Christian.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; I don't ever want to don't don't think
[1:03:37] that that because I you don't understand
[1:03:39] fully everything that you're that you're
[1:03:41] not a Christian. No, the devil's telling
[1:03:43] you that, but we're not telling you
[1:03:44] that.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; But to live a full Christian life, he
[1:03:47] wants us to be what? A stature of a
[1:03:50] perfect man. He wants us to be
[1:03:52] Christians to where if you can't find
[1:03:55] me, you can find him.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; He's the one you need to talk to anyway.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; All right. As we were talking last
[1:04:03] Sunday or before, I said I, you know, I
[1:04:05] being a pastor, that's it's been
[1:04:07] different the past year or so. But I
[1:04:10] found out one thing. You're never going
[1:04:12] to make it by a human mortal man. Right.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; It's got to take the leadership of the
[1:04:18] Holy Spirit
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; through a group of men by the five-fold
[1:04:22] ministry that's going to bring you to
[1:04:24] perfection. You just every once in a
[1:04:26] while, um, Brother Gabe, you need a
[1:04:29] shepherd
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; with a shepherd hook
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; or or break your leg every once in a
[1:04:34] while to keep you in the fold. But it's
[1:04:37] God that's going to do the revealing.
[1:04:39] It's God that's going to do all the
[1:04:40] work. All right? And we appreciate all
[1:04:42] of you and we thank you so very much.
[1:04:44] Okay. I the devil just beat me up the
[1:04:47] other day because I said I didn't want
[1:04:48] to be your pastor. That's not exactly
[1:04:50] true. I didn't want to be I didn't say I
[1:04:52] want this job.
[1:04:54] Okay. I didn't I didn't hand out flyers
[1:04:58] and posters and you know I've been
[1:05:00] through that voting thing, you know, so
[1:05:01] I won't be and I won't be the mayor
[1:05:03] after a few weeks. So I didn't become
[1:05:04] I'm not a mayor anymore. So, um um that
[1:05:08] that was just something that I did to
[1:05:10] help the community and I believe I did
[1:05:12] help the community and the community got
[1:05:13] better for it and now I hand it over to
[1:05:15] somebody else cuz I got a bigger job to
[1:05:17] do.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, um but you know there is going
[1:05:21] to be government in heaven.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; The government shall be on his shoulder.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; There will be kings and priests. And
[1:05:31] brother Bram said, if you got kings, you
[1:05:33] got to have something to rule over. All
[1:05:35] right. So, not with a rod of iron.
[1:05:37] That's down here.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; But we do like he he he leads us with
[1:05:42] what? Nail scarred hands. He leads us by
[1:05:44] example number one and by what? Grace
[1:05:47] number two.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're going to read this
[1:05:49] in just a minute because when we get to
[1:05:52] the headstone, there's only one thing
[1:05:54] Brother Ram talks about the headstone
[1:05:55] and he talks about it being Jesus
[1:05:56] Christ, being the son of man. But he
[1:05:58] takes you back to the scripture in in
[1:06:01] Jeremiah, I believe it is, that says
[1:06:03] that the headstone will come crying
[1:06:04] grace, grace unto it. Okay?
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; So that's the headstone. The headstone
[1:06:08] is Jesus Christ. The headstone today,
[1:06:11] when we're going to read this scripture
[1:06:12] in Matthew 24, that was the headstone.
[1:06:17] Now, what do you mean by headstone?
[1:06:18] Headstone is the head man. And it's the
[1:06:20] when you have an arch that comes up like
[1:06:22] this in a doorway, right here in the
[1:06:24] middle of that arch is a stone. If
[1:06:28] you've walked through some stone
[1:06:29] archways, there's one big one in the
[1:06:31] middle. That one is if you pull that one
[1:06:33] out, it all collapses.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; So that headstone has to be there. We
[1:06:38] ain't talking about headstones in a
[1:06:39] grave.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on, somebody. We put them on
[1:06:42] there symbolic that there is a head.
[1:06:44] There is a head of of the whole human
[1:06:47] race. But we have a headstone that's not
[1:06:50] out in the grave.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; He's what? In the pillar of our heart.
[1:06:53] He's in the arch of our heart.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; And if we don't have him as the
[1:06:57] headstone, then we're going to crumble
[1:06:59] and fall. That's right.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; All right. So, just remember that.
[1:07:02] That's why in a nutshell, that's why the
[1:07:06] son of man ministry had to come back in
[1:07:09] the end time
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; cuz it's the headstone to the church.
[1:07:14] It's the head man, which was the son of
[1:07:17] man
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; back in power again in his people.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; What? Doing the same things he did when
[1:07:26] he was on earth.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Which is preach a perfect message.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; To an imperfect people.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Who took my water?
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; H I did. I said it right here before
[1:07:40] church started.
[1:07:43] Somebody drank my drink. Somebody drank
[1:07:44] my water. Aaron, did you drink my water?
[1:07:47] No, I said it right here. It was about
[1:07:48] half full. Well, who enjoy it? Bless
[1:07:50] you. [laughter]
[1:07:58] Be like a priest looking for holy water.
[1:08:00] Somebody done stole everything. I bet
[1:08:03] Luis's got it back there. He don't have
[1:08:04] the door open.
[1:08:07] But that's why No. Oh, [laughter]
[1:08:11] who got it?
[1:08:13] Don't point. Everybody's pointing at
[1:08:14] everybody else. Brother Manuel, you got
[1:08:16] my water, didn't you?
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; You don't know if it's yours.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; No, brother Manuel got it. You drink it,
[1:08:24] you'll be blessed all day. [laughter]
[1:08:27] [clears throat]
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; I brushed my teeth three days ago. So,
[1:08:31] we're good.
[1:08:33] We're just family here.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. Just family here. But the reason
[1:08:37] the son of man, if he's standing on
[1:08:39] earth telling us this, that's why I was
[1:08:41] thinking the other day, why did Jesus
[1:08:44] stand on earth and preach the seals?
[1:08:46] Why?
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Because I'm going to tell you something.
[1:08:49] Nobody understood what he was saying.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Nobody.
[1:08:55] And then when brother Brandham gets here
[1:08:56] and he starts preaching on the seals,
[1:08:58] what'd he say? You ain't getting it. It
[1:09:00] ain't for you. This is not for you right
[1:09:03] now. You know, go and live a simple
[1:09:04] life. Jesus tells them that when they're
[1:09:06] when we're washing feet, what does Jesus
[1:09:08] say? He said, "You don't know what I'm
[1:09:09] doing, but you will know hereafter."
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz on the day of Pentecost, the
[1:09:14] hereafter came.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; They understood that. Peter was like,
[1:09:19] "You ain't washing nothing of mine."
[1:09:20] Jesus said, "You, if I don't wash your
[1:09:22] feet, you ain't part of me."
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; So Peter was like, "Wash me all, Lord."
[1:09:27] Jesus said, "No, I ain't got to do all
[1:09:29] that. I'm going to wash you within on
[1:09:32] the day of Pentecost and then you're
[1:09:33] going to help others get washed. But I
[1:09:35] want you to wash your feet as a symbol
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; of humility.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; We should be the humblest people on the
[1:09:43] face of the earth. If Jesus Christ, God
[1:09:45] Almighty in human flesh, the man that
[1:09:47] created the water, created the bowl, and
[1:09:49] created your feet, if you can't wash
[1:09:51] somebody else's feet, you're not going
[1:09:53] to heaven. Amen.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, get don't get quiet on me.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Because in other words, what the problem
[1:10:01] is now is I see is not receiving
[1:10:05] headship.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Headstone,
[1:10:09] headship.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; That's what I told you many times. A lot
[1:10:14] of people want Jesus.
[1:10:16] They want Jesus to come into their life,
[1:10:18] but they want him to be Lord Jesus
[1:10:21] Christ. Do they want the Lord to take
[1:10:24] over?
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus was just a man. Come on,
[1:10:28] somebody. He was just a man walking on
[1:10:30] the face of the earth and he was in a
[1:10:31] body that was dying.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Now, are they looking at that man? Are
[1:10:35] they looking at the man that was inside
[1:10:37] of him?
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Because that man is inside of him in you
[1:10:40] and I now
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; and then what that makes him that makes
[1:10:43] him the Lord of your life.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; So that's why we baptize in the name of
[1:10:48] the Lord. We we identify that he is the
[1:10:50] lord of our life.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; So let us make it a a new year's
[1:10:55] resolution that for him to be more of
[1:10:57] the lord of our life.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Not to be someone that sits in the
[1:11:04] background. We want him in the
[1:11:05] forefront.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. So brothers he comes up and
[1:11:11] this is in 1965. So what is he telling
[1:11:13] the people? He said the mysteries will
[1:11:16] be revealed in the last day. And what do
[1:11:17] he always say? He said, "We are
[1:11:19] prophetic people with prophetic insight.
[1:11:22] We love revelation. We love the deep
[1:11:25] things of God." And and and don't get me
[1:11:28] wrong, I love everything's got to start
[1:11:30] with a foundation. Even when we get to
[1:11:32] Zerubable, he put a foundation. There
[1:11:35] was a foundation there for him to build
[1:11:37] on.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; So, we got to have the foundation, which
[1:11:40] is the sure cornerstone.
[1:11:43] Jesus was the cornerstone of the church.
[1:11:46] But remember, he's got to be the
[1:11:47] headstone of your life. Yes, sir.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Because the cornerstone is right down
[1:11:52] here, but he wants to be up there. It's
[1:11:55] the same symbol. It's just up higher.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; And that's the headstone.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; So the headstone of the church is the
[1:12:01] son of man ministry.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Right? So if we got to understand that
[1:12:07] to go further, then we got to understand
[1:12:09] who the son of man is.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Because they asked that question, who is
[1:12:12] this son of man?
[1:12:15] But now remember, brother Brandham had a
[1:12:17] message to bring and it was in a
[1:12:18] two-fold manner.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; All right? He said in the church age
[1:12:23] book, we've read it. Dad's read it a
[1:12:24] million times. So have I this message of
[1:12:27] Malachi 4 is going to do two things.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; One, he's going to restore the gifts
[1:12:32] back. He's going to restore us back to
[1:12:35] the upper room experience.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Peter, James, and all those. Okay,
[1:12:39] that's the faith of the fathers. Now
[1:12:42] remember though, restoring back to the
[1:12:44] faith of fathers will not take you in a
[1:12:47] body change
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; because it did. If it would have, it
[1:12:49] would have done them already.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; So remember that was lost. Remember even
[1:12:54] the Bible says the name of the Lord was
[1:12:56] lost during the ages. Why? They started
[1:12:58] baptizing the name of father, son, holy
[1:12:59] ghost. They totally lost the name.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; But they baptized in the name over here
[1:13:04] in the first church age, second church
[1:13:05] age, part of the third church age.
[1:13:07] Everybody with me? So now you got to
[1:13:09] have the alpha bride. The omega bride's
[1:13:10] got to be just like the alpha bride.
[1:13:12] Plus,
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; this plus was, listen, don't get me
[1:13:17] wrong. This plus over here was another
[1:13:18] church age.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Another move of God, another act of God.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Now, over here where we at in the
[1:13:26] seventh church age, there is no eighth
[1:13:28] church age.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; There's no ninth church age. So, this is
[1:13:31] it. Right?
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; So everything's got to be wrapped up in
[1:13:35] this message in this day in the time
[1:13:40] recognizing your day
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; today
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; and his message. So look, not when he
[1:13:47] starts out doing this what prayer lines.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; That was not his message. That was
[1:13:54] restoring the faith back for so people
[1:13:57] could have faith in this man called
[1:14:00] William Brham.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; But now remember that faith
[1:14:06] was superficial to some,
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; right? That's right.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Because once he started preaching the
[1:14:11] true message and he started preaching
[1:14:13] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:14:14] Jesus Christ and he started preaching no
[1:14:16] eternal hell. When he started preaching
[1:14:18] all these different things, what
[1:14:19] happened? Did those people come with
[1:14:21] him? No.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; They went gone. They gone. Bye-bye.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; So the real message then
[1:14:29] is not going to be a public show. It's
[1:14:32] not going to be to to um I won't call
[1:14:36] his name, but the guy that's got 6
[1:14:38] 800,000 people. No, I'm not talking
[1:14:39] about in the message. I'm talking about
[1:14:40] out in the world. You know, 10,000
[1:14:42] people in a man's church said he don't
[1:14:45] preach in sin. Well, maybe that's why
[1:14:46] he's got 10,000 people in his church.
[1:14:48] He's got 10,000 [snorts] sinners.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; I believe I will
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm telling you, if you don't preach
[1:14:56] against sin, what is what are we doing
[1:14:58] here? Amen.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; And I ain't talking about And brother
[1:15:01] Brown said, "Now, now sin ain't smoking,
[1:15:04] drinking, gambling, and cussing."
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's unbelief.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; It's not believing that what God said."
[1:15:11] That's why Brother Ram said, "We sin
[1:15:13] every day." Why do we sin every day? You
[1:15:15] say, "Well, I don't cuss, drink, smoke."
[1:15:17] No, you sin because you don't believe
[1:15:19] certain things.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Pray for me then.
[1:15:26] There's certain times that I don't
[1:15:28] believe certain things.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; You do too.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; But I know one thing's for sure. It's
[1:15:38] like brother Ram said, if you'll lay in
[1:15:40] the presence of the sun long enough,
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; you will ripen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; You will become what God said you would
[1:15:48] become. And if he said it before the
[1:15:50] foundation of the world, like I said
[1:15:51] many times before, don't ever say, "God
[1:15:53] don't love me. Right?
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; He can't change his mind.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; If he ever loved you one speck of a
[1:16:00] second before the foundation of the
[1:16:02] world, he can never change his mind.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Now, there's ups and downs and ins and
[1:16:06] outs and family and friends and all that
[1:16:08] that we got that we have problems with,
[1:16:10] but God is never going to change his
[1:16:12] mind.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; You will be a child of God if you were a
[1:16:18] child of God before the if he thought of
[1:16:20] you before the foundation of the world.
[1:16:22] That's the seed. The seed is what was in
[1:16:24] God's mind?
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Because remember, when it was in God's
[1:16:28] mind, it was eternal.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; When man started coming down here and
[1:16:33] adding natural seed, you understand what
[1:16:36] I'm talking about. Adam and Eve and
[1:16:37] different ones. That's when it got a
[1:16:39] problem.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; We got to go back to that. You must be
[1:16:43] born again
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; and have the mind of Christ. Let him
[1:16:48] birth you in the manger as the song says
[1:16:50] the manger of your heart.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; So now brother Ram says look not when he
[1:16:55] starts doing this but when he begins to
[1:16:57] sound his message not the years of
[1:16:59] preparation in other words not the
[1:17:01] prayer lines.
[1:17:03] Now I want to get something really
[1:17:04] clear. There's groups in the message
[1:17:07] that believe that what brother Ram said
[1:17:08] from from 47 to 63.
[1:17:13] You don't have to believe all of it
[1:17:14] because he said things wrong. We just
[1:17:17] got to believe what he said from 63 to
[1:17:20] 65. Well, I'm like my dad always said,
[1:17:23] if you don't believe and and listen to
[1:17:25] 47 to 63, that's your foundation.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; You can forget about 63 to 65.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Your foundation is, like I said before,
[1:17:35] it's getting those little things down.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Okay? Right?
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; The details.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; When you start building a house, what's
[1:17:46] the most important thing? Your
[1:17:48] foundation.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; You can build the prettiest Tajma Hall
[1:17:51] in the world and three or four years
[1:17:54] later you'll get cracks in your wall.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; You'll get your house leaning over. Why?
[1:17:58] Your foundation is not sure. We need, as
[1:18:00] the Bible says, a sure foundation,
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; which is Jesus Christ. If we keep
[1:18:05] looking to him,
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; then we'll be fine. then the building
[1:18:09] will stand
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; on its own.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; But brother Brown said, "Not the years
[1:18:13] in preparation, but when he begins to
[1:18:16] sound the message, then these mysteries
[1:18:20] then will be revealed." And brother Ram
[1:18:24] said, "And here they are not knowing
[1:18:25] them, and you people are a witness of
[1:18:27] that." He told them right where it was
[1:18:29] at
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; that the headstone message was being
[1:18:32] preached. Now, this is 1965. He'd
[1:18:34] already preached the seals, but he's get
[1:18:36] coming down to the end of his ministry.
[1:18:38] And he's telling the people, "This is
[1:18:40] what you're this is what I came for.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; This is it. This is my ministry right
[1:18:44] here. This is what the seventh angel
[1:18:46] messenger is come to bring. He to
[1:18:49] restore. And then
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; then to reveal the seals, to reveal the
[1:18:54] thunders that are contained in the
[1:18:56] seals."
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; And what are the thunders? It's a
[1:19:01] revelation. When the seal breaks,
[1:19:03] there's a thunder.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; I'll read you. Well, not worry now. Luke
[1:19:08] 17:30 says, "Even thus shall it be in
[1:19:10] the day when the Son of Man
[1:19:13] is revealed."
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Not when he shows up, Brother Joe. Not
[1:19:18] when he shows up, when he's revealed.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; It took us from 1963
[1:19:24] to 202 almost six
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; to get the revelation.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Come on. We're still here. So, we're
[1:19:33] still God's still revealing himself,
[1:19:35] trying to get us to see that he did come
[1:19:38] in 63 in the word,
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; but just as they rejected him the first
[1:19:45] time, they've rejected him again.
[1:19:47] Remember,
[1:19:56] Judas hung around long enough
[1:20:00] to get holy and sanctified.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; But like I said before, 11 other people
[1:20:07] in that room did not think Judas was the
[1:20:10] one. Right?
[1:20:12] He's going to go yo yo. Well, he Well,
[1:20:14] Jesus told him go do what he's going to
[1:20:16] do. Well, he was telling him exactly who
[1:20:19] was going to betray him, but they're
[1:20:21] like, "Well, he's going to go and buy
[1:20:22] some more food or he's going to go pay
[1:20:24] for this food that we ate." They had no
[1:20:26] no clue. But the son of man is the only
[1:20:28] one that can tell what that other spirit
[1:20:30] is like.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Without it will you will be deceived.
[1:20:35] [snorts]
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; So, here's the son of man. He's on
[1:20:38] earth. He's getting ready to preach a
[1:20:39] sermon. and they don't understand any of
[1:20:42] it. But they asked him a couple of
[1:20:43] questions. Jesus went out and departed
[1:20:44] from the temple. And his disciples came
[1:20:46] to them to show him the buildings of the
[1:20:48] temple. And Jesus said unto them, "See
[1:20:51] you not all these things? Verily I say
[1:20:53] unto you, there shall not be left one
[1:20:55] stone upon another that shall not be
[1:20:57] thrown down." Now when was that? That
[1:20:58] was in AD70 when Titus destroyed the
[1:21:01] temple.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; All right? And as he sat upon the mount
[1:21:05] of olives, the disciples came unto him
[1:21:07] privately, saying, tell us, when shall
[1:21:09] these things be? What shall be the sign
[1:21:11] of your coming and of the end of the
[1:21:13] world? All right. So Jesus answered and
[1:21:15] said, now we're going to go start as
[1:21:17] brother Ram did in the uh sixth seal
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; and parallel the two because Jesus
[1:21:24] answered and said unto them, take heed
[1:21:25] that no man deceive you. Okay? For many
[1:21:29] shall come in my name. What? Jesus
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; right
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; or Christ
[1:21:37] and shall deceive many
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; let's let brother Brandham explain that
[1:21:43] just for a second cuz what happened in
[1:21:45] the first seal you had a horse I was
[1:21:47] listening yesterday to um no it was
[1:21:50] coming back from Kentucky 10 virgins on
[1:21:52] the 10 virgins brother Brandham says
[1:21:54] that the white horse was the Holy Ghost
[1:21:57] riding through the church ages Right.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; But we know it was progressive
[1:22:04] revelation. We know that he we know that
[1:22:06] he's just a human being just like the
[1:22:08] rest of us. And listen, until God
[1:22:10] revealed, don't you know, we don't need
[1:22:11] to say, "Well, I knew that when I first
[1:22:13] Well, bless God. Pray for me." I didn't.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things I've had to
[1:22:18] learn over and over and over, Brother
[1:22:20] Kylie, over and over again.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; But you know what? Stay here long enough
[1:22:26] and you'll get it. Amen.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Stay here long enough and you'll get it.
[1:22:32] No, I'm not I'm not talking about here.
[1:22:34] I'm talking about the message.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Don't ever think when you walk through
[1:22:38] that door you got it made.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; You might have a good seat sometimes
[1:22:45] or not. Have to sit somewhere else and
[1:22:47] have that look when you go by like
[1:22:48] they're sitting in my seat
[1:22:52] again.
[1:22:54] [snorts]
[1:22:56] So he
[1:22:58] Brother B. had a thought there, but I'm
[1:23:00] not going to say anything. Revelation 6
[1:23:02] verse one. I'm just glad you're looking
[1:23:04] for a seat.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; And I saw the lamb when he had opened
[1:23:09] one of the seals. This is brother
[1:23:10] Brandham. He goes back to Revelation 6.
[1:23:13] And I heard it was a noise of thunder.
[1:23:16] One of the four beasts saying, "Come and
[1:23:18] see." Now, what beast was that? That was
[1:23:19] the lion. L I O N. The lion spirit of
[1:23:23] the four combat beasts said, "John, come
[1:23:26] and look and see. Something's fixing to
[1:23:27] happen."
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Right
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; now, remember, John was only
[1:23:31] commissioned to write what he saw,
[1:23:34] not not reveal it. Write what he saw.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; He because Jesus told him, Revelations
[1:23:41] 1, he said, "Write these things and send
[1:23:42] them to the churches."
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; So that's what John's job was to do. So
[1:23:46] he saw these symbols. He said, "Behold a
[1:23:49] white horse." He saw a white horse. He
[1:23:51] that sat on him had a bow and a crown
[1:23:53] was given unto him and he went forth
[1:23:54] conquering
[1:23:56] and to conquer. Now, this is what tore a
[1:23:59] lot of people up because brother
[1:24:01] Brandham said, "Oh, this fell is the
[1:24:03] antichrist,
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; right?"
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Because a lot of people, a lot of
[1:24:06] commentaries said that was Jesus Christ.
[1:24:08] Even brother Random said mighty
[1:24:09] conqueror act in 1957, he shows him
[1:24:12] riding through the church ages um
[1:24:15] shooting a bow of of love and had a
[1:24:17] crown on it, you know.
[1:24:19] Right?
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; That's why we needed a prophet.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; That's why we needed the son of man
[1:24:27] ministry to come in a cloud like he left
[1:24:29] in a cloud.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; The son of man left in a cloud.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; He came back as the son of God in your
[1:24:37] soul as the new birth.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; But he's promised just like I read you
[1:24:42] in the days of what? The coming of the
[1:24:44] son of man, these things will be
[1:24:45] revealed. Well, where'd he come? He came
[1:24:47] in 1963. He didn't come physically. He
[1:24:50] will not come physically
[1:24:53] until the millennium. But he is
[1:24:55] physically in me and you.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; That's why that there's more of us got
[1:24:59] to be out of here
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; that more of him can be in here.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Listen, that's the whole walk of
[1:25:06] Christianity.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; It's not just coming and sitting in a
[1:25:09] church pew.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Become what you see.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Become what you believe. Believe it and
[1:25:15] live it. Amen.
[1:25:18] [applause]
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; But who do we find this per great person
[1:25:26] was? He's the Antichrist.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; But remember, every clue we needed was
[1:25:33] in the Bible when John
[1:25:36] saw it, wrote it down, scrolled it up,
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; put it in an earthn vessel, and they
[1:25:42] found it years later. That's right.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; And that was the apocalypse or the book
[1:25:46] of revelations.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; So John just wrote what he saw. He
[1:25:51] didn't make any commentary about it. He
[1:25:53] wrote what he saw. All right. And it was
[1:25:55] a wild horse. Well, you would think,
[1:25:57] listen, but we got to remember we are we
[1:26:00] are dealing with the most deceiving
[1:26:02] person ever
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; to be on the earth or heaven or
[1:26:06] anywhere. Remember, he's originated in
[1:26:08] heaven.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; He originated in heaven.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm talking about the devil.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; And he fooled a bunch of angels to come
[1:26:17] down here and try to fool a bunch of us.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; But what a fool he is.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Cuz somebody is going to take this
[1:26:25] message and live it. And like brother
[1:26:27] Ram said, he said, "Satan will not know
[1:26:29] what to do with you."
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's a lot of people he knows how
[1:26:32] to handle. I'm preach somebody. He
[1:26:35] There's people that he knows how to
[1:26:36] handle. He knows how to manipulate every
[1:26:38] one of us.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Brother Bram said, "Satan's got
[1:26:43] one lick at you." He knows your weak
[1:26:46] spot and he said, "You better cover it
[1:26:47] up.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; You better cover it up because that's
[1:26:51] the that's what Satan's going to start
[1:26:53] poking at."
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; And listen, everybody sitting in this
[1:26:56] room knows what your weakness is.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; I don't know it. I don't want to know
[1:27:00] it.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; But you know what your weakness is
[1:27:02] because you live with you.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; So you take that and work on it.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Work on it. work on keeping that thing
[1:27:11] covered.
[1:27:13] But he's the antichrist. But Jesus never
[1:27:15] said he was the antichrist. Jesus said
[1:27:17] what? Jesus said what? Take heed that no
[1:27:20] man deceive you. Well, this man did
[1:27:23] deceive the whole world except for those
[1:27:26] that are what? Marked with a mark or
[1:27:28] have the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; If you don't have the Holy Ghost, you're
[1:27:31] deceived.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; For many shall come in my name. No,
[1:27:36] what? in my name preaching
[1:27:39] saying, "I am Christ and shall deceive
[1:27:40] many."
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; See, there's your seal. It's the
[1:27:48] Antichrist. Remember, he had a bow with
[1:27:49] no arrows, he went forth conquering and
[1:27:51] to conquer. So, in the first couple of
[1:27:53] church ages, that's what that white
[1:27:55] righteous church did. Listen, Satan knew
[1:27:57] he couldn't get a true Christian,
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; with, you know, bar hopping. And
[1:28:04] come on,
[1:28:06] he's in here today. He's not out there.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; He's in here today and he brought his
[1:28:11] sleepy demons with most for some of
[1:28:13] y'all.
[1:28:16] That's kind of foolish to send a sleepy
[1:28:17] demon. I wish the demons would fall
[1:28:19] asleep. I'm not talking about none of
[1:28:21] y'all.
[1:28:23] That's okay. Let me back up again. I'll
[1:28:25] just drink some water. [laughter]
[1:28:28] Think about that for a minute.
[1:28:32] I want the sleepy demons to fall asleep.
[1:28:34] Not anyway.
[1:28:37] But he's here and he knows how to
[1:28:39] deceive you.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; But there's going to come a time.
[1:28:44] Remember, there was one man he could
[1:28:46] never deceive.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Who was that? The son of man.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; He was never deceived.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Ever. He knew everything that was going
[1:28:58] on.
[1:29:00] So if the Son of Man ministry is to do
[1:29:02] that, then the Son of Man ministry's got
[1:29:05] to do that here.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Beware.
[1:29:11] Think about it. We come to a place and
[1:29:14] we look at this white righteous church.
[1:29:15] We look at this white horse and we look
[1:29:18] at this strong guy with a bow up. I
[1:29:20] mean, he's got that bow up like this and
[1:29:22] he's riding forth and he's conquering
[1:29:25] everything, you know, without even an
[1:29:26] arrow.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; But he's what? He's conquering by
[1:29:29] deception.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; He's deceiving the people into believing
[1:29:34] a lie.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, the Bible said the
[1:29:37] lie,
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; which is the one Satan told Eve at the
[1:29:41] beginning.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; All right. So, it's Antichrist. And
[1:29:44] until you're born again, you are under
[1:29:46] that Antichrist anointing.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Because all those all those without the
[1:29:54] Holy Ghost will be deceived. That's what
[1:29:56] the Bible says.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; All right. That's not an opinion of a
[1:29:58] preacher. That's the Bible. All right.
[1:30:03] So, first 2 Thessalonians. And now we
[1:30:05] beseech you, brethren, by the coming of
[1:30:06] our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our
[1:30:08] gathering together unto him, that you be
[1:30:10] not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled,
[1:30:13] neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by
[1:30:16] letter, as from us, as that the day of
[1:30:18] Christ is at hand. Now, be careful. The
[1:30:22] day of Christ is at hand. You got to go
[1:30:24] back to Matthew 24 and see that he said
[1:30:26] they would be false ones here.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; So you got to be careful. You got to
[1:30:30] keep them separate. All right? Keep them
[1:30:32] separate. All right? So let no man
[1:30:35] deceive you by any means.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; For that day shall not come except there
[1:30:41] come a falling away first. And we see
[1:30:43] that happening right now.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; We see that falling away happening.
[1:30:47] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[1:30:50] of predition who opposes and exalteth
[1:30:53] himself above all that is called God or
[1:30:56] that is worshiped so that he as God
[1:31:00] siteth in the temple of God showing
[1:31:03] himself that he is God
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; that's pretty close
[1:31:09] remember you not that when I was with
[1:31:11] you I told you these things and now you
[1:31:14] know what withholding that he might be
[1:31:16] revealed in his time. What? When he
[1:31:18] wrote this back, whatever it was, he
[1:31:20] knew he wasn't going to be revealed
[1:31:22] then.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; All right. And now you know what
[1:31:25] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[1:31:27] his time. All right. For the mystery of
[1:31:30] iniquity doth already work. Only he who
[1:31:34] now letth will let until he be taken out
[1:31:37] of the way. God letth will let until he
[1:31:40] the bride be taken out of the way.
[1:31:41] Brother Ram told us that. And then shall
[1:31:43] that wicked one be revealed whom the
[1:31:46] Lord shall consume with the brightness
[1:31:47] spirit of his mouth and shall destroy
[1:31:49] with the brightness of his coming. Even
[1:31:51] him whose coming is after the workings
[1:31:53] of Satan with all power look power signs
[1:31:57] and wonders
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; the devil
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; and with all deceivableness of
[1:32:05] unrighteousness
[1:32:06] and them that perish. Look, go back to
[1:32:09] what I said a minute ago. God will
[1:32:12] reveal himself to those who what? Love
[1:32:14] him.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Listen to this right here. Because they
[1:32:17] receive not the love of the truth. Some
[1:32:19] people can receive the truth,
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; but they can't live it.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; They just can't live it. They can
[1:32:26] receive the truth. Well, listen. We've
[1:32:29] seen people be in the message 30, 40
[1:32:30] years,
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; They receive the truth,
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; but they didn't receive the love of it.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Because the love of it
[1:32:38] will constrain you to be right here and
[1:32:40] not somewhere else.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; And again, not I'm not saying this
[1:32:43] building. I'm talking about in this
[1:32:45] message, the truth of the hour and not
[1:32:48] out there saying that it's false and
[1:32:49] brother R was this and this and [snorts]
[1:32:52] it's nothing but the devil.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; It's that rider that's now on the pale
[1:32:56] horse. He's got all three powers working
[1:33:00] in him right now. Satan. But praise God,
[1:33:05] God's got all his power working in a
[1:33:07] bride.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; You know what? The devil might be
[1:33:11] looking for Jesus around here somewhere.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Cuz listen, I'm going to I'm just going
[1:33:16] to give you a little revelation here.
[1:33:19] If Brother Brandham asked when he went
[1:33:21] across the curtain of time, he said,
[1:33:23] "Can I see him?" Right? He was in the
[1:33:26] sixth dimension. Everybody with me? He
[1:33:28] was in the sixth dimension. He said, "I
[1:33:30] Good. Okay. I want to see him. What the
[1:33:33] angel say? He's higher. You can't see
[1:33:36] him right now. Well, he was in the
[1:33:37] seventh dimension.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to tell you, there's two
[1:33:41] dimensions I know Satan can't get in.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Six and seven.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Six, we know he ain't there.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Seven is God Almighty himself.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; So, I see. So, you're saying, what' you
[1:33:54] say, brother?
[1:33:55] Satan is not understanding
[1:33:58] that even in that seventh dimension,
[1:34:01] he's in your dimension.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; He's inside of you sealed.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Remember, if you sealed, the devil don't
[1:34:08] know. And can't, brother said, if I say
[1:34:10] something, he said the devil can attack
[1:34:12] it.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; He said, but if I hold it in my heart,
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; come on. If I hold it in my heart, even
[1:34:19] the devil can't get in there. He can't
[1:34:22] understand that that love affair between
[1:34:24] you and you AND GOD.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU go behind that tent and you go
[1:34:29] in THERE WITH GOD AND HE SPEAKS TO YOU
[1:34:31] AND GIVES YOU REVELATION, SATAN'S
[1:34:33] NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; He's gone off trying to deceive somebody
[1:34:38] else.
[1:34:39] Remember, Brother Bam said, we come we
[1:34:41] try to come to a place to where Satan
[1:34:43] wouldn't know what to do with us.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Well, he didn't know what to do with
[1:34:46] Jesus. He took him up on the mountain.
[1:34:47] He took him up on the He took him in the
[1:34:49] temple. took him all and and all he said
[1:34:52] was
[1:34:53] scripture says
[1:34:56] no scripture says that's all you got to
[1:34:58] do he did like brother said he didn't
[1:35:00] perform one miracle he just quoted him
[1:35:02] the scripture and walked off
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; right
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; and that's the same way with us
[1:35:07] and with all deceit of righteousness in
[1:35:09] them that perish because they received
[1:35:10] not the love of the truth that they
[1:35:11] might be saved and for this cause God
[1:35:14] now watch for this cause
[1:35:18] God sends them strong delusion
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; that they should believe a lie.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Believe a lie.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; That they all might be damned who
[1:35:32] believe not the truth but had pleasure
[1:35:34] in unrighteousness.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; So that's a white horse. And then he
[1:35:39] gets off his white horse, he gets on a
[1:35:41] red horse and then Jesus is standing
[1:35:44] there and he said, "Oh, you shall hear
[1:35:45] of wars." There's never been a war
[1:35:47] fought that there's not blood been shed
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; except the spiritual war. And and that
[1:35:52] took bloodshed, too.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; And you shall hear wars and rumors of
[1:35:55] wars. Red horse, what? Red blood,
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; See that you be not troubled, for all
[1:36:04] these things must come to pass. Now
[1:36:06] listen, today I'm telling you,
[1:36:08] everything that you've went through must
[1:36:10] come to pass for your perfection. If you
[1:36:12] will believe that instead of the, "Oh,
[1:36:14] wo is me. Why is God pointing his finger
[1:36:16] at me? God might be pointing his finger
[1:36:18] at you, but what he's doing is he says,
[1:36:19] "Devil, go for him, but you're not going
[1:36:23] to get him."
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; What'd he do with Job? He said, "Hey,
[1:36:26] come and look at Job. Job was sitting
[1:36:29] like we were talking about the other
[1:36:30] day, brother Gabe. Job was sitting in
[1:36:32] his lounge chair that one of them
[1:36:34] vibrating recliners that's got heat. How
[1:36:38] do I know that? I've got a recliner
[1:36:41] that's never mind. [laughter]
[1:36:44] We have a massage chair.
[1:36:46] But here's Job and I mean he's like, "My
[1:36:49] 401k's got a couple million dollars in
[1:36:52] it and I got so many cows I can't count.
[1:36:56] Uh my kids are all going to church.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; They're all alive. They're all with me.
[1:37:04] And I'm doing good." Right? [snorts]
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Then all of a sudden,
[1:37:09] all of a sudden though, all of a sudden,
[1:37:11] it wasn't that. Come on. It wasn't that
[1:37:14] Job did something wrong,
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; but what it was was is God wanted to
[1:37:19] show. He had an eternal purpose.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; He had an eternal purpose to let his son
[1:37:26] go through this. Come on, somebody. He
[1:37:29] let him go through that. Listen, IF
[1:37:32] YOU'VE HAD A BAD DAY, GO READ BOOK OF
[1:37:34] JOB, first two chapters.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; HE LOST EVERYTHING.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Even his little comfy chair,
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; it burned to the ground.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; He was sitting on an ash heap of his of
[1:37:48] his house,
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; scraping boils off of his
[1:37:53] body,
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; and there was nobody left but his wife.
[1:37:56] And she was doubting him, too.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:01] So Job was there all by himself.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:38:06] Why?
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; He did. Nope. He did. No,
[1:38:11] he did all the sacrifices. He did
[1:38:13] everything he was supposed to do. But
[1:38:15] God wanted to show Listen, show an
[1:38:17] eternal proof.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; We'll talk. Hey, listen. We'll talk to
[1:38:22] Job, but we'll talk about Job for an
[1:38:25] eternity.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. and we'll meet the GUY
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; AND HE'LL TELL US HIS EXPERIENCE
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; right
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; and we'll like Job through your
[1:38:35] adversity there's no telling how many
[1:38:37] people come on somebody I'm talking
[1:38:39] about us too there's no telling how many
[1:38:42] people were affected by that man going
[1:38:44] through one of the MOST HORRIBLE THING
[1:38:46] HE LOST SEVEN OF HIS KIDS
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; they died
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; he had seven actually had 14 funerals if
[1:38:52] they were married
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:38:56] cattle were gone
[1:38:58] 401k was gone.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Any way to make an income's gone because
[1:39:02] his cows and chickens and all that's
[1:39:04] gone.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; So he's he's he's sitting in a in a
[1:39:08] depressed state.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I know my redeemer
[1:39:12] liveth."
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; I know something's going to come out of
[1:39:17] this good.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Now, how many of us when we're going
[1:39:20] through it, can we say the same thing?
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; No. We usually say
[1:39:26] what I do. Well, maybe God wants to just
[1:39:29] use you as an example
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; to show someone someone else because
[1:39:33] remember the four the four um letters of
[1:39:37] testimony is
[1:39:39] tight.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; You got to go through a test
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; to get a testimony. Right?
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; But listen, the Bible tells us the
[1:39:49] suffering of this world
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; is not to be compared with the glory
[1:39:55] that shall be revealed in us at his
[1:39:58] coming.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; We may look like horrible, destitute,
[1:40:02] don't know what we're doing, but you
[1:40:04] know what, brother
[1:40:06] and sister, that's God what he wants.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants the cream of the crop,
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; but the cream of the crop might not
[1:40:12] always look good
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; physically or emotionally. We may be a
[1:40:16] wreck, but God is going to do with his
[1:40:20] bride what he said he was going to do.
[1:40:22] He's going to perfect her here. We're
[1:40:24] going to be without Come on, somebody.
[1:40:26] We're going to be without SPOT OR
[1:40:27] WRINKLE HERE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO WAIT
[1:40:28] TILL WE get there.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; WE'RE HEADING TOWARD IT RIGHT NOW. WHEN
[1:40:32] YOU HAVE A BODY CHANGE, IT'LL BE IN THIS
[1:40:34] DIMENSION.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; IT WILL NOT BE IN A PROTECTED PLACE.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THOSE in the sixth dimension, it's
[1:40:41] just a protected, beautiful place.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; BUT REMEMBER, THEY'RE WANTING TO COME
[1:40:45] HERE.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; WHY? I don't know. But I do know. You
[1:40:52] know why? Because they want to be humans
[1:40:53] again. [snorts]
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; It is in our DNA
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; to be a human.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; And we can't deny it.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; In one more time. One more time. You
[1:41:04] ready? In Jesus Christ's DNA, God's DNA,
[1:41:09] he wanted to be a human.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; He always wanted to be a human. You say,
[1:41:13] "Why?" Number one, God can't change his
[1:41:15] mind.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; So, if he wanted to be a human, he's
[1:41:18] going to be one.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; If he's going to create the world, he
[1:41:22] was going to do it.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. We ought to put our We
[1:41:27] ought to put everything we got in that.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; THAT WHAT GOD does and says, he can't
[1:41:32] change his mind. SO WHAT DO WE do
[1:41:35] though? We go,
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to change my mind about that.
[1:41:39] No, you need to get over in his mind and
[1:41:41] it may change your mind.
[1:41:44] But when we get into these seals,
[1:41:45] listen, the seals is not this great uh
[1:41:48] you know, drawings and and horses and
[1:41:51] and you know, I'm going to I'm going to
[1:41:52] draw you a big picture over here, you
[1:41:54] know, and I'm going to have stuff
[1:41:55] blowing up and No,
[1:41:58] the seals were given to us to show
[1:42:01] expose the devil,
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Who he is, what he's doing, and why he's
[1:42:07] here.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you something. You
[1:42:09] know what the seals have done? The seals
[1:42:11] tell us where we're going, where we've
[1:42:13] been, where we going, why we're here,
[1:42:15] and all that.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; It's for me and you because it's for
[1:42:19] your redemption.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; You can read all this and you can have
[1:42:23] all these charts and all these horses
[1:42:24] and all. It's for your redemption.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; It's for your perfection.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; It's for your day of grace.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; In other ain't getting to grace anyway.
[1:42:36] You got to give me some grace here today
[1:42:37] for a little bit.
[1:42:42] Y'all sang for an hour. I'm going to
[1:42:43] preach for three. So it's triple. You
[1:42:45] get triple time. So
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; no, that's okay. But a red horse is
[1:42:49] what? It comes up to the next rider. Now
[1:42:51] remember that white righteous horse is
[1:42:53] still riding.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; It's riding today.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; And and and as I said before, God is the
[1:43:01] one that is a exclusionist
[1:43:04] or a segregator. I'm not.
[1:43:07] I have people in the denominations that
[1:43:09] I love, but I know if that system eats
[1:43:11] them up, they're not going to heaven.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother Brandham. And when he
[1:43:17] gets to these seals, he said, "I know
[1:43:18] now why I hated that system so bad."
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it comes straight from the
[1:43:26] devil.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Every denomination
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; comes from the devil.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Never did come from God. And there's
[1:43:37] 13,000 of them now according to the
[1:43:39] internet and the internet's always
[1:43:40] right. So
[1:43:43] [snorts]
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; what are y'all laughing for? Google it.
[1:43:49] It's like the other day, you know, I was
[1:43:51] u talking about Jesus, you know, being
[1:43:54] born in a manger and we always thought
[1:43:55] it was a wood manger with hay. It
[1:43:57] wasn't. It's a piece of granite that was
[1:44:00] heuned out. Well, the guys in Ohio
[1:44:02] because what happened was in the city of
[1:44:04] Bethlehem is where they raised the
[1:44:08] the perfect lambs
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; because remember the lamb can't have a
[1:44:13] blemish. That's
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; So they would bring those lambs in.
[1:44:20] How perfect is this? They bring those
[1:44:22] lambs in and they'd be birthed on this
[1:44:24] hollow piece.
[1:44:28] Jesus was born on a slab of granite and
[1:44:30] they laid his body on a slab of granite,
[1:44:33] but it's a h it's a hollowed out piece
[1:44:35] of granite and that's where the baby
[1:44:37] lambs are and they can wash them and
[1:44:38] keep them and and make sure that they're
[1:44:40] perfect. So, a manger is where you keep
[1:44:44] cows, but but that thing that he was put
[1:44:47] in was not a piece of wood. And if it's
[1:44:51] on it's online, just look it up. It's
[1:44:53] got to be true. It is true because I re
[1:44:56] researched it. It is where Bethlehem is
[1:44:58] where they had the greatest amount of
[1:45:00] perfect animals, perfect lambs for
[1:45:03] sacrifice cuz you got to have them. I
[1:45:05] mean, they're sacrificing all the time,
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; And they would put him on that. And you
[1:45:10] can see if you look it up, it's it's
[1:45:12] just about this big and it's hollowed
[1:45:14] out.
[1:45:16] So, the group from Ohio, they were
[1:45:18] having a um Christmas theme, you know,
[1:45:22] party and a show or put on production.
[1:45:27] [laughter] Brother Elisha sent me a
[1:45:28] message. He said, "Now, we got to get
[1:45:30] rid of this wood thing now. What are we
[1:45:32] going to do? [laughter]
[1:45:34] Where are we going to find a slab of
[1:45:35] granite?"
[1:45:37] I said, "Don't worry about it, brother.
[1:45:39] Just it's okay." But, you know, the
[1:45:41] things that we hear, we sometimes we
[1:45:43] don't research. We just go, "Yeah, well,
[1:45:45] he was born in a manger. he was born in
[1:45:46] a a bail of hay or you know that's not
[1:45:49] what it was. And the and the the where
[1:45:52] he was born was it wasn't a a stable
[1:45:55] like we think stable.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; It was a cave
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; built into the side of a mountain.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; He was buried in a cave inside of a
[1:46:07] mountain.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; He began that way. He ended that way.
[1:46:12] But praise God, he didn't stay that way.
[1:46:14] That's right.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; He came into mind in your heart. And now
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; we have the devil's answer.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; And you shall hear wars and rumors of
[1:46:23] wars. I'm not even going to get. So
[1:46:24] anyway, see that you be not troubled.
[1:46:28] Now listen. Hold on. Let's go back. This
[1:46:31] is Jesus talking to his 12 disciples.
[1:46:35] Judas ain't gonna make it.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Sorry. Judas ain't gonna make it. But
[1:46:40] the other 11 are just, you know, when
[1:46:42] are you coming back?
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; All right. When are these things going
[1:46:47] to happen?
[1:46:49] What's the sign of the end?
[1:46:51] [snorts]
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; He answered all three.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Then he comes back. Death, burial,
[1:46:58] resurrection. He comes back and gets
[1:47:00] ready to ascend. What do they ask him?
[1:47:03] When are you going to restore Israel?
[1:47:05] When are you going to DO THIS? WHEN?
[1:47:07] THEY UNDERSTAND WHERE HE SAID.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WASN'T FOR THEM.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BROWN SAYS IT AIN'T FOR YOU.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; It's for another group of people that's
[1:47:17] coming.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; For a special group of people.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He give it to us. COME ON
[1:47:24] PEOPLE. HE GAVE IT TO US.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Good Lord. You s watch a stinking
[1:47:29] football game yesterday watching some of
[1:47:31] them playoffs and I'm sorry that's
[1:47:34] that's one of my weaknesses.
[1:47:36] But I looked at them. There was one guy,
[1:47:39] his name was Sterling Sharp. He played
[1:47:41] football for University of Miami
[1:47:44] years ago. He's an old man. He acted
[1:47:47] like a 12-y old.
[1:47:49] When Miami scored that touchdown, he was
[1:47:53] I'm going to get in my Aaron mode now.
[1:47:54] He was
[1:47:57] screaming. GOT DOWN ON HIS KNEES AND
[1:47:59] WOW, like worshiping.
[1:48:01] And we go, "Praise the Lord. [snorts]
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; Got the great Got the greatest message
[1:48:08] there ever was. [laughter]
[1:48:10] [sighs and panting]
[1:48:11] Got Jesus in my heart.
[1:48:13] [snorts]
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; It would change if it was your favorite
[1:48:21] team.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; But that's what the world does. I mean,
[1:48:28] [snorts]
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; they go overboard.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; But I just want to get in your heart and
[1:48:34] you live it. Cuz see, they're going they
[1:48:35] just live like the devil anyway, but
[1:48:36] they going to live like the devil
[1:48:38] tomorrow. And when the ball game's over,
[1:48:39] they going to go back to living. Yeah.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; But this is eternal.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; This is something you can draw from
[1:48:46] every day. Everything you need is right
[1:48:49] here. You just draw from that source.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; So, here's Jesus standing here talking
[1:48:55] to them. They're asking him the
[1:48:57] questions and he's telling them the
[1:48:58] whole answer. And then when they get to
[1:49:00] the very end
[1:49:03] over here when he ascends, they ask him
[1:49:06] about basically the same questions.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; When are you going to take over? When
[1:49:10] you going to do this, when you going to
[1:49:11] do that?
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; He just shakes his head and goes on into
[1:49:16] glory. Cuz remember what he said, we
[1:49:18] won't read it, but where Jesus washes
[1:49:20] the feet and he says, "Now you'll not
[1:49:22] understand now, but you will hereafter."
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Because there was a lot of things they
[1:49:25] were going to understand. But now
[1:49:26] remember, I want you to remember one
[1:49:28] thing.
[1:49:29] This message that Jesus preached in
[1:49:31] Matthew 24 was so special.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; The disciples never preached it.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; That's the opening of the seals.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; They didn't get it.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; And there stood the headstone right
[1:49:52] there in front of them telling them the
[1:49:53] who the six are,
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; the six seals. And there stood number
[1:49:57] seven telling them
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; WHERE I'M AT, WHAT I'M GOING TO DO, WHAT
[1:50:01] THE DEVIL'S GOING TO DO, WHAT I'M going
[1:50:03] to do.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; And they missed it completely.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN brother Ram stood there on the
[1:50:10] six on the questions and answers, he
[1:50:11] said, "IT'S NOT FOR YOU."
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; You know why he said it's not for you?
[1:50:16] It's just the same thing with Jesus
[1:50:17] standing there telling them all that
[1:50:19] because brother Ram said, and I've got
[1:50:20] it on here. We'll read it maybe whatever
[1:50:21] Sunday we're done coming back here. But
[1:50:24] he said,
[1:50:26] Jesus said, he said, "These is what's
[1:50:28] this is what's going to happen." Brother
[1:50:29] Ram says, "Okay, this is all this is
[1:50:30] what's going to happen,
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; right?"
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; And they're like, "We don't get it. We
[1:50:36] don't understand."
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; But Brother Ram knew that because
[1:50:40] Brother Ram asked him, he said, I think
[1:50:42] it was on the fourth seal. He said,
[1:50:44] "Look, we're going to have we're going
[1:50:45] to have a prayer line, remember?" He
[1:50:47] said, "We're going to have questions and
[1:50:48] answers." He said, "Make it on the I got
[1:50:51] to read that."
[1:50:53] So, listen now. Listen to how this is
[1:50:55] William Brandom.
[1:50:57] All right. This is a guy that he's here
[1:51:02] for a purpose
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; to call a group of people. All right.
[1:51:06] Everybody with me?
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Let me get let me get down here.
[1:51:12] Excuse me for a minute. I want to read
[1:51:13] it while you say it.
[1:51:20] Okay, right here this the scripture I
[1:51:22] wrote for John 13:7. Jesus answered and
[1:51:25] said unto them, "What I do, thou knowest
[1:51:27] not." Now, this is in the footwashing,
[1:51:29] "but thou shalt know hereafter." Then
[1:51:32] Peter said, "Thou shalt never wash my
[1:51:33] feet." Don't ever tell Jesus never
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; because he'll embarrass you. But on the
[1:51:38] fourth seal, now watch he said, 'Now in
[1:51:40] studying this, now don't forget now
[1:51:42] Sunday or Sunday morning, we omitted the
[1:51:45] healing service because of having the
[1:51:47] answers to the people's question. Now
[1:51:49] watch what he wanted. This is what he
[1:51:51] wanted.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to have a question on
[1:51:55] these seven seals.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; If it's bothering you, something that
[1:52:00] you don't understand, let's have it on
[1:52:03] the seven seals. Then I can tell my
[1:52:05] Saturday night whether it's enough to
[1:52:07] answer them or not. You see? And then
[1:52:09] just now, now watch. He tells them, "Do
[1:52:11] not ask about I had a dream."
[1:52:16] All right. And then just now say, "Well,
[1:52:19] about something else or or should I do
[1:52:21] this or or or my I had a dream." Them
[1:52:24] them's all worthy things. Now remember,
[1:52:26] they're worthy things, but let's stay
[1:52:28] right with the seven seals.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; That's what we're right on. That's what
[1:52:32] the meeting is designed to do. The seven
[1:52:35] seals. Let's stay right with that
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; now. The day he had questions and
[1:52:40] answers, he got two questions on the
[1:52:42] seals and 26 questions on should women
[1:52:45] wear pajamas.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Explain the new birth. Explain father,
[1:52:53] son, holy ghost is not the right
[1:52:54] baptism. And of course, he explains them
[1:52:56] all. But by that time, you know what he
[1:52:58] says?
[1:53:00] He read them questions before he came
[1:53:02] out and that's when he told him. He
[1:53:04] said, "You're not getting this."
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's not for you either." I
[1:53:09] believe the Lord revealed it to him that
[1:53:10] it was not for them.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; If not, then that would have been it
[1:53:13] would have drove me crazy.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Knowing that that week was the greatest
[1:53:17] week of ministry, he said, I've ever had
[1:53:19] in my life.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; And [snorts] nobody understood what he's
[1:53:22] talking about. Jesus standing here,
[1:53:26] I'm the Messiah.
[1:53:28] I'm here to save you and I'm here to
[1:53:31] give you this revelation and you're
[1:53:33] still wanting to know, am I going to
[1:53:34] destroy Rome?
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; That's what they were asking him.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Remember somebody said, one of the
[1:53:40] commentators said they wanted Jesus just
[1:53:41] grab a big sword out and just, you know,
[1:53:43] chunk all the Romans and throw them out
[1:53:45] and and then we're back to a millennium.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; No, they just missed the time of the
[1:53:50] millennium.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; It's later on down the road.
[1:53:54] But can you imagine a man right here? He
[1:53:58] says, [snorts] "Then also knowing right
[1:54:00] among you things are happening." I know
[1:54:03] you that you don't see it. See, I'm just
[1:54:08] positive that you don't see it. And you
[1:54:10] say, "Brother Brown, that's a hard thing
[1:54:11] for you to say that. I know it is." But
[1:54:14] look, let me just say this now. I
[1:54:17] suppose this is just tapes for oursel
[1:54:18] and so forth. Thank God it was for us.
[1:54:21] But let me say this that you don't get
[1:54:24] it.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; See, and you're not supposed to get it.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; So don't try to interpret anything. Of
[1:54:33] course, they didn't listen to that. They
[1:54:34] tried to interpret it, you know,
[1:54:36] polygamy and all that other junk as
[1:54:38] being the seals.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Don't try to put your interpretation to
[1:54:41] it. You only get further away. Take my
[1:54:44] advice. If you believe in me now, if God
[1:54:47] has given me favor in your sight and you
[1:54:48] know that them revelations and things,
[1:54:50] I've been here with you a long time and
[1:54:52] it's going and it's always been right
[1:54:55] now to double prove it right hooks right
[1:54:57] in with the word. See, you know, it's
[1:54:58] thus sayeth the Lord, it's proved to
[1:55:00] you. But they didn't know what he was
[1:55:02] talking about.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; So Jesus is out there preaching his
[1:55:04] heart out. Nobody understood what he was
[1:55:07] saying.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; When are you going to restore Israel?
[1:55:10] When are you going to do this? When are
[1:55:11] you going to do that? You know, and and
[1:55:14] We look at what brother Brandon went
[1:55:16] through. We don't look what Jesus went
[1:55:17] through. I want us not to go through
[1:55:19] that here
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; all over the whole bride of Jesus
[1:55:23] Christ. We got to get this or we don't
[1:55:25] make it to the body change.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to get it
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; because it's been spoke.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody will.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; But remember,
[1:55:37] Judas was among that group.
[1:55:43] and stayed there
[1:55:47] until the crucifixion
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; right up to the time because remember he
[1:55:50] hung yourself and then Jesus got put on
[1:55:52] the cross right that's how close it is
[1:55:55] he was sitting right there eating the
[1:55:58] same food I'm talking about everything
[1:56:01] everything he ate was right there with
[1:56:04] them he was among them and he deceived
[1:56:07] every one of them but the son of man
[1:56:11] we're going to stop right here cuz it's
[1:56:12] it's Hot up here, too.
[1:56:15] It's just 70°.
[1:56:17] Boy, if I was jumping around for my
[1:56:19] favorite team, I'd probably be sweating
[1:56:21] all over the place. This is my favorite
[1:56:23] team.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; And I am sweating a little bit.
[1:56:27] [applause]
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; So, we look, but we'll close right here.
[1:56:31] I We'll get started somewhere else.
[1:56:34] We're just on the red horse. But each
[1:56:36] one of these horses are a symbol of a
[1:56:39] power
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; that Satan is using.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Red or white, red, black, and pale. Now,
[1:56:48] what is a pale horse? It's all three of
[1:56:50] these wrapped up together.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; If you'll do that sometime, take white
[1:56:56] paint, red paint, and black paint, put
[1:56:59] it in a bucket, and stir it up. It's the
[1:57:01] most putrid, ugly looking color you'll
[1:57:03] ever see in your life. But that's what
[1:57:05] the pale horse is in this day and age
[1:57:08] right here.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; It's all culminating into one.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Well, let me tell you something else.
[1:57:14] There's a church. There's a bride that
[1:57:17] has a real white horse.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; It's called justification.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; We have a real red horse which is
[1:57:24] sanctification.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; We have a real black horse. You say
[1:57:27] that's bad. No, it ain't because you got
[1:57:29] to die.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; You got to die. The Holy Ghost, you got
[1:57:32] to die. Or if you ain't dead, then who's
[1:57:35] alive?
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; And then what? The fourth thing is all
[1:57:39] that wrapped up into one and we get out
[1:57:42] of here.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, the rapture takes place on
[1:57:44] the fourth seal.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; And we'll explain all that. But re
[1:57:48] remember if brother Brandham can tell
[1:57:50] us, we ought to be able to preach it.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; I believe the seals are open. I believe
[1:57:55] that we can read the book just like
[1:57:56] brother Random did the Bible
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; and then we can take the prophet's
[1:58:00] message and we can mesh them together.
[1:58:02] Amen.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's what Jesus did. Now remember
[1:58:04] though, Jesus preached the seals in a
[1:58:07] symbol form and he was pointing towards
[1:58:10] something
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; cuz I I don't have it in here, but
[1:58:14] remember after he got finished with the
[1:58:17] sixth seal,
[1:58:21] he stopped
[1:58:23] and he said, "Now let's look at the fig
[1:58:25] tree."
[1:58:29] Because remember, six seals finish his
[1:58:31] redemption.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; The seventh is his coming.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; He was standing there already on earth.
[1:58:37] He went through all these and the last
[1:58:39] thing he said, he said, "Oh, oh,
[1:58:43] there's a parable of a fig tree
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; that we need to talk about."
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; So, he diverted every bit of that back
[1:58:50] to Israel. Well, guess what we're doing
[1:58:52] when we get finished here? Not here, not
[1:58:54] here physically. when we get finished
[1:58:55] into Revelation, this all is going to
[1:58:58] Israel
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; to two prophets. No Gentiles are going
[1:59:03] over there. Sorry about that.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; I was listening coming back from
[1:59:07] Kentucky the other day where brother
[1:59:08] Brandham uh he was preaching. He said,
[1:59:10] "Oh," he said, "That's my ministry." You
[1:59:11] know, he went to Egypt,
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; He thought he was going to take him out.
[1:59:16] If he would have done that, he'd have
[1:59:17] broke every scripture in the Bible
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; and there would have been a a rapture of
[1:59:21] a bunch of Jews,
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; right? And I don't mean that bad, but
[1:59:24] there'd be a rapture of them and not us.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Cuz a prophet goes to them. They'll
[1:59:28] believe the prophet if he'd have went
[1:59:29] over there. Yeah. They'd have believed
[1:59:32] it. Cuz when Moses and Elijah goes over
[1:59:34] there and type or in spirit, they going
[1:59:36] to believe him. It's only going to take
[1:59:38] them three and a half years. It's took
[1:59:40] us 60
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; to figure this thing out. And we ain't
[1:59:43] got it all figured out yet.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; But in three and a half years, it's
[1:59:47] going to be like boom boom boom boom
[1:59:48] boom boom.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; But it's Listen, it's this message. It
[1:59:51] is not a Baptist message, a Pentecostal
[1:59:54] message. This message right here,
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; this message through two prophets
[1:59:59] revealing Jesus Christ to a bunch of
[2:00:02] people that didn't care about him to
[2:00:04] begin with.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; They still looking for him, folks.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; They're still looking for Christ.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; That's why they're going to say, "Oops,
[2:00:14] we're in trouble.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; He's already We're looking for him. He's
[2:00:17] already come. He's already been through
[2:00:19] seven church ages. He's already been
[2:00:21] through a prophet in the end time, our
[2:00:23] Elijah.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; And they're looking for their Elijah.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; And he'll [snorts] come.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; No doubt. Let's stand to our feet. He'll
[2:00:33] come. But it will come from this message
[2:00:36] right here. And it will come to them no
[2:00:39] sooner.
[2:00:42] It will be when we are ready and take a
[2:00:45] rapture.
[2:00:46] He will not deal with the Jews until
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; you and I are out of here.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; Joseph sent his gentile bride to the
[2:00:55] palace before he revealed himself to his
[2:00:57] brothers.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; So they were in that palace. She was in
[2:01:02] that palace with the two kids they had.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; And then he comes down and he reveals
[2:01:07] himself to little Benjamin, which is the
[2:01:10] type of the what? 144,000. Cuz Benjamin
[2:01:12] was his brother,
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; real brother by blood. The rest of them
[2:01:15] were concubines and different things,
[2:01:17] but Joseph and uh and Benjamin were true
[2:01:20] brothers. So, but Lord, you could you
[2:01:23] could preach on that a long time, too.
[2:01:24] But God bless you.
[2:01:27] Appreciate you. Just listen to what?
[2:01:29] Don't listen to me. I said a long time
[2:01:32] ago, I wish to God that you could put a
[2:01:34] screen across or or a curtain across
[2:01:37] here and just listen to the voice of the
[2:01:39] person.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Not look at the humanity and look at the
[2:01:43] how I do things and how I look and how I
[2:01:45] act. Just listen to the words.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; Just listen to the voice of God talking
[2:01:50] to you.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Now, if you'll do that, then you'll shed
[2:01:53] all that other stuff
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; and God will really be able to speak to
[2:01:56] you. Amen.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Then you got to love me.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's inside of me, too.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; You might not like my quirks every once
[2:02:10] in a while, but Brother Gabriel does. He
[2:02:12] likes me.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe his wife. Jury's out, but maybe
[2:02:19] Sister Rebecca.
[2:02:21] Lord, I've known them since they were
[2:02:23] all little little kids. She now they got
[2:02:26] now they got big kids.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Thomas
[2:02:30] Shorty.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; It's good to see these kids come up.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; It's good to see them come up and and be
[2:02:37] around, sing, worship,
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; be in service,
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; and grow up
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; like them were baby babies.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know what? until the Lord
[2:02:51] comes. We're just going to keep carrying
[2:02:53] on.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Okay? We're gonna keep going on. We're
[2:02:56] going to keep trying our best. We're
[2:02:58] going to keep trying. We're going to
[2:03:00] keep trying to number one, expose the
[2:03:03] devil.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Expose him for what he is.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; And then what? Then put Jesus Christ in
[2:03:11] the forefront. Because a lot of times we
[2:03:12] don't. A lot of times we put Come on.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; We get in the way a lot. Well, is it us
[2:03:17] or is it the devil? The devil knows if
[2:03:19] he can get you to re to believe him,
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; he's got you.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; But somewhere in there, there's got to
[2:03:28] be something inside of you. Like brother
[2:03:30] Ram said, he said, "The devil told me
[2:03:32] the truth."
[2:03:34] Remember when the devil told him in his
[2:03:35] ear, he said, "Your baby's dying. Your
[2:03:38] wife's dying dead. Your baby's dying.
[2:03:41] What are you going to do?" He said, "I
[2:03:43] almost listened to what he said."
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; He was a prophet. You would have thought
[2:03:48] there was angels hovered over brother
[2:03:50] Brana, but no, he was a human
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; in a situation as Job. And then
[2:03:58] Satan couldn't understand when when when
[2:04:00] brother Ram just looked over to the side
[2:04:02] and he said, "Though God slay me,
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; yes,
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; yet I'll trust him."
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away.
[2:04:10] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we've got to be.
[2:04:15] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Every
[2:04:17] trial we go through,
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; it's the Lord. IF YOU'RE A CHILD of his,
[2:04:22] why will he give you a stone if you ask
[2:04:24] for bread? Why will he give you a
[2:04:26] scorpion if you ask for other something
[2:04:28] else? He can't do that. He'll let you go
[2:04:30] through things, but remember, they're
[2:04:32] light afflictions.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; We're trying to escape a place
[2:04:37] that's going to be horrible.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Horrible. You'll never know. And I hope
[2:04:43] you don't ever know.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; If you're a bride of Jesus Christ, you
[2:04:45] will never know. Amen.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; The torment that's going to be. And then
[2:04:49] one day, I like what Kurt Cameron said.
[2:04:52] Finally, he's he is just standing up. I
[2:04:54] mean, he they keep bashing him inside
[2:04:56] the head, but he's like, "No." [snorts]
[2:04:58] He said, "You ain't going to burn
[2:05:00] eternally." He said, "You're going to
[2:05:01] burn up one day,
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; right?"
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; And that's what you'll do. Think about
[2:05:05] it. You exist as a human being right
[2:05:08] now. All of you, we're all human beings.
[2:05:10] We all have family, past, we all have
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; memories.
[2:05:17] One day, if you're not born again, you
[2:05:20] just disappear,
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; like you never was to begin with.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; To me, that's horrible.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Because the bride, now we ain't going to
[2:05:30] remember the real bad things, but we're
[2:05:31] going to remember the things that we
[2:05:32] were down here. We're going to remember
[2:05:34] that we were human beings. We're going
[2:05:35] to remember we went through trials and
[2:05:36] tribulations because that's that's our
[2:05:38] testimony, right? Because the angels,
[2:05:41] they're just going to stand there and
[2:05:42] go, "I don't know what you're going
[2:05:43] through. I never was that way. And you
[2:05:46] say, and you say, "Oh, man. If it hadn't
[2:05:48] been for that guy right over there on
[2:05:50] that throne,
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; if it hadn't been for him, I'd have
[2:05:53] never made it."
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Put your eyes on Jesus,
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; not [snorts] on another man.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Let's sing a song. God bless you.
[2:06:04] [music]
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; From every sin,
[2:06:08] have the Holy Spirit constantly within.

[2:09:16] let the Holy Ghost come in. [music]
[2:09:21] Orlando.
[2:09:23] Even if you got the Holy Ghost, let him
[2:09:25] come on in a little bit more. Let him
[2:09:27] come on in a little more.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Take over a little more of me. Get rid
[2:09:32] of me.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; And let him one more time. Let's let him
[2:09:35] let him in. Oh, let the Holy Ghost come
[2:09:40] in.

[2:12:36] within.
[2:12:38] Thank God. [music]
[2:12:40] Trust in God and then let the Holy
[2:12:44] [music] Ghost coming.
[2:12:48] Oh, let the Holy Ghost come.
[2:12:53] Oh, let the Holy Ghost come.
[2:12:59] Make the consecration.
[2:13:01] Trust in God and the let the Holy Ghost

[2:13:10] Let the Holy [music] Ghost come in.
[2:13:15] Let the Holy Ghost come [music] in.
[2:13:20] Make the consecration.
[2:13:23] Trust in God and
[2:13:25] let the Holy Ghost come in.
[2:13:31] And do you want the fire of God to fill
[2:13:34] your soul?
[2:13:36] Burn up all [music] the cross and
[2:13:39] sanctify the hole. Make the
[2:13:42] consecration.
[2:13:44] Trust in God and me. Let the Holy Ghost
[2:13:49] come in.
[2:13:51] [music and singing] Oh, let the Holy
[2:13:54] Ghost come in.
[2:13:57] Let the Holy Ghost come in.
[2:14:03] Make the consecration.
[2:14:05] Trust in God and then let the Holy Ghost
[2:14:10] come in.
[2:14:13] Amen. What a simple thing. You know,
[2:14:16] he's he's wanting to knock on the door.
[2:14:19] He knocks. All you got to do is open the
[2:14:21] door.
[2:14:23] I like that uh message brother Vine
[2:14:25] preached without money and without
[2:14:27] price.
[2:14:29] What a powerful message
[2:14:32] that this world and I'm not I'm not
[2:14:34] belittling anyone [music] that likes to
[2:14:36] make money cuz money in your pocket
[2:14:38] makes you feel better. Okay? But when we
[2:14:41] make it our God
[2:14:43] and we build up a kingdom here and we
[2:14:46] let our kingdom in heaven starve
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; or go [music] bankrupt.
[2:14:52] But there's no price. There's no price
[2:14:54] to this.
[2:14:56] The only thing we got to do is just
[2:14:58] yield to him and live. He's already
[2:14:59] wrote the Listen, prescriptions written.
[2:15:02] And And brothers and sisters, he can't
[2:15:04] change this.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; So he's not going to in the middle of a
[2:15:08] in the middle of a trial, he's going to
[2:15:09] go, "No, I don't. No, don't trust this.
[2:15:12] I'm going to give you another." No, he's
[2:15:13] got this right here.
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; This is the thing we need. And then when
[2:15:20] we have this, brother Manuel, when we
[2:15:22] have this, it'll point us to the message
[2:15:25] of the hour.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; And then we'll have more clarity and
[2:15:28] we'll have the between the lines that
[2:15:30] Jesus was telling. Cuz remember, he I'm
[2:15:33] going to start preaching again. He was
[2:15:35] preaching the seals to us.
[2:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; That was my WHOLE POINT. HE WASN'T
[2:15:40] PREACHING IT TO THEM. BROTHER BRANDHAM
[2:15:41] WASN'T PREACHING the seals to those
[2:15:42] people sitting in that auditorium. HE
[2:15:44] WAS PREACHING THEM TO US.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. cuz he didn't say now
[2:15:48] nobody's ever going to get it. No, he
[2:15:51] said you're not going to get it and
[2:15:53] you're not supposed to get it. But
[2:15:56] there's a group that'll get it.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus has got more patience than we do
[2:16:01] cuz he knew they weren't going to get
[2:16:02] it.
[2:16:04] He's going to have to die though so they
[2:16:06] could try to get it.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; And we have to die to oursel so that we
[2:16:11] can get it. That's all we got to do. die
[2:16:14] to oursel and we can get it. If we put
[2:16:18] self in the way, we always fail.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Don't ever say I did something.
[2:16:25] No, you say Lord willing I'll do this or
[2:16:29] the Lord did this for me or the Lord
[2:16:31] even in a trial
[2:16:33] say the Lord this did this for me. Hey,
[2:16:36] listen. remember brother Louise and
[2:16:37] Sister Christine and the girls. Maybe
[2:16:40] they'll quit traveling one day and but
[2:16:43] but Sister Christine's going to see her
[2:16:44] family and we sure we sure love her
[2:16:46] family and appreciate them [music] and
[2:16:48] uh we appreciate them letting her gold
[2:16:50] come back.
[2:16:52] Same way with Joe and and Rachel.
[2:16:54] They're on their way to New Mexico to
[2:16:56] her family. So [music] if we can get all
[2:16:57] them people to move out here like
[2:16:59] somebody else's.
[2:17:01] Hello somebody.
[2:17:03] [clears throat]
[2:17:04] I need to stop before I start saying
[2:17:07] anything again. I guess I'll just
[2:17:10] I guess not. It's in my heart.
[2:17:14] I love family. Y'all know we we love
[2:17:16] [music] family and I love my church
[2:17:18] family. I love to be around believers.
[2:17:21] Why would you want to be around
[2:17:23] a bunch of drunks? And
[2:17:27] I don't feel comfortable.
[2:17:30] I don't feel if you feel comfortable
[2:17:33] in your world,
[2:17:36] you in pro, you [music] got a problem.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; I just don't feel comfortable
[2:17:42] because I'm like Abraham.
[2:17:44] I'm looking for a city whose builder and
[2:17:48] maker is God. And what brother say? He
[2:17:50] said Abraham didn't know it, but he was
[2:17:52] standing right on top of the city he was
[2:17:54] looking for.
[2:17:55] Well, we're looking for a city, but we
[2:17:58] got all the parts right here.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Cuz you are that future home.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Made without nails,
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; made without hammers,
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; made by blood,
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; made by the blood of an innocent one.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; That died so that you can have eternal
[2:18:16] life. Oh, praise the Lord. Let's [music]
[2:18:19] sing something as we get ready to go.
[2:18:21] [clears throat]
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a fellowship. You have a
[2:18:24] wonderful Christmas.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Call somebody that you've never called
[2:18:28] before in years. Call them and say,
[2:18:30] "Hey, how you doing?"
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; What a blessed.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; You'll sure be good if you'll do that
[2:18:39] from your heart.
[2:18:40] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You're dismissed.
[2:18:43] Oh,

[2:18:47] [music]

[2:19:46] arm. Now what have I to dread? What have
[2:19:52] I to fear leing on me everlasting
[2:19:57] God?
[2:19:59] I have blessed peace with my Lord's
[2:20:03] supping [music]
