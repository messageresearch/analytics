Dimension see you're not going to be able to catch with these sentences here Electronics the Ethereal waves things like that but but uh it's going to slow down and it's going to catch us up into it and boy it's we'll be off and running then trust you're off and run you're off and running now run this race with patience amen we have a great cloud of witnesses that can pass about us today amen we're so blessed today to be able to have brother uh Sam Dale pastor of the Spoken Word Church in Lula Georgia been here once before matter of fact it was about this time last year I think it wasn't brother Dale that's when brother Dale's here you know the deer is running down in sedan and so he brother waiter here and there and uh they've been hunting and uh so uh he's taken time out of his uh busy hunting schedule to come by and Minister for us today and I certainly appreciate that with all of my heart I do appreciate the uh the ministry the gifts that God has placed in his church and we recognize brother Dale's gift it's been a blessing to us and uh we want to just turn the service over to him and uh give him freedom and liberty to minister the word of the Lord to the people of God Amen you know I don't know that song well enough to sing it again and it's every vestage of it is gone so I'll just turn it over now brother Dale brother Dale God bless you you're all hooked up I think you turned on there now we got it amen God bless you we send you greetings from all of our church in Georgia and I would ask you to remember my wife she wound up she has migraine headaches and she had one last night and she had to stay at home this morning wasn't able to go to church so remember her she'll you know she's fought the Battle with them for years and they're getting better but that's you know that's one of the those things but good to be here always good to be here we had a wonderful time when brother Jim came out and preached for us and all and just we really enjoyed it I enjoy the the word of the Lord don't you so let's just go into the scriptures if you'd like to turn in the scripture to follow along with us turn to Joshua 10 Joshua 10 and we'll begin reading about verse 12 and then we'll get over to Hebrews 1 so Joshua 10 Hebrews 1 I'm just the kind of a guy that I like to speak to people and and I like to get you to thinking yes I don't like to see you standing there with a blank face and you know I mean I'd rather see you frowning than to see you with just blank I'd rather see you saying what in the world is this guy talking about than to just I don't care what he says you but uh I like to get you to think because that means that God can speak to you brother around and said a minister had only one thing a gift and he said that gift was to get to block that spell that Satan has over your eyes right he said where God can speak to you thank you Lord so that's all the gift is for and that's what we're doing okay let's pray father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for this day and this opportunity and Lord we love you and we pray that you would just come this day now and speak to us touch her wife Lord and let everything be well and be with the the church there we know they're already in service and just bless and take care of everything be with Wade over at Bartlesville AR with brother Claud and him and just bless and just let your love be made manifest with each one of us as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts because we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen and I came off and had to bar glasses cuz mine's left in the cabin so if I don't read right it'll be Jim's fault you know reading through other people's glces you know all right verse 12 very familiar with everybody then spake Joshua hey man I can read it here I didn't have to need no glasses brother J okay all right then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel son stand thou still over upon gibon and thou moon in the valley of adelon and the sun Stood Still and the moon stayed until the people had avenge themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of jasher so the son stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day there was was no day like now get this point and there was no day like that day before it or after it that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel now let's go over to Hebrews very familiar everybody knows it all right God who at Su times and diverse maners spake in times past in the fathers by the prophets so you know what's the prophet of God said he spake in the prophets that word by should have been translated in but it's fine because it's okay all right and hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things but whom also he made the worlds amen you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now you know mankind says they can't trust the Bible because it was written by man well you know that's right in a degree of pinning it uh speaking it you know bringing it to us uh those things are true but we read in the Bible that God LED those men amen see all right so now don't misunderstand me when we get on over into the message in a minute of anything you'd think I'm trying to say I say what I mean and I mean what I say as whether it's good or bad that's the way I am I just say what I mean so don't try to figure out what I'm talking about just listen all right and see we know that the Bible then was brought to us by prophets man brought the Bible to us God used that man all right now it was at one time there even with Moses you remember that uh God wanted to speak to all of Israel but they they chose for a man to speak to them all right so then God said okay that's the way I'll do it I'll do it through man I'll bring it to you and I'll and see then we are the ones that chose it you say I wasn't back there to do that but we were because we're human all right and when they chose that that put us in a category to where we must believe what man says now if the man's wrong it proves to be wrong we don't believe him right I mean sensible if it's something out of the Bible it's not right there's doctrines trinities Etc that were taught by man that we don't believe but that was days gone by we're supposed to be today to where that we can believe the word of the Lord would you notice there in verse 14 as I emphasize it said God hearkened to the voice of a man now you know I I believe it this way and this is the way I've always taught it to my people when brother Jim came out and spoke to us I invited him to come I believe the Lord LED it and all like that and you know I believe that's God's way of speaking right if I hadn't I wouldn't have called him okay I believe that's the way of God speaking so then there wasn't 10 other guys supposed to come in and preach you know I mean it wouldn't have mattered to me and you know if if brother Jim was scheduled to preach and and and uh Obama wanted to come I I'd have said sorry I got a speaker scheduled you know I don't care about what you believe or whatever but I got somebody schedule cuz I believe that's God's way of speaking is through man sure to us right now that's my whole point right now remember and we're going to going to get some scriptures in a minute to bring out something and I have a odd way of approaching something so follow the approach and after a while I say okay now you ready here's what I got to say okay all right now even in the writing of the Bible I'm believing cuz some of these notes I I had to write I getting here and changed a few things but I believe it's in the second seal that brother brandom said that God gave to Moses a thought he said first it was God's thought he said he gave it to Moses as a thought he said it was not the word he said but then when Moses spoke it it was the word so you understand that the word was written before the world and coming down that's the point that the prophet received the thought what how did um how did Abraham say why did he say I'll give you a tenth of the spoil I mean what what was that number off the top of his head well then we pay a 10% TI don't we right I mean see that would fit together that God before the world transmitted down through the the to Abraham and he just didn't pick up a number and say well I'll give you 10% right you already gave him 90 you know but see but when it was finished it's in God's word then it all fits all the way through and then you'll see that it's been God the whole time leading the writing of the Bible that's my whole point amen all right so then it was not the word until Moses spoke it out right then it became words unto us all right now what about that man now that walked out there one day and he said I know he done it through through Aaron but he went out there and he said let there be flies and they came Let There Be fleas frogs Etc it came right by the words of a man the Bible said that he plagued Egypt with his word actually through Moses he plagued Egypt with the words from a man right now that's that's the point I want you to look at and let's turn over now to another scripture and pick it up look at Exodus 32 all right Exodus 32 we'll begin reading about 30 now I got a slide way of sliding things in I say that to where you remember what I get when I get back to it after a while and I'll put my point in and then I want you to catch it and if you don't catch it I'll come back and tell you what it is but then you can look on people's faces and they go see they getting the point okay I'm I'm carnal I know but that's just me forgive me but look look what he says in verse now 30 of Exodus 32 and it came to pass on tomorrow that Moses said unto the people now you know what this was was the golden CF situation and all of that you know look what he said he said unto people you have a great sin and now I will go up unto the Lord PR Adventure I shall make an atonement for your sins now remember that Moses making atonement Moses returned unto the Lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou will not forgive them their sin if not BL me I pray thee out of thy book which thou has written and you we know what happened God told Moses said okay I won't kill him he said I'll deal with him and he did he said they won't go into the land but they'll go up to it they'll get around it yeah they won't be able to go in right but he said now I'm going to spare them now now I know so many thousand that day but the biggest portion of Israel out of the some 2 million they went right on their Journey going on towards the promised land all right now we know what brother brandham has said about this of reading the scripture you know blot my name out and uh I don't feel on some of these I have to give you all of it because I'm standing before congregation as well taught and you'll know even the quote and we were laughing want to go about my cut and paste really is cut and tape all right they laugh at me at home but we get it done now we know that brother brandham said that he even had trouble with the fact that Moses could tell God a better way of doing something don't know he said if you blot them out blot me out all right so we know that that was not Moses brother Brandon said on the message souls in prison paragraph 77 or 1 117 he said that always puzzled me how that God could tell Moses Moses could tell God a better way than God had till I found out that it was the spirit of Christ in Moses all now we're back in Hebrews 1 right that God in the prophets spoke to man so we're not putting the honor upon the man the honor is going upon the god that would speak but you can't leave the man out of the situation it can't be done it's got to be left out way so he says you know if you're going to do that block my name out all right but now listen to this one this is take looking looking to Jesus which is paragraph 83 the brothers are putting them up and they're real good at that and as they do it at home I hand them these you know but I didn't hand these so they're they're getting ahead of me okay but look what he says and there was another one that puzzled me that was when Moses paragraph 85 could tell God a better way than God knowed how to do anything when Moses said the people will say you're God God was able to bring you out but not able to keep you and Moses threw himself in the breach then later I found out that Moses that that was Christ and Moses standing for the people now we'll get to it in a minute that's actually quoting numbers 14 all right the one we read was Exodus now we we'll get to numbers 14 in a minute and you'll see but see just don't don't lose the point I I tell you that because see that's actually in numbers 14 all right which is another situation that Moses has to do the same thing but this is what I like he said in modern events made clear by prophecy paragraph 57 that he's the same yesterday today and forever he said it was Christ in Noah it was Christ in Moses it was Jesus Christ in David it was Jesus Christ in Joseph it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and it's Jesus Christ among his people today doing the same thing that he promised he' do in that age all right so now we know the story then that the real man is the man God you know himself speaking through a man but he doesn't do anything apart from man right okay so now watch the point as we begin to just lay it down just a little bit even God allows a man brother brand on The Sixth Seal he said he was out there and and God was revealing those things to him and listen to a prophet I don't have this quote but he said God I can't tell them that yeah a man that could have such a connection to the mind of God that he could say as Jos as Moses would say you blot them out blot me out he wasn't playing games his life was on the line right but he knew how to deal because over numbers when we read that in a minute you'll see it a little better he knew how to deal with God and there in numbers he says now it will be said that's the quote of again that you could bring them out but you couldn't take them in he he knew how to deal with it now this may be carnal to you but even balum with a prophetic gift he could not curse Israel right right cuz God said you can't do it right but with that gift in the presence of the Eternal God he could back out of and tell bik I can't curse him but I tell you how to get them defeated just get them Moab about women over with them get them men around them Moab about women because they were pretty and the Israeli women wasn't too pretty cuz they're out there living in the deserts and like and you know the story so he goes and they get him there but now I I don't lay it all against all things but I just put it all together you know a lot of those Israelite women wanted to look like him Moab about women that's why you got them painting their faces and all today you know they still want to be the mo about women but just making that point but just think Moses said God they will say you were able to bring them out but not able to take them in and you know what Moses what God told Moses turn over there to numbers 14 and see what he told him and we won't have to read all of it to get down because you got the story in of It Go Just Right Back above in verse 13 14 15 but get down to verse 20 he said pardon I beseech Thee the iniquity of this people according unto to the greatness of thy mercy that's just after he's finished telling them they will say you could bring them out but you couldn't take you couldn't get them in so it's going to be against your name and we're going to read a quote in a minute where brother R said he promised him so Moses was reminding god of the promise so look what he says and as thou Hast forgiven this people from Egypt up until now you know in other words you've been forgiven them you go on down below here in the next verse or two you'll find that they sinned 10 times from the time they left the Red Sea or you know left Egypt to the to Cades Barne I think 10 times and you know God was ready to take them in you know the sin that kept Israel from going to the promised land the big one cadis barnea when he didn't believe God's word when he said I give you the land and God said that's it I can look over you here and look over you there and looked over you 10 times but you ain't going right because see they become unbelievers right but look what he says in verse 30 verse uh 20 and the Lord said I have pardoned according to Thy Word and what about the words of a man that he could so go before God get an audience with God he'd know the mind of God and know what he was fixing to do but yet he could turn around and use that gift that was in his life to be able to what would be a word for it I don't have any education but be able to bargain with God or deal with God or whatever words you would use you know he would be able to talk to him in plain language and said now look you blot their name blot mine out don't let it be said that you could bring them out cuz he knew they was out but said you can't take them in cuz you promised them You' take them in all right let's see what brother R had to say that's why I like to read what he has to say you knowen this is from the message presuming e24 you come on down watch what he says said he would have killed the whole world he said that was Christ and Moses he would have killed the world and everything but look Christ throwed himself in the breach for the whole human race we know that Moses thred himself in the breach for Israel and he said you made a promise God you made a promise that you'd take them to the land that's right what did Moses do to God now listen we're reading what he said what did Moses do to God when looked like God was going to do something contrary he throwed the word in his way I'm reading brother random it's up behind you here he throwed the word in his way see amen I love that brother R says I feel like shouting just talking about it put the word in the way God can't walk over his own word am all right said you promised to do it you said you would take them to the good land that was flowing with milk and honey I've told them what you said listen and here we are we're on your hands see he knew how to deal with God all right look on down to the next one the message on the second seal paragraph 54 right down at the bottom you get all of the coming down to it but and there Moses took the place of Christ then to throw himself in the breach and say don't do it Lord see and of and of course he after he'd ordained Moses to do this he didn't come over Moses this is brother randam saying it what he because he was acting like Christ in that time that was Christ in Moses he ordained Moses for the job and he wouldn't come over him right and we know he was kind of discontented with him back there when he smoked the rock right and we know that caused Moses to not get to be able to go to the promised land as a Walkin he was 800 years later coming into scripture but yet he wasn't able to go but you see he could he could go before God being a prophet that's why I mentioned balum balum could go before God he could see the Holiness and righteousness of God but he couldn't curse Israel but he could go before him and look at it and he'd say if I can just get them to do something wrong amen yeah you remember even balam was shown the hinder part in other words the worst thing that could be happening in Israel he said I don't see it he couldn't go over it but yet he come out of it with an understanding that's why brother random says you got the line the ox the man the eagle he said the man is shrewd he uses his mind you see it in the message you see preachers that they don't care what the word says they're using words to get the mind of the people right and they can get them on that side and they'll say well the brother is a wonderful brother yeah but he's off the message but but but he said he believed the prophet some people told my wife years ago this right we come in the message about a man named lry over in India and she said I'm I Dar say anything about him said cuz he's God said he's he's preaching he's God my wife she said does he believe brother R's message she said well no said he he he he he say his brother R was wrong you know and changing well wife said well I don't give a hoot I can say what I want to about him you know maybe she didn't use the word hoot that's son the language okay but the point she wasn't worried that's right if he was off the messag am amen but you see the shrewdness of man's mind man's words you can take a man's words and you can twist right you I know your pastor he knows the truth about any Doctrine you call the brother Brown's message and I'll give you a quote from Brother Brown I from memory that will sound like it's contrary is that true he said one day he said now you know he was always one true and living God he said one day let's stand and address the third person of the Trinity right now did he believe in a trinity no that was your Trinity he was telling you let's adj just the one you want to talk to yeah he didn't believe in it itself see but see man's words can be twisted and make things that's what they do in the message they take so much of the message and then they twist it to where just Twisted enough and then until now they're saying that even Jesus done wrong yeah great followings though you know well I'm just honest now if if I follow a doctorine I don't mind telling you I follow it no problem you ask me what I believe I'll tell you yeah and I won't sugarcoated either I'll tell you up front what I believe and I'll tell you why I don't believe something else you know see because that's just the words of a man all right but now look God has got to keep his promise look at the last quote we give you sir as we would see Jesus paragraph uh E36 he said if God don't keep his promise then it's not God's word god couldn't be God make a promise and did not keep it all right now at the words of a man God would spare Israel at the words of a man he would actually say I pardoned those people now without going back and reading it I want to just get the whole story now all that's background we read the scripture where that in Exodus 32 that after they had made the golden CF and the great sin Joshua said I'll go up before the Lord and said pre- Adventure I can make an atonement right now we deal with basically don't blot out and just blot out that's basically you're preaching from that point but I want you to think about what is an atonement it's a covering you know a lot of times Moses would tell Aaron say take your sensor run among the people you know and make an atonement all right there were more atonements than just a lamb or a goat or things like I said he tell Aaron said take take your censure run in off the fire and of the altar get that go among the people and make an atonement for him make a covering for him but I want to ask you a simple question this is a whole message is one nutshell what was the offering Moses made when he said I shall make an atonement what was the offering it was not far off the altar even though Aaron done that and that was it was not a ram a goat or a lamb or whatever what was the atonement it was his word excuse me right if was his word right he reminded god of what he had said right brother R said you find it in the Bible call God on the scene he'll do it because he said it he can't deny his word Moses never offered any animal he never even offered fire from the altar it was his word you blot them out blot me out same thing would be on over in numbers when he'd come to that place that he begin to deal with God and say God it'll be said that you could bring them out but you can't take them in so don't let that be said to keep your promise he reminded God of his word think about that the words of a man now we establish that that man speaking through Moses was Christ right speaking through Joshua was Christ but there was a connection to the human man that you cannot separate and I read you the quote or showed it to you there we did that he said he chose Moses for the job and he would not go over him right I know I'm carnal the way I speak but I like to make you think if Peter have said in Acts two repent every one of you and go off for a $10 bill that would have been what it was and if you got the Holy Ghost you'd have done that but he wasn't going to do it that way why because the mind of Christ Christ was in Peter to tell him what to do see the mind of Christ come through Moses and told God a better way of doing something the atonement Moses made was his own words yes that he took before the man so you know what we are built on the words of a man yes it said about brother Randon when he was talking on the sick seal he said Lord I can't tell him that what about I know this is going to be short and sweet so I like it what about a man that could stand in this day and said let there be squirrel God didn't tell him how to speak that he just told him what whatever you have need of speaking go through the life of brother brandham then of the things of the third pull and the things of speaking to the uh storms out of existence the uh you know the the the growth that was on his wife the the things that he spoke of sister had right took the words of a man that said I give you your children sure I heard years later and they I don't know about it they said they'd both be slid but that don't bother me how many times you ever backslid see brother random said it now that's not for everybody cuz brother Brown said it to the person but get the point what atonement do we need today what do we offer we don't go get a lamb and crucify it right right we've got God's word I thought we believed in like Romans 8:10 everywh it is in there that you believe in your heart right and confess with your mouth Yes you be saved right you know what you're doing you're reminding God of his word right he said if you do that in Acts two you'd be saved right repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ remission sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost promises to you and your children and far all you just reminding God right it it don't bother God for you to remind him what he said come on how many daddies in here especially granddaddies now that's the worst part but how many daddies in here your kid comes up and say you daddy you told me you know that you'd do that well we're as human sometimes we can't do it maybe but we should tell them so well we can't do it so but you told me you do it that's the way my kids always done me right they just come to me and they said daddy you told me we was going to do this are we going to do it or not they don't forget not no problems yeah well especially grandkids now they're they're they're in a greater higher category and Welly they can really get to you they don't even have to remind you of what you said yeah they just look at you and you just go do it come on do your granddaddies and everything else but you know my whole point is one thing a man with the word of God did brother Brandon make this statement he said a Believer with the word of God in his heart speaks that by faith he said it's deity speaking yes he yes he see it was Christ in Moses it was Christ in Joshua yeah it was Christ in brother brandham now I don't want to raise a hands cuz I don't do that but how many of us needed the grace of marriage and divorce amen have you ever noticed brother brandham said I say unto you right right said from what God showed me up right in that mountain you go back and you see Moses had a Grace you go back and you find out that Paul had a Grace at the words of a man we stand today at the words of a man that came that God Vindicated to to be the prophet of the hour that's why we don't look for another one right because there may be great anointings out there but they don't have a message right brother see you're right they don't have a message pointing you back to God they have a message pointing to their billfold and their own things but at the words of a man we stand on that every day yes I wasn't there when brother Brandon spoke squirrels was you I believe it happened why because of the message he preached would tell me that can be done that's right yeah that's right I wasn't there when Moses crossed the Red Sea now I know I we got the quotes brother R said I was back there with it you know what I'm talking about but you know what I'm saying you and I wasn't back there physically to walk across right I believe it happened am the reason I believe it happened is because just like brother brandham when he was preaching one day and he was bringing that out about Joshua you know and his son stood still and he said I'd love to have all afternoon he said or something to speak on and God Stood Still you know son stood still and he'd say look at uh the little woman with problems and she touched His Garment and said the son stood still see what about all those places in there where that God would step on the scene and to prove that he was God what about the The Prostitute that was brought before him and they said now the Bible says in other words to us the law says she's to be stoned what is your judgment he couldn't say I forgive her that would have been contrary to his own word so he couldn't do it but he knew how to take care of it yes he right so what'd he do he knew under the law if you had two or three Witnesses you'd Stone the person to death right right they just got rid of the witnesses right that's what he done he's got rid of the witnesses he just condemned them of what they were doing that's right they all walked away yeah he said who condemns you she said I don't have no condem he said neither do I go and sin no more that's right why because I believe Jesus was a man yes the flesh but in that flesh was almighty God am not the doctrines that's going today and that's all right that's their doctrines I got a i the other day I was down in the woods and I was reading on anointed once at the end time I don't see a lot of deer but I get to do a lot of reading huh but or listen to tapes cuz I got an iPod and I just stick it in I went through three tapes sitting there on this deer stand you know just listen to brother Brown my house slept through half of them and you know but I was reading on anointed once the end time you know and it really struck me he said those people can't help it don't throw off on somebody that doesn't believe like you believe cuz you know what they can't it that's right they've heard the words of a man in the wrong direction right they've listened to man Express things and they've went after the wrong thing but you know they can't help it right that's not going to save them not going to do it but I pray that God will be lenient yes you know yes because they're wonderful people but they're caught by man's ideas but my point was what what atonement did Moses give it was his word right he reminded God of his word yes yes marriage and divorce brother Randon spoke to us and he said I say well you know what you may not need the natural Grace of marriage and divorce but there's not a person in the world that didn't need the spiritual Grace right you may differ with me on that that's all right but even brother brandham carried a Baptist Bible and converted them to a Baptist Faith that's what he said we all need the grace of marriage and divorce have you ever thanked God have you ever repented for being in a denomination sometime you ever done that no the Holy Ghost led me out well okay have you ever thanked him for leading out have you ever just said Lord I was sincere there and I was I was 23 years old I was an ordained Deacon when I left the church I was teaching the adult Sunday school T the deacons and Elders that's what I was doing when I left they thought the world of me but you see when this message came I I couldn't do nothing but move I got up and told him in the church I got them told everybody I said I'm sorry I can't stay here I've got to move on yeah my brother came out and he said any minute he said what you going to do I said I don't know he said are you a preacher I said Heaven Help I surely don't know about that and uh he said well just stay and we'll build you a church and he meant it said we'll build you a church and my family would fill this church up my family would fill it up all right cuz I'm the baby of 13 right four died real early but n lived on got a big family all right but my point of what I'm saying I couldn't help it right couldn't help it friend of mine was speaking there not too long ago in the church where were used to go and I went to hear him I have no problem right I don't figure I backslid cuz I went back there I went to hear the man and encouraged him you know young kid coming up but you see the point of where I'm trying to get whether you like it or not you can say oh it's the Holy Ghost it's this you're you're built on the words of a man whether it be that or whether it be the quotes of a prophet and I sure like the atonement that the prophet made I may not have needed the natural but I surely needed the spiritual I made this statement I said Lord you've got me out of the Baptist now get the Baptist out of me you ever done that just say thank you Lord thank you for saving me there's not a day PES that I don't pray Lord thank you for saving me yes thank you for delivering BR me thank you for bringing me into the word at the words of a man I stood one day in a church told him I said Wade is backslid but he will come back I said leave what you want to Lord told me all right told my wife something one day I said that'll take place or I'll quit preaching she said well you just preached your last sermon she was honest she said you just preached your last sermon I said well okay but you know what happened but I'm just getting a point I come to my wife after Wade come back to the Lord before he came back I come to wife I said now this's uh little more been added to the story he said okay I said he's not only going to be coming back to the Lord but he's going to be preaching with me she said well okay you know well he's preaching with me my point is this we think that the word comes to the prophet now we know that I've established that established who it is is Christ and what's taking place right all right so you shouldn't have any open part or any problem with these statements but brother Brandon when we read one of those he said and he's still the same yesterday today and forever you know he's still using men to speak to us he's using a five-fold Ministry the Bible does not say that the prophet was made for the perfecting of the Saints it says a five-fold Ministry but now if that Pro if that five-fold Ministry Don't Preach what that Prophet said they're not a five-fold Ministry forget it you know that brother around said the five-fold ministry is predestinated eternally yes sir he said but the nine spiritual gifts in the church is not gifts and calling without repentance but he said the five full ministry cuz really see that's God we're built on the words of a man you know that sometimes brother Jim has to say something that probably if a lot of you heard it you wouldn't agree with him you'd probably condemn him but sometimes we ministers have to say things sometimes we have to speak things well I don't believe that brother Brandon was the only one that could speak the word I believe he come to bring a bride to the position they could speak the word absolutely well why can't you speak it for your family you got a child you got loved ones you got a husband or wife or whatever just out speak the word for them and say it and keep saying it till it comes to P cuz if you say it for a while and then say well I really don't know so you never did have it right to start with it wouldn't God but if you keep speaking it and it'll finally come to pass it be God that's the way I believe God I still believe he's speaking through a five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of the Saints see the words of a man and you know sisters now we we don't believe in women preachers right okay but brother R said you got your own pull pit at home with your children and see it's not just the words of a m n masculine you know that's why I read that in Hebrews he says what in this day he has spoken unto us through his son so it's the son in you that's why women preachers you know they say it a lot of times they say well I've got god in me I got a man in me why can't I preach well we know that's not correct but but you do have God in You Preach to your pull pit at home right right you claim your children this is not just made for a man to have to speak it well I'll wait till brother Jim speaks it who was it which Revival was it was started and they check back to find out that it was the lady that cllean the church and she would just doing the pews you know and she' just cleaning it and she'd say the brother sits here Lord bless you and sister sits here and cause Revival to come in a church the words of a man and you know what now I'm going to end it by saying this to make you understand it was Christ in Moses you agree Christ in David Joshua etc etc but now if I cross a Doctrine I'm sorry I'm just I say just just this way none of those in the Old Testament had eternal life by the new birth right right right there was no new birth cuz the Bible said Jesus had not been glorified and the Holy Ghost couldn't come until till Jesus came and released that life to come back to give us a new birth that's why you got an Old Testament and New Testament okay simple now under the blood of bulls and goats listen to brother brandom if they could speak flies fleas and frogs he said why would you st stumble at squirrels under the blood of Jesus Christ that's it yeah absolutely so I believe he spoke them squirrels into existence absolutely yes sir yes sir I believe he come to bring me the word yes he this is my Bible it was give to me but this is my Bible don't belong to you this is my Bible this is my message you know holding up brother brandom's quotes I can't say it belong to you cuz it's mine there's just one God and he's mine but see you got to say that now there's just one God and he's mine cuz see you don't know whether I have God or not right right at the words of a man yes sir we put our whole life I mean what if it came along now they've tried to do it you know they tried to prove that brother Brandon was illegally hunting out there in Arizona did that stumble you you know what if they come up now and they put out a Doctrine and put pictures up and showed brother brandham and he was standing there and he had 14 women lined up down through there and said all of them was his wives what would you do see we natur said no that can't be well sure that we know that's right said it couldn't be but even if it was he brought me to an understanding of God's word amen I would Glory no matter what anybody would say about him I would glory in the word that he's brought me the words of a man that we stand on what do you think about it you got to depend on somebody brother here is probably the oldest what are you about 65 you know what he got to depend on somebody right that was the old riddle of the Spinks many of you in school ever was Tau that and I tell that to people and they say where'd you go to school the old riddle of the Spinks what starts off in you know four legs wind up two legs and wind end on three and you had to Solve the Riddle this man he starts off crawling four legs he stands walking up end of it he's got a walking stick he's got three legs that soled a riddle it was called a riddle of the Spinx you see Church we're dependent upon what somebody says yes pray for your pastor because now if you're going to stay here and he's going to be your pastor he's your link to God no bless God I depend on all right see you're not in the you're not in the field I'm talking about if you're going to say bless God I got my own Holy Ghost and it'll lead me and I ain't depending on nobody we'll go home you're a hindrance that's what I tell them at church don't come you're going to have a Doctrine like that you're a hindrance to me and I'm a hindrance to you but we move on with God yes and we depend upon the five-fold ministry amen true for the perfecting of the Saints right yes because they're predestinated Amen to that gift brother Jim has one gift I have another brother Tommy has another we're not all the same I wish I could have a gift at these brothers has are remembering names I finally got to remember Tommy heard it 10 times last night I said one of these days I'll remember that see that's why I love the Lord CU he's that man that's leading all of us and all of our honor and Glory goes to him come on brother J the man Christ Jesus that was back there and could speak now he's here and can speak through you wonderful day isn't it amen praise the Lord only thing wrong with that it was too short but I got enough to finish it up I'm just kidding oh the Lord has spoken this morning and uh it's not the amount of words that's spoken it's the value of that which is spoken and what we receive like the naturopathic doctors will tell you it's not actually how many vitamins you take is what you can metabolize it's not how many books you read or how many tapes you hear I mean those things are good but there's not necessarily more grace that's ministered because of that but it's how much you retain it's how much you that actually you metabolize spiritually that causes a uh causes growth amen and that's what the word is to do we're not going to measure it physic physically you know day in day out day in day out but we know now that there's a restored Eden that's begun and we've been invited back into the Garden of Eden to eat from the Tree of Life we know there's a change taking place what Adam failed to get now the bride in this hour absolutely sidesteps the grave cheats death and continues to eat word upon word upon word upon word and it'll change us into his glorious image I believe it was David that asked the question in Psalms 8:4 he said uh he said when I consider the stars and the heavens I can just picture David just gazing out under uh under a Starlet night and he said Lord what is man that thou art mindful of him what is man what is man what's his value what's his worth well our brother helped us to understand David's Dilemma not necessarily a dilemma but he's asking the question man brother B says God's agent he said he could have chose the trees to preach that would have been a sight wouldn't it we could have been if God had chose a tree we could have been sitting out on an NA tream today or either brought the elm tree in here or whatever but we would be adjusted to it if that's what God I mean that's God calls us to believe some of the strangest things sometimes but that's what separates us from from everybody else but David said and I like his answer here when the Lord apparently responded back he says Thou H has made him a little lower than the angels has crowned him with Glory and Honor has made made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands and has put all things under his feet now what he told us in Genesis gave us dominion over everything all the sheep and The Oxen and all the Beast of the field the foul of the air the fish of the sea whatsoever passes through the past of the sea oh Lord Our God how excellent is thy name in all the Earth David found so many different ways and reasons to worship and praise our God didn't he there's always something to to praise him thank God thank God thank God I heard a brother was finishing up and and I normally don't do this well we got a few few minutes I I normally we just was finished but if I know if we get out too early you know there's kind of a fine line this is kind of a gray area we get out too early well well you know what we going to do now the Baptist already beat us to the buffet so but just so just some thoughts I'll just it just just uh just take a minute I was listening to Terry Fox this morning I knew I wasn't having to preach and I was looking at the newspaper and listen on Terry Fox I remember Terry Fox I know brother Chad's a big fan of Terry Fox well after you heard what Terry Fox Said Today he was talking about election predestination choosing and everything he says I submit to you congregation us a Doctrine from the pits of Hell well Terry just he fell to the bottom of my list of preachers because he was given an invitation whosoever will whosoever will and he said all the people say well God elected somebody and God's chose somebody said that's the doctrine from the pits of hell but you know you just you feel sorry for people like that because you have once you deny election Jesus said John 15:16 he said you hadn't chosen me I've chosen you what are you going to do with that said I'm the one that put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation of the world I'm thinking if Cain was in his in his service I wonder Esau I wonder if he could have convinced them that they could have been saved it had been hard it have been hard either boy both boys not having done good or evil God said I've chosen one I've rejected the other I've given Grace to one giv grace to the other I say this because it helps me to appreciate it helps me to appreciate the love of God the word of God and the fact that God has chosen us and as the brother was getting getting to and in so many directions you go now brother bam made the statement he said he talking about questions anwers 1964 he said uh he said you know the king and the queen how the queen will serve the king he said the wife will serve the husband by ministering him food and he said now that's a relationship we enter into now in this hour where the Queen of Heaven the bride ministers that food to her husband we got to take that word that we hear from man we take right back to the word we find it's right it's wrong like you said examine it and so forth examine these things that we hear if it's right we adopted as a part of our own uh spiritual growth and we believe it and we testify it and we confess it and so forth and Minister it back to God Jesus is the one that said in Matthew chapter 18 and verse 18 He said uh how did he say it he said uh whatsoever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven he said what whatsoever you loose on Earth I'll loose in heaven he's pointing back to the man now cuz David said what is man it's a man who's actually crowned with honor and Glory from God so God deposits that word in his heart to what to speak it out David said I have seen therefore I have spoken say I have heard but now I see and what's the last part of that now I speak that back out and that's why we're called to be Witnesses and we testify of what God has done and that's how the word gets from generation to generation to generation to generation God established that all through the law teach it to your children and your children's children your children's children then and and write on down and write on down and that's why we have it in such volume today in such Clarity today because it's uh continued to be to be preached bride ministering the word to husb brother man said oh I said something then it just come fresh you said something he said but you didn't get it he said but there's going to people there'll be a people rise up and they'll absolutely get it thinking of another statement he made on page 50 of souls in prison he said when the word comes to the Prophet we know that God's ordained it he says but now now that last prophet is off the scene he said now the word comes to the individual to the bride the elect and he said they become now the word to the people God's entrusting his word in human vessels in Earth and vessels where the will of God is he prayed not my will but thine be done he told us to he taught us to pray in Luke 11 he said he said Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth in Earth Earth in vessels this is where God's this is the final resting place of God's word is to develop us into the very image of God himself we become living Epistles written Epistles known
