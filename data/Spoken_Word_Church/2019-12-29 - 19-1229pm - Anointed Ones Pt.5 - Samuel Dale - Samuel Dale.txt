and I want to see a man a man I want to see him don't you good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you'd like to return in back to you scripture to Matthew 24 we'll read from about 23 through 28 Matthew 24 now remember after the service sister Esther wants to get together with all of the sisters downstairs and get everything arranged for that Tuesday night what's not thing and everything get ready for that and you ladies you know get your little law I've done pretty good but get everything ready with your finger foods and your things you know to where we can eat a little bit before the watch not service and then you know how we do we always just eat after the service that way we don't have to go out in the world and you know participate in all of that we can just have a good time for a little while here at the church and in doing those things so remember them never weighed in June and them brother Chris and I over brother all Tigs probably traveling traveling back by now and never Anna and Richard are coming back in this evening and just prayed the Lord would bless his dad is is doing better and we appreciate that he's he's able to you know to do things that nobody thought he would ever do where the error and second is ahead to here because you know nobody expected him to be anything I think now they're finding them putting that plate back in where that he won't be so through trouble with falling or anything you don't could really get hurt but just keep praying for him he he wants to go home to the his home you know and I like that I like that too and I don't want to stay over there in the hospital or something like that let me go home and where I can be where I'm at you know no but just remember to keep praying for all right then the Bible study for the youth will be on the 4th starting what did they say 3 or 3 33 on that on the fourth day of January and then at six o'clock that night we will be having the adult Bible study so come and be with us and just you know sit down have a good time talking about the Lord you know and - I'm gonna try to progress if I can enough into finishing up this afternoon of what I'm wanting to bring and then if you will will have questions and answers maybe next Sunday because on that Sunday brother somebody say it with annual brother Nathaniel Greene will be here speaking that Saturday afternoon and then he'll be on the evening services in the evenings of that morning maybe we'll have questions and the answer is in time cuz I'd like to know if there's anything you won't notice got a question what are you talking about that's a question to me it doesn't matter to me somebody that's that blunt what in the world are you talking about I'll try my best to explain what in the world I'm talking about because that's that's what I want you to see what I see and what I believe in this between you and God rest of it because I can't make you believe it I can just maybe keep repeating it until they either bore you with it or you decide to get something done about it so that's a you know that was the story that you the preacher come in you know any preach to get sin against the end you know they're getting everybody to repent and they said well why don't you preach on something else he said let him repent on repent and I'll preach on something else so you know you just write down tell me what you want me to preach them and I'll tie it to the new birth one way or the other that's that's one thing for sure it'll always tie together all right but just remember those things and then remember the fellowship meeting will be here on the third Saturday 3:30 in waves give that brothers name and I can't never remember it but anyhow they'll be here with us okay all right father we thank you for the day in the Grace and the love that you've given unto us we thank you for everything and we just ask you to help us this afternoon Lord to try to speak what's on our heart because that's what we desire to do we desire one thing that is to be used of you to be able to speak to your people then outside of that this body can be a castaway who cares because I just want to help you Lord to the best as I can and maybe that's not the right way to be saying it oh you don't need no help you need for us to get out of the way and then that way would be the greatest help of all but have your way with us forgive our sins lead us my like Grace and look remember the sick ones among us Lord we think about that constantly how that we've all just grown older and older and older and never thought we'd be getting this hold getting nearly 80 years old but Lord then people are just getting sick and worn out and these old bodies are being this becoming a pest house to us but yet we thank you for your loving you grace and just have your way with each one of us got us and had to keep us in Jesus name let's go down in this save time reading we'll start about 20 verse 22 and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible it should deceive the very leg now what do we found out by our scripture there that you know if somebody comes among you and brings a sign of wonder and it comes to Pais that God sent these things among us two tries that doesn't sound like a good God but it's your ears you know he knows how to do it but that's that's the point and so much if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he's in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not for as the Lightning cometh out of the east and shinin even unto the West so shall also the coming of the Son of man be so you don't have to worry about him because he's gonna it's going to be made manifest right for horse though ever the carcass is there will the eagle's be gathered together you may be seated and Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now I pray that what I tried to get across this morning went down deep enough to understand and you know because you know I just try to tell you what I believe and you know then that way it can be resting between God and you as to far as the doing but see oh you know I never thought people to this message after all of the times that we've had and their teachings even back in their denominations and coming down to the people of this message would would ever come to a point that somebody would say that the disciples got born again before Jesus Christ died that just that this goes down into a it just eats me alive that's all I can say about it because after all that God has done and that's the best we can do it disturbs me alive because that's do it but then this morning trying to cover the Pointer thought that those Old Testament Saints they could be anointed yes we're anointed right David was anointed to kill a bar a line a John etc he could be all of those things but the Prophet said he liked the baptism of the holy ghost that was the one thing he needed was the new birth because he they couldn't have that new birth because then when it come to Jesus the first sermon that he preached was to Nicodemus and saying you must be born again well if they had eternal life before Jesus Christ died at Calvary then why would he tell Nicodemus that all he's said to Nicodemus nikodem if you believe what who I am what's going on now you got Holy Ghost and that's pretty well the way it is now right you believe the message of the hour you've been in them you've been in the message for 20-30 years well well you got the Holy Ghost well that's uh that don't suit with me it never has I don't draw I like watermelon or banana pudding okay I like banana pudding what you don't want I despise it when it's on your plate and not on mine see I don't love banana pudding on your plate I love banana pudding on my Play and that's the way I am with the gospel I just love the gospel to be able to feast upon it and the things that we used to question I mean the back of the church I don't mean this that we we know so much or done so well but your church is out there they're teaching things they're not just blinded out to doing nothing and and we would try to teach things in the denominations and I and you know and they've done some pretty good teaching on a lot of good things you know yes that was dark if you just remember where you was at and see I've seen a lot of good things happen and all like that coming down huh and I don't know but I I want it to happen now and that's my whole thing if nothing else all right and see those Old Testament Saints then Jesus Christ wouldn't had to died if they could have got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they could get anointed right now there's the key that to me that when the Prophet came to that under the anointed ones and was bringing the message I'm just saying what I think see when he comes across there and he's telling on the anointed ones and all and he can read and said now Jesus said these things and we thank God for the opening of the seals that these things could be explained and he looks in there and he begins to see where that anointing is at that it was in the spirit of mankind but not in the soul now watch that after a while if you don't listen to what I'm saying see to me you can have the word every day you live miss it alright you can have the spirit every day you live in this it but when you get them together when that spirit can come down in there and quicken that word to you there to me is the joy that I have is when I'm studying something or thinking about it and I hear the prophets say it nothing all the Lord that that is you know I just don't understand that and all that wants something just goes in that this turned out so clear and you said well there was no other way of saying than that you know you remember the first time when you heard Brett around explaining one God and he said your father your son and you're human well I'd love to had that when I was in the Baptist Church I'd love to have that understanding the bra cuz I was a Baptist believing Baptist doctrine is one true and living God if you don't believe that go find you one and talk to it but yet we couldn't explain it so we explained it God in three persons Blessed Trinity which was just as Trinitarian is anybody else was and that's what cross me wouldn't brother moult said that to me said what do you believe I said one true and living God he said explained I said Garden three persons Blessed Trinity cuz that's all I had he said you just as much of Trinity's it's rest of them I said sir would you explain yourself he said well said a person's a person the personalities or an individual's a person said then you got three guards I'll give me a little more so he said a few more I looked at him when I said I don't believe that no more that's all dad she had a way of expressing what I had always tried to believe you know and see about going okay yeah but you see we get that tied up into the basis that we we all think about it well the point I want you to think of in when I was trying to get across this morning was the one time you think about those Old Testament Saints is what they doing if you don't know what they done read Hebrews 11 right and read of all the things that they've done stopped the mouths of lions killed bears killed this done that you know Samson killing a thousand Philistines with just one old jawbone you know they just think we see he was anointed they took him over there and they finally poked his eyes out and done every time but one day they forgot one thing those dummies there I was going out the thing that she brought her name is that she wound up finding out where his strength was it was in his heart well but you better believe every morning I would have gotten up if I'd have been 110 Philistines and I'd have had 15 of my brothers killed by one man with a jawbone from an old donkey you know I don't want out there every morning I shave that head and I don't even cut the heard of his nose I've got ever higher off that body I could find because Dyer was the strength right I can't but see they didn't they let it go he's blind he can't do nothing he's blind he did have to have a little help well what did he do he told that boy he said words the pillars of this temple he said they're right over here he said okay son he said he would leave the coast up Pires coming back and bird that was something that anointing came back on him that took that temple day on our sea then what great things that happen in those Old Testament Saints you know that this marvelous situations took the place of one person you know what killed so many people are a bunch of of lines or buyers or something just one person just this an anointing from God all right but after all of that it never gave him eternal life then you said well I kind of believed they had eternal all right I ask you a simple question how did it get it but we don't have to understand we just believe it believe what let me ask you a question when a person died in the Old Testament what happened to their soul oh no I know where the body went to the Great Spirit went back to God who gave it okay where'd their soul go so evidently that must not have been eternal life until Jesus come because if they was eternal life in that soul of that man in paradise why did Jesus have to go get him and bring him out why would he not step out during the resurrection would have been nothing back on these things that repairs enough to show to me that those Old Testament Genesis things never had it because that was waiting on him to come pick them up right and say then that's where we get into a lot of things where that's what people don't have but that's okay that's oh no problem just think on these things those Old Testament Saints were not born again they're bad they had to go to paradise to wait until the Lord Jesus went through death burial resurrection ascension and opened the doors of paradise to bring them out see then you can take them up into further months into the scriptures that they raised with him all right paint coming back just a little in it maybe it'll help you alright let's get to that point now to think on it if that be true that they didn't have eternal life well then why would we think that we come into the world with eternal life oh I always was eternal nice quoting the Prophet but if you come into the world with eternal life I ask you a question how did you get it what I always had it you always was eternal then why did Jesus die simple question he wouldn't had to died if he always had eternal life so there's got to be something about that it's not understood alright so he's trying to explain it on anointed ones because he's explaining there he's dead - remember we read it this morning after the opening of the seals now we can see whether or not that we are a Brier or a thistle or ax or something you know we find out where we act well I don't know nothing about seals and I ain't never study no they don't matter to me well does it matter to you if you're born again or not that's no excuse that's no that's no situation to stand before God when he tells the greatest of all religious leaders that the world had ever seen Nicodemus he said you must be born again Nicodemus was one man qualified to be able to step into eternal life don't you think so cause he had everything perfect he was a high priest he was all kind of lying he had it all lined up that he could have this Jesus would have had to come to him and said okay first you got it when he didn't when the one man that could have thought called Jesus wanted the clarity to me that I didn't jesus said thou art a teacher because he declared him to be a teacher he declared Nicodemus to be the greatest ruler teacher of all and since you didn't understand these things all right now think about it as we covered this morning back up just to higher to a thought there is not but one Christ there is one eternal being there is one true and living God there's not many Christ they are in the basis that he can anoint many people to be Christ okay but that don't make many more of them it's the same Christ the prophets will tell you then what like we said this morning the same God that dwelt in Moses the till got a better we're done sir was the same God that was in Balaam to prophesy and write the Word of God let's see we just screams I see that I watch it on your faces you you cringe sometimes it means to me they're not getting it when I cry and I pray and God give me some way to explain it and I try to read what the Prophet had to say about it he said there's only one genuine there's not many Christ there many Christ goes he's in many people yeah it's wonderful but the only one Holy Ghost is only one eternal life there's not two eternal life all right so then the same anointing that was on Moses was owned by them where was it at well now what we've got to figure it out here Moses had the inside of him and Balaam had him going on outside now you're not gonna go nowhere with the Word of God and that terminologies you better get it to where the Prophet would be talking about it he says there's a meaning Christ but there's only one to Christ one Holy Spirit one eternal God all right so then let's keep that doubt in our mind is there only one eternal garden let's move let's read a little bit this afternoon some of these I've already read them to you so I'll read them over again number one anointed wants the endtime brother branham do you believe that that anointing on those people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit yeah sir the genuine Holy Spirit of God upon a person and yet they're false now determining this morning if you were thinking on it and keep it that away then we can go on down a little bit and pick up the thoughts and it'll be there where is the anointing that it's on the spirit the second realm of mankind uh-huh there's where the anointing goes but see that's where we want to make it something different something we want to make it that we're something special oh good praise God with Aurra but not the way you're thinking see that anointing why does it have to go any further than your spirit what's the purpose for the purpose of the Holy Spirit is to quicken the word is that true come on the purpose of the Holy Ghost is to quicken the word the Apostles the Bible said they took the word and held it all right the Holy Ghost came and made that word alive and that was the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell on them making that word alive in their soul and gave them eternal life in their soul thus the anointed ones that's that listen that's why I kept emphasizing to talk to you if it's the Holy Ghost to come down and quicken the word into your business in your soul that you've took and held and studied it and it's made a part of you then you're sealed in right you're sealed in but remember our point that we brought for months now anointed ones are not sealed in they're actually sealed out well now wait a minute look no no the job of what they're doing justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost uh-huh justified claims of that sauce I mean if you know trick it up sanctification cleanses the vessel and the baptism puts the vessel to puts the eternal life in you so try not don't try to well I thank the anointed ones is that that are not genuine are over here and the other than the only ones that are genuine they're over here the difference is the word what was the difference in Balaam who talked about this morning and Moses or Elijah or any of the prophets put there with it what was the difference in their disciples and the rest of them when hey come on the Bible said he was seen of over 500 brethren after his resurrection right where were they on the day of Pentecost according to my calculations that's like 380 of them got disappeared somewhere they didn't think enough of it to go to the Upper Room right yet it called them disciples he was seen of the master his resurrection what you see they didn't stay with the word are we going to stay with the word yeah what about it do you believe that's the genuine holy spirit brother bro he said yes sir then he goes on down this little further on the same quote and he says now that's thus saith the Lord now what about that do you think you and I got any common stupid sense to argue with the dust day of the Lord I don't know sorry about that but he said because of the seals opening we now can understand and these things of the anointed ones all right we can understand it all right so now let's pick up and going down go to number three we read some of this this morning then we'll just pick up the rest and go on hope it don't get boring to you you said brother Branham false prophets the Bible said in the last days there'd be false prophets Jesus said there shall be false Christ not false Jesus's now nobody's standing still for that with false Christ Christ means The Anointed One ones falsely anointed they are anointed but they are false at the bottom of it now what's he talking about at the bottom of it the bottom of it is where you start from right in other words the deepest party use your soul and do great signs and wonders speak in tongues dancing the spirit preach the gospel now tell me anything you can put that something in your life is different from those signs and wonders that you put the Holy Ghost on well I got the Holy Ghost God I saw visions I got the Holy Ghost all right dreamdry you don't know what the new birth is you're in bad shape listen do great signs and wonders speaking tongue preach the gospel Judas Iscariot did it Simon or no I beg your pardon typhus prophesied late let me know all of those things that we would claim our salvation on and put the point of the the danger of our life as to not being lined up with the right word well now then who's got the word office doors are open go ahead to number four well you say these are good people what makes them because one time their top post is on the church and in here and you remember life Sundays a week ago how many was here and heard the sermon on the anointed ones and the last day I think all of you see they are anointed their spirits are anointed in this second room the Spirit is anointed which is the second room of mankind all right so now where is the anointing at what's on your spirit right it's not in your soul it makes alive the word that you have in your soul but if you don't have the word alive how can the Holy Ghost quicken it yeah but I go to church I pretty much either do I Lisa how can you quicker than anything are we gonna make our works what we're saved by I don't not all right don't I go ahead this isn't continuations that go to 1:26 and knoweth it not the words of that now where is your northing to be their spirits are anointed in this second room keep that remember the bottom of it keep that going up now to number five hmm there's a reason that people today don't forget this now and you'll see what the holy what the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is okay now people can live in this spirit they dance in the spirit they shout in the spirit they go to church in the spirit and they can absolutely have the real spirit of god anointed on that spirit but still be lost and just as devil possessed as they can be with that spirit because watch that's the reason you couldn't tell that woman you remember the story about the woman she's out cutting grass with her shorts on but he said she's such a school teacher or something like that you know she's a teacher she's she's done he said that's why you can't tell her because he's done all these things I mean you're gonna walk up to somebody that's spent their whole life going to church paying their time doing everything the word says and say you're lost you couldn't tell her she's wearing shorts was wrong you couldn't tell her bobbing her higher was wrong well that's what you well what I got to do what it did to Samson now think about it go on to the next one this is red alert lengthy reading this is for thinking let's filter I wish you'd ever listen to the whole message just go ahead and pull it on the up straight town religious spooks and things but not I spoke this morning in life Sunday morning on the wheel in the middle of the wheel you know what that is EQ ler wheel in the middle we won we're under by the way what it's the baptism with the Holy Ghost inside your soul right is the wheel in the middle of the oil wheel in the middle of the wheel or that little inside sole on the inside of the spirit how did the spirit on the outside between the soul and the body can be absolutely anointed with the Holy Ghost did you all understand that they are a man I'm not making a lot I'm just saying if I sitting there I'd say old me but I ain't getting it now to follow that with the continuity of the message the god of this world so he said if you want to read one to go with the northern ones getting god of this god of this evil age is what it is that outside that middle case first circle in the human senses the second circle is the spirit senses will self will desire and so forth but the inside is the soul that soul was predestinated so they can be anointed so they can annoy this spirit to make the outside body come in subjection to the spirit but the soul that sinneth that soul shall die the soul that rejects and unbelief the word of God which is the part of God part of that soul shall eternally as always I believe in eternal death listen I believe in eternal heaven but I do not but not an eternal hell you got I believe in an eternal death that does that need explaining eternal death is this when you were done away with there's no holes who you ever coming back that is that's in the Bible that's it you're done you burned like a fire that's a that's an eternal you can have an eternal death because you're not lighted huh you can now an eternal heaven that was easy to understand right but not an eternal hell God hell was created Foster's I don't it gives me that man a seventh grade education of a man understanding their theologians sitting there looking at him man this guy's all messed up he is goofing up looking at he he sounds like one time he says he believes in eternal hell no time he says he don't he didn't say that he said he believed in eternal yes the bleedin eternal heaven but he didn't believe in an eternal hell cause hell is finally the knowledge there is an eternal death for the people that are and them religious worlds that don't always the one woman that lives in pleasure listen to Bible said see she may be religious but she never was saved she's got an outward motion she might sing in the choir she might dance in the spirit she might speak in tongues and have all the manifestations of the Spirit but unless that soul on the inside is God's daughter see she is gone no matter what she does and listen then where are you anointed that I don't know anything my soul joy to them in the Bible short term in the prophets message or anointing in the soul but don't come up now with something and I'm not saying this wrong I've explained it many times right here and I'll do one more time brother Branham from the time he started in the 40s until he reached somewhere about 63 little more maybe of course 64 he was basically I said basically which that means not ever time but close to ever time he was teaching body outside rim second rim so the center rim was the spirit and see people don't even listen to you when you're saying something do you know that before one of the Pentecostal move they did not believe you had a soul until the law came have you ever heard that one they believed you just a body and spirit but when the law came it brought your knowledge so you look good man explain that to me at work I said looks real good but I got one problem he said what I said would you mind reading Genesis where it said did he breathe into that Athens nostril and he become a living soul and you telling me that in how no soul until it come all the way over I said would you mind taking the word soul and run it through the Old Testament and see how many times it's mentioned and why would David to scream out and crying my shoulders trouble see that the point of what I'm trying to explain what I've tried to explain it gets me in trouble to try to explain it but I get in trouble huh you like to be arrogant well no but I don't want to be stupid there's very little difference between arrogant and stupid stupid means you don't want to hear it means you won't take correction will do nothing all right that means you get built up in your own self I'm built up in my own self I'm glad that God has revealed this word to me I do not back off from any thought of that if you think I'm exalted or whatever you think what you want to I'm just so glad of what he's revealed to me aren't you aren't you glad at what God has made known to you if not then you need to get to the altar you ought to be happy about what's been made known to you go out right across there you can't get it listen the prophet that's it basically preached body five sentences so second rim memory reason conscience etc etc Center rim either faith or doubt but when he comes to 63 and you're coming into the last of 63 and hitting the 64 he teaches body spirit so you go to get down see fun ride back in before the 63s before 63 and back in the beginning he was teaching body second realm you know outside rim so second rim spirit sent around that's why your to so people could be so confusing with what they were saying because they taught from soul is the nature of the Spirit you wouldn't know if he wasn't back I even talked to him that hardly but but listen after 63 sometimes to the 64 he teaches body spirit and soul he said where did he change that well he changed doing it because I asked you to show me after 63 or somewhere there in now 64 show me where he was teaching body soul and spirit I'll show you where he was a teaching body spirit and soul he said well watch that God do it we need to know this to be saved why are you where's the anointing that the brother branham didn't have to correct that because he's right he never changed the senses no matter where it was here or here he always had since number one or position body see taste field smelling here he always taught the second rim as memory reason conscious affections he taught the third rim has to be either faith or doubt he always told it that way he didn't have to change it you said yeah but there is a problem there is a problem maybe God let that be there were you and I could be confused about what we believe in the Prophet talk Oh may I quote the Prophet he done these things to try us cuz if this was nothing's wrong race that now and get this vice versa and I stand and say both them drive because of what he always said body has five senses second realm has five senses spirit has one sense where are you anointed at if you take it here you put the anointing in here now you've got vast problems with your anointing and the spirit realm in the center of the individual that's why I believe the Bible Hebrews 4:12 the Word of God is a discerner between the soul and spirit to join Tamara look teach it the way we've been reading these then we are anointed in your spirit now you got it right body five senses spirit ii remember reason conscious etc there's where your knowing it can be on your spirit and that's as far as that anointing goes it don't go into the soul the anointing quickens the word that you're holding in yourself the Spirit of God quickens the words you have in your soul you don't open up somebody pack Hebrews 13:8 and Little John 3:16 oh we got the word in our soul why did that 380 leave Jesus after his resurrection morning I wouldn't have any son for Jesus to come right in here up here among us and two weeks later you say I don't believe it here that'd be nice wouldn't it did you see what I'm talking about after the opening of the seals they come into plain view the anointing then he could preach the naughty ones the end after the opening of the seal that the anointing would be the anointing on your spirit which would be as I read to you terrible - and i1b the second room you see the difference in in truth of understanding in truth of understanding you'll try your best to see the bread around those messages korat correct all the way through you don't have to change it to make it fit I don't have to say he was wrong here and got right here I didn't say that I said he talked to sign thing all the way through three senses body second realm third ring he was always teaching it right he such that read it that read it wrong and then used it to preach the to show doctrine is based totally upon body soul and spirit who wouldn't around him come around and put the body spirit and soul it annihilated that to soul doctrine come on a lot of you don't know anything about - so doctrine but what they thought was that you receive this soul from God do something you that when you're born into this world you get this is what they teach that ain't right that you get a soul from God and you get a soul from the devil God kills one of them the other one they teach always was eternal there's where your doctrine came of those thing that they taught you always was he told you didn't need any new birth for this soul well number one this is 1970 no more than brothers what's wrong with your doctrine because you're telling me that - sold - sold now according to my prophet Satan cannot create so you're saying he created a soul oh yeah he took your soul that God gave to you and through time he perverted it yes but he didn't give it to you and if he didn't give it to you and God gave it to you why are you killing it cuz that was their doctrine you gotta kill one you got to you gotta kill one of them they admitted that the church we stood back there and fought these things out all the way down through and that's what I've always told I tried to tell them then I said you got it all messed up because you don't understand get it body spirit and soul and do what the Prophet done after the opening of the seals now I say this way cuz I'm human most of you read and we read what we read was from 65 and you never looked over to see what year it was you don't know whether he said it in 62 or 65 or 75 but yet I'm an hour key I'm a smart aleck but let's say I'm talk about the word come on the anointing is on your spirit their spirits are anointed and for did we get down we get number five God anointed that spirit he doesn't anoint us whole the either lives in it or don't live in it he don't anoint that's why I tried to get you for three or four weeks now I've been laying that quote in but then it in later when these days it'll don't on you were anointed ones are not sealed in there's nothing to steal for Anointed One but those who have the word took it and held it there's four things of the gospel declares about the disciple the one they took the word and held it one of them they took the word and therefore things that was done in the Gospels with the word to set it up because you know the so and watch sowing of the seed the seed with the children of the kingdom and that set up to where that sow that seed would land in that soul of that individual and when it did the Holy Spirit would come down on and annoy yes that word and make it alive that's why the new birth is a birth of the word it's not you shouted kryder's done this letter deal he has nothing to do with that your prophet I've tried to tell you but you won't listen what did read this morning I want to give you one little joke you the baptism with the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in not at all not on that don't have anything to do with your soul that's the baptism here's the inside soul this is from the modern events made clear by prophecy it has to come from God then on the outside you have the five senses they contact your earthly home the inside you have a spirit and in there you have five outlets your conscious and love and so forth five outlets to that spirit remember in that spirit you can be baptized with a genuine Holy Spirit of God and still be lost well I've never heard nothing like that where have you been where have you been have you read well not know I've never read that book leadership many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so why cuz the Bible said the rain falls on the white the just and the unjust the anointing strikes are just and the unjust the new birth is a birth of the word yep we thank you Tommy you just need to read the Bible you don't need to read the Bible we'll start off with an amen but then we settle it with one thing just cause you read it don't mean you understand it keep reading it then about the time you think you got it figured out you about halfway through reading it we got a gold star in the Baptist cuz we read the Bible I didn't read mine to get a gold star I read mine to find out what he said and this is what I said today that I walked out of the Baptist Church or I heard of this message I said Lord I'm supposed to be a Christian according to the word now let me be a Christian let me be a Christian teach me the things that make me a question what about it Dean okay let's go ahead - let's just prove this point see a lot of you don't think there what I say cause you ain't gonna go home and look it up you're not gonna go home and look it up one predator you can go on I'm telling you you ain't going home and look it up if you do you'll read over and pass over and later we never never they will say that I don't believe that well I didn't say it that's brother branham a question in 1961 go ahead number nine now that's a hard one please explain the difference between the spirit and the soul now that's a hard one but the first thing you are a trying be just like Father Son and Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost is three titles going to one person which is Jesus Christ and your soul body and spirit but it takes those three to make you with with just one of them you're not you it takes the free to make you body spirit soul every which the way you want to call it soul spirit body whatever you want to call it it takes them three to make you right what are you body spirit so you turn around say spirit body soul yeah but listen whatever I am inside of me is going on it's explaining I didn't come down the one that's the part part that is the spirit the soul is the nature of that spirit that when the Holy Spirit comes upon you it does not do nothing you it changes or converts your spirit to a different soul okay and the soul is a different nature that's on that spirit so the soul is the nature of your spirit amen whatever you are inside is what you are in the second reel we're supposed to be the same thing in the outer realm you see that going to the next room number 10 the rapture now remember this is 61 right now here's 65 okay look at here you're a trying being you are inside this little fella here is the soul the next is the spirit and the next is a body now you got five senses in this body to contact your earthly home you don't contact the rest of it you've got five senses and of the Spirit your love and conscious and so forth of that but in here is where you live that's what you are what are you your a soul the Bible doesn't say the spirit that liveth is in us he'll die come on let's get in the Bible the Bible don't say that the Bible don't say the spirit of sinners he'll die he says the soul that sinneth David even you hadn't cried out my soul thirst after thee Jesus cried out hanging on the cross I'm so then he says into the hands I commit my spirit which was his whole being then what happened when Jesus died body went to the grave spirit goes to God who gave that double quote in brother Branham where'd he say the soul win it wasn't a spirit that went to hell they were in the spirit that went to the souls in prison it was the soul the soul descended and come back up the brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time those people told him this is souls under the altar so what is your soul that's why I don't have no problem because I studied it 40 years while they was trying to figure out how many souls you had I was trying to figure out what the Prophet was talking about a soul and I read one day where he said in the Hebrew book page 80 in the old Hebrew book if you want to look at that away he says the soul is your theophany no but might be off and he's up yonder thought your soul is what you are I thought that was your being see that's why you can be anointed by that spirit on the memory reason consciousness a connection through from the outside man and get into the loves your peace and all and you can go out and do wrong that's so if you'll just listen to it it'll keep you straight it'll keep you lined up it'll stop you from going out there and doing those things so I don't want salvation in my spirit now don't misunderstand me I wanted in my soul working out through my spirit out through my body and I admit somewhere between and I read you a quote while ago that the spirit was between us the the soul and the body somewhere in between ours our problem the spirit realm right memory reason conscious affections and all of that can go wrong okay come on swallow Jesus was tempted work now according to the Bible that no man can tempt God are you with me no man came till God be stupid is right Jesus was tempted were not in his soul there was any spirit if memory reason conscious he was a human being he saw just like we say now brother branham I didn't said run around and said he was tempted of women the more you you you sure no I just tell it where it is he was a human mortal being in body subject to the five senses working upon his memory reason consciousness in his spirit realm but inside of him he never sinned inside of him he never lusted in that soul no if we could ever get our senses right get to the point yeah we've got to have everything just like what I'm saying when brother Branham said beyond the curtain of time he said the angel of the Lord said this is souls under the altar that can't be so gunpowder go souls on the outer the fifth seal more we're smart we got it all figured out but the angel said it was sold on the older you see we've got so much knowledge until it puffeth up when he went to our beyond the curtain of time that was his soul he said well where was he yet come on let's don't be too far gone there is such a thing called soul travel man's always taught about that that you can go out have an outer experienced market report that's what happened to brother Branham his body was laying on the bed there on the bed was a body spirit and her soul of a man but yet soul travel he went into another dimension because it was a prophet and subject to the dimensions and when he got there he could see the people and fail him and they said this is souls under the altar we'll see we're so smart no that's not so girl so grounded out or fifth sealed you brother brother man said that how long will we toil in their minds how long will it be until we get settled then get our human minds out of the way then we talk about a change then we can talk about a brother Dale the way you've brought it out to services of course you about for services you've brought it out that the anointed ones was anointed on their spirit I brought that out because I believe it what's your profit talk he also called that people that are to be true born-again believers the anointing is on their spirit but it quickens the word that they've held in their soul whereas the other can't be quickened why was it caucus couldn't be quickened he confessed who he was that you're a man sent from God nobody can do the things that you've done unless God be with you what was the difference if in koffice in Jesus one was the word what are you saying the word will tell everything the word tells what we are that's why it's so dangerous to play and say well you know we don't have to understand these things we just believe in God and doing the best we can do are we how do you know whether you're anointed or not I hope you've got down to that point at least you say what I'm saying I believe that every person that's anointed is anointed on their spirit that there's no such thing as anointing in their soul show me the Prophet the anointing is on your spirit ring now let's sink that real good let's see if I can keep the memory only Christians sin you agree with that do you agree down quote and brother Branham no only Christians sin a sinner is condemned on a higher level he's automatically condemned he's not a sinner he's condemned sin has done I elated him out of the way the only of Christians have sins all right now then if all the Christians have sins the Bible said he's a sinner she'll die that right it's in her she'll die all right now brother Bob you ever had a dirty thought Oh at least he admits it mom still getting red face and say no how about it you had a wrong thought now let me get that straight remember you can have a wrong thought and not sin come on we do we spend four hours explaining it but you know the wrong thought I'm not saying about it because that's Satan tempt in you because Jesus had to have that thought in his mind process to be able to lust you agree all right see now what where was it at that you had the wrong thought it couldn't be in your body because that body's worth nothing they don't think it has motivators in the inside it's not your soul good things that where's it at you know I mean to me if you'd listen if you just listen I'm stupid Oh idiot to try to explodes over do you realize if you have a wrong thought under your concept of the fact that if you think wrong you're lost then you're lost but if you have a thought process or something happens that's just your thought coming in you can't help that listen folks I spent two years fighting this man this devil of that dough brother mote one day said it he said brother Dale you going crazy I said I know it but he said you got to stop and cut this devil off where he's at said let that thought come and then turn it down lose it oh god you can't stop it from coming but what was the story you keep it from building this nesting on her this message has got the most wonderful opportunity for a Christian to be able to understand who we are and what's going on but just remember that brother Dale makes another statement I don't blame the devil for everything I do wrong yeah you say hey what I do know I don't blame the devil for the things that I do wrong you say you do wrong every day you want your prophet fired he said every day so what about it the soul that sinneth God would have to kill us but if that sin is within our spirit rim of our memory reason concerts affection tonight then God can pass it off with us saying I'm sorry father that's out there I'm sorry but I thought that I apologize to a man years ago about so he told someone later he said to think brother Dale dug me out of a doctoring that was wrong and that's what it was he was in the doctor and there's no mansion to horse I explained just a few sciences led him out of it he said but thank didn't he come and apologize to me I didn't apologize for telling him the truth I apologize for the fact that I may have hurt his feelings I told the man just the other day sitting in the house that's not sorry that last night I've talked too much that I spent hours talking to you about the message I'm sorry you said well you're sorry for don't know no I should have let him talk more well so jealous as a brother you don't understand that I can shut up inside of me I'm so Salus to get two people to see what God he is and where he's at what he's doing till I'm subject to this overloaded I'm sorry for talking too much and everything I was telling him I was hoping was happening but just remember you can set there hope when you happen somebody else it might be you need to shut up and let them say a few words and you'll find out they might know more do you think oh no I know all about it these hours where we go that's that memory reason conscious affections but let me just let that Inside Man look at him shot and then come out then what does it matter what people think about you you ain't heard me get up here in the lamp Isis a brother for the situation that is happening to a great brother that I love I don't agree with him but you ain't heard me say nothing you ain't heard me say he's lost and doomed no I told brother 14 I said you tell the brother as far as I'm concerned I don't know what's going on but as far as what I know I ain't saying one word I said it comes out of find out you know what this is all right and it's come out later all of the things we'll said which may be true testing will make no difference Abraham went after a lot right are we willing to lay down our what we think is so graving the wife for somebody they're trying to lead them back that they may see Christ the seal of God the word is sealed into your soul the devil is sealed out but your knowing it comes down upon that word that you've took and held it it makes it alive you ain't afraid of nothin then well because it's alive come on musician think on these times they pull some more quotes and read them but take some of these the quotes it you've got home we and read them yourself they were I've already to run them off Christ The Anointed One and we are little anointed ones little messiahs little children of God what we got really let Stan [Music] merci [Music] merci [Music] see Oh [Music] that's my receipt if you think there's something wrong with the message and profit is wrong here they're just give it time [Music] pray and just give it a little time [Music] I told you about it when God spoke to me about that first seal and how it opened I was running a job that nobody else couldn't run ain't joke and they couldn't run it you wouldn't know something like that unless you talked to some of these brothers that worked assembly lines nobody could run my job but I'd write down this a few words and God opened that seal my turn meters running up and down the line when he opened it I've seen there goes the white horse rider he wouldn't brother branham standing iron it wouldn't be standing there it was the Lord Jesus Christ the Prophet said here stands the lamb with a book in his hand and set out there goes the water was robbed he said Darby it's got to be the Antichrist simple statement you find two people in the Bible you got a mixed up doctrine the Bible only revealed one goddess [Music] pastor Steve hero owners [Music] anybody have a name mercy rear Oh [Music] ah by [Music] [Applause] versus riru [Music] father we thank you for it was a truly mercy that rewrote our lives changed us from a vile person to a true Christian of God Lord we hope that what we've tried to bring is well enough to Russ to understand we truly believe in the morning of the Christ but thank you for giving us the message to let us see that we can have that anointing and still be lost but we thank we're saved the only way to know [Music] is what our soul does with the word what our souls does with the word will give us the answer not what our mind does but when that Inside Man speaks back then we have what we have needed up bless the people on the way home give everybody a safe journey people waiting them traveling to be with Adam Richard them traveling be with everybody here traveling home just remember the sick ones among us father you just come on the scene and heal the sick and deliver each one of us make us to walk in the light of your love forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us in
