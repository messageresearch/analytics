[8:34] yes
[8:38] i want to
[8:40] see you
[8:43] amen good to be in the house with lord
[8:46] good to be back
[8:48] with the home folks we had a real good
[8:51] time in arizona we
[8:53] had some real good fellowship
[8:58] real good friendship we happened to uh
[9:01] brother andrew glover was out there and
[9:02] so was uh
[9:04] brother dale smith of course he's got a
[9:05] church out there but
[9:07] we all got together on saturday and had
[9:09] a little fellowship and sister
[9:11] mandy cole well she's mandy clayton now
[9:13] we've known her 20 something years she
[9:15] lives out there so we got to all get
[9:16] together and have a little fellowship
[9:18] but
[9:18] brother chris said tell each and every
[9:20] one of you hello and god bless you
[9:22] i told him i said it's a real pleasure
[9:24] to be able to to preach to a group of
[9:26] people that
[9:27] understood what you were saying because
[9:29] they had a good background they had a
[9:30] good
[9:31] they had a good preacher that could uh
[9:33] rightly divide the word but there were
[9:36] there were about what jim four five
[9:41] six knew what six or seven new seven new
[9:44] converts
[9:45] that had came with them from colorado
[9:48] springs
[9:49] the old church where chris used to be
[9:50] and and so we got to
[9:55] give them a little bit of testimony of
[9:57] the word of god and how the
[9:59] god sent a prophet and and
[10:02] i told uh bob is
[10:05] miracles happened in arizona
[10:09] because i second service first service
[10:11] you know i preached a little while and
[10:13] we got pizza and and sub sandwiches and
[10:17] went outside in 90 degree weather and
[10:18] sat outside and eat
[10:20] pizza and and um
[10:23] drank some coca-colas and then we went
[10:26] right back in and had service and
[10:28] i preached for two and a half hours and
[10:29] not one person went to sleep
[10:33] yeah so
[10:36] it's just all on what you want because
[10:39] you can have
[10:40] the reason i'm saying that is we put
[10:42] ourselves in the same situation we blame
[10:43] it on eating
[10:44] i don't you can blame it or whatever you
[10:46] want to blame it on but um
[10:48] but it's just in what you wanted because
[10:50] man they were sitting on the edge of the
[10:51] seat especially the new ones it's good
[10:52] to preach the new ones every once in a
[10:54] while because you do get older and you
[10:55] know you get more settled and you get
[10:57] more
[10:58] ah man instead i'm in you know
[11:01] but uh to see the young younger ones
[11:03] come in and then
[11:04] you know you bring a thought out and
[11:06] then you see their eyes you know their
[11:07] eyes light up and
[11:09] and then afterwards you you see the you
[11:12] see the effect of that
[11:14] now they were still i mean they were
[11:16] still there with their earrings on and
[11:18] their pants on and all that didn't
[11:19] bother me
[11:20] i wasn't talking to the outside person
[11:22] and talking to the inside guy anyway
[11:24] so but that's the same way with anywhere
[11:26] you go and we sure appreciate brother
[11:28] chris for letting us
[11:29] have that uh have that time and and then
[11:32] we flew back on tuesday we had a day of
[11:34] rest on monday so it was wonderful we
[11:36] had a good time
[11:37] saw the sun come up in flagstaff at six
[11:39] o'clock tuesday morning and
[11:40] took a picture of the sun going down in
[11:42] greenville south carolina tuesday
[11:44] evening so we flew all the way across
[11:45] the country
[11:46] watch the sun come up and watch the sun
[11:48] go down but good to be back here
[11:50] good to be back with the home folks so
[11:53] if you got your bibles let's go ahead
[11:54] and continue with hebrews 9.
[11:56] we'll bring a little bit of extra

[13:22] morning i went to work and i said i've
[13:23] done something
[13:24] never done before they said what i said
[13:26] i kissed a 60 year old woman
[13:31] they didn't get it for a second so but
[13:34] uh
[13:36] i told you and i said i said well now
[13:38] you know they you do surveys and they
[13:40] put you in these little brackets
[13:41] you know 35 to 45 45 to 55 55
[13:45] well we moved over into another bracket
[13:47] we're in our 60s i don't know what i
[13:48] don't they didn't even do one for 80s
[13:50] and
[13:50] i don't know what they do in 80 or 80.
[13:52] survival mode that's what
[13:54] it's a survival mode for all of us so um
[13:57] we are
[13:57] brother chris also said to pray for him
[14:00] he's he's got some um
[14:02] not he's just old getting older the man
[14:04] was a motorcycle rider
[14:06] for his profession back when he was
[14:07] younger he broke every bone in his body
[14:09] almost he said so just remember brother
[14:10] chris he
[14:11] has a hard time getting up and a hard
[14:13] time moving around so just pray for him
[14:15] but hebrews 9
[14:17] verse 11 we're still on eternal
[14:18] redemption but right here at the
[14:21] at the end we want to bring a few things
[14:23] out that we saw when brother
[14:24] louise did a masterful job wednesday
[14:26] night of speaking on uh
[14:28] why hell was not eternal i was i was
[14:31] hoping that that title
[14:32] what they call it click bait in the in
[14:35] in the youtube world you know you see
[14:36] that title and you think man
[14:38] that thing's going to get 5 000 views
[14:40] because everybody believes hell's
[14:41] eternal
[14:42] except for the bride of jesus christ you
[14:43] know everybody all there's nothing but
[14:45] it's getting up there pretty good so
[14:47] maybe they'll maybe somebody will watch
[14:48] it and
[14:49] and get something out of it but it was a
[14:51] it was a you can't wiggle out of that
[14:53] one
[14:54] and when you bring it right you can't
[14:55] wiggle it you can't say well this no
[14:57] you bring all the angles that's why i
[14:59] love teaching and i love how
[15:01] that like brother dale said it
[15:02] positionally places you in the body
[15:04] and i'll read something about perfect
[15:06] love here in just a little while
[15:08] that brother brown told us so hebrews 9
[15:11] remember all these ones that are sick
[15:12] the ones that are not with us
[15:14] and uh we pray that they'll all be back
[15:17] together
[15:18] we'll get them back together here and uh
[15:21] remember uh sister sharon snart she's
[15:24] been on my heart for a while so remember
[15:26] her she's going through she's been going
[15:28] through a battle for a long time but
[15:29] she's going through a battle now too so
[15:30] just
[15:31] she's just one of us so hebrews 9 verse
[15:34] 11. dear heavenly father thank you for
[15:35] this day that you give us
[15:38] lord this is a trying hour for the world
[15:42] but lord it should be a grand and
[15:43] glorious hour for your bride
[15:45] because we see the word being opened in
[15:47] more we see more avenues of
[15:49] of revelation that's coming from
[15:51] different angles lord but it's all
[15:53] bringing us to this one purpose
[15:55] is this plan of redemption that goes to
[15:57] the change of the body for the gentiles
[15:59] and then continues right on to the jews
[16:02] and then continues right on to the white
[16:03] throne judgment
[16:05] father we pray that you'd give us
[16:06] strength today lord bless each one
[16:08] that's here
[16:09] be with the ones that are not here the
[16:10] ones that are online lord we pray that
[16:12] you'll just be with each one
[16:14] give us lord today our daily bread be
[16:16] with the ones lord that we pray for the
[16:18] ones that list right down below my feet
[16:19] hanging on the wall lord for salvation
[16:22] lord for the ones that we go through
[16:24] lord for the older ones here
[16:26] our church lord and the different ones
[16:28] around the country we pray lord brother
[16:29] george smith
[16:30] shall raise him up for your honor and
[16:32] glory lord brother ray
[16:34] hear a good report today father we pray
[16:36] that you just bless each one
[16:37] take care of us now and further in this
[16:38] service in jesus name we pray
[16:41] amen hebrews 9 11 but christ being come
[16:44] a high priest of good things to come by
[16:46] a greater
[16:47] and more perfect tabernacle not made
[16:49] with hands that is to say not of this
[16:51] building so he did away with that when
[16:52] he went to calvary right
[16:54] because it had to be done in flesh you
[16:56] cannot redeem through a building
[16:58] you can't redeem through a tape player
[17:01] amen
[17:03] you have to have redemption through
[17:04] human flesh it has to be
[17:07] as brother there was something heirs and
[17:09] joined heirs that's what we were talking
[17:10] about it brother chris is when you take
[17:12] joint heirs
[17:13] see if if men if well i want to say
[17:17] daddy's going to pass away but if
[17:18] somebody passes away and you got three
[17:20] people there if they're joined heirs
[17:21] this one doesn't get 10 000. this one
[17:23] doesn't get a thousand and this one gets
[17:24] nothing
[17:26] joint heirs means whatever that's left
[17:28] whatever's there
[17:29] right you get an equal opportunity
[17:33] to have exactly what that heir and we
[17:36] are heirs of god and join heirs with
[17:38] christ and what was he heir of
[17:40] heir of salvation he actually obtained
[17:43] eternal redemption for us
[17:44] so in that he obtained eternal
[17:46] redemption
[17:47] it's ours that way in john 17 jesus did
[17:51] he didn't pray that we would be too he
[17:53] prayed that we would be one
[17:55] amen to me that's the greatest
[17:56] revelation that we're going to have to
[17:57] break into
[17:59] break out of this god's way up yonder
[18:01] and we can't get to him and
[18:03] and we're not worthy well i'm just going
[18:04] to tell you what the bible says we're
[18:06] heirs and joiners with christ
[18:08] where is he sitting today he's sitting
[18:10] what
[18:11] in um he's in a seventh dimension with a
[18:14] perfect
[18:14] body so what are we heading to
[18:18] the only problem is is we got to have
[18:19] that perfection down here
[18:22] get the dead saints out of the ground
[18:24] get that perfection here because what
[18:25] the bible says
[18:27] thessalonians tells us we which are
[18:29] alive and remain shall be caught up
[18:31] so that's what we need to work on now
[18:33] this i'm not just trying to go over and
[18:34] over
[18:35] this is a plan that's got to be carried
[18:37] out
[18:38] and it's got to be carried out to the t
[18:40] because god made the plan
[18:42] he saw the plan that he made and it was
[18:44] perfect
[18:46] so it's why he called it eternal neither
[18:48] by the
[18:49] by the blood of goats and cows but by
[18:51] his own blood he entered in once into
[18:53] the holy place having what obtained
[18:56] when he came out of that tomb on
[18:58] resurrection morning
[19:00] he obtained eternal redemption for me
[19:04] and you because his body was not eternal
[19:06] when they hung him on a cross but he
[19:08] obtained eternal redemption
[19:10] for us you may be seated we're going to
[19:12] go over this real quick we won't be long
[19:13] today
[19:15] job the oldest book in the bible
[19:18] supposed to be written before moses
[19:20] redemption was the oldest things in the
[19:22] bible
[19:24] now why did he why did god god
[19:26] foreseeing that he knew we would fall
[19:28] he knew that we would need a savior to
[19:31] save us
[19:32] from the get-go so he knew that adam
[19:34] would need it eve would need it
[19:36] abel would need it they all would need a
[19:39] plan of redemption before there even was
[19:41] a breath
[19:42] on the earth of a human being amen
[19:44] because now remember
[19:46] let's i haven't brought this out but
[19:48] let's let's bring this out because
[19:52] the earth
[19:55] the earth fell because we fell brother
[19:58] dale read it this morning in romans 8
[20:00] the whole world groaneth and waited for
[20:02] the manifestation of the sons of god
[20:03] because when adam fell
[20:05] that brought everything down below him
[20:09] to the fall it wasn't the earth's fault
[20:13] the earth was created perfect amen
[20:17] the animals were created perfect the
[20:19] animals were supposed to
[20:20] they were here before we got here and
[20:22] they were multiplying and they were
[20:23] doing the things that they were to do
[20:25] and
[20:25] and you know they were being and i was
[20:28] watching
[20:28] i downloaded a little video about a a
[20:31] girl that was
[20:32] um epileptic and it made me cry because
[20:38] yeah i can it made me cry
[20:41] because they take these little dogs
[20:45] from puppies now i talk about nature
[20:47] that's
[20:48] when brother dale because the bible says
[20:50] that we were we were brought under that
[20:53] see before the fall adam those dogs
[20:55] didn't need to be trained they were
[20:57] already trained
[20:58] to do what adam told it to do but after
[21:01] the fall they began to get angry and
[21:03] they began to get started eating each
[21:04] other and all these different things but
[21:05] now man through
[21:07] even just through the tree of knowledge
[21:09] he is able to bring these little puppies
[21:12] and and be able to emulate an epileptic
[21:14] fit
[21:16] and the dog can sense it before the kid
[21:18] has the epileptic fit
[21:20] by smell it gives off a certain odor
[21:24] and they've trained it now and you do
[21:27] and the reason i was crying i thought
[21:28] lord
[21:29] that's the way it should have been
[21:30] there's no way no epilepsy but that's
[21:32] the way it was when adam was walking
[21:33] around
[21:34] he didn't have to tell the dog what to
[21:36] do the dog they
[21:37] everything was in harmony everything was
[21:40] in perfect love and was in connection
[21:42] with each other
[21:43] and even the line and the lamb laid down
[21:45] with each other and all these different
[21:47] things but look what man has done
[21:49] just by sheer knowledge of the tree of
[21:52] knowledge
[21:54] still being the the highest in the food
[21:56] chain
[21:57] he can train a dog that can go home with
[21:59] this little girl because she'd have
[22:01] epileptic fits and quit breathing
[22:03] they happened to catch her one time
[22:05] before she passed away
[22:06] so now there's dogs with her all the
[22:08] time and she had a fit there and that
[22:09] the dog just starts barking going crazy
[22:12] jumping up and down on so
[22:14] it alerts it by the smell i thought my
[22:16] if man can do that in this natural
[22:19] what about in the spiritual where we
[22:21] don't need all that
[22:23] training of an animal that the animal
[22:26] would just know what to do
[22:27] because the lion and the lamb you lay
[22:29] them down together now and one of them's
[22:30] going to die
[22:32] but if you lay them down together back
[22:33] in before time before there was a fall
[22:36] what were they doing they were they were
[22:37] in harmony with each other they were
[22:39] just animals
[22:40] there was no food chain going on there
[22:42] so but you look at those things and
[22:44] you think god that's why the bible says
[22:46] we're groaning
[22:48] that's what's groaning within us that's
[22:50] what's groaning within the animals
[22:52] that's what's grown
[22:53] you see the volcanoes going off um
[22:56] af i mean uh uh alaska just had another
[22:59] earthquake five point something on the
[23:00] richter scale and then you got one
[23:02] island it's got a volcano every time i
[23:05] see these things and all these disasters
[23:07] it's our fault it's our fault because
[23:10] you said no it's adam's fall well it's
[23:12] our fault because we haven't got it back
[23:14] to the
[23:14] we ain't got the ship pulled back
[23:16] together yet we ain't got but we've got
[23:18] the way to do that
[23:19] right that's why i was explaining to
[23:21] them out in arizona that's why god had
[23:22] to send a prophet
[23:23] because they had all these pieces laying
[23:25] out
[23:27] there was the pieces and you just look
[23:28] at pieces and you go why
[23:30] how in the world like like richard and
[23:32] dad were you know laying the pieces out
[23:34] for that motor what
[23:35] that wouldn't have meant one thing to me
[23:37] but you take a master
[23:39] um a master mechanic can look at that
[23:42] and say oh there's a cylinder
[23:43] there's a there that bolt goes next to
[23:45] that cylinder because it's this you see
[23:46] what so god had to send us a profit
[23:49] they took all these pieces or all these
[23:51] loose ends
[23:52] and what he built the ship that's going
[23:54] to take us out of here
[23:56] he's built that thing that you and i are
[23:58] going to have to attach ourselves to
[23:59] that
[24:01] so this is not just talking about
[24:02] eternal redemption just because we want
[24:04] to go over and over it
[24:05] no there's something in here that's
[24:07] going to have to click
[24:09] somewhere to take us to a change of the
[24:12] body because it's never happened before
[24:14] so the psyche of of of humanity
[24:18] how many people have you had heard of
[24:20] change of the body like you said if you
[24:22] ask them about it in the denominational
[24:24] world
[24:27] what do you think is going to happen
[24:29] they'll have an answer
[24:32] they don't have an answer what do you
[24:34] mean changing the body we're getting a
[24:35] new one
[24:36] we went to that church that guy a little
[24:38] baptist guy up in the mountains and
[24:40] he got finished preaching went outside
[24:41] smoking like you wouldn't believe
[24:44] and they said brother said he's coughing
[24:46] he said brother they said brother you're
[24:48] going to kill yourself he said
[24:49] i'm going to get me a new body it ain't
[24:50] going to matter what i do with this one
[24:52] see there
[24:52] so there's their teaching that and this
[24:54] was from a preacher
[24:56] this is from a head of a church that was
[24:59] preaching to his congregation so
[25:01] if he could do it the congregation could
[25:03] do it that's why brother branham tells
[25:05] us it's
[25:05] misinterpreted theology it's what's got
[25:08] us in the trouble that we're in
[25:10] misinterpreted theology is letting us do
[25:12] the things that we do
[25:14] our misinterpreted theology but thank
[25:16] god let me tell you something
[25:18] you've been put into a place that there
[25:21] is no misinterpreted theology
[25:24] this message has not yeah it's been
[25:26] misinterpreted by the people out there
[25:28] but when god brought it to the prophet
[25:30] and he brought it to us it was not
[25:32] misinterpreted
[25:34] it was the word of god brought a
[25:36] sounding board through a prophet
[25:38] that brought us the message and then you
[25:40] and i have got one thing to do and
[25:41] that's believe it
[25:43] get into it believe it know that it's
[25:45] right
[25:46] know that you're in the right place to
[25:48] get it i was thinking when bob was
[25:50] preaching
[25:52] why pentecost failed you can't preach
[25:53] that everywhere buddy
[25:57] there's a lot of people in this message
[25:58] still stuck in pentecost
[26:00] and when you tell them that's why they
[26:01] failed you won't do it but one time
[26:06] you'd be like me you'll be that one and
[26:08] done guys
[26:10] but you know what it's not our fault
[26:13] we're trying to bring the truth to the
[26:14] people
[26:16] we're trying to bring the truth to the
[26:17] people and if they reject it then you
[26:19] know what it's going to be on them
[26:21] it's not going to be on us it's going to
[26:22] be on them same thing with you if
[26:24] you hear brother dale years and years
[26:26] and years preaching over and over again
[26:28] and you reject it then i don't i
[26:31] ain't saying let's go to ephesians 1.
[26:34] but redemption was the plan of
[26:35] redemption was late this thing was laid
[26:37] out
[26:38] and remember there had to be a group of
[26:40] people
[26:41] take this plan of redemption and work it
[26:44] do it you had to be able to connect
[26:47] yourself to this plan of redemption
[26:50] we see in ephesians that and let's go to
[26:53] verse four according as he has chosen us
[26:55] in him we know what that is that he
[26:56] chose us
[26:57] in him before the foundation of the
[26:59] world now how did he do that he didn't
[27:01] do that just by saying all right i'm
[27:02] going to take zach black
[27:03] but i'm not going to take samuel l no he
[27:06] by foreknowledge he knew that zach would
[27:08] come to a place that he was tired of
[27:09] being tired
[27:10] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[27:14] of his stinking thinking and he would
[27:17] want god more than anything in the world
[27:19] amen so according as he has chosen us in
[27:21] him before the foundation of the world
[27:23] that we should be holy and without blame
[27:25] before him in love
[27:26] remember not pulling us to a tube
[27:30] we had some good conversations out there
[27:31] in arizona
[27:33] it would have been good to tape them but
[27:34] we didn't but but you look at that and
[27:36] you see that
[27:37] that what honor is it more instead of
[27:40] just saying
[27:41] all right you're my son and that's it
[27:45] it's done where is there a victory where
[27:48] is there an overcoming where is there a
[27:50] struggle where is there a
[27:52] pop of god where are you you know god
[27:55] saved me god god healed me and all these
[27:57] different things you know that
[27:58] to me that brings everything and i know
[28:01] sin is horrible
[28:04] right being sick is horrible
[28:07] but my when you get well and my when you
[28:11] come from a sinner to a saint
[28:12] and you realize that god saved your soul
[28:14] and take you out of that pit of hell
[28:16] and put you up into a higher place and
[28:19] that you can think different and act
[28:21] different and things like that doesn't
[28:22] bother you anymore
[28:23] what more do we look to god and say
[28:25] thank you papa god because i couldn't do
[28:26] that myself
[28:28] see everybody there's a lot of people
[28:30] though in this world that think they do
[28:31] that all their by theirself
[28:34] all these great people all these great
[28:36] people of the world
[28:37] even world leaders if they're not born
[28:39] again they're going to stand before that
[28:41] white throne of judgment
[28:42] just like the guy that didn't have
[28:45] anything in the world
[28:46] they're going to all stand there and
[28:48] have to give an account
[28:49] of what they did with what god gave them
[28:52] accordance has chosen up
[28:54] in him before the foundation of the
[28:55] world that we should be holding without
[28:56] blame before him in love
[28:58] we're going to talk about that word love
[28:59] just for a little bit in a minute having
[29:01] predestinated us
[29:03] that's what brother dale's been
[29:04] preaching on even brother chris has been
[29:05] preaching
[29:06] so it must be that we need to preach a
[29:07] little predestination
[29:09] and it not being that having
[29:11] predestinated what us
[29:12] unto the adoption as we were talking the
[29:15] other day
[29:15] you know luther was predestinated to
[29:19] to a spot but it wasn't to it wasn't the
[29:21] full adoption
[29:22] each person has been given even paul
[29:24] paul's age the ephesian church
[29:26] this is who he's talking to the
[29:28] ephesians now
[29:30] one of the most powerful churches there
[29:32] was and 12 people went to that church
[29:35] amen but they could understand this
[29:38] because paul had brought them to
[29:40] a place you and i have been brought to a
[29:42] place but remember
[29:43] because of the opening of the word they
[29:46] were there was a lot of things withheld
[29:48] down through the ages
[29:51] now not the perfect love because
[29:52] remember we we're going to get to it
[29:54] perfect love cast out fear and perfect
[29:56] love is the new birth
[29:57] so they all had the new birth for their
[29:59] age but that perfect love didn't carry
[30:02] them all the way because there was a
[30:03] group of people
[30:05] listen we all have to we were talking
[30:07] about this in arizona
[30:08] there there's and the same thing here i
[30:11] brought the quote
[30:12] i didn't bring it with me where brother
[30:13] brown talks about that box
[30:16] god's got a box and then you if
[30:17] ephesians church age they fulfilled what
[30:20] that was inside that box
[30:21] then he laid them away and brought in
[30:23] the iranians church
[30:25] irenaeus martin columba each one of them
[30:27] had a message and they're in that sixth
[30:29] dimension
[30:29] under their messenger right but not one
[30:33] of them sure they were a
[30:34] voice columba had to have a voice
[30:38] because he died before the church age
[30:40] started so he brought his message
[30:42] and then a voice through a group of
[30:44] people but nobody has ever been
[30:46] commissioned to bring the final voice
[30:48] to the final age under her messenger now
[30:52] under each messenger they brought a
[30:53] voice
[30:54] but it wasn't final it was a
[30:55] continuation it was a growth development
[30:58] it was baby form then it went to you
[31:00] know went to milk and then it went to
[31:02] to uh baby food and then a little bit of
[31:04] hard food and then meat
[31:06] so you and i are living in the meat age
[31:08] so listen that's our requirement
[31:10] right do you know luther if we brought
[31:12] luther's box and put it out here in this
[31:14] age that wouldn't do you any good except
[31:16] just say it would justify you wouldn't
[31:19] put you in the body of christ but now it
[31:21] put them in the body now everybody
[31:22] understand that
[31:24] because that won't you have to go to the
[31:25] next step and then go to the next step
[31:27] because it's a requirement think about
[31:30] all these others
[31:31] you know you couldn't even i was
[31:32] thinking yesterday or
[31:34] yeah a couple days ago martin i don't
[31:37] think martin stood up and said
[31:39] bless god i'm the third church age
[31:40] messenger to
[31:42] pergamos no
[31:46] he come and brought a message each one
[31:49] of them come and brought a message
[31:51] i don't even think luther stood up and
[31:52] said well i must be a
[31:54] no it took a profit in the end time
[31:57] so that we can take these quotations
[32:00] from the prophet
[32:02] and say oh that's why luther acted like
[32:05] he did that's why
[32:06] wesley acted like he did this is how
[32:08] we're supposed to act
[32:10] why pentecost failed is because they
[32:12] cabbage down and got stuck in a church
[32:14] age
[32:16] they had the holy ghost but they thought
[32:19] that was a complete part and that
[32:21] i was thinking about this brother dale
[32:23] was in um
[32:26] out there where i was at pretty much
[32:27] pretty close and in colorado and
[32:30] we were out there hunting and i wasn't
[32:31] serving the lord this is probably 1995.
[32:34] and there was two preachers that went
[32:35] with him well one had the cabin and the
[32:37] other one went brother down they were
[32:38] sitting at the table now of course i was
[32:39] over in the corner listening but and i
[32:42] knew what dad believed
[32:44] but this one was saying you got it all
[32:45] when you believed and this was saying
[32:46] you didn't get nothing until you get up
[32:48] to the top where it says holy spirit
[32:50] and they're sitting there arguing back
[32:51] and forth and daddy's trying to bring
[32:52] them together you know how brother brown
[32:54] took the
[32:55] tree off of the trinity and tree off the
[32:56] oneness and stuck in the ground he was
[32:58] trying to stick a tree in that
[32:59] big old table we were sitting at didn't
[33:02] do any good didn't change their mind but
[33:03] they were all they all had points that
[33:05] they were quoting each other back and
[33:06] forth
[33:07] but you got to bring that together
[33:09] you've got to have the holy ghost before
[33:11] you can have holy ghost virtues
[33:13] it just makes sense and then you read
[33:15] the bible where it says
[33:16] having the divine nature of god right
[33:20] you got to have the divine nature of god
[33:21] to know what god wants
[33:23] you got to be a child to god for you not
[33:25] listen the devil's kids don't have these
[33:27] traits
[33:29] oh yeah you brother brown said some of
[33:30] these people have natural
[33:32] but that ain't spiritual traits like
[33:35] this is spiritual traits coming from our
[33:37] daddy
[33:38] coming from our genetics you become a
[33:42] born-again believer you're not your
[33:44] natural genetics but that
[33:46] that kuckelberg turns into a wheat that
[33:49] inside man is then the one the control
[33:51] man that says okay you need to have
[33:53] virtue not just
[33:54] be a virgin listen to don't
[33:57] they don't anymore but being a virgin
[34:00] was a
[34:01] um in the bible you had to be one or
[34:04] they take you out and kill you right
[34:06] but that pretty much has eroded itself
[34:08] all the way down to the end time
[34:10] okay but did god change
[34:14] no he didn't change but that virtue is
[34:16] not living a virtuous life that virtue
[34:18] we know is strength or power
[34:20] and so that's what you and i must look
[34:22] at
[34:24] right here in whom we have redemption
[34:26] through his blood the forgiveness of
[34:28] sins according to the riches of his
[34:30] grace that's
[34:30] number seven try to flip through here
[34:33] real quick
[34:34] number first nine having made known unto
[34:37] us the mystery of his will
[34:38] there was a certain mystery went out in
[34:40] all the church ages but you and i
[34:42] as i was telling them that sunday you
[34:44] know you take the analogy of the book
[34:47] jesus in luke 4 he sets down and they
[34:50] hand him a book
[34:52] or scroll in luke 4 and he sets down and
[34:55] he what does he do he identifies himself
[34:57] in the word because the book's open
[35:00] but now before he gets up to leave what
[35:02] does he do
[35:04] the bible says he closes the book and
[35:07] hands it back to the preachers
[35:09] and so liv they lived under a closed
[35:11] book because he went right on you know
[35:13] a couple years from there he went to
[35:14] calvary and died
[35:16] he tried to show him the open book but
[35:18] it disappeared
[35:20] oh yeah people got saved sanctified
[35:21] filled with the holy ghost all down to
[35:23] the church ages
[35:24] but it was still i see through a glass
[35:26] darkly i don't see all things i don't
[35:28] see how the
[35:29] as i said many times before as great as
[35:31] paul was paul never knew what a seal was
[35:34] now he knew the seal of redemption he
[35:36] knew the seal
[35:37] you know whereby you are sealed until
[35:39] the day of your redemption but as far as
[35:41] the seven seals paul never heard
[35:42] anything
[35:43] anybody preach on seven seals that was
[35:46] all given to john
[35:48] 20 years or 30 years after paul had
[35:50] already went off the scene
[35:52] and even john lived through it tried to
[35:55] write it the best that god let him write
[35:57] it
[35:57] and then he what he gave it back
[36:02] but now remember in in revelations 10
[36:05] what did that angel come back with
[36:07] that angel came back with an open book
[36:09] somewhere along the line
[36:11] that thing got opened back up and it had
[36:14] to be a seventh angel messenger to
[36:16] reveal what this
[36:17] mystery the mystery of his will what did
[36:20] he say the mystery of his will was was
[36:22] to adopt us
[36:24] now not just come to baby form adoption
[36:26] because everybody and i
[36:28] i was i was going to tell brother
[36:29] they'll finish up to this afternoon or
[36:31] keep going because
[36:33] there's more to that because you receive
[36:34] the spirit of adoption where you cry
[36:38] you cry daddy daddy your baby
[36:41] you're crying and that's okay that's all
[36:43] right because you know what
[36:45] god's a good daddy but now he does
[36:48] require us to grow up
[36:50] i don't call brother dale every 15
[36:52] minutes now i need
[36:54] some i need something
[36:57] yeah that'd be funny wouldn't it i'm 61
[37:01] years old
[37:02] you know what he'd say grow up
[37:08] for some of you wake up no he's saying
[37:12] grow up well that's what god's doing now
[37:14] he's telling us
[37:15] to wake up i've said before and i'll
[37:17] tell you again
[37:18] wait that thing up that's inside you and
[37:20] use it
[37:22] we have we have encapsulated that thing
[37:25] so long
[37:26] until i can and i won't and i'm not this
[37:29] and i'm not that
[37:30] quit that let that thing inside of you
[37:34] out
[37:35] let it do something
[37:38] come on let it out of that cocoon
[37:41] you'll be a beautiful butterfly if you
[37:44] can't but you know what happens
[37:46] they have to fight their way out that
[37:50] little worm
[37:51] it it solidifies on the outside but you
[37:54] know what happens
[37:55] that thing inside of it that butterfly
[37:57] starts doing this
[37:59] then little bees that come out of my in
[38:01] my hive they they're it's capped over
[38:03] with a little bit
[38:04] a little thin layer of of wax but you
[38:07] know what
[38:07] the workers don't help them out and
[38:09] workers walk right over the top of them
[38:11] bees trying to come out of the hole
[38:12] why because that bee gets stronger as
[38:15] it's chewing its way out of that out of
[38:18] that
[38:18] nest or out of that little circle that
[38:20] they're in or hexagon that they're in
[38:22] and they chew themselves out and then
[38:23] they come out and they say oh man
[38:26] that was a struggle but i'm alive that's
[38:29] the same way with you and i it's a
[38:30] struggle but we're alive
[38:32] it's a struggle but we got eternal life
[38:36] we should be the happiest people we i
[38:37] mean you see people happy at ball games
[38:39] and all these different things you see
[38:41] people
[38:41] happy they win the lottery they get
[38:43] happy they get happy because they got
[38:45] their stimulus checked first before
[38:46] anybody else did
[38:48] lord of mercy people call in the post
[38:49] office all the time now you got my
[38:51] stimulus checks like we hold them for
[38:52] something i don't we don't hold them for
[38:53] nothing
[38:55] we get them things out as fast as we can
[38:56] get them out folks i'm promising
[38:59] it's not all the postal people's fault
[39:01] you get them out we get them out
[39:03] as we get them all right but you know
[39:05] that people are happy when they get that
[39:07] 1400
[39:08] i will be when i get mine because i've
[39:10] already got it spent
[39:13] but what about god though that's just
[39:16] 1400
[39:16] you know what it'll go away in about
[39:18] five minutes once i get it
[39:21] nah two minutes because i already got it
[39:24] spent
[39:25] but now you can't do that with god you
[39:27] can't say oh i'll just use a little bit
[39:29] of this because there's nothing left
[39:31] the more you want the more he gives the
[39:33] more you get the more he gives the more
[39:34] you want
[39:35] amen and it's an inexhaustible fountain
[39:38] but in the dispensation of the fullness
[39:40] of times
[39:40] he might gather together and won all
[39:42] things in christ and as i said before
[39:44] i'm not trying to be an exclusionist or
[39:47] or as brother brown says a
[39:48] segregationalist but god's a
[39:50] segregationist he segregates
[39:51] good from evil he segregates us from the
[39:55] church he said i now call you bride you
[39:57] must
[39:57] act like bride don't act like
[40:01] church
[40:05] there is a difference it took a profit
[40:07] to bring the difference though
[40:09] that way you could see a lot of times
[40:11] when when you see the prophet talking
[40:13] about he will
[40:14] exchange church and bribe but you look
[40:15] after the seals open
[40:17] he pretty much hones in and he tells you
[40:19] what that bride is
[40:21] it's not that denominational church it's
[40:23] not that idea that's out there in the
[40:24] world
[40:25] it's one specific group because look
[40:28] that in the dispensation the fullness of
[40:30] times he might together gather together
[40:32] what
[40:33] in one all things in christ both which
[40:36] are in heaven which are on earth even in
[40:37] him
[40:38] and him also we have obtained an
[40:40] inheritance so we didn't
[40:41] come here with one right
[40:45] we didn't come here with one we have to
[40:48] obtain it we had to fight our way out
[40:52] we had to fight our way to that birth
[40:56] amen it didn't just come because we were
[40:57] born naturally on this earth no you were
[40:59] born naturally on this earth to die
[41:04] you were born naturally on this earth to
[41:06] die right because that's what god told
[41:08] them back in the garden
[41:10] you're in sorrow you're going to bring
[41:11] forth children and they're not going to
[41:12] live
[41:13] he put a time limit on some of them 120
[41:15] years
[41:18] he didn't give that to us though being
[41:21] predestinated according to the purpose
[41:22] of him who worketh all things after the
[41:24] council
[41:25] of his own will and we we've been
[41:27] through four knowledge we'll skip
[41:28] through that
[41:29] but we know that romans 8 28 for whom he
[41:32] did for know he did predestinate to be
[41:34] conformed to the image of his son
[41:36] listen predestination sure it
[41:40] is determined that there's going to be a
[41:42] group of people here that's going to
[41:44] take this
[41:45] message and take a body change
[41:49] so that is predetermined you got to
[41:51] decide whether because see god knew
[41:52] god knows he's going to be there you
[41:54] don't
[41:56] so i and you know what i like it that
[41:57] way because you know what if if
[41:59] zach if you'd have woke up one day and
[42:00] just said well i know i'm going to
[42:02] heaven
[42:04] i don't know we're human beings it's
[42:06] like brother brown said he said if you
[42:08] knew god was coming tomorrow
[42:10] he said continue to plant your potatoes
[42:13] get married build a house do all the
[42:15] things don't just sit down and go
[42:17] well i made it well
[42:20] no you need to press i think paul said
[42:22] press he said press
[42:24] on to this mark of the high calling not
[42:26] just a level calling or
[42:28] or just well i'm a christian and and and
[42:31] i make it to church sometimes
[42:34] no it's a pressure that we're and you
[42:36] know what
[42:37] we're built for it we're built for this
[42:41] pressure
[42:42] if not we'd be in another church age we
[42:45] were built for the pressure of this age
[42:47] because we are astronauts we are eagles
[42:49] we are made to go higher we're higher
[42:51] than any
[42:52] animal that's ever come line ox man or
[42:54] eagle the eagles the highest it can take
[42:56] the pressure
[42:57] and like somebody i think it was in one
[42:58] of the songs and let me give you a
[43:00] little
[43:01] brother joe canada bless his heart for
[43:04] those of you that are on the email
[43:07] he does something that's really that
[43:09] will help you because when we do these
[43:11] new
[43:12] songs a lot of y'all don't sing them you
[43:13] know why because you don't know the tune
[43:15] but brother joe canada if you will open
[43:17] your email
[43:20] hello somebody if you'll open your email
[43:23] he's giving you a link to the song
[43:25] you can hear the song being sung by
[43:27] someone else
[43:29] and you can get that and enter in maybe
[43:31] and do more worshiping instead of trying
[43:33] to figure out what the words are
[43:35] amen so thank god for brother joe
[43:39] he's not doing that for himself he's
[43:40] doing that for me and you
[43:42] so that we can worship and sing and not
[43:44] have to be focused continually on the
[43:46] words or how the
[43:48] or how the uh the song goes but he sent
[43:50] that one yesterday and i really enjoyed
[43:52] it i was playing it this morning before
[43:54] service so you kind of understand how to
[43:56] how to sing the song what i'm what am i
[43:59] saying is god giveth the ability with
[44:01] all this technology even with the fourth
[44:02] dimension that we've been talking about
[44:04] that's so bad
[44:06] it is to the devil but god uses it too
[44:09] he sends his his technology i like god's
[44:12] technology it's been you know we
[44:13] god didn't need to stick a wire in
[44:15] anything
[44:16] never has never has to have an antenna
[44:19] never had never runs out of wi-fi never
[44:22] runs out or out of signal
[44:23] never runs out he doesn't ever have to
[44:25] reboot
[44:26] he's been using this forever he's just
[44:28] god has let man tap
[44:30] into it so me and you can put the whole
[44:32] message now on something about this big
[44:36] so you don't have an excuse you know we
[44:38] had an excuse when
[44:39] when we first had this building and for
[44:41] those of you that
[44:42] that i wish i hope if anybody's got any
[44:44] pictures of the old church or anything
[44:46] of the building in the old church
[44:47] we need to bring them for our 50th
[44:48] anniversary because this whole wall
[44:50] right here there was not a door there
[44:51] the door was right here going outside
[44:53] there was two windows here and the seats
[44:55] were this way and the wall was right
[44:57] there where brother donny is at and it
[44:58] went back a little bit
[44:59] but that was the whole church pulpit was
[45:01] right here piano was right here
[45:02] but this whole wall was full of tapes
[45:05] seven
[45:06] inch reel if you wanted to
[45:09] if you want to check out three or four
[45:11] tapes it almost took a box to carry them
[45:13] out just three or four tapes
[45:15] right when dad threw them all the way it
[45:17] was a whole pickup full
[45:19] but you know what you can do you can get
[45:20] the whole sermon on a little mini disc
[45:22] a little mini disc about that big stick
[45:25] it into whatever you need to stick it
[45:27] into and play it
[45:27] in your pocket all 1100 sermons so you
[45:29] don't have an excuse
[45:31] i didn't hear that sermon or that one i
[45:32] couldn't find that one it's all right
[45:34] here
[45:35] so she even got through the fourth
[45:36] dimension he took all excuses away for
[45:39] you not being able to listen to the to
[45:40] the message of the hour
[45:41] or even listen to the sermons that are
[45:43] here if you're not here amen
[45:46] for whom he did for no he also did pre
[45:49] be did predestinate to be conformed to
[45:51] the image of his son
[45:52] that he might be the firstborn among
[45:54] many brethren now being the firstborn
[45:56] what happens
[45:57] you have a first born and then you have
[45:59] born after that
[46:01] amen but he was the firstborn or the
[46:02] first partaker brother they'll get into
[46:04] that with adoption
[46:05] because somebody has to be the example
[46:06] because it's not normal for us to act
[46:09] like god
[46:12] sorry we're born contrary we're born
[46:16] with a carnal mind we're born what
[46:18] contrary to anything god said
[46:21] because that's what you live before you
[46:23] got the new birth you live contrary to
[46:25] what god said
[46:26] so that's the way don't be surprised
[46:29] just realize that that part's gone now
[46:31] i hope that part's been put in the sea
[46:35] of god's forgetfulness that he won't
[46:36] remember it no more
[46:37] i wish my brain sometimes would be
[46:39] thrown into that place
[46:41] so i don't have to remember this but you
[46:42] know what you remember it
[46:44] for a reason it keeps you humble
[46:47] it keeps you away from that other stuff
[46:49] that you used to do it keeps you from
[46:51] getting so close remember
[46:52] satan owns the fence so let's don't get
[46:54] to where the fence is at
[46:56] amen satan owns the fence so be careful
[46:58] stay away from it
[46:59] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[47:01] he also called whom he called he
[47:02] justified he justified he glorified
[47:04] that's me and you he called us in this
[47:06] end time
[47:07] look what he'd done like brother dale
[47:08] said look at all the people from all the
[47:10] different places of the country
[47:11] how he brought us all together and put
[47:13] us under one roof and put us under one
[47:15] message
[47:16] that we can hear what hear the voice of
[47:18] god not only through press and play but
[47:20] through a five-fold ministry
[47:22] because it takes a five-fold ministry to
[47:24] perfect the saints
[47:25] as i said before you might get born
[47:28] again listening to a tape or reading a
[47:30] book that's fine
[47:31] but listen how in the world like i said
[47:33] that was my point i was gonna make
[47:35] how are you going to if you're called
[47:38] and justified and glorified you have to
[47:39] have a way
[47:40] for that to happen but you got to open
[47:43] up yourself to get that
[47:45] there's got to be a way you can't just
[47:47] listen to the tapes
[47:50] because that's contrary to the word of
[47:51] god it's got to be a live ministry it's
[47:54] got to be a live
[47:55] apostles prophet pastor teaching an
[47:57] evangelist to what
[47:59] to get you through this adoption stage
[48:02] the stage of adoption has to come
[48:04] through preaching of the word of god
[48:06] an updated revelation
[48:12] a 2021 not different from 1963 or 64 or
[48:17] 65
[48:17] not different thank god for a prophet
[48:20] that when he preached he preached
[48:21] both ways he preached all the way back
[48:22] and he preached all the way into the
[48:24] future home
[48:26] but let's listen to this
[48:29] how can i take a cucker bird number two
[48:31] and make a greater weed out of it it's
[48:32] impossible for me to do it
[48:35] the only way it could be is because
[48:36] inside that kookaburra has been
[48:38] transmitted from a kookaburra
[48:40] to a germ called wheat germ remember
[48:42] god's the only one that can do that
[48:43] they'll be all right with that
[48:45] listen so now let's go to the dimensions
[48:47] i wrote myself a little note light time
[48:49] and matter
[48:51] is the first three dimensions i'm kind
[48:52] of skipping through this a little bit to
[48:54] get to my point
[48:55] light time and matter now listen
[48:59] we are trapped in this time we're time
[49:03] creatures okay sorry
[49:04] we're time creatures all right and we
[49:07] have to have light
[49:09] sunlight to live off of natural sunlight
[49:12] everybody got that i'm talking natural
[49:14] right now you've got to have natural
[49:16] sunlight to grow the plants and to keep
[49:18] the animals
[49:19] and to grow the animals and grow the
[49:22] plants and them to eat the plants and
[49:24] you'd eat them
[49:25] and then for you to get strong you need
[49:27] light you need regular sunlight so god
[49:29] give us that in the first three
[49:30] dimensions
[49:31] light he gave us time so that we and
[49:33] being timed creatures we had to be
[49:35] because he had to slow that he had to
[49:37] slow those dimensions down
[49:38] so that there could be other ones right
[49:40] that's right everybody got that
[49:42] think of this perfect plan he knew he
[49:44] would need a fourth dimension he knew
[49:46] you need a
[49:46] fifth dimension that was a little bit
[49:48] faster a six dimension it was a little
[49:49] bit faster
[49:50] and a seventh dimension but he knew that
[49:52] time had to come into being because he'd
[49:55] say
[49:55] you're only going to live 120 years
[49:59] man's number or what he's going to live
[50:01] with 120 years and now down to 70
[50:04] for us and then matter he knew that you
[50:07] know
[50:08] as as before all this
[50:11] as adam was in spirit form
[50:15] he didn't need light remember genesis
[50:18] 126 man was created before anything was
[50:20] created
[50:21] we know that on the sixth day that he
[50:22] was put in the flesh but that genesis 21
[50:24] 26 man was way before the foundation of
[50:26] the world
[50:27] that's when this plant listen without
[50:29] that genesis 1 26 man
[50:31] there is no plan of redemption because
[50:33] that is the redeemed that's not just
[50:36] everybody that just wanders all over the
[50:38] world
[50:39] that's the redeemed that's the ones that
[50:41] are going to be considered what does the
[50:43] prophet tell us
[50:44] he said only what
[50:48] only sons and daughters of god are
[50:50] considered
[50:51] in redemption nobody else is
[50:57] oh there's some that's going to be
[50:58] attached to it but you and i are the
[51:00] only ones this bible was written for
[51:06] why do you think god took so much time
[51:07] and kept all these books the way they're
[51:09] supposed to be
[51:10] psalms and job and all these different
[51:12] ones why do you think he took
[51:13] he was so careful because he knew that
[51:16] human beings would need this
[51:18] and that the bride wouldn't need it need
[51:20] it because his brother dale's talking
[51:22] about if you call it this morning
[51:23] those that were under the law was not
[51:25] under that genesis 1 26 man
[51:29] that one part of genesis 1 26 man
[51:32] because when jesus came now remember he
[51:34] came to magnify the law
[51:36] but for the ones for the ones that for
[51:39] righteousness sake
[51:40] he didn't do away with the law but he
[51:42] came under the law to deliver us from
[51:44] what the effects of the do's and the
[51:46] don'ts
[51:47] amen because he doesn't want his real
[51:49] children his real
[51:51] children once they yeah sure they're
[51:53] babies and we smack them
[51:55] we get a little brother brown said
[51:57] protoplasmic whatever that is
[51:58] stimulation
[52:00] but once we get a little bit older god
[52:01] expects us just to do the right thing
[52:05] thou shalt not kill do we have to get up
[52:07] every sermon and preach not to kill
[52:09] do we have to get up every sermon preach
[52:11] don't covet your neighbor
[52:13] i mean that's really what listen that's
[52:15] really what the denomination the world
[52:17] doing they're preaching
[52:18] the old testament
[52:21] thou shalt not but you know they're
[52:23] sitting there not doing all what the
[52:24] word says
[52:25] but you know let's be good to your
[52:26] neighbor thou shalt not do this don't do
[52:28] that
[52:29] do this don't do that but remember when
[52:33] we
[52:33] come down and adam he didn't have to
[52:37] have sunlight
[52:38] to exist he wasn't in time
[52:43] and as i've said before adam just moved
[52:46] through the earth
[52:48] he walked through that wall if he needed
[52:49] to i believe because he wasn't in human
[52:51] flesh he was in his theophany
[52:53] and theophanies are the same way you
[52:54] don't have to open the door to let a
[52:56] theophany outside
[52:58] no it just goes right through the wall
[53:00] because it comes from this hard shell
[53:01] thing
[53:02] that's caught in light and time and
[53:04] matter because god knew once he put us
[53:06] in human
[53:07] flesh we would need light and time and
[53:09] matter because we can't
[53:10] we got to have something hard how in the
[53:12] world are you going to get in the car
[53:13] and go down the road today go home
[53:15] you get in the car where you're in
[53:16] theophany and you just go out the other
[53:18] side
[53:19] you need something hard right so we need
[53:22] something hard something to beat on
[53:24] maybe you wouldn't have nothing to beat
[53:26] on chris has got this big old new pulpit
[53:28] and i was
[53:29] banging on it and he said i didn't know
[53:31] if it take that or not but i guess it
[53:32] will
[53:34] so i said it at home it keeps people
[53:37] awake
[53:40] it hurts my hand
[53:43] so look the fourth dimension we know
[53:45] what that is but let's go to the fifth
[53:47] dimension where brother louise was that
[53:49] because the fifth dimension is where the
[53:51] center of the unbeliever dies and goes
[53:53] to
[53:53] number five it's kind of well the
[53:56] horrible dimension and
[53:57] like brother louise said it's a real he
[53:59] did a real good job
[54:00] just a outstanding job
[54:05] and truly you got to remember folks hell
[54:08] was not created for human beings to be
[54:10] there
[54:11] hell was created for the devil and his
[54:13] angels all right
[54:14] so we look we we're through the fourth
[54:16] dimension into the fifth dimension and
[54:18] that's the holding place
[54:20] then we go to the sixth dimension and we
[54:22] know the sixth dimension is christ
[54:24] the saints the dead saints because i
[54:25] want to i want to actually while he was
[54:28] preaching that
[54:29] going to the sixth dimension if you
[54:30] don't mind while he was preaching that i
[54:33] thought a few things i want to bring out
[54:34] today
[54:36] but look it says the sixth dimension is
[54:37] christ the saints the dead saints are
[54:40] resting saints who is completely
[54:42] worked finished on earth and has entered
[54:44] into rest with christ
[54:46] under the altar beautifully you could
[54:48] parallel it like a beautiful dream that
[54:50] you didn't want to wake up from now the
[54:52] one
[54:52] brother louise was talking about
[54:53] wednesday you want to wake up from that
[54:55] one
[54:56] but you can't but remember brother brown
[54:58] said it ain't a dream it's natural it's
[55:00] real
[55:01] i'm just making a parable and then of
[55:03] course the seventh dimension is god
[55:05] alone and i came upon something
[55:07] how many times have we read the bible
[55:09] and we didn't read the bible
[55:15] you know we were talking the other day
[55:16] and i was preaching on paradise
[55:18] and i said that i didn't believe that
[55:20] they i didn't believe that they were
[55:21] changed back to young people until the
[55:22] resurrection
[55:24] and i got a scripture for that you ever
[55:27] read it before let's go to first samuel
[55:29] 28.
[55:30] now we know that paradise was what
[55:33] paradise was a holding place called the
[55:35] bosom of abraham yeah go the first
[55:37] all the way to first samuel we're going
[55:38] to skip a bunch of quotes here because
[55:39] you've heard them before
[55:42] because remember what was paradise drop
[55:44] back down to
[55:45] yeah go one more go to first samuel 28
[55:47] it's right below that one
[55:51] there you go because remember what was
[55:53] paradise paradise
[55:55] i want you to understand this this is
[55:57] how powerful the blood of jesus christ
[55:59] is and how
[56:00] imperfect the blood of bulls and goats
[56:02] was now the blood of bulls and goats
[56:03] what did it do
[56:04] for this space of time it covered the
[56:07] people
[56:10] everybody got that but that was only
[56:12] showing that there was a time come that
[56:14] a man was going to come
[56:16] a man was going to die and that man had
[56:18] enough power inside of him
[56:21] enough of the soul of god which he was
[56:23] god
[56:24] that he could come back and go not on to
[56:26] the believer but inside the believer
[56:28] and he could wash your sins away and do
[56:30] away because the blood of bulls and
[56:32] goats
[56:32] it only covered or capoed your sin but
[56:35] we were talking about paradise
[56:37] that that we see that brother brown said
[56:39] john was there abraham was there
[56:41] isaac was there jacob was there sarah
[56:43] was there but watch this in first samuel
[56:45] then said to woman who shall i bring up
[56:47] and he said bring me up samuel remember
[56:49] samuel
[56:50] had been dead for two years and he was
[56:52] in where he was not in the sixth
[56:54] dimension he was in paradise
[56:56] everybody got that right and paradise
[56:58] was the holding place i'm sure it was a
[57:00] wonderful place to be i'm sure they were
[57:02] probably not
[57:03] unhealthy they were not hurting in any
[57:05] way but there was no way for them to be
[57:07] changed back
[57:09] to a young man and woman watch this and
[57:11] when the woman saw samuel
[57:13] she cried with a loud voice now this is
[57:15] where who saul
[57:17] came to the witch of endor the winch of
[57:19] endor did some kind of
[57:21] hocus pocus or whatever she did went to
[57:23] the spirit world
[57:24] she did something amen when a woman saw
[57:28] samuel she cried with a loud voice and
[57:29] the woman spake the sauce saying why
[57:31] hast thou deceived me
[57:32] for thou art saul and the king said unto
[57:35] her be not afraid for what saw us thou
[57:38] and the woman said saul i saw god's
[57:40] ascending out of the earth
[57:41] and he said unto her what form is he of
[57:44] and she said an old man cometh up
[57:50] had you ever read that before i read it
[57:53] a hundred times and never read that part
[57:54] right there
[57:56] he didn't say a young man they didn't
[57:57] say an unrecognizable person
[57:59] the bible says an old man cometh up and
[58:02] he is covered with a mantle
[58:03] who'd stumble samuel so what happened
[58:06] when they died they just moved over into
[58:08] another dimension
[58:11] the same age they must have passed away
[58:13] with because listen the blood of bulls
[58:15] and goats
[58:16] only covered your sin
[58:19] but now look at the difference in the
[58:22] paradise
[58:24] and the sixth dimension we're fixing to
[58:26] talk about because the 90-year-old woman
[58:28] got
[58:29] the baptism of the holy ghost in this
[58:31] dimension and when brother brown met her
[58:33] in the other dimension she was a 20 year
[58:34] old young woman
[58:36] there was not age differences in the
[58:37] sixth dimension
[58:39] and he said unto her what form is he and
[58:41] she said an old man cometh up and he is
[58:43] covered with a mantle
[58:44] and saul perceived that it was samuel
[58:46] and he stooped with his face to the
[58:47] ground
[58:48] and bowed himself and we know the rest
[58:50] of the story samuel tells him
[58:52] still being a prophet brother brown said
[58:55] he said tomorrow he said the lord
[58:57] has departed from you and tomorrow you
[58:59] and your son will be with me
[59:01] in paradise amen
[59:05] but an old man cometh up
[59:09] so i really thought that was pretty neat
[59:10] because i i i just
[59:14] i just took that in myself that that's
[59:16] what happened but then i went back and
[59:18] read the scripture again and there it
[59:20] says an old man
[59:21] cometh up so they didn't change as much
[59:23] as we change
[59:25] because like i said before jesus christ
[59:27] hadn't died
[59:30] so they were just covered everything was
[59:31] just what brother brown said paradise
[59:33] was a holding place
[59:35] not a rejuvenated place not a wonderful
[59:37] place not a place you don't want to ever
[59:39] go to
[59:40] i mean you that you always want to go
[59:41] and don't want to come back it's a
[59:43] holding place so he put him in a holding
[59:45] place
[59:46] to hold him there until he died at
[59:49] calvary
[59:50] and then he what the old testament
[59:52] saints look let's read
[59:53] number 11. the old testament saints
[59:56] ascended up with his loud voice when he
[59:57] screamed and gave up the ghost because
[59:59] why
[1:00:00] the sacrifice the perpetuation of their
[1:00:02] sins that they had waited on believed
[1:00:04] that
[1:00:05] perfect lamb was coming they had offered
[1:00:08] the sacrifice what the natural lamb
[1:00:11] and when he died and yielded up the
[1:00:13] ghost he screamed with a loud voice and
[1:00:14] the old testament saints awoke
[1:00:16] so that was it what at his rapture so
[1:00:19] now let's go to number 12
[1:00:21] because we know that when jesus died and
[1:00:23] resurrected he brought some of the
[1:00:25] saints with him
[1:00:26] there's not something we need to pick
[1:00:28] out why why he didn't
[1:00:30] why he didn't pick enoch and where's
[1:00:31] moses and where's elijah and
[1:00:33] he just says abraham isaac and different
[1:00:35] ones i'm just going to go what brother
[1:00:37] brown said
[1:00:39] some of the saints the bible says uh
[1:00:41] whoever they pick listen they ain't got
[1:00:42] nothing to do with me and you
[1:00:44] it's just the part of the plan of
[1:00:46] redemption though that we got to cover
[1:00:48] now look
[1:00:50] and now in this vision brother i'm
[1:00:51] talking about now the sixth dimension
[1:00:53] i believe i was caught up to that sixth
[1:00:54] dimension looking back down here and
[1:00:56] could see
[1:00:56] back see the sight isn't exactly
[1:01:00] with the eyes that's earthly
[1:01:04] but sight is a greater thing now what
[1:01:06] took brother branham across the
[1:01:08] curtain of time stick with me just a few
[1:01:10] minutes
[1:01:17] he was a man mortal
[1:01:20] he could see but when he was seeing
[1:01:23] something in another dimension
[1:01:25] that was a revelation that god only knew
[1:01:28] and you know what
[1:01:29] that if you'll think of this with me
[1:01:31] real quick
[1:01:33] that was the actual mind of god because
[1:01:36] he had already thought about it and had
[1:01:38] already seen
[1:01:38] it god god had already seen this and he
[1:01:42] already got it recorded listen
[1:01:44] if your life is recorded and you're
[1:01:47] going to have to give an account for
[1:01:48] your life at the end time
[1:01:50] and every person the same way that
[1:01:52] recorder's running all the time with
[1:01:54] everybody
[1:01:55] except the pride of jesus christ
[1:02:00] and we still have to give an account for
[1:02:01] certain things we'll cover that next
[1:02:03] wednesday night maybe some the bible
[1:02:05] says some man's sins go before
[1:02:08] some sins go after amen so i thank god
[1:02:11] we don't have to stand at the judgment
[1:02:13] bar the white throne judgment but we are
[1:02:15] going to be judged by the little things
[1:02:17] that we do that's why
[1:02:18] when you if you got something you better
[1:02:20] get it out
[1:02:21] man get it straightened with god get it
[1:02:23] straight with whoever you got to get it
[1:02:24] straight with
[1:02:25] and you know what it'll make you feel
[1:02:26] better it'll make you feel a lot better
[1:02:29] why because that load of sin is off of
[1:02:31] you
[1:02:31] and you don't have to worry about that
[1:02:32] knowing that it's gonna cause you know
[1:02:34] what it's gonna do
[1:02:34] it's gonna follow you some men's sins go
[1:02:38] before
[1:02:39] they follow you some come after all
[1:02:41] right
[1:02:42] and now in this vision i believe i was
[1:02:44] caught up in the sixth dimension looking
[1:02:45] back down here and could see back the
[1:02:48] side isn't exactly with the eyes that's
[1:02:50] earthly
[1:02:50] but sight is a greater thing than the
[1:02:52] sight that they have
[1:02:54] there their contact is far
[1:02:57] beyond any contact that our natural
[1:03:00] senses
[1:03:00] with contact now let me
[1:03:06] talk to you just a minute real quick
[1:03:08] look at me
[1:03:11] that thing doesn't change from what's in
[1:03:12] you now to when it's going across
[1:03:14] current time
[1:03:20] think about that the site that they have
[1:03:25] there their contact is far beyond any
[1:03:27] content that our natural senses would
[1:03:29] contact
[1:03:30] does everybody understand what i'm
[1:03:31] saying whatever they had inside of them
[1:03:35] the new birth they had inside of them
[1:03:37] didn't diminish when it went across the
[1:03:39] curtain of time
[1:03:42] so who's diminishing it
[1:03:46] go look in your mirror you're
[1:03:50] diminishing that
[1:03:51] is already inside of you trying to
[1:03:54] develop
[1:03:54] into that stature of a perfect man jesus
[1:03:58] what did jesus tell us he said i do
[1:03:59] nothing
[1:04:00] except the father shows me first
[1:04:04] why because the father was inside of him
[1:04:07] well now wait a minute
[1:04:08] now brother wait you that's just you
[1:04:10] can't have it heirs
[1:04:13] and join heirs whatever he gets
[1:04:17] we get we need to do
[1:04:20] whatever the father he said i only
[1:04:22] please young you know listen we're human
[1:04:24] beings but that's what i've said my
[1:04:26] whole theme is is
[1:04:28] let that thing out that's inside of you
[1:04:30] because that's what
[1:04:31] that's what brother branham saw in that
[1:04:33] other dimension was what
[1:04:34] this shell was gone this interpretation
[1:04:38] that we have this carnal mind
[1:04:40] was gone and they took exactly what was
[1:04:42] here
[1:04:44] listen what took them into that
[1:04:45] dimension
[1:04:47] what they had in this dimension that's
[1:04:50] what took them into that dimension
[1:04:52] was what they already had they didn't
[1:04:54] develop something
[1:04:55] once they got there but once they got
[1:04:57] there though their carnal mind was gone
[1:05:00] their
[1:05:00] their their limited sight was gone
[1:05:04] and they was able to tell brother
[1:05:05] branham if you'll read in one of them
[1:05:07] brother branham that 90 year old woman
[1:05:09] tells brother branham
[1:05:11] what he's got to do
[1:05:15] now reid if you read one of the accounts
[1:05:17] brother brown hugs the late the sister
[1:05:19] and
[1:05:20] and she steps over and talks to another
[1:05:22] sister he said and said oh i said we're
[1:05:24] glad he's here
[1:05:25] and then he said well where's jesus he
[1:05:27] said a little bit higher he said that
[1:05:28] woman turns and says
[1:05:29] you are a leader on earth said jesus
[1:05:32] will come and
[1:05:33] get finds you judge you by what you
[1:05:35] preached and said we'll all be under
[1:05:37] that and we'll come back to earth
[1:05:39] she was telling him because what her
[1:05:41] sight had been done away with
[1:05:43] as far as earthly sight and she had a
[1:05:45] heavenly sight now what's our problem
[1:05:47] our problem is is we've lost our
[1:05:49] connection with that site over there
[1:05:51] i thought we're supposed to if we don't
[1:05:53] have it over here how are they going to
[1:05:54] come this way
[1:05:56] how are they going to ever get here
[1:05:58] unless we let what we already got inside
[1:06:00] of us
[1:06:01] let it out let it change your body
[1:06:05] let it first change your thoughts change
[1:06:07] your body and then they'll want to come
[1:06:09] here
[1:06:10] because remember
[1:06:13] think about this you standing today with
[1:06:16] the new birth with the baptism of the
[1:06:18] holy ghost
[1:06:18] you're that close to the perfection that
[1:06:21] he's talking about
[1:06:22] they're already gone they got to come
[1:06:24] back here and get their body
[1:06:26] you're still in yours you have a chance
[1:06:31] that god can change you while you're
[1:06:33] alive
[1:06:35] if you want to be one of those alive and
[1:06:36] remain some of you are already dead
[1:06:41] well asleep sorry
[1:06:47] one day some of y'all gonna wake up and
[1:06:48] we're gonna be gone
[1:06:51] it ain't gonna be god's fault
[1:06:56] listen i don't care i don't care how
[1:06:57] much you who you are
[1:06:59] when people sleep through a sermon it
[1:07:01] don't make you feel good
[1:07:04] it'll make you feel good it's like
[1:07:05] you're not doing anything they ain't
[1:07:06] nothing there to contact
[1:07:12] it works other places so but it always
[1:07:15] happens it's the new guy you don't know
[1:07:17] what he's going to say
[1:07:18] so you still wait to listen see what you
[1:07:19] can trap him in
[1:07:25] where was i all right so we know
[1:07:28] we know and everybody know we pretty
[1:07:30] much have been told since we were coming
[1:07:32] to message
[1:07:33] how brother brian went across the
[1:07:34] curtain of time and he talked to all
[1:07:35] these young people
[1:07:37] instead of me reading it all i want to
[1:07:38] read you these few things right here and
[1:07:40] then we'll close
[1:07:41] because brother branham talks about
[1:07:44] agape love now they don't have this
[1:07:45] because i had to pull it up later i'm
[1:07:47] something's going on with my zip drive
[1:07:48] it's not putting all my quotes in here
[1:07:50] bob something's boo devil
[1:07:53] some of my quotes well all of my quotes
[1:07:55] on perfect love didn't make it so i'm
[1:07:56] going to read these quotes for you
[1:07:59] real quick because what did the angel
[1:08:01] tell brother branham he said
[1:08:03] whatever is here is perfect love
[1:08:07] this is all perfect love whatever you
[1:08:09] love
[1:08:10] and all those that loved you now
[1:08:12] remember and see people quote that and
[1:08:15] they go well
[1:08:16] i love the prophet so i'm going to be
[1:08:18] there
[1:08:19] because he said the angel said and i'm
[1:08:22] over here in the sixth dimension now
[1:08:23] whatever you love and whoever loved you
[1:08:26] and whoever you love comes remember his
[1:08:27] dog's there
[1:08:28] his horse was there and his chair was
[1:08:31] there
[1:08:32] i don't see how a cherokee loved but but
[1:08:35] it was a desire brother branham
[1:08:38] they repossessed his chair there's a
[1:08:41] repossessed chair in the sixth dimension
[1:08:45] you laugh if you want to but you know i
[1:08:46] saw so much god thought of the prophet
[1:08:48] he gave him everything he needed but
[1:08:51] you're over here in this dimension
[1:08:53] and the angel says everything you love
[1:08:56] and everyone that loved you
[1:08:57] now we got people that that have died
[1:09:01] believing that if they just love the
[1:09:03] prophet
[1:09:04] that they're gonna make it we heard it
[1:09:06] with our own mouth did we not
[1:09:08] well he said everybody love now look
[1:09:11] there's a difference
[1:09:12] because remember there's
[1:09:16] four different kinds of love that's what
[1:09:17] we're gonna talk about just for a minute
[1:09:18] we'll talk already wednesday night
[1:09:19] there's four different kinds of love
[1:09:22] there's what agape love or agapo
[1:09:25] got it and i'll place them right here
[1:09:28] real quick there's philio love
[1:09:30] there's lust and then there's filth
[1:09:33] everybody got that
[1:09:35] now how many loves is in that dimension
[1:09:37] sixth dimension
[1:09:39] one so they were standing in that
[1:09:42] dimension of perfect
[1:09:44] love where the angel says all that love
[1:09:47] you and
[1:09:48] all that you love will be there
[1:09:51] the problem is is these people in this
[1:09:52] dimension
[1:09:54] have still got feel your love and feelio
[1:09:57] love is for your wife or for
[1:09:59] and you go down lower to your kids and
[1:10:01] then go down to you you know you can hug
[1:10:03] your mom
[1:10:05] and not say hug his wife but still feel
[1:10:07] your love so there's a lot of thing goes
[1:10:08] over there then you're going down to
[1:10:10] lust
[1:10:11] but now look once you get over there all
[1:10:13] them other loves go away
[1:10:16] so the only thing i can tell you today
[1:10:18] is if you don't have agape love
[1:10:22] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:10:24] the new birth in your soul
[1:10:26] you're not going there you can love the
[1:10:29] prophet
[1:10:30] with filial love all you want to
[1:10:33] you can love jesus christ with filial
[1:10:36] love
[1:10:36] all you want to in this dimension it
[1:10:39] will not take you to that dimension
[1:10:42] because agape love has got to come from
[1:10:44] that dimension into your soul by the new
[1:10:47] birth listen to this
[1:10:50] adoption 1960. we're still an adoption
[1:10:54] series here
[1:10:56] thus saith the lord it'll take
[1:10:59] perfect love to put you in that place
[1:11:02] for all that there is that for that's
[1:11:05] all there was
[1:11:06] there no matter how many how much
[1:11:09] religious denominations
[1:11:11] how many good deeds you do or whatever
[1:11:13] you've done
[1:11:14] that won't count nothing on that day
[1:11:17] it'll take perfect love so whatever you
[1:11:19] do you lay aside everything else
[1:11:22] until just as filled with the love of
[1:11:23] god till you can love those
[1:11:25] who hate you klamath falls 1960 from
[1:11:29] this time forward brother brown said
[1:11:31] just remember
[1:11:32] i'll say this with the faith that i have
[1:11:33] in that vision whatever it was i'll
[1:11:35] speak in the name of the lord
[1:11:37] except you have that perfect love you'll
[1:11:40] never
[1:11:41] be there watch this because nothing
[1:11:44] could ever be there without
[1:11:46] it listen to this we'll close right here
[1:11:48] musicians get ready to come
[1:11:49] your spirit would be out of place there
[1:11:56] your spirit would be out of place there
[1:11:59] it couldn't come there'd be no way for
[1:12:02] it to come
[1:12:04] now he ain't talking about emotion he
[1:12:05] ain't talking about filial love he's not
[1:12:07] talking about he's talking about what
[1:12:09] except you have the baptism of the holy
[1:12:11] ghost unless you have the new birth
[1:12:14] your spirit your normal spirit can't go
[1:12:17] there
[1:12:18] he'd be out of place it's more place in
[1:12:20] the fifth dimension
[1:12:22] because that's your old self without
[1:12:23] being born again amen
[1:12:28] listen to this
[1:12:31] last one musicians get ready to come
[1:12:34] the bible says in first john 4 18 says
[1:12:36] there is no fear and love
[1:12:39] but perfect love casteth out fear
[1:12:42] do you think any of those people were
[1:12:44] fear they weren't they were not fearful
[1:12:46] of anything in that sixth dimension
[1:12:49] because perfect love cast out fear now
[1:12:51] the problem is is we go from that
[1:12:53] down to filial love where we fear that
[1:12:56] people don't like us we fear that don't
[1:12:58] people don't love us we fear all these
[1:12:59] different things
[1:13:00] because look for fear has torment he
[1:13:03] that feareth
[1:13:04] is not made perfect in love i believe
[1:13:07] god sent the prophet across the curtain
[1:13:09] of time to do away with that fear
[1:13:12] of dying and not knowing where you're
[1:13:14] going you're going to soul sleep are you
[1:13:15] going to just be hanging in thin air
[1:13:16] you're going to be over here
[1:13:18] no you're going to be in perfect love
[1:13:21] glory and not that i love the prophet on
[1:13:24] this side
[1:13:27] that going to get you nowhere
[1:13:30] i thought it was the love of god is what
[1:13:32] puts you there
[1:13:34] now listen you can't love god with
[1:13:36] perfect love hearing not go there
[1:13:38] but you can love anybody you want to
[1:13:40] love the highest level you want to in
[1:13:41] the on this side
[1:13:43] and you miss going over there amen so
[1:13:46] don't tell me don't put that up well i
[1:13:47] just love that prophet i love to hear
[1:13:49] him speak i love
[1:13:50] that's okay but is it perfect love
[1:13:55] or is it filial love is it just a good
[1:13:58] feeling
[1:13:59] or is it something that you've took
[1:14:01] that's different than what it used to be
[1:14:04] that perfect love that cast out fear
[1:14:07] one more before we close musicians come
[1:14:09] on
[1:14:10] the prophet of god tells us that i heard
[1:14:12] a voice that spoke to me in that room
[1:14:15] that said
[1:14:16] this is what you preached was the holy
[1:14:18] ghost
[1:14:19] this is perfect love and nothing can
[1:14:22] enter here without it i am more
[1:14:25] determined than ever in my life
[1:14:27] that it takes perfect love to enter
[1:14:29] there
[1:14:30] there is no jealousy there's no
[1:14:32] tiredness there's no death
[1:14:34] sickness couldn't never in there
[1:14:37] mortality could never make you old
[1:14:41] they could not cry it was just one joy
[1:14:44] oh my precious brother they took me up
[1:14:45] to a great big place we'll read the rest
[1:14:47] of it wednesday we'll continue right
[1:14:48] there
[1:14:49] on perfect love perfect love
[1:15:00] oh i love to come to church see that
[1:15:01] word love has been used so bad
[1:15:03] let's stand our feet that that's been
[1:15:05] used so
[1:15:07] um loosely i guess by the world
[1:15:10] until oh i loved the hunt i loved the
[1:15:12] fish i loved
[1:15:13] this i loved that what love you talking
[1:15:16] about
[1:15:18] if you got four different kinds of love
[1:15:19] a lot of that's lust
[1:15:22] you lust after it you don't love it love
[1:15:24] is the love of god
[1:15:25] or the love you have for your family
[1:15:27] that you'd like brother brown said he
[1:15:29] said look
[1:15:30] he said here's the difference in agape
[1:15:31] love and feel your love
[1:15:33] he said filio love he said if a man put
[1:15:36] his arms around your wife
[1:15:38] he said you'd shoot him and kill him
[1:15:39] that's a direct quote he said you'd
[1:15:41] shoot him and kill him
[1:15:43] he said but if you got agape love he
[1:15:45] said you'll put your arms around him
[1:15:47] and pray for him he said agape love
[1:15:50] versus filial love filio
[1:15:52] love he said it'll make you shoot
[1:15:53] somebody for jealousy being jealous
[1:15:56] because that goes with jealousy and love
[1:15:57] down here but there's no jealousy over
[1:15:59] there
[1:16:00] but the agape love the love of god would
[1:16:02] have you pray for that man could you do
[1:16:04] that
[1:16:06] could you do that can you do that oh we
[1:16:10] love
[1:16:10] i i love bella she's a sweet girl and
[1:16:12] she's never done anything wrong to me
[1:16:13] and i'm saying i've never done anything
[1:16:14] wrong to her but
[1:16:15] boy if she got mad at me and do i still
[1:16:18] love her
[1:16:19] you better with the love of god you're
[1:16:21] supposed to love your enemy more than
[1:16:22] you do your brother
[1:16:24] that's why that brotherly kindness is
[1:16:25] way up there brother john right next to
[1:16:27] the capstone which is perfect love
[1:16:30] right up there close cause brother
[1:16:32] kindness and we'll read it wednesday
[1:16:33] night
[1:16:34] brother brown said that perfect love
[1:16:35] makes you love even your enemies
[1:16:38] people that you know hate you
[1:16:42] but see that's brotherly kind see that's
[1:16:43] not that's not the love down here that
[1:16:45] you get the holy ghost you get the holy
[1:16:46] ghost here
[1:16:47] then you've got your attitudes you gotta
[1:16:49] add that to your faith i add that to
[1:16:51] your virtue i had that i mean add to
[1:16:52] your faith virtue and all those tempers
[1:16:54] patience godliness
[1:16:55] and brotherly kindness perfect love
[1:16:59] that's the only thing that'll go there
[1:17:01] nothing else
[1:17:02] he said nothing he said your spirit in
[1:17:05] other words will not feel at home
[1:17:07] now i want to ask you a question and
[1:17:08] then we'll sing a song now if you have
[1:17:10] the baptism of the holy ghost today
[1:17:12] in your soul does it feel at home
[1:17:18] is this if you feel at home here
[1:17:21] in this then you don't have the right
[1:17:24] spirit
[1:17:25] because this is not our home
[1:17:29] brother branham wanted to stay over
[1:17:30] there more than he wanted to come back
[1:17:32] here and he knew
[1:17:33] he had a job to do but he said do i have
[1:17:36] to go back
[1:17:37] to that he was looking at his whole
[1:17:40] 50-something-year-old body he said do i
[1:17:42] have to go back to that
[1:17:44] angel said yep you're not done yet you
[1:17:46] need to go back
[1:17:48] and thank god he did because then the
[1:17:49] seal is open shortly after that we we
[1:17:52] know that now we're able to go take the
[1:17:54] change of the body
[1:17:55] that they're sure they're locked into
[1:17:57] that dimension we're locked into this
[1:17:59] dimension
[1:17:59] but by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:01] we're actually in that dimension
[1:18:03] we're in another dimension you're by
[1:18:05] when you get a revelation it's not from
[1:18:07] this dimension it's from another
[1:18:08] dimension
[1:18:09] it comes from god it's not it's eternal
[1:18:14] have you ever got a real good revelation
[1:18:16] and forgot it i hadn't
[1:18:18] not a real good one i've had some
[1:18:20] thoughts in my mind
[1:18:22] right right we've had some thoughts in
[1:18:24] our mind and they kind of went
[1:18:26] away but if you ever get a true
[1:18:27] revelation i mean if somebody can talk
[1:18:29] you out
[1:18:31] of there being honored being a trinity
[1:18:32] if they can talk you out of what he what
[1:18:34] he preached wednesday night about no
[1:18:36] eternal hell
[1:18:36] if somebody can talk you say and you say
[1:18:39] well i believe maybe now there is a
[1:18:40] ethanol
[1:18:41] no come on you ain't got what you say
[1:18:43] you got amen
[1:18:44] you didn't get a real revelation because
[1:18:46] real revelation it actually is a part of
[1:18:48] what you are
[1:18:50] amen oh you might get a good thought
[1:18:52] that's human that's that's filio but
[1:18:53] agape love brings something to you that
[1:18:56] no man on this earth
[1:18:57] can ever bring to you no woman can ever
[1:19:00] bring it to you only god himself
[1:19:02] can bring that to you but we'll talk
[1:19:03] about that a little bit wednesday night
[1:19:05] but that sixth dimension
[1:19:06] that's perfect love amen but now
[1:19:09] remember
[1:19:09] one more time what's there
[1:19:12] what was in that old woman was the same
[1:19:16] thing within that old woman here before
[1:19:18] she died
[1:19:21] what's our problem let's sing a song
[1:19:25] what's our problem it's already there
[1:19:26] brother john
[1:19:28] it's already inside of us we're not
[1:19:30] going to gain anything
[1:19:40] you will find he's not too busy
[1:19:46] to hear your hearts cry
[1:20:00] reach out and touch
[1:20:06] listen if you need something today do
[1:20:09] what the song says
[1:20:12] and touch the lord reach out
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:24] he will move
[1:20:41] [Music]
[1:20:45] you need something from job everything
[1:20:47] do it again
[1:21:10] to get through the crowd at all
[1:21:15] [Music]
[1:21:24] one more time
[1:21:32] [Applause]
[1:21:33] [Music]
[1:21:40] is
[1:21:42] hear your heart
[1:21:59] [Music]
[1:22:00] [Applause]
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:05] i can think about that woman that's
[1:22:07] sitting there in that crowd
[1:22:09] jesus turned around and said who touched
[1:22:11] me
[1:22:12] she said if i could touch you know it's
[1:22:14] just like i said you got to make an
[1:22:15] effort
[1:22:16] you got to make an effort if you need
[1:22:18] something you got to make an effort you
[1:22:19] need a job
[1:22:20] go look for a job don't go sitting on
[1:22:23] your couch and
[1:22:25] think god's gonna knock on your door and
[1:22:26] bring in jobs
[1:22:28] or change the warehouse to closer to
[1:22:32] your house
[1:22:34] amen god knows what you need before you
[1:22:37] ask
[1:22:38] him but he still wants you to ask
[1:22:40] because he wants you to put forth an
[1:22:42] effort he wants you to put forth that
[1:22:45] effort and that's the same way i'm
[1:22:47] saying about now
[1:22:48] we've got i want you to know what's
[1:22:50] inside of you
[1:22:52] what you already got not what you're
[1:22:54] going to get what you already got
[1:22:56] because if you got the new bark you've
[1:22:58] got that ball with that dimension
[1:23:01] but we're going to pull them this way
[1:23:04] not pull
[1:23:06] unless you want to go by the grave if
[1:23:08] not then we're going to be pulling them
[1:23:10] this direction
[1:23:11] [Applause]
[1:23:13] but it's not going to be by a child
[1:23:17] it's going to have to be a wife
[1:23:20] the wife has made herself ready
[1:23:24] june and i've been married in 42 years
[1:23:26] she's my wife
[1:23:30] she knows what i need she knows what i
[1:23:31] want i do the same with
[1:23:34] her how many times you've been driving
[1:23:35] down the road and you turn around and
[1:23:37] say the same identical thing to that
[1:23:38] person
[1:23:40] that's not weird that's just even in
[1:23:42] filial love you enter into a place to
[1:23:44] where you and your husband
[1:23:46] why because you've lived with each other
[1:23:48] you've shared experiences you've shared
[1:23:51] you've shared children you've shared all
[1:23:52] the natural things and you enter into a
[1:23:55] place
[1:23:56] well now listen folks if you got the
[1:23:58] baptism of the holy ghost if you got the
[1:23:59] new birth
[1:24:01] he's your husband and you're his bride
[1:24:05] there shouldn't be a separation there
[1:24:08] i thought if we had the mind of christ
[1:24:10] paul said
[1:24:11] the mind of christ will tell us exactly
[1:24:13] what christ is saying hey man
[1:24:16] think about that yes sir
[1:24:42] please
[1:24:56] is
[1:25:10] is
[1:25:24] times
[1:25:37] and then he'll change his heart
[1:25:39] [Music]
[1:25:50] we ask these things in the name of jesus
[1:25:52] christ as we go
[1:25:53] and we're going to see some kind of
[1:25:55] activity lord because you said your word
[1:25:57] will not return void
[1:25:58] then it will accomplish exactly what it
[1:26:00] says in the name of jesus
[1:26:06] amen
[1:26:12] he's not too busy
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:28] [Applause]
[1:26:39] take that with you tomorrow's monday
[1:26:43] that's the devil's day let's take that
[1:26:46] away from him and let it be a good day
[1:26:48] it'll be a good day for all of us
[1:26:51] you know we got um we got
[1:26:55] time on our hands and
[1:26:59] we got brother ray laying in the
[1:27:00] hospital and
[1:27:02] that's just when we dismiss let's just
[1:27:03] pray a prayer for him
[1:27:07] there's no distance between here and
[1:27:10] athens georgia for god
[1:27:12] brother ray's been a he's been an
[1:27:14] integral part of this
[1:27:16] congregation for a long time 25 years i
[1:27:18] think he said
[1:27:20] so it would be hoovless to just
[1:27:24] not worry about leaving right now if you
[1:27:27] got something better to do you walk out
[1:27:29] the door now
[1:27:31] but we're going to pray for brother ray
[1:27:32] and we're going to pray earnest prayer
[1:27:36] just like he's sitting right here in
[1:27:37] front of us and just like he's your
[1:27:39] natural
[1:27:40] brother because he's your spiritual
[1:27:41] brother which makes him more than your
[1:27:42] natural brother
[1:27:43] amen because a natural brother we we've
[1:27:46] got a brother laying there that
[1:27:48] that's a spiritual brother that's been
[1:27:49] with us for a while and kathy we need to
[1:27:51] pray for her too
[1:27:53] um even if she does have to make
[1:27:54] decisions um
[1:27:57] thank the lord that mary the red cross
[1:27:59] is flying her over here for free so i
[1:28:01] don't know when she's going to get here
[1:28:02] but
[1:28:03] but we pray that even though brother ray
[1:28:05] they raised
[1:28:06] god can raise him right up out of the
[1:28:07] bed he still needs to see his family
[1:28:10] he still needs to know that they're
[1:28:11] right there with him amen but he needs
[1:28:13] to know that the
[1:28:13] spiritual family we can't go dad tried
[1:28:15] to go yesterday and they turned him away
[1:28:17] with all this junk going on at the
[1:28:18] hospitals
[1:28:19] you can't get in but we know somebody
[1:28:22] can
[1:28:23] amen remember brother branham one time
[1:28:26] he couldn't go in i said you can't go in
[1:28:28] you can't go in you know what he's done
[1:28:29] remember he found a nurse and they put
[1:28:31] him on like he was an intern they put
[1:28:33] he's a way you can get in maybe not now
[1:28:36] as much as
[1:28:36] not yet now as much as then they got
[1:28:39] cameras and everything but back then
[1:28:40] brother brown was going to pray for that
[1:28:41] person he didn't care what so they
[1:28:43] loaded him up made him look like a nurse
[1:28:44] and put him in the he went in the
[1:28:46] hospital and prayed for that lady so
[1:28:48] we're going to pray now for brother ray
[1:28:50] and then we'll be dismissed
[1:28:51] and go with god we love you with love
[1:28:53] with lord we'll see you on wednesday

[1:30:40] and you took it to your bosom at calvary
[1:30:42] and you died and said it's finished
[1:30:45] but lord we have to believe that it's
[1:30:47] already done
[1:30:48] even the prophet said if you came back
[1:30:50] lord in a suit of clothes and stood in

[1:31:58] you've destroyed the works of the devil
[1:32:01] we just got to believe that
[1:32:03] that when you died at calvary you even
[1:32:04] went down to hell and took the keys he
[1:32:06] doesn't even have keys to his own house
[1:32:07] he can't put us in or take us out
[1:32:09] lord we go in willingly father i pray
[1:32:11] that we willingly today will
[1:32:13] even as we go home that we'll
[1:32:14] continually remember our brethren
[1:32:16] and his name will come up lord many many
[1:32:19] times if you have to wake us up at night
[1:32:20] lord i pray wake us up
[1:32:22] so that we'll call his name and pray for
[1:32:24] our little brother lord
[1:32:26] many prayers are going around the world
[1:32:27] for him also lord as several have called
[1:32:30] from around the country lord asking
[1:32:32] about our brother ray he's known for
[1:32:33] a lot of people he's he lord i believe
[1:32:36] he's been a servant of yours for a long
[1:32:38] time
[1:32:39] and i pray now that that will go to him
[1:32:41] lord
[1:32:43] and that it'll heal him for your honor
[1:32:45] and glory
[1:32:47] let the doctors do what they can do give
[1:32:48] them wisdom to do what they can do
[1:32:51] but father they can't heal they can only
[1:32:54] do the things they know to do but you're
[1:32:56] the healer
[1:32:57] and we pray in the name of the lord
[1:32:59] jesus christ that you would strengthen
[1:33:00] that whole family
[1:33:02] give them strength for the little
[1:33:03] journey that they're going through lord
[1:33:05] and
[1:33:05] any of us the brother kali and all the
[1:33:07] different ones that's been through
[1:33:08] certain journeys

[1:33:11] that when we come out on the other side
[1:33:13] we say thank you god
[1:33:14] thank you lord for thinking of me as a
[1:33:16] child being your child lord
[1:33:19] but lord i pray that from this day
[1:33:20] forward that we grow up
[1:33:23] that we're not being crying babies
[1:33:24] anymore lord that we will be
[1:33:26] adults that we'll be able to know the
[1:33:29] mind of god when it comes to us
[1:33:31] lord we know that you've given us lord
[1:33:33] the new birth you've given us lord the
[1:33:35] baptism
[1:33:36] of the holy ghost now i pray lord as
[1:33:38] i've said before
[1:33:39] that we let that thing out and let it
[1:33:40] live let it do what it was accomplished
[1:33:43] what it was set here to do to accomplish
[1:33:45] a change of a body lord though we get
[1:33:48] older though
[1:33:49] many things happen as in abraham lord he
[1:33:52] got 99 years old and then finally lord i
[1:33:54] believe he looked up one day and said
[1:33:56] i can't do it anymore so lord as we look
[1:33:59] up to you today we can't do it anymore
[1:34:02] we can't try to figure this thing out
[1:34:04] we're just going to believe
[1:34:05] lord that you'll do what you said in
[1:34:07] your word that you'll heal our brethren
[1:34:09] that you'll heal each one of us lord
[1:34:11] give us all a
[1:34:12] rejuvenation of the baptism of the holy
[1:34:14] ghost give us a refilling father
[1:34:16] so that it'll clean out some of the
[1:34:17] flues that we have stopped up to lord
[1:34:19] we pray that you'd be with each one lord
[1:34:21] take care of each one on the highways be
[1:34:23] with them in their jobs
[1:34:24] the different things that they do in
[1:34:25] life lord we pray that it'll be done for
[1:34:27] your honor and glory in jesus name we
[1:34:28] ask these things
[1:34:30] amen you're dismissed god bless you
