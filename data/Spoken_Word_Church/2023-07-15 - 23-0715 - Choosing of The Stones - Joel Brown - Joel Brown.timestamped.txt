[6:33] we thank the Lord for our wonderful
[6:35] pastors here brother Sandra Dale has
[6:39] meant so much in all of us all of us I
[6:43] remember when I was doing missionary
[6:45] work down in the Grenada DNA Islands in
[6:48] a place called Pizza me Monica and I met
[6:51] this saint there and she said to me
[6:53] brother Andre I have a tape and I've
[6:56] learned so much on predestination and I
[6:58] asked her who is the pastor who's
[7:01] preaching on that tape she said it's a

[7:26] election ordination many things that
[7:28] you've taught us over there through the
[7:30] scriptures that's helped us to know who
[7:33] we are and where we come from and so we
[7:35] thank the Lord for our precious brother
[7:37] Dale and you can't forget sister Peggy
[7:41] and she is so special and except the
[7:44] community
[7:47] thank you
[7:50] assistant baby I'm not quoting from a
[7:53] country song that we love a lady that
[7:56] stands by her man
[8:00] unless you really amen amen
[8:04] how we thank the Lord for brother Wilson
[8:07] Anderson Wilson what a teacher of the
[8:10] scripture amen you know when I first
[8:13] heard brother Wilson many many years ago
[8:16] and there was a couple of Brothers
[8:17] Brother Joseph Kansas and I Brother
[8:19] Moore and different ones and I thought
[8:22] Mom what a wonderful gift that God has
[8:25] placed in Brother Richard Wilson's
[8:28] Ministry his life man and brother Wilson
[8:31] you are indeed when Jesus or the Apostle
[8:34] Paul quoted in Ephesians his father
[8:36] speaking of the gifts that God gave to
[8:38] his body office gifts that he put for
[8:41] the perfecting of the Saints and one of
[8:44] those gifts not only pastor but also a
[8:46] teacher to be able to teach and show us
[8:49] where we are in this scripture and so
[8:51] let's just give the Lord a handful of
[8:54] them
[8:54] [Applause]

[9:13] we're their neighbors they've been there
[9:15] for many years and so they were making
[9:18] reference to the neighbors but the other
[9:21] neighbors and when they were talking
[9:24] about the other neighbors I was telling
[9:26] my wife I'm glad we're not those

[14:34] okay
[14:56] [Music]
[15:06] Disney go it
[15:08] is anyone
[15:11] anyone things are already different so
[15:13] it took how many is nervous
[15:16] raise your hand to be nervous
[15:18] I got mine up
[15:24] I bring you greetings from Word of Life
[15:26] Church formerly Happy Valley
[15:28] Reagan's pastor and God is just good
[15:31] that's all we can say now it's not so
[15:34] much that you know who I am
[15:36] other than Joel Brown I'm just an old
[15:39] simple country boy from Virginia
[15:40] originally grew up in a holler
[15:44] no running water
[15:46] we carried in total fence just like the
[15:48] prophet talked about just simple poor
[15:50] people
[15:51] and um you know
[15:55] but one day I met somebody
[15:57] who changed my life forever now I grew
[16:00] up in the message per se I was about two
[16:02] years old my mom began you wouldn't have
[16:03] receipt for just a moment
[16:05] when my mom just to do a little bit of
[16:07] an introduction to
[16:09] get rid of some of my nervousness I know
[16:12] some of you are wondering
[16:14] because there's nosy people everywhere
[16:16] you go
[16:18] now this is just me I'm gonna be me all
[16:21] right
[16:22] because quite frankly I don't know how
[16:23] to be anybody else so if you're looking
[16:26] for somebody that you can just tweak a
[16:28] little bit and make them do and say what
[16:29] you want them to do do I need that one
[16:32] okay so if you're looking for somebody
[16:34] that you can manipulate I'm not the man
[16:37] I'm not the person huh
[16:42] just a just a a simple simple guy but
[16:47] coming to know before my mom was about I
[16:49] was about two years old and my mom
[16:50] started going to a message church so I
[16:52] grew up in the message and I was
[16:54] familiar with that voice
[16:56] but but one day when I was in college
[17:00] actually almost 21 years old there was
[17:02] just something happened in my life and
[17:05] to this day I I I don't remember the
[17:07] exactly what was said I went to a
[17:10] meeting on campus it was a minister
[17:11] there uh just a denominational guy and
[17:14] he held Services periodically
[17:20] and just something spoke to me and said
[17:22] it's your time it's your your time so
[17:24] there was no uh flashing lights the
[17:27] ground didn't shake and all of that but
[17:29] it was just my time and maybe something
[17:32] to tonight will be said in this service
[17:34] that will change your life forever now
[17:37] there's two things that I'm certain of
[17:40] two things that I'm certain of for this
[17:42] service is that
[17:44] I'm a
[17:46] simple
[17:47] and I know that I'm supposed to be here
[17:49] [Music]
[17:50] and because of those two things it
[17:52] allows me to know one more thing that
[17:54] there's going to be somebody whose life
[17:56] is going to be impacted now the Bible
[17:58] tells us that those once you are
[18:01] converted strengthen your breath
[18:04] now I've come to say it this way those
[18:07] of you who are Sanctified who are saved
[18:09] and are okay in your walk with the Lord
[18:11] you can strengthen your brother your
[18:13] sister that's sitting beside you by
[18:14] saying Amen to the word of God because
[18:16] that amen will begin to create an
[18:18] atmosphere amen
[18:23] praise the Lord but God is good
[18:26] A little unconventional this is it
[18:29] totally completely out of the ordinary
[18:31] for me I was so I was talking about
[18:33] being nervous I was so nervous I forgot
[18:36] to print out my notes
[18:38] so don't don't be don't be fooled by
[18:42] this thing I don't I don't do it you
[18:44] know this is this is not me this is not
[18:46] how I normally do things but so with
[18:49] that being so I know God's going to do
[18:51] something special
[18:54] amen
[18:55] God is good
[18:57] I don't think I'm gonna sing I won't do
[18:59] that I I do say that I don't think
[19:02] so God bless you musicians thank you
[19:03] amen so this is a youth service how many
[19:07] young folks we got in the place tonight
[19:09] praise it I expect to see every hand
[19:12] because see we're on our way to an
[19:14] eternal youth service so we're just
[19:16] getting in practice for that youth
[19:18] service
[19:18] let me ask that question again how many
[19:21] young folks we have in the bill
[19:32] amen get stirred up tonight
[19:36] praise the Lord if you have your
[19:39] adoption papers stand with me your Bible
[19:42] that's your adoption paper saints
[19:45] come on now I need some amens I can't do
[19:48] this
[19:50] hmm well the way talking about
[19:52] left-handed total and preachers being in
[19:55] our right Minds I hope to give you my
[19:57] whole heart tonight
[19:58] yeah
[20:01] but my heart accepted the door dropped
[20:03] in my heart to give to you a special
[20:06] gift
[20:07] from God himself
[20:09] amen turn me to be the first Samuel 17.
[20:14] first Samuel chapter 17 and verse 40.
[20:17] my my isn't God good
[20:20] isn't he wonderful
[20:22] while I'm thinking of it my wife my two
[20:25] sons and our three sons are here and
[20:28] some of our friends from South Carolina
[20:29] some of our family friends from South
[20:32] Carolina but one of one of one of the
[20:35] young girls had a she had a seizure
[20:38] episode right before they was getting
[20:40] ready to leave all remember her in
[20:41] prayer
[20:42] it's the devil stirring once again
[20:46] but God is good first Samuel 17 verse 20
[20:49] so they they would have been here my
[20:51] wife would have even been here if she
[20:52] wanted wanted to come
[20:56] 40 and it reads and he took his staff in
[21:00] his hand and chose him five smooth
[21:02] stones
[21:03] out of the brook
[21:05] and put them in a shepherd's bag which
[21:07] he had even in the script and his sling
[21:09] was in his hand and he drew near to the
[21:11] Felicity let us bow our heads Heavenly
[21:14] Father
[21:15] it's an honor
[21:17] of standing before your purchase or
[21:20] tonight and orders I've already shared
[21:22] with the people I'm just a simple person
[21:24] and I have nothing Within Myself to
[21:27] bring I have no agenda no objective I
[21:30] have no ulterior motive other than to
[21:34] show forth your glory and to express
[21:37] your heart to your people tonight or God
[21:39] may we be changed by the things that we
[21:42] hear May that we be changed by the
[21:45] things that we receive that we know that
[21:47] your word is light and your word is life
[21:50] so illuminate our paths dear God by your
[21:54] very word your very presence change even
[21:57] more so now the atmosphere in this room
[21:59] you come on the scene and do what only
[22:02] you can do and do as you've done many
[22:04] times before
[22:05] in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[22:08] amen you may have deceased
[22:10] it's good to know the Lord is it not
[22:13] but you know I'm sharing with the
[22:15] brothers yesterday some of them even
[22:16] more so it's better to be known of him
[22:20] there are so many people that can say
[22:21] they know the Lord but does the Lord
[22:23] know you has he came and identified
[22:26] himself within you
[22:30] the prophet tells tells us that in the
[22:33] message hearing him I think back in 1956
[22:35] he says we must be inspired by the word
[22:37] of God listen that will bring God to his
[22:40] word and make it act and do like it did
[22:44] in the days of old
[22:46] so the word in itself will do nothing
[22:51] you can sit and you can read the word of
[22:53] God but the prophet tells us we have to
[22:55] be inspired by the word of God
[22:59] and sometimes I heard this just the
[23:01] other day sometimes when we read the
[23:03] word of God there's no effect there's no
[23:05] emotion there's nothing happens it's
[23:08] just it's just dry
[23:11] but that don't mean we stop just because
[23:13] that's so because even in the natural
[23:15] realm with natural food
[23:17] you don't stop eating just because you
[23:19] didn't like what you ate you come back
[23:21] and you get some more and eventually
[23:24] it's so Inspire your taste buds that you
[23:27] wanna you wanna go home and make that
[23:28] very thing
[23:29] [Music]
[23:30] so maybe something will be on the buffet
[23:34] tonight
[23:35] that will suit your taste and you will
[23:38] take it home you say I want to concoct
[23:40] that same recipe at home
[23:42] but to be inspired by this word of God
[23:46] now
[23:47] in our opening scripture and I pray
[23:50] truly that I won't be long and I'm
[23:52] really not a long-winded preacher but I
[23:54] know a big God with a lot of things to
[23:56] say
[23:58] I'll just I'll just place it that way is
[24:00] that all right
[24:03] but I I want us to to just think of the
[24:07] thought uh this evening
[24:09] the choosing of the stones we're all
[24:12] familiar in fact this very story David
[24:15] and Goliath is probably one of the most
[24:17] told stories in all the description
[24:19] we've learned it since we were just a
[24:21] little bitty talks little bitty things
[24:22] and so we've heard it over and over and
[24:25] over but something a few months ago
[24:27] captivated my heart
[24:29] with just this very act alone of him
[24:32] going to that Brook and choosing those
[24:35] stones
[24:37] he was preparing himself for battle
[24:39] [Music]
[24:40] and he didn't even realize what he was
[24:42] up against he didn't even know what he
[24:44] was going to be faced with he didn't
[24:46] even know what he would hear that would
[24:48] cause him to be truly hunted or inspired
[24:52] by God himself but the choosing of the
[24:55] stones
[24:57] and so I sang in my prayer we know that
[25:00] God is light and God is life and and we
[25:02] know how the prophet displays it that
[25:04] that God in his mind he had all of these
[25:07] thoughts and these attributes and he
[25:09] wanted he was just God he existed by
[25:12] himself he was just God with his
[25:13] thoughts and he began to express those
[25:16] thoughts and and the way the prophet
[25:18] places if you all forgive me
[25:20] I'm gonna shut up right here oh Mom if
[25:23] if you all the folks didn't have to have
[25:25] every word y'all again y'all got the
[25:27] wrong guy
[25:30] blame it on another way he was the one
[25:32] that called me
[25:35] you're welcome
[25:38] but
[25:42] the tremendous effect of the word of God
[25:45] as it went forth as he spoke those
[25:46] things the prophet began to say was like
[25:48] a a clinker he spoke it and and and
[25:51] those words
[25:53] projected out and it it failed for maybe
[25:55] millions of years and then he stopped it
[25:57] it was a storm was the Earth all of
[25:59] these things beginning to come forth but
[26:01] but as he
[26:03] projected those words there had to be
[26:06] something to receive those thoughts
[26:08] those words there had to be something
[26:10] that that would be a receding post
[26:13] for what God was giving out and there
[26:15] there has to be tonight in this service
[26:17] there has to be somebody someone to
[26:20] receive this word
[26:22] because God doesn't do anything without
[26:25] purpose
[26:27] God has never been without a witness
[26:31] since the beginning of time there has
[26:33] always been someone who can testify to
[26:36] the realities and to the the the
[26:38] fullness of who God was
[26:40] to give an effect to to respond to what
[26:43] God was doing
[26:45] so a receiving post
[26:48] there's something that that's going out
[26:50] that's being projected
[26:52] and just because it's not happening
[26:54] within you right now just because it may
[26:56] not be happening at your church the
[27:05] start of one man Lou it's not a one
[27:08] Church move it's a body move as I often
[27:11] said so many times you get up in the
[27:13] middle of the night and you stop that
[27:15] little bitty pinky toe on the bedpost
[27:20] the little toe I don't know how that
[27:22] thing hurts
[27:23] is that right
[27:25] and what do you do that one member you
[27:28] take these five or these ten
[27:30] things that you go and you minister to
[27:32] that need
[27:35] God said to tell you that to say this if
[27:38] you know somebody's in trouble don't
[27:39] just dismiss them because of who they
[27:42] are and who what they've done to you or
[27:43] what they said to you you go minister to
[27:46] a need this is about a new
[27:49] way let's shut up
[27:53] the receiving post the prophet says and
[27:56] if you can be the receiving post to
[27:59] receive the word of God then it's real
[28:01] to you listen to how he says this then
[28:03] it's real to you and it'll live like it
[28:06] was then
[28:08] people say well I want to do something
[28:10] for the Lord be a receiving host and the
[28:14] moment that you receive something from
[28:16] him to receive the word of God then it
[28:19] becomes real to you
[28:22] huh
[28:23] the voice of God is ascending post so
[28:25] there has to be a receiving host and the
[28:29] voice begins to pulse out in conduit or
[28:31] carrier of the juice as the old folks is
[28:34] as I said I'm just a retouchable way we
[28:37] called it juice when I was growing up
[28:40] you flip that switch you know forgive me
[28:42] like we didn't flip a switch we pulled
[28:44] that chain in the center
[28:46] we didn't have switches
[28:50] just poor old chain in the middle of the
[28:52] of the ceiling light bulb screwed in to
[28:54] a socket but there was juice there was
[28:58] power
[28:58] [Music]
[28:59] yeah
[29:00] and so here we have in in the natural
[29:04] realm of that that very thought the
[29:06] power of the juice there had to be a
[29:08] carrier of that current that circuit
[29:11] there had to be something to carry that
[29:13] and from the line to the transformer
[29:15] into the house and and all that these
[29:17] reducers and all of these things so all
[29:21] that is the juice or the power once
[29:24] you've become that receiving post
[29:25] everything that the juice is everything
[29:29] that the power that the two embody is
[29:32] now in
[29:34] in you and it'll make you walk right
[29:36] it'll make you talk right it'll make you
[29:38] treat everybody wrong
[29:42] we have to love Saints that's that's the
[29:44] embodiment of who Jesus Christ that's
[29:47] what he came to do is to show us how to
[29:49] love
[29:50] and if we can't love right then we've
[29:52] missed the whole thing
[29:54] don't care how much you rally around God
[29:56] sent a problem if you're not loving
[29:58] right
[29:59] everybody
[30:00] everybody don't care what they look like
[30:03] what they smell like what they've done
[30:05] what they are doing what they're going
[30:06] to do we have to love
[30:09] and I love what they're doing but we
[30:12] have to love
[30:13] but this juice this power sometimes
[30:16] there's an interruption in the
[30:18] connection
[30:19] and what happens
[30:21] there's no more power
[30:23] everything goes quiet
[30:25] you're gonna flip that switch and
[30:26] nothing happens you sit down to read the
[30:28] word of God and nothing is ignited
[30:30] nothing happens because somewhere the
[30:33] conduit has been clogged somehow someway
[30:36] you've lost power
[30:38] but the reality with that thing is the
[30:41] power has to be restored in order for
[30:45] you to be sustained in your life in your
[30:47] journey
[30:48] you can't go through this Walk of Life
[30:51] without the power the juice of God
[30:55] you can't do it
[30:57] especially with the forces and then
[30:59] everything that that's encroaching in
[31:01] upon the land today
[31:05] because
[31:12] it's encroaching him it's it's tight
[31:15] yeah you've got to have power to escape
[31:17] these things the choosing of the stones
[31:20] we're we're here we're just filming
[31:22] Foundation
[31:24] but there has to be a restoration of
[31:25] power and until
[31:27] that power is restored
[31:30] till that force of Life comes back into
[31:33] the house so to speak into the body
[31:36] is is
[31:38] the the house as far as it being a house
[31:42] is no longer effective it can't function
[31:44] in the fullness of it being a house you
[31:46] can't function fully as a child of God
[31:48] if the source of if the power is not
[31:50] fully coming in yet
[31:53] [Music]
[31:56] the pulsation get this yet the pulsation
[31:59] this is simple I know but I'm a simple
[32:01] person because you know my I say this
[32:03] constantly my simple understanding is
[32:06] going to Simply get me out of here one
[32:07] day
[32:09] I have no desire to try to complicate
[32:11] this thing in fact I don't know how to
[32:13] do it anyway
[32:14] only thing I know is to tell how I know
[32:17] it
[32:17] thank you
[32:20] tell it how I know it
[32:22] but even though there's an interruption
[32:24] in the source of power the pulsation is
[32:27] still there the fullness of its
[32:30] potential has not diminished in force
[32:32] the fullness of its potential has not
[32:34] diminished in power or ability
[32:38] God is going to be God with you or
[32:40] without you
[32:41] [Music]
[32:43] you may think that you're all that and
[32:46] that God really needs
[32:47] his work done no he don't
[32:50] he don't belong
[32:54] because the power of that juice the
[32:57] power of the the force the fullness of
[33:00] that power is still pulsating it is
[33:02] trying to get it's still being carried
[33:04] through the line it's trying and it's
[33:06] right there it's right there at the
[33:09] socket it's it's right there all we have
[33:12] to do is plug in
[33:14] get connected
[33:17] you think you can stay away from church
[33:18] no that's not gonna work
[33:21] no you've got to be connected to the
[33:25] source of power
[33:28] and oftentimes all it takes is
[33:30] inspiration to get that that power back
[33:33] on
[33:34] [Music]
[33:35] inspiration on the spiritual side of
[33:38] things
[33:40] we find out in Matthew 26 Mark 14 and
[33:44] Luke 7. we're introduced to a woman who
[33:47] didn't realize she was recently she that
[33:49] she herself was a receiving post for the
[33:52] power of the most high God she didn't
[33:54] know it Mary the prostitute
[33:57] she didn't realize who she was
[34:01] because the circumstances of her life
[34:05] the things that she had done brought up
[34:07] on her a reputation that was vile and
[34:10] looked down upon
[34:12] upon by those around her
[34:15] because of the circumstances saying that
[34:17] she herself had done regardless if it
[34:20] was something that happened in her life
[34:21] that caused her to be be that way or
[34:23] things that that took place in her life
[34:24] is irregardless in respect to what I'm
[34:27] trying to bring tonight but the fact is
[34:29] where she was was
[34:32] not giving her the ability to know that
[34:35] she could be plugged into that source
[34:38] and as the accusers begin to throw their
[34:41] tongues around at her and all of these
[34:43] things were going on and we know that it
[34:45] was there the feasts at Simon's house
[34:47] you're familiar with the story and I
[34:49] know you're well versed in these things
[34:50] so I'm gonna I'm gonna skip on a lot of
[34:52] the details you all just kill it in
[34:54] later
[34:55] but even in the midst of where she was
[34:57] and her condition of her life and all of
[35:00] these these these men railing
[35:02] accusations that are wondering why she
[35:04] was here
[35:05] Jesus
[35:07] said to her of the accusers he said let
[35:10] her alone
[35:13] let her alone
[35:14] [Music]
[35:16] sometimes we listen sometimes we go to
[35:19] Medellin where we don't need to be
[35:20] mental
[35:23] Jesus is saying let her alone
[35:27] because you see saying
[35:28] self-righteousness will always always
[35:31] cause you to overlook others and exclude
[35:34] them from the economy of God
[35:37] a self-righteous spirit will exclude and
[35:40] keep me oh it's just gonna be me
[35:45] ain't nobody saved but me
[35:49] ain't nobody saved but me ain't nobody
[35:52] saying well maybe two or three
[35:55] ain't nobody saving me
[35:58] self-righteousness
[36:00] will cause you to exclude others
[36:03] and it's always some practices is always
[36:06] ready to send others to hell
[36:08] and not realizing the state that they're
[36:10] in is going to take them there too
[36:12] is that right it's tight Saints remember
[36:16] the prophet talked about that woman she
[36:17] was walking that line in those High
[36:20] he'll choose
[36:21] and they got a little more narrow to
[36:23] what the furthest and the closer she got
[36:25] and she began to wobble and Teeter
[36:28] take off your spiritual high-heeled
[36:30] shoes I pray to God you don't have any
[36:32] real ones on
[36:36] it's by the way it's false
[36:40] so here she was she was trapped in a
[36:43] condition that nobody would ever
[36:45] think about that
[36:47] trapped in a condition that no one was
[36:49] there to help him
[36:50] she might herself even believe that
[36:52] there was no hope for her
[36:55] because she's gone so long in this
[36:57] lifestyle hearing things
[37:00] trapped in that condition
[37:02] [Music]
[37:03] she's gone so long in that that she
[37:05] began to believe it possibly even
[37:07] herself
[37:08] and after all she was the one that
[37:10] committed these acts it was her there
[37:12] was nobody else that didn't
[37:14] she was guilty of the active self and
[37:18] the things that she did huh now you cute
[37:22] folks can think that I don't I believe
[37:24] that that you've never done anything
[37:25] wrong if you want to
[37:29] we forget where we come from sometimes
[37:32] sakes
[37:34] I know we were Justified just as I never
[37:37] did I know all those quotes but
[37:39] self-righteousness will keep you out of
[37:41] the Kingdom
[37:43] praise God for our position in Christ
[37:45] and where we are
[37:47] but there's more to this thing than you
[37:52] I gotta find a hiding place
[37:55] [Music]
[37:59] but the thing is she happened to come
[38:02] upon a scene one day and the outcome
[38:05] would bring power back to her house
[38:08] she came up on the scene Jesus with
[38:11] dirty feet weren't for me with the
[38:13] the message that the prophet spoken and
[38:15] I'm always amazed at listening to that
[38:18] how it would just break him he just
[38:20] began to weep and cry and he couldn't
[38:21] you know the leadest man I know and all
[38:23] these messages just break him couldn't
[38:26] even preach but here Jesus was with
[38:28] dirty feet how could we come to a
[38:31] service and not welcome him in
[38:34] [Music]
[38:36] young people you've got a role
[38:39] you have something to do
[38:42] you can wash his feet too and then you
[38:46] can do these things
[38:48] brother Brown says of Mary here he says
[38:52] that she only had to be inspired to go
[38:56] into action
[38:58] she only had to be inspired
[39:01] she wasn't even supposed to be where she
[39:03] was
[39:04] she was already doing something that
[39:06] probably illegal or that that she wasn't
[39:08] even in the proper place but inspiration
[39:11] struck her heart she peeped through and
[39:14] she saw him there she said how in the
[39:16] world could could this I've heard about
[39:18] him and now I see him with my own eyes
[39:20] how could it be that he's sitting there
[39:22] with dirty feet
[39:23] how could the people come to the house
[39:25] of God with Andre how could they be
[39:27] hearing the word of God and just sit
[39:29] there and not be inspired not being who
[39:31] I don't understand it
[39:35] I know the problem talks about my people
[39:38] the black people being you hey
[39:41] inspiration will cause zizo white feet
[39:44] to move sometimes
[39:46] too
[39:46] tell me I'm wrong
[39:49] huh because he said anything without
[39:52] emotion is what
[39:53] dead what do you do with dead things you
[39:56] bury them
[39:58] huh
[40:00] okay
[40:03] all right
[40:05] that's okay don't be scared
[40:07] don't be afraid
[40:10] but inspiration she only had to be
[40:12] inspired to go into action she went
[40:14] forward without anything listen to how
[40:15] the prophet words is she went forward
[40:17] without anything showing she could do
[40:20] [Music]
[40:22] there was nothing that she could lay her
[40:25] hands on there was no scripture there
[40:27] was no quote of the prophet
[40:29] lay your hands on and say definitively I
[40:32] can do this thing no she was inspired to
[40:35] do what she did
[40:38] and he goes on to say and she went forth
[40:41] on her inspiration
[40:43] [Music]
[40:46] we are well familiar with the story of
[40:48] Job
[40:51] gather into the stones talking about
[40:54] inspiration being that con being that
[40:56] that receiving post
[40:58] here we have another individual
[41:01] who who was hunted by inspiration
[41:04] but the thing was even with job he too
[41:06] lost power to his house
[41:09] is that right everything that he knew
[41:12] everything that he had he lost it was
[41:14] gone even his wife was talking crazy
[41:17] his little sweetheart his Queen
[41:21] so somewhere along the way he lost power
[41:24] but unlike Mary that we were just
[41:26] talking about Job the prophet talks
[41:29] about Joe had the mechanics in order he
[41:31] had everything he he he he he knew all
[41:34] the rituals he he had it all in order
[41:36] the mechanics were right there he was
[41:38] just lacking the Dynamics in Prophet
[41:41] said
[41:42] now message folk don't like to hear
[41:45] those things
[41:46] my Dynamics
[41:49] let a storm will come ruined in your
[41:51] house
[41:52] you know the thing about homosexuality
[41:55] and why am I going here morning Mercy
[41:56] little thing about this that that very
[41:58] thing is it's it's it's it's round
[42:00] against until it happens in your house
[42:03] dude comes knocking on your door yeah
[42:06] until it's your little baby your
[42:07] granddaughter
[42:09] have mercy
[42:12] is that right
[42:16] but Joe
[42:18] he was just lacking the Dynamics and
[42:20] it's interesting I think the prophet
[42:22] says Joe needed a Channel of inspiration
[42:25] he had it open
[42:26] Mary didn't even have a channel
[42:28] to know that she could be a receiver of
[42:31] power
[42:32] and here you have an individual that had
[42:34] a channel
[42:36] and he had it he even had his channel
[42:38] open
[42:40] because the prophet says he had a
[42:42] channel to communicate with God by his
[42:44] inters job was a prophet
[42:48] prophet
[42:51] I ain't doing that I don't shut up on
[42:53] that I'll get in trouble
[42:55] but he had a channel to communicate with
[42:57] God by his inspiration he had listened
[43:00] away the prophet I love this he had a
[43:01] way of moving himself out
[43:04] and let the word of God move it oh my
[43:07] job had a way of moving himself out of
[43:09] the way and giving God the opportunity
[43:12] to move
[43:13] [Music]
[43:17] I shall not be I shall not be moved
[43:22] that's what some people do they sing
[43:24] that song and they moved one in 50 years
[43:28] shame on you
[43:30] you're going to a land of Eternal Bliss
[43:34] we're going to a land of Eternal youth
[43:37] he said when my back hurts I don't care
[43:39] praise the Lord anyhow
[43:41] not being told us to her I just have to
[43:43] praise the God praise the Lord anyhow
[43:46] [Applause]
[43:48] sometimes we gotta praise our way
[43:51] through our circumstances
[43:52] [Music]
[43:53] [Applause]
[43:55] Joe couldn't get a word from God but the
[43:59] prophet says I love this Joe couldn't
[44:01] get a word from God but the devil
[44:03] couldn't move him
[44:04] yeah
[44:06] I haven't heard not speak and deal with
[44:10] me I haven't felt the move of God in
[44:12] years but the devil could not move you
[44:16] you
[44:17] young people let that be your foundation
[44:20] tonight
[44:21] you settlement with your walk with the
[44:23] lord the devil is not going to lose me
[44:27] even though he slayed me I'm still gonna
[44:29] trust him
[44:32] because the prophet said Joe had a grip
[44:35] on God could you could you imagine that
[44:38] this Prophet this man of God he had such
[44:40] a grit on God why because it was a
[44:42] revelation
[44:45] and once you get a revelation there's
[44:47] nobody anywhere that can take that thing
[44:50] away from you
[44:51] from you it don't matter if Mama
[44:52] understands that Daddy understands that
[44:54] Grandma who you love with all your heart
[44:56] understanding it's a revelation that's
[44:58] just for you
[44:59] [Music]
[45:01] I was preaching just a few weeks back
[45:04] and as I was ministering this little
[45:05] thought just dropped so real into my
[45:08] heart I was just speaking about how Mary
[45:11] when the angel of the Lord came to her
[45:13] and spoke those words and she said be it
[45:15] unto me let it I will I receive it I'll
[45:19] do this very thing to you that you're
[45:21] wanting me to do yes did she understand
[45:23] it no could she fully comprehend it no
[45:26] but she said I will
[45:28] and the moment she did that that
[45:30] eternal life that she was to protect and
[45:33] shield
[45:34] think about it a little teenage girl
[45:36] here we are to you a little teenage girl
[45:39] received a word from God and said I will
[45:42] protect this word with all that's within
[45:44] thee
[45:45] and when that word was burnt forth it
[45:49] changed the world forever
[45:51] yeah
[45:54] and the way the thought came to me then
[45:55] was this the as the word is going
[45:58] through even tonight is the word is
[46:00] going forward if you will receive the
[46:02] word of God
[46:03] and allow that word to be birthed in you
[46:05] and you protect and shield the prophet
[46:07] says you protect this message the way
[46:09] that it's going
[46:11] you will receive it and protect it
[46:13] eventually you will give birth to the
[46:17] very word and that word that you
[46:19] protected that God instilled within you
[46:22] that entrusted you and it will change
[46:25] your world
[46:26] somebody that you would have an
[46:28] influence somebody at school
[46:31] you said well I'm homeschooled maybe
[46:32] it'll change your daddy
[46:41] my
[46:44] kids pray for you Mom and Dad
[46:48] pray for your dad
[46:55] Lord first Samuel 17 1
[46:59] says now the Palestines gather together
[47:02] their armies to battle
[47:05] and we're gathered together at shokon
[47:07] which belong us to Judah and pitched
[47:10] between shoka and azika in ephesdament
[47:15] that word sure God means bushy but the
[47:18] thing that captivated me with this verse
[47:20] in particular
[47:21] is this
[47:22] the Philistines had gathered together
[47:24] the enemy had gathered themselves
[47:27] together on land as the Bible says that
[47:30] belonged to Judah
[47:32] what's due to me
[47:35] praise
[47:36] the devil had done camped out on their
[47:39] praise
[47:41] This Is My Land
[47:43] this is my territory this is my
[47:46] opportunity
[47:48] this is the place where I praise the
[47:50] Lord this is my home this is my daughter
[47:53] this is my son
[47:56] you don't have to knock up from the
[47:58] Devil
[47:59] because the enemy the Philistines have
[48:02] come together on the the land of Judah
[48:05] he's coming to approach himself upon
[48:08] your land of praise
[48:10] no doubt they have started out the the
[48:12] the the Felicity said staked out the
[48:14] land beforehand and and and thought this
[48:18] will be a pretty good place
[48:22] um
[48:24] you don't think the devil's not plotting
[48:26] on you
[48:27] [Music]
[48:29] right since he's seen how you've been
[48:30] reading your Bible he's seen the
[48:32] sincerity of your heart
[48:35] [Music]
[48:36] and he's staking you out
[48:38] he's watching you because he's going to
[48:40] try to come in and take your praise he's
[48:43] going to try to come in and take your
[48:44] experience
[48:45] but don't let it
[48:47] [Music]
[48:48] the prophet talked about how the the uh
[48:52] the serpent how he courted Eve
[48:55] he took his time he staked out that land
[48:59] huh
[49:01] and coming on down through chapter one
[49:03] go read it later but again you're
[49:05] familiar with the story we learn of and
[49:07] are made very familiar with Goliath we
[49:10] learn about his stature how big he was
[49:12] and we learn about his position his Rank
[49:14] and he was this Champion oh champion
[49:19] we learn about his posts we learn about
[49:21] his armor but how he was dressed and how
[49:23] he was arrayed and all of these things
[49:25] and we also see how his words cover the
[49:28] valley with depression and anxiety
[49:32] you hear me now
[49:36] depression and anxiety is such a strong
[49:39] Spirit that's attaching itself to the
[49:41] youth today listen
[49:45] it's time you be set free if you're
[49:47] battling with that thing
[49:49] depression anxiety suicide now the the
[49:53] thing is many times you talk about
[49:54] certain things and these are real things
[49:56] that are happening in the land today but
[49:59] as parents sometimes we don't want to
[50:00] talk about because it's uncomfortable
[50:02] you might
[50:04] be setting your child up for Destruction
[50:06] you have those hard conversations listen
[50:09] Mom listen dad you have those who are
[50:11] tough conversations with your job even
[50:13] if you had it last week have it again if
[50:15] you see the new the news there
[50:17] well you take it whatever you want you
[50:20] know
[50:21] [Music]
[50:21] [Applause]
[50:24] but his words covered the valley with
[50:27] depression and anxiety he made his voice
[50:29] verse 11. when Saul and all Israel heard
[50:32] these words of the Philistines Watch
[50:34] what it did they were dismayed and
[50:37] greatly afraid because of the words of
[50:40] the devil
[50:41] made them afraid greatly afraid not just
[50:44] fearful but greatly afraid that we're
[50:48] dismayed means to be shattered be
[50:50] dismayed be broken be abolished be
[50:53] afraid be scared to be terrified how
[50:56] many's been afraid before
[50:57] [Music]
[50:59] praise God we got some saints Among Us
[51:01] that never been afraid of anything
[51:04] I want to rub shoulders with you tonight
[51:06] get a little bit up on me
[51:09] but we're trapped in this thing called
[51:12] time
[51:13] and these sometimes circumstances and
[51:15] things happen that we'd be shaking in
[51:17] our boots but even yet in that time that
[51:21] present time that the circumstances that
[51:23] they're railing around us and the winds
[51:25] are blowing we can stand steady in our
[51:27] faith
[51:29] knowing that our God is more than able
[51:34] because Goliath's message
[51:39] if both depression and anxiety
[51:43] running around saying well I've got like
[51:45] I live in the mess
[51:48] knowing that they're trapped they're on
[51:50] their way to hell
[51:52] hell the devil's pulled one over on them
[51:56] you stay in this word young people you
[52:00] stay in this word young man
[52:02] stay in it you say brother Joel I don't
[52:05] understand it you don't have to
[52:06] understand it be inspired by and say God
[52:09] I I I I I've read and I go to church and
[52:12] I hear the word I don't understand it
[52:13] but I believe it help thou my unbelief
[52:18] give me a grip like Joe had and nothing
[52:21] can shape me even death itself could not
[52:23] shame
[52:26] so he said they weren't just afraid but
[52:28] they were exceedingly afraid and I found
[52:31] that just humanly I understand it I get
[52:34] it but yet at the same time I'm thinking
[52:36] what
[52:38] these are the children of Israel
[52:40] vision of the stone that word Israel
[52:43] means god prevails
[52:46] so every time you see the word Israel
[52:48] and you read it in the Bible God
[52:50] prevails but yet because of the words of
[52:52] the enemy they were shaking in their
[52:54] boots and they didn't know what to do
[52:57] and after all Israel was God's favorite
[52:59] people they were called out they were
[53:01] they were the church natural
[53:04] huh they were the ones who were led by
[53:07] the angel of the Covenant which was
[53:09] Christ
[53:12] we've also been led by the Angels
[53:15] [Music]
[53:16] we received a sure Word of Promise
[53:19] we received the message that has
[53:21] transformed that once again the entire
[53:23] world
[53:25] but yet we found ourselves of Fame and
[53:28] fearful sometimes because why the enemy
[53:31] comes in and makes his boast
[53:36] so here we have
[53:37] these things going on
[53:40] Goliath in this battle
[53:42] and as we know the stories that unfolds
[53:45] on the scene comes Little David
[53:48] and this particular scripture this story
[53:51] rather it was before David before he was
[53:54] known as as we know him now of course
[53:56] all these great things he hadn't yet
[53:58] killed the lion
[54:00] 's standing on the scene but see David
[54:03] was just a teenager
[54:05] [Music]
[54:06] somewhere the historians and things say
[54:08] the the scholars and things say
[54:10] somewhere between the age of 13
[54:12] and some even say 60 that most have it
[54:15] tagged between 13 and 15 but some put
[54:17] him around 16 so that puts him in your
[54:19] category Little David doing this mighty
[54:22] mighty wonderful thing
[54:26] so all of this is going on and David
[54:29] arrives on the on the scene with food
[54:31] for his brothers
[54:33] Prophet says in the message God is
[54:35] commissioning Moses the prophet old
[54:37] Goliath came out and made a great day
[54:42] [Music]
[54:44] that's more really get it okay
[54:48] but it comes out and he makes this great
[54:50] big boss in these he's he's laughing and
[54:52] he said it one too many times
[54:55] he said it one too many times devil it's
[54:59] time for you to shut up
[55:02] under expression not even knowing what
[55:04] he was getting ready to do huh
[55:07] there happened to be a little fellow
[55:09] over there just about so high you know
[55:11] with a little sheepskin coat wrapped
[55:13] around him and he said who's that guy
[55:16] you know probably you know he was coming
[55:17] to bring his brother's food I could just
[55:19] imagine maybe you know he's making this
[55:21] a little strong he don't know what's
[55:22] happened so far and he's just me and
[55:24] David just being a kid you know wow
[55:25] who's that guy
[55:27] and he looks over here and sees his
[55:29] brothers and sisters and all of the the
[55:30] the the hosts of the army rather and
[55:33] they're just shriveling and shaking why
[55:35] isn't that even fearful
[55:37] he hadn't yet got the report but even
[55:39] once he gets the report what does he do
[55:41] he stands firm in his faith
[55:43] because he knew if God can do it once he
[55:46] can do it again
[55:48] [Applause]
[55:50] but he says who's this fellow why they
[55:54] said that's Goliath not he's just got
[55:56] everything stumped around here
[55:58] and David says why do you mean to tell
[56:01] me that you will let that uncircumcised
[56:03] Felicity stand there and Define the
[56:05] armies of the Living God now Mom and Dad
[56:07] you need to tell me you're gonna let
[56:08] that little child of yours
[56:12] that's the spirit on that child
[56:16] is that right
[56:17] that's the spirit on it and you have the
[56:20] authority dance take your position in
[56:23] the home you have the authority if Dad's
[56:25] not there Mom you have Authority to
[56:28] bring that Spirit under control
[56:31] is it going to be easy probably not
[56:34] but you're called to do it
[56:36] God entrusted that little character into
[56:39] your care
[56:40] you remember that little baby that you
[56:42] just love so much
[56:46] you should have taught it something when
[56:48] it was three and four and five
[56:51] I know brother Donald he's mentioned so
[56:53] many times he says you won't raise your
[56:55] kids and then when they get 14 15 16 and
[56:58] they're they're just Wayward and they're
[56:59] just crazy and then you bring them to me
[57:01] and expect me to wave some magic wander
[57:03] and bring them to another Andre bring
[57:05] another wave of the deal bring them to
[57:06] the minister expect them to do something
[57:08] great for tremendous
[57:12] it should have started when they were
[57:14] just wee little bitty face
[57:16] well
[57:22] I want you to come back it's okay
[57:26] you're gonna hear the truth tonight
[57:30] [Applause]
[57:38] that was what David he says no sir
[57:40] Hallelujah there was a lot of fight in
[57:42] that boy nah yes sir he knows what God
[57:45] had promised and you need to tell me
[57:47] that you will let these uncircumcised
[57:49] for listening tell you that the days of
[57:51] Miracles has passed what Jesus Christ is
[57:53] the same yesterday today and forever
[57:56] that's Hebrews 13 8 he either is or he
[58:00] isn't he intermented or he didn't
[58:03] now the thing is you either Believe it
[58:05] or you don't
[58:06] that's the summation of my wrong with
[58:09] the Lord
[58:10] God either meant what he said or he
[58:12] didn't and I had to believe it or I
[58:13] don't know
[58:17] don't care about all this other stuff
[58:19] you're trapped up have that cow eating
[58:21] grass in the top of a tree
[58:23] how the cow get up there you put him up
[58:25] there
[58:26] could you imagine what it would take to
[58:29] get a cowl up in a tree the working
[58:31] effort that it would take you to get a
[58:33] cow in a tree
[58:34] yeah but all that you had to do is
[58:36] believe the Lord
[58:37] how simple is that
[58:39] um
[58:41] and he said oh if some of you guys come
[58:43] out here and fight me this was a lot to
[58:45] say I will make you a proposition now
[58:47] when the devil thinks he has the upper
[58:49] hand he's going to make a lot of
[58:51] proposals
[58:52] but the moment that he realizes that
[58:55] there's power that there's deity in you
[58:58] young sisters young Brothers Listen the
[59:00] moment the devil realizes there's deity
[59:02] in you you are tabernacling them
[59:06] deity is in you and the moment he
[59:08] realizes that he's going to back up
[59:12] the problem Illustrated it wonderfully
[59:14] he said we and I love that of all the
[59:16] quotes in the message the one that I
[59:19] love the most
[59:22] with the comma and the word devil and
[59:24] that's boo
[59:26] think about it he said the Devil comes
[59:30] in making his voice and he says
[59:33] all we have to do is rise up within the
[59:35] strength that's within us and say food
[59:37] back
[59:38] foreign
[59:49] [Music]
[59:54] [Music]
[59:56] let it echo through these walls and
[59:59] across the way
[1:00:01] all the way through Earth and let it
[1:00:03] Echo out boom boom devil because he's
[1:00:05] coming in with such a force
[1:00:08] he's Mighty in the land he's a
[1:00:10] self-proclaimed champion of them all
[1:00:14] but there has to come some little Davids
[1:00:17] the choosing of the stones and I can
[1:00:19] imagine
[1:00:21] stated he heard that post and he heard
[1:00:24] that what the enemy was trying to bring
[1:00:26] now I'm sure he didn't just run down to
[1:00:28] the brick Brook and just well the the
[1:00:30] area there just snatch up some rocks he
[1:00:32] was deliberate and intentional with what
[1:00:35] he chose because why he was inspired
[1:00:39] because anything just won't do the
[1:00:42] problem tells us don't you let anybody
[1:00:44] just cram any kind of Revelations down
[1:00:46] your groove that just pick up any stones
[1:00:50] be intentional be deliberate by what you
[1:00:53] pick up because God's going to use it to
[1:00:56] do something tremendous
[1:00:57] choosing of the souls
[1:01:00] God had a little boy back there with a
[1:01:02] shepherd's coat on who knew God and knew
[1:01:03] God kept his word how many notes God
[1:01:05] keeps his word he promised us that he
[1:01:08] would do these things
[1:01:11] there happened to be somebody there that
[1:01:12] believed God David had that grip I
[1:01:15] believe Bill that had a grip on God just
[1:01:17] just uh uh as as as Joe had
[1:01:22] was covered over with steel all up and
[1:01:25] down like that just one little spot and

[1:01:32] Spirit ready to pick him up and hang him
[1:01:34] up on a tree somewhere here come little
[1:01:36] David just a bouncing in the spirit

[1:04:51] natural roaches he's talking about these
[1:04:53] spiritual little things they are there

[1:05:55] ruptions because you are you're not
[1:05:57] leaving the light on long enough
[1:05:59] you don't let the power go out
[1:06:02] in your source for the lights to come on
[1:06:06] and roaches all around you and they're
[1:06:08] eating your food the food that you pick

[1:06:29] making me feel more I hope I do
[1:06:31] get it out of your life
[1:06:35] turn on the light
[1:06:37] get plugged in
[1:06:39] you go over that switch and nothing
[1:06:41] happened you're not plugged in the
[1:06:43] conduit's plugged up somewhere
[1:06:45] the smoke sack is plugged up somewhere
[1:06:48] let's let's get it cleaned up every time
[1:06:50] I start the principal brother I'm
[1:06:52] telling it send the rock to The Killing
[1:06:54] place I love that and downwind Goliath
[1:06:59] that perpetual motion that around and
[1:07:02] around and around and around it set the
[1:07:05] rock right to the killing Place David
[1:07:09] instruct this thing David didn't figure
[1:07:11] this thing out David didn't have the
[1:07:13] intellect David didn't have the ability
[1:07:15] but he had a God that was on the inside
[1:07:18] of him that inspired him to do something
[1:07:20] that nobody else was willing to do
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:28] maybe Mom and Dad won't do it young
[1:07:31] people you rise up and you do it
[1:07:33] do it you call a family time of prayer
[1:07:37] and I know things are crazy a time has
[1:07:40] been that time is approaching but just
[1:07:42] ain't so busy but you come Mom and Dad
[1:07:44] let's have devotion tonight
[1:07:46] you watch the atmosphere change
[1:07:49] it'll drop conviction in your daddy's
[1:07:51] heart I promise you I promise
[1:07:55] you want to see a change in that you
[1:07:58] want to see a change in mind you call
[1:07:59] the Family altar
[1:08:02] well
[1:08:06] you see the path that Mom and Daddy
[1:08:08] owned you see the destruction that
[1:08:10] they're headed towards
[1:08:11] love them dearly you call Little David
[1:08:15] little Mary you call you say be it unto
[1:08:19] me Lord I'll do it
[1:08:20] under your expression not even having
[1:08:23] the the know-how to do it you do it
[1:08:30] that you're saying
[1:08:33] I promise you
[1:08:36] therefore David ran and stood upon the
[1:08:38] Palestine and took his own sword
[1:08:41] drew it out of the seat thereof and slew
[1:08:43] him he cut off his head there with him
[1:08:46] so the thing with this the choosing of
[1:08:48] the stones and I know I said a lot but
[1:08:51] my thought this inspiration came with
[1:08:53] just the deliberateness that David took
[1:08:56] you can't just run through life you
[1:08:58] can't just have an experience you can't
[1:08:59] just come to church and you know that
[1:09:01] there's there there's more to this
[1:09:03] message than just this message
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:08] there's more to God sending a prophet
[1:09:10] than God sending a prophet
[1:09:13] there's a life that comes behind it many
[1:09:15] people that will come up to Calvary and
[1:09:17] they'll camp out at the base account and
[1:09:19] that's a good place to be don't don't
[1:09:20] misunderstand what I'm saying but
[1:09:21] they'll just come to Calgary and they'll
[1:09:23] go no further
[1:09:25] but there's a life on the other side of
[1:09:28] the country there's something yet to do
[1:09:30] once you've come and let this
[1:09:32] resurrected savior
[1:09:34] yeah
[1:09:37] there's more to do
[1:09:39] 17 51.
[1:09:41] therefore David ran to stood upon the
[1:09:43] Philistine and took his sword and Drew
[1:09:44] it out and just read that
[1:09:46] but the thing is with this one of the
[1:09:48] points I want to bring you is that once
[1:09:50] you kill once you destroy the bigger
[1:09:52] Thing Once you destroy Goliath what
[1:09:54] happens in verse 51 and when the
[1:09:56] Philistines saw their Champion was dead
[1:09:59] what could they do they fled
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:08] so these little things that are
[1:10:10] bothering you you find out what that big
[1:10:12] thing is and you kill it you destroy it
[1:10:16] don't toy around with it don't play
[1:10:19] around with it
[1:10:21] you destroy it
[1:10:23] if you have to unplug your phone if you
[1:10:26] have to get rid of your laptop your
[1:10:28] computer you do that if that thing is
[1:10:30] destroyed leading you to destruction you
[1:10:32] get rid of it
[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:40] Tick Tock keeping you up late at night
[1:10:43] get up and you're irritable in the
[1:10:45] morning you fuss it with your brothers
[1:10:47] and your sisters and your mom and your
[1:10:48] daddy shut it down
[1:10:53] your energy
[1:10:56] at least off on the devastated man y'all
[1:11:00] come with me together
[1:11:03] but you destroyed the bigger things in
[1:11:05] the others of the encampment will flee
[1:11:09] that word for listening
[1:11:11] means an immigrant
[1:11:15] they don't belong here
[1:11:17] they didn't belong in the land in verse
[1:11:19] one which belonged to Judah but they had
[1:11:21] encamped on that land to listings and
[1:11:24] immigrants
[1:11:25] huh so the illegals had gathered
[1:11:29] together on a land that wasn't even
[1:11:31] theirs all in order to wage a war the
[1:11:34] devil's coming into your house and
[1:11:36] saying he's going to start a fight no it
[1:11:39] don't work that way devil
[1:11:42] Mom Dad listen to me it don't work that
[1:11:44] way the devil's gonna come in your house
[1:11:47] ah it don't work that way
[1:11:49] it's all right so the illegals had
[1:11:52] gathered together this was judah's
[1:11:54] territory this was a land of praise and
[1:11:57] worship
[1:11:58] because David was just a little teenager
[1:12:02] now giant Slayers don't have to be old
[1:12:04] so many times we get in our minds as
[1:12:07] young people
[1:12:08] I didn't think well I gotta wait till I
[1:12:11] turn whatever age that magical age 21
[1:12:13] whatever you know we think well I got to
[1:12:15] be old and before God conceives me no
[1:12:17] we've heard clearly we've seen in the
[1:12:20] scriptures God will use teenagers God
[1:12:22] will use and has used and will continue
[1:12:25] to use young people even to the dismay
[1:12:28] of the older ones that are doing nothing
[1:12:30] for him
[1:12:32] thank you
[1:12:35] David was a teenager
[1:12:38] but he took his time when he chose those
[1:12:40] rocks
[1:12:41] he had to make sure that he chose the
[1:12:43] right ones
[1:12:44] he didn't even know listen to this he
[1:12:47] did not even know he was going to kill
[1:12:49] Goliath
[1:12:50] he had no idea
[1:12:52] he just come out there to bring his
[1:12:54] brothers so much that's all he came to
[1:12:57] do
[1:12:57] you just show up at school one day with
[1:12:59] your backpack on your back not knowing
[1:13:02] that you're getting ready to kill her
[1:13:03] Goliath
[1:13:04] that thing is coming you at your locker
[1:13:07] day after day after day and you get more
[1:13:09] depressed and more depressed and you're
[1:13:11] more suicide no more
[1:13:13] more suicide but today will be the day
[1:13:16] that you kill that Goliath
[1:13:19] gang strip gain some inspiration
[1:13:22] yeah
[1:13:24] the people in the halls there at school
[1:13:26] they're not under the same inspiration
[1:13:28] As You Are
[1:13:30] right they're giving the victim and
[1:13:32] smoking and having uh sex and all of
[1:13:34] these things y'all know what's going on
[1:13:36] help me out old people
[1:13:40] sit back and requite about these things
[1:13:43] and our children and our children's
[1:13:45] friends are dying inside
[1:13:48] well it's not how I want to say I don't
[1:13:52] want to offend but you're gonna lose
[1:13:53] your child

[1:15:19] huh this little light that I have I'm

[1:24:02] time I go to church I want to be
[1:24:05] different
[1:24:06] I want to be kind right amen I want to
[1:24:09] be greater amen All of Me Closer
[1:24:14] amen because of the champions of times
[1:24:16] as we go through time
[1:24:18] [Music]
[1:24:21] allow things to things that sometimes
[1:24:24] but those spiritual things that we don't
[1:24:25] understand
[1:24:27] right and that's my desire every time I
[1:24:30] come to the Lord the house
[1:24:35] [Music]
[1:24:38] thank you for your patience
[1:24:42] [Music]
