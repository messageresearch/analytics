[4:20] things have your way now we love you and
[4:22] we thank you in jesus name
[4:25] amen
[4:27] revelations
[4:30] one
[4:31] we've been reading this for
[4:32] quite a while
[4:35] and we've been studying in the book of
[4:36] revelations
[4:38] so let's start off with verse one the
[4:40] revelation of jesus christ
[4:42] which god gave unto him
[4:44] to shew and to his servants things which
[4:46] must shortly come to pass
[4:48] and he said and signified it by his
[4:50] angel and to his servant john
[4:53] who by record of the word of god and the
[4:55] testimony of jesus christ and of all
[4:57] things that he saw
[4:59] blessed is he that readeth and they they
[5:00] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[5:03] those things which are written therein
[5:06] for the time is at hand
[5:09] time to understand i believe don't you
[5:11] but you think the hours here that we
[5:13] should understand the word
[5:15] and we've had in a long time
[5:18] all right revelations 8 1
[5:21] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[5:23] there was silence in heaven
[5:25] about the space
[5:26] of half an hour you may be seated
[5:28] whoever that is blessing to
[5:30] the reading of the word
[5:33] now
[5:34] as i said we've been in the book of
[5:36] revelations now for quite a while and
[5:38] we've gotten over to
[5:40] the 8th chapter
[5:43] and we've been dealing with the opening
[5:45] of the word
[5:46] revealing in chapter 1 where
[5:49] that we can see that
[5:51] john was commissioned to write
[5:54] and send what
[5:55] he saw
[5:57] down to the church ages as we called it
[6:00] or the church is there
[6:01] names them off it was to give the to
[6:03] bring the message to them and then you
[6:07] know then he would get over and and then
[6:09] he would be bring down what would happen
[6:11] in those church ages through chapter two
[6:13] and chapter three
[6:15] and then going over to chapter four
[6:18] then we see an amazing thing because
[6:20] john is
[6:21] taken up
[6:23] all right caught up taken up
[6:26] and he went up into heaven
[6:28] and then as he did he began to tell what
[6:31] he saw
[6:32] he looked around he saw the throne he
[6:34] saw one on the throne he saw the many
[6:35] things saw the elders saw the the
[6:38] calling out
[6:40] and then we went on over to
[6:42] chapter five and bringing it into a
[6:44] great joyous time
[6:46] as to
[6:47] the people that would be there in those
[6:49] things and and then went into chapter
[6:51] six
[6:52] and chapter six starts dealing with the
[6:55] seals
[6:56] and we went through those things and
[6:58] bringing out the symbols from each seal
[7:02] and speaking of those things and then
[7:04] coming down to
[7:05] the end of it all as we reading here of
[7:09] chapter eight
[7:11] when it said when he had opened the
[7:12] seventh seal
[7:14] there were silence in heaven about the
[7:16] space of half an hour
[7:18] you know
[7:20] we can understand we went through it
[7:22] this past few services talking about
[7:26] that
[7:28] the seals were broke by the lamb
[7:31] now the lamb takes the book
[7:33] and releases the seals and and that lamb
[7:36] would be the lamb of god that john
[7:38] pointed out when he was here on earth
[7:40] you know
[7:41] it's no problem to know who the lamb is
[7:43] because the bible tells you he says
[7:45] behold the lamb of god it takes away the
[7:46] sin of the world
[7:48] all right and as he pointed him out then
[7:50] when it comes to hear the lamb is
[7:52] opening the seals
[7:55] and revealing it or showing it would be
[7:58] a better way of saying it
[8:00] unto john
[8:02] there as he's on patmos and remember
[8:04] he's commissioned to write what he sees
[8:08] and send it back down to the the the
[8:11] church ages and then then getting into
[8:14] that then we know that
[8:16] we have to have those things
[8:18] we've been taught you know that
[8:20] back in our older ages and times a man
[8:23] taught a lot of it that
[8:25] uh stay out of the book of revelations
[8:28] well
[8:29] that was probably a pretty good point to
[8:31] a lot of people because they couldn't
[8:32] understand
[8:34] but once the symbols are broken once the
[8:37] the things happens that for us to
[8:39] understand
[8:41] then it's a beautiful marvelous book
[8:44] and it's not trying to figure out things
[8:46] it's trying to just say what it says and
[8:49] and uh you know move on in that
[8:53] but we've gotten up here to the
[8:55] seventh seal and it just says a silence
[8:57] in heaven
[8:59] there's nothing written there
[9:01] to give any understanding
[9:03] so thereby we realized that
[9:06] and and the brother back there i'm sure
[9:08] he knows
[9:09] anything about us he he knows that we
[9:12] believe god sent a prophet
[9:14] all right and we don't make him no more
[9:17] than what the bible makes all of the
[9:19] prophets
[9:20] because we don't worship no man
[9:23] we don't deal with those things he was a
[9:25] human being just like anyone else
[9:27] but he come to bring us the message and
[9:31] in doing that then
[9:32] if there's silence in heaven and nothing
[9:35] is said
[9:37] the then
[9:38] um
[9:39] irregardless of what anyone would
[9:42] believe
[9:43] about us or what we believe in a prophet
[9:45] coming
[9:47] anybody that would read the bible
[9:49] would realize if you come to a silence
[9:51] in heaven
[9:53] and uh you need to know what's going on
[9:57] something calls that silence
[10:00] right
[10:01] right i mean that's just reading that's
[10:03] just taking third grade reading as we'd
[10:05] call it and just reading the book
[10:08] you know and saying well they're silence
[10:10] in heaven
[10:12] well then we realize that there must be
[10:14] something there that
[10:16] that you and i need to know about amen
[10:19] right all right because it's in the book
[10:22] and what are the seven seals
[10:24] what have we been through over and over
[10:26] it's the plan of redemption
[10:29] amen
[10:30] all right those were the things that
[10:32] were uh sealed up
[10:35] as daniel said
[10:36] when it comes to the end of the writings
[10:38] of the of the the meats and persians the
[10:41] different ones in the writings and
[10:42] telling you all about it comes down
[10:44] through there and he comes down to the
[10:46] end
[10:47] and and he's told to seal up right
[10:52] see it was to be sealed up he said until
[10:54] the end time
[10:56] well truly we ought to believe by
[10:57] looking around at the world
[10:59] that we're in the end time that
[11:01] shouldn't be any problems
[11:03] as i said third grade reading and third
[11:05] grade education were to let us know
[11:07] we're in the end of the world
[11:09] we're not setting dates and times in no
[11:11] way did brother brown ever set them
[11:13] you know everybody accused him of it but
[11:16] i'm saying 77 he said don't you say
[11:19] i said 77 when he the rapture he said
[11:21] i'm not saying it
[11:23] it was mankind putting their own
[11:26] interpretation onto what they thought
[11:30] well
[11:31] but see all i want to know is
[11:34] if we need to know these things then how
[11:36] are we to find them out
[11:40] who is to come to do these things
[11:44] and to make known these things and to us
[11:47] because it would require a profit
[11:51] you agree with that
[11:53] if there's silence in heaven and there's
[11:54] nothing there to to go on
[11:58] you know
[11:59] then it would require that god would
[12:01] send a prophet
[12:03] and according to amos like three and
[12:05] seven he said he does nothing until he
[12:07] reveals he said but he revealed his
[12:09] secrets to the prophets
[12:11] all right the prophets were god's
[12:13] mouthpiece
[12:15] they spoke in the
[12:17] in the point of on the earth and that's
[12:19] why those prophets would say thousands
[12:22] of thousands of times throughout the
[12:24] bible they would say thus saith the lord
[12:28] amen all right
[12:29] now what does that mean
[12:32] that means the lord was speaking to the
[12:35] prophet
[12:37] all right well he would say thus sayeth
[12:39] the prophet
[12:40] or thus saith you know
[12:42] jeremiah or something no no
[12:45] it would always thus saith the lord for
[12:48] the lord was speaking through
[12:51] the prophets to bring the word unto you
[12:54] and i
[12:55] but he had to have somebody to write it
[12:57] down
[12:58] that was the way the bible was written
[13:00] all the way through
[13:02] was god speaking to mankind
[13:05] to write the word
[13:06] all right we say well now that's just
[13:08] man's ideas no
[13:11] not when it's thus saith the lord
[13:14] that's not man's ideas
[13:16] man's ideas is what messes
[13:18] up but when we look at it and we see
[13:22] that
[13:23] god has promised us throughout the word
[13:27] in the end of time
[13:30] that things would take place
[13:32] all right then that's why that we
[13:34] believed
[13:35] that god did send a prophet
[13:37] all right if i didn't believe he was
[13:39] sent had sent one i'd be hunting for one
[13:43] there's too much in the word
[13:45] that has to come to the prophet
[13:48] for you and i to be able to understand
[13:50] all right then
[13:52] if it is then let's find him
[13:55] and rally around behind it right you
[13:57] know i mean if it's billy graham or
[14:00] roberts whatever
[14:01] you know let's get behind them and find
[14:03] out who it is
[14:06] you see
[14:07] and in doing all of that we come back to
[14:09] the basis of believing that
[14:12] god sent us a way to understand amen
[14:16] and we're
[14:18] we're to that point of where that we say
[14:20] well the word of god
[14:22] is the truth amen
[14:24] all right
[14:25] see if you can find it in the word
[14:29] then you can
[14:30] lay your life on it
[14:32] because we have to lay our life on it
[14:33] anyway
[14:35] he said well that was just some man
[14:37] well who are you
[14:39] right who spoke to you right
[14:43] you know i mean you got to you got it
[14:44] you know you said oh that's just some
[14:46] man that wrote the bible well who are
[14:48] you
[14:49] where'd you get what you got
[14:53] my bible says
[14:54] that everything we
[14:56] have we received it
[14:59] is that the scripture right
[15:01] everything we have
[15:02] the hour we breathe the clothes we wear
[15:06] that everything should be counted to the
[15:08] basis of knowing that god
[15:11] give it unto us
[15:13] so then we have to let on to that all
[15:15] right we see then
[15:18] when we come to this portion
[15:20] of the scriptures
[15:21] we're truly dependent
[15:24] upon
[15:25] god sending a prophet
[15:27] well
[15:30] so then you've got as i say it want to
[15:32] go you've got the
[15:33] chapter one
[15:36] you've got the beautiful things that are
[15:38] said there in chapter 1
[15:40] about
[15:41] god revealing himself and bringing
[15:44] himself forth
[15:45] unto the ages
[15:47] then you've got the writings of the ages
[15:50] coming down
[15:52] and we believe that we're in the last
[15:53] age
[15:54] for the last age would be the lady of
[15:56] sin
[15:58] and if you don't believe that you need
[16:00] to open your eyes
[16:01] and go out on the world and look around
[16:03] a little bit
[16:04] because according to my understanding of
[16:06] ladies it means
[16:09] people's rights
[16:13] and if that don't fit today we're living
[16:15] in i don't know where it does because
[16:18] everybody wants their rights
[16:20] you know i mean you you get a guy and
[16:23] he breaks into your home and
[16:26] and you're doing the best you can to try
[16:28] to keep them hurting him and
[16:30] you don't even pull a gun on him or
[16:31] something but
[16:32] he falls over the coffee table in the
[16:34] living room
[16:36] the ambulance comes and gets him and
[16:40] you think that's all of it because
[16:42] you know you try to turn him over to the
[16:43] police
[16:45] come find out about a month later you
[16:47] get a bill for all of the money that you
[16:49] owed
[16:51] well in the old days it would have been
[16:53] better to shock the man you know because
[16:56] that wouldn't be right as a christian
[16:57] but
[16:58] at least you got rid of the problem
[17:01] so nowadays it's people's rights not
[17:04] just black
[17:05] or hollering for their rights
[17:08] white green yellow whatever color we are
[17:11] everybody wants their rights
[17:13] right
[17:16] well that's sure to prove in the last
[17:18] days
[17:19] all right
[17:20] but now it says in revelations 3 14
[17:25] that unto the angel of the lady of sin
[17:27] drop
[17:29] these things saith the amen the faithful
[17:31] the true witness etcetera
[17:33] all right so if that was the last angel
[17:37] then our dependence is upon that angel
[17:40] to be of this church age
[17:42] no one would argue any whatsoever or
[17:44] shouldn't in any mentality of form
[17:48] shouldn't argue that the apostle paul
[17:51] was a messenger to the first church age
[17:54] you know
[17:55] and establishing it coming forth and
[17:57] bringing the word
[17:59] and then you wouldn't argue with uh once
[18:02] coming down through there and surely
[18:04] wouldn't argue with
[18:05] luther wesley
[18:07] and all because
[18:09] luther brought the message to the just
[18:11] shall live by faith
[18:14] that was the word of god being restored
[18:17] sure it was a days of reformation
[18:22] but we're promised according to i
[18:24] believe it's ezekiel
[18:27] that we're to be in a day of restoration
[18:29] not reformation
[18:32] within him that said i will restore all
[18:34] things
[18:37] all right then we're in the hour for it
[18:39] to be restored
[18:42] see to do that then we must have a
[18:43] messenger right
[18:47] we must have someone to be able to
[18:50] link it all to
[18:53] and
[18:55] i'm not just preaching this for a
[18:56] brother
[18:58] he may think that you may think that but
[19:00] i don't think that right i'm trying to
[19:02] tell the truth right
[19:05] yeah i don't mind talking plain other
[19:07] people you know beat around you don't
[19:08] know what to do
[19:09] i don't mind being blind and blown about
[19:11] what i'm saying
[19:13] because you see if we don't have our
[19:15] dependence upon
[19:17] god sending us a prophet
[19:21] to be able to understand the things of
[19:23] the word of god
[19:25] where are we
[19:27] is our total dependence placed upon
[19:31] as i say in there the other day whether
[19:33] or not god kept his word
[19:37] you know if he kept his word we don't
[19:38] have to worry about it right
[19:40] i i like to read in the book to find
[19:43] promises
[19:45] don't you
[19:46] because you like to find the promises in
[19:47] the book and then well god you said
[19:49] you'd do that right you said if i'd
[19:52] repent and be baptized in the name of
[19:54] jesus christ remission of sins i
[19:56] received the gift of the holy ghost but
[19:58] you know what i i took in his word
[20:01] now believe that
[20:03] right
[20:05] but you see everything is laying on if
[20:07] there's silence
[20:10] and you don't have anything to go on
[20:13] as we read in that date one
[20:17] the others you have points and
[20:19] illustrations for examples or
[20:22] are peoples or
[20:24] symbols and things
[20:26] to go on you just need to know what
[20:27] those symbols mean
[20:30] but when you come to the
[20:32] seventh seal then it's just silence
[20:37] like we got to depend upon god
[20:41] to give us his word
[20:43] right
[20:43] you know there's another silence in the
[20:45] word of god if you'll turn over to
[20:47] revelations 10
[20:50] we'll go through that scripture
[20:53] but brother would pull out that
[20:54] revelation 10 first because
[20:58] there's a silence there
[21:02] as i said when daniel
[21:04] saw the great coming forth and i love
[21:06] the book of daniel
[21:08] because once you get into it and see
[21:10] what he's doing it's one constant vision
[21:12] over and over it's not many visions
[21:15] that's where you get messed up you try
[21:17] to read him and try to figure out this
[21:19] vision you try to figure out this
[21:20] mission you try to figure out this
[21:22] vision that daniel's bringing if you'll
[21:24] quit that then just read it
[21:26] and just let it connect together
[21:28] and just flow through the book
[21:31] and you can see that he's explaining
[21:35] time and life and things to daniel
[21:38] and that brings it down to a beautiful
[21:40] point in our day
[21:42] but look what it says lindsey as i said
[21:44] in daniel he says seal it up
[21:48] right
[21:49] seal it up
[21:51] all right
[21:54] what i'm just looking at is some points
[22:00] look what he says in revelations 10 1
[22:02] i saw him another mighty angel come down
[22:04] from heaven
[22:06] over the crowd cloud in the rainbow was
[22:07] on his head and his face is where the
[22:09] sun is feeding it's going to fire
[22:12] that's christ
[22:15] now that's not brother branham see we
[22:16] don't believe that a lot of people
[22:18] believe that brother branham was god and
[22:20] all kinds of things but that's their
[22:21] business i don't go along with it here
[22:24] i believe that was that was christ
[22:27] standing
[22:29] the same as he was over in revelations
[22:32] one
[22:32] about verse 13
[22:35] where he stood in the midst of the seven
[22:36] golden candlestick like unto the son of
[22:38] man gerd about to pout for the golden
[22:40] girdle that's the same christ that's the
[22:43] christ that come all the way through the
[22:44] bible
[22:45] that's the one to be to be made known
[22:48] see a mighty angel
[22:50] all right
[22:52] he said he hadn't even had a little book
[22:53] open now you in the seals we've been
[22:55] studying the book has been sealed
[22:59] and the lamb opens the seals
[23:03] all right
[23:05] but you'll find a book in revelation
[23:07] about
[23:08] six there is closed because six one
[23:11] because he had to start breaking the
[23:12] seals
[23:14] here it says the book is open
[23:16] all right
[23:18] and he set his right foot on the sea and
[23:20] the left foot on the earth great big
[23:22] fella isn't it
[23:24] no not when you go back to bible
[23:26] terminologies and
[23:27] realize he's standing on the sea and
[23:29] upon the land
[23:31] and see if people in the land is people
[23:33] and
[23:34] it's still christ that we're talking
[23:35] about
[23:37] and once
[23:40] and this one that was standing there
[23:42] cried with a loud voice
[23:45] that's when a lion roared when he had
[23:47] cried
[23:49] thunders uttered their voices
[23:55] seven thunders uttered their voices
[23:59] this one that was standing on earth
[24:01] isn't what just happened
[24:03] and when the seven thunders that other
[24:05] voices and i was about to write and i
[24:07] heard a voice from heaven saying unto me
[24:09] seal up those things which is seven
[24:11] thunders letters and write them not
[24:17] now you're already over in the 10th
[24:18] chapter that's just spoke to us up above
[24:21] here that the book is open
[24:27] but now
[24:28] there seems to be some secret things
[24:30] that are closed
[24:35] now the bible says
[24:36] the things that are revealed
[24:39] belong to his children
[24:43] but the secret things it says belongs
[24:46] unto god
[24:47] who gave it right all right see anyone
[24:50] have to have some way to get to god to
[24:51] find out what's
[24:52] going on
[24:55] and as we do then we see that
[24:58] when they utter their voices it was john
[25:00] was commissioned to write
[25:02] he was going to write down he heard what
[25:04] happened
[25:08] but he said right or not
[25:11] now what are you going to do
[25:16] silence in heaven
[25:20] and write it not
[25:23] would that tie together and be the same
[25:24] things
[25:29] if you don't write something
[25:32] there's silence
[25:34] john your commission to bring back to
[25:36] the church
[25:38] the word of god
[25:42] now john what do you say
[25:46] he says
[25:49] and the angel which i saw
[25:52] stand upon the sea and upon the
[25:54] earth lifted up his hand to heaven even
[25:57] on earth
[25:59] went up in heaven
[26:03] the silence a moment ago we read in 8 1
[26:05] there the silence was in heaven
[26:12] but when he comes to earth
[26:17] he left him with a hand
[26:21] to heaven
[26:25] could it be the reason silences have
[26:27] tried to get to you
[26:29] there's a reason there's silence in
[26:31] heaven
[26:33] doesn't mean they scott's on earth
[26:44] carnally speaking they'll never be
[26:46] silenced on the earth
[26:48] there'll always somebody to one of us
[26:50] somewhere be running her mouth
[26:52] right
[26:54] but it'll always be sounds and things on
[26:56] earth
[27:01] with those seven thunders he said don't
[27:02] write it
[27:03] sorry
[27:07] john took his pen to right he was fixing
[27:09] to write down what those thunders said
[27:13] you know evidently
[27:16] he said don't write it
[27:20] john what else did you see
[27:23] this one that was standing on the scene
[27:25] on the earth lifted his hand to heaven
[27:28] and swire
[27:29] by him that liveth forever and ever
[27:33] all right
[27:35] we don't establish jesus christ we want
[27:37] to student
[27:40] who created heaven and the things that
[27:42] they're in our in the city earth and the
[27:44] things that they're they're in and the
[27:46] sea and the things which are are in
[27:50] that there should be time
[27:52] no longer
[27:56] it's coming to an
[28:00] end not in heaven on earth
[28:05] that's why i love that little word there
[28:09] john you're commissioned to write to the
[28:10] church
[28:13] and tell the church what you saw
[28:17] now john how are you going to get this
[28:18] back to the church
[28:24] so it strikes john and he enters a
[28:26] understanding he said
[28:28] but in the days of the voice of the
[28:30] seventh angel
[28:33] which would be the messenger to the lady
[28:35] of sin age right
[28:36] thought it would be the seventh angel
[28:45] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[28:47] of god should be finished as he had
[28:49] declared to his servants the prophets
[28:53] which would mean
[28:56] someone is going to have to come whether
[28:58] we're looking for somebody we found
[29:00] somebody or whatever
[29:02] we've got to be dependent upon one thing
[29:05] as i said we got to find out there's a
[29:06] prophet
[29:07] would have to come
[29:10] and in the days of the sounding of that
[29:12] prophet
[29:13] the mysteries would be revealed
[29:16] and he had declared to his servants
[29:19] the prophets plural
[29:24] then say this to one prophet
[29:28] there's a mystery sealed up in the word
[29:30] of god that all of the prophets
[29:33] has pointed at
[29:36] all of the prophets that spoke about it
[29:40] would you agree
[29:42] man
[29:44] and that's what we need to know
[29:48] is what all of those
[29:52] prophets would know
[29:55] and could tell us
[29:58] the bible says that
[30:00] you and i the body of christ
[30:04] as believers
[30:05] right
[30:07] have entered into a position that even
[30:09] the old testament prophets
[30:12] desire to look into you remember that
[30:14] description
[30:15] but there was unable to
[30:19] one because the new birth had not come
[30:22] you know eternal life had not come
[30:25] to be made manifest in a human body
[30:30] the lord jesus christ had that eternal
[30:32] life within him
[30:34] he had to die to release that life to be
[30:36] able for it to come back upon you and i
[30:37] as the new birth baptism of the holy
[30:39] ghost whatever you want to call it
[30:44] and as it comes forth
[30:48] then is the one to teach us all things
[30:51] according to the scripture
[30:54] didn't jesus say that
[30:56] he said if i don't go away
[30:58] the comforter won't come right
[31:02] now putting together all the other
[31:04] scriptures with him what was he saying
[31:06] if the comforter don't come to you and i
[31:09] we have no way of knowing anything right
[31:13] right
[31:15] and jesus said what that said he'll
[31:17] bring this holy ghost will bring to your
[31:19] remembrance
[31:22] whatsoever i've said
[31:25] now once
[31:26] you remember the scripture the rest of
[31:28] it it said even teach you things to come
[31:33] so those disciples he taught them the
[31:36] word
[31:39] when that baptism of the holy ghost came
[31:41] on the death pentecost
[31:44] he took them into a deeper understanding
[31:46] and could tell them things to come right
[31:51] he spoke of his coming
[31:54] right
[31:57] see nobody's supposed to know about it
[32:03] he said when you see these things begin
[32:05] to come to vice
[32:08] you remember he asked them there which
[32:09] in matthew 24 which is the same as
[32:11] revelation 6 1 coming to the seals
[32:15] in matthew 24 they asking three
[32:16] questions
[32:20] when will it be that there won't be one
[32:21] stone on another
[32:24] and want to be the sound of thy coming
[32:28] now the end of the world
[32:32] all right
[32:33] well let me they won't be swung stones
[32:35] that jesus was talking about the temple
[32:37] around right
[32:39] titus in 80 70 came in and totally
[32:42] destroyed jerusalem
[32:44] tore down the walls everything
[32:49] and that's what he describes when he
[32:50] gets over in matthew 24.
[32:54] you hear wars rumors and wars these
[32:56] things read matthew 24 same thing as
[33:00] revelation 6
[33:02] in the opening of the seals
[33:06] all right
[33:07] and what i mean the sign of thy coming
[33:13] the thing that mankind could never
[33:15] understand that jesus would be speaking
[33:17] of in his life
[33:19] was the sign of the son of man
[33:24] even your writers couldn't understand
[33:26] that
[33:28] paul never talked of it
[33:32] peter and him never spoke of it
[33:36] john and him only wrote what would say
[33:38] it
[33:39] you know the writings of the gospels
[33:42] none of them in any other writings
[33:44] spoke of the son of man
[33:49] but he told him he said hey some of you
[33:51] standing here today is going to see me
[33:54] and my company a saying went out among
[33:56] us remember
[33:58] saying went out among the apostles that
[34:00] some of them weren't going to die
[34:02] the bible said how be it he didn't say
[34:04] that that's right he didn't say they
[34:06] wasn't going to die he said they're
[34:08] going to see my coming
[34:13] any bible reader knows then it's really
[34:15] a
[34:16] understanding of the word that you
[34:19] you go to jesus on the mount of
[34:20] transfiguration
[34:24] and you find elijah and moses appearing
[34:28] to jesus on the mount of transfiguration
[34:32] talking to him
[34:36] about his coming
[34:38] because that's what matthew thirst do it
[34:44] well that's exactly the way it's going
[34:46] to be
[34:48] first off elijah was to bring the word
[34:50] to the gentiles
[34:56] but then one day
[34:57] those two witnesses will be standing
[34:59] there which is moses and elijah over in
[35:02] the book of revelation 13
[35:05] and they'll be able to call down fire to
[35:07] be to the gentiles to be to the jews
[35:10] with their jews coming to the jewish
[35:12] race of people but the things that are
[35:14] happening will happen to all of the
[35:15] world
[35:19] that's the sign of his coming
[35:24] the lord jesus christ had the
[35:26] resurrection signed
[35:29] the dead was raised
[35:32] it's the sound of jonah
[35:35] the resurrection
[35:37] the son of is coming
[35:39] he spoke more of his second coming than
[35:41] he did his first coming
[35:43] right
[35:46] he spoke so much of it until
[35:48] two little sisters one day said
[35:51] would you let our children sit where
[35:53] boys you know one said on one side of
[35:55] you and the other said on the other side
[35:57] of you
[35:58] in your kingdom
[36:00] they knew he was talking about something
[36:03] but they couldn't figure it out
[36:07] but the other question was what of the
[36:10] end of the world
[36:11] at the end of the known world will be at
[36:13] the end of the sixth seal as we've
[36:15] covered because it's great earthquakes
[36:17] great happenings
[36:21] the earth will be wiped off and
[36:23] getting ready for a millennial rain not
[36:25] destroyed
[36:27] there's no words in there for destroyed
[36:29] right
[36:30] it'll be wiped off and cleansed to be
[36:32] used
[36:33] because it's still in the regeneration
[36:35] plan
[36:38] noah drop in the days of noah
[36:40] god washed off the earth
[36:44] the days of the lord jesus he dropped
[36:46] his blood upon it to cleanse and claim
[36:48] it
[36:49] one of these days it'll get a fiery
[36:50] baptism yes
[36:52] but not going into the millennial rain
[36:56] millennium rain will be a cleansing
[36:58] getting ready under that sixth seal
[37:02] to understand
[37:05] but you see
[37:07] we're promised in the bible
[37:09] these things will happen let's go to
[37:11] malachi 4 and just see what the promises
[37:13] are
[37:15] that's why i love the word to be able to
[37:17] study the word
[37:20] to remember you the law of moses my
[37:22] servant which i commanded unto you and
[37:23] and these are with the statues and
[37:25] in other words put everything you got on
[37:27] the word
[37:28] is that what he said
[37:31] he's not just reminding them to remember
[37:32] the law to remember this
[37:34] he's telling to put everything they got
[37:36] on the word
[37:38] anything we have must be related to the
[37:40] word of god it can't be related to our
[37:42] ideas
[37:45] then what does he say
[37:47] behold i send you
[37:51] elijah the prophet
[37:53] before the coming of the great and
[37:55] dreadful day of the lord he said well
[37:58] that was john the baptist
[37:59] i would go back and read my scriptures
[38:01] if i'd real careful go to luke 117. and
[38:03] you'll find out that john fulfilled the
[38:06] first half of that
[38:08] right
[38:10] john turned the hearts of those old
[38:12] testament saints to the new testament
[38:14] message
[38:15] that's the lord jesus was bringing right
[38:18] see somebody's got to come in the end
[38:20] time and do the opposite now what right
[38:22] what did they do they turned the hearts
[38:24] of the fathers to the children that's
[38:26] what john donne luke 1 17. and you say
[38:28] well john done all of that well then he
[38:30] turned right back under the law
[38:32] right
[38:34] why because there's another part in the
[38:36] heart of the children to their fathers
[38:37] unless they come and smite the earth
[38:39] with a curse so if john turned him over
[38:40] we believe he did but if he turned him
[38:42] back he put him right back under the law
[38:45] right
[38:46] that won't follow that won't line up
[38:48] with the word
[38:50] see we got to depend upon god to keep
[38:52] his word to bring that
[38:55] prophet unto us in the end time
[39:00] to fulfill his scriptures
[39:03] like luke 17 30
[39:05] as i said a while ago about the son of
[39:06] man
[39:07] so look what it says
[39:10] even though shall it be in the day when
[39:11] the son of man
[39:13] is revealed
[39:16] none of those writers back there
[39:18] find it bring it to me
[39:21] even the great apostle paul
[39:23] none of his writings he speaks of son of
[39:25] man
[39:31] because that would be for the end time
[39:34] that's why luke or their works reading i
[39:38] believe it's in matthew
[39:39] but worse about 13 or 16 were strong
[39:42] about who the man when jesus said who do
[39:43] man say i the son of man i am
[39:46] peter spoke up and said dark the christ
[39:49] that wasn't what jesus was asking he
[39:51] asked him who the christ was
[39:55] john had done declaring to be the christ
[39:58] the scripture is already declaring to be
[40:00] the christ of god
[40:05] but he said who's the son of man
[40:09] peter said lord to christ
[40:11] jesus didn't lambast him and do like we
[40:14] do you know well you don't know what
[40:15] you're doing
[40:17] because he knew he knew part of what was
[40:19] going on
[40:21] so he said
[40:22] peter upon this rock
[40:26] not on peter
[40:28] right
[40:29] i don't know stone laying there not no
[40:32] peter or the catholic church
[40:35] no not even on jesus
[40:39] right
[40:41] but on what did he say
[40:43] upon this rock this revelation i'll
[40:46] build my church and the gates of hell
[40:48] shall not prevail against the boy it's
[40:50] right today
[40:51] took them down to the lowest they have
[40:53] to could beat them in the dark ages but
[40:55] god had a promise i will restore
[41:01] he said he bring it back
[41:07] another word in simple language he was
[41:08] telling peter you don't understand me
[41:11] but you understand enough about the
[41:12] christ
[41:14] you understand enough of what i'm doing
[41:16] you know i've come to bring a church to
[41:18] a place to a new birth i said one day
[41:21] in the end of all things
[41:26] i'll bring to pass then
[41:28] a son of man
[41:30] that's what he couldn't understand
[41:31] brother branham when he began to talk
[41:35] he never declared himself to be big son
[41:36] of man
[41:38] no
[41:40] he said i'm a son of man
[41:43] the son of man is the lord jesus christ
[41:46] that's badness if we'd have thought
[41:48] about it the bible says john the baptist
[41:51] i come from the baptist church really
[41:53] i'm saying
[41:55] but john the baptist meant there's only
[41:56] one
[41:58] so we formed a church behind
[42:01] and thinking it was john the baptist
[42:04] well there was only one baptist and that
[42:05] was john
[42:07] if we took that start we'd do it the
[42:08] better denomination
[42:10] you see
[42:12] all right
[42:14] but it says the son of man
[42:18] the lord jesus christ is the one to be
[42:20] revealed in the end time amen that's
[42:22] right
[42:24] that is the prophet amen amen
[42:28] you with almighty god in human flesh but
[42:31] he was fulfilling the office of a
[42:32] prophet right
[42:34] that's why they could take him and kill
[42:35] that body
[42:39] because all the prophets were destroyed
[42:41] right
[42:42] except moses and you've got enough
[42:44] elijah we got we know the bible
[42:48] but the basics of the prophets were
[42:49] killed
[42:51] all right
[42:54] come on
[42:56] they were destroyed
[42:57] but
[43:00] in the days when the son of man would be
[43:02] revealed or made known
[43:04] wrote out the open word reveal means to
[43:06] to bring into view or
[43:08] or to open you know
[43:10] and to bring those things out
[43:12] all right
[43:14] but the the son of man
[43:18] the son of man means god made flesh
[43:22] among us
[43:24] a simple language which plain language
[43:28] is god might manifest among us
[43:32] let's have a registered with us
[43:36] but now
[43:39] to not move them out of the story we
[43:41] back up to
[43:42] understanding a little bit
[43:45] that we read in revelations 8 1 where
[43:47] there's silence in heaven for about the
[43:49] space of half an hour
[43:53] well something took place or it would
[43:55] not have been silence
[44:00] whatever took place
[44:03] made him stand in the hall
[44:06] right
[44:07] all those angels cherubims the 24 elders
[44:10] the
[44:11] the many different ones
[44:13] stood in all
[44:15] when this event took place
[44:17] where did it take place not in heaven
[44:20] because it stays psychos
[44:24] that was what i was trying to get you to
[44:26] see there sunday that
[44:29] out of those seven seals
[44:33] it's not breaking one two three four and
[44:35] five and six and then the silence
[44:42] if we don't know what that salad seal is
[44:46] it's still solid
[44:48] that's right
[44:52] the seventh seal would reveal what is
[44:54] all of the word and tied together amen
[44:58] be the end of all things
[45:01] because the number seven is completion
[45:05] right
[45:08] god created the world in six days rest
[45:10] in the seventh is completion
[45:14] there is no eight
[45:16] eight is back to a one to put you over
[45:18] into eternity brings you that way
[45:21] well
[45:23] silence
[45:25] in heaven if it doesn't say silence on
[45:26] earth
[45:29] because god sent us a prophet
[45:34] a prophet to reveal the word of god unto
[45:36] us
[45:39] and we believe it to be luke 17 30
[45:41] revelation 10 7.
[45:46] we believe it to be like we read during
[45:48] revelations 10 where
[45:50] there were seven thunders wrote in their
[45:52] voices
[45:55] you know there was a voice in the bible
[45:57] one time that was called a thunder
[46:00] look john 12 and that's really
[46:06] john 12.
[46:10] this is jesus standing on the earth when
[46:11] he was there talking
[46:14] he's bringing down the layout of his
[46:16] life and what he's doing
[46:18] and he says father glorify thy name
[46:22] then there came a voice from heaven
[46:24] saying
[46:25] i have both
[46:26] glorified nor fight it no i'm glorified
[46:29] again and what
[46:31] and the people therefore that stood by
[46:33] and heard it
[46:35] said that it thundered
[46:38] others said an angel spake to him
[46:43] jesus actually said this voice came not
[46:45] because of me
[46:47] but for your sake
[46:49] jesus said
[46:52] glorify me with the glory that i had
[46:53] with me before the foundational world
[46:56] and a voice from heaven speaks out and
[46:58] says
[47:00] i've glorified you and i'll do it again
[47:04] it thundered
[47:07] well you know what a lot of people
[47:08] standing around her
[47:13] but jesus knew what was said right
[47:18] you know what same voice that thundered
[47:20] on mount sinai
[47:26] you told the people don't you touch this
[47:27] mountain
[47:30] because the thunder is the voice of god
[47:37] speaking to us
[47:41] he thundered in a thunder there to the
[47:43] children of israel one time
[47:47] the thunder
[47:49] the voice of god
[47:53] god speaking to you and i is a thunder
[47:56] right amen
[47:58] amen
[47:59] but when it's revealed
[48:03] it's the word of
[48:04] god amen
[48:06] you know that god one day whispered in a
[48:08] man's ear by the name of moses or in his
[48:11] thinking whatever you want to call it
[48:12] inner being
[48:14] and he told him about a lot of times
[48:20] you know that voice speaking into moses
[48:23] moses just turned right around and spoke
[48:24] it right back out
[48:27] just what god said
[48:30] see a prophet who comes the bible says
[48:33] and speaks presumptuously
[48:36] it don't come to vice
[48:39] you're supposed to take him out and kill
[48:40] him
[48:41] that's what the bible says
[48:44] we don't go along with murder but that's
[48:45] what the bible says
[48:48] you know that in the old testament form
[48:50] if a man prophesied alive mama and daddy
[48:53] was supposed to kill him
[48:55] i'm reading bible whether you believe it
[48:56] or not
[49:00] because you're supposed to do away from
[49:01] all of that sin from among you
[49:03] of somebody claiming to be this or
[49:05] claiming to be that
[49:11] but john
[49:12] writing on patmos
[49:15] he was told to seal up those thunders
[49:20] we need to know what to say
[49:26] because that's our only hopes right
[49:30] what is the end of the world what is a
[49:32] rapture to you what is a thoughts of of
[49:35] time or whatever
[49:40] well
[49:41] it just ends
[49:44] no
[49:45] no
[49:47] the bible says the end of all things has
[49:48] come upon us
[49:52] you know the bible says that christ was
[49:54] the end of the law for righteousness
[50:01] you know what that really means
[50:03] if you're not born again you're still
[50:04] under the law
[50:06] amen
[50:08] come on
[50:09] oh no brother to hell now the law ended
[50:11] 2000 years ago
[50:14] it only did to the born-again believer
[50:16] right that's right everybody else is
[50:18] still under the law
[50:20] come on i'm open for discussion
[50:23] make sure you bring the word
[50:27] law is still in existence today
[50:30] unless you're born again
[50:35] christ is the end of that law
[50:38] for righteousness amen to them to
[50:40] believe
[50:43] he said what's god going to judge the
[50:44] world by one day brother dale by the law
[50:52] and there's no grace in law amen
[50:57] there was grace while the law was in
[50:59] existence yes come on but there's no
[51:01] grace in the law the law said thou shalt
[51:03] not
[51:09] but you see church we got to know what
[51:11] those thunders were
[51:15] or else we're not going to get out of
[51:16] here
[51:22] i believe those thunders were exactly
[51:24] what the prophet has taught us
[51:27] but no seals broke
[51:31] it's odd that they seven thunders and
[51:32] their seven seals
[51:35] that's not a mismatched mismatching
[51:38] calculation
[51:39] that's a gospel truth
[51:45] see then when that first seal broke to
[51:47] that prophet
[51:50] god
[51:51] spoke to him what that was
[51:54] he came out and spoke it
[51:57] and told us what those symbols were
[52:00] that was the voice of god
[52:03] that's the way i believe the prophet is
[52:06] he's the voice of god to the age
[52:11] he takes the word of god and speaks and
[52:14] he must compare
[52:17] that's it
[52:19] there's where the people today claim to
[52:20] be prophets can they compare with the
[52:22] rest of the world
[52:28] will it be baptized in the name of the
[52:30] lord jesus christ
[52:32] and what this bible says
[52:35] right
[52:37] no no i'm going to take father son holy
[52:39] ghost
[52:40] then
[52:40] you're the liar
[52:42] the bible don't say that
[52:46] that's a catholic doctrine in the
[52:48] catholic church spoke down your throat
[52:54] almost 2 000 years ago now
[53:00] they were arguing at the nicean council
[53:01] 325 a.d where the jesus was god or a
[53:04] light substance
[53:07] by 606 they had developed the trinity
[53:11] there is no word in the bible of trinity
[53:18] it's not there
[53:23] he's a triune being because he's father
[53:25] son and holy ghost just like you are
[53:26] trial and being but you're only one
[53:28] person
[53:30] you're body spirit soul you're only one
[53:31] person
[53:32] the bible says even the eternal godhead
[53:35] can be understood by the things that we
[53:36] see
[53:38] right
[53:40] christ
[53:42] revealing the word
[53:47] if a prophet speaks
[53:49] not according to this bible he's not a
[53:51] prophet
[53:52] right
[53:54] i don't care what his name is or who he
[53:56] is
[53:57] he's got to be according to this word
[54:00] you deny anything it says in this bible
[54:03] then i don't have to worry about whether
[54:04] you're a prophet or not
[54:07] and the bible even says
[54:10] if a prophet come
[54:12] and give you a sign
[54:15] and that sign comes to pass
[54:20] but he takes you to another god
[54:22] don't believe it that's right
[54:27] that's bible
[54:29] right
[54:30] but do we believe the word of god or we
[54:32] just
[54:33] leave our own ideas
[54:36] and i said to start with we're in lady
[54:38] osea which means people's rights
[54:43] and people say today i've got a right to
[54:45] believe what i want to that's okay by
[54:47] the constitution
[54:49] it gives you that
[54:52] the bible don't give you a right to
[54:53] believe nothing but what it says
[54:57] right
[54:58] we're not talking about a constitution
[55:01] telling us we can believe
[55:05] you're not born again by a constitution
[55:10] you're born again by the word of god
[55:12] amen
[55:15] if that word of god is not revealed to
[55:16] you and i where are we
[55:20] so we got to know what no standards say
[55:23] we know now that it's enough to know
[55:25] that even
[55:26] you would thunder there when jesus was
[55:29] all right
[55:30] the voice from heaven would sound like a
[55:32] thunder
[55:39] in the bible those people heard
[55:42] god speaking right
[55:46] but everybody else around there heard it
[55:47] thunders right right
[55:50] that's why we got to depend upon god
[55:54] so he promised us the way to understand
[55:56] and he did
[55:57] he gave us
[55:59] luke 17 30.
[56:01] the day when the son of man would be
[56:02] revealed
[56:06] he gave us malachi 4.
[56:08] behold i send you elijah the prophet
[56:12] and he'll turn the hearts of the
[56:14] fathers to the children and then the
[56:16] children to the father
[56:20] can you bring it over to revelation 10
[56:22] and sound fourth
[56:24] but in the days of the voice of the
[56:25] seventh angel
[56:27] when he begins to sound do we need to
[56:30] know who that seventh angel is
[56:32] right
[56:36] we need to start searching
[56:38] you see church i don't have to search
[56:40] because i already believe i know who it
[56:41] is
[56:43] but i wouldn't be believing that brother
[56:44] was a prophet if i didn't believe that
[56:49] it was not god
[56:52] no people in this message some of them
[56:54] worship him
[56:56] someone baptized in his name
[57:00] why
[57:01] because god was so prevalent
[57:04] in a man's life
[57:06] martin luther even recorded this what
[57:08] they did about him one time he said it
[57:10] was no problem being able to protest the
[57:12] catholic church
[57:15] he said it was to keep his head above
[57:16] the water of all the things that went
[57:18] with it
[57:20] you know that they thought luther taught
[57:23] for them to go out and you know they did
[57:25] they went out and destroyed churches
[57:28] in the days of luther he didn't teach
[57:30] them that that's right
[57:32] he taught reform
[57:35] he did not want to leave the catholic
[57:36] church i got it on writing he wanted to
[57:39] stay there
[57:43] and reform the church
[57:46] they put luther out he never put them
[57:49] out
[57:49] man
[57:54] men of god down to the bible have always
[57:56] been put out right
[57:57] that's right
[58:01] because it wouldn't people wouldn't
[58:03] follow the word
[58:04] right
[58:08] what about one day they're in the bible
[58:09] and i'll ended up saying this
[58:11] what about in the bible there you think
[58:13] people would be not so dumb and i don't
[58:15] mean that
[58:16] sarcastically i mean truth
[58:20] you remember the story when moses was
[58:22] there
[58:24] and he said all this on god's side come
[58:26] over here
[58:30] and you know what
[58:32] 250 priests
[58:36] preachers okay
[58:37] today
[58:39] 250 priests
[58:42] took hold off the altar which was the
[58:44] very altar that god had ordained for
[58:46] them to use
[58:49] and they're sensors and walked on the
[58:50] other side away from moses
[58:53] amen
[58:59] when they'd already seen moses parked
[59:01] the red sea
[59:02] you know not moses we know that's what
[59:04] god was doing to the man but still he
[59:05] had to use moses right
[59:09] they had seen all the miracles and signs
[59:11] and wonders
[59:13] that accompanied the man's ministry
[59:16] he actually destroyed egypt by his word
[59:20] and yet when they come out to that place
[59:23] 250 of them walked on the other side
[59:25] away from moses well you know what god
[59:27] done
[59:28] he just opened up the earth and
[59:29] swallowed him up
[59:36] do you know what happened the next day
[59:37] read your bible
[59:40] you're ready what happened the next day
[59:44] 250 people closing the ground standing
[59:46] in front of moses and he said see that i
[59:47] told you you can't argue with the word
[59:49] of god
[59:51] the next day
[59:52] read your bible
[59:55] they come to moses and said you
[59:57] destroyed the people of god that's right
[1:00:02] you think grace of god
[1:00:05] if moses would have stepped back and
[1:00:07] said death
[1:00:10] it would have locked out every one of
[1:00:12] them was standing there
[1:00:14] god had done told him before right
[1:00:17] said moses get out of the way i'll
[1:00:19] destroy him
[1:00:22] i'll raise up a nation of you
[1:00:25] moses showing it was christ in moses
[1:00:30] i know i'm putting together two or three
[1:00:31] different stories but i'm trying to get
[1:00:32] a point to you
[1:00:35] moses says god if you destroy them
[1:00:37] people you got to come over me
[1:00:38] right
[1:00:39] that's right
[1:00:42] you know god wouldn't come over moses
[1:00:43] that's right right
[1:00:45] he said go ahead moses take him to the
[1:00:46] promised land
[1:00:48] he said but i'll deal with him
[1:00:51] when it comes time
[1:00:54] he spared the people
[1:00:57] but he dealt with them
[1:01:00] is he church we can't turn down the
[1:01:02] prophets of god that are sent unto us
[1:01:05] we must believe and accept it
[1:01:08] because that's our only hopes of
[1:01:10] understanding god's word
[1:01:12] i know this may sound strange to some of
[1:01:15] me speaking of god sending a prophet in
[1:01:17] the last days but
[1:01:22] what's your hopes
[1:01:25] you think one of these days a bus is
[1:01:26] gonna pull up
[1:01:29] we're gonna all get on the bus and ride
[1:01:30] the glory
[1:01:32] i know that's carnal
[1:01:34] but plain language
[1:01:41] we're facing another time just like noah
[1:01:43] was
[1:01:45] right
[1:01:47] you know what in the days of noah was a
[1:01:49] modern world just like it is now because
[1:01:50] the bible says
[1:01:52] the bible says there's nothing new under
[1:01:54] the sun
[1:01:57] in the days of noah there would have
[1:01:58] been a scientific world looks like it is
[1:02:01] because there's life in it noah they
[1:02:02] said hey you need a boat we'll build you
[1:02:04] one
[1:02:06] he said but god didn't tell me to use
[1:02:07] your
[1:02:08] your stuff
[1:02:11] they were already tempering metal and
[1:02:12] all kind of things they would have made
[1:02:13] him a titanic if he wanted it
[1:02:17] but no he just labored out there for 120
[1:02:19] years making a boat
[1:02:22] but when it floated that was the only
[1:02:23] thing that floated
[1:02:30] the church
[1:02:32] we've had a prophet to be sent to us
[1:02:34] that's right
[1:02:35] but do we believe it
[1:02:38] come on musicians do we believe it
[1:02:41] do we believe that's our only hopes
[1:02:44] of resting
[1:02:47] upon the word
[1:02:51] do we believe that god still
[1:02:53] can speak
[1:02:59] he spoke to me this afternoon and told
[1:03:00] me that i'd have to change my message
[1:03:03] tonight
[1:03:05] company was coming
[1:03:08] i'm generally a person to drive straight
[1:03:10] on when company comes
[1:03:17] and i'll do it
[1:03:19] according to what the leading is
[1:03:22] i had all my notes ready went back and
[1:03:24] tried to redo everything in the world
[1:03:26] got them piled up
[1:03:30] don't worry
[1:03:33] so i hope you get the point of what i'm
[1:03:34] trying to say
[1:03:36] we believe god sent a prophet
[1:03:40] and we believe what he taught yes amen
[1:03:43] believing that then we can put all our
[1:03:45] hopes up on one side
[1:03:46] that that prophet also told us there
[1:03:48] would be a
[1:03:49] variety take a rapture one day
[1:03:52] a change in the moment a twinkling i
[1:03:54] would come
[1:04:06] anybody
[1:04:23] oh
[1:04:26] is
[1:05:06] father in the name of jesus christ
[1:05:25] oh
[1:05:40] is
[1:06:07] is
[1:06:30] he's
[1:06:37] in jesus name
[1:06:56] right
[1:07:52] and when he gets dark
[1:08:15] is
[1:08:28] is
[1:08:45] is
[1:09:02] i
[1:09:47] is
[1:10:07] is
