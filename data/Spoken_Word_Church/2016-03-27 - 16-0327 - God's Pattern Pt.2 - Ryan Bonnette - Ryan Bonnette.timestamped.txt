[0:06] okay already convicted oh we should kiss
[0:10] happy Easter everybody yeah yeah I'm
[0:14] going he started and probably that's all
[0:18] right I have my father voltar thank you
[0:20] for us to get together tonight in your
[0:22] name we thank you for this Easter table
[0:24] that you raised to throw dust education
[0:28] father's thank you for bearing our sins
[0:29] to Calvary thank you for all the many
[0:31] blessings you've done for a given
[0:33] assorted trader bless the center
[0:35] services today over here to draw the
[0:37] diagram of world there's no dimensional
[0:39] density
[0:40] here is the workers for help us in the
[0:42] Sunday School lessons too or just to you
[0:50] so last time y'all remember me talking
[0:53] about space I was an astronaut brother
[0:55] joe said and I'll tell you I hope I
[0:59] don't lose anybody on that I didn't ever
[1:01] really finish so maybe some of y'all
[1:04] didn't see the relevance of that and see
[1:06] how it pertains to the message of the
[1:08] Bible you might have thought I was often
[1:09] left field and maybe I was because I
[1:11] never really got down to the point so
[1:12] what I want to do I have another lesson
[1:14] to teach you if I finish this one but I
[1:17] don't think I'll get to it pretty sure
[1:18] just going to spend the whole class
[1:19] reviewing that last lesson and trying to
[1:22] hit the nail on the head and kind of
[1:24] make it make sense to you so that's what
[1:27] we're going to do today is review this
[1:28] lesson of God's pattern that is
[1:30] something yeah I'm not using the
[1:32] microphone because it's complicated it's
[1:35] hard to stay on there so uh so why did I
[1:40] talked about the cosmos last time well
[1:42] about the space and all those things
[1:44] first off I want to say y'all don't have
[1:46] to see God in space that's something
[1:48] special to me okay I believe that God is
[1:51] big enough that he's everywhere and that
[1:53] you can see God and whatever is special
[1:55] to you brother Danny he hunts and fishes
[1:58] I think right tries to sometimes well he
[2:01] sees God and nature no doubt because
[2:03] that's his thing say I'll see God I can
[2:05] but I don't look for God that much from
[2:07] nature among major man you know and then
[2:09] brother Aaron you see God in mathematics
[2:13] see what I'm saying this we can all see
[2:17] God leads to like speeches you can see
[2:19] go to the beaches and in the oceans and
[2:21] everything that you look around if you
[2:23] got got in you can see God everywhere my
[2:25] thing is space because i'm partial to
[2:27] the cosmos my god made it and i see a
[2:29] lot of things about God in space that's
[2:31] why I was bringing that out and so I
[2:33] hope I don't lose anybody if I did I
[2:34] don't feel too left out you just look
[2:36] for God in your own life where you see
[2:37] them and what's specially so my god is
[2:42] all around it so let me list some of
[2:43] these things here as I said nature
[2:45] oceans to cause most mathematics for the
[2:48] illustration here all back talked about
[2:50] a certain equation or something
[2:52] math class and he said now how can
[2:53] people home see one God because or
[2:56] something like that wasn't right because
[2:58] of this equation say I mean I wonder
[3:00] sing that is older than much science
[3:06] science is merely I know science is
[3:09] wrong a lot of time because it's man
[3:10] okay science is merely mankind observing
[3:13] the world around him and tell him what
[3:15] he sees and he says he looks at
[3:16] something says well why is that that way
[3:18] and then he taken for my hypothesis and
[3:23] then try to prove it see if they can
[3:25] prove why that thing is that way it is
[3:27] or why it appears if it the way it
[3:29] appears to be that's what science is and
[3:31] sometimes they're wrong they thought the
[3:33] world is flat for a time but you know
[3:35] basically that's a part of mankind got
[3:37] put in man ultimately to seek god man is
[3:41] always seeking for something in
[3:42] searching and trying to get greater in
[3:44] advance and all that well that's part of
[3:46] man that God wanted him to use to seek
[3:48] man right so God wants man to find its
[3:52] way back to God you knew that mankind
[3:54] will fall from from God and he defines
[3:56] way back so we're made to see you know
[3:58] don't know other creatures no other
[4:00] creation is seeking and trying to
[4:01] advance and get better you know the
[4:02] animals just keep building nests and
[4:04] keep you know reproducing and eating and
[4:06] sleeping that's all they ever do they
[4:07] don't really advance but mankind's
[4:09] different man is special in my way you
[4:11] see God in history if you look down
[4:13] through history you see God and you know
[4:16] the wars and the formation of this
[4:18] country you know people came over here
[4:19] with the intent of fun in the country
[4:21] that freedom of religion and you know
[4:23] get off from the Catholic Church and so
[4:26] forth and they wanted to be free and God
[4:28] part of that bless them you can see God
[4:31] in a lot of things about history and
[4:33] then you look at human anatomy I don't
[4:35] know anything about it but if you just
[4:37] look at the human body but there's no
[4:38] doubt in my mind if you study enough
[4:39] about human anatomy you'll see God in
[4:41] that you'll see God in the blood the
[4:43] life is in the blood you see God and the
[4:45] way that our bodies are made and
[4:46] everything about us tells us something
[4:48] about God our bodies were made in His
[4:50] image the fact that we're three a body
[4:52] spirit and soul that tell you something
[4:54] Oh God and everything about us about
[4:56] human and acne is something about
[4:58] thought if you look at and study medical
[5:01] science likewise and then relationships
[5:04] I found that you know years ago I was
[5:07] single and I really had longed for a
[5:09] wife because I wanted someone to love I
[5:12] wanted somebody that I could come for
[5:14] somebody that I could make a living for
[5:16] him and do all the things the husband is
[5:18] supposed to do for a while and God bless
[5:20] me with a wife and gaming the ability to
[5:21] fulfill that but it showed me something
[5:23] about God because he had along at one
[5:26] time he was he brought alone with his
[5:27] attributes and he wanted a bride to
[5:30] manifest himself to do careful will
[5:32] provide for and ultimately to expand
[5:34] himself into say i expanded myself i
[5:36] expanded by having a wife that allowed
[5:39] me to manifest attributes of husband and
[5:43] father and all those things and bring my
[5:44] children so those are just a few of the
[5:47] things i was thinking of the that you we
[5:49] can all see something about gaudium you
[5:53] know that story i couldn't find it the
[5:55] brother battle talked about that little
[5:57] boy that when asked his mom do you see
[5:59] god she said well after sunday school
[6:01] teacher he's sunday school teacher said
[6:02] no glass her pastor pastor said no you
[6:05] can't see God and he eventually asked a
[6:07] sailor or something like that wouldn't
[6:08] and that the Fisher hitting that Fisher
[6:10] said all of ever seen is gone everywhere
[6:13] look because official had some of God in
[6:15] him he could see God everywhere surely
[6:16] out in the water out in the ocean and so
[6:18] forth he could see a law about God so
[6:23] ultimately what I say about all this is
[6:25] that God in the beginning Elohim dwell
[6:28] alone with his attributes and he wanted
[6:31] to be manifested he wanted to expand
[6:34] right so the first thing that he had to
[6:39] manifest was God himself as being God
[6:41] because I'm a human being above all else
[6:44] before I'm a father and reform a son and
[6:46] a brother and the husband before all
[6:48] that I'm a human being I spent primary
[6:50] attribute to me God's primary attribute
[6:52] would be God because before he's
[6:54] anything else he's gone so that's why I
[6:56] agree but a brown that God had to make
[6:58] angles first in order to manifest that
[7:01] part of him is being God then he
[7:03] be called God and creator that's how he
[7:05] does know him as angel as a Dodger
[7:07] career right and I don't understand a
[7:10] whole lot about angles but I know that
[7:12] they're not allowed they're not able to
[7:14] see God in the life that we can see him
[7:15] so God wanting a further creation that
[7:18] he can ultimately move himself over into
[7:20] an image you know a creation maybe his
[7:23] own image and to do that he had to make
[7:26] finite man alright because he had to
[7:29] make a man that could fall in order for
[7:32] him to be able to ever have any chance
[7:34] of no God as a savior and as a healer he
[7:36] had to fall in awe didn't make him fall
[7:38] but he put him in a condition where he
[7:39] was finite and he could fall and I don't
[7:42] fully understand all about that but the
[7:43] point in stopping and making for me not
[7:46] make gone being just so anyway so then
[7:49] God is ultimately trying to move over
[7:51] into this finite man so you have an
[7:53] infinite God and find out man so now
[7:57] here's the thing could God have taken
[8:01] that finite man created him and bring
[8:04] him directly into the presence of
[8:05] Almighty God in heaven I don't think he
[8:08] could have because we have a far night
[8:09] man with an infinite God he wouldn't
[8:12] have understood we would have understood
[8:13] anything if we just ultimately were just
[8:15] born riding around with helping as a say
[8:18] as a as Adam was just a fully grown man
[8:20] and just taken right into the realms of
[8:22] God we wouldn't understood anything
[8:23] about God so he had to have a meeting
[8:25] ground and that was earth God chose the
[8:28] planet Earth to meet man on a finite
[8:31] place to meet a finite math and begin
[8:33] little by little to reveal himself to
[8:35] that man so then i would think that
[8:38] maybe that's why God surrounded man with
[8:41] everything that declares somehow declare
[8:45] something about God because the
[8:47] man here and surround him with the
[8:50] cosmos and relationships all those
[8:53] things I just named in nature in the
[8:55] oceans and the mountains and everything
[8:57] around us declares to us something about
[8:58] God so that mankind would open and begin
[9:01] to look around everywhere the man looks
[9:02] seeking for something else ultimately is
[9:04] going to see something about God so he
[9:07] wants man's understanding and man that
[9:09] way is inclined to come to God see so is
[9:15] everybody saying that okay so that's why
[9:19] i would say that God would make this
[9:21] earth and surrounded with things
[9:23] pertaining to God and then one question
[9:28] in my mind has been widened I go so
[9:30] vastly why did he stretch out so far
[9:32] across the kauffman budding just make an
[9:34] earth in the sun in the moon he could
[9:36] have got bottles just those things just
[9:37] to meet men on but like anything that
[9:40] God does I'm sure there's multiple
[9:41] purposes for it but one thing about it
[9:43] here's what I'm getting into is explain
[9:46] to you some of the things that I see
[9:47] about God is that space all the expense
[9:51] of space is so fast because it takes a
[9:53] great deed creation to declare a great
[9:55] big creator and he knew that someday
[9:57] mankind would begin to advance and begin
[10:00] to look out into space in there indeed
[10:02] still see God and I'm get 2 i'll get
[10:05] your scripture later about i'm sure
[10:06] reiterate but about that scripture that
[10:09] where david said if i send into heaven
[10:11] now aren't there i make my bed in hell
[10:13] they're up there everywhere you go
[10:14] there's God and everywhere you look you
[10:16] see something about God and this is one
[10:21] thought that I've had and maybe it's not
[10:22] running but you know the Lord Jesus in
[10:26] the garden I mean in the in the Gospels
[10:28] we see Jesus have been toward an
[10:30] intimate relationship with his disciples
[10:32] he would speak to others in perils but
[10:34] then with his disciples he expounded
[10:35] them the things and the parables he sit
[10:38] down you tell them all these things and
[10:40] have community
[10:40] them well I would think that the Lord in
[10:43] the garden would make it without irony
[10:44] would sit down maybe one day on the rock
[10:46] and say now I'd minus consider this rock
[10:48] and see them being in the middle of this
[10:49] lush garden not out in the desert not
[10:52] outting in the wilderness or somewhere
[10:54] he put him put them in a garden a place
[10:56] full of life and his need to tell him
[10:58] have him sit down to commune then maybe
[11:01] and say look at this consider this rock
[11:02] and they look at the rock and they so
[11:04] yeah what I see yeah it's a firm heavy
[11:07] rock and then he might say something
[11:08] like well this is me this is a
[11:10] manifestation of make this tell you
[11:12] something about Who I am that I'm the
[11:14] rock with your salvation and I'm the
[11:16] which they one who understood that yet I
[11:18] guess but they say something maybe like
[11:20] on the rock of your revelation okay when
[11:23] my word comes in you and I'll reveal it
[11:24] to you it'll be like this from rock and
[11:26] I can be a foundation and I can build a
[11:28] house upon it's perfectly for you and
[11:30] then you might look at the Alliance they
[11:32] now consider that lion and at that time
[11:34] of course there'd be no fear of the line
[11:36] could be reverence but nobody be afraid
[11:37] of line because it wouldn't be such a
[11:39] that wouldn't be a killing creature and
[11:42] the line might come over and they may be
[11:43] pet the line and then he'd say now this
[11:46] line represents me because I'm fierson
[11:48] everybody valves down reference to me
[11:50] and then you might say consider the
[11:52] eagle and consider the tree he said of
[11:53] the river concealer could consider the
[11:55] mountain and the valley and all these
[11:57] things and he could just go on declaring
[11:59] things to Adam and Eve about himself
[12:00] right there in the garden and that's
[12:03] today I believe what he's still trying
[12:05] to do to his bride is trying to expound
[12:06] him himself to the bride so here's what
[12:11] I see about God in the cosmos first of
[12:14] all first of all I thought last time the
[12:16] hell the reason i believe the Big Bang
[12:18] is because it matches jobs pattern
[12:20] because some of the time now spiritually
[12:22] unnaturally God brings saints from a
[12:24] scene on up to full maturity you look at
[12:27] Jacob fountain big burly man came out of
[12:30] a tiny little frail woman you don't even
[12:32] get him to us on his shoulder para rally
[12:34] hear anything man hang up such a small
[12:37] and for the damn however I'm too many
[12:41] ways right anyway so anyway but see
[12:47] something great you can have something
[12:49] so small and you look at that that is
[12:51] part of the reason I believe that they
[12:52] might not just couldn't other Graham
[12:53] talk about he's talked about the atom
[12:55] bursting you know that came all these
[12:57] cause roles and things but but it is
[12:59] Matthew Scott pattern great things
[13:01] coming from a small see this is what
[13:03] they didn't get you last time and this
[13:06] may not even be right this is what
[13:07] science says they said they're all those
[13:09] flat no wrongs that could be wrong about
[13:10] this but get the point the point I'm
[13:11] making that is still true they said in
[13:14] the beginning and that original particle
[13:17] was nothing but infinite energy infinite
[13:20] density and infinite you know all the
[13:22] matter and everything that we see now
[13:23] was containing that purple and then when
[13:25] God said let there be a burst forth and
[13:27] all out of that came all this energy
[13:29] that spread out over the expanse of
[13:31] space in an instant in a moment and then
[13:33] energy converts to matter ok now when
[13:39] that matter came forth from that energy
[13:41] science says that for every billion in
[13:44] one atoms of matter there were a billion
[13:48] atoms of antimatter I'm really fully
[13:50] understand antimatter but I know the two
[13:52] cancel out so when the matter was first
[13:56] coming forth from that energy it was at
[13:58] it was against all odds in any survival
[14:00] but there was only one greater for every
[14:03] billion atoms of antimatter is only one
[14:05] more Adam matter that survived so we're
[14:07] essentially made all the cosmos was made
[14:09] out of leftovers from that original
[14:12] creation well that tells me something
[14:14] about gone too because God always goes
[14:16] against all odds to prove his own self
[14:18] to prove his that it's him working God
[14:21] works against all one can chase 2002
[14:23] chased him down
[14:24] to ten thousand to flight so that always
[14:27] goes install lots a little bit of David
[14:29] to defeat a great big of life because of
[14:31] God given that ability so then sure I
[14:35] can see then how that all this matter
[14:37] could be opposed by antimatter and you
[14:41] have that law of opposition you know God
[14:43] has a what I all caught a lot of
[14:44] opposition I don't know what else to
[14:45] call it the basically the nice one
[14:47] declares today and artists you know what
[14:49] declares like is what makes the light
[14:51] know if there was no darkness we
[14:52] wouldn't know like if there was no sin
[14:54] who wouldn't know a savior and if
[14:57] there's no signature with no healing a
[14:59] healer so God has these laws of
[15:02] opposition and it just works all around
[15:04] us and then
[15:10] I out of that original creative act also
[15:15] came all the forces of nature there's
[15:18] four fundamental forces of nature
[15:19] there's gravity electromagnetism and
[15:21] nuclear strong force of nuclear weak
[15:23] force and those things came out of that
[15:25] and science says they all had to be
[15:27] exactly right if there was just a little
[15:29] bit two months of gravity was just a
[15:30] little bit too strong everything will
[15:32] fall into black holes if gravity is too
[15:33] weak nothing would ever for me I'll just
[15:35] keep going into space so it had to be
[15:37] exactly right and that tells you there
[15:39] had to be a mind a divine creator behind
[15:42] that to get everything that's exactly
[15:44] right it didn't just happen science says
[15:45] what we're lucky they got the grab that
[15:47] the big bangs aren't right the big bang
[15:49] in getting right you're starting it had
[15:53] to be perfect and not to mention
[15:55] everybody anybody ever heard of the
[15:57] Goldilocks zone like that's what it's
[15:59] called the earth is just the right
[16:02] distance from the Sun if it was any
[16:03] closer it'd be too hot to sustain life
[16:05] is any further be too cold just insane
[16:07] like we have to be just exactly right as
[16:10] we're floating around the Sun through
[16:11] space and you go throughout the whole
[16:13] galaxies throughout the whole universe
[16:15] you can barely find any planets there in
[16:18] just the right spot to their son that
[16:20] are just close enough to sustain life
[16:22] but he put this one this exactly so and
[16:24] even put the moon in exactly the right
[16:25] spot for the ocean you know to govern
[16:29] the ocean contains to keep the time
[16:30] where it's supposed to be and all the
[16:32] other things so many things I think that
[16:34] planting and I think growing no volley
[16:36] life I think depends somehow on the
[16:38] gravitational pull the Sun so many
[16:39] things rely only mean over the moon so
[16:42] many things rely on the moon being an
[16:44] exactly its location again it shows God
[16:47] had to be there and then about those
[16:51] laws of physics and the laws of those
[16:55] fundamental forces
[16:57] of nature you know Newton we called
[17:00] Newton's laws of motion they're not
[17:01] Newton's laws that he was accredited
[17:03] with discovering them but God created
[17:05] them and personally though the time and
[17:08] this may still be right I don't know
[17:09] ever got it wrong now but there was a
[17:11] time when I thought the job was
[17:12] literally stay on their space this great
[17:14] big man of God and just world in things
[17:16] off his hands just thrown out stars
[17:18] throwing out planets though nothing why
[17:20] would he have to do that wouldn't that
[17:21] make him sort of fun I wouldn't be
[17:24] better to say that he just spoke it and
[17:26] didn't sit back and fold his arms you
[17:28] know and watch it but he was all up all
[17:30] up in it involved in it but yet I
[17:31] believe he spoke it and out of that
[17:34] speaking came laws of gravity knows
[17:37] other ones I named those forces and
[17:39] those forces of what drew the things
[17:40] together because out of that energy came
[17:43] subatomic particles and those formed
[17:45] into atoms because of nuclear strong
[17:47] force of nuclear weak force those formed
[17:49] into molecules and then gravity started
[17:51] pull things together for gases gases are
[17:53] or what stars are made of and then when
[17:57] stars formed and lived and died and
[17:59] cyber stars those chemical processes of
[18:01] fusion and things that make other
[18:02] elements the other elements that didn't
[18:04] come out of the Big Bang and that looks
[18:07] like iron and things that our earth is
[18:08] made out of came out of that so God
[18:10] brought through processes when I'm bang
[18:11] after another another adult mint leaves
[18:13] just his lols i believe the laws because
[18:14] God governs things by laws all
[18:16] throughout the universe its laws of God
[18:18] spiritually and naturally and then these
[18:21] laws are what literally brought things
[18:22] together to bring all the pieces in the
[18:24] right place and God knew each and every
[18:27] atom where would go and where am I know
[18:29] which ones would make the earth and
[18:31] opening them which ones would make our
[18:32] bodies because he knew that we're
[18:34] fearfully made and rock and the lowest
[18:36] parts of the earth of all says he knew
[18:38] exactly where those that were that our
[18:39] bodies would come from that bring us out
[18:41] of the earth that makes sense okay come
[18:46] up anybody sleep all right nothing about
[18:49] the universe is that it's always in
[18:50] motion it's always everything moving
[18:53] nothing is static nothing is stagnated
[18:55] in space everything is either sinning
[18:57] orbiting or moving in some way just like
[19:01] aw he's always moving always advancing
[19:02] forward god never sit still he never
[19:04] stagnates he's always advancing he
[19:06] not changing but he's unfolding is
[19:08] continually unfolding himself becoming
[19:10] greater by our perspective because we're
[19:13] receiving revelation he's not actually
[19:15] changing it all unfolding become greater
[19:18] to us because we're seeing or more other
[19:20] so universe always in motion so it's
[19:22] called the universe they say is
[19:23] expanding I don't understand that but
[19:25] they say the since the Big Bang it
[19:27] started expanding its never stopped
[19:28] everything moving away from everything
[19:30] else I don't know if that's true but I
[19:32] know that God is always expanding he's
[19:34] been ever since he came out of this L
[19:36] him nobody could understand anything
[19:38] about he condescended them to logos and
[19:41] then from there started to create and
[19:44] what is low cost I've been thinking
[19:45] about recently to me it seems like low
[19:47] cost a good way to describe low cost is
[19:50] that it's just a word description of
[19:52] what God hence it's God in letter form
[19:54] its words that God made to describe
[19:57] something about what he is to say that
[19:59] this is what I am he put that in letter
[20:01] form and gave it to us and actually
[20:03] created a thing called language where we
[20:05] can communicate back and forth with one
[20:07] another transmitting a thought from my
[20:09] mind of yours of things that I've
[20:11] thought about then i'm using words
[20:14] language to communicate that to you God
[20:16] does the same thing to us he
[20:17] communicated to us to do the work
[20:19] through the Bible we read it and then
[20:21] God comes to giving inspiration and
[20:22] quick sense to us that's God's life to
[20:24] make us but that's what becomes sent
[20:26] about God I believe and so garden is
[20:29] Fanning that's what he's been doing okay
[20:40] everybody see that pretty good hey psalm
[20:44] 139 to the chief musician of some one
[20:47] day the lord thou has searched me and
[20:49] know me they'll notice my down sitting
[20:51] in mind uprising I understand this my
[20:53] thought afar off now passes my path and
[20:56] my lying down and are acquainted with
[21:00] all my ways for there is not a word in
[21:02] my tongue but local Lord now notice it
[21:05] all together thou has to set me behind
[21:09] him before and lay thy hand upon me such
[21:13] knowledge is to work for me it is hot I
[21:15] cannot attain unto it whether shall I go
[21:18] for my spirit whether shall I flee from
[21:20] that presence if I send up into heaven
[21:22] they weren't there if I make my bed in
[21:25] hell the whole they're out there and I
[21:26] don't believe David actually come please
[21:28] comment actually going to hell I believe
[21:29] you might be pulling up a bit of a sea
[21:31] by me because of committing adultery but
[21:33] even if you turn your back on Lord fog
[21:35] away from the Lord yet there still
[21:36] remain in your thoughts and you'll feel
[21:37] a conviction come on it and you'll come
[21:39] back to the Lord but he's everywhere we
[21:42] go we can't get away from the presence
[21:43] of the lord if I take the lens of the
[21:46] morning and dwell in the uttermost parts
[21:49] of the sea even there shall i hand leave
[21:51] me and I right hand shall holding I
[21:53] looked up teasing the Greek much can the
[21:55] best I can tell about the wings of the
[21:58] morning would be like of course the
[22:00] morning is the dawn and in the dawn in
[22:01] the morning if you're looking out East
[22:02] wing's means edge of something so you'll
[22:06] see where the light is scattering the
[22:07] darkness that makes kind of a line there
[22:09] and if you were to take that I think
[22:10] David say and ride that over to say go
[22:13] if you're looking at your if the west
[22:14] coast and looking out over the ocean or
[22:16] something right over a body of water you
[22:17] derive that out there and that most
[22:19] parts of the sea then God would still be
[22:22] with you anywhere you go in the world
[22:24] are in the cosmos anywhere you look you
[22:26] see God if I say surely the darkness
[22:28] shall cover me even the night shall be
[22:31] like about me the darkest hot if not
[22:34] from thee but the nite chef is the day
[22:36] the darkness the darkness and the light
[22:39] are both alike to thee for thou hast
[22:43] possessed my range that has covered me
[22:45] in my mother's womb I will praise thee
[22:48] Brian fearfully and wonderfully made
[22:50] marvelous are thy works and that my soul
[22:52] knoweth right well my substance was not
[22:55] hid from thee when I was made in secret
[22:58] and curiously wrought in the lowest
[23:00] parts of the earth as I said what would
[23:01] go into every atom they kind of that big
[23:03] bang every item in the beginning of
[23:05] creation wherever wound up it and where
[23:07] it would be to make up our natural
[23:09] bodies you know makeup us that thine
[23:12] eyes did see my substance yet being
[23:15] imperfect and then the book all my
[23:17] members were written which in
[23:19] containments were fashioned when it's
[23:21] just it was none of them how precious
[23:25] are also are the thoughts and me oh god
[23:27] how great is the son of them if I should
[23:29] count them they are more in number than
[23:30] the sand when I wake I'm still with thee
[23:34] surely that will slay the wicked old dog
[23:37] depart for me therefore you've let him
[23:39] in where they speaking directly and our
[23:42] enemies will take my name in vain all
[23:48] right that's all that didn't want to
[23:50] read ok John 11 in the beginning was the
[23:54] word and the Word was with God and the
[23:56] Word was God the same was in the
[23:58] beginning winter coming all things were
[24:00] made by him and without him was not
[24:02] anything made that was made he made all
[24:05] things he made it for his glory God
[24:07] doesn't waste any effort i don't believe
[24:08] God does anything in vain everything he
[24:11] does has a purpose you know and no word
[24:13] will return to Him voice phone says his
[24:15] word will accomplish what sent to
[24:16] accomplish so if we made everything in
[24:18] His image made anything for a purpose
[24:19] then it would be all you know like I
[24:21] said a while ago somehow to declare
[24:23] something about him the creation
[24:25] declares the Creator and it's to bring
[24:27] us back to him Ronan's 124 the invisible
[24:32] things of him from the creation of the
[24:34] world are clearly seen being understood
[24:36] by the things that are made even his
[24:39] eternal power and Godhead so that there
[24:41] were that excuse because when they knew
[24:43] not when they knew God they glorified
[24:44] him not as God neither we're thankful of
[24:47] invading their imaginations and their
[24:48] foolish heart was darkened but the
[24:50] invisible thing through that again of
[24:52] him from the creation of the world are
[24:54] clearly seen being understood by the
[24:57] things
[24:57] that are made the things that are made
[24:59] declare even his power is eternal power
[25:02] and Godhead say so everywhere we look
[25:05] even carnal you know senators look
[25:07] around everywhere they look they see God
[25:09] but I mean I realize they're looking at
[25:11] all but they're looking at a creation of
[25:13] God that declares Scott Rawlins 1136
[25:17] love him and through him and to him are
[25:19] all things to whom be glory forever amen
[25:22] and Hebrews let him free through faith
[25:25] we understand that the worlds were
[25:27] framed by the Word of God so that things
[25:29] which are seen were not made of things
[25:32] which to appear God literally brought
[25:34] something from nothing because he's
[25:37] creator all right let's see all right
[25:45] and you'll remember me talking about
[25:46] this image last time this is a
[25:48] computer-generated image of what the Big
[25:49] Bang might have looked like basically
[25:51] very bright very brilliant very fast and
[25:53] very hot very violent woman and tongue
[25:57] when the matter-energy was releasing
[26:00] payment space right he is wise in heart
[26:03] and mighty in strength a dope 94 who has
[26:07] hardened himself against him and hath
[26:08] prospered which remove it the mountains
[26:11] and they know not which overturn them
[26:13] and his anger was shaking the earth I've
[26:15] replaced and the pillars there of
[26:17] criminals which commanded the Sun and
[26:19] advise if not and silloth of the stars
[26:23] which along spread it out the heavens
[26:25] and treadeth upon the waves of the sea
[26:26] which make it Arcturus Orion and
[26:30] Pleiades which are constellations and
[26:33] the chambers of the south of the finger
[26:34] also some grouping of constellations
[26:38] which do is great things past finding
[26:41] out yeah and motors without number
[26:47] all the depth of the riches both of the
[26:49] wisdom and knowledge of God how
[26:51] unsearchable are his judgments and his
[26:53] ways past finding out this is one last
[26:55] comment about this lesson mankind cannot
[26:58] find the end of the universe this is
[27:00] just one picture taken from the hubble
[27:02] space telescope in space just as far as
[27:05] you can see there are stars galaxies
[27:08] things that God is made mankind cannot
[27:11] find the end of the universe what does
[27:13] it tell you about God all this time
[27:14] through all time then kind has been
[27:15] searching try to find out God find out
[27:18] something about him and see if they
[27:20] could find the end of the matter you
[27:21] know and is every time something's
[27:24] reveal to you more comes out of it every
[27:26] time you see something like you think
[27:27] well that's all there is to see about
[27:28] that scripture well then here comes more
[27:29] than unfolds God is just endless and
[27:32] there's no interim just like the
[27:34] creation you make I don't know if there
[27:35] isn't in the universe I kind of doubt
[27:37] about it some are another I guess the
[27:38] finite creation would I don't know I
[27:40] mean honestly but mankind can find it
[27:42] that's the point we cannot search and
[27:43] find the end of God most of the universe
[27:46] is still not understood and it's
[27:47] therefore a mystery just like God as
[27:49] much as we've studied about God we still
[27:53] can't find a min to God we still can't
[27:54] understand all the rest understand about
[27:55] God I leave something for eternity shal
[27:58] cuz we're getting enough heaven here we
[28:00] go to heaven on we're getting off of God
[28:01] to go be with God and and that will see
[28:05] the Eternity them that through the
[28:06] universe ages of attorney will be
[28:07] receiving a message of cheer and God
[28:09] continues to unfold himself through
[28:11] eternity because he's a great big guard
[28:12] full of mystery anybody any questions
[28:17] about that one I just wanted to say
[28:19] something about that last picture you
[28:21] had that
[28:22] amazing and he doesn't do anything for
[28:24] you he's right so somewhere we learned
[28:27] that they all have those strong any
[28:32] other question I can start on this next
[28:35] lesson wake up a few more minutes if
[28:36] that's all right I won't finish it I
[28:39] know that but I standardization to go
[28:42] hard
[29:03] okay this is a lesson about believing
[29:06] like they don't get very far but least I
[29:08] get to the the main point right up front
[29:11] maybe you'll see what I've been thinking
[29:12] about here lately you know we kind of
[29:16] overlooked believing we're kind of over
[29:17] overestimate it or underestimated I mean
[29:20] I think it's just some minor something
[29:21] but it really is a great big thing in
[29:24] the Christian walk and recently I got to
[29:26] thinking about it was something that
[29:28] I've never seen before ism you know I'll
[29:33] get them to the scripture in a little
[29:34] while but jesus said I go away the
[29:36] comforter may come and when the
[29:37] comforter is come he will need you and
[29:39] guide your own truth I always stop that
[29:41] man when I came into the message and and
[29:44] came onto the truth too much more likely
[29:46] what I've seen in Baptist Church I said
[29:47] well this is wonderful and I thought I
[29:49] thought well I can't go wrong now you
[29:51] know I can't believe wrong now I'm in
[29:53] the message i'm under this head shipping
[29:55] brother Dale on shelter and I can't
[29:57] believe false doctrine but that's not so
[29:59] I believe the false finebros so close to
[30:02] the truth on that it will deceive the
[30:03] elective console and I believe that
[30:04] possibly we could walk into false
[30:06] talking for time and begin to see it but
[30:09] God is obligated he'll bring us back
[30:10] he'll go back after his lost sheep but
[30:13] he'll lead us to the truth what he said
[30:14] he did not say he'll make you believe
[30:16] the truth he said my spirit I'll lead
[30:18] you and guide you in all truth and it
[30:20] still makes you believe it you can
[30:21] present it to you all through time has
[30:24] been presented to mankind life and death
[30:26] ever since the garner Dean was life and
[30:27] death blessing and cursing good and evil
[30:29] right and wrong has only been set before
[30:31] us and we choose so that's where the
[30:33] believing comes in you get to choose
[30:35] what to believe and you have to find you
[30:37] have to search out the spirituals with
[30:39] every doctrine every spirit that comes
[30:41] to you and find it in the Bible and see
[30:44] how it pairs up and if you find one
[30:46] thing falls it doesn't have to be ten
[30:48] scripture to disprove it just won't work
[30:50] against it means it's false you remember
[30:53] how careful our pastor is that he talks
[30:55] all he talks all the time about that one
[30:57] time when he found something that that
[31:00] something told him about this idea or
[31:03] dolphin or something that he came up
[31:04] with you that something said that if you
[31:06] do that you make your type crediting
[31:08] ant attack so he was serious about he
[31:11] crumbled up burned it threw it away I
[31:12] mean everything told sister Peggy about
[31:14] whatever it was because he didn't wanted
[31:15] to see me they don't believe in somebody
[31:16] he didn't want to spread a false
[31:18] doctrine that's how serious it was about
[31:20] it and that makes me to realize that we
[31:21] often do very careful about what we
[31:23] choose to believe because the are
[31:25] believing is in the womb of our mind and
[31:28] when you are receiving a false doctrine
[31:31] in the womb of your mind you're
[31:33] identifying with it you're making
[31:35] yourself one with that post offering and
[31:38] it's actually I believe it's the spirit
[31:39] of adultery but you know I believe God
[31:41] can wink at your ignorance if you do it
[31:43] no not knowing any better if you do it
[31:44] thinking that it's in the Bible because
[31:46] every false doctrine has some basis in
[31:48] the Bible you can find some scripture
[31:50] and quote to prove almost I mean every
[31:52] false doctrine I guess so it looks good
[31:54] for a while but when you keep going and
[31:56] consider the end of the matter you find
[31:59] out that there's something false with it
[32:00] and are you going to hold on for the
[32:02] false doctor because it's a feel-good
[32:03] doctrine or because there's a lust demon
[32:05] associated with it or are you going to
[32:06] cast it now because truthfully the false
[32:09] doctrines seem so much more appealing
[32:11] than the true you know there's no beauty
[32:13] that we should desire you as I have said
[32:15] and you know the truth is pretty
[32:17] straight and hard and you know John 8
[32:19] that book and it became bitter in him
[32:21] because he had to go and live it
[32:22] afterward the truth is bitter something
[32:25] done because it separates us from family
[32:26] separates us from loved ones it's really
[32:28] hard and sometimes it's this not to be
[32:31] desired you know I mean we want we would
[32:33] rather just go a bit easier just to play
[32:34] the false talking sometimes and just
[32:36] settle for them but we have to stick to
[32:38] the straight and narrow way and believe
[32:40] the truth against all against all
[32:42] adversity so and the Bible talks many
[32:46] many times about believeth on going you
[32:50] don't just believe one comma then you're
[32:52] set for your whole Christian journey
[32:54] every day you when you have a false
[32:56] doctrine or some false idea that comes
[32:58] in your mind or some ministry presents
[33:00] something on the tape or whatever you
[33:01] have to try that spirit see with me of
[33:03] God because if it's false and you buy
[33:07] into that you you're identifying with it
[33:09] and I believe it will can't go ring you
[33:11] will cause a lot of problems until you
[33:13] get rid of okay so that's an ongoing
[33:15] it's believable you have to continue to
[33:17] leave the truth and continue to cast
[33:20] down the false and I use this analogy
[33:23] and that probably about all I have
[33:26] timelines so a woman when a man
[33:32] approaches a woman with the intent of
[33:34] consummation then the woman has to do
[33:36] one thing chance to discern is that my
[33:38] husband because legally she can only
[33:40] take her husband so is that my husband
[33:43] well with the problem is sadness that he
[33:45] comes in unaware she comes in appearing
[33:47] as an angel of light the minister of
[33:49] life revelation he comes before us it
[33:52] looks like our husband Christ and so we
[33:54] might be tempted or we are tempted very
[33:56] much so to take that because it looks
[33:57] real it looks right and you're trying to
[33:59] do the right thing you want to believe
[34:00] the truth so then the woman has to be
[34:03] very careful because she don't take her
[34:04] husband but if she take some other word
[34:06] see what she's doing is accepting
[34:07] another man see that's not her husband
[34:10] so then if we accept false stopping in
[34:12] the womb of our mind and I said it won't
[34:15] bring light that will bring death of
[34:16] certainly plus 1 is can see brings sin
[34:19] sin when it's finished or unbelief when
[34:21] it brings death okay the end state of
[34:23] these false talkers is always dead
[34:25] spiritually so it will separate us from
[34:27] God so then so then when we accept it
[34:32] anything except with it right or wrong
[34:34] what we're doing is actually believing
[34:36] whether it be true or false so the state
[34:40] i guess that's going to be all
[34:43] yeah let's go MIA from day I'll try
[34:45] again in this lesson next time and thank
[34:46] you all your questions
