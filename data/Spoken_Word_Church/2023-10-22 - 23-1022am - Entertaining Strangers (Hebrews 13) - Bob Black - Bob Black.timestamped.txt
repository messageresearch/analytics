[0:05] God bless you Saints good to be in the
[0:07] house of the
[0:09] Lord and I just want to say I thoroughly
[0:12] enjoy brother Michael's Sunday school
[0:13] lesson he's he's downstairs but he he'll
[0:16] listen later and hear this um I
[0:19] certainly want to just encourage him to
[0:20] keep pressing on um cuz that was
[0:23] wonderful and uh we've been listening in
[0:26] to the services at the camp and if you
[0:28] haven't I I encourage you to do that as
[0:30] well you can find those online and I I
[0:32] we've sure enjoyed um listening to
[0:34] brother Andrew Glover and and Josh
[0:36] Bennett and
[0:38] uh uh bring bring the
[0:41] word let's see is
[0:43] [Music]
[0:47] this there we
[0:49] go all right let's go to the Lord in
[0:51] prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be
[0:53] able to gather together around your word
[0:55] this morning we just ask Lord that as we
[0:56] study these things out that you open
[0:58] them up to us Lord God and bless the
[0:59] services today Lord be with brother Wade
[1:02] as he's preparing to bring us the word
[1:03] today Lord Jesus and open up our hearts
[1:05] and our minds Lord to receive what you
[1:07] have in store for us today that you'll
[1:08] give us encouragement and strength we
[1:10] ask in your name
[1:12] amen now we're going through Hebrews
[1:14] chapter 13 and we're um getting towards
[1:16] entertaining strangers which is um a
[1:19] really interesting thing to study out
[1:21] and but before we get let's just kind of
[1:23] uh as as we kind of move on into that um
[1:26] verse three or four there let's back up
[1:29] a little bit and keep talking about
[1:30] Brotherly Love here cuz Paul says of
[1:32] course how we've been studying Paul is
[1:34] really the only one that that kind of
[1:35] strung those two words together
[1:37] brotherly and love and the way that he
[1:39] did nobody else really really mentions
[1:42] uh uses those two words Brotherly Love
[1:44] in the New Testament and Paul's saying
[1:47] let Brotherly Love continue be not
[1:49] forgetful to entertain strangers for
[1:51] thereby some have entertained angels
[1:55] unawares and if you really look at that
[1:57] that word brotherly love it means um uh
[2:01] it's it's the the original Greek is
[2:04] Philadelphia which means love of
[2:06] brothers or sisters the love which
[2:10] Christians cherish for each other as
[2:12] Brethren and so the love um you know
[2:15] when you just when you love somebody
[2:17] regardless of what their background is
[2:18] where they come from or what they've
[2:20] done to you or all of those things but
[2:22] you love them anyway now I've got over
[2:24] on the side here a picture of the just
[2:25] to illustrate that brother b or Jesus
[2:28] told the story of the good Samaran
[2:30] which really if you break that down that
[2:32] the you got the the the Levi and the
[2:34] priest walking away you think well the
[2:36] minister should the maybe sometimes the
[2:38] ones that you really expect would you
[2:40] know like in this story would would
[2:44] would help the Israelite that's falling
[2:46] down you're looking and and and maybe
[2:48] sometimes the ones that you would expect
[2:50] are walking away and Here Comes This
[2:52] Good Samaritan one uh a hybrid that
[2:55] everybody has looked down on that uh a
[2:58] mixed mixed race you know everybody is
[2:59] like what they they even put them in
[3:02] like a special area where nobody would
[3:04] fellowship with them the Samaritans
[3:06] nobody wanted to go over there that's
[3:07] why when Jesus went to to Samaria the
[3:09] the disciples were like where are we
[3:11] going to Samaria we're the Israelites
[3:13] don't go to Samaria but that is the
[3:16] example that Jesus used as somebody that
[3:19] was really showing kindness to somebody
[3:21] else the love of somebody um regardless
[3:24] of what the situation is and you know
[3:26] love is uh if you really start breaking
[3:28] it down
[3:30] it's almost something that um you know
[3:33] you look at it as kind of a strange
[3:35] thing like maybe the disciples looked
[3:36] over at John who kind of example of Love
[3:40] leaning his head on Jesus's breast and
[3:43] they would look at him and like that's
[3:45] that's that's different that's different
[3:47] for him to be leaning his head over on
[3:49] Jesus's breath and even you think about
[3:51] that scene when when Jesus and Peter and
[3:54] John were walking on the on the on the
[3:56] seashore and and Peter says what about
[3:59] this guy guy over here he's a little bit
[4:00] different and and Jesus says what is it
[4:03] to you what happens to him what is it to
[4:06] you if he terries till I come love is is
[4:09] a little bit it's a little bit different
[4:11] you think about supernatural love on
[4:13] display to respond in kindness no matter
[4:17] what the devil can throw no matter what
[4:19] people say it's got to be something
[4:21] Supernatural let's let's we what what
[4:23] John said in in 1 John chapter 4 he said
[4:26] beloved and I've got this picture of
[4:28] thorns being tossed at somebody that's
[4:31] watering them anyway that's what a maybe
[4:34] just consider this picture Thorns being
[4:36] thrown at you but you're just going to
[4:38] return kindness anyway look what John
[4:40] here says and and I know it's a little
[4:42] bit small to read but let's just just
[4:44] kind of meditate on these words as I
[4:45] read
[4:46] them beloved let us love one another for
[4:50] love is of
[4:53] God and everyone that loveth is born of
[4:57] God and knoweth God now now brother
[4:59] brand what he said God was originally a
[5:01] fountain of love his his attribute he
[5:04] was love and he said within himself with
[5:07] all these other attributes so when he
[5:09] was manifested the attribute of love in
[5:12] Earth the very attribute of Love of uh
[5:16] the very expression of love was
[5:17] manifested here in Earth you were part
[5:19] of that so when you are expressed that
[5:22] makes you also part of that expression
[5:24] of love that's what really John is
[5:26] trying to explain brother B expounded
[5:28] more on that but he said as we keep
[5:30] reading in verse 8 he said he that
[5:32] loveth not knoweth not God for God is
[5:35] love and this was manifested the love of
[5:38] God toward us because that God sent his
[5:40] only begotten son into the world that we
[5:42] might live through him here in his love
[5:45] not that we love God but that he loved
[5:47] us and sent his son to be the
[5:49] propitiation for our sins beloved if God
[5:53] so loved us we ought also to love one
[5:56] another what's he saying if God loved us
[5:59] when we we were unlovable when we were
[6:01] in a predicament where we could we just
[6:04] um like I heard I heard uh somebody
[6:07] saying in a video I watched recently
[6:10] that a lot of these people that you read
[6:11] about in the Bible are people that you
[6:14] would not want to go you would not even
[6:15] want to fellowship with you would not
[6:17] want to sit down and eat at a table at
[6:19] the table with somebody who sold his go
[6:22] gave his wife away Abraham or like all
[6:25] these sto David what did you do you
[6:27] betrayed your your friend and you you uh
[6:30] you stole his wife and all these all
[6:32] these things where you look at it and
[6:34] these people how could you how could you
[6:37] love somebody that committed these
[6:39] horrible things but yet God loved us
[6:42] anyway you look at your own life how
[6:44] could God love me but yet God loved me
[6:46] anyway and that's the kind of love that
[6:48] we should Express to one another when we
[6:50] when it looks like we're unlovable I I I
[6:54] even heard uh I'm I know we don't like
[6:57] to I this is something that that James
[6:59] Dobson said years ago he said when you
[7:02] should love your kids is when they're
[7:04] the most unlovable that's when you
[7:06] really should love your kids is when
[7:08] they when they really you know get on
[7:10] your nerves and do things that you oh
[7:12] goodness that's when you pour out the
[7:14] love and really show him love beloved if
[7:18] God so loved us we ought also to love
[7:20] one another no man ha seen God at any
[7:22] time if we love one
[7:25] another if you want to see God love one
[7:27] another if we love one another God
[7:30] dwelleth in us and his love is perfected
[7:33] in us now you think about love when when
[7:37] somebody does something like maybe just
[7:38] think about it in a like a marital
[7:40] situation your wife does something that
[7:42] really GRS on your nerves or vice versa
[7:44] but yet there's something that trumps
[7:47] all of that it it's something greater
[7:49] than that your your kids do something
[7:52] that really upset you maybe somebody in
[7:54] the church does something that you don't
[7:55] like but there's something greater than
[7:58] that that covers it over that's why the
[8:00] Bible says hatred stirreth up stries but
[8:05] love covers all sins love covers it all
[8:10] that's why you know maybe maybe your
[8:12] your husband will uh leave the shoes in
[8:14] a place that trips you up or won't clean
[8:16] up after himself or maybe you know you
[8:18] don't you forget to take the trash out
[8:20] or things things of life that aggravate
[8:23] but love love is there and love covers
[8:25] it all and see I've got this little
[8:27] image of the the scale of things being
[8:30] balanced out all the different
[8:32] animosities and things of life things
[8:34] that just aggravate but love balances
[8:37] the scale out and love is what covers it
[8:39] all over love that's why we got to have
[8:42] Brotherly Love Brotherly Love is the
[8:44] thing that can draw somebody back to
[8:47] Christ when you show them love when you
[8:49] show when you really show somebody that
[8:51] you care about them and that the
[8:54] expression of God's love is shown
[8:56] through your life that is God on the
[8:59] display now I've got uh my my next slide
[9:03] is a little picture of somebody showing
[9:04] love to to a dark cloud of you know cuz
[9:08] a lot of lot of times in life people you
[9:10] know they got complexes and all these
[9:12] kind of things that cause them to react
[9:14] in different ways and and you know you
[9:16] can get in this cycle that's what that's
[9:18] what brother Andrew was preaching on how
[9:20] how the older generation maybe they got
[9:22] complexes and things built up and
[9:24] they'll start treating the the younger
[9:25] generation parents a lot of times will
[9:27] do that they'll have complexes and
[9:29] they'll start piling it on the Next
[9:30] Generation and then it becomes a cycle
[9:33] you you got to get out of that cycle how
[9:35] you going to get out of that cycle is by
[9:36] love say I'm I'm I'm not going to
[9:39] perpetuate this thing I'm going to
[9:40] return love you can and and see that's
[9:43] why love it looks kind of strange looks
[9:46] like you'd say maybe well it's just some
[9:48] kind of sissified thing no no real Godly
[9:51] love on display am go Love Will Conquer
[9:55] everything love can change the
[9:57] atmosphere let let's let's get real for
[10:00] a second uh if you got like maybe a
[10:03] menopause a wife she's getting real
[10:06] upset she get real upset you come in and
[10:09] you say something hurtful back to her
[10:11] and and it'll just cause the situation
[10:12] to spiral out of control but if you
[10:15] react in love tell her how much you love
[10:17] her tell her how much you appreciate her
[10:19] it'll change everything love will change
[10:23] the whole thing think about that story
[10:24] brother R told where the the woman's
[10:26] drunk husband was coming home from
[10:28] partying with her friends and she just
[10:30] sitting there washing the floor saying
[10:32] must Jesus bear bear the cross alone and
[10:35] she maybe had a right to get up and yell
[10:37] and screaming at his face and tell him
[10:39] you ain't what kind of a role model are
[10:40] you and all this kind of stuff but love
[10:43] is what won him to
[10:44] Christ let Brotherly Love
[10:49] continue now we're growing up into love
[10:52] and I got you know we kind of talked
[10:53] about the stature of perfect man briefly
[10:55] let's just read this real quick I got
[10:56] the uh we're we're growing up one adding
[10:59] one thing on the other of patience and
[11:01] Temperance and all these things to where
[11:03] we come to a place where we can really
[11:05] treat somebody with love and kindness
[11:08] despite how they treat us in first pet
[11:12] second Peter chapter 1 verse4 he said
[11:15] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[11:17] great and precious promises we got some
[11:19] promises promise a promise here laying
[11:21] in the Bible that we can behave just
[11:24] like
[11:26] Jesus that by these you might be
[11:28] protected ERS of the divine nature that
[11:31] you can have the same character of God
[11:33] expressed in your life having escaped
[11:36] the corruption that is in the world
[11:37] through lust and beside this giving all
[11:39] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[11:42] to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[11:44] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[11:46] and to patience godliness and to
[11:48] Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[11:50] brotherly kindness charity now what
[11:52] what's happening as you as you grow you
[11:53] begin to recognize that if God if God
[11:56] brought you through these things he's
[11:57] able to bring somebody else so you can
[11:59] have patience with them I I think real
[12:01] bloodly kindness is not you get do away
[12:03] with all that judging and where you're
[12:05] saying well look at look at you you
[12:07] ain't as good as I am and and all the
[12:09] judge pointing fingers and everything
[12:11] but you bear with one another knowing
[12:13] that if God brought you he's able to
[12:15] bring somebody else patience to know
[12:17] that God's working and he's doing it and
[12:19] if there's a problem in somebody's life
[12:21] they they can look in the beer of God's
[12:23] word and God will expose it to them God
[12:26] will reveal it but in our interactions
[12:28] with One Another Love covers so we can
[12:31] deal with one another even through all
[12:33] of our our little our our little
[12:34] problems of life and the things that
[12:36] little bumps in the road we deal with
[12:38] one another because Peter said well look
[12:40] what he says for if these things be in
[12:42] you and abound they make you that ye
[12:44] shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful
[12:47] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[12:49] Christ now you think about how now as we
[12:52] go into the next verse the next
[12:53] scripture that Paul's saying how can I
[12:56] get these things a lot of times we'll
[12:58] think well
[12:59] I I messed up I I I goofed up I I've got
[13:01] a problem maybe I don't have patience
[13:03] the way I thought I should and we'll
[13:05] back up and say well I got to work on
[13:07] myself now think about that I got to
[13:09] work on myself is that right am I
[13:13] working on
[13:15] myself or is God the one doing it that's
[13:17] why brother Ram said that it's automatic
[13:20] this is not a self-help program when I
[13:21] go back and I try to I try to the Bible
[13:25] says that you cannot add one hair one
[13:27] you cannot add one little bit of stature
[13:30] by taking thought of it so when somebody
[13:33] points out a flaw and says you need to
[13:34] go work on yourself that's is that
[13:38] scriptural how what how as we go into
[13:40] the next verse Paul is trying to get us
[13:43] to say we need to understand that what's
[13:46] happening as you as you eat the word you
[13:49] become the word it's an automatic
[13:52] process you you're becoming it as so oh
[13:55] we we we must always have a positive
[13:58] conf confession that God is working on
[14:01] us and we're going somewhere and he's
[14:02] he's building a faith in us and like
[14:05] like he would say from that Faith within
[14:07] us is growing from a little Mustard Seed
[14:08] Faith to a marble Faith growing growing
[14:11] till this Mountainside Faith something
[14:12] is happening as we're eating the word
[14:15] don't ever have a negative confession
[14:17] and get so down and say well I I'm I'm
[14:20] nothing's happening you just keep eating
[14:22] the word and keep marching on and keep
[14:23] going now look
[14:25] look let me let me skip over that I'm
[14:28] we're talking about preaching of the
[14:30] Gospel in Ephesians 4:11 because Hebrews
[14:33] chapter 13:2 says be not forgetful to
[14:36] entertain strangers for thereby some
[14:39] have entertained angels
[14:41] unawares now if we go back the The
[14:43] Strangers we're talking about the
[14:45] preaching of the Gospel that is how we
[14:48] grow that's what Ephesians 4:11 says he
[14:51] gave some Apostles and some prophets and
[14:53] some evangelists and some pastors and
[14:55] teachers for the perfecting of the
[14:57] Saints for the work of the Ministry for
[14:59] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[15:01] we all come in the unity of the faith
[15:04] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[15:05] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[15:08] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[15:10] now I've got a picture of somebody
[15:11] preaching I I think this is a scripture
[15:13] that we should all have memorized that
[15:15] we should all have just laying on our
[15:17] tongue ready to go that this is how
[15:20] we're going to grow through the
[15:22] preaching of the Gospel the word that we
[15:23] hear that's why Paul is saying be not
[15:26] forgetful to entertain strangers for
[15:28] thereby some have entertained angels
[15:30] unawares now as we as we really study
[15:33] this out think about what this is saying
[15:34] like strangers in the Bible Abraham
[15:37] sitting there and here comes three
[15:38] strangers walking up and what he did was
[15:41] he didn't say well uh y'all need to
[15:43] y'all need to go down the road to the
[15:45] 7-Eleven and find you some food some way
[15:48] somehow no he pulled all the stops out
[15:51] and he entertained everything that they
[15:52] were there to he of course we know we
[15:54] know the story he knew uh had a
[15:56] revelation of one God he knew who it was
[15:58] was he he he he wasn't confused about
[16:00] who was walking up but he he was ready
[16:03] to entertain the word for that day he
[16:06] knew he was coming he he he was ready to
[16:09] entertain and then the two angels they
[16:11] went down to
[16:15] uh they went down to Sodom and what did
[16:18] lot do he entertained The Strangers that
[16:21] were coming with a message and Genesis
[16:23] 19 it says There came two angels to
[16:25] Sodom and Evan and and and lot sat in
[16:28] the gate of Sodom and lot seeing them
[16:29] rose up to meet them and he bowed
[16:31] himself with his face towards the ground
[16:33] and he said behold now my lords turn in
[16:35] I pray you into your servant's house and
[16:38] tear all night and wash your feet and
[16:42] you shall rise up early and go on your
[16:44] ways and they said nay but we will abide
[16:46] in the street all night and he pressed
[16:48] upon them greatly he's ready to
[16:50] entertain them and they turned in unto
[16:53] him and entered into his house and he
[16:55] made them a feast and did bake
[16:57] unleavened bread
[16:59] and they did
[17:05] eat and as as the eagle stirreth brother
[17:07] Brown preach this he he's having a
[17:09] prayer line and this lady comes up and
[17:10] he says here come here lady and I put
[17:13] this in here just so we can kind of
[17:14] really meditate on the scripture what it
[17:17] saying he said you and I are strangers
[17:19] to one another you think God can tell me
[17:22] what your trouble is would it help you
[17:25] so now he's a stranger to her and she's
[17:27] a stranger to him and he's an angel a
[17:29] messenger a messenger with a message to
[17:32] her you think God can tell me what your
[17:34] trouble is would it help you would it
[17:36] help you all if God said something now
[17:38] to this woman it's your ear you believe
[17:42] that God will make it well you're scared
[17:45] it's a Cancer and it's in your left ear
[17:48] is that right well it was but it isn't
[17:53] now now and see how we're we're getting
[17:56] into what brother R's definition of
[17:57] entertaining strength ERS that somebody
[17:59] that you don't know but yet you
[18:01] recognize that they've got a message
[18:02] from God and you listen to it and you
[18:05] heed it and you're willing to pull out
[18:06] all the stops to get to get what they're
[18:10] bringing because Jesus said in Mark
[18:13] chapter n whosoever shall receive one of
[18:16] such children might be a stranger to you
[18:19] but if you receive them in my name they
[18:21] you receive Christ and whosoever shall
[18:24] receive me receiveth not me but him that
[18:26] sent me it Mark chapter n he said and
[18:29] said unto them whosoever shall receive
[18:31] this child in my name receiveth me and
[18:34] whosoever shall receive me receiveth him
[18:37] that sent me for he that is least among
[18:39] you all the same shall be great brother
[18:43] Brown preached and when their eyes were
[18:44] open he said as they went along he said
[18:46] to them why are you so sad talking about
[18:48] on the road to EMAs I wonder if he'd say
[18:50] the same thing to this little gathering
[18:52] here tonight why are you so sad what
[18:54] makes you so weary why they said are you
[18:56] just a stranger they didn't know him and
[19:00] you don't know who that is sitting right
[19:02] next to you tonight the Bible said we
[19:05] have entertained angels unaware God now
[19:09] here's where he really clenches it what
[19:11] it is God H sending his Spirit to an
[19:14] individual and that individual is a
[19:16] mouthpiece when you receive that
[19:19] individual you don't receive him but you
[19:21] receive him that sent him Jesus said
[19:24] when you receive me you receive not me
[19:26] but you receive my father that sent me
[19:28] you get it we laugh at a preacher
[19:31] sometime a good gospel preacher because
[19:35] he disagrees with our
[19:37] theology we make fun of him sometime and
[19:40] even call him that scandalous name of
[19:42] Holy Roller fanatic you don't know you
[19:45] might be talking about God when you do
[19:47] that for the Bible said in so much as
[19:50] you have done under the least of these
[19:52] little ones that believe in me you have
[19:54] done it unto me and these signs shall
[19:57] follow them that believe not all that
[19:59] say they believe but these signs shall
[20:00] follow them that leave and again he said
[20:03] in the message
[20:04] influence he said we notice today that
[20:07] because that people are have no
[20:09] reverence they'll come to church people
[20:11] will come to church and cut up and laugh
[20:15] and talk don't forget we're talking
[20:16] about entertaining strangers
[20:18] entertaining the word when it's brought
[20:19] to you and laugh and talk make fun
[20:22] sitting where the gospel is being
[20:24] preached no reverence at all and meet
[20:26] you on the street you don't expect any
[20:28] respects of people we mustn't do that
[20:30] but yet it shows Christian dignity to at
[20:32] least honor the people say good morning
[20:34] brother or whatever you wish some of
[20:36] them holler hello preach oh that's so
[20:39] common remember Jesus said as you do
[20:42] unto these you do it unto me he that
[20:45] receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
[20:48] and he that receiveth him that I've sent
[20:50] receives him see as you do to them you
[20:53] have did it unto me and the irreverence
[20:56] you know what it is they are not
[20:58] conscience of the presence of God the
[21:00] world has become so common and religion
[21:03] has become such a
[21:05] lowb until there is no respects just as
[21:09] it's always
[21:10] been and then from that time I'm just
[21:13] I'm just reading a few quotes this
[21:15] afternoon or this morning he said so he
[21:16] was only 30 or two 30 or 32 years old
[21:20] and a young beautiful woman come up one
[21:21] day to the well where he was sitting
[21:23] tired and he said to her woman bring me
[21:25] a drink and she said it's not customary
[21:28] for you to ask me such things as that I
[21:30] am Samaritan you're a Jew segregation he
[21:34] said but if you knew who you were
[21:35] talking to what was that woman doing she
[21:38] was meeting God she met a man but it
[21:41] wasn't a man that she was meeting it was
[21:43] God in the man she was meeting God let
[21:46] that soak in the scripture said you've
[21:49] entertained angels not knowing what you
[21:51] were doing unaware of it same as Abraham
[21:55] entertained angels and immediately after
[21:57] the angel left and had performed a
[21:58] miracle before him he called the man God
[22:02] Elohim the almighty God sitting there
[22:04] eating steak sandwiches drinking milk
[22:06] from the cow eating cakes and he was
[22:09] almighty God the little woman little did
[22:13] she know look what had done for Abraham
[22:15] then it changed him and Sarah from an
[22:18] old woman old man and an old woman of a
[22:20] hundred years old back to a young man
[22:22] and woman that brought forth Isaac they
[22:26] met God that's what done the difference
[22:29] now you you see what he's saying there
[22:31] entertaining strangers is what will
[22:33] change your
[22:34] body entertaining strangers is what
[22:37] changed Abraham and Sarah because they
[22:39] they didn't recognize who that was
[22:41] coming up to them but when you when they
[22:42] believe the word it was coming forth it
[22:45] it just like that little that little
[22:46] sister that was coming up there on the
[22:48] prayer line and brother ad said we're
[22:50] strangers but she listened and she
[22:52] believed him and it brought healing in
[22:54] her body that's right that's that's why
[22:56] we need to entertain strangers now look
[22:59] what Paul is saying let Brotherly Love
[23:01] continue love one another despite all
[23:04] the problems of life just love one
[23:07] another let Brotherly Love continue let
[23:10] it keep going don't let it just be a
[23:12] one-time thing but love love love be not
[23:16] forgetful to entertain strangers cuz
[23:19] that's what's going to change us for
[23:21] thereby some have entertained angels
[23:23] unaware what a messenger somebody
[23:25] bringing you something from God to help
[23:27] you remember them that are in bonds as
[23:29] bound with them enter into one another's
[23:31] afflictions when somebody's sick and
[23:33] laying in the hospital now now we might
[23:35] not see one another's efforts as we pray
[23:38] in our prayer closet and those kind of
[23:40] things but when oh when you're praying
[23:41] and reaching out to God really enter
[23:43] into the situation and them which suffer
[23:46] adversities as being yourselves also in
[23:49] the
[23:50] body and then Paul says marriage is
[23:54] Honorable than all and the bed undefiled
[23:57] but but wh mongers and adulterers God
[23:59] will judge and well this might be a good
[24:02] place to stop and don't get worried I'm
[24:05] not going to linger overly on this
[24:06] scripture but Paul is definitely taking
[24:09] a stand against uh IM immorality in
[24:13] Galatians 519 he said now the works of
[24:15] the flesh are manifested which are these
[24:17] adultery fornication uncleanness naous
[24:20] and in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 he said
[24:22] know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[24:25] not inherit the kingdom of God be not
[24:28] deceived neither fornicators nor
[24:30] idolators nor adulterers nor feminite
[24:32] nor abusers of themselves and he gives
[24:33] his list because we know Paul loved list
[24:36] he loved making lists in verse 11 he
[24:38] said such were some of you in other
[24:40] words the gospel is going to change you
[24:42] you're not going to stay in that same
[24:43] situation because like brother BR said
[24:45] adulterers adulterers go to hell there's
[24:48] a consequence for immorality God wants
[24:50] to take your life and change you and
[24:52] make you different and not leave you in
[24:54] that condition that's why he said such
[24:55] were some of you that that might might
[24:57] be a past condition but when the gospel
[24:59] gets a hold of your life it'll change
[25:01] you but ye are washed but ye are
[25:04] Sanctified but you are justified in the
[25:06] name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[25:09] of our God John MacArthur I was just
[25:12] finding some quotes about immorality he
[25:13] said this is a nation so far down in the
[25:16] sewer of immorality and wickedness that
[25:19] nothing surprises
[25:21] me but you let the gospel get a hold of
[25:23] somebody and they won't be like that
[25:25] anymore regardless Billy Graham said
[25:27] regardless of what society says we can't
[25:29] go on much longer in the sea of
[25:31] immorality without judgment coming
[25:34] that's what Paul's getting at here in
[25:35] marriage is Honorable in all and the bed
[25:38] undefiled but whoremongers and
[25:39] adulterers God will judge so while we'll
[25:42] end on this next scripture from First
[25:43] Corinthians flee run away from that
[25:46] thing flee from sexual immorality the
[25:49] Bible the King James version says
[25:50] fornication every other sin a person
[25:52] commits is outside the body but the
[25:54] sexually immoral person sins against his
[25:56] own body and we'll stop there on that
[25:59] weighty scripture God bless you
[26:05] [Applause]
[26:26] Saints
[26:56] for
[27:09] [Music]
