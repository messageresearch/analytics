hallelujah got all that singing it was real good Michael doing good thank you just keep it up keep it up keep practic and it'll all work right amen do you enjoy this morning viewing the things and seeing well we're going to get right into it this afternoon and go right on through remember now the bible study this coming Saturday and remember that most of the people will be gone for the weekend and over in Alabama and we hope that Alabama don't sink because of everybody leaving but you know we're glad they're have going to go have a a good time and then we're going we are not going to have our communion foot washing on the 1 we'll have it on the second Sunday okay that'll take care of that so remember these announcements make sure you watch the thing downstairs to tell about the the time for the Easter meeting on the 18th that we'll be having and then we'll be having the well gathering together for Easter time all right and then we'll be having the Gathering Together on the 4th of July which will be on a Saturday and we'll be starting about 2:00 in the afternoon and then about 5:00 we'll be eating together probably hot dogs hamburgers or something CU everybody for the 4th and then we'll have our Bible study we are hoping to have a special guest you know for the weekend so we're still working on it so we'll we'll try to do all right but just remember that all right everybody happy and what you're seeing on the thing and what I was going to do if you want to if the church would like we will try to send some money over to the Philippines for them to build that church all right they said about $3,000 should be able to take care of it we're going to try to do that and we also maybe might be increasing a little of our offering going to the Foreign Fields with maybe especially that sister there we we started out sending her what $300 $200 a month 200 and we dropped it down to 100 I think we can afford to go back up to the 200 Mark and help them out you know and all and we we appreciate them doing if you've been there you seeing a little bit but remember pictures don't tell it like it is when you're seeing the things when I was there they didn't have that bathroom you were talking about saw this morning okay they had an outdoor Johnny house sitting on the hillside that was about you know they're little so it was about this High okay so you know the problems I had all right but that was all they had for the whole Community but we'll just do that we'll send that and send some more money to the to the people there to help them because what we've been doing for years is we've been sending money to brother Vernon and He is wonderful to give us a penny by Penny itemized sheet I mean when we send the money he writes it down just like you're getting it from the bank everything that go comes in everything that goes out he's real good at that and I appreciate it saying I have confidence in him to where that we don't but what we've been doing see is letting those Brothers brother Danny brother Nester brother Vernon and a lot of those Brothers go to the some of the places like Vietnam Cambodia L off there they're going over there but they're going on your money a lot of it because that's helping them out so we'll increase that to them and get it to going okay so let's just sing Open the Eyes of My Heart as Wade comes to minister the word of the Lord unto us all right Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see I want to see how do you see him Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see to see you high and lift it up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy high and lifted up shining in the light of your

be back in the house of the Lord good to see each every one of you with us we keep getting more musicians you're going to have a problem putting them up here we're going to have to get us another yeah get us knock that wall out or something we'll uh man that was good that was good brother Michael absolutely any of you that has a talent God bless your heart please play for I don't care we may have we can just set you in the front somewhere but sure enough uh uh good to see the uh youth doing it for God not for the world Amen always do it that's what I told them yeah that's what I told them in the Philippines I said you young people do not sell yourself to the world don't sell that talent to the world you give it to the Bride of Jesus Christ amen uh let's go and get started but I want to read you something that that I want you to pray about brother Homer Frasier uh they're going to take his leg off tomorrow so uh this evening for those of you that know what Caring Bridge is it's a um place where you can put online what's going on with the people in the hospital so sister Connie wrote said this evening we had a meeting with the team doctors they think it's best that Dad should have his leg amputated above the knee unless something changes this will be done on Monday he told us if Dad kept his leg and there isn't a promise he would keep it that he would be through have to go through 12 to 15 more surgeries in the next year and he would be in and out of the hospital rehab and nursing home so he made the decision brother Homer made the decision to go ahead and remove the leg because he had been at a week in state and said he didn't know if he was strong enough to go through that many more surgeries cuz he's in his 80s and he had that tractor accident and they're they're um they saying he'll feel better once this happens so let's keep brother Homer Frasier in our prayers we all most of us know who he is and a good breth in the Lord in his 80s track accident several months ago so let's just keep him in prayer as we go to the Lord let's bow our heads dear heavenly father you're still Jehovah jyra you're still the Healer and the provider we pray that you'd bless brother Homer Lord being a good friend of ours plus a brother Lord we pray that You' just touch him Lord just be with him and take that infection away Lord we know that nothing's impossible for you father we pray here in the building if there be anyone that's sick and the ones that are are not here Lord we pray that you'd heal them Father now we ask your blessings on everyone Lord that's that's here today Father we pray that you'd be the preeminent one in the service you take over you do the speaking you do the hearing you do the revealing father just be with us and bless us take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name we pray amen let's turn to the book of Acts very familiar scripture but we're going to start with verse 36 says therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart remember Peter's preaching them a sermon amen Peter pet Peter is preaching the gospel to the 3,000 downstairs now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do verse 38 and Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promis is unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off even as many as our Lord Our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourself from this untour generation then they that gladly receive his word were baptized the same day they were added unto them about 3,000 Souls now we'd have a Revival if we could add 3,000 Souls we'd have a Revival if we could had three and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship so that so my whole part is watch what he's saying here and they continued steadfast in the apostles Doctrine in Fellowship it wasn't the apostles Doctrine it was the Lord Jesus Christ doctrine that the apostles were given to the people and they continued steadfast in that Doctrine and fellowship they didn't fellowship with him and in leave they fellowship and in Breaking of bread and in prayer and Fe fear Came Upon every soul and Many Wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believe were together and had all things in common you may be seated in the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word because we did the one of the highlights that we'll get to in just a moment was going to the island of palan and going through a mystery Expo now for those of you that are new or don't know what a mystery Expo is is what they started years ago several years ago is they would they would go out among the denominational churches and they would advertise that they were going to have a mystery Expo Mysteries of the Bible they were going to bring a group of people together and we're going to explain some of the Mysteries of the Bible Well if you make it a mystery Expo and you advertise it and feed them and feed them they'll show up so they showed up in droves at first and still we're going to see one that that we were very privileged to be a part of in just a minute but the mystery Expo was it was telling the people the denominational ministers about the end time message but not say brother Ram's name until the very end okay not not showing anything not hiding anything from people but bringing it right straight through the scripture and not having to say brother Brown I'm set okay so uh very wonderful job they did so but let's start where we finish this morning this is brother Chris regalato right here and this is my interpreter and if you'll see in a minute he's about 4 fo8 so he's a little bitty guy but he does he he was very fluent in English and uh he did a wonderful job so this is in brother Chris's home this is Sunday morning before we went to Brother Danny Del Mundo's anniversary meeting so go to the next slide this is some of the Believers there this is his church all right go ahead brother Anderson reminded me we only got to slide 85 of 251 so we going to have to fly through this pretty fast I don't know why he reminded me of that but this is the song leader there keep going this is that brother Chris's Church uh this look there's one of the boxes there's another one sitting right there so all right go ahead there's brother Jojo now brother story behind that that I didn't know if you knew this or not brother JoJo's father started this church several years ago now I talked to brother Jo joo's father he speaks very good English and he's very appreciative of brother Dale cuz he listens to him every week amen okay so thank God for that but JoJo's dad started this church so many years ago and then when his dad they moved on to another area they give this church to brother Chris and brother Chris is doing a wonderful job so brother JoJo's testifying about how his dad came and I didn't understand what he was saying cuz he was speaking in t Gallo so go ahead that's brother Chris that's the pastor all right keep going you see the air conditioning you see it pointing away from me it's not pointing toward me but you see the big guy that's doing the interpreting there so uh we spoke uh we spoke on the Statue of perfect man of maturity we always spoke on maturity trying to get the people to go on to maturity and not be babies always made the statement that Jesus Christ is not coming back for a baby bride he's coming back for a full grown woman I mean a real bride not a baby so that's what he's coming back for he's not coming back for babies he's coming back for full grown wife the wife has made herself ready okay so now if you'll remember I'm see I'm in traditional garb here when I got finished preaching that arm was soaked it was it was brown I mean um dark blue with sweat so I didn't wear them anymore I wear these all right so go ahead then I'm we're finished there and we're worshiping keep going this this little guy right here um we prayed for him he's um uh we didn't come up for prayer but I think that's his mother but he's he's um a little mentally so we just had a little prayer and got to meet him and uh God can do all things am amen all right so we'll see that's brother Chris good brother good brother all right go ahead if you'll notice some of them are different color it's some of the influence of of their tribal people are darker colored than than other so you can you can see where some of them have a little darker complexion uh some of them have obviously have American uh from the world from the war in World War II there was a lot of um a lot of American Filipino American babies born um but this is his whole church the whole church family here and um but that's just a reason some of them are different different color than the others all right go ahead this is his wife and two daughters and son okay go ahead this is all of this is the brother Chris I cannot remember what that brother's name is and brother Jojo so we get in the car and we head to brother Danny's church now this is brother Danny del mundo everybody knows who he is we're not going backwards go forward there you go Bob please don't go backwards we'll never get finished now brother Danny's church since Dad was there has expanded so go to the next one this is the new part here all right keep going that's looking back toward the the back of the church all that was 50 seats back here that was all full there's a balcony this is where there was 600 people that that that evening go ahead where I'm standing this was where the church used to be when Dad preached that was the pull pit right there so they expanded on back that much further and brother Danny's house is underneath the bottom all right go ahead this is Sister Isabella that's Brother D brother Danny's wife that's brother Danny's wife she's a sweetheart and I want to read to you something that she sent the other day it's kind of funny it was kind of funny or I wouldn't read it if it was something serious about me I surely wouldn't read it says Shalom sister June how I love to read your message though I have limited stock of words I'm so glad you understand me as I remember when brother Danny visited your place he told me good things about your family that's why when I heard brother Wade it was coming I'm thinking about what things to make him happy and I'm so amazed because he was more humorous than us he always told us that we were crazy people but I noticed he was more comedian than us anyway we appreciate him so much he delivered his message more deeper and easily to understand we are blessed no looking forward to seeing him again together with you in the Philippines so she reminds me a lot of June cuz you never saw her she was working she was trying to feed 600 people so she was you know she' she'd walk by and hand me a cup of coffee and just keep going on out the door you know she was one of them those kind of people but that sister Isabella she's a sweetie so go ahead and they all sent back stuff for June and and Di said grna why are you so blessed why people so bless you but they did send me back some things too but this is the balcony fall and then this is the the sanctuary now down right here where this where these trees are there's a place you can walk down and nobody took a picture of it but there was over 300 people sitting in a courtyard dad been he's been there before brother JoJo's house is right back here but there's a courtyard about the size of this church and and twice is wide and there was 300 people sitting down there plus the 300 people that were in the Auditorium so there was a lot of people there go ahead and that's some they're worshiping and praising the Lord all right keep going then that's brother Ro's there and brother Danny all right keep going then that's that's a it's a nice church then they see they had go back see that starts putting seats out you know for people to come in all right go ahead this brother was a real good singer I can't remember what he's saying but he did a good job go ahead and then that's everybody worshiping there keep going you notice the air conditioners on the wall yeah fans yeah this is the Youth of the church all right keep going and brother roel they asked him to pray for the family this is Brother Dany his wife daughter and three sons this one right here was born with a hole in his heart and God just closed that thing right up when he was young didn't you know didn't think he was going to survive so anyway so brother royel was praying over the family so go ahead then this is when we get started and when we get started brother Danny's interpreting for me and I told him I said look I I told them at first I mean they're all sitting on the edge of their seat cuz you're new and they don't know what you're going to say and and but we're standing just like that but when I get finished praying I look over at brother Danny and I told the people I said can I ask you a question they said yeah go ahead ask you know they okay I said which looks more like a Filipino me or him I said he looks like the American and I look like the Filipino so they all laughed about it you know kind of broke the ice so anyway so I'm preaching away and keep going and brother Danny's interpreting keep going and then brother Danny's interpreting keep going then I start and I what I did is I preached on the three stages of justification you know before you get into the body and then three stages of justification sanctification baptism holy ghost in Three Stages here so the three stages of adoption in with the Statue of a perfect man and they really enjoyed it but keep going so you see brother Danny's there well now I noticed that when I would preach when I'd say something they were amening before brother Dany would interpret so I was noticing that and then keep going brother Danny's there this is a little bit further on in to about right there then you're going to notice he goes over here and sits down brother roel says he just speaks up he speaks up he said brother Danny I think you can sit down now I think they're understanding what he's saying cuz they were amening me before brother Danny was able to to interpret so brother Danny just lays the microphone down and goes over and sits down so I'm you know I'm flying then I'm I'm not having to wait on interpreter cuz you have to wait you have to wait you have to wait till he gets finished so all right go ahead so keep going so now he's over here and we're almost finished but brother Danny's over there so we had a good time in the Lord they they really enjoyed it and I enjoyed it and uh keep going and but there was about 30 all these right here are ministers all these right here actually those are pastors some sitting over here and some sitting here so it was really good that we were able to to speak not only to the Ley but to the to the ministers and if you read that what brother Vernon said that it was a real good impact because a lot of ministers were there to listen because you know what you can't preach to every congregation right so but if you can preach to the ministers and they can catch what you're saying they can take it to their congregation cuz they live with the people and that's exactly what I wanted to do that was my goal was to get the ministers in the mindset of maturity and of the Statue of a perfect man and of those things in the Lord maybe a little bit higher than they had seen it so go ahead then brother Danny starts preaching he catches it and he starts preaching and he preaches for about 15 or 20 minutes so but anyway it's an anniversary meeting they don't listen they don't watch their clock they they don't care it be 9:00 at night they didn't matter to them so go ahead then brother Royale dedicated this uh child and the family with them so keep going and then this is all this is brother Danny and this is his deacons and preachers right here Jojo and all them uh they had brother Nester pray over them and each one of the services they had that uh opportunity to bring all the ministers and all the deacons up and have prayer over them so so that's what happened there go ahead then we ate all right there's brother Val and that's brother dendo brother Danny now keep going there's the duck the ducks in that bowl well the two ducks the sacrificial ducks are in that bowl right there and uh they were good we ate them it was good food it was good it was really good and um we all enjoyed it so keep going and this is brother Joe I wanted to show this for Dad when Dad was over there this one wasn't born and this one wasn't born and that one was a baby and he only had those two girls so they've grown up he's done real well this is his home he has good roof and good place obviously God has blessed him amen and he's kind of a jack of all trades but he really loves brother Dale no doubt he sent me a text message just a little while ago well yesterday two days ago and said that he wanted to come over here and drive for us okay whatever but anyway I thought JoJo you'd run all over people but anyway that's for brother that's it brother Danny's anniversary meeting so we left there and when we left there we went to Brother Royal's now brother Dany and brother Vernon did not go with us anymore brother Danny came to the meeting at brother Royal's but from now on I'm going to be with with brother Royal Sano so go to the next slide this is Brother Royals this is uh I think we we dedic dedicated something I can't remember what all it was we dedicated but um this is his Fellowship Hall that's not all the way finished yet keep going I took some of these pictures now he has a big church but all this is done by the Believers there was no money spent outside that was all the architect he's got two or three Architects plus brother royel is an architect so they did all this design their own self they built it their own self and it's beautiful all right so go ahead and that's the back with the balcony all right go ahead and that's looking up from the balcony down all right and that's the name of their Church Overcomers Worship Center where Jesus Christ Alone takes preeminence all right next slide this is the front of it all right you come in here go back Anderson are you back there no but right here I wanted to show this picture cuz right here is the uh that's an apartment that's where I stayed the other week and a half I was there I stayed in that apartment when we weren't in plowing but all this is secure somebody lives at the church all the time there's no way somebody can get in without somebody letting you in but this is an apartment right here is a door and that's where I stayed so it was all safe and sound it was just a real nice place you were there Louise you yeah okay all right go ahead very functional so the next day we didn't have anything to do so we went up on top of the mountain looked out over there and I thought somebody started a fire but it was smog so they said no brother that's smog so we were we were just sightseing that day go ahead now the night that we got back from there that day all the deacons and this is all his deacons and preachers got together in the evening and we we had a conversation of anything from this brother was interested in bees so we talked about honey bees that we were talking about the Lord we were talking about all different things about the the island and before we left to go to palan they all wanted to get together and pray so these are all the deacons and all the Elders of the Church of brother royel so a very uh tight-knit group of people all right so go ahead and that's the next day we flew on SIU Pacific plane was packed full of people I saw more Americans on this island than I saw in the ho of manella because it's a vacation spot um kind of a resort island in the um South part of of of the Philippines so go to the next slide that we flew into Porto Princessa airport and that's where we stayed at a motel there and then we did our Outreach from there and that's actually where the mystery Expo was was in in PTO Princessa okay which means P of the princess now this is that one of those th uh this is a motorcycle 150 cc Honda sitting right here and then keep going that's me and brother Royale taking a selfie I don't do that but but it looked good go ahead so there we are sitting in and I mean there's thousands of these things and I mean they're enclosed and got a motorcycle and the problem with these things are is they're not made for big Americans Aaron would have had to PID double cuz me and brother royel got in this one the purple one and we were going to see another beekeeper and he had closed so we go out through here and we could both sit side by side but I had to have my arm around him but when we come back we got go ahead show the next one we got into this flowery colored looking one and it was made for two Philipino children to sit in I had to sit right up here real close to the edge and brother royel was behind me and there was another brother sitting over here well one of us had to get out for it to go up a hill I told the guy I said I'm sorry not made for these big americanos to sit in this thing and he just looked at me and laughed you know but he said one of y'all got to get out cuz 150 CC's plus hauling all that plus hauling all this um didn't make it so we had to get out but the place we met keep going the place we met was here it was an open air restaurant owned by one of the daughters of the um mayor not mayor but the congressman of the island so there was a big mansion sitting right over here and this is her restaurant but it was on top of a hill I'm talking about like this that's why we had to get out and let some of them walk and get another buggy but this is Brother roel that's brother this is Brother Leto solo now he's a good one that guy leaves his family for three months to come on this island and preach to these people and this is Brother Dany these are the ones we baptized these three plus his his wife uh this is uh brother Ro's uncle brother Romy he went with us all right so go ahead now this we drove for 3 hours North to a place called San Ben Cente the pastor's house I thought we were going this is just like a village you know where they stored stuff no the pastor lives right there I'll show it to you in a minute but that's his boat and they go out here in the bay and they fish and that's what they do for a living plus brother Nelson he's got one of the only battery chargers on the whole on the whole Puerto prin or the San vente area and so he's just got batteries lined up and he's got them plugged in to be uh charged because of all these boats so he makes his money that way too so go to the next slide oops um that's someone's that's food later on go ahead I was amazed there was something that big on that island they eat them usually before that but right there is the pastor's house and it was just off the ground no door no windows you just stepped up into the house and I thought it was just a shack where where um and I don't mean that bad but I just thought it was a place where the fisherman would go and just sit but no that was the pastor's home all right so we're sitting on a bridge with a little Canal here and they go out and fish that's beautiful right there the one of the most beautiful islands in the world that's been boed all right so go ahead and that's it the brother that's brother Nelson right there and this is his in-laws and they were cooking they asked me they said do you know your way around the kitchen we go to the next slide I said absolutely I know how to get in the kitchen I stir up rice or something I

head wasn't this far from the ceiling so that light was burning my head up anyway so go ahead there's brother Nelson yeah see how long that light is and he's very short and it's right there at his head so I had to get away from it go ahead so there's the church all right go keep going that's brother Nelson his wife and the children all right now oh go back now brother Nelson was sitting and I I

looked over at the guitar and it's uh oh it's about like that one that Chris plays and it looked like they had drag it down the dirt road for 2 miles drag it back down the dirt road 20 years ago and then I mean it was so rough it wasn't black anymore it was gray and every time about every minute or less than a minute he's playing away on this electric guitar and the cord falls out he goes and he has to stop reach and plug it back in well I'll make a long story short thanks to you he's got a new guitar you'll see them in a minute but I we bought four you know what epitone is right that's a offshoot from a Gibson we found a store that had we bought an electric guitar and three acoustic guitars and I'll show you who they went to for less than $400 less it was like $365 they gave us 25% off and that was probably one of the biggest sales they' made in a year or two in that little store but they gave us a good price so now brother Nelson has a guitard almost like that one but it's an epitone which is good that's okay for them and it won't sound like he's you know it's uh all broke down so he he didn't know that until now and brother Vernon sent me a um I mean brother Royal sent a note back said that he said thank you cuz he didn't get it till after we had already left all right so go ahead now this is where this is where it gets fun this is the mystery Expo and I want you to look at this and I want you to realize one thing these people we we think we give our life for the gospel when we come into the message of the hour and maybe our family will turn against us or something this brother his name is gelito cahilig he was 45 years he was a Baptist preacher Baptist pastor at a big Baptist Church on the island for 45 years several month well less than a year ago he came to an mystery Expo and accepted the message they kicked him out of the church and most of his family won't have anything to to do with him but you know what he said to God be the glory he's claiming his family four of his five sons are Baptist preachers so they're really giving him a hard time but he come out of that church and started evangelizing preaching the message of the hour and he has no reservation he said I'd do it again he said I'd do it again it wouldn't matter what so that's what you need to look and see he was kicked out this next brother go ahead this is brother mercurium and his wife Marilyn now Marilyn was a woman preacher she had her own church she came to a they came to a mystery Expo she quit preaching accepted the message and they're going around now he's the pastor and she's the wife all right so thank God for that so now the next one this brother here I liked him because he's left-handed number one but his name is Edward seam malum and sister Bing they live in suud 6 hours drive from that meeting he was six months ago he was a dean he was a dean of a Bible College denominational dean of a Bible College accepted the message 6 months ago they kicked him out of the college and he had to go build him a house and a church 6 months ago and we'll see a picture in just a minute but I asked him I said cuz he spoke real good English going he interpreted for me I said brother you're a you're the dean of a bible school I said when you get to a certain scripture in the Bible I said what' y'all do he said well if we understood it we studied it he said if we didn't we just skipped over it he said now we don't skip over said now we don't skip over scriptures anymore but that's his wife all right now this is what go ahead that's what he lives in now what a sacrifice next that's his church he built it out of thatch and that's his um that's his LED screen which is a chalkboard they sit on bamboo rails and that he has to bring a generator from town I didn't see it I thought I might see it but he brings a generator and that's how they have power for their services dean of a bible school had it made till 6 months ago he came to a mystery Expo and accepted the message of the hour and seemingly his whole world fell apart but I he doesn't see it that way no he doesn't see it that way at all now he's working with keep going oh by the way he's working with this brother here this brother here is brother masam he is a tribal chief of the palan tribe there on the island this brother has built four message churches and I said brother what do you need he said I'm working on number five he said I got four finished I'm working on number five I said what do you need he said well he said I tell the congregation that I need so much bored feet and I need so many bamboo pieces and I need so much wood so they go up in the woods and get it he said all I need is Nails he said we can't afford to buy Nails I said how many nails would it take to build one church and he told me how many kilos well brother Edward said well that is the equivalent of $50 so for $50 you can build one church with that many nails so I gave him $100 to finish number five and start number six so and and he is just he works with the tribe 6 hours away and brother Edward which that's the one that was the Bible the dean of the Bible school he helps him and he they the three three of the three of the five churches he built had no instruments at all so that's where the other three epitone uh regular acoustic guitars came from was three of them go to his to those tribal churches and brother Edward took them for us you'll see them in a minute but that's brother letho now brother letho has found favor with these denominational people these have already come in the message cuz they come they come from Mystery Expos before but he has found favor with the people and and that brother needs some support because he he leaves his family for 3 months sleeps on the floor at somebody's house because when you bring these people this mystery Expo there's 60 you're going to see him in a minute there's 60 denominational people 15 of them has already sent him a text message when we got back to to Manila wanting him to come and further what they just heard because see if you just took and did a mystery Expo and you got 15 out of 60 well well if you didn't go back what' you do right if you if you didn't go back if they're wanting you to come well see that's what his job is and he don't pay you know brother Joe Green gives him $100 a month and that's what he travels on but he goes back and preaches for these people in their churches he's done it for these brothers here and he's found a lot of favor with them over on the island of palan so let's keep going I'm sorry it may take a little while today but there's the these are all denominational preachers right here all these some of the other ones that come there were 60 denominational preachers seven of them were female there was 85 total some of the other ones are sitting back here that's already been accepted to mage is they're sitting here and the restaurants over here where they fed them at all right so uh all right we got to that part so the only problem that we had and I I don't know how to address this but and I don't know how to say it where the well I don't care if it gets on the Internet or not um they requested because what they did is when they do the mystery Expo they hand at the end they tell them who brother brandom is and they hand them all a church AE book and say here go read the church AE book well they requested 60 Church AE books from voice of God which has an office in the Philippines and they would not give them the church A's books unless they had a name and an address of where they were going to so we didn't have any church A's books to give this group of people because the voice of God wanted an address and a phone number of who it was going to and brother royel told said we don't know who it's going to yet you know I mean how I'm just saying how dumb is that I mean the greatest message in the world and you want names and phone numbers please people come on I'd pay for them to be printed myself but I don't know but all these people were they sat all day and listened to brother roel and myself and and brother Leto and never got up they never you know they never shook their head walked out I told him I you can't do that in the United States you can't get 60 message pre Preachers in the same room hardly in the United States without somebody getting up walking out you're sure not going to get them from 9:00 in the morning to 5:00 in the afternoon so but there is something that that can come from this there's tablets that brother roel has found a place that you can buy it's just a a normal tablet it's not like this it's a little bit smaller but for $50 they'll load the message on it and you can hand it out to these people and most of them have electricity so most of them can get the message and brother Joe Green I think he purchased 50 50 of them to give out one time but we didn't have enough to give they only had like 10 left to give out to this group of people so let's go ahead but remember these are denominational people that's never heard of nothing they never heard of brother brandham never heard his name never had never heard of who brother brandham was all right here and I loved it all right keep going brother Leto started it off keep going then we broke for lunch and come back everybody ate and everybody came back all right go ahead keep going so this is all now look at them they're all writing look at them they're all paying attention they're not looking off over in the cloud somewhere they're this brother right here took three pages of notes cuz I'm sitting right over there well I'm taking this picture but I sit right over there this brother and his wife took three pages of notes while he was talking so brother R starts and he talks about the Mysteries then he talks about the first coming of Jesus was in such a mystery nobody knew about it so that's how you have to start you have to show them in the Bible you can't say brother R said you have to show them in the Bible that that there's something coming right then you go to Malachi 4 and then you back up from Malachi 4 to the five comings of Elijah all right so he brother royel spoke keep going on the five comings of Elijah and also the the son of man Ministry remember where Matthew says the son of man be risen again all right so he the son of man's got to come back and and you got to remember these are denominational preachers you can't say brother random said you got to keep it all in the scripture and he did an absolute wonderful job and then he started on the five comings of Elijah well he actually asked me to speak on the statute of a perfect man but I didn't feel led to do that because of that's a little bit more advanced than what they would what they would need at the moment so not taking anything CU brother roel knows knows this we sat over there and discussed it he was bringing out the fin coming of of Elijah and I just took the five comings and went a little deeper than he's ever went before as far as he never saw that that Elijah remember Elijah remember the M the ministry of Elijah was a what it was a Myster of rest Ministry of restoration right but it was also a Ministry of condemnation Elijah had to deal with what prophet Bale Jezebel and the um widow woman so Jezebel got condemnation the widow woman got restoration Elisha same thing Elisha dealt with the school of the prophets denominations I you can't say that to them though cuz you don't want you know you don't want him to I told brother royel I said you know there there's two ways of doing this you can go in there and and do like we're doing or you can go in there and say y'all are all Daughters of the you know well that would cut them off real quick so you just go into them and you show them that look Elijah the five comings of Elijah had to deal with all the same things they dealt with a school of prophets or Baal you know the prophets of baale with Elijah School of prophets with Elisha John the Baptist had to deal with what Pharisees and Sadducees the fourth coming of Elijah will have to deal with the same thing and the fifth coming of Elijah has to deal with what the Roman Catholic church and all the things that they were coming out of but same way with Elijah he had a a two women they all had two women to deal with one was Jezebel condemnation and one was this the widow woman restoration Elijah Elisha when Elisha come he had to deal with actually he dealt with the death of Jezebel all right so he still had to deal with Jezebel plus he dealt with what the shunamite woman restoration He restored her back same thing with John the Baptist John the Baptist steps out he condemns the the woman the church and then he takes birth to the new church man come bring you over into the New Testament he brought that to the new church but he had to deal with the school of prophets too which was the Pharisees and the Sadducees and then the fourth coming of Elijah the same thing happens you got a school of prophets the denomination School of prophets then you got condemnation he was condemning the denomination then the woman and then he what brought a bride out so the fourth coming of Elijah had to do the same thing fifth coming of Elijah is exactly the same thing he's dealing with the Roman Catholic Church he's dealing with the the Jews that's going to turn him down right the fifth coming of Elijah it's going to be the Jews that turn him down then he's going to call out 144,000 so you got the same pattern all the way down through there and brother roel hadn't went that deep in it he was sitting over there he's about to fall out of the chair rejoicing but but they understood more I mean they they took it then when you bring that forthcoming of Elijah in they have to see their amen and all through the whole thing that oh amen amen we know yeah that's that's good that's right and then you lay in that forthcoming of Elijah there you know so they have to either owe me or amen cuz watch what brother real said he said you amen that a minute ago yeah you amen that a minute ago all right so let's go ahead he that he's doing his work all right keep going uh this is a brother that we stuck this in here but this brother right here is doing a real good work he's an old he's 77 years old look that head of hair on that man but he's doing a work over there and you'll see the next picture of him he come out of denomination go ahead next one I took a picture of him with his hat off I said man you're 70 something years old you got full head of hair but him and his son are working doing the same thing they're evangelizing preaching the message of the hour and him 77 years old all right so go ahead keep going just keep going through it brother roel is doing he's just pound in them good right here see them all they're looking down they're reading their Bible every one of them when he tells them to go to scripture they go to that scripture okay keep going then that's when I was speaking about the the five coming of Elijah and brother Edward was interpreting go ahead keep going keep going keep going all right go ahead because it's yeah then then brother roel gets back up and here's what go ahead keep going he comes to here and then he shows them William Mar brandom well well they don't know nothing about that so they're all you know and you see some of them texting and you see some of them looking and writing his name down so I I felt in my heart one thing cuz me and brother re had already been talking about this I said you know what they're going to do they're going to Google William brandham right and they're gonna get all the bad first right so yeah so I believe it was the Lord I asked brother roel I said can I speak one more time cuz it wasn't close to 5:00 so we were we were getting uh finish a little faster go ahead to the next one so I get back up and he interprets so what I do is is I say okay listen we've we've brought this we brought this person this mystery of Elijah number four we brought this to you but I want to I want to take us back 200000 years so I grabbed my pad and I told him I said now we're going to go back to 2,000 years I'm going back 2,000 years and I'm going to take my iPad back with me so brother Ro he caught on to what I was going to try to do so he gets into it and so the next slide so he's see he's doing a lot of the talking now but what I done was I flipped on my iPad and I walked up and I said now I'm walking by the River Jordan cuz that's where I get good Wi-Fi service 2,000 years ago I'm walking close to the and I see this man standing out in the middle of the water and he's just preaching his heart out he ain't got on nothing but grass and he's got honey dripping off of his lips and you know he's got some wild locust in his pocket and he's preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is coming and and he just and I thought man what is that man's name it oh John the Baptist so I said I put in John the Baptist and I look I go to Wikipedia I put in John the Baptist oh he left home at 9 years old he goes into the Wilderness and I give the you know the description of John the Baptist and I go to and I said well no and I'm doing this I'm illustrating so I said now I'm scrolling down oh it says it gives me another link go to www.arise.com and ww. sad.com so I mashed that and I said oh now they say things different about John they say he's a heretic they say he's this you see what the point I'm I'm trying to make so amen so it was good and I said well now there's another man he just walked up and I'm standing here trying to get my Wi-Fi service you know and I said there's another man here he's got long hair he's got on a robe and John's pointing at him who is this guy he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world I thought man who is this man and somebody says well that's Jesus of Nazareth so I said well punch in Jesus of Nazareth Wikipedia you know Jesus of Nazareth and says he's a good man was born under a little shady condition and I go through his life you know what Wikipedia would say about him then I go man it says go to ph.com again so on mash.com and it says this man's be elub this man's a devil this man's a disruptor this man's of this and that and the other you understand what I'm saying so I told him I said so when you punch in William brandom's name I said you just remember what I said because you're going to get all the bad but you know what if people were standing there John the Baptist would not win he would not be the Rotary Club president neither would Jesus I said so you take that with a grain of salt and I said you let God speak to your heart [Applause] so but you remember now two these people now there's 15 of them keep going just keep going on through we're not going to get faint brother Leto is up at the end and he said okay if you actually I gave them my website our website here so they may be keying on to our website too and looking at some things which is fine with me I don't care brother roel didn't mind but brother letho tells him said look here's my phone number if you want any more information text me 15 people text him before we got back to Manila wanting him to preach and one of them was a woman preacher wanting him to preach in a church so see the work just begins when you get them 15 people somebody's got to go back over there and pretty much live with them people for a month or to to try to get them established in the present day truth that's why I was reading that about repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ cuz they continued remember we read the scripture they continued in the apostles Doctrine all right so that's what you got to do you can't just go over there and have a mystery Expo and say man we had 60 people and we had a good time and we left you did not do any good at all you actually did worse than if You' have never been there before right so brother Leto is the one that goes back over there in another week or two or probably now goes back over there and he lives with these people not literally but you what you understand what I mean goes into the church starts preaching water a baptism starts preaching one God starts preaching you know the how to receive the Holy Ghost really and how to get baptized so that that's the hinge point of the whole thing is to get somebody over there excuse me to bring that keep going so this is getting toward the end of the meeting all right and there they're all enjoying it we we prayed for this little boy he's got a a knot right there on his neck and we I don't know what happened I'll try to find out later but we had prayer for him he wanted us to pray for him so we did and um we'll see how the Lord I believe it was I believe it was healed he had to go the next day he had a knot right here on his neck and it was bothering him go ahead so then we had prayer and uh and got ready to dismiss keep going there's him right there all right now we come back to the motel this is when we get ready to leave brother Leto brother Edward and brother Dany now brother Danny's the one we've been talking about this guy didn't leave our site since we got on the island cuz he was a denominational preacher he was also a gang member for the mafia tattoos and everything on his arm he was he was a strong man with the mafia cuz they have him over there and you have to go pay money you have to pay them protection money so he was collecting the money and somehow God struck that man down one day and he became a denominational preacher then he came to one of the Expos before and really didn't understand but buddy we laid the water baptism on him for about 3 days and he didn't leave our sight so there's one that's the electric guitar there that's going to to brother Nelson and these are the three this brother put them on a motorcycle put these three not that one but the three acoustic he strapped them to a motorcycle and took them 6 hours to those trouble people we can't come to church 15 miles I'm going to tell you something people you going to give a count on the day of judgment that's right cuz you see what that 6 hours on a motorcycle strapping three guitars on just to get them to the people so they can just have one instrument to worship with one instrument so anyway all right go ahead so the next day 238 this is the Pacific Ocean this is right behind one of the pastor's houses all right keep going this is that's me of course and brother Danny is right there and brother Johnny he'd been witnessing to him the whole three days when he'd leave us and go eat or something he'd talk he'd call his buddy and talk to him so his buddy and him and the two sisters the two wives were baptized so we took them out and brother dick that's like the flats out in U Port St Joe you can walk all see that dot right there that's almost how far you can walk and it's not much above your knees well I told him I said look y'all are little people if I can find a hole we going to baptize so we got out about right here and brother roel said you can't go any further cuz I can't get a picture of you I can't hear you and I remember back when we were at P St Joe stingrays would get to a place and they would wallow a hole out brother dick knows what I'm talking about we found one right there and it was just big enough for me to stand in and for them to stand in keep going you'll see right there that's as far deep as it'll go everything else was higher cuz you see all the all the um um debris and stuff out here we found one hole and I told him I said I'm going to get you in the water and you don't fight I'm just going to put you down in the water and you call your name cuz I didn't know all of them's name at that time but brother Royale said it sounded like he could hear every word I said now he baptized the same way you do the same way we do same identical way to fulfill the Great Commission that the Lord Jesus told us to go into all the world preach the gospel baptize the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost I now baptize thee my sister and brother in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so that's what we did but we were a 100 yards out in there and brother roel said it sounded like a megaphone of course my voice is pretty loud anyway but um there was boats going here there's a boat over there but he said he could hear it just as clear and we baptized them in the name of Jesus Christ and there they are right [Applause] there now the story behind this is this brother they're all these These are now the they're pastors preachers and pastors this is their wives they have had they had one baby that was born without a rectum and they when during the operation the baby died so then she became pregnant again in four months months into the pregnancy she lost a child so they were praying for a baby so they asked me to pray for them so we prayed that they would have a child and I told him I said when you I said when it's a boy name it Samuel cuz Samuel was a gift from God in the Bible I wasn't especially for for us I was saying you know you name it Samuel cuz it's going to be a gift from God so they said that's fine I told him I said look you just enjoy yourself have fun don't even worry about it you know just be husband and wife so we'll see how that goes but keep going to the next one this is Brother Rudy limato that's the only guy that was taller than me in the whole island but what's what's kind of funny is brother Rudy's about my size well see my clothes were wet and I wasn't going to wear them back on the plane so I gave him all my clothes he's the only one that could wear it cuz the rest of them couldn't wear my clothes they were so little so I left my clothes with him and uh he's got a pair of khaki pants and a spoken word t-shirt and I lost a pair of shoes somewhere I guess I gave them to him too I don't know where I where I lost them shoes at but anyway but this is his this is where all right go to the next one this is where they had the first mystery Expo this is nothing but dirt right down here and his church is kind of open air in the back they're praying for um to be able to enclose the backs side of the church so that's brother Rudy and brother roel and myself that's the ones we baptized right there and then we took off and flew back to um manella on Friday all right keep going

to eat all right go ahead this is continuation of the service this brother here is a Bible scholar he came in the message 10 or 12 years ago I don't know whether it was a mystery Expo I don't think so

do though they pray they don't Grumble amen go ahead they're working for a greater goal sometimes we think you know if we don't do this right or that right that the whole church is going to fall apart please people that ain't life life is getting somebody saved baptized and and raised up in the message you know so that God can use them that was my whole theme is how God can use you this was all the

I met at brother Ro's church I noticed two brothers were were amening kind of quick sitting in the in the sanctuary at brother Royal's the morning service and they came up to me afterwards and anyway make a long story short they they live about two hours from any message church so they are probably right now live streaming so we got a church in the Philippines but no they listen to us every service he knew exact they knew what I was talking about they already heard it so they you know they were amen and so I didn't know that they were doing that but uh uh if you're watching you need to

mile walk there's no cars you got to walk a quarter of a mile to get to the church I didn't know that he said we're going to get wet he said I don't want to get wet so they go back to talking well about right here um he um I told him he he said why are you quiet I said there's two things I'm quiet I'm either thinking or praying so I told Lord I said Lord according to what I've been preaching on this island I'm going to say Thank You Lord to you stop it rain two minutes later it stop raining sun came out it never rained another drop and you know they didn't even realize it till I got up to the church and I told them at the church I said did you notice it quit raining and brother roel said yeah it quit raining it didn't rain no more I said yeah you asked me what I was quiet about I said I was praying I said Lord I'm going to say Thank You Lord until you stop that rain and 2 minutes later done didn't rain another drop so anyway go back but this brother this is us going back so you can see we're not wet but brother his name is brother Ben and he's brother Joe Green is helping them finish their Church go back there's a downstairs right here that you walk down this little brother was it's kind of funny brother roel was going to interpret but uh brother Gino was with us and he said well I want him to learn so he he told me he said if you'd have preached 10 more minutes he said I'd have fainted cuz he was getting he was so nervous but anyway he did a good job but anyway down here is the the the restrooms and the little place for um um kind of a fellowship hall and brother Joe Green has given $400 to finish that and so brother Joe Green was at this church here and the wood up here some of it's falling down so it needs a little bit of repair but they're okay I mean it was a Monday and they still had 30 or 40 people there so um we thank God for that but now you can go forward back the other way we're getting ready to leave that's some of the deacons and then that's us going aheading back to uh to the port where we got off this thing right here in Christine whe call that in tallo it's some word but in English it means dumb fish or stupid fish cuz what happens is the fish go in into this trap and they get in this circle and they can't get back out so instead of them catching them or netting them they just go in there and scoop them up inside that little thing it's made like a almost like a maze well when the fish get in there they can't Circle and go back out the way they came so they just harvest the fish cuz they eat a lot of fish over there but we didn't I didn't e any of them that's the one where they bought me the McDonald's over here in a little town they bought McDonald's and we hauled it over there cuz brother Joe Green ate some of the fish and got set from that island but uh I thank God that that people like brother Joe Green and him you know shares that information and brother do shares the information of of things to do and not to do so we make it back over to the island so now we are uh we're finished with a trip go ahead to the last we come out here that's where we leave from and we're heading back home that's the pastor right there brother Ben all right keep going and we start back we're back at the same restaurant we were at when we started and that's all of us saying our goodbyes and and uh get ready to fly out flight was wonderful ready to get back home like I said I slept a little more on the plane coming home than I did going over there I didn't sleep any going over there but uh and had good seats so uh uh it was in the bulkhead so I didn't have to share my knees with anybody else but these brothers are all good Brothers they're just they're wonderful they they are um very Mission oriented um brother Royal is really happy that Christine and Luis are here because we're you know this church is more minded toward Mission work and uh he's very proud of them and then they're proud of all of us from all the uhu all the reports we got back if read that report from brother bernon that it was all a good report that you know I didn't go over there to forward me or you it's the message of the hour that we we got to grow like I said every church I told him I said look God's got to come back for a mature bride he wants somebody that can speak the word and he'll back it up but not just to be a bunch of babies and cry about it all the time you know so if I hurt feelings and IA but I think I presented it in a way I think the Lord was in the whole thing so so I thank you and I thank the rest of the uh I thank them if they're watching which they said they were some of them would be and some of them probably later on but uh we had several things that happened that were Supernatural the the I believe that van was was uh um on its last leg and uh it made it 4 hours up and four hours back so we yeah we had to put a little water in it but it still made it and uh the then we had the uh the mystery Expo was another highlight the um um the water baptism in the Pacific Ocean I really enjoyed that that was a brother Royale said he was tired and he didn't want to do it he wanted me to do it so I thank God that he uh I mean he could have done it itself they were his people but he asked me what I do it and I said absolutely don't ever give up an opportunity to baptize anybody but uh that was a that was a a highlight plus the uh uh I you know you have to have you have to have we're all human beings you have to have little things that you think well God is this what I'm supposed to be doing am I supposed to be here is this what I'm supposed to be doing and then that's what I I asked him there at the at the um going across that water I said Lord I said according to what I've been preaching I'm going to say Thank You Lord until the rain stops and it wasn't but 2 minutes and it didn't just you know quit it just it stopped stopped raining and it never rained another drop and we couldn't see the island I mean brother Royale said we're going to get wet I didn't know you had to walk a quarter of a mile up the hill to the church but um but God honors our prayer and if you're in the will of God you know what he's going to have to that's right he has to so all of you that have that have done uh that have labored all you that work we all work but I mean physically worked to pay your tithe and to pay your offering and to pay the special um um offering that you gave us and and all of us you know brother Louise and any of us that that have a desire to go it's like brother Joe Green's father said if you can't go send somebody right amen if you can't go send somebody but I covet your prayers I know brother Al brother I mean sister Anna said brother Al and I knew he told me he said I prayed for you every day he said I prayed for you every day and I know you prayed for us we had a wonderful trip back home and like tell you ain't no place like home ain't no place like home but some of these needs that we have you know we met a lot of them but that brother Edward I forgot to tell you brother Edward when he brings his um goes to his church he has to bring the generator but they have no sound system they just have a regular guitar and a sound system will run you about 60 bucks so we're going to try to I'm going to try to send that $60 myself to pay for for brother Edward's um sound system and if IID have known that we could have got one at that guitar place for about $40 with a 25% discount but I didn't know it until then but like brother Dale said there's certain things that we're going to do if anything you want to do individually um like I said the um the brother V Diaz and brother Leo solo they need travel expenses cuz they do the leg work that the pastors can't do that pastors has to be Shepherds of their own flock but when you got somebody like brother Leto and somebody like brother ba he is a pastor of a church but he doesn't go as much but when brother Leto goes he goes for three months at a time to uh palan and um forwards the gospel and I see the results because most of the people I met on that island is there a direct result of a mystery Expo direct result they didn't hear it from this person that they actually came together to this mystery Expo the message was presented in a way that it's biblical and then telling them who brother brandham was and then let God work on both ends right you know let God work on both ends that's what I told we were talking about the the Two Sisters I baptized well when they got finished baptizing them they put their pants back on so what big deal we're not talking about that right now I thought water baptism was just a you know it was an outward expression of an inward work they started on a journey even in justification that's right amen right so so I don't that didn't bother me one bit that you know a lot of people it would bother to look and see the girl had on a pair of pants after the baptism and said well she didn't get anything well you don't see it you don't see it that's right but it's like that woman preacher it's like brother royel said he said we never told that sister Marilyn she wasn't supposed to preach she got in the message she got the Revelation and she shut herself down so you do that then you know to me to me if you tell me to do something you know I might do it a little bit but I ain't going to do it a lot but if God speaks to me and shows me in the word and then I get a revelation I ain't supposed to preach then that settles it forever and ever amen so those sisters when God reveals to them that they're they're they're not supposed to wear pants then you know what exactly right in his time you can beat them over the head all day if you want to but amen be holy ghost right that's right be their Holy Ghost right but that's what one thing of those mystery Expos showed me one thing was you can present this message without saying William brandom's name now you got to bring him up in the fourth coming of Elijah but once you bring those comings of Elijah and you put every one of them and they're just a carbon copy so four can't be different than three or five or two or one four is got to have the same characteristics and when you lay that same characteristics in there that he was you know he loved the the desert he loved the Wilderness he you know he had women problems which you know what I mean with the Jezebel and the and the shite widow woman and then here brother random comes up and has the same problems with the denominational church and then he's calling out or restoring a church out of his message then it's like I said they didn't some of them may may never see it but at least 15 of them had enough about saw enough to send the text message to brother Leto and say please would you come and tell us more about this message amen you know so it's refreshing to know that that there was 60 people that didn't know about brother brandom and I mean that in in in all honesty that you could sit there and talk to a group of people and they didn't know who William Brandon was cuz you can't do that in America you can't do it in America you can't talk you say Willam bradam or either they're going to do like I said they're going to hit the they're going to hit the Google button and 30 years ago right but I hope that that little illustration and that's the same way if you had this you know if you had this 2,000 years ago they would have lambasted John the Baptist they would have lambasted Jesus they anybody Peter James John they would have had their you know phe.com would have been full of naysayers so let's stand you know even k.com you know get bring Kus in there you know and he he wouldn't have a whole lot to say about Jesus so thank you for your patience it was really a refesh refreshing time a true refreshing of myself and to be able to meet new people oh that's right I'm sorry brother uh Vernon if you'll read your the little thing that he wrote on day seven there was a sister healed of a heart artery blockage during the service while I was preaching I didn't know that till she told him afterwards that she had prayed that she would be healed it was been brother Dennis's meeting now the Lord really came down in that meeting afterwards didn't pray for the sick but we just prayed for everybody you know and um we worshiped for a good while but the sister was healed of a heart artery blockage on day seven while she was in the congregation so I'm expecting a lot more amen from the from the meeting so Lord bless your heart let's sing a [Applause] song before we get before we go we going to do 396 in the B what is that 36 what's name Jo to the world the lord is come let her receive her King let every heart prepare him and heaven and nature sing and heaven and nature sing and and heaven and nature sing Joy to the World the your R [Applause] [Music] let the whole world with fields and rocks Hills and pl repeat the sounding Jo repeat the sounding Joy repeat repeat the sounding Joy no more and sorrow rain no Thorns the ground he comes to make His blessings know far as the curse is found far as the curse is found far as far as the curse is found he rul the world with truth and fre and the nation Pro the glory of his rightousness and wonders of his love and w of his love Anders wonderers of his love amen you love the Lord amen he's good everywhere I told them over there I said look I said we got the same problems you got same Devils you got they just got American names right I mean we all got the same basically you all got we all have the same problem right and you can send millions of dollars over there but I like the old bage teach the man how to fish teach him how to fish give them the word of God that was my prayer because Dad was a little bit restricted when he went but I was able to do three anniversaries with 70 to 80 preachers in the congregation every meeting and then the ministers meeting and then the mystery Expo and you know I I'm I just be honest being a teacher I like to preach to ministers anyway cuz if you can get them to see what you're talking about they can take it to their you know I could go over there they love me over there in the Philippines but you know what about another two more weeks I'd want to come back home but they're over there that's their people amen what would Paul do Paul would go over to a place and he would be there for a month or two establish them in the present day truth and then he would move on there's no reason for him to stay there cuz he's not one of them I'm not a Filipino I'm not a Jamaican but if we can go and and Spark a little bit of the preachers and the teachers and the pastors they got good teachers over there too they got good ministers but they have to hear we all have to hear that's right so that we can understand and if you can get one or two to see it and then they carry it to their you know everybody wanted me to come preaching the church and that's wonderful that's good but if you I'd rather get 70 preachers in one building and preach to them and then let them 70 take that word not my word but take a revelation of what God's given me and take it to their 40 and 50 and 60 see to me that's to me that's the 100 fold the 60 fold the you know the 30f when you take it out you give it to one group of people and then let them spread it you know go to palan and and give the mystery Expo and and give brother Lio enough time and some money and and say look they're yours you go spread you go spread the gospel you're one of them you found favor with them see I may not find favor with them cuz I'm an American but he's found favor with them he's one of them so he can go brother roel has found favor with the people so he can go and he goes so much till like I said he almost wore himself out and I hope that he slows down a little bit and but he's done a good work over there enough to have somebody like brother Leo or somebody other brother brother Edward God has put those people in place to further the gospel on that island because I told him I said look I said brother Rand told us in 1956 America was finished our Revival is over we're pulling one here and one there one here I said but he didn't say that about the Philippines I said you got these islands that nobody knows about the message of the hour I said you need to get there now before the other people get there all right and forward the true Gospel of God but I I want to thank thank you again for giving me the opportunity to go it was a it was a burden that I've been wanting to do for a while and and brother Dale gave me the opportunity to go and I would love to go back but not right now but uh let's just see what God done let's pray for the ones that needed the baby let's pray for the little boy that that had the thing on his throat let's just continue to pray for the people there and pray for the preachers to forward the gospel to get the gospel out to the people and I think they're doing a good job or I wouldn't say that I think they're doing a real good job of forwarding the gospel to their people but you remember one thing for sure when you're having a bad day pull that back up and watch it right you take a man that was in a dean of a bible school he had a salary he had a house he had a church well I mean the church was there in the in the place where he was teaching and sister Gail he accepted the message told him about the message and they kicked him out right so he has no salary no place to stay nothing so he goes out here and somebody's got a piece of land he said here you here's your piece of land so he built him a house and built him a church out of nothing but bamboo and you know what he's just as happy he's probably more happy that God that's what that brother um uh mahum said he said I'm more happy now even though I've been kicked out he said because I know I'm in the truth amen he said I was in error for 45 years in the Baptist Church 45 years he was a pastor there preaching what he knew preaching what he knew but when he come to the light of the hour he said this is it this is it there's nothing else like it this is it let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you very much for even having opportunity to speak to your people Lord I pray that you just bless us now and take care of us as we go to never forget Lord where we come from and never forget where we're striving to go to we pray for the people there in the Philippines that you would bless them Lord you already have we ask you to bless them again continually give them fruit for their labor lord they're looking for Souls Lord not money not a claim they're not looking for for Fortune they're not looking for a big name they're just looking for that next soul and I pray Lord that you'd give them fruit for their labor Lord give us fruit for our labor here too Lord that you'll bless us all be with us take care of us Lord bless the church father as it's growing Lord we pray that you'd give us the opportunity to as we're talking about helping others Lord
