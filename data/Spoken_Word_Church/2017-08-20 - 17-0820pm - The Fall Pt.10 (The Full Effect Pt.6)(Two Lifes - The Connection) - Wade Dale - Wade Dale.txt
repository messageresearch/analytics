TRANSCRIPT
========================================
y'all wanna sit down for a minute please if you don't mind I try to make it as quick as I can but it's come to our attention that there's a couple people that Gavin I know that are struggling with depression and it's a spirit that she and I both dealt with when we were teenagers back before we met before we knew one another and so I want to testify to help those folks and let y'all know that we're standing here with you and fighting the battle but it's ultimately your demon to overcome if you're struggling with depression and it's not just for those that we know of it's also for these teenagers because I know that teenagers are very susceptible to that spirit and if you haven't faced it already you likely will someday lust and depression those things the devil tends to attack especially young people with so let me tell you how overcame I testified at the Alabama camp a 2006 don't know if I ever testified here but at any rate I went through it during the age from 17 to 21 and especially in the latter part of that the last few months was a very tough I thought about suicide often and it didn't even seem like suicide would do justice to and I was like job I curse the day that I was even conceived I wish I'd never been born that's how bad off I was but there's different reasons that people go through depression lots of different I call them triggers and for Gabby it was because she was an orphan girl from age 8 to age 16 she was sort of what you call downtrodden outcast every home that took her in as a foster kid they eventually kicked her out and she always just wanted a family that's what she begged called for she cried she she wasn't a Christian but she believed in God and she asked God for a family and ultimately age 15 she saw she probably going to get adopted so she started trying to kill herself and she was very very upset very depressed well the Lord heard of prayer and gave her a family and they adopted her message believed in family so they introduced her to the message she came to know Christ she gave her heart to the Lord and believed the message and it all took away the depression and now she has family and Kentucky family here also Church family here in church family Kentucky so I gave her the desirable heart it's got family all around and no depression she's been free from depression for years and so if I so we're a testimony that you can live without depression okay you won't have it the rest of your life if you'll just fight it part of the reason that you succumb to that spirit is because you don't resist it okay if you embrace that spirit lust or depression anything the devil tempts you with when you embrace it in other words you dwell on the thought it will you know you will succumb to that spirit you resist the devil not once but constantly you never stop resisting the devil okay it's not just a one-time thing then it's over with it's an overcoming just like Christianity itself is not a one-time decision this is a whole life long everyday you decided I'm going to do right every single day I'm going to resist the devil and I'll show you how I did that what depression is if you don't know it's an oppressive spirit this is an own definition for my experience an impressive spirit that causes one to lose your drive or your motivation your desire you don't want to get up in the morning you don't want to go to bed at night but I'm going to go to work you don't wanna go to church you don't want to go to school you don't wanna do anything nothing makes sense there's just no purpose and you don't feel useful to anybody that was to me what depression was here's some of the lies the devil told me he said Ron you're not a Christian you must not be because you're struggling with the pressure I count brother branham as a Christian brother branham wanted to kill himself he tried a couple times and I believe I read a message the other day where he had an oppressive spirit come on him every 7 years in his life I don't know if y'all remember that some nervousness or something whatever it was if you're struggling with depression it don't mean you're abnormal it don't mean that there's something wrong with you it doesn't mean you're not a Christian you just keep pressing the battle and don't stop never stop but they'll always tells us you know don't don't give up don't don't sit down don't stop don't what you call plateau you just keep going I mean what do you think you're born again or not you just keep pressing the battle okay I never stopped that's been my theme for 20 years as a Christian is never stop and also Jesus was tempted to cast himself down devil took him up to a pinnacle of a high place told him cast yourself down so order sounds like suicide but anyway God himself and flesh was being tempted you know when he faced things that we would face - and then the only difference between a Christian a depressed Christian and a depressed Center is that the Christian has hope and as a sinner if a sinner struggle with depression I say get Jesus that beast everyone you know good case of salvation but the Christian has hope and your hope is the Word of God Jesus overcame by the Word of God and so do we every temptation he faced he found a scripture that was in opposition to that spirit and he withheld that was resisting the devil okay and I'll show you scriptures y'all go and put the scriptures up there please you may not have a lot of word reveal to you but your hope is the Word of God you find some promise in the Bible and hold on to that and you don't you can't do that if you don't read the Bible every day read the Bible and pray every single day never forsake the assembling ourselves together being fellowship read listen to sermons read sermons and you don't feel like doing that if you're depressed but I set and read through my crocodile tears having a lousy lousy whew woe is me time I sit there with tears streaming down my face read my Bible and pray and Satan saying why are you doing that I'd say well I don't know but I'm going to keep doing it anyway I'm not stopping I faced a lust Eamon I'm not going to know the details of that but you know during the time I was facing a lust Eamon I'd turn around read my Bible and pray and you say we're on your hypocrite might have been but I didn't stop you no you just don't ever stop here's a couple of scriptures this one I came across the other day this is not one that I use that I think it would be useful proverbs 10:22 the hope of the righteous shall be gladness that's your hope gladness not depression be glad next scripture please this is one of the ones that I use fun you can find many times in the Bible where it says rejoice this today was water made let's rejoice and be glad in it next one right rejoice evermore next okay Philippians 4:8 this is not what I count be my new birth scripture but it's finally breathing you've heard the scripture what certain things are true and you read through all those things to think on these things okay next one this is what so the bowel tells us what to think about likewise it says what not to think about casting down imaginations every high thing that is all self against now for God in captivity every thought to there be a surprise depression is not in obedience to Christ those thoughts you cast down you think on these things and then I'm thunder just be as quick as I can perseverance y'all remember brother Branham preached about perseverance listen that sermon read it look up the word tenacity I just recently look that word up to take a hold of something and grab it and hold it with all your might and never let go tenacity okay perseverance those two go hand in hand that's what a Christian has to be to overcome a Christian soldier okay if you don't reason why you do or die every day you read the Word of God and pray or if you feel like it or not and then of course just good old-fashioned patience you wait on God because this took years I went through this spirit for years okay and kept reading my Bible and praying every day and crying and wanting to die alright scroll down I think there might be one more scripture I don't recall I guess that's it so my deliverance came after years of the struggling my deliverance station became one day in 2006 I was praying and just really fed up sick and tired of being sick and tired I went as I often did just through myself before the Lord threw myself on my floor of my bedroom and cried to God he finally spoke to me and he said you speak so I got up and I turned my prayer to the devil and I said Satan leave and that was when I was lifted from me and it's never been back then and then there was one of the voices that I heard there in that prayer and I can't explain this but it sounded like not one but multiple demons that I could hear within me crying and screaming it's ever been cast down in fear it was very real and I've never been depressed since well here with y'all we're praying with praying with y'all okay man you stand I guess we can just pray now and be dismissed we just got a good sermon for Israel a man remember Susan gave one from this morning that her sister Linda which had to surgery she's at home now so doing well we think of work for that and she's thanking everyone for her prayer so remember there her brother

your greetings hasn't seen brother caught in the wild couple years so we going to have a lot of time to get caught up still going to spend a few a few days of R&R and then when we get back we're going to hit the ground running with our all that bee stuff that we're doing and all that so just keep saying your prayers if you got your Bibles turn to the book of acts 2 verse 1 and we're going to continue we may we may finish our thought we've been on the fall part 10 the full effect we've been talking about two lights but now we're going to look at the connection last Sunday we talked about the inheritance and we'll kind of back up a little bit on that inheritance but there's got to be a connection from what God had his mind from what the thoughts that he had there had to be a connection of and we know God's thoughts are real but there had to be something come into this dimension because this is where man fell man didn't man did not fall in heaven man fell on earth now Satan fell in heaven but where he fall down - he fall down to the earth okay so everything kind of happens down here like I've always said there's there's no redemption in heaven you don't need redemption in heaven you need redemption on earth man because remember God never fell nothing eternal ever fell and man nothing how can you have something an eternity in it fall no it can't fall what fell was we'll talk about the carnality we talked about a little bit this morning of man stir but acts 2 verse 1 and we're going to this is where we're going to bring the connection in because we know we were in the thoughts of God we're going to talk about that today we know that we were in the eternal section but there had to be a day that it come to a reality on earth the connection between what God said and what God saw - what now you and I are a witness on this earth and man we're a walking witness of God on the earth but there had to come a time when that had to happen that inheritance had to be fulfilled in the hearts of man all right so let's bow our heads and get started your heavenly Father would pray that you'd bless us today be with us take care of us today and you be Lord the one that does the speaking you be the one that does the hearing father you be the one that takes over this vessel takes over all these vessels in this room father and you be the one that reveals you'd be the one Lord that gives us Lord as many times we we hear the Prophet says if you've got questions then God's got the answer we we know that you're you're not a heavenly father that we ask for bread and you give a stones or we ask for fish and you give us something else Lord we know that you give us the desire of our heart if it's toward you father we pray now that all of our thoughts for the next a little time would upon you and it would be upon you word which you and the word are the same and be with Lord us as we take this time of fellowship that we can take our little licks of fire and bring them together Lord and be a burning light for you forgive us of our sins be with the ones that are sick be the ones that are not with us today we was the ones Lord on this wall right below my feet in a Sunday School class Lord Li times getting short saved those children save those parents save those spouses all the ones Lord that are on that list downstairs father we we run through our mind of the different ones often and we miss them in Lord we desire their fellowship but we desire more than anything is for them to have fellowship with you just Lord we ask you to be with the ones on the foreign fields take care of them give them fruit for their labor bless us and lead us guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name Amen acts 2 verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost now remember Jesus breathed on them days was before that before he went to Calvary he breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now why didn't they receive it then and why was that whatever that seed was quick and it wasn't time for it and number one thing is Jesus had it in himself but he knew what was coming he knew that he would release that life fifty days later on the day of Pentecost and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance she may be seated in the Lord at his blessing of the reading of the word Bob if you would grab me up some water Louie for somebody done there now we're going to read in Ephesians brother Dale read part of it today but we we want to now look at action and try to get into this to life part and get through it and get into the connection of us going back to where we came from commands out all right no beer sleepy crowd today because I come and talk to you a man Ephesians 1 verse 4 let's read this brother Dale ready this morning according if he have chosen us in him now remember as he said this morning we were not chosen by him we were chosen in him all right before the foundation of the world so one other were the chose that choosing was done was in him all right before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love what having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself now remember we told you about last Sunday word and we'll read it again where the prophet of God told us that Jesus didn't come to bring you an inheritance Jesus didn't come down here and develop an inheritance for you to receive a man alright to me that clears up a lot because watch this having three days predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and what is his will his will is his word and then we come to the reading of the will today we have opened up the will book and the will is telling us exactly what our inheritance is not going to be it's what it already is and then to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved hey you like that I like that I like that but I want to go back down to one more go back to number four I missed one right here my notes look right here Courtney act shows enough in him for the foundation in the world that we should be what holy and what without blame oh my goodness thankfully without blame done deal done deal done deal he sees us holy i I got a I got a quote I'm going to hold for maybe another sermon but brother Brian remember God doesn't see your sin if God ever sees one speck of sin he must destroy you he cannot sit and look at sin that's what we're going to talk about today and when you look at when we look at foreknowledge and we look at predestination you have to add sin into that picked up something Wednesday night it will pay attention we might be getting something but we're reading in just a minute all right having predestinated up until the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will which is this word he loves his word because that's who he is because the praise of the glory of His grace because we don't have any wearing he has made us accepted in the beloved so we've been accepted it's done it's finished finish work in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins now look we have redemption through his blood but that's not our inheritance being developed that's getting us back to our inheritance by the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace everybody got that same an his blood down here on the earth did not bring us an inheritance it cleaned us up to get us back to our inheritance amen that's why everything's got to go through the blood Abraham give his wife away twice lastik God to us a failure but when Paul looks back through the cross and through the blood he says staggered not now look Paul was a liar if he didn't look back through and see something we didn't see come he wrote it in the eternal Word of God he said staggered not at the promise of God but we look over here in the Old Testament and it looks like he stumbled Sagat all over everything but finally abraham being the father of our faith said God I can't do it right I'm going to have to believe in what you said and God said that's what I would have thought that's what I wanted you to save when this journey started you know same thing with you and I when we come to the end of this thing God's going to say I register one thing one time where you know God's got never going to ask you why it took you so long to come to him he knew how long so all he does it says enter into the joy of the Lord before that I had I had this for you before the foundation of the world you just come what God came down in human flesh and what opened up the way for us to get back and then all right so it's pretty simple in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace now remember if you're born again you cannot sin amen because the seed remains in you and you cannot send a man wherein he has abounded toward us and all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will that's what he's doing now and then he's making known to us the mystery of the will that he wrote before the foundation of the world all right remember God's thoughts are eternal he never developed a new one never developed a new thought mine what a what a god I was thinking the other day you're exactly right I was thinking the other day one person created all this one person it didn't take a committee it didn't take an army it didn't take four billion nights at one guy every bit of this came from one person amen you did this having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself remember that people that is the unconditional covenant I'm going to do it right you can't and you know what God says I know you can't that's why I'm going to do it right he purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times in other words here now the the last two thousand years we come to a place that we got to know these things that he might gather together in one all things in Christ not in two not in three in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him so in other words heaven and earth has come together I'm gonna tell you something one thing's for sure like brother Dale said I'm not wanting to go to heaven heaven to me where you are is where heaven is and that where you are you mean Walmart or among all the tattoo artists and awful the all the half-naked well not even half naked now they're more than half negative two-thirds naked people and you're a walking that's why is it that we are a mystery in ourselves right it's like Bob didn't know what's gonna say this but they were back there talking about being in the world don't you know don't be take the things of the world what you have to be careful with that you got to remember that we're in this world but not on this world we are so different and what is helping us now is though is we've got all these other buffers like denominations and other things but one day you and I the cream of the crop is going to rise to the top and we're going to be so much different so they're going to persecute you just like they persecuted Jesus hey man we'll know then who's in him and who's not like Roseanne you and I were talking about you know you you keep you home you don't own your home you're on your home now right you don't listen you own nothing nothing I tell you why you say this is a free country go try to build a building out and just still try to build a building in your yard if the code says you can't guess what you can't amen is that free no we've lost all my freedom the only freedom we have is what right here in Christ and then in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own word we'll all right that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ and whom ye also trusted after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after you I don't see how people can read this and think we came here with anything this this tells after after we heard the word you can't get you can't get a word birth without listening and hearing the word first and then the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed Peter I mean Paul came to a group of people that were teaching Jesus was the Christ that's pretty good revelation especially back then they didn't have a book in internet and quote they were just preaching that Jesus was the Christ and Paul perceived one thing they didn't have the holyoke right he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe a man and hear what they say their doctrine had been that we don't know this what is it we come by a Holy Ghost that was the house of Cornelius I believe what he said what a stout man beautiful wonderful man teaching Jesus was the Christ didn't have the baptism of the Holy but boy I believe after he got it he was like a house on fire on a windy day it changed that man all right same way with you and I then I'm also after that you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of your inheritance we're going to talk about that a little while but hold this right here which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession until the praise of his glory so your whole your body is not redeemed yet we know that rather they'll cover that this morning just look in the mirror but the earnest of our inheritance in other words we have an inheritance and then we have an inheritance that is signed sealed and delivered and even the way to get back to it has been delivered to us 2,000 years ago how slow are we God came himself preached three and a half years we killed him but we're done with you say we yeah we did I put him on the cross did you okay alright and now it took us two thousand years what that in a dispensation of the fullness of time when we get all the church ages done I was thinking the other day if you did make a checklist of what was coming and what's already gone we're right into coming because there's not a lot more to be done except what's already being done ma'am and we come up now and we see this Eclipse tomorrow and now they're talking about September the 23rd is it something where the Virgo which is the Virgin has 12 stars above our head and I don't get into that stuff much brother Ryan sent me that so I watched it but September 23rd supposed to be the rapture this year well you know what usually usually usually when you say rapture or when you say that that's not going to happen because if the whole world's going to know it then then it's not like a coming as a thief in the night so so it's not going to come honest I promise you it won't come on September 23rd 2017 I'll promise you why because everybody knows already but listen let's not just throw that in the trash because remember God wrote his first Bible in the heavens he wrote his first Bible in the stars and we see these things happening I told them downstairs this morning I said look signs follow what the believers are doing believers don't follow the signs that are happening whatever is happening in the stars because I just read you here that heaven and earth and come together whatever happens up there I'll promise you something's happening to the bride right amen so we've got now September I'm thinking about this September 2017 which is getting close and - and it is a significant thing because if you'll remember when I did the thing on Daniel 70 weeks there's three fall feasts that have to be concluded before Jesus comes he he in other words what was it of first fruit anyway there was four it's kind of funny when you preach all this and then you kind of forget it all but he the first for feast he has concluded all those Pentecost firstfruits and all those things there's three left Tabernacle peace of the trumpets and peace of atonement all right which are fall feasts their feast during the harvest time in September September and October that's the harvest time so we see these things happening and brother Daniel now we're talking the other day and he sent me a link where they're now predicting that next October which is 2018 there will be a huge financial crash huge look at the stock market now it's at 20,000 it was at 9,000 just several years ago hey listen this is not a crash that's not a crash but if you take this and put it in top of that 40-foot tree and you drop it down that's the crash so it's got to get good before it gets worse so here we are 2018 we're heading toward 2019 we get in close something is getting ready to happen God's going to show it in the sky but he's not only showing it in the sky listen you and I it's where it's got to show first because those signs will follow what the believers are already doing I was thinking of the day brother man said what God does it he reveals it and then he makes it manifest so once we get to the manifestation part we're already two parts behind that's how God does things that's what he said but let's get back to the let's get back to what we're talking about today Hebrews 9 verse 11 let's read these scriptures and get them over with because I want to touch on something here in just a minute Hebrews 9:11 we read it last Sunday we're going to read it again but Christ being a high priests of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building all right neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in in one into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us all right for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled in clean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh because remember and watch what happened my heaven because you not see the the the part of this is being fulfilled with all these people coming in from overseas that that that maybe has never heard what we're preaching here and then come in and read the base scriptures bring the same thing in we've been talking about bringing everything together brother land land coming in with the son of man and and did you hear brother Brady last Sunday yeah that was good but he made a statement it was very profound he said that lamb now see we talking about we've been talking about downstairs you know there's a justification that we we go through in what we call baby form justification where you did do what you did you remember that and then but then you were justified and you chopped off your past sense right but now remember if you listen to what brother Brady said last Sunday he says that lamb that lamb was not justified like that that lamb didn't spin and then all of a sudden God forgive him that lamb never sinned in the first place hey man boy I got excited I don't have to get up and shout I can get excited inside amen but he said that lamb never did it there was no sin in that lamb now if there's no sin in the natural lamb what about the Lamb of God that came and gave His life that we can look back and not just say what we did this but now we don't do that anymore the real one we're talking about now never get it in the first place amen who can charge glovesy last who can make a list no one what my Teegarden sir how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God raise it up and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament they meant the first Testament that was the Old Testament that was under bulls and goats right we already been through this I'm just kind of back writing for the ones that wasn't here a couple weeks ago because remember for a testament to be in force there had to be a death of a testator right all right so let's read that continues for this call he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first Testament that they they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance now the Old Testament never received the eternal inheritance because they had to lose back to that substitute blood that lambs blood and then that was the first Testament and they're there their sins were not done away with they were just pushed to Calvary and then so now but look but you see the one that comes that was a testator came right for where a testament is there must also necessity be the death of the testator a man comes remember like we've already said before what's the first book of the New Testament not Matthew not mark not Luke not John the tech tater still alive but after the death of the testator a New Testament is enforced that's what happened next to verse one the eye is your beginning of the New Testament Jesus said this is the New Testament in my blood and then for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth Jesus didn't save one person he did not fill any one with the Holy Ghost while he was here being Almighty like he breathed on them and said receive the Holy Ghost sure but it was what it was a promise but until that book of Acts when that Holy Ghost came and would come from one dimension into another dimension that's when the promise started to be fulfilled and then where our testament is of force after men are dead otherwise is of no strength at all while the testator liveth all right let's go now to the quote that we use last Sunday and adoption 1960 inheritance by predestination excuse me I inherited something what inheritance there had to be somebody leave me and inheritance why you say Jesus left you an inheritance beg your pardon jesus never left you an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance all of that pay for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance but your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first before predestination before foreknowledge your inheritance was first listen what's the first thing you think of first thing I don't think of this kids when so much how's your family I said well Brad's large they're all good what's not my family they say how's your family josh is doing good Hanna's doing fine damn it's doing well you know what that's the first thing comes you mind right your family's the first thing come to your mind I love other people's family but my family comes first and then Jesus only come a lot here's the way they try to make it God said well there's a lot of people all I don't want them and then says he want in other words he wanted to be safe so I'll send Jesus down and perhaps maybe someday feel sorry and you know what I've done and get saved oh mercy I wouldn't run my office like that even as poor as I do I wouldn't do it like that God by his foreknowledge seeing exactly who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved he sent Jesus to save those that he had already chosen didn't Paul say five verses behind it that he chose us in him before there even was a world that's our heritage God chose us and let Jesus come and pay the price the what his shedding of his blood that no sin would be one read it with me accounted to us nothing you do came n nothing you do make a list you know I did this I did that this is I did that I did like I told you before you know you you say God I really you drive by an old place you should do something wrong or drive by an old beer joint and say but God forgive me for even going in that place and he's like you've been in there you've been in there I don't remember that I'm looking at your inheritance I'm looking at before the foundation of the world all you thought about was me now let's look at this word attribute but if we had an inheritance now surely we give each person inheritance if we have enough but all of our inheritance most of the time goes to what family and then all eventually if I'm going to die to give you that inheritance it's going to go to my family and that's not going to The Devil's kids Jesus died for everybody but he died for his kids mm-hmm when he was on the cross I was on his mind I think another day when that stinking nail went through the palm of his hand didn't the Bible say we were engraved in the palm of his hand sister Jeanne it went right through my name it went right through my name because if I'm imprinted in the palm of his hand that when he hung on that cross that nail went right through my name he said I died for him but look the word attribute brother Dale has been using the word attribute so let's kind of break it down a little bit don't read down here now you're going to read them that's your needs that'll work isn't done them thank you kind of like a lawyer saying strike that yeah right how can you strike that the Lord attribute means a quality or feature regarded as a characteristic now look weird that word inherit come from that word inherit comes from inheritance right some of you can't see raise it up raise it up a little bit because some of them are straining in the back it's a quality or feature regarded as the characteristic or inherent part of someone or something all right the attribute is like brother Dale said they do all then publish boys walk just like brother Kong and if you give Dale few more years he'll do some time but here are some synonyms that go with it watch this quality characteristic trait feature element aspect property sign hallmark our mark now look it's an inherent part of someone I only receive inheritance from my natural father because I came from him you're only going to receive an inheritance for God if you come from him and then but now listen here we are with these words that we sometimes we I asked for Lewis this and he he kind of he got it right but now raise it all the way up to the top I want you to think about this for a man are we an attribute of God are we the attribute of God because an attribute of God hold on just a minute we'll see come on we're Satan come from he comes from God he was an attribute and attribute of God but I'm gonna promise you one thing the attribute comes straight from that part of God's mind that's eternal amen it's DIAC we are not an attribute we are the attribute of God God made manifest in another form listen an attribute of God is healer we're not going to need that all the time glorified body doesn't need healing I don't need Reese al vation if i'm saved i'm saved i don't and you say well you don't need a savior yes i need a savior but i'm not going to need that savior what's I'm saved how am I going to need it No so you see an attribute of God could be many things but the attribute of God the form that comes down that attribute comes from that back part that's what I was looking at Wednesday night and it's probably going to get onto some of his sermon but look for knowledge I put for knowledge includes and I left it blank because foreknowledge includes sin but that back part of God mind never knew sin so you take for knowledge for knowledge as God's seeing what was going to happen right but now the attribute of God is one doing the scene you guys have passed for knowledge back before for knowledge for knowledge includes what you do down here is a center amen but the back part when when the prophet of God said let's go in the back part what the intelligence of God the back part knew no sin the children of God are the inherent part of the eternal amen because what an attribute means what an inherent part of a person I look the way I look because I inherited my traits from my father and mother and as a Christian if we don't want like God we always talk about walking like Tom publish well let's talk about all could want me like God because he's your real daddy so that's the attribute the attribute is the one that created everything that we see the reason the attribute is worth that is because it developed an attribute you have to think of that for a little while because why do we need for knowledge and why do we need predestination if we never fell hello why do we need all that we don't but God knowing we would fall these attributes developed after God already had a group of people in his mind that was listen that 1:26 men never fell you'll get that one of these days and when you get born again that part never fell that part never sinned so it had to come from the back part of God's mind but it had to go to foreknowledge it had to go into predestination because remember predestination is pre determined destiny why is it a predetermined destiny because God saw it happen that's pretty simple God and simplicity amen but an attribute no let's get closer I thinking the other day you know we've done a lot of things through the message but this to me is we've been we've been writing with a dull pencil it's time to sharpen the pencil it's time to get where the focus is not so fuzzy it's time to get to where we can see things you know we were talking to the people that the Sasquatch people are the Bigfoot people and old Tony Smallwood he says wise all those pictures always blurry why wouldn't I think Tony's asking why are these pictures always blurry because they're not real and I think we've been looking at some blurry pictures in our life and then our denominational ideas and then our carnal mind but when we become focused on one thing and that's getting rid of the carnal mind showing that if we are the attribute of God then we are God walking on the earth we are God breathing on the earth we are God acting on the earth amen because an attribute could mean something else but the attribute is D person that's the person in a mini membered form that God had before there was ever you'll get this one of these days this Bible was written to get you here and get you out of here hey man because that's what that well done he gave you an inheritance it told you about your inheritance that there was before it was even written the reason God wrote that Bible is because he saw the inheritance of a group of people eternal because remember God has known you thought his thoughts are eternal let's read that summary in Church a I pull this one up just this morning cuz it kind of struck me him just watch carefully now and see this let the Prophet explain it before there was ever expect a starter before God was God right wake up before God was God God is an object later' ation and no one was there to worship him so he was at that time only potentially God but we were there we're not developing after this right I love that and he was all known only as Eternal Spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about these thoughts of God they are eternal are they not so now if his thoughts are eternal this part of his talks now not everything he was thinking not everything he was thinking is eternal a man called you thought of Judas he thought of all the sin of the world he saw thought of all these things but he's talking about right here the bride was already in his mind they are eternal are they not the eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God eternal if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his ability so therefore he has gone must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself what do you think about that there's nobody to ask they still might ask well you mean that there's one garden he's asking a bunch of people no one God right what about what about a thought you know we we think things all the time and they don't come to pass like 950 out of 950 but everything God thinks of comes to pass and if we're a part of that thought we're gonna get here in a minute he is omniscient that he is not now learning or he taking counsel even for himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge in other words he's not going to come up to the end ago oh I forgot 10 people I'll - oh no done finished settled done because we remember if he has to add more people he's got to add to this he's got to add to this if he adds more people if he takes away he's got to take away this is it if he can add to his knowledge than he is not omniscient the best we could say is that sometimes he will be but that is not scripted right he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he has got thus the thoughts of God are eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up in which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are all ready real and eternal and part of God now he's knocked off by the whole world he's not known about everything that he thought about he saying he thought about his bride he's talking about you and I know watch continues see how this works God always had his thoughts for Adam Adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed Thoms 139 15 we'll give you a little idea this my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lost parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book were all my members written which in continuance in other words as they come which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them Jacob Esau already had saw that before they got here Jeremiah in your womb I knew what you'd be that as I said was not written about Adam but it gives you the idea and knowledge that the thought was there in his mind and that thought was eternal and had to be expressed so when item was formed to the dust of the earth and his spiritual being created by God then Adam became God's spot expressed and those eternal thoughts were now manifested down to the centuries we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah John the Baptist each one of these were God's eternal thought expressed in its season then we come to Jesus the logo he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word John 1 in the beginning was word word God what was done all right that is what he is and forever will be and I thought we were in him I thought we were in him ok so whatever speaks to him speak to us and then now it says that he has chosen us in him what we tell my sons this morning before the foundation world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world this is the part I want you to see that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that amen that's how listens that's how you and I can exist in this life because we have an eternal quality that no one else has I'm saying no one else has we came from God and we're going back to God amen if you never were in God you're not going back to God because what do you got to go back to Amen you not got well like that Jesus is going up wine on this one or - no he's got it all it's done it's finished what our problem is is we got separated from it amen I tell them this morning I'll tell you our carnal mind is what's killing us you and I I know there's children here but they're going to learn sometimes you and I came from a carnal sex act between your mom and your daddy I don't care if it with your physical mom and daddy but it was a man and a woman got together had a carnal thought and had you they in a person I think about that the other day was walking somewhere and I said I ain't a person any different than me we're all born the same way we come from the same place by the same act and that's our problem that was act was not supposed to happen but he did because the natre beauty of God had to be displayed called Savior healer Redeemer all those great words that we look at how to come forth because it was already anything but who made them come out who made them come out the devil's kit huh who did then did you do that yeah you did you did you made it go say no not the devil's kid you made it come out you made that happen cuz he knew we were going to get lost so we had to make a way to get us back amen but he knew where you came from he'll not lose the one because it stalks return and in the continuance of us being born we were all born in sin all shape is iniquity I can't understand why people in this message think we were born so much special name by hell we were born in a hospital or a woodpile or a woodshed or turn we always born at home but we were all going to same identical way and that is not the way that God wanted us to come right so we all start the same place there is not your even Bill Gates was born the same way you were huh so how much more better is he than you you just got the money the inspection to leave is a pocket right didn't have it you don't know what you love just enough money to get by and that's all I want amen bill no treasure here but think about this the reason God every move that God made was because you I've told you before makinia one more time this Bible was not written for the world it was not written for anyone but the children of God that's the only way you're going to develop that's the only thing you're going to eat and it tells you where yet and where you go and tells you where you came from who needs a GPF we've got God's predestinated seed that's the only GPS I need and you know what it finds itself all the time there is no recalculating and God I've heard that enough hand you heard that recalculating no this other right we were somewhere one time with Terrence and Emily it told us to get out walk didn't not Lisa is it get out walk in other words you can't get there from where you're at you had to park you walk where you were going I never heard that before but God doesn't say that he knows exactly the whole thing coming right down you know what we're doing that is pretty funny innit but not in God you hadn't docked God he didn't lead you off over there and have sin recalculating or back up or 300 feet you you missed it we had a TomTom one time when I was working for Terrance and I call it a dum-dum instead of a TomTom sorry TomTom but Garmin is better but at TomTom you'd be back you'd be about thirty feet behind already past the road you supposed to turn and says turn right you'd be that you'd be thirty feet this away you know that's not with God God knew wherever seed would land and I understand what brother Brown said he said you know he said the the the virgin birth is not so mysterious God created one seed right one ovum puts it in Mary it forms a baby you and I get in here you and I get in here is a mystery but thank God for a prophet that said God bred this one to this one this one to this one and this one to this one just to get you here you know why because you had to be here you were part of his mind you were part of what he always wanted hey it's not a lot of mystery all this is going on that's why you know the property God preached his greatest sermons but he preached Garlin simplicity first God hiding himself in simplicity all right let's continue here just for a second if that's all right we're still going to get to that last quote but we'll try all right questions and answers on Hebrews watch we read this last Sunday more read again because this makes you very important I tell you what let's skip it down to the next one questions in that so let's go to the number two right there now in other words I want you to look now we're talking like the thoughts of God we're talking like the attribute of God all right we're selling the attribute and the thoughts of God the thoughts of you all right and other words when you became a young man or a young woman like God takes a picture of you now no matter how old and wrinkled how disfigured whatever it will be that will wind right on down through and that body may be destroyed disfigured burnt ate up by lines whatever it is but it was made up of gases 16 elements of the earth that was calcium potash petroleum talked about this cosmic light and so forth all goes together to make up the body now no matter what the whole earth is filled with that but I look keep going look but now this picture is the main thing then in the resurrection those gases of acids and things comes right back into the place and develops this picture again now this picture was not taken when you were 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your best in other words it wasn't taken down here as a photo of you at that age God didn't come down into this dimension and go when I send EOS up when you're 16 years old click no because remember many times some of you did wasn't serving the Lord you had short hair you had makeup on you had all these different things that's nobody took a picture but now look when was it taken before there was a foundation of the world it was put in God's great file where is God's great files he got to go look through and pull this one out and write where just great file that's why I listen we are so preserved in God when he saw that picture that was before everything that's his kids he takes that picture it puts it in that file and the only thing it did was feature itself here for you to make your choice you saw it sounds like we can't make a choice it's because of your choice it's because of your choice see then you become a servant of God him for knowing it makes him a redeemer as we've been through then that picture is absolutely this is the neck the negative part of life is where you're living now and anything if there's a negative there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative therefore if this is a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere and this ain't the real thing this is only a foreshadow of the real thing that is to come now you get it because look this is not the real thing the real thing is the part inside of us that we can't see the real thing it but but where did it come from where did it come from where'd it come preacher not you where do you come from where did it come from it comes from the mind of God it came straight from the mind of God listen there's no wavering and eternal you know it's like well no it's eternal it's constant that's the only thing in your life this constant is your new birth that new birth is the most caught that's your capos that's what you go back to sure we have problems in the world sure we have problems with life sure with but you got to go back to that compost God said Who I am man didn't tell me who I was God told me who I was so I don't care what they do with you they cannot destroy that profile why because God has known you thought the thought he had is that and then whose is that alright say man they cannot destroy that profile they who people in the world people that tell you things up preacher they cannot destroy that profile that picture in God's great gallery up there it cannot destroy it's in heaven you burn it up feed it to the lines do it any way you want to it will come forth again just as sure as two and two is four gets insurance God spoke it it will come forth so no matter where you are no matter where you are can't destroy it man's tried to destroy it with doctrine man's tried to destroy it with you ain't there sand you ain't that or you're this and you're that but when we come back to God's Word that's what I was telling downstairs we had a prophet coming the end time now he didn't bring us something different he didn't write an extra Bible he said those seven thunders would be what would be what's revealed in the field not another book not another something coming if he was a word prophet he had to be in the word and those thunders has to be in that word amen so the seven thunders are what contained in those sealed now called them it's downstairs and we'll get into this maybe when we get back from from Oklahoma there's only one thing that now is constant brother Brown said one time and one time only he said hold that word Redemption the whole Bible the whole Bible is Redemption he said well if this is Redemption to get us back to God we had to have this will we had to have his word to get us back to God right we had to have that so like I said that's what's constant Redemption you know and I'm sorry to say this but Bobby Lewis and him go outside and start talking to other people about what we talked about here and they look at you like what world are you wrong so the Daniels been through it too but there's people this message cannot see that the seven seals is a book of redemption being rude to be home they think must be this the book of the devil because they think that's what it does is revealed the devil there is no book of revealing the devil there's a book of redemption that exposes the devil tells you of his tactics tells you what he's going to do but it tells you what God's already done for you and it won't change God won't say no let's try something different now it's there resist the devil he'll flee from you that's pretty rough you love the Lord everybody this is getting good and good or the pencils getting sharp but remember I mean we spent all these time always timing on preaching on Redemption and getting us back and and then you got people in the message that well brother Brian I'm open seals in 1963 and I said that's just it the greatest message ever preaching is entire life and that's it well why didn't we take a rat trawler I thought that's what we're waiting on it's a revelation contained in those seals that will give us rights ring faith well there's no one who the devil is going to give addressing but no but knowing where we come from knowing what we're doing here and knowing where we're going that's going to show us that GPS is going to go off you're here final destination has been reached and then final destination has been reached give me about ten more men who is this mill Cassady we're going to get to this now let's read this I want to break it down for you a little bit we're talking about the connection all right then all right now watch what's going on here this is 1965 this is after the seals are open I want to say one more word about that because the revelation contained in those seals has to be in the Bible and like I said before like I said before this Bible is a book of what Redemption to Christians amen your body changes in that Bible and that's what we're heading to that body changes the resurrection is in that Bible we which are alive remain shall not prevent our hinder those who are sleep so right now we in the we part and the one that's going on as is in those part a man and if we pass on will go to the doze part but there's at least one person going to be in the we part we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder that's why I said I'm not looking for a Raptor Raptor cannot come until the resurrection happens first and then a body change happens next then the rapture will take place Amen that's why I believe that people number one they're lazy message people they don't study we're brother Brown open the seals beautiful a button come on people I love the Bible said study to show yourself approved study to show yourself approved amen problem is if you get lazy when we when we say while we're just sorry we'll just wait till the Prophet gets back and he'll tell us thus says the Lord if he comes back and you're not born again you have no hope redemption is over when you see that little prophet walk back among us we're done it's finished we got no more on this earth because when he walks back in that glorified body we which are alive and remain shall be changed that all right I hope it in her nobody's feelings that's just way out there there's see there's no separation in the Bible if we have a resurrection of the dead things from Paul's age all the way to right now there is no differentiation sure the last will be first and the first shall be last I believe brother around be the first one out the grave I just understood he had enough work but not too perfect you I'll promise you you're getting that right now lazy people say he's coming and going to give me something that's lazy people sorry you better have it now because I promise you Moses God shut the door Moses didn't shut the doors God shut the door and he said no more in and you know what it didn't rain for seven days with him sitting in that Ark hey man that alright alright now let's finish this up now we see the attribute now here we go back to after now we see the attribute sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the Word form body now what's he talking about this body if you're born again you already have the word form buddy hey man alright how would you want to break this down for you you have not yet entered into the word form body but at the oppening this body is subject to the word listen and earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body all right so you see what he's talking about now the difference between him and somebody Jesus Christ and you as a son see he was at the beginning the word anamorphic body he came in and lived in that in the person of Melchizedek now remember Melchizedek could not be your Savior because he was just a body formed God stepped in that body when he got finished with it he dropped it now look that's not your brother that's not your kinsman Melchizedek could not be your kinsman redeemer because Melchizedek was spoken into existence spoke out you're not spoken into existence of spoke out right you come a baby like Jesus had to come a baby so he had to be a kinsman redeemer kin to you kinsmen means kinfolk then later we never heard no more of milk hesitate because he became Jesus cry I Melchizedek was the priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that you can take your soul and put it another soul and this soul please no soul right you bypass that but now watch keep going because he became Jesus Christ no because it was a priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that because remember you did not come word for him first you weren't you weren't be Christ let me put it that the V in there you were not be Christ okay watch now you bypass that because in that form he knows all things he stood up one day and he said before Abraham was I am God no we did not not we got to that part yet but but Larry's but they're going like this I like participate but you come to a place that you bypass that he knew all things he said God give us what in other words with the Saints there wha John 17 the prayer that God that Jesus prayed let us have what in other words communion like before the foundation of the world okay so so he knew because remember he could go back he could quote scripture because he was scripture and he he wasn't a second person he was D scripture made manifest so when he walked out he was just that word made manifest alright now you bypass that because you didn't remember you didn't walk out a mom and daddy be in the word are you did you did not and you have never been able to know that yet yet yet yet but we will right I believe we're doing it now I believe we're learning you've come like Adam like me you became from the attribute attribute to the flesh quit moving out so fast I can't read it to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we've done remember those ones across the current I'm told brother Branham said you're a great one on earth you got to go back to earth they were telling him what he was doing why because there's no carnal mind in that sixth dimension there's no carnal mind in that six dimension that's the mind of God amen then we can look back and see what we've done now we don't understand it we have never become too wordy so my good luck brother we never become the word this has never become the word right this this is Mama and Daddy they're sitting here today I'm proof where I came from now we don't understand it we have never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the word but look and clearly makes it clear you will never be the word unless you was a thought at the beginning that proves the predestination of God see you can't be the word unless you're a thought amen you had to be into thinking but you see in order to stand temptation you had to bypass the theophany you bypass that Genesis 1:26 members and then you come right over that when running the flesh then what we say brother Brown you know the your giving up you're giving a a soul by God are you giving a nature the nature is the carnal mind is telling us downstairs listen kid kids below the age of accountability are so innocent right the carnal mind has not been developed yet that's why God loves the innocence of a child and then all babies go to heaven why because they haven't had that carnal mind now when you get 12 13 14 is what I said before take a 5 year old girl and a 5 year old boy and put the bathtub they're going to play with toys and they're going to throw soaping each other and they're going to and not paint one thing about it but now you take them same to ten years later put a fifteen year old girl in the bathtub and a 15 year old boy in the bathtub you got a hole the rubber ducky goes out why what has changed right here they still got the same body parts they had when they were five it's what the carnal mind is our problem it's enmity the Bible says to God but when we take the mind of Christ and we see how all this happened we get a beautiful picture of where we come from and our purpose to be here all right look but in order to stand tense because look look the theophany of God Genesis 1:26 men one more time never fail it doesn't need redemption it is redemption sergeant wounds cream it is redemption if not it is God it's God God God and nothing but God you had to come here in flesh though to display those other attributes of the Almighty God of your father and then if you stand all the father hath given me will come to me and I'll raise him up the last day see you had to be first and then you see he comes right down the regular line from attribute before the foundation of the world his name is put on the Lamb's Book of Life how much you then from that he become the words at the offing I always talk about Jesus that could appear and disappear now you and I knew that we didn't appear and then disappear and then appear Jesus did a man then he became flesh and returned back again resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but you bypass the Genesis 1:26 man come and put that in there that Alright a man you bypass the Genesis 1:26 man and became flesh man to be tempted by sin and then if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting we have not yet the body you're not in the glorified body today hello if this is glorified body Lord give me something yes okay so give me something else I'm in a glorified body but look when wait a minute let's read this but look when this body was always eternal that's not what that said isn't it says when this body receives the Spirit of God let's mean you got to receive something that you didn't have previously before and what is it the immortal life inside of you it rose this body and subjection to God hallelujah why because all that attribute you want like God yeah you think like God but remember we're never God is one person we're now a many membered persons amen many members person not persons he this born of God does not commit sin he cannot sin Romans 8:1 there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there you are see that throws that body in subjection a body subject like you women claiming you got the Holy Ghost and going out here wearing shorts and things how could you do that how could the Spirit of God and you ever let you do such a thing it just can't be look what he said certainly it can't be he's not a filthy spirit he's a Holy Spirit man that's why I said that old nature that we leaned on we look like that we drink the beer we cut our hair we've curves we lean toward that old nature but I thought when the nature of God which is contrary to that nature that nature dies you don't do those things anymore right right the things I used to do he quoted that the other day and he made a bunch of them for y'all to put on their refrigerators the things I used to do I'd do them no more right and then when you become subject to that spirit or in other words we're talking about to life you got to be subject to this life the life that I now live Paul says I live by the faith of the Son of God it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest our quickened hallelujah may live when the Bible says don't do this that body quickly turns to it there is no question and what is it it's the earnest of your resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already what already what started it was what subject to sin and mire in corruption but now it's got the earnest it's turned heavenly now that's the earnest that you're going in the rapture if the earnest a sick person laying dying nothing left but death that's all can happen I've seen a shadow people don't eat up with cancer and tuberculosis see them people a little while after that perfectly normal and strong if there is no divine healing there is no resurrection because divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection listen you can be healed one day of cancer and died the next day of cancer but you are healed one day but I'll promise you one thing well we get a glorified body it's not going to be in corrupt one day and in corrupt annexed and corrupt one day and corrupting it no it is incorruptible for eternity you say how's that going to happen I can't figure it out because I got all this and all this it's not for you to figure though tell me how Jesus eat fish and walk through a wall you know what the earnest money is don't just a down payment he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes were healed notice how wonderful we love him now this body is subject to the spin you have not yet entered into the word form but we are still in the flesh form but subject to the word we're subject to watch inside and then death in the flesh will take us there then look when a man is born again he becomes at what spirit baby crying and then when this robe of flesh is dropped there is a he calls it a natural body there is a natural body remember this is not so this is not what it's supposed to be this is the negative we say well does this pot this is discipline that's negative this is negative there is a natural body theophany a body not made with hands neither born of a woman so look you see how the mind of Christ when it comes to you it can't bring you carnal falls it can't bring the carnal mind to you you already got the carnal mind you're trying to get rid of that and the mind of Christ when it comes there's nothing carnal about God so if you have a carnal thought you know what the hello devil because it ain't God then when a man is born again from heaven he becomes the spirit babe in Christ and then when this Robo fletcher's dropped there's a natural body theophany a body not made with hands neither born of a woman that we go to that's at Genesis 1 remember we weren't born from the born being born from a woman is our problem Jesus wasn't born from other woman it was born from daddy the father it didn't take too it took 1 that's what brother Bram said he said born through a male you live born through a woman you die amen just paraphrasing but I'm find a quote for you then that rare party returns back and picks up the glorified body that's the reason Jesus went to hell when he died and preached to the souls that were in prison he turned right back into that theophany now listen that's the oppening is what's in you if you're born to in so you've already been to hell you don't have to go twice you only went the first time and you don't have to go back again and guess what there was enough power to get you out Jesus didn't have to struggle to get out of hell he took the keys with him Satan was struggling trying to keep their doors open second Christmas table one says observe time much because all this earthly Tabernacle we have another waiting see we have bypassed that to come straight from God the attribute right there's your answer we come straight from God the attribute to be flexed to be tempted and tested by sin like Adam did but when testing of his word is over then we are taking up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word there that we skip see we didn't come by the word Jesus came exactly by the word whatever the word said that's exactly the way he came you and I remember came from minor earthly natural parents that's why Nicodemus couldn't understand he said I gotta go get back in my own mama natural know Jesus said you gotta be born from somewhere else you got to be born from above then we are taken up to this body that was prepared prepared to bless prepared for us Bob that was a wackadoo in it it is a way Louisa's lemon it is a word that we skipped to come right around down here to be tempted and tested if we to come through that there have been no temptation right amen we denote all things that's the reason Jesus knowed all things cuz he was word before he was flesh then we become the word alright keep going what numbers that's hitting them we're almost finished here we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning now once you talk about from the beginning you'll baby birth know you got the spark you got the spark when he thought of you before the foundation of the world when you started your journey now we bring it down but when he first start listen that's why I say I like that word preserve we were preserved in God why because there was a section of God the kind of way there was a section of God that's eternal just like there was an eternal section of the book of life can't be changed it be erased out can't be transferred and then Judas was in a book in the mind of God right he was in a book in the mind of God but he was not the attribute of God he was an attribute that rejected so simple rejected it turned it down trying to hold plan down and therefore he was sent to his journey but you and I being that part of God that always was eternal I still your brother Dale this morning nice thing about see brother Brown see if we have any turn there's an eternal quality to the light why because where he took our eternal people we're supposed to have eternal Falls not carnal fall but look we have eternal representation we don't have just representation remember brother Brown said to what little woman's will had representation well if she got eternal life somewhere in her journey it had to be eternal amen so your eternal representation was what that back part of God's mind while he was thinking of his children that's it it can't change right so that part come all the way down and followed you followed you all the way down right wetting in you because God went dwelling unclean vegetable don't tell me God wasn't close because you're his child and then it didn't take some woman or man to bring that birth it took the Almighty the Almighty already had that waiting on you when you got there because that eternal thought we weren't an attribute we were the attribute and if the attribute of God if that mind of God was eternal and that part of his thought was eternal then you and I are the eternal Word of God made manifest in human flesh you say how high in the world that happened Jesus was the eternal Word of God manifested in flesh he was just before you and I weren't remember we were not people but he was he was a person before he was anything he was the logos he was way back before like brother gravity wasn't God gods an object of worship he was handle him self-existing looked around and didn't need anything but those attributes once he saw them had to be developed they had to be developed because remember everything in God the eternal thoughts of God had to keep coming had to keep coming that's why he'll not lose one there will not be one extra they'll not be one extra chapter they'll not be one taken out because remember in there it tells us listen Romans 8 rather rental quota but I'm going to read it we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are a called they don't say a call Z called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and that justification is not baby for him because his own who he those who he justified he also glorified if you went through true justification you're going to go through true glorification hey man let's all stand our feet he loved the Lord he's done this for us we've just got to accept it start living it not just believe that we were a part of God no we are a eternal part of God right you know what people if you make us anything else you make us a second person you make us a second person if we're anything other than that and what is the second person brother Branham said he said if you got to one is who and one is who got on the devil that's only two people we didn't win so if you're a second person getting you're part of the devil right but if you're the first person of God he's the first person if you're the first person he told us would you sing a song will you get out of here amen you need anything Lord just come we'll pray if not listening your song god is good all the time [Applause] he put a song of brain in this heart of mine god is good Oh through the darkened night his life will shine God in good our god is good Oh
