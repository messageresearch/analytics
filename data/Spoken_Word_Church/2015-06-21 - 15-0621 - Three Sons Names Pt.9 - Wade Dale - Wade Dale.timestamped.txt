[0:00] that's all in the mind set of listening
[0:04] to the Word of God left some now let's
[0:14] go to John one now what we're doing is
[0:17] in our Sunday School class we're taking
[0:20] me and we've been it's a bit of theme
[0:24] we've had for several weeks is the
[0:29] brother Brown said God came in three
[0:32] sons name so the man's son of God is
[0:35] undated and in those dispensation it's
[0:39] really it's really it has to be a
[0:42] revelation but it has to be taught
[0:43] because the Son of God has one thing to
[0:46] do the Son of man has a purpose and the
[0:49] son of David have the perfect now we
[0:51] know we know as a fact that the son of
[0:54] david has nothing to do with us because
[0:56] we're Gentile but it still is God and we
[1:00] have to understand that he's going to be
[1:04] the son of David in the millennium and
[1:05] he's going to be to the Jews in the
[1:07] Millennium but we got to come back and
[1:10] go in like brother brownson go into the
[1:12] mind of God find out what the Sun God
[1:15] his characteristics are find out what
[1:17] the Son of Man characteristic are and
[1:19] find out what the son of David's
[1:21] characteristics are okay because in
[1:24] other words this whole to me the message
[1:26] of the hour is the is the highest
[1:30] understanding of God we could ever have
[1:32] badness have an understanding of God
[1:34] kind of costs have an understanding of
[1:36] God Luther had an understanding of God
[1:38] which they have an understanding God but
[1:39] when the Prophet came this is the Eagle
[1:42] age it's not just for brother branham
[1:44] when he went up we went up with him and
[1:46] into the Eagle anointing and we're able
[1:48] to see right now not in the prophetic
[1:51] like brother Brown saw it but he called
[1:54] us little Eagle little Messiah so so
[1:58] that's what he said about me so I'm
[1:59] going to take that
[2:01] so then I can do we've always said
[2:03] around here a lot of people think that
[2:05] that you know some things are deep and
[2:07] some things I just one thing for sure it
[2:11] brother ground and preach stick you want
[2:13] to be able to understand I don't care
[2:15] what it is he preached it it was for
[2:17] somebody to understand not for everybody
[2:19] but for somebody to understand if
[2:22] brother gonna preach the seals we ought
[2:24] to be able to understand the seals if he
[2:25] preached down 70 which we ought to be
[2:27] able to understand it because he was a
[2:29] property of bringing what the perfect
[2:31] interpretation by divine vindication all
[2:34] right so we know it's been medicated
[2:36] nonetheless read here let's begin
[2:38] because i think this this brings us to
[2:41] the to the son of god is what we started
[2:44] on because the son of god was the
[2:47] creator all right do I have the son of
[2:50] God is the creator some of you that's
[2:52] been in here for 23 months you know
[2:55] we've already been through this but I'm
[2:56] going to back up and we're going to i'm
[2:58] not even going to tape it will put it on
[2:59] there but i'm i'm gonna put it on the
[3:00] phone and the computer because i'm gonna
[3:05] back up and let's look at we've been on
[3:08] the son of god we haven't gotten some
[3:09] man yet so we've been on some god and
[3:12] what is the son of God you see well the
[3:14] son of god was Jesus Christ yeah but he
[3:20] was the son of man right he was the son
[3:24] of man right the son of god was before
[3:27] all things so you got to back up before
[3:30] you get the son of man here you got to
[3:32] have the Son of God because of the Bible
[3:35] says the Son of God because dad asked
[3:37] this question many years ago he told
[3:39] everybody to write down who if you think
[3:41] the Son of God who you thinking of lever
[3:42] my Road Jesus Christ well that's true in
[3:44] a point but it's not true the son of god
[3:48] was the creator we know it was Jesus
[3:50] Christ but it was Christ that was doing
[3:52] the creating even even like we said many
[3:55] times before Peter jesus said who
[3:59] demands say I the Son of Man am now
[4:02] Peter Dan telling me the son of man was
[4:04] he told him to the Son of God woof
[4:05] because Peter said something inside of
[4:08] you what he was he could
[4:09] understand that that man in human flesh
[4:11] was gone but he knew there was something
[4:13] inside that man he said thou art the
[4:15] Christ the Son of the Living God which
[4:17] was the son of God revelation because
[4:20] what Jesus said I'll build my church on
[4:23] the Son of God revelation right nice on
[4:26] a man yet but Son of God revelation so
[4:29] let's find out who that son got it and
[4:31] john wants that in the beginning was the
[4:33] word now we looked up that word and that
[4:36] word if you tag it it means what you
[4:40] cross references in the scrums it means
[4:42] logos our speech are the son of God
[4:47] coming down to the logos and as I said
[4:51] many times before you say well this is
[4:53] hard listen let me tell you something if
[4:57] God brought it this way this is the only
[5:01] way you're going to be able to
[5:02] understand you right got it so if you
[5:04] don't understand you need to pray for
[5:06] revelation if you don't understand this
[5:08] so this is that this is the simplest way
[5:10] brother William that God brought it or
[5:12] heat abroad it another way cuz gotten it
[5:14] does not like us that went fishing this
[5:16] weekend and I forgot the jelly and I
[5:19] forgot the mustard not forgot to live
[5:21] God don't forget yeah once he makes a
[5:24] plan it's gonna but he's already seen it
[5:26] man it made my bed alright so he doesn't
[5:29] he doesn't go in so awesome and done
[5:32] that no whatever he says that's the way
[5:36] it's going to be and that's the only way
[5:37] you can understand you cuz remember he
[5:39] looked down through time and saw you and
[5:41] how you would come so how can he make it
[5:45] any other way okay he can make it any
[5:47] other way that's the way he had to come
[5:49] in the beginning was to okaasan the
[5:52] logos was we've gone into low-cost our
[5:54] Word was God the same was in the
[5:57] beginning with God so we got to go back
[5:59] into the beginning to the creation all
[6:02] things were made by him
[6:06] all things were made by this whoever
[6:08] this logos is that's the Creator I all
[6:12] things were made by him and without him
[6:14] was not anything made that was made
[6:16] right so he was the creator in him was
[6:21] life into life with a lot of men will
[6:24] stop right there so the revelation of
[6:27] the Son of God is one thing jesus said
[6:31] we must worship in spirit God is a
[6:34] spirit alright so as we see what
[6:37] brethren said that that we see a halo of
[6:40] light and that halo of life I've said
[6:43] many times before it and I don't want to
[6:48] seem contrary but remember if we were
[6:51] made in His image we weren't made a halo
[6:54] light so God's always been a human God's
[6:58] always been a man it's just the form
[7:01] that he reveals itself and many times
[7:04] I've said before if Moses had a
[7:06] revelation when he walked up to that
[7:07] burning bush and he saw a bush burning
[7:10] and a man talking to him out of the bush
[7:12] if Moses would have had a revelation
[7:13] like we have a revelation of who that
[7:15] was we just say a man let's see a man
[7:20] right because our revelation is God is a
[7:22] man Moses knew there was a god but he
[7:25] worshipped him in spirit he worshipped
[7:27] him as the Creator alright so God had to
[7:31] and you say well why you got revealing
[7:33] stuff him as a man remember later on he
[7:34] did right Moses said now I really want
[7:39] to see who you are down through this
[7:40] journey Moses said god I want to see you
[7:43] now he's seen God he saw that pillar
[7:45] fire he saw the one that let him he
[7:47] talked to him lift a year the Bible said
[7:49] but one day Moses finally said I want to
[7:53] see who you are and I want to see your
[7:55] real form so what do you got dude is it
[7:57] okay cuz you'll stand in the cleft of
[7:59] the rock don't stand in a rock when you
[8:01] can't see just a little way you don't
[8:03] want Stan outfield you want to stay
[8:05] where he had a view any sea wall by what
[8:08] he said was he said it was what the form
[8:10] of a man who's right well to me that was
[8:12] this same man this theophany which was
[8:16] Jesus Christ prefigured the prophet said
[8:19] right mmm which is the Holy Spirit and
[8:23] we come down and brought he's also
[8:25] brother Rob says many times it's the
[8:26] Angel of the Covenant payment now what
[8:29] happens with this son of God now you say
[8:32] well why don't have to be in southern
[8:33] God first because remember God knew all
[8:36] things he was spirit god there's no way
[8:39] that spirit guide could enter and to
[8:42] listen he could he couldn't enter into
[8:45] Moses and make him a son of God no
[8:50] nobody in the Old Testament had a new
[8:53] birth they did not have an indwelling of
[8:54] God because Allah because the blood of
[8:56] bulls and goats would just cover since
[8:58] Oh God is the spirit he can come down
[9:00] and annoy Moses and then you know the
[9:03] Bible says when he was anointed you
[9:04] couldn't even see his face they had to
[9:06] put a veil over but now when he stepped
[9:09] back from Moses Moses with man he killed
[9:13] an Egyptian he made mistakes he did
[9:15] things wrong he got a little angry one
[9:17] day and smoke to rock instead of
[9:18] speaking to the rider alright so the
[9:21] Holy Spirit is what led the people
[9:23] because remember brother Brown said it
[9:25] was God above got in her way of the
[9:29] people and then you know got it or God
[9:31] with the people and then got into people
[9:32] alright so so god there's no way got to
[9:35] come down now he could come down at the
[9:37] angel the Covenant he could come down to
[9:39] the captain of the hope he can come down
[9:41] as Melchizedek right but Melchizedek and
[9:44] that form couldn't save you enough right
[9:47] hey but that was the Savior yeah but in
[9:51] that form he just created a body stepped
[9:55] into the body done his work stepped out
[9:58] of the body that was the son of god that
[10:00] was not the son of man called the Son of
[10:02] man has to be mine and your brother see
[10:06] that's what we're going to get
[10:06] later on but let's stay with the Sun God
[10:09] for a little while theophany in the
[10:13] beginning God created the heavens in the
[10:16] earth and then Genesis 126 says and God
[10:18] created man in his own image so we must
[10:22] be human God must be human because he
[10:25] made us human a man but he made a spirit
[10:28] man first he said just like the Holy
[10:31] Spirit controls today he said that's
[10:33] what was controlling in the Garden of
[10:35] Eden what did I do Adam when he spoke
[10:40] what happened on the earth guy said
[10:43] we've been over this before God said hey
[10:45] that's my son that's my same fault
[10:47] that's the same thought I had all right
[10:49] what problem is is when the ball came we
[10:51] were talking about last week that
[10:52] Genesis 3 15 God said I'll put enmity
[10:55] once the sin came God is the one that
[10:57] did two separate God had to separate
[10:59] himself from man be the Son of God over
[11:02] the people could he couldn't end well no
[11:04] one like he did Adam the Bible says Adam
[11:08] was the son of God right so Adam was the
[11:11] only Son of God in the Old Testament
[11:12] right the only Son of God in the Old
[11:15] Testament cuz God did dwell in South
[11:17] abba animal was an amateur god but no
[11:19] one else after the fall everyone was
[11:22] anointed now sure they're safe I said
[11:26] Jeremiah all those ones they're going to
[11:27] be in heaven but they're not going to be
[11:29] the bride of Jesus Christ baby there
[11:33] will not be only the proud of Jesus
[11:34] Christ it's when that son of God comes
[11:37] into the son of man that's bright this
[11:42] form is spirit form sure this is sons
[11:45] this is all of us back before the
[11:47] foundation of the world when the sons of
[11:50] God shouted for joy what we were in
[11:52] Christ and the spirit we work people
[11:55] walking around backs of Mormon that's
[11:57] the Mormon doctrine and I talked to some
[11:59] Mormons and that's what they believed
[12:01] that you live one time before you lived
[12:03] in heaven and Jesus and Lucifer were
[12:07] brothers and God give a plan of
[12:11] salvation out and Jesus's plan was
[12:13] better than the devil and God chose
[12:17] jesus' instead of the devil's and that's
[12:19] why the devil got cast out but jesus had
[12:21] to come down and save the people but
[12:23] what happened was we were all up there
[12:24] and we had to go take the form human
[12:26] form to fall so we could go back I said
[12:29] you're playing no fit a your plan
[12:32] actually it's complicated my plan is God
[12:37] is the creator where are the ones that
[12:40] fell he's the one that came he's the one
[12:43] who gave his life and he's 18 branch by
[12:45] God by said that to me that simple ma'am
[12:47] so we were in gone in the beginning was
[12:51] the low cost the word and as we said
[12:54] many times before the birth that you
[12:58] have now your new birth is the birth of
[13:01] this word that God knew you would need
[13:03] when you got here there I understand
[13:06] that you connect your somewhere and
[13:08] you're to be born again you have to
[13:11] connect with this word of God you can't
[13:13] get born again reading war and peace are
[13:16] some novel or whatever you have to get
[13:20] born again by the word because then
[13:21] beginning was the word and the Word was
[13:24] with God and the Word was God and the
[13:25] same was in the beginning with God and
[13:27] you go down to verse 14 and that word
[13:29] that logos was made flesh and dwelt
[13:31] among us all right so that son of God
[13:36] Jesus told Peter Peter I'll build my
[13:40] church on that revelation because
[13:42] remember the Son of Man revelation was
[13:44] lost now to the church ages property God
[13:46] told us that only in the end time does
[13:48] the Son of Man revelation come back Paul
[13:51] never had a real revelation of the Sun
[13:53] man because remember the Son of Man look
[13:57] here's the real yes this is real simple
[14:00] the son of god never seen the Son of God
[14:03] doesn't need Redemption the Son of God
[14:05] never had a bad cough the son of god
[14:08] never had anything to do
[14:10] sin at all the song god never felt a man
[14:15] ok so it's pure remember even the Son of
[14:21] Man Jesus did you say that against the
[14:24] son of man you'll be forgiven but when
[14:26] he the Holy Ghost is come you say that
[14:29] against him it will never be forgiven in
[14:33] other words while you're on earth do you
[14:34] say something against your brother that
[14:35] that's human being that's flesh man
[14:37] right but now if you say something
[14:40] against what's inside that man say
[14:44] something to guess that you bless being
[14:46] the Holy go right right man so to me
[14:49] that's the dispensation is looking at
[14:51] the Son of God and some land but the Son
[14:53] of God ever since I'm God never needed
[14:55] Redemption triaminic right nope son of
[14:59] God is a creator he can he's God he
[15:02] can't sin he can't have a bathtub it's
[15:05] perfect hey man and even that Jesus is
[15:08] 126 man when God said let's let us make
[15:10] man in our image whatever came forth out
[15:12] of them which was the Holy goat whatever
[15:15] came out of them had to be the same way
[15:18] yeah because brother Brown said staying
[15:22] in that formerly would have been fine
[15:23] but when God knew when he put that 21-26
[15:26] man into that 27 man in flesh that's
[15:30] when he knew we would fall because Adam
[15:33] didn't fall in his soul he's felling his
[15:35] flesh right his spirit and his flesh got
[15:39] ruined but now remember he was still son
[15:42] of god man yeah he was still son of God
[15:45] so that's what we have to look the Son
[15:47] of God doesn't need Redemption now what
[15:50] happens is we have to look at this son
[15:53] of God down through the Old Testament so
[15:58] there was sure there was Redemption that
[16:01] was in the people but Jesus Christ the
[16:04] thing about this this morning Jesus
[16:07] Christ came with the Sun God in him not
[16:09] to different people he was only one God
[16:12] but that son of God came into the son of
[16:15] man and he became the Sun
[16:17] man because he took on human flesh cuz
[16:20] even Ezekiel you say well sure Ezekiel
[16:23] says son of man promised out who was
[16:25] that in his he flew in from side what is
[16:27] Ezekiel it was a holy go Ian and he was
[16:30] showing if you look in his vehicle you
[16:33] see the one that you see one you see the
[16:36] Son of Man prophesied son named
[16:38] prophesied but now watch when you get to
[16:40] the three Hebrew children King
[16:43] Nebuchadnezzar knew that could have been
[16:45] human flesh in that fiery furnace but he
[16:47] didn't call it the son of man he said
[16:50] the fourth man must be the Son of God in
[16:53] other words the Spirit is the only one
[16:55] that could that could go into that fiery
[16:57] furnace and help the other three that
[16:59] were in flesh and him walking around
[17:01] talking to it so that had to be the Sun
[17:03] God because remember the Bible perfect a
[17:06] man I was perfect so if it's that son of
[17:09] God then we must look at that son of God
[17:10] revelation and all down through the
[17:13] church ages it was the revelation of the
[17:15] signs I because Jesus told Peter said
[17:17] Peter on this rock or on what on this
[17:19] revelation of the Sun God will I build a
[17:21] turf not so mad it's not a God
[17:24] revelation which is what I Holy go all
[17:27] right any question yes the word with you
[17:35] wouldn't have
[17:36] two ways
[17:39] always with that's right see man takes
[17:44] it and separates him but to me that's
[17:47] like such true said my thoughts were
[17:50] with me they're my heart I can't help
[17:53] grow wings talks about Sam start my mom
[17:55] thought that was God in the beginning
[17:57] was the low cost what he had to think
[17:59] about it before he spoke it you can't
[18:02] just speak and not be thinking us all of
[18:04] us do a lot of that her mouth gets in
[18:08] gear before our brain does who you mean
[18:14] sometimes I remind overriding I mean but
[18:18] that's our humanity it never works that
[18:20] way in God though he never said anything
[18:22] he's never have a work recent of god
[18:27] don't say oops no he's already seen this
[18:30] whole thing like I said before he knew
[18:32] what we needed so he put it in the word
[18:34] in the beginning was the word got this
[18:37] form of this Bible and hey let me
[18:39] promise you one thing you don't carry
[18:41] Bibles around when we get to heaven
[18:43] right no we are going to be the Living
[18:48] Word wherever we're beginning to see
[18:50] that now I think that don't throw your
[18:53] Bible the way don't throw your message
[18:55] books away but we should become the
[18:57] clothes we should become the scripture
[19:00] and then when we get to glory we're not
[19:03] going to carry a big Bible around we're
[19:06] going to be the Bible made mouth that's
[19:07] just the way God wanted it man to me
[19:11] it's very simple God sees the end from
[19:14] the beginning but he had to be a savior
[19:16] because that was one of the attributes
[19:18] of this man so he had to put us in flesh
[19:21] not to make us fall but putting us in
[19:24] flesh knew we would fall and need to
[19:25] save your need a man to come down this
[19:28] man come down put on human flesh be born
[19:31] a baby as mal Cassidy one more Nevada so
[19:34] now casually could not be your brother
[19:36] because the son of and your brother
[19:39] man the Son of Man is where is the key
[19:42] to the whole thing why do you think some
[19:43] man's got to come back in the end time
[19:45] if there's not the key to the whole
[19:46] thing comes the Son of Man was 2000
[19:48] years ago lanius died go up into glory
[19:51] send the Holy goes back down which is
[19:52] the son of God why do you just leave it
[19:54] that way well like I said before son of
[19:56] God don't need Redemption we had sons of
[20:00] man need Redemption and if son of god
[20:04] never took a body shame right he never
[20:09] changes if this man changes he's not God
[20:12] the Son of Man is the one that was
[20:15] buried and took a body change right so
[20:18] that's why meaning you have to be out we
[20:20] are now under the Son of Man revelation
[20:22] and it's not just because William Brown
[20:24] said sorry that's just not cuz he said
[20:28] no he's got to be revealed to you man
[20:32] it's got to be revealed to all of us
[20:35] because the Son of God like I said the
[20:37] son of God sons have gone to you know
[20:40] all down through time Luther Wesley
[20:42] they're all laying in the grave the
[20:45] flesh part of them are laying in the
[20:46] grave waiting on somebody to catch that
[20:49] son of man revelation again in the end
[20:52] time to do what to resurrect those body
[20:55] because the son of man took a
[20:57] resurrection to santander in the
[20:58] interaction something I've done here
[21:01] redemption none of God doesn't need that
[21:03] he's the one he created everything he's
[21:05] one of creative out of here in them but
[21:08] when you bring that down into the Sun
[21:10] land that son of man is the most
[21:13] important to me it's the most important
[21:15] is the key because when I was a son of
[21:17] man you won't understand son of god and
[21:19] you won't understand son David because
[21:21] what the Son of man has to come down
[21:23] here God in human flesh I'm talking
[21:26] about sons of men now I'm come
[21:29] not just one way around was not lease on
[21:31] the land and the only one I'm gorditas
[21:33] Christ was on a man but remember what he
[21:35] said he didn't say on my son of God he
[21:37] said I'm a son of man rip you know one
[21:40] part of it revealing beasts on a man so
[21:43] he was identifying he was part of the
[21:45] Son of Man revelation he said I'm a
[21:47] subtle and revealing the son of am right
[21:51] and then now we can have the song then
[21:53] revelation which we'll get to later on
[21:55] because we gotta really understand its
[21:57] own God the Son of God is the Holy
[22:01] Spirit angel covenant and even brother
[22:03] Ronald said he said that same angle of
[22:06] covenant standing two feet from me we
[22:08] read it last Sunday he said that same
[22:10] angel that led is real children of
[22:12] Israel extending right beside me yes I
[22:14] see that's a paradox because that same
[22:17] man was inside of it we gave him staying
[22:20] beside it yeah laughter right that was a
[22:26] different anointing that wasn't the son
[22:31] of man that was the son of God son of
[22:35] man was Jesus Christ but to bring that
[22:38] son of God so close to that man he said
[22:43] well that was just for him sure the
[22:45] prophecy part the healing part on that
[22:49] level was all William Brennan without
[22:52] angel the Covenant is no less powerful
[22:55] today we make him less powerful because
[23:00] remember when that son of God went into
[23:02] that son of man called Jesus Christ they
[23:04] was things he didn't know right brother
[23:07] Brown said he didn't know his partner
[23:08] kingdom to what Moses and Elijah came in
[23:12] theophany you see they'd already turned
[23:15] back to the word they're already turned
[23:18] back to the word even when brother
[23:19] Brandon went across the curtner time
[23:21] they told him plane was there Nina
[23:23] Hawaiian was there
[23:24] look around little girl these people are
[23:26] they Brown they said no your convert and
[23:30] then they all said if you hadn't have
[23:32] come what they were telling him because
[23:34] they were back into their word form
[23:36] their theophany right man all right man
[23:39] now look no I don't want to i want to
[23:42] give you a little point2 to ponder where
[23:47] is that now if it's this and if it's
[23:53] this if you're born again that's where
[23:57] your fee off in the end it's in your
[23:59] soul does your shoulders your theophany
[24:02] we don't have a body hanging up in a
[24:04] closet somewhere to go to know we have a
[24:07] word a word to go to write if they surf
[24:12] the crabapple easily have one way what
[24:14] not one way there's not a way Dale
[24:16] standing up in the sixth dimension
[24:19] waiting on me to get there and I'm just
[24:20] an hour like this you know know if this
[24:25] earthly Tabernacle be dissolved all I do
[24:27] is just I don't need to I don't need you
[24:30] to open the door I don't need you to
[24:32] open a window I'm just going to step
[24:34] over into the next dimension in the same
[24:36] what's carrying what is carrying me over
[24:39] there now word that I have here is
[24:43] what's carrying me into that sixth
[24:45] dimension all right so so let's not look
[24:48] at it as we've we've got one hanging up
[24:51] in a closet or know the one that's
[24:53] waiting is right here because if you're
[24:55] born again this is what's inside of you
[24:58] this is our whole problem we don't
[25:01] realize what we already have if you're
[25:04] born again you don't realize what you
[25:05] already have it's the Son of God in an
[25:08] ace on a man not least on man in haste
[25:10] on a man revealing the son of man but
[25:13] what's it doing it's bringing this body
[25:15] under subjection to what word everything
[25:20] goes back to the word because in the
[25:21] beginning was what the word all right
[25:23] and it's a word body that we're looking
[25:26] at not no no not a flesh body we had to
[25:29] come down
[25:30] to take on flesh because that's where we
[25:31] fell we fell in flash at a villain flash
[25:35] the Sun good and I hope you understand
[25:38] so the dog doesn't need Redemption it's
[25:41] like I was telling we were talked about
[25:42] the other day God did write all this in
[25:47] the Bible for us to be able to tell him
[25:49] what he is he knows what he is he just
[25:54] wrote it in there to get us to see who
[25:56] he already had okay so this is not a
[25:58] surprise that God did but like i said
[26:00] before you said well i don't understand
[26:02] it but then you need to pray because the
[26:04] one that wrote it the one that wrote
[26:06] this word if you're born again is inside
[26:09] of you brother brown said wait on you to
[26:11] bring him to what word so that he can
[26:14] click in it oh yeah we can read all this
[26:17] in the beginning was worth about
[26:18] probably millions of people today are in
[26:20] the same scripture Oh God is up in
[26:23] heaven and we're going to glory one day
[26:27] we all know him but I know Mama's up
[26:30] there playing a harp on a cloud you know
[26:33] just wait on this and you know even
[26:35] brother Brown had a had his limited
[26:38] revelation in the beginning remember he
[26:40] said I float my brother navel he said I
[26:42] couldn't shake his hand Oh baby when he
[26:44] went across that Carter time his
[26:46] revelation went up a little higher his
[26:49] revelation was hey there is solid as I
[26:52] am on this side actually they're more
[26:53] real than I am I'll see they're in their
[26:56] eternal state he was in he said I look
[26:58] back and see my old body land on them on
[27:00] the bed say they had come into a
[27:03] condition they had turned back into the
[27:05] word form they were supposed to be had
[27:07] he not been a fall a man yeah so it's
[27:10] the same way with brother Brian when all
[27:11] the ones that are in that seats to
[27:12] mention they're waiting on us because
[27:15] the Son of Man revelation is the one it
[27:18] takes a buddy chain see the Son of God
[27:21] revelation don't need a body chain you
[27:25] don't need a change
[27:26] but coming it through the filter of
[27:28] flesh the way I call them builder of
[27:30] flesh down to the son of man we need
[27:32] Redemption show that we can go back
[27:34] because remember Redemption is not
[27:36] replacement right redemption is falling
[27:39] from where you were eating coming around
[27:40] back to it alright so in the beginning
[27:42] was the word and I've said many times
[27:44] before the only way you can understand
[27:46] this is to have the author inside you
[27:49] mm-hmm okay if you write if I were to
[27:53] write you a book about me and James been
[27:55] married for 36 years and i will write
[27:56] you up i write you a book this thick and
[27:59] i headed the way him and he probably
[28:01] fall asleep after two chapters well
[28:04] that's a good book that's just that's
[28:06] nice but in some way i could take me
[28:10] that experienced it and place my spirit
[28:14] and william and then William reads it
[28:18] you read it with a whole different set
[28:20] of eyes right because you are
[28:22] experiencing that what's the same way
[28:23] we've done that's why people read this
[28:25] word and don't get one thing out of it
[28:27] because the author's not inside they're
[28:29] going that's what I say it that's what I
[28:32] meant that's the end between the lines
[28:35] say that's why i said before and i want
[28:39] you to see this again even if God will
[28:42] wrote every day every life of everybody
[28:45] but from the time he created man till
[28:48] now the book will be so big dude never
[28:50] be able to remember even Johnson I can't
[28:53] even write it in the book remind he said
[28:55] the volume wouldn't contain what Jesus
[28:58] done that never was written as a good
[28:59] but God knew that we 66 books is about
[29:03] all we can handle and we couldn't carry
[29:07] books this thick Sam so you put it in 66
[29:10] volume 66 chapters and he said here this
[29:13] is my word you can carry anywhere you go
[29:15] Carrie there you go and this is me now
[29:18] what you got to do is tho you gotta read
[29:20] between the left you got to do the fill
[29:22] and the part that I really you know eat
[29:24] my pleasure to green my blood walk out
[29:26] the door he really need never explained
[29:30] it but now what you'd call a dude Paul
[29:31] with the Holy Ghost right all of the
[29:36] Holy Ghost and correct has explained
[29:39] what Jesus was saying he said he said
[29:41] this is my body which is broken for you
[29:43] this is my blood doing in remembrance of
[29:46] me right so Paul with what Paul had the
[29:49] one that wrote it inside of it the ones
[29:52] in the upper room I I told him before a
[29:55] will be finished in just a second it's a
[29:58] devil would have left Jesus alone see
[30:01] Jesus's body would have died sometime
[30:03] but it was a flesh body when born in sin
[30:07] but it was born in this sinful world
[30:09] right he was he looked 50 but he was 30
[30:12] so don't tell me his body went aging
[30:14] right now his body saw and felt the
[30:17] effects of the curse right right if God
[30:22] will I mean if Satan would have left him
[30:24] alone that body would have died
[30:25] somewhere but he killed him and when he
[30:29] killed him 50 days later he had 121
[30:33] little Jesus's that they went on the day
[30:35] of Pentecost so that Jesus came back at
[30:37] 120 people and then I want to have Jesus
[30:40] and he walked out and said men and
[30:42] brother you've killed jesus cried but if
[30:44] you repent and be baptized in the name
[30:46] of jesus christ so now there's 3121
[30:49] Jesus is in one day Satan was having a
[30:51] nervous breakdown that now what have I
[30:53] done and now do all down to the church
[30:56] ages that son of God revelation though
[30:59] has been God working in human flesh
[31:01] obviously but it was a revelation that
[31:05] Jesus with all my god the came and died
[31:10] for our sins and it will accept him as
[31:13] our Savior he'll give us eternal life
[31:15] all right
[31:18] but now that's not gonna get you a body
[31:19] chain all right that's going to put you
[31:22] in a grave just like it did all them
[31:24] down through till today till this day
[31:27] right here we've made several people you
[31:29] can see their pictures on that wall in
[31:31] there we very several people what they
[31:33] died under the revelation of the Son and
[31:35] God did I believe in Jesus Christ then
[31:37] you died for my sins that I'll have
[31:38] eternal life and that one day I'll come
[31:40] up in a resurrection but that's not the
[31:43] Son of Man Revelation the Son of Man
[31:44] revelation is I've already been changed
[31:49] all you look over the roulade I've
[31:52] already been changed God changed me
[31:56] inside now he's changing me outside
[31:57] Camille that's the Son of Man revelation
[31:59] the Son of God is fixing to work his way
[32:01] out and into that son of man so he
[32:07] appeared as a captain of the host
[32:08] remember Joshua Joshua was all worked up
[32:12] one day man he just won a big battle he
[32:14] was standing out there nice Amell we
[32:16] don't look them on and he sees this man
[32:18] coming he looks and obviously the man
[32:21] was dressed as a warrior because Joshua
[32:26] the Bible says 30 sword and said who are
[32:28] you are you for us are you against them
[32:32] he was still hyped up he was ready he
[32:34] was he had won a battle he said hey if
[32:36] you're one if you're one of the enemy
[32:37] and you one last one me and you know you
[32:39] will deal with me but when that land
[32:42] spoke and said oh no Joshua I'm the
[32:47] captain of the host Joshua heard that
[32:49] voice that they've been talking to me
[32:51] and he got down on his knees but really
[32:54] truly people that wasn't his Savior that
[32:58] men didn't save it so that was a human
[33:01] form that the son of my son of God
[33:04] stepped into to meet somebody just like
[33:07] he did milk as a dick and then that body
[33:09] went out of the distance and that man
[33:11] couldn't dive up and that man came into
[33:14] a
[33:15] woman there's your son of man that's the
[33:20] man that literally died because remember
[33:23] he died in the mind of God before the
[33:25] foundation of the world right what's
[33:29] that wasn't good enough he had to come
[33:31] down here and do it as a witness he had
[33:34] to die to what to release the life so
[33:36] that mean you that have eternal life and
[33:39] now we have a son of man revelation
[33:41] which will begin on the next Sunday a
[33:43] son of man revelation that no one else
[33:46] had this revelation all they knew we
[33:49] were God in human flesh they knew that
[33:51] God was in us but we've got to become so
[33:55] much to remember it was dust sample or
[33:58] in the Old Testament little brown said
[34:01] the Prophet would catch it and say the
[34:03] centauran well that's what somebody else
[34:05] said jesus never send us that for jesus
[34:12] said I say I say unto you and then what
[34:16] member brother Brown said I could never
[34:17] understand that scripture says you what
[34:20] you say to this mountain it'll be moved
[34:22] from seed mother brenda was a prophet he
[34:24] had saved us that the Lord called he
[34:26] caught the revelation from God and give
[34:28] it to us and he died somebody is not
[34:37] going to die
[34:38] but you can't save us save the Lord and
[34:41] live it's got to be what you say when
[34:46] the Bible says what you say to this
[34:47] mountain because your body changes don't
[34:49] come from inside you brother nails not
[34:52] going to speak your body shame but
[34:54] Matthews nothing speaker by the change
[34:56] you're going to have to speak your own
[34:58] body chain but now it's a revelation of
[35:01] what everybody that's what the powerful
[35:02] ministry tells you that's a revelation
[35:04] that's what it's going to be it's going
[35:06] to be the revelation it's going to be
[35:07] revealed to you and you only I'm not
[35:10] going to take a body changed on my daddy
[35:11] does gundo have grandchildren ain't
[35:14] drank it so thank you Heavenly Father
[35:17] for father's day number one and thank
[35:19] your natural father if he's still alive
[35:20] for poverty god bless you thank you
