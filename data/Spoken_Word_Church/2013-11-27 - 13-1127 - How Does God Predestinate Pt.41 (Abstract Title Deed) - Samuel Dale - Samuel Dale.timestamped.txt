[4:22] the heavenly father we thank you for

[4:58] we love you and we thank you and we pray
[5:00] that you would just bless each one
[5:02] remember the sick among us because you
[5:04] promised it you said you sent your word
[5:06] and healed us
[5:07] and delivered us from destruction so we
[5:09] ask you to have your way forgive our
[5:11] sins
[5:12] and guide us each and every one lord
[5:14] take your
[5:16] you just come tonight
[5:18] and take over the service and be in the
[5:20] speaker and the hearer lord that we may
[5:22] all be one together in you
[5:24] guide us now in jesus name amen
[5:28] romans
[5:29] 8
[5:32] 28
[5:34] for we know that all things work
[5:36] together for good to them that love god
[5:38] to them who are the called according to
[5:41] his purpose
[5:42] for whom he did for no he did also
[5:44] predestinate
[5:46] to be conformed to the image of his son
[5:48] that he might be the firstborn amin
[5:50] among many brethren now what is it the
[5:53] prophet said he predestinates what by
[5:56] his for knowledge
[5:59] not that he desired this person be saved
[6:02] this would be lost but it's all by his
[6:04] foreknowledge
[6:06] all right
[6:07] said moreover whom he did predestinate
[6:10] them he also called and whom he called
[6:12] them he also justified
[6:14] and whom he justified them he also
[6:16] glorified
[6:17] what shall we then say to these things
[6:20] what shall we say if god be for us
[6:23] who can be against us that's a wonderful
[6:24] statement isn't it
[6:26] all right revelations
[6:28] i want to try to get a little point in
[6:30] tonight if i can
[6:32] so we'll jump over to revelations
[6:35] and read verse 1 of chapter 5.
[6:38] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[6:40] said on the throne
[6:42] a book written within and on the
[6:43] backside
[6:45] sealed with seven seals you may be
[6:47] seated
[6:48] the lord had his blessing to the reading
[6:50] of the word
[6:53] now we've been
[6:54] quite a while talking about
[6:56] predestination
[6:59] and we went through and come down into
[7:01] the garden to see that
[7:03] you know mankind fell because god knew
[7:05] if he gave us
[7:07] an opportunity the prophet said by free
[7:09] moral agents he gave us a choice
[7:12] that we would fall
[7:14] all right and he knew that we would do
[7:16] that but our fall would bring about
[7:20] or bring to price
[7:22] the ability for him to be able to be a
[7:24] savior a healer etc
[7:28] and so then
[7:29] we look bad at the fall
[7:32] but we know that there's more than just
[7:33] looking at the fall and if we just keep
[7:35] talking about the fall then
[7:37] you know we're just uh taking a
[7:39] one-sided view
[7:42] but now i want us to keep
[7:45] our thoughts in mind though
[7:48] of one thing
[7:50] and then if we get a chance to get over
[7:51] to it tonight if we don't we'll take it
[7:53] up sunday and
[7:54] continue on
[7:56] but
[7:59] in genesis 3 15
[8:01] he said he would put
[8:03] enmity between thy seed
[8:06] and the seed of the woman all right
[8:08] now
[8:11] eve through
[8:14] the wrong act
[8:16] with the beast
[8:18] and not adam
[8:22] then
[8:24] she mingled
[8:26] or as we'll get to it in a minute
[8:28] she
[8:30] hybrid
[8:31] the whole human race
[8:33] all right
[8:35] now
[8:37] but my point i wanted you to see was and
[8:39] i've been trying to drive it in there on
[8:41] it
[8:42] of
[8:45] we can talk about the seed of the woman
[8:48] but remember it took a womb to bring the
[8:51] seed of the
[8:52] serpent we know the serpent doesn't have
[8:56] a seed
[8:57] so it was not using that
[8:59] all right
[9:01] but it took a wound to bring it forth
[9:02] and that's what he's done
[9:05] but it also took a wound to bring forth
[9:09] a savior for mankind
[9:12] so then you know it would take that to
[9:14] be then the woman would be used
[9:16] because it promised in genesis 3 15
[9:20] that between thy seed and the seed of
[9:22] the woman now the woman doesn't have a
[9:24] seed so it's got to be speaking of some
[9:27] other way
[9:29] and in doing that
[9:31] then
[9:32] what did we wind up talking about
[9:36] that the womb of eve brought forth
[9:40] the seed of the serpent
[9:43] now listen
[9:44] because that's why it would be called
[9:45] the seed of the serpent
[9:47] see it was caught if it would have been
[9:48] called the seat of the beast
[9:51] like i was trying to get a point to you
[9:52] sunday
[9:54] if if the bible would have said the seat
[9:55] of the beast well everybody knew what
[9:57] happened
[9:59] they would have figured out the beast
[10:00] and what was going on
[10:02] but to be a mystery then it would be
[10:04] called the seed of the serpent
[10:06] because it was that seed
[10:09] all right
[10:10] because it started with the seed of
[10:12] unbelief
[10:15] because that's the seed satan carries he
[10:17] has no physical seed
[10:20] no way to bring forth he cannot create
[10:23] and neither is he a man that he could
[10:25] mingle into the human race
[10:28] but yet he saw
[10:30] his opportunity
[10:33] to be able to get eve to thinking wrong
[10:37] and then the wrong act would take place
[10:41] and it would bring forth
[10:44] and it would be his child
[10:46] now not his child by
[10:49] uh
[10:50] himself because he couldn't do it
[10:53] so it would have to be what would we
[10:54] call it vicariously or in place off
[10:58] that
[10:59] the seed of the serpent would come forth
[11:02] but yet what it would be it would be
[11:04] that the serpent used the beast
[11:08] all right
[11:09] and as he used the beast
[11:12] he brought death to the human race
[11:17] all right
[11:19] but yet by a wound there was a little
[11:22] sister named mary
[11:25] that she brought the seed of the woman
[11:29] going down the woman when he's speaking
[11:30] to eve the woman doesn't have a seed
[11:33] so he would bring forth the seed of the
[11:35] woman
[11:37] and how would that be
[11:40] that would have to be a very
[11:42] mysterious thing and i like the way the
[11:45] prophet of god said it
[11:47] and uh i want to just get right into the
[11:49] thought
[11:50] you say well i don't understand what all
[11:52] this has to do about predestination
[11:55] well god knew we'd fall
[11:59] all right
[12:01] by his foreknowledge
[12:03] but also by his foreign knowledge he
[12:04] knew that he would bring forth a savior
[12:08] all right
[12:10] see then it wouldn't be a a fall that
[12:13] would pull something over on god
[12:16] you know that he didn't know this was
[12:17] going to happen
[12:18] and something happened and he had to do
[12:20] something else no
[12:22] he knew exactly what he was doing
[12:26] as i said the other day then
[12:28] even though god would
[12:31] slay the animals
[12:32] and take the skins the prophet said off
[12:34] of them and make them skins to walk out
[12:37] of the garden with bloody skins flapping
[12:39] on them
[12:40] not only would
[12:42] would that
[12:43] be a part but that would be only the
[12:46] atonement
[12:50] all right it couldn't take away sin
[12:52] the atonement of the old testament of
[12:54] the animal life could not take away sin
[12:56] true
[12:58] so even though god
[13:00] killed the animals
[13:02] it would not take away sin
[13:04] so he had to do something else so in
[13:06] genesis 3 15 see he promised
[13:09] the seed of the woman to come
[13:13] but it would take 4 000 years before
[13:15] that would come into being
[13:16] we'll get back more on that
[13:19] lord willing sunday
[13:21] but just think about what
[13:23] we're saying now and watch how these two
[13:27] things work
[13:29] the seed of the woman and the seed of
[13:30] the serpent
[13:32] and watch what's your prophet i gave it
[13:34] to you the other day but let's read it
[13:35] again
[13:36] go back to page 99 of the ephesian
[13:38] church age which is a church age book
[13:43] let's just see what the prophet had to
[13:44] say
[13:47] and he's coming down and he used genesis
[13:49] 3 15 and i will put enmity between thee
[13:51] and the seed of the woman between thee
[13:52] and the woman and between thy seed and
[13:54] her seed it shall bruise thy head and
[13:56] thou shalt bruise his heel we know this
[13:58] took place at calvary at calvary he did
[14:00] bruise the heel of the lord jesus but
[14:03] the lord jesus breathed his head all
[14:05] right
[14:06] now if we give credit to the word that
[14:08] the woman did have a seed
[14:11] well now we know we've done red word the
[14:13] prophet said she don't have one
[14:15] all right
[14:16] but now giving credit to it
[14:19] then the serpent surely had a seat also
[14:23] there was
[14:24] if the seat of the woman was a man-child
[14:28] apart from the man
[14:30] not by man
[14:32] and not by mary producing an egg
[14:40] she didn't do it it had to be a virgin
[14:41] birth
[14:43] it had to be that would be egg and sperm
[14:44] both would be created of god so look
[14:47] what he's saying
[14:48] if the seed of the woman was a man child
[14:50] apart from the man
[14:53] without a man see
[14:55] all right
[14:56] then the seed of the serpent will be in
[14:58] the same pattern what
[15:00] a seed without a man
[15:05] right
[15:07] now listen then
[15:10] and that is another male must be born
[15:12] apart from human male instrumentality
[15:15] for both of them
[15:18] a human male will be born
[15:20] apart or separate
[15:23] from
[15:24] the human male instrumentality human
[15:26] male didn't have anything to do with it
[15:28] the adam had nothing to do
[15:31] with the seed of the serpent
[15:35] the beast was used
[15:37] to bring forth
[15:39] all right mary had no husband or nothing
[15:42] i mean you know she was engaged to
[15:45] joseph but there was no
[15:47] nothing wrong
[15:48] but she would bring forth
[15:51] a man child
[15:53] that would not be connected to the human
[15:55] race
[15:57] right
[15:59] now
[16:00] so watch them
[16:02] there is no student who does not know
[16:04] that the seat of the woman was the
[16:06] christ who came by
[16:07] they watched the instrumentality of god
[16:10] apart from the human intercourse didn't
[16:12] have anything to it she didn't bring no
[16:14] egg he showed us didn't have anything to
[16:16] do with it there's nothing connected
[16:18] right
[16:20] it is also just as well known that the
[16:22] predicted bruising of the serpent's head
[16:24] was an actuality of prophecy concerning
[16:27] what christ would accomplish against
[16:29] satan
[16:30] at the cross
[16:31] there at the cross
[16:33] christ would bruise the head of satan
[16:36] while satan would bruise the heel of the
[16:38] lord all right
[16:41] both brought forth from a wound
[16:45] the seed of the serpent
[16:48] the seed of the woman both comes from a
[16:50] wound
[16:52] but apart from human instrumentality
[16:55] i've told you a lot of people believe
[16:57] adam
[16:58] and eve in the garden
[17:01] that's the old denominational teaching
[17:02] the adam and eve in the garden
[17:04] was scheduled to come down here later to
[17:06] a place to do and reproduce but they got
[17:08] ahead of it and messed it up and and
[17:10] adam would be the tree of death and they
[17:12] would or
[17:13] you know life and eve would be the tree
[17:14] of death and you know
[17:17] but no it's got to be
[17:18] a separate from anything connected to
[17:20] the human race
[17:22] so the beast was used
[17:26] huh
[17:27] right
[17:29] that's why he was taken then if you ever
[17:31] you know notice the prophet then
[17:33] that's why i love the message where we
[17:35] got the answers
[17:37] the prophet said then
[17:39] that
[17:40] animal was used
[17:43] to pollute the wound
[17:45] so animal would be used
[17:48] as the sacrifice
[17:50] of the atonement right
[17:53] see then the animal life would have to
[17:55] be taken to replace that
[17:59] that's a beautiful picture to see it as
[18:01] it comes down as we'll get to it you
[18:03] know one of these days i want to preach
[18:04] uh just a message all the way through
[18:06] without
[18:07] uh using too many quotes just kind of
[18:10] scan through
[18:11] but i want you to think about it
[18:15] and think about that
[18:19] the way
[18:21] the seed of the woman would come forth
[18:26] satan
[18:29] the prophet said has a knowledge
[18:31] of the principles of life
[18:34] all right which he knew which animal
[18:36] would mix he knew better than to try a
[18:38] monkey and a human uh darwin couldn't
[18:40] even do that all right
[18:43] but yes that's where darwin failed at
[18:45] because he couldn't find the beast the
[18:47] missing link between man and the monkey
[18:49] well after the bible explains what it is
[18:53] but see satan knew
[18:56] not only would the
[18:58] with those two animals mix
[19:01] you know
[19:03] eve
[19:04] and the beast
[19:07] he knew
[19:08] that if he could in some way get that
[19:11] together
[19:12] he could pollute
[19:14] the human race
[19:16] is which what he did
[19:19] all right
[19:20] and in polluting the human race
[19:23] look where you and i would wind up being
[19:29] all right
[19:30] look at number two what we're talking
[19:31] about spoken words original seed
[19:34] part 2 62
[19:36] 3 18.
[19:38] but every man
[19:41] no matter where he's pope
[19:43] priest bishop
[19:45] whatever he is
[19:48] now people don't like for me to read
[19:51] the way i read
[19:52] uh every man no matter whether it be
[19:55] brother branham or samuel dale
[19:58] or james cawley
[20:02] you know
[20:03] i see people don't want you to mention
[20:05] brother branham into things they want to
[20:06] be him something special i i believe
[20:08] he's something special that's the
[20:10] message we got that's right but the
[20:12] human being was a human being
[20:14] he said now whether every man matter
[20:16] where he's a pope priest bishop whatever
[20:18] he is he dies what
[20:20] because he's he's a hybrid
[20:23] don't you call me no hybrid
[20:27] what are you
[20:29] oh my family come over on the mayflower
[20:34] yeah mine did too stowaway
[20:37] i don't care about talking like that
[20:39] i'm not throwing off on nobody
[20:41] i'm just plain to say it don't matter
[20:43] what
[20:44] all of us polluted
[20:46] we'll get back to that in just a second
[20:48] more
[20:49] and watch what happened
[20:52] he was born between satan and eve he
[20:55] said now no matter who he is
[20:59] well but i i can run my lineage back
[21:03] you know they got the message in them
[21:05] they got the doctrine and the message
[21:06] that if you were born from adam you
[21:09] could be saved but if you was born from
[21:11] the beast you couldn't be saved
[21:14] now
[21:14] that's not according to what the prophet
[21:16] said i'd like to hear the quotes for
[21:18] that
[21:20] you know i mean that's going out on
[21:22] internet i'd like to hear the quotes
[21:24] that shows you anything different
[21:27] as a two-lineage thing
[21:30] because of what your prophet said
[21:33] he was born between satan and eve
[21:39] everybody was born between satan but
[21:41] brother dale satan don't you just got to
[21:44] say and satan didn't have no seed
[21:47] that's exactly right
[21:49] we are that seed
[21:51] that he was able to produce
[21:55] by mingling or hybriding the human race
[21:59] oh don't you call me serpentine big boy
[22:02] well what are you
[22:05] i ain't no big boy but you're a serpent
[22:06] seed
[22:08] why do you need saved if you're not
[22:10] amen oh of course now you don't need to
[22:13] be saved
[22:15] all you got to do is just believe you
[22:16] always was
[22:20] right
[22:22] see the seed of the serpent is still
[22:24] here
[22:25] that seed of the serpents right up here
[22:26] that's why we was born between satan and
[22:28] eve
[22:31] what made mama and daddy get get you and
[22:33] i here started right up here
[22:38] right
[22:40] so we're born between what
[22:43] satan and eve
[22:45] and they call it whatever you want to
[22:47] it was satan and eve
[22:49] the original word had nothing to do with
[22:51] it the original word was life
[22:54] he had hybrid it and brought
[22:56] death
[22:58] he hybrid the human race
[23:02] and brought death
[23:03] all right
[23:06] now think about it
[23:10] see once the wound was polluted
[23:15] by the beast
[23:18] then there was nothing from there would
[23:20] ever be born that would be worth
[23:21] anything
[23:24] amen
[23:25] all right
[23:27] now even in your dog kingdom this is an
[23:30] example
[23:33] you take you've got a beautiful dog
[23:34] you've got purebred
[23:36] little nice little beagle you know pure
[23:39] bread
[23:42] let that mama mate with an old hound
[23:46] and you got a mixed up bunch of puppies
[23:48] right
[23:50] but you know what
[23:52] that female
[23:54] cannot be used
[23:56] to bring forth any pure lineage
[23:59] did you know that
[24:01] if you don't call the doctor and find
[24:03] out about it you know this
[24:06] once that female has received that male
[24:09] of a different
[24:11] uh form or whatever you want to call it
[24:12] different kind of dog
[24:17] horse is the same thing all animals i'm
[24:20] just using the dog where you can check
[24:22] it'll never wind up to be able to have a
[24:24] purebred
[24:28] he said well what what what
[24:30] well go check it and find out if i'm
[24:31] right or not
[24:34] he said well it could bleed itself out
[24:36] were
[24:39] they may tell you it can but get the
[24:42] point once the female received the wrong
[24:45] mail
[24:46] she would then from it on be a high
[24:48] breeder
[24:51] and none of her puppies no matter how
[24:53] much purebred
[24:55] the next male would be
[24:57] would not bring
[24:59] a purebred
[25:01] you can't get the papers on it
[25:04] do you understand
[25:08] see once eve received
[25:11] the beast
[25:12] her wound was polluted
[25:14] right
[25:17] right
[25:18] the wound being polluted
[25:23] then what would that cause
[25:28] would cause all of us to be what the
[25:29] prophet said
[25:31] hybrid
[25:34] oh i know people want to get those
[25:36] lineages and they want to get those
[25:37] sweet little things you know they want
[25:39] all kind of little but what good is
[25:41] those little things facing the word of
[25:43] god
[25:45] what i want is where the prophet said it
[25:47] because i just read to you he said we're
[25:49] all hybrid
[25:51] psalmist david said what
[25:53] born in sin
[25:55] shape it in iniquity spouse from our
[25:57] mother's womb and go forth a liar
[26:01] the prophet form summed it up by saying
[26:04] we are born in satan's kingdom
[26:09] subject
[26:12] to him
[26:14] how much greater could it be
[26:17] but you see we wanted everything to be
[26:20] some kind of a
[26:22] oh if i could just find
[26:27] if i could just find my lineage
[26:31] what go dig
[26:33] you might find something
[26:37] but what would it matter
[26:39] what you found
[26:41] there was only one
[26:44] person
[26:45] ever born correctly
[26:47] i said born correctly remember adam and
[26:49] eve were created when born
[26:53] even though
[26:54] you go back to cain and abel
[26:59] by your own bible
[27:02] we can see cain
[27:04] offered a sacrifice but why did abel
[27:06] offer one
[27:12] i mean he's a direct descendant
[27:16] right
[27:19] why did abel have to offer a sacrifice
[27:25] because he was polluted
[27:29] well i don't know i don't like that you
[27:30] just see this you bum fuzz with me bung
[27:32] falls no i don't
[27:34] i make it show up how stupid we really
[27:36] are
[27:38] we're to look at the natural things of
[27:39] the world
[27:41] we can find the word of god fulfilling
[27:43] right in it
[27:45] i said about a
[27:46] dog mix it with a a beagle with a hound
[27:50] you no longer have a beagle
[27:53] and for generation next generation next
[27:55] generation that gene will follow its way
[27:57] down
[28:05] you know that even oh i'll get off of
[28:07] that
[28:09] but listen
[28:12] when eve accepted satan's lie
[28:16] in her reasoning
[28:18] through her reasoning conscience
[28:21] affections etc
[28:26] then
[28:27] she accepted
[28:31] the beast
[28:36] and then the whole human being was
[28:38] polluted
[28:41] see there she stood with her mind
[28:43] polluted by satan's lie
[28:47] but see then once she went further with
[28:49] it it polluted the whole
[28:51] body everything
[28:54] that's why she's called the bible said
[28:56] eve the mother of all
[28:59] living
[29:02] all right
[29:04] that's why i tell you kids
[29:06] they tell you about these
[29:07] extraterrestrial beings out there if
[29:09] they are they come from here
[29:11] but according to the bible he's the
[29:13] mother of all living
[29:14] all right
[29:16] but now think about it
[29:24] see
[29:26] then
[29:28] by the pollution
[29:31] we would all wind up being polluted
[29:34] except for jesus christ
[29:36] now be careful here
[29:39] because as i said
[29:41] it polluted the wound
[29:45] the beast lineage polluted the wound
[29:48] right
[29:50] the earth where the virgin birth comes
[29:52] in
[29:55] that's why if mary
[29:57] had to produce the egg
[30:00] and even god produced the sperm
[30:03] germ whatever terms you want to use
[30:06] it would have still been the prophet
[30:07] said
[30:08] mankind producing a body
[30:11] he said that would have not been
[30:13] the seed of the woman
[30:16] that wouldn't have been christ
[30:20] he just buried that wound
[30:23] now you can say and quote and that's
[30:25] fine
[30:26] he's wounded spoken words reasonable
[30:28] seed i'll give you the quote her
[30:30] physical wound was pure
[30:32] and her spiritual wound
[30:36] was pure
[30:37] because she said be it unto me according
[30:38] to thy word
[30:41] but remember now
[30:45] the wound being polluted
[30:50] but yet by creation
[30:53] he bypassed the wound
[30:59] now are you listening
[31:01] i mean
[31:02] it don't hit you to think sometimes
[31:07] the prophets say every wound is polluted
[31:10] so
[31:12] every wound is polluted jesus come
[31:13] through a wound
[31:19] you don't think
[31:22] i do and then i begin to say lord
[31:25] help me
[31:28] the devil helped me think
[31:30] now you help me figure it out
[31:37] but you see
[31:38] you've heard the prophet
[31:42] without going into lengthy details
[31:44] you've heard the prophet
[31:46] he said if if mary
[31:50] produced the egg
[31:55] he said it meant they would have to be
[32:00] a physical intercourse
[32:04] to bring the egg down
[32:11] are you listening
[32:16] all right
[32:18] so now you got the key
[32:22] even though he came through the wound he
[32:24] never came by the instrumentality
[32:27] of the wound of mankind
[32:32] he came by creation
[32:35] there wasn't any
[32:37] act to bring the egg down you can ball
[32:40] i'll give you volumes of the books where
[32:43] the doctor says go ahead
[32:47] stay a dummy
[32:49] i don't like to talk like that but it
[32:51] gets you gets you to thinking a little
[32:55] you've got to have a sensible answer
[32:58] somewhere in the word of god for all of
[33:00] our things
[33:02] or else where are we left
[33:05] right
[33:09] see that's why it would be the seed of
[33:11] the woman i tried my best to preach that
[33:13] to you
[33:14] he said a woman don't have no seed
[33:15] that's right she was given a seed
[33:20] she wasn't just giving a sperm
[33:24] it hurt supply the egg
[33:27] no that would have been the pollution of
[33:29] the wound
[33:33] the polluting of the wound was the
[33:35] intercourse
[33:37] between eve and the beast
[33:43] right
[33:45] come on i know i'm playing but get the
[33:47] point
[33:53] see then jesus christ would could in no
[33:55] way come from a polluted wound
[34:02] see when you stay wound
[34:04] people are only looking
[34:07] at the external
[34:09] genital
[34:12] come on
[34:15] that is not the wound of a woman
[34:21] come on
[34:22] somebody get a little sense and start
[34:24] thinking
[34:31] that's external parts
[34:37] then jesus could come through the
[34:39] external parts of a woman and not be
[34:41] polluted
[34:44] but everybody else
[34:47] no matter who they are
[34:48] is going to come by intercourse
[34:53] and that's coming from the wound
[34:55] within the wound of mary with egg and
[34:58] sperm put together
[35:02] there's no physical intercourse today in
[35:04] in a test tube baby right
[35:09] a test tube baby is not like we talk
[35:11] about
[35:12] the test tube baby is what outside the
[35:14] body even from another person taken
[35:18] place within the body
[35:22] has nothing to do with no connection to
[35:25] the woman whatsoever
[35:28] just placed in her wound
[35:32] so when the egg and sperm was placed in
[35:34] mary's wound
[35:36] she had no
[35:38] relationship to bring it
[35:41] are you following me
[35:45] it would bypass the whole thing it
[35:47] wouldn't be the instrumentality of man
[35:49] it would be as the prophet said the
[35:51] instrumentality of god
[35:55] the instrumentality of god i read to you
[35:59] phase 99 ephesians church 8
[36:01] instrumentality of god is the virgin
[36:03] birth
[36:08] the woman didn't have anything to do
[36:10] with it
[36:13] he just borrowed that
[36:15] you can call it whatever you want to
[36:17] it's hybrid
[36:21] right
[36:24] you see church
[36:27] why can't we believe
[36:31] that as the new birth as a virgin birth
[36:35] was god creating egg and sperm
[36:40] placing it into a borrowed wound
[36:43] why can't we see what the new birth is
[36:47] the new birth is not me and you
[36:49] it's christ
[36:52] it's christ coming and living in us
[36:57] i don't understand how come he does it
[36:59] that way i don't
[37:01] but it's not so beautiful it ties back
[37:03] to the virgin birth
[37:07] that he just uses us
[37:12] we're just the outside external
[37:14] parts
[37:16] of the living god that would come and
[37:18] live with inside of us in our soul
[37:22] and give us eternal life
[37:27] all right
[37:31] but see the wound of a woman can be used
[37:37] it was used to bring forth
[37:42] jesus christ
[37:48] it was used for that it was used to
[37:50] bring forth
[37:52] the seed of the woman which would be
[37:53] jesus christ right
[38:00] and see this heresy because it's given
[38:01] unto her
[38:04] that's why mary read back i mean eve
[38:06] back there when it comes over to about
[38:07] chapter five in genesis
[38:11] it starts talking about it and as it's
[38:13] fixing to come forth with seth she says
[38:15] god hath appointed
[38:17] me another seed instead of abel which
[38:19] came slow
[38:22] all right
[38:24] and she said god hath given me seed that
[38:27] would have been christ
[38:28] the genesis 3 15 would have been
[38:30] standing right there but it had to be in
[38:32] but he didn't do it he said you have to
[38:34] point it
[38:35] appointed is something you put in place
[38:37] of until something comes forth right
[38:41] appointed
[38:43] me a seed
[38:45] it'd be 4 000 years before
[38:48] the real true seat of the woman would
[38:50] come forth
[38:52] and that would be jesus christ
[38:55] see
[39:00] now think about it
[39:05] jesus then would be
[39:08] what we tried to preach there this past
[39:09] sunday
[39:10] and been on for 40 something years
[39:16] that jesus christ was not of this old
[39:18] race
[39:22] he wasn't just a man as they're
[39:23] preaching today and said he was just a
[39:25] man until the river jordan come and then
[39:27] when the river jordan comes he become
[39:29] god
[39:33] that's a prevalent doctrine a doctrine
[39:34] among the message people today
[39:37] but how can it be because my bible said
[39:39] he was born emmanuel which is god with
[39:42] us
[39:44] the prophet said he was born lord to
[39:45] christ the scripture says it
[39:49] but you see church
[39:51] we get some kind of an idea or a thought
[39:52] and it sounds beautiful
[39:57] like i told you cain and abel probably
[40:00] 20 years old
[40:01] when they got ready to make their
[40:02] sacrifices whatever age you want to put
[40:04] them okay adulthood
[40:07] whatever it was long time
[40:09] before they got there
[40:12] and here's abel offering a blood
[40:14] sacrifice
[40:15] but here's cain offering fruit
[40:18] which his mama taught him was
[40:20] what took place
[40:23] somebody taught him
[40:27] the prophet said she still thinks she's
[40:29] right
[40:31] why because she said i've gotten a man
[40:33] from the lord
[40:35] well you know she did
[40:36] because only god can create
[40:39] all right
[40:40] now but think about it
[40:44] think about what happened in mary
[40:48] and then we can see the day that we're
[40:49] living
[40:52] because it's it's
[40:53] it's going to be odd in a minute when
[40:54] you see me switch
[40:56] and look like going another direction
[40:58] but just remember this is the background
[41:00] look at number three what the prophet
[41:02] said on the future home of the heavenly
[41:03] bridegroom the earthly bride 1964 8002
[41:08] remember that the holy ghost descended
[41:10] on jesus
[41:13] which jesus was a part of the earth why
[41:15] the germ of god the life of god was
[41:17] designed
[41:18] in the wound of a woman
[41:22] right
[41:23] that right
[41:24] which was the earth
[41:26] all right
[41:27] and then the life of god came in so
[41:29] he was the beginning of the creation of
[41:32] god hmm
[41:37] see and then that blood of god that was
[41:39] dire by that germ when it was shed at
[41:41] calvary dropped back upon the earth what
[41:43] far to redeem the earth now it's been
[41:45] justified and been sanctified
[41:48] called and claimed now it's to receive
[41:50] its baptism of fire to be cleansed
[41:52] for jesus and his bride he's talking
[41:54] about the future home right but he's
[41:56] talking about the beginning of the
[41:58] creation of god
[42:02] you mean god began
[42:04] probably said he began in the wound of a
[42:05] woman
[42:09] he created a body of melchizedek stepped
[42:11] into it walked down through the darkness
[42:12] but just took it back out
[42:17] jesus wasn't that way
[42:20] he was the beginning of the creation of
[42:21] god according to revelations 3 14.
[42:24] that's the message to this age
[42:28] then being the beginning of the creation
[42:30] of god
[42:31] who was that standing there
[42:36] according to hebrews 5
[42:39] a body thou has prepared me
[42:41] so we know how the body came from the
[42:43] virgin mary
[42:44] by virgin birth
[42:46] right
[42:48] no man him instrumentality or anything
[42:51] else with it god created
[42:54] in the wound of mary
[42:56] the egg the sperm to bring forth the
[42:59] body
[43:00] then god himself stepped into that body
[43:05] right soul and spirit of almighty god
[43:07] who was that standing on earth the bible
[43:09] says it was god
[43:12] emmanuel god with us
[43:15] so the soul and spirit of almighty god
[43:17] entered that baby when it was born
[43:20] that's why your prophet will say
[43:22] little jehovah
[43:24] crying in a cradle he said little
[43:26] jehovah
[43:28] with no teeth
[43:32] who was that it was god almighty
[43:35] dwelling in a human vessel
[43:37] that's why the bible said god was in
[43:39] christ reconciling the world unto
[43:41] himself
[43:43] in him it says dwell what
[43:46] the body of jesus in that body dwelt
[43:48] what the fullness of the godhead bodily
[43:51] where's any other god
[43:54] see satan's telling people a lot of lies
[44:02] i thank god for not really have a
[44:03] thanksgiving
[44:05] thankfulness
[44:06] for the truth
[44:09] to be able to see the truth
[44:11] all right
[44:13] but see the life of god came in
[44:16] to that vessel that was created he said
[44:20] designed in the wound of a woman
[44:24] the life of god came into that
[44:28] body when it was dropped forth from mary
[44:31] and he was called the beginning of the
[44:32] creation of god
[44:36] no longer dealing by ways of mankind he
[44:39] says in the church age book
[44:43] this is not the old race he said made
[44:46] over
[44:46] or it would not be calling the new race
[44:49] or the beginning of the creation of god
[44:52] jesus christ was what god wanted in the
[44:55] beginning
[44:57] he had the example of adam
[45:01] because there stood adam with eternal
[45:02] life
[45:05] dwelling in a mortal body
[45:07] because his body was not eternal
[45:13] god wanted to come down and dwell with
[45:15] mankind but before he could do it sin
[45:17] entered the picture
[45:20] right
[45:22] the pollution came
[45:25] but then he would be the beginning of
[45:27] the creation
[45:30] he would start a new creation
[45:36] not on the old
[45:39] as i said adam was the closest but
[45:40] before he could anything could happen in
[45:43] any way
[45:46] he already was gone
[45:48] like wade said he caught it the other
[45:49] day when that's preaching about it
[45:51] see the tree of life was standing in the
[45:53] garden
[45:55] right
[45:56] is that scripture
[45:58] the tree of life was in the garden well
[46:00] there was no way mankind could partake
[46:02] of that tree of life once he had failed
[46:04] so god had to put him out of the garden
[46:07] or else he'd partake of that tree of
[46:08] life the bible said and live forever
[46:11] doesn't say he'd live eternal and live
[46:13] forever
[46:14] well you can't make an eternal sinner
[46:19] but you just think god waited 4 000
[46:22] years
[46:24] to really bring into being
[46:28] himself in a human race
[46:32] that's what he wanted in the beginning
[46:35] did not the prophet say he created us or
[46:36] fellowship
[46:38] that's right
[46:39] he could come down in the garden and
[46:40] fellowship with adam and eve but he knew
[46:42] they were going to fall
[46:47] now come on folks i think it's about
[46:48] time we grow up
[46:51] we raised three kids and i think it
[46:53] turned out to be good kids but i knew
[46:55] all along that they were not angels
[47:01] now you think your kids are angels
[47:05] you got a problem
[47:08] a mental problem
[47:10] right
[47:12] because no matter how good or whatever
[47:13] we think they are they are kids
[47:17] right
[47:20] kids will come around sometimes and
[47:21] they'll say
[47:22] daddy we didn't tell you about this you
[47:24] didn't have to tell me
[47:27] it's kids
[47:29] they always say preachers kids worst of
[47:31] all
[47:33] right
[47:37] why because they're deceiving
[47:40] the others just go out and do the wrong
[47:42] don't worry about it
[47:44] preachers kids try to make you look good
[47:46] no daddy gonna beat him to death
[47:49] with his mouth there's nothing else
[47:52] but just be honest
[47:55] god knew when he put man in the garden
[47:59] and gave him free moral agency
[48:02] that he would go wrong
[48:06] is that sensible does that need a great
[48:07] revelation to understand
[48:10] this plain sense
[48:12] he knew what his children were going to
[48:14] do
[48:16] all right
[48:18] but he knew one day
[48:21] as i said when he's when he come forth
[48:23] there in genesis 1 uh 3 15 he said i
[48:27] will put enmity between thy seed and the
[48:30] seed of the woman
[48:32] he didn't wait till abraham came to make
[48:33] an unconditional covenant i gave you the
[48:35] quotes from the prophet when adam failed
[48:38] god came forth with an unconditional
[48:40] covenant
[48:42] i will put enmity
[48:45] but it'll take me four thousand years
[48:46] before i can get it here and until that
[48:48] time comes you're going to be bound
[48:49] under satan's domain
[48:53] and physically speaking we're still in
[48:55] satan's domain
[48:57] but by the baptism of the holy ghost the
[48:59] eternal life in our soul
[49:01] we're in the domain of god
[49:04] god's children
[49:06] god's offspring
[49:09] all right
[49:10] that's why i love this quote i'd like to
[49:12] give it to you
[49:13] all right look at number four
[49:17] because we just read now he's the
[49:19] beginning of the creation of god
[49:22] now what about it
[49:23] this is proving his word 1964 806
[49:26] paragraph 146
[49:28] so he god came down after going through
[49:30] this and now every son that you eat and
[49:33] born of a natural sexual birth the way
[49:35] you come
[49:36] and when it comes to a place to where
[49:38] you go through water baptism
[49:41] right
[49:43] in the holy ghost baptism
[49:45] then the holy ghost comes down to fire
[49:46] baptism and claims its creation
[49:50] you know what you he's talking of a
[49:51] twofold thing come on he's talking to
[49:53] the world he's talking of us
[49:56] right
[49:57] the same as it did him in the holy ghost
[49:59] and god is the self-saying spirit see it
[50:02] comes down and claims this body for the
[50:04] resurrection
[50:06] i got a little bit on i'll get to it
[50:08] lord willing sunday
[50:11] but he was raised for our justification
[50:12] all the father has given me will come
[50:14] not one will be lost i'll raise it up in
[50:17] the last days not one hire the head will
[50:19] ever perish
[50:21] that is the beginning of the creation of
[50:23] god
[50:24] this is what
[50:27] the continuation of the creation of god
[50:34] by him
[50:36] coming
[50:39] he made a way
[50:42] that there would be more because when it
[50:44] says the beginning of the creation
[50:47] remember that means there's got to be
[50:49] something else come forth because why
[50:51] would he say beginning of it
[50:52] you just say the creation of god
[50:55] but when you say the beginning of the
[50:57] creation of god
[51:01] that means there's more coming
[51:05] and the more coming is the bride of
[51:07] jesus christ
[51:09] by the new birth in our soul
[51:12] not our bodies not our spirit they're
[51:14] still in the old domain
[51:18] but the soul of the individual that
[51:20] center him whether you want to call it
[51:22] spirit or whether you want to call it
[51:23] soul
[51:24] just remember the centerium has only one
[51:26] sense it's either faith or doubt the
[51:28] second realm has
[51:30] memory reason conscious affections
[51:31] whatever you want to call it spirit or
[51:33] soul wherever you want to change it the
[51:35] body has seat takes field smell in here
[51:39] but that inner being of us by the new
[51:41] birth
[51:43] makes us part of that creation
[51:47] what creation then he was the beginning
[51:49] of it
[51:51] adam was not the beginning of the
[51:53] creation of god
[51:56] that's why the bible says that jesus
[51:58] christ is the only begotten
[52:02] of the father is that scripture
[52:06] adam was created
[52:09] jesus was begotten why because he was
[52:12] god
[52:13] begotten in human flesh
[52:17] god came down to live in human flesh
[52:20] but he couldn't just choose somebody to
[52:22] drop in them
[52:25] and he couldn't create
[52:27] a body
[52:29] and just jump into it as a full grown
[52:32] because it would not be our brother
[52:34] melchizedek was god in human flesh right
[52:37] but that flesh was a creation and it
[52:39] went right back out of existence
[52:43] he could not die for our sins as
[52:44] melchizedek
[52:49] he had to come to be our brother he had
[52:51] to become to be our kinsmen redeemer
[52:54] right
[52:56] to pay the price
[52:58] all right
[53:02] but we are the continuation of that
[53:05] creation
[53:09] i was trying to tell you there the other
[53:10] day
[53:11] see we think god created in the garden
[53:13] and he just quit
[53:16] he created the world he created the
[53:18] birds he created animal degree he
[53:20] created man and he quit show me that in
[53:21] the bible
[53:26] he never quit creating
[53:29] he only stopped creating the natural
[53:32] human part
[53:36] but he come down and created
[53:39] the egg and the sperm that his body
[53:41] would come from that he could step into
[53:43] and be my brother
[53:44] he's still creating you know why he's
[53:46] still creating if we're the continuation
[53:48] of that creation he must still be
[53:50] creating
[53:52] what's he creating
[53:54] his own family
[53:57] his own children
[54:00] paul on mars hill
[54:01] said that unknown god that you're
[54:03] talking about i'd like to talk to you
[54:05] about him did you even say
[54:07] your own poets say we are his offspring
[54:10] and he says that's what we are
[54:15] we are the offspring of god
[54:19] we're the rest of the creation
[54:21] amen
[54:23] god created a human
[54:26] super race
[54:29] that's all these ninja turtles and all
[54:31] of these things like that and all these
[54:33] you know
[54:34] mortal kombats and all that
[54:38] don't worry about it bullet between the
[54:39] eyes stop any of them
[54:42] right
[54:44] how many they can say oh man i know
[54:45] karate
[54:47] the fellow said i know collud ranks too
[54:52] ain't never seen a karate person yet
[54:54] that could tackle the bullet coming
[54:56] straight between the eyes
[54:59] brother harris used to tell about the
[55:00] guy you know he got so big up in it he
[55:02] thought he was
[55:03] he just get in the line or a
[55:05] tiger or line one
[55:08] he just man he just went in
[55:10] well they found a few pieces of him left
[55:16] do you think well we just shoot for rice
[55:19] that ain't even super to nothing
[55:23] i've always believed david and him
[55:25] knowed all about karate
[55:27] well you believe it or not i don't know
[55:29] but you mean a man who would tackle a
[55:31] lion or a bear
[55:32] i know it's the christ come on
[55:35] i know too they weren't afraid
[55:38] and all they carried was a big old stick
[55:41] right
[55:43] they take that stick and just whoop
[55:44] somebody death with it
[55:46] all right but i'm talking about a super
[55:49] race a prophet called a super
[55:51] church
[55:52] a bride when she realizes who she is
[55:56] and what she's here for
[56:00] right but think about it now
[56:05] okay
[56:06] now we're going to swap horses now for a
[56:07] second let you think
[56:11] we'll be swapping
[56:12] but just a little cough to put in for
[56:14] you to think about
[56:17] and we read over in the book of
[56:18] revelations 5
[56:22] that
[56:23] there was one sitting on the throne
[56:27] in a book
[56:29] a book singular
[56:33] was in the hands of the one sitting on
[56:34] the throne in his right hand right
[56:39] now
[56:40] what kind of a book is that
[56:46] and i hope you're going to be able to
[56:48] tie this together with the beginning of
[56:49] the creation of god in the continuation
[56:51] of the creation of god and see who we
[56:52] really are
[56:54] is what i'm trying to do okay
[56:58] but over in revelations 20
[57:01] and about 11 and 12
[57:04] it speaks of the whites on judgment
[57:07] and it says at that white throne
[57:08] judgment that there were books
[57:12] and the book of life
[57:16] over in daniel
[57:17] um 10 9 or 10 10 i think it is
[57:21] i got it in here in a minute and i catch
[57:22] up with
[57:24] myself daniel saw
[57:27] the judgment
[57:28] and he saw books
[57:32] but in the book of revelation you only
[57:33] saw one book
[57:34] i mean revelation 5 1.
[57:38] one book
[57:42] what kind of a book was that
[57:44] that was in the hand of the one sitting
[57:46] on the throne
[57:51] what kind of a book
[57:53] according to number five brother which
[57:54] is
[57:56] the breach between the church ages and
[57:58] the seals
[57:59] paragraph 116.
[58:02] now
[58:03] oh my
[58:05] now the forfeited title deed
[58:08] is now in the hands of the original
[58:11] owner almighty god
[58:15] now
[58:16] the forfeited title deed
[58:18] you go back a little bit in the message
[58:20] there and you'll find brother random
[58:22] explaining that
[58:24] adam fell from eternal life
[58:30] and he forfeited his right
[58:32] to eternal life
[58:34] he had eternal life in his soul i don't
[58:36] believe he lost that
[58:37] some do but that's all right that's your
[58:38] business it's not mine
[58:41] i just don't see you can be given
[58:42] eternal life to be taken away from you i
[58:44] don't care who you are
[58:45] right
[58:46] because when enoch walked off the earth
[58:48] he's not going to have to walk back down
[58:49] somewhere because he ain't bright
[58:51] or fall out of heaven and come back down
[58:52] to earth and start over again see
[58:56] but adam
[58:58] lost the right the prophet said of
[59:00] eternal life
[59:02] and the earth he says
[59:07] he lost the fact that he never received
[59:09] eternal life in his flesh
[59:13] right
[59:14] he never come to that
[59:16] he didn't make it that far sin entered
[59:17] the picture
[59:19] but you know what somebody if he had it
[59:20] somebody one of these days is going to
[59:22] have that and we see jesus christ
[59:24] fulfilling exactly all of the things the
[59:26] prophet said that adam lost jesus christ
[59:28] restored and the restorer meant he
[59:31] walked through him first
[59:33] right
[59:35] he came to earth live died went to hell
[59:37] paid the price come up
[59:39] raised up the same body then he went up
[59:41] the rapture
[59:43] so jesus christ went through all of the
[59:45] things that adam could have lost
[59:47] all right
[59:48] but think about it now
[59:51] so the title deed didn't go back to
[59:52] satan
[59:55] he doesn't have any of those things
[59:58] where would he have it
[1:00:01] because you can't go over the book of
[1:00:01] revelation find satan sitting on the
[1:00:03] throne with a book in his hand
[1:00:06] it was god sitting on the throne
[1:00:08] so read it
[1:00:10] now the forfeited title deed is now in
[1:00:12] the hands of the original owner
[1:00:15] almighty god
[1:00:17] the title deed to the earth and to
[1:00:18] eternal life when adam forfeited it then
[1:00:21] satan's dirty hands could not take it
[1:00:25] so it went back to its original owner
[1:00:28] that's wonderful that's my thanksgiving
[1:00:32] god himself
[1:00:36] who's the original owner god himself
[1:00:37] we're going to find it just in a minute
[1:00:39] mary sits on the throne with it in his
[1:00:41] hand
[1:00:42] the title deed
[1:00:44] oh that makes me feel religious friends
[1:00:46] the title deed to eternal life abstract
[1:00:48] title deed to eternal life
[1:00:51] when adam forfeited for the wisdom for
[1:00:54] wisdom
[1:00:56] adam forfeited for wisdom
[1:00:59] instead of faith it went back to the
[1:01:01] hands
[1:01:02] of the owner almighty god what a great
[1:01:06] thing all right waiting what's it doing
[1:01:08] in the hands of god waiting for
[1:01:10] redemption claims he made a way of
[1:01:13] redemption he made a way back and
[1:01:15] someday the redeemer is going to take it
[1:01:17] back
[1:01:18] you see where we're getting to now
[1:01:21] see we'll watch this fellow sitting upon
[1:01:23] the throne all right
[1:01:26] so in revelations 5 there's one sitting
[1:01:28] on the throne
[1:01:30] he has a book
[1:01:35] not books
[1:01:37] all right
[1:01:39] so now we've got to come to the right
[1:01:40] understanding of it
[1:01:44] so
[1:01:46] adam forfeited it
[1:01:48] and adam forward it went back to the
[1:01:50] original owner it belongs to him
[1:01:52] in john and division i'm just reading
[1:01:54] number six is which is uh the breach
[1:01:56] which is 148.
[1:01:59] sauna
[1:02:01] ain't just playing with a loud voice
[1:02:02] who's worthy to open the book but loose
[1:02:03] the seals thereof
[1:02:05] god who is that one sitting on the
[1:02:07] throne
[1:02:08] the absolutely
[1:02:10] original holder of the book of life
[1:02:13] he holds it god does when adam forfeited
[1:02:15] it went back to its original owner it
[1:02:17] belongs to him and john and division
[1:02:19] looked over and saw in the right hand of
[1:02:21] him that sets up on the throne what
[1:02:24] the title deed
[1:02:26] of redemption
[1:02:29] all right
[1:02:32] now what kind of a book is that
[1:02:36] and why does it say
[1:02:40] a book in revelation 5.
[1:02:44] but yet in revelation 20 it says books
[1:02:49] daniel that says books
[1:02:52] why
[1:02:57] why does it deal with just
[1:02:58] one book in the hand of the one sitting
[1:03:00] on the throne
[1:03:02] must be a very special book
[1:03:05] all right
[1:03:06] look at the next one
[1:03:09] page 282 67
[1:03:12] the sardisian church age
[1:03:15] to begin with there is no basis for the
[1:03:17] claims that the lamb's book of life
[1:03:20] is not the same as the book of life
[1:03:23] now read with me
[1:03:24] the book of life might be called the
[1:03:26] lounge book of life or christ's book of
[1:03:28] life or even the thy book and book of
[1:03:30] the living
[1:03:33] okay
[1:03:36] now watch what he's saying
[1:03:39] to begin with there's no basis for the
[1:03:40] claim that the lounge book of life
[1:03:44] is not the same as the book of life
[1:03:48] so if it's loud book of life in the book
[1:03:50] of life
[1:03:51] now watch
[1:03:53] the book of life might be called
[1:03:57] so if you get into revelations 20
[1:03:59] and
[1:04:01] 12
[1:04:02] you'll find that it mentions the book of
[1:04:04] life
[1:04:07] right but it mentions books
[1:04:10] all right christ's book of life or even
[1:04:13] the book of book and book of the living
[1:04:16] now watch what he says
[1:04:18] only names are written in it
[1:04:25] what kind of a book is it
[1:04:27] it's a book of names
[1:04:32] right is that sensible it's a book of
[1:04:34] names
[1:04:37] only names are written in it
[1:04:41] see that's why in revelations 5 you're
[1:04:43] only dealing with the lamb's book of
[1:04:45] life eternal sexism
[1:04:52] that's the names of the bride of jesus
[1:04:54] christ because that's revelations 3 uh
[1:04:56] revelations 13 8.
[1:04:59] drew up on the face of earth whose names
[1:05:01] are not written in the book of life of
[1:05:03] the lamb slain from the foundation world
[1:05:05] now the book of life of the lamb slain
[1:05:07] from the foundation of the world
[1:05:09] is the book of redemption
[1:05:11] and only names are contained in it
[1:05:16] only names
[1:05:19] it's the names of the redeemed
[1:05:22] we'll get to it sunday i don't want to
[1:05:23] go into that much of redemption
[1:05:28] we'll come back more to it
[1:05:31] later because i don't want to
[1:05:33] don't want to get too far
[1:05:39] i just want to deal with
[1:05:41] the names
[1:05:44] written in the book of life
[1:05:48] i want to deal with that as
[1:05:52] the rest of this creation
[1:05:57] the bride of christ
[1:06:02] revelations 5
[1:06:04] it's just one book
[1:06:08] it's the book of the lamb that was slain
[1:06:11] from the foundation of the world
[1:06:14] and only names are in it
[1:06:18] you say yeah but brother dale
[1:06:20] yeah that's the books
[1:06:25] even in your quran
[1:06:28] to show how much they can type after
[1:06:31] in the writing of what's his name the
[1:06:33] fellow that come up with all of that
[1:06:39] he has one section written
[1:06:43] then they have another section written
[1:06:46] to kind of deal with life
[1:06:50] but this is the section supposed to be
[1:06:52] the eternal part
[1:06:54] because they're trying to type after god
[1:06:57] and doing his ways
[1:07:01] but think about it
[1:07:05] one beautiful book
[1:07:08] it only contains names
[1:07:11] that's what you're dealing with in
[1:07:12] revelations 5 now when you come to
[1:07:14] revelation 20 you're dealing with books
[1:07:21] all right
[1:07:22] now
[1:07:24] to me there's only one book
[1:07:28] that can be
[1:07:29] put down as to understand
[1:07:32] the book of life
[1:07:35] or understand books
[1:07:37] to come back
[1:07:38] and it's this bible
[1:07:43] it's the word of god i've got the quotes
[1:07:44] right in here
[1:07:46] this bible
[1:07:48] you say well it's john's
[1:07:49] did john see him setting up right with
[1:07:51] the bible in his hand was he the king
[1:07:53] james or what is a scofield or what you
[1:07:55] know who was it
[1:07:57] it's a book of names
[1:08:01] the names of the redeemed
[1:08:06] because remember revelation 5 is the
[1:08:09] calling up and john going up to see it's
[1:08:12] not the white throne judgment
[1:08:14] when you get to the white throne
[1:08:15] judgment of daniel in rome revelation
[1:08:18] you're dealing with books
[1:08:20] plural
[1:08:23] and this bible then has that too
[1:08:27] it has books this is books
[1:08:31] it's a book of names
[1:08:34] but at the same time it tells you about
[1:08:36] all the other things that are happening
[1:08:38] when it talks of moses
[1:08:41] it talks of pharaoh
[1:08:44] it talks to the good
[1:08:46] it talks to the bad
[1:08:49] this bible does right
[1:08:53] within this bible is books
[1:09:02] but yet in this bible is also
[1:09:05] the eternal life section
[1:09:10] that
[1:09:12] contains only the names
[1:09:14] of the redeemed
[1:09:18] we'll get to that sunday it says well
[1:09:19] now wait a minute brother my name i
[1:09:21] can't find my name in the uh in the book
[1:09:24] you know james is in the book
[1:09:26] uh you know samuel's in the book
[1:09:31] i can't find danny
[1:09:36] right
[1:09:38] because it's not written out right
[1:09:43] so it's not just finding samuel in the
[1:09:45] book
[1:09:49] there's got to be more to it than that
[1:09:50] right
[1:09:51] your prophet said it's not the name
[1:09:53] written down
[1:09:54] it's what's going on during the time
[1:09:56] that you're here
[1:09:57] is where your name is in the book we'll
[1:09:59] get to that sunday but
[1:10:00] think about it
[1:10:06] only names in this
[1:10:09] book so what a beautiful book
[1:10:15] look what he goes on to say now in the
[1:10:16] first seal
[1:10:18] number eight
[1:10:21] you see the book actually was planned
[1:10:24] and written
[1:10:25] before the foundation of the world
[1:10:31] now if you don't believe in
[1:10:32] predestination before knowledge you sure
[1:10:33] got lost
[1:10:35] but by predestination before knowledge
[1:10:36] he could understand about pharaoh being
[1:10:38] in the
[1:10:39] you can understand about him being
[1:10:40] written in the bible because he's going
[1:10:41] to be come to earth
[1:10:43] and make his own choice
[1:10:46] but think about it
[1:10:48] you see the book actually was written
[1:10:50] planned and written before the
[1:10:51] foundation this book the bible was
[1:10:53] really written before the foundation of
[1:10:55] the world
[1:10:57] what
[1:10:58] and christ being the lamb was slain
[1:11:00] before the foundation of the world
[1:11:02] and the members of his bride their names
[1:11:03] were put in the lounge book of life
[1:11:05] before the foundation of the world
[1:11:07] but it's been sealed up
[1:11:09] and now it's being revealed whose names
[1:11:11] were in there
[1:11:13] all about it what a great thing
[1:11:15] and john when he saw it he said
[1:11:17] everything in heaven everything
[1:11:19] underneath the earth
[1:11:20] everything heard him saying amen and
[1:11:22] blessings and honor he just really was
[1:11:24] having a great time
[1:11:26] for the lamb was worthy
[1:11:28] all right so that's revelation 5 right
[1:11:32] so john you know he was crying and
[1:11:34] weeping because nobody was worthy to
[1:11:35] take the book and then the elder spoke
[1:11:37] and said john said the line is worthy
[1:11:41] well then when the lion walked out it
[1:11:43] was a lamb
[1:11:45] right
[1:11:46] to take away the sin of the world
[1:11:49] but then see
[1:11:51] if my name was ever written we'll get to
[1:11:53] it more later
[1:11:55] well let's go ahead and read the next
[1:11:56] one
[1:11:57] let's let brother branham answer it
[1:11:59] number nine
[1:12:01] paragraph 112 of
[1:12:03] questions and answers on the sealed 63
[1:12:06] 3 24 in the morning
[1:12:09] brother branham is the lounge book of
[1:12:10] life
[1:12:12] in the book of life the same book
[1:12:18] sure
[1:12:22] because that's where all all redemptions
[1:12:24] wrote in this book what books they talk
[1:12:26] about bible
[1:12:28] right
[1:12:29] their names are in you say well our
[1:12:32] names put on the land book of life
[1:12:33] brother branham
[1:12:35] i got it put on the other night
[1:12:39] no you didn't
[1:12:41] no you didn't
[1:12:45] come on
[1:12:47] you just found out
[1:12:48] it was on there
[1:12:50] the other night
[1:12:54] see because their names were written
[1:12:56] before the foundation of the world
[1:12:58] that's
[1:12:59] it's all the same book
[1:13:02] the loud book of life in the book of
[1:13:03] life is the same book
[1:13:06] but what is it then
[1:13:10] is it two books
[1:13:13] or is it one book
[1:13:18] the book is in the hand of the one
[1:13:19] sitting on the throne
[1:13:20] only contains names
[1:13:23] and only deals with one book
[1:13:27] but at the white throne judgment you're
[1:13:29] dealing with books
[1:13:32] one of them is the book of life
[1:13:35] the other one is the book of our lives
[1:13:40] come on we'll read what the prophet had
[1:13:41] to say about it
[1:13:43] but
[1:13:44] lock that in until sunday
[1:13:46] you just found out it was on there the
[1:13:49] other night
[1:13:56] you just found it out how'd you find it
[1:13:59] okay
[1:14:02] look the next one
[1:14:03] let's see what the prophet has to say
[1:14:05] about this
[1:14:07] works is faith express 1965 11 26
[1:14:10] paragraph 119
[1:14:12] just like last night speaking when you
[1:14:14] get the book
[1:14:15] you're going to see maybe a little
[1:14:17] confusion
[1:14:18] there what i said
[1:14:21] the two books of life
[1:14:26] watch him
[1:14:27] it's the same book
[1:14:30] you're back to one
[1:14:33] right
[1:14:37] but one of them is your natural birth
[1:14:44] you say my natural birth is not in the
[1:14:46] book paul said
[1:14:47] and such were some of us and this that
[1:14:49] and the other and he said we all had our
[1:14:50] times in the past in the world and the
[1:14:53] things
[1:14:54] a lot written in the bible about you and
[1:14:56] i and how lost we were
[1:14:59] right
[1:15:02] it's the same book but one of them is
[1:15:04] your natural birth the other one is your
[1:15:06] spiritual birth
[1:15:08] now i love this one one leads out to the
[1:15:11] other one
[1:15:14] here was saul
[1:15:17] killing the christians
[1:15:20] right
[1:15:21] wrote up in the bible the book
[1:15:24] but then the same man
[1:15:26] becomes
[1:15:27] a preacher of the gospel
[1:15:31] wrote up in the same bible
[1:15:35] so the bible does show our natural birth
[1:15:39] and it shows our spiritual birth
[1:15:41] right right so it's not two books
[1:15:44] like
[1:15:45] you know
[1:15:46] me hold up the bible in one hand and the
[1:15:48] notebook the other two books
[1:15:51] because that's what it sounds like when
[1:15:52] you're in the church age book because
[1:15:54] that's what he's referring to
[1:15:55] he's referring back to the invisible
[1:15:57] union
[1:15:59] right
[1:16:02] but it's not two books it's the same
[1:16:04] book but one of them is your natural
[1:16:05] birth the other one is your spiritual
[1:16:07] birth one leads out to the other just
[1:16:08] like a stalk of wheat whenever you talk
[1:16:10] to me you talk to me as a living person
[1:16:12] but there's a part of me here
[1:16:14] is that person that must perish
[1:16:17] that's the book that the name comes off
[1:16:20] of
[1:16:22] but the eternal one the predestinated
[1:16:25] one the elected one the name never can
[1:16:28] come from
[1:16:29] there because it all was always on it
[1:16:34] it can never be taken off
[1:16:36] you'll notice it in the book
[1:16:39] so to save your confusion you'll find it
[1:16:41] that way because i think brother vale
[1:16:43] who put the right grammar to it reminded
[1:16:46] me of it today i said that's right so
[1:16:48] he's referring back to the church age
[1:16:49] book
[1:16:50] in the church age book it sounds like
[1:16:52] there's two books but if you'll go back
[1:16:53] to the church age book
[1:16:56] you'll find i'll give it to you in just
[1:16:57] a minute
[1:16:58] he speaks of two sections
[1:17:02] he speaks of sections of the book
[1:17:05] but i'm just trying to get a point to
[1:17:06] you
[1:17:08] look at the next one taking the
[1:17:09] invisible union of the bride of jesus
[1:17:11] christ
[1:17:12] 65 11 25.
[1:17:15] there is your two books
[1:17:18] one of them is the lounge book of life
[1:17:20] your name on there is predestinated on
[1:17:22] there
[1:17:23] it can't go because you can no more take
[1:17:25] that away than nothing see because it
[1:17:28] was for ordained to be on there
[1:17:31] but the regular book of life
[1:17:34] you can take that off at any time see
[1:17:37] you don't repent it's off anyhow
[1:17:40] because you're going to stand the
[1:17:41] judgment the bride don't even stand the
[1:17:43] judgment it goes in the rapture
[1:17:46] so now think about it
[1:17:48] is it two books
[1:17:49] no
[1:17:51] it's one book so wonderfully written
[1:17:56] until it contains
[1:17:58] our lives as sinners
[1:18:01] and what we were
[1:18:04] and it contains our lives as christians
[1:18:08] and part of this new creation new race
[1:18:10] the prophet spoke of
[1:18:13] you remember that new creation new race
[1:18:17] go to your church age book and read a
[1:18:19] little bit you'll find it
[1:18:20] i'll be glad to have you after service
[1:18:22] to find it for you
[1:18:24] but think about it
[1:18:25] so if you think he was all messed up in
[1:18:27] this church age book
[1:18:30] he said that's where you'd misunderstand
[1:18:32] so let's read something from the church
[1:18:33] age book look at number 12.
[1:18:36] this is page 283 of the sardisian church
[1:18:39] age which is church age book
[1:18:41] now then the record of this wheat plant
[1:18:43] whose end is to be to reproduce the
[1:18:45] original seed in multiplied form is the
[1:18:47] book of life
[1:18:49] i repeat the history or record of this
[1:18:51] sweet plant is the book of life which is
[1:18:53] a part of the book of life listen which
[1:18:55] a part of the book of life
[1:18:57] is the record of eternal life
[1:19:01] a section of the book of life
[1:19:08] there's a section of this bible
[1:19:11] so wonderful to me
[1:19:13] that talks about eternal life
[1:19:19] it tells us what we are
[1:19:22] right
[1:19:23] tells us as we've read in romans now
[1:19:25] what 41 times
[1:19:29] those who he foreknew he did
[1:19:30] predestinate
[1:19:34] those he predestinated he called knows
[1:19:36] he called he's already justified already
[1:19:39] right
[1:19:41] but you know in this same book i find my
[1:19:43] life
[1:19:48] but you see the way that we used to be
[1:19:51] i stay the way we used to be
[1:19:54] before we heard of this message
[1:19:56] do you know what we've done
[1:19:58] we took this book and read it to find
[1:20:01] out how bad we were
[1:20:05] and they scared us to death with how bad
[1:20:07] we were
[1:20:08] and they threatened us with eternal
[1:20:10] hells and
[1:20:11] all forms of things
[1:20:13] from this book
[1:20:16] and told us how bad we were until the
[1:20:18] prophet one day said it like this
[1:20:21] when he was quoting the scriptures there
[1:20:22] in in acts where it said men and
[1:20:25] brethren what must we do to be saved
[1:20:29] you know what your prophet said
[1:20:31] we tell them a book of rules we tell
[1:20:34] them to quit this we tell them to quit
[1:20:35] that we tell them to quit he said they
[1:20:37] didn't ask what to do
[1:20:40] they asked what could they do to be
[1:20:41] saved he said we tell them what to do
[1:20:46] trying to make them say by book of rules
[1:20:51] you know that's what i'm saying right
[1:20:53] whether you admit it or not
[1:20:54] you preachers especially out there that
[1:20:56] are listening
[1:20:57] you know that when we as an organized
[1:20:59] religion all we used the bible was for
[1:21:01] to beat people to death about it try to
[1:21:03] scare them into hell
[1:21:05] you know out of hell to try to get them
[1:21:07] to heaven
[1:21:11] we preached a bunch of do's and don'ts
[1:21:13] and this and that and the other oh if
[1:21:14] you live in good method this doctrine if
[1:21:16] you're living good when you die remember
[1:21:19] the message that says you're in you're
[1:21:20] out there down you're in the up and down
[1:21:22] if you know the doctor if you die while
[1:21:23] you saved you okay if you die where you
[1:21:25] lost shane that's methodist doctrine
[1:21:29] well where to get that they thought they
[1:21:30] got out of the book where's that in the
[1:21:31] book
[1:21:33] but see when we come in this message
[1:21:35] and begin to hear what the prophet had
[1:21:38] to say
[1:21:39] and to show us the scriptures
[1:21:42] at least my thinking changed
[1:21:44] from a book of rules
[1:21:47] to a revelation
[1:21:49] of the person of jesus christ
[1:21:53] living in his
[1:21:54] life through you and i
[1:21:56] and giving us a new birth
[1:21:59] talking about where'd you ever hear a
[1:22:01] denominational person talk about an
[1:22:03] unconditional covenant
[1:22:06] come on i want one where is he one out
[1:22:09] they didn't talk about unconditional
[1:22:10] they talked about conditions
[1:22:15] we see this prophet come along talking
[1:22:17] about an unconditional covenant
[1:22:20] and just remember
[1:22:23] in case you don't believe it that way
[1:22:25] which came first grace or law
[1:22:29] come on grace came first
[1:22:35] grace was in the garden of god killing
[1:22:37] those animals grace was in the garden of
[1:22:40] promising not to kill them
[1:22:44] grace was first
[1:22:47] law was added because of mankind that
[1:22:50] wanted a book of rules
[1:22:56] you see the reason i'm saying that right
[1:22:57] back up above that quote
[1:23:00] his wife brother brandon said there's
[1:23:02] your two books he said because
[1:23:04] denominations had done this to us
[1:23:11] they set us into a stage now until
[1:23:13] people want to know what to be saying
[1:23:15] quit drinking quit smoking quit chewing
[1:23:17] come to church pay your tithe make sure
[1:23:19] you pay your time
[1:23:21] that's number one
[1:23:22] you know
[1:23:26] because you as long as you pay your
[1:23:28] tithe you can live like the devil and
[1:23:29] they're going to preach you into heaven
[1:23:30] when you die right
[1:23:33] come on
[1:23:36] you ever heard anybody lately preached
[1:23:38] to hell
[1:23:39] you know preached over a body and he
[1:23:40] died and went to hell
[1:23:42] i've never heard one all 73 years old
[1:23:44] i've never heard no preacher then that
[1:23:46] person died and went to hell you
[1:23:50] no everybody's going to heaven my
[1:23:52] brother stephen wilson said they're
[1:23:53] going to do away with hell
[1:23:55] does ain't nobody there anymore
[1:23:58] well i don't think that's right do you
[1:24:02] ain't nobody in hell no more
[1:24:04] everybody's in heaven
[1:24:08] you don't have to do away with hell then
[1:24:10] but here's the last one i want you to
[1:24:12] get because i want to make sure to seal
[1:24:13] it in your mind
[1:24:16] and see what this book i'm talking about
[1:24:17] really is because this is taken from the
[1:24:19] invisible union of the bride of christ
[1:24:21] 65 11 25 or f308
[1:24:25] there is your name on the book of life
[1:24:26] the book of life is the word of god
[1:24:32] because the word the word is god and god
[1:24:34] is the only thing that is life so your
[1:24:36] name was represented in the bible
[1:24:38] before the bible became onward
[1:24:44] and if you're here to do that won't it
[1:24:46] vindicate
[1:24:48] that word
[1:24:51] won't the church vindicate itself won't
[1:24:53] malachi 4 and all these other things
[1:24:55] perfectly perfectly vindicate itself and
[1:24:58] show that's that's what it is
[1:25:01] the bible
[1:25:05] can be in the hand of the one sitting on
[1:25:06] the throne
[1:25:08] but all we're concerned about of that
[1:25:10] part
[1:25:11] is names written in that book
[1:25:15] when it goes over with daniel in
[1:25:18] revelations
[1:25:19] at the white throne
[1:25:21] it becomes books
[1:25:24] but there's not many books it's just
[1:25:25] still the same book
[1:25:28] this bible tells us
[1:25:30] of our life and journey of mankind
[1:25:32] through this world
[1:25:35] it tells you where you're going and
[1:25:37] tells you what was going to happen to us
[1:25:42] it tells us about jesus christ the seed
[1:25:44] of the woman
[1:25:46] but it also tells us about the seed of
[1:25:48] the serpent
[1:25:51] paul said in corinthians what is it 13 3
[1:25:54] is that where it is one yeah where he
[1:25:57] said bless through the sin this the
[1:26:00] sceptility of satan like he did eve
[1:26:03] corrupts your minds from the simplicity
[1:26:05] that is in christ jesus
[1:26:09] you think brother dale preaches deep i
[1:26:10] preach very very very simple
[1:26:13] but it just takes a simple mind to
[1:26:15] understand it and a simple mind is the
[1:26:17] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:26:23] so if you have trouble understanding me
[1:26:26] why don't you pray to god
[1:26:29] and say god help me
[1:26:32] to understand
[1:26:35] what could be more simple
[1:26:37] than to reveal than the fact of jesus
[1:26:39] christ
[1:26:40] living in each one of our hearts and our
[1:26:41] lives
[1:26:45] what could be more simple than the plan
[1:26:47] of salvation
[1:26:51] that it took god to come down
[1:26:54] i love that quote i gave you the other
[1:26:56] day where brother brown says they
[1:26:58] started out of the garden
[1:27:02] they started out of the garden said god
[1:27:04] said because of love in his heart
[1:27:07] he said i love you and no matter what
[1:27:09] you've done
[1:27:10] i'm going with you
[1:27:13] he never stayed in the garden he come
[1:27:15] right out of that garden to live with
[1:27:17] you and i down through time
[1:27:19] to make sure everything works right
[1:27:23] he's not up in heaven today everybody
[1:27:24] wants to go to heaven where god is god's
[1:27:26] not in heaven he's in your heart
[1:27:31] why can't we believe it come on
[1:27:32] musicians going brother
[1:27:36] what kind of a book is it a wonderful
[1:27:38] book
[1:27:40] that the bible can be all that i've
[1:27:41] spoke of
[1:27:45] it can be our condemnation unto death
[1:27:48] but it also can be our deliverance
[1:27:51] unto eternal life
[1:27:54] all from one book
[1:27:59] there's not a book in the world could
[1:28:00] answer to that
[1:28:02] except the bible
[1:28:05] he said well my name's not in the bible
[1:28:08] don't look for it like that look at
[1:28:10] what's going on to the day you're living
[1:28:12] now i don't see martin luther in the
[1:28:14] bible
[1:28:15] never read it view
[1:28:17] but you know one day
[1:28:21] he brought a message of the just shall
[1:28:22] live by faith
[1:28:24] that was his name in the book
[1:28:29] have you saying your name in the book
[1:28:33] that's the question i'm asking for
[1:28:34] sunday
[1:28:36] have you seen your name in the book
[1:28:40] well brother dave i don't know how to
[1:28:41] find my name well then
[1:28:45] we might or to listen
[1:28:48] to see
[1:28:50] because if it's that's wonderful a book
[1:28:52] it's got to have everything in there
[1:28:58] it shows the birth of the antichrist
[1:29:01] it shows the birth of jesus christ
[1:29:05] and the bride has got to give birth to
[1:29:07] christ
[1:29:10] to conquer the antichrist
[1:29:14] abstract title deed
[1:29:18] an abstract
[1:29:20] you don't have abstracts for your
[1:29:21] property
[1:29:22] no matter how much you think you got
[1:29:25] you you don't have an abstract
[1:29:28] you go down to borrow money on property
[1:29:30] the quick loan or quick quick references
[1:29:33] they give you 20 years of checking back
[1:29:35] to see if anybody else owns that
[1:29:39] i'm just telling you the truth you go
[1:29:40] down there that's why the cheap when it
[1:29:42] costs you it's only 20 years run back
[1:29:44] you pay
[1:29:45] hundreds of dollars and they'll run that
[1:29:47] record back for a hundred years
[1:29:50] but you know the record here in the
[1:29:51] united states can't be run back to but
[1:29:53] to what
[1:29:55] somewhere around
[1:29:56] 1776.
[1:30:00] it can't be run back
[1:30:02] no further because this didn't belong to
[1:30:04] you and i
[1:30:05] it belonged to the indians
[1:30:10] right
[1:30:12] you think you've got an abstract what
[1:30:14] blessed god i got a deed to my property
[1:30:16] i got an abstract you don't have an
[1:30:17] abstract
[1:30:20] there is no such thing as an abstract
[1:30:22] title deed
[1:30:24] you have to give it back to the indians
[1:30:26] then you have to give it back who had it
[1:30:27] before him
[1:30:30] but you can have an abstract title need
[1:30:32] of eternal life
[1:30:34] because a record can be searched all the
[1:30:36] way back to find out there ain't nothing
[1:30:38] against you
[1:30:40] god has made a way to where we can have
[1:30:42] eternal life
[1:30:44] and that eternal life is through jesus
[1:30:46] christ
[1:30:49] it's not how much we know of the message
[1:30:51] or how much we know the bible is how
[1:30:53] much we know of the author of the book
[1:30:55] as a personal experience
[1:30:59] not to just say to know him no
[1:31:04] to know him by revelation
[1:31:09] as he called your name
[1:31:17] oh brother you come up to brother wood
[1:31:19] brother richards years ago
[1:31:21] i think he's from zimbabwe or somewhere
[1:31:23] i'm not certain one
[1:31:25] but his name was kamwadi
[1:31:28] and he said i heard god call him one day
[1:31:30] and he said come waddy
[1:31:33] well that's a very good point
[1:31:36] he made it personal said come what he
[1:31:39] and he had that name
[1:31:43] but you see we're looking for all kind
[1:31:44] of things trying to figure it out when
[1:31:45] god has made it so simple
[1:31:47] through the prophet's message let's
[1:31:49] stand
[1:31:50] abstract title deed
[1:31:54] to give you and i back
[1:31:56] what adam lost
[1:32:01] the prophet said what
[1:32:03] adam lost jesus christ has restored
[1:32:10] not saying he will restore
[1:32:14] has restored
[1:32:19] we've got to hang on to that
[1:32:23] what do we got brother 3 15 the red book
[1:32:26] 315 in the red book anybody have a need
[1:32:45] it
[1:32:52] is anybody have a name just come and
[1:32:55] let's see if god is still really
[1:33:20] do you have that abstract title
[1:33:27] see this message
[1:33:30] is the abstract
[1:33:33] of the bible
[1:33:47] to see if there's anything against you
[1:33:49] and i
[1:33:52] can't find it
[1:33:58] this message is
[1:34:06] redemption
[1:34:25] simply asking
[1:34:26] for a closer walk with the lord
[1:34:29] how many here won't say
[1:34:31] right
[1:34:32] father
[1:34:34] thank you
[1:34:35] for giving that desire down into our
[1:34:36] sister's heart because it never comes
[1:34:38] from
[1:34:39] satan
[1:34:41] it never comes from anything else it
[1:34:42] comes from a thought in her mind
[1:34:45] that she needs a closer walk with you
[1:34:47] so you know what it means
[1:34:49] it means sister there is a closer walk
[1:34:52] to be obtained and all you got to do is
[1:34:54] just keep walking
[1:34:56] and walk right into it
[1:34:58] in jesus name
[1:35:00] let's go walk right on into it
[1:35:03] just
[1:35:04] take it every day and the step at a time
[1:35:08] take one
[1:35:10] until you get there
[1:35:22] oh
[1:35:30] my brother wants prayer for the little
[1:35:32] granddaughter to remember that's gotten
[1:35:34] a
[1:35:35] hole in the heart
[1:35:36] and we believe
[1:35:38] that god can take care of those things
[1:35:40] right
[1:35:42] and we're going to pray
[1:35:43] we're going to give him his prayer claw
[1:35:46] and just let him take it with him and
[1:35:48] just
[1:35:48] place it on the baby's bed
[1:35:52] and believe it
[1:35:54] and believe that it'll be all right i'm
[1:35:56] going to believe that they don't have to
[1:35:57] operate
[1:35:59] the bible says ask for the greater
[1:36:01] things
[1:36:03] why not why should we accept the fact of
[1:36:05] anything else
[1:36:07] if it comes we say thank you lord
[1:36:11] if we operate we say thank you lord
[1:36:15] but why can't we say
[1:36:17] it's over with
[1:36:18] and believe it
[1:36:20] it also made a personal
[1:36:23] you
[1:36:23] so let's just pray father
[1:36:26] we ask you lord
[1:36:28] as we send this prayer cloth
[1:36:31] you knew before the world ever begun
[1:36:32] that our brother would come down here
[1:36:34] and ask
[1:36:36] you knew that i'd say what i did
[1:36:38] that we believe
[1:36:40] that by your stripes
[1:36:42] this little one is healed of that heart
[1:36:44] problem
[1:36:45] father
[1:36:46] we just ask you to go around make it
[1:36:48] manifest
[1:36:50] it's in your hands lord we ask for a
[1:36:53] personal thing about timbo lord
[1:36:57] and the situations that we just ask you
[1:37:00] to come down and
[1:37:02] make things right lord not that he's
[1:37:04] doing wrong but yet he needs more of you
[1:37:07] and
[1:37:09] maybe he needs to move on
[1:37:12] and be what you want him to be lord
[1:37:15] we just committed into your hands
[1:37:17] asking you to forgive our sins and
[1:37:19] goddess
[1:37:21] they'll lead us
[1:37:22] and delete our brother
[1:37:24] we believe our brother there that's
[1:37:26] trying do the best that he can
[1:37:28] to preach all he can
[1:37:30] but maybe temple needs to move on
[1:37:33] so that's up to you lord
[1:37:35] we're committed to you
[1:37:37] we ask you to just god in jesus name
[1:37:42] god bless you brother
[1:37:43] jesus
[1:37:46] anybody have any just come on
[1:37:50] it's coming let's see
[1:37:53] let's see if god is real
[1:37:56] let's believe him
[1:38:00] well i believe if i could see it no
[1:38:03] that's not right
[1:38:05] you believe
[1:38:08] and then it'll take place
[1:38:11] you don't have to see to believe
[1:38:14] you believe to see
[1:38:27] sent a message to our sister
[1:38:29] her about her back giving her problems
[1:38:31] and things so our sisters come up and
[1:38:33] let's just pray
[1:38:35] and just pray that sister you know
[1:38:36] that's aaron's wife sarah
[1:38:38] let's just pray that everything will be
[1:38:40] all right okay father
[1:38:43] you laid on our sister's heart
[1:38:45] when this one called to pray
[1:38:47] and she's prayed all day lord we know
[1:38:49] that
[1:38:51] but we just come together as a group to
[1:38:53] believe you
[1:38:54] and the little bride of christ calls out
[1:38:57] and says reach down father and touch
[1:38:59] sister sarah's back
[1:39:00] make all things well
[1:39:02] because we believe you father and we
[1:39:04] thank you in jesus name
[1:39:07] amen anybody else
[1:39:20] i am
[1:39:33] father
[1:39:34] our brother's asking prayer for his
[1:39:36] mother
[1:39:38] and truly he loves his mother would like
[1:39:39] to help her
[1:39:41] he'd do anything he could to help her
[1:39:43] but then we just take her and we
[1:39:45] committed into your hands because we
[1:39:46] can't do a lot of things
[1:39:48] we can't heal we can't deliver we can't
[1:39:50] do but we can believe
[1:39:52] and we can accept you and believe that
[1:39:54] you'll take care of everything so now we
[1:39:56] just send the great holy spirit to our
[1:39:58] brother's mother there and you just be
[1:40:00] whatever she has need of
[1:40:02] because we thank you for it in jesus
[1:40:04] name
[1:40:18] amen you believe
[1:40:22] see churches
[1:40:23] left up to you and i to believe
[1:40:26] i got a thought i want to get off
[1:40:28] crosstalk that's been on my mind for
[1:40:29] quite a while
[1:40:33] we believe what the bible says
[1:40:36] we believe what the prophet has said
[1:40:40] but is it still just letters on a page
[1:40:44] or even thoughts in our mind
[1:40:48] is it alive
[1:40:53] it is alive in our hearts
[1:40:56] because i believe it
[1:40:58] okay amen don't lose that
[1:41:00] don't give up that believing
[1:41:04] but see i want my believing to be
[1:41:05] transmitted into a reality
[1:41:09] that i see what i'm believing about
[1:41:15] luther and i can refer to him a lot of
[1:41:16] times he there's no telling how many
[1:41:18] times he preached on justification he
[1:41:20] might have done great series on it of
[1:41:23] talking about it from reading paul
[1:41:26] but one day
[1:41:29] something come off that page into that
[1:41:30] man's heart
[1:41:33] and it was the same words he had read
[1:41:35] many thousands maybe times
[1:41:39] but it was a letter on a page
[1:41:41] but then it became alive
[1:41:45] see we say buy stripes i'm healed
[1:41:49] and don't stop confessing that because
[1:41:50] you confess your way into really
[1:41:53] sometimes we confess our way into
[1:41:55] believing
[1:41:57] you know
[1:41:59] just keep saying it
[1:42:01] every time the devil gets onto me i said
[1:42:03] satan
[1:42:04] buys god stripes i'm healed
[1:42:08] and somewhere you're gonna have to give
[1:42:09] up
[1:42:11] you just keep beating that's all right
[1:42:15] but somewhere you're defeated
[1:42:17] because one day i'm going to confess
[1:42:19] myself right into the fact of it being a
[1:42:21] revelation
[1:42:22] and it might be the next time you say it
[1:42:26] you say buy stripes i'm healed
[1:42:30] my wife knows that i had trouble with my
[1:42:32] back and my legs
[1:42:35] just having a lot of trouble with them
[1:42:38] i didn't get to hunt a lot because of
[1:42:40] some of the things didn't want to get
[1:42:42] out
[1:42:44] but i kept saying by stripes i'm healed
[1:42:48] they just walked into it
[1:42:51] you know i really didn't know when it
[1:42:53] was gone
[1:42:56] i just noticed one day it was gone
[1:42:59] and i wasn't having any trouble oh yeah
[1:43:02] 72 years old i'm having troubles we all
[1:43:04] do human right
[1:43:06] and i'm talking about a reality
[1:43:10] keep saying it
[1:43:11] the bible says he makes intercession
[1:43:13] upon our confession
[1:43:17] you say you're healed he says you're
[1:43:19] healed you say you're not healed he says
[1:43:21] you're not healed
[1:43:25] he has to say what we say but you know
[1:43:28] what we're supposed to do is say what he
[1:43:30] says
[1:43:32] and he never has said we wouldn't heal
[1:43:36] he says those who he justified he's
[1:43:38] already glorified
[1:43:42] and that's before we ever even thought
[1:43:44] about being brought into this world as
[1:43:46] human beings
[1:43:49] right
[1:43:51] but yet he said it
[1:43:53] let's just keep saying it
[1:43:56] say thank you lord
[1:43:58] no matter how much sicker you get to say
[1:44:00] thank you lord
[1:44:01] you say yeah but brother you've never
[1:44:03] been sick enough
[1:44:05] i've been so sick i couldn't say thank
[1:44:06] you lord i just sat there and said lord
[1:44:08] come on the scene and do something
[1:44:13] but then when i get back well enough
[1:44:14] i'll say lord come on the scene and help
[1:44:16] me
[1:44:18] because sometimes you get so sick
[1:44:19] brother john martin said that yours are
[1:44:21] going to help me he said sometimes
[1:44:22] you're so sick you need somebody to pray
[1:44:24] for you
[1:44:25] he said because you can't even pray for
[1:44:27] yourself you ever been that sick
[1:44:29] you ever been to a place that you was
[1:44:31] down and so sick and so hurting do you
[1:44:33] couldn't pray
[1:44:37] i've been there danny you've been there
[1:44:39] right
[1:44:41] you see he never left me
[1:44:47] he never left me
[1:44:49] and he's always been there
[1:44:52] do it that way sometimes
[1:44:54] well i better tell i don't i don't want
[1:44:56] to be a liar if i say i'm healed and i'm
[1:44:58] not healed i'm lying you are a liar to
[1:45:00] start with that ain't even in the word
[1:45:02] of god
[1:45:04] there's no such thing in the word of god
[1:45:05] to make a negative confession
[1:45:10] that the sick say there well
[1:45:17] right
[1:45:18] let the redeemed say so
[1:45:24] i thought we believed the scripture
[1:45:25] where it said if with a heart man
[1:45:27] believeth unto salvation but the mouth
[1:45:29] he confesses itself unto it
[1:45:32] right
[1:45:34] i thought that was in the bible
[1:45:38] let's just keep confessing it right
[1:45:41] father we thank you lord for this day
[1:45:43] and your love unto us we thank you for
[1:45:45] calvary the greatest thanksgiving we
[1:45:47] could ever have is to just thank you
[1:45:50] and just say lord we love you
[1:45:52] thank you
[1:45:53] for leading us
[1:45:56] into thy word
[1:45:57] thank you for revealing your word and to
[1:45:59] us thank you for showing it

[1:46:17] everybody on the way home give safe
[1:46:18] journey let your love be with each one
[1:46:20] in jesus name
[1:46:22] amen you're just missed
[1:46:27] time is filled with swift transitions
[1:46:44] build your hopes on things
[1:46:54] god's unchanging hair
[1:47:18] your hopes on things
[1:47:34] when
[1:47:35] your journey is
