[1:28] amen
[1:30] I pray you'll Open the Eyes of our
[1:32] hearts
[1:36] I feel like the
[1:39] the last couple of years the word has
[1:41] just been opening more and more
[1:44] to me
[1:46] it seems like sometimes you're a little
[1:48] bit behind catching up but um
[1:51] you know God's Building the body he's a
[1:54] he's a carpenter
[1:58] so I want to um
[2:02] just pull from maybe a little uh a lot
[2:05] of different scriptures
[2:06] as we go right into
[2:09] speaking on the word
[2:12] and turn to Matthew 25 and verse 1.
[2:15] and then John 3 chapter chapter 3 verse
[2:18] 3.
[2:19] and then First Peter 1 23.
[2:25] let's go to the author
[2:27] Lord God we thank you so much for your
[2:29] grace to us Lord and for opening your
[2:31] words with us Lord God and Lord we're
[2:34] not worthy Lord Jesus to speak of these
[2:36] things but Lord but you made us worthy
[2:38] Lord and Lord God we're so grateful Lord
[2:41] tonight that you're looking through your
[2:43] shed blood Lord God looking at the
[2:46] sacrifice that you made for us Lord
[2:48] Jesus God I thank you Lord God for your
[2:51] grace Lord Jesus
[2:53] thank you so much for your presence here
[2:55] tonight Lord Jesus
[2:57] and I pray o God that you're quick in
[2:59] the word as it goes into the hearers
[3:01] hearts Lord Jesus and make it come alive
[3:03] on us Lord Jesus Quicken this service
[3:05] Lord Jesus Lord we just give you all the
[3:08] honor and the glory and the preeminence
[3:10] Lord I we give you the full control of
[3:12] the service Grant it Lord we pray in the
[3:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:20] so in Matthew
[3:24] 25 verse 1.
[3:26] it says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven
[3:28] be likened unto ten virgins which took
[3:31] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[3:33] bridegroom
[3:37] five of them were wise
[3:40] excuse me a second
[3:45] and five were foolish
[3:47] and we know the rest of that little
[3:49] scripture let's turn to John 3 3. Jesus
[3:53] answered it and said unto him
[3:55] I'm verily verily I say unto thee
[3:59] accept a man be born again he cannot see
[4:01] the kingdom of God right
[4:04] right and then First Peter 1 23
[4:07] how are we born again being born again
[4:09] not of corruptible seed but of
[4:11] incorrectable by the word of God which
[4:13] liveth and abideth forever he may be
[4:16] seated
[4:20] yeah I kind of
[4:22] you know being born again has kind of
[4:25] been on my heart since the ministry of
[4:27] meeting and then when we were up in
[4:28] Kentucky the brother
[4:31] preached on uh being born again and
[4:35] you know I
[4:37] I always say that even if somebody
[4:40] preaches the worst sermon in the world
[4:42] I'm going to get a little something out
[4:43] of it even if it confirms more what I
[4:47] believe and uh so I I like hearing uh
[4:50] somebody bringing their revelation
[4:53] and uh but I it got me thinking about
[4:57] you know what what is the main thing and
[4:59] maybe I want to spend a little time
[5:01] talking this evening on on uh not so
[5:05] much being born again maybe but on
[5:07] Nicodemus
[5:09] and what he was looking for because we
[5:11] read in John chapter three he said it
[5:14] starts like this there was a man of the
[5:16] Pharisees and the Pharisees were the
[5:18] ones that were taught about about the
[5:21] scripture they uh you know that brother
[5:22] random preached that this this sermon
[5:24] the most holy ones the in the most holy
[5:28] place and so forth they should have
[5:30] known who he was and and Nicodemus
[5:33] called little glimpse and uh I'm gonna
[5:37] read some quotes there in a little bit
[5:38] that explains what brother Branham
[5:40] explained what nicodemus's real
[5:42] motivation was about
[5:45] and it says the same came to Jesus by
[5:48] night and it said unto him Rabbi we know
[5:50] that thou art a teacher come from God
[5:52] for no man can do these Miracles that
[5:55] thou doest except God be with him and
[5:58] you know brother random explains as soon
[5:59] as he started you know how somebody a
[6:02] lot of times somebody will start
[6:03] complimenting and flattering you know
[6:05] and Joe 32 when Elijah who Rises up he
[6:08] said I'm not going to bring flatters and
[6:10] things I'm not going to uh you know and
[6:13] and and you know what Jesus does is as
[6:16] soon as the flattery start coming out I
[6:18] I know you're just a wonderful man
[6:21] you're just an amazing person an amazing
[6:24] teacher and you know Jesus knew he
[6:27] didn't know what he was talking about
[6:29] that he he what he was looking at what
[6:32] he he thought that Jesus had an
[6:34] understanding just of of life and a good
[6:36] living a good life and being a good
[6:38] person which is what many people today
[6:40] think that Jesus was just a philosopher
[6:43] I had a good good principle but you know
[6:45] if you really dive into what Jesus
[6:47] taught either he was the greatest
[6:49] deceiver ever or he was the son of God
[6:52] God veiled in a human flesh
[6:55] if you really dive into the scripture
[6:58] sometimes you'll find some surprising
[6:59] things
[7:01] and and that's that's really what I'm
[7:04] getting there what what was Nicodemus
[7:06] looking for
[7:08] right what are we looking for what is
[7:10] the main thing
[7:13] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[7:15] verily I say unto thee after he just cut
[7:18] him off it looked like he changed topics
[7:21] it's changed it from talking about
[7:23] whether he was a good teacher or not to
[7:26] changing it to how he could see things
[7:29] the same way that he saw
[7:32] because uh you know brother Brandon
[7:34] preached a lot of sermons about the way
[7:36] we look and what what Jesus was doing is
[7:39] he was telling him look you've got to
[7:42] look at things differently and the only
[7:44] way you can look at things differently
[7:46] is by being born again by being born not
[7:50] of corruptable seed but of incorruptible
[7:53] verily verily I see unto thee accept a
[7:56] man be born again he cannot see the
[7:58] kingdom of God he cannot even understand
[8:01] what you can't even understand I'm
[8:04] talking about and then then the rest of
[8:06] that chapter he proceeds to lay it out
[8:08] he just uh all of the all of this doctor
[8:12] this that which is born of the flesh is
[8:15] flesh and that which is born of the
[8:17] spirit of spirit Marvel not that I said
[8:19] unto thee you must be born again the
[8:21] wind bloweth where it listeth and and
[8:23] all these other things it just dump the
[8:25] doctrine right out on him and no one
[8:28] but you know the the things that he he
[8:30] spoke were written here so that we could
[8:33] take advantage and I want to say if the
[8:36] things that are preached over the pool
[8:37] maybe not as I'm speaking but uh but you
[8:41] know if you don't understand
[8:44] maybe there's a reason
[8:48] let me let me speak a little bit bluntly
[8:51] you know sometimes uh you know I feel
[8:55] like sometimes ministers maybe try to
[8:57] frame their words in a hidden way maybe
[9:00] so you'll you'll to to Shield us from
[9:04] being our feelings for being hurt a
[9:06] little bit but sometimes there's a
[9:08] reason why we don't see things I I was
[9:11] thinking about um
[9:13] how I I I I talked to oh I'll say one of
[9:17] my neighbors and tried to share the
[9:20] gospel with him and uh every time I
[9:22] share the gospel with him he begins to
[9:24] curse and he always comes back to this
[9:26] story about how he was in his church
[9:29] um which is uh I won't say the
[9:31] denomination but it's close to Catholic
[9:33] and and he was in line for the communion
[9:36] and they didn't give him the communion
[9:37] and so he began to curse and swear the
[9:40] man giving him the communion and you
[9:41] know the Bible says cast not your Pearls
[9:44] Before Swine and I I you know I I want
[9:48] to keep plugging away because he's not
[9:50] the first to kick against the pricks I
[9:52] want to keep plugging away but yet I
[9:55] don't I don't want to share these these
[9:57] little you don't you know go show them
[9:59] pictures of the cloud and pictures of
[10:01] these pearls these precious things that
[10:04] are only for an elect people I believe
[10:06] because what will they do they'll turn
[10:09] and ring you they'll go and and start
[10:11] searching on the internet and and uh and
[10:14] uh reading about all the bad things that
[10:16] people say and and and they'll turn and
[10:19] read you but maybe a little bit of time
[10:21] get just weed out that a little bit of
[10:25] time and and and long and long I mean
[10:27] that's how many of us came along and
[10:30] alone we didn't come all at once all at
[10:33] once were at adoption which is what's
[10:35] being taught that all at once you you
[10:39] get the spirit of God falls on you and
[10:41] you're all the way ready to drive the
[10:43] car ready to drive the truck down the
[10:46] road
[10:46] but how how do we get the Pearl a great
[10:50] price
[10:51] how do we get that you have to sell
[10:54] everything when you found the pearl of
[10:57] great price you sell you're willing to
[11:00] give up everything you're willing to uh
[11:02] you're willing to give up all your ideas
[11:04] and all your priests conceive Notions
[11:06] and all the things that you thought the
[11:09] way it should be and now Nicodemus came
[11:11] to Jesus and I wonder if he thought that
[11:14] he looked that he was the way that he
[11:17] expected him to be
[11:19] yeah you know the Bible says that he was
[11:21] not a man that we should desire he was
[11:23] not you know pretty to look at her or
[11:25] nice to look at I should say it wasn't a
[11:28] a greatest stature he wasn't as as big
[11:32] as Saul was in the Bible you know a
[11:34] great big huge man that's why the men
[11:35] elected him to Saul to be the king of
[11:39] Israel because he was a great big huge
[11:41] man then Here Comes little little David
[11:42] that was at the the run of the pack that
[11:46] nobody would even look at and God takes
[11:48] him from from the behind it looks like
[11:51] and puts him up up at the front but what
[11:55] are we looking at and you know uh when
[11:58] you begin to look for that for somebody
[12:01] that can teach you the Pearl gray price
[12:03] maybe maybe the way maybe when you find
[12:05] somebody that can really teach you that
[12:08] can really open the scriptures they they
[12:10] are not exactly what you're expecting
[12:12] maybe a little rough around the edges I
[12:14] wonder if Paul was a little bit rough
[12:16] around the edges and maybe would uh say
[12:18] things in a way that they it might hurt
[12:20] people's feelings and things might might
[12:22] say it just bluntly and everything you
[12:25] know somebody that can really teach you
[12:27] the truth might not polish it up and
[12:29] make it all pretty and Flowery and
[12:31] preach a sermon about roses and and uh
[12:33] and about uh politics and things like
[12:36] that but we'll just tear it right
[12:38] straight down the line because you know
[12:40] the Bible says that the word of God is
[12:42] sharper than a two-edged sword and
[12:45] what's it doing is it's cutting away the
[12:47] things that aren't that aren't supposed
[12:48] to be there right it can hurt a little
[12:50] bit it's cutting and shaving away and
[12:52] and it cuts down dividing even us under
[12:55] the soul and the spirit all the way down
[12:58] to the mirror of the bone and what's
[13:01] what's made in the mirror of the bone
[13:03] the blood that's where the blood is made
[13:05] it's cutting all the way and that's how
[13:07] God inserts himself into the human life
[13:10] is by his word cutting down cutting down
[13:13] all the way through uh
[13:16] exposing your unbelief
[13:19] convicting you pricking your heart
[13:21] causing you by his word
[13:24] to give way to the to his Spirit right
[13:27] and now um
[13:31] now you know if we can if we can figure
[13:33] out
[13:35] how we grow
[13:37] how we're born then that you know God
[13:40] God has a pattern that he works with
[13:43] everything works in continuity when I
[13:47] said earlier I can see the word opening
[13:49] up more and more you know many people
[13:51] look at the word I I was talking to some
[13:55] one of the minister Brothers here about
[13:57] this a while ago about how many look at
[13:59] the uh you know when Daniel 70 weeks
[14:03] there's a little box put it over here
[14:04] and then you got um you know another
[14:08] Doctrine being born again put it over
[14:09] here and then another Doctrine you got
[14:12] um another Topic at say a ministers
[14:15] meeting or whatever over here and these
[14:17] are all separate topics is the way they
[14:19] think but really they all run together
[14:23] now you know I remember brother Reno
[14:25] speaking about that that black brother
[14:27] that that preached about the horizontal
[14:29] rainbow and I I always wondered what was
[14:32] that horizontal rainbow but I believe
[14:34] I'm beginning to get a an idea of where
[14:36] that horizontal rainbow was because
[14:38] God's attributes run down in continuity
[14:41] from the beginning to the end from
[14:42] Genesis to revelation all down through
[14:45] scripture and everything ties into
[14:47] everything the way you're born again is
[14:49] the way you grow and through
[14:51] justification sanctification the baptism
[14:54] Holy Ghost by the word growing word on
[14:56] type of word precept on top of precepts
[14:59] here a little there little
[15:01] and the thing that Nicodemus was looking
[15:04] for
[15:05] was was maybe not the word
[15:09] and that's what I I asked somebody
[15:11] recently
[15:12] uh
[15:13] I was talking to him about a decision
[15:16] they were making it I was I said what
[15:18] are you looking for
[15:20] what are you looking for
[15:23] and I I believe you know when when I I
[15:25] read this little scripture about the
[15:27] foolish versions
[15:29] I wonder what the foolish versions are
[15:32] looking for
[15:33] maybe that's why they're foolish because
[15:35] they don't have a revelation of what
[15:38] they should be looking for is it is it
[15:40] just to come into church you know
[15:42] brother Brown said Nicodemus thought
[15:44] that it would just be about uh that his
[15:47] how he washed the pots and pans and how
[15:50] you know how a couple girls that's
[15:51] that's the way the Israelites believe
[15:52] that you know they have everything
[15:54] kosher and they have everything they
[15:56] they believe their salvation in those
[15:59] orders and things but
[16:01] and brother Branham even explained that
[16:04] he that's the way he told his disciples
[16:07] that I'm sending you a comforter
[16:10] because he knew that if they were not
[16:13] prepared for that that they would
[16:15] continue on in the washing of the possum
[16:17] pans and things
[16:19] so
[16:21] what we're not we're not looking for
[16:25] just a uh a nice Social Gospel
[16:33] I picked up on we we had a nice
[16:35] conversation on the way of the ministry
[16:37] meeting and some of this is actually all
[16:39] for that conversation that some of the
[16:41] quotes I found I appreciate that I
[16:43] appreciate Bill Wayne and all the
[16:45] ministers because you know I'm I'm I'm
[16:47] standing on your shoulders
[16:49] and uh but now um
[16:54] are we just looking at what's the main
[16:58] thing the main focus
[17:00] will really govern Our Lives because you
[17:03] know you know you start off which way
[17:05] you start off determines whether you're
[17:08] going to end up on the Target or not let
[17:11] me uh I'm gonna jump to this quote real
[17:13] quick
[17:18] let's read this 1960
[17:20] 607 hearing receiving and acting I think
[17:23] it's about the fourth or fifth
[17:26] about the little little child
[17:33] I'll start reading at the part I didn't
[17:35] highlight as I said to you last night
[17:38] Mexico down there they built this
[17:40] beautiful city but they were so sure
[17:42] they was going to make it so glamorous
[17:43] with all the outside now the city's
[17:45] sitting backwards the big fine buildings
[17:47] are rocking back why they didn't get to
[17:49] that Foundation certainly not the
[17:51] foundation
[17:52] and now he talks about I heard a certain
[17:54] Minister the other day bring a little
[17:56] child to the phone or the microphone
[17:58] four or five of them and stood there
[18:00] after he said there was no such a thing
[18:02] as some great Bible teaching brought
[18:04] that little child there and took a salt
[18:06] shaker and throwed three drops of water
[18:08] on their head and said I baptized thee
[18:10] in the name of the father Son and the
[18:11] Holy Ghost and pass that little child on
[18:13] to be a member of the church not six
[18:15] months old yet
[18:16] why the poor little fella hasn't got a
[18:19] chance he got started on the wrong
[18:21] Foundation to begin with that's not even
[18:24] in the Bible that's a heathen trait it's
[18:26] not even in the scripture brother we'll
[18:28] never get started till we get on the
[18:29] foundation and start right build by the
[18:32] Holy Spirit upon the word of God that's
[18:34] exactly right no one in the Bible was
[18:36] ever sprinkled no such a thing the Greek
[18:38] word baptized means to be covered up
[18:40] buried hit away that's exactly right now
[18:43] he's talking about baptism but what he's
[18:45] really talking about is the foundation
[18:46] that's right where you where you lay the
[18:49] foundation how you get started because
[18:51] if you don't lay the foundation you
[18:54] can't even grow up the statue of a
[18:56] perfect man you can't he said be born
[18:59] again first and then grow
[19:02] start lay the foundation get everything
[19:05] get get that Foundation right and then
[19:07] you can start growing now how do you lay
[19:10] the foundation
[19:11] now I want to kind of use as an example
[19:15] that little um
[19:18] my notes straight here
[19:20] in First Kings chapter 17 because you
[19:23] know in in the Old Testament in and in
[19:26] the New Testament the whole scripture
[19:28] runs in continuity and the path to in to
[19:32] to to uh being part of Christ is laid
[19:35] all spoken of all through the scripture
[19:37] from from uh the beginning of Genesis
[19:40] from Abel's sacrifice all the way down
[19:42] to the end now now in First Kings
[19:45] chapter 17 that's when Elijah first
[19:47] comes on the scene and and he comes to a
[19:50] little widow woman's house that was
[19:51] looking for Elijah and he came to her
[19:54] home and he and we know the story he
[19:55] said give me can I have some water and
[19:57] she went to go get it and now there's
[19:59] the first thing she went she was doing
[20:01] it she was obeying she was obedience is
[20:03] better the sacrifice is what uh uh uh
[20:06] the prophet told um Samuel told
[20:09] Saul
[20:11] and so as soon as she went and turned to
[20:13] get that water he said bring me a little
[20:15] more silver bread and she said I don't
[20:17] have anything
[20:19] I don't have I I'm almost out of my my
[20:21] meal and my oil
[20:23] but he said but but uh we know the story
[20:26] she went ahead and made it anyway and
[20:29] and took the meal and the oil and mixed
[20:31] it together and made a cake and put it
[20:33] on the cross of her self-sacrifice I'm
[20:35] willing to do whatever it takes
[20:38] and you know brother Branham explained
[20:40] if you'll bring your little bit your
[20:42] empty meal and oil you drive on
[20:45] Wednesday night through the rain and the
[20:47] snow whatever it takes you bring that
[20:49] little bit you bring it to church and
[20:50] you get it filled up again you bring it
[20:52] you empty it it it becomes empty you
[20:55] bring it back again and you fill it up
[20:57] and you just keep filling it up you get
[20:59] you hear the word and the spirit comes
[21:02] and quickens it and makes it alive you
[21:04] hear the word and the spirit comes and
[21:06] quickens it and makes it alive and that
[21:08] pattern is repeated all through the
[21:10] scripture that you the word has to be
[21:12] sowed the word has to be sewn into your
[21:15] heart and then the spirit comes and
[21:17] quickens it
[21:19] now I I want to tell a little story this
[21:22] uh uh you know usually you don't want to
[21:25] quote names but uh I'll say I'm I'm 100
[21:29] sure that I heard this right when I was
[21:32] a little a little child or a lot younger
[21:34] we were visiting brother Charlie Cox up
[21:36] in Kentucky and he told us that one time
[21:39] he was over uh brother Branham and some
[21:41] other brothers were were visiting over
[21:44] eaten and a brother started choking
[21:47] began to choke now uh us we would maybe
[21:50] call a paramedic
[21:52] does anybody know the Heimlich maneuver
[21:55] but have you ever wondered what would a
[21:57] prophet of God do how would a prophet of
[21:59] God handle that now go back to First
[22:02] Kings chapter 17 There Was Elijah on the
[22:05] scene and there was the meal and the oh
[22:09] now all the way up into the the 20th
[22:12] century here's Elijah again sitting at
[22:15] the table and he reaches over for the
[22:17] cornbread he gets the meal and gives it
[22:20] to the brother and immediately he stops
[22:23] choking because what does that meal
[22:25] represent that meal represents Christ it
[22:29] was ground and ground by that Burr until
[22:32] it every little piece was just ground up
[22:35] exactly the same because he was bruised
[22:39] for our iniquities he was he was wounded
[22:41] for our transgressions by his stripes we
[22:44] are healed and you know brother Brown
[22:46] said if you've got that token that same
[22:48] life in you then you have a promise that
[22:50] your prayers will be answered he said if
[22:52] you don't have the token before you go
[22:54] pray get the token because if you don't
[22:57] have the token you don't have the
[22:59] promise you have a promise it's written
[23:01] in the Bible that these same things that
[23:04] were done in the first church age will
[23:06] be done by today because he's Hebrews 13
[23:10] 8 he's the same yesterday today and
[23:12] forever if you know if you go home
[23:14] driving home tonight and forget the rest
[23:17] of this Sermon Just remember that that
[23:18] that's my confession that he is still
[23:20] the same and if I if I can't have enough
[23:23] Faith to believe it I don't want to
[23:25] stand in anybody else's way to believe
[23:26] that he's still the same you I want to
[23:29] stand aside if I can't believe it and
[23:31] say come right on into the blessings and
[23:33] Promises of God because he's still the
[23:35] same his word is the same yesterday
[23:37] today and forever now now that same
[23:40] pattern that was there when Elijah got
[23:43] that little that little cake of bread
[23:45] that little that little uh piece of
[23:48] bread that same pattern is repeated all
[23:50] through the scripture because A sower
[23:52] went forth to sow we know the sower is
[23:55] Christ
[23:55] because if you're speaking if a preacher
[23:58] is speaking by a real Revelation that
[24:00] it's not him sowing it it's Christ in
[24:03] himself and you know let me I want to
[24:06] bring this out Paul said that I came not
[24:08] in word only I came to you not just in
[24:12] word only but in the power and the
[24:14] demonstration of the spirit now that's a
[24:16] scripture that a lot of people use to
[24:18] say well well when you say what are you
[24:20] looking for I'm looking for a church
[24:23] that has the power and the demonstration
[24:25] of a spirit now what does that mean does
[24:29] that mean a lot of a lot of emotion does
[24:33] that mean they have some awesome
[24:34] musicians does that mean that uh there's
[24:38] a a grand religious commotion going on
[24:43] or does that mean that the pastor
[24:45] hammers a lot on social conventions and
[24:47] things
[24:49] but I believe that you know if you run
[24:52] through what brother Branham said about
[24:54] power and I preached the sermon on power
[24:56] power is the Revelation when God gives
[25:00] you revelation of what's in the Bible
[25:02] then it gives you power over the devil
[25:04] it gives you power over yourself it
[25:07] gives you power to live a Godly life it
[25:10] gives you power to believe his word
[25:11] because you know it's true it gives you
[25:13] power that when you're when you're
[25:15] asking prayer it gives you power that
[25:17] you know who you're talking to it knows
[25:19] you you know who God is that there's
[25:21] only one God and that he's living inside
[25:24] of you that it gives you so when the
[25:27] gospel is it came not just in word only
[25:30] as Paul said he didn't come and just
[25:33] just open the church age book and begin
[25:36] to read I had a I had a professor in
[25:38] school that that would do that every day
[25:40] he got tired of the administration so he
[25:42] he said well I'll show him I'll just
[25:44] open up the textbook and just read
[25:47] but now now what if I did that what if I
[25:49] come up here with a message book and
[25:51] just read now that's coming in word only
[25:53] the letter of the word but I believe I
[25:56] hope that you want to hear my revelation
[25:58] of the word
[26:00] you want to hear the power the power and
[26:03] maybe that power that God has given me
[26:06] that that it will Quicken something in
[26:08] you and you'll say I know that's right
[26:09] now of course of course it's it's got to
[26:13] be quick and you you can hear the word
[26:14] and it won't be quick and maybe it'll be
[26:17] quicker than a week later a year later
[26:19] somewhere down the road but sooner or
[26:21] later that oil and that meal will come
[26:23] together and make a cake that'll give
[26:27] life and it'll produce something when
[26:31] God quickens his word to you and brings
[26:33] that power then that's how you're born
[26:36] all the way up you're you're born again
[26:38] and you keep eating you get the power of
[26:42] virtue and you get the power of
[26:44] knowledge you get the power of
[26:46] temperance and patience all the way up
[26:48] because you keep eating the word and
[26:50] eating the word and that's what
[26:52] Nicodemus was not looking at right he
[26:55] was looking at just a social convention
[26:57] just to uh I just want to go to church
[27:00] and sit in church and and partake in the
[27:02] worship service and partake in the
[27:04] atmosphere and and uh feel the spirit
[27:08] fill the spirit of God over there
[27:10] somewhere around me but I don't want to
[27:13] just feel the spirit I want the spirit
[27:16] of God to be inside of me to be to dwell
[27:18] inside of me and give me his power
[27:20] because if you just feel the spirit you
[27:23] cannot see the kingdom of God the only
[27:25] way you can see God's kingdom is that if
[27:28] he's living inside of you if that
[27:30] comforter is teaching you from the
[27:32] inside showing you things to come
[27:34] bringing things to your remembrance and
[27:35] brother Brandon explain it like this he
[27:37] said
[27:38] the Church of God will see the program
[27:42] of God
[27:44] the Church of God will see the program
[27:46] of God
[27:48] you know that gives you power
[27:51] when you can see what God where you're
[27:54] going when God gives you a revelation
[27:56] that it's one thing that when he gives
[27:58] you a revelation and maybe shows you who
[28:00] to marry or or where to work and things
[28:03] but when you can stand back and see and
[28:05] and the bride he's done something
[28:07] special for us he's shown us all the way
[28:10] out past the Battle of Gog and Magog
[28:12] I'll pass all way on out just way far
[28:16] you can see you can stand back and look
[28:19] and see the end past there's no end you
[28:25] can see on and on we
[28:28] ought to be the most grateful people in
[28:30] the world because of the things that God
[28:32] has shown us
[28:33] that that gives us power and it when you
[28:37] put the oil and the the meal together
[28:40] then you get stimulated by the
[28:43] stimulation of Revelation it'll make you
[28:46] walk different it'll make you act
[28:48] different it'll make you have a positive
[28:50] attitude
[28:53] let me read it let me read a quote here
[28:56] before I get ahead of Nicodemus let's go
[28:58] back to that first that first uh quote
[29:01] lean on not under thine own
[29:03] understanding
[29:05] why were these Pharisees blind
[29:10] what made them so blind
[29:13] now remember
[29:15] in the book of Acts on the day of
[29:17] Pentecost
[29:18] Peter started off his sermon with ye men
[29:21] of Israel ye men of Israel who have been
[29:25] blinded
[29:26] because they would not accept Revelation
[29:29] or Vindication of the word
[29:33] and and let's go on and that's the
[29:36] reason today that the churches are blind
[29:40] is because they won't accept Revelation
[29:42] that's being Vindicated
[29:44] if the word says so and it's revealed
[29:47] and then is proven still they won't
[29:50] accept it
[29:52] and then he goes on that's the reason
[29:54] these Jews the Jews to this day will not
[29:56] you cannot talk to them about Christ
[29:57] because the veil is still over their
[29:59] face blinded and so forth but what about
[30:01] today and that's what he said the church
[30:04] the churches today are blind the
[30:06] churches did any uh
[30:10] we were riding in the car the other day
[30:12] and my wife was really touched by uh
[30:16] well I don't want to say too much but
[30:17] you know you you get grieved when you
[30:20] see you see people hungering and
[30:22] thirsting for the word and and their you
[30:25] know brother Brandon said they would eat
[30:27] the sloppers the god that eat whatever
[30:29] is available but if people are hungry
[30:32] and thirsty then uh
[30:36] well you know I believe that
[30:39] if you're hungry and thirsting bad
[30:40] enough you're gonna find it you're going
[30:42] to go out and figure out a way to get it
[30:44] you're going to do whatever it takes to
[30:47] get it if you have to drive four hours
[30:50] or uh every Sunday or or or find
[30:55] somebody online that that uh is
[30:57] preaching the truth
[30:58] right because you're going to be you're
[31:00] going to be looking for it
[31:02] that's one of the evidences of the new
[31:05] birth that he will lead and guide you
[31:07] into all truth he will lead you and and
[31:10] take you to where you need to be to hear
[31:12] it well I'm just speaking playing this
[31:15] this afternoon
[31:19] now
[31:23] I'm getting my nose mixed up
[31:28] but
[31:29] going back to the widows very fast in
[31:32] First Kings chapter 17. now one of the
[31:33] things that you do when you when you
[31:35] hear the truth there's a little
[31:37] component in there that you've got to do
[31:40] what it says you've got to obey it and
[31:43] now all through scripture that that
[31:45] theme is repeated when Jesus comes up to
[31:48] an invalid and says take up thy bed and
[31:50] walk what if they don't many times
[31:51] you're here on the prayer line brother
[31:53] Brandon will say lady there the pillar
[31:56] of fire is Over You Stand Up and she
[32:00] obviously doesn't stand up because he'll
[32:02] say the pillar of fires move to somebody
[32:04] else
[32:05] you got to seize that opportunity and do
[32:08] exactly what the word says God wants us
[32:12] to obey him what uh remember that story
[32:14] I I read um
[32:17] I'm trying to think the brother in
[32:19] England that told the story of uh a
[32:22] brother in his congregation that he
[32:24] finally convinced that he needed to be
[32:26] baptized but yet he wouldn't go do it
[32:28] now that's the formula if you repent and
[32:31] are baptized in the name of the Lord
[32:33] Jesus Christ then you have a promise if
[32:35] you just keep hanging on
[32:37] hang on and continue on right in in
[32:39] faith believing the promise is to you
[32:42] and to your children even as far off as
[32:44] many as many as the Lord Our God shall
[32:46] call The Promise is to the just obey
[32:49] that promise right
[32:51] and and what about when he was at the
[32:53] talking to the woman at the well and he
[32:55] says go bring your husband of course she
[32:57] couldn't do that
[32:58] what if she what if she told a little
[33:01] field but she she said well I I I've got
[33:04] uh what was it five or so and and then
[33:07] Naaman
[33:08] Elijah told him go down and dip seven
[33:11] times in the River Jordan
[33:14] the old muddy nasty River Jordan a lot
[33:18] of times God will you know what it's
[33:21] it's scary
[33:23] a lot of times the the truth is a little
[33:25] bit scary to fully Embrace and and and
[33:28] and that's what brother Branham
[33:30] explained when he was talking about the
[33:31] Nicodemus story is that Nicodemus was
[33:34] afraid it's scary right it's scary until
[33:38] you get the new birth you don't want to
[33:40] go tell anybody you don't want anybody
[33:42] to know what you believe
[33:45] yeah you don't want
[33:46] you don't want anybody to find out that
[33:49] that you don't believe that all these
[33:52] things are wrong why are you why are you
[33:54] dressing this way why why don't y'all go
[33:56] to these different events and social
[33:58] things and why don't y'all participate
[34:00] oh I don't want anybody to find out but
[34:03] let the spirit of God come in you
[34:06] and like Elijah in job 32 said when the
[34:09] spirit there's a spirit in man it gives
[34:11] knowledge when the Breath of God comes
[34:14] upon you it makes you act different
[34:16] it'll make you walk different and talk
[34:17] different
[34:20] in Acts 2 38 now see you gotta you gotta
[34:25] get that meal first
[34:27] and Acts 2 38 you say well I was
[34:31] thinking about this where
[34:33] how did Peter know
[34:35] to say
[34:37] the formula repent and be baptized in
[34:39] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:41] well the word had been sown right
[34:44] right he was sitting around one day and
[34:46] and Jesus said
[34:48] be baptized in the name of the father
[34:50] Son and Holy Ghost
[34:52] what now you can just the word Paul said
[34:54] I didn't come with just the word only if
[34:56] you come with the word only
[34:58] oh my
[35:00] we'll be a little bit mixed up
[35:03] you know a lot of things in the
[35:04] scripture look like they're they're
[35:06] they're they're a little off and that's
[35:08] what brother Wade was bringing that real
[35:10] out a lot is that is it revelation
[35:14] is our absolute amen because there's a
[35:17] lot of things that have come out of the
[35:19] Bible
[35:20] and there's a lot of things that have
[35:21] come out of the message
[35:23] if you say the message is your absolute
[35:25] well then what about the two Souls
[35:28] people and all the polygamies and things
[35:29] that it seems like is coming out of the
[35:32] message it seems like Jesus said you
[35:35] should be baptized in the name of the
[35:37] father Son and Holy Ghost but that word
[35:38] was quickened when that Spirit came in
[35:40] when the oil came in and Peter came out
[35:43] with a real Revelation I know who the
[35:45] father-son and Holy Ghost is that's the
[35:48] Lord Jesus Christ and that's who you've
[35:50] got to be baptized in his name right
[35:52] and and and they took on when they took
[35:55] on that life that name was represented
[35:58] in them that's why you know we when we
[36:01] pray of our fruit we pray in his name
[36:02] it's not just tacking something on at
[36:04] the end of the prayer but it's praying
[36:05] and the power and the revelation of who
[36:08] he is of your personal revelation
[36:13] when God
[36:14] you know there's a lot of yeah I
[36:17] you know the Holy Ghost will make you
[36:19] dress right and act right but you know
[36:22] God put the law first before Grace put
[36:26] the law first to show us that we're
[36:27] wrong that we're not right and then he
[36:29] gave us Grace because he knew he gave us
[36:31] an unconditional Covenant I know you
[36:33] can't keep everything right now when you
[36:35] hear somebody preaching on clothes and
[36:37] dressing things that should that should
[36:39] prick a real
[36:40] Christian believer whoa let me go find
[36:43] out about that that's right let me go
[36:45] see if that's true or not right
[36:47] see if I'm not right and brother Branham
[36:49] there are many sermons where he would he
[36:51] would really get on the people about
[36:53] about dressing wrong and doing those
[36:55] things and and it comes back to
[36:58] obedience
[36:59] will I uh because what he said I you
[37:03] only have to tell a real holy
[37:04] ghost-filled woman right one time
[37:07] one time because that word in her will
[37:10] toe the line it'll straighten up real
[37:12] quick real quick because it wants to be
[37:15] just right have everything just in line
[37:18] that little Holy Spirit in there so me
[37:21] contempting to get grieved and when it
[37:23] gets green you start feeling real
[37:25] sorrowful something's not right and you
[37:27] got to run quickly back to the word back
[37:29] get in line it'll straighten you right
[37:32] up
[37:34] what about that I I I just wrote a
[37:37] little note down about that that man
[37:39] when Jesus was calling him and and and
[37:41] and preaching to him and he said well I
[37:43] can't follow you because I got to go
[37:45] bury my father well let the dead bury
[37:47] their dead oh that seems harsh
[37:49] that seems but but when there's a pearl
[37:52] of great price there you'll drop
[37:54] everything and run after it you'll drop
[37:56] all your own ideas and and that's what
[37:58] we hold so dear as we we hold our own
[38:01] ideas so dear well I think I think the
[38:04] the minister should preach real sweet
[38:06] and soft I I I I think he should just
[38:11] you know stroke my fur just the right
[38:13] way I think when I come the the
[38:15] musicians should have all this just
[38:17] right and I I'm going to come to church
[38:19] with a great big loud opinion and tell
[38:22] everybody but you know uh you know God
[38:25] the Holy Spirit isn't me contentment why
[38:28] why wouldn't it make our spirit me
[38:30] contempt as we're growing more and more
[38:32] like him we want to be like him be like
[38:34] Jesus
[38:37] well I'm getting off a little bit but
[38:39] let me
[38:44] so
[38:48] the way that we're born again
[38:50] is the same way that we grow and I
[38:54] mentioned this as a Minister's meeting I
[38:55] read this little scripture is over there
[38:57] in Exodus 25 and I might have preached
[38:59] on this one time uh if if I did then you
[39:01] just get to hear it again
[39:03] in Exodus 25 verses 8 through 9 it says
[39:06] and let them make me a sanctuary
[39:08] that I may dwell among them according to
[39:11] all that I show thee after the pattern
[39:13] of the Tabernacle and the pattern of all
[39:16] the instruments thereof even so shall
[39:18] you make it
[39:19] now we know brother Brown talked a lot
[39:21] about a pattern and he said the pattern
[39:23] is Christ how he laid the pattern over
[39:25] and and it has the the ones that will go
[39:27] when the Rapture match that pattern
[39:28] because they're part of the pattern and
[39:31] he talked about uh you know you can run
[39:33] that pattern all the way back to Genesis
[39:35] 1 26 27 that everything everything
[39:37] that's part of the pattern one day will
[39:40] be that pattern is coming to Earth
[39:42] and and so you got to start from that
[39:45] pattern in in the Masterpiece sermon he
[39:47] was he said God starts from a pattern
[39:50] that's the way any good Builder works is
[39:53] is and those are brother Brandon's words
[39:55] I I really don't know much about
[39:56] building but I believe it's true that
[40:00] how can you start a house or a
[40:01] skyscraper without uh without first
[40:04] having a pattern a thing to work from
[40:06] and the pattern that he started from was
[40:09] himself was the word that he brought
[40:12] down to earth
[40:13] and that same pattern now that was a big
[40:16] question is how
[40:18] you know that question did Brother
[40:20] Brennan change the way that you get the
[40:22] new birth
[40:23] further along in his ministry well now
[40:26] if the pattern is is the same from the
[40:28] beginning to the end from Genesis to
[40:29] Revelation right right then the way that
[40:31] you get into Christ is it stays the same
[40:34] that when he was on the cross and and
[40:36] out of his side came water blood and
[40:38] spirit that showed the pattern and the
[40:40] pattern does a change
[40:42] it doesn't change just because we fail
[40:44] to read a few messages and the pattern
[40:47] is the same because he's the same the
[40:49] pattern is still to be justified
[40:52] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[40:54] Spirit in that pattern just repeats
[40:57] itself all the way up taking us further
[40:59] and further up the growth process but
[41:01] the real way that that to sum it all up
[41:04] the way we go up the way we grow the way
[41:07] we're born again is by his word that's
[41:09] what Nicodemus fail to recognize
[41:14] you know that little Foundation there
[41:18] brother around talked about in the
[41:19] Masterpiece how he he laid the
[41:21] foundation in the Old Testament with
[41:23] Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph
[41:25] and he said that Foundation was the
[41:27] Masterpiece right this is the foundation
[41:29] you get the new birth that's the
[41:31] Masterpiece but that's not the end of
[41:33] the Masterpiece it keeps growing it
[41:35] keeps growing and growing the prophets
[41:38] the prophets in the Old Testament laid
[41:41] the fact they wrote in the Bible it was
[41:43] written what was coming
[41:45] their lives wrote it was written in the
[41:49] Bible that the word The Headstone was
[41:51] coming
[41:52] and and now he said wouldn't it be what
[41:55] if we could speak what was written of us
[41:58] and say
[42:00] who can accuse me of sin
[42:03] what a thing
[42:05] to say to say exactly the same thing
[42:07] that was written of you
[42:10] written of you doubt being fulfilled
[42:12] today in the New Testament by his word
[42:15] and that's the that's that's the theme
[42:18] don't get lost here if I get a little
[42:21] bit carried away
[42:23] now in the Old Testament
[42:27] it was written about Joseph was was
[42:29] typing the Life of Christ how he was
[42:31] sold for 30 almost 30 pieces and and
[42:34] sold in in the boundaries and his whole
[42:36] life was all just a type of Christ and
[42:39] type in the perfect anti-type and Saul
[42:42] and Solomon where he said obedience is
[42:44] better than the sacrifice David the
[42:46] rejected King desired to build a temple
[42:49] desired to have a place where God could
[42:51] come down from that pattern and dwell in
[42:54] Earth and one day that pattern
[42:57] was was
[42:59] moving on over to where one day Jesus
[43:02] himself walked into that pattern into
[43:04] that Tabernacle you know what he found
[43:07] there was was it wasn't Sanctified they
[43:10] were doing uh
[43:12] you know that Tabernacle is a type of a
[43:14] human body it's a type of us and when he
[43:17] came into the Tabernacle he found that
[43:19] it wasn't clean and so he took off he
[43:22] took whips and and and began to drive
[43:25] out the money changers and things
[43:27] because God won't come to an unclean
[43:30] vessel first it's got to be Sanctified
[43:32] and purified and the word came to his
[43:35] Temple and found it to be unclean and
[43:38] the Word was there cleaning it out
[43:40] that's how you if you want to get uh get
[43:44] things out of your out of your house get
[43:46] rid of a demon get rid of something
[43:48] that's not there bring the word in and
[43:50] it will it will take care of it amen
[43:54] ah
[43:55] Daniel saw uh saw the the Redemption of
[43:59] Israel job saw a redeemer all out Isaiah
[44:03] said a virgin shall conceive and then
[44:05] finally we get down to Mary and we're
[44:08] talking about the word and an angel came
[44:10] to her
[44:11] and said
[44:13] a child is going to be born to you and
[44:16] what was her response it was be it unto
[44:19] me according to Thy Word
[44:21] so that the word could be made manifest
[44:26] you know you talk about angels
[44:28] and and hair and dress
[44:30] you know the Bible says that that a
[44:33] woman's hair is is on her head for is
[44:36] her power
[44:37] because you you know what that signifies
[44:39] it signifies that she has heard from the
[44:41] angels
[44:42] and she's received a revelation right
[44:45] right and she believes what the angels
[44:47] have said
[44:48] and it's changed the way she acts the
[44:51] way she dresses when you go around and
[44:54] you go to Walmart and and and that
[44:56] message that you're wearing on your head
[44:58] that shows you believe is a it's a
[45:01] message to all the other whenever my
[45:03] wife gets around the homeschool people
[45:05] and the the different people that uh in
[45:09] the little homeschool groups it's like
[45:10] you can always tell that the people act
[45:12] different because they're convicted
[45:14] they'll start they'll start wearing
[45:16] dresses and and which brother around
[45:18] himself is a good sign it's a bad sign
[45:20] when they when they just don't care but
[45:22] when there's something inside when
[45:24] they're convicted they they'd uh you
[45:26] know they uh
[45:28] they want to they want to change their
[45:30] appearance when they're around you
[45:31] that's that's a good sign
[45:35] well I'm getting off a little bit again
[45:42] but let me go back and and uh because
[45:44] we're talking about down down through
[45:46] the the Old Testament and through the
[45:48] new God is building himself a body by
[45:50] his word and so that's why it's so
[45:52] important for us to listen to the you
[45:54] know we talk we talk so much about
[45:56] coming to church but I think maybe an
[45:58] even greater struggle than coming to
[46:00] church coming to church is one of the
[46:02] basic things right we come to church on
[46:04] Wednesday night and whenever whenever
[46:05] the doors are open but an even greater
[46:07] struggle maybe is finding time in your
[46:10] own personal life to sit and open up the
[46:13] Bible and and get along with God
[46:16] and and that's that's really uh
[46:20] I just want to speak words of
[46:23] encouragement to you to to set aside
[46:25] time because you remember in that third
[46:27] pool when the angel came and said uh
[46:29] isn't this the the things that are done
[46:31] in secret will be made open the the the
[46:34] your private time talking about your
[46:36] your prayer life your prayer closet
[46:38] that's what's so important where you
[46:41] when you have a a private time of a
[46:45] private real relationship with God it'll
[46:47] be made known openly
[46:51] so let's let's look at some scriptures
[46:53] in First Peter
[46:56] 1 22-25
[47:00] seeing you have this kind of sums up
[47:03] everything we've been talking about
[47:05] seeing you have purified your souls in
[47:08] obeying
[47:10] the truth
[47:12] through the spirit
[47:14] unto unfeigned love of the brother
[47:16] now you say I love the Lord but he said
[47:19] if you love me you'll obey my
[47:22] Commandments
[47:25] unto unfane love of the brothers see
[47:28] that ye love one another with a pure
[47:29] heart fervently
[47:33] you know it really does help I used to
[47:36] be so backwards I still am backwards in
[47:40] a lot of ways but
[47:42] but
[47:45] I I really enjoy fellowshipping with
[47:49] brothers and sisters it it really helps
[47:51] to you know when when you have somebody
[47:54] that you can call on to pray and and uh
[47:57] somebody to help bear the load and you
[47:59] know when you when you kind of
[48:01] uh mess up or whatever or you know
[48:04] sometimes you you don't feel like going
[48:05] to the fellowship meeting or whatever
[48:07] and somebody one of the brothers will
[48:09] call you up and what's wrong with you
[48:10] you know they give you a little a little
[48:12] a little helpful uh nudge along
[48:16] because we need one another you know I
[48:19] we'll get these complexes and things
[48:21] built up and and we'll try to make
[48:22] ourselves isolationist and and I believe
[48:25] that's wrong we shouldn't we shouldn't
[48:27] uh
[48:29] I mean to be honest that's one of the
[48:31] things that I I fight is is is making
[48:34] myself
[48:35] taking myself off to myself and and I'm
[48:38] just going to deal with my problem
[48:39] myself and but you know we we shouldn't
[48:42] do that we shouldn't
[48:44] obey and obeying the truth of the spirit
[48:46] under unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[48:48] that you love one another with a pure
[48:49] heart fervently
[48:51] we went to a fellowship meeting one time
[48:53] and uh Jonathan Jones he just said pro
[48:56] ball I'm so glad to see you and he just
[48:58] pulled put his arms around me you know
[49:00] that that's how we should all all be we
[49:02] should just uh when we see one another
[49:05] just really not putting on a show but
[49:07] make each other feel welcome
[49:11] being born again not of corruptable seed
[49:15] but of Incorruptible by the word of God
[49:17] which liveth an abideth River
[49:20] why for All Flesh
[49:22] is as grass right right and all the
[49:25] glory of man is the flower of grass
[49:28] the grass withereth and the flower of
[49:30] the roof falleth away but
[49:33] the word of the Lord endureth forever
[49:37] so how do we hear the word
[49:39] and this is the word which by the gospel
[49:42] is preached unto you
[49:46] because Romans 10 13 says or 10 14 10 13
[49:50] 10 14. how then shall they call on him
[49:53] and whom they have not believed and how
[49:55] shall they believe in whom they have not
[49:57] heard and how shall they hear without a
[49:59] preacher
[50:00] and how should they preach except there
[50:02] be sin as it is written how beautiful
[50:04] are the feet of them that preach the
[50:06] gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings
[50:08] of good things
[50:10] but these are the best things
[50:13] how the gospel is so wonderful
[50:17] when you hear about what God has done
[50:18] for you
[50:21] are the are the feet of them the priests
[50:23] these Good Tidings beautiful to you
[50:28] in First Corinthians 4 15 he says for
[50:30] though you have ten thousand instructors
[50:32] in Christ yet have ye not many fathers
[50:35] for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you
[50:38] through the gospel
[50:41] in James 1 18 it says of his own will
[50:44] beget he us with the word of Truth that
[50:47] we should be a kind of first fruits of
[50:49] his creatures
[50:50] in John 1 12 he says but as many as
[50:53] received him
[50:54] to them gave you power to become the
[50:58] sons of God even to them that believe on
[51:01] his name which were born not of blood
[51:03] nor of the will of the flesh nor of the
[51:06] will of man
[51:07] but of God he gave power to become the
[51:11] sons of God
[51:13] you know even Abel had back in the Old
[51:15] Testament when they didn't even have the
[51:17] Holy Ghost they got a little bit a
[51:19] little bit of of the revelation
[51:23] to carry them through right and that
[51:26] gave him power he gave Abel power when
[51:28] he knew exactly what to do to bring a
[51:30] sacrifice right right he knew exactly he
[51:32] didn't have to guess I wonder if this is
[51:34] the right way and as Cain laughed maybe
[51:36] at all the blood and everything as he
[51:38] dragged it up there he took it up and I
[51:40] knew I knew exactly what I'm doing right
[51:42] David knew exactly what he was doing
[51:45] when he came and fought Goliath because
[51:47] he had power
[51:48] and I'm repeating myself because I want
[51:52] you to remember I I don't want
[51:54] us you know so many times we leave the
[51:56] service and and not even really remember
[51:58] what the preacher said but but
[52:03] power
[52:04] comes by Revelation amen
[52:07] amen so you know when you're driving or
[52:10] work next week think think on these
[52:12] things about how the word is so
[52:14] important because it gives you power
[52:16] over your flesh it gives you power over
[52:18] the devil it gives you power you know
[52:21] when you when you put your hand on
[52:22] somebody
[52:23] and pray for him or I'll pray with it
[52:26] for him without even putting your hands
[52:27] on him you're doing that because you God
[52:29] has given you power right he's giving
[52:31] you a revelation that's the way that you
[52:35] know whenever brother Brown did that a
[52:36] lot of times he would say in obedience
[52:37] to your word
[52:39] he would he would he would put it this
[52:42] is my phrase and he would put it back on
[52:43] God I'm doing exactly what you told me
[52:46] to do now let's see it come to pass
[52:49] just like Elisha came up to that River
[52:51] he said I bet I saw Elijah I did I did
[52:55] exactly what he said if you if you see
[52:57] me go up and he got to that River and he
[52:58] said where is the god of Elijah how many
[53:02] times maybe you feel like that in your
[53:03] life but you know you know that that
[53:06] listen to that sermon be certain of God
[53:08] when you've done everything that you can
[53:10] do when you have obeyed him and you
[53:13] believe him then he will come on the
[53:15] scene and that's been my personal
[53:17] experience when things when when I got
[53:21] laid off and there was nobody uh hiring
[53:24] anywhere and it seemed like there was a
[53:26] horrible burden on my shoulders and I
[53:28] got out in the garage and would pray
[53:30] until until the burden lifted and the
[53:32] burden come back I'd go out in the
[53:34] garage and pray a little bit more pray
[53:36] all night pray all weekend that was my
[53:38] job that became my job
[53:41] because you know you gotta something's
[53:44] something's got to give you know God
[53:46] makes us desperate sometimes he'll bring
[53:48] us through trials and troubles and
[53:50] tribulations and things and that grows
[53:52] us into his character into His Image
[53:54] because we learned to trust him we learn
[53:57] to believe him that he is able that he's
[54:00] still the same yesterday today and
[54:01] forever a lot of times trials don't seem
[54:03] very fun at first like that that little
[54:06] Widow
[54:07] but then Elijah came and gave her a
[54:10] message and she believed it and obeyed
[54:13] it and out of that trial came a great
[54:16] testimony
[54:17] I can you imagine what she was able to
[54:19] tell her friends you you wouldn't
[54:21] believe what God did I didn't have any
[54:23] oil I didn't have any meal but a
[54:26] messenger came on the scene and I
[54:28] believed his word and I stayed right
[54:30] with him and and believed him all the
[54:33] way through that's that's my testimony
[54:34] all the way through I believe it because
[54:37] I knew that his words were precious his
[54:40] word was true he I I found the pearl of
[54:44] great price
[54:45] now
[54:49] you know that that recipe of obedience
[54:52] is how you get the token because brother
[54:54] random said full obedience entitles you
[54:57] to the Token exactly I've done
[54:59] everything that's required
[55:02] and all the way through your journey
[55:04] he never takes away your free moral
[55:06] latency
[55:10] I think I think maybe that's
[55:14] word Nicodemus
[55:16] you know he went through he heard the
[55:18] word
[55:19] you know the next time he was mentioned
[55:21] was over in Acts 19 where he was they
[55:23] were putting Jesus into the ground
[55:25] they were covering him with anointing
[55:27] oil and things and then you don't hear
[55:29] about him anymore
[55:30] what went wrong
[55:32] what goes wrong in the foolish virgin's
[55:35] life
[55:36] what what don't they see
[55:39] let's read that second quote why I'm
[55:41] against organized relation and I'm gonna
[55:42] I'm gonna be closing in just a second
[55:44] here so y'all don't get too tired on me
[55:50] but like like Jesus when he was telling
[55:53] his disciples can't you stay awake
[56:01] well I love you I hope you love me too
[56:07] and he said why I'm against organized
[56:10] religion in 1962 he said um
[56:17] Nicodemus knew that he knew about life
[56:21] now now see I I believe that's what a
[56:24] lot of people in churches today are
[56:25] really interested in about life right
[56:28] but what about eternal life about about
[56:31] uh social conventions and politics and
[56:34] and what kind of flowers we got in the
[56:36] church and that kind of thing but that's
[56:38] not
[56:40] what's gonna that you know the signs and
[56:43] the Wonders were not what took Israel
[56:46] through their Journey it was the word it
[56:49] was the revealed word that took them
[56:51] through it was the pill or fire
[56:53] Nicodemus knew that he knew about life
[56:55] but he never knew that he was eternal
[56:57] life
[56:58] that's what the man that he was talking
[57:00] to the messenger the light of the day
[57:01] the light of the world
[57:03] the light shineth in darkness and the
[57:05] Darkness comprehended it not he was sent
[57:07] to his own in his own received do not
[57:09] why why
[57:11] because they were so organized set up
[57:13] with washing pots and pans and
[57:16] traditions
[57:17] that they failed to see the word made
[57:20] flesh
[57:25] let's go to that next one
[57:28] I'm just going to read through a few of
[57:30] these just to kind of
[57:33] I I I I think I always say this every
[57:36] time I preach it everything I say he's
[57:37] got to dovetail with what brother
[57:39] Branham said because
[57:41] he was the messenger to the age
[57:45] um why I'm against organized religion
[57:48] this is the same sermon neither did
[57:49] korra's great understanding mean
[57:51] anything or Adams
[57:53] each denying God's Vindicated message
[57:57] now let's listen closely now we're going
[57:58] to get in some high waters in a minute
[58:00] see each one of them the reason that
[58:01] they got in trouble
[58:03] Nicodemus
[58:05] Cora Nimrod and so forth is because they
[58:09] didn't recognize God's messenger with
[58:12] the Vindicated word of that day
[58:15] and then he says now anyone knows that
[58:19] wow
[58:22] let's go to the next one as I was with
[58:24] Moses so I will be with thee
[58:30] now Moses when he had signs he went down
[58:32] and performed those signs but the sign
[58:34] isn't the thing that took them to the
[58:35] promised land right it wasn't the signs
[58:38] it was the Vindication of the commission
[58:40] and the Rahab believed it without seeing
[58:43] anything she said that we're all
[58:44] trembling no wonder Nicodemus said Rabbi
[58:46] we know thou art a teacher come from God
[58:48] no man can do these things unless God
[58:50] was with him we all know it the world
[58:52] knows it today
[58:54] the world knows it but why why aren't
[58:56] where is T.L Osborne where are all the
[58:58] ones that that saw the signs and the
[59:00] Wonders
[59:01] but fell away to the Wayside
[59:04] ah or didn't recognize the pearl of
[59:08] great price right
[59:11] now you know we say I I recognize the
[59:14] Pearl a great price I'm sitting in a
[59:16] message Church I'm sitting here
[59:18] listening but
[59:20] are we like Nicodemus right that heard
[59:24] Jesus preach that heard the word and
[59:26] stayed with him right up to his burial
[59:29] and then said well well things aren't
[59:31] aren't going so good now
[59:33] people are leaving the message right and
[59:34] left I I heard somebody say well it
[59:37] seems like a lot of message preachers
[59:39] are ignoring that people are leaving
[59:41] uh
[59:42] or or uh
[59:46] are are not concerned or whatnot
[59:50] you know
[59:52] everybody has a free moral latency you
[59:54] can't control
[59:56] but I I'm until until the Rapture comes
[1:00:00] at as long as there's Grace left I'm
[1:00:03] still concerned about the salvation of
[1:00:05] people I'm concerned about my neighbor
[1:00:06] I'm concerned if he'll keep kicking
[1:00:09] again against the pricks I as long as I
[1:00:12] have an opportunity I'll keep tossing it
[1:00:14] over
[1:00:16] I'm concerned about the foolish virgin
[1:00:18] I'm concerned because uh you know they
[1:00:21] are aversion
[1:00:23] and and if they would I believe if if
[1:00:25] there was a chance they could just
[1:00:27] recognize the pearl of great price
[1:00:29] recognize how true it is and and get a
[1:00:31] personal relationship with with Jesus
[1:00:33] and maybe spend some time listening to
[1:00:35] the tapes instead of just taking
[1:00:36] somebody else's word for it spend some
[1:00:38] time digging into the Bible
[1:00:42] hearing receiving and acting 1960. I
[1:00:46] heard a certain Minister the other day
[1:00:47] bring a little oh I already read that
[1:00:49] let's get there without
[1:00:52] in just a few more minutes
[1:00:54] y'all don't get too tired on me
[1:00:56] sir we would see Jesus but everything
[1:00:59] that we do or say must be based upon the
[1:01:01] word of God because no man can have
[1:01:03] faith unless it comes from the word of
[1:01:05] God Amen Faith cometh by hearing hearing
[1:01:09] of the word now if I told you that a
[1:01:11] certain certain thing would take place
[1:01:12] that might be so it might do that and if
[1:01:15] I tell you that something that seems
[1:01:16] impossible that it happened that it
[1:01:18] could happen but when God has promised
[1:01:20] this thing then you can have confidence
[1:01:22] that God keeps his word
[1:01:24] there's where my faith is built on
[1:01:27] nothing less than the Eternal Word of
[1:01:29] the Eternal God
[1:01:32] here's a good one
[1:01:34] you must be born again 1961.
[1:01:38] now this is the one where the first time
[1:01:40] he preached uh
[1:01:42] uh Dr Davis
[1:01:45] he thought he'd done such a wonderful
[1:01:46] job because he's made the old sisters
[1:01:48] cry and everything
[1:01:50] Dr Davis told him
[1:01:52] he told this is what he told him uh in
[1:01:55] 1961 12 31 he said yes they cry funerals
[1:01:59] cry bursts everything else he said what
[1:02:01] is what it is Billy you never quoted one
[1:02:03] bit of God's word you talked about some
[1:02:05] mother that had been going on or
[1:02:07] something like this and got everybody
[1:02:09] crying
[1:02:10] said you're not born again upon things
[1:02:13] and sensations of this Earth
[1:02:15] you're born by the word
[1:02:24] Hallelujah
[1:02:26] let me kind of find a find another weird
[1:02:28] one real quick
[1:02:32] ah looking at the Unseen 1959 April 10th
[1:02:36] now if God can come on the control tower
[1:02:40] and when the my sheep know my voice well
[1:02:42] now if these all these strange voices in
[1:02:45] the world of this social gospel
[1:02:48] that just belonged to church
[1:02:51] and that's all is necessary
[1:02:53] why hasn't it done something it's done
[1:02:57] nothing
[1:02:58] but confused the people right right
[1:03:01] what we need tonight is Unified Church
[1:03:04] filled with the Holy Ghost and power
[1:03:05] from on high led by the spirit of the
[1:03:07] Living God on the control tower that
[1:03:08] won't say because I'm a Baptist and he's
[1:03:10] a Methodist I'll have nothing to do with
[1:03:12] him and and he goes on but it's done
[1:03:17] nothing but confused the people right
[1:03:18] right and if I could speak plainly I
[1:03:21] think message people today are
[1:03:23] are very confused
[1:03:27] but you know
[1:03:29] there is still a man that can turn on a
[1:03:32] light
[1:03:37] I I
[1:03:39] think many times
[1:03:42] people take other people's word for what
[1:03:45] brother Brandon says and you know what's
[1:03:47] striking that today on you know you can
[1:03:50] find just anything on the internet
[1:03:52] and now the messages on the internet you
[1:03:54] can get it on your phone I can search
[1:03:57] the message and highlight things and
[1:04:00] bookmark things on my way to work
[1:04:03] and yeah we won't read it we won't study
[1:04:07] it
[1:04:07] so that's maybe where I want to close
[1:04:12] is is
[1:04:14] study study God's word and prove it and
[1:04:18] see what's in there because brother
[1:04:20] Branham said that faith is designed to
[1:04:24] see what God wills and wants right when
[1:04:28] you get the new birth you know exactly
[1:04:30] what God wills and wants
[1:04:32] what he wants you to do
[1:04:34] where he wants you to go
[1:04:36] how he wants you to live
[1:04:38] and what's
[1:04:40] far off in your life Journey
[1:04:44] Let's uh let's let's stand our feet
[1:04:48] and I'm just I'm just going to close
[1:04:49] there
[1:04:51] do you love the Lord
[1:04:52] are you grateful for his word
[1:04:55] I'm just gonna um I'm just gonna pray
[1:04:57] real quick
[1:04:58] and then I'll turn him back over to
[1:05:00] brotherdale
[1:05:01] if you have a need just lift your hand
[1:05:03] up
[1:05:05] and I believe he's still the same
[1:05:07] yesterday today and forever he's still
[1:05:09] able to meet our need and give us what
[1:05:11] we have need of
[1:05:14] Lord God we're so grateful to you Lord
[1:05:17] Jesus for your grace to us and for your
[1:05:19] word thank you God for your many
[1:05:20] blessings Lord Jesus
[1:05:22] I pray God as the people go home that
[1:05:24] they'll not forget the things that were
[1:05:26] spoken tonight Lord Jesus but it'll feed
[1:05:28] their soul and they'll Lord you'll bring
[1:05:31] these things to their remembrance Lord
[1:05:33] and show them things to come Lord
[1:05:35] we thank you Lord God for your grace and
[1:05:37] your mercy Lord and Lord I pray God as
[1:05:40] you look down upon this scene Lord and
[1:05:41] see all the hands lifted up with special
[1:05:43] needs Lord that you'll come upon the
[1:05:45] scene Lord and Quicken the word they've
[1:05:47] heard give them power of Revelation Lord
[1:05:50] to know that you're still on the scene
[1:05:51] to heal and deliver and to fill the Holy
[1:05:54] Ghost Lord if there's any Lord that
[1:05:56] don't know you in the experience and
[1:05:58] that with with the token with this real
[1:06:00] personal experience of a living God lord
[1:06:03] I pray maybe tonight when they go home
[1:06:05] Lord maybe they'll kneel by their
[1:06:07] bedside and say Lord God I want to know
[1:06:09] you I want to know more about you I want
[1:06:12] to have that comforter in me that will
[1:06:13] teach me that will let me see the
[1:06:16] kingdom of God because without you lord
[1:06:18] Jesus we we wouldn't know anything Lord
[1:06:21] Jesus without you we'd be lost we'd be
[1:06:24] groping in darkness we'd be blind Lord
[1:06:27] God we're so grateful to you Lord Jesus
[1:06:29] for opening your word Lord Jesus and I
[1:06:31] pray God that you'll just bless the ones
