[2:16] okay let everybody cheer
[2:21] uh I want to turn to First Congress
[2:24] if we might I want to speak a minute
[2:27] about uh
[2:31] one person called King David
[2:36] I think his uh First Chronicles 28
[2:39] uh 18.
[2:53] is that by there am I ready
[2:59] oh yeah
[3:12] I thought that looked real strange First
[3:15] Chronicles 28 First Chronicles 28.
[3:25] aha now this looks a little bit better
[3:29] and this is gonna I'm gonna try to work
[3:31] this into what I want to speak about
[3:32] this morning
[3:33] we're gonna start out first Chronicles
[3:35] 28.
[3:36] and for the altar of incense gotta know
[3:39] that in this part this is David talking
[3:42] to people and Solomon and Lord he's he's
[3:46] set up
[3:49] 28 18.
[3:51] First Chronicles 28 18.
[3:56] is that by there
[3:57] about ready yeah okay anyway David has
[4:02] set up with uh and it's about David's
[4:05] time to move on over and pass this thing
[4:09] on to Solomon and to fulfill what God
[4:12] has told him and brought him here to do
[4:13] and he's telling all the things that
[4:16] he's going to do and build in the temple
[4:18] and all the the gold the silver
[4:20] everything is coming he's telling it and
[4:23] right here I'm reading this and for the
[4:26] offer of incent for fine gold by weight
[4:28] goal for the pattern of The Chariot of
[4:31] the cherubims
[4:32] that spread out their wings and covered
[4:36] the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord all
[4:39] this David said Lord made me understand
[4:41] in writing by his hand upon me even all
[4:46] the works of this pattern
[4:49] y'all understand what David is saying
[4:52] there he's saying the Lord has done this
[4:54] to him he wrote it brought it out said
[4:56] this is what I want you to do my point
[4:58] here you're gonna I'm gonna come on down
[5:00] I'm gonna read 20.
[5:02] and David said to Solomon's son be
[5:06] strong
[5:07] and of good courage and do it fear not
[5:10] nor be dismayed well the Lord God even
[5:14] my God will be with thee he will not
[5:18] fail thee nor forsake thee until thou
[5:21] has finished all the work for the
[5:24] service of the house of the Lord
[5:27] and of course he goes on and tell that
[5:28] the priest and all the Levites and
[5:30] everybody else will be there with him to
[5:32] help him and all of that and of course
[5:34] really when I read this
[5:37] 28 29 my heart is set a fire because of
[5:40] here's a man that had everything in the
[5:42] world
[5:43] they had it all
[5:45] and he it was time for him to do what he
[5:48] was supposed to do and he he put it
[5:51] right back to where it come from he knew
[5:53] that God would always be there with him
[5:55] and and
[5:56] David my my title is going to be we must
[5:59] be different
[6:01] as an end time people
[6:03] and I hope that I get the points across
[6:06] that I want to bring because to do this
[6:08] scripture of Justice you'll have to see
[6:10] that he said he'd never leave us he'd
[6:12] never forsake us he's there he's our all
[6:13] in all this is something I've been
[6:15] speaking about and I'm talking to myself
[6:18] I'm looking at a mirror when I'm telling
[6:20] y'all this because I want you to
[6:21] understand I have shortcomings as a
[6:24] human being a bunch a whole truckload
[6:27] have people that work with me know me
[6:29] every day and see these things and Lord
[6:31] help me forgive me for some of the
[6:33] things but these are things that we do
[6:35] fall into and you have to stop and go oh
[6:37] yeah turn around go back and we gotta do
[6:39] this thing right
[6:41] because being a child of God
[6:43] if I'm gonna act like my father I better
[6:46] be like this word because this word is
[6:47] who he is and that's the way it is with
[6:49] all of us here now I wanna I wanna read
[6:52] some things and this may I don't know
[6:54] how it's going to all work out but
[6:58] nevertheless
[7:00] Lord work it out
[7:02] uh I want to start off by reading them a
[7:04] little thing and and just to show you
[7:06] that we got to be different than what
[7:08] we're looking at here but how close is
[7:10] the difference
[7:12] how close is it Brother Gary Atkins and
[7:15] I was out there talking this morning
[7:16] about something he gave me a great idea
[7:18] about taking the scriptures and going
[7:19] back and showing through all the young
[7:21] people how
[7:23] scripturally what brother Brown brought
[7:25] was great and I was going I was going to
[7:27] get him to really come on out but we ran
[7:29] out of time but Lord willing one day
[7:31] we'll do that and that's what I'm trying
[7:33] to shove this morning a little bit
[7:34] anyway I'm gonna read from the
[7:37] prophets Palmer worm locusts canker worm
[7:41] and caterpillar and I'm gonna read a
[7:42] little simple thing that we all know
[7:44] about everyone else here knows about
[7:45] this because we've been taught this he
[7:47] and this is on the page 33
[7:51] uh paragraph 223 through 224 and he said
[7:55] right here he said the
[7:57] we don't know whether there be any Holy
[7:59] Ghost and he's talking about uh Paul
[8:01] being out there speaking to those people
[8:03] right off the bat about how they were
[8:05] baptizing and of course brother Branham
[8:07] being the prophet it is brings instant
[8:10] understanding to this thing in about two
[8:11] paragraphs that we can all follow he
[8:13] said then how was you baptized it says
[8:17] in King James
[8:19] undo what read it in the original it
[8:22] says how
[8:24] unto what means the same thing unto and
[8:27] how means the same thing how was you
[8:29] baptized
[8:31] they said
[8:33] we've been baptized by John
[8:35] and the same man baptized Jesus now
[8:38] they're saying
[8:39] this is John he baptized Jesus you're
[8:42] going to go tell him he's wrong
[8:45] there's Prophet is going to say that
[8:47] he's going to tell it like it really is
[8:49] because that's a good baptizing by John
[8:52] and the same
[8:55] of the same man watered the same one
[8:58] that baptized John when Paul said
[9:01] that won't work anymore
[9:04] yeah he kind of stood him up when he
[9:06] said that and I know we've all
[9:07] experienced this when we've been talking
[9:08] to people about baptism simple things
[9:10] water baptism but it's not simple
[9:13] it's really not
[9:15] because those people are hung on this
[9:17] and you know if you deal with it this is
[9:19] how close it is to them
[9:21] that won't work anymore that's what Paul
[9:24] said that ain't no good no more he's
[9:27] done come been crucified because John
[9:30] baptized unto repentance not remission
[9:32] of sins saying you should believe on him
[9:35] who come Jesus Christ and when they
[9:39] heard this they walked out into the
[9:41] water and was baptized again in the name
[9:44] of Jesus Christ Paul laid his hands on
[9:48] them and the Holy Ghost come on them
[9:50] they prophesied and spoke in tongues is
[9:52] that right Paul
[9:55] consecrated me and also or two
[9:59] uh had been baptized by the same man
[10:02] that baptized Jesus told them they had
[10:05] to be baptized over because they wasn't
[10:07] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[10:09] Christ
[10:10] all right I say the same thing it's the
[10:13] same Doctrine now what did Paul say in
[10:16] Galatians 1 8.
[10:18] now he done
[10:20] uh that how many knows that the the
[10:25] truth says amen congregation says amen
[10:27] Ed and he said if an angel from heaven
[10:32] let alone a preacher out of a church or
[10:35] a denominational if any angel from
[10:38] heaven comes and preaches any other
[10:40] gospel then this let him be a curse
[10:44] I'm going to stop right there because we
[10:46] know the rest of the story and what
[10:47] happened there
[10:48] now he gets on them even a pastor
[10:51] missionary anybody
[10:53] um but I want I want to
[10:55] show you that
[10:57] that is like I said a simple thing to us
[11:00] but I want to now go back and read the
[11:03] word different and what it means I took
[11:07] four four uh meanings of it from the
[11:09] English dictionary number one it says an
[11:12] adjective partly or completely unalike
[11:17] not identical or the same
[11:20] out of ordinary unusual and I love this
[11:23] one
[11:24] not alike in character or quality
[11:29] um
[11:30] right now I want to turn over to Matthew
[11:33] 24 24. y'all can turn it if you like
[11:35] y'all know what I'm going to read
[11:37] because I want to show you that there
[11:40] are two forces here working at all times
[11:42] and when I'm getting to one point
[11:45] foreign
[11:53] get there
[11:57] uh
[11:59] all right Matthew 24 24.
[12:03] everybody there
[12:05] well that shall arise false cries false
[12:08] prophets and shall show great signs and
[12:10] wonders in so much that if it were
[12:12] possible they shall deceive the very
[12:15] elect
[12:16] I wrote this in last night after I was
[12:18] sitting there having a duel with my
[12:20] computer that was really beating me up a
[12:23] little bit
[12:24] uh
[12:25] and just the daily things of life that
[12:28] people run into with little
[12:30] energy levels floating around
[12:32] uh experience attached to sometime but I
[12:36] was sitting there reading that and I was
[12:38] trying to pull up some other things on
[12:40] this on the prophet's message and I
[12:43] wanted to say that uh
[12:45] here we are that
[12:47] I'm looking at this stuff and what pops
[12:50] up on my screen right off the bat it was
[12:52] like it was the only thing on the
[12:53] computer William Marion Brown false
[12:56] prophet of the age
[12:58] now when you're sitting there trying to
[13:00] pull up something
[13:01] to talk to this group here
[13:04] listen we've heard the word here we know
[13:07] the word
[13:09] I mean
[13:10] we've got to produce you
[13:12] and when they're sitting here and I'm
[13:14] sitting there looking at this and this
[13:16] pops up on the screen I have to stop
[13:18] reading
[13:19] something drew me right to it said read
[13:21] it well when I got through naturally
[13:25] the devil's trying to get me off course
[13:26] here
[13:27] I said well I'll put this on the back
[13:29] burner I know what he said because
[13:31] that's about everything this
[13:34] um I won't say anything about him except
[13:36] he's an unearned person that would say
[13:38] these things about the prophet really
[13:40] don't know anything about him and all he
[13:42] was trying to do was pump up his own
[13:44] flag look at me I'm proving this guy
[13:47] wrong
[13:48] well I got news for you it ain't gonna
[13:50] happen
[13:51] because every argument the man had he
[13:55] shot himself in the foot on every one of
[13:57] them
[13:58] by Miss quote me
[14:00] by his own quotes I doubt he ever read
[14:03] anything from what I read but to make a
[14:05] point it took me to another place
[14:09] and when I seen that that's why I want
[14:11] this Matthew 24 24 because we are
[14:13] different we've got to be different and
[14:15] this is some of the things that we're
[14:16] going to be faced with
[14:19] we're faced with them every day
[14:21] because you get people come in there and
[14:23] they'll come up to you and they'll start
[14:24] talking to you when you see them out
[14:25] there in Walmart and things like that I
[14:27] I used to kind of like oh boy you know
[14:29] something inside of me said no no no you
[14:31] can't do that go talk to them
[14:35] brother random had that problem one time
[14:36] with a prostitute I think come in a
[14:39] restaurant where he was at
[14:42] Lord took him behind the barn talked to
[14:45] him a little bit didn't he well that's
[14:48] the way this this thing if it's going to
[14:50] work it's got to be that level it's got
[14:52] to be that level of love and
[14:53] understanding for the for God's creation
[14:55] because we don't know
[14:58] how this thing's going I mean we know
[14:59] how our part's coming because the words
[15:01] telling us
[15:02] but we don't know who else is to come in
[15:06] I mean you entertain angels unaware we
[15:08] do every day
[15:12] okay I'm getting off my subject here
[15:15] uh let's see
[15:19] I wanted to read some things right here
[15:22] to show God how he's how he's coming in
[15:24] in form and thing and how he has done a
[15:27] little bit uh I'm gonna read to you just
[15:29] a few minutes and then I want to get
[15:31] down to a one last thing that that I'm
[15:34] going to bring that I hope that this
[15:37] made sense to all of you uh and Shalom
[15:40] is the message Sierra Vista Arizona on a
[15:45] Sunday
[15:47] 640112 uh I've read
[15:51] there's 252 and remember when the full
[15:55] Bible listen and closing when this full
[15:57] Bible has been thoroughly Vindicated and
[15:59] there will be an eternal Shalom
[16:02] Eternal peace see he come and said he
[16:05] was peace on Earth Good Will towards men
[16:07] but
[16:09] the world didn't receive it see see he
[16:12] was peace to everyone that come to him
[16:15] for peace see so I'll understand that I
[16:18] said whoever comes to you get what you
[16:20] ask for from him
[16:22] because he's our father he wants us to
[16:24] be happy right he didn't put us here to
[16:26] be miserable or not get along one
[16:28] another because she had a loved one
[16:31] he was pleased to everyone that come to
[16:34] him for PC peace on Earth Good Will to
[16:37] men he was at peace at that new year
[16:40] beginning new day of God for why he was
[16:45] a a Vindicated light on that day see but
[16:49] there's more word to be Vindicated or a
[16:52] Vindicated
[16:53] he's got to vindicate more words and
[16:56] when the last word is dove Vindicated is
[17:00] Vindicated rather than death is
[17:03] swallowed up in Victory and the dead in
[17:05] Christ shall rise the Millennium will
[17:07] set in and it will be
[17:10] great peace Shalom let's lay up for that
[17:13] day brother and sister well that one
[17:15] great Shalom remember the Bible is the
[17:17] foundation of all wisdom and holds all
[17:21] holes of the future to the church Shalom
[17:23] let us pray
[17:26] now unveiling of God
[17:29] in Jeffersonville
[17:32] 640614 IN morning service paragraph 77
[17:36] now when it was said that
[17:39] week
[17:42] so oh
[17:46] I'm trying to figure it out my computer
[17:48] kind of printer kind of messed me up
[17:49] there
[17:51] a weird thing like this
[17:55] the English word I'm going to skip that
[17:58] one okay because I can't read it clearly
[18:00] and so I don't want
[18:01] a spark plug there
[18:03] but I will read the other section of it
[18:06] that is he changed himself he he was
[18:09] talking about right here that uh the
[18:11] English word are the emptied poured out
[18:14] of him or see something went out of him
[18:17] that was different from him he was
[18:19] different he wanted this to come out he
[18:21] wanted it to be displayed but the word
[18:24] kinos in the Greek
[18:26] does not mean that he bought it up or
[18:28] something his arm went off or his eye
[18:31] went out to another person that is he
[18:33] changed himself he poured himself into
[18:36] another mask into another form not
[18:40] another person went out of him called
[18:42] the Holy Spirit but it was he himself
[18:45] you get it he himself poured himself
[18:48] into the people Christ in you how
[18:50] beautiful how wonderful to think God
[18:52] poured himself into human beings into
[18:55] the believer poured out it was a part of
[18:58] his drama to do so God all the fullness
[19:01] all that God had bodily was in this
[19:03] person Jesus Christ he was God and God
[19:06] Alone not a third person or a second
[19:09] person or first person but the person
[19:11] God bailed in human flesh
[19:14] unveiling God I'm going on down to 79
[19:16] now first Timothy 3 16 without
[19:18] controversy great is the mystery of
[19:21] godliness for God Elohim
[19:24] Capital God in the Bible referred it
[19:27] back anybody it refers to in the
[19:29] original it said Elohim
[19:32] in the beginning Elohim C and Elohim
[19:35] without controversy great is the mystery
[19:37] of Elohim for Elohim was made flesh and
[19:40] we handled him
[19:41] Elohim bailed in human flesh the great
[19:44] Jehovah that covered all of his face
[19:46] time and everywhere was made man we
[19:49] handled him Elohim in the beginning
[19:51] Elohim and Elohim was the flesh dwelt
[19:54] Among Us
[19:55] uh going on down what this is the way
[19:58] the parts of drama
[20:01] that's the way he's to act it out God's
[20:05] provided way Prophet preached a message
[20:07] on that
[20:09] his wife
[20:11] of rebuilding himself to us as some
[20:14] different person
[20:16] okay we are mortal and he knows that
[20:21] we only understand as morals we only
[20:24] know as morals we only know as our
[20:27] senses will let us know and the rest of
[20:29] it we have to believe by man we have to
[20:32] say there is a God whether we see him or
[20:34] not we believe it any anyhow
[20:38] whether there is or not we still believe
[20:41] it because God said so remember that God
[20:44] said something I didn't say so God said
[20:47] so that's what you want to remember
[20:51] now
[20:52] this is a identified Christ of all ages
[20:56] Topeka Kansas
[20:58] 640617 you see all these things just
[21:01] portrayed Christ he was part of it God
[21:04] doesn't change his nature doesn't change
[21:06] he his character doesn't change he's
[21:11] still the word see Malachi 3 6 proves
[21:14] that he just
[21:16] changes his form from each age each age
[21:19] he has allotted part of the word which
[21:23] has been prophesied what happened in

[22:12] dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and
[22:15] of the joints in Maryland is a discerner
[22:18] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[22:20] heart I'm not going to stop there I want
[22:22] to continue reading neither is any
[22:24] creature that is is not manifested in
[22:27] his sight but all things are naked and
[22:30] opened unto his eyes of him
[22:33] what do we have to do
[22:36] seeing then that we have a great high
[22:39] priest that is passed into the heavens
[22:42] Jesus the son of God let us hold fast
[22:45] our profession
[22:48] hold on that word
[22:51] for we have not and high priest which
[22:54] cannot be touched with the feelings of
[22:56] our infirmity but was in all points
[22:59] temping like as we are yet without sin
[23:03] Amen Let Us therefore come boldly to the
[23:07] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[23:10] and find Grace to help in time of need
[23:15] um I just to bring out a few examples of
[23:18] that and I think
[23:20] what a wonderful thing to be able just
[23:22] to go to the throne of God and say
[23:24] father forgive me I know I've seen
[23:26] and we have to do that I do I don't know
[23:29] about y'all but I have to every day
[23:30] every morning before I started my day I
[23:33] said Lord let me put the armor on
[23:34] because I know what we're going to go
[23:36] dealing with uh in our business we deal
[23:38] with people who are unfortunate
[23:41] they really are
[23:42] but you should see some of the struggles
[23:44] those people go through
[23:46] if you don't think you'll blessed people
[23:48] and you're different come to our house
[23:51] watch these people walk in there with
[23:53] their children
[23:54] listen
[23:56] they're scratching just to stay alive I
[23:59] thank God for every one of them and that
[24:01] he'd lift them up and I thank God he
[24:03] sent them to us because if nothing else
[24:05] I can walk in and see what we represent
[24:09] the word
[24:12] and a lot I'm gonna talk to us about it
[24:14] and and I hope and I know that once this
[24:17] seed is put out to them that it comes
[24:19] back
[24:20] and I hope it does with each and every
[24:22] one of them because listen we got to
[24:24] stop and think about the things that are
[24:25] in our lives that that we have that we
[24:28] don't appreciate
[24:32] I'm guilty
[24:33] I am guilty about that I just gonna go
[24:37] over this I got a few minutes y'all to
[24:38] get tickled at me here because I wrote
[24:40] down a bunch of things the other morning
[24:42] by 4 30. this just come to my head and
[24:44] really who was the first on my list
[24:47] of being different talking about
[24:50] difference uh when I first come to this
[24:52] over here y'all know I was different but
[24:55] I was called something brought me here
[24:57] and it was the love I felt for my mother
[24:59] and my daddy
[25:01] I could see all the hard work my daddy
[25:03] done his whole life he was like a mule
[25:05] he pulled a cloud he busted rocks but he
[25:08] got her done
[25:09] none of his sons wound up going to
[25:11] prison or got into any major trouble
[25:14] by the grace of God
[25:16] and we all were workers every one of us
[25:19] none of us sat down and were lazy people
[25:21] because he taught us all those things
[25:24] I got the best out of him and I will say
[25:26] that for the last three years
[25:29] it was a pleasure
[25:31] to have him as my father
[25:34] to sit there and talk to this man about
[25:36] the seals
[25:37] him 84 years old and he'd wake up and
[25:41] he'd say tell me what you know
[25:43] well it didn't take me long
[25:45] but I would tell him
[25:47] the best I could and he'd say well
[25:49] that's fine
[25:51] now let me tell you what I think
[25:54] he went through the seals
[25:59] Lord help
[26:01] he went through them
[26:04] in just a few minutes for the frame corn
[26:09] and I said Lord and then he dropped
[26:13] right back off and went back to sleep
[26:15] and I'm sitting there so tired I can't
[26:17] hardly stand up myself but when he spoke
[26:20] of that
[26:21] I said wow here he is barely on his last
[26:25] breath and he's still pumping this out
[26:27] what a volume
[26:29] it's brother Mark said
[26:32] and uh
[26:33] it's a wonderful thing we have here I
[26:35] want everybody to see that regardless if
[26:38] the day comes to an end if they walk in
[26:40] here and say
[26:41] you're done we're taking you crazy
[26:43] people out of here
[26:46] I hope this is an empty building
[26:49] and everybody piles in
[26:51] if I was in line I hope I'm the first
[26:54] one
[26:55] but I want to talk about this just for a
[26:58] second here kind of
[26:59] bring a little light to it because we're
[27:01] fixing to go up and get fed some real
[27:03] steak
[27:04] but I wanted to say that the
[27:06] indifference the first person I've seen
[27:08] I run into here wanting to make a
[27:09] difference in my life and he has with
[27:11] brother Wayne
[27:13] now if there's two people in the world
[27:15] outside that would have had a respect
[27:18] for one another way but probably two
[27:21] different because I'm one side and he's
[27:24] the other
[27:25] he's full of energy bouncing around all
[27:27] the time just going going going going
[27:30] and that's not a bad thing that's a
[27:31] great thing because I'm a slow person
[27:33] sitting down not doing anything
[27:35] so I need a person like that kind of
[27:37] stirred me along you know buzz me up and
[27:38] get me going but what a difference but
[27:41] once I sing the heart
[27:43] and I know he must have seen something
[27:45] in me other than
[27:47] I'm gonna I'm Gonna Fill his heart with
[27:50] what I know in his mind I'm gonna get
[27:51] I'm gonna put something in that mind
[27:53] that can go down besides junket he's
[27:55] heard all his life
[27:56] and he has done that
[27:58] the Lord is blessed by the way and guess
[28:01] what I've been blessed by it okay we've
[28:04] all been so blessed by this word that's
[28:06] come here from Brother Dale and the
[28:08] ministry in this church it's real it's
[28:10] proof
[28:12] it's all I can say about it and I wanted
[28:15] to go on down it's just like think about
[28:17] King David standing out there
[28:20] he had to go up against Goliath
[28:23] what does he do he goes down there and
[28:24] pick him up five little stones
[28:26] little bitty guy
[28:28] and listen folks they have found
[28:30] evidence all needed today that there
[28:32] were giants that live upon the Earth
[28:34] eight Footers
[28:36] 10 Footers they have found evidence
[28:38] science says
[28:40] so
[28:41] it didn't make no difference to David
[28:42] and David was different
[28:44] but when it got right down to it
[28:47] was the price that made it
[28:50] and today
[28:53] we got to reproduce that word
[28:56] called Jesus Christ
[28:59] every one of us do it and it's not
[29:02] something we can't attain to all we got
[29:04] to do is believe in taking this word
[29:06] right
[29:08] and remember that we are blessed people
[29:11] we're most people on this Earth folks
[29:16] we are
[29:19] it's been a pleasure to speak this
[29:21] morning I hope that something has come
[29:23] to let's break your heart a little bit
[29:25] and happier and I want to tell y'all if
[29:28] y'all don't think I love doing this
[29:30] it's a pleasure to stand here in this
[29:33] church
[29:34] with you and speak to you about him I
[29:38] know I wouldn't dare to try to match
[29:40] scripture with none of y'all hold it
[29:44] but I thank God that he's blessed me and
[29:46] put me here just go
[29:48] that's all going to be quota blessed
[29:50] okay pay attention to the state
