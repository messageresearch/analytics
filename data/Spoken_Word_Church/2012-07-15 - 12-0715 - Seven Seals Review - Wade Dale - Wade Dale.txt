TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is the Lord's time not yours you're not made anymore you sleep on the horse okay all right Revelation chapter six now good to see each and every one of you here this morning could have a temp count noon with us always good to have it and I'm gonna be back uh I don't want to talk about being in the Saddles don't talk about horse riders today so just good to be here I want everybody that enjoyed this man to give him a hand stuck bye that was the last time I just understood was February the 19th so time flies you know when you're having fun so I really enjoyed it got some real good things out of it got a couple of sermons working off of it so everybody can be helped sometimes we think we're really insignificant but like I told the ministers yesterday I Holy Ghost Bill woman brother Brown said can help you if you'll listen to her all right so Holy Ghost Bill woman will help you all right so let's go to chapter six now we had been studying on the Seven Seals we got to seal number four and we covered them pretty pretty thoroughly uh back in the first of the year and and back in like November and December but I want to kind of today is going to be a review of the first four then we're gonna go into five six and seven all right and then break it down each seal five six seven all right everybody understand that's where we're going so read the fifth Seal The Sixth Seal and the seventh seal but just if you want to just read the fifth seal or listen to the fifth seal tape that that brother Brown and preached and we're gonna break it down and show you that even though the Rapture takes place at the force deal the fifth sixth and seventh to me are one of the most important ones because it's for Redemption of this guy so we moved from one two three and four in the Redemption of the soul to where five six and seven is going to show you the Redemption of this thing okay this thing and this thing's the last thing is to be conquered is death of this all right if you're born again you don't have to worry about death you're born again in the soul you don't you'll never die but this guy right here is dying every day all right so that's the one we're looking at but we're gonna go through one two three and four today and maybe next Sunday just to make sure you have a background that September I mean uh February's been a long time and brother Bob's been on on lineages and things like that so we're just kind of we're going to try to bring you back to to what we were talking about several months ago um and remember too while I have most of you down here some of you that are signed up for the Dave Ramsey course it starts August the 5th at five o'clock so if you're not signed up and you're going to take it you need to put your name on the board which I think most everybody is signed up and some of you that are have already taken it encourage the ones that are not taking it to take it amen all right amen amen especially better than I was paying for the thing all right so it's free to you and that's a real big help because most people do that but it's an investment for him because you saw all the money that we saved you know the ninety one thousand dollars that with debt we paid off the Forty thousand dollars that y'all saved if we're able to save and then the 380 000 we were able to avoid that much debt which is astronomical to avoid that much debt to avoid almost four hundred thousand dollars of debt that you would have had and you would have still had today had we not went to the 13-week class but the class is going to be nine weeks it's going to be an hour and a half instead of two I put five to seven because we may have a little more discussion June and I are going to go a little more into detail about what brother Brown said about money because up there we had some people that were not Believers now if we it's open to anybody that wants to come we have to open it or we have to do a copyright thing so we're open to anybody but it's mostly all the people in the church so we're going to teach some things that brother Reynolds said about about money and stuff too so we got to still live in the world we got to still have money money won't buy you low but it sure will make you a little bit happier all right so now let's go through this let's read chapter six of Revelation now Dad's getting ready to get into this so you you guys ought to be a man and you ought to be right there with him because you're going to be right in the channel you're gonna be furling down the same same line that he is and he gets out of chapter five he's going right into chapter six in Revelation chapter five is showing the opening of these sales and I want to reiterate one more thing John in chapter 5 John was a born-again Believer and was still crying for Redemption now it is okay so John was crying for a redeemer yet he'd been redeemed for 60 years and his soul he was looking for something else he was looking for the one to take this guy and redeem this guy so that's what we're moving from the first four seals showing the complete Plan of Redemption and then show the Redemption of this guy so I want to kind of keep that little seed into your mind and as Dad preaches up front and as we come down here let that seed cultivate because that's what he's talking about when he starts going through the seals the seals is the complete Plan of Redemption from one through seven is the complete plan of her dancing and and you'll hear quotes where six seals finishes Redemption with six seals finishes Redemption absolutely because the Sabbath is Christ showing you through all the other six the only one sealed to break and that's one the seventh seal and that's Christ because Jesus we prove to you that Jesus Freaks six seals because we read in the Bible in Matthew 24. all right that was just a revelation behind that that had not been that light had not been shining on them so let the first seal but you're going to take a few bullet points and talk about them this morning the first seal with the white horse rider right right he wrote out in opposition as a white righteous church he looked like God that's brother Brown preached and he was the Holy Ghost down Through the Ages riding Out Among the people right so it looked like a white righteous Church I said it looked like one and they started with sayings and then deeds and indoctrines but the saying we started a baby form of what that white righteous church but there had to be listen if the seals is a revelation to Jesus Christ there had to be a white righteous Church on Earth at that time for Satan to copy from that's right Satan doesn't ever do anything first never he can't he's not original he has no seed he has nothing to begin with so he has to follow behind or copy right what God's already done so God in the first church through the through the the lion l-i-o-n the lion you know the lion ox man and Eagle daddy's been thinking he finished that up you know in Revelation 4. but remember one thing and I don't think he brought it out I told him to mention that the other night I hadn't listened to Winston Wednesday night's tape yet but the lion oxman and Eagle always follows the bride because that is the characteristics of the Holy Ghost because when brother random gets to the fifth seal you're going to read and you're gonna you're gonna see where he says the bride's not on the earth because there's no more combat beat so the combat beast that's your whole that's the Holy Ghost that's the characteristics of the Holy Ghost the lion bold strong word Base Ops labor be patient with the people man intelligence the intelligence of God and then the eagle where we can see Revelation like nobody else has seen Revelation before all right so everybody understand that right yes that is the characteristics of the Holy Ghost anywhere you see lion oxman and Eagle you see the bride even in even in Ezekiel he just did not know what to call he called it Christ because really the wheel in the middle of the wheel is Christ where cut your body off and turn it up and it looks like a wheel and there's Christ in the middle of the wheel A Wheel in the middle of a wheel turning your new birth starts from the inside out Ezekiel just knew how to call it a wheel in the middle of the wheel because remember uh let me prove that brother Brown said Jesus Christ when he went to hell and preached to the Sinners remember he come back up through Paradise remember he knocked on the door he said Abraham opened the door and said look there there's the man that that we ate a calf with and he said Ezekiel said there's the willing he saw Christ but he didn't know what to call this great man that he was looking at so it was a wheel it was it was God helping Israel down through their Journey the ox carts rolling the wheel in the middle of the wheel but he was typing Jesus Christ but see you see where Jesus Christ is then therefore the bride is when you put them together in Revelations you see the bride the Bride of Jesus Christ the will here's the will and here's the wheel in the middle of the wheel which is Christ because actually the outside of the wheel doesn't turn anything it's the inside the Hub is what does the turning this is what's just rolling because this thing's got an axle through it and it's turning so it's God turning a group of people pretty simple when you look at the wheel in the middle of the wheel everybody want to go how do you have you just take cut your body in half either God or the devil one of the two then you've got faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience Godless brotherly comments and every one of them's a little pyramid in itself and there you are a complete man we'll see Ezekiel didn't know how to explain that he'd have a dry erase board you probably could draw in the sand but we know now that it's the wheel in the middle of the wheel turning God turning the Bride of Jesus Christ so that's what they said the lion knocks man and eagle is the characteristics of the Holy Ghost in the ages right so when brother around gets to the fifth seal he said the bride goes up in the fourth seal the Rapture takes place in the fourth seal because you don't see the combat beasts anymore everybody got there so now I'm saying amen amen that's what malachite that's right Malachi four he turned he turned the hearts of the children back to the father thank you brother Ray he'll be speaking that Sunday morning I told you one day you're gonna get up and say something he went up because when you see these gone the bride's gone but wherever you see that you see the bride all right everybody got that all right so the line would come out in the first age boldness Paul says if an angel comes from heaven and preaches any other gospel except what you heard from me let him be a curse that's pretty bold right in other words Paul said it ain't nowhere but right here right right it's nowhere but here that's right all right because he had a true revelation of what was going on in that time but like I told him yesterday we talked about Paul saying Grievous wolves have come Among Us but Paul says if you'll keep reading that scripture Paul says and they're already among you yeah working see the devil's got a same thing if that's the devil that's him turning you so he's copying after Christ and that's what it is with the the seals it's not the revelation of Satan brother Brown said he is those seals he went home at the Devil right he was talking about God God is the revelation of those seals Jesus Christ the full revelation of Jesus Christ is in those seals and that's what has been holding from all the other ages it's the full revelation of Jesus Christ because if Paul would have had a full Revelation to Jesus Christ if he would have had this Revelation they would have took a Rapture and they would have been nothing left but it's like brother Tim said the Eternal Word of God was talking about last night Psalm 7 Church ages and there's no way that he could come in any of these ages except the last one because he saw the church ain't it he couldn't break his word so he had to bring the full Revelation over here in the seventh age it couldn't happen in the first couldn't happen in the second you know why it couldn't happen in those ages because I wasn't there well that wasn't there if you got to make this thing personal that's right right that's right like brother Brown said he said in 1963 when he was preaching the various seals he said it's gone from you people you're not even supposed to get it and listen on the tape they're shouting and screaming and praising God in Hallelujah well I wouldn't be I'd be going oh man what'd I miss he said it's not even for you go and live a good simple life he said but right around and coming to the Lord these things will be made known well this is right around the coming of the Lord I believe amen all right so Now's the Time to be made known see because you and I weren't there right there's a reason he said that because I wasn't sitting in the Tabernacle that day I believe that's why he had to say that because he started talking about the radio he said there's little diamond chips in the radio now that don't happen now but back then that's what happened it was receptors inside that radio there was little diamonds and when that lights or that uh radio wave hits that diamond at a certain angle that's where you get 55 megahertz 60 megahertz 750 megahertz that's why it's am 750. back then it was 750 megahertz well it created that many megahertz when that radio wave hit that diamond it created 750 megahertz it was cut a different way well mine wasn't in the radio not yet the radio he was looking at yeah he said because there's Angels going through this building but see we can pick them up we can pick them up now they couldn't pick him up back there because we have the right receptors here to receive they didn't have the right receptors not saying those people weren't born again not saying they didn't have the new birth they had the new birth for their time right right they live their life a good Christian Life and died and went by the grave and you know what they're waiting on you and I to bring them up all right so no discredit to the people that were sitting at the Tabernacle I don't think he said it I don't think he said the Holy Ghost has gone from you know they all a lot I've saved a lot of them had a new birth but they didn't have this Revelation that we're talking about right now all right and he said it's gone from you and it's not even for you well if he said it's not even for you then it must be for a group of people that it is for that's right okay he said it's not even for you right so it is for us though because we've come under the revelation of the total end time all right now remember 10 30 we got to go uh leaking ball the word up there is more important than the word down here all right white horse rider there was a white righteous church already on the earth in Paul's day before that white horse rider could ride off because he rode in opposition to the church that was there all right so there's got to be a church on the Earth for Satan to mirror or to copy after so there was a white righteous church already on the earth they were they were under the lion age all right which was age number one we're going to go ahead and put them in a church ages because we did when we did them um when we did the uh one through four so the church ages one two and three was the lion age all right it was a white righteous Church and it typed justification right because justification is true justification is you never did it right right but this is baby form justification you know you did it you're starting out as a Christian and God looks at you because the Bible says those who has Justified he has already glorified so if you're truly Justified this morning just in a Justified condition if just if last night you drank smoked and run around with a woman and last night about midnight God come down and said you need to repent and you truly repent and he knows whether you truly repented or not he doesn't give you the Holy Ghost he gives you a way to get to it right because justification is a work of the Holy Ghost what it is it's the Holy Ghost calling you in a baby form you may still have those desires remember you still have those desires to do the same thing you did yesterday but God justifies you and your paper looks just like this I mean it really is it's more like that so this has got lines on it that's what your slate looks like this morning in God's eyes you never did do it in the first place but you've got to realize that because Satan is going to keep popping at you and popping at you and you know what tomorrow if you don't get born again today tomorrow you're going to go and you're gonna probably smoke another cigarette that's right you're gonna probably drink another beer say another cuss word see what's what I'm saying people say well I got born again I quit cussing no you're supposed to quit cussing in the justification and the sanctification the sanctification is the cleaning up part if you're still cursing you don't have you're just you may not even be sanctified and I hate these little words that people say that they're slangs they got words now that they say that means the cuss word but they are able to say it and get by with and I ain't gonna say them but if you want me to tell you later I'll tell you what they are but they sound just like what you're what you're thinking in your brain but you're saying it because you think well maybe I'm a Christian and I don't need to say something yeah I just don't like that at all you really ought not saying anything that you wouldn't go before the pastor and saying is in front of him because God's going to be there anyway God's going to know whether you mean it or not right but but this is a cleansing process and if you're in justification that's okay at least you know that's where you are right and God can God counts that just white righteous because if there's one Speck against you he can't give you the Holy Ghost come on people we got to realize that that justification takes you to glorification remember the sermon Embrace from justification to glorification if you're truly Justified you're just as justifying and glorifying filled with the Holy Ghost potentially because there is come a time you've got to receive it that's right because it's a gift Acts 2 38 says you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost all right so justification baby form I'm Justified God I'm beginning to walk with you but God tells it is righteous so there's your white racist church then another white righteous Church went out that looked like the real Church but it was false started sayings then the sayings become Deeds Deeds become Doctrine Doctrine become law all right so that's what we get us with everything's in a progression okay does anybody have any questions about first days anything I missed or or forgot or I really forgot to read the scripture but let's read it and then now solving the lamb opened one of the seals it hurt as if the noise of thunder everybody won't know what the Thunders are they need to pay attention maybe they're being maybe they're being spoken sometime now one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw so John Saul and beheld behold a white horse and he didn't sell and had a bow and a crown was given under him Crown was given he didn't have a crown Crown was given and he went forth conquering in to conquer now with that white righteous Church the false prophet began to speak right but there was a righteous Church on the Earth and in opposition there goes the wild horse rider same way you got to look in your life here stands a lamb and there goes the white horse rider the white horse rider went out in opposition to this church that's just a baby form just like you're just like your new birth starts in a baby form right you knew bird starts to talk a baby baby form um Jonas has got everything he needs to be a father or Grandpa a worker a Christian all that said enjoyments right now but he's laying in the in a crib and don't have a clue what's going on why he's developing right that's justification he's clean he's pure he's beginning his journey but if if something doesn't change he's going to still have those dirty thoughts those dirty ideas well I don't worry about dirty sauce because we all have them I did I mean the things we do the Deeds we do you know will come out the cursing and drinking and smoking and stuff like that that should be starting to go away from you all right but you still do them and be justified that's so that's okay but you can't stay here because what God moved on that's right I moved to verse 3 and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went another horse so it was another horse because it was another characteristic okay another horse all right now when another horse that was red and power was given look at this power that was given Satan has no power except for what God permits so God's given him the power to do these things and was given to him actually the power comes from where the horse which is the power of the people all right and there went on another horse that was red and power was given to him that set their own to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and that was given under him a great sword so now that's the second that's your red horse that's riding same writer Satan but you look here and you see that this was the fourth Church age correct which was the Dark Ages where Catholicism killed 68 million right here says they should kill one another in other words they were actually killing Christians but they thought they were the Christians killing the infidels you ever heard that that's kind of what's happening now you know we're all infidels and the other people are you know righteous well that same spirit it's the same spirit in them Islamic people it's the same spirit that was in the Catholic Church doing that right there all right which red means always sanctification because the blood of Jesus Christ does what sanctifies you cleanses and claims you all right so the red horse rider there was a there was a red Church there was a church that was that was that was physically physically bleeding he killed 68 million people there's a lot of blood oh yeah all right and brother Brown said Untold billions with their Doctrine but this was literally literally 68 million people died because of this age and this Spirit of this Ox they had but the spirit that that ran horse had was was To Kill right so it says right here to kill so that Spirit they had was the kill let it become a what a false prophet and then over here it comes to what it comes to a false prophet then it goes over and comes into a person this is about where they crown the pope somewhere in here all right in in the in this time they they really got to pulp here a few times in here but he really became in power because he sent a decree out it's better for a man to die for it's better for us to kill somebody trying to make them believe our Doctrine than to let them live that come from the Pope that didn't come from a king they didn't come from a great warrior I come from a cult what the Pope says they did all right but this was just a saying it was just a little saying but here become a deed what is the D that's something you do so that false prophet Spirit they crowned it then it comes over into here and it comes to be he spoke it what is the deed if I tell you to go cut the grass at the church I said D that's telling you a deed to do so that's what he's done he wrote down and said hey it's better for better for us to kill them than for them to live and not be a Catholic all right that's why it's red the red horse was the blood of the Saints but also red is a sanctifier so you got to look at the opposition but you got to look at what God's doing to the people now we know one thing's for sure every Church age had the baptism of the Holy Ghost for their age right because you got the lion Ox you still got them here lion ox man an eagle brother Brown Put them everyone in the church agent all right so every we can talk about sanctification justification all these things but remember the people in this age had the Holy Ghost for their age it wasn't just it wasn't just baby form justification they actually went through justification sanctification the baptism will hold those for their age they went through the same thing but we're talking about the age to see what applies to me and you right right everybody understand we've already been through this one time all right but see right here is where the unclean Spirit goes out remember the Bible says the unclean Spirit goes out of a man walketh and drive places seek a press and findeth none and if you don't fill it with something he's going to come back and fill it himself that's right right and he's going to bring seven of his friends that are more deadly than he was because they're going to be religious devils and they're going to make you think you're born again and that's the worst place to be in it but your characteristics going to show because somewhere in sanctification the unclean Spirit goes out that means the drinking the smoking the cussing the gambling the running around with women that's when that thing gets clean yes and you don't do that anymore I've told you many times the story of of just you know maybe seven or eight years ago I used to say bad words all the time but I was going down the road one day and I was talking to somebody and uh I was talking to one of my friends from out in the world and and I said well somebody ought to just keep that guy and I was going to say rear end or in the rear and the word AWS almost came out but when I got to the word a it's like something took right here and punched me right here and I went he said what did you do I'm driving that road what did you do I said oh nothing I said daughter kicked that guy in the rear they said okay but I almost said the word it was getting ready to come out of my mouth and God wouldn't let it come out it's just like somebody you know somebody hit you right here you're just not some breakfast whatever and it went when it went when I went for the a it went oh he said what happened I said I don't wear that he won't know it was good because he know something happened you know change and is it then you see a change here you see a big change here but don't fall back and stay in that change because that change can give you a religious spirit and then you can worship God you know how you know how I knew I went from sanctification of the baptism the Holy Ghost there was a law of the word I didn't understand and then when God started putting the word together see that's the real reason brother Brown said it's when you can accept the message for your day that's right it's when you know you got the Holy Ghost now except means just say oh I accepted yeah no that means we you accept something when when Jim gives me a gift I accept it it becomes mine and you know what I can use it so that's when I knew I had the new birth is when God started putting the word together and it just kept cuddling and kept coming and kept coming and I'd be sitting and listening to these preachers and they start preaching false Doctrine and a little bell would go that ain't right that ain't right we sat in the crowd of 600 people we told you this before and a brother gets up preaches some false Doctrine and everybody in the place jumps up and screams and shouts and all over the Praises God most of them wasn't paying attention today was about 10 or 15 I was sitting there then we never moved because I wouldn't go to amen something I didn't agree with of course the people look now now that's like they thought we were stupid but I wouldn't go away man something I didn't agree with all right amen I don't care what people some big man in the message and over 600 people got out and shouted follow me man the same people that on Palm Sunday said Hosanna to the king praise God this is our this is our man this is our Messiah within one week with less than a week from that Sunday to Friday them same people killed that man and said let his blood be on us and our children in four days their mind was changed from somebody changed their mind and kill that same man as they laid The Palms down and said Hosanna to the king their King had come back right four days later some ecclesiastical Pharisee or sadducee or or somebody had got to those people and they were crying for his blood in four days okay sanctification I think we're going to stop right there we'll do these other two next Sunday but if you want to write this down I'll leave it up here but the fourth age was the ox age the ox was what a beast of burden also the arch was used in sacrifice so that's your sacrificial and also the Beast of Burden Reed Fox's book of Martyrs read some of the the early history of how those people would actually go in to be killed and they would they would go in so freely until some of the Roman people that were guarding them said hey we want what they've done and they willingly walked into the lion's den they willingly walked into death saying I believe what these people believe because your Sanctified life is what people see and Buddy they'll pick you apart but you better make sure you sharp on that you pencil sharp on everything you do all right let's go up there
