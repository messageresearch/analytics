[0:00] yeah
[0:02] yeah how about you I'm all right this
[0:05] morning
[0:07] all right so all right let's get started
[0:10] uh your homework was to look up the
[0:13] definition
[0:15] of virtue right so
[0:19] anybody wanna
[0:20] go first
[0:25] but I got it right here but I wanna
[0:28] I wanna see what your definition
[0:29] conversion is anybody got a definition
[0:37] um
[0:41] is the righteousness is the strength
[0:46] that somebody can capitalize under it
[0:48] because like we discuss this morning
[0:51] when the lady that touched uh Jesus
[0:54] called me she felt that she had the
[0:57] faith that he had virtue in him and she
[1:00] got the healing he's the person that's
[1:02] born in in us and the faith that we have
[1:05] we won't be together
[1:18] because if you don't um
[1:21] you know Jesus was standing there drunk
[1:23] and had two prostitutes in his arm you
[1:25] know I mean the woman would never have
[1:29] she couldn't draw any strength from that
[1:30] right she had to know you know like the
[1:33] little woman at the well I know that
[1:34] when Messiah we know the one Messiah
[1:36] coming he'll do these things what was
[1:38] she doing she was identifying what she
[1:40] had got from previous learnings and then
[1:44] she was standing in front of the very
[1:45] Fountain of virtue and she could relate
[1:48] to that
[1:49] all right anybody else
[1:53] um
[1:54] it seems that the virtue that Jesus
[2:01] rather than a moral character because of
[2:04] change
[2:07] there seems to be another another
[2:10] meaning
[2:12] strength you know people that we go get
[2:15] a strength and singing muscle lifting no
[2:17] the strength this strength that they're
[2:19] talking about here is
[2:21] it's more it's more of a value of a
[2:24] person
[2:26] as far as what's inside because you got
[2:29] to have them we'll read some quotes in a
[2:31] minute but um
[2:33] look The Virtue Jesus had the virtue we
[2:36] need can't be different because that's
[2:37] where it come from
[2:38] and it can't be two different virtues
[2:40] that mean the same virtue and it's the
[2:43] same strength and you'll read brother
[2:44] Branham he'll say he got weak he got
[2:48] weak because virtue but he said you did
[2:51] it I didn't do it and he said you did
[2:52] you drew the virtue out of me so that's
[2:55] the same thing with Jesus so there's no
[2:57] and same thing with you and I now you
[2:59] and I now there has been one time in my
[3:01] life that I have felt that weakness
[3:04] and that was in Jamaica several years
[3:07] ago
[3:08] that that the people were drawing so
[3:11] much strength till
[3:13] he has allow them because it's just it's
[3:15] like you'd run up marathon and you had
[3:18] to take two steps
[3:20] but see it's not only for healing
[3:23] actually healing is a very small part of
[3:25] virtue very small
[3:28] the very reason we come to church today
[3:30] is that we feel that brother Dale has
[3:31] virtue to preach the gospel that's going
[3:34] to connect back to you and I right well
[3:36] see that's the same way with Jesus the
[3:38] same way if he had not lived a life
[3:40] preached the word that he was and and
[3:42] all those things then the woman
[3:46] that the whale or the woman that was
[3:47] touching His Garment she didn't ever
[3:49] touch the garments
[3:51] but it was virtue it was strength and
[3:52] it's not it's not physical strength but
[3:55] yes it is strength as far as when you
[3:57] draw virtue out of someone you draw
[3:59] strength and brother Brown they have to
[4:01] carrying him off so it was physical
[4:02] right
[4:04] did they not carry him off the platform
[4:07] did Jesus not sit down and lay down in a
[4:10] boat when they absolute category five
[4:12] storm was going on in the boat and he
[4:14] was still asleep
[4:15] and you know what this wasn't no huge
[4:17] boat right the boat probably wasn't much
[4:20] bigger than that room
[4:21] and he was laying down asleep and the
[4:23] water would probably run around said he
[4:24] was coming from a healing campaign and
[4:27] he was so tired into a physical strength
[4:31] was drawn from him all right so we got
[4:34] to look at that that virtue is
[4:36] strength and it's not sitting here at
[4:39] mine the one I got says manly strength
[4:41] it's not
[4:43] manly as in you know
[4:46] huge muscles bench 600 pounds that's not
[4:49] the virtue was talking about because
[4:50] brother Random Hill he'll tell you you
[4:53] say I've seen people that was you know
[4:55] six foot tall and horseback ten six foot
[4:57] tall pretty big six foot tall and big
[4:59] arms and he said not have one ounce of
[5:01] man in them white there was no strength
[5:03] Inner Strength there was no virtue that
[5:05] anybody could draw from so anybody else
[5:07] have a
[5:09] okay
[5:10] power in the words okay all right
[5:14] Behavior showing World standards
[5:17] goodness virtuousness righteousness
[5:20] morality Integrity dignity rectitude
[5:24] honor decency respectability nobility
[5:28] worthiness and Purity a lot of people
[5:31] and we'll read it I think I got the
[5:33] quote where in the Statue of a perfect
[5:35] man that brother Brown said it's not
[5:38] this virtue is not being a virgin
[5:41] okay has nothing to do with that but it
[5:45] does have something to it you got to
[5:46] keep your life clean you understand but
[5:48] that's virtue after you're born again
[5:50] we're not worried about you
[5:52] doing something wrong you know not being
[5:54] a virgin after you understand what I
[5:55] mean
[5:57] not going in and having an act that you
[5:59] shouldn't have had
[6:00] if you didn't have one when you said or
[6:02] you definitely shouldn't have one when
[6:03] you're a Christian you know you know
[6:05] find you a good woman and get married
[6:07] and have fun
[6:09] and make sure you got your hand up yeah
[6:10] I'm sorry that's what struck me because
[6:12] we have the authority to say and you
[6:16] know once we give that virtue to say we
[6:19] have the guardian speak and say I'm
[6:21] Healed you know whatever that's what
[6:24] really
[6:25] it's inner
[6:27] strong
[6:29] because that's what
[6:32] Authority is no way
[6:34] thank you see that's what I wanted
[6:38] everybody to look and see everybody goes
[6:41] well it was for the woman it was for
[6:43] this one but
[6:44] that faith and virtue's got to come with
[6:46] you verse Peter Peter did not walk up to
[6:50] the gate beautiful and just realized he
[6:54] had virtue
[6:55] now I believe Peter knew he had Birch I
[6:58] believe Peter had been talking to God
[7:01] I believe God will show anything
[7:03] and then when the guy says hey
[7:07] you know Peter said silver gold how
[7:09] about none in other words Peter did like
[7:10] I said many times Peter didn't have to
[7:11] go back to the Bible to get his strength
[7:14] because there wasn't one he was writing
[7:16] it at the time there was Old Testament
[7:19] Scrolls but it didn't have the power
[7:22] come on he didn't have the power that
[7:24] Peter had
[7:25] because Peter was on the mountain when
[7:27] Jesus even said he said now I have a
[7:28] more sugar order property well the more
[7:30] more sure word of Prophecy is is he knew
[7:32] he was standing
[7:33] and that he could give virtue
[7:36] you got to know from the inside
[7:39] you got to know from here that you've
[7:40] got virtue right right and it's a
[7:43] confidence Builder that somebody else
[7:45] can draw strength from that right but
[7:48] you got to have it for yourself
[7:51] Jesus had it for himself Jesus was
[7:53] confident in who he was right program
[7:55] zip code he knew who he was he had all
[7:58] the virtues working in his life
[8:01] because he was doing very virtuous made
[8:04] manifest in the human collection and was
[8:06] able to live a human life
[8:09] and have virtue
[8:11] knowledge temperance
[8:14] so that's good
[8:17] next everybody understand that we got we
[8:20] got we got virtue that is going from you
[8:23] in the virtue of this end
[8:28] it says uh
[8:35] went from him to heal a woman
[8:38] and was sick he was expecting the same
[8:40] virtue in his shirt because he was our
[8:43] example
[8:45] to give to the people he expects us to
[8:48] have mercy to give to her okay
[8:54] got to have confidence
[8:56] before you can give it out
[8:59] but you know what it's a revelation
[9:01] every one of these are a revelation
[9:02] every one of these are is a birth
[9:05] it's a birth of God that's uh we're
[9:08] going to read maybe I think I got one
[9:09] before brother Brown says it virtue
[9:12] a lot of people have virtue there are a
[9:13] lot of people in this world but I like
[9:15] being around and they ain't one bit of
[9:16] Christian that ever was but they have
[9:18] certain characteristics about them
[9:19] that's what I learned
[9:21] but now I'm not gonna sit there and draw
[9:24] strength in my Christian Life from that
[9:27] but in my healing life you have a lot of
[9:29] people even that are that are good in
[9:31] fine apps and and good in this and good
[9:33] in that
[9:34] well it's good to listen to them if
[9:36] they've been successful
[9:38] you know of course Dave Ramsey is more
[9:41] of a Christian based
[9:44] um organization so he can put his in
[9:46] scripture but there are people there are
[9:48] that are out in the world that you could
[9:50] draw strength from as far as your
[9:52] personal life as far as you know
[9:55] personal thing in another but we all got
[9:57] to go back to one thing the Bible tells
[9:59] you how to raise kids
[10:01] why
[10:10] like we just read and husband
[10:14] so we don't have to get it from somebody
[10:16] like a lot of people said before I know
[10:19] Daddy mentioned it a lot that people
[10:20] write
[10:22] um how to raise kids and they've never
[10:23] had a kid in their life right well now
[10:26] to me that's I can't draw virtue from
[10:28] that
[10:30] I can't draw virtue from that I'd rather
[10:32] listen to Gabby
[10:36] I'm honest yeah sure this guy can have a
[10:39] PhD lld
[10:42] d-u-m-b or whatever
[10:46] but I'm going to listen to somebody
[10:47] that's raising three kids they had to
[10:50] listen to somebody that's you know yeah
[10:53] write a book up somewhere and never had
[10:55] a experience with children in their life
[10:57] like you got what technology right and
[11:00] head knowledge is not this knowledge
[11:02] this knowledge is okay but it's got to
[11:04] drop down to here that's why that
[11:05] knowledge right there has nothing to do
[11:07] with your school
[11:08] or your schooling that's right as far as
[11:11] natural school all right but now but
[11:14] watch how these virtues are
[11:17] you better joke
[11:20] okay
[11:27] but virtue
[11:30] or anybody else
[11:31] anybody else got one
[11:35] because it's first roll around
[11:37] we've got about 10 out of one of the
[11:40] paper Conformity of one o'clock at Honda
[11:43] Memorial and ethical principles
[11:46] all right
[11:50] so it all comes back to a an overview is
[11:54] is the life you left right
[11:57] the life you live reflects what's inside
[11:59] of you
[12:01] can't help it
[12:02] is going to happen
[12:05] okay one way or the other and then we
[12:07] can draw as Christians we can draw
[12:10] strength from that and
[12:13] watch what God's doing he's he's not
[12:16] these are Holy Ghost
[12:18] um virtue okay I'm talking about virtue
[12:22] one but virtue is These Are Holy Ghost
[12:23] given virtues so that's the way he acts
[12:28] so when we can connect to that
[12:30] we know that that person's got Holy
[12:33] Ghost virtue
[12:34] and let's go one step further
[12:37] it's got to be exercise
[12:39] that's right not an exorcism it's got to
[12:42] be exercise
[12:44] all right like running all right you
[12:46] gotta keep that heart pumping that's the
[12:47] same thing with virtue when Jesus but
[12:49] now Jesus never got up on a stool or a
[12:52] pedestal
[12:53] and said hey you've got to look at me
[12:55] now he did he was confident in a way
[12:57] where he said I am the resurrection in
[12:59] the life because he was the one but now
[13:01] watch old Peter
[13:02] all right Peter said look on me
[13:05] so you got to have that inner confidence
[13:06] not where you have to he didn't have to
[13:08] get up like a scene out of it what I'm
[13:10] saying uh we look at that at that scene
[13:13] where Peter and whoever that was walking
[13:15] in the gate beautiful
[13:17] is is there's only them two in that one
[13:19] man
[13:21] no if you no there's thousands of people
[13:23] moving around and he probably wasn't the
[13:26] only beggar that was there
[13:27] right right
[13:28] surely the goodness he wasn't the only
[13:30] Banker sitting there all right all right
[13:32] so something happened to that man
[13:35] he had he was calling and calling and
[13:38] Peter said look on us
[13:40] so when he got the man's attention from
[13:42] all this other stuff out here not the
[13:44] man's attention he said silver and gold
[13:46] how about none but such as I have if
[13:48] you're buying the name now the
[13:50] definition of virtue that I saw from the
[13:52] uh
[13:53] dictionary was
[13:56] Conformity to a standard of right or
[13:58] morality which is correct
[14:02] a particular moral
[14:05] excellent
[14:07] virtue
[14:09] and it says Celestial hierarchy a
[14:12] beneficial quality or power of a thing
[14:15] manly strength or courage Valor a
[14:18] commendable quality or trade now look
[14:20] man says it's a commendable quality of
[14:23] trade
[14:25] now brother Brown said it's a
[14:27] requirement
[14:28] it's not just commendable it's required
[14:31] that we be that right it's a requirement
[14:33] that we have these things working in our
[14:36] life
[14:38] and look at this one number six
[14:41] a capacity to act
[14:45] potency
[14:48] Peter
[14:51] has the incapacity to act
[14:53] because he had it in him
[14:56] walking down the road he had potency in
[14:59] other words a man said
[15:01] um I'm for the poor or whatever you know
[15:03] Peter would
[15:06] I ain't got nothing for you man
[15:08] I don't have nothing for you I'm I'm no
[15:11] he had some potency
[15:16] he had what he needed
[15:18] and the man drew it a capacity to act
[15:21] Peter would have never shopped
[15:24] but the Holy Ghost in him was telling
[15:26] him
[15:28] stop
[15:30] and he's looking to say look on me look
[15:33] on us in other words get and remember
[15:34] what brother Brown would say
[15:36] he'd say lady look at me what is he
[15:39] doing he was getting attention to focus
[15:41] in on one thing not a lot of people
[15:42] shouting and speaking in tongues and
[15:45] praying around him or jumping up and
[15:46] down or anything he said look at me well
[15:48] what Peter with the same wife he said
[15:50] look on me all right so right here is
[15:52] the one on the angel of the Lord in 1951
[15:54] brother Brown said the woman that
[15:56] touched him of His Garment got the
[15:57] blessing she asked for it he felt virtue
[16:00] go out but when them men that knowed he
[16:03] was a Prophet this was a point here I
[16:05] want to make
[16:06] but when the men that noted he was a
[16:08] prophet as a woman at the well knew he
[16:10] was a prophet put a rag around his head
[16:11] and hit him in the head with a reed and
[16:13] said now if you're a prophet tell us who
[16:15] hit you they didn't feel no virtue did
[16:18] they it was the way you approach it
[16:21] now Jesus had the same virtue in him
[16:24] when they put the rag around his head
[16:27] and said prophesy and tell us right
[16:31] because remember Peter even rebuked
[16:32] Jesus
[16:34] because people said Lord everybody's
[16:36] touching you
[16:38] so it's not just the physical touch it's
[16:41] got to be that capacity to act or that
[16:45] strength that's already inside of you
[16:48] all right same way with you your your
[16:51] children natural children
[16:53] they drug should be able to draw virtue
[16:56] I said should be able to draw virtue and
[16:59] strength from you as a parent
[17:01] right and I know we fail miserably doing
[17:04] that but still
[17:06] I've told you many times before I wanted
[17:09] in my life what made daddy act the way
[17:12] he did in his life because he thinks
[17:13] he's a failure and I think he did a good
[17:15] job
[17:16] raising you know raising the children
[17:18] and uh and mom also if you can draw a
[17:21] virtue from that too you draw a virtue
[17:23] really from the mothers from the morning
[17:24] you do the
[17:26] come on I mean because mothers mothers
[17:28] are the one that nurtures you right
[17:29] she's the one that Daddy's kind of there
[17:31] to correct a little bit but that
[17:33] Mother's there to be with you every day
[17:35] you know day in and day out so
[17:39] we have
[17:40] it's the very same virtue though
[17:44] it's the very same virtue
[17:48] but see like I said remember Brothers
[17:50] some people can have a virtue and not
[17:52] have the Holy Ghost there's a lot of
[17:54] virtuous parents out there that raise
[17:56] their kids right and they smoke drink
[17:58] pests and don't you know but normally
[18:00] they it's not that way okay normally if
[18:03] they're sorry parents they're sorry
[18:05] children
[18:06] but if you've got some good got good
[18:08] people that's just being good that's
[18:10] just drawing moral strength from a moral
[18:13] standpoint we're talking about something
[18:15] higher than that
[18:19] come on we're talking about we're
[18:21] talking about Heavenly virtue this is
[18:23] the virtue that comes straight from God
[18:25] not just because you were made by God
[18:28] and you have this virtue because a lot
[18:31] of people like I'll go back again
[18:32] brother remember a lot of people's got
[18:33] these virtues and not even born again
[18:38] but being a good parent and being a
[18:40] God-fearing parent and putting all that
[18:42] together virtue is really to me virtue
[18:45] is
[18:47] whites down there see the pyramid is
[18:49] down there right next to Faith
[18:52] if you don't have that strength
[18:55] for people to draw from me like Lisa
[18:58] said for you to draw off yourself
[19:01] gotta come from you first that Fountain
[19:04] don't flow over there
[19:06] in the corner that Fountain flows from
[19:09] here right all right so you come from
[19:11] right here Jesus said didn't have to go
[19:13] get it you don't have to go get it it
[19:14] should be inside of you but that's one
[19:16] of Virtues down there right next to
[19:18] Faith
[19:19] because without virtue without virtue
[19:21] and confidence in yourself how are you
[19:23] going to have knowledge
[19:25] right because faith is just believing
[19:29] come on now Faith is just
[19:31] there it is I believe it but now virtue
[19:36] virtue you got a lot to deal with with
[19:39] Merchant
[19:40] but it's lying right there in the face
[19:42] that you have faith add to your faith
[19:46] add to what you believe
[19:48] virgin and man when you uh
[19:51] you know to me Peter
[19:54] Peter was a man that was I'm trying to
[19:56] pick my words right Peter was a
[19:59] um
[20:01] sometimes a renegade
[20:03] wouldn't you think cut off a guy there
[20:05] curse Jesus
[20:08] when Jesus even when he resurrected
[20:10] Peter went fishing
[20:14] he's out there naked in a boat you know
[20:16] right everybody swam back and Shore and
[20:19] there was Jesus you know he said I'm
[20:20] going fishing man if somebody that was
[20:22] dead raised from the dead and I saw him
[20:24] three days later I wouldn't be fishing
[20:27] but that was Peter's character but see
[20:29] God took that character that Peter had
[20:33] and he molded that so much to him why
[20:36] didn't Paul come out and show the
[20:38] virtues
[20:40] Paul may have been a virtuous man to
[20:42] start with
[20:43] he was raised under Camellia he didn't
[20:46] have the problems Peter had let me just
[20:48] put it that way right but when Peter got
[20:51] the same he birth Paul did God molded
[20:53] that together
[20:55] and man if you could tell it from
[20:57] anybody you'd have to tell it from Peter
[20:59] fishermen were pretty rough you know how
[21:01] fishermen are pretty rough now you know
[21:03] they're pretty tough individual
[21:06] they're the ones that filled the bar
[21:08] rooms and all that up but for them but
[21:10] for them to see Peter then being Fishers
[21:13] of Men not Fishers of fish
[21:15] and cursing and all that stuff you can
[21:18] draw virtue and strength from that
[21:20] because man something's changed in that
[21:22] verse
[21:24] something's really
[21:26] uh birth
[21:28] it's burped into that person that's what
[21:30] it is these virtues of birth they've
[21:32] birthed into you all right what was your
[21:34] question so when she touched him with
[21:37] his garment she was pulling on his
[21:39] strength is that what it was exactly
[21:41] brother Brandon I'll read it in just a
[21:43] few minutes brother Brown said if just
[21:45] like I said it's not me that does it he
[21:48] said you're pulling the strength from me
[21:50] that's why when he was in a prayer line
[21:52] and he'd be talking to a person even in
[21:55] that video you watch the video he's
[21:56] talking to the person and then he turns
[21:58] his head but when he does that light
[22:00] goes away from that person and goes out
[22:03] in the audience what happened that
[22:05] person out there was drawing something
[22:09] that she needed it was a black sister
[22:12] that she needed something and he turned
[22:14] and he said that life's over that
[22:16] sister's head what happened that lady
[22:18] was drawing virtue
[22:21] Jay from Brother Brown
[22:23] now I don't know because it never
[22:26] happened to me like that but I don't
[22:27] know how in the world because see there
[22:29] were people pulling on him all the time
[22:32] there were just certain ones that I
[22:34] guess was pulling more than the others
[22:36] because because brother Brown said said
[22:37] that you know it's just milky white all
[22:39] over the building that's when he'd fall
[22:41] out and under the anointing well he can
[22:43] only stand it just a little while
[22:45] and because many people were pulling I
[22:48] don't know already picked them out but
[22:49] but that was just God's sovereignty
[22:51] knowing that this person needed it and
[22:53] this person needed this person did it
[22:55] like I said the fruit tree is a
[22:57] substance it's something but it's not
[23:00] seen because they because the woman
[23:03] believes who Jesus Christ was that's
[23:06] right so she knew there was something
[23:07] there that opened the channel the Unseen
[23:10] was what you received yeah and got her
[23:13] view right
[23:14] see the channel opened up right because
[23:17] the other people were touching and
[23:18] moving Jesus around probably in their
[23:20] mental brain they were saying builds
[23:22] above and get out of my way I've got
[23:24] work to do and you understand what I'm
[23:26] saying but the one had a need so here's
[23:29] the need
[23:31] and here's the web
[23:33] here's an aid and here's the well which
[23:35] was Jesus the whale are you or me or
[23:37] anybody here's the whale
[23:40] many times
[23:41] many times you you you shake hands rub
[23:45] shoulders with people and all that but
[23:46] but what about that one person that
[23:48] comes up and says thanks for laying
[23:50] hands on me because I want to take my
[23:51] hands
[23:52] Channel opened up
[23:56] in that spirit world like you said we
[23:58] manifest it
[24:01] but that's what I said about faith and
[24:02] you'll understand this because you show
[24:04] me virtue right
[24:07] show me you know I'll show you this
[24:09] piece of paper
[24:10] the show me virtue
[24:12] I only can show you how virtue Acts
[24:16] because your actions speak louder than
[24:18] you were but I can show you how action
[24:20] how my virtue is because of the action
[24:23] same way with knowledge
[24:26] Paul even says we're gonna get into
[24:28] knowledge because
[24:30] Peter said you can know all Mysteries
[24:34] all Mysteries
[24:36] one God Water by appears on them no
[24:39] eternal hell serpent seed
[24:42] and not have charity you're lost
[24:46] okay not have charity you're lost
[24:50] go ahead let's read a couple of quotes
[24:51] and then we'll read in in mark
[24:55] but why did the person not when the
[24:58] people were beating him on the head they
[25:00] weren't looking for virtue
[25:02] that woman had a need she would had been
[25:07] um
[25:08] well let's just say this she'd been on
[25:10] her period for years
[25:13] she'd never got enough blood in her
[25:17] took me to move around she's been to
[25:19] doctors and Physicians and all these
[25:21] other people
[25:22] but see in her heart she said if I could
[25:25] butt touch
[25:27] the Hamilton garment I'll be made whole
[25:29] she said that see there's the confession
[25:32] now Jesus didn't Jesus remember he was
[25:35] walking down through there and we'll
[25:36] read in a minute and he said turns
[25:37] around says who touched me
[25:39] she must have reached under there and
[25:41] crawled up there and and touched His
[25:43] Garment and then backed out because he
[25:45] turned around he said touch me and then
[25:47] brother animal say the Holy Spirit Led
[25:49] me led him to that person
[25:53] that black sister was pulling his was
[25:57] pulling his
[25:59] virtue and then he went directly to that
[26:01] all right who had her hand up
[26:04] I can see where faith comes first
[26:10] it's like that's what makes that hurt
[26:12] and these people in this place didn't
[26:15] have that failure
[26:17] remember faith is totally something you
[26:20] believe that you can't see that's right
[26:22] now
[26:24] by having that though
[26:28] the virtual show
[26:30] by having that the knowledge of by
[26:33] having that the temperature by having
[26:35] that the patient show oh that's nice to
[26:37] my brother I said New Birth is the most
[26:39] important thing in your life because
[26:41] without the new birth you can't have
[26:42] Godly virtue
[26:44] these are god-given virtues they're not
[26:46] man-given virtues
[26:48] all right the angel Lord we were in that
[26:50] so let's go
[26:52] oh I'm sorry
[26:54] um my friend who said if you can get the
[26:56] people to believe you that's how virtual
[26:58] come out that's right they don't believe
[27:00] you they can't arrest you remember the
[27:02] angel said he said if you can get the
[27:04] people to believe you
[27:06] the point
[27:09] not believe in Jesus
[27:11] believe in you
[27:14] they are nothing will stand in front of
[27:16] you not even cancer
[27:18] okay so that's and you say why not I
[27:22] gotta have faith in God
[27:24] if I see it displayed in a man I don't
[27:28] have to go looking for God
[27:29] I found it
[27:33] oh
[27:36] oh
[27:37] ye are God through the word comes to
[27:42] it that's what I told him about in
[27:43] Kansas I said
[27:44] God wants you to be God
[27:46] it's not that God's tired and God's got
[27:49] too much to do he wants you to be God
[27:53] right why do you make us ambassadors a
[27:56] representative because we got
[27:58] ambassadors all over the world the
[28:00] United States Ambassador who got
[28:01] embassies in every country
[28:03] right now Barack Obama can't be in every
[28:06] country at the same time
[28:08] but he has ambassadors that are in those
[28:11] countries that filter through what he
[28:14] says and then they're the representative
[28:17] of the United States same way with God
[28:19] 's God can God can be anywhere and
[28:22] everywhere he wants to be but he wants
[28:24] to display his attributes through you
[28:26] right I don't think we've come to that
[28:28] realization yet I think brother Dale's
[28:30] trying to tell us something with the
[28:34] um
[28:35] for knowledge of God and all and all
[28:37] that coming
[28:38] showing that you and I
[28:41] we're not just people chosen
[28:45] we're chosen people
[28:47] but not we're chosen we're not chosen by
[28:49] God we're chosen in God okay all right
[28:52] Mark 5 30 and Jesus immediately knowing
[28:54] in himself nobody else knew it but him
[28:57] that virtue went out turned about in the
[29:01] press and said who touched my clothes
[29:03] all right let's keep reading
[29:06] the Greek Lexicon
[29:09] this word
[29:11] for virtue in the Greek
[29:15] means dunamis
[29:18] which is power you've heard brother
[29:20] Ernie Villanova say this word many times
[29:22] if you pay attention
[29:23] dunamis power Mighty Works drink Miracle
[29:27] might that's what that word virtue means
[29:32] strength power and look
[29:35] inherent power
[29:38] power residing In A Thing by virtue of
[29:41] its nature
[29:44] or which a person or thing exerts and
[29:47] puts forth
[29:48] now
[29:51] what happened with the guards
[29:57] they weren't looking for that like they
[29:59] weren't looking for a virtuous man
[30:01] they weren't looking for that so so
[30:02] there was no virtue there for them to
[30:04] draw The Virtue was there
[30:06] they just didn't open the channel but
[30:08] see inherent power power residing In A
[30:11] Thing by virtue of its nature
[30:13] or which a person or thing exerts and
[30:16] puts forth now
[30:18] is it
[30:21] go back to the same thing we're talking
[30:23] about
[30:25] I Gotta Have It
[30:27] people draw from it
[30:30] but it says inherent power
[30:36] inherent power
[30:37] inside of you
[30:40] supreme power in control right
[30:43] and what was supreme power and control
[30:45] brother Brown said that was
[30:47] Jesus there the greatest anointing was
[30:49] when he sat down and saw himself in the
[30:51] Bible
[30:53] right there in Luke he said Spirit of
[30:55] the Lord's upon made him
[30:57] you understand close the book gracious
[30:59] words proceeded from his mouth all right
[31:02] power to perform Miracles moral power
[31:04] and Excellence of Soul the power and
[31:06] influence which belong to riches and
[31:08] wealth of course that's manly stuff
[31:11] let's go to loot and the whole multitude
[31:13] is starting to touch him or there went
[31:15] virtue out of him and healed them all
[31:20] right and then you go down to Luke 8 45
[31:22] this is the different this is the the
[31:24] lady
[31:26] Jesus said who touched me when all
[31:28] denied Peter said that there was with
[31:30] him after the multitude thrown the
[31:31] empress date and say us now who touched
[31:34] me
[31:35] and Jesus said somebody touched me
[31:39] Peter you don't understand but you don't
[31:42] want one of these days that's going to
[31:44] happen to you
[31:46] could he not have told him that Peter
[31:48] probably was like
[31:49] no ain't no way because Peter was kind
[31:52] of The Bodyguard for me and Peter was
[31:54] Jesus's bodyguard you know he was you
[31:56] know when they come to get him you know
[31:58] a sword whacked the guy's ear off you
[32:00] know he was kind of Jesus's bodyguard
[32:02] and Jesus said hey somebody touched me
[32:07] and probably Peter didn't understand
[32:10] do you think Peter understood I don't
[32:12] because he just said he said he was kind
[32:15] of rebuking Jesus he said man
[32:16] everybody's hitting here I'm trying to
[32:18] keep him off of you
[32:19] he said no somebody had touched me for I
[32:24] perceive that virtue has gone out of me
[32:26] that's why I knew that all right now
[32:28] let's read right here
[32:32] now perseverance to be persistent to try
[32:34] to make a goal trying to you've got your
[32:36] mind set on something and you're
[32:37] persistent in it because you believe
[32:39] it's the thing that you want and you
[32:40] believe you can get it now pardon me to
[32:43] be persistent you've got your mind made
[32:45] up now that what you're going to do now
[32:48] you cannot have faith in God without
[32:49] knowing the word of God or knowing
[32:51] something about God
[32:53] now someone told me if you touched that
[32:55] post you'll get well you're sick I
[32:57] wouldn't believe that you might do it
[32:59] but that's just a little too strong for
[33:00] my faith I don't believe there's any
[33:02] virtue in that post
[33:03] no more than I believe there's virtue in
[33:05] the stature remind you in the crucifix I
[33:07] believe the virtue is in Christ and
[33:09] Christ is the word so that's where we
[33:11] draw it from right we keep it inside
[33:15] and then it works its way out all right
[33:18] we'll stop right there and you know
[33:19] redirect to that the next Sunday
[33:23] because when Virgin can joined sure
[33:27] well honestly Jesus had nobody to work
[33:31] through until he came back on his dead
[33:33] Pentecost like he wanted to he had no
[33:35] one to work through
[33:36] foreign was very patient in waiting for
[33:41] that time of the day of Pentecost when
[33:43] he had 120 people that were like-minded
[33:45] and he could use
