come from Honduras brother Josue and give us a little testimony Paulis is going to be here with us for a little bit but Luis is going to be interpreting for him today and it's good to see each and every one of you but we'll get the service started in a minute but we're going to let our Young Brother come up here and uh and give us a report I believe that in just a little short time that God has given me here in this world in this life I haven't had found the desire greater than to be able to be able to say to the bride of Christ God bless you all right I'm very happy for the opportunity that God has given me foreign because it was it's been taught to us that it was necessary for him to to go us but he was going to be with us in another form amen yes and that is going to be in his people the only way that I have it there in this time to be able to to hug the Lord be able to talk to the Lord is to talk to that little part that's in you [Applause] I I wholeheartedly believe that the way I treat you it's the way the Lord treats me amen there's many things that I could say for me that the Lord has done for me impression is one of the greatest things is to to be able to get to know you amen I have really enjoyed the way you all worship and Sierra tacos as different of course there's some things that are different from my country but we're all we're worshiping the same God um I have learned okay perfect the things are have been done in such a perfect way if you look if you take a fish out of the water out of the ocean he dies if you take a Son of God the supresencia out of God's presence he will die he there was a time okay as any young man um the world was calling me we're curiously we're naturally curious about the world it's just that type of curiosity doesn't lead to anything good but the Lord called me back I just want to just say a quick short testimony accident but an accident that I recently had I have not even told them in my church yet back home but I want to share with with this part of the Bride here in in the United States while I was driving um there was a curve that I was going through and I just kind of lost my my thinking I was not able to do the curve make the curve and I just kept going straight there was a tree yeah and I was only uh the only thing I could do was just grab the the steering wheel very tightly and just close my eyes wait for the impact and so that I would not go out out the windshield the Curious Thing was is that when I opened my eyes [Music] I did not hit the tree um I had hit other trees around the other smaller trees and I was the the car was was was turning um [Music] and I was going towards an embankment there was a concrete embankment I was heading towards that when I when I see that wall or that embankment I knew my head it is uh cuantos the only thing that I felt was and then he's asking you how how many of you have ironed clothes before have you burnt yourself with the iron before have you felt that yeah that's what I felt right back here on my side just a little small burn I was about 50 meters away from the area where I was supposed to hit and the car was completely destroyed I came out of there with nothing I was not harmed at all thank you so after that he took me to the clinic and they they looked they looked at me the only the only thing that I had was a little small burn that little burn that I felt right here on my side I believe that the an angel of the Lord or the angel of the Lord maybe as I was getting ready to hit that bigger tree uh maybe he just moved the the steering wheel and maybe that was his touch on the on my side I don't know um no no nothing is and not and coming out out of there not harmed and but yet the car completely destroyed and there's people that have died for Less smaller accidents [Music] um and I would like to show you maybe how how the car ended up let's see I know the brothers can get it get it or not um at some point the anime wanted to make me think that that little burn was was the uh was was the uh seat belt but the seat belt doesn't doesn't touch your backside yeah and then I I I I set up on the on the vehicle and I put on my seat belt the seat belt just goes through right here on the on on the front part and then around our waist but never that never this back part of your back he has something incredible I don't know if you can see how the vehicle ended up like I don't know if I have to do if if it's that the Lord still has something for me to do maybe he just didn't want me to go yet yeah okay I have such a great blessing Mi hermano is my brother is the pastor of the church that I attend he told me bring you all a lot of greetings and well you receive those greetings amen [Applause] I believe that the Lord will allow him to be able to come here and visit with you all soon the Lord the Lord he preaches very well I [Laughter] [Applause] appreciate it it makes me very glad to be with you all

appreciate uh appreciate the Lord you know I tell you I just want to say something real quick there was a lot of time that that when Noah preached he preached for 120 years all right and I'm sure he made a lot of friends he probably didn't have just a Congregation of eight or seven okay probably had a Congregation of you know several hundred if it was in the day of Noah as it is today then you've got a you know congregation maybe like a hundred like we have here or so and but there was one day Noah preached his last message and God shut the door Noah probably did not want that to happen in his Humanity but we all know that we're coming to an end time and his brother Luke was preaching last night there is going to be an end of this race and we're going to run it well but I'll promise you when that door shut on that Ark that was claw marks of those people trying to get in that thing but it was too late I'm not trying to scare you I'm trying to warn you but the art door is getting ready to close we're getting ready this Gentile dispensation will be done away with and there's nothing we can do about it but we're going to get our kids in we're going to get our grandkids in somebody's saying man we're going to get our family in we're going to husbands wives we're going to as the Bible says compel them to come all right we're going to do all we can you can't make them my Mama Tried to save me for 20 something years couldn't do it but when God ever got a hold of me that's the one that'll save your soul that's the one that will drive you to your knees that's the one that'll drive you to think about your soul not about what's going on around you I know it's hard to get to church it's hard to stand up it's hard to do listen like brother Luke was talking about last night and you know being athletic like he is different different things you you train and training has never been cheesecake and ice cream are spoons and forks it's been vital storage stuff you put on and and you know the equipment that you use well listen we've been equipped for this battle somebody will win this race I'm just dumb enough to believe it's all of us amen myself included all right I'm just I just believe you got to be a believer so we're believing I promise you it's worth it there ain't nothing out there in this world you can't sit at home and watch television deer hunt or and that's gonna talk about me and everything else you can just put XYZ in there whenever you want to you sit at home you're not going to get God there I promise you that's why we must be we're hurt animals we're sheep we need Fellowship well I do anyway since we just got one service I'm gonna just talk a minute and y'all just stand up keep you from going to sleep brother Louise will be speaking today and Wednesday night all right so he's going to be interpreting for brother Josue my brother Luis will be speaking uh Wednesday night um remember June in the morning she's having the other rotator cuff surgery and we'll have her there about 5 30 in the morning she'll just keep her in prayer and we would we would appreciate you uh prayers in the continuous six or seven weeks that we're gonna do the rehabilitation so just remember that also next Sunday if all goes well with the surgery I'm going to be at Brother Richard Heights preaching on Sunday brother Aaron will be doing Sunday morning brother Bob be doing Sunday afternoon next week regular service just as it is amen so um I think that's got all the announcements you love the Lord had a good service last night below you that missed it you missed it it was good we had a good service I never heard brother Luke breaks like that he he's he was sweating when he was talking so okay but uh I told him I said you get about 10 years older you'll slow that stuff down yeah you'll pace yourself so let's go let's go to John 1 1. I know this is part 125 but I'm just a little bit slow but we're going to get up his statue of perfect man and we're going to have a as brother Ryan says a living breathing instrumentality not of the world but of God all right so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day thank you for this time you give us thank you for the people that you've you've brought in Lord the ones that that you've assembled from all over the the world now with brother Josue with us Lord we appreciate him Lord we appreciate all the ones coming from different parts and and making an effort Lord that effort will not be forgotten sister free to Lord getting up and coming putting herself together and walking in this door Lord give her an absolute supercharge today father I pray this should just bless us now in the further than this service May the as the word Goes Forth that it heals each and every one of us even spiritually and emotionally and physically that we get a healing today Lord and not leave this building as we came in father just bless us now be with Dad and Mom different ones is home Lord that you touch his body be your brother Colleen Lord he's got a little stomach issue going I pray now in the name of the Lord Jesus that you take that away from him and anyone else that has anything bothering him today Lord I pray that as the word Goes Forth that you'll wash just just take care of us all Lord in Jesus name we pray amen sorry to keep you standing in the beginning was the what word the word was with and the word and the Word was made flesh that's the key the word was made flesh and I want to say in you and in me as we were singing that song about in the tents and then the Tabernacle that was a physical thing that was in the new Old Testament but now you're standing in the Tabernacle that God wants to dwell in you're standing in the tent that God wants to dwell in amen he don't worry about cloth and wood and stone and all that but what he wants to take your flesh and use you for his honor and glory and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory the only begotten of the father four somebody say four four of Grace and Truth amen you can be seated in the Lord has blessings for the reading of the word we're going to continue on today it's something I want to bring out that brother Keith struck uh last Sunday about a little a little Park that we've got to go through as we go up to Statue of perfect man listen it's not easy it's a battle like I said it's not a picnic would he bring Fortune spoons we brought swords all right so you come today you come battling to get here you'll battle your way back home now man you'll battle your way up tomorrow go to work because it's Monday morning and I pray like somebody said the other day I pray that the Rapture takes place on Monday morning so the devil will be stranded the whole day Monday and not have nothing else to do with the bride hey man think about that John 3 verse 3 says Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily now look listen listen verily verily I say underly accept the man be born again he cannot see or understand the kingdom of God nicodema said how can we be born and we're old and uh you know he's all carnal got all kind of carnal stuff going on Jesus said look man come on I'm going to say one more time barely verily except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh so we have as Paul said we have had our conversation in times past in the lust of the flesh but now we have another life the night the life I now live that's what we've been talking about but now we're going to go back down to the bottom as as we were talking about as brother Luke was talking about last night on the cornerstone in a headstone you got to start at the bottom you got to start at Faith you've got to start down at the bottom of the pyramid you got to start at the new birth not just an emotion not just something you you like this message and and you want to listen because you you know more than your neighbor that's why sometimes this message has become as all the years I've been listening and watching people it's more like well I got something you ain't got you got to come to me to get it no you got to go to Jesus and get it you got to go to Christ and get it and when you get to Christ and you do get it he'll bring you to the message he'll have to because the message is a word of God Amen but it's got to be flesh first Paul said to let her killeth in other words all my quotes all my sermons that are written down are going to kill you all them 1100 sermons and William Branham is going to kill us if we don't take that off the page and put it in here and what make it live look he says Marvel not that I say you must be born again First Peter 1 verse 22 says seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren now this is after you're born again this Peter's already Born Again Peter's fixing to tell us how that God's going to mold us into His Image all right we come into the family of God listen we've gotten the right place we've gotten the right building we've got in the right atmosphere all right and now he wants us to be born again now that we're born again he does not want us if you take those twins back there where'd they go I'm going to use it for an example but anyway so you got those two babies back there two twin beautiful little boys beautiful they're humans they're born but if you take them two and you go put them in that study right there pretty steady brother Dale's had many good sermons come out of that study and and we've had many good ministers in there so maybe the power of God's in that study but you lay them two babies in that study and come back three months later well I ain't gonna tell you what's going to happen to them they got to be fed yes that's probably what they're doing now they're feeding them bathing them changing them and that's what God does with me and you but then he says hey let's don't be a 40 year old baby let's don't be a 20 year old baby grow up I have fed you I have clothed you I know this is y'all talking to your kids it's me talking to mine too grow up good job get out of my house seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit under unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another what with a pure heart what fervently passionately listen we have people that are passionate about everything look go on YouTube you go on YouTube and you look people are passionate about this they're passionate about this they're obsessed with this well I want to be I don't want to be obsessed with God I won't be possessed of God all right listen you're going to be possessed of something one of the two let's just make sure we're possessed by the right spirit today if you're not then we can do something about that Paul Peter says being born again be ing being over and over it's not the new birth you've got to have every time but you got to have a refilling every once in a while of the holy spirit all right being born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth in the Bible forever for All Flesh is grass and the glory of man is the flower of grass the grass withers and the flower followeth away now look all that's human all that's Humanity all that's me and you getting older right but the word of God but the word of God endureth forever so if you get into that you will endure forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you and and as brother Luke we were talking about yesterday this church has been preached a progressive church it's where we progress we're progressive revelation we we come to a place to where we know that we need more from God not just that God sent us a prophet we don't those days are gone they used to be that day that day back in the 60s when brother Homer and different ones were preaching the word of God God sent a prophet we had to believe that they guide us to Christ but then they introduced The Prophet to us which I I was we were talking about last night and I believe as brother Luke was saying see the people that are leaving the message they're saying well well brother I'm just copied uh Clarence Larkin brother Brown just cop and Nick Clarence Larkin preached a wild horse rider was the Antichrist before brother Brown came on the scene but listen he was a trinitarian so he didn't have all the pieces listen I don't care where brother I my whole sermon come from the prophet's message and the Bible so what's wrong with that that's where you're supposed to get it from but listen Clarence Larkin didn't have a message Clarence Larkin did not have a Vindicated Malachi 4 message all of them were great men lit Dwight Moody different ones gonna be Brown we gotta understand one thing we say we've got this great message and we do but you're going to be a small microcosm of the Bride maybe just a few thousand or maybe even a few hundred thousand everybody else is under Luther Wesley Pentecost the bride for their day that's why they're gonna come to you and say hey man how'd you make it we heard y'all had the worst time we saw well God sent us a prophet to clarify not change to clarify the gospel so that we know what it says and we don't have to worry about like we're going to say here before right in a minute brother Brown says Jesus's first Doctrine watch his first Doctrine was you must not you need to be or you might want to be you must be born again so if Jesus preached his first Doctrine then let that be our first Doctrine you must start somewhere you must be born again now watch till we find out there's so many different meanings that people put to that you must be born again all right some people say You must be in this message no you that ain't true don't get quiet on me that ain't true you must be born again of the holy spirit of God not the spirit of a man that lives down here we find out there's so many different meanings that people put to it the Badness says just come and shake my hand all right uh what do they call it let me make a decision you better make more than one because I've seen many a funeral of a man you never saw in church in the Baptist Church you never saw him live just a hound dog life and they put him in heaven because he he shook a preacher's hand when he was 10 years old no that ain't it people ain't it but that's their part of the being born again amen Luther is justification Wesley preached sanctification but that would even get you and I saved in this day head bye with me nearly all churches say that she must be born again that is a central theme because they can't do away with books John because that's real close to John 3 16. because when Jesus gets finished with that dissertation with Nicodemus what did he say for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son whosoever believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life that's for everybody that's the Joel 2 he pours out his Spirit upon All Flesh you can receive the Holy Ghost anytime you want to you don't have to be in a church but it's real good place to be I promise you you will be afterwards you might get born again out under a tree somewhere I believe I got born again I was sitting in a motorhome in Kentucky okay but you know what I'm not still sitting in that motorhome in Kentucky I spend 20 something years ago all right as brother Luke says and I say and I've many brother Donnie Reagan was preaching on the other night we we spend a lot of time telling people things that if they're born again they should already be doing so why not go back like we're doing and preach people to the new birth and you'll never have to preach about people coming to church a holy ghost person will come to church regardless all right I said regardless amen well praise the Lord the truth anyhow we're getting born again first let's go and get them into church let's get them born again then they'll want to go to church all right that want to will be in there as I said before you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and it'll transform your life but that won't do away with your problems don't think there's Prosperity Gospel they're preaching out here in the world that you go you know you you get born again under their idea and God's just gonna rain on your uh you know your bills are going to quit coming you'll get you don't have to put that four dollar gas in your car no more just automatically it stays full all the time no you're gonna have problems you're going to have issues but you're gonna know how to get through them you will not know how to get to them without the new birth that's why did you read in the paper the other day suicide in the United States is almost double 50 000 people in this country alone 50 000 that's more than the county you're sitting in Hall County is a big County there's about 60 something thousand people in this County 50 000 people committed suicide last year up some 30 something percent and you know what the whole dissertation was they don't know why I can tell you why ain't got God they don't have a spiritual Rudder they don't have something to turn their boat everybody with me there's different interpretations of what it means to be born again might go to the Methodist Church and say we believe you must be born again how do you interpret that I go to the Baptist Church we believe you must be born again how do you interpret that I go to each church and we'd find if we went to all 900 then was 900 you know there's 13 000 different denominations now in the world that was 969 when brother Bradham was alive in 1965. so you see that didn't stop any denominations that just that the devil just went after him and just had many many more there'd be 900 different interpretations so seeing that there's so many different interpretations and yet a Bible Doctrine so there must be and there's a truth somewhere yes it is so now remember it didn't say you ought to be born again but you must be born again and then he talks about what we're saying in English and look Santa two you're born again and so many different interpretations of the word born again we ought to seek it out with all our heart to find what it means and we've been a hundred and something sermons trying to get us to see if you'll go back to number one to about 30. we talked about you must be born again but we kind of backed up for the new ones that's coming we know one thing's for sure that's not your new birth that's your new birth you're born again at Faith we'll talk about this one there'll be an anointing right here that's going to strike us the church everybody but that you got to get born again first you got to get in the family before you can be adopted you got to be in a family before you get any promises we'll talk about that in a second no matter how much you try to think you're right saying a Creed joining the church this is my idea you're still what you were until you're actually born again of the spirit of God it doesn't change you these people are living living the message they never were born again they just come in Under the Umbrella of the anointing that this message will give you and you get among people and you love people but you don't love them with this you're loving them with intellect if you love them with a pure what heart fervently knock this thing right here but the heart of you the very soul of you it doesn't change you your Creed joining Church changing your ideas are your good intentions what's the road to Hell paid with good intentions all right although as good as it might seem it's still not right there's something got to happen the new birth is an ex let me say it like bro Keith reasons unexperience he's from Jamaica he was here last week so it's an experience he adds that little Eerie it's on something that takes place yes yes I promise you every one of your sisters sitting in this building that had kids you knew when you had that child okay that's an experience that's a birth so that's an experience same way if you're a Christian today you can you can pretty much put your finger on the day that you got born again well if you get quiet on me that means you need to get born again what brother Dale always tell us all those years he harped on us and harped on us he said I had drether seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of my life and get to the end of the road and know that God said well you got it back Yonder than to not and sit in a church and die and say I'm in the message I don't cut my hair I don't I do I don't I do I don't I do I don't want to do you're going to hell if that's all you got it that's all you got I'm sorry now to begin with to base back the reason we have to be born again is because the Bible teaches us that we're all born in sin all shaped in iniquity and come to this world speaking lies and then that shows us that our nature to begin with is sinful okay now listen we know that that we hear preachers and we preach ourselves too that you have representation there's a seed there's a theophany there's a part of God there's a a peace of God that that you get but you get it at the new birth not at your first birth if you got it at your first birth you wouldn't need a new birth pretty simple then that shows us that our nature to begin with is sinful to start with we're no good to begin with so we cannot claim anything by our shrewdness I can now argue this person knocking out argue my neighbor no you ought to just love your neighbor and let your neighbor ask what you do like ours did and for those of you that don't know what my our neighbors are gay two boys two men well they're older men the older than I am one of them but anyway they come and asking hey what do you believe well people in the community never asked us that they just assume that we follow man he's God he's this he's that we do this we do that at least they asked how great we are how little we are or whatever more we are all together wrong to begin with so let's just all strip it down to the bottom strip it down to the wood all right and there's nothing that we can do about it except be born again Joel 2 28 says I pour out my spirit upon All Flesh let's hurry through this I want to get to a point Hebrews 9 6 now when these things where thus ordained the priest went always into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God he's talking about the Old Testament this is before the New Birth come and entered into a person because remember in the Old Testament the blood of bulls and goats could not take away your sin It could only cover your sin until Christ come and died to give us eternal life is everybody with me all right so no new birth in the Old Testament because right here it'll explain to you the Bible will but into the second went to high priest once a year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people now this is Bible the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all remember he took the blood went in for everybody the whole congregation now you got to go you can't depend on the preacher to go for you that's a way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing and that's the Tabernacle the physical Tabernacle in the wilderness Jesus tried to get him to see that he was the tabernacle they tried to guess he to tell him that he was the one he was the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world but they just wouldn't listen they always fell back to the old Tabernacle but Christ being coming high priest of good things to come by greater and more perfect Tabernacle what is it it was his flesh not made with hands there's a saint not of this building neither by the blood of goats and cows but by his own blood watch he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for itself well be careful amen that's no way it says he didn't need it we need it he did it for us he did it for me and you so Moses had power and anointing without character what brother Ram tell us power without character was satanic all right David Sampson Abraham Jacob Noah Saul Elisha they all had flaws they all had a they didn't have a spiritual Rudder inside to keep David from killing his best friend and committing adultery amen but he was the man after God's Own Heart because God knew his heart Hebrews 11 verse 39 said these all brother Luke and brother Bob's been on with the book of Hebrews y'all you should comb it pretty good brother Baldwin on it brother Luke's been on it we've been reading so the book of Hebrews is a it's a good book and I hope y'all understand stood yesterday what he was talking about the book of Hebrews some maybe that didn't that's why that Jim says who makes the best coffee and he said Wade does because Hebrews the coffee that's what brother Luke was talking about last night so I was going to clarify that today that Hebrews uh anyway those of you that don't drink coffee you can fall asleep Hebrews 11 if you drink coffee you wouldn't Hebrews 11 39. and these all having obtained I love it when I love it when people are are being are interpreting like the brother back there all of y'all laughed about three seconds later he left because Louise had to interpret it and send it to him in his earbuds and he laughed after y'all did so you have to kind of wait you get a delayed reaction when you're when people are interpreting so and these all having obtained a good report I'm just glad brother Branham was not from another country I'm sorry I'm just glad he was a good old Kentucky Angus guy and I learned you know that good English and I speak it like he does but look all these great ones all these great warriors all these great people of Faith the Great Hall of faith is standing there Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph all the different ones in the Old Testament they did not receive the promise of Genesis 3 15 that I'll put enmity in other words I'm going to come as God but I'm going to come as human and I'm going to die and I'm going to redeem this thing back he couldn't do it in the Old Testament he had to come with himself in flesh and die physically for me and you because remember Hebrews 11 says all these having obtained a good report and I love what Paul says he gets finished with all this and any interplays because he puts it in parentheses he tells all about all these Barack and all these different ones he said whom the world is not even Worthy the world at to them the world wasn't worthy for them to walk into what Paul said but they didn't receive the promise the promise was the baptism the Holy Ghost Acts 2 38. God having provided some better thing for us not be made perfect so listen to make them perfect we've got to become perfect first I didn't get many amends out of that well no you can't because you just said you couldn't what is your confession be therefore perfect complete as your father in Heaven is complete and perfect we're never going to be perfect in our flesh but if we have a perfect word with a perfect god with a perfect message with a perfect fivefold ministry I'm not talking about Humanity I'm talking about the gift Acts 2 38 says Peter said unto them repent any of you that like to be baptized repent first and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the what gift of the Holy Ghost what a promise for the promise what that promise they missed in the Old Testament you're you're privileged to that promise for the promises unto you to your children to all them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call so that covers all of us all right so there's the promise now watch this brother I'm saying in Blasphemous names paragraph 91 said the reason that there's so much confusion today this was 1962. he ain't got much better about the holy spirit it's not correctly taught I believe that the baptism is taught and he says they're just saying the baptism you know we'll just throw it out there but then you like you say automobile well there's many of them there's Chevrolet Ford Dodge GMC products and and all those others but it's an automobile but it's many different ones but there's got to be one vehicle that we get in and that's called the new birth and it's only come one way that's by you dying there's got to be a death for you to live got several mechanics in the church we do too I don't know one thing about it neither do I so if I make a mistake brother I'm gonna call you I'm not a mechanic there has to be calls plugs points vowels and everything else listen he can quote that but where do they go right Donnie would know where they went I don't know a thing about electricity except one thing call an electrician it scares me to death my dad in different ones electricians they'll just put them Planes together and they'll and you'll see a little spark or they'll go ouch uh no not this boy broccoli daddy used to he used to test nine volt batteries with his tongue to see if they were everybody with me you know what a nine volt battery it's got two it's got two little things well he would stick that to his tongue to see if they were I said pop let's get a battery checker well that's okay that was his way of doing things that's the way it was he'd stick his tongue to that thing and he'd go oh this was good or no this one's dead and when you when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with that see there's a lot goes with that and here is what I think that God is proving is that the holy spirit is here and I contend the same thing now Peter said first Faith now he keeps going on that faith is the foundation faith is your new birth everybody with me now then that then from this and then bringing this into the seven Church ages God is building and seven churches abide for Christ and you know what we are we're the last one we're in the last Church age the last body the last bride the last people on the face of the Earth that's going to get the new birth now listen to me the new birth because 144 000 they don't get the new birth as we do to be bride they do get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul their own birth but it's because they are servants not bride all right and they get it after we're gone there is going to be a door of the Gentiles close folks come on I don't want to scare you to death but the thing is creaking shot now look the only way you can be a son or daughter of God is because you have to have eternal life not because you can quote unquote have your favorite preacher or go to your favorite Church and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's own life only one form of eternal life that was good there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always in other words back before eternity brother Brown said back in the Eternal before God was God what was God's first creation God what the prophet said figure that one out only one form of eternal life that was God to be a Son of God you had to be in him always remember if if you go through trials in your life and you don't ever say God don't love me because God can't change his mind if he ever loved you from the beginning of time even way past the beginning of time if he ever loved you then he can't I love you now you cannot love him but he can never change his mind about you so if you were in the mind of God if you're sitting here today with some kind of Sanity in your brain that says I'm either lost or found we have a lost and found departments called The Church you'll get that in a minute too there to be born the Son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your life now look not the gene of this life ever the gene of your life comma spiritual life tonight or today was in God because remember see God can't change he can't he can't say oh oh sh oh brother George I messed up I give him the new birth and and he's got problems no that's not God God knew he'd have problems but he knew he wanted the new birth that's the way I see God he's not worried about your problems you say well I've always heard preacher say his word yeah he's worried about your soul you're gonna have human problems till your day you die or we leave this place because we're Humanity but he's interested in your soul brother Dale for all these 52 years he's been preaching in his church he wants your soul he don't care about your body he's preaching to your soul how many times he told you that that's what I'm trying to do preach to your soul I'm not preaching whether you like me or don't like marriage 12 o'clock we're only got one service so don't be scared if we go past 12 it'll be okay the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule praise God now I believe in internal security that way not the way the Baptist did shake a hand and then go don't go back to church for another 20 something years but they'll put you in the as brother Dale says they'll put you in the in heaven for Paving the parking lot or give them some money for an offering or you know no you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God now you're expressed after his word has come in you so now listen if you're going to express his word that means you got to do what he says you gotta do what the word says you can't just be your own Rogue you know I'm gonna just go out here and be a rogue person you know just no you're still a lamb you're a herd animal and guess what happens when you're in a herd what happens when one goes away the wolf will get that one but you stay together you stay tight-knit if you'll watch I watch the documentary one time about a uh these muskox that live in like Sub-Zero weather and they have their little kids and they birth them one time a year I guess when it's warmer which is like 40 below zero and then here comes a polar bear I mean this polar bear is huge and this little bitty he gets kind of off away from the herd and Buddy here goes the polar bear but he forgot that Mama and Daddy and a couple other mothers were standing right over over here behind some behind like some snow or something yeah polar bear figured out real quick he better run why because everybody went after that person that's what I say about it we need to go after people brother Donnie was praying about people you start praying about people that are not here anymore we all got them I want him back in the herd amen and those mothers are them big Ox they put that baby in the middle and they formed a tight Circle there's no way that polar bear is going to get to it there's no way the devil is going to get to you if you'll do what I tell you to do what the Bible tells you to do stay in church read your Bible Fellowship amen that's the only way you're gonna make it you cannot make it by yourself I didn't say that God did and but now the devil would tell you different oh yeah go you're fine they don't like you at that church they don't like you but don't you I wouldn't even go back if the devil was opening his mouth and talking he's lying okay if his lips are moving he's lying all right we need each other that's why brotherly kindness is way up here and we've been talking about brotherly kindness and that's loving your brother as you love yourself loving your neighbor the two gay guys that live beside me I have to and I know I do I have to love them the same as I love me to be brotherly kindness because listen G esus Christ loves you when you were unlovable gay straight doesn't matter that's just a title that the devil has given us but we can all be saved if you'll just give your heart to God and there's a way to do it there's a way to do it there's a required way of doing it and that's getting in the Bible get into the promises of God and just say hey I don't know I don't know why I'm here but I'm here you'll find out later therefore you get what I mean you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty watch is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are God knew that you would be here yes because you have to be one of his genes or attributes now listen I act like my dad and mom because that's my genetics physically but we ought to act like our father Heavenly if we have his genetics if you ever if you've got eternal life tonight in other words if you've got it now then it always was eternal life it never was a lower form and then became an upper for no you were just lost and what you were pulled away from it by Satan God's pulling you back thank God it always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation World knew that you'd be here what for knowledge he knew you'd be here he knew when he said let there be everybody that's sitting here today and what you're all thinking and when the word or the water the washing the water of the word fell upon you it was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your Earthly father see you are citizens of the king not citizens but you are children Sons and Daughters of the Living God if it be that eternal life dwells in you that's the most important thing is to know that you're born again or listen it's most important to know you're not because you can do something about it if you want to let's look in a book of Ezekiel just for a minute the Bible tells us Ezekiel says a new heart well I give you now listen God is a God is a master surgeon he can change you and never leave a scar he can take things out and put things in never leave a scar pray to God so he's going to give us a new heart will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart what can you do with a Stony heart you can't even live with one out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh in other words something that's what pliable something God can use and look and I will put my spirit now that's what I want now he's going to give you a new spirit we're going to explain it just for a little bit for some of the newer ones and I will put my spirit now who is my God that's God Almighty that's eternal life God there's not a part of God that's not Eternal that's right that's right everything he is is eternity all right and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them come Church read the Bible pay tithe all that stuff that's easy to do get a spattering of amens if you're amazed but we got to start somewhere so let's start just for a few minutes with justification Romans 5 verse 1 says therefore being justified by what faith help her get in that door bless her heart don't hit that baby them babies are gone hey I can put some sleep at any age doesn't matter little medium older gone to the letter nod when you're good you're good therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ look by whom also we have access all right he takes out your Stony heart puts in a heart of flex he has access to be able to deal with you we were undealable if that's a word did you oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm preaching to Perfect People I keep we were lost I'm sorry I had a conversation one time in times past in what lust and flesh all of us did you say I never did this I never did that Pharisee and what did Jesus say to the Pharisee you of your okay anyway that's okay don't say that therefore be justified by faith the whole thing you say well what's Faith got to do with it you got to believe that God can do it you got to believe that God can justify you you got to believe that God can wipe your sins out and never remember him again put a no fishing sign what's our problem I did this I did that and God's going no you didn't no you didn't but do you really believe that because you and I as human beings we can't do that I wish we had a sea of God's forgetfulness there's one up there what praise the Lord anyway some of the young kids are going what's he talking about if I remember your name I tell you thank God he can't remember but listen you got to believe that he can do that you got to believe that he is a justifier and he's so much a justifier he can make you just even in your lowest estate even in justification just when you say God forgive me of my sins I am so sorry for what I did he's just that he knows your heart and if you really want to get rid of that thing he'll forgive you and listen he'll never remember it again but the problem we have is we we need to move further because the same person that made you do all that drinking smoking cussing gambling not coming to church whatever well had I call it a laundry list we all got one just a little different than others mine might be socks and yours might be shirts but we still had one but that person's still in there making you do that now see God took the Stony heart out and he's put a heart in that he can work with if you let him because what will happen with us is we'll we'll be satisfied say oh I have this great feeling I feel good it must be the Lord be careful be careful the devil can make you feel good all right is everybody okay I know it's a simple but we're going to preach till three or four o'clock we all be used to staying here to four anyway so we just got four hours left this is the four hour battery I just put it in here scared people to death when you do that you'll be with me won't you bro Michael hey I knew he would yeah he sits up front where he can get it fresh that's right but we got to believe that God can do these things we really in our Humanity can't fathom somebody not remembering what we did because you remember it I drive by places hey I still live here I drive by places that I did certain things that I know I did them yeah hold on man the person I did it with knew I did it or the group are the one I love my wife she's so patient with me thank you so much I appreciate that but we drive by those places and Kendrick your mama thank the Lord for Grace but you go and you do you remember things you did you remember the places you went to and you know what you drive by them and you remember them the person you didn't remember you never sent a loan the person that you did it with and the devil still remembers it but God's going what sin are you talking about amen I don't ever remember you even going to that place somebody I don't [Applause] even say God we serve he can wipe your sleigh clean you can't do it the devil can't do it your mom and daddy can't do it but God can do it cause he's just yeah he's a justifier the Bible tells us to just shall live by faith I have to believe that the things I did sure I don't do any more but God doesn't remember them he will not hold it against you ever again but if you don't continue moving on we go to the Book of Luke where it tells us that the unclean Spirit goes out all right now the one that made you do all these things it's leaving you because you know what it don't like you coming to church they don't like you you know there's a lot of places we don't like to be right well that the devil don't want to be around it gets kind of hot when God God when God shows up it gets a little hot I mean everybody thinks Satan is hot no he's going to a hot place right yeah he's going to a hot place there's nothing hard about him he's going to a hot place all right but he feels that fire god moving closer to you because remember you were alienated from God you were a cold stonehearted I don't care if you were a kind person you were cold and stonehearted before you were born again that's what the Bible says you have a Stony heart so God's going to take that Stony heart and give you a heart of Flesh where you can work on it all right man you need to go to church but you remember you're still a free moral Asia you can accept or reject even sitting here today you can accept him reject but when you get into the first part of your of your Christian Journey it's much more well I'm going to say that it is important that you listen to God that you listen to a preacher that you listen to The Prophet's message that you read your Bible and pray listen that section of your life you did something before me play ball go hunting fishing blah blah right some went to bars some spit I know I got friends of mine they're not friends now because they left me but they'll go sit in the bar for three hours after work I like to think that I use my time a lot better than being in a bar I get some spirit all right but it's not in a bar you see how it changes your attitude but remember if you stay there remember that unclean spirit's going to come back and it's going to make you worse that's why you need to get the Holy Ghost and know that you got it know that you've had that old thing burned out and killed it not put it in the closet and get it out when you need it that's a problem with people leaving this message they just put God they just put that old them in the closet come on somebody you can't turn this word down by standing here for all the time we've stood here and turn it down after 40 years or 50 years you never had it to begin with John 3 16 said for God so love the whole world that he gave his only begotten son to whosoever believe D in him believeth ongoing should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world look but that the world through him might be saved the world yes if they'll accept him but they won't all accept him he didn't believeth on him is not condemned Justified but he didn't believeth not is condemned already that's right because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God who is what Jesus Christ that's why the Bible tells you to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin I know what Matthew 28 19 says and I know that was Jesus talking but you know what he was telling exactly what Peter's telling around here repent Jesus said be baptized in the name father is not her name son is not her name Holy Ghost is not her name it's a title to a name I'm a father I'm a son I'm a human postal worker preacher but my name is Samuel waydale II that's how I signed my checks we really don't sign checks much anymore but that's the way you sign your name on a legal document you wouldn't write father so you're identified by a name I want to be identified that name the name of the only begotten Son of God who is what Jesus Christ pretty simple but the world's confounded with it so sanctification the Bible says he'll give you a new heart now remember and put a new spirit in you not not the Holy Spirit according to the prophet amen and according to my life he's not going to put the Holy Spirit In My Soul until I'm born again and then take it out he will not he's not an Indian giver once he puts that thing in there and seals it when God seals it nobody opens it folks the devil can't even get in there as powerful as we try to think he is sanctification first Thessalonians 4 says for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel and sanctification and honor what are you saying brother Wade when you come to justification in your walk with God and you give your heart to God you stand right here You Weep you away as they say to the altar which I did standing right here give my heart to the Lord but the devil's like thank you come on come on don't you remember I said yeah I remember but God don't and I said the things I used to do I do them no more you know what though that desire was still there I used to chew chew tobacco dip stuff whatever you want to say in general genitalia I don't know how she kissed me all those years I had it in my mouth for so long but today God saved my soul he Sanctified me from that and never again have I even wanted to look at it do you say well no hold on hold on no no no no clap well that's just a sign you got born again no that's a sign that that unclean Spirit left me if I don't let it it'll come back cause oh listen I'd be lying to tell you that they wasn't some temptation was there but I said nope because I knew that as you've heard my testimony some of you have not that when I came out of the water when I was re-baptized and I came out of the water it felt like I was still in the water it was raining and it was it was flushing and when I grabbed June and we were just crying like babies together there on the riverbank I swear I know I'm a young sister swear but I'm telling you I felt empty like they was absolutely a a drum and at that time it was probably pretty bigger the nest a 55 gallon drum but it was empty you said oh God wasn't there you got to remember sanctification the unclean Spirit goes out God's working on you he's working behind the scenes but you know what he's doing he's seeing what you'll do is this all right maybe that's not what I had in my sermon but we're good but he's still behind the scene he's the clean spirit that wants to get into inside of your house but he's gonna wait right here just to see if you'll invite this guy back in what does the Bible say if you don't in other words I'm gonna tell you in my language if you don't get it sealed by the Holy Ghost he goes and taketh seven other spirits worse than he was right he comes back into your house no I'm sorry he didn't say that he says his house then he saith he who's he the devil the devil says I will return into my house from whence I came out and when he has come he finds it empty swept and garnished that's okay that's good but don't stay there because if you stay there he's going to go and take seven more and you know what they're going to be they're not going to be you're not going to be a seven times more Drinker cusser he's going to bring religious guys with him he's gonna bring his religious demons and say hey this guy thinks he's got it y'all come on let him sit here for a while let him sit somewhere for a while then all of a sudden what's going to happen they'll lead you back out because remember the devil's Devil's guide you in all truth who does the comforter the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide you into all truth the devil will not then go with him taking themselves seven more Spirits more wicked than he is they enter in look and dwell there well they just sit down and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation Jesus is telling us John 17 he says sanctify them he is he is actually he is actually telling he's telling the father sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth how you going to get Sanctified by the truth as thou has sent me into the world even so I have sent them into the oh Lord you you should have said I'll take them out I'll put them in this little bubble and and nothing's going to happen and it's all going to be inside we're going to be so happy and that's not what he's saying he said have you as you have sent me into the world even so I'm sending them into the world and for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth hmm now let me read this right here real quick everybody with me we all right this is what the Bible says First Corinthians 6 verse 9. this is Paul preaching to the Saints and Lula know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators idolaters adulterers a feminate abusers of himself of mankind thieves continue Paul preach Covetous drunkards revilers extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God you can all go home you're going to hell that's not what Paul said Paul was bringing their mind and he was telling them look all of you were this and they were all going like this I was one of those I may have been two or three of those okay if you weren't then pray for us that were Paul says and such were some of you so that's for some of you but ye are washed I like my brother Louise is preaching but God but God who is rich in Mercy but who now don't remember that list of people but now you are washed you are Sanctified but you're justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our god look what he'll do for you if you'll just let him First Corinthians 15 verse 30. now listen we can't get bored again like we said we can't take the twins back there it's beautiful and nice and pretty as they are we can't take them and just take them home Michaela takes them home she puts them in the closet these are so pretty I don't want them to change I want them to stay the same I'm not going to feed him anymore because they'll grow they'll die they'll die that's the same one with your Christianity you'll die but now watch what Paul says hold on and why stand you in Jeopardy every hour in other words why are you fussing about your problems your issues I protest by your rejoicing look though which I have in Christ oh Christ Jesus I Die daily because remember there's a spirit realm that the devil can still play in and he'll keep popping up every once in a while and you got to kill that thing off not with spoons and forks with a sword I protest by your rejoice in which I have in Christ Jesus our lord I die daily all right goodbye with me so now we're at the birth which Jesus says I mean the Bible says I will put my spirit within you I want that my yes I want the spirit of God inside of me not on me because remember you can be anointed by the Holy Ghost every day of your life and die and go to hell that's what the prophet said everybody believe brother Byron was a prophet I know I want to make sure I'm still in the right place and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them Matthew 3 verse 11 says I indeed baptize you with water he's talking about John but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire yes John 14 verse 26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send what in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you how many times you've been thinking on something else or be out doing some work or something and something brother Dale said a year ago I'll pop up in your head well you didn't need it before now you need it now all right because it's like I always said before out of this sermon you're only going to get about 15 minutes of content you just better hope it's yours you didn't get your neighbors Luke 24 verse 39 49 says behold I send the promise of the father upon you but carry in the city of Jerusalem I want to get to this right here until you be endued now we'll look at that word in dude that that word in dude means look in the sense of sinking into a garment Jesus is telling the disciples and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high now we know we've been to brother Louise has been preached as priests aren't myself about um uh um two different kinds of Power there's dunamis where we get our word Dynamite which is right down here dunamis and there's another one called extra seal or exclusive we'll talk about just that because there's two different powers but it all comes from the Holy Ghost so we talk about here where we see Jesus said you're being dude you'll be put on or clothed with a raid in be clothed to sink into listen on the day of Pentecost God just didn't anoint them with a little bitty flame over the top of their head that flame disappeared he didn't go back to Heaven either it went down in their souls it burned them out till you be sunk in with dunamis now look watch this this is the difference in the two Powers because we're going to see another um place where that word's used inherent power power residing In A Thing by virtue of its nature or which a person or thing exerts or puts forth all right that's that's dunamis so remember it's moral power and Excellence of Soul so what what is what is dunamis dunamis when they were endued with power from on high they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost right all right everybody stay with me just for a minute don't don't go to nod Matthew 10 verse 1 is another situation though watch this and when he had called upon him his 12 disciples he gave them power now that's different from dunamis because dunamis power goes inside of you anybody with me exosia power is something that God hands to him and says here you can use this and then it'll be taken away from you are an anointing all right he gave them power because remember in Matthew 10 they didn't have the Holy Ghost they had not been to the upper room okay but he gave them power against unclean spirits cast them out heal the manner of sickness and all manner of disease now that's exosiah which is Authority jurisdiction gives you libertarian straight Power of Choice look Power of Choice the power of authority God was giving them Authority as he gives us Authority by anointings as we pray before the service starts we pray that brother Joel they'll be an anointing on Brother Joseph to to for worship brother boy different one for worship I know they're not going to preach but the person is going to preach I pray that God gives them an anointing looking on in the priest brother around him many times he's standing here and say now he said I've been preaching he said now I'm waiting on him now what was he waiting on he had the Holy Ghost he had the anointing to preach the word of God he was waiting on another anointing not another person he was waiting on another anointing he said I'm waiting on him what someone something to come here to tell the people the thoughts and intents of the heart all right acts 1 verse 4 it's being assembled together with him commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which you said you've heard of me we just read it for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence then we continue on but you shall receive power look Paul said power after listen you're powerless without God Amen you may think you got all kind of lists and all kind of you know muscles and all uh you shall receive power dunamis after the Holy Ghost has come upon you praise God I'm saved and say that you 'll be Witnesses what is a witness it's something you see it's something you were involved in you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem Judea Samaria and Lula Georgia the uttermost parts of the Earth Acts 2 verse 4 and they were all white what not anointed anoint the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues of the spirit gave them utterance Acts 19 verse 1. it came to pass it while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed through the upper Coast came to Ephesus in finding certain disciples hey certain message believers and he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and they said unto him well it's two Souls it's this I've already got that all you got to do is believe brother Brown was a prophet all you gotta do is do this all you gotta do this do this do this or this he said if you receive the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said we don't even know what you're talking about they weren't taught we have not so much as heard about this Holy Ghost they were preaching what John preached John's good John's baptism was okay but Paul says it ain't gonna do you any good now because you got to further Revelation coming then Paul said John barely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus when they heard this there was no disputation there was no Deacon meeting there was no Minister's meeting am I making myself clear when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul laid hands on them the Holy Ghost came on him and they spoke with tongues and prophesied Romans 5 verse 5 says hope maketh not a shame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us Ephesians 4 verse 29 says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearer you hear me Grace not condemnation Grace and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption let all bitterness wrath anger clamor evil speaking evil speaking all this virtues be put away from you with all malice and be your kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another I fell forgive me first that's not what the Bible says do unto others and run that's not what the Bible says forgiving one another Christ's sake forgive forgive me now listen this brother around lays it right here in order just stay with me just a minute we believe in justification by faith Romans 5 1. we believe that after a person being justified by faith he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ but it's possible that this same person could have habits such as drinking smoking doing things that he should not do filthy habits of the flesh doesn't get away don't do away with it just chopped off your past sin right then if you'll hang around long enough then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the Lord not put in service but for service we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13 12 and 13 where Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate and we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament remember it wasn't taught in the Old Testament because you couldn't come perfect right right only in the New Testament look and meant for the Believers through the New Testament age which is now which we're now living and we also believe that after that person has been Sanctified unclean habits has gone from that person you say well like I said before I know I got the Holy Ghost because I quit drinking no you just got sanctified the Holy Ghost will put you in service the Holy Ghost will put you read in your Bible it'll put you in church it'll put you doing the things of God he's a Believer on the Lord Jesus and his habits are gone this is sanctification we believe that then he is a candidate thank God for a teacher we believe that he is a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Spirit which comes as a filling of the believer and then when the Believers just as many times as I've taught it like picking up a glass in a chicken yard justification is picking it up ready to use it with a purpose that's what God does to the center he's still filthy then he is cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ and the word sanctifies a compound word which means cleaned and set aside for service in the Old Testament the altar Sanctified The Vessel and it was set aside for service we believe that the holy spirit is putting that same vessel into service all right let's see what we got here we'll go through this look right here so the spirit can come out here and anoint you to do certain things all right and you do it but that don't mean you're saved think of it conference prophesied Judas cast out devils and I agree with brother Luke last night he was talking about there's all been spirits of different things going on the spirit of Judas because remember the juditarian spirit was right there with Jesus when he was getting ready to be crucified so we have a judo Spirit Among Us I don't say us but among the message and that's why the people are leaving they're selling us out and leaving they're selling the people that sat here for years and years not here but sat in their churches for 30 and 40 years and heard them preach a message and then now they're denying it see the spirit anointed him this rain falls on the just and the unjust the weeds can Rejoice just as much as the wheat but it's what it is at the core there's where you can intellectually can accept and say oh sure that's good I believe that I still don't do it no sir and the spirit can actually make witness of it and still It Isn't So because if that Soul hasn't come from God it can make all the impersonations out here but it cannot be real you can act healing you can act like you have you can act like you receive it Christians can act like they're Christians and act and be ever so good at it but that don't mean they're saved that's exactly right the spirit can be there the real genuine spirit the Holy Spirit can anoint you that still don't mean you're saved it's that inside soul that never dies it's got eternal life it always was eternal life it came from God it goes to God it's your soul everybody with me you talk about you say well prove that Matthew 7 verse 21. not everyone that says unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in your name in thy name we've cast out devils and in thy name we preach many good sermons many mighty words then I will profess unto them I never knew you and that word new is the same as if you as adults you understand what I'm talking about Adam knew his wife Eve God is telling us telling that person said look I never had an intimate relationship with you you never let me inside your heart wow see how this Holy Spirit can anoint a man but it's got to be in the order of the anointing the outside Spirit can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the Soul as dark as pitch false teachers can rise preaching all kind of preaching trinitarianism and everything else to be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can remember what brother Dale always tells us he said I don't care you bring a man in here and you put 10 dead bodies out here if he raises every one of them from the dead he said I still want to hear him preach and if he's off the word I don't care how many people did he rages from the dead look but by the word here that's what does it see what I mean naughty ones at the end time notice the anointing ones only the word will separate them so we've come down to today that only the truth of the Gospel is going to separate all right the word will separate them not the signs all right now listen Shake Yourself just for a minute oh no they'll do the same signs but it's the word that separates them sure they all prophesied they all done this that and the other sure just the same Jesus said they'd do the same thing but the word is what separates them not the signs we love science but remember science does what science follows the believer not stays in front signs follow the believer back here they follow if you if you stay in the true word of God long enough hey brother Brian said you get under the fountain if you want to speak in tongues God will let you speak in tongues but so will the devil you got to know which one now let's just talk about this just for a minute and then we'll close because we got to get to I like what brother Keith said Sunday about storms of maturity that's what you know you get your birth in your birth and I know the two twins they they struggled I'm sure Michaela did too but they struggled to get out and now we protect them we hold them as babies like God does at our new birth he holds us but now when they get about 15 Mama may want to hold them but if they big as Aaron just saying she's not gonna hold him relax she'll want to she loves them but she said good job get car get a life right so then they're storms of life starts your storms as a little child and even as a teenager and some of you growing up now into adulthood we're not preaching everything's gonna be roses it's a fight but it's worth it it's your Eternal destination so these storms of maturity James 1 verse 2 says my brother encountered all joy oh what I know people in this world tell them bro Luke last night I know people in this world I am acquainted with a few people in this world that if God changed their body back to an 18 year old kid they still complain people just gonna complain if you change their body nothing don't hit me like that he says count it all joy when you fall into diver's Temptations why knowing this now that you do know it that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let pay ERS have her perfect that you may be perfect in an entire wanting nothing these are not humanly possible without the new birth now yeah you can you can learn to have patience you can learn to have knowledge you can learn to have temperance you can do these self-help things I get myself out from right here that's my self-help book Amber one and you know what got to know the author pretty well so you know what he done he sent me somebody to give me the love story to tell me what he's saying in between these lines wow what a mighty God we serve we're sister Johnny when you need her I know she's watching but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect look entire wanting nothing all right let's look at this just for a second there's a metamorphosis that goes on from a caterpillar everybody knows what a caterpillar is right why does a caterpillar a caterpillar do when the caterpillar matures it does what it metamorphosis or it changes itself into a what some of y'all need to go to school I learned that in fourth grade gracious Kendrick didn't say nothing um but where was the butterfly where was the butterfly oh it just came from over here and it came it was inside of that ugly caterpillar the client and the caterpillar had to climb up a tree right turn brown and what die so that what was inside of it can come out a metamorphosis that that butterfly was always in there but he had to work and struggle work and struggle and then he had to Pop That Old Shell out and they become a beautiful butterfly that's us let's watch this just for a second the Lord tells us behold I come as a thief blessing is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see a shame and he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon everybody understands what Armageddon is if you didn't understand what brother Keith was saying last Sunday he was saying Armageddon he pronounced it a little bit different because he's from Jamaica and he's King's English but but he was talking about also deity he said deity but it's deity when we understand what if he got what he was preaching on you'd understand what he was saying but he gathered him to a place called Armageddon now what is Armageddon Armageddon is this is what we think Armageddon is that great battle way over here right if I read your Bible because I just read it there there is going to be a a culmination of forces but over here on the Earth nuclear explosion whatever you want to call it the only thing is keeping it away is us right now so what does Armageddon mean let's look at just for a second I want you to look natural and spiritual just for a second Armageddon means the hill the scene of the struggle of Good and Evil and it's suggested by the battle plane of estradon which was famous for two great battles Barack over the Canaanites and get in over a million nights for two great disasters the death of Saul and Josiah sorry Josiah we have a josison back there look hence in Revelation a place of great Slaughter the scene of a terrible ocean upon the wicked the RSV version translates the name as Armageddon or the hill the hill the battle of Armageddon Armageddon means the hill now listen watch this brother I'm in the fourth seal he says now the battle started in heaven we all know that Shake Yourself got five more minutes now the battle started in heaven it'll be finished on Earth now nuclear battle wasn't in heaven what was that battle it was a spiritual battle between Michael and Lucifer Michael being who not the one sitting back there with a beard I had to make that plane he probably is fighting Lucifer but so are we all amen he says but you got Michael you got Christ and Lucifer fighting a what a spiritual battle in heaven they're not up there punching each other good lord it's not what is it MMA or it wasn't MMA in heaven I'll promise you that that knows what I'm talking about nice tie who give you that oh thank you so anyway now the battle started in heaven I thought of you when I got them actually timu sent me three of them and I didn't need but one so the Bible started in heaven it'll be finished on Earth in the form of that battle I just showed you the Battle of Good and Evil all right now where is the Battle of Good and Evil right now you're looking at him I'm looking at it it's not out there it's not the prostitutes and how many Juke joints and how many drunks and not it's between you and the devil inside here and if we'll let God fight it it'll always win it'll be finished on Earth in the form of Armageddon now let's watch and see it unfold and maybe we can unfold it as the Lord help us right now to do this watch it's on the fourth seal which is the battle of Armageddon will not get into that too much now what's going to happen what's going to happen is the battle of Armageddon we're not going to be there physically all right look at me and we're talking physical you and I will not be at the battle of Armageddon all right we are fighting our Armageddon right now right now you're fighting the battle of Armageddon right now now listen if you're not fighting it inside of you you're going to see the other one I'm sorry people drown it in the flood but if you don't have if your battle is not one now you will see that other battle and you sure don't want to see that other battle and at that time Michael stand up shall stand up remember what he was preaching last night there's a time for you to sit down there's a time for you to stand up there's a time for you to run all right so Michael's gonna stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people this is what's going to actually happen I mean the battle of Armageddon is going to be two forces opposing forces trying to conquer each other to take over the world and where's it going to be in mcgetto nobody with me it'll be in Israel all right so we're setting the scene here that's where it's all going to culminate and the Bible says Michael will come down and fight for Israel and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered who's his people the Jews everyone that shall be found written in the book well that's me and you too because we're spiritual Israel all right you ready Victory Day brother Ram said we have had many great battles spiritual battles all right now listen when you got born again that spiritual battle is over but it puts you on a different field of those to battle it out until we come to because what's going to happen at our Armageddon Christ is coming what's going to happen to battle over there when the battle of Armageddon physically starts Christ is going to come and fight for him we have had many great battles spiritual battles many great V days that the church has had I mean the church the body of Christ I'm not talking about the organization now I appreciate what he separated there I'm talking about the body of Christ the body of Believers down Through the Ages it has many Victory days in other words we talk about we've had several Wars Wars rumors of wars v-days V days and B days all right and it will finally wind up in the great battle of Armageddon that'll be the last of it when she comes to the battle of Armageddon that'll settle the whole thing when you come to your battle of arm again and it's over that settles the whole thing you know why because you'll get a body change death will be destroyed there'll be no death this is not a fairy tale folks it's the plan of God that's going to happen you can decide whether you want to be on that team or the other team all right when she comes to the battle of Armageddon that'll settle the whole thing just before the great Millennium Armageddon is what to clean off the Earth everybody take your finger and do this everybody do this that are awake and do this right here that's what he's talking about he is not talking about the physical Earth he is but he's not to me and you that are still alive this is the earth I want cleaned off man's try listen man's tried to recycle man's tried to do everything in the world to get this Earth cleaned up never will because it ain't got it remember God will not even put his feet on this Earth until he gets into me and you and cleans us off first he cleans us all first oh he can't clean me off yes he can yes he can she she re-purifies herself with this Atomic blowing and volcanic ash and things sink that the stroke blood of men and upon the Earth understanding crime she sinks beneath the earth and the volcanic Brays out again and renews and cleans the Earth for the great millennium he cleans his church during that time for a people to live here amen I say it like that yep or there's coming a Time when it'll be great if you're born again today you are fighting your battle of Armageddon right now it is two opposing forces on a hill I just read you what Armageddon meant the hell who's going to win chief old Chief went to a meeting one time old Indian chief oh man he'd been struggling all his life but he goes to a meeting and he gets saved he gets born again and they see the old Chief later on I said Chief how you doing he said I'm doing good said but me got something going on inside me got white dog black dog they said they fight inside of me all the time and it's old Chief which one wins he said the one I feed the most the one I feed the most is the one that's going to win is that your situation sure it is we all fight let's stand magicians come on but he's going to finally wind up into a battle of Armageddon there because there was a battle alarm again fought and one right here all right a termination of forces the prophet of God tells us listen when you take a body change you have whipped the devil you can have a Victory Day but let's start having one now things I used to do I'd do them no more things I used to do I do them no more it was a glad day not a sad day it was a sad day in hell but it was a glad Day in heaven when I was born again but he's talking about the body of Believers you have an Armageddon that you fight every day right there is your battle and if you elect Christ come and fight that battle for you you'll win every time if you try to fight it alone and by yourself you'll lose you will lose every time not one time will you win oh you think you might but no let God fight your battles for you let Michael come on the scene and let Michael fight your battles amen you love the Lord amen let's sing a song if you ever need thank you all well like I said we're not having a second service and and you got plenty
