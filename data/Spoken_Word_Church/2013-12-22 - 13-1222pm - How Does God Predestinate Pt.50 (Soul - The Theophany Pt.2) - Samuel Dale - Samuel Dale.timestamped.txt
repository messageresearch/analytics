[5:50] Romans 8
[5:55] verse 28 and we know that all things
[5:57] work together for good to them that
[6:00] love God to them who are the called
[6:02] according to his purpose for whom he did
[6:05] for no he also did predestinate to be
[6:08] conformed to the image of his son that
[6:10] he might be the firstborn among many
[6:12] Brethren or for whom he did predestinate
[6:15] then he also called in whom he called
[6:17] and he also justified in whom he
[6:19] justified then he also glorified what
[6:23] then what shall we then say to
[6:26] these things if God be for us
[6:29] who can be against us
[6:32] okay second Corinthians
[6:34] we'll try to get to this point this
[6:36] afternoon for chapter five
[6:39] verse 1 through 4 for we know that if
[6:42] our Earthly houses this Tabernacle were
[6:44] dissolved we have a building of God and
[6:47] house not made with hands
[6:50] Eternal in the heavens for in this
[6:53] heresy
[6:54] we've grown earnestly designed to be
[6:57] clothed upon with our house which is
[6:58] from heaven
[7:00] if so be that being clothed we shall not
[7:02] be found naked for we that are in this
[7:06] Tabernacle do groan being burdened
[7:10] not for that we would be unclothed but
[7:13] clothed upon that mortality might be
[7:16] swallowed up of life you may be seated
[7:19] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[7:22] the word
[7:24] and I pray that you
[7:27] would look over my
[7:29] harshness and sternness and aggravation
[7:32] and whatever you want to call me and
[7:34] just look to one thing and believe that
[7:36] I'm just trying my best to get you and I
[7:39] to see Jesus Christ
[7:42] and where he's at
[7:44] and what we are
[7:46] because uh you know
[7:51] and I believe that God is real I do I
[7:55] believe there's a real God I believe
[7:57] he's more real than we are
[8:01] I believe he's more tangible every how
[8:03] you say that word you know real sound
[8:05] firm whatever and if we get that far
[8:08] today if we don't we'll take it up later
[8:10] we'll go into next year talking about
[8:12] this if nothing else that you say well
[8:15] did did God have a body
[8:18] said he did
[8:22] right he said he was in that body when
[8:23] he appeared to
[8:25] Moses
[8:27] when he appeared to Abraham
[8:30] he was in that body
[8:32] but see we look at things and we just
[8:34] don't want to make them to be on a real
[8:36] thing we want to kind of well God is a
[8:41] spirit
[8:44] but just remember
[8:46] God is trying to explain to us in human
[8:51] terminologies
[8:54] what he is in eternity now how can that
[8:58] be done
[8:59] the best we can do we mess it all up
[9:02] you know
[9:03] that's why I said this morning talking
[9:05] about brother random and the way he
[9:06] talked because see a theologian could
[9:09] never drop long enough to to be able to
[9:11] express enough to us for us to be able
[9:14] to see God as real
[9:16] and really they could never express
[9:18] enough to see you and I are real but you
[9:21] know what the thing that I want you to
[9:23] see more than anything else is the soul
[9:27] of that individual if it was just one
[9:29] person
[9:32] God gave his life
[9:36] that life was released out of that body
[9:40] to save just one person
[9:43] so how much or how real are we
[9:50] the spirit will
[9:52] were not just a spirit
[9:55] you know
[9:56] we're more real than anything could be
[9:59] yeah but Iran says you have within you
[10:03] the ability to create a world
[10:07] and go live on it
[10:10] but he said it's held by a bar
[10:12] you know
[10:13] not a buyer yeah
[10:17] Jesus was born out of Resurrection
[10:20] until the time was finished
[10:22] and then he could raise
[10:25] see where you and I are here because of
[10:28] what we are and what we're doing but
[10:30] when the bride relied on who she is and
[10:32] what she's here for
[10:33] amen she'll be gone
[10:35] let's see that's what I'm trying to get
[10:37] you to see that you and I are real we're
[10:40] not just uh some float around even if we
[10:43] die
[10:45] we have a place to go to whether we are
[10:48] our Christian or not
[10:51] we have a place to go to in every soul
[10:57] belongs to God Satan can't give you a
[10:59] soul
[11:00] he can't create there's no way he can do
[11:02] it
[11:03] well he he created me in nature no he
[11:07] didn't create you in nature
[11:10] he just guided you in the wrong
[11:12] direction if you're going to do anything
[11:14] you better realize the fact that you
[11:16] created your own nature
[11:19] you know you made your own nature
[11:22] you know the way that I preach you we
[11:23] God never put us in a pawn shop
[11:26] we put ourselves in the pawn shop
[11:30] he's trying to get us out
[11:34] all right but to just think about it
[11:39] the soul is what God is working on
[11:42] and that soul of that individual
[11:45] is more real than the body and spirit
[11:48] because the body and spirit can be
[11:49] destroyed
[11:51] you know are removed or whatever you
[11:53] want to call it
[11:55] but the soul of man
[11:57] only God can destroy that
[12:00] so which ones are real
[12:02] well I just brother Dale I just never
[12:04] seen my real self what do you mean
[12:07] what do you mean you've never seen your
[12:08] real self
[12:09] you mean you don't know your desires
[12:16] come on you don't know your own desires
[12:20] well I desire this I'm not talking about
[12:23] the junk garbage it went because we're
[12:25] human beings
[12:27] I'm not talking about fleshly things
[12:29] that are motivated or whatever I'm
[12:31] talking about
[12:32] a real desire
[12:36] don't you have a desire within you to
[12:38] serve God
[12:41] why would a heathen
[12:45] give their babies to an alligator or
[12:48] whatever
[12:50] if they didn't believe in God
[12:58] but see we don't think he's real we just
[13:00] think he's some form of a spirit part
[13:02] but just remember he created us
[13:06] and if he created us he's more real than
[13:08] we are and that's right
[13:11] but brother Dale I just thought God was
[13:13] a spirit and see here's what we think
[13:15] too we think God is a spirit and then he
[13:18] comes downward to try to make a body to
[13:21] come and live in
[13:23] well
[13:27] where did he come from
[13:31] and what was he
[13:34] just remember he's more real than we are
[13:37] I hope you follow that line
[13:39] but just remember now we were studying
[13:41] it talking this morning Ezekiel 18 4
[13:43] says All Souls are mine
[13:47] Satan can't create a soul
[13:50] he can't create anything
[13:54] he perverts what God creates
[13:58] amen and he can't do anything in the
[14:00] world with us until God gets through
[14:02] with us
[14:03] no matter what he thinks he can try and
[14:05] he can't do it right all right
[14:08] before the world ever began in God's
[14:12] mind
[14:13] God knew how many Souls
[14:17] he would create
[14:20] and where they would take up or come
[14:22] into a body form to live in upon Earth
[14:27] would you go that way amen
[14:30] amen that before the world ever be gone
[14:33] if not then you're trying to make him
[14:35] like you and I were peanut brains that
[14:37] are trying to make a decision as we go
[14:39] along
[14:42] that way see he can say Jacob how I
[14:44] loved he saw how I hated
[14:46] before either one ever come into the
[14:48] world
[14:50] because of his foreknowledge
[14:53] all right
[14:56] see then think about it there's not
[14:58] going to be any extra bodies
[15:00] right they're not going to be any extra
[15:02] Souls
[15:04] it didn't come into being
[15:06] and that's where I'm so glad that the
[15:08] prophet explained it
[15:10] and whether we want to believe it or not
[15:12] but he said a baby's not a soul until
[15:15] it's birthed
[15:17] it's like a wiggling animal
[15:19] with animal Wiggles in the mama
[15:22] same as a human Wiggles into mama
[15:27] the animal body could have feelings in
[15:29] that form
[15:31] you know as well as a human being
[15:34] all right
[15:36] but it's not a living Soul until God
[15:39] breathes the breath of life into it and
[15:42] it becomes a living soul
[15:44] see that to me is greater than all other
[15:46] scientific knowledge
[15:48] that mankind could ever do him because
[15:51] you're thinking about just a cubicle and
[15:53] a little spot that God puts something
[15:55] here to put something here to put
[15:56] something here and then he just takes
[15:57] them out and
[15:58] you know no
[16:00] it's all in his foreknowledge and all of
[16:03] what he's doing but we'll get back to
[16:04] that
[16:06] all right
[16:07] we found that God could only is the only
[16:10] one that could create a soul
[16:14] just as well as he's the only one that
[16:15] can destroy our soul
[16:20] if God created All Souls
[16:24] then they would have to be created
[16:25] perfect
[16:28] because he cannot create anything
[16:30] imperfect I didn't say eternal
[16:34] I said perfect even according to Ezekiel
[16:37] 28 12 and 13 through there Satan
[16:42] was created perfect
[16:44] in Beauty even
[16:46] he was the anointed cherub that Stood
[16:49] Beside the Lord
[16:51] he was perfect in his creation he went
[16:53] wrong
[16:56] and become the devil he wasn't created
[16:58] the devil he become that all right see
[17:02] then that way that no matter what
[17:06] every human being
[17:09] they would ever come into the world
[17:11] would come into Satan's domain
[17:14] and have the nature of that domain and
[17:17] be perverted all except the Lord Jesus
[17:19] Christ which was
[17:22] God Almighty in his entrance into the
[17:24] human race all right now
[17:28] and no matter what
[17:31] a soul of man
[17:34] is created in the image of God
[17:38] even in the center
[17:42] yeah
[17:43] because why because he's he's got
[17:46] creative ability
[17:49] you know
[17:50] he can do things that animals can't do
[17:54] that all right the prophet would even
[17:56] call it
[17:58] on the message called questions and
[18:00] answers let's go ahead and start our
[18:02] number four brother
[18:04] we might as well do it if I have to slow
[18:06] down I'll slow down
[18:08] God I know and realize Satan is fighting
[18:10] this to try to keep it from being done
[18:13] he's fighting me and he's fighting
[18:15] everything but I'll get across what I
[18:18] believe and then we can deal with that
[18:20] go ahead number four which is questions
[18:22] and answers 19
[18:23] 54 515 paragraph 280. look what he says
[18:31] go ahead and roll it on up you can read
[18:33] all up and down
[18:35] about the Genesis 2 man in different
[18:37] things
[18:38] he's an animal
[18:40] dumb brute he's talking about animals
[18:44] right now he's not talking about man
[18:45] okay
[18:46] he's an animal dumb brute he hasn't got
[18:49] a soul he can't read and write
[18:52] he can't talk speak he's a dumb brute
[18:55] now here's where we're going brother
[18:57] don't know it they taught dogs to say
[18:59] words
[19:01] that's what I'm saying this morning
[19:04] you go down and you tell somebody Sue
[19:06] they gave me a perfect bill of health
[19:08] there's plenty of people died with a
[19:10] perfect million what are you trying to
[19:12] do
[19:13] why don't you admit you're an unbeliever
[19:16] I'm sorry forgive me I get started again
[19:21] because it tires me up
[19:24] look he can't read or write
[19:26] he can't talk speak he's a dumb brute
[19:28] but a man is in flesh like a brute
[19:33] but he's got a soul of God in him what
[19:36] makes him Immortal he even wants to call
[19:38] it
[19:40] now we know that doesn't mean Eternal
[19:42] but it means we have the ability to be
[19:44] made Eternal why because see what he's
[19:46] talking about and he can invent look
[19:48] what he can do he's on almost on the
[19:51] equal with God because he's the son of
[19:54] God even in his Fallen estate he's
[19:57] wonderful look at him
[20:00] the human being has a right to come to
[20:02] immortality
[20:04] if we believe
[20:07] but he's a soul
[20:10] and we'll read like he put it on like
[20:14] here's saying something he put it on
[20:18] now according to Blasphemous names turn
[20:21] around and said Adam was standing there
[20:23] coming up out of the earth that he was
[20:25] in and said God breathe into his
[20:27] nostrils and he become a living soul
[20:33] he said well what was it before then
[20:37] he was 16 elements
[20:40] right
[20:41] he need to became a living Soul all
[20:43] right we're going to see today what that
[20:46] really was getting to but look
[20:50] think about these things now
[20:53] even in his Fallen condition look at the
[20:55] next one and inside 1962.
[21:00] and now now being
[21:02] that he has made
[21:04] even in his Fallen condition
[21:08] yet he's in the image of his maker
[21:11] God
[21:13] and in one sense of the word
[21:16] he's the son of God
[21:19] fallen from Grace
[21:21] because that's what he is
[21:24] had there been no sin what would we have
[21:25] done
[21:27] right
[21:29] he's falling away from what God made him
[21:31] to be
[21:32] and he's following the state
[21:35] gives him them attributes to try to do
[21:38] something to bring himself back up to a
[21:41] place where something inside of him
[21:44] tells him that he come from
[21:48] now think about it
[21:51] because he knows he's not in the right
[21:53] condition yet
[21:54] because he sees death sickness and
[21:56] Sovereign heart aches and
[21:58] disappointments he knows he wasn't made
[22:01] for that yet no matter how far he is
[22:04] away from God
[22:06] there is something with inside of him
[22:09] that tells him that
[22:12] some inside something
[22:14] now a man is made up as a Triune being
[22:18] so body and spirit
[22:22] Even in our fallen estate
[22:28] we have creative abilities
[22:31] like Wade was talking about Wednesday
[22:34] TV was in the garden what was it not
[22:36] sitting there so
[22:37] oh give me the name of one
[22:40] you know some name or something
[22:43] yeah
[22:44] all right wasn't an automobile sitting
[22:47] out there
[22:48] no all of the material
[22:52] that it would take to make those things
[22:54] was in the garden
[22:57] all right
[22:59] and in doing that all I had to do would
[23:01] just be brought together who brought it
[23:03] together
[23:07] who brought together all of this
[23:09] material and made it into houses and
[23:12] cars and planes and
[23:16] man
[23:17] right right
[23:20] because he was in the image in his
[23:23] Fallen estate
[23:25] he's in the image of his creator
[23:28] because he has creative ability
[23:31] the Bible says the imagination of man's
[23:33] heart was continually evil but he had to
[23:36] put him out of the garden why
[23:39] look what it would be if you had an
[23:40] eternal soul
[23:42] and you out of the garden stinking like
[23:44] a natural carnal person
[23:47] it'd be trouble
[23:50] but you see folks now get the point let
[23:53] me get down to what I'm talking about
[23:55] whether you believe what I'm talking
[23:56] about or not just listening
[23:59] that's where I believe that the soul of
[24:02] an individual
[24:04] you go to the fatherless countries that
[24:06] have never heard the name Jesus
[24:10] that was amazing when they went back
[24:11] into the jungles
[24:13] of Africa or some continent like I
[24:15] believe it was Africa
[24:17] and they found a mother-son worship
[24:24] right
[24:28] where did that come from when they never
[24:30] heard of a white man or seen one you
[24:32] know where a black person who was saved
[24:34] you know what I mean
[24:38] they feed their kids to the alligators
[24:40] to try to piece them
[24:43] they worship
[24:45] somebody was telling me just the other
[24:47] day that the problem they were having
[24:49] now with the the Indian people
[24:53] well where was that somebody told me
[24:55] said the problem they were having with
[24:56] the Indian people now was that the
[24:59] Indian people were trying to lean back
[25:00] away from Christianity back to their old
[25:03] way of life
[25:06] because you know
[25:09] they've seen Christianity's fail
[25:11] and they're trying to lean back to their
[25:13] old form of life
[25:15] you know that like it was Geronimo when
[25:17] it saw visions
[25:19] they lived of the nature of the land
[25:23] and they felt a call of everything
[25:25] and they were
[25:26] in a lot of ways a whole lot better than
[25:28] we were
[25:29] right
[25:31] because they were just plain Indians
[25:34] run around and said that they believe in
[25:36] an imaginary way that their imaginary
[25:39] God has entered that Idol
[25:42] and he said and they can even hear
[25:44] voices
[25:46] speaking to him
[25:48] well
[25:52] could be very close might be better off
[25:53] to be that than it is some Christianity
[25:55] today right
[25:58] but yet we don't want it to be that way
[26:01] but you see the soul of an individual no
[26:04] matter what he is whether he's lost
[26:05] whether he's saved what he is
[26:09] it's a marvelous thing
[26:12] to think of being a person
[26:16] he said well I'm a person I'm Body
[26:17] Spirit and soul that's fine it takes
[26:19] that to make you
[26:21] just like father-son holy ghost makes
[26:23] one true and living God
[26:26] but just remember
[26:28] the soul is what God is working on we
[26:30] read that this excuse me this morning
[26:35] and he's working on that soul
[26:37] trying to contact us
[26:40] to save us
[26:43] he's not interested in Saving bodies
[26:46] that'll take place in the process
[26:47] because that's in the process of
[26:49] salvation
[26:50] all right he's interested in our soul
[26:52] read through the scripture now and just
[26:54] everything you read look at the word
[26:56] soul
[26:57] even though you may read the word heart
[26:59] as we were using this morning you know
[27:01] out of the heart precedes all things
[27:03] envious drivers you know Murder whatever
[27:06] comes out of the heart what out of the
[27:08] soul of man not out of the thumping
[27:09] gizzard that we call a heart
[27:12] the heart of man is the sinner or the
[27:14] the real part of your being that's real
[27:17] and that's where the soul is
[27:20] and you say well brother Dale you mean
[27:22] you believe souls are real I believe
[27:24] your soul is so real if you remove from
[27:26] right here you're going somewhere
[27:29] and you're not going to change looks
[27:32] I've got a quote in here somewhere where
[27:34] brought around and said it doesn't
[27:36] change your soul doesn't change because
[27:38] then it just changes the place
[27:43] you're either here you're there
[27:45] it doesn't change it would you know now
[27:48] I don't believe those are beyond the
[27:49] curtain of time the bride of Christ or
[27:51] they're in Old bodies
[27:53] but I ain't going to argue with you
[27:54] about them others in other dimensions
[27:57] I'm just not going to argue with you
[27:58] about it I'm going to leave it alone
[27:59] because I don't know I ain't never found
[28:01] where brought around said they wasn't
[28:02] looking old
[28:04] or young or whatever
[28:06] all right so we just leave that alone
[28:08] let it go
[28:11] nah
[28:12] the real you
[28:16] the part of you
[28:18] that we'll read in a minute that is your
[28:20] intelligence
[28:24] your intelligence is not your body
[28:27] that's that brain it's just a masses of
[28:30] you know
[28:31] computerized sales or whatever you don't
[28:33] call it
[28:34] um
[28:35] it's not just the spirit of man
[28:40] your intelligence is the real you
[28:45] because that's what's doing the thinking
[28:48] me all right and being the real you that
[28:51] intelligence
[28:53] that's a person
[28:56] and God is not working to save a spirit
[29:01] just some spiritual being he wants to
[29:03] say that from what
[29:09] come on from what are you going to save
[29:11] it from
[29:14] you knock a person in the head and they
[29:16] become paralyzed
[29:18] immobile from neck down or safe but you
[29:21] know what that don't stop their thinking
[29:25] right
[29:27] and you stop the mobility of the person
[29:30] right
[29:32] I believe God God's real
[29:39] I don't believe he was just a
[29:41] Cloud floating around
[29:43] and then he decided to come something
[29:45] else
[29:47] and then he decided to become something
[29:49] else and he finally created a body and
[29:51] said well that's good I'll just live
[29:52] right there
[29:53] he would already live in before then
[29:58] but around and said that's a difference
[29:59] in him and you or not
[30:02] he said he came in that word body form
[30:06] read who is this male chatted in case I
[30:08] don't get back to it tonight I mean this
[30:10] afternoon
[30:13] see we we had to bypass and come down
[30:17] but now when I get into what I'm going
[30:18] to say here then you're going to say how
[30:20] did we do this how did we do that just
[30:22] don't worry about how did we do
[30:24] we're not playing Howdy Doody
[30:28] that's a long time ago
[30:31] even the kids now don't even know about
[30:32] how to duty
[30:34] right any of the kids know about it now
[30:36] no they don't even know about it they
[30:37] know all this other stuff but us old
[30:39] kids known about howdy Duty you know
[30:42] you know
[30:44] but listen
[30:46] if you can believe that the soul of the
[30:49] individual is more real than this pulpit
[30:54] and if it's not
[30:57] more real I want to ask you a question
[31:00] do you believe the prophet said you have
[31:03] within you
[31:05] the ability to create a world
[31:08] do you believe that
[31:12] well then it's got to have it's got to
[31:13] be more real than this
[31:22] it would be able to bring it into being
[31:25] but see the soul of an individual is the
[31:28] real you
[31:29] now listen to what I'm saying
[31:32] when I start on this part next
[31:35] you're going to run haywire and people
[31:36] will run that away and run that away
[31:37] just stay with me
[31:42] I'm talking about the soul of an
[31:45] individual
[31:47] as to being the real you
[31:51] I am not talking about salvation at this
[31:55] moment of the message
[31:58] I'm talking about just us as human
[32:01] beings
[32:05] this human beings
[32:10] keep that in mind
[32:12] as we we read some
[32:14] that's why I can believe
[32:17] and I don't have to
[32:20] you know if I've ever done it come and
[32:21] show me where I've had to reject a quote
[32:24] the prophet was saying
[32:28] come on you got the internet you got the
[32:30] messages you got the ability to search
[32:32] me back to 19 and or to 2002 at least
[32:35] even on the internet come on
[32:37] and see if I've changed
[32:41] because I've always believed
[32:44] what I'm trying to talk about
[32:46] that God is real
[32:50] and there's the soul of man is real
[32:55] man it's just floating around or some
[32:57] spirit that motivates you you know
[33:01] now see that way we can tell whether
[33:04] we're Hypocrites or not
[33:06] gotta remember that
[33:09] the prophet said they were Hypocrites
[33:10] because out of their mouth they said one
[33:13] thing but their actions was another
[33:16] thing
[33:18] say you are the Messiah
[33:20] in the forms of saying it but then they
[33:22] would back out and say we know nobody
[33:24] can do what you're doing
[33:26] but then they turn around say and kill
[33:28] him
[33:30] for being what he was
[33:32] all right
[33:33] now
[33:35] see I believe what the prophet had to
[33:37] say
[33:38] in another way I can keep it lined up
[33:42] right
[33:43] so let's go now and go to where
[33:45] everybody knows where I'm fixing to head
[33:47] that's been around here for a while
[33:49] but let's go to number six
[33:52] which is 279 of the Hebrews chapter 2
[33:55] part 3 57 823 to 8 28 school which is
[34:00] actually uh page 80 of the Hebrew Book
[34:04] even to those that don't have the
[34:06] ability to search go to page 80 in the
[34:08] Hebrew Book then you'll find this quote
[34:12] and when Man became into that body
[34:17] he had control of the fishes
[34:20] and the fowls and the beasts of the
[34:22] field
[34:23] now what body was that
[34:28] in the image of God created he him
[34:31] and gave you know male or female
[34:34] created them and gave them ruling
[34:37] ability over the animals
[34:40] so what did he create
[34:42] this is Spirit
[34:45] was God just a spirit
[34:50] they were there in theophany form right
[34:55] the soul to look at him
[34:58] and then there was no man to till the
[35:00] soil
[35:01] Genesis 2. he doesn't make male and
[35:04] female but there's no man to tell the
[35:05] soil he hadn't brought him into being
[35:07] first man was spirit being
[35:10] God's spirit being right
[35:14] right what form was God in
[35:17] what form was the man in all right so
[35:19] roll it on up you can read in between
[35:20] he's made out of the Dust of the earth
[35:22] he's made all the things and here's the
[35:25] one that where people go Haywire then
[35:27] but the difference between an animal and
[35:30] a man
[35:31] God put a soul in a man
[35:34] and he didn't put it in the animal
[35:36] because the soul that was in the man is
[35:39] that theophany
[35:45] now
[35:46] this is not as I said something new for
[35:48] me to preach This is 40 years old or
[35:51] more
[35:53] when those two Soul people was trying to
[35:55] tell you how many Souls you had God was
[35:57] revealing to me that he was real
[36:04] and he was trying to get us to see how
[36:06] real we are
[36:07] but brother Dale
[36:09] I've always believed that my theophany
[36:11] was up there
[36:13] and I got a lot of quotes from The
[36:15] Prophet
[36:16] no
[36:18] I know what brother Rhino says
[36:22] he said it was up there
[36:29] and we're down here
[36:31] but I remind you he also said
[36:34] we always was eternal
[36:39] but he also said we had to receive
[36:41] eternal life to become eternal
[36:43] no
[36:45] see what I'm saying you can just throw
[36:47] quotes anywhere you want to
[36:52] let the prophet of God says your soul is
[36:55] your theophany
[36:58] do you believe that Jesus is so was his
[37:01] theophany
[37:02] let's establish that
[37:05] his soul was his theophany
[37:09] because that's the way he came before he
[37:10] came on down into human flesh
[37:13] all right
[37:14] so let's go ahead and read a little bit
[37:18] look at number seven
[37:22] this is called entombment
[37:26] 57 426
[37:30] or 420 excuse me
[37:33] here he goes
[37:35] where did he leave when he left
[37:38] the Bible said he ascended and went and
[37:41] preached the souls that were in prison
[37:43] that repented not into long-suffering on
[37:46] the days of Noah remember the Bible says
[37:49] so spirit
[37:51] s
[37:52] but the word spirit and soul is
[37:54] interchangeable
[37:57] see the scripture says the spirit that
[37:59] brought around when he brings and he
[38:00] brings the law and preached to the souls
[38:02] that were in prison that repented not in
[38:05] the long days in the days of Noah his
[38:08] soul his Spirit his theophany of his own
[38:10] being
[38:13] that pretty well covers it all done went
[38:15] down he said let's follow him
[38:18] he goes down and describes going on down
[38:22] the place of going downward
[38:26] and he describes a place of going
[38:28] upwards
[38:29] see soul to the unjust down there he
[38:33] went and preached to the souls in prison
[38:35] all right
[38:36] now
[38:40] look at this one
[38:44] this is a message called Faith 1961 813
[38:48] which is uh paragraph four
[38:51] I think it goes through paragraph seven
[38:56] then when we receive Christ into our
[38:58] horse
[38:59] there's all that we have need of there's
[39:01] eternal life now Christ could not come
[39:03] back until three days was fulfilled
[39:05] because his Spirit was behind the screen
[39:07] like a bar like this that he could not
[39:10] cross over that bar because it was a
[39:13] spoken word that he was to lay in the
[39:15] grave for three days and three nights
[39:17] that's what kept Him from Raising right
[39:20] okay
[39:21] now he could not come back until that
[39:24] three days and nights was up
[39:27] then went three days and nights were up
[39:29] his Spirit was loose it went directly to
[39:33] his soul
[39:34] and his soul came back
[39:36] and he picked up the body
[39:38] and fulfilled what he said I have power
[39:41] to lay my life down
[39:43] I have power to take it up again I have
[39:46] the power
[39:48] now we just read
[39:51] the quote before that his soul went to
[39:53] hell
[39:55] all right now he said describing it look
[39:58] at that now this is the quote that we're
[40:00] talking about now each one of you have
[40:02] power the same way
[40:07] what did he have to do he had power to
[40:10] lay his life down he had power to take
[40:12] his life back
[40:15] and watch
[40:16] now each one of you have power the same
[40:18] way because you are Sons and Daughters
[40:21] of God and the Very Spirit that's in you
[40:23] this morning the Holy Spirit has seen
[40:25] you this morning
[40:26] that same holy spirit will raise you up
[40:29] so you have power to raise yourself back
[40:32] up
[40:34] don't worry if you die don't worry about
[40:36] it
[40:37] when you die your soul will go
[40:40] the under the altar of God what not in
[40:44] right in the presence of God
[40:47] now you're because we'll divide that in
[40:49] a minute because the sold under the
[40:51] altar is not right directly into his
[40:52] friend you remember brother random when
[40:54] he went beyond the curtain of time he
[40:56] wanted to see Jesus he said he's in a
[40:57] higher dimension
[40:59] okay so hold on to that
[41:02] now your spirit will go to God
[41:05] but you cannot come back
[41:07] you remember the Bible that said the
[41:09] spirit the souls under the alt are
[41:10] crying how long how long they could not
[41:13] return until the scriptures fulfilled
[41:15] and right Christ could not return until
[41:17] the scriptures fulfilled then after the
[41:20] all has been done all the suffering's
[41:23] over and the Brethren has suffered the
[41:25] same things
[41:26] where we've suffered like they suffered
[41:28] and so forth then on that day you'll
[41:32] know exactly where you're buried
[41:36] your spirit will be turned loose from
[41:38] God and will come to that soul
[41:44] now the soul is that part of you who
[41:48] knows and understands
[41:51] your intelligence
[41:53] now watch him
[41:55] this now is 1961. you remember the
[41:59] vision I had not long ago or the little
[42:01] translation and I went into that place
[42:04] and saw those people
[42:06] now your spirit will come back to that
[42:08] body
[42:10] and that that kind of a body
[42:12] the soul
[42:15] and he's calling it a body
[42:18] which is the body that does not have to
[42:20] eat and so forth
[42:22] if this early type of natural meters are
[42:24] we have one already waiting a Celestial
[42:26] body and with that spirit and that soul
[42:28] and Celestial body you rise up again
[42:31] this Natural Body to that great
[42:33] Millennium seal you have the power in
[42:36] you now to do that now but that power
[42:38] that you have in you now
[42:41] could make a new world
[42:43] God doesn't have a little weak spots and
[42:45] big heavy spots that's powerful the
[42:48] least little touch of God is on the
[42:50] omnipotent see the least little touch of
[42:52] God all right you can actually create a
[42:55] world watch out but you have a reason
[42:57] for not doing why because what do we
[42:59] need one right
[43:01] right
[43:02] it wouldn't work
[43:04] but your soul now watch
[43:07] if his soul was his theophany
[43:12] now remember we'll get to it in a minute
[43:13] that's the offense body
[43:17] it's not just a spirit that floats
[43:19] around
[43:24] it's a body
[43:29] God lived in a body
[43:32] and it's called in forms of theophany
[43:35] look at the next one number eight
[43:40] notice these Souls unto the order this
[43:42] is taken from demonology in 1953 11 12.
[43:45] notice these sold under the altar here
[43:47] they sold I mean in Jesus here I read
[43:50] the text a few minutes ago and he goes
[43:53] more of My Flesh on you know the Hope
[43:54] neither would I suffer my Holy One to
[43:56] see corruption not leave my soul in hell
[43:59] now there's a scripture party it ain't
[44:01] going to leave your soul in hell and
[44:03] said nothing about his body or his
[44:04] spirit and he's going to leave us all in
[44:06] Hell a better scripture for that is
[44:08] found in Peter he said Jesus when he
[44:11] died he went and preached to the souls
[44:13] that were in Chains of darkness in
[44:16] prison waiting for the Eternal judgment
[44:18] that Jesus when he died at Calvary went
[44:21] and preached to souls unjust Souls that
[44:25] repented not in the long-suffering of
[44:27] the days of Noah
[44:29] now his soul is his theophany
[44:34] you see the point is we think but but
[44:36] brother I thought we had a theophany up
[44:39] there
[44:43] now here's one of them
[44:45] things you're going to have to think
[44:48] you remember the other day
[44:50] Revelation 7 where brother Branham says
[44:53] that is not the bride
[44:56] and two messages after then
[45:00] which that was in the seals two messages
[45:02] I showed up and he said it was the bride
[45:06] oh brother Dale that's contradictory no
[45:11] they're both right
[45:15] it's according to what you're applying
[45:17] it amen
[45:18] amen
[45:19] now
[45:21] to say your spirit went to hell
[45:25] you'd be right because it's his soul
[45:27] to say your soul went to hell they
[45:29] arrived in his soul is his theophany
[45:31] because that was the body he come in
[45:35] back before the foundation of the world
[45:38] and then he could create from that body
[45:41] which will be the word form I hope we
[45:43] get time to get to it
[45:45] but see we think that we've got
[45:47] something up yonder
[45:49] and we're down here
[45:53] that's right
[45:56] that's exactly right
[46:00] well I don't see how you can we down
[46:02] here and be up there why don't you ask
[46:04] God to reveal it to you
[46:07] why don't you take a look at the Statue
[46:09] of a perfect man
[46:12] you're born again at Faith
[46:16] right
[46:17] that's the new birth
[46:19] well you know the day you got the new
[46:21] birth
[46:23] did you have the headstone
[46:26] no you got to grow into it
[46:29] but it was already there
[46:32] you're going to say it wouldn't
[46:34] but that's God's mind
[46:37] now I'll come back through this again a
[46:39] dozen times I know
[46:42] you check where brother random is
[46:44] talking about that we already have that
[46:46] body that's exactly right I believe it
[46:50] because that's the positive of God's
[46:52] mind
[46:53] there's something pulling you
[46:55] right
[46:57] the positive of God's mind is pulling
[47:00] you an eye toward that being just like
[47:03] the statue of a perfect man when you get
[47:05] Faith it starts a pull
[47:08] up to the headstone
[47:10] all right
[47:12] see then it's right to say we have one
[47:14] waiting
[47:17] but it's right to say my soul is my
[47:19] theophany
[47:22] and I told you I wasn't talking about
[47:24] all about Christians
[47:26] but we're going to read a quote in a
[47:27] minute where that those Souls
[47:30] that he wouldn't preached to in hell
[47:33] they were in theophany also
[47:39] he said
[47:41] you've confused me no I didn't
[47:45] I have not confused you
[47:48] you were already confused and I exposed
[47:52] it
[47:54] so don't say brother Dale you're so D I
[47:58] can't understand if you'll pray
[48:04] ask God to speak to you
[48:07] amen and then listen with common sense
[48:13] you know just common sense
[48:17] because we're going to read in a minute
[48:18] because it said it under scripture
[48:21] in Corinthians we have one in heaven
[48:24] eternal
[48:27] do we have eternal life up there
[48:30] and we have eternal life down here
[48:37] come on
[48:39] you see folks we missed the whole thing
[48:41] it's just like the quotes from Brother
[48:43] random Soldier under the old are crying
[48:45] how long oh he straightened that out on
[48:48] the fifth seal
[48:52] he said Souls under the altar was the
[48:54] fifth sealed you
[48:56] he never said so done a daughter as if
[48:59] you have sealed Jew
[49:01] he said sold under the altar that cry
[49:04] how long how long to avenge our blood
[49:08] is the fifth sealed Jew he said because
[49:10] the bride don't ask for Revenge
[49:15] he said that's the way you can tell the
[49:16] difference
[49:18] then in 1965 the angel of the Lord
[49:20] referred to souls under the altar as
[49:24] being the soldier of those individuals
[49:27] he went and saw beyond the curtain of
[49:28] time
[49:34] you see
[49:36] I know when I start talking like that it
[49:38] requires a revelation to understand that
[49:42] but all I do is just ask you to go pray
[49:47] I don't ask you my wife my kids my
[49:49] grandkids great grandkids I don't ask
[49:52] them to believe what I believe I ask
[49:54] them to have their own Holy Ghost speak
[49:57] to them
[50:00] because me speaking to them is wonderful
[50:02] that's fine
[50:04] but it won't get my revelation
[50:09] but when God speaks
[50:12] it'll be revealed to you then nobody
[50:14] can't take it away from you
[50:17] that's right you mean you come all this
[50:19] way and you believe in one God and you
[50:21] no we don't understand everything about
[50:22] it do it no huh but we believe it and
[50:24] somebody come along said ain't one God
[50:27] in the Bible it's a trinity well I
[50:29] didn't realize that it's a trinity
[50:33] then you'd ever seen it
[50:35] you didn't even see it intellectually
[50:41] listen
[50:44] sold under the altar
[50:52] let's read it right now while we had it
[50:54] in okay number nine it's taken for
[50:57] trying to do God a service without his
[50:58] will
[51:00] without it being God's will
[51:02] 1965 11 27 so this is way after the
[51:05] opening of the seals
[51:06] okay
[51:07] paragraph 228
[51:10] if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved
[51:12] we have on one already waiting
[51:17] well brother Dallas already over there
[51:22] well
[51:26] he describes it
[51:28] the good Heavenly Father permitted me to
[51:31] walk behind that curtain one day and see
[51:33] it how many heard that see look at the
[51:36] past the curtain of time there it was
[51:38] just the same as I'm preaching to you
[51:40] all
[51:43] are they stood
[51:47] Souls under the altar crying how long
[51:51] not just a myth somebody who had
[51:54] intelligence you know not just a myth
[51:56] it's somebody that had intelligence
[51:59] how long Lord see while we feel that
[52:02] ever now is our age huh
[52:04] listen
[52:07] go on to the next one we'll just stay
[52:08] after this we'll stay on things that are
[52:10] to be which in 1965 1205. paragraph 127
[52:14] 128.
[52:17] and he's coming down and said past and
[52:19] the boy stops it don't you remember her
[52:21] I said no now where's the at beyond the
[52:23] curtain of time right
[52:25] did you letter to Christ when she was
[52:27] 590. in case you see why she says
[52:30] precious brother
[52:31] I said well do do you go said no
[52:35] we're waiting here I said well if I
[52:38] passed over I want to see Jesus
[52:41] said you can't see him now
[52:44] watch somebody's telling him it
[52:48] right
[52:50] they said to him you can't see him now
[52:53] this is the scripture
[52:57] said sold under the altar
[53:01] he's just a little higher
[53:03] someday he will return we'll go back to
[53:05] Earth we don't eat or drink here
[53:11] Souls under the altar
[53:15] that takes it away from just being a
[53:17] filth sealed Jew
[53:20] Phil sealed you remember said how long
[53:22] how long to avenge our blood
[53:25] read your scripture
[53:27] the bride is beyond the curtain of time
[53:29] today and what did he see Souls
[53:33] real people he said back prior to this
[53:35] just like speaking to you
[53:38] he could feel them he could handle them
[53:41] he could hear them right
[53:45] now come on
[53:47] so they were real
[53:50] not just Spirits floating around
[53:55] okay
[53:57] look at the next one we brought back
[53:59] questions and answers on Hebrews 2 16 57
[54:04] 1002.
[54:06] his body was in the grave
[54:08] and his soul was in Hell preaching alive
[54:11] what about that he was in his theophany
[54:14] again his soul was down there with those
[54:16] people that were in theophany also
[54:20] now he's down there
[54:23] okay
[54:24] and was witnessing to them that they
[54:27] repented not in the long suffering
[54:32] see Church
[54:35] we're not opening up
[54:40] and asking God for a revelation
[54:43] we're trying to pull a revelation
[54:46] down into our category
[54:50] and that won't work
[54:53] message adoption
[54:56] paragraph 97 1965 18.
[54:59] and Paul said it does not yet appear
[55:01] just exactly what kind of a body we'll
[55:03] have but we know we'll have a body like
[55:06] his
[55:08] okay
[55:09] what did you ever what did he ever have
[55:13] that theophany body
[55:16] it's oh my God right
[55:21] yes sir
[55:24] he had to see off anybody
[55:27] yes sir when he died the Bible said that
[55:30] he is a personal pronoun
[55:32] again
[55:34] he went to hell and preached to the
[55:35] souls in prison hallelujah how did he do
[55:38] it he had sensitive feeling he had
[55:41] sensitive hearing he had sensitive
[55:42] speech he had preached with that same
[55:44] kind of body I saw those glorified ones
[55:48] in the other night
[55:53] he preached to the souls that were in
[55:56] hell that repented not in the long
[55:58] suffering in the days of Noah
[56:01] do we really believe that
[56:05] we really believe that that was his soul
[56:07] his being his person
[56:12] do we really believe that that Soul was
[56:14] that theophany
[56:20] that logos that theophany that Son of
[56:23] God that stepped out in the beginning
[56:27] and that's why it caused
[56:30] Jesus Christ
[56:32] the Creator God
[56:35] because he was real
[56:41] what do we think
[56:43] are you
[56:46] number 13.
[56:49] I got 132 33 of Hebrews chapter 4. 57
[56:54] 901e
[56:57] and as we had it the other night brought
[56:59] in the beginning was Spirit then from
[57:01] God went out the Lord gosh or the
[57:03] theophany which was the form of a man
[57:06] called the son of God
[57:08] prefigured he came in Earth in a body of
[57:11] Flesh
[57:16] are you reading
[57:20] or are you sleeping
[57:26] what was that sleep on the son of man's
[57:28] been behind the hand of sinful man
[57:32] he came in Earth in a body of Flesh even
[57:35] before he came in Jesus Christ
[57:40] right
[57:42] now swallow that one once brother
[57:47] all right
[57:49] I'll prove it to you he said
[57:51] see when Moses saw him he said let me
[57:54] Sue your form Lord
[57:56] and God hit him in the rock
[57:58] and when he passed by he said it was the
[58:01] back part of a man
[58:03] that was that theophany that's exactly
[58:06] then that theophany had to be made flesh
[58:10] not another person but the same person
[58:13] had to become flesh to take this thing
[58:16] out of death
[58:18] what about it
[58:21] what about it
[58:26] he came in a body
[58:29] now I've got it in here somewhere we'll
[58:31] get to it
[58:34] he came in a form to
[58:36] Abraham
[58:38] it was called Melchizedek
[58:41] right
[58:44] God in human flesh
[58:47] now watch Melchizedek
[58:53] the guy that ate the calf
[58:57] nerves where you got to be real careful
[59:00] why
[59:02] like Aaron said one time said he just
[59:04] sprinkled if I get this right or wrong
[59:07] you correct it with him he said he just
[59:09] sprinkled
[59:11] that the offney man down over that body
[59:14] and become God in human flesh or maybe
[59:16] the word of Flesh over the theophany
[59:20] body the things the way he was saying it
[59:22] all right
[59:26] you see what kind of a body was he in he
[59:28] was in a theophany
[59:30] he appeared to Moses and I said this
[59:32] morning Moses said Lord I'd love to see
[59:35] you
[59:37] don't you want to see him
[59:39] but yet you failed his presence you've
[59:41] been birthed by his presence you've
[59:43] you've been in in great atmospheres with
[59:46] him around you and I but you want to see
[59:48] him don't you
[59:49] Moses had spoke to him lived to ear
[59:53] mouth to mouth
[59:55] seen him in the burning bush seen him do
[59:57] all the things but he said Lord I love
[59:59] to see you
[1:00:02] he said just go stand in that Cliff to
[1:00:04] the Rock remember that was the same one
[1:00:05] that the water came out of you remember
[1:00:08] the cleft of The Rock
[1:00:10] and he went and stood in that cleft of
[1:00:11] The Rock and when he passed by
[1:00:15] he was evidently looking this way and
[1:00:17] when it did he went like that well he
[1:00:20] saw the back part of the man because he
[1:00:22] told him he said you can't see my face
[1:00:26] that no man can see my face he'll die we
[1:00:29] can see the back part
[1:00:30] a theophany
[1:00:32] Abraham
[1:00:35] sat down and fed
[1:00:38] Melchizedek
[1:00:42] meat and milk and bread
[1:00:46] he said well wait a minute we had a
[1:00:47] quote director a while ago I'm glad
[1:00:49] you're thinking you remember the quote
[1:00:51] that said in theophany
[1:00:53] you don't eat or drink
[1:00:58] okay
[1:01:00] Melchizedek
[1:01:02] was inside that body
[1:01:06] the body wasn't Melchizedek the body was
[1:01:09] just a spoken word into existence and
[1:01:13] back out of existence in there
[1:01:15] was the theophany
[1:01:17] the body of Jesus
[1:01:19] yep
[1:01:20] the human body of Jesus
[1:01:24] was not it's theophany
[1:01:27] it was a human body
[1:01:29] but inside of that body
[1:01:32] that's right dwelt the very God because
[1:01:36] it wouldn't his body it went to hell
[1:01:38] it was a soul from the inside of him
[1:01:42] think about it
[1:01:45] so let's read this part right here
[1:01:49] let's go to where who is this
[1:01:51] Melchizedek 1965.
[1:01:53] 221 the evening service
[1:01:56] start with paragraph 67.
[1:01:59] Now read it very carefully
[1:02:01] now we see the attribute
[1:02:03] sons of his spirit
[1:02:06] have not yet entered into
[1:02:10] the word form body
[1:02:12] we have not yet entered into the word
[1:02:16] form body we become the word here
[1:02:20] so we're going to read we bypassed it
[1:02:25] which don't mean it was iron we went
[1:02:27] around it
[1:02:28] it means it wasn't in existence
[1:02:31] Jesus came keep this in mind as we read
[1:02:35] Jesus came word form
[1:02:40] body
[1:02:42] theophany
[1:02:44] fullness
[1:02:47] around
[1:02:49] we have not yet entered through the word
[1:02:51] form body but a theophany
[1:02:57] twinkle little
[1:03:03] change of the body now the difference
[1:03:06] between him and you as a son
[1:03:08] see he was at the beginning the word
[1:03:11] and an amorphy body
[1:03:14] speaking of Jesus Christ right
[1:03:16] he came and lived in that in the person
[1:03:19] of Melchizedek
[1:03:21] then later we never heard no more of
[1:03:23] Melchizedek
[1:03:24] because he became Jesus Christ
[1:03:27] Melchizedek was a priest but he became
[1:03:29] Jesus Christ now you bypass that because
[1:03:33] in that form he knowed all things and
[1:03:36] you have never been able to know that
[1:03:39] yet
[1:03:42] simple
[1:03:43] he came away that he would be the
[1:03:46] fullest and he would know everything
[1:03:49] you and I are going to come away that we
[1:03:51] don't know everything
[1:03:52] right
[1:03:56] all right
[1:03:59] you come like Adam like me
[1:04:02] you become from the attribute to the
[1:04:04] flesh to be tempted when this life is
[1:04:06] finished here is this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:04:08] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:04:10] that's where we go that is the word then
[1:04:14] we can look back and see what we've done
[1:04:17] now we don't understand it we have never
[1:04:19] become the word
[1:04:21] we've just become the flesh man not the
[1:04:24] word
[1:04:25] but now look clearly makes it clear you
[1:04:27] will never be the word unless you was a
[1:04:30] thought at the beginning that proves the
[1:04:32] predestination of God see you can't be
[1:04:35] the word unless you are a thought
[1:04:38] you had to be in the thinking first
[1:04:41] which you see in order to stand
[1:04:43] temptation
[1:04:44] you had to bypass the theophany
[1:04:49] but now you said your soul is he doesn't
[1:04:52] talk about Soul being too often anything
[1:04:57] remember the word
[1:05:00] he came in a word form body
[1:05:06] which is the theophany of God we come as
[1:05:10] human Mortals with a mortal Soul lost
[1:05:14] and our soul then is our theophany why
[1:05:17] because it's where you're going after
[1:05:19] you die
[1:05:21] come on folks you realize those souls in
[1:05:23] prison they had a soul
[1:05:28] right they were dire as a soul
[1:05:34] if I'm lost and I die I've got a place
[1:05:37] to go to
[1:05:38] why because my soul is what I am it's
[1:05:42] going to live on
[1:05:45] and can be called a theophany
[1:05:48] because of theophany means simply the
[1:05:50] body of God
[1:05:54] but if I'm born again
[1:05:59] my soul goes under the altar
[1:06:02] to wait
[1:06:04] because it's my theophy
[1:06:07] I already have it
[1:06:09] see that's the thing folks that I've
[1:06:11] tried for 40 something years
[1:06:13] to get people to get away from
[1:06:16] I sit back there in that Baptist Church
[1:06:18] and I long for some way for somebody to
[1:06:21] help me
[1:06:23] but I had met God
[1:06:25] not seen him and I knew that he was real
[1:06:27] and it wasn't just a well I hope we're
[1:06:30] going to heaven if we get to heaven
[1:06:32] we'll be all right but if we don't
[1:06:34] I guess there's another way somewhere
[1:06:36] else
[1:06:37] you can pay your way out
[1:06:39] if you go to Purgatory you said the
[1:06:41] Baptist never taught that
[1:06:47] uh you almost all afternoon
[1:06:49] you want to talk about baptist Doctrine
[1:06:52] you know nobody goes to hell anymore
[1:06:55] they're going to have to do away with it
[1:06:58] because everybody's going to heaven
[1:07:01] right that's what I hear all right you
[1:07:04] paved the parking lot
[1:07:08] right
[1:07:09] why that man painted the church
[1:07:12] he ain't going to hell
[1:07:14] now you tell me that's any different
[1:07:16] than giving the money to the priest and
[1:07:19] him paying you out
[1:07:21] right
[1:07:23] right no difference in it right
[1:07:25] right you're just using different words
[1:07:29] okay
[1:07:32] what you see in order to San Temptation
[1:07:35] you had to buy pasta theology you had to
[1:07:37] come down here in flesh to be tempted by
[1:07:39] sin and then if you stand all the father
[1:07:42] has given me will come to me and I'll
[1:07:43] raise him up in their last days
[1:07:45] see you had to be first it had to be
[1:07:48] something first all right and then you
[1:07:50] see you come right down the regular line
[1:07:52] from attribute for the foundation of the
[1:07:55] world his name is put on the last book
[1:07:57] of life then from that he become the
[1:07:59] word the theophany that could appear
[1:08:02] disappear
[1:08:03] and then he become flesh and return back
[1:08:06] again
[1:08:07] who's that speaking of Jesus Christ
[1:08:09] resurrected that same body in a
[1:08:12] glorified condition
[1:08:13] well you bypass the theophany become a
[1:08:16] flesh man to be tempted by sin and then
[1:08:19] if it's Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved
[1:08:20] we have one already waiting
[1:08:25] you take it and answer it we have not
[1:08:27] yet the bodies
[1:08:28] go ahead
[1:08:29] I don't have no time to argue with you
[1:08:31] but I ain't gonna do it
[1:08:34] I'm going to try to do the best I can to
[1:08:35] preach
[1:08:38] and let that's the Holy Spirit
[1:08:40] speak to you
[1:08:45] let's read
[1:08:47] Brother Anderson would you pull back up
[1:08:51] second Corinthians
[1:08:53] 5.
[1:08:55] and let's read it
[1:08:58] read it with an understanding of one
[1:09:00] thing
[1:09:04] the prophet says
[1:09:06] we've just proved a point I hope you do
[1:09:09] you can see it
[1:09:10] your soul is your theophany if you're a
[1:09:13] sinner it's where you're going to it's
[1:09:16] your body you're going to your deity is
[1:09:18] Satan
[1:09:21] you're the body of your God
[1:09:24] because the often means the body of God
[1:09:27] but if you're born again you're going
[1:09:28] upward
[1:09:30] and you already started eternal life as
[1:09:32] I say and while ago when that prophet of
[1:09:34] God started talking about eternal life
[1:09:38] I listen and I ask questions
[1:09:41] when I was in the Baptist
[1:09:43] I wanted to know
[1:09:45] I could read
[1:09:47] I wanted to know
[1:09:49] they talked about a god up in heaven or
[1:09:51] over the sea and I could read it he's
[1:09:54] not up there
[1:09:55] I could read Moses saying I could read
[1:09:57] Paul saying that
[1:09:59] and I wanted to beat him
[1:10:02] I got a chance too when I was about 11
[1:10:04] years old
[1:10:05] did you see something that was a rarity
[1:10:07] to people but
[1:10:08] all right you don't have to believe me
[1:10:12] but from that day I wanted to find that
[1:10:14] God
[1:10:15] when brother random started talking
[1:10:19] the voice of the seventh angel
[1:10:22] when he began to talk about
[1:10:25] eternal life being here
[1:10:29] I said Lord
[1:10:31] that's what I saw
[1:10:36] he started talking about something that
[1:10:37] was real to me
[1:10:39] I didn't want to have to wonder whether
[1:10:41] I was going to be saved or not have to
[1:10:42] wait till the Judgment Day
[1:10:46] for it to be figured out
[1:10:48] I wanted to know here
[1:10:51] I still want to know
[1:10:53] I want to know if I'm right because if
[1:10:55] I'm wrong
[1:10:56] and I'll admit it I can be halved all
[1:10:59] right
[1:11:03] you see I'm always wondered about God
[1:11:06] and how real he is
[1:11:10] talked with him before I had
[1:11:12] a chance of receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:11:14] I could feel his presence so much with
[1:11:16] me
[1:11:18] until I turned around hard for it
[1:11:23] more real than you are
[1:11:28] I don't talk about something I don't
[1:11:30] know
[1:11:31] but I don't try to make you build on
[1:11:33] what I am it won't do a thing to you
[1:11:35] except one thing you can say well God
[1:11:37] did deal with a man
[1:11:39] and he can deal with me too
[1:11:41] because if you don't believe it that way
[1:11:43] you don't know what it is but let's read
[1:11:44] second Corinthians but read it with the
[1:11:47] understanding are you listening
[1:11:50] you understand it then when brother says
[1:11:52] it's up there it's up there
[1:11:55] but when he says this down here it's
[1:11:57] down here
[1:12:00] if you don't have eternal life down here
[1:12:02] and then have eternal life up there
[1:12:07] but you have a
[1:12:09] partial realization
[1:12:11] I know you don't like the word negative
[1:12:13] run around and use it he said you have a
[1:12:15] negative to positive
[1:12:18] you don't like that so we use it as well
[1:12:20] he said partial realization
[1:12:23] you remember the earnest
[1:12:25] of your inheritance we were on the other
[1:12:27] night
[1:12:28] the new birth is the earnest of your
[1:12:30] inheritance
[1:12:31] well you know what that means there's
[1:12:33] more to come
[1:12:34] so these virtual knowledge tempers
[1:12:36] facing God Holy Spirit love
[1:12:40] pulling us
[1:12:42] so in God's mind this thing's already
[1:12:45] over
[1:12:46] so when he writes
[1:12:49] and his Prophet interprets
[1:12:51] his Prophet sees it exactly
[1:12:55] as God sees it
[1:12:59] you realize that he stood one day and
[1:13:03] looked and saw the bride
[1:13:07] right
[1:13:09] perfect
[1:13:11] already redeemed
[1:13:13] already finished
[1:13:16] right
[1:13:18] but you know what we're still struggling
[1:13:21] right
[1:13:23] so now with the idea that he's right
[1:13:26] your soul is your theophany
[1:13:28] because that's the body you're living in
[1:13:30] your soul that goes to hell if you die
[1:13:32] if you're not born again it goes under
[1:13:35] the altar
[1:13:36] I'm sold under the altar if you're born
[1:13:38] again
[1:13:41] so the nature of your soul is God if
[1:13:43] you're born again if not it's of the
[1:13:44] world
[1:13:46] is carrying us one way or the other so
[1:13:48] let's just read
[1:13:50] simply read
[1:13:53] the scripture
[1:13:56] for we know that means we have a great
[1:13:59] understanding
[1:14:00] that if question number one
[1:14:04] our Earthly House of this Tabernacle
[1:14:07] were
[1:14:09] past tense
[1:14:13] dissolved
[1:14:15] past tense
[1:14:18] we have a building of God
[1:14:22] already
[1:14:25] and house not made with hands
[1:14:28] Eternal in the heavens
[1:14:30] now we're not talking about a house
[1:14:32] right rooms and you know living room
[1:14:36] bedroom dining room bathroom he ain't
[1:14:38] talking about that kind of house he said
[1:14:40] in my father's house
[1:14:42] or many mansions
[1:14:49] in my father's kingdom are many palaces
[1:14:53] watch now for in this we groan we've
[1:14:58] done got the earnest of our inheritance
[1:15:01] right the new birth
[1:15:04] Desiring Earnest We Grown earnestly
[1:15:07] Desiring to be clothed upon with our
[1:15:10] house which is from heaven
[1:15:13] I love the rest of these scriptures
[1:15:14] whether you do or not
[1:15:17] if so be that being clothed
[1:15:21] we shall not be found naked
[1:15:24] now that's not talking about nudity
[1:15:29] right
[1:15:31] odd that Adam and Eve were naked and
[1:15:35] didn't know it but that's not talking
[1:15:37] about nudity
[1:15:40] that's talking about being clothed upon
[1:15:44] with a house which is from heaven
[1:15:48] right right
[1:15:51] a theophany
[1:15:55] what does the Omni look like
[1:16:01] and brother Brandon went beyond the
[1:16:02] curtain of time
[1:16:08] one he recognized his first girlfriend
[1:16:10] he had
[1:16:12] maybe he did
[1:16:16] one he recognized his first wife
[1:16:21] amen
[1:16:23] she called him brother
[1:16:28] he didn't have any trouble knowing who
[1:16:29] she was
[1:16:31] why
[1:16:36] how was she
[1:16:40] 18 20 year old long black hair probably
[1:16:43] when she died she was gray-headed I
[1:16:45] don't know about his first wife I know
[1:16:47] his second wife was but
[1:16:52] 18 20 year old
[1:16:57] you know what it looked like
[1:16:59] hope didn't look like
[1:17:01] no what's her name one of the Hope
[1:17:03] doesn't
[1:17:04] hope didn't look like media and media
[1:17:06] didn't look like hope
[1:17:08] you know what
[1:17:10] baby came by and he's one of her was
[1:17:12] talking to him said do you know
[1:17:15] the reason she's so happy
[1:17:18] since she was 90 years old but he looked
[1:17:20] at her nah hey Granny all wrinkled you
[1:17:24] need to be ironed
[1:17:27] no
[1:17:28] he didn't see that that's right he saw
[1:17:31] 18 20 year old girl
[1:17:33] so she was 90 years old when she was
[1:17:36] converted amen that was her soul
[1:17:40] have you ever heard the prophet say it
[1:17:42] this way
[1:17:44] he said
[1:17:46] when you reach a certain age
[1:17:48] he said God takes a picture
[1:17:52] right
[1:17:54] he said Satan come on take them I said
[1:17:57] you can't take the life I'm quoting if
[1:17:58] you'd like it
[1:18:00] you can't take the life
[1:18:03] he had the picture what you look like
[1:18:07] but you know what I love we're gonna get
[1:18:09] back to predestination
[1:18:10] you know he made a picture before the
[1:18:12] foundation of the world
[1:18:15] that's what he's saying
[1:18:19] so brother Connie the one that before
[1:18:21] the foundation world
[1:18:25] and do you think you're going to look
[1:18:27] any different when you get here no it
[1:18:29] was 18 20 years old you're going to look
[1:18:31] just like that was back there amen
[1:18:34] right
[1:18:36] well because you're the same person
[1:18:38] amen
[1:18:40] just over into a human flesh
[1:18:44] I'm not going to look like brother dick
[1:18:46] and he's not going to look like me
[1:18:53] do you understand I'm talking about
[1:18:54] something real
[1:18:56] why do you think we got the pictures
[1:18:58] downstairs
[1:19:00] on the wall are the ones that's passed
[1:19:02] on I told him I said I want pictures of
[1:19:04] them 18 20 year old
[1:19:06] brother Sarah this morning you stand out
[1:19:09] looking at that Wednesday night I said
[1:19:10] brother that's a great story there
[1:19:12] I said those are people that have passed
[1:19:14] on that went to this church you know her
[1:19:16] loved ones close I said I want to know
[1:19:19] what you look like
[1:19:23] I want to know what you look like
[1:19:25] brother moat was like me he was already
[1:19:28] kind of got just a little bit you know
[1:19:30] and he got a little higher when I first
[1:19:32] met him not 56.
[1:19:36] but
[1:19:39] no 66 excuse me I'll get it right 60
[1:19:42] something
[1:19:44] you see he'd already passed on beyond
[1:19:46] what God took a picture
[1:19:50] yeah we got them down there because we
[1:19:52] want to see them
[1:19:53] and when they walk in
[1:19:56] you don't have to be wondering
[1:20:01] oh
[1:20:05] sister Ruth
[1:20:09] she was real sick right at the last
[1:20:12] laying up in bed at home
[1:20:16] me and my wife went down to see her
[1:20:20] and we talked and we sat there and you
[1:20:22] know had a good time
[1:20:25] I looked over at my wife with a Carly I
[1:20:27] said look at her
[1:20:32] it might have been her eyes I don't know
[1:20:34] I ain't worried about it
[1:20:36] but our light a young woman
[1:20:39] not a sickly workly person
[1:20:43] at any age or you know burdens of
[1:20:46] anything
[1:20:47] she looked like she was about 20 years
[1:20:49] old
[1:20:55] baby God just let us see that a little
[1:20:57] bit ahead you know
[1:21:02] listen folks
[1:21:05] when we get Beyond a curtain of time as
[1:21:07] we pass on before it'll be our soul that
[1:21:10] goes there
[1:21:12] in one day 18 20 year old man come
[1:21:15] walking down through the aisles here
[1:21:19] but you know what
[1:21:21] if you're not into Brides you're not
[1:21:22] going to know that
[1:21:24] amen and somebody that says like sister
[1:21:26] Gayle said well there's brother Dale
[1:21:28] somebody over in a you know somebody
[1:21:30] else's they get the straight jacket I
[1:21:32] think we need to get her in a Nut House
[1:21:35] because they won't see it
[1:21:38] right
[1:21:39] don't tell me everybody's going to see
[1:21:40] it
[1:21:44] it's odd that brother random always
[1:21:45] referred to confis
[1:21:51] was that my right the Caiaphas was the
[1:21:53] one that said
[1:21:55] and Abraham and Sarah said we better get
[1:21:57] out of here they might be we've been
[1:21:58] recognized
[1:22:02] how did Caiaphas know what Abraham and
[1:22:04] Sarah looked like
[1:22:06] come on get off of it
[1:22:13] it's kind of odd he used him
[1:22:15] kind of odd is this morning that he was
[1:22:18] the high priest
[1:22:21] under the anointing
[1:22:25] that he could see things other people
[1:22:27] couldn't see
[1:22:29] kind of odd isn't it
[1:22:31] but is it odd folks
[1:22:35] but look
[1:22:38] not trying to get clothes on
[1:22:41] clothes with our house
[1:22:47] if you take it and I went down to preach
[1:22:49] on it because it's 40 years ago
[1:22:51] where it says in My Father's House were
[1:22:53] many mansions
[1:22:54] there are many theophonies
[1:22:58] why not be one when we get through one
[1:23:01] of these days get back to Genesis 1 26
[1:23:02] and 27 but many theophanes but then
[1:23:05] Jesus turned around and said I go to
[1:23:08] prepare place for you
[1:23:10] brother Brian said we have nothing to do
[1:23:12] at least in future homes the other day
[1:23:14] we have nothing to do with the building
[1:23:16] of the future home
[1:23:18] there won't be no planting and doing
[1:23:20] this and doing that and one raise up
[1:23:22] another he said won't be there he said
[1:23:24] Jesus is doing every bit of it
[1:23:26] yep I like that song
[1:23:29] I'm sending up boards for my mansion in
[1:23:32] the sky
[1:23:34] I know it's a carnal story for them but
[1:23:36] it's not for me I'm sending up boards
[1:23:40] for my mansion in the sky
[1:23:43] because I'm going to need all of these
[1:23:45] virtues when I get there
[1:23:48] I hope you understand
[1:23:51] listen
[1:23:56] just think about it
[1:23:58] for we that are in this Tabernacle do
[1:24:01] groan
[1:24:02] being burdened
[1:24:03] just an Earnest of it
[1:24:06] for not for that we would be unclothed
[1:24:11] but closed upon what that mortality
[1:24:14] might be swallowed up of life
[1:24:16] now he's telling you what kind of
[1:24:17] clothes you're putting on
[1:24:20] what does it matter in eternity whether
[1:24:22] we have clothes or not
[1:24:25] we will
[1:24:28] because there will be others around
[1:24:32] but what does it matter
[1:24:34] Adam and Eve didn't know this naked
[1:24:37] that was the thing God said who told you
[1:24:39] he was naked
[1:24:42] me
[1:24:43] you take away all of this carnality of
[1:24:45] our minds and you don't have to worry
[1:24:47] about nudity
[1:24:54] gonna be a lot of weight loss come that
[1:24:56] time won't you
[1:24:59] I love that
[1:25:03] man you've seen me 18 20 years old it
[1:25:06] was just a rare pictures of me anyway I
[1:25:08] don't have a lot because I don't do too
[1:25:09] good in photographs
[1:25:11] in order to see me I'm going to stand in
[1:25:12] there with that old flat top haircut and
[1:25:14] no shirt on man hanging the baby clothes
[1:25:18] on the wash line
[1:25:21] we used to have door stoppers
[1:25:24] okay
[1:25:26] the church listen
[1:25:29] if this early Tabernacle be dissolved
[1:25:32] the second is dissolved
[1:25:36] I'm a soldier under the altar
[1:25:38] you know what I'm doing I'm saying how
[1:25:40] long
[1:25:43] really I'm saying church at Lula come on
[1:25:46] I've tried to teach it to me do you
[1:25:49] come on get in the word and get me back
[1:25:51] where I'm supposed to be because I won't
[1:25:53] be happy to be there even though that
[1:25:55] would be a great eternity of bliss of
[1:25:57] beauty and everything
[1:25:59] but yet those people that are wanting to
[1:26:01] come back here
[1:26:04] why because we're people
[1:26:08] and even though our body is not the real
[1:26:10] part of us that God is working on
[1:26:12] it is the part that he placed us in
[1:26:15] as I said
[1:26:16] he's not going to have any extra souls
[1:26:19] and nobodies
[1:26:20] you're not gonna have extra bodies and
[1:26:22] no souls he knows exactly what he's
[1:26:24] doing
[1:26:26] see I believe your soul then is your
[1:26:28] theophany
[1:26:30] in the basis that is is going to take
[1:26:32] you somewhere
[1:26:34] if it's a sinner it's going to take you
[1:26:35] down if it's a Christian it's going to
[1:26:37] go up right
[1:26:42] but we already have it here
[1:26:45] and there's the key you listen for a
[1:26:47] second please
[1:26:50] we talked about going to heaven
[1:26:53] we talked about all that would be in the
[1:26:55] great Mind by
[1:26:57] happy hunting grounds all the things
[1:27:00] But Here Come a prophet talking about
[1:27:03] eternal life here
[1:27:06] he said we already have
[1:27:09] eternal life
[1:27:14] and that was a day or two for a car run
[1:27:17] into it and killed him
[1:27:22] we already have it
[1:27:24] as far as God is concerned is over with
[1:27:27] but as far as you and I are concerned it
[1:27:30] ain't over here yet
[1:27:32] but it will be
[1:27:36] he said but I've always thought a
[1:27:38] theophany would become kind of a
[1:27:39] Heavenly it he is
[1:27:43] but a sinner has a place to go to
[1:27:46] which is his soul
[1:27:49] it will live on until a Judgment Day
[1:27:52] but a Christian has a place to go to and
[1:27:55] that's his soul
[1:27:56] and that'll live on until one day we'll
[1:27:59] return to these bodies
[1:28:02] and when we return to these bodies there
[1:28:04] ain't going to be no devil just try to
[1:28:07] stop us
[1:28:10] he can't fool with a little bride right
[1:28:15] your soul then is your theophany
[1:28:18] please go home and think about it don't
[1:28:20] just cut it off as saying but always
[1:28:22] bleed my Souls up in heaven I mean my
[1:28:24] theophthany's up in heaven
[1:28:26] I just went through an hour and a half
[1:28:28] telling you that's right
[1:28:34] because it's the positive of God's mind
[1:28:37] that's pulling us
[1:28:40] I'll give you a split second just to
[1:28:42] look at it was a man stood on this Earth
[1:28:45] one time
[1:28:47] his name was Jesus
[1:28:51] it was God Almighty and flesh
[1:28:56] you agree
[1:28:58] one day Matthew 17 I guess it is
[1:29:02] he went up on the mountain
[1:29:06] and he was transfigured
[1:29:12] the almighty God out of heaven
[1:29:14] spoke and said this is my son
[1:29:18] the police to dwell in
[1:29:20] here are you him
[1:29:23] he was shown brother Branham said
[1:29:26] his second coming
[1:29:29] Matthew 27 5 27 in there where it talks
[1:29:33] about
[1:29:34] that's literally taking you to
[1:29:37] but around uses it for here ye him
[1:29:40] when he said I know to you theologians
[1:29:43] and things this is the scripture
[1:29:45] speaking of his second coming in his
[1:29:48] second coming would be Moses and Elijah
[1:29:51] and Jesus to the Jews
[1:29:55] but he said it's prefigured
[1:29:57] here
[1:29:59] when God sees anything it's already
[1:30:01] finished
[1:30:04] he said I will put enmity between thy
[1:30:08] seed and the seed of the woman
[1:30:12] I've already done it

[1:30:43] right and you know to prove it he's got
[1:30:44] to put us through the test
[1:30:47] right
[1:30:48] the only way we prove to Satan is for
[1:30:53] him to be able to challenge us
