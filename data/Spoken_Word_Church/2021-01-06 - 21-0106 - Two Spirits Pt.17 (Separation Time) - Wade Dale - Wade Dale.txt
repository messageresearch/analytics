here we've got up early this morning from illinois and made it on back didn't have any traffic at all didn't hit anything nothing hit us so we did good some lord provided us with a big old fat doe while we was up there so we had a good time june got to go with me and toby so we we had a good time so good to be back and uh good to be down here in the south in god's country amen so if you got your bibles let's turn to first john four tonight we're going to end this with um on two spirits um this will be part 17 and it will be titled the end our separation time as terence has already announced we'll have our regular two services sunday sorry i wasn't here this sunday the first time the united united states postal service ever asked me to work on sunday well they didn't ask they told me i needed to so uh but we got all that over with since all this election stuff's over and done with so we will uh hopefully not be able to do that anymore so between services you've got your marching orders from from the deacon there so we know what we're doing in between services we are going to get to some kind of normal right we are well we're not normal people but we're going to get some kind of normal amen i miss bible study and i miss a sunday school class too so i miss all those other things that we do but i hope you're still studying i hope you're still praying hope you're still reading your bible i hope you're still reading the prophet's message listen to the prophet i hope he's still doing those things that that's not coveted related should have been doing that to begin with amen so first john four verse one uh we don't have any other announcements we we're at least back to that much of normal where we don't have 25 announcements to make so uh uh brother dale and i'll be doing sunday service lord willing and uh try to get back to some sort of normalcy so first john four before we get started i was back there talking to brother joe and and we know this uh this coveted thing is in places getting worse and i know where several um message ministers this week have passed away from the disease and or the virus whatever you want to call it and then a couple other we've lost four ministers this week from different things besides covet but some of it was covered related some of them we knew some of them we did not know but we need to keep everybody in our prayers there's a brother james west i know some of you that that go to brother matthew braves with us every once in a while he was a dear friend of ours and just a a huggy bear of a guy you know really nice gentleman he passed away today now i don't know if it was covered related or not but but he passed away today too so just keep everybody in your prayers we we're going to win this thing we will win don't worry we'll win doesn't matter what signs look like remember signs follow believers we've got to be believers first we become believers first and then the signs will follow us not bad signs that's what we're going to talk about tonight this thing got so intertwined until the devil got a little bit complacent but in the end time guess what's going to happen it's going to get separated there's going to be a book that's not closed anymore it's going to separate and when it's separated when the seals opened it showed who the devil was where he was at and what he was doing but it also showed where jesus christ was and what he was doing and who he was doing it through hey man i enjoyed all the preaching back last weekend brother um brother whitley did a good job too because that's this thing's got to come from the bride it's not going to come from anybody else it's not going to come from nominal people it's not going to come from even good foolish virgins that's not where the call is coming from the calls coming from the bride that's it and i didn't i didn't make this plan god did all right we just got to decide to be in the plan jim was reading me something uh today about uh a digging a hole was it god what was it god was afraid yeah don't be leaning on the shovel and pray for a hole and expect for god to just give you a hold i've always told you if you're looking for a job don't sit on your couch with a coca-cola in your hand with your feet up on the couch and say god send me somebody and knock on the door give me a job no say something you got to do there's something you need to do you need listen the prophet of god even paul said press your way right i press toward the goal now how many of us are really pressing because pressing causes pressure i believe we're trying to we're fixing to make the devil real mad because he's not going to know how to handle us when we get toward this end time right as we're talking about here tonight when those seals open brother brown said we've got satan's answer right amen what's the answer we know where he's at what he's doing what his tactics are and what is going to happen at the end amen amen so first john 4 because listen how many people have you ever talked to that knows exactly how the end time is going to end up they don't know that's right jesus is coming soon he's coming down out of the eastern sky he's coming in this he's coming on that he's coming this he's the pope he's coming this way he's coming that way he's not coming for another 50 years he's coming tomorrow he's coming yes you understand what i mean but you and i will know right surely we know where he's at surely we know where he's at so we ought to know what he's fixing to start doing like i said before we may not know what's going to go on this year but that holy ghost inside of you knows your journey all the way to the very end so let's start listening to that thing inside of us listen to that still small voice and he'll tell us what to do to get us out here because he promised he would he promised he'd never leave us never forsake us amen so let's bow our heads the only father thank you for this evening that we have to worship you one more time in spirit and truth lord gathering the bride together lord in this building father and without you here it's just a meeting the lord i pray that you'll come and anoint our lips lord move us aside you take over be the active participant in this service but also lord you're the only one that can reveal and as we're going to read here a few minutes what we we live for revelation and it only can come from you lord we pray that you'd give us revelation more and more this year than we've ever had before that you'll give us prophetic insight into the things that are coming to this world lord and know that there's a separation time that we're truly we are separated from this world as far as the worldly pleasures of the world but lord we still have to live here but there's going to come a time where we're going to have to make a decision even as the 68 million martyrs in the dark ages made a decision lord they walked into those arenas to death in the body well we're going to have to die out lord to ourself and then the world is going to persecute us and prosecute us but lord you said that we would overcome all right so we trust in what you're saying lord we believe what you're saying we believe you're you've already said it already done it so now let's walk into it father forgive us of our sins thank you for the time we've had lord we pray that you give us more of that in jesus name we pray amen let's have a good time in the lord amen beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits for the layer of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh it's not of god because they'll they'll they'll say well yeah we we got the holy ghost but we can't control our flesh we got the holy ghost but you're a sinner and i'm a sinner we're we're just all nobody's perfect uh that's not what my bible says amen and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist now there's your spirit of antichrist it's that jesus christ has not come in the flesh but remember he's hidden and revealed in you as brother william will say he's hidden and revealed in you that's one of the great mysteries to me that is the great mystery but it took a profit to come in the end time and say now i call you bride i have brought eliezer has brought isaac and rebecca together and he stepped out of the way and let isaac and rebecca consummate the marriage amen so that's what we're looking at now the consummation of this whole thing because we're going to a wedding supper year of god wait a minute this is that spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard about it come now we've heard about it the world has their idea who the antichrist is just punch in antichrist sometime and just read about who they think the antichrist is it's everybody but who we know it is but you know who that's telling feeding them that information it's not god because the bible says as i read you last week that he will let you believe a lie and be damned by him he'll let you god will let you believe lie because he knows you'll not believe anything else because you're an unbeliever all right so this is that spirit of antichrist and even now already is in the world year of god little children have overcome them because greater heed us in you than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god well that's pretty see now that separates like brother brown said even back during the segregation time he he probably ruffled a few feathers he said god's a segregationist and everybody's like whoa we know we didn't no god is a segregationist he has always said do not go over here and do that with this group of people told israel do not go to the world telling us not to mingle with the world he even tells us not to mingle with somebody with false doctrine right right oh my goodness they went out from us because they wasn't of us amen we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we now look how positive that is hereby know we this is john the revelator that went to the isle of patmos and saw all the church ages saw all the the the woman on the white on the red dragon and you saw the woman in the sun and he saw all these great mysteries and he comes back and he says i've seen it i may not complace it all but i've seen that that there's this woman sitting on a scarlet beast that's got a a vial full of full of blood of the martyrs of the saints i know there's something going to happen in the end time there's going to be a separation time all right we are of god he that knoweth here he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god here if not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error how positive that is you may be seated and i'm going to continue on i read went back and read first john again and i picked up a good little nugget right here let's go to first john 5 verse 18. look how positive john is we know not we think we think this is not no we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not whoa that's a mouthful but he knew and he saw you know what that's the same guy that wrote over there in revelations that she will be without spot and without wrinkle a bride that will be in revelations 19 adorned in white raiment no sin at all but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself not that he that's begotten of mama and daddy he that's begotten of what the mother and father the new jerusalem the ones that are born from above he that is begotten of god keepeth himself now watch and that wicked one toucheth him not right you say oh my the devil just touches me every day yeah he does but it should have no effect on you resist the devil and he'll flee from you but right here he says that wicked one toucheth him not and we know that well here we go again and we know that we're of god do you know that today amen do you know that you come from god and you're going back to god do you know that you've been born again amen do we know that we are and we know that we are of god and the whole world life in wickedness wow because listen if you're not born again today you're dead you're lost you're in the world you're of the world you say no i'm in a message church that's the worst if you're not born again that's the worst place to be right and we know that the son of god has come and hath given us what that's what i want to key on today an understanding you can only separate something if you have an understanding of both spirits amen because you got to be one or the other can't be in between one or the other that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true so what does that make you true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god there's a false one but this is the true one and eternal life everybody got that say amen to me that's a powerful powerful we know john said we know we know where it's coming from we know that whosoever is born of god sentence not number one let's keep reading this again as brother william read it the other night or brother bob read it sunday now remember this christ in the true church remember there's a false one it's a continuation of the book of acts that's why we baptize the name lord jesus christ that's why you saw brother branham you saw on the screen there how he he gives the prescription dr paul i mean dr peter stood up on the day of pentecost and gave you the prescription amen and it hadn't changed since man changed it when that vine started intertwining man changed it but not in the first church age he didn't amen but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his words the attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he's cast in the lake of fire now that's his division there he's going to be kept and that's what i want to talk about today the two spirits have got to be divided somewhere down the line because this side is going to be tears and this side's going to be wheat there's no in between these are going to be burnt and send into torment these are going to go into eternal life now that's just the way it is i didn't make the plan but we're going to read here in matthew 13 when jesus said that there was a sower went out to sow and then there was a one so tares and he said you just let them all grow up see he had to wait till this last church age before he could separate them it was so intermingled down through the denominations and down through the other six church ages there had to come something in the end time to separate them and say this is that and this is that this is tears and this is wheat because as i've said before if you get a garden when that thing first comes out of the ground everything looks like corn everything looks like a bean but let it grow on up a little bit further and you'll see the cocoa bird start or you'll see the morning glory start or you it will be what it will expose itself all you gotta do is let it grow it will expose itself and that's what's happening now but what it exposes satan now when brother branham says it now i know he's talking about the word but that it is you tonight i want you to understand he's talking it will only it will necklace it will not come through one preacher that's done all right brother branham come leads are come he said here i call you bride i introduce you to christ the veil has been rent right have we not heard that before the veil's been rent come boldly to the throne of grace isaac and rebecca married under eleazar's teaching because he told rebecca so much about ellie about uh isaac until she didn't have to ask 25 different people in that field who isaac was eliezer had told her the very characteristic and listen there was no facebook there was no uh instagram there was no um with snapchat he did it by word he explained isaac so plain to rebecca to when she lit off that camel she went running to the first person she saw because she knew that's who that was and that's what the prophet of god did in the end time he did he did not introduce us to three different isaacs he didn't introduce us to isaac and his helper he didn't introduce us to isaac and his horsemen he introduced us to isaac he told us about isaac and he knew that we would go to the right person which is who jesus christ so it exposes satan revealing his word now keep going in the red he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater words not just she can see it she can do the greater work she will be an invincible invincible army if they get a true revelation they you nobody else is going to get a true revelation that's why i'm telling you revelations 10 7 has come so real to me glory we have read it and read it and it's one of our themes right it's one of them we get on our belt buckle yeah but do you really know what that thing's saying right in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when it begins to sound the mystery of god one mystery will be finished what is the mystery of god you and me you and me are the mystery that satan won't be able to handle he's got all that other remember the prophet of god said we he now have satan's answer don't let him beat you up we have it we have the answer to keep him separated from us amen she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church the intertwining and by god's spirit deserve to withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be what powerless now what does satan want to do he wants to kill you he'll soon see you physically dead doesn't matter about your soul he wants you dead he wants you out of the way so you don't do him any more harm and you don't stand in his way so you don't know we're coming down the road today you don't know how many times within seconds you could have had a wreck within minutes you could have been run over and all these different things going on and here's those angels sitting on top of your car and they're going move back but you know what though they're not just angels out there there's demons out there and if we could see the fight that goes on around us we would be astonished at what god is doing for us just by us living and breathing every day of our life because look at those four ministers they're gone off the scene sure they're bright sure there but but they're not preaching that you understand what i mean they're not furthering the gospel anymore right but here we are and we're still alive and we better do it this year we better preach the hardest we've ever preached we better you better dig the hardest you've ever done because you know what we're at least one year closer to the coming of the lord amen at least one year closer whatever he does when he does come we're one day one year closer to the coming of the lord so now let's go i know the next thing says what is truth but we got to go back into eden because eden is where this thing intertwined together and all the false doctrines began where in genesis prophet of god tells us you had nimrod you well you had cain and abel for one thing you had the serpent and adam the whole world the whole world is deceived in the book of genesis genesis 1 26 they think that's just man that's not just man that's the bride of jesus christ that's that's god's children that came into being at that point then you see that the world has now been taught that it was an apple that evade they're deceived right there in the beginning and don't you think it gets any better it gets worse as you go through because as god is hiding himself in simplicity so is the devil and they're intertwining or the the seed has been sown remember the two seeds started in the two trees in genesis and i read you the quote where they're planted in the same earth right they get the same rain right but they've intertwined so much until you can't hardly tell the difference oh my that's close yes sir it's close and it's going to get closer but there will come folks a separation time there will come a time when it's like i said before many times it if the if the nominal church which brother brown i read you a quote talking about them going into that world council of churches and going into that federation we see now as we see this political thing playing out we see now more how that there's going to be a group over here and there's going to be a group over here and it's going to be a group over here and this group is going to push their will on this group over here and brother brown says that if you don't watch it you're going to get caught in it right you'll get caught in that thing and can't get out why because they're going to close little church down but if you'll just don't don't talk don't don't mention that brandon man's name that just it just you know what it does it stirs the devil up but but you know then mo some preachers are going to go well because brother brown said to in other words to save face in other words to have being able to have church service we'll just go along with it that's compromising folks we're not going to do that amen abel didn't compromise with cain that's what killed abel right abel stood there and said this is what god said cain said no come on it's got to be the fruit it made him so mad he killed abel because abel stood on what he believed so did 68 million christians die at the hands of christians they said you don't believe this certain doctrine right here then we're going to kill you isn't that getting familiar and like brother brown said it's not so much as now killing physically killing but killing a person's influence kills the person amen we've seen that happen many many times but from the first age to now or even and going through nicea this thing is intertwined so much until like i said before and you bring it up here says when i preached on what is truth i looked on the internet and there's 30 000 worldwide christian organizations christian not these offshoots of demons and all the uh anti-christ and all this stuff there's 30 000 worldwide christian organizations there's 1200 different ones just in our 50 states 1200 different ways they see what god is and what he's doing oh yeah that's why brother branham said the true church one church and there's got to be one folks there's got to be a true church what is truth truth came to us by the opening of those seven seals first part of the ministry brother brown i'm sure he threw in all the different doctrines that they had fell from you heard him there pentecostal y'all went you know you let your women cut your hair you let your women preach or let your women do this he was telling him but when it come to the opening of those seals he said thousands of people will leave me thousands of my friends because see that was a defining moment i believe when christ and satan met each other now listen brother branham wasn't christ but he had christ in him and he had a job to do for christ but so did the denominational world because when he stepped out and said this is my revelation of these seven seals my revelation all the different ones we were talking to brother bob's house you know you got clarence larkin and all the ones they hit and missed but this man brought a full seven course message clarence larkin was a trinitarian so you can and forgive me he's a christian and i believe he made it he had some good teachings but you mark him off as being a true prophet of god everybody like sankey finney calvin you can name all that they had certain parts that they were but brother branham says one had to come to tie all the loose ends up because they had intertwined their self with trinitarianism so much and no in an eternal hell and mama's at the foot of jesus and you know and jesus is coming on a cloud and jesus is coming this way jesus is coming remember in 1917 they went up there on a uh went up there on the mountain or some campbell lights or whatever it was they figured out that's when jesus was coming but he was coming to them well that's been a long time ago all those other doctrines have been a long time ago we're here right now and like i said before the name of the this one is the end it's not just the end of the sermon it's the end of those two spirits one's going into perdition and one's going into glory there is no in between amen now sure i know there's people given eternal life you understand what i mean it's not it is cut and dry in god's mind but there are people going to be given eternal life for the different things you understand what i mean but they weren't true seed to begin with they were imparted eternal life they weren't part of that genesis 1 26 and 27 man amen has everybody got that even the foolish virgin is not part of that genesis 1 26 and 27 men the only people that came from god is his children the only three children my daddy has in this building there's plenty of them in this building he's only got three because they came from him right so same way with god when he stood there and said let us make man in our own image after our likeness let him have dominion over the fish's sea and foul of the air and all the living creatures he was not talking about the billions of people that was going to come on the earth he was talking about one group of people but that group of people is going to have to realize that she has a purpose just as god had a plan and a purpose guess who it was for right now it wasn't for god god's eternal god don't need nobody to exist right but he wants to work through you to prove to the devil that he can do it because the devil got in the garden of eden he said boy i really messed this plant up they're gonna have to look to me they're going to have to look to my intelligence to be able to survive remember those people that came from cain brother brown said they were they were workers of iron they built the tower of babel they were always in in pearl uh seth was sheep herders common farmers amen and the devil was going i'll build my kingdom down here well he's trying to build one but you know what he's trying to build it the wrong way if he would have got on god's side and stayed his right hand man he could have had part of the kingdom but that part of the kingdom is now mine and yours amen that's mine and yours not his he forfeited all that he's just a squatter he owns nothing this powerful thing we call the devil one day we're going to look at him the bible says there's some drunk on the side of the road dying in his own vomit and say is this the man that's right now up in washington dc that's right now over in belgium that's right now over all these different places ruling the world only temporary but are we temporary do we have a promise just to be temporary we have a promise to own this thing for an eternity it was made in the beginning for me and you wasn't me for the devil come on people you got to start realizing who you are if we don't we don't just keep getting brow beat by the devil all the time what is truth 1200 different things in the united states alone no one truth right right there's a spirit of truth and the spirit of error them twelve hundred i'm sorry those eleven hundred and ninety nine are error there's only one truth first john 4 verse 3 he says and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ is coming in the flesh is not of god this is one we read it first but i'm going to read it again but look that is that spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world so the antichrist spirit is here there is no doubt where it is it's right here it's not as the world says now see the world is looking and reading in revelations how the beast is going to rise up well is it going to be a horse is it going to be like dad said as my uncle used to think it would be this great big you know beast coming out of the out of the earth and well that's not going to deceive anybody that's a big beast and the whole world's gonna see it but he's gonna come in with flattery he's gonna come in and be real humble real calm see every time something rises up they'll go well that's antichrist the antichrist is doing this work the ant listen the antichrist is in them if they don't have jesus christ it's going to head up into one person we know that it's going to head up into one person one beast when we're out of here and we leave it's going to incarnate the pope and he's going to be the guy satan superman but until then he has an opposition that keeps that from happening and it's me and you thank you lord live so close to god satan won't know what to do with you wow see we got to start believing what's already been said about us we're not trying to develop a new revelation we're trying to believe the ones already said because we're not looking for a new bible i'm not looking for 10 new sermons from brother branham that they dig up out in arizona underneath a rock somewhere that's going to give us rapture and faith he said rapture and faith lies in these books and these tapes right here it's already here the book's open what are we looking for it's already here that's right opening of the book remember the book's been closed when the lamb took a book in revelation 5 it was closed but in revelation 10 7 the book was open and then he said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery that's been closed up in that book will be made open amen we got to keep going and keep going and keep going because look i and i was i was listening to brother branham the other day and because you got to remember and we we covered it in the saying deed doctrine incarnate antichrist justification sanctification baptism holy ghost and incarnate christ you got four combat beasts well now that's the first four seals once those four combat beasts are gone so are we right does everybody realize that the work is done when those combat beasts leave this earth we're going with them they've done their job they have overcome those therion beasts are those untameable beasts that's going to be left on the earth but where is it we're looking you're looking at it right i know people get up and say well who's your worst enemy get up and look in the mirror well you know what that's your best friend too he might be your worst enemy but that guy down inside of you don't belittle him brothers and sisters that's the eternal god and that's the one you need to look at and say god i'm going forward i may look horrible i may make 100 mistakes today but at the end of the day the devil's going to know i walked on this earth one more day how many of you can do that all you got to do is pray and read your bible pray read your bible talk about god to your neighbor maybe how simple is that but saying he started as a little saying it became a deed it became a doctrine and then it became an incarnate antichrist which we're seeing in the end time now is heading up to one person it's a system saying deed doctrine so they have taken the whole doctrine it has intertwined and god has winked at the ignorance of those people down through the church ages because what there is true vine but that false vine had intertwined with doctrine father son holy ghost baptism eternal hell novenians and all the different things hey there's going to be catholics in heaven sorry about that they're going to be real true catholics in heaven they may not be bribed but buddy i'm telling you in that third and fourth church age there might have been some of them in there because they listened to the message of the hour look at martin luther he was probably about 50 catholic brought about 50 of their doctrine but see that's the intertwining god winked at that folks but look there had to be a separation time come because god couldn't take a bride into a body change with that intertwining of that false listen there is no faults in god there is no false doctrine in god there is no false person in god it's all truth i am the way i am the truth and i am the life and where is that person that said that tonight he's inside of you saying the same thing you say oh you no brother branham you just took the place of god he said is that too far remember remember they said brother brother you just took the plate you've told them people to forgive their sins i listen folks the bible tells you says who's ever sins come on it's already in there it didn't take a profit he just vindicated it the bible tells you it says whoever sins you retain they're retained whoever sins you forgive yes they're forgiven that's what bible didn't take a prophet to come and write a new bible he was just showing you that it was already in there is that too far brother brown said them no i like that one where even the bible we don't quote this much but the bible says you lay hands on the sickness shall recover and if they have committed any sin it'll be forgiven boy come up here and get prayed for for a problem in your body and god just wipes the whole slate clean again wow you love the lord i'm telling you he has got to have a clean bride he's not going to marry somebody that's all messed up no he is not going to do that not in this end time now he may have took some of them and winked at their ignorance and all the different ones but remember he demands in this end time that we're born again he demands the truth in this end time whatever we got to do scratching claw the bible says he that overcometh right well i give these things to you not that he that slacketh to you that overcometh right right but there's your key god works with us the same way because you know what that's false doctrine right there but there is a true doctrine that you have to hear it you have to do it you have to become a part of it and then let that incarnate you just like the devil is doing the world because remember he can't be anything but a copycat satan cannot come up with an original anything right because he's not original he's a copycat but he can copy so close folks that's the difference he can copy so close so he can almost deceive the very elect according to the book of matthew and we'll read part of that in just a minute but let's go to uh ii thessalonians 2 let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and we see that happening now and that man of sin being what revealed the son of perdition right who opposes and exalteth himself now all that's at them denominations out there bro wait they just um judas was in the message judas went to camp meetings yeah judas preached at camp meeting oh boy can i get any closer right judas said and said amen wow how close is that that even makes me get a shiver a little bit but you know what there was only one person knew who he was that was the son of man that's why the son of man had to come back in the end time to know and tell you that satan's in not you but it's satan's in flesh today and i'm in flesh today because when brother brown called us bride he told us that's who we were the body of jesus christ that's who the true bride is the true bride is the body of her lover the true body of her husband to me you've got all these mysteries because even paul says you can know all mysteries and not have charity but brother branham gave us a way to get to the new birth not a new way same way as always because remember see that's got all convoluted i gotta shake a hand like i said before you know the baptist shake a hand now if you was nine years old and you come up and you gave your heart to god and we turned around to give you the right hand of fellowship then if you don't darken the doors and you have you know have a hound dog life that's okay because right here see that's false teaching that's giving somebody false hope and and all the other different like brother brown said he said where did you come up with sprinkling sprinkling ain't even in the bible baptizes in the bible so have they come up with that somebody finally must have said i don't think we need to put them in the water we just need to sprinkle water over top of them we don't need to baptize babies we just need to sprinkle them now we believe in dedicating babies right but we don't believe in putting them over the holy water and sprinkling holy water and they're already do you know what that to a catholic his sister anna canard was here tonight she'd tell you that baby has to go to that whatever they call that luis what is that you know what it's a little baby dedication where they sprinkle the water see that puts them in heaven that's their huh confirmation see you say well they're just taking the baby in this but no they're literally believing that that priest is putting the holy water on them right right right louis right and that they're they're not they that confirmation proves that they're going to go to heaven because they're now a confirmed catholic that's where their confirmation comes from now you know that's a lie but they believe the lie in our damn bible glory let no man deceive you by any means paul said for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposes and exalted himself above all that is called god or that is worship see listen folks here's the key satan cannot exalt himself i love this satan cannot exalt himself or his imps above you god won't allow it exactly god won't allow it he lost all that he lost that being the right hand man he lost that so he can't whatever you go through whatever problem whatever imp that god that satan sends you whatever demon satan sends you it's not any more powerful than you let it be because greater is heinous in you than heed us in the world there's a greater force yes at work here because listen he's not opposing and exalting himself to the world out there he's wanting you to worship him he's wanting you to worship him and we've done it for years but when god pulls us away satan hates that that's why brother ram said god god said satan turns every gun on you why because he's lost a good soldier he's lost a good guy you used to forward his kingdom some of you may not have but i sure did hello i thought the bible said confess your sacrificial sins one to the other i was a sinner okay but now once you come here though but remember i've always told like i said before i'm talking about one person sure i know i call catholic and i know i call baptist but but that's a system right that's a system i'm not one person that's a system they're under though but now remember though once you attach yourself to that system you're part of that system once you attach yourself to god like you did a year or so ago never can that be taken away but now you know what you satan you can attach yourself to different things and satan will go no i don't want you over here now i don't want you over here he'll bang you around like an eight ball right but god won't when god says you're my child he seals you until the day of your redemption amen who opposes and exalted himself above all that is called god or that is worship so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god remember you not that when i was yet with you now this is paul two thousand years ago i told you these things look and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time now you know paul said grievous wolves are coming in in other words new doctrine is going to show up nicea is going to show up all these false teachers constantine and all these different ones corinthians and all the different ones just brings doctrine in and even the denominational people the doctrine not the person the doctrine you know what i believe it's just me joseph smith started the baptist church right isn't that right joseph smith started the baptist church i believe he'll be in heaven right because he started a move of god but what happened was the people got a hold of it and said this is it and god moved on right same way with all the different ones because brother brown names them all i mean he'll name them that's why people talk about billy graham and oral roberts in the message being lost ain't they not lost they had the they had the new birth for their time because brother branham had nobody else i wish oh i wish that billy graham and oral roberts would have heard him one time say a modern billy graham and oral roberts just like the two witnesses that were with that were with melchizedek and they were sent to sodom to blind the people's eyes what would you think they'd think oh no not me i'm just i just preached to the world but they did that's exactly what they did they were identified in the word how much more can me and you be identified in the word of god amen so that's like i said before let's not disclude anybody but let's let's disclude systems systems of false doctrine that we now know because look if you're faced with a doctrine and it's the truth and you turn it down that's iniquity that's why the mystery of iniquity we'll read it here in just a minute right now pull it back up and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time because the first church age wasn't his time look for the mystery of iniquity does already work only he who now letteth will let now brother branham take a prophet only he god who now letteth will lead until he the bride be taken out of the way right so there we are the mystery of iniquity does already work and god's going to let it work until this end time where the separation time comes because listen if you're not born again you're part of that mystery of iniquity right right that's what your system is giving you is false doctrine even though you may show them the bible where where peter said repent be baptized the name of jesus christ they turn it down that's iniquity but now remember they call you false and them true right right they call you false and them true that ain't happening right you're the truth glory but what's that that's iniquity when you read it to them and show it to them and they turn it down iniquity is knowing to do right and not doing it right or doing something wrong knowing you're supposed to do it right how many preachers in brother brown's time how many of those 300 preachers in chicago oh brother branham we're coming down there to be baptized get the pool ready we'll be down there and not one of them showed up they went into that mystery of iniquity right to they heard the message they heard the word and they turned it down why because to save face to save a denomination to save their church to save some organization right they just went right on had churches and had church and they didn't all quit preaching they stayed right there in that system see that's where that intertwining was so strong nobody could pull that apart except brother bradham the spirit of god threw a prophet in the end time a word prophet to pull that thing apart to pull that book open you amen if you want to i'll lay a minute so let's read number two next position of the church ages now to get the real meaning of what we're about to go into i must caution you look at this to ever keep in mind that religion spiritual matters if you like is composed of two parts that intertwine but are opposite as black and white religion and the spiritual world are made up are made of these two trees which had their roots in eden both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt their very branches intertwined each other thus in the ephesian church age is that same paradox the church is made up of good and the church the church is made up of good and bad two vines make the church whoa they are like the wheat and tares growing up side by side but one is true the other is false now god will speak to each one and he will talk about each one he will call them the church but now look at this special group of people and only the elect will really know which is the true spirit only the elect will not be deceived wow because he continues on in matthew 24 24 for there shall arise false christ and false prophets show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they deceived the very lack look so way back there in the early church very short period after pentecost the false vine got to intertwine itself around the true vine to find these deeds of the nicolaitans we don't spoke about them brother brown brings that up in the first four seals and that spirit is going to be found fighting the true vine until it is destroyed by god and it's going to be destroyed the bible says by what the brightness of his coming now from the eastern sky he's going to walk down this big ball of light no it's going to be revealed in you you're the mystery remember you are that person now have you got it he said and i ask you have you got it so let's read matthew 13 24. another parable put forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened to a man which sowed good seed in his field but while a man while the men slept his enemy came in and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also got it okay verse 27 so the servants of the household came and said unto him sir this knocked out so good satan i filled from whence hath these tares he said unto them an enemy hath done this there's your two spirits two seeds they can't cross now sure they can intertwine but you can't make one or the other without what a conversion brother brown talks about cuckoo burn talks about wheat all listen we were all born cuckleberg we were sown by that tire of that evil one we were all born in sin we were all born by mama and daddy we were all born by the wrong seed cares but thank god by the power of transformation glory god's the only one who can do it man can't do it right man can't take an apple tree and make it a full orange tree sure he can graft it and he can do a little bit of that but he cannot make an apple seed produce an orange that's why i like that song they sing he's the only one who can take a sea and open it up and make a highway out of it he's the only one that can take a valley of dry bones and make it talk and make it live he's the only one who can do that right nobody else can do that that's right he's the only one who can take shame and make glory out of it the only one but who is he doing it through you talk about it later so the servant of the household came and said sir does not tell so good seed and thy field from whence has these come the tares and he said unto them and enemy hath done this the servant said unto them wilt now then that we go and gather them up in other words lord we're in the first church age paul we're in the first church age paul we need to condemn that thing but you can't cut it down you gotta let it grow cause see there's some good seed that's gonna be in there but there is some bad seed and we gotta let it manifest corn or kuckleberg because they both look the same got it right but he said nay lest while you gather up the tares you root up the wheat too with them let both grow together intertwine for seven church six church ages but there's going to be a time of harvest where let both grow together until the harvest now folks if this is not harvest time i don't know what time it is this is the harvest time there is no other planting of a seed the seed's been sown right amen it's manifest in time i wish somebody wrote a song about that let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares and what bind them in bundles you never bind wheat at the harvest you bind it later you cut the wheat down it has to lay over and die then you harvest but he's telling get the tares first and bind them in bundles to burn them got to separate folks but gather the wheat into my barn my barn gather the wheat into my barn not my neighbor's barn not the second person of a trinity barn my barn i'm the one that planted that good seed and the devil planted that other seed we're going to let it go until harvest time and then i'm going to send a prophet that's going to take what the loose ends he's going to take this tree and this tree put them together and grow one great tree called the truth you know what that tree that he saw grow was that's that tree of life that was in the garden of eden because there was no faults in that tree of life there was no denominational branch there was not one grafted in there so let's read now an exposition of the church age next quote harvest time yes harvest time the two vines that grew together and intertwined their branches are now to be separated the fruit of those vines which were at such variants will be gathered into separate garners look he turns it right to the two spirits the two spirits will go to their separate destinations listen they won't be one sinner in heaven and they won't be one saved in hell right everybody got that now we're all center saved by grace but you know what we're not sinners no more i just read you where paul said or john said your seed remain you say you can't sin that man inside of you cannot sin and it can't even be accounted for the sin you do if you ask for forgiveness good grief we sure are living below our privileges the two spirits will go to their separate destinations now it is time to heed the final call that comes only to the somebody say that wheat bride come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that ye wheat receive not her tares plagues the great tribulation of the sixth seal in matthew 24. like i said before you'll never stand in judgment once you receive the baptism of the holy ghost you put every every judgment you ever have you lay it on jesus christ and he took it all away from you at calvary that's why brother brown says never forget calvary never forget that 2 000 years ago when that wheat bride seed was inside of that man right spiritually not naturally spiritually and on the day of pentecost he started planting that seed and he's not finished planting yet oh yeah we say it's harvest time sure it is but there's a little few little seeds out here that needs to be that needs to be that needs to grow up a little we need to start showing our true fruit whatever we are we're going to listen this is the end time you will either be a tear or you'll be wheat can't help it number four hearing recognizing acting on the word of god here's we'll come to the end education's at the end politics is at the end war is at the end this is 1960. how many years ago 60 years ago civilizations at the end all these things all those things are at the end my what can we do then what is next we're at the end of all things now we know what brother brown said about the seventh seal said that was the end of all things right that's why i'm telling you folks you you may think this uncommon but if we don't get the revelation of those seven seals like the prophet got them you're not going in a body change now the church life is at the end the normal church we're not normal now this may stick just a little bit but the church carnal the esau church she's coming to her hand wow what's she doing heading up in the federation of churches which will finally join the romanism to fight catholicism now watch he was wrong he corrected himself or with catholicism to fight communism pope john is calling for all the churches to come back that's 1960. and they will and they'll unite themselves together just exactly what thus saith the lord so we know as we talk about the six visions or the seven that he had that brother dale was talking about he said that thus saith the lord well that's so thus saith the lord too they're all going to head up into romanism well listen as of today right now those 1200 different denominations have some form of romanism in them because remember rome will rule the world you say romanism i said yeah catholicism same thing right there is catholic doctrine in every people are going to hate this in every denomination in the world there is some form of catholic influence whether you be baptist and say i know that rome's that's the antichrist catholicism and then you say well now what difference is them in you right except for maybe a couple of little items and where did your baptism come from you see how it's going to make them mad because they're not going to get mad satan's going to get mad all right they'll be okay with that number five the breach between the church ages and the seals seal signifies now this is the word i got from the dictionary seal signifies a finished work and when the seventh seal is broke now he's in the breach he's not gotten to the seventh seal yet the mystery of god revelations 10 7 that sealed in these mysterious seals is finished until the day that seal is broken then it's revealed what's on the inside of it if the man's wondering what's in that box car you say i suppose it's supposed to be such and such you know you can you can presume all you want to you can put this box car up here with this great big lock on it you can say that's all kitkat bars and then boy to walk up and say no i don't like kitkat bars that's all s'mores then then brother louise walks up and says no i believe it's all dark chocolate you understand what i'm saying the different ideas we have of what's in that car but until you know what's in that car you are presuming so it took a profit it took the angel of the lord right through the prophet to come down and pull that seal off the door and open the door and say this is it man if a man's wondering what's in that box he said i suppose it's such and such see that's what and listen i don't belittle people they people are listen true i say true true to their denomination they're trying listen there's nobody coming to church to say well i just don't know no they're trying to do something there's some good people that are trying their best even to make something happen amen but they don't have the truth they're just presuming right every doctrine out there they're presuming that it's right because they somebody can come along and say no it's sprinkling no it's pouring no it's baptizing well now what are you going to what are you going to pour in father son holy ghost you're going to pour in the lord jesus christ you're going to baptize in presuming right what's in the car but listen there is actually something in the car in it but when the seal is broken and the door is open we see into it then and see exactly and i like kitkat so it's all kicking you see it and that'll only be done at the end time that boxcar of theology are of of truth not theology but that that boxcar of truth has moved down six church ages nobody's been able to open the door oh people have got close to try to open the door they might have looked through a slat and they saw three instead of one right they looked through a hole and said father son holy ghost hell's eternal i think i think that's right so-and-so said it was but brother branham said if god doesn't come on the scene he said we're only presuming so see to the world brother louise we're presuming you talk to people in denominations they think you're crazy because they got their own boss car right but the door's still shut amen there's no open book we have an open book we have an open door we know what's behind that door but when that seal is broke and the door is open we see into it then and see exactly what's in there right we're not presuming all right let's go to number six we must remember that the seventh seal is the end of time of all things that's right the things written in the seventh seventh seal book remember sealed up what is the seven seal book the bible and if the if it's the word in letter and you though are the word you're the word made flesh in the beginning was a word whereas with god and words god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us that's what we got to identify we can't identify and say well we think we're the word see satan thinks he is you got to know when you know you're the word you know he's not right exactly that gives us confidence it gives me confidence to press play whenever i want to but it gives me confidence to listen to a good holy ghost-filled preacher amen they can break these things down and not be presuming but know what god said amen because there's a true message i'm going to shout that all year there's a true message there's a true people and this is it christ why are you look for something else right i'm like the two angels when jesus resurrected they said why seek ye the living among the dead things written in the seven seal books sealed up of the what plan of redemption folks that's all the seals are it's the plan of redemption the real plan not the false plan the real plan sealed up for the plan of redemption from before the foundation of the world it ever bit ends it is the end it's the end of the struggling world it's the end of struggling nature it's the end of everything in there is the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials it's the end of the earth because remember look when the sevens when the seals are revealed to the bride what do we do with them we go out of here yeah israel don't get the sales like we get them because they don't get a body change they have to die right right they have to die they get the son of man message but they don't get the whole headstone right because they've rejected the headstone you and i have not well you have to decide whether you're rejected or not that's what i'm telling you it's a requirement to know these things right it's the end of the vials it's the end of the earth it's it's even the end of time remember in revelations 10 we'll read it in a minute which is one foot on land one for don't sin says what time will be no longer amen time runs out the bible said so matthew the seventh i mean revelations the seventh tenth chapter and one through seven time runs out the angel says time will be no more when that when the days of this great thing to happen everything runs out in this time the end of the at the end of this seventh seal now watch this notice it's the end of the church age it's the end of the seven seals it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials even ends the ushering in of the millennium listen it's got to end in me and you to take us to these other places there will be no millennium until we come somebody comes to the true revelation of the seventh seal because it's withholding right the boxcar hasn't been opened yet right it's the end of the trumpets the end of the vials even the string of the millennium that's on the seventh seal now what what did the seventh seal cover think about just a minute let me run through this this is not on my nose but can i run through this just a minute first four seals is what that's me and you that's the four combat beast the fourth seal the rapture takes place in the fourth seal we go up what happens on the fifth seal goes to the jews what happened to the sixth seal battle of armageddon what's after the battle of armageddon millennium that's what he's talking about this thing has the book has opened to the prophet getting ready to open to him well this is in the seventh seal it's opened up to him showing him all away we don't have to worry about what's going to happen to the jews we don't have to worry about who the two witnesses are we know who they are we know when they're coming remember listen folks there was a uh i don't know if it was the campbell lights or whoever it was i hate to call names but remember even brother brown said they thought they were the 144 thousand it was just going to be 144 000 bride saved see that's not true we know the 144 thousand are all jews according to revelation according to the fifth seal you even got a fifth sealed jew that gets their life gift or eternal life gift to him while 144 000 has to die listen the pathway for me and you has been laid to the future home we know exactly what's going to happen next we may not know who or when or what day but we know what's going to happen we know that the rapture will not take place until someone comes to that headstone and christ speaks through them just like he spoke to himself and said lazarus come forth because that call will come from the bride we will not have to go out and gather around a a a cemetery see people do that they do seances and all that evil stuff they do to try to commune with the dead folks we ain't going to communion with the dead we're going to bring them live people back to here and then we're going to be changed it's going to be such a power to we can't stand it anymore we're going to have to be changed then we're going to just step over into another dimension and let god wipe this thing off two prophets come in right it's just like firing a rock into the air and that rocket explodes here and it goes up then it explodes again it puts out five stars one of those stars explodes and blows out five more stars and one of them stars explode blows out have you ever seen that in a roman candle roman candle usually has eight balls in it different colors but once they go up there's another charge in each ball and they explode and when the m8 explode it makes 16 or 20 or every how many and it multiplies that's what brother i'm saying about us revelation have you ever seen where revelation starts tying things together that's that rocket that's that roman candle going off in you putting things together and then it explodes you go that ain't nothing about the truth and then one of them stars explodes blows off five more stars it fades on now that's what the seventh seal it just ends the time of the world it ends the time for this it means the time for that it ends the time for this i need i'm running out of room to read here thank you it means the time for that it ends the time for this it ends the time everything must just ended up on that seventh seal let's read revelations 10 7 musicians get ready to come we'll read one more quote we'll be done this is very familiar but listen this is talking about you because what did paul call the great mystery in colossians the great mystery was christ in you the hope of glory not christ in the church right not christ in the trees not christ in the books not christ in the tapes but you got to become what's on that table if it lays on that tape what it can be presumed listen jesus never ever woke up one day and was contrary to the one inside of him right me and my father we sure fought today no he said i only do that which the father shows me you say i can't do that i think he prayed in john 17 he said i pray father that me and them be the same as me and you and they were one we not been over this they were one right we're not a second person to jesus christ but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery what i'll say it tonight the mystery of who the bride really is not a church not a denomination but a people of god that he spoke in genesis 1 and said they will come the mystery of god should be finished we don't start this thing we finish it as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and we know that john typed the bride and we know they told him to eat the book and it was an open book we know that but let's read this one quote we'll be done musicians get ready to come revelation of jesus christ church age book you will recall that i mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we're studying is the actual revelation of who jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then i mention that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it all right so he just separated him there's a false spirit and there's a real one bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study right listen man has done a lot of ordinary studying to bring in these listen father son holy ghost is not a revelation the only revelation of that is it's false but that's revealed to us not somebody that you know hangs their soul on it right these people hang their soul in these different doctrines bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking i thought to make this book real is going to take the operation of the holy ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic insight that's what i'm telling you we can wonder and presume what's going on the rest of this year but that thing inside of you already knows what's going to happen this year you just please listen to it if you've ever listened to god this is the year you need to listen to that little small voice inside and you know what satan's voice most of the time is what i hear how do you figure it out you check it by the word you check it by the word give it the word test brother brown said because remember that's one thing satan cannot stand he cannot stand the word it will take one with prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from god right it will require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse by verse that's the problem they go verse by verse and they'll they come up with all these different doctrines but that's not by the holy ghost the holy ghost never quickened false doctrine it can't right it can allow it to happen but it cannot quicken it we're talking about this year a quickening of what you've got inside of you it will require supernatural instruction but now remember remember it will quicken inside of you true and false because they got to separate you've got to discern and withstand the antichrist spirit then i read you the quote before you've got to do that you say boy you make this so hard it's not hard give it the word test give it the word test if it's contrary to the word it is not god right it will require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear that's why folks i believe in a five-fold ministry not just listening to the prophet i don't discount that but i'm telling you that's where a lot of false doctrine has come from just listening to the prophet because the devil can get in this thing right here and make you think he's saying what he's saying but he's not how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open let us this year be an open book we talk about an open book we talk about an open book well you be an open book and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know let's just right here as i have already said this book revelation is the consummation of the scriptures now we talked about both seeds started in genesis and they intertwined each other but when we come to the end time they've separated and it took a prophet to call us out and say not say and say your bride but say you're wheat you're weak they're not wheat they're tares look it is even placed exactly right in the canon of scripture what at the very end now you can know why it says that anyone who reads it or even hears it is blessed it is the revelation of god that will give you authority over the devil and you can see why they who would add or take from it would be cursed because you take and add to it that becomes a denomination or you take from it it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of god and overcome the enemy it is that simple watch this right here there is nothing of such prevailing power you want power you want power over the devil there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word nothing we can have sensations we can have feelings musicians come we have all these different things but the prevailing power is when god gives you a revelation that that ain't nothing but the truth let's stand to our feet it's going to be a separating time glory and you may be deceived listen judas deceived him right up to the very end but he had to show his colors he had to show his tear his ta he was tear and he never changed he just hit himself but see as satan hides himself god also hides himself and reveals himself in you you're the living word of god there is no other on this earth there is no living word of god except you oh you have all these different no the only living word of god on this earth at this moment is you the bride of jesus christ the true bride of jesus christ is the spokesman of god on the earth that's why i tell you sisters you think oh i'll have nothing to do. you go out in the world and be a light you're going to condemn millions but you just might get eternal life given to some poor guy or somebody that is kind to you or even looks at you and says we had a guy a local guy come by and jim was getting something off of the shelf and he walked by this way and he stopped i saw him i knew he was he turned back like this and he looked when i see most centers would be looking for you know what a good-looking woman or something well he was looking at a good-looking woman my wife but he walked down there and he said god bless you sister he said you're a godly looking woman he's pentecostal but he sees all this other junk and he sees how pentecost has come to where you know the girls women you can't tell them from the world but when somebody like that you make a statement that's the word made flesh you've made that part of the word real that's right so this time today tonight from this day forward until we get out of here let's make this word real gloria don't just go through the motions well i gotta go church sunday and i gotta go to church wednesday i gotta play my instrument tonight because my mom and daddy made me no you walk up here and say god i'm gonna do the best i can do and i don't care if they like it i'm doing it for you i'm going to sit in this pew and i'm going to say hallelujah praise the lord i'm going to raise my hand i don't care if somebody around me does because i'm doing it for you i'm not doing it for anybody else we're not here for a public show we're here though to let god be known by those two spirits being separated and whether the world sees it or you see it god sees it glory god sees what's in your heart that's why he was he the david was a troubled man sure he was a murderer he had his best friend killed so he could he could have his wife that's pretty tough but god knew in the heart of david if that little evil that was there because there was no new birth if that was removed he'd have never done that right and god knew that he was the only one who knew that that's why he could say david is the apple of my eye you don't we don't know how much david cried and wept and prayed and said god forgive me i'm sorry i just had a weak moment and god said i know i know you did i know down in your heart but i believe he told david you look in the psalms there's one i'm coming i'm coming and i'm gonna clean all this whole thing up from the old testament all the way to the new testament i'm coming myself he was wounded for my transgression he was brewed from my iniquity the chastisement of my piece of appointment by his stripes i'm going to be healed david you don't worry you're going to make it david by the skin of your teeth you're going to make it but there's going to be a group that's going to read you and going to know that that's me that was right now right turn right to the book of psalms psalm 48 that psalm is to me and you it's a prayer that david's saying to god but how many times do we sing that prayer to him [Music] five or six thousand years after it was written it's still just as fresh today as it was yesterday amen you love lord amen so the two spirits they're working in the framework of the church and there's only one way is a prevailing revelation which means not just well you know i believe that that that that father son holy ghost baptism is wrong now brother brown said that's just the ability to read because it says in the bible but you got to know where that come from know that that's wrong and know that to be baptized named lord jesus christ is the correct scriptural way to be baptized right amen that's why i just may cover a few of the of the major doctrines like that not to me see to us they're not measure the common we can just go through them and go well the bible says acts 2 38 well why does it say it says in acts 2 38 why does the whole world not baptize like that yet it's in plain english and we look at it and go thank you lord remember the first time you saw water baptism you said oh thank you lord right it's been there the whole time by your name we will be known the whole name of heaven and earth is named jesus not father not son not a holy ghost but it was hidden though except to a small group of people because it's deceived the whole world into believing that's what you're supposed to do right that's what we're talking about the two spirits so let's go forward this year let's pray that god listen them two spirits reside in you not in your soul but you've got a spirit realm that he can work in those five senses that other spirit can try to get you to do things that you don't want to do young people all of us but we have an advocate and where's that advocate it's not over the under somewhere that advocates right here inside of you this is where judgment begins right here because this is the house of god this is not the house of god this is where people that are of the house of god come and worship because it doesn't matter we worship over that building over there what brother brown said you take your spirit you take that with you you take the holy ghost with you wherever you go if you have it listen if you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost this year you pray to god that you get it right because there's one time going to happen brothers i'm going to tell you something brothers and sisters that door that i said was open of that box car one day it's going to have to shut and go to its destination and when it shuts nothing's coming out nothing's going in it's going to close that's why the bible says you are sealed unto the day of your redemption so you get right with god all of us get right with god pray more study more talk to your neighbor more talk to your friends more but talk to them about god say hey let me tell you what god did for me and you know what if they go to sleep or or you know burp their beer while you're talking so what at least give them a chance i make it kind of hard sometimes but that's i mean you look at people and they just have this nonchalant whatever you know well i go to church and yeah we we do the thing and we do but boy we i like our beer you know we like well say look man there's something better there's something better let's just go one step higher because we need to be adults not children let's sing a song god bless you [Music] is now my name i've been changed i've been reborn all my life has been rearranged oh what a difference it makes when the lord has his way all my life praise god has been changed where is scarlet there it's white as snow you think about that today i am free what are you bound by you're bowed by unbelief [Music] i've been reborn all my life has been rearranged oh what a difference it makes when the lord has his way all my life praise god has been changed when i stand in his presence i stand above he will wipe every tear from my eye thank god for that now thank him for giving a wretch like me a new home beyond the sky think about that oh i've been changed i've been reborn all my life has been rearranged oh what a difference it makes when the lord has his way all my life praise god has been changed [Applause] all my life has been rearranged has god rearranged your life or is it still the same old thing the same old bed in the same old place the same old chair in the same old place the same old bible sitting upon the shelf in the same old place if you've been changed you'll know it i remember when god rearranged my life don't you and it wasn't i wasn't happy i was happy that he arranged my furniture i didn't mind it one bit he arranged me toward a heavenly home folks there's nothing in this world i like to do the things you know hunting and fishing and all these different things but there's one thing about it it dims in comparison to what god will show you if you'll just listen to him it dims in comparison all these things and we do life but when it comes to this i like brother bob what he said about getting his has this prayer time you know what tithe your time this year give god 10 and i'll tell you you take seven days at 24 hours a day every how many hours that is and and and time is at 10 and it comes up i don't know how many hours it is but that's tithing your time if you give god four or five hours of your time a week i'll guarantee you your life will be rearranged and you will absolutely have a better life you love the lord amen let's look at this though as not two spirits as them against us don't worry it is them against us but it ain't them it's them them against us that us inside against them of that old carnal nature that we have that we're getting rid of as we go up the statue of perfect man you love the lord god bless you come back sunday go with the love of the lord [Music] pray for your pastor pray for everybody that has any authority in the church pray for mom's family for the loss of her sister there and just please do not forget god because he's the one you need to say something huh okay okay [Music] i'm gonna give you two and you take them saying it again and if they'll bless our brother lord and give him strength whatever he needs father in the name of jesus christ
