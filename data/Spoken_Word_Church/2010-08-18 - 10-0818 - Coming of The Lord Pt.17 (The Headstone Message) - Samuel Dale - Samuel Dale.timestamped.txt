[32:41] my wife was telling me about i've heard
[32:43] this part of it about the family that
[32:45] had a wreck and
[32:46] and she was thinking that it was brother

[32:50] uh son
[32:52] so don't know we won't know we'll check
[32:54] into it because the names was correct as
[32:56] far as part of it but we don't know
[32:59] and uh you know was that
[33:02] was it
[33:04] it's tommy bond's son right
[33:07] which is jimmy gibson's
[33:09] daughters
[33:11] daughter they're married right and
[33:13] that's who was in the wreck right okay

[33:25] do you have any father we thank you
[33:28] for your love and your grace and to us
[33:31] thank you for the day that is here that

[33:34] we realize the day that we're living and
[33:36] know for surety that
[33:38] this is the end time
[33:41] and lord we see the end time approaching
[33:43] on the natural out there of the world
[33:44] and the things and
[33:46] we just hold on to you
[33:49] we ask your father that you would just
[33:50] come and speak to our hearts and
[33:53] let us understand what you would have to
[33:55] be said unto us
[33:57] and lord in doing that then come down
[33:58] and heal the sick
[34:00] deliver of those lord that have problems
[34:03] and then
[34:04] lord come on the scene and save souls
[34:07] and bring everything into being we love
[34:09] you and we thank you father we committed
[34:12] to you now in jesus name
[34:15] amen
[34:20] maybe we'll get off these two scriptures
[34:21] one of these days
[34:27] psalms 118 verse 19
[34:29] open to me the gates of righteousness
[34:32] i will go into them and i will praise
[34:34] the lord
[34:36] this gate of the lord into which the
[34:38] righteous shall enter
[34:41] remember jesus is that the way the truth
[34:43] the life the gate and all the thing
[34:45] i will praise thee for thou has heard me
[34:47] not become my salvation
[34:50] the stone which the builders refuse is
[34:52] become the headstone of the corner
[34:55] now we want to get onto that a little
[34:56] bit
[34:58] the headstone
[35:00] of the corner
[35:02] all right this is the lord's doing it is
[35:04] marvelous in our eyes
[35:06] this is the day which the lord hath made
[35:08] we will rejoice and be glad in it save
[35:10] now beseech thee
[35:12] oh lord oh lord i beseech thee sin now
[35:15] prosperity
[35:16] they should be he that cometh in the
[35:18] name of the lord
[35:20] we have blessed you out of the house
[35:22] of the lord now turn over to
[35:25] zechariah now remember what we said
[35:27] there
[35:28] he said he's the one that the builders
[35:30] refuse is become the headstone
[35:35] of the corner
[35:37] now that's a little different than
[35:39] our thinking a lot of times
[35:41] so we'll have to get to that scripture
[35:44] in a few minutes all right
[35:46] zechariah 4 and the angel that talked
[35:49] with me
[35:50] me came again and waked me as a man that
[35:52] is waking out of his fleet and he said
[35:54] unto me what's his thou and i said
[35:57] i have looked and behold a candlestick
[35:59] all of gold with a bowl up on the top of
[36:02] it and his seven lamps there on
[36:04] and seven pipes to the seven lamps which
[36:06] are upon the top thereof
[36:09] and two olive trees by it one up on the
[36:12] right side of the bowl and the other up
[36:13] on the left side
[36:15] and i answered and spake to that to the
[36:18] angel that talked with me saying
[36:20] what are these my lord then the angel
[36:23] that talked with me answered and said
[36:24] unto me knowest thou not what these be
[36:28] and i said no my lord
[36:30] then he answered and spake unto me
[36:32] saying
[36:33] this is the word of the lord
[36:35] now
[36:36] hang on to that see
[36:38] he's explaining what he's shown him
[36:41] the word of the lord
[36:46] which would be the bride
[36:48] of the old testament
[36:51] one set of candlesticks revelation says
[36:54] and the bride of the new testament
[36:57] because there's two sets in revelations
[37:00] 11 and 4
[37:05] then he answered and speaking to me
[37:06] saying this is the word of the lord unto
[37:08] jerubal saying
[37:10] not by might nor by power but by my
[37:12] spirit saith the lord of hosts
[37:14] who art though great mountain
[37:17] before is removable thy shall become a
[37:18] plain
[37:20] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[37:22] thereof with shouting's crying grace
[37:24] grace unto it
[37:26] moreover the word of the lord coming to
[37:27] me saying the hands of aruba will have
[37:30] laid the foundation this house and his
[37:32] hands
[37:33] shall also finish
[37:35] it and i shall know that the lord of
[37:38] hosts has sent me unto you
[37:40] for whoever despised the day of small
[37:42] things
[37:43] for they shall rejoice and shall see the
[37:45] plummet in the hand of jerubal with
[37:48] those seven which are the eyes of the
[37:50] lord which run to and fro through the
[37:52] whole earth now the seven eyes is what
[37:55] over in the book of revelation
[37:57] the seven eyes seven golden candlesticks
[37:59] all the same thing right
[38:00] right
[38:01] then answered i and said unto him what
[38:04] are these two olive trees
[38:06] upon the right side of the candles taken
[38:08] up on the left side there
[38:10] and i answered again and said unto him
[38:13] what be these two olive branches which
[38:16] brought the two golden pipes which
[38:19] through excuse me the two golden pipes
[38:21] empty the golden
[38:22] oil out of themselves
[38:25] and he answered and said
[38:28] answered me and said knowest thou not
[38:30] what these be and i said no my lord
[38:33] then said he these are the two anointed
[38:35] ones
[38:36] that stand below beside by the lord of
[38:39] the whole earth you may be seated the
[38:41] lord had his blessing
[38:43] to the reading of the word
[38:45] now
[38:48] to not back up a lot but to back up and
[38:50] review and
[38:51] i ask you that
[38:53] uh missed sunday
[38:55] to please listen
[38:56] to those services
[38:59] because in that i placed in there
[39:02] something that
[39:03] i was concerned about and been
[39:05] unconcerned about
[39:07] um for
[39:09] 20 30 years or more
[39:12] and that was that in zechariah
[39:16] it listed
[39:18] one candlestick
[39:20] two olive trees
[39:22] the book of revelations it says
[39:25] two candlesticks
[39:27] two olive trees
[39:31] and uh then
[39:35] we know that it's dealing with the end
[39:37] time because
[39:39] zerubbabel would represent the end time
[39:41] messenger
[39:42] that would bring the message in the end
[39:44] time
[39:46] and
[39:46] he would bring forth as we read there
[39:49] the headstone crying grace grace
[39:52] unto it now
[39:54] we'll get back to that in a minute but i
[39:56] want to back up and just
[39:57] just say a few words and and make sure
[40:00] you follow me
[40:02] see
[40:04] as i said in revelation in zechariah
[40:08] these two
[40:09] anointed ones
[40:12] they stand
[40:13] by the lord
[40:15] of the earth
[40:17] but over in the book of revelations it
[40:18] says revelation 11 4 i think three or
[40:21] four
[40:23] says they stand before
[40:26] me so there's a difference in it
[40:28] all right now then what bothered me was
[40:32] how could i get through there
[40:36] and and be able to hold it together
[40:40] to where that i could understand what
[40:42] was being meant
[40:43] in each position
[40:46] along the way
[40:48] you know
[40:48] and then
[40:50] to be able to come out with a finality
[40:53] of the book of revelations
[40:55] and and in doing that we tried to we
[40:58] spent quite a time speaking on these
[41:00] things
[41:00] and i told you that in
[41:03] matthew 17 then
[41:05] is the only place that you find
[41:08] moses and elijah standing by the lord
[41:12] jesus
[41:14] all right
[41:15] because there they were standing by
[41:18] the lord jesus in other words matthew 17
[41:21] verse 3
[41:22] they were talking with him
[41:25] brother branham i gave it to you where
[41:26] they had already entered into their
[41:28] theophany
[41:29] and they were able to talk to the lord
[41:32] jesus
[41:33] and tell him
[41:34] uh things
[41:37] and see people would get the idea well
[41:39] how could they tell him something well
[41:42] how could uh brother brown's little
[41:44] daughter that was 18 months old when she
[41:47] died be able to tell him one day that
[41:51] what was taking place
[41:53] is because that theophany situation
[41:56] which is the word all right
[41:58] so don't get tied up into that with
[42:01] questions about something just take it
[42:03] for what it is
[42:05] all right see then we looked at matthew
[42:08] 17
[42:10] and that's looking at matthew 17
[42:13] i gave you the pro quotes were and most
[42:15] everybody uses matthew 17
[42:18] as to be
[42:20] where the message of adoption comes from
[42:23] of the hear ye him
[42:25] you know moses and elijah and the lord
[42:27] jesus and then to hear ye him see of
[42:30] that scripture so it's basically used by
[42:34] people as adoption and that is correct
[42:39] but it must be placed correctly
[42:42] then and that's what i was trying to do
[42:45] see because brother branham said matthew
[42:47] 17 was actually the second coming
[42:50] because matthew 16
[42:52] he said that jesus says there'll be some
[42:54] standing here that won't see death until
[42:57] they see me coming into my kingdom
[42:59] all right and brother random said john
[43:02] was the one that went right up
[43:05] in chapter 17 to the minor
[43:07] transfiguration and actually saw moses
[43:10] and elijah and that's exactly the order
[43:13] of his second coming
[43:15] now people take that all over to israel
[43:18] now there's a second coming to the bride
[43:21] all right so who come to the end time
[43:24] bride to bring the message i thought we
[43:26] believed that malachi 4
[43:29] was to turn the hearts of the children
[43:32] you know to the faith of the fathers and
[43:34] things like that and then turn us
[43:35] backwards and forth
[43:37] i thought we believed it was the end
[43:38] time message i think well i didn't start
[43:41] staying verse where zechariah saw
[43:43] exactly the two anointed ones
[43:47] all right the two anointed ones are
[43:48] representation
[43:50] of the two olive trees they're not olive
[43:53] trees
[43:54] they're two prophets
[43:56] but they're in representation
[43:59] of the two olive trees you know that's
[44:01] what it's represented as
[44:03] because that's where the oil comes from
[44:07] to be able to
[44:09] burn the candle right it was from the
[44:12] olive trees good to see sister jones
[44:13] back there with us
[44:15] she's not a visitor but she she gets
[44:17] recognized she's she's a senior citizen
[44:19] she gets recognized okay
[44:22] but now
[44:25] see then looking at it we see that's
[44:27] exactly what brother branham says it is
[44:30] and he uses it
[44:32] he says now i want to use it in another
[44:34] way
[44:36] but i want you to see this is the lineup
[44:38] of the scriptures
[44:40] that is actually the second coming
[44:42] and he said that was what they were
[44:44] doing was discussing in other words
[44:47] with jesus what was going to take place
[44:49] his crucifixion et cetera
[44:52] and all and his coming
[44:55] they were talking with him it says there
[44:57] in matthew
[44:58] 17 3.
[45:00] all right
[45:00] now
[45:01] then we look at it and we see that
[45:04] that's exactly the order of the second
[45:06] coming that was what i couldn't catch
[45:09] he said well now you just quoted all the
[45:11] quotes about it yeah you can quote all
[45:13] the quotes you want to but if it ain't
[45:15] revealed
[45:16] right
[45:18] you know
[45:19] you got a line up but if it's not
[45:22] revealed
[45:23] see then you're just as bad off as if
[45:25] you haven't even read other than the
[45:27] fact that you do have the letter in the
[45:29] field
[45:31] you have at least planted the seed
[45:34] but you understand what i'm saying the
[45:36] second the order of the second coming of
[45:38] jesus christ is what god would send us a
[45:41] lie to the prophet right
[45:46] before the coming of the dreadful day of
[45:48] the lord and the dreadful day of the
[45:50] lord is not the the rapture the dreadful
[45:53] day of the lord it's the tribulation and
[45:55] going on that way
[45:58] all right but he would he promised that
[46:00] he would send us a elijah during malachi
[46:02] 4. and the order of us the coming of the
[46:05] lord
[46:06] see then it ties together
[46:09] that elijah comes
[46:12] you know the fourth time because
[46:13] remember the spirit of elijah comes five
[46:15] times
[46:16] okay you got elijah
[46:19] elisha got a double portion
[46:21] right okay
[46:24] elisha go read your bible he said what
[46:26] would you have for me to get he said i
[46:28] want a double portion of your spirit he
[46:30] said okay
[46:31] in other words it's a rough thing but if
[46:33] you if you want that it's yours for you
[46:35] if you're there when it goes and
[46:37] remember elijah done four miracles
[46:39] elisha done eight
[46:41] all right so he got a double portion all
[46:43] right then john the baptist according to
[46:47] malachi 3
[46:48] would be the third coming of elijah
[46:52] all right
[46:53] and he turned up the hearts of the
[46:55] children
[46:57] he would be the one that would be
[46:58] speaking of in malachi 4
[47:00] but you take luke 1 17 and it shows you
[47:03] exactly that john the baptist was in the
[47:06] spirit and power of elish which is
[47:08] elijah
[47:11] but see that was the third time all
[47:13] right see in the end time we're promised
[47:15] according to malachi 4 that god would
[47:18] send us
[47:19] someone with the spirit of elijah not
[47:21] the person of elijah
[47:23] but the spirit of elijah to take over an
[47:25] individual and the spirit of elijah is
[47:28] the spirit of the lord jesus christ amen
[47:30] all right
[47:31] now but it's in the prophetic form all
[47:33] right so that would be the fourth in
[47:35] this day
[47:37] bringing the number of restoration back
[47:39] into view
[47:40] we'll see then in the tribulation it
[47:42] will be elijah and moses
[47:45] okay
[47:46] because that way that'll be the fifth
[47:48] coming of elijah
[47:50] making the five times making exactly
[47:53] what god promised would take place
[47:56] here in the end time
[47:58] but now if you understand what i'm
[48:00] getting at go if you want to read it in
[48:02] matthew 17
[48:03] right after that that you're reading
[48:06] there of the hearing hymn
[48:08] and and
[48:09] they're saying to jesus but we thought
[48:11] the lies was to come
[48:14] watch him he said a lie shall come
[48:17] future tense and restore all things
[48:21] he said when i say unto you
[48:23] that
[48:24] notice is capitalized there
[48:27] that elijah
[48:29] that you're talking about
[48:30] has already come
[48:32] which would and they understood the
[48:34] scripture said if you're reading it
[48:35] there then he spoke of john the baptist
[48:39] so it specifically stated that's why
[48:41] when john they asked him said are you
[48:43] alive he said no
[48:45] because he would have been saying he was
[48:46] all five times manifested
[48:49] they said to brother rather you're
[48:50] elijah he said no
[48:53] john may ask him that he's no i'm the
[48:55] voice of one truck crying in the
[48:56] wilderness which was isaiah 40 about 42
[48:59] in there
[49:01] to fulfill the scripture
[49:02] right but what i'm trying to get you to
[49:04] see
[49:06] is that there in
[49:08] the mount of transfiguration
[49:11] is standing moses and elijah
[49:15] exactly
[49:17] the order of the second coming
[49:20] because elijah has to come and restore
[49:23] the word to us all right then you can go
[49:25] over to the tribulation and pick up
[49:27] moses brother adam i gave you the quote
[49:29] daniel 70 weeks he sent the spirit of
[49:31] elijah off of the gentile church
[49:34] now i didn't make that quote you argue
[49:36] with brother branham right
[49:38] he said the spirit of elijah off the
[49:39] gentile church would go to israel
[49:42] now brother adam wanted to go to israel
[49:45] he was headed that way
[49:48] he got to cairo egypt and god stopped
[49:50] him
[49:51] yet he had already spoken that they
[49:53] would only receive a prophet
[49:55] you see he thought it that would work in
[49:58] some way things could get worked out but
[50:00] god said nope not the time yet said the
[50:02] iniquity of the amorites is not full
[50:05] all right so he came back to preaching
[50:06] to the gentiles because see those two
[50:08] prophets that go to israel brother
[50:10] random said would be two jews
[50:14] there won't be a gentile and a jew and
[50:17] be two jews
[50:20] now you say well elijah didn't have no
[50:22] uh lineage or anything of that of the
[50:24] order will evidently must have a pretty
[50:25] good one because god used it
[50:27] but anyhow you want to argue the point
[50:29] about it i'll just make the point
[50:32] when it ends up he won't use brother
[50:34] brown and said he'll use two jews
[50:38] to bring the message but now what i
[50:40] tried to get you to see was that the old
[50:43] and the new testament brother branham
[50:45] said was the two olive trees
[50:48] so now you just said it was
[50:51] the two prophets that's exactly right
[50:54] yeah
[50:56] i think both cases is right
[50:58] yeah because remember where does the
[51:00] where does the candlestick olive oil
[51:02] come from
[51:07] it comes from them two out trees
[51:11] which you've got a
[51:12] prophet for the old testament and a
[51:14] prophet for the new testament how much
[51:16] more would you want
[51:17] not that brother adam was a prophet in
[51:19] the old testament no the three times had
[51:21] taken place in the old testament
[51:23] he was a new testament prophet
[51:26] to catch the revelation of all things
[51:28] right
[51:29] you see
[51:31] then as it come down
[51:36] we can see that they are actually
[51:37] standing one beside the other
[51:42] and that is the order i gave you the
[51:43] quotes that brother brown said that's
[51:45] the order of his second coming
[51:48] all right now the order be dawning on
[51:50] you
[51:51] a little bit what i preached
[51:54] that the second coming of jesus christ
[51:56] the bright coming of christ coming out
[51:58] of the church started on the day of
[52:02] pentecost and that's been his coming
[52:05] it's not our coming
[52:07] right
[52:08] martin luther was not martin luther
[52:10] martin luther was god made manifest for
[52:12] the portion for what it was at the time
[52:14] right
[52:16] sure he used a man
[52:18] but god was the one to bring it that's
[52:20] why zechariah said it's not by power not
[52:22] by might but by my spirit saith the lord
[52:24] he said this is the word of the lord
[52:27] right
[52:28] then he goes over and asked him about
[52:29] the two candlesticks he said these are
[52:31] two the two anointed one what who brings
[52:34] the word
[52:36] prophets right
[52:39] well is it there amos three and six i
[52:41] believe it is where he said i'll do
[52:43] nothing but reveal it to this prophets
[52:46] so we have to have a prophet to come in
[52:47] the end time we don't make bread around
[52:49] nothing god made him what he is
[52:52] you don't hear me up here preaching
[52:53] every week to try to prove to you
[52:54] brother brown was a prophet if you don't
[52:56] been around here a while and don't
[52:57] believe that
[52:59] you're in bad shape
[53:00] you sure have done a lot of sleeping
[53:03] and i still got that pepper in there if
[53:05] anybody wants it to
[53:07] to stay awake with it tonight
[53:09] but now listen
[53:11] i want to try to get to a point
[53:14] but did you notice in psalms
[53:17] i read it over and over and over
[53:19] this makes about
[53:21] 17 times i guess
[53:25] the word said
[53:26] he's
[53:28] the headstone
[53:30] of the corner right
[53:34] well now i'd rather dale i don't
[53:36] understand that but i can draw it i can
[53:37] see the cornerstone and i can see the
[53:40] headstone i can tell you all about the
[53:42] cornerstone
[53:44] you know and i can tell you about the
[53:45] headstone and i'm thinking that it's the
[53:47] same stone
[53:50] but different positions
[53:51] are different doings
[53:54] but why did
[53:59] one did the song to star saved it
[54:02] he's the headstone of the corner right
[54:04] right
[54:08] he had a reason he didn't say it's a
[54:09] headstone and says this any other
[54:11] god can talk the way he wants to
[54:13] he said zerubbabel
[54:15] would bring forth the headstone
[54:19] and brother around and said see there
[54:21] jerubal
[54:22] didn't bring the cornerstone
[54:25] because it had already been laid
[54:28] he said he just like removable there
[54:30] just cleaned off
[54:32] and brought it back to restoration
[54:35] but now what
[54:37] the headstone
[54:39] i gave you a quote number one on your
[54:41] notes there
[54:43] to where
[54:44] that brother around said on standing in
[54:45] the gap i'll give you this many times
[54:48] but he said in the church it's the
[54:49] cornerstone
[54:53] in the full church
[54:55] it's the headstone right look at the
[54:58] things it's just underlying scene you'll
[54:59] see what i'm talking about
[55:02] all right
[55:04] now
[55:08] we know that ephesians 2 and 20 says
[55:12] that we're built upon the foundations of
[55:14] apostles and prophets
[55:16] jesus christ being the chief
[55:20] corner stone
[55:24] chief cornerstone
[55:26] then the early church had the
[55:28] cornerstone
[55:29] which is the revealed word right
[55:32] the early church had the cornerstone
[55:34] because we're building a foundation
[55:35] apostles and prophets
[55:38] all right
[55:39] but the psalmist says
[55:44] see whereas in the new testament it's
[55:46] speaking of the builders refusing it and
[55:49] it becoming the
[55:50] the head of the corner we'll get to it
[55:52] in a minute
[55:54] but the psalmist said the headstone of
[55:56] the corner
[56:00] now the art to me is where brother
[56:01] branham got that the cornerstone and the
[56:03] headstone is the same stone right now
[56:06] he's got it in the bottle
[56:07] right so of course the organization has
[56:08] taught it that way too because you know
[56:10] we could read
[56:12] but what did he have
[56:15] all right
[56:16] now watch
[56:19] get the point and then we'll get down to
[56:21] something i want to say in just a minute
[56:29] acts 4 11 says
[56:32] that he's become the head of the corner
[56:35] right
[56:37] the head of the corner
[56:42] psalmist says he's the head stone of the
[56:45] corner
[56:49] ephesians 5 and 23
[56:52] sees even as christ is the head of the
[56:55] church
[56:58] now
[56:59] here's what we want to deal with for
[57:00] just a minute
[57:04] the cornerstone
[57:06] is christ
[57:08] you agree
[57:09] christ is the revealed word right
[57:12] the headstone is christ
[57:15] the revealed word
[57:18] so it would be the same stone truly
[57:21] but according to what is being made
[57:22] manifest
[57:24] but just remember now
[57:26] he's the head of the church
[57:30] today we had to wait until the end time
[57:31] get a headstone
[57:34] that's what i hear people people preach
[57:36] they want to talk something about
[57:38] something in the end time that wasn't
[57:39] down through there no he was the head of
[57:41] the church right
[57:43] yeah ephesians says that
[57:45] now he's not the headstone of the entire
[57:48] body because the entire body wasn't
[57:50] there
[57:52] when that was being spoken
[57:54] that's why i gave you the quote where
[57:55] brother man said in the church
[57:59] he's the cornerstone
[58:01] in the full church
[58:03] he's a hedge tongue
[58:05] because he become the headstone of the
[58:07] corner
[58:08] why because he's the head of the church
[58:11] right
[58:13] here's our head
[58:15] which is the reveal word
[58:18] we're supposed to be the body and what
[58:19] is he supposed to be
[58:22] come on brother gary dogs we get dogs
[58:25] and cats to get horses and
[58:28] no they don't do that
[58:30] well i'm glad you thought of it like
[58:32] that
[58:34] dogs would get dogs cats to get cats
[58:37] horses would get horses
[58:41] in other words if you don't get nothing
[58:42] that's out of the message to not
[58:43] remember
[58:45] the body and the head must be the same
[58:47] material right
[58:49] because i could have brought all these
[58:50] quotes but i'm trying to get away from
[58:51] doing so much of that now because if you
[58:53] don't understand what the prophet said
[58:55] you'll miss this one but he was talking
[58:56] about how that that
[59:00] if your
[59:01] head is flesh
[59:04] and your
[59:05] foot is concrete
[59:11] he said there's no way to get the
[59:12] message to the feet to make it move
[59:16] so the body of christ has always been no
[59:19] matter what age they were in
[59:22] was the word of god for that age you
[59:24] agree amen because that's your seven
[59:26] golden candlesticks right that's the
[59:28] spirit of seven spirits of god which
[59:30] ain't seven spiritual goddess took is
[59:32] god in seven manifestations
[59:36] now in doing that then he was the head
[59:38] of the church back there
[59:41] we've never been left without a head
[59:44] well i can't understand that because i
[59:45] thought the headstone would be the head
[59:48] that's in the full church
[59:52] you think he's not our head now
[59:57] who was lutheran wesley them magnitude
[1:00:00] you see one of the preachers in this
[1:00:02] message they'll come up and see there's
[1:00:04] something wrong and they'll just say ah
[1:00:06] them people didn't have nothing
[1:00:09] then people didn't have nothing back
[1:00:10] there
[1:00:11] it's alpha and omega
[1:00:16] and nothing in between
[1:00:19] well that's a quote
[1:00:21] yeah
[1:00:22] but then they don't quote the others
[1:00:23] where he said he's out from the mega and
[1:00:24] everything in between
[1:00:27] just remember the same oil
[1:00:29] that was burning in number one
[1:00:31] candlestick was burning in number two
[1:00:33] number three number four number five
[1:00:37] number six and number seven
[1:00:43] and it wasn't that it got weaker down
[1:00:44] that was a drawing that was made by the
[1:00:47] the the angel of the lord with the
[1:00:50] showing what had happened about the word
[1:00:53] but see
[1:00:54] if jesus christ then is our head
[1:00:57] then he is truly as i as the song is
[1:01:00] said he is then the headstone
[1:01:04] of the corner right
[1:01:08] the corner was one thing and they had
[1:01:10] another
[1:01:13] he's the head of the church the body
[1:01:17] and where do we get to that in a minute
[1:01:18] brother said he's the head of the church
[1:01:20] which is redeemed to bring the message
[1:01:22] in the last days right
[1:01:28] but you see
[1:01:30] listen to what i'm trying to say
[1:01:34] the word of god that was revealed
[1:01:38] in the book of acts of jesus christ
[1:01:41] he is and will always be the head of the
[1:01:44] church right
[1:01:47] the headstone didn't come to bring you
[1:01:50] another revelation of jesus christ
[1:01:52] different from
[1:01:54] the original
[1:01:57] it come to bring it to you to unfold or
[1:02:00] unveil it for our day
[1:02:04] i gave you the quotes on the message of
[1:02:07] grace
[1:02:09] where brother branham was talking about
[1:02:13] there on number two of your notes
[1:02:16] how that uh
[1:02:18] end time messenger would sweep off the
[1:02:20] foundation and he would bring forth the
[1:02:22] headstone
[1:02:25] but brother adam never taught anything
[1:02:27] different
[1:02:28] than what paul and him told
[1:02:30] he stood right there on what they taught
[1:02:35] and when he went beyond the curtain of
[1:02:36] time
[1:02:37] he said they said to him you'll have to
[1:02:39] be judged he said will the apostles have
[1:02:41] to be judged
[1:02:42] and they said yes
[1:02:44] he says then i don't have to worry
[1:02:46] because i preach just will they be
[1:02:47] accepted and he said they said yes he
[1:02:49] said well then i don't have to worry he
[1:02:51] said god only preached what they
[1:02:52] preached
[1:02:56] and we're coming down to the end time to
[1:02:58] see what their what it is and i believe
[1:03:00] and i've told you many many years ago
[1:03:02] that i believe the opening of those
[1:03:04] seven seals is the headstone to the
[1:03:06] church
[1:03:08] that's what i've always believed
[1:03:11] but it's the opening of the revealing of
[1:03:13] it not just because you read the book
[1:03:15] right that's right it's when it's
[1:03:17] revealed to you like it was or me like
[1:03:19] it was revealed to him
[1:03:21] then brother random come up and say what
[1:03:23] he said how many gods do they have back
[1:03:25] there he said just one he says how many
[1:03:27] gods have we got down here he said just
[1:03:29] one
[1:03:32] see
[1:03:33] but do you understand now where we can
[1:03:35] move on
[1:03:37] that
[1:03:40] he is the headstone of the church right
[1:03:44] even at the faith of the fathers he is
[1:03:47] that headstone right
[1:03:51] you said but now the headstone wouldn't
[1:03:53] all right that's what they rejected
[1:03:56] they rejected the headstone but he come
[1:03:59] to the bride as the cornerstone right
[1:04:02] to be the head of the church
[1:04:05] if you don't understand that please
[1:04:07] please ask me something about it
[1:04:10] now
[1:04:11] here's something that i'm trying to
[1:04:13] bring you to if you're reading number
[1:04:14] two down on your notes you're seeing the
[1:04:16] prophet talking about that
[1:04:19] the headstone will come crying grace
[1:04:21] grace
[1:04:24] now can the cornerstone be teaching
[1:04:26] legalism
[1:04:27] and the headstone grace is that what you
[1:04:29] think
[1:04:32] do you think brother random finally come
[1:04:34] to straighten out the scriptures
[1:04:37] and tell us the real scriptures
[1:04:41] he read between the lines
[1:04:46] he didn't come straight out of the
[1:04:47] scriptures i didn't they didn't need
[1:04:48] straightening out
[1:04:51] he stood on the scriptures and god
[1:04:53] vindicated he was standing on our
[1:04:54] scripture
[1:04:57] but you see then to understand it
[1:05:00] we must see one point as i say in there
[1:05:02] a moment ago
[1:05:04] can the body brother gary be one thing
[1:05:06] and the head be another
[1:05:11] now if the headstone and you're to be
[1:05:12] able to follow that easily if the
[1:05:15] headstone is revealed word then what
[1:05:17] would be the body of christ
[1:05:20] well i just want to speak see you got it
[1:05:22] different now that's right you're making
[1:05:25] it something different
[1:05:27] well in a way i guess you could say it
[1:05:29] like that you're making it something
[1:05:30] different
[1:05:33] the head body
[1:05:35] has to be the same material we'll read
[1:05:37] it in a minute
[1:05:40] if not what have you got
[1:05:43] foot of a bar head of a line
[1:05:46] what do you got
[1:05:50] the bride can't be one word or something
[1:05:52] different
[1:05:53] and he'll be the word right right
[1:05:57] and we claim to have the birth of the
[1:05:59] word
[1:06:06] now i want to get one point to you
[1:06:10] you don't have to turn there because
[1:06:11] we've been through it enough but if you
[1:06:12] want to turn you go ahead while we're
[1:06:14] talking
[1:06:16] i want to prove something in the
[1:06:17] scripture by the scripture
[1:06:20] in isaiah 61
[1:06:24] the psalmist was writing
[1:06:26] the writer isaiah
[1:06:29] and he went through you know the spirit
[1:06:31] of the lord is upon me because he had
[1:06:32] anointed me to preach the gospel and et
[1:06:34] cetera coming through and he went on
[1:06:36] into bringing judgment
[1:06:39] when jesus came over in luke 7 4 4 and
[1:06:42] 18
[1:06:44] he quoted a height of isaiah 61.
[1:06:50] he said the spirit of the lord is upon
[1:06:51] me because he has anointed me to preach
[1:06:52] the gospel he stopped
[1:06:58] why because that was what was pertaining
[1:07:01] to him being there at that time
[1:07:05] now
[1:07:06] i want to ask you a simple question
[1:07:08] because this means more than you think
[1:07:13] is this end time people
[1:07:15] do they house the second height of
[1:07:17] isaiah 61
[1:07:21] where it speaks of judgment
[1:07:27] do we have that or do we have the first
[1:07:29] height
[1:07:30] which speaks of grace
[1:07:33] now listen i got a little sense all
[1:07:35] right don't worry about it
[1:07:36] i know you turned down this message you
[1:07:38] got judgment but if you turn down the
[1:07:40] message of martin luther you was judged
[1:07:42] already
[1:07:44] if you turned down the the message of
[1:07:46] paul you was judged already it's not
[1:07:48] that you have to go to a white throne
[1:07:50] that's just the fact that he's going to
[1:07:51] show no partiality and take everybody
[1:07:54] there
[1:07:58] you see
[1:08:00] people say this is a judgment message oh
[1:08:02] we preach hard we preach judgment we
[1:08:05] preach women's dress and hair and
[1:08:08] clothes and oh everybody just hates us
[1:08:11] because we
[1:08:12] we preach that judgment
[1:08:17] well now a moment ago you was following
[1:08:19] me so see if you still do
[1:08:21] that the body and the head can't be any
[1:08:22] different material
[1:08:24] now i gave you some quotes from brother
[1:08:26] branham to show that
[1:08:29] that it can't be a different material
[1:08:32] if the head is the word the body is the
[1:08:34] word
[1:08:36] what kind of a message do we have in the
[1:08:38] end time
[1:08:40] well brother dale we got the second
[1:08:41] height which is judgment
[1:08:44] well
[1:08:45] why would your prophet
[1:08:48] spend so much time talking number three
[1:08:50] on your notes paragraph
[1:08:53] 46-56 of the message of grace and talk
[1:08:56] about
[1:08:57] how that the headstone would come crying
[1:08:59] grace grace
[1:09:04] now if the headstone according to
[1:09:06] zechariah comes crying grace grace
[1:09:11] then this message is not a judgment
[1:09:12] message
[1:09:15] the two witnesses carry a judgment
[1:09:16] message to israel sure
[1:09:18] i know where the quotes are
[1:09:20] this message rejected is judgment
[1:09:25] judgment is declared in the land because
[1:09:28] the prophet of god preached the message
[1:09:30] what their they crucified him
[1:09:34] and called an indictment against all the
[1:09:36] organized religions and
[1:09:39] us independence
[1:09:41] you better go read that message or hear
[1:09:43] it
[1:09:45] we're all under an indictment
[1:09:48] of whether or not we're going to follow
[1:09:50] the word
[1:09:53] now if the body is word and the head is
[1:09:55] work it won't have any trouble right
[1:09:59] but if the body is part word and the
[1:10:01] head is forward what do we got
[1:10:04] so we don't we know definitely that the
[1:10:06] head is not part word
[1:10:08] right
[1:10:09] right there's no need to dealing with a
[1:10:11] head being part word
[1:10:13] ignoramus is in the message you want to
[1:10:15] do everything but that's all right
[1:10:18] their day will be counted unto them
[1:10:21] but you see
[1:10:23] the body must be the same as the head
[1:10:25] right
[1:10:29] the body can't be one thing and hit
[1:10:30] another
[1:10:31] so if brother branham was right when he
[1:10:33] was saying that about the message of
[1:10:35] grace and he goes down to the next one
[1:10:37] which is paragraph 104 of adoption when
[1:10:40] he says my whole makeup is grace
[1:10:51] see the headstone will not come crying
[1:10:54] law law
[1:10:57] works
[1:10:58] doings
[1:11:01] zechariah even saw that
[1:11:03] under the time of works and doings
[1:11:06] he would not even say that because he
[1:11:08] knew that that would not be
[1:11:11] it was revealed to him that it would be
[1:11:13] grace grace
[1:11:16] now remember one thing in the bible if
[1:11:18] god ever says anything two times you
[1:11:20] better look at what he's talking about
[1:11:22] when he said verily verily i say unto
[1:11:25] you you better hang on to that and say
[1:11:27] why is he double stating himself because
[1:11:30] god don't use vain repetitions
[1:11:34] he's telling you that because the whole
[1:11:36] message is grace
[1:11:38] i gave it to you in jehovah jireh number
[1:11:40] five on your notes where the prophet of
[1:11:42] god said the coming of headstone crying
[1:11:44] grace grace
[1:11:45] are crying grace unto the lord
[1:11:52] this is not a message of judgment
[1:11:54] unless you turn it down
[1:11:56] amen
[1:11:58] jesus message was a message of grace
[1:12:01] because salvation was prevalent right or
[1:12:03] there right
[1:12:05] for them to
[1:12:06] receive as long as salvation is here
[1:12:09] it's not a judgment message
[1:12:14] that's why people don't realize what
[1:12:15] they're preaching see they're preaching
[1:12:17] judgment judgment judge this is judgment
[1:12:19] message what
[1:12:21] and not realizing they're already saying
[1:12:22] we're in the tribulation or somewhere
[1:12:25] they're already saying redemption is
[1:12:26] over
[1:12:31] this is a message of grace not disgrace
[1:12:33] now brother brown says and i gave it to
[1:12:35] you where he said now grace straightened
[1:12:37] out
[1:12:39] not disgrace
[1:12:42] listening to him today on the token
[1:12:43] message
[1:12:44] he said
[1:12:45] you know
[1:12:46] it's nothing about what you do
[1:12:49] he said because if you keep on doing you
[1:12:50] prove you're lost
[1:12:54] that's as blunt as anybody can be but
[1:12:55] see that's fast forwarded you know you
[1:12:57] don't read that you kind of edit that
[1:12:59] out
[1:13:00] and you only read what you want
[1:13:04] well brother dale that's just because
[1:13:06] you come up to the baptist
[1:13:08] because the baptist was the message of
[1:13:10] grace
[1:13:14] brother random told you that grace was
[1:13:16] the oldest doctrine do you want that
[1:13:18] quote
[1:13:20] grace is the oldest doctrine
[1:13:23] that ever was
[1:13:25] do you need that quote
[1:13:29] you know when he said grace started
[1:13:31] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:35] when jesus christ stood as a lamb slain
[1:13:39] grace is the oldest message in the bible
[1:13:43] but you turn it down
[1:13:45] and you're automatically judged
[1:13:48] but remember the tribulation
[1:13:50] is the wrath of god poured out that's
[1:13:52] why the bride does not go through the
[1:13:54] tribulation
[1:13:56] because the tribulation is a wrath of
[1:13:58] god poured out we are in a
[1:14:00] pre-tribulation look around the world as
[1:14:03] i told you the other day where i was
[1:14:04] reading about that chunk of ice that's
[1:14:06] floated off it's four times the big the
[1:14:08] size of manhattan up there
[1:14:11] which is probably bigger than a lot of
[1:14:13] states we got
[1:14:14] like rhode island or something up in
[1:14:15] there that chunk of eyes would be bigger
[1:14:17] and said when it gets out into the
[1:14:19] shipping line you're going to have some
[1:14:20] more
[1:14:22] titanics
[1:14:25] but you see
[1:14:28] look titanic's ain't gonna bring
[1:14:32] things on us that we need
[1:14:35] but if i was you
[1:14:36] i would pay close attention
[1:14:38] now this may be me
[1:14:41] it may have been what the lord showed me
[1:14:42] so that's up to you you decide to have
[1:14:44] that's right
[1:14:45] i'm now no problem
[1:14:49] but do you know that obama okay
[1:14:52] for them to put that
[1:14:54] mosque
[1:14:56] oh now he's backpedaling
[1:15:00] he's wanting to get out of what he said
[1:15:02] he says i've only defended the
[1:15:04] constitution
[1:15:06] but he doesn't open his mouth
[1:15:10] he said because we have the right of
[1:15:12] religious freedom in america oh my god
[1:15:17] now i'm just asking you a simple
[1:15:18] question
[1:15:20] because i don't believe that obama in
[1:15:22] the office is going to put the bride to
[1:15:24] rapture right i don't believe that
[1:15:26] adolf hitler would be there to do it
[1:15:29] you know
[1:15:31] raise him and put him back that's not it
[1:15:34] there's got to be a religious
[1:15:35] persecution
[1:15:37] right
[1:15:38] right
[1:15:39] all right wouldn't that be the start of
[1:15:41] it because if they tell them they can't
[1:15:43] have it
[1:15:45] right they're going to rebel and say why
[1:15:47] can't we have it right
[1:15:49] and then they're going to crack down on
[1:15:50] everybody and say you can't do this you
[1:15:52] can't do that you can't do this you
[1:15:54] can't do that it's going to give them a
[1:15:55] right to do those times
[1:15:57] i ain't saying the lord spoke to anybody
[1:15:59] i'm just saying there's one thing for
[1:16:00] sure
[1:16:03] who's in the white house ain't going to
[1:16:04] put us in rapture right
[1:16:07] the economy is not going to put us in
[1:16:08] the rapture might put us in a place of
[1:16:10] desperation right yeah
[1:16:13] but not interaction right
[1:16:15] there's got to be a religious
[1:16:16] persecution come from somewhere right
[1:16:18] it's already in writing now that you
[1:16:21] can't use a hate word
[1:16:24] right
[1:16:27] we were told here
[1:16:28] that as a pastor i could use the word
[1:16:34] of gay
[1:16:36] but as the congregations you can't use
[1:16:38] it
[1:16:40] now whether that was right or not i
[1:16:42] don't know and i don't really care
[1:16:43] right
[1:16:46] you say well they're listening okay
[1:16:48] they've been listening all these years
[1:16:50] they come in here book bugs years ago
[1:16:51] probably worries about it
[1:16:53] i want them to know
[1:16:56] i want the world to know right
[1:16:58] where i stand in jesus christ amen
[1:17:03] who's worried
[1:17:05] but the head can't be one material and
[1:17:08] the body being another one
[1:17:12] now watch what i'm saying because if the
[1:17:14] head was one material and the body the
[1:17:16] other it wouldn't do any good for the
[1:17:17] head to cry grace grace
[1:17:22] right
[1:17:23] you wouldn't do any good to cry grace
[1:17:24] grace
[1:17:26] if it was two different materials you're
[1:17:27] dealing with
[1:17:29] but you see our message has got to be
[1:17:31] grace
[1:17:32] that's what i want to get to
[1:17:35] but around him i gave it to you 117 sign
[1:17:38] of the
[1:17:38] of this time 63 11 13 that's number
[1:17:42] six on your notes he said the head and
[1:17:44] body they got to be the same material
[1:17:51] see now if the message of the headstone
[1:17:53] is grace
[1:17:54] what will the body be say
[1:17:57] is that simple enough
[1:18:00] if the headstone is grace grace what
[1:18:02] will the body be saying right
[1:18:04] well that means you just let them get by
[1:18:06] anything up there brother damn i'm not
[1:18:08] quite now
[1:18:11] i'll put this church against any church
[1:18:13] in this message as far as the people
[1:18:15] being lined up and we're not lined up
[1:18:18] but i don't see any of the lining up in
[1:18:20] all these churches that just keep
[1:18:21] hollering dress and hiring this and that
[1:18:23] the other and preaching i don't see any
[1:18:25] different come on well i'll just stay
[1:18:27] with where we're at
[1:18:30] because the word can be the head
[1:18:32] if we preach the word at least one thing
[1:18:34] about it it can be revealed amen
[1:18:37] but if it's not preached it can't be
[1:18:39] removed that's right
[1:18:41] where it comes so it's according what
[1:18:42] you're eating them
[1:18:44] now here's what i want to read to you
[1:18:47] because this is bringing the point that
[1:18:49] i want to bring
[1:18:51] look at number seven on your notes
[1:18:53] let's see what your prophet had to say i
[1:18:55] quoted it while ago
[1:18:56] let's read number six while you're
[1:18:58] turning getting it do it okay the sign
[1:19:00] of this times it's 63 11 13 and that's
[1:19:03] the same thing that constitutes the new
[1:19:04] birth water blood spirit the elements
[1:19:07] that came from his body is what makes
[1:19:09] his body see it come from his
[1:19:12] it come from his body is the materials
[1:19:16] that takes to to make his bright
[1:19:19] because adam
[1:19:21] had his bride taken from his body
[1:19:24] right rib take another side of adam okay
[1:19:27] christ has his bride taken from the body
[1:19:30] that was not that where it was at on
[1:19:32] calvary was not the bride removed from
[1:19:34] the body because when they pierced his
[1:19:37] side your prophet said the water and the
[1:19:39] blood run out
[1:19:41] he said that was releasing of the bride
[1:19:44] and when christ died there were three
[1:19:46] elements that came from his body water
[1:19:48] blood spirit justification through
[1:19:50] believing
[1:19:52] water sanctification through the blood
[1:19:54] and baptism of the holy spirit and this
[1:19:56] last great step that must come into the
[1:19:59] perfection
[1:20:00] that the holy spirit has to
[1:20:03] live in that church so perfectly
[1:20:06] it'll make the head and the body unite
[1:20:09] together right see
[1:20:11] see that's the body
[1:20:13] he is the head in the body right
[1:20:18] now remember what i said while i go
[1:20:25] the psalmist in psalms said that he's
[1:20:27] the headstone of the corner
[1:20:33] right
[1:20:34] the only difference between the
[1:20:35] headstone
[1:20:37] of the corner and the headstone to the
[1:20:39] body is what just more word
[1:20:41] right
[1:20:42] amen right
[1:20:45] but now look what your prophet went on
[1:20:46] to say number seven on your notes christ
[1:20:48] of mr god revealed 63 728
[1:20:51] and the kingdom of god is within you
[1:20:54] said the bible jesus the kingdom we are
[1:20:57] not a denomination we belong to a
[1:20:59] kingdom and the kingdom is the word of
[1:21:02] god made spirit and life in our own life
[1:21:05] amen
[1:21:07] bringing to pass every promise in this
[1:21:10] day
[1:21:11] as it did in that day when the word and
[1:21:14] god was one amen
[1:21:16] and the word and god is one in his
[1:21:19] church today right
[1:21:21] making it the headship of the body
[1:21:25] that is redeemed to bring the message
[1:21:29] in the last day and be taken up from the
[1:21:32] dead in the resurrection to go back and
[1:21:35] to restore again as adam and eve in the
[1:21:36] beginning of garden of eden the
[1:21:38] threefold mystery of god
[1:21:41] now read what your prophet said
[1:21:45] the headship of the body that is
[1:21:46] redeemed to bring the message
[1:21:48] well brought it down brother branham
[1:21:50] already brought the message
[1:21:55] okay
[1:21:57] but he's the one that said this
[1:22:01] well he goofed up there well all right
[1:22:03] you'll talk to him about it
[1:22:06] and when you're saying he goofed up or
[1:22:08] he didn't mean to say that or whatever
[1:22:09] then you're saying the body in the
[1:22:11] head's not the same material
[1:22:13] okay go ahead
[1:22:16] play your little games
[1:22:20] but your prophet said
[1:22:24] that the head and body would unite in
[1:22:25] the end time to bring the message
[1:22:27] come on what do you mean
[1:22:29] i mean just one thing for sure
[1:22:32] brother branham brought the message we
[1:22:33] believe it come on
[1:22:35] without him bringing the message we
[1:22:36] wouldn't have a message that's right
[1:22:41] but when that message is in the bride
[1:22:43] come on preach
[1:22:48] and unite with her
[1:22:51] in the bride
[1:22:52] remember cornerstone in the church
[1:22:56] headstone in the full church remember
[1:23:01] right brother what are you expecting to
[1:23:03] happen
[1:23:04] i expect god to unite with this bride
[1:23:07] and that she'll have the life's message
[1:23:09] because
[1:23:10] what is it 340 church age book
[1:23:13] watch let's make sure we get it right
[1:23:14] now
[1:23:15] under her messenger
[1:23:18] she will be the final voice
[1:23:21] to the final age
[1:23:25] it was not as i've always tried to tell
[1:23:27] you
[1:23:27] joshua that brought down the walls of
[1:23:30] jericho that's right
[1:23:32] it was the word that he delivered to the
[1:23:35] people i believe and they became the
[1:23:37] word and went and turned and stood and
[1:23:39] looked at the wall
[1:23:40] and as they were looking at the wall
[1:23:42] then their voices what brought the wall
[1:23:44] down right when they said what joshua
[1:23:46] said that's right that's all i've ever
[1:23:48] preached
[1:23:50] at the lice trump the scripture says for
[1:23:53] the trumpet shall sign
[1:23:56] that's not two trumpets
[1:23:59] no more than there's a two body a body
[1:24:01] and a head it's a different material
[1:24:03] it's all the same right amen
[1:24:05] same material
[1:24:07] right
[1:24:08] headship in the body unites to bring the
[1:24:10] message
[1:24:12] all right now what was the message of
[1:24:14] the cornerstone
[1:24:19] the revealed word of god
[1:24:22] for the day that they were living you
[1:24:23] agree
[1:24:25] the revealed word of god for the day
[1:24:27] that we're living
[1:24:29] that's the cornerstone
[1:24:31] then what will be the headstone
[1:24:36] it would be the message and if the
[1:24:37] headstone is crying grace grace you mean
[1:24:40] the headstones crying grace
[1:24:42] but when it gets on us it's quick and
[1:24:44] quick crying grace is startling judgment
[1:24:46] now
[1:24:47] i don't understand that i'm sorry thank
[1:24:49] you i appreciate that i don't understand
[1:24:51] that that way i just can't see it
[1:24:55] see when the headstone unites for the
[1:24:57] body it's going to bring its own message
[1:24:59] come on
[1:25:01] now folks this ain't something new what
[1:25:03] year was it brother gary 82 or 83 which
[1:25:05] one would
[1:25:08] go back and listen to those seals and i
[1:25:10] preached back in 82 and 83 and you'll
[1:25:12] hear these same things being said
[1:25:19] that the head and body would unite to
[1:25:20] bring the message
[1:25:23] brother branham brought the message
[1:25:25] right but you know what he was
[1:25:28] he was just like it was there in the
[1:25:31] book of acts or at the ending up in the
[1:25:32] old testament matthew mark luke john one
[1:25:35] of the fours covers it
[1:25:37] mark for for certain that when he raised
[1:25:39] from the dead
[1:25:40] there was an angel there
[1:25:43] to tell them people that he is risen
[1:25:45] that's right
[1:25:46] right
[1:25:48] he's not here he's risen
[1:25:50] we've preached two thousand years off of
[1:25:52] a resin resurrected risen lord jesus
[1:25:55] christ
[1:25:57] well what would be the headstone message
[1:26:02] i preached it sunday afternoon
[1:26:07] that's why i want you to listen to those
[1:26:09] that didn't hear i want you to listen
[1:26:10] there
[1:26:11] but most of you know what i've already
[1:26:12] said on it but
[1:26:16] the headstone says he's here
[1:26:18] right
[1:26:19] he's not
[1:26:20] coming
[1:26:22] he's here
[1:26:24] tie it back to just a minute that's why
[1:26:26] it covers the two in mount of
[1:26:29] transfiguration which is adoption
[1:26:32] and your prophet preached it at adoption
[1:26:35] amen
[1:26:36] but he told you that the real order of
[1:26:38] the scripture was the second coming of
[1:26:40] jesus christ
[1:26:42] so we wouldn't tell any wrong what is
[1:26:44] the second coming of jesus christ in the
[1:26:46] bride coming of christ coming out of the
[1:26:48] church the head will unite with the body
[1:26:50] now hammy remembers this quote
[1:26:52] you will never see god any more visible
[1:26:55] among you
[1:26:56] and your prophet said he would become
[1:26:57] visible among us and raise a dead and go
[1:26:59] into rapture he'll never be no more
[1:27:01] visible than he is through the headstone
[1:27:03] uniting with the body of christ
[1:27:06] that's right
[1:27:08] that's when he becomes visceral right
[1:27:11] you say knowledge signs and wonders what
[1:27:13] let's see there's where it goes
[1:27:15] you think your great computer's running
[1:27:16] good i've never preached nothing but
[1:27:19] signs and wonders
[1:27:22] you're looking at signs and wonders
[1:27:23] right
[1:27:30] rebecca what happened to that
[1:27:32] kidney stone
[1:27:35] blessing
[1:27:36] when she went into the process of it
[1:27:39] being busted to annihilate it
[1:27:42] you know what they couldn't find it
[1:27:44] hallelujah you know what they sent her
[1:27:47] home
[1:27:49] because they couldn't find it
[1:27:52] right
[1:27:54] brother mark what happened the other day
[1:27:57] when he was driving down the
[1:27:58] road you said to me now and i'm going to
[1:28:01] state it like you said
[1:28:03] you said you was running between 75 and
[1:28:05] 80 which that means just 10 miles an
[1:28:06] hour old speed limit
[1:28:11] i'm just playing yeah all right
[1:28:14] but you know what happened
[1:28:17] tire run off the car and him going that
[1:28:19] fight
[1:28:21] whole tire
[1:28:23] not just a rim not the whole rim wheel
[1:28:26] now went sailing out on the guardrail
[1:28:30] and yet the car just coasted to a
[1:28:32] complete stop on the side road
[1:28:37] now you tell me god's not here
[1:28:39] too late folks
[1:28:41] that's the god i preached over when i
[1:28:43] first saw him
[1:28:44] i've always tried to preach him as the
[1:28:46] revealed word to you and i to get you to
[1:28:48] see the revealed word
[1:28:49] to get you to see christ living among us
[1:28:52] because i've always believed what that
[1:28:53] prophet said the head body would unite
[1:28:55] to bring the message what's the message
[1:28:57] of the end time right he is here
[1:29:00] amen
[1:29:02] what else you want to talk about
[1:29:05] oh this great thing here and one of
[1:29:07] these days that
[1:29:08] obama's going to be and he ain't the
[1:29:10] right president because god be warming
[1:29:11] in the white house so it'll be
[1:29:13] maybe palin or any place or not it'd be
[1:29:16] her or
[1:29:18] hillary clinton or something it's got to
[1:29:20] be this way it's gotta be that way
[1:29:24] i thought it had to be the revealed word
[1:29:26] amen
[1:29:27] i didn't know who's in the white house
[1:29:29] anything to do with the rapture
[1:29:33] and brother branham said
[1:29:35] that in the final hours hanging on
[1:29:37] calvary
[1:29:38] more of the old testament was fulfilled
[1:29:41] than all of the time of the old
[1:29:43] testament in the final
[1:29:45] hours of calvary
[1:29:50] do you know right now if a couple of
[1:29:52] bullets flew kind of in the way to some
[1:29:54] of these guys you know who would be
[1:29:56] president
[1:29:57] right
[1:29:59] hillary clinton
[1:30:02] because all you got to do is take out
[1:30:03] all the guys above
[1:30:05] and that last one's a president
[1:30:07] bless him
[1:30:09] when that happens four we'll be ready
[1:30:10] we'll be ready
[1:30:19] to be the same material
[1:30:21] the word made flesh
[1:30:24] from the tree right right
[1:30:26] that's what your prophet said on
[1:30:28] restoration of bribery number 11 on your
[1:30:29] nose amen
[1:30:31] statue of a perfect man you remember how
[1:30:33] you're talking about

[1:30:38] with the same material it's vulcanized
[1:30:40] too
[1:30:42] you can't eyes
[1:30:44] metal and rubber
[1:30:46] won't work
[1:30:49] it's got to be
[1:30:50] the same material
[1:30:53] if he was the word we've got to be the
[1:30:54] word
[1:30:58] well all i all i just i just want to be
[1:31:00] a christian and just just
[1:31:02] this you know just be a christian

[1:31:18] because i want the lord
[1:31:20] capital no rt
[1:31:23] balaam called him the lord
[1:31:28] and yet he wanted to curse israel

[1:31:36] i mean where are we at
[1:31:38] everybody that says lord lord is not
[1:31:40] going to make it
[1:31:43] it's only those who the word is revealed

[1:32:13] a great big something got to happen out

[1:33:05] what about it folks
[1:33:08] the prophet said the bride
[1:33:10] and the headstone would unite and
[1:33:14] the message would come
[1:33:17] it's a message of grace
[1:33:22] disgrace
[1:33:25] grace
[1:33:29] grace grace
[1:33:32] god god
[1:33:45] grace grace
[1:33:48] god
[1:33:50] praise
[1:33:52] grace that is greater than all
[1:33:57] our sins singing to him
[1:34:00] grace
[1:34:18] grace grace
[1:34:21] god
[1:34:24] what is your makeup brother random his
[1:34:25] grace
[1:34:27] now there wasn't a man in the world that
[1:34:28] has preached as strong
[1:34:30] against sin as that man has preached
[1:34:33] right
[1:34:34] but yet he said my whole makeup is grace
[1:34:38] he said grace is not if i scratch your
[1:34:41] back you'll scratch mine
[1:34:43] he said grace is i'll scratch your back
[1:34:45] whether you scratch mine or not
[1:34:48] grace

[1:35:07] he's coming down hollering grace grace
[1:35:09] because we're going up our grace grace
[1:35:15] grace in its correct order is the most
[1:35:17] wonderful thing that could ever be
[1:35:18] preached
[1:35:19] and the most hardest thing for a human
[1:35:22] body to try in the mind point of
[1:35:25] bringing it to hold it together
[1:35:28] because it looked like that you're
[1:35:29] running it off
[1:35:33] it looked like it you're running it off
[1:35:34] and saying it's okay to do this okay to
[1:35:36] do that

[1:35:46] but once you receive it it brings all
[1:35:49] forms
[1:35:51] of rules and regulations with it
[1:35:54] you say well that ain't great sin
[1:36:02] you're not gonna die and go to hell
[1:36:03] because of some little something you do
[1:36:06] but if you don't want to get rid of that
[1:36:12] then if we don't want to get rid of
[1:36:13] those things
[1:36:15] then they will eat us alive
[1:36:19] and they will destroy us what we got
