Jesus we commit it to you and Lord we just pray that these services this weekend Lord Jesus as we come Lord just bless each one Lord give us what we have need of we commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen he Hebrews 9 begin at verse one and it says then verily the first Covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly Sanctuary for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick and the table and the shoe bread which is called the sanctuary and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden sensor and had the Ark of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold wherein was the golden pot that had mana and Aaron's Rod that budded and the tables of the Covenant amen God bless you may be seated and uh I titled this tonight the bread of God's house and you know brother random talked about Bethlehem being the house of God's bread amen and I just uh was looking at some things and um as it approaching Easter and I'd spoke on communion a little little while back and uh in Sunday school and just kind of looking at a few things here and just kind of want to look at a few things in in regards to all of that and you know um this is from the message uh Israel in the church and brother Ram said he said Christ is in in all the Old Testament in all the Old Testament and he was talking about you go through everyone of the wat of the separation the red hepher all of the things that you go through everything he said how the hsip and the cedar wood all mixed in together how the hood how the wood and the Tabernacle how the Brazen altar the labor the shoe bread everything pointed to Christ in him and it says in him we are complete in Jesus Christ and so I want to look at a few things tonight because we know all the scripture talks about we see Jesus Christ in all the scripture the whole thing the the whole book is about Jesus Christ and we see Christ in every aspect of the scripture and we see how everything is in the Old Testament it types Jesus Christ and we know that when it comes to the New Testament we see Jesus Christ and we see the Life of Christ and and you know one of the things that brother bam mentions he said you know God gave us three ordinances there was three things that God showed for us to do and he said the first one was water baptism and he said he said the second one was communion and the third one is feet washing foot washing and you know and he he began to talk about those things and you know when you see those those three things that God give us to do as articles uh ordinances to do in the church you know you see the life and uh doing some reading you see the life of Jesus Christ in each one of those because you know you you look at the at at say at foot washing you know when you when you look at the aspect of of the foot washing you know brother brand said it was an act of humility yes and see you see the life of Jesus Christ you see you know the first thing that it takes it takes humility but it also it also takes it shows the servitude the heart of a servant it shows the heart of love for somebody to be able to do that and you know you you see how how Jesus wanted us to see his his life because you know in the in the old when Jesus came you know all of the through the Old Testament the Pharisees and and so many of the the religious leaders of the day and so many all they were looking for was a king and they were looking for the the Messiah and they were looking for all these things that was going to take place and yet when he came he came in such a way that they didn't recognize him they didn't see him because he didn't fit the mold he did not fit their idea what the scriptures said but see it was it was him coming him condescending to be to be in fellowship with us to walk the same life that we had to to go through the same things that we that we suffer the same Tri trials and tribulations the same struggles he went through the exact same thing because he went through all that that he can be our high priest that we can that he can suffer all of these things he knows how we feel but you know he he came to do that because he wanted to see how we live he wanted he wanted to be but he had to do that so that that he could be our propitiation to to be our sacrifice he had to come in the in the form of sinful flesh to be to be the one that would be the sacrifice to pay for our Redemption and you see how how he came and and so that was a aspect that we see how God wanted us to see how he lived but not so that we see how he how he lived and even in you know when when it comes to the communion table and you know and he begins to talk about all these things that he tells you you I'm your master and Lord you say that I am because I am but he said you've seen that I'm your master and Lord and I've done these things he said you ought to do these things to one another because I've washed your feet you ought to wash one another's feet and you know because we see how he descended and he came down but he could but he could lower himself because when you look at as brother brandom said when you look at the time and the and the hour and the days in which he lived you know that was one of the worst jobs that you could have I mean it was it was the worst of the worst the lowest jobs that anybody could have was to be a footwash flunky I mean you know if you had that when you didn't have any social social status right you know I mean that was that was a job some people probably didn't want to tell anybody I I watch people's feet right yeah I mean it was it's the the in the time that they live nobody wanted to do that job even I mean probably the low even of all the servants and all the slaves that was probably put on the lowest one in the bunch right they had to do that job but the king of glory came and condescended to do that job for us to show us this is this is an act of servitude and so it doesn't matter who we are who we think we are we it's it's to be as low as brother R said to be as humble as we can be see how low you can live he said because the more humble you are the closer you are to God the closer you can get to God so we see how living living in this realm to be as humble as we can do and and so to follow these ordinances that God give us to do and we we see that when it comes to um you know foot washing and then uh communion here here's the communion when you're there and you know uh taking taking the bread and and you see how we we take the bread and we break the bread amen and you know Jesus sitting there expounding to the disciples he said he said this is my body that is broken for you see you know and everybody says well you know the Eucharist you know the the Catholics believe that this becomes the literal body yeah and it's like well the literal body when you read the scripture the literal body was in front of them and the literal body was what was talking to them the bread that he gave them was not was not his body but he said you do this in remembrance of me so it wasn't a literal thing but he was showing this is what you're supposed to be doing right because when you when you take of that it's it's communion it's Fellowship because that's exactly what he was doing when he set forth for them to go into the room and him stay there and he began to talk to them and he began to talk to them about what was going to take place because we know that they was here in this in the first Upper Room you know here they are and and they're very sad because he begins to talk about all the things that's going to take place and they're they're very un uh unsure of what's going to take place in the future because they don't understand but he begins to try to expound to them and tell them listen this is what's going to take place but don't you worry because I've prayed for you and that all these things will work out because it's according to God's plan they didn't understand that but he but he began to explain that to them but he wanted them to understand that through this you're eating my body but all at one day the spirit will come but there at the table he gave them the bread and said you eat this is my body and he said this is and gave them the wine this is my blood that you drink but uh one day that the that the spirit would come and it would Quicken the word that they held but he is explaining that to him listen to give them encouragement to understand hey this is what's going to take place but they didn't understand that but he also knew that they didn't understand but he began just to tell them don't worry about it because when he began to tell them about what was going to take place in that upper room and he began to tell them all the things that was going they were going to face in the upper that that upper room they didn't understand what was going to take place but you know when he told Peter listen you're going to deny me and all these things are going to take place but you know don't worry I've pray for you amen prise the Lord he didn't turn Peter away because he kept telling Peter listen this is what you're going to go through see he already knows what we go through and he all and many times the Lord has told us and we sometimes we don't listen amen that's right the Lord tells you ahead of time what not to do or what's going to happen right we just like Peter sometimes we're too Den for it to catch you know for it to land in the Amen in our grave matter for it to actually work because sometimes we don't want we don't want to listen to what God has to say because we don't want to have to go through it because you know what it's it's not it's not a pretty sight it's not going to be it's not going to be what we want to face but it's what we need amen amen that's right but see after they go through all of that in that upper room and he begins to fellowship with them commune with them tell them see here they are in in this one upper room and they don't know what's going to take place but you know what when he ra raises from the dead and he goes and he tells them he said he tells the the women whe at the grave he tells them to go tell my disciples that I will meet them in Jerusalem Y and so they go and then he tells them when when he goes to ascend because he comes back and he begins to expound exactly what took place he told him he said listen I told you tear this Temple down three days I'll raise it up again it's exactly what took place and when he began to explain all these things because began to tell them about the kingdom of God being a spiritual Kingdom and then they still stood there and say well is this time you going to be defeat the Romans are you going to take over the world now no man do you remember what I told pilot I told pilate that if my kingdom was of this world my followers were figh but we didn't fight why because I know what pilot doesn't know is that one day all of this will be mine I will have I will have dominion over this all one day we just got to allow the the plan of God take place because I don't have to worry about fighting because I've already all got it under control the father already has it under control and he already has a plan laid out and all we got to do is walk through it what do we have to do all we have to do is like Jesus done we've got to die to oursel and not have our own will but to have not my will but thine be done and if we allow the the plan of God to take place then you know what it'll all work out exactly to the glory of God and so as we see then what did he do he told him he said Terry in Jerusalem till you be in dued with power from on high am so all here they are in one Upper Room meeting with Jesus and being unsure of what was going to take place and here they are coming into another Upper Room unsure what's going to take place and even when brother brenon begins to talk about them being in that upper room and here they are and they say well do you think we got it and he's like well I think we've been up here long enough I think we probably got it and it's like no you T until until you be ued yes until you be filled with overflowing with until you know something's taking place until you be ued with with power from on high until something takes place as brother Wade always talks about you know he don't wouldn't get in that electrical panel cuz he don't understand those things but let me tell you something all you got to do is get in that panel and get some wires crossed and all of a sudden you'll see things you've never seen before I watched a man working on a on a floor scrubber one time and he got a screwdriver uninsulated he got across the terminals the next thing you know we all seeing lights he just about melted that screwdriver in half why because there's power there and you know what something took place amen and it's just like you stick your hand on something you know when I was a kid no Richard Richard always says well I always tell stories on him so I'm gonna tell a story on me write this in your book I was a kid I said I was standing I was standing on the couch so you can tell I was I was little yes I was very young standing on the couch um that's how like Dad always said I never was little I was just young so when I was younger I was standing on the couch but I was looking inside of a lamp and there was no light bulb in the lamp and I did not know what I was looking at and I was that's neat and there's that little PL little thing down in the middle of that light socket I like hey what does this do guess what won't do that again I didn't understand the laws of electricity but let me tell you what I got in contact with it and that's what I don't have to do that no more I know how that is well and that's the same way with the power of God you don't have to know all the ins and outs of it but let me tell you when you ever get a hold of it when it ever crosses you when it gets inside of you you don't have to have somebody tell you you got it because it's all it it has it takes something takes place you know somebody didn't have to tell me that electricity was real I got all I wanted that day and it's the same way with the power of God when you he said carry until you be ued with power from on high when they were in that upper room and they were in a place where they were unsure of what was going to they were uncertain in their walk they were unsure what was going to take place all they had seen was Jesus had ascended and they went and and stood in this room and they were afraid of what was going to take place but all of a sudden that time when the rushing Mighty Wind came in and he be began to break up in clothing tongues of fire and it began to settle upon all of them and they began to act like they were drunk and all of a sudden they had a new way of looking at things and the new way of acting and they didn't they didn't care what anybody thought of them or what anybody said because all of a sudden they open the doors and here they go right outside hey people wonder who are these crazy people coming out the door in the middle of the day but you know what Peter began to talk and he said listen stood up with the 11 and and the scripture says you know he said these are not drunk like you suppose but this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel that I will pour out my spirit amen and when the when the outpouring of the spirit then they began to Proclaim exactly what Jesus had said and began to talk about who Jesus Christ was and what the word was and a fulfillment of the word for their day and they begin to understand all of those all those different languages all those different countries they begin to understand in their own language and their own tongues exactly what the word of God was for their day and see that's exactly what it takes place when you when you get into that and so that's exactly what it has to do and so when you see these things brother R said when you when you've had that experience see then you can come to this table and begin to eat of this bread because it is showing that you've overcome something not just anybody can eat of this bread because it's for the Overcomers it's for the Christians because it is showing something that's taking place and so you eat of this bread and then the other one is is he and he says because of of eating eating the bread he said when you know this is my body you eat and he said he said because he said you sh the Lord's death till he comes and so we understand that through through foot washing we can see the life of Jesus Christ and then we commemorate his death through the communion eating the bread and we see how it it commemorates his his death but we also when it comes to baptism we understand that baptism is you know to understand the baptism speaking of of being baptized and understanding that that you had something to take place in your life that you follow in the ordinance of God he said he said repent and be baptized in in the name of Jesus Christ he said for the remission of sins why because you've had something to take place right why because it's the goodness of God that leads you to repentance but when you come to that place just as as Philip was speaking to the Ethiopian unic when he began to speak the word to him you know when he began to understand what the scriptures said understanding what Isaiah had written in all the scriptures as he began to expound and he began to see those things and he said here's water what hinder me from being baptized why because when he began to see the truth you know what it led him right to the water and it's the same thing baptism when you see something that's taking place in your life then go to the water right well is is is baptism essential yes well let me tell you something you know because you know what we're not all just like the thief on the cross and you know he didn't have no chance to do anything or other people living on their or having a deathbed confession that's somebody that's somebody else's experience but let me tell you you can't walk and talk and and come to church and everything like that and never be baptized you can't walk and talk and live a life and expect expect to have what you need and claim to be a part of Jesus Christ when you've never been to the water and been baptized because if you if God has dealt with your heart and he's brought you to an altar or a bedside or a closet or wherever or a tree stump if he's ever brought you to that place and he's changed your life and he started to lead you then you know what the first thing he's going to do is lead you to water baptism am because you know it's the same one that led us that called us out of the gutter and out of the worst places that we've ever been because out of all the darkness in the world and when he's brought you into his light and he begins to put you on the road and you start walking this narrow way when he put you on the path of righteousness he's going to lead you right to the water amen no doubt amen and so you know it's it's where everybody tries to you know that they always try to find loopholes for everything well the thing is is how close do you want to get to God many times see it shows us there's not been a true conversion that's right amen if if you can't if you can't come the way God has prescribed it for for us to come then it shows that there's not been a real heart change because if God's changed your heart then you know you want you want to get as close to God as you can that's right right you know brother I'm telling the story about I believe it was the man that was running the buckboards or the stage coach or whatever it was and you know he want know how close everybody could get to the edge and it's like well you know I get so close I get so close and the other guy's like I'm scraping the wall and he's like that's the guy I want I don't want somebody trying to run on three wheels one of them hanging off the cliff you know no I want to see how how many people can stay in the road keep all four wheels on the ground because you know it's everybody well let's just say how close we can get well you know it's like well I just stay right on the edge get right on the edge well you know what sooner or later everybody well I you know I I you know I just the Lord knows my heart and you know I just I just like you know just like this and that well listen anytime you get get in your mind get the mentality you know we just want to try to see how far we can get on the cliff and hang off and you know the devil be right behind you and he'll just give you a little nudge amen just come on just come on over just hang out a little more a little more a little more and then he'll just give you a nudge and then you're off amen so Lord why did this happen well you got yourself in a bad situation to begin with that's it but see God wants us to follow the ordinances that he's placed in the scripture he wanted us to follow these and if we can see the death burial and through baptism Romans tells us that through baptism we are buried in the likeness we are raised in the likeness of his resurrection amen so if we if we go through the ordinances that God has placed we can see the Life of Christ we can see his death but we can also see the resurrection and and so we see each one of these things has an important aspect of what God wants us to do not just something that we go through it's not just some kind of motion it's not just some act that we do right but it has a significance amen and so God wants us to do each one of those things Amen to follow him see he wants us to see the the life and the work that he has done brother ra says he says as he is here on Earth we see some of his work and he said it was meant is meant in Christian faith he said he is here the stream of all Christianity the head the beginning the origin of the Christian faith was Jesus Christ God's son the beginning of Christian faith the starting point for all mankind of all ages to look at that starting place and begin from there he was an example to us so we understand that you know Jesus when you look at the scripture you know even Jesus because he had to fulfill what was written in the Old Testament that even Jesus when he came to John in the River Jordan you know he come to John and John said Lord I need to be baptized of Thee and Jesus will suffer it to be so but we must fulfill all righteousness because the law said that the sacrifice must be washed and he came to the prophet to be washed to be baptized because that was scriptural for him to take place so if it was if it was important for us if it was important to him then it's important for us so is script is baptism an essential thing well if you're still walking and talking and still living then yes baptism is an important essential thing for you to do if Jesus was on the earth and he done it if Jesus could get down and wash the disciples feet if he could wash their feet if he could take communion and break bread with his disciples then if it's if it's important to him then it's important to us then then when he began when Paul began to talk about the the widows and the different ones you know they had to been able to to take the communion because every time they gathered they were taking communion but it also said they had to be the ones that were in the church that wash the Saints feet is an essential thing for us to do each one of those things is essential for our uh Christian walk because if he done it if he's our example then all the things that he done is exactly the things that we ought to do and so we see these things as very as very essential and if he would wash their feet because he is our pattern an example of Christianity then we ought to do the exact same thing we ought to wash one another's feet amen now when it comes to uh the the communion and and looking here it said uh the bread of God's house and I I wanted to kind of explain that t tonight and um just kind of something that's been on my heart but you know to understand why we do these things it's such an essential part not just not just the the communion and and that but every one of those ordinances has an essential aspect there's there's so much more that that it means to you when you go through those things and what a wonderful thing when you see somebody when they' when they've been out in sin and you see somebody go to the water when you see somebody that that has struggled in our in their life and you see all what God has done in their life and they go to the water to be baptized and they and God begins to lead them that way and all of a sudden you know you see God changed their life and you know it's a real testimony amen it's a real testament to God's power of what he's done and it's so essential if you've not been baptized it's such an essential thing I you know I I pray that everyone that's if you've not ever been baptized I pray God touch your heart that you get baptized I thank [Applause] God I I thank God that we've had so many baptisms in this church people have drove down their stakes and they and they have give the devil a black eye and you know if if you've been baptized before and you want to get baptized again amen if you feel like being baptized again I say get baptized again amen until you get until you get the assurance and you get to play to the place where you feel led that you need to be it's it's an essential thing brother I would I wouldn't hold nothing back and I wouldn't have no reservations or concerns or worries about anything amen I wouldn't I wouldn't give the devil no place s amen but I want to look here tonight and when you when you look at the at the communion and and one of the things I was looking at was the um the uh the bread and I read this scripture out of Hebrews because it's the one scripture that that U I was reading you know the one scripture that talks about the shoe bread and the Mana both of those being in the in the house of God and so you know when you when you see the the type of of what the communion is and understanding because we know brother Ram said that communion was fellowship and you brother Ram said one time that communion was like an oasis in the desert you know to have communion with God and and to fellowship with God and and so we see that it's a fellowship that we have and so it's it's an essential thing but when it when it talks about the shoe bread you know the shoe bread was on the was in the sanctuary was in the first or in the second Veil right as as you would think from the first coming into the second one from the outside coming in where the sanctuary is and so the table's there it's not in the Holy the holiest place but in there where the where the Candlestick and all that is but when you see that the the the bread was there and you you look back over the through the scripture and you see that how the the scripture talks about the the different um the different breads and you know the first time we see um them talking about the the bread that was uh God had given them a commandment was when they were coming out of Egypt and he begins to talk about the bread and you know he talks about them taking the lamb and the lamb because when he said when they got ready to leave uh Egypt he tells them he said listen he said the the Death Angel is coming and he said all the firstborn both man and Beast will die in Egypt tonight but he gave them the he gave them the promise he gave them the shity he said you take a lamb for your family and he said you take the blood of a lamb with no blemish in it and take this lamb and you take the blood and you roast it all with with the the the inals and everything and he said you put all that together and you're roasting that and you know that that I I've never imagined that being a wonderful smell I mean lamb and lots of things might might smell really good roasting but uh having all the inals in it's probably not the most aromatic thing that you want but when he take all that together right and you take this blood and you put it on the doorpost in the lentil and you get ready and you eat that with your shoes on and your staff in your hand ready to leave Egypt and he said you eat this Lamb with unleavened bread and he said you eat it with bitter herbs why because you're going through something that's not pleasant that's right and so because all of this is is a struggle this is this all but when you see what's going to take place so you know we [Music] [Music] even the bread that they ate was unleavened meaning that there was nothing mixed with the bread it was just the the meal and the water there's nothing else added into that it's just flat right and you know many times that's way brother brandom said you know when he got up and started preaching he's like well I'm just going to be flat he's just going to be plain why because that's exactly the way you got to be amen because there's no there's no mixing with that and as Jesus talked about Le the leaven being sin and and the ideas of the of the Pharisees he said don't have anything to do with the that leaven you do away with all of that it's just straight bread amen and so they eat this leaven this unleavened bread when they were going out because there was judgment in the land and they had to prepare themselves and so they ate unleavened bread so when you see them eating this eating this Lo unleavened bread going out when they were being delivered and then when later on when he tells them listen when you commemorate eating the lamb when you come out of Egypt even then you still you don't eat leaven bread right and then he said when you prepare for the Passover because when when he talks about in the feast days when he when you go in there and you come to this time and you're preparing for the the Passover to eat the lamb he said you don't even have it for another seven days you make sure you don't even have leaven in your house right brother you got to search and get get rid of everything yes sir anything that's contrary to the word anything contrary to this why because there's no trace of it anywhere so we get rid of all this so we have unleavened bread so when we're eating this unleavened bread then we see that he continues on here we are eating this unleavened bread and then when it comes to the time of them eating the shoe bread when they're making the shoe bread that goes in front of the in to the uh holy place when when they make this then there is no leaven they're following the same pattern of making this unleavened bread right but the scripture tells us that he says you would uh in in Leviticus he says you take fine flour and bake 12 cakes thereof and then he says in two1 deals shall be one cake he said you make two rows six in a row upon the pure table before the Lord so we know that those six in each roow so there's 12 cakes that are made and we know those 12 cakes represent the 12 tribes of Israel and they sit before the Lord that's right and the scripture tells us that we know that they are made every every Sabbath they were changed so because so they those 12 cakes set in front of the Lord in the in the Holy place for a whole week and the next Sabbath they were taken out and 12 more were placed before the Lord now the name of of the SHO bread is called the bread of his presence because it's bread that sits before him all the time because you know you see how the scripture says that Jesus said in in and believe it's in Matthew he said I am the bread of life so there was always bread sitting but in the presence of God for them to have and we know that when that pres when that time ran out in the the uh the week was over with and it was changed out then the priesthood could eat that bread amen that's right the bread was a was given to the priesthood then they were able to eat that but they had to eat it in a holy place but that was always before the Lord for them to always eat that and so they were always eating that and it was always a continual uh Covenant before God that he was always with them and it was always before them that he was always a their sustainer that's right amen every trib was before the Lord in his presence all the time amen and so it shows that when God wants us to understand that that's where he wants us to be for us to be in his presence and if you get in his presence then there's always bread to eat there's always a fulfillment because he always wants you to eat there's always something for you to take place all you got to do is get In God's Presence he's all because you're always in because you're always before him you're his children because he always had the bread representing the children of Israel before him at all times right and it's the same thing so it's you're always for the Lord he always has something for you he's always leading you he's always guiding you he always has something for you but he wants you to realize that you're always there that you know even even when David talks about you know he's written in the that he was written our names were written in the palm of his hands you know when you see all these things that you know he could never forget us brother that God has something for you amen right see we see how how this the shoe bread was laid out and and brother Brown begins to talk about how the Sho bread and and all the different types how the Sho bread lays out and and you know um one of the things that brother Bram talks about the shoe bread and he begins to talk about the Passover and you know when he talks about the shoe bread coming into the Passover and you know and the Jew the Jews always make three brother Bram talks about this a couple of times he he says you know when you see that he said the Jews never understood why they had three loaves of bread when they when they go to do the Passover there was three loaves there and he said they still don't understand why there's three loaves because he said the first one is when they start when they start the the Passover they make a they make a blessing on everything and that's over the first bread which is the highest bread the highest ranking bread and then there's a middle piece and then the lowest one is at the end of the of the meal end of the Passover and they bless the one at the end which is the lowest of the three but the middle one they said they never understood why that middle one was there but the middle one is always broken right amen it's all the middle one is always broken and brother R said they still don't understand even when you read the uh even you read some of the Jewish Scholars they don't understand why but they have they have their different ideas of why they why they do that one of the things they always talk about is that the uh they always talk about that when you go into a blessing and you have this meal you always because Jesus and even even God told in the Old Testament he said you always have the poor the poor you have with you always and he said you never forget the poor and so and he said you never forget the hungry so they always set aside bread and so there's this bread that's broken and they always say because in their in their blessing is God has blessed us and we are here eating this Passover but there's those that don't and so you know and brother brand always when you read brother Brandon when he begins to talk about this when this bread is broken he said that was the type of Jesus Christ being broken and he said because the middle wall partition is torn down and he said that's exactly because there was God which is the first bread which is the highest bread and he said you and I are that last piece because we're at the end we're are the lowest but we have to have one a mediator between God and man amen and the one that has to be the mediator between God and man is the one that's broken amen and so when you see how they talk about that broken and they said they don't even understand that right but when we come to the communion table that's what a Moses when you come to the communion table and here's this bread and you stand here and and you and we pray over and we bless this bread and we break it why because he was broken for us why because we had to have somebody to be in that place we had to have a propitiation we had to have a mediator we had to have had one to stand that could break down all the barriers to bridge that Chasm between God and us because there was no one else but there had to be one that he stepped down from from the highest of highs to step into this place as the scripture says he was made a little lower than the Angels but came into this place and he was broken for us to bridge that Gap and what does the scripture say in Isaiah that you know and uh um Isaiah you know he he said you know because uh you know I've been anointed to preach to the poor and what did it say when when they break that bread in the middle what what did it say we're recognizing the poor who came to the poor who was who was the one that brought Good Tidings to the poor to to the meek who was that Jesus Christ all of those things that it talks about he was the perfect example of that shoe bread being broken in the middle amen and so we see how all these things takes place it see we see all this was a part of showing Jesus Christ amen all the things that he done for us that he he bridged that Gap it and that shoe bread being broken for us who we were and what we needed and he was that exact same thing you know when you talk about in the in the scripture and when you when you begin to look at some of these these things you know the the interesting thing about about this shoe bread the Sho bread was was hallowed it was it was it was Sanctified and it was placed before that and when it was taken away it was it was allowed for the priest to eat that bread that's right you know it was not given just for anybody to eat that right but you know in Matthew you read the scripture where Jesus and the disciples are go walking through the field on the Sabbath day they're walking through and the disciples begin to eat grain they begin to take the the the grain from the field and began to eat and you know they rebuked they rebuked Jesus and said your disciples are not not following the law they're breaking the law on the Sabbath yeah and what did Jesus tell them said did you ever read where David amen David when he was hungry and he went before a himc it's uh 1 Samuel chapter 21 if you want to read it but you know he goes before himc and he's on the run and he goes in there and he says he asks for bread that's right and he and he says I need do you have any bread and the high priest tells him said listen so we don't have any we don't have any common bread there's no he said all we have is the shoe bread that came from the Altar and so when you when you begin to read that scripture and then he asked him he says you know um what do you have and and he says you know well he said we've got this common bread but he says the um when when he ask him about it the first thing he says well you know um where have the WHERE have the young men been and um you know he says well the young men have he said long as they keep themselves from women because he said you know they they've not they've not been with any women and he says at least they they've hallowed themselves this much and he said he said they can give they can have this bread the priest because this is uh chapter 21:4 says and the priest answered David and said there is no common bread under my hand but there is hallowed bread if the young men have kept themselves at least from women women and David answered the priest and he said of a truth women women have been kept from us about these three days since I came out and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in the manner common yay though it were Sanctified this day in the vessel so when he begins to speak about this because when that bread was brought out from the holy place and when it was brought out it was common really because but they could eat it but it was interesting that Jesus when he begins to speak of this he said that bread that hallowed bread was given to David and his men and they began to eat that and he says well how was it that Jesus you know G Jesus said well how is it that David was not breaking the law when he was eating the shoe bread that come from the altar from the table when he come out of the sanctuary and the high priest give it to them and they ate it and they weren't it wasn't counted against them and he said well how how was that that was and then he said you know they were eating the disciples were eating on the on the Sabbath why because they were hungry why because one of the things that the scripture tells us that when you see the in the scripture one of the things that's even in the Old Testament that he said you never forget the poor he said you never forget the hungry you never forget the stranger because you know he tells them he said you take care of the stranger when they're inside your land he said because you were strangers in Egypt one day he said you do not over overburden your strangers when they come into the land he said because you were burdened and overrun when you were in Egypt when you were a stranger in the land and when you come into the when they come into the land said you don't treat them that way you remember them and what did he tell them when you plant your Fields he said you don't harvest the corners he said you leave the he said what what was that for he said because it's for the poor and the hungry and the needy and the widows and whoever else because they need to have a portion why because you always remember them amen and so when it came to time when they ate the bread when when David was hungry and he came before the high priest and he needed something and the only thing was hallowed bread guess what he gave it to him why because he was hungry and when they were walking in when the disciples were walking in the field and they were hungry then there was something for them to eat why because that was the that was exactly what God has come for because is for those that are hungry he said because if you hungry he's but Jesus said he said I am the bread of life he said he that comes unto me he said they will never hunger again he said they will never thirst again why because he is the bread that you can receive see just like when people say talk about coming to the to the Lord's table well you know what we we're no nobody's ever going to be perfect enough not everybody's ever going to get to the place where they're going to be uh righteous enough to take the Lord's Supper but the thing is as God makes us worthy we don't make ourselves worthy if in our own eyes we will never take it but you know what you got to r on God God is the one that makes you that way and so if you are hungry then you know what all you got to do is come to God because God will F you because even just as David was hunger and then said because well you know it wasn't for him to eat but you know what the high priest was there and saw that there was a need and the need was bread and guess what it was given to them to eat why because God sees that you have a need then goess what God has the way Made For You amen amen all you got to do is come to God and he will feed you he will meet all your needs because Jesus when he began to talk to the the Pharisees there when they were standing there talking about the disciples eating in the field he said listen remember that the Sabbath was made for man not man made for the Sabbath because he was the lord of the Sabbath and so he makes this thing for us these things were made for us I don't know that does something for me I I brother Brown said you know he said he said I wish I was twice as much so he said I can make twice as much noise but you know God makes a way amen even even when we see these things it doesn't look like there's made a there's a way God makes a way amise the Lord even even when it looks like God even when it don't even look right amen but God makes a way God takes all things wrong and makes them right amen it's a it's a beautiful thing and I'm I'm gonna finish here in a minute but uh I just want to look here and uh the other the other portion of of the bread is the Mana and I just want to say a little bit about that but you know here is the Mana that fell as they were on that journey in the as the children of Israel was on their journey in the wilderness and here they are God fed them Mana amen fed Mana from heaven and took care of them all the way through on that Journey amen even when that even when they were unthankful that's right God took care of them and he fed them that Mana amen and here and the and the Mana they you know the the high priest that they filled up that rer and they put it in in the in the holy of holies where that testimony was there always that God fed them God always took care of them amen even when even when they were against God sure you know it's so a wonderful I always always talk tell when you when you talk about the Ark of the testimony you know you know when you look at that all those things that God done was a test testimony to to the children of Israel what God done amen he wrote the table of stone and the first tables got broke because Moses got upset with them because they had a golden calf and he said y'all shall have shall not have any other gods before me he broke those and God gave them those other tablets they were they were the rep they were the second second copy you know and it was the copy it was not the originals but you know those were in the in the holy of holies in that Arc of the testimony it was a testimony to them because you know what God kept his promises they didn't keep what God told them they were out there worshiping idols and and running away from God because well you know what Moses ain't here with us anymore and they go to Aaron and say make us Gods when they'd seen all the things that God done for them how God brought them all the way through and all the things had taken place here he was and they come into this place and he was like make us gods and they were out there run run around nude and acting all kinds of ways and they were out there and they said this is the god that delivered us from Egypt so here here is the ark and here is the the testimony the tables of stone with the Commandments on it because it showed that God kept his promise they didn't keep there that's right amen when they stood there and they told Moses well you know what you make too much you put too much on yourselves you you know we're we're we're holy people also you know God just don't speak to you God talks to more people than just you and you ain't got all the rules and the regulations and you know you ain't got everything you just don't know the mind of God on every situation and you know and it's like why is your brother the [Music] one it's always family well you know what you if you know if it wasn't Aaron you know if it wasn't moses' brother you know somebody else would get the chance but you know it's always family you know and then so you know it's like no that's who God called right amen but what did he say he told us okay we'll prove you everybody go get a rod 12 rods 12 tribes 12 men bring the rods we're going to put them in the Holy place we'll try it that's right we'll show you that God will do a miracle if it just if if the all 12 rods just say there nothing happens then guess what then you know you might have you might have a right to say the things but if God does a miracle if God does something Supernatural then he's going to show who he's called amen because Moses didn't call Aaron to the high priest he didn't call he didn't call the Levites God called them to the Levites to the to the priesthood amen he he he picked who he wanted and put who he wanted where he wanted and he put that Rod behind that beh in the in the presence in the holiest and so when that when they came back the next day God had done a work yeah right he chose one rod and it's like well it didn't but just become green no you know he didn't change colors or anything like that you know it wasn't it wasn't some kind of way that you could mistake what took place right here's a dead dried up Rod just like all 12 of them but all of a sudden one one thing took place in this dead Rod it budded and brought forth almonds why because it was an almond Rod to begin with and all of a sudden when the life hit it it became life and it brought it all the way through till it produce fruit why because it completed the whole process it just didn't turn grein and it just didn't flour it actually brought for the fruit it completed the whole process and that that Rod was placed in that testimony because it showed that God had done the work when they had stood against God he showed them that they that he was still in charge and he was still the one that was leading them when they were against what he believe you know what he said they didn't believe what he said and here they are and you know we you know we're going to die out here in the wilderness and we just can't we just can't overcome and look you just brought us out here to die we're never going to make it and you know and God fed them Supernatural Mana amen Mana from Heaven y a supernatural feeding yeah and so here they are they had this full in the holy of holies three times they stood against God denied the word was against what God had said and all three times God was standing there in his testimony in the and the holy of place the holy of holies there was those three times that God showed them that he was in charge he had been exactly what he said he was going to be to them he was the one that he was their provider their protector everything that they had need of he supplied it and here and here the the high priest was when he comes into that holy of holies he's bringing that blood in there and he's standing in the holy of holies in the shika glory and he's standing there and when he's standing there with the blood and he's standing there looking at those things and here he is looking at a rod that budded and he's looking at those tables of stone and he's looking at that R of of Mana when he's standing in that in that Holy place and he's standing there with the blood blood and he sees what God has done and there is there's the Fulfillment of what God had promised them and they're standing in the full in the in the Holy place standing there looking at those things and he begins to bring the blood well what what brother R said every believer has the opportunity to come into the holy of holies that's exactly why because when when when Jesus died he said the the temple the veil rent he said what have made access for all of us to step in to the holy of holies and when what was it because it was his blood that was shed that we have access into the holy of holies and the way has been made because it has been opened up and let me tell you when you step in there all of a sudden and God wants to show you all the things that you've been through in your life God has already made a way and if you just stand here tonight how many can stay here tonight and raise your hands and talk about the things that God has fulfilled in your life you can see those things just like when he stood there when there were everything was dead and dried up and there was no way God Made A Way amen when you were lost in sin and you had no hope and there was no way there was a way made and God come to you in your worst position The Lost and the Darkness of all things and you you know how God he just lets everything just get to the worst place that you get way down in the gut or somewhere where you got to look up to see the bottom right and all of a sudden God comes along and begins to deal with you and he begins to speak to you and bring you his brother Ernie villain said from the gutter most to the uttermost that's right why because when God brings you to those places and shows you what God has done for you amen when you step into how many because then when you can understand what he says when you have access he said come boldly before the throne of grace why you don't have to worry about it because so many times well I I don't know what God will do and you get so wored if you only begin to see when you have access into that what God has done for you and you see all the times that God has brought you through he's delivered you he's healed you well if God's done that before then what changes on what because if you've had faith that God has brought you to a place of justification then guess what when you step before the Lord then realize God's Justified you then all if you can realize you've got that Revelation that God has showed you that your past sins have have been cut off guess what you continue to walk because God will bring you to a place of sanctification thank you Lord because if you've seen God do anything if God's healed you if God's delivered you he's paid your bills whatever has G if you've seen your children saved if you've seen anything that God has done then guess what if he's done it one time he's the same yesterday today and forever if he's done it for one person he'll do it again but he wants you to step into the access that he's made for you into the holy of holies right and you'll see what God has done yeah amen amen as that song talks about Look Look What the Lord Has Done as I he's healed my body I can't remember the rest of it I can think of it Look What the Lord Has Done see what when you step in those things you see what God has done amen God wants you to realize what he's done for you amen where did God bring you from when when you begin to look at all the things that you've been through when God brought you from some other country and he's brought you here praise God God knows what he's doing how many people would have thought they'd be in Georgia I never thought that right start but you know what that's where God put us well praise the Lord God's here we're here right amen of all the things that that we expected to do in life and it didn't turn out that way well praise God and all the things that we wanted to put all of our all of our life all of our effort in all all every every bit bit of our being in and it never worked out exactly well praise God God delivered us from ourselves amen amen [Applause] Glory that God brought us to a place and see you God has brought you well then eat of that Mana amen right because it's there for you brother it's for the Overcomers amen he said every believer has a right to receive it just like every priest coming into the priesthood could get a little of that Mana that Mana never gets old it never it never rotted never got wiggle taals that's right can you imagine standing there listening to the other priest talk about them amen we ate we ate of the Mana our fathers walked in the wilderness amen and we ate of the Mana and and there there and they were able to walk in there and see that that R and I don't think I don't believe that om ever went dry ever got low they went there and ate it and they just as full as when they when they started as when it at the end I don't think itd ever run out right amen no matter how many times you come to God God never runs out of power he never runs out of Mercy he never runs out of Grace he never runs out of healings he never runs out of Deliverance he never runs out of Peace whatever you have need of there's more than enough whatever you have need all you got to do is come in there and eat and take what you need see he's here tonight to give you exactly what you have need of Amen don't sell yourself short don't sell yourself short on what God has placed there everything's has been given to us it it was perfect for us and so that's what God wants to give us and it was originally for us it was given to us and all you got to do is receive it amen so let's all stand we'll have the musicians come and just thank the Lord for his mercy and Grace to us that's right amen I want to sing that little song I don't know if y'all know it
