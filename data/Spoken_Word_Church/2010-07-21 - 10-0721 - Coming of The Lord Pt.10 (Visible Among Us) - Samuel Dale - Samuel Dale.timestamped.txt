[36:12] now I beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord I
[36:15] beseech thee send now
[36:18] Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in
[36:20] the name of the Lord we have blessed you
[36:24] out of the house of the Lord let's go
[36:27] over to
[36:30] Colossians 1 we'll begin reading about
[36:33] verse
[36:35] 10 that you might walk worthy of the
[36:38] Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful
[36:40] and never good work and increasing in
[36:43] the knowledge of God strengthen with all
[36:46] might according to his glorious power
[36:49] unto all patience and longsuffering with
[36:52] joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father
[36:55] which hath made us meat to be protect
[36:56] Akers of the inheritance of the S of the
[36:59] light of the Saints in light who had
[37:03] delivered us from the power of darkness
[37:05] and has translated us into the kingdom
[37:07] of his dear son in whom we have
[37:09] Redemption through his blood even the
[37:11] Forgiveness of sins now who is this one
[37:14] we're talking about who is the image of
[37:16] the invisible God the firstborn of ever
[37:20] creature for by him were all things
[37:22] created that are in heaven and that are
[37:24] in Earth visible and invisible
[37:27] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[37:30] principalities or Powers all things were
[37:33] made by him and for him and he is before
[37:36] all things and by him all things consist
[37:39] we'll stop there because in the next
[37:42] message your show will go on down into
[37:44] the rest you may be seated the Lord have
[37:47] his bless add his Blessing to the
[37:49] reading of the
[37:51] word now we've been talking about for
[37:53] quite a while we have a lot of quot
[37:56] Folks up here and I'm sure we will not
[37:59] be able to get to all of them but we'll
[38:01] try because I have a point that I want
[38:04] you to see and uh you know I want you to
[38:10] listen to it as I try to express it and
[38:14] then you know that's as much as I can do
[38:18] it's up to God to reveal it unto you now
[38:22] I had a little experience I told way
[38:24] about it yesterday I had a little
[38:27] experience this week and I've been
[38:29] burdened about something about the the
[38:33] uh the way I preach and the things and
[38:36] trying to do and you know for about
[38:41] close to 40
[38:44] years right and it has been a burden
[38:47] because a lot of people
[38:50] have rejected what I've tried to
[38:53] preach and uh I always burdened me
[38:57] because I thought I could maybe in some
[39:00] way I could have presented it a
[39:01] different way uh made it you know U more
[39:07] understandable and all but I I've
[39:10] tried and I'll keep on trying to be able
[39:13] to break down what I believe the Lord
[39:16] has given us but you know I was praying
[39:20] about it and everything and sitting
[39:23] downstairs doing some corn and and uh
[39:28] uh all at once something just spoke to
[39:31] me and
[39:33] said they didn't understand right what
[39:37] she was just saying exactly right and
[39:41] that's all that was
[39:43] said but you know that lifted that
[39:45] burden amen right you said well that was
[39:48] not very much to be said might not for
[39:51] you but uh it has a lot of meaning to me
[39:55] but cuz I've tried to make myself clear
[39:58] and tried to preach I've never tried to
[40:00] preach nothing but Jesus Christ and him
[40:03] crucified and uh I've never tried to
[40:05] preach nothing but the revealed word of
[40:09] the hour and the things that that you
[40:13] know the prophet has brought unto us and
[40:16] uh you know it's it's just uh I've tried
[40:20] and I believe the Lord would just saying
[40:23] okay they just don't understand what
[40:25] you're talking about cuz you see you'll
[40:28] see that more tonight in the
[40:30] message if you'll listen to the point
[40:33] I'm going to try to make you'll see more
[40:36] about what I'm
[40:39] saying because in Colossians there now
[40:42] it's the only time the word visible is
[40:46] used in the scriptures that I can find
[40:49] now invisible is used a lot of times and
[40:52] and things and and it has no other um
[40:56] anyone listening uh it has no other
[40:59] carryover to go into another u words
[41:04] like other things says but uh that's
[41:08] what we want to talk
[41:10] about we want to talk about how that
[41:13] God can become visible Among
[41:18] Us and will'll be able to raise the dead
[41:21] I gave you the quote and we'll go in
[41:24] Rapture GL have our brother back there
[41:27] with us uh we always say to you when you
[41:29] come one time around here you're a
[41:31] visitor you come two times you're part
[41:34] of us so we don't join anything we're
[41:36] just part of the body of Christ so don't
[41:39] expect to get welcomed again just always
[41:41] one time for you that's because if you
[41:44] don't make yourself welcomed it's your
[41:46] problem all right but
[41:49] now as I said the word
[41:52] visible I gave you some quotes and I
[41:55] quoted it many times times over and over
[41:57] is number three on your notes there
[42:00] where the prophet of God and what was
[42:01] the Holy Ghost given for 59 he said that
[42:05] God would become visible Among
[42:09] Us and raise the dead and we go into
[42:13] Rapture right well see that's easy for
[42:18] um someone who believes in a
[42:23] literal physical coming right of the
[42:27] body you know of the Lord Jesus
[42:30] Christ but we know that's not true right
[42:34] because we meet him in the
[42:36] air so now if we meet him in the air
[42:39] he's not coming back here in a physical
[42:42] body because as I've always tried to say
[42:44] to you that if he came now in a physical
[42:48] body then uh it would be breaking the
[42:51] scriptures because we're his body right
[42:53] we are the body of Christ it goes on
[42:55] down there in Colossians but we want to
[42:57] hold off a little bit on that because
[43:00] we'll get on to some other things with
[43:02] it
[43:03] but see to become
[43:07] visible most everybody says you know you
[43:09] talk to people about the Bible and
[43:11] they'll say well the Bible says well all
[43:14] right that's
[43:15] good you know I'm glad we can
[43:19] read but now what it says on the literal
[43:23] word has to be understood by the text or
[43:28] context every which one you would place
[43:30] it as to what it's being used in
[43:34] amen like the prophet of God talking
[43:37] about our English language is so messed
[43:39] up and I agree that like he said you can
[43:42] take the word board and you can use it
[43:45] for for uh a plank on a on on a you know
[43:49] a board that you step on or or you can
[43:52] use it come on board or or you can say
[43:55] pay your
[43:56] bored uh or you can s I'm bored with you
[44:00] well now uh to me then the only way
[44:04] you'll understand what that's being said
[44:07] is to know what text it's in right now
[44:11] if I'm wrong on that text or context I
[44:13] don't have the English and I'm not
[44:14] educated enough to know so you put it in
[44:17] there but see the before and The Afters
[44:20] have always said to you explains
[44:23] it right all right see so you read the
[44:27] before and the
[44:28] after and I say to you I say now brother
[44:32] Gary Come on board stand on this board
[44:36] and pay your board because I'm bored
[44:39] with
[44:40] you and he knows exactly what I'm
[44:42] talking about that's
[44:44] right right the words that I'm
[44:48] using is telling you what you know what
[44:52] I mean and that's the way it is with
[44:54] God's word so then that way you don't
[44:57] read it like a
[45:00] newspaper you read it waiting upon God
[45:03] to speak to you and show you what he
[45:08] wants us to
[45:10] hear so
[45:12] now strongest concordance which is a
[45:14] definition in words on in your Bible it
[45:18] says that visible is something that is
[45:22] open to The
[45:24] View
[45:26] open to the view Webster Your Dictionary
[45:30] says that is is that can be
[45:35] seen perceptible in other words which
[45:38] you can look at you know perceive it to
[45:41] the eye it means
[45:44] apparent you know a p p a r e n t or it
[45:48] means manifest or something that's
[45:52] obvious all right now parent means to to
[45:56] be exposed to
[45:57] sight visible capable of easily being
[46:01] perceived or
[46:04] understood all right now we read
[46:07] here that this one that we're talking
[46:10] about is the image of the invisible God
[46:14] right all right now we used to be
[46:19] trinitarians are we used to be God in
[46:21] three person trinitarians right well we
[46:25] didn't have much trouble with that
[46:27] because we thought we understood what it
[46:29] was saying right cuz we thought it was
[46:32] one person and another person look like
[46:36] them you know so we'd say father and son
[46:40] you know we we thought we really hadn't
[46:42] figured out but then when we come to the
[46:45] conclusion to realize that that's not
[46:48] what it's saying
[46:51] amen when that word there in verse 15 it
[46:54] was used the image that means an exact
[46:58] likeness amen
[47:01] image see now as I said we use our words
[47:05] as
[47:06] image and we try to take something to
[47:09] make an image of it but the
[47:13] irregardless of how much you could do
[47:15] you could take this
[47:18] bottle and you could try in every way
[47:21] you could
[47:22] do to make an exact image of that
[47:27] bottle and you know it can never be done
[47:31] right even the best they can do with the
[47:34] uh um machines today to be able to put
[47:38] something in it and draw it out to bring
[47:40] it
[47:41] out it is still limited to the point
[47:46] that there can be a slight flaw right
[47:49] you agree am you see I'm going to make
[47:52] an image of this I'm going to take those
[47:55] drums home home and I'm going to build
[47:57] me a set of
[47:59] drums exactly like that
[48:02] drum well I can't do
[48:05] it I can get as close as I
[48:07] can but I can never make it
[48:10] exactly well all right then if that's
[48:13] true in the
[48:15] natural that's right like I remember
[48:17] brother hress was a machinist and he
[48:20] said you know you take a gear and the
[48:22] gear gets all worn
[48:24] out well brother the boy and them would
[48:27] understand and you go down to a place
[48:28] and and you tell a man and you hand it
[48:30] to him said I want a gear just like this
[48:36] one no that's not what the man wants
[48:39] that's right right right right he
[48:42] doesn't want one like that right that
[48:45] one's worn out right he wants one like
[48:49] that one was that's
[48:51] right but see in God
[48:54] now
[48:57] that's why we believe in one true and
[48:58] living God
[49:00] Amen Jesus said if you seen me you seen
[49:03] the father that's right amen so he's not
[49:06] one in another likeness come
[49:09] on he's God revealing himself in another
[49:12] form right he revealed himself to the
[49:15] children of Israel as father you know
[49:18] Pillar of Fire and all that then he was
[49:20] in flesh the scripture said in him dwelt
[49:23] the fullness of the godhead bodily amen
[49:25] amen and now the Holy Ghost is living in
[49:28] his church it's the same God right amen
[49:32] so then he's not another person that's
[49:34] right and living in you is not another
[49:36] person right now so then when you get on
[49:40] down to the the fact of him talking
[49:43] about that all that is visible and
[49:45] invisible whether in heaven or whether
[49:48] in Earth was made by him amen by him who
[49:52] the word am all right the word made all
[49:55] things things right amen that's why John
[49:57] 1:1 says in the beginning was the word
[49:59] word was with God and the Word was God
[50:01] verse 14 said and the Word was made
[50:03] flesh and dwelt Among Us that's right
[50:05] all right amen now that's why we believe
[50:07] in one true and living God that's
[50:10] right that God changed his form Amen to
[50:15] appear down through
[50:17] time he would change his form to be
[50:21] whatever the age needed right right now
[50:25] I'm trying to make a little background
[50:26] so hang on to
[50:28] that so then if you're talking about
[50:32] something
[50:34] that is open to
[50:38] view now
[50:41] remember maybe you wouldn't understand
[50:43] this statement
[50:45] but I had rather have God to speak to me
[50:49] about what he has in his word written
[50:53] down for me to understand
[50:56] now
[50:57] listen than for me to physically see
[51:02] him right right now see you may not
[51:05] believe it that way but that's the way I
[51:06] do see you say oh if I physically see no
[51:11] no Satan can impersonate all of those
[51:14] things and he could come into an a form
[51:17] that I would be all confused
[51:21] about but yet if he Reveals His word
[51:25] then he and his word are
[51:27] one so now we're going to talk about how
[51:30] that God can be visible but not here in
[51:34] a Corporal body right not here as a
[51:37] mortal
[51:38] being you know like we are but he can be
[51:43] here that is more real than we
[51:45] are cuz that's what we don't look at you
[51:48] mean this would that this pull pit is
[51:50] made out of is more real than God's word
[51:53] that made it no right right amen because
[51:57] God's word can make another
[51:59] tree this tree this wood can't make
[52:01] another piece of wood no more it's done
[52:03] gone too far it can't be done huh but
[52:07] now think about it see something that
[52:10] can
[52:11] become
[52:13] apparent in other words something that
[52:15] can become to where that you can see it
[52:19] right you said but you can't see God
[52:21] brother
[52:23] Dale well why not
[52:27] amen it's according to how you're
[52:31] looking well the Bible says no man has
[52:35] seen God at any
[52:38] time but it also says Jesus Christ
[52:41] declared it right now are you going to
[52:44] fight one scripture with the other if he
[52:46] declared it that means he brought him
[52:48] out into the open right so we're not
[52:51] going to argue words or anything I'm
[52:53] just getting a point to you
[52:58] that being visible Among Us means a
[53:00] great
[53:01] thing all right now so we're going to
[53:05] have to be real slow about that and
[53:06] that's what I intend to
[53:09] be to be visible then is not
[53:13] physical
[53:15] mortal this
[53:17] way but it means that it can be
[53:21] revealed right amen it can be
[53:25] revealed God can be revealed right right
[53:30] if we don't believe that what do we
[53:33] believe the new birth is a revelation am
[53:36] to
[53:37] you a revelation of that God has
[53:40] accepted you right and giving you his
[53:43] own life right so then I want something
[53:48] that I can see by
[53:50] Revelation apparent to the ey see other
[53:53] words I can see it right
[53:56] but now just holding that point to a
[54:01] revelation I know that's basically the
[54:03] words you jump with when you talk about
[54:06] something apparent to the eye something
[54:08] that can be understood and all of that
[54:11] and you say well well that's a
[54:14] revelation well
[54:16] now this is where we're going to get
[54:18] into something that we need a
[54:21] revelation we need something to be
[54:23] revealed to us about this
[54:26] because God is visible here in the last
[54:30] days in a greater way than he was down
[54:34] Through the Ages amen would you agree
[54:37] amen that's right well now then if it's
[54:40] that's true and you're only using the
[54:43] word uh a v you know as visible as being
[54:47] a revelation then you're going to lose
[54:50] where Martin Luther and them had the new
[54:52] birth right and you're going to do like
[54:56] a lot of people of the message has done
[54:57] and I'll read it to you in just a minute
[55:00] that they've used the the thought of
[55:03] Alpha and
[55:04] Omega that he was back there in the book
[55:07] of
[55:08] Acts and then he'll be here in the last
[55:12] days but he's not in
[55:15] between well now what kind of a god do
[55:18] you
[55:20] have so if you use the word revelation
[55:23] and not only you're not going to get the
[55:26] understanding of what we're going to try
[55:27] to get into for a minute and just read a
[55:30] little bit and then just look at it and
[55:32] see what we're talking
[55:35] about so listen to what your Prophet had
[55:38] to say look at number four on your
[55:40] notes number three is where he said that
[55:43] he would become visible Among Us raise
[55:45] the dead and we'll go into
[55:48] Rapture now watch what he says proof of
[55:50] his resurrection 55 4 4:10 the morning
[55:54] service listen
[55:56] he's talking about Mary Magdalene and
[55:58] Martha coming to the grave and the
[56:00] things say first early that
[56:03] morning Christ showed himself visible
[56:06] among the early
[56:09] risers and then he never showed it
[56:13] anymore through the span of the
[56:17] day until the evening
[56:20] time so now he's perfectly in scripture
[56:23] right then he made himself known again
[56:26] for he was Alpha and Omega it'll be
[56:28] light in the evening time the path of
[56:30] Glory you surely find huh so
[56:34] now what's he
[56:38] saying when Jesus rose from the
[56:42] dead and Mary and Martha saw him it was
[56:45] early in the morning right all right and
[56:49] then read your scripture he's not seen
[56:51] anymore throughout the day
[56:56] but he's seen at evening time when he
[56:59] comes and appears among
[57:01] them all right so now there's your your
[57:05] thought of what the prophet is saying he
[57:08] never showed it anymore through the span
[57:10] of time until the evening time right why
[57:13] because he's Alpha and he's Omega right
[57:21] now just going down a little bit to
[57:23] about number
[57:25] 6A on your notes the baptism of the Holy
[57:28] Ghost
[57:29] 1958 uh 9:28 the morning service look
[57:33] what he's saying he's talking about the
[57:34] right hand and the left hand the
[57:35] Candlestick the darkness and how that it
[57:38] goes and he says not in the Alpha and
[57:41] Omega not the in
[57:43] between the Alpha and
[57:46] Omega had his hand stretched
[57:49] out now in that quote it looks like he's
[57:52] saying that he's not in between
[57:55] so that one was used by a lot of people
[57:57] in the message to say he was God in the
[57:59] early church but then he was not God
[58:01] down through time he was just you know
[58:04] some kind of anointing some little
[58:06] something that was there but in the
[58:08] evening time he would come back to be
[58:10] the same now we're going to get that to
[58:12] that in a minute but go on down that was
[58:14] 1958 928 now 1960 1206 I'm earning
[58:19] Church
[58:21] age he said he's both the Alpha and
[58:23] Omega and of course
[58:26] all was in between it too all the other
[58:30] letters but he specifically said Alpha
[58:33] and Omega had a rainbow over his head
[58:36] and all that's over in the Book of
[58:37] Revelation right now so we know the
[58:41] prophet is not saying one thing in one
[58:44] place another thing in another
[58:46] place he is trying to describe what he
[58:49] has
[58:51] said that he is Alpha and Omega
[58:56] all right the outstretched arms of the
[58:58] Cross reaching out see the church ages
[59:01] the symbolics the the Book of
[59:03] Revelations would come out to be Alpha
[59:05] and Omega saying
[59:08] what just like he was saying about the
[59:11] Alpha and Omega when he was talking
[59:12] about the
[59:13] resurrection that there he was the early
[59:16] morning they saw him then he's not seen
[59:19] for a while in a physical form
[59:22] like but then in the even evening time
[59:25] he's
[59:26] seen right so that's we see is what God
[59:29] is trying to
[59:30] do he's going to make himself
[59:33] visible he was there
[59:38] visible look on over to 6 C I guess
[59:43] you'd call it look on to the next page
[59:45] it says Masterpiece 1964
[59:49] 7045 the Alpha and Omega is the same he
[59:53] said I am Alpha and Omega he never never
[59:54] say anything in between I am Alpha and
[59:57] Omega the first and the last that's it
[1:00:00] now what's he
[1:00:02] explaining looks like he's contrary to
[1:00:04] one quote to the other quote no it's not
[1:00:06] the before and the after read it because
[1:00:09] the before and the after of brother
[1:00:10] random is the fact that he didn't change
[1:00:13] if he did he told you about it
[1:00:16] am I've heard this argued and argued
[1:00:18] about people and I said well what is
[1:00:21] what was God in those ages in between oh
[1:00:23] he just down to there
[1:00:25] well see they don't know nothing about
[1:00:26] it because according to my Bible he's
[1:00:30] Hebrews
[1:00:31] 13:8 which says that he's Jesus Christ
[1:00:34] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:00:37] amen whatever he was he is amen whatever
[1:00:42] he is he was and will forever be right
[1:00:45] or you've missed the scripture right but
[1:00:49] see now I want just trying to make a
[1:00:51] point to you look what he goes on to say
[1:00:54] he says said the first Ministry and the
[1:00:56] last Ministry is the
[1:00:59] same the first message and the second
[1:01:02] life's message is the same thing right
[1:01:07] now the first
[1:01:10] Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ which
[1:01:13] when he was walking upon this
[1:01:16] earth right he brought a Ministry for
[1:01:19] three and A2 years right all
[1:01:22] right now then you come up to the book
[1:01:25] of Acts and you'll find that they had
[1:01:30] the ministry of Jesus Christ in the book
[1:01:32] of
[1:01:33] Acts but they had some things that was
[1:01:35] not present there that would be in the
[1:01:38] end
[1:01:39] time I what I want you to look at for a
[1:01:42] minute
[1:01:45] now in the book of Acts I gave you
[1:01:48] quotes down to there and they were in it
[1:01:50] that that they had the same Ministry of
[1:01:52] Jesus Christ in the apostles that's on
[1:01:54] down
[1:01:55] number eight on your
[1:01:56] notes exactly like they always did see
[1:02:00] the same Ministry in the
[1:02:03] apostles that's so you that's why we
[1:02:06] have a a thought and always try to talk
[1:02:08] about that what that we must be restored
[1:02:12] back to the
[1:02:13] faith of the
[1:02:15] fathers that's what Malachi 4 says turn
[1:02:18] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:02:20] faith of the
[1:02:22] fathers faith is the revelation
[1:02:25] right so we are to be returned in the
[1:02:28] last days back to the revelation of the
[1:02:31] Apostles right now there you got to say
[1:02:34] the same
[1:02:36] Ministry everybody just looking for the
[1:02:38] same Ministry that Jesus had while he
[1:02:41] was walking here to come back and it
[1:02:44] cannot take
[1:02:47] place because you would do not have any
[1:02:49] foundation for it to rest upon oh it's
[1:02:53] just the same Ministry
[1:02:55] no you can't do it because there was
[1:02:58] some things the Lord Jesus talked about
[1:03:01] that none of the disciples knew anything
[1:03:04] about show me one scripture where any of
[1:03:06] the disciples outside of the Matthew
[1:03:09] Mark Luke and John now that said one
[1:03:11] word about the son of
[1:03:14] man they didn't understand it
[1:03:18] right but yet the Lord Jesus constantly
[1:03:21] said Son of Man son of man who man say I
[1:03:24] son of man am they didn't understand
[1:03:27] it
[1:03:29] why because it was withholden from
[1:03:34] them but then in the end times see to
[1:03:38] come back that we're to coming back to
[1:03:39] the son of man to understand but if you
[1:03:43] don't see that the same Ministry has got
[1:03:46] to be among us that was in the book of
[1:03:49] Acts
[1:03:51] amen you don't have any foundation you
[1:03:54] don't have anything you're standing out
[1:03:55] in
[1:03:57] midair in the gospel we see the same
[1:04:01] Lord Jesus Christ that was in the book
[1:04:03] of Acts has got to be back here now
[1:04:06] that's what I'm talking about the coming
[1:04:08] of the Lord that's why I've been trying
[1:04:10] to preach it to you 10 sermons now that
[1:04:13] the coming of the Lord is a revealing of
[1:04:15] his word and that he started his second
[1:04:19] coming where on the day of Pentecost
[1:04:22] amen that's right mhm he was heing his
[1:04:24] first
[1:04:26] coming he started his second coming on
[1:04:29] the day of Pentecost amen but we're
[1:04:33] still in we're still in the part of his
[1:04:36] coming because we haven't went up to
[1:04:38] meet him in the
[1:04:39] air right because that will climax the
[1:04:43] second coming to you and
[1:04:45] I so they in the the thing is what we'
[1:04:49] got to have the faith of the fathers
[1:04:51] right
[1:04:52] right if we don't have the faith of the
[1:04:55] fathers then you you can't go
[1:04:59] on like I've always tried to describe it
[1:05:01] to
[1:05:02] you if something is
[1:05:05] required to
[1:05:08] be but yet there's a vast Gap in between
[1:05:12] how you going to get there
[1:05:15] right see I know we talk on strange
[1:05:19] terms and strange languages but to
[1:05:22] newcomers and things and
[1:05:24] but just remember we've been doing this
[1:05:26] 40 years yeah but see I'm talking about
[1:05:31] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:34] right but the same one who walked the
[1:05:37] shores of Galilee right when he gave his
[1:05:41] life
[1:05:42] right that Holy Ghost that was in him
[1:05:45] that's right came back on the day of
[1:05:48] Pentecost amen and there was God
[1:05:51] manifest then in a group of people right
[1:05:54] amen whereas at the start it was God
[1:05:57] manifested in one human body you know
[1:06:01] right that started his second coming
[1:06:06] right so what are you looking for in his
[1:06:08] second coming oh this clouds are going
[1:06:10] to split it's going to go up the Eastern
[1:06:12] skies and all this to to to with the
[1:06:14] horns and all that
[1:06:20] no I thought it was going to be a secret
[1:06:22] coming come on amen I didn't think CNN
[1:06:26] was going to know about this or CVS or
[1:06:30] any
[1:06:31] other I thought it was going to be a
[1:06:33] secret coming I thought the scripture
[1:06:36] said that he would come as a thief in
[1:06:38] the night
[1:06:40] right now thief in the night don't
[1:06:43] broadcast on the CNN who he's going to
[1:06:45] rob right
[1:06:49] right but you see that's what we're
[1:06:51] talking about the revealing of Jesus
[1:06:54] Christ back
[1:06:57] Di and it started on the day of
[1:07:00] Pentecost where that he placed within
[1:07:03] them exactly what they needed for the
[1:07:05] day amen and he gave them his ministry
[1:07:09] that he had had right right amen but
[1:07:12] there was some things that he didn't
[1:07:13] tell
[1:07:15] them he didn't tell them when he was
[1:07:18] coming right he didn't tell them those
[1:07:20] things he withheld that right see it
[1:07:23] would be a mystery then as I was trying
[1:07:26] to bring out the other
[1:07:28] day but there's a difference in the what
[1:07:32] in the
[1:07:33] appearing of the Lord and the coming of
[1:07:37] the
[1:07:38] Lord cuz he can appear anywhere
[1:07:41] right but his coming is in the hearts of
[1:07:44] the Saints right
[1:07:46] amen he said well I thought it was this
[1:07:48] and I thought it was yeah that's what a
[1:07:50] lot of people think they think it was
[1:07:52] brother randam that stood here and I
[1:07:54] don't believe it I don't believe he was
[1:07:57] God
[1:07:58] no that would mess up the scriptures let
[1:08:02] me quote him to you if you think brother
[1:08:04] brandom was God let me quote
[1:08:07] him and I don't have to go through all
[1:08:10] of the big quotes to to lay it in your
[1:08:12] La he said if you
[1:08:14] say that you
[1:08:16] have oil on your forehead and blood in
[1:08:20] your hands and things he said you're
[1:08:22] denying the fact of his coming because
[1:08:25] you're saing he's here in a Corporal
[1:08:28] body and he said that's wrong Jo brother
[1:08:31] randam was him that would have messed
[1:08:33] the whole thing up that's why we don't
[1:08:35] believe it sure we believe he was the
[1:08:37] prophet of God that God used right but
[1:08:40] he was not God people say well brother
[1:08:43] randam was my God be careful what you're
[1:08:48] saying because he was not our
[1:08:52] God he was God's Prophet Amen to bring
[1:08:56] us the message right now he was not the
[1:08:59] coming of the
[1:09:01] Lord he was the one that God would use
[1:09:04] to speak and tell us what his coming is
[1:09:07] amen that's right a lot of difference in
[1:09:09] it amen the before and after clears up a
[1:09:12] lot of things doesn't it but you
[1:09:14] understand what I'm trying to say that
[1:09:17] he would become
[1:09:19] visible right invisible means that
[1:09:23] someone would be able to see it right
[1:09:25] that's right now that's what I'm trying
[1:09:27] to describe right so look at it but if
[1:09:31] we don't have the faith of the
[1:09:37] fathers
[1:09:40] then we don't know anything about the
[1:09:42] second coming of Jesus Christ
[1:09:48] right come on that's just simple as I
[1:09:51] can make it right we don't know
[1:09:54] understand the faith of the fathers and
[1:09:56] don't have the faith of the
[1:09:58] fathers we're not even in line for the
[1:10:00] second coming because we don't know what
[1:10:03] it is right because we're like the
[1:10:05] organized religion you know what you
[1:10:06] mentioned to organized religion about
[1:10:08] the mysteries in the Bible and because I
[1:10:11] come through there you know what they'll
[1:10:12] say well that's what Paul talked about
[1:10:14] the mystery the engrafted of the
[1:10:17] Gentiles well that's
[1:10:20] true that was a mystery that was sealed
[1:10:23] in the Old Testament that no one knew
[1:10:26] that the Gentiles was going to come in
[1:10:28] to the Plan of
[1:10:31] Redemption but yet God spoke of it by
[1:10:34] bringing in Rahab to harlot bringing in
[1:10:37] the different ones that were Ruth and
[1:10:39] Boaz he began to speak of those things
[1:10:43] but then one day
[1:10:45] see he spoke of it and like Isaiah and
[1:10:48] him saying that be known of a people
[1:10:50] that are not my people y but then one
[1:10:53] day
[1:10:54] the door was open to the Gentiles to be
[1:10:56] able to come in right so it was a
[1:10:59] mystery
[1:11:00] yes but it's not the mystery of all
[1:11:06] Mysteries you see in the end time we're
[1:11:08] to understand that there's got to
[1:11:12] be there's got to be a group of people
[1:11:17] that come to the Statue of a perfect man
[1:11:19] that we talk about add to your faith
[1:11:21] virt knowledge temper praise
[1:11:24] and come up to where the faith of the
[1:11:25] fathers
[1:11:27] exist and then we can speak of the
[1:11:29] coming of the Lord
[1:11:31] right but you see we know so
[1:11:34] much you we think
[1:11:38] yeah and it's just like it was years ago
[1:11:40] and I know this offended people and
[1:11:42] it'll offend you
[1:11:44] again but I was trying to preach on a
[1:11:48] Doctrine years ago that where they were
[1:11:50] trying to preach about the son of man I
[1:11:53] asked as a simple question here in the
[1:11:56] church and I said when I say son of God
[1:12:00] what do you think
[1:12:01] of and everybody here said 2,000 years
[1:12:05] ago on the shores of Galilee I said
[1:12:08] there's no need of talking about son of
[1:12:10] man till we understand Son of God so I
[1:12:12] immediately dropped off of that and to
[1:12:14] begin to preach the Son of God the
[1:12:16] baptism of the Holy
[1:12:18] Ghost because if we didn't know that
[1:12:21] that is not the first time the son of
[1:12:23] God came into being the Son of God was
[1:12:25] the word that created all things and
[1:12:27] that would be the logos that went out of
[1:12:29] God in the
[1:12:30] beginning the very Breath of God would
[1:12:33] be called The Son of God H but you see
[1:12:37] cuz people think they know
[1:12:42] everything but then when we turn
[1:12:46] down what someone is trying to bring on
[1:12:50] a
[1:12:51] subject you know
[1:12:55] and that was what I was worried about
[1:12:56] and burden see is to see people turn
[1:12:59] down what you're talking about
[1:13:03] right see I can't help it because I do
[1:13:06] the best I
[1:13:07] can it's up to God to
[1:13:11] reveal but now
[1:13:13] listen the same Ministry that Jesus gave
[1:13:17] those
[1:13:19] Apostles which was Christ in you Paul
[1:13:22] said the hope of glory
[1:13:25] amen they went forth and even in the the
[1:13:28] scripture there they were called
[1:13:29] Christians at Antioch why because they
[1:13:32] were Christlike right not that they look
[1:13:36] like him no they were living like him
[1:13:39] amen and God was using them to manifest
[1:13:42] himself among the people that's and they
[1:13:46] were called
[1:13:47] Christians in other words they were
[1:13:49] saying Jesus Christ is here again y
[1:13:53] right
[1:13:54] in the faith of the fathers then you
[1:13:57] find the revelation of the fathers they
[1:13:59] had the understanding of one true and
[1:14:00] living
[1:14:02] God Paul having the greater
[1:14:05] understanding of all of
[1:14:07] them even though Peter says he says
[1:14:09] things hard to be understood to they
[1:14:12] that are learned rational at what he's
[1:14:13] doing you know in other words you you
[1:14:15] you can't understand what he's talking
[1:14:17] about
[1:14:19] right he was trying to speak to him what
[1:14:21] God was revealing to him
[1:14:25] and he said not a one of you guys added
[1:14:27] anything to what I
[1:14:30] said and they couldn't argue with him
[1:14:34] but still Paul didn't have the
[1:14:35] understanding to be able to bring it
[1:14:37] back in the end time
[1:14:39] right so God would wait amen and bring
[1:14:43] it so what was he he was in the first
[1:14:47] church he was in the book of Acts are
[1:14:50] you going to say that was not God no he
[1:14:52] was there right then when the Holy Ghost
[1:14:55] came down on zeusa street and started
[1:14:57] there 1906 and started the the the Holy
[1:15:01] Ghost himself coming back into the
[1:15:03] church your Prophet says the ministry of
[1:15:06] Jesus Christ like the apostles had is
[1:15:08] here
[1:15:10] now right of course everybody said oh
[1:15:13] yeah it was in brother brandham but he
[1:15:15] said it was in the church right
[1:15:18] amen but you
[1:15:21] see if that book of Acts is not in you
[1:15:24] and I there's no even need of even
[1:15:27] talking about the coming of the Lord cuz
[1:15:28] we can't comprehend it
[1:15:31] right the coming of the Lord is the
[1:15:33] revealing of his word and there was
[1:15:35] things he did not reveal to those
[1:15:37] Apostles that's
[1:15:39] right so the same ministry's got to be
[1:15:42] here then in the end time that was in
[1:15:44] the book of Acts before you can talk
[1:15:46] about the same Ministry that brother
[1:15:49] randam
[1:15:51] had are you listening
[1:15:54] see people are say well brother R had
[1:15:56] that Ministry and we got it where's it
[1:16:00] at you can't even keep together what are
[1:16:02] he
[1:16:05] saying
[1:16:07] right is they going off for all kind of
[1:16:09] doctrines because they can't even keep
[1:16:12] together what he was just
[1:16:16] saying well brother L what are you
[1:16:18] talking about I'm talking about I
[1:16:20] believe that like it was at thir to
[1:16:23] Resurrection in the early church God was
[1:16:26] there with them but as it came down
[1:16:29] through the Dark Ages God was still
[1:16:31] there just like he was when he was with
[1:16:33] the children of Israel and all of their
[1:16:35] sins and things that was taking place
[1:16:38] God was still there with them right he
[1:16:41] was right there hovered over them amen
[1:16:44] and with them amen they were the ones
[1:16:47] that didn't see
[1:16:49] him he was still guiding and leading
[1:16:51] them but they' lost lost the
[1:16:53] understanding of his leadership so did
[1:16:55] they down to the ages and come out with
[1:17:00] denominationalism come out then forming
[1:17:03] churches and don't get me wrong God was
[1:17:07] using
[1:17:08] them
[1:17:11] amen Martin Luther when he preached the
[1:17:13] just shall live by faith turned the
[1:17:15] world upside down
[1:17:18] amen thank God for the truth that he
[1:17:21] brought amen thank God for what John
[1:17:23] Wesley
[1:17:26] amen all of those men brought thank God
[1:17:29] for
[1:17:31] it we wouldn't know what we're doing
[1:17:33] today that's right the Baptist restored
[1:17:36] baptism by mer mercing right you know
[1:17:39] going down
[1:17:41] up each one had its own thing to
[1:17:48] restore but see in the end time then we
[1:17:50] got to come back to the faith of the
[1:17:51] fathers amen
[1:17:53] amen we got to come back to the
[1:17:56] Revelation they had but now listen
[1:17:58] intellectual concept is not Revelation
[1:18:01] right amen that's
[1:18:03] right to say we are here doesn't mean
[1:18:07] we're
[1:18:08] here
[1:18:10] right it's what it does I'm here I ain't
[1:18:13] talking about that
[1:18:15] right to say we have the faith of the
[1:18:18] fathers without having the Revelation
[1:18:20] that the fathers had would immediately
[1:18:23] show we were wrong
[1:18:24] correct that's right we believing in the
[1:18:27] Trinity and they believed in one God you
[1:18:29] automatically know that that's not
[1:18:34] there but it's also the same God that
[1:18:37] was there has to be among us right amen
[1:18:40] doing the things right that he done
[1:18:43] there
[1:18:44] right but you see that's where the
[1:18:46] people at today though they can't see
[1:18:48] God Among the people today that's
[1:18:51] right
[1:18:54] but yet you can't deny that you turn on
[1:18:56] a TV and see the denominations and
[1:18:58] having healings and signs and
[1:19:01] wonders and you tell me they're not I'll
[1:19:03] tell you you you sure have messed up a
[1:19:07] lot cuz they have signs and wonders
[1:19:09] Among
[1:19:10] Us right well if they do that means
[1:19:13] they're Among Us also right if we
[1:19:17] believe it amen but if we don't believe
[1:19:20] it it can't be made right that's right
[1:19:23] ain't no need you getting up coming up
[1:19:25] here and asking me to pray for you if
[1:19:27] you don't believe God's in me come on
[1:19:31] right I you might as well stay and you
[1:19:33] seat
[1:19:34] right but if you believe God will meet
[1:19:36] you here you come up here God will meet
[1:19:38] you here that's right amen what do you
[1:19:41] believe that's
[1:19:43] right what would have to happen for you
[1:19:45] to believe it come
[1:19:50] on well so and so so and so well that's
[1:19:53] that's what they told Jesus if you be
[1:19:56] God come down off the cross
[1:19:58] right if you be God we've got a whole
[1:20:01] graveyard full of dead people up here
[1:20:03] come here and raise them up and we'll
[1:20:04] believe you now he knew they wouldn't
[1:20:06] believe you so we would no need go to
[1:20:08] raise a graveyard right it's not the
[1:20:11] fact that he couldn't do it
[1:20:13] right right he could have done it but he
[1:20:16] knew they wouldn't believe
[1:20:18] right see God don't
[1:20:21] play but see the the same
[1:20:23] Ministry that Jesus had then he put it
[1:20:26] in the early
[1:20:29] church and they had the signs and the
[1:20:32] Wonders and that lasted for about four
[1:20:35] Church ages through there great things
[1:20:38] taking
[1:20:39] place but they didn't have to die and go
[1:20:41] in the ground because that's what Jesus
[1:20:43] said l a corner we die and go into the
[1:20:45] ground and L alone but said if it dies
[1:20:47] and goes to ground it come forth and the
[1:20:48] multiplied for amen that was speaking of
[1:20:51] him but he died when when he did he come
[1:20:53] back on the day of Pentecost
[1:20:55] in 120 at one time then 3,000 at another
[1:21:00] right but he was also speaking of the
[1:21:02] church ages that the bride would have to
[1:21:04] go in the ground and come out
[1:21:06] right right you see we're in a
[1:21:09] restoration we're not in
[1:21:12] Reformation we're in
[1:21:14] restoration and see restoration requires
[1:21:17] Revelation
[1:21:19] amen
[1:21:21] Reformation it can be done on a lot of
[1:21:24] times you can reform
[1:21:25] yourself go down to alcoholic synonymous
[1:21:29] right they'll talk you out of drinking
[1:21:32] right but they won't deliver you that's
[1:21:35] right they won't deliver you they'll
[1:21:37] talk you out of it but that's
[1:21:41] Reformation not saying Luther and westle
[1:21:43] them didn't have anything cuz they did
[1:21:45] that's my point they had God am
[1:21:50] amen they had God among them y but he
[1:21:53] was going into the ground to where he
[1:21:55] could come
[1:21:56] out but if we don't come back to the
[1:21:58] faith of the
[1:22:00] fathers
[1:22:02] then where are we going right but if we
[1:22:05] don't
[1:22:06] believe that the faith of the fathers is
[1:22:09] here God can never make it manifest
[1:22:11] right that's right
[1:22:13] amen he's waiting on you and I
[1:22:16] amen that quote I gave you there to
[1:22:18] start with where he said he become
[1:22:19] visible Among Us read it
[1:22:24] read it where he says he waiting on you
[1:22:25] and
[1:22:28] I the church is in the grave is waiting
[1:22:31] on you and I to what to first start
[1:22:34] saying it right
[1:22:36] amen we got to say it before he can make
[1:22:39] it manifest right now come on am I in
[1:22:42] the scripture what does the scripture
[1:22:44] say man believe in his heart no it
[1:22:46] didn't just say that says he saved he
[1:22:49] got to confess with his mou yes sir
[1:22:52] right there's a two-part there of it you
[1:22:54] believe in your heart but if you won't
[1:22:56] confess with your mouth right like
[1:22:58] brother R told that time the you said
[1:23:00] that lady said told the other one said I
[1:23:03] got the Holy Ghost the other night spoke
[1:23:05] in tongues but don't you tell
[1:23:09] nobody she didn't get it that's right
[1:23:13] cuz the Bible said believing in your
[1:23:15] heart fine but you got to confess with
[1:23:17] your
[1:23:19] mouth well you got to confess it before
[1:23:21] you can possess
[1:23:24] but no we're figh going opposite
[1:23:27] direction we're saying if it come here
[1:23:29] then we'll confess it no we got to
[1:23:31] confess it amen that's
[1:23:33] right we've got to confess it before it
[1:23:36] can be made
[1:23:38] manifest well why can't we start saying
[1:23:41] that the same God that was in the book
[1:23:43] of Acts is here today
[1:23:47] right and of course then when I try to
[1:23:50] explain it everybody thinks that I'm
[1:23:52] saying that that you know that uh trying
[1:23:55] to explain it away no I'm just
[1:23:59] truthful and that's what people are
[1:24:00] getting away from the truth that's what
[1:24:02] I was telling the Lord told me he said
[1:24:04] you told him the truth
[1:24:09] right the truth is you bring them
[1:24:12] Apostles down here and they got problems
[1:24:14] fooling with what we got
[1:24:17] right amen they had a Pharisees and the
[1:24:20] Sadducees right right no denominational
[1:24:25] doctrines we got
[1:24:30] 969 plus 10,000 in this message
[1:24:33] afterward oh that's
[1:24:36] right right
[1:24:41] right you said well that's trying to
[1:24:44] justify no that's not justified that's
[1:24:46] just telling you standing
[1:24:48] right right we're standing here in a
[1:24:51] situation
[1:24:53] that we got to overcome that thought of
[1:24:55] our mind right amen right we got to
[1:24:59] overcome the point of thinking we don't
[1:25:02] have it
[1:25:05] right why brother around tell that man
[1:25:07] when he prayed for him that was
[1:25:11] blind
[1:25:13] right he told him he said go say in your
[1:25:17] heal
[1:25:19] right go tell everybody you can see
[1:25:22] right well now I don't want I don't want
[1:25:25] to
[1:25:26] lie because I'm still
[1:25:29] blind no you're a liar when you say God
[1:25:32] ain't already healed
[1:25:34] you don't worry about lying you're
[1:25:36] already a
[1:25:37] liar when you say God ain't healed you
[1:25:39] you're lying right CU my Bible says by
[1:25:42] Stripes I am already healed
[1:25:46] right I'm going to be right but he's
[1:25:50] waiting on me to say it right

[1:25:56] back you know and he said don't you told
[1:25:57] me i' healed he said are you

[1:26:09] or something didn't he a shave or
[1:26:11] something man was kind of breing light
[1:26:14] of him and don't you said you can see he
[1:26:16] said I can see about that time his eyes
[1:26:19] open he went running out in the street
[1:26:20] right hard and there everybody well now
[1:26:23] what if he hadn't said that
[1:26:26] right amen what if he hadn't said he
[1:26:29] could
[1:26:32] see he die
[1:26:36] blind
[1:26:37] right God's waiting on you and I you
[1:26:41] want to make him visible make his word
[1:26:43] visible that's it right there amen
[1:26:46] amen make his word to be word that
[1:26:49] there's no possibility of it failing
[1:26:53] amen amen that's right there's not no
[1:26:57] failures in this Bible right amen I told
[1:27:00] you show me one one time
[1:27:02] remember some was coming up with this
[1:27:04] one and some was coming up with that one
[1:27:07] I said show me one believer in the Bible
[1:27:08] has ever failed that's right
[1:27:11] am I said the greatest one I know of is
[1:27:14] Saul where he turned against God right
[1:27:18] he denied him gave went down to the
[1:27:20] witch of indor and all the things
[1:27:23] but I said after all was said and done
[1:27:26] when Samuel come up he said Saul you
[1:27:28] will be with me the day in paradise
[1:27:31] right he was not a failure amen theyve
[1:27:35] never been a believer in the Bible that
[1:27:37] was a failure but every believer has to
[1:27:39] confess it right you got to confess with
[1:27:42] your mouth what you believe in your
[1:27:44] heart
[1:27:46] right well I kind of believe sister Gale
[1:27:49] that we're in the end don't you now let
[1:27:51] me announce
[1:27:52] we are
[1:27:55] amen the government sure ain't got
[1:27:57] nothing to do with
[1:28:00] it they sure ain't help us right you to
[1:28:04] it like a brother said there the other
[1:28:07] day they got them camps waiting on us
[1:28:10] them old nuts and Fanatics up there in
[1:28:12] Alaska and all right they got places for
[1:28:18] us but you see they can't get us to God
[1:28:22] gets through with us right amen it can't
[1:28:25] bother us brother Mark until God gets
[1:28:27] through with
[1:28:28] us then when he gets to with us I ain't
[1:28:30] worried about
[1:28:34] it I remember one time reading a story
[1:28:37] about that these people were going to
[1:28:40] take some cattle or something they were
[1:28:42] going to
[1:28:44] Alaska horses and stuff like that you
[1:28:47] know and they they thought well man
[1:28:49] they'll freeze to death when we get
[1:28:51] there so so they spent a lot of time
[1:28:53] making them all great big coats and
[1:28:55] quilts and things to hang over the
[1:28:58] animals you
[1:28:59] know but you know by the time they got
[1:29:02] through marching them
[1:29:04] there they come to find out they didn't
[1:29:07] need no hair to put on right they'd
[1:29:09] already growed it real thick
[1:29:11] right and they could
[1:29:14] live see we just get in the way right
[1:29:19] amen and get our smart ly bored I don't
[1:29:24] know about board which board are you
[1:29:25] talking about well I done told you come
[1:29:27] on board pay your board cuz I'm bored
[1:29:29] with you that's
[1:29:32] enough the before and the after explains
[1:29:35] it the before back there the after we
[1:29:38] get out of here and what's in between
[1:29:41] God Almighty making himself manifest
[1:29:43] among the Bride of Jesus Christ in the
[1:29:46] end time get her to believe it
[1:29:50] right maam I just don't see it well that
[1:29:52] means you don't have it either right
[1:29:55] amen come on if you don't see it you
[1:29:57] don't have
[1:29:58] it right right so somebody comes along
[1:30:01] to you and start saying well I just
[1:30:03] don't see it well I say all right you're
[1:30:04] the number one you don't have
[1:30:07] it that's
[1:30:10] right amen he said well a lot of people
[1:30:13] said we have it don't have it no but
[1:30:15] there's a lot of people said we had it
[1:30:17] had it too
[1:30:19] right Martin Luther thought he had it
[1:30:21] mhm y right that's right he's a great
[1:30:25] Catholic
[1:30:26] priest he thought he had
[1:30:29] it but you know one day the Lord
[1:30:31] revealed to him the just shall live by
[1:30:33] faith you know he walked out of there
[1:30:34] and he didn't say what I used to have or
[1:30:37] anything he said I got it right that's
[1:30:40] right I like what the prophet said about
[1:30:43] what the scripture said this is
[1:30:47] that right this is that that was broken
[1:30:51] up
[1:30:52] all right if this ain't that let me say
[1:30:56] this till that get here that's right
[1:30:59] because if we don't say this that can't
[1:31:01] come that's
[1:31:02] right if we don't say we're healed we
[1:31:05] can't be healed right we don't say we're
[1:31:07] saved we can't be saved if we don't say
[1:31:10] we have the faith of the fathers we can
[1:31:12] never have it right
[1:31:17] amen and if we don't say that we're
[1:31:20] already changed
[1:31:22] it can never take
[1:31:25] place you mean you're going to say
[1:31:27] you're changed and standing here well
[1:31:29] you going to you tell me how it's going
[1:31:30] to come then come on pull pits open come
[1:31:33] on right amen it sure ain't going to
[1:31:36] come with our
[1:31:37] stupidity it's going to come by somebody
[1:31:40] saying it
[1:31:42] right somebody's going to speak it it'll
[1:31:45] take place that's right well the prophet
[1:31:47] of God is already spoken amen
[1:31:53] but he's waiting on somebody to say what
[1:31:55] he
[1:31:56] say like I've tried my best to preach to
[1:31:59] you how Joshua was Joshua told them
[1:32:02] people go down there and walk around
[1:32:04] them wall one time a day for seven days
[1:32:07] right he said then on the seventh day
[1:32:10] you walk seven times and keep your mouth
[1:32:13] shut until you finish that seventh time
[1:32:17] and said then turn around and face that
[1:32:19] wall you know where Joshua was at
[1:32:22] up on the hillside watch
[1:32:24] it you said that ain't in the Bible will
[1:32:27] you show me where he was against the
[1:32:28] wall it ain't in there
[1:32:31] either come on I'm too old to play with
[1:32:35] Words With
[1:32:36] You Joshua told him what to do when they
[1:32:39] done what he said do the walls came down
[1:32:42] right when Joshua told him what to do
[1:32:45] the walls never
[1:32:48] fail but when he told them what to do
[1:32:51] and they done what he said and shouted
[1:32:54] what he
[1:32:55] said those Great Walls of ground just
[1:32:58] opened up and they just went right down
[1:33:01] in the ground didn't crumble over just
[1:33:04] went right down in the
[1:33:08] ground after all is said and
[1:33:11] done everybody was glad Joshua said that
[1:33:14] wasn't
[1:33:14] it but you know what Joshua was glad
[1:33:18] that he had a group of people that could
[1:33:19] go down there and say what he said right
[1:33:22] amen that's all I've ever said about
[1:33:24] this message is this prophet of God is
[1:33:26] laying in the ground up here in
[1:33:27] Jeffersonville Indiana waiting on you
[1:33:30] and I
[1:33:32] right to reach that place in faith that
[1:33:35] can draw him out of that ground
[1:33:40] right now see everybody else got most of
[1:33:42] them got their hopes on he's going to
[1:33:44] come back and then he's going to do
[1:33:45] something for us well show me that in
[1:33:48] the scripture right well that's the
[1:33:50] great mystery I know it that's a mystery
[1:33:53] that I can't put to before and after the
[1:33:55] work bless
[1:33:57] him come on you know what I mean by that
[1:33:59] amen I can't say come on board pay you
[1:34:01] bored cuz I'm bored I can't say that cuz
[1:34:04] I can't find that in the Bible that he's
[1:34:06] supposed to come back and speak us a
[1:34:07] glorified body come on I thought your
[1:34:10] Prophet my Prophet said your glorified
[1:34:12] body was built around your Born Again
[1:34:13] experience
[1:34:16] right that's what he told us right if
[1:34:19] you want to call it speaking the body he
[1:34:21] he already done it right but you know
[1:34:24] what before the world Jesus Christ has
[1:34:26] already spoken right the invisible has
[1:34:30] become visible amen if you can see it
[1:34:36] right if you can see
[1:34:39] it but see we only deal with the same
[1:34:41] Ministry of Jesus Christ as talking
[1:34:44] about brother brandom with the gifts of
[1:34:47] discernments and the resurrection sign
[1:34:50] Etc well your Prophet covered the day of
[1:34:53] Pentecost as the ministry of Jesus
[1:34:55] Christ and he covered that the ministry
[1:34:57] of Jesus Christ would have to come again
[1:34:59] in the end time right as the faith of
[1:35:01] the fathers
[1:35:06] amen then we can walk off of this earth
[1:35:10] right he's going to become visible Among
[1:35:13] Us folks right right by the revealed
[1:35:17] word
[1:35:20] amen by the revealed word you tell me
[1:35:22] how else it's going to take place can't
[1:35:25] come on show me some other
[1:35:26] way give me a rabbit and hat trick or
[1:35:29] something to get us out of
[1:35:32] here but no it won't work that's why
[1:35:34] we've been here 40 something years
[1:35:35] that's right after the prophets come why
[1:35:40] because the people won't say what the
[1:35:41] prophet said that's
[1:35:43] right well yeah that's right brother
[1:35:45] that all right here in Lula

[1:36:18] God's word right cuz only in the
[1:36:21] revealed word can we come out to an end
[1:36:24] time right but only through the end the
[1:36:26] revealed word can we see the coming of
[1:36:28] the Lord is the revealing of his word

[1:37:30] nose and to see Jesus Christ is coming
[1:37:33] into our lives and our our beings right
[1:37:36] amen then when it gets closer we don't

[1:38:32] stuff he take his glasses off and lay
[1:38:34] them down boy he get down the world I
[1:38:35] said why in the world you wearing far he
[1:38:37] said I can't see I'm
[1:38:39] there right well I think that's our
[1:38:43] problem folks we can't see no further in
[1:38:45] the end of our nose oh my come
[1:38:47] on I believe the revealing of his word
[1:38:50] don't you right amen you say well
[1:38:53] brother Dale it can only be that we've
[1:38:57] got it
[1:38:58] intellectually now I want that explained
[1:39:00] that's all I want I want it explained
[1:39:03] that you can preach the mysteries of God
[1:39:06] listen I know the
[1:39:08] scriptures I know what it says that you
[1:39:11] can understand all Mysteries
[1:39:13] right now if you want to make me an
[1:39:15] unbeliever go right ahead because I'm
[1:39:18] going to say something to
[1:39:20] you
[1:39:22] Paul was not
[1:39:24] saying that you had a
[1:39:27] revelation of the
[1:39:31] Mysteries he was saying you had an
[1:39:34] intellectual
[1:39:37] concept he was not saying you could
[1:39:40] understand by
[1:39:41] Revelation the
[1:39:44] Mysteries he was saying you could have
[1:39:46] an intellectual
[1:39:48] conception right now because if you say
[1:39:52] he was saying you had a revelation you
[1:39:53] got a
[1:39:54] problem but you see sure I can stand up
[1:39:57] your name off I was thinking about it
[1:39:59] the other day and thought kind of how to
[1:40:00] bring a message to unbelievers you know
[1:40:03] I mean people that didn't believe and
[1:40:04] then you could explain this and explain
[1:40:06] this and explain this and explain this
[1:40:07] and explain this and explain that and
[1:40:09] you just keep explaining the things of
[1:40:10] the Bible Well I can do that
[1:40:13] intellectually sure can't right I knew
[1:40:16] that intellect amen after the prophet
[1:40:19] told me right
[1:40:21] right you see what I'm putting it after
[1:40:23] the prophet told me about these
[1:40:25] Mysteries we can now now down to the
[1:40:27] ages they couldn't explain the mysteries
[1:40:29] of the
[1:40:30] Bible now come on that's why I'm talking
[1:40:32] about the Alpha and
[1:40:34] Omega because he's visible here in the
[1:40:36] end time there was no part no down
[1:40:40] through there they couldn't explain the
[1:40:43] Mysteries right you show me they did
[1:40:45] they didn't do it they couldn't explain
[1:40:47] the
[1:40:47] Mysteries the Mysteries was to wait till
[1:40:50] the end time right but now I can tell
[1:40:52] you about the mistress cuz brother
[1:40:53] randam told me how to tell it y you know
[1:40:56] I can
[1:40:57] read that's right but now when it's
[1:40:59] revealed to you
[1:41:02] right amen you don't have to worry about
[1:41:05] it at all
[1:41:07] amen and the best way to do that is one
[1:41:12] thing and I know what you think so go
[1:41:15] ahead you find somebody that's got a
[1:41:18] revelation and let somebody try to
[1:41:20] explain to me Mysteries to
[1:41:23] it if you got a mystery of serpent seed
[1:41:26] revealed to
[1:41:27] you the letter of it will never do it
[1:41:31] right you'll go ground somewhere and
[1:41:34] I'll say hold on right
[1:41:36] there like I told a man at work one time
[1:41:39] I said go ahead and show me where I'm
[1:41:41] wrong but I said when you say something
[1:41:43] that's not right in the Bible I'm going
[1:41:45] to hold my hand
[1:41:48] up I said you got the opportunity to
[1:41:50] show me he had said two words and I had
[1:41:53] my hand up he just hushed didn't say no
[1:41:56] more what was I doing if you got a
[1:41:59] revelation of the Mysteries
[1:42:02] right you don't have an intellectual
[1:42:05] conception only right you know that's
[1:42:09] right that's why I'm not afraid of any
[1:42:11] quote on any subject that anybody brings
[1:42:14] me the prophet of God said it cuz like I
[1:42:17] gave you there where he says in one
[1:42:19] quote Alpha and
[1:42:21] Omega nothing in between then he said
[1:42:24] Alpha and Omega and everything in
[1:42:28] between now I say both of them's right
[1:42:34] amen how could that
[1:42:36] be
[1:42:39] because one he was explaining Christ
[1:42:41] through every age the other he was
[1:42:43] explaining that God was highly prevalent
[1:42:47] very visible among his first church age
[1:42:49] and down true for for a while and then
[1:42:51] becomes visible again in the end time
[1:42:54] right I gave you a bunch of quotes where
[1:42:56] your Prophet said that he'd be visible
[1:42:59] if you don't like them then you read
[1:43:01] them but see you say well I don't know
[1:43:03] about it let me give you a couple more
[1:43:05] that I didn't put
[1:43:06] in and then we'll
[1:43:10] quit message of paradox 19611
[1:43:14] 1210 and the
[1:43:16] words he's talking about John 1 one
[1:43:20] Jesus was the word the Bible says St
[1:43:22] John 1 Chapter and the words was visible
[1:43:26] now listen close the word was
[1:43:31] invisible now listen the word was
[1:43:35] invisible until it was made flesh
[1:43:39] right and then the word become
[1:43:43] visible think about
[1:43:45] that and through his sacrificial death
[1:43:48] at Calvary and his resurrection ction
[1:43:51] positionally placed his church in that
[1:43:54] real that the same invisible God could
[1:43:59] come into the individual and make the
[1:44:02] word
[1:44:04] visible
[1:44:06] right oh my I wish my church could get
[1:44:09] that amen if you could see friends the
[1:44:13] invisible God made visible right amen
[1:44:17] well see you can't see me if it's not in
[1:44:19] your heart is that right
[1:44:21] no man can call Jesus the Christ except
[1:44:23] it be by the Holy Ghost right not
[1:44:26] because you studied it some quotes or
[1:44:28] whatever listen to this one uh go AIT go
[1:44:31] await
[1:44:33] Jesus uh 63 11:30 the evening service
[1:44:37] you might not be able to open your eyes
[1:44:39] and see
[1:44:41] him because he's in spirit form right
[1:44:46] the invisible
[1:44:48] God but he dwells among among a visible
[1:44:52] people making him visible by his
[1:44:55] promised word in that people do you
[1:44:59] understand
[1:45:02] that dwells among his people making
[1:45:05] himself visible through the revealed
[1:45:10] word I'm looking CU I I didn't ended
[1:45:14] this I try to get it back you say well
[1:45:16] brother Dale aren't you looking for
[1:45:17] greater things to happen yes
[1:45:22] I believe it but it's only because you
[1:45:23] and I believe what we're talking about
[1:45:25] now right we don't believe where it is
[1:45:27] right now and get that straight and walk
[1:45:29] on then don't worry about it when it
[1:45:30] gets over there cuz you're going to
[1:45:32] laugh and make fun of people and say a
[1:45:34] that's just anointed
[1:45:38] ones I've taught you over and over and
[1:45:41] proved to you by the Bible and Prophets
[1:45:43] message it'll come a
[1:45:45] time when gainsayers will be shut
[1:45:49] up
[1:45:51] but it'll be too late for the gangs
[1:45:54] Sayer
[1:45:56] right it'll be too
[1:46:00] late which side are we going to be
[1:46:03] on well so so that's why I've always
[1:46:07] told you don't make no Li about somebody
[1:46:09] over in this church getting healed right
[1:46:11] a they just got emotional work up no
[1:46:13] don't make no light of that's the Holy
[1:46:14] Ghost if the person's ever healed God
[1:46:16] done the healing amen the devil can't
[1:46:19] heal you can't right that's
[1:46:23] right say thank you God right am I read
[1:46:28] in the paper where that that they had a
[1:46:31] uh somebody done this or pray a prayer
[1:46:33] and something happened I said Thank You
[1:46:35] Lord
[1:46:37] right why because he's God Amen he can
[1:46:41] appear and do things right but he coming
[1:46:44] is in Your Heart Right the coming in
[1:46:47] your heart is the revealing of his word
[1:46:49] right amen what else are you looking for
[1:46:51] that's
[1:46:54] right well it's just intelect I know
[1:46:56] what I've been called at bless you ask a
[1:47:01] brother to his face one day I said what
[1:47:03] do you think about me he said you ain't
[1:47:04] nothing but a
[1:47:07] Baptist you wouldn't if you didn't know
[1:47:09] what he's talking about what I was
[1:47:11] talking about you wouldn't know what's
[1:47:12] going
[1:47:13] on he said you just bring it by the
[1:47:17] letter you're just bringing the letter
[1:47:19] of the word
[1:47:22] man I said
[1:47:25] well if my letter is lined up better
[1:47:27] than your spiritual condition that's
[1:47:30] right I'll just stick with what I got
[1:47:33] right cuz at least where somewhere God
[1:47:36] can meet that's right and make it
[1:47:39] manifest amen because it's the fit
[1:47:43] the if the seed's not in the ground
[1:47:45] you're not going to get nothing that's
[1:47:47] right but you see what I'm talking about
[1:47:49] right he's going to become visible among
[1:47:52] us through the revealed word right sure
[1:47:55] I'm looking for healing and signs and
[1:47:57] wonders
[1:47:58] yes I cry and weep every day about my
[1:48:01] wife because that I didn't come to the
[1:48:03] place to lay hands on her for her to
[1:48:05] walk away from that or any of you that
[1:48:06] are
[1:48:09] sick and I condemn my own self not
[1:48:13] you that's one thing this man's never
[1:48:16] done is look back and said well now if
[1:48:17] we get straightened up we'd have it
[1:48:19] right around here l
[1:48:22] no it wouldn't help me a bit for him to
[1:48:24] get
[1:48:26] straight help him won't help
[1:48:30] me you blame everybody else for it just
[1:48:33] remember there's a God looking
[1:48:39] down
[1:48:42] see everybody wants to put it
[1:48:46] off all
[1:48:48] right but let must start saying it
[1:48:54] amen why can't we say it
[1:48:58] right cuz I'll show you when I get to it
[1:49:02] all of those appearing and coming the
[1:49:04] prophet spoke of was up until
[1:49:07] 1962 he never used that after
[1:49:11] them because no longer was he
[1:49:15] appearing nor neither was he
[1:49:19] coming
[1:49:21] that's why he would always say the
[1:49:24] seventh seal is his coming
[1:49:30] right you go back and check it it's his
[1:49:34] coming coming is a process taking place
[1:49:38] over a period of time
[1:49:40] right but the word come doesn't mean
[1:49:43] that right that's why your Prophet said
[1:49:45] he's here all
[1:49:48] right you know what God come down and
[1:49:50] proved it come on God come down and
[1:49:54] proved it well let's start saying he's
[1:49:58] here amen but you know what we gen wind
[1:50:00] up doing we're almost get killed in a
[1:50:02] car wreck we say God truly was with me
[1:50:05] well why can't we say God's with us all
[1:50:06] the
[1:50:07] time like a man told me one time and I
[1:50:10] said amen he said why I have to why do
[1:50:12] we have to wait to get sick to pray for
[1:50:14] God to to heal us he said why can't we
[1:50:18] say God keep me from getting getting
[1:50:22] sick what's wrong with
[1:50:24] it why can't you say God keep me from
[1:50:27] getting
[1:50:28] sick ask him to take care of
[1:50:35] you when are we going to start
[1:50:38] saying let me at least say what the
[1:50:40] prophet had to say he said he's visible
