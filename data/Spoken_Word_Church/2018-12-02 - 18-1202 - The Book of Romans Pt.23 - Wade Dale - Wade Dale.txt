========================================
brother yang sees interpreting for the for the brother is going to be here Wednesday night alright so now Romans 10 alright come on guys time not yours let's go Romans 10 brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved [Applause] cried the bear them record that they have a zeal of God but not according to knowledge become like this last week or less Sonny for they being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness right the law the Pharisees thought as long as they did the Ten Commandments and read the Torah and did what God said in the in the Bible well the Old Testament from the Bible that they were fine and they were until the god of the letter of the law stepped down in front of them when the god of the leg of the law step down in front of them then their righteousness couldn't be established anymore because it wasn't their righteousness anyway all right going about this now arises this is Paul talking and remember he's going to Rome but he's talking to the Jews but he's going to Rome to visit the people that are in Rome does I'm doing believe have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God in other words they turn Christ down the turn the embodiment of the word they turned him down all right before Christ at the end but see now I want to say that I want you to look at something now when I read being in the fifth seal which we're going to be talking about this afternoon not so much about that part I'm trying to get some the way first but God came to them first God came to the Jews first they were his people he gave them the promise to Oracle's to this the that he gave them everything they needed that what did they do they turned it down right they turned it down and they became they became not his wife anymore they tried to live by their own righteousness and God blinded their eyes so that the Gentiles could come in okay he literally blind them because look come on read the Old Testament the way we read the Old Testament we see Jesus Christ all through there right they prophesied Moses said I'll send a prophet like them to me a virgin's young and see all those things were written in the Old Testament it was not here they they they actually they rehearsed them every Sabbath day they would read a part of the Torah they would read a part of this it would read a part of that right but when the man came that Moses and all the prophets talked about these enough the current you know the car team Dell they said ladies blood be on us and our children and God said okay I knew you were going to do that but I knew I wanted a Gentile bride because like we were talking last night there's a lot of things that going put up with with the Jews because of this well what we're talking about last night in the Bible study we were talking about prayer lines and stuff and laying on of hands and all that brother Brown says 30 or 40 times that's a Jewish tradition that was given to the Jews because the Jews needed some kind of contact he said that's not even for the Gentile church he was pretty plain he said that wasn't even given for the Gentile church to you I mean have any kind of look even the angel Brown had the vision of the third pole what do they angel telling you explaining this thing away you're you're in like brother Brown said he said my success is not in playing on the fans even in the prayer lines he does call hardly does he lay hands he does he said I'll lay hands on if you want me to but what was his true message was the discernment when he turned away from that prayer line and started calling people 30 and 40 feet away and he says see I never touched you will see that and I'll cover a little bit after I don't know people to get like daddy said last night I hope everybody understood it was people were kind of talking but he said that light brother doubt like the God said or Jesus they'll be stranded in that and swallow camel you know we we pick one thing and we don't hear no more of a sermon if it goes against what we think every bit of it you forget the rest of it this is what I heard you say right you know so but I believe the paralyzing safety needed but now when we get into the seals when we get into the third pull the third clothes not laying on hands the third pole is not for airline the third twelve speaking the word that's why we got to come up to because it's a tradition even call we read it where he said we must go on perfection not laying again what baptism even says laying on a man's all those things like that we got to come up higher from that that's telling Jim that's not that's our tradition that's why everybody when you say that they go why because that's the way they've been taught since then we're a little child to have a prayer line and everybody shout and fall out and speaking comes and that's not even in the Bible they lay hands on people for the Holy Ghost but even I look to the quote last night or brother Branson that is in the Bible and we will lay hands on receive the Holy Ghost he said but he said when Paul was at the house of Cornelius while he was preaching the Holy Ghost fell on the pavement Joyce and all the laying on of hands it's believing the Word of God and that's what we got to get thick but we're saying last I like the way this church is built because it's built on you individuals doing your own pray now other churches you want what you look pastors leave her dive and look what churches did that school why because they built it all on one man they built it all having to get into brothers songs up well if he would have taught his people I've always said the reason Jimmy Carter wasn't successful he was a great man great man he didn't surround herself with good people he surrounded himself with a bunch of liars and cheats Ronald Reagan comes in and surrounds herself with good people and he likes them handling that's the greatest man is unless some honey helps do it you know that build your build your same way here builds your church to to let everybody believe I'm just that way I mean you just you just got to believe it and and like I said too before it just goes it's been raining for three days I have nothing God's mad at you right there's nothing to do with it that's nature if you motor blows up in your car you said well God must be mad at me times beat this thing well maybe if you need to speak it yeah you can but that's a car it's a mechanical piece of equipment forget it that's the devil playing in your head right right I mean come home and like laying on of hands see we we talk would take laying on of hands that's temporary that's temporary listen all them people brother branham pray for in all those years probably 99.9% of them are laying in the grave somewhere so the healing was temporary do good hallelujah praise God they live longer they have better life but they had nothing to do with body change this is what we're talking about we're talking about coming up to a level to where the body change is not going to be going through a prayer line or laying on of hands right it's going to be believing for your cell brother Dale will not speak your body into a glorified condition but he can preach it enough to where you can see it and then God will change your body by what you said right to me I'll say to me that's just that's just so simple everybody else you just depending on what's just how you been right it's just how you been right whatever all the thing for one week burst up in that's what's right the lake get out of that thing and then he's gonna give me the whole brook and you know what it done it just might a bunch of junk you can't get the Holy Ghost by that I'm sorry yeah I believe in that you can't get the whole ego so here we go preach the Holy Ghost until they get the Holy Ghost and they want to get to hold those then let God work you know but let's no let's don't you know you say well I lost my job for the glory of the Lord no you lost your job could you probably weren't doing right thing or they were changing and it was you out of your control right so I wouldn't brother Brad I'm saying the third pull is now laying dormant I got that cold at the house remember I preached on the third pole about ten years ago where the three poles here journey I preached that long time there and but one of them is speaking the word but it's if it's laying dormant now runner-up said the third pole is laying dormant so what's going to cause it it's not going to cause because you can go out and make thousand dollars a week and live in a nice house and have a nice car no it's going to happen when all that goes and anything what you got to do then you speak the word for something to eat then you speak to work for something a Great Dane you speak the word for something to go somewhere right now that's not going to happen I mean it will in a small mining point but we're trying to get everybody to a place to where our mentality is is we're not going to die we're going to have a body change that's going to come from what's inside of us about the word that we hear I mean look at Paul I said last night look at Paul Paul did not sit pretty picture Paul did not stand around and say oh I got 39 stripes again God must not be with me no he said I glory he said I glory in my infirmities why because he saw the people that he called flashbang be put to death because of him and he said whatever I get that's what I get that time let's don't base our our let's don't base our revelational circumstances a revelation can't be based on circumstances because God is going to reveal to you that you gonna take a body change but you're gonna be standing in a dead body you know what I mean the one that's this dying because even the 3040 days when the dead come out of the ground we're gonna be changed after that so if somewhere during that time we'll get a buddy change so we've got to believe to get them out of the ground get them a glorified body and then us come to a place to where that will transpire so it's a lot of things got to go on we just got it you know what I go back to what brother Clarke said though well the Bible says those who endure to the end shall be saved the only way you're going to know you make it is to endure to the end cuz we see people falling all over the place now but let's go be ignorant of God's righteousness and go about establishing our own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth believeth for Moses described the righteousness which is of the law that the man which do they stain shall live by them he's interpolating somewhere weird I miss that man it must be wailing are we under get back over on the other one you see the parentheses Lord of mercy did I miss it getting education we'll see there it says number six it's got a hole there in front there sorry but Moses ground the rocks would sit under laughs I don't further it would've been right thing the man was doing these things you live by them but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thy heart who shall descend into heaven that is to bring Christ down from above or who shall descend into paint that is to bring up Christ from the dead but what says it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart not just in your mouth but in your heart because out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh that is the Word of Faith which we preach then if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth not systems because because the your body can't do that your bodies just it's just as I was thinking the other day and let me just put this point in to that we a lot of people when I preach about them not worry don't worry about the bodies not anything to be a prevalent concern with here's an example what's the worst thing you can think of sister this is being a prostitute I mean you've defiled your body you've defiled your one hood and all those things but you can get born again you can get born again that has nothing to do the lady that was at the woman at the well had she had had five defilements and she was living with a man that was there in defilement then you understand what I mean defining the worst thing you can think of but she was safe but now you could take a virgin they lived to be 20 years old me deny God and she goes to hell so see it's not the body this thing okay it's what's inside but with the heart inside man believeth unto righteousness because there is no rocks code he's going to tell you in a little while there's no righteousness in this there is none this is not right this this was not rightness and there never will be rightness this thing I got because it come from mom and dad an act that was permitted by God after the fall to get me here so that I could believe with my heart under righteousness and you make that circle back again right that's what we're going back to we're going back to that part for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture says whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed but there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek what he brings them back together there's no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved you'd say well and everybody that calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved go back to the heart part God knows in your heart he knows your heart better than you knowing because he knows what your heart is gonna do the next day and the next day and the next day how shall they call on him who they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher because remember faith cometh by hearing listen there is there is zero chance of you getting born again if you not heard the word but you there's nothing at the judge there's nothing to judge that there's nothing there's nothing to convict you by the word is what convinced you inside you the word conviction you come under conviction because of the word not because of what grandpa said her grandma said I said many times before I wish I could save my kids mom tried to save me for 20-something years you can't do it there's no way but let God get a hold up the inside man see so I had not everybody called one name Lord shall be saved but the bible does say whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord let me interpolate with an honest heart shall be safe some people call them name of the Lord that's like we talked about you know people finding Jesus in jail you know you you go just up you go in jail then I begin to become four legs especially if you're on death row you know I mean really and some of them may be sincere but some of us not you know that about what the what life thing they had legal but see there again there's a law man murder if he gives his heart to God he gets born again he's just as clean as you are but he did that with his with his body that his body participated in what he did but the inside man was changed and cleaned out it was given a new heart that's what does equal sin I'll give you a new heart and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things see I preached a sermon you know about feet long time and that's why them the Bible always shows Jesus with the feet of brass because what is brass divine judgment but where does divine judgment come from the preaching of the word that's the divine judgment is the preaching of the word all right now beautiful and feeding them to preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who has believed our report in other words who has believed our report he has the same question who does believe that report so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God but I say have they not heard yes verily their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world but was it applied or was it taking them not always no but I say did not Israel no usual they should have known the Messiah was going to be they were looking for him to come the way the Bible said he came exactly that way I will provoke you to jealousy by them there are no people and by a foolish nation I will anger you all right when most by foolish nation I will anger you all those ayats but Isaiah is very bold and says I was found of them that sought me not I was found of them that sought me not us Gentiles okay Calise God they went look at my brother and said they we were not wheat he says we brings a whole Gentile nation he said we were not looking for my side wait a clue we not have a clue that there was no Messiah we were we were Romans we were Gentiles we were demons and gods and other gods and these gods and that God would you had one God they had that part right they just forgot then he was coming in human flesh but what happened though is we'll cover in the fifth seal God black had to literally put his hand over their eyes to keep them from seeing what was going on so you and I could come in here's nothing wouldn't be that break in that in that 70 weeks a day there had to be a break to get a Gentile bride but I think it's very potent I was found with him something on I almost made manifest unto them that asked not after me but to Israel he says all day long I have stretched forth my hand in other words for three and a half years I was among all of you and you turned me down you rejected me I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people and as to what the Jews are still known you know but you know what God is never gonna forget them come he said he went he told one they ran to look up count stars look down count the sands on the seat man try doing that you can Calahan Paul let's let's count the whole oceans to sand on the ocean beach that I'll not forget Israel I say then hath God cast away his people god forbid now see if you were listening let's go back to the example of money there if you heard that sermon from Paul you can pretty much so much that God has kicked the Jews out AHA right but you went listening to the whole thing I say then hath God cast away his people god forbid for I also AM an Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin he knew his lineage it was a Jew he knew his lineage but he knew that lineage was worthless in other words hey Paul was alive when Jesus was here he was alive somewhere he might have never met Jesus but he was alive if if Jesus died maybe 30 and Paul was in 1856 when he died and he was an older man he had to be either about the same age of Jesus or somewhere around that so he was there during the time but he missed the whole thing you know why this time remember he said I was born one out of new season or one hundred do time brother you should have been as well apostle how's that putting bag puts it right in there where he should have been that that 12th man but we know that can't happen because of what Paul had to do Paul had to take us to believe on Jesus Christ not believe only got standing there Jesus Christ believe on Jesus Christ that you have not seen right okay God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew we're gonna get to a little bit of their own fish sail because he he's gonna get white rose the people that didn't even want what about grace what you not that the scripture saith of Elias how he maketh intercession to guard against neutral same Lord they have killed the prophets and digged down thine altars and I am alone on that sequence but what's that the answer of God unto him this is kind of where I think went sunny a little bit more down through here kind of backed up for a minute cuz I want to cover that other but I have reserved to myself seven thousand men though not bowed the knee to the image of bail even so then it's this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace you know watch Paul st. Paul saying hey it looks bad out there in Israel but God has a has a group of people because remember one hundred twenty were Jews the three thousand were Gentiles 120 or Jew so God did come to the Jews and give him the whole girls person so he forget he used them to carry the gospel but knowing though that they'd be rejected looking at what I'm not killed for what they believe and if by grace then is no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace because what is great we'll get into that and fifth seal a little bit more grace is unmerited favor there is nothing you could do that's why I said grace cannot be something that man has developed running no way that has to be the sovereignty of God because you and I whether you the best Saint in the world you have a list of do and don't and they did and they didn't and they don't and they do and right that's right all right now I know how that grace is unmerited favor all that merit right here on that you've been looking up and saying up if this works grace is no effect now remember there was contention there with James and and Paul about this not between them but now where they say well it's gotta be my work I like my brother Brown he comes in preach works his face expressed okay so faith is see we that's why I said grace is something you and I that's why come to that fifth seal we have to be in the fifth seal to see sure we get grace every day the grace of God is what saved us but the grace of God when we get all these do's and don'ts and isms and all out of our out of our mind like we me and Jim were talking last night and I'll probably say this and getting trouble with it upstairs but laying on of hands and stuff like that that is that denominational idea that we got to get rid of if we gotta go on now then I'm not really all that brother I'm seven Son of Man will be revealed in a different form a different way so it's going to be different than anything we are well previously talked because the Son of man didn't in stream of demons remember he did not scream two things he that's why I said it we don't know if we don't know what the Son of Man is if you want to make a list though you meant to Mark Luke and John amazingly that's what the son of man is so that was him and he had screaming the demons but you know what he had bad days and good things right jesus wept Jesus cried over things wine that was the humanity part one day we'll talk about that because when we get trapped we're trapped in these first three dimensions when Wheatland when God done what he did and separated out of many more when Adam and Eve did what they did and God had to separate them he put us in this them in the first three dimension life like matter and we can't clean you outside of that we get in a fifth dimension if we die we get the sixth dimension if we die we can't get yourself a dimension until the glorified body comes fourth dimension is what you're seeing here Internet waves don't coming through this wall right now and that's the way God contacts us but that's the way the devil contacts so the same way so the fourth dimension we've tapped into but we can't what I'm saying is we can't go into the fourth dimension with this what we have so we're trapped in this dimension and there's certain things happen in this dimension that's why I'll read you two this afternoon rather I've never quoted it but he saved many many times when we come to that fifth seal that's in another dimension God had to take John into another dimension so you and I are gonna have to tap into another dimension to get out of here not the fifth dimension but the fifth seal all right we don't want to have been a fifth dimension and that's the senator day right but I keep telling you about the state's dimension in this dimension there's a buffer in there remember they the the Bible says there's a great gulf fixed you know when Lazarus wanted to talk to Abraham he said well I can't get to you and you can't get to make one that's a great dog Daisy was in one dimension and and Abraham then the other but they can see each other you come to a place where they can see each other so that's what you're gonna have to do this where brother Brown said daughter become so visible among this now we know the corporal body is not going to be in here but he's gonna be so visible among there is he gonna be visible in us yeah it us yes it's gonna be visible in us and then the rapture will take place then the body change and then the rapture will go all right so let's get back to grace to look um about a little bit of Stephanie grace is not great if there's one mark that you did something to give it then becomes work there I understand that it then becomes works because you can pin I did this to give this that's not grace grace is unmerited favor period that's what a man can't you can't fathom it but we can start believing it well the fifth seal is so important that's why I'm laps back under the word to the body change we got to see that it's not it's not this and it's not your bank account you don't matter if you got three cars for 30 to god that to remember that's in this dimension we're trapped in this dimension with life like matter and we have to do thank you yes we do because Jesus didn't have to do when you come into this dimension he had to eat he slept he had done the bathroom he had to do all the things that humans do and he was Almighty God and they hung on mighty God on a cross so let's get this thing out of our mind that we're coming to this sinless perfection to where see that's our problem our thought process is if I never get to a place I speak the word anybody ever cut me off on the road I'll just if my boss is giving me a bad day I'm just that's my brother Brown said power without character isn't Technic it's the power of God but if you don't have the character to use it he's not gonna give it to you because he knows what you gonna do it I read your quote today brother Brown talks about the power being in you to create a world and go live on it you have the power and he said if you're a born-again Christian you have the power tonight to go create a world and go live on it yourself yes but there's a lot what this dimension and the word but in this dimension you can't do that but we gotta do now this dimension we got in not what's going on right here we got a denied death because really close this is where only this is the only place where there is death you should know the fifth amended the state's dimension they have died from this dimension who went into that one right so the only death reigns in this dimension the first three lifeline member so we got to know that because it doesn't happen anymore else that's why I said we got a we got a long way to go and what we're going to get there we got to change our thinking from the old previous and brother that was gonna preach at this morning that horse forehead is the nomination though idea is that you and I have not been people over there cross the road that we have right so he'll get to this afternoon I hope it kind of melt meld them with what I'm sure it will but if it's it works then it's no more grapes otherwise work is no more work what then Israel have not obtained that week what that which he seeketh for but the election has the painted and the rest were blanket we attain to were the elect is for was the elect but they were blinded look interpolating the rest were blinded and if you take that out put it unto this day well now Paul is gonna explain why according and is written so it goes back to the Word of God and God had given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears if they should not hear because they saw God in human flesh they excuse me they heard God in human flesh but they turned him in actually they called him an L right see that's what I mean we if you read that about the son of man he was so much human till they call them enamel they said you're a wine-bibber you only hang around prostitutes and sinners they call them belzebub why because they had their preconceived idea of what God supposed to be like what he didn't fit one criteria they had on their little list he had fit one he was so far away from that list till they called him the devil but he was all money God that's what I'm telling you we need to throw away our lists don't weigh our lists and give back and see the grains he got to give it unto this day and David said let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumbling block and recompense them to them that their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back alway Paul says I say then have they stumbled that they should fall god forbid you read - have they stumbled that they should fall god forbid they thought later stumble but rather through their fall through their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy now if the fall of them be the riches of the world look like and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles how much more their focus in other words the Gentiles are going we got this this this this this this this this this this I mean the juice we got this Gentiles just said we believe you was my son what did they have to go on that's why the Gentile iced wine of God loved the Gentiles when he spoke to that Gentile that Centurion didn't need he didn't know nothing about the law nothing but he said I perceive you're a man of authority he said I'm a man of authority in other words if I say go they go if I say come they come what was he saying sir I see something in you called Authority if you say go demon it goes if you say coming comes whatever you speak not touch whatever you speak it'll happen so he said that found on faith and therefore Wankel they always need to lay on hands I don't mean the touching and the shaking and the throwing and all that stop you right you got to get away from them now to follow them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles how much more their fullness excuse me for I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am NOT the apostle of the Gentiles I magnify my office for I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am the apostle times it not does sorry it is much that's why I looked out though he what do you say that as much as I am that thank you sister bless you as much as I am that's my wife that's okay she keeps me straight across to me as much as I am the apostle of the Gentile I'm going to find another now that don't mean he exalted itself no he's telling the truth he went to the Jews the Jews civil they don't know this so he goes to the Gentile so he's now the Apostle and he's setting up he's fixing to go to the Romans they're Gentiles I magnify my office if by any means I may provoke to emulation whatever English jealousy then which are my flesh Jews and might save some of them he's still tried when he said long I turn to the Gentiles that man could you walk up said I'm gonna be baptized name of Jesus Christ and I want to be saved he said now you're G got it now they came in to write quite after casting away of them be the reconciliation of the world watch out the receiving of them but life from dead don't know where she's not kicking them out and look we must be real careful we we don't want to keep anybody out we that's not our job we preach on a denominational idea that's wrong not to people right but now the people become that that's their business but you can't do anything about that so we don't preach hands to people they're there you know what like say the more sincere than we are most of the time but they've been caught in a system that's false this up the devil okay but they've been caught in there because my brother Graham said they're worshipping the devil thinking they're worshiping God that's the worst deceit there is that's time way with you enough but for the casting way that may represent the worst one students in the okay 480 first-fruit be holy the lump is also holy and the root be holy so other branches now what's he saying remember we were grafted in that olive tree is Israel it's alive he's not gonna forget her we were just grafted in I like to graft it in part in the 70 weeks of Daniel you got 70 weeks of Daniel there's your tree then all of a sudden God brought in the middle of it he grasped in the Gentiles the wild olive branch into the tree the trees are alive it's what he's saying right here great the first fruit be holy their holy people the Jews the lump is also hoping and if the root be holy store the branches they just didn't get crops like wheat Gotti but they will come to the fifth seal in the sixth seal they get him again 144,000 and the ones that were Jews they've got their lot ropes just because lured youth get in and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree us were grafted in among them and with them for take us of the root and fatness of the olive tree boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou bear'st not the root but the root thee so the life comes from root that will say then the branches were broken off that I might be grafted in let's talk about saying let's go woman that's active Owens because of unbelief they were broken up yeah those yeah well I'm gonna work they be my coming later do you find the books of the Bible in this paragraph
