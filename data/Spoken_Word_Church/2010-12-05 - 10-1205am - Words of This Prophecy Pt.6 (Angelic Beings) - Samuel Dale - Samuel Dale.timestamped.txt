[41:06] we love you and we thank you and jesus
[41:08] is your name amen
[41:15] uh revelations one
[41:17] we've been reading this and then we'll
[41:20] go to hebrews 1.
[41:23] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[41:25] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[41:28] things which must
[41:29] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[41:32] signified it by his angel unto his
[41:34] servant john
[41:36] who by record of the word of god and the
[41:38] testimony of jesus christ and of all
[41:40] things that he saw
[41:42] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[41:44] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[41:47] those things which are written therein
[41:49] for the time
[41:50] is at hand
[41:52] now i wrote in my bible a long time ago
[41:55] the time to understand
[41:58] you know
[41:59] all right hebrews
[42:01] one verse 13 and 14.
[42:08] but to which are the angels said he at
[42:11] any time
[42:13] sit on my right hand until i make nine
[42:15] enemies thy footstool
[42:18] now he's going to tell you what angels
[42:19] are all right
[42:21] are they not all ministering spirits
[42:24] sent forth to minister for them who
[42:26] shall be heirs
[42:28] of salvation you may be seated lord that
[42:31] is blessing to the reading of the word
[42:36] now we
[42:37] took a couple of services i had to
[42:39] that's just an extra edition and some of
[42:42] them blank on the back so i just had
[42:44] to jump up and run them in and and uh
[42:48] when i do that sometimes it
[42:50] you know gets everything to go and we've
[42:52] got some new copiers coming to the house
[42:54] and i'm planning on
[42:55] getting some one of these
[42:57] uh
[42:58] uh
[42:59] coffee machines and put it to the house
[43:00] one of these days
[43:02] and i can do it at home
[43:03] and i don't have to come here and and
[43:05] try to run things off
[43:07] but my problem is is i run something off
[43:10] and i think of something else and i run
[43:12] it in and i run something run that off
[43:14] and think of something else and you know
[43:16] i'm so thrilled for the computer system
[43:19] that we can you know be able to
[43:23] handle those things and pull up quotes
[43:25] in a hurry
[43:27] all right but now we've been talking
[43:29] about
[43:32] and we spoke a couple of services and
[43:33] labeled it you know the words of this
[43:35] prophecy but put a subtitle to it or
[43:37] talking about
[43:39] uh angels or his angels
[43:42] his angel or his angels
[43:45] and uh i just want to speak today
[43:50] on that line because
[43:52] i want to make sure that we understand
[43:56] you know
[43:58] and we'll read in a little bit what
[43:59] brother branham had to say
[44:01] about the way people
[44:03] kind of believe and sometimes i wonder
[44:05] if that's our way of believing that uh
[44:08] you know we just say
[44:10] well it's just
[44:12] the holy spirit
[44:15] well
[44:18] you know
[44:19] you say well i'm not concerned about all
[44:21] these other things well
[44:23] it may be because you're not concerned
[44:25] about being visited by angels
[44:28] and uh you know that may be the concern
[44:30] of it
[44:31] you know
[44:32] so i want us to just
[44:35] kind of think about it
[44:41] you know we're real quick to use like
[44:43] brother branham as an angel and there
[44:46] are early angels
[44:48] and they're heavenly angels all right
[44:51] and then you've got the holy spirit
[44:54] which is an angel
[44:56] and then you've got christ that you can
[44:58] cover as an angel
[45:00] you've got a lot of things to be doing
[45:02] so we're going to just title this
[45:04] message
[45:05] um words of this prophecy number six but
[45:07] just put
[45:08] angelic beings
[45:11] angelic beings because that's what we
[45:14] want to talk about in other words try to
[45:16] take an overall view and and look at it
[45:19] as to what maybe that would help us
[45:23] and uh
[45:24] you know i told you that this is not an
[45:26] argumentative
[45:27] thing
[45:28] uh about whether or not it was brother
[45:32] random that came to john on patmos
[45:35] because that's what a lot of people
[45:37] believes and that's all right that's
[45:38] what you believe that's all right
[45:41] you know i'm not gonna argue with you
[45:43] about it
[45:44] uh i'm just gonna
[45:46] you know try to do what i can to preach
[45:48] the gospel
[45:49] but still ill regardless now
[45:53] if that was brother branham or he is
[45:55] brother branham or shall be brother
[45:57] branham or whatever they you know
[45:58] there's different versions of what that
[46:00] will be
[46:01] john was translated over into this and
[46:04] saw this or her brother random come to
[46:06] john
[46:07] this happened and everything
[46:09] i'm not
[46:10] as concerned about that
[46:13] as i am to try to be concerned about
[46:17] um
[46:20] when the boy says he has a copy machine
[46:22] in the store i have if it's a small one
[46:25] we'd do all right we got one years ago
[46:27] but it never did work work nothing but
[46:29] you know so
[46:31] but now
[46:33] my point is this
[46:37] it's not being concerned about who come
[46:39] to
[46:40] john my concern is who come to brother
[46:44] brown
[46:45] amen
[46:46] because it's not promised
[46:48] then as a way of brother branham coming
[46:52] to john as people want to believe he's
[46:55] going to do or has done or whatever you
[46:57] know
[46:58] uh
[47:00] it's i'm not concerned about that
[47:01] happening to me and you
[47:04] see he did come to our day in the times
[47:06] and we have the books the tapes et
[47:07] cetera fine you know
[47:09] but
[47:10] i believe the same one
[47:15] that come to brother branham
[47:18] must come to you and me
[47:21] all right now that won't make us
[47:23] prophets
[47:24] as brother branham
[47:26] that will make us whatever god has in
[47:28] need of
[47:30] whether it be for you sisters to teach
[47:32] your children to teach whatever the
[47:34] younger whatever
[47:36] whether it be the house cleaner to clean
[47:39] up the church the you know the the
[47:42] uh tape recorder uh recording situations
[47:46] the internet
[47:47] the things the trustees the the deacons
[47:50] etc or whether it be the ministers
[47:54] that minister unto us
[47:56] the
[47:57] the main thing is i want to do is to
[48:00] make sure that we can
[48:01] hold that to see
[48:03] the truth of the hour that we're living
[48:05] in the basis of
[48:07] who's going to come to me and you
[48:11] and god uses people
[48:13] we believe in that that you'll see me
[48:15] keep emphasizing that
[48:17] that
[48:18] in in the word angel can mean messenger
[48:22] all right
[48:24] now
[48:25] and see
[48:26] and just being a minister
[48:28] i'm a messenger
[48:30] with a message to be brought to you
[48:32] think all right then you will become the
[48:36] angelic beings who take
[48:38] this message
[48:40] and and carry it out to others
[48:43] see it's god's way of doing things
[48:46] and if you don't you don't get nothing
[48:48] out of the message now get this point
[48:51] no matter what you call angelic beings
[48:54] now we're talking about true ones not
[48:56] the ones that failed
[48:57] now brother random um
[49:00] questions and answers on genesis
[49:03] he covers that how those fallen angels
[49:06] can come down
[49:07] and inhabit us now not as josephus and
[49:10] them thought it come down and press
[49:12] themselves into human flesh that way no
[49:15] but as to come down and can give you and
[49:17] me of nature
[49:19] you know
[49:20] so we got to deal with that you know we
[49:22] had that
[49:24] those fallen angels gave us the nature
[49:26] whether we wanted or not
[49:28] you know
[49:29] and everybody has a different nature
[49:31] about it
[49:33] we're not all natured the same it's not
[49:35] it's not that awake we're we're
[49:37] different people
[49:38] you know but we've got to deal with
[49:40] trying to overcome but the main point i
[49:42] want to see is those angels that didn't
[49:44] fall
[49:46] now those angels that didn't fall
[49:48] the prophet says can come down and lead
[49:50] you and i
[49:52] and guide us
[49:54] those are the ones that i'm concerned
[49:55] about
[49:57] the others i'm not uh i'm not concerned
[49:59] but i want to get rid of them don't you
[50:02] you know i want a nature change
[50:05] and that's what we all should want
[50:08] and i believe even though you you get
[50:09] born again you still have problems with
[50:12] yourself
[50:13] but the statue of a perfect man should
[50:15] take away a lot of the problems or at
[50:17] least a while in this message you want
[50:18] to take away some problems you know you
[50:20] don't uh uh like richard and i were
[50:23] talking while we were doing hunting and
[50:25] i i just told him i said now richard if
[50:27] i've got to tell you your troubles
[50:30] you got troubles
[50:35] brother anderson if i've got to tell you
[50:36] you're troubled you know what you got
[50:38] trouble
[50:40] because you're not seeing your own sales
[50:42] right
[50:42] now
[50:45] i mean that's the way we are to look at
[50:46] anything that's right
[50:48] we see ourselves and then we work on
[50:50] ourselves but you know what we see we
[50:52] see other people
[50:53] and we want to work on other people
[50:55] you know
[50:56] my angel needs to go over the weight and
[50:58] help him out you know
[51:00] you know i'm going to have to apologize
[51:02] to mine when i get there
[51:04] i've always told you that i kind of
[51:06] believe that god probably had to give me
[51:08] two of them
[51:10] and you say well that's funny no it's
[51:12] not funny because i do believe in that
[51:14] and we'll get to it in a minute
[51:16] but now
[51:18] the i'm concerned about who come to
[51:20] brother branham right because the one
[51:24] that come to brother brown by way of him
[51:26] speaking it then thereby can come to you
[51:29] and me
[51:32] and that that's why i believe the
[51:33] message like i do all right
[51:35] but now
[51:36] brother branham i gave it to you page 13
[51:38] of the church age book
[51:40] i put these on a lot of them because
[51:42] that way they're going on the internet
[51:44] system and and you know and people can
[51:47] read them
[51:48] that one from kenya today uh thanking us
[51:51] for the
[51:52] the stand we make on the message and
[51:54] and things like that we're just one word
[51:57] you know
[51:58] like that helps me because we realize
[52:00] somebody out there heard and maybe they
[52:02] want to follow some more yeah but
[52:04] brother ran them on
[52:05] page 13 in the church age book he said
[52:08] that this was the only book in the bible
[52:12] whereby jesus coming
[52:15] to a scribe
[52:16] you know huh
[52:19] he comes to the scribe to write the word
[52:21] okay
[52:22] appear in there all right
[52:24] now
[52:25] we covered that
[52:30] we covered one point to me that is very
[52:32] valuable
[52:33] even though an angel a prophet
[52:36] even though the lord jesus christ
[52:40] appeared to people
[52:43] that didn't reveal a thing to him
[52:47] while he was here on earth
[52:49] he couldn't reveal anything
[52:52] he said well what do i mean
[52:54] you just take away all of our head
[52:56] knowledge
[52:57] no i'm not taking away no his knowledge
[53:00] you gotta have head knowledge
[53:03] you don't have head down this you don't
[53:04] have heart knowledge
[53:06] but my point is just like brother brown
[53:09] says and i i've quoted these so i
[53:10] thought well i'll put them on to make
[53:12] sure
[53:13] right around and said it on page two on
[53:14] your notes sir uh page 38 christ mr god
[53:17] revealed that jesus said my own life
[53:22] did not reveal that unto you peter
[53:27] then he goes down to page 47 of the
[53:29] christmas mystery he said the holy ghost
[53:31] is the only
[53:33] revealer of the word
[53:36] huh now he's the only revealer
[53:40] is no man can reveal anything to you
[53:44] well brother adam revealed this the man
[53:46] i told you before separated from me
[53:48] because i said i believe i had a
[53:50] revelation and he said
[53:52] i don't have no revelation my revelation
[53:54] brought around got a revelation well
[53:57] i just couldn't understand that language
[53:59] because i said i had a revelation he
[54:01] said he had a revelation
[54:03] he just said his revelation was that he
[54:05] didn't have no revelation
[54:06] well that's still a revelation
[54:09] so it didn't convince me of anything it
[54:11] was just you know
[54:13] and i put mine and you know where the
[54:15] quotes are at
[54:17] so you know i don't
[54:18] try to tell you just what i think if i
[54:20] do i'll be glad to tell you this is what
[54:22] i find
[54:24] no problem all right
[54:26] now
[54:28] but even if brother branham could speak
[54:31] to you personally
[54:33] we were talking last night about some
[54:34] things and and i encourage you to to uh
[54:38] tell me about your your lives and your
[54:41] things and your testimonies and and
[54:43] we've never really as long as i've been
[54:45] around joyce i've never heard her say
[54:47] what she said last night and i
[54:49] thoroughly enjoyed it
[54:50] and she said i sat and saw the prophet
[54:54] i saw the things that happened said even
[54:57] as a a child a teenager young child
[54:59] coming up she said i love to be in that
[55:02] presence and we go for three or four
[55:04] meetings or something a weekend and said
[55:06] i didn't want to go home
[55:10] but see that was just a child because
[55:11] there was such a
[55:13] presence and and things there that would
[55:15] be you know but then she said
[55:19] one day
[55:21] the lord spoke to her
[55:24] see that's worth it all right
[55:26] see it's worth it all right but that way
[55:28] it settles immediately i told her i said
[55:29] yep peter said i have a more sure word
[55:32] of prophecy
[55:33] even though he was dire with the lord
[55:35] jesus walked with him for three and a
[55:37] half years got to go up on the mount he
[55:39] was chosen basically every time to go
[55:42] with the lord as to whatever to do
[55:44] because peter james and john faith hope
[55:45] charity or how you love or whatever it
[55:47] did
[55:48] he was chosen to go
[55:51] but he said i have a more sure word of
[55:52] prophecy he had a new birth
[55:55] that's what we need
[55:57] is the new birth because the new birth
[55:59] is the only revealer in the world
[56:01] if we don't have the holy ghost see then
[56:04] then that's the problem all right
[56:06] but now
[56:09] even though the angel could come to john
[56:11] now we're back over in chapter one now
[56:13] not over in chapter 22. we ain't know
[56:16] whether yet so just don't go over there
[56:18] and run over that away so far just stay
[56:20] with me
[56:22] we read here in our scriptures in
[56:24] revelations 1
[56:26] that god give a
[56:28] revelation to an angel
[56:31] he gave it to jesus to give to an angel
[56:34] all right
[56:35] then
[56:36] that angel reveals the whole book to
[56:39] john
[56:43] so now
[56:44] this angel here
[56:46] in chapter one
[56:48] now that i'm quoting brother random i've
[56:50] got to quote flynn on the desk
[56:52] that did
[56:54] where that angel revealed the entire
[56:56] book
[56:59] now
[57:00] if we don't get that in order of the
[57:02] right way then we will have the wrong
[57:04] time but remember chapter one my point
[57:08] all right everybody got the point of
[57:10] making
[57:12] even though that angel was assigned a
[57:15] specific thing to do
[57:17] to come to john to tell him
[57:21] yet still
[57:22] that angel had to step backward
[57:25] because when he's doing it the lord
[57:27] jesus steps on the scene
[57:30] if any angel or ever who it is comes to
[57:32] you
[57:34] remember galatians 1 8 faces the angel
[57:37] because it says in galatians 1 8 that if
[57:40] an angel come from heaven
[57:43] and run around emphasizes not just an
[57:45] earthly thing but some great big thing
[57:47] happened
[57:48] some angel out of heaven come to you
[57:51] said
[57:52] if you see anything contrary to the word
[57:53] leave it alone
[57:55] because i didn't send him
[57:57] all right
[57:58] see this angel that come to john here
[58:00] to reveal it to john
[58:04] is there any difference in that angel
[58:06] that come in revelations 1 or the one
[58:08] that you would speak of
[58:10] later on throughout the bible
[58:12] or later on until you come to the um
[58:17] chapter 22
[58:20] who brought around you said the angel
[58:21] come
[58:24] all right
[58:25] but now we found out that jesus stepped
[58:27] on the scene to vindicate what this
[58:29] angel was saying he didn't just stay
[58:31] back that's why i loved god so much when
[58:33] brother around made that statement one
[58:34] time and i love to say it
[58:37] he said even though god knew we sinned
[58:39] and what was going to take place he said
[58:41] he didn't stay up in heaven
[58:43] said he come down
[58:45] to live with us on earth
[58:48] now i love that
[58:50] because you know
[58:52] we're involved
[58:54] you see even though that angel
[58:57] would come to bring the message the
[58:59] emphasis is laid up on jesus coming
[59:05] all right
[59:06] now i know the quote when we get over
[59:08] there 22 don't worry about it i'm
[59:10] got them lined up you know i know
[59:12] brother brown said they said brother was
[59:14] that jesus that come to john he said no
[59:19] he said he's one of the prophets i know
[59:21] that
[59:24] see
[59:25] but here in chapter one
[59:28] jesus comes on the scene now i don't
[59:31] believe he came to john on patmos
[59:34] as jesus standing there
[59:37] in a corporal
[59:39] 16 element body you may believe that i
[59:41] don't think you'd be any problems either
[59:43] way whatever you want to believe but i
[59:44] just personally don't believe that
[59:47] i believe he came to him
[59:50] then
[59:52] as to show him
[59:56] something that we spoke of wednesday
[59:58] night
[59:59] all right
[1:00:01] now in doing that
[1:00:07] when it comes down to what you see in
[1:00:09] chapter one
[1:00:10] brother said that was not a prophet
[1:00:16] we brought that out wednesday
[1:00:19] he said that was god
[1:00:21] that come to john
[1:00:23] in chapter one
[1:00:24] because it's revealed
[1:00:26] as the alpha and amiga i want you to
[1:00:29] know who i am brother around said before
[1:00:31] we go any further
[1:00:32] he said red letter that he's speaking
[1:00:35] in the entire writings of
[1:00:37] chapter two and three which is about the
[1:00:39] seven church ages he's in red letter
[1:00:42] which means that jesus is
[1:00:44] speaking so he's personally coming to
[1:00:46] john now
[1:00:48] he said well now that this gets
[1:00:50] confusing you got angels and you got
[1:00:52] jesus and you got that
[1:00:54] how would you like a quote where brother
[1:00:56] brown said when i got into senior notes
[1:01:00] where he said now there's a difference
[1:01:02] in the holy spirit in that angel
[1:01:04] he said the holy spirit is real sweet
[1:01:09] he said but there's just an aw when an
[1:01:11] angel comes
[1:01:12] now is he making greater than jesus
[1:01:14] come on
[1:01:16] then i ask you the question why was it
[1:01:18] around him with that angel all his life
[1:01:20] why did that angel not tell him about
[1:01:22] the seal right
[1:01:26] until never said now
[1:01:28] that's right
[1:01:29] that's what we want to deal with when we
[1:01:31] get there all right
[1:01:32] see
[1:01:33] there was an angel to each church age
[1:01:35] right
[1:01:36] amen until the angel of the church of
[1:01:39] ephesus under the anger but those were
[1:01:41] what now
[1:01:44] men
[1:01:45] right
[1:01:47] now
[1:01:48] as we'll get to it in a second then each
[1:01:50] one of those men
[1:01:54] that were messengers et cetera
[1:01:57] you know people
[1:02:00] paul iranius martin clumbo you know
[1:02:02] luther westbrook
[1:02:05] each one of those men had an angel
[1:02:16] and that's what people you know
[1:02:18] they either go one way or the other
[1:02:19] about it they either deny angels and
[1:02:22] they say well it's just the holy spirit
[1:02:25] or they'll go over the other way you
[1:02:26] know and they want to put angels over
[1:02:28] everything
[1:02:30] and if you notice christmas has got the
[1:02:32] angel out there now
[1:02:34] and her name is gloria
[1:02:38] and all of your scenes now
[1:02:40] they got a female angel well now brother
[1:02:42] brown said if you need that quote i'll
[1:02:44] be glad to run it up rank this afternoon
[1:02:47] he says no such things female angels
[1:02:51] he said when our angels don't have no
[1:02:54] gender see you'll be quick to say that
[1:02:56] all right but remember angels that are
[1:02:59] dealing with us have a gender
[1:03:01] that's why women don't preach
[1:03:05] right
[1:03:07] because you can't be classified in that
[1:03:09] form as an angel to be able to qualify
[1:03:11] as an angel minister
[1:03:16] i just try to put things down you know
[1:03:19] simple and everybody claims i'm so deep
[1:03:21] and whatever but i
[1:03:22] i just try to put it simple enough for
[1:03:25] the children to understand
[1:03:28] and the children would understand that
[1:03:29] and say well now
[1:03:30] we don't believe in female angels
[1:03:35] if there's going to be an angel and
[1:03:36] something comes to you
[1:03:38] you know
[1:03:39] my brother around him i got a quote in
[1:03:40] there he said people lay on it the
[1:03:42] angels come to them but if one comes
[1:03:45] into you floating around with wings all
[1:03:47] over the place
[1:03:48] you know
[1:03:50] that's out
[1:03:54] but then if one comes to you that's a
[1:03:56] female angel
[1:03:58] i'd advise you to
[1:04:00] get up and leave the room or do
[1:04:01] something right because you don't get
[1:04:03] hold the wrong time
[1:04:05] and you remember what brother branham
[1:04:06] said about who was it martin am i right
[1:04:08] that when satan came to him
[1:04:12] and if martin hadn't known the word
[1:04:14] do you know that satan was dressed
[1:04:16] identically according to what the word
[1:04:19] would eventually come to
[1:04:24] now you go back and check it
[1:04:26] will it not be a day come when jesus
[1:04:28] will have a crown do we not crown him
[1:04:31] satan come to him there with a crown on
[1:04:33] his head but see it clinton martin
[1:04:36] the saints one day will crown you
[1:04:40] so you're not supposed to have one now
[1:04:43] see if he hadn't knowed the word
[1:04:45] brother around said good pentecostal
[1:04:47] bait
[1:04:50] that's the way it is for the people this
[1:04:51] message isn't it some guy come along
[1:04:53] especially a young guy he jumps up and
[1:04:55] boys firing he's running he's going and
[1:04:57] people are just running all over the
[1:04:58] country following them and you know
[1:05:04] you don't even know what to say
[1:05:07] but let's go on
[1:05:09] so we see then the
[1:05:11] the church age messenger is an angel
[1:05:15] but if that church aged messenger
[1:05:18] and of course we know he was born again
[1:05:19] or he would have been the church age
[1:05:20] messenger right
[1:05:22] sensible
[1:05:23] i mean he had to be born again he
[1:05:25] wouldn't be the messenger
[1:05:26] run around with a choke somebody wasn't
[1:05:28] born again said we'll put him in our
[1:05:29] lane no no no that wouldn't have been
[1:05:32] nothing all right
[1:05:34] we see each church age got an angel
[1:05:38] and that angel fits in and we'll get to
[1:05:40] it in a minute we're only to redeem our
[1:05:41] angels and we'll read that but i want
[1:05:43] you to think about what it's saying
[1:05:46] in hebrews 1.
[1:05:50] especially verse 14
[1:05:53] and it tells you about these angels
[1:05:56] it says they're ministering spirits
[1:06:02] sent forth
[1:06:04] listen
[1:06:06] to minister
[1:06:09] for them
[1:06:11] who are the heirs of salvation
[1:06:15] now you can see why we're going down in
[1:06:16] the
[1:06:19] number four on your notes we're brought
[1:06:20] around said
[1:06:22] only
[1:06:23] the redeemed of angels
[1:06:29] all right
[1:06:30] it's only redeemed to have angels
[1:06:34] everybody in the world don't have one
[1:06:37] now they may have the bad angels okay
[1:06:41] all right
[1:06:42] you with me
[1:06:44] they can have the bad angels
[1:06:46] they give us the nature yeah
[1:06:49] but when it comes to the good side
[1:06:52] they only have the only the redeemed of
[1:06:55] angels
[1:06:56] he said well now what about the little
[1:06:58] kids and the things like that now i'm
[1:07:00] not going to argue with you on that
[1:07:02] because i'm just plainly going to tell
[1:07:04] you because i gave you the quote we're
[1:07:06] right around them on page or 836 number
[1:07:09] five on your notes resurrection lazar 53
[1:07:11] 11 22. that everyone has a guardian
[1:07:14] angel
[1:07:15] now i don't believe everybody in the
[1:07:16] world has a guardian angel
[1:07:18] he said well you're denying right around
[1:07:20] now i'm taking the blood around him is
[1:07:22] telling you only the redeemed of angels
[1:07:26] now little children
[1:07:28] it's up to god to take care of him
[1:07:31] and i believe he does
[1:07:33] but let's don't deal with that
[1:07:35] let's worry about me and you
[1:07:38] we're not we're not little children all
[1:07:39] right let's think about me and you see
[1:07:42] that only the redeemed have angels all
[1:07:44] right now all the church age messengers
[1:07:47] are not sent to the world
[1:07:52] now their message condemns the world
[1:07:54] right
[1:07:56] but don't show me that the church is
[1:07:57] messenger sent to the world no he's not
[1:07:59] sent to the world he sent to the bride
[1:08:02] right
[1:08:03] now his message condemns the world
[1:08:06] right now are you with me his message he
[1:08:08] brings automatically condemns the world
[1:08:11] but the message he come to bring
[1:08:14] the that's where we'll get into it later
[1:08:16] with brother branham
[1:08:18] when
[1:08:18] that he has to do one work here and then
[1:08:21] something else has to take place
[1:08:24] and you'll see that he can be out he
[1:08:26] could be then not the messenger to lady
[1:08:29] ocean
[1:08:31] because the one-eyed black man was that
[1:08:32] messenger to lay your seal but he could
[1:08:34] come in lady oseah and rebuke him them
[1:08:40] and bring the message to you and i will
[1:08:42] get to that
[1:08:43] and they will tie together with
[1:08:44] something i said over and over and over
[1:08:46] but now think about it
[1:08:49] if the holy ghost is the only revealer
[1:08:51] of the word
[1:08:54] and an angel has to come
[1:08:56] each church age got an angel a messenger
[1:09:01] but that messenger had an angel
[1:09:07] he has something to do in his life
[1:09:11] because it's what
[1:09:13] it's to minister to the heirs of
[1:09:15] salvation amen
[1:09:17] well brother dale is just a holy spirit
[1:09:19] that comes to minister to all of us
[1:09:22] now
[1:09:24] your prophet said
[1:09:26] and i can give you a lot of quotes on it
[1:09:29] that people and we have one we'll get
[1:09:30] two or many or a couple of them
[1:09:32] where he said people say well it's just
[1:09:33] the holy ghost
[1:09:36] he said well then didn't peter have the
[1:09:37] holy ghost
[1:09:39] didn't paul have the holy ghost
[1:09:44] people say there's no such thing as
[1:09:46] angels in the new testament it was only
[1:09:48] in the old testament
[1:09:49] now your prophet said that
[1:09:52] but he said who was it that come to
[1:09:53] peter and paul and him
[1:09:57] he said they said an angel come
[1:10:01] now get one point as i said a while ago
[1:10:05] all of those angels that did not fall
[1:10:09] all right
[1:10:11] those angelic beings that did not fall
[1:10:13] for satan's lie they're all under direct
[1:10:17] supervision
[1:10:19] of the holy spirit
[1:10:21] all right now you're with me
[1:10:24] they're under direct supervision
[1:10:27] no
[1:10:28] i don't believe it so in the
[1:10:30] um
[1:10:33] in the good angels it didn't fall
[1:10:37] but
[1:10:37] over in the angels that did fall
[1:10:40] all those angels are fighting for
[1:10:42] positions
[1:10:44] trying to satisfy the big boy and gets
[1:10:46] what they can do because that's why
[1:10:48] brother brother said if god if satan
[1:10:50] can't get you was would drink it
[1:10:53] right
[1:10:53] he said he'll just get you with smoking
[1:10:56] see so one of the demons said okay i
[1:10:59] can't get him take over
[1:11:01] another one takes over
[1:11:04] see we don't think it's angels we think
[1:11:06] it's just good spirits and bad spirits
[1:11:12] well you better remember the first time
[1:11:15] god created
[1:11:18] was what
[1:11:22] angels
[1:11:26] that's the first thing he created
[1:11:28] is what your prophet said i'm sure it's
[1:11:29] on christ's mystery
[1:11:31] first thing he created was angels
[1:11:33] and they worshipped him and that made
[1:11:35] him god
[1:11:37] amen
[1:11:38] so don't think about
[1:11:40] angels as being just oh it's just
[1:11:43] spirits
[1:11:44] just floating around
[1:11:46] remember
[1:11:48] uh when
[1:11:49] uh elijah was in elisha that told you
[1:11:52] know open the eyes of the hazel there
[1:11:55] and said
[1:11:56] when he opened his eyes he said there's
[1:11:57] more for us than our them and he said
[1:12:00] one two one two
[1:12:02] look at all of them
[1:12:04] but when he opened his eyes he said he
[1:12:06] saw what chariots of fire
[1:12:10] and angels
[1:12:12] all around
[1:12:15] see we don't think they're real that's
[1:12:16] the point i want you to see today
[1:12:21] now i'm not
[1:12:22] if brother brown said we're not in the
[1:12:23] worship of angels
[1:12:25] we're not in fanaticisms
[1:12:30] big man that claimed to be
[1:12:32] the next messenger that was to come
[1:12:35] he's trying his best to tell me how his
[1:12:37] angels and
[1:12:38] even his own children they claim to
[1:12:40] recognize that there was something going
[1:12:42] on in the house
[1:12:43] around and it's the angels sometimes
[1:12:46] well
[1:12:49] either one or two things
[1:12:53] one thing for certain he didn't listen
[1:12:54] to the angel
[1:12:56] i'll put it that way because if it was
[1:12:58] an angel from god
[1:13:00] he would have told him the truth
[1:13:02] so we evidently got some other you know
[1:13:03] something else come on
[1:13:06] and the prophet now you say well well
[1:13:08] why is it that
[1:13:09] some people see angels and some don't
[1:13:11] now there's a quote in there i think
[1:13:13] it's the last one
[1:13:15] the bread around explains the reason we
[1:13:17] don't see angels
[1:13:21] he said because we don't dedicate
[1:13:23] ourself
[1:13:26] we don't consecrate ourselves to god
[1:13:29] we've got everything else on our mind
[1:13:30] and that's why we don't have visitation
[1:13:32] of angels
[1:13:33] so now who's to blind
[1:13:38] now brother dale you've told us about
[1:13:39] something you've seen but i just never
[1:13:41] seen nothing well you know whose fault
[1:13:43] it is
[1:13:47] all right that's what your prophet said
[1:13:48] so go ahead and argue on him now
[1:13:51] well it just ain't meant for us
[1:13:55] but when you get up there
[1:13:59] am i going to have to say there's an
[1:14:00] angel standing right there don't walk
[1:14:01] over too far
[1:14:03] and you can't see it now come on folks
[1:14:04] there's something wrong huh
[1:14:06] i shouldn't even be carnal like that but
[1:14:09] i try to make it plain enough to where
[1:14:10] you can understand
[1:14:11] i believe
[1:14:13] and i believed in angels before i ever
[1:14:15] saw anytime
[1:14:18] i believed the bible
[1:14:20] because i could read
[1:14:24] they're
[1:14:25] ministering spirits
[1:14:29] not just spirits see
[1:14:32] you know well it's just a spirit
[1:14:35] and that's what people think about god
[1:14:37] is just a spirit
[1:14:39] god is a spirit that scripture
[1:14:43] they don't think about him being real
[1:14:45] right
[1:14:46] my point is if i can get you convinced
[1:14:48] to see that angels are real real
[1:14:54] then maybe you'll understand god is real
[1:14:56] right
[1:14:58] brother brother said when that angel
[1:14:59] come in the room with him
[1:15:01] he said i've heard his voice
[1:15:04] and everything else i've seen all kinds
[1:15:06] of things happen whirlwinds all kind of
[1:15:08] things and having all kinds of things
[1:15:09] took place but he said when he walked in
[1:15:11] the room
[1:15:14] he said he was a man
[1:15:17] about 200 pounds
[1:15:20] he describes him
[1:15:23] he saw him right
[1:15:25] well
[1:15:26] why can't we well that was just for
[1:15:28] brother brandon
[1:15:29] all right
[1:15:31] that's why you don't see angles
[1:15:34] but now don't get caught up in
[1:15:36] fanaticism
[1:15:38] i remember a church one time this
[1:15:39] brother used to tell them about the
[1:15:40] pillar of fire being around
[1:15:44] they started bringing cameras and every
[1:15:46] time they come alive like
[1:15:52] well don't bring your cameras here
[1:15:59] cause you're gonna mess up my eyesight
[1:16:02] and you're gonna get everybody concerned
[1:16:05] did you feel that
[1:16:07] now do you believe it
[1:16:11] it's not what you feel it's what you
[1:16:12] believe
[1:16:15] you believe god's will you someday
[1:16:17] you'll come close enough
[1:16:19] you'll feel his presence don't worry
[1:16:21] about that
[1:16:24] you see
[1:16:25] only the redeemed have angels
[1:16:28] because they're sent to minister
[1:16:31] to the hours of
[1:16:32] salvation not sent to everybody in the
[1:16:35] world right
[1:16:40] but see we think we've got to be this at
[1:16:42] the other
[1:16:43] do you know that
[1:16:45] that
[1:16:46] geronimo we think he was the heathen
[1:16:51] you know the reason they couldn't
[1:16:52] capture geronimo a lot of times he had
[1:16:55] visions
[1:17:00] somebody with him a christian
[1:17:03] well go talk to him about it
[1:17:06] those guests and colleagues are without
[1:17:07] repentance
[1:17:10] but you see
[1:17:12] we just look at things and you know just
[1:17:18] the brother random uses the scripture on
[1:17:20] that quote 36 a resurrection of lazarus
[1:17:23] they're talking about all have a
[1:17:24] guardian angel and he said their angel
[1:17:26] always behold the father's face which is
[1:17:29] matthew 18 and 10.
[1:17:33] jesus said their angels behold my
[1:17:35] father's face
[1:17:39] kind of like it's real don't you think
[1:17:41] so
[1:17:44] psalms
[1:17:46] i guess it's thirty
[1:17:48] seven
[1:17:50] thirty four and seven
[1:17:52] that's the scripture that brother random
[1:17:54] one most of the time quote it but he
[1:17:56] quotes it a lot of times i've seen it
[1:17:58] he'll say the angel but most of the time
[1:18:00] he says the angels
[1:18:01] of the lord encountered about those who
[1:18:03] fear him
[1:18:05] the psalmist david knew about it
[1:18:07] but now here's what i want you to see
[1:18:11] do you believe that
[1:18:13] the angel that brother branham had
[1:18:16] he said was there from his birth
[1:18:19] to leaving the light was in the room
[1:18:24] get his home
[1:18:25] when his moment
[1:18:27] that's right you believe that he's an
[1:18:29] angel
[1:18:30] a real angel
[1:18:33] not just the holy spirit
[1:18:37] as a quote see
[1:18:40] but a real angel
[1:18:41] that came to it
[1:18:45] but you know what
[1:18:48] i'll show you it's not just the holy
[1:18:49] spirit that we're dealing with
[1:18:52] that angel couldn't save brother bran
[1:19:00] he never said he's saved because he saw
[1:19:02] an angel or heard a bush heard a voice
[1:19:03] up in a bush when he was seven years old
[1:19:06] and think right
[1:19:08] you know people ought to connect with a
[1:19:09] lot of things you know that brother
[1:19:11] branham was in his 20s before he ever
[1:19:13] was born again
[1:19:19] you better go read something
[1:19:26] he run from everything
[1:19:29] yet he knew there were great
[1:19:30] supernatural things taking place first
[1:19:33] thing he said he remembered was a vision
[1:19:34] he's 18 months old
[1:19:36] now i don't think any of you and i'm not
[1:19:39] gonna say i can remember anything i
[1:19:41] can't remember nothing like about four
[1:19:42] so of course i don't have very much
[1:19:43] memory anyway but i probably about four
[1:19:45] years old the best i can remember
[1:19:48] of anything i can remember do you
[1:19:50] remember anything about 18 months old
[1:19:52] no no not quite and i don't think so
[1:19:56] but a 18 month old child has got a lot
[1:19:58] of sins
[1:19:59] but you know just remembering that
[1:20:02] see
[1:20:03] the redeemed have angels
[1:20:06] right
[1:20:09] but that angel can't save you
[1:20:13] but yet the scripture says
[1:20:16] that he what
[1:20:18] he sent forth to minister
[1:20:21] for them
[1:20:24] listen
[1:20:26] who shall be heirs of salvation
[1:20:29] so he's given it to you when you're born
[1:20:35] that proves predestination
[1:20:37] his way he was talking about the other
[1:20:38] wisdom
[1:20:44] predestination what
[1:20:48] oh brother dale it's just seed
[1:20:50] assistance
[1:20:51] we still gonna have a life
[1:20:55] we gotta have a life
[1:20:57] and gotta get to a place
[1:21:00] right
[1:21:02] but it proves predestination if you can
[1:21:05] believe
[1:21:08] that
[1:21:11] you as a redeemed person
[1:21:15] had that angel
[1:21:18] my brother dale it looked like if i had
[1:21:20] an angel i would have done what i'd done
[1:21:25] i told you
[1:21:31] as a sinner i went out and done wrong he
[1:21:33] came home and
[1:21:34] felt dirty
[1:21:41] but you don't want you override that ass
[1:21:42] for a while and you won't feel dirty
[1:21:46] you'll feel happy
[1:21:48] you certainly won't feel dirty
[1:21:51] you remember the first time you've done
[1:21:52] something you felt
[1:21:54] bad what if that was that angel that was
[1:21:57] waiting on you to come to salvation what
[1:22:00] if that angel was protecting you all of
[1:22:01] your life
[1:22:04] brother random when he was a little boy
[1:22:06] wanted
[1:22:06] at one time he took a gun and was going
[1:22:08] to shoot these boys shot 22 times or
[1:22:11] something with a 22 rifle i've got 18
[1:22:13] shots in it with a 22 rifle was gone
[1:22:16] fire gonna kill him and not one of them
[1:22:18] would fire
[1:22:20] and the boys ran away and when he did he
[1:22:22] picked him up put him back in the gun
[1:22:23] and every one of them fired
[1:22:27] who was taking care of him
[1:22:30] who was it that told him don't drink
[1:22:32] chew smoking thing because there's a
[1:22:34] work for you to do
[1:22:36] what if you and i would have listened to
[1:22:38] that
[1:22:41] we wouldn't be in the shape we're in
[1:22:43] today right
[1:22:46] is that blunt enough
[1:22:49] we wouldn't have done the things we've
[1:22:51] done
[1:22:56] he said
[1:22:57] well other people feel guilty i agree
[1:22:59] because being a having a soul being a
[1:23:02] normal being that's a moral obligation
[1:23:04] to do good right
[1:23:06] adolf hitler probably felt that too when
[1:23:08] he was a little kid
[1:23:13] but you see you claim to be redeemed
[1:23:15] today don't you
[1:23:16] you claim to have a new birth
[1:23:18] well you know what there was an angel
[1:23:20] with you the whole time
[1:23:23] driving you to it now did brother brown
[1:23:25] make this statement he said at one time
[1:23:28] the angels was placed at the garden of
[1:23:31] eden
[1:23:32] to keep away from them getting to the
[1:23:35] tree of life of that scripture right he
[1:23:38] said but
[1:23:39] now those angels are driving you to the
[1:23:43] tree of life
[1:23:45] amen
[1:23:47] using ministers using people to help you
[1:23:51] using natural angels right
[1:23:54] but using spiritual angels beings
[1:23:58] supernatural beings
[1:24:00] right
[1:24:02] that
[1:24:04] god had to open his eyes
[1:24:10] did
[1:24:11] elijah necessarily see him
[1:24:14] or he did he just know that there
[1:24:19] how many you are getting the points well
[1:24:21] that don't make no difference
[1:24:23] i'm just trying to make a point
[1:24:25] but he had to open hazel's eyes
[1:24:28] and let him see
[1:24:33] do you know what that never did convert
[1:24:34] to hazel
[1:24:37] i'm not knowing exactly where it's at it
[1:24:39] was but i believe it was after then when
[1:24:41] hazel sold out and tried to do all these
[1:24:43] things and wound up with leprosy
[1:24:50] but you see
[1:24:52] it's because we don't believe it
[1:24:56] those who he for knew
[1:24:58] the scripture said he did predestinate
[1:25:03] so if he predestinated you
[1:25:06] by his foreknowledge knowing you would
[1:25:08] come to it then when he was born an
[1:25:10] angel was assigned to him
[1:25:14] and it definitely was not the holy
[1:25:15] spirit
[1:25:17] to just say the holy spirit come to me
[1:25:19] when i was a baby
[1:25:21] and been with me ever since no no no
[1:25:24] an angel
[1:25:29] an angel
[1:25:33] see
[1:25:35] you think of all the things in your life
[1:25:36] that you could have been killed
[1:25:42] who took care of you
[1:25:45] god allows some things to happen
[1:25:48] to where that it
[1:25:49] takes place what about josh with the
[1:25:53] the wreck he was in and
[1:25:55] he was in the car by itself
[1:25:57] and three people
[1:25:59] testified that there was a man got out
[1:26:01] of the car and walked off
[1:26:03] and went down through the woods
[1:26:12] he said well josh is not necessarily
[1:26:14] claiming to say he born again well
[1:26:15] that's up to him between him and god
[1:26:18] because that doesn't have anything to do
[1:26:19] with it
[1:26:20] i took care of you
[1:26:22] well why didn't you keep me from doing
[1:26:24] wrong get tried
[1:26:32] well i told my brother when he told me
[1:26:34] one day he said god made me this way he
[1:26:36] can't condemn me for being like i am he
[1:26:38] made not to know he didn't make you that
[1:26:40] way
[1:26:41] and i was not on i don't even know then
[1:26:42] where i was in this message or not i
[1:26:44] said he didn't make you that way right
[1:26:48] so you made yourself
[1:26:51] i preach to you what i believe you put
[1:26:53] yourself in the pawn shop
[1:26:58] well the devil made me do it
[1:27:01] i don't blame him for everything
[1:27:04] right
[1:27:06] i volunteered for most of it what about
[1:27:08] you
[1:27:10] it was me that done it
[1:27:15] we don't believe they're really
[1:27:19] see then we don't believe god is able of
[1:27:21] doing anything what would be wrong with
[1:27:23] your thoughts and mentality of a human
[1:27:25] being to be able to comprehend if there
[1:27:28] is a living god
[1:27:32] a great eternal supreme being
[1:27:35] what would be the trouble of himself an
[1:27:37] angel to eat
[1:27:42] but just remember
[1:27:44] there's things that goes along with that
[1:27:51] because he also has to record what we do
[1:27:54] and has to report to the father our
[1:27:56] actions
[1:27:58] and our reactions
[1:28:00] in life
[1:28:03] so we need to be careful don't we
[1:28:07] if you're predestinated under salvation
[1:28:13] and if you're born again today you have
[1:28:14] to believe he was
[1:28:19] then why not believe that god sent an
[1:28:21] angel down
[1:28:23] good just the holy spirit brother dale
[1:28:28] well let's see what brother brown had to
[1:28:30] say
[1:28:33] we're about number six on your notes
[1:28:34] let's start reading
[1:28:36] see what he had to say about it
[1:28:38] we claim we believe him
[1:28:42] number six on your notes covers three
[1:28:44] paragraphs
[1:28:46] it's also obeying the voice of the angel
[1:28:49] priest in 1957-18
[1:28:54] you coming down go to what's underlined
[1:28:56] it's basically you read the rest of it
[1:28:58] see what it says
[1:29:03] someone said not long ago to me brother
[1:29:05] brown angels were ministering spirits in
[1:29:07] the old testament
[1:29:09] but since the holy spirit has come
[1:29:12] we don't have ministering angels anymore
[1:29:17] now dear friends
[1:29:20] this is not a worship of angels
[1:29:22] understand
[1:29:23] we do not believe in worship and angels
[1:29:25] there's only one to be worshipped that's
[1:29:26] god and his son and our holy spirit no
[1:29:28] angel no no man or no angel to be
[1:29:31] worshipped
[1:29:32] now the angel of god a true angel of god
[1:29:34] would not
[1:29:35] not stand still to be worshiped
[1:29:39] but that you might know that
[1:29:41] angels still minister to the church
[1:29:43] after the holy ghost has come
[1:29:46] how about
[1:29:47] well think of mary
[1:29:50] no
[1:29:50] this one doesn't have it in it
[1:29:52] but there's one if it's not in the next
[1:29:54] one i got plenty of blade at the house
[1:29:55] on this part right here
[1:29:57] but
[1:29:58] in other words around brought up married
[1:30:00] to one person he said huh she wasn't in
[1:30:03] the new
[1:30:05] you testament he had him
[1:30:08] well sure compared to mary because new
[1:30:10] testament had come
[1:30:14] he said okay
[1:30:17] what about peter
[1:30:19] see
[1:30:20] they really thought they're smart
[1:30:22] at least what about peter what about
[1:30:23] paul what
[1:30:24] because now there's one exactly wording
[1:30:26] like that listen well think of mary when
[1:30:28] the gabriel came down and spoke to her
[1:30:30] about the virgin birth of the savior or
[1:30:32] like around the temple
[1:30:34] or well after the holy ghost come
[1:30:37] so he's after the holy ghost come
[1:30:39] how many believes that philip had the
[1:30:40] holy ghost
[1:30:43] we all believe that don't we well and
[1:30:46] when he was down at samaria preaching
[1:30:47] having a revival was it the holy ghost
[1:30:50] that came to him or did the angel of the
[1:30:52] lord touch him and say
[1:30:54] go to the desert vision
[1:30:58] the angel of the lord came to him is
[1:31:00] that true he was the angel of the lord
[1:31:01] that came to him well anyone would
[1:31:04] believe that the great saint peter
[1:31:06] the apostle had the holy ghost
[1:31:08] he had the keys to the kingdom
[1:31:10] and he had the holy ghost didn't he
[1:31:13] but when he was in jail one night and in
[1:31:15] prison and down at john mark's house
[1:31:18] they were having a prayer meeting
[1:31:20] it was the angel of the lord who came in
[1:31:22] and touched him and led
[1:31:23] not the holy spirit the angels of the
[1:31:25] lord came in
[1:31:28] we know that paul had the holy ghost do
[1:31:30] you believe that well he was 14 days and
[1:31:33] nights upon the sea without any moon
[1:31:34] stars and it was all dark he went down
[1:31:36] in the gallery to pray
[1:31:39] he came back and told a man be of good
[1:31:41] courage for the angel of god whose
[1:31:43] servant i am came to me last night and
[1:31:45] said fear not paul is that right
[1:31:48] not the holy spirit the angel of god see
[1:31:51] an angel of god sent from god
[1:31:56] listen and then john the revelator the
[1:31:59] whole book of revelations
[1:32:01] when it was wrote he said i have sent my
[1:32:04] angel
[1:32:05] john said i jesus said
[1:32:08] excuse me jesus did
[1:32:10] and john fell down to worship the angel
[1:32:12] but the angel said stand up worship god
[1:32:14] see a true angel of god didn't stand to
[1:32:16] be worshipped
[1:32:17] he said that he was of the prophets
[1:32:20] and he was his fellow men that had
[1:32:24] been sent to signify these things
[1:32:26] therefore angelic beings is ordained
[1:32:28] ministers of god to come to the earth to
[1:32:31] by record of god and they work through
[1:32:34] mortal beings just as they did through
[1:32:36] daniel and back through the ages
[1:32:38] and i believe it with all of my heart
[1:32:42] number seven
[1:32:45] angels of the lord matthew 51
[1:32:48] 502.
[1:32:50] i want you to know that that angel of
[1:32:52] god is no more to do with me
[1:32:55] listen
[1:32:59] that it is to do with you
[1:33:04] oh
[1:33:09] come on
[1:33:11] that is an angel sent down from heaven
[1:33:14] and if you don't believe
[1:33:15] angels are ministering spirits sent from
[1:33:17] the presence of god
[1:33:19] then you don't know the bible yes sir
[1:33:22] someone said brother branham angels is
[1:33:23] only for the old testament why that's an
[1:33:26] era
[1:33:27] the church had many angels ministering
[1:33:30] excuse me the church had more angels
[1:33:32] ministering
[1:33:33] than what the old testament did yes sir
[1:33:36] well they said the holy ghost leaves the
[1:33:38] church
[1:33:39] that's correct
[1:33:40] the holy ghost is over all
[1:33:43] come on stephen you see what i said
[1:33:44] while ago he's over everything
[1:33:47] this is the body and it's true but
[1:33:49] there's also ministry and spirit sent
[1:33:51] from the presence of god
[1:33:53] we know that mary and all of those were
[1:33:56] they all of those they seen angels and
[1:33:58] we know the new church seen angel
[1:34:01] how about you said do you believe philip
[1:34:03] had the holy ghost philip the evangelist
[1:34:05] after pentecost and he had the holy
[1:34:07] ghost didn't he
[1:34:08] who would have told him to go to the
[1:34:10] desert johnson and the angel of the lord
[1:34:12] came down is that right when he was
[1:34:14] having that revival at samaria
[1:34:17] peter had the holy ghost do you believe
[1:34:18] that and while they were having a prayer
[1:34:20] meeting from him at john mark's house
[1:34:22] the angel of the lord what was it a
[1:34:25] light shined in the window and the angel
[1:34:27] of the lord touched him and dropped the
[1:34:29] shackles off of him and put him outside
[1:34:31] of the building is that right and peter
[1:34:34] had the holy ghost to that right
[1:34:36] paul the apostle had the holy ghost do
[1:34:37] you believe it but after 14 days now the
[1:34:40] same quote
[1:34:41] for the angel of the lord whose servant
[1:34:43] i am
[1:34:45] and what and the whole book of
[1:34:46] revelation was showed john by an angel
[1:34:50] i jesus has sent my angel to testify
[1:34:54] is that right
[1:34:55] so angels are ministering spirits
[1:34:58] usually come in the form of lights
[1:35:02] and i through personally
[1:35:04] as i started to say a while ago with my
[1:35:06] bible over my heart i believe that the
[1:35:09] angel of god i've seen it since i was a
[1:35:11] little boy
[1:35:13] in that cabin
[1:35:15] they told me he'd come in
[1:35:17] that you seen the picture that the lady
[1:35:19] dropped last night on the little cabin
[1:35:21] where i was born
[1:35:23] i see people saying the holy spirit now
[1:35:25] you know you'll run around and say the
[1:35:26] holy spirit come in
[1:35:31] it's like brother joe was talking last
[1:35:33] night about
[1:35:34] you get to reading about something
[1:35:37] and then you get scriptures it don't
[1:35:38] sound
[1:35:39] something sounds like it's contrary but
[1:35:42] around them will say maybe the holy
[1:35:43] spirit come in the little captain
[1:35:45] here he says the knights will come in
[1:35:46] the cave
[1:35:48] oh that's just the holy spirit see
[1:35:50] you're not getting it
[1:35:52] the holy spirit can use an angel to make
[1:35:54] something personal
[1:35:58] because it's not jesus coming down to
[1:36:00] personally walk up to you hey now wait
[1:36:06] no
[1:36:07] but an angel can do that
[1:36:11] you can take on a form and come down
[1:36:16] expectation 1958 10.
[1:36:19] someone told me here not long ago said
[1:36:20] brother brown sitting there why don't
[1:36:22] you give all the praise to the holy
[1:36:24] ghost
[1:36:25] and say that's the holy spirit excuse me
[1:36:27] praise to the holy spirit and say that's
[1:36:28] the holy spirit
[1:36:30] i said my brother i must be truthful
[1:36:33] and there's a blank spot on the table
[1:36:35] whether it's the holy spirit
[1:36:37] i said
[1:36:38] it it's
[1:36:40] it it's a gift sent from god
[1:36:44] he never said he was the holy spirit
[1:36:46] never told me who he was
[1:36:48] he said i'm sent from the presence of
[1:36:50] god
[1:36:51] and you know what people know you know
[1:36:52] people also why are you asking his name
[1:36:55] he says you don't talk on one quote when
[1:36:57] he's died
[1:37:01] i didn't know who it was
[1:37:05] never said anything to john will palace
[1:37:07] about who it was
[1:37:11] i don't know who it was
[1:37:13] i mean you're just a busy one
[1:37:15] get born again get out of that garbage
[1:37:17] can
[1:37:19] he said i'm sent from the presence of
[1:37:20] god and it does not feel like the holy
[1:37:22] spirit
[1:37:24] when it comes
[1:37:25] listen to it
[1:37:27] the holy spirit makes me feel happy
[1:37:30] but when that comes around
[1:37:33] it isn't that feeling
[1:37:36] it's a very sacred
[1:37:38] august feeling like
[1:37:40] and it's different but it's sent from
[1:37:42] god
[1:37:45] he said run around
[1:37:47] the ministers angels that was back in
[1:37:49] the old testament with daniel and so
[1:37:51] forth but that's some hero friends
[1:37:54] that that that that is wrong he said
[1:37:57] since the holy ghost come the holy ghost
[1:38:00] leads the church
[1:38:01] that's the truth
[1:38:03] the holy ghost leaves the church that is
[1:38:04] true but there's ministry and spirit
[1:38:06] sent from god
[1:38:08] special gifts
[1:38:10] friends
[1:38:12] sent from god
[1:38:19] on the message i am the resurrection
[1:38:21] 1952-18
[1:38:25] and i'll read it and make a gaps or
[1:38:27] anybody on tape you just read it all
[1:38:30] god still has angels programming every
[1:38:32] 17
[1:38:34] and they visit the people
[1:38:36] not a worship of angels but angelic
[1:38:39] beings
[1:38:40] who are attributes
[1:38:43] of god
[1:38:49] another thing as i said
[1:38:51] there's going to be a lot of attributes
[1:38:53] when we get over on that other side that
[1:38:54] i don't think we're going to know about
[1:38:55] here
[1:38:59] my brother i found the quote around in
[1:39:01] jesus all attributes hey man i believe
[1:39:04] in it
[1:39:06] well there's a lot about jesus we don't
[1:39:07] know
[1:39:08] we're going to have an eternity of
[1:39:10] knowing about what took place on this
[1:39:12] earth we're just going to get enough
[1:39:13] here that's what i want you to see and
[1:39:15] what's not sure we're just going to get
[1:39:16] enough here to be able to go there amen
[1:39:20] then god will take care of it but that's
[1:39:22] what he said
[1:39:24] drop down on just a little bit where the
[1:39:26] line is
[1:39:27] now this angel came he was gabriel now
[1:39:29] god sends minor angels that's right
[1:39:32] perhaps the ones that come the one comes
[1:39:34] here
[1:39:35] now you know where i gave you the quotes
[1:39:37] for a brother brother said that his was
[1:39:39] maybe a minor angel
[1:39:43] i speculated quite a while ago i'll find
[1:39:44] him for you
[1:39:46] he said maybe a minor angel
[1:39:50] i'd like for you to find extra 63 that
[1:39:52] he said he was minor
[1:40:02] perhaps the one to come here
[1:40:04] some people will actually puff their
[1:40:06] minds up with angels now listen to it
[1:40:08] and things
[1:40:10] who they think they have seen
[1:40:12] and things like that
[1:40:14] that's just the counterfeit right
[1:40:16] because listen
[1:40:18] this is right on e18
[1:40:22] if a man has seen an angel of god
[1:40:25] and met his commission
[1:40:27] student met god he is commissioned
[1:40:30] or that angel commissioned him from god
[1:40:34] and it was sent from god
[1:40:36] it'll be a record right down the line
[1:40:40] that's the truth
[1:40:42] you believe that if it doesn't
[1:40:44] it isn't the truth
[1:40:46] that's one thing you can depend on by
[1:40:48] their fruits you shall know them that's
[1:40:51] truth
[1:40:52] greatest battle ever fought 1963-311
[1:40:55] and here the bible comes right back and
[1:40:57] tells
[1:40:58] us here that god sends forth angels
[1:41:01] glory what are they ministering spirit
[1:41:03] glory ministering spirit simply
[1:41:06] sent word
[1:41:07] from the presence of god what to do
[1:41:09] ministries word
[1:41:11] see now you're getting down to
[1:41:14] people on earth preachers
[1:41:17] that claim to be preachers
[1:41:19] are supposed to be angels
[1:41:22] well i must worry about what brother
[1:41:23] brown was right or not right
[1:41:27] we shouldn't by now
[1:41:31] but what about
[1:41:32] earthly messengers preacher
[1:41:38] now not if i say
[1:41:41] white instead of blue
[1:41:46] and people was arguing one time whether
[1:41:47] or not i was called of god and they said
[1:41:49] look at that he made a mistake he's 80
[1:41:51] miles apart he said he's 60.
[1:42:01] now here the bible comes right back and
[1:42:03] tells us here that god sends forth
[1:42:05] angels glory what are they ministering
[1:42:07] spirits glory ministering spirit sent
[1:42:09] word
[1:42:10] from the presence of god to do what
[1:42:13] now remember what we read up here at the
[1:42:14] top of it that they were angelic beings
[1:42:20] were attributes of god
[1:42:22] now preacher
[1:42:26] not mama called daddy sent
[1:42:30] a preacher
[1:42:32] what makes me any different than you
[1:42:36] a call
[1:42:38] a commission
[1:42:42] would not that angel in your life have
[1:42:44] something to do with your commission
[1:42:49] i'm talking about your angel it's a sign
[1:42:51] of your birth i'm talking about your
[1:42:53] only redeemed i'm an angel that's what
[1:42:55] i'm talking about wouldn't that be
[1:42:56] something
[1:42:58] so when god assigned me one he knew i
[1:43:00] was going to be a preacher
[1:43:02] i said last night to the people then he
[1:43:04] prepared m uh joshua
[1:43:07] moses was in there you know but joshua
[1:43:10] was right there beside moses all the
[1:43:12] time getting ready to take over when
[1:43:14] moses stepped out of the way
[1:43:16] right
[1:43:21] he's training some of you to step over i
[1:43:23] may step out of the way
[1:43:25] i may be taken out of the way that's up
[1:43:27] to god i don't know my business don't
[1:43:28] worry about
[1:43:31] who's going to step up and take over
[1:43:33] if they come in here put a gun to my
[1:43:35] head and shoot who's going to take over
[1:43:36] and say give me next
[1:43:38] amen
[1:43:44] ministry of spirit sent
[1:43:46] from the present word from the presence
[1:43:47] of god to what minister the word
[1:43:49] amen you're not to minister some
[1:43:50] theology or some denominational group
[1:43:52] diminished but to minister his word
[1:43:54] that's it ministering spirit sent forth
[1:43:57] oh that's only for brother branham
[1:44:00] well
[1:44:02] i thought the fightful ministry was for
[1:44:03] perfecting the science
[1:44:05] i just believe the scripture what the
[1:44:06] prophet said
[1:44:09] how do they know
[1:44:11] how do we know they are
[1:44:13] now how do you know whether dale is
[1:44:14] called a preacher not
[1:44:18] i don't know i wouldn't know
[1:44:25] if he preaches his own
[1:44:27] theology his own denominational ideas
[1:44:30] you know real quick he's not called a
[1:44:32] god
[1:44:34] come on
[1:44:35] how do we know they are the bible said
[1:44:37] that the word of the lord came to the
[1:44:38] prophets
[1:44:39] oh
[1:44:40] you think you're prophet
[1:44:43] well i thought brother branham said this
[1:44:45] was a prophetic age
[1:44:47] i thought this was the age of the eagle
[1:44:51] i thought the bride i'm quoting brother
[1:44:53] branhamwood to be prophetic
[1:44:57] right but you see we read prophets
[1:45:01] who do you think you are you think you
[1:45:02] won the prophets
[1:45:04] no i'm just one of the more believers in
[1:45:06] the body of christ
[1:45:08] amen but i'm a minister called to preach
[1:45:14] is that right these angels minister his
[1:45:16] word through his spirit minister the
[1:45:18] word through the holy spirit and the
[1:45:20] spirit and the word comes to the
[1:45:21] prophets and the prophet said the word
[1:45:23] of god that's the reason they do the
[1:45:26] miracles that they did it wasn't the man
[1:45:28] it was the spirit of god in the man the
[1:45:30] spirit of christ and the man for the
[1:45:32] word of god goes on down right
[1:45:36] that's paragraph just come on down the
[1:45:37] same message page that was page 27
[1:45:40] greatest battle this is page 30 greatest
[1:45:42] better yes sir these are ministering
[1:45:44] spirits sent from the presence of god to
[1:45:46] ministry to minister what
[1:45:48] his word not some theology but god's
[1:45:51] word their ministering spirit sent from
[1:45:53] god to minister ministering spirits lord
[1:45:56] i remember if
[1:45:57] if it's ministering
[1:45:59] something besides a word it don't come
[1:46:01] from god because the word the word thy
[1:46:03] word is always confirmed in heaven
[1:46:07] trying to hurry up just a few minutes
[1:46:11] in the message resurrection of lazarus
[1:46:13] 53 11 22 he said but an angel a true
[1:46:16] angel of god will always point you to
[1:46:18] jesus christ paul said if an angel from
[1:46:20] heaven come and preach any other gospel
[1:46:22] than which you have
[1:46:23] already heard let him be a curse is that
[1:46:25] right see watch what the angel teaches
[1:46:27] if it's bringing
[1:46:29] if it's bringing along in the gospel and
[1:46:32] sound and doctrine and everything
[1:46:33] according to the bible then believe it
[1:46:36] so god always send angelic beings to
[1:46:39] warn the world
[1:46:41] now
[1:46:43] now we're just going to read just a few
[1:46:45] times
[1:46:47] but he sends angelic beings to warn the
[1:46:49] world
[1:46:53] did not
[1:46:55] three angels go down to sodom
[1:47:00] was that not god and two angels yes
[1:47:04] was that not god that just spoke a body
[1:47:07] and spoke a body for them and they
[1:47:08] walked down
[1:47:11] was that not who it was
[1:47:14] angels listen to what he said
[1:47:17] i believe that those angelic beings in
[1:47:19] the earth today are warning the world of
[1:47:21] judgment to come
[1:47:23] i could go a little bit on your flying
[1:47:25] saucer here for just a few minutes
[1:47:28] he said don't take that much time
[1:47:31] god sat down i ain't
[1:47:33] angel's down there to call a lot out
[1:47:36] that's the quote right in front of you
[1:47:37] five junctions of time 56 122. the
[1:47:41] united states is shaking the great
[1:47:42] bureaus and so forth in the great
[1:47:45] pentagon
[1:47:46] and all of that investigating
[1:47:48] supernatural things flying saucers
[1:47:51] what are they oh they say we see little
[1:47:54] men in them all kind of stories
[1:47:57] they try to deny
[1:47:59] but they're there why god said there
[1:48:01] would be signs in the heavens above in
[1:48:03] the earth we got it
[1:48:05] afraid
[1:48:07] christmas mystery god revealed 63 728
[1:48:10] did you notice the angels that come down
[1:48:12] investigated sodom before sodom was
[1:48:14] destroyed you remember that there was a
[1:48:16] bunch of them come down three of them
[1:48:19] one of them stayed with abraham you
[1:48:21] remember that they were lights from
[1:48:22] heaven that came down in the
[1:48:24] investigating judgment one look where
[1:48:27] they're all found around the pentagon
[1:48:30] and things they find them that's the
[1:48:32] world judgment sodom
[1:48:34] north at night 65 68 15
[1:48:38] see the world don't know what that is
[1:48:41] you know you know it's all in
[1:48:43] we know what it is
[1:48:45] see we know it's investigating judgment
[1:48:47] angels you see
[1:48:49] and they
[1:48:50] howl at the pentagon all about how it
[1:48:52] comes right down to the intelligence
[1:48:55] listen
[1:48:58] how they go like a flash
[1:49:00] and be gone
[1:49:02] pull away from anything they got
[1:49:05] see and they don't realize what it is
[1:49:07] see let them think whatever they want to
[1:49:09] they call them flying saucers or
[1:49:11] whatever
[1:49:12] they don't know
[1:49:18] just one second
[1:49:20] brother branham says and i'll give you
[1:49:22] the quote it's in the 50s
[1:49:24] 56 i think he said russia
[1:49:27] has she had airplanes
[1:49:29] all right we knew that at the end of the
[1:49:30] war because the germans had jet airplane
[1:49:32] didn't know how to control them so then
[1:49:34] when they divided the berlin wall we got
[1:49:36] half the scientists and they got half
[1:49:38] the scientists
[1:49:41] and they had
[1:49:43] jet airplanes
[1:49:45] russia
[1:49:46] probably prior to us
[1:49:48] we also said they had flying saucers
[1:49:54] russia yes
[1:49:58] they spy on us all they want to because
[1:50:00] see
[1:50:01] they're super intelligence
[1:50:05] and see then they don't know what to do
[1:50:08] and they can just fly among us and leave
[1:50:11] and do well if we got stokes bombers we
[1:50:12] got those things
[1:50:14] 1962 francis powers was shot down in the
[1:50:17] youtube pilot of a plane that is more
[1:50:20] sophisticated than the steps bombers are
[1:50:22] today that was 1962.
[1:50:25] i happened to read
[1:50:28] these steps bombers they said they was
[1:50:30] gonna get floated money you know to try
[1:50:33] to get the government okay to build them
[1:50:34] they had two photo tops made you know
[1:50:37] and they wanted them in less than 30 to
[1:50:39] 60 days later they had 15 the first
[1:50:42] flight that went into kuwait
[1:50:45] so where'd it come from
[1:50:47] so we've got investigating angels also
[1:50:50] people
[1:50:51] we've got fine saucers take a man pull
[1:50:53] his ears up twist him up a little bit
[1:50:54] make him look like a monkey let him fly
[1:50:56] around just in case he falls
[1:51:01] and russia's got him
[1:51:03] but god's got amen and see that's the
[1:51:06] reason they can't figure out what's
[1:51:07] going on see because they try to track
[1:51:09] certain ones of them and when they try
[1:51:11] to track them
[1:51:12] they can't find them
[1:51:14] well because they're from god
[1:51:17] and they just went off believe
[1:51:18] everything
[1:51:21] you never heard the story how that
[1:51:23] hitler came up with a blimp
[1:51:26] and you had a man suspended hundreds or
[1:51:28] hundreds of feet below that blimp
[1:51:30] in a little room with i mean little
[1:51:32] platform with a
[1:51:35] phone to call up and tell them and they
[1:51:37] couldn't figure out how come that the
[1:51:39] germans would come in and was so
[1:51:41] accurate with their bombing and it
[1:51:43] seemed like that even if they flew over
[1:51:44] and bombed and they missed a place they
[1:51:46] would just back up and bomb again
[1:51:49] the guy was sitting there telling them
[1:51:52] you missed it so many hundred feet back
[1:51:54] up so they got so excited about it they
[1:51:57] finally figured out what was taking
[1:51:58] place
[1:52:01] you know what they've done they started
[1:52:02] shooting in the clouds and the planes
[1:52:04] just flew over and bombed them just
[1:52:05] towel them up
[1:52:07] because they're shooting into the clouds
[1:52:08] thinking they haven't you understand
[1:52:10] what i'm saying
[1:52:12] the russians are flying around we're
[1:52:13] flying around everybody's fighting on
[1:52:15] each other
[1:52:16] and all of that though god has his
[1:52:18] angels that are flying around
[1:52:21] he's getting so confused they don't know
[1:52:23] what's going on
[1:52:24] they don't know whose plane is who
[1:52:28] because there are angels to come down to
[1:52:31] check on us
[1:52:34] now don't ask me how come god does it
[1:52:36] maybe he limits himself as i tried to
[1:52:37] preach but in sodom remember what the
[1:52:39] story was come on brother boyd
[1:52:41] you remember what the story was in sorry
[1:52:45] when it come down to abraham the man
[1:52:47] that came to abraham
[1:52:49] said i've wondered of what the things
[1:52:51] that have said about what's taking place
[1:52:54] is true or not so i came down
[1:52:57] i can't
[1:52:58] let me read this while they're getting
[1:53:00] ready then we'll just play and just sing
[1:53:02] a verse or something and then we'll be
[1:53:04] through
[1:53:05] message the resurrection preach 53 1205.
[1:53:10] you know what i think today the reason
[1:53:12] that we don't have no angelic visit
[1:53:15] don't have more angelic visitations than
[1:53:18] we do
[1:53:19] now listen
[1:53:21] we who call ourselves christians
[1:53:24] play cards half the night read old crew
[1:53:27] story magazines
[1:53:28] have beer and ice box
[1:53:31] and that's the reason
[1:53:32] angels don't visit us
[1:53:35] you can't mix oil
[1:53:37] and water
[1:53:41] you can't mix only
[1:53:45] the reason we don't have the visitation
[1:53:47] of angels
[1:53:50] we don't
[1:53:52] stay sincere
[1:53:54] listen to what he says here one
[1:53:57] revelations book of symbols 1956
[1:54:00] angelic beings associate together
[1:54:03] i hope you get that that just dropped
[1:54:05] right down
[1:54:07] free look
[1:54:08] and if you've got the holy spirit in you
[1:54:11] then you're a candidate for association
[1:54:14] with the unseen world
[1:54:16] and the supernatural
[1:54:20] no wonder people don't believe in those
[1:54:22] things
[1:54:23] they never come in contact
[1:54:26] they've got
[1:54:27] nothing in here to believe with
[1:54:31] listen
[1:54:32] but when the holy spirit comes into the
[1:54:34] heart quickly he becomes then a twofold
[1:54:37] being
[1:54:39] one of the earth to die the other and of
[1:54:42] heaven to live
[1:54:43] in his body he still subject to death
[1:54:45] but his soul has passed some depth into
[1:54:47] life in his body he has earthly contact
[1:54:49] with his sins five senses
[1:54:52] in his spirit he has a contact with god
[1:54:54] through the holy ghost and the angels of
[1:54:56] god visits them and speaks with them and
[1:55:00] they are messengers sent from god to
[1:55:01] reveal and to bring messages from god to
[1:55:04] the individual
[1:55:06] he's out to get the first thing first
[1:55:08] right
[1:55:11] obeying his voice 1957-13
[1:55:14] but god's gift is the spirit of god that
[1:55:17] came down in the form of an angel
[1:55:22] in the form of an angel
[1:55:25] now listen what he says
[1:55:28] you talk about when it come to him
[1:55:33] come on read it
[1:55:35] now he didn't have wings
[1:55:38] he looked like a man
[1:55:40] i heard him when he walked
[1:55:42] right around millstreet
[1:55:44] just as that and walked on the floor
[1:55:46] walked right over just as normal as any
[1:55:48] man
[1:55:49] talks just like any man he comes time
[1:55:52] after time through the room in different
[1:55:53] places
[1:55:55] when i'm fasting and praying
[1:55:58] so when he was getting himself out of
[1:55:59] the way
[1:56:00] is when the angel came maybe that's our
[1:56:02] trouble
[1:56:03] you remember one time
[1:56:04] billy paul had always asked to see the
[1:56:06] angel
[1:56:07] the brother and spoke up
[1:56:09] but around him asked the angel one day
[1:56:12] could he could build a call see
[1:56:15] he said bill paul on me
[1:56:18] he said i'll stand right over here
[1:56:21] he said you turn him and tell him
[1:56:23] and paul said i'm look
[1:56:26] and there stood a man
[1:56:28] but then he was gone
[1:56:31] he let him see
[1:56:33] angels are real folks
[1:56:36] it's not just i feel a spirit
[1:56:39] understand

[1:56:42] something everybody has a need because
