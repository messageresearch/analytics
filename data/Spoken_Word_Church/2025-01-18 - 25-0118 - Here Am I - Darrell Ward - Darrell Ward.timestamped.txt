[36:53] darkest of all ages amen we're living in
[36:56] the age that is a consummation of all of
[36:59] the evil of the six previous ages all
[37:02] the evil that was in Luther's day and
[37:04] Wesley's day has all come up to a head
[37:06] in this day that we are now living in
[37:10] and the Bible said as it was in the days
[37:12] of Noah when men's Hearts were
[37:14] continually evil so shall it be in that
[37:17] day when the son of man shall be
[37:19] revealed amen and I was talking to my
[37:21] wife the other day and I was telling her
[37:23] you know I said by God's grace he he has
[37:26] allowed us to see
[37:28] yeah and because we see light sometimes
[37:31] I think we fail to realize just how
[37:34] blinded this generation has become you
[37:38] know you cannot really appreciate
[37:39] Darkness if you can still see light and
[37:42] even if you Su your eyelids you know you
[37:44] can still see light through the eyelids
[37:47] but we're living in a time when there's
[37:48] gross Darkness upon the Earth and gross
[37:51] Darkness upon the people and I think
[37:53] because that we can see light that
[37:55] sometimes we fail to realize just how
[37:58] dark it is it's really hard to
[38:01] comprehend blindness if you can see
[38:03] right come on brother is that all right
[38:06] the world we're living in today is now
[38:08] moving in almost Total
[38:10] Insanity it's the darkest and the gross
[38:13] darkness that has B this age that has
[38:15] drawn the people into Insanity yeah it
[38:18] is an age of me yep and not of us right
[38:22] amen it is an age of isolation it is a
[38:25] day of selflove when people love their s
[38:28] more than they love their brother right
[38:31] amen it's an isolation and in darkness
[38:34] drives humans to the brink of insanity
[38:37] and we can understand that from the
[38:39] isolation of the covid that we have just
[38:41] come through and how it isolated the
[38:43] people and the Darkness of the age you
[38:45] can see the insanity that has manifested
[38:48] among the people and science actually
[38:50] did in experiments and they found out
[38:52] that isolation total isolation and
[38:55] darkness drives humans to the brid
[38:57] of
[38:58] insanity this Leia age is the age of
[39:01] blindness it is the age of Darkness that
[39:04] darkness that it's in our College it's
[39:06] in our schools it's it's in our
[39:08] neighborhoods it's in our governments
[39:10] and you might as well say Amen it's the
[39:12] truth it's an age of Deceit it's an age
[39:15] of falsehood it's an age of fake news
[39:18] right amen amen the prophet of God said
[39:21] it this way he said blind Lea how blind
[39:24] can we get blind Lea the leading of the
[39:27] blind to this age under false pretense
[39:29] under false Creeds under dogmas that's
[39:32] false under denominations that's false
[39:34] under Creeds and books that's false oh
[39:36] blind layout seea leading the blind
[39:39] you're all headed for the ditch blind
[39:42] leaders of the blind will they not all
[39:44] fall into the ditch truly a blind leay
[39:47] on I see a church age just exactly what
[39:50] the Bible said would be amen right so
[39:53] blinded the prophet said that they
[39:55] cannot see how miserable how deceived
[39:59] that they really are for they say I am
[40:02] in cre I am rich I set as a queen I have
[40:05] need of nothing and the Bible said
[40:07] knowest thou not that you're poor
[40:10] miserable blinded wretched naked and
[40:13] don't even know it right it's the thus
[40:17] sayith the Lord of Revelations 3 amen
[40:21] the prophet said if you've never read it
[40:22] you need to read it that's what she is
[40:24] and she don't even realize it that's
[40:27] right no wonder the Bible said in the
[40:30] last days it shall come to pass what is
[40:32] it there'll be signs in the heavens
[40:34] flying saucers where even the Pentagon
[40:36] don't even know what to think about it
[40:38] and if you follow the news you found out
[40:40] that for once here in just the last few
[40:42] years that our government has actually
[40:44] acknowledged that they've been
[40:46] investigating UFOs right unidentified
[40:50] flying objects to pagon finally admits
[40:52] it investigating UFOs fearful sights of
[40:56] the sky mid Hearts failing for fear
[40:58] perlex of time distress between nations
[41:01] as our brother sang about all seing
[41:04] Sands of
[41:06] Time the sea Roar and tidle waves
[41:09] earthquakes the prophet said but you
[41:11] know what I'm thinking said Jesus said
[41:12] before he comes there'll be signs in the
[41:15] heaven above did you notice before he
[41:17] destroys Sodom and gomorra because of
[41:19] their sex Affairs he sent Angels down to
[41:22] investigate it and angels has come to
[41:24] the Earth in the last few years they
[41:26] call UFOs the prophet said they don't
[41:28] know what it is but we know it's
[41:31] investigating
[41:33] Angels they've even stood and had their
[41:35] picture taken that's right Angelic
[41:37] beings has visited taking the word of
[41:40] God back to the father that sin is
[41:42] heaped up till the Stars can hardly
[41:44] Shine the moon in the world is reeling
[41:46] like a drunk man coming in at night
[41:49] right but no matter how dark it gets
[41:53] come on brother God never changes his
[41:55] word God's word never changes there's a
[41:59] pattern to God's word he has never
[42:02] changed this pattern of word he
[42:03] prophesies what will happen did he send
[42:06] somebody down to vindicate that amen
[42:10] like the days of Noah God said he would
[42:11] destroy the Earth he sent Noah to tell
[42:14] the people get into the ark it's going
[42:17] to rain he prophesies what will happen
[42:20] then he sends somebody down and
[42:22] vindicates that and it goes over the
[42:25] head of Millions right because Darkness
[42:28] covers the earth at that time and people
[42:30] love Darkness more than they do light
[42:34] right cuz Darkness has a lot of
[42:38] pleasure amen said I seen a Hollywood
[42:41] play not long ago said Life begins after
[42:43] the sun goes down he said that's when
[42:46] death begins right when all these
[42:48] nightclubs and where they think they're
[42:50] living they think they're living but
[42:52] they're dying right and so is it today
[42:56] that the gross darkness is coming up on
[42:58] the people and here we are friends this
[43:00] is where we're at in
[43:03] 2025 you said brother Daryl this is
[43:05] Young people's meeting I thought she was

[43:10] ahead amen gross darknesses upon the
[43:14] people he said there'll be earthquakes
[43:16] in diverse places earthquakes in diverse
[43:20] places and I looked up do you know in
[43:22] the last 24 hours in the United States
[43:25] alone there has been
[43:28] 165
[43:30] earthquakes just in the
[43:33] US just in the US over 480 some
[43:36] earthquakes worldwide in the last 24
[43:39] hours and the Bible said there would be
[43:42] earthquakes in many different
[43:45] places it only increases all the time
[43:48] the oall is getting thin the coming of
[43:50] the Lord is at hand the judgments of God
[43:53] that he spoke of he said the people will
[43:55] get to the place that they'll all away
[43:57] and gross Darkness will cover the Earth
[43:59] and when spiritual Darkness gets up the
[44:01] Earth it's the time for the enemy to
[44:04] attack that's right we're in that hour
[44:06] of gross Darkness you know I just come

[53:16] young together they were bus and Buddies
[53:19] the prophet and the King they were just
[53:20] the prophets said they were Chums and
[53:23] Isaiah stayed at the palace and he
[53:24] leaned upon the arm of the king
[53:27] and we find out this young king had such
[53:28] an influence over Isaiah right he became
[53:32] a hero to Isaiah listen to me young

[54:09] bird meant them sell into Heavens I was
[54:12] coming down through Kentucky and I come
[54:13] down this country road and this bald
[54:16] eagle fell out of the sky and he dropped
[54:18] down on the road and he picked up a dead
[54:20] I believe it was AP possum if my memory
[54:22] serves me right and I was coming down
[54:24] the road and I was watching this and
[54:25] this even e was trying to lift off the
[54:27] ground with this posum but it was too
[54:30] heavy for him and it was dragging him
[54:33] down but I watched him you know what he
[54:35] did he finally let go of it because I
[54:38] was approaching him danger was
[54:40] approaching and he finally let go of the
[54:42] thing that was holding him back and I
[54:44] say to you if you're Eagle if something
[54:46] is holding you down if something won't
[54:49] let you fly to where God want you to be
[54:52] it's time to let
[54:54] go we was bornn for the heavens come on

[55:08] was predestinated we was ordained of God
[55:11] for the
[55:12] Rapture he can put you in Jesus day he
[55:15] can have put you in Luther's day he can
[55:17] have put you in Wesley's day he can to
[55:18] put you in the age of the restoration of
[55:20] the gifts but he placed you here now
[55:22] amen right thank you Lord amen they were
[55:26] buo and buddies but this King was a bad
[55:29] influence over
[55:31] Isaiah the prophet said you see the king
[55:34] and made an example before Isaiah Isaiah
[55:36] seen that the king as soon as he got out
[55:38] of his calling God smoted him with
[55:40] Leprosy right and Isaiah thought what
[55:42] must I do Uzziah was dead he had leaned
[55:46] heavily on his arm and he thought he was
[55:47] gone what would he do life itself was
[55:49] gone for him nearly Y what did the Young
[55:52] Prophet do he made his way down to the
[55:55] temple to pray
[55:57] right he fell down at the altar and he
[56:00] cried out that's where it has to begin
[56:03] for all of us young people we know the
[56:05] altars in your heart you know what I'm
[56:07] saying but it's come to that place that
[56:10] if something is influencing away from
[56:12] God it's time to break away from that
[56:14] and come down to the Altar and settle it
[56:18] with
[56:19] God Amen you said brother darl I've had
[56:23] such a rough time sometimes if you got
[56:24] to understand some sometimes God will
[56:26] let the very prompts be knocked out from
[56:29] under us that's right sometimes he lets
[56:31] sickness strike us he lets
[56:33] disappointments heartache strike
[56:35] sometimes he does that to get you where
[56:38] you can be influenced by the word of
[56:41] God the prophet said be wise enough to
[56:44] catch it yeah don't be stupid enough to
[56:46] walk away from it right Amen brother
[56:50] what a powerful statement from the
[56:51] prophet of God be wise enough to catch
[56:54] it don't be stupid enough to walk away
[56:57] from it what's God doing Milestones
[56:59] changing our Direction I just listen at
[57:01] it coming down the road today from that
[57:03] time from that time many of us we have a
[57:07] place for for for us I was thinking
[57:09] coming on the road for us for my family
[57:11] it's from that time of the accident when
[57:14] Jessica was struck by the train and two
[57:15] of our family was killed everything goes
[57:17] back from that time our lives changed
[57:20] drastically and when you meet God from
[57:22] that time you're never the same again
[57:24] you can come to the altar you can make
[57:26] all kinds of promises you can make all
[57:27] kinds of New Year resolutions but until
[57:29] you meet God Amen
[57:32] right and have an experience for
[57:34] yourself you can't go in on dy's
[57:36] experience you can't go in on the
[57:38] pastor's experience you've got to know
[57:40] him for yourself but the most wonderful
[57:42] thing about it is he wants to know you
[57:44] that way
[57:47] amen Shades in our directions at
[57:49] Junctions of time in the altar is where
[57:52] he caught the vision he seen God sitting
[57:55] on the throne he said and I saw God
[57:56] lifted up way up above any man here on
[57:59] Earth above a Solomon or a David or a
[58:01] Uzziah God was lifted to a place that
[58:03] man could not come and then he become
[58:05] influenced of another way he saw God
[58:07] lifted up Highway up his train and when
[58:09] he saw those Mighty beings and the
[58:11] palace was filled the smoke and he
[58:13] looked at the pillars of the temple and
[58:14] the post began to shake at their voice
[58:16] he never saw that by Uzziah he saw that
[58:19] he saw that IM mortal man could fall no
[58:22] matter how much he's blessed he could
[58:24] still fall but he looked at the one who
[58:26] can not
[58:28] fall whose Foundation is sure even the
[58:31] pillars of the temple moved at their
[58:33] voices and he begin to confess he said
[58:37] woe is me right for I am undone because
[58:41] I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell
[58:43] amst the people of unclean lips for my
[58:45] eyes have seen the king the Lord of
[58:47] hosts amen and after his confession
[58:50] comes his cleansing and then from the
[58:53] cleansing come the commission amen that
[58:56] was the commission after he confessed
[58:58] and after he was
[58:59] cleansed it was then that the clean
[59:02] Isaiah answered God and said here am I
[59:05] Lord send me amen after he was cleansed
[59:09] and confessed cleansed by fire then the
[59:12] clean Isaiah was ready for work he was
[59:15] ready to be an example he was ready to
[59:17] have his life put out that others could
[59:20] be influenced by him amen right but
[59:23] until he had confessed it until he was
[59:25] clean
[59:26] he was a very poor influence right just
[59:30] a puppet for a king right you know
[59:33] brother said he was out in California he
[59:35] saw a man come walking down the street
[59:37] said I'm a fool for Jesus Christ and
[59:39] people was laughing at him and making
[59:41] fun of him and Prophet said when the man
[59:42] walked by he had a sign on his back and
[59:44] said who fool are you and the prophet
[59:47] said we're going to be somebody's fool
[59:49] right you're going to be somebody's
[59:51] puppet I say let's be surrendered out to

[1:06:25] try to get to the gate so they could
[1:06:26] catch the flight home to be with their
[1:06:28] wives and when they come around the
[1:06:29] corner they saw this girl she had an

[1:18:13] our you know I'm glad that God doesn't
[1:18:15] think like we think he said my thoughts
[1:18:18] are not your thoughts my ways are not
[1:18:19] your ways amen if we were
[1:18:24] ly minded
[1:18:26] people when we read that scripture that
[1:18:28] God would raise up a standard we would
[1:18:30] think man he's going to build some some
[1:18:32] big steel and metal and if you go to the
[1:18:34] Pentagon and they say well this person's
[1:18:36] got got a weapon and what do we do we
[1:18:39] start putting our mind together and we
[1:18:40] start putting stuff together all God
[1:18:42] wants a human
[1:18:44] flesh that's all he wants amen he wants
[1:18:47] a yielded human flesh that's the
[1:18:49] standard that God's raising in this hour
[1:18:52] and Satan can't stand it cuz that's the
[1:18:53] weakest thing that is on the face of the
[1:18:55] earth is your flesh right and God's
[1:18:57] going to use it to raise that standard
[1:19:00] up and I've always said I don't want to
[1:19:02] be in the bomb
[1:19:04] shelter I don't want to be
[1:19:07] underground all I want is for his
[1:19:10] feathers to cover me when the storm go
[1:19:14] goes to raging right I want to be under
[1:19:17] his wing I don't care about all this
[1:19:19] stuff that they make in the the military
[1:19:22] makes it'll do no good right but the
[1:19:25] word of God that we heard today apply
[1:19:28] that to your life and there's your
[1:19:30] feathers there's your wings right and we
[1:19:33] get underneath that nothing can harm us
[1:19:37] you know I was thinking yesterday they
[1:19:39] they said some of the firefighters
[1:19:41] almost got caught in some of those uh
[1:19:43] cross winds and storms and stuff and I
[1:19:45] thought well you know they're Brave
[1:19:49] they're human and they're doing their
[1:19:51] job right but there's one that walked
[1:19:53] through the fire for me
[1:19:55] amen and it didn't kill him right it put
[1:19:58] him on a cross sure but he's walking
[1:20:01] right now through your life whatever
[1:20:03] fire you're going through he's right
[1:20:05] there with you and if he can't be
[1:20:07] consumed you can't be consumed that's
[1:20:10] right but that's human nature that we we
[1:20:13] want to protect human beings and that's
[1:20:15] fine but we got a God that fire doesn't
[1:20:17] bother him at all amen you asked the
[1:20:20] three Hebrew children right it didn't
[1:20:22] bother them either God went down there
[1:20:25] with them I love what brother Ram said
[1:20:27] that time he said the angel said you let
[1:20:29] me go down there wormwood said let me go
[1:20:30] down there let me go down there God said
[1:20:33] no this one's mine I'm going down there
[1:20:36] myself and I believe he's come down here
[1:20:38] in the end time his s the son of man to
[1:20:42] live in the hearts of the people and to
[1:20:44] destroy Satan by God in human flesh not
[1:20:48] by Swords not by chemicals and material
[1:20:51] mm no our flesh that's how he's going to
[1:20:55] be defeated and that's where he beats on
[1:20:57] all the time and that's okay right but
[1:20:59] we know there's one inside of us that's
[1:21:01] greater greater is he that's in us and
[1:21:03] he that's in the world right amen you
[1:21:05] love the Lord let's give our brother a
[1:21:06] big
[1:21:07] hand wonderful
[1:21:10] job you know Isaiah was a real young man
[1:21:13] I mean really young he was very young I
[1:21:16] I think 20 or so years old so brothers
[1:21:20] sisters God can use you at that age
[1:21:23] right but you got to say
[1:21:26] as Isaiah said though first clean me up
