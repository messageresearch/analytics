TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i want to see you open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my see shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing shining in the light of your glory pour out your power in love holy i want to see him don't you good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading in hebrews 8 and ecclesiastes 12. enjoy the brother that came to be with us for the weekend hope you did had a good time with him i'm looking forward to hearing from him about you know a church to be started there in in israel because as far as i know there's groups there's people there and there's been some groups there but there's never been a message church as we'd call it to be placed there in israel now i don't think a message church would have anything to do with 144 thousand you know i just don't believe it that way some years ago believed that they were the prophet to be in the end time you know and they were supposed to go through israel before the rapture and the bride was supposed to be with them and everything else i just never have went along with all that i just kind of wait and let god take care of the things i gotta notice back there a while ago that we got it made until the year 2019 because this guy predicting that that's when the rapture's going to take place 2019 well that's a good time you know that's well down the road but i'm not wanting to be around here that long that would make me quite a many years older and i don't care nothing about it but you know so you just get all kind right amen remember now the fellowship meeting will be in alabama we will be leaving my house about 10 30 saturday and also remember that the children are going to the youth camp and they will be leaving on friday so remember these and keep them in your prayers and wade will be leaving friday to go to oklahoma to preach for the weekend and all but just pray that the lord would would take care of everybody and keep us all safe amen hebrews 8 and ecclesiastes 12. our heavenly father we thank you for the day and the time that we're living upon the earth and thank you for you and your word lord that we don't have to be concerned about dates and times and seasons and predictions that people make all we've got to do is just be ready against the day whenever that you would choose and you said that no man would know the day nor the hour so we'll just wait upon you and just believe your word it'll be right on time everything is right exactly the way that it's supposed to be but lord just help us to be ready against the day we ask you to guide us now as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts and lord just give us that understanding in jesus name amen hebrews 8 1 and then ecclesiastes 12. now of the things which we have spoken and remember what it said what is it all seven chapters previous about the lord jesus christ all right now the things which we have spoken this is the son we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens all right now we'll go to ecclesiastes and remember that's the summing up or the finishing of what ecclesiastes the preacher had to say and then he says in verse 13 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter what is the conclusion of the whole matter of all things what fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man you may be seated or that is blessing to the reading of the word now we've been studying about the sum of all things or the finishing up the completion we've been talking and the brother there sunday afternoon was preaching about you know uh coming from a partial realization to perfect or whatever and coming up and and i hope that it would was helping you to to see that's what we've been trying to say but i believe in understanding the bible that if you just jump into something and you know you you've never seen it nothing you've never heard about you jump into it and somebody tells you something glory we got it well that could be true and i don't believe it is because you've got to have a background to be able to understand anything that is in the bible or the prophet's message you know no it you got to have a background in in taking a background then that gives you something to stand on to where that when the finished product is spoken of or brought into view then you will understand what it is and and that's what we believe and that's what we've been trying to do now if you remember last wednesday night when we were talking about and and i brought that back to you because i want to tie this in together we're going to speak probably tonight and maybe sunday morning at least i don't know i'm gonna try to get through but it'll be on the seven redemptive names of jehovah all right are the seven compound names of jehovah and if you'll run in that like that on your computer and just run in seven compound names of jehovah do you know who appears first the first way place you can check on spoken word church lula george that is we are the first one on the list that gives you a place to be able to study the seven compound names of jehovah and then the next goes right on straight into brother branham and some of the tapes and the books and things in order to do but i thought that was very interesting because we make the first of the list because that's also we're number one on the list or they don't have to hunt for us they know right where we're at but you know i'm not concerned with anything other than one thing and that's it i was praying there to be ready against the day when the lord will finish his coming you know and make it into a manifestation we spoke about that for quite a while that to seeing that the coming of the lord is a revealing of his word and that he started his second coming on the day of pentecost but it will be finished in this life's days because there's a lot of things about his coming that is here in the end time to be made manifest but can be made manifest like the prophet said quickly because he said that the biggest portion of the old testament was fulfilled in a matter of a few hours at calvary so then we're not you know sitting around waiting on something but we're also not jumping out to conclusions and running away ahead we're just waiting on god to manifest himself all right now and in doing it we got to talking about you know the seven compound names of jehovah and the point that we were trying to get across is what will be very valuable tonight to understand is that brother branham you know brother dr bess had that point of arguing with him about it you know and everything and about divine healing and brother bosworth took to the point from brother branham and went up to speak on it and he asked a man a simple question he said does the seven compound names of jehovah apply to jesus christ yes or no all right see if he said uh no on any of the seven then he would have been totally out of the word but to say yes to any of the seven he would have had to agree that all the other six would tie together he so he was tied his hands and brother random said i didn't even think of that said he didn't know where to go because that was his the main point of what he was saying but now remember we were talking about and we'll get to our righteousness over in the compound names you know maybe tonight but remember we were talking about the fact that brother branham on paragraph or page 31 and i gave it to you it's on the back of your notes uh the last part and i just gave it back to you it's on the back one of the notes doesn't have a number on it but brother brown said by our union in jesus christ that we have become the very righteousness of god amen by being in jesus christ it's not me and you now it's christ in you the scripture says the hope of glory all right see then it's not what we do it's what he's already done but we must accept what he's done right but if we accept the fact that he died for us then we will have to accept the fact that we're just as righteous as god is right because the prophet sitting there to reject one is to reject the other to accept one is to accept the other well i just don't see how i can be right you can't me and you can't be righteous is his righteousness imparted unto us our righteousness is filthy rise of scripture says the best we could do would be problems with it but yet to accept what he done for us then would make us just as righteous as he is if you say well when i brother dale i believe i'm saved but i'm not perfect well what are you talking about right right but we went through the scriptures our word said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect right and we went through the scriptures where it says that if our righteousness does not exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees we won't even be able to enter heaven right so it's necessary for us to understand when the prophet said that the revelation of it was missing all right because he said it's not real to the majority of god's children in other words born-again believers right it's not real to the majority of the born-again believers that want that he is our savior and we can go along with that right but that we're just as righteous as he is well i just can't go along with that now see the reason you can't because it hasn't been revealed to you right that's no problem right it hasn't been revealed amen see have you even asked god to reveal it well i don't want him to reveal something right don't worry about it he won't he won't reveal anything that's not right because he can't right but now once then what's the point that we're going to be talking about in the seven compound names of jehovah that if we accept one of those names and it's there's more than seven all right you you've got more than seven in the redemptive names because there's only one name anyway and that name is jesus but there's more you've got rosa sharon lily the valley the bright morning star the alpha the omega you've got a lot of titles but if you'll check it you'll see that they're all contained in the seven compound names that are listed of jehovah all right now in doing it that way then if we accept one we must accept the other if we reject one of them we're rejecting the other but now watch that as we try to go through it but what i want you to do is i want us to read these things that the prophet had to say all right and then keep these and over lay backwards and forth in the message as we begin to go along you know to see the things that we're seeing all right now they won't all be together or just want to be exactly onto this we'll just be preaching from it to try to understand but let's just read some things brother branham said about it now first off remember if he's jehovah jireh the lord's provided sacrifice then he must be jehovah's canoe which is our righteousness and to accept one is to accept the other or reject one is to reject the other and if you think that you can have the new birth that new birth is where the righteousness is dwelling at because the body and spirit is not even dealing with righteousness it's right dealing with trying to be right because that's what we are ought to all be you know and we will all be right you know and righteousness comes down to the word our state or fact of being right justification shots off you past sins you'll never have to pay for that because it's it's gone it's been cut off we see then if we can ever believe that by the new birth that that new birth in you is just as righteous as god is now if we can believe that and put it into that basis we can understand the bible you know and it'll it'll help to bring all of these things into being so let's just read a while all right so we'll start off on number one on your notes believe in god 1952-224 all right we'll get back to the seven compound names in a minute and just in case some of you look over the seven compound names before i get through i took them out of the order they were in and put them in the order i wanted them okay because i want to preach the message from it in the order i want to preach it so if you go look it up on the computer you're going to find they're in different order but you'll find out what i'm talking about when we get to it now watch what brother ryan says paragraph 169 i said do you believe the seven redemptive names compound names belong to jesus if he wasn't and didn't fulfill and in him was them seven compound names now watch it if he wasn't and didn't fulfill do you think he's stumbling along no he's just exactly right and in him was them seven compound names he wasn't jehovah java if he didn't fulfill all of those things now you're listening he wasn't jehovah jireh there is jehovah genre god's provided sacrifice and you'll have to admit that or say he wasn't the son of god amen if you don't believe that he's jehovah jireh the lord's provided sacrifice then you don't believe him to be the son of god now you're reading brother adam then if he is jehovah jireh he's jealous rafa the healer also for all seven compound names our victory our banner our shield our buckler our healing our salvation our provided sacrifice all laid in him and when he died at calvary his four principalities raised up wrote his hands up said it's finished hallelujah devils trembled hell shook the went went every way and he rose up on easter morning i am he that was dead and is alive again there he is jehovah raphae manasseh you think that may be wrong but the jehovah manasseh is not even listed in or how you pronounce it right there you may n a s e h uh that's not listed among your seven compound names on what you're getting out of your computer if you run it through you know or even scofield but that is what was that was where that uh jacob named his son manasseh and you know read that see and you'll find out that those were there see jehovah jehovah god's provided sacrifice couldn't have a word to say whether we talk about the people it was arguing about listen to what he said god has a provided way 540404 now if i speak the truth that god provided a sacrifice and that sacrifice jehovah jireh was jesus christ and all the seven compound redemptive names laid in jesus christ jehovah jireh the lord's provided sacrifice jehovah rapha the lord that healed thy diseases and jehovah the banner and all the other seven compound names was all in christ jesus now all of them was in christ jesus or none of them was in christ jesus that's the point i want you to see before we go down to the names and and pick out the names throughout the scriptures and and things and show what each one related and how they would show to be jehovah jireh and jehovah kissing you and the things i want you to hear what your prophet is saying and this is just a small amount of the things that he said on these things i would suggest we did the other night we listened to the seven compound names of jehovah they're in 55 and then we turned around and listened to the one in 64 and it would be good if you went back and listened to those services about the seven compound names of jehovah all right now watch this one seven compound names with your whole 55 120 or you have 120 1955. now here we want to to make our quotation now he's going to make a quotation now i've written on the end phillip here that i carried the seven compound names of jehovah in other words it was what jehovah is is made up in these seven redemptive names of his it's what jehovah is see i like to underline them little things and think about him about them because you just read over it you know if that which always is made i mean seven times everyday no i go real slow when i'm looking on something because i want to digest it i think that's what brother dick calls it you know now god listen his attitude towards the people from eden now what was god's attitude toward the people from eden to reveal himself to the man that he had created to display all of his we'll get to it in a minute all of his attributes now that's what he wanted to do to man hmm now god is attitude towards the people from eden back to eden is wrapped in these seven redemptive names his attitude all the way through theirs in those seven names the first one being jehovah jireh which means the lord will provide a sacrifice the second one is jehovah rapha the lord the healer manasseh our banner shalom our peace broke high that's another one that's in there you know is shepherd our righteousness and sham the lord is present now you'll notice something right here and that's why i ask you to go listen to this message in 1955 listen to it with this point in mind what was your prophet talking about this is what i ask you to go listen to the tape with that thought in mind what was he talking about what what did he want to get across he tells you right here remember he said now this is our quotation now the lord shaman s-a-m-m-a-h okay somebody you know my pronunciation is not too good and i'm sorry jamal is the one i'm going to speak on from this psalm 64. now that will be the last one of the seven compound names that we will speak on but i want you to listen to that tape with the thought in mind i'm going to speak from psalm 64. in jehovah jairus first one and this is the last one jehovah jireh is the lord will provide a sacrifice jehovah shaman is jehovah is present now they the lord has blessings as we speak so listen i would ask you just listen to the tape with the thought in mind that he's speaking about the presence he's not talking about jehovah jireh jehovah rapha jehovah this can you do he's talking about his presence and it might help you to understand what i've been doing job ajara 1958 127. and i'd like for a subject jehovah jireh may he had his blessing to the word now we're going to take our time so that we'll be sure to get it god appeared to people in seven redemptive names that's his attributes to his people now if you want to know the attributes what are the attributes of god father son holy ghost redeemer savior healer etc they're all in the seven compound names but that's why i'm using the last one will be the jehovah shema because we're not dealing with that in our thinking we're only dealing with present tense time our things and we only talk about what's being done here instead of him being here okay that'll give you the point now i want to take our time so that you'll be sure to get it god appeared to people in seven redemptive names that's his attributes to his people seven compound redemptive names jehovah jairo was one jehovah arafah maybe get on that tomorrow night is 2 in jehovah manassas the shield and on down 7 redemptive names and you cannot separate those names why because if he's one he's the other you can't separate it all right he said why don't we believe that okay it's good to remind us faithful abraham 1959 424-8 now may he had his blessing to the reading of the word jehovah jireh now jehovah jireh means the lord will provide himself a sacrifice you remember that back there it wasn't that jehovah was going to just provide a sacrifice for abraham he had one the one that god told him to sacrifice right see where we'll get to this time he had one but the lord will provide himself okay we'll get to those jehovah john remains the lord's providing seven compound names so forth or back on number five okay jehovah raphael the healer and so forth jehovah our buckler job our shield and jehovah peace and all of those names are inseparable and watching that is the the nature of jehovah that he appears in that is the the nature we're on number five e7 i guess i might have jumped over one but faithful abraham 59 424 make sure everybody know what mean all those names are inseparable that is the the nature of jehovah that he appears in that's his nature jehovah jireh the lord will provide for himself a sacrifice jehovah raphael the lord that healed all of our diseases now if he isn't jehovah rafael anymore and what's him if he's not a healer anymore he also isn't jehovah genre anymore so he's not a sacrifice and he if he isn't jehovah jireh then there's no sacrifice for you and you're you're in your sins and if he is jehovah jireh the lord's provided sacrifice jesus christ then he's also jehovah raphae the lord the healer you can't you cannot separate god's nature see his compound redemptive names that's his nature that's his attributes that's his person is in those seven compound nines well all i need to know about is jesus well why are you rejecting the others i mean why what you know my brother told me one time i don't care how i get to heaven as long as i get there well i'd like to know a little bit about getting himself preaching 1961-26 i want to take that one name of jehovah george jiren god has a seven compound redemptive names jehovah jireh the lord will provide for himself a sacrifice jehovah rapha the lord that healeth thee and behold nasus and so forth our shield our banner and those names are inseparable if he's jehovah jireh then he's jehovah rapha also see and so you cannot separate those redemptive names and if jehovah raphae you know the healer wasn't applied to jesus neither was it a jehovah gyra applied to him now see you wouldn't think but if you believe that jesus wouldn't gone to the river jordan he would not have anything to do with the redemptive names of jehovah amen he would have read it have to do with redemptive names of jesus a man it wouldn't be the seven compound names of jehovah it'd be the seven compound names of jesus you understand what i'm saying if you're just making him a man what and if jehovah raphae wasn't applied to jesus neither was it a jehovah jehovah applied to him so if he's not the healer he's not the savior and if he's the savior he's also the healer and it's a finished work man sent me a big old book from india i immediately looked through and saw the boy had all this great build up of brother branham but i knew how to keep reading and while he said brother branham didn't have the message of redemption said cause he died it's a demand that's going to be malachi 4 that's going to have the message of redemption it's got to be alive when the change comes because that would be the redemption well then i turned over and looked at the pictures of him and he's getting a pretty good bit of age so things better hurry up you know i'm not making fun of him i'm just saying that you know all right job of jaira 1964 403. now god has seven redemptive names we know that and you cannot separate them from christ you can't separate them christ met every one of those compound redemptive names you believe that he you believe he's jehovah jireh the lord's provided sacrifice then what about jehovah rapha the lord healed all of thy diseases if that wasn't applied to christ then he wasn't jehovah genre so you can't separate it the whole thing's wound up and there you are he can't be jehovah jairo without being jehovah jehovah rafa without being jeweled with jiren neither can he beat jehovah jairo without being jehovah rapha he was wounded for our transmission when his strikes were healed no argument he says about it jehovah would join 1955 817 now i wish to continue my text it was found in genesis 22 and 14 and this text was jehovah jireh now god has seven redemptive names now in these compound ridiculous names it was god expressing his present attitude for all his creatures are you reading it it's what now is god expressing his present attitude for all of his creatures what it would be for them in all generations you cannot separate his compound name now this is paragraph or e5 read e6 and e7 is all in the same thing okay so now in washington dc now watch this example in washington dc uh my name is recorded it makes me that what what nationality i am who my father and mother was how much i weighed when i was born my description my prince of my thumb you see it's the expression to the nation who i am and william branham is is recorded up there in washington that's my the expression of me to the nation now that is my name so when god came down from heaven to be king over the earth he expressed himself to his subjects and seven redemptive names jehovah jireh was his first name it means god will provide for himself a sacrifice the next compound redemptive name is jehovah rapha means i am the lord that healeth thee and only he goes as jehovah our banner our peace our shield our righteousness that's what he is to us so we can't separate those names if he's still jehovah jairo he has to be jehovah rapha also if he's our provided sacrifice he has to be our healer also so the names are inseparable when we accept him as savior we must also accept him as healer as our peace as our shield as our banner all of these redemptive names god's present attitude is to his people now the same now when we accept him as savior we must also accept him as healer but i'm asking you and me a question do we accept him as healer the way we accept him as savior i'm serious asking a question do we accept him as our healer the way we accept him as our savior now we try to explain about healing because we're quick to quote that we can be healed or something and die the same thing the next day but what are we doing if he's our savior now where's your savior at i don't i'm trying to get on his name now i gotta get away from that in a minute because i don't know i'll get hung up on but just let me say that where's your savior well he's sitting up in heaven on the throne where's your savior he's inside of you right all right so where's your healer same place that's right no no no no brother healing healing is on a different basis you see there now you explain that away so you've proven that your healer and your savior is not the same so you're trying to justify something instead of just facing it out front but we won't die take the same example on the healing and apply it to our salvation he said yeah well i i'm i'm sick for the glory of the lord i like the way brother moak said it it's a good point did you say well i've got a leg off for the glory of the lord well why don't you cut the other one off and give him double glory is that any problem are you being sarcastic no i'm not you're the one that's sarcastic because you're not thinking about what i'm saying do we take our healer the same way we take our savior all right i'll back off of that because i want to get back to it so what do we end up saying when we accept him as savior we must accept him as healer as our peace our shield as our banner all these redemptive names god's present attitude to his people now the same e6 time of decision 1959 418 he's talking about coming down the round the offering up on the mountain and things because he's jehovah jireh the lord will provide himself a sacrifice and he's just as much jehovah jireh tonight as he was then and if he's jehovah jireh he's jehovah rapha also another redemptive name which is jehovah the healer the names are the compound names of jehovah and they are absolutely inseparable he's jehovah shield jehovah butler butler jehovah our banner jehovah healer drove our sacrifice and you cannot accept those names for if he ceases to be jehovah rapha then he's not jehovah jireh and if he's still jehovah jireh he's still jehovah rapha both savior and healer now i'll get back to this so i've said to you keep these notes look at him when he gets on the jehovah gyra i'm excuse me seven combat names in jehovah 1955 120. remember he's talking about the presence of the lord remember what i said a while ago did you write that down in the seven compound names with jehovah's message he's speaking about jehovah jeremiah now the lord is our refuge and strength the very present help in the name of trouble in time of truth and in the redemptive names s-h-a-m-m-a-h jamal the lord is present now jehovah jireh will provide jehovah the provider is present you get what i mean if he is the lord's provided sacrifice then he's got to be the lord god present in the time of trouble a time of hell need see what i mean did you read that if he's the lord provided sacrifice he's got to be the lord god present in the time of hell i believe that's the worst problem that we all have me all the way to the back right and anybody down in the basement anybody else listening to these tapes or listening to them does it go out on the internet i believe that's our problem we don't recognize him as being present we recognize him as coming on his way a journey yeah we don't recognize him as being president where's your savior what was the question logo where's your savior in your soul where's your healer right now if he is here tonight to save anybody from sin listen he's got to be present tonight to fulfill the rest of those redemptive names right you see why he was preaching on joel sacrifice our healer our banner our peace our shepherd our righteousness and his presence he's got to be all that right now in the last thing at the last one of his redemptive names that he appeared to abraham he said i'm jehovah raphae the provided one for to produce a sacrifice provide the way whatever it is god will provide it i am jehovah that healeth thee i am thy righteousness what was he saying to abraham i am thy peace i am thy shield i am thy banner and i'm ever present to perform it amen you see what i mean never present to perform it i the lord has spoken now the lord hath planted i see it i'll water it day and night let some pluck it from my hand yeah now i'll tell you something that he's done in that because he goes on to tell the story he was out hunting which was really his honeymoon with his wife and billy paul you remember he left them and went up on the mountain to hunt and he told him to stay there he got up on the mountain and he killed a deer and he got lost you remember the story he thought he was a god and he kept running around and round around and come right back to the same place and didn't death walk he thought i can't be he said i never cured a compass he said you know he was too good of a guy he said if it wasn't for my wife and my boy down there i'd just crawl up in one of these caves or a hole here and i never have understood what he said about that because i didn't know where you could eat them but he said i just eat some pine cones and wait it out for a few days said then i'd climb up on the mountain somewhere and i'd get my directions and walk them out he said but my wife and boy was down there and said they couldn't survive said it'd be well into zero tonight and said they didn't know how to survive so he kept running around and around trying to convince himself that he wasn't lost that's it but finally he had to come to realize right and the lord kept telling him i'm a present help in a time of trouble he kept speaking louder and louder to it and he said well lord and he turned around and he said well this has got to be it i'm going the right way you remember he come to find out he's heading to canada right on straight up from where they're going he said the fog pulled back and he looked over and saw this mountain you know whatever it was there and he said he knew he was going wrong but he still couldn't find his way remember he finally found the the line that they had put in to run the telephone line up to the to the place he found his way out but he said that voice kept saying i'm an ever present help in a time of trouble but you see church we don't put our whole thing on the thinking of how that if one part of his name applies then the other part has to apply with equal status every how you say it equal amount is he a big god as jehovah jireh and a smaller one as banner banner is he greater on one thing than on the other what are we believing to be do you realize that see that's what i've tried my best to get you to see about the presence of the lord because many many many years ago probably close to 30. i told you then i said i'm not talking about the coming of the lord somewhere else i'm not concerned about going there i'm concerned about getting god here that's what i've been trying to do but do we put equal quality upon each redemptive name do we value them all as the sign or do we put one above the other when we do we make him not to be hebrews 13 8. because if he's the lord our sacrifice why can't we believe him to be the lord or healer and brother i truly believe i i just believe and there is just nothing in the world that you can do to try to talk me out of the fact that i'm saved what are you doing trying to prop yourself up you trying to convince me who are you trying to convince amen come on yeah i know i don't preach like other preachers i'm not that great robust to get you to look at jehovah jaira jehovah rafa and you're just as righteous but if we leave any one of those names and make it of lesser value how can it be god that is being revealed and are we looking at it like our banner we'll get to that one that well i ain't been doing pretty too good but maybe the lord come on the scene and be my banner be my help now you think god had to come on the scene to the prophet turn the mountain or was god already there god already knew what he was going to do for abraham when he got there what are we thinking about it well brother dale i i i she's my my savior and i just can't believe from a healing why not maybe we're proving by our lives of the fact that we can't believe certain things that we don't believe other things is that ring of bell we we can see him as our savior but then we have to look somewhere way off or some if brother branham would just come back and tell us with healed so now then you'd have to say if brother brown would come back and tell us we're saved turn off on nobody what you believe is your business i'm just trying to preach the truth do we have god in degrees as the seven compound names do we put him to be bigger in one form than he is in another form can we say that by the new birth my soul is just as righteous as god is and really believe that can we believe it what a problem but yet we said we don't have no trouble believing him as savior when brother today allowed just simple i just accepted him as my savior well did he accept you what your prophet said now you go argue with him he said did god accept you well brother dale i go to brothers georgios church and i just feel so wonderful and i just feel so saved and so glorious and i come up here and you just beat me down what have i told you anything tonight's not right how have i said anything that's not right have we not read exactly what the prophet you claim to believe has to say you see brother dale you're not putting it like to where we can have an opportunity to receive something why not what good is it for me to pat you on the back and you pat me on the back and then we wind up in the tribulation patting each other on the back right you missed the rapture now what good is that when we sure loved one another we patted on the back you know we patted right on the end of the tribulation and if we're in a tribulation we're not in the bride of christ well she doesn't know that right right so it's not that you turned him down as your healer you turned him down as your savior no no i believe him as my savior do you believe he's your healer the same way we don't have much problems telling everybody we're saved right right come on be serious i try to because that's what i try to preach because patting you on the back and everything else ain't gonna do no good but we we're easy to say that we're saved and brother you can't tell me i ain't saved i ain't never tried to tell nobody they would but on the same respect he's right here on the same respect he's our righteousness not to ex listen i know i'm i'm just going to quit it on that ain't going to go into the night it's not to try to to confess ourselves into something it's got to be revealed to us right right that's why the prophet said during the church eighth book page 31 he said the revelation of it is missing from the majority of the people the revelation of what that they're not as righteous as god is so big believing that you're not as righteous as god is you're rejecting that you're saved because see you're looking out here right you're not looking at the inward man you're not looking at the new birth you're still not nicodemus you mean i gotta go back to my mother's womb you may not gotta go start doing better you mean i gotta quit this i gotta quit that i gotta go do this i gotta go do that reject one is to reject the other to accept one is to accept the other we've got to realize folks that the confessing of our mouth is one thing but a believing in our heart is connected to salvation or is not right see so we believe in our heart the correct thing and then when he confessed the correct thing then god has to honor his word but we're not going to be here that's why i changed the order of the thing of bread around the hole he said first it's job ajirah lord's provided sacrifice second is always jehovah or healer because that's what he was dealing with out in the public right and i changed the order of that because i believe if we don't understand the order we will never understand what is being said so look at the order of it and just make sure you bring this back look at the order of how that i brought them and divided them up but it's not a walk through our life and we got him as jehovah jireh and then we walk a little more and we gotta get your whole area and then when we walk a little further we get him with jehovah this canoe and then we get him as jova gray fine then we walking by revelation yes but not trying to walk into the things we're not going to walk in to make him a healer that's where our trouble is now i didn't say it so you can't argue with me your prophet said true genuine christians come across the platform and not get healed and he said sinners come across and be healed now what's the problem must be something that we're trying to figure out because you know what i like about it i'm talking about me as well as you because see i get it then come preach it to you brother brown said the first person that was ever saved he said was saved by the blood all right so now we'd automatically go over able right the first one that was saved by the blood because he offered and he said if anybody ever reaches that place god will have to save them or he acted wrong the first time now my quote brother branham he said if anybody was ever healed anywhere you'd automatically know that they were an old testament person right and not have the new birth right he said the first person was ever healed he said if you ever reach that place you'll be healed too and you see that's what that prostitute or whatever across the platform they reached that place at the first person was healed now brother is different now show me all right bring you the prime of the prophet's message and show me he said if anybody was ever healed and you ever reach that place god's obligated to heal you or he acted wrong the first time now am i saying what he said yeah but you don't understand my case that's where the problem is god don't have a case he's got his word we the ones got cases like i said if brother branham would come back and lay his hands on us now he run around and lay his hands on the first person that got healed no did abraham do anybody want a name there's no record of who the first person was healed as far as i know of in the bible what do you understand there must be something wrong the revelation is what's lacking right right did we make it something that it's not i've had people to make fun of me you know maybe not meaning wrong way but say brother you just believe what people say well now that's a pretty good start in the right direction you know what because if you don't believe what people say you get a problem yeah you just believe what anybody says yeah wade comes up and tells me he's seen a pink alpha you know wait ain't no pink elephants some of you dropped seen them and you know today they have pink elephants because they paint them you know like the prophet said it's hard to get one person to believe another you know what's the biggest disgrace that i can think of about a christian to have to do in the world today is to swear to tell the truth right amen that's the biggest disgrace to christianity i could ever think of is to swear to tell the truth hey brother colleen come tell me something i said brother colleen would would you swear about that you know what i mean i don't believe him so how's that i don't believe him what is it then what's our problem our problem is just what i've tried to say we put our salvation in this line over here that is seemingly an easy way to go that we confess and we we keep confessing and we won't die or take anything in contrary but yet we put our healing off onto something else in some other way how can we do that when he's the same what's the difference you never talk to a good bad distance not a trinitarian trinitarian because the baptist believed in god in three persons but you know the blessed trinity but you ever talk to one and they say if i deny the father i've denied the son if i deny the father or the son i'm lost so i gotta have the three a good catholic goes up with their their things and just trying to get mary involved in it and we laugh and make fun of them oh my god but what about it right we want to blame everybody else for the fact that we're sick tonight instead of accepting our own south and where we're at when i brought brother down hold on a minute now now john was righteous perfect and god put him through a bit of that do you know that god is putting you through the things you're going through do you has he told you well then how do you know but get the point just using java jar and joe horace but i hope you hold that form in your mind of thinking that if we make one of these compound name to be over here that's easily reached this was a little harder and this one's a little harder or this one's a little easier and this is what are we doing right we're certainly not believing hebrews 13 8 do you see if he's your savior he's your healer did the anything extra happen at calvary now don't get ahead of me quote mine's okay did anything extra happen at calvary to heal you and he said what but no no don't wait he was striped okay that's fine but do you believe the striping of the lord jesus christ without the death of calvary would have healed anybody simple question give me a simple answer had he not died on the cross would the stripes done any good come on folks it's faith in the blood that heals you it's not the blood that splatters on you it's faith in the blood it's faith in the life that was in the blood that's why god didn't have no problem putting it together he's wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity with his strife we are healed he put it all together but is there any healing apart from calvary no because he's jaw vagina and if he's jehovah gyra he's jehovah rapha if he's your rafa he's jehovah this can you if he's all of that then he's jehovah's your mom which means he's present right right that wrong last night as i listened in the prophet where it kept ringing in his ears and saying i'm the ever present god right in the ever present god why would we be afraid if we believe god is with us right well now in a way that's a problem you know why not brother dale you could say that george iron jarvis is the same you know okay but you get this before we finish it had he not died on the cross he wouldn't be our banner he wouldn't be our righteousness he wouldn't be our shield he wouldn't be our shepherd there's two of those compound names that are not written out in the scriptures the lord is our shepherd that's his name but there's not a jehovah rayah didn't there so if you look at it look down through there you'll find a couple of them that have no place other than what we place upon it because we must see now i asked you to do this i was running through some references on the computer and checking what other people had to say about the seven compound names i ran across a very interesting from a man and i thought yep i want you to read the 23rd psalm all right over and over and over because all seven compound names of jehovah is applied in psalms 23. just read it over and over the lord is my shepherd i shall not want think about him making me to lie down he's my banner he's my shield he's my buckler he's my healer he's my all in all and jesus is his nighttime brother take on these things but just remember the point if you take him as one thing you must accept him with equal value amen as to any of the other things it must be done cannot be that you accept him as one thing but yet you won't accept him as another well i kind of see it but i don't know well it's what we need a revelation we need a revelation what you got brother what you got i know you came up for some reason so what is it thank you let's stand together amen anybody has a need the owner is open the lady over to nursing home told dawn here and um brother tom sharon with her and her husband passed on and she said it will he come in here saying he's healed and he left he was still she had stroke cancer you know and she wanted her name on the cancer list there which we did and i saw tom's uh to take tour i got some in the car but i thought i thought to myself it'd be better that that it was uh something fresh amen amen amen amen amen anybody have a need the altar is open the world because you are the savior you're the healer you're the all and all in jesus christ so now this reach down and touch our little buddy and deliver him father from this we believe you that by your stride everybody's healed and we thank you in jesus name amen anybody else her little buddy needs to hang up lord him whatever capacity it is in him lord he can understand that jesus christ died for our sins that we might accept him as our savior and father that we might confess we say lord you've saved me and me we thank you father we just ask you to touch our buddies he needs healing in his body we know he does lord lord jesus is the lady that was there is the one that's wanted we send it to him to be able to be delivered to her in some way we ask you father that you want you have your way in jesus name me that i will give you some you believe what the devil puts in her ways me is what can we do you know whether you can believe is do you believe it our sister is asking about that you'll make it better and heal earth and just bless your lord as jesus jesus you know what you can give do please we ask you to come on the scene and make manifest the lord have heard let it be a manifestation in jesus name and i didn't get healed thank you it's easy to say my girl was healed i was with him we've seen his heart go back into rhythm same confession what do you do brother dale i just keep saying god thank you thank you for healing me thank you for healing me lord you say well don't you feel bad i'm a human i don't let that get in the way i just keep saying thank you lord thank you lord thank you for saving me just say it is we're all sick and happy trying to get god to get back up on a tree or trying to get him to be beat again we've been around here a lot of us a long time i challenge you if i would do that what about god i can't keep my word every time because i'm human but he can't fail to keep his hearts words be raised is oh listen church the things that we've seen go to be able to believe because we've seen a lot of things here we've seen a lot of healings we've seen a lot of things happen but you know it's just too simple we were going to alabama to a meeting one time with david's right we stopped by brother dicks and sister gayles and connie connie had been having headaches i never prayed or didn't do anything i walked over to her and i said gave her a quarter i just handed her a quarter i said connie i want to buy that headache that you got see a lot of people wouldn't understand that because you think it's on something they ain't right no i was just making a contact with her she said okay you've got it we drove up the highway and been gone for i don't know 30 minutes or something the dicker gave one call back home and said how you doing she said the headache's coming it was just that simple see it's a contact it's not a gimmick it's a contact that you make and you can believe it brother around and said it's not in other words he said well robert's never said they say lay your hand on the radio he said it's just a contact did you make it it's all to believe in god just accept him and believe him or whatever it be lord jesus we could stand and talk about you all night lord because you're so wonderful let me just ask you to help us all help us to understand how simple it is and how wonderful it is to see you as all in all and jesus is your name to see that all of those names whatever it would be back to their those titles those references to what you were for those people that father you're still hebrews 13 8 you always will be with the people on the highway give a safe journey and just bless everybody open the eyes of our heart lord that we may see you and walk in you and jesus is your name you're dismissed
