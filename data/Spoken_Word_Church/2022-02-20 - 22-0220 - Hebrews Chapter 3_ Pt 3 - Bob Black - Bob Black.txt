TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god bless you thanks good morning all right we're made it to hebrews chapter 3 verse 8. in a little study in hebrews chapter 3 verse 8 says hard not your hearts as in the provocation and the day of temptation in the wilderness when your father's tempted me proved me and saw my works 40 years wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do always air in their heart and they have not known my ways so i swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest now provocation as we were examining last time last week provocation has went is is something you do to make somebody really annoyed or angry so the provocation in the wilderness is when uh you know that to to to make god upset with us is when we when we disbelieve his word and really you know whenever anybody says something it's it's a a horrible slight it's a it's an insult to not believe what somebody says you know if you tell if you tell somebody i'm going to do something for you and they don't they don't believe it or i'm going to be there at such a time and they don't believe you and they're they're late or whatever it it's it becomes something that's a little insulting now think about how god feels and we don't believe his word now so so this whole story that we're they're kind of unfolding the provocation is uh that paul is talking about here the provocation is these people that cannot enter into the rest and and when we go on over into hebrews chapter four hebrews chapter four talks more about what that rest is with the rest the rest is when you're not you're not laboring anymore you're you're uh god's doing you you enter into a place where you're settled and god's god's the one that's doing the work and you don't you're not say maybe thrashing anymore so if we go to the next slide brother said they heard it but they didn't believe it god come down he showed them a pillar of fire showed by his prophets signs and wonders he was with him they didn't believe it oh they like to see the miracles they like to hear the prophet but as far as believing it they didn't their lives proved they didn't now he said don't you fall after that same example of unbelief for in this last days to the gentile church god has appeared again same sign same wonder same pillar of fire vindicated proven let us not harden our hearts and fall in that temptation back yonder of unbelief will for will rot on earth and that'll be all of it now if we go to the next slide what we were kind of getting at last last uh sunday is is is to really get the full uh gist of what this is talking about you have to see where you are and you know when you when you read the word and you when you come to church the word begins to open up and reveal to you where you are again whether that's you're you're not born again or you are born again and you're going through a journey up to the adoption or you're or you are adopted and now the seals can become open to you and god can reveal to you that the whole plan of redempt of your redemption and that it's been done and how to take a body change so all of those things now that you kind of picture in your mind the bulk really of a christian life happens at this little place of sanctification joint going through the wilderness getting all these going through a testing time and getting these things purged out of us and and god examining our faith to see if we're really going to stand the test and and believe his word in spite of all the obstacles so as you look at what all these things that the children of israel were going through they went through a lot of hard times and and a lot of rough things happened and and and strange things and and yet uh in all just about every time they faltered and they failed to believe god's word and then they would begin to blame moses and aaron and and say well god judge you and all these kind we'll examine these things in a little bit and so really as we look through these things maybe just take a moment to examine our own heart and see could we be doing the same things today that they were doing back then because wherever you are in your journey if you disbelieve god's word is going to prevent you from coming to that stage of rest whether that's a new birth or adoption or a body change so on the next slide we look to that journey again that uh just i'm just gonna run through some of these for a quick background justification sanctification the baptismal holy ghost is the journey of a believer and on the next slide going up from go to go to the next slide one more you go you're you go through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost now you're born again and now you're of faith and then as uh as paul said i think it's first corinthians if those who he has predestinated he called and those he called he justified and those he justified he's already glorified now we're talking about now you're justified and so you begin to be purged as you go through the statue of a perfect man god cleaning you out cleaning your life and then you can be baptized with the token the true baptism of the holy ghost the baptism holy ghost on your life to be in reveal what's the baptism of the holy ghost god he's trying to get you to a place to play when you when you're born again he gets you to a place where you can believe he fills you with his life and now he's the one doing the believing let's go and he as paul said in galatians the life that i now live i live by the faith of the son of god is his faith now in you believing so now when he gets you to adoption now he comes and he's got you to a place again where he can begin opening up the word to you you really really now message preachers in this day we're we're supposed to really be preaching you're not really even preaching the message to you preaching preaching that that message that's what we're trying to get everybody to a place where we can preach the message but not just some little baby form but actually preach the message because then the seals can be opened up to you and the word can really be opened up to you that so that we can go we can take a body change so when you go up to adoption now now where you're on a journey you're on a journey to take a body change and that's the final baptism of the holy ghost that's that's uh that's that's really deep well i guess now brother brahman an adoption message in 1960 he said there was three stages of the journey and there's three stages of this journey for we are justified by faith believing on the lord jesus christ forsaking the land of egypt come out and then are sanctified through the offering of his blood washed from our sins and become pilgrims and sojourners claiming that we are seeking a land a city that's coming or a promise so did israel in the wilderness sojourners no place to rest traveling night after night following the pillar of fire but finally come to the promised land where they settled down and so the promised land is your rest and the promised land is the baptism of the holy ghost that's what you've been promised and in that there's a lot of things like like uh there's a lot of things that go into the baptismal holy ghost like we were just explaining it's more than just a little one uh one little baby form thing there's but as it unfolds it becomes richer and richer and there's and and each stage brings you to a place of rest don't you know that after you climb the statue of perfect man and you finally get to where you're going now you can rest but you ain't done yet there's more to it but now in hebrews chapter 3 brother brown said he said paul trying to get later on get down here the experience that he had trying to relate the experience he typed it to the old testament he said now we've entered into a new thing to this new dispensation by jesus christ old times the lord appeared to them by the prophets that's hebrews 1 but now he's by his son jesus now he said they enter not because of their unbelief they did not believe but now we move into a dispensation and don't you harden your heart don't you act like they did in the days of provocation when they provoke god now listen to this now how do they do it how do they provoke god not by living immorally he said let me grind this down to you you say brother branham i go to church that's all right i never lied in my life that's fine i never stole i've never done this that or that sounds like the rich young ruler i've kept all these things all these things have i done that's very fun that's all good but that still isn't sin the sin is when god shows himself and you disbelieve it you won't listen to it when god shows you and you won't listen to it now see see see it disbelief now this that's maybe a sticking point i'm born again can i disbelieve god's word well now now think about adam and eve in the garden of eden had the holy ghost had had the life of god down in their soul but yet here comes the certain along and gives them a little something off the word and it and it and they get snared in it now now see when when you as you're going up the statue of perfect man you're born again but yet you still have problems like somebody will say something somebody will we'll point out maybe some things in the message that seem like they're contradictory and you get all confused and if you don't if you're not looking at it right you'll you'll just you'll you'll cast it aside and say i don't i don't i don't i i don't agree with that and you won't be able to go further so now let's let's examine some of these things harden out your hearts on the next slide as in the provocation now there's 14 times if you run through the story of exodus and numbers it carries on into numbers where and and i'm not going to linger too much on these things because um i mean you could you could spend weeks and weeks on on each one of these but we're just going to take a quick a quick tour of some of these things that the israelites did as they were journeying out of out of egypt now the first thing they did when before they even really got started was was uh when moses went down there with a message and he came and he said i'm i'm coming to deliver you and they uh pharaoh heaped on he started heaping on them all of the some extra work and uh and and they said no it says here in exodus chapter 5 verse 19 and the officers of the children of israel did see that they were in an evil case after it was said ye shall not minish all from your breaks of your daily task and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from er from pharaoh and they said unto them the lord look upon you and judge the lord look upon moses and judge because you have made our savior to be abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hand to slay us so right away they get uh they're starting on their journey and they they get a little bit of hardship now in that what we do we when we get a little bit of hardship you know you think about all the hard things that brother branham had to endure in his life watching god uh allow his wife and his baby to die and and uh just the story of the flood and just on and on and on but yet he he kept pressing on and you you go read like for example hebrews 11 and you can see all the hardships that isaiah had to endure as he was being chased by manassas we were talking about wednesday night being killed and all the different ones that were uh thrown into the uh eaten by lions and all those sorts of things and you know when when you get a into a hard place at work or or a hard place with your family it's not time to turn back it's not time to get slack or it's not time to stop believing god's word but it's time that's that's when you should really buckle down and say it's hard but yet i'm i'm i'm holding on or there's something holding me that i'm i'm believing despite all the obstacles despite all the circumstances and things that i can see i'm believing despite everything that i can see now see they in their disbelief what did they do and you'll see this echoed all throughout all of these all of these provocations they turn their blame not they instead of looking at themselves their self they turn their blame on moses and that's a strange a strange uh symptom of the human condition to look to not just blame somebody else but to blame to blame the preacher to blame to blame the one that's trying to help them out and they turn their turn their finger pointer on the preacher and say it's the preacher's fault why are my family's in this condition or it's the preacher's fault why things don't seem to be going on and they said the lord look upon you and judge because we're going through a hard time now let's go on to the next one when they got to the red sea and this is where brother brown preached that sermon why christ speak and you know if you go back and listen to that he uh he he backgrounds for most of that sermon talks talks about how he all these things that they had seen the plagues and all of these things that had built up that where they should have moses especially he should have been built up to a place where he knew what his purpose was and they got there and the egyptians were marching after them and that and the children of israel said and they said unto moses in verse 11 because there were no graves in egypt i still taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt with us to carry us forth out of egypt now now you think about what egypt means egypt means and we'll see here in a second it means that they called it the the the bible calls it the flesh pots of egypt that we've left the flesh pots and and egypt egypt represents all that trash that you're leaving behind and all the time they were going through they were going through this journey they kept looking back to the trash and looking or or let's say like this depending on where you are in your journey looking back to their previous condition looking back you know when you're an adult you don't want to go back to being a baby and when you're when you're when you're born again you don't want to go back to being a sinner but yet they kept looking back to i i wish we were it would have been better for us to be back in that condition than where we are now following the pillar of fire following a god chosen man following you know god with us god causing water to come forth from the rock giving us everything we need giving us bread with us with us day by day it would have been better you think what a strange thing but yet even even today people still exhibit that same trait i would rather i would rather be in my previous condition and they said wherefore hast thou dealt with us is not this the word that we did tell thee in egypt i told you this was going to happen saying let us alone let us alone that we may serve the egyptians now you think about the grace of god to rescue like light lot down there where the angels actually had to put their hands on him and say let's go and god in his grace will come and and and give us a word and give us ministers to deal with us and and almost like sometimes seems like forcing us to get out let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness let's go to number three and when they finally got to some more hard times they got to a place they the first place that god sent them was the bitter waters where they got to a place where where uh the waters they thought were going to be fresh and they were bitter now they started murmuring against moses in verse 24. what shall we drink they needed some water to drink and instead of realizing that that same god that part of the red sea the same god that caused all the plagues and changed pharaoh's hearts so he said i'll let you go and and gave him gold and everything as they were leaving go take from gold from your neighbors and provided everything they had need of instead of realizing that that same god was on the scene to make those waters pure again they started murmuring again against moses what shall we drink and he cried unto the lord and the lord showed him a tree showed him now you see he went over there and he grabbed the tree he knew what to do he knew you know think about how jesus is typed with the tree he's a true the tree of life and that tree of life was crucified on the tree so he moses went over and and and grabbed the tree and threw it in the water and it became pure again and he said and it says when he cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved them and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes i will put none of these diseases upon thee which i have brought upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee now if they have that same kind of promise we've got that same kind of promise today and when you get into a bad time when you get to bitter waters or whatever these stories that we're reading through whatever situation don't do like them but just believe god that's that's all he expects us of us is just to believe in so they kept marching on and they they got to the fourth provocation they got to a place where they they got a little bit hungry and it says they took their journey from elam and all the congregation of the children of israel came into the wilderness of sin now now you notice that next the next one after this is thirst this one's hunger and the next one's thirst and god we so many times we look for things things outside of the word outside of the spirit of god to quench our hunger and thirst just like they they started they started looking back to where they come from i i wish i wish i had all all of the stuff in egypt now this is the the scripture where it says about flesh parts and the children of israel said unto them what to god we have died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt when we set by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the full for you have brought us forth under this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger now you know isn't that an interesting word flesh pots flex pots really has a double meaning it means like a bowl full of meat yeah but it also means like las vegas it means like the sin of the world and so they were they were wanting to go back into that now now you think they they were at a place all all that background and yet they wanted to go back into that that place of sin and then said the lord unto moses behold i will reign bread from heaven for you now you see how how easy it is easy it was for them to to just get they they they didn't realize that god was with them and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law now let's give the next one the number number five and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys according to the commandment of the lord and pitched him to fit them and there was no water for the people to drink you remember brother graham preached that sermon thirst or sermons lots of sermons on thirst about how that you try to quench that thirst that god has given you that holy thirst with the things of the world and instead of that that thirst that god has given you is a thirst for him and and and god god provided he provided a way for their thirst to be quenched here when he told moses to smite the rock and there shall come water out of it now now when he smoked that rock i i know we know the dramatization it wasn't just a little trickle but it was a great big gusher that the bible says it came forth as a river and paul said and uh uh it is i might be first corinthians i think it's first corinthians he said that that rock followed them that it followed them through the wilderness so wherever they went that rock was with them that they could you think about that they could look over there and see that that rock was being provided that the water was being provided for them a continual stream enough to feed two million people and yet you know even today when you when you come into church into the sanctuary of the lord and and and you and you might be thirsty you might be uh you you know there's something wrong in your life and yet that that same rock is still here today to satisfy that that holy thirst that god has given to you to quench that thirst if you'll just if you'll just reach out and let him let it open up your heart and let that thirst be quenched now now the sixth one is a is a real interesting one because moses goes up now you think about what moses was doing brother brown said when he went to the to the top of that mountain god gave him the seals that you think why why would the ten commandments be the seals because the ten commandments is the revelation the revelation of jesus christ written on those tables of stone as is the attributes that will be manifest that god wanted to manifest in a believer that you're going to worship the lord like god with all your heart that you're going to put god before everything else that you're going to honor your father and mother you're not going to tell lies and you're not going to steal and and all the other things that are written in the ten commandments and and so moses went up there and and to get to to get the seals and he came down from the mountain with the seals and nobody wanted to have none of it they would rather have their golden calf they rather have their own ideas than than what god had that what the god's prophet had gone up to the mountain to to receive from the actual finger of god himself that god wrote with himself by himself the message that he came down from the mountain with and the lord said unto moses go get thee down for thy people which thou brought us out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed there unto and said these be thy gods o israel which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt think about what a statement to say that this not not the god of abraham and isaac and jacob but this golden calf is how we came out of egypt what a statement and this is the first time that moses intercedes for the people now we'll read through that that god god gets to he as as they provoke him and say and say that they disbelieve he they get they get him to a place where he's just ready to destroy them all and start over again and every time he does that then moses and brother brown explained that moses is his is christ in moses and it's stepping in the way and saying don't what what are all the other nations going to think if you you've promised that you were going to take us to the promised land and if you wipe the slate clean then then everybody's going to look at you and think that you're not fulfilling your word and and and each time moses would step in in the way and intercede for the people right you think again about the grace of god and number seven they started complaining about the manna and when they compl after eating all that you know you think the bible tells us what manna looked like it was it was the size of a coriander seed and it looked like vidalia which is a little brown and like kind of a little bit glossy or whatever so it was real small in other words it was hard to get you had to go out and do some work for it and so just like us we've got we kind of got to go through our bible and spend some time uh you know the preacher preaches hard things and and you don't understand it and and then you got to go home and and meditate on it and and pray about it and and they got they got a little bit frustrated with the process every day they had to go out and they couldn't even keep any over they had to go out the next morning because if they kept any over then it would get it would get rotted up and so they had to keep doing it every day and just like us we've got to keep going we can't get stagnant we got to keep going back and and reading and studying you know i was i was talking to my wife the other day about how when you when you the message is so supernatural and and i'm about to wrap up here when you read a message the first time you read it you think okay well that kind of makes sense but then you go back again oh i missed that the last time and then you go back again and oh there's something else that unfolds and it just keeps unfolding and unfolding because it's supernatural and you can't get frustrated like these did and stop and say i'm so tired of this word the musicians can go ahead and come forward i'm so tired and and when moses got to hear and how they were so tired he said lord just kill me he said if thou deal thus with me i ca kill me i pray thee out of hand if i have found favor in thy sight and let me not see my righteous richness and this is when god put his spirit that was in moses on the 70 men and and kind of gave him a little respite gave gave the seven gave him 70 men to help him out a little bit god bless you
