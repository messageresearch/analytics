[5:28] and the hour that we're living and truly
[5:30] Lord if anybody could ever see the day
[5:33] that they're living

[5:43] around the world and everything getting
[5:45] ready
[5:47] We Just Praise Your Great Name if we

[5:51] word to show yourself unto us and speak
[5:54] to our hearts that we may walk in the
[5:56] light of Your Love forgive our sins
[5:59] and lead us by thy Grace in Jesus name
[6:04] Revelations 1
[6:08] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[6:11] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[6:13] things which must shortly come to pass
[6:15] and he said and signified it by his
[6:17] Angel unto his servant John
[6:20] because by record of the word of God
[6:21] under the testimony of Jesus Christ and
[6:24] of all things that he saw blessed is he
[6:27] that readeth and they that hear the
[6:29] words of this prophecy and keep those
[6:31] things which are written therein for the
[6:34] time is at hand and now let's go over to
[6:39] Revelation 16 re-read where we're at
[6:41] because we haven't finished this part
[6:43] yet
[6:44] going on down into Armageddon
[6:47] inherent this evening to we took part of
[6:50] it Sunday morning but when I go on all
[6:52] right Revelations 16 13.
[6:55] and that's all three unclean spirits
[6:57] like frogs come out of the mouths of the
[7:00] dragon out of the mouth of the Beast and
[7:03] now the mouth of the false prophet all
[7:04] right now we know that the dragon is
[7:07] wrong
[7:08] the Beast is the power you know the the
[7:12] the the power of of that Rome and then
[7:16] the false prophet is the pope right
[7:19] around explaining those things unto us
[7:22] we'll read in just a minute
[7:24] for they are the spirits of devils
[7:27] working miracles which go forth unto the
[7:29] kings of the earth and if the whole
[7:31] world together them to the Battle of
[7:32] that great day of God almighty behold I
[7:36] come as a thief blessed is he that
[7:38] watches and keepeth his garments lest he
[7:40] walk naked and they see his shame and he
[7:43] gathered them together into a place
[7:45] called in the Hebrew tongue
[7:47] Armageddon you may be may be seated the
[7:49] Lord had his Blessing to the reading of
[7:52] the word
[7:54] now we were covering our
[7:57] Sunday and trying to you know emphasize
[8:02] some pains on this uh three unclean
[8:06] spirits like frogs the prophet said it
[8:08] went out of the mouth of someone when we
[8:10] read there in the scripture where it
[8:11] does and and what it is is the same
[8:14] Doctrine
[8:16] all right so then we found that natural
[8:19] Rome
[8:21] which was you know hedonistic many gods
[8:26] Etc then it was converted into papal
[8:30] Rome
[8:31] and papa wrongdin came up with the
[8:34] trinitarian concept
[8:36] you know and if not fully three Gods
[8:40] into the point of God and treat persons
[8:42] blessing Trinity you know and coming out
[8:45] to be the same Trinity and then we saw
[8:48] that that they were three uncleans these
[8:51] three unclean spirits like frogs coming
[8:54] out as I said now naturally it comes
[8:56] from Rome
[8:57] natural wrong right over into Apple
[9:01] wrong
[9:03] all right then we're into the things and
[9:06] we'll get a little bit more than Lord
[9:07] willing the next message into the the
[9:09] old mother and the Harlot
[9:10] daughters and see the denominational
[9:12] situations and and life and seeing that
[9:15] trinitarian concept coming over that
[9:18] started at nicaea you know and develop
[9:21] into the Trinity Doctrine in the
[9:25] Christian realm you know of as we would
[9:28] call it coming down into the realm but
[9:30] then the prophet said after the opening
[9:34] of the seals that it would come out that
[9:37] they would be that part of a new Trinity
[9:39] in the end time amen that's right all
[9:40] right and I I made a lot of emphasis and
[9:43] a lot of things our Sunday about you
[9:46] know that the people of this message are
[9:49] the ones to me that the they're the
[9:51] three unclean spirits like frogs that
[9:53] are teaching contrary to the prophet's
[9:55] message Amen in all forms and ways and
[9:59] and coming after that and I want to
[10:01] apologize for making that statement that
[10:04] you know it was brought to my attention
[10:06] that wasn't too nice when I said if
[10:08] somebody tried to convert me to the
[10:10] basis of of believing that brother
[10:12] Branham was deity then I'd spit in his
[10:14] face and walk away well I just wouldn't
[10:16] spit this but it's okay with you take
[10:18] that away
[10:19] and just take that stiff and face that
[10:21] didn't sound too good just emphasizing
[10:23] the point of how much I'm against that
[10:26] right
[10:27] right good word that you know and I told
[10:29] the man we were up in Jeffersonville and
[10:31] we were talking and standing there and
[10:33] the man was a deity believer and I said
[10:36] now and I pointed to another man I said
[10:38] if you believe he's got the baptism of
[10:40] the Holy Ghost
[10:41] and
[10:42] Brown had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[10:44] and not dealing with the gifts and the
[10:46] signs and the things that within the
[10:48] prophet's Ministry but I said if you'll
[10:50] say that Holy Ghost in him is deity
[10:52] right because run around and said those
[10:53] things
[10:55] and I said if you'll say that's deity
[10:57] then I'll go along with you with deity
[10:59] and brother Brown he said oh no oh no
[11:02] we'll see that you know you can
[11:04] understand that those things are not
[11:07] right but just put that down to my
[11:09] ignorance of of uh what how was it
[11:13] Ronald Reagan got by with it he just
[11:15] didn't remember
[11:17] maybe 72 I get to where I just can't
[11:19] remember now I was trying to emphasize
[11:23] it so hard when I used the wrong words
[11:25] I shouldn't have said I'd spit in his
[11:27] face I said I should have said I just
[11:29] turned walk away right all right but
[11:31] let's go on because I believe that amen
[11:34] I believe that out of the message of the
[11:37] hour
[11:38] that after the seals broke
[11:40] then you didn't see any of the doctrines
[11:43] you know you saw a few little things
[11:46] taking place while the prophet was here
[11:48] but once he left the scene then you
[11:51] struck our day really because coming
[11:54] along and during the in 66 and hearing
[11:57] of the message and hearing of all of the
[11:59] things that was going on then and they
[12:01] was trying to figure out then well who's
[12:03] to lead the bride who's to be the Elijah
[12:06] who's to be the the uh the uh Joshua to
[12:10] take us through and you know and I tried
[12:13] to tell them in I said well my
[12:14] understanding was that run around come
[12:16] to introduce the great one yep amen and
[12:19] that was the Lord Jesus Christ I mean
[12:21] that's that's what I believe you know
[12:23] and I don't think there's no greater it
[12:26] could be introduced and I don't think
[12:28] the human mortal other than Jesus Christ
[12:31] that you could have anything greater
[12:33] than brother random's Ministry and his
[12:35] life and his dealings with the things to
[12:37] bring us to work but he said after so
[12:41] you come down to the mouth of someone
[12:42] it's the same old Doctrine
[12:45] you just moved from natural Rome the
[12:48] Pagan many gods
[12:51] well brought around said like he said
[12:53] when they come on over and he said then
[12:56] they couldn't go on with just you know
[12:58] with with one God so they had to start
[13:00] changing it and then made it into a
[13:03] pre-god theory you know or God injury
[13:06] person's Theory right and and bringing
[13:08] that in and it developed that nicaea
[13:11] when they begin to come along at 606 you
[13:15] see it really becoming prevalent you
[13:17] know and and all like that and and then
[13:20] you know going through and bringing into
[13:22] the Trinity Doctrine but then you see
[13:25] after the message broke go ahead and
[13:28] pull that one up brother uh Anderson 240
[13:31] paragraph 244 of the anointed ones you
[13:34] remember there Sunday we were bringing
[13:36] out that brought around says that there
[13:37] was three unclean spirits like frogs
[13:39] come out of the mouth you said gay
[13:41] paragraph 241 said gave birth to a new
[13:44] Trinity from their mother and the things
[13:46] and to be after the seals would come
[13:50] forth and this is what he said he
[13:52] started work it's false prophet singular
[13:55] see there twice
[13:57] it's the the what the three unclean
[14:00] spirits like frogs what it now the
[14:02] dragon Rome the Beast is the power or
[14:05] whatever coming and then it develops
[14:07] into the pope that's why it's the first
[14:09] this is this is false prophet singular
[14:13] false prophet the first pope and from
[14:16] dark came out and the and the
[14:17] mother of harness the whole thing a
[14:19] false Trinity was Rising not in the
[14:22] early days wouldn't be made manifest in
[14:25] the early days it went right on through
[14:27] with it
[14:28] see it went right on through with it it
[14:30] was dark but when the Seven Seals become
[14:33] and opened those Mysteries and reveal
[14:36] them that's when the frogs three unclean
[14:38] spirits like frogs come out to manifest
[14:41] themselves Trinity Doctrine against the
[14:45] right truth right
[14:48] so then it come out to be in this
[14:50] message is where you've got the Trinity
[14:52] Doctrine to coming out to face the truth
[14:54] because we believe the message was the
[14:56] truth right man see this this message is
[14:59] the truth so then when you come out like
[15:02] that it comes out of the mouth of
[15:03] someone someone has to teach it
[15:06] you know so I'd have to teach a doctor
[15:08] that's right oh you know you can have
[15:11] ideas or whatever but someone must teach
[15:13] that and bring it into a Doctrine and
[15:17] that's why you got stages it's come down
[15:19] you like you you've got the Deeds of the
[15:21] Nicolaitans then you got the doctrines
[15:24] and Nickelodeons and then it becomes a
[15:26] law it becomes this out or the other and
[15:28] it's the same old Trinity
[15:31] just brought up a little higher into the
[15:34] message people and I'm sorry about that
[15:37] I'm not I I love the brothers and the
[15:40] people but I thank God
[15:44] for the truth amen I thank God that he's
[15:47] opened my eyes to see things to worry
[15:50] that I can look and see those things and
[15:53] not throw it off on nobody they're
[15:55] wonderful wonderful brothers and the
[15:58] difference between you
[16:01] and I
[16:03] and the others out there it's one time
[16:06] God chose to reveal his word right you
[16:09] better thank God for that every day of
[16:10] your life amen then I chose to reveal
[16:13] himself to you that's right man that
[16:15] don't exalt us into a great big state it
[16:19] humbles us down to realize that what we
[16:21] get the Bible said somebody gave it to
[16:25] you right you say I studied this out
[16:27] while the Holy Ghost gave it to you amen
[16:29] the prophet had already bought it
[16:31] somebody put it in book form and done
[16:32] this out of the other you know and gave
[16:34] it to us but thank God for the truth
[16:36] right all right it comes out of the
[16:38] mouth of someone and as it's coming out
[16:40] of the mouth of someone it's a doctrine
[16:43] that people teach you all right and see
[16:46] then you can see all of these doctrines
[16:47] you know two Souls seven Thunder virtues
[16:49] and all of that
[16:52] um you know two Lords uh River Jordan
[16:55] doctrines no Holy Ghost doctrines all
[16:57] kind of things come out against the
[16:59] truth
[17:00] but they didn't dare stick up their head
[17:02] until the prophet left to say yeah right
[17:06] now here's what the prophet of God said
[17:08] one day and I thank God for it he said I
[17:12] believe it's in the church age book of
[17:13] 99 sure I'll find it he said I'm wanting
[17:16] to wait for a time to people to do like
[17:19] they did and turn around and say you are
[17:22] not saying what Paul said amen right
[17:25] right and look people straighten the eye
[17:27] and say you're not saying what brought
[17:29] around talked right okay
[17:31] and you'll see you become very unpopular
[17:34] you know because you're you're standing
[17:36] for the truth well thank God that there
[17:38] is a little bride that will stand for
[17:40] the truth
[17:41] all right
[17:42] but see in her then we'll be revealed
[17:44] and made known the real true secrets of
[17:47] of life and all and you know and take us
[17:50] even into a change
[17:53] but now watch this in a minute because
[17:55] we're going to get on to the natural
[17:56] form of what is known as Armageddon a
[18:00] great battle that the Bible we read of
[18:02] here this to come in the end time
[18:05] and we notice bringing out Sunday that
[18:09] verse 13 through 16 is a breach placed
[18:13] in you know
[18:15] and what it's doing is like we covered
[18:18] in the seals that there's a breach that
[18:21] you know in the church ages there was a
[18:23] breach see then something is made known
[18:26] dire and that Bridges you across
[18:30] all right now I told you that I'd choose
[18:33] to go through the vows and plagues of
[18:36] these things here of chapter 16 I didn't
[18:39] choose to do that because it is already
[18:42] covered in the opening of the CEOs in
[18:45] the tribulation period and the things
[18:47] like that it's already covered so I
[18:49] didn't choose to go through but I want
[18:52] to emphasize one thing to you that will
[18:54] read it and look at it you read down
[18:57] through chapter 16 and you get up to
[18:59] your sixth vow
[19:02] you know the plague and when you do it
[19:05] in it you see that great things are the
[19:07] the kings of the north that would dry up
[19:09] and brother Brown said Euphrates
[19:13] is where they would need to come down
[19:15] through from a lot of these things of
[19:17] looking at today and he said God will
[19:20] dry that up
[19:21] to where the kings of the North and the
[19:24] things can come down through
[19:27] Euphrates comes but I don't think he's
[19:30] talking about just drying it up because
[19:32] that would we don't worry about that
[19:35] anymore we just get to the water we go
[19:37] across it I think his emphasis is the
[19:40] point that he was making above her when
[19:42] he said that Euphrates runs out of Eden
[19:45] yes right all right
[19:48] but another statement he made if you
[19:50] want me to give it to you I'll be glad
[19:52] to pull it up he said and the same
[19:55] Euphrates runs through Babylon
[19:58] I don't think he's emphasizing the
[20:00] driving up I don't think the Bible is
[20:02] emphasizing the drying up of of the
[20:05] water you might have had to have done
[20:06] that in the days when you needed to come
[20:08] across the horses and chariots
[20:10] and that's basically the riding back
[20:12] there but we're in a day when we don't
[20:14] have to worry about it we can fly over
[20:16] and everything else but I think the
[20:18] point he's trying to make is that that
[20:21] River comes out of eat out right
[20:23] straight out of Eden right
[20:26] and then it'll come right straight down
[20:28] and it comes to Babylon right so that
[20:31] would put the two you know the beginning
[20:32] of the truth of it the good and the
[20:34] Babylon that will get into mystery
[20:37] Babylon Lord willing in the next message
[20:39] I think that's more what he's
[20:41] emphasizing for us to do but see this
[20:44] new Trinity
[20:47] is going to lead the people
[20:50] to the battle of Armageddon right now
[20:52] I'll read that to you in a minute
[20:55] this new Trinity that's going to lead
[20:57] the
[20:59] and you you can call then the new
[21:01] Trinity as I said
[21:02] here's old religion here's new Trinity
[21:05] come out from the old Rome into
[21:09] the Catholic Church comes over into
[21:11] protestantism to be a new Trinity
[21:14] but then come on over in our day to be a
[21:16] new Trinity come out after the opening
[21:18] of the seal but wherever you place it
[21:20] we'll read the quote in a minute where
[21:22] the Prophet says that new Trinity is
[21:24] going to set to people
[21:27] your Armageddon yep
[21:29] now that's the emphasis I want us to
[21:31] make tonight for us to look at because I
[21:35] mentioned it Sunday and I preached on
[21:36] this many times before but to those that
[21:39] haven't heard it
[21:40] we will get down to it in a minute in a
[21:42] reading because
[21:45] when I first read it he would be talking
[21:48] about
[21:49] you know Armageddon okay
[21:52] and and I thought he was going to tell
[21:54] us about how these Russians was going to
[21:57] come down and he said they will right
[22:02] in the Dead Sea alone when we were over
[22:04] there in Israel the Dead Sea alone
[22:07] contains trillions or trillions of
[22:10] dollars of untapped minerals
[22:13] and resources for the resident to come
[22:16] down through there for the uranium I was
[22:19] looking at that a moment ago and see
[22:21] coming down we know they're going to
[22:22] come down there for oh right
[22:24] right you know that's the main thing
[22:25] today is the oil to get it because right
[22:29] in that area is where all the oil that
[22:30] if you go back and read a little bit of
[22:33] your natural newspapers you'll find out
[22:35] that the battle in Kuwait
[22:37] was to secure that area right now I read
[22:41] this out of the newspaper worded even
[22:42] for 50 years they'd have a right to run
[22:44] a pipeline across there right and that
[22:46] was what the whole war was about see we
[22:49] think it's about this that or the other
[22:51] now it would just you know it was that
[22:53] point to get that area to where we could
[22:56] have our hand holds our what do you
[22:58] think Russia is doing
[23:00] the Bible says when you see Jerusalem
[23:02] compassion about on all sides
[23:04] yep but around said the East and the
[23:07] West is gathering together reading these
[23:10] today thinking I I would just quote them
[23:13] but bringing the East and the West
[23:15] together
[23:16] well to circle around Jerusalem right
[23:19] and you look at it
[23:21] Russia Here China here we're here who's
[23:24] over here what's known all coming in the
[23:26] end time
[23:27] the one right around and brought it down
[23:29] to the fourth seal talking of Armageddon
[23:33] he never named those Nations like that
[23:36] he showed us where the forces would be
[23:38] coming from that's right
[23:40] because remember the Trinity is what's
[23:43] going to sit right we'll read that in a
[23:46] minute where he said the Trinity is
[23:48] going to set Armageddon into being
[23:51] in other words that's the thing that's
[23:53] going to draw
[23:55] down to make it come to be called
[23:58] Armageddon
[24:00] where it can be that Basin all right now
[24:02] so let's start and just get some natural
[24:05] things but I want you to take that now
[24:07] and think about it he doesn't cover
[24:11] Russia and China and the United States
[24:13] that will take place we know that right
[24:17] that will transpire because you've got
[24:20] to have those but like I said World War
[24:22] one they had on their Buckles in God we
[24:25] trust on both sides you know
[24:29] see we don't want to think about battles
[24:32] but what about the the great civil war
[24:34] here in America when brother was
[24:36] fighting brother
[24:39] right you said but brother damn that
[24:41] wasn't over a religious matter huh
[24:44] I would beg your pardon
[24:48] all balance has been fought over a
[24:50] religious manners right you might not
[24:52] want to call them religious
[24:55] you know yeah
[24:56] yeah but it's all been religious matters
[24:58] it's somebody's idea contrary to
[25:01] somebody else's idea right right and
[25:04] that brings all of the battles but let's
[25:06] just read a little bit
[25:07] and just with that emphasis
[25:10] in mind and then just think about what
[25:13] he's saying let's go to number one
[25:14] brother
[25:16] Anderson
[25:18] let's see what the prophet of God has to
[25:19] say I love this quote because of of the
[25:22] layout of the way it comes down this is
[25:25] uh questions and answers uh real four or
[25:28] part four
[25:29] 1964 8 30 in the evening paragraph 75.
[25:35] you talk about the ending the broadest
[25:37] call we're already entered into that's
[25:39] what they were saying
[25:41] they were saying the church age ending
[25:43] blacked out see thinking when the seals
[25:46] broke everything was over with and
[25:48] everything but that was their question
[25:50] we have already entered into the
[25:51] tribulation period that's why they were
[25:54] thinking he said no no no you're I wish
[25:56] that I could just have more time on that
[25:59] see
[26:00] the bride when she's taken from the
[26:02] church then the church eggs will cease
[26:05] the people in the message today and I'll
[26:08] go a long way up to a degree of a point
[26:10] but a lot of people are saying the
[26:12] seventh Church age has already ended
[26:14] when I it can't end
[26:18] until we get out of here
[26:21] I mean we're calling caught out of the
[26:23] age
[26:24] but the age still goes right on over and
[26:27] it actually goes if you connect it let's
[26:29] see what church eggs will go right over
[26:31] and connect against with the the
[26:33] tribulation and over to the Jews
[26:37] but you see that's what people will take
[26:39] their own ideas of a thought he said but
[26:41] when the bride is taken then the church
[26:42] age receipts letting you see it goes
[26:45] into chaos the bride goes to glory now
[26:47] look at the order one two three four me
[26:50] yep and the tribulation period sets in
[26:52] upon sleeping a sleeping virgin
[26:55] for three and a half years while Israel
[26:57] is getting its prophecy then tribulation
[27:00] sets in upon Israel
[27:02] and then comes the battle of Armageddon
[27:05] which destroys all things then the bride
[27:08] returns back with the groom for a
[27:10] thousand years I love the order of that
[27:11] thing look the millennial Reign after
[27:14] that comes to watch on judgment after
[27:16] that comes the new heavens and the new
[27:17] Earth and the new city coming down one
[27:20] after the other if you ever want to do
[27:22] that just write that down and if you
[27:24] want to know the order of events okay
[27:26] just read them yep the prophet is giving
[27:30] it to you let's see showing where
[27:33] Armageddon will take place
[27:36] Israel will be getting good prophecy
[27:39] then the tribulation was set in upon
[27:42] Israel
[27:43] of course everybody don't believe that
[27:45] Daniel 70 weeks message but that's all
[27:48] right see the battle of Armageddon will
[27:51] come
[27:52] now the battle of Armageddon will be a a
[27:54] decisive battle and it's also
[27:57] um it's called in what is it megadon or
[28:01] something is the other name for it you
[28:03] can look it up in your Hebrew idea but
[28:05] you know
[28:07] but just think about it
[28:09] what is going to take place
[28:13] the bride has already gone in the
[28:15] rapture
[28:17] so she will have nothing to do the
[28:19] tribulation sets in
[28:21] all things has nothing to do with the
[28:24] literal Armageddon
[28:26] so that will be the the termination of
[28:29] forces with Israel all right now let's
[28:32] go and read a little bit more with this
[28:33] read a whole bunch and then we'll back
[28:35] up and start our talk look at the next
[28:37] one Victory Day preached in 1963 a 421
[28:41] paragraph 127.
[28:43] we talked about it we've had several
[28:46] Wars wars and rumors of wars and d-days
[28:48] and V days and V days and he'll finally
[28:50] wind up into the great battle of
[28:52] Armageddon that'll be the life of it
[28:54] when she comes to the battle of
[28:56] Armageddon that'll settle the whole
[28:58] thing just before when now when does
[29:01] Army get in take place just before the
[29:04] great millennium
[29:06] Armageddon is to clean off the Earth
[29:09] so you re-purifies yourself with this
[29:12] Atomic blowing and the volcanic action
[29:15] the thing sinks this soaked blood of men
[29:18] and upon the Earth and sin and crime and
[29:20] seeing and all it'll come in in the
[29:23] earth cleanses the Earth for the great
[29:24] Millennium he cleanses his church
[29:27] burning bringing her to that before the
[29:29] great Millennium that's what Armageddon
[29:31] is going to do all right
[29:33] Armageddon is going to set a stage to
[29:37] where the Millennium could take place
[29:38] amen
[29:41] it will be a termination of forces
[29:45] it will be an end of Wars until you come
[29:48] down to goggin Magog
[29:51] and we'll read in a minute where the
[29:53] Prophet says Armageddon is but before
[29:55] the Millennium goggin Magog is after the
[30:00] Millennium there's two great battles in
[30:01] the Book of Revelation and two now let
[30:04] me back up what I said a minute ago when
[30:07] you insert this arm again
[30:10] you can come from the sixth vowel
[30:14] all right and when when you read your
[30:17] sixth vowel I'm gonna do my glasses
[30:22] there we go
[30:24] the six mile is the 12th verse of the
[30:27] 16th chapter and the sixth Angel Port is
[30:29] vile up on the Great River you break
[30:31] these in the word Arrow was dried up
[30:33] right let the way of the kings of the
[30:34] East might be prepared he says me so
[30:37] forgive me for saying North America all
[30:39] right because we've always said to Kings
[30:40] of Illinois you know but look see when
[30:44] you breach this end
[30:46] you showed it really Armageddon
[30:49] is going to be the breached cross
[30:52] if you're reading in your Bible to look
[30:54] at it in verse 17 and the seventh angel
[30:57] poured out Israel into the Earth and
[31:00] there came a great voice out of the
[31:01] Temple of Heaven from the throne saying
[31:03] it is done and there were voices and
[31:06] Thunders and Lightnings and there was a
[31:09] great earthquake
[31:11] and watch
[31:13] ending the tribulation right such as was
[31:16] not since men were upon the Earth's
[31:18] Almighty and earthquake was so great
[31:21] then you're going down to where there'll
[31:24] be Stone's nail falling away as much as
[31:26] 200 pounds but what I'm saying is
[31:29] Armageddon shows you
[31:32] what will will bring about this ending
[31:36] up of all things naturally
[31:39] of the battles and then God shows you
[31:43] what he's going to do right he'll come
[31:46] down and fight for Israel right
[31:49] it'll be natural battles and natural
[31:51] bombs falling
[31:52] to end this whole thing up and that'll
[31:55] be Armageddon but see then God's going
[31:57] to bring
[31:59] a great earthquake to end the whole
[32:01] thing says greater than any of them has
[32:02] ever been
[32:03] but see that's that's where we look at
[32:05] it and we see what's going on all right
[32:07] now go ahead with number three
[32:13] set the mark of the beast and seal of
[32:14] God number two 61 to 17 paragraph
[32:19] e42 notice the very next verse
[32:23] the 12th and 13th verse
[32:26] blessed are the dead that die in the
[32:28] Lord what's the next
[32:31] Armageddon
[32:33] blessed are they that die in the Lord
[32:35] Armageddon church is gone then after
[32:38] this third Angel's message all right go
[32:41] to the next
[32:43] look just tiny in that scripture about
[32:46] the blessing or they that die in the
[32:48] Lord
[32:50] this is paragraph 83 of the 70th week of
[32:53] Daniel 61 806
[32:56] paragraph 83 them prophets will prophesy
[32:59] 120 three score days which is in the
[33:02] midst of the last week of the Jews then
[33:05] they're cut off
[33:06] and the Armageddon sets in has nothing
[33:10] to do with us
[33:13] right nothing to do whatsoever with the
[33:16] bride because she's gone into glory in
[33:17] the Rapture amen but it will be to
[33:20] Israel and it'll be in the tribulation
[33:23] and they come to that place
[33:26] and the prophet said they prophesy and
[33:29] in the midst of the last week of the
[33:30] Jews
[33:31] then what's going to happen Armageddon
[33:34] forgive me
[33:38] paragraph 215 of the same message
[33:42] Daniel
[33:44] and watch these two or three prophets or
[33:46] two prophets when they raise up here and
[33:48] in the middle of the week they're cut
[33:49] off I'm doing this just to place
[33:53] to where someone out there especially
[33:55] looking into hasn't read these things to
[33:58] place the order of Armageddon
[34:01] it is not after the right to rapture
[34:05] it is at the end of the tribulation
[34:07] period right
[34:09] right
[34:10] real happy years is all the tribulation
[34:12] there is to Israel amen
[34:15] excuse me
[34:18] when they rise up here and in the middle
[34:19] of the week they're cut off like that
[34:22] then starts the battle of Armageddon did
[34:25] God begin to speak himself
[34:27] there he stands and begins to fight
[34:32] that profits are striking the Earth
[34:34] they're preaching the name of Jesus
[34:35] Christ watching they're baptized in the
[34:38] same way you remember the other day I
[34:40] was talking about what message they were
[34:41] going to get when we leave out here
[34:42] being this message all right they're
[34:43] going to baptize them in the name of the
[34:45] Lord Jesus Christ
[34:47] they're not going baptize and fall
[34:48] asleep
[34:51] they're doing the same thing that the
[34:52] first man across the fathers did and
[34:55] many are following them but who but that
[34:58] who's confederated that organization
[35:01] moved right on down and watch you
[35:03] picking up the organized religion now
[35:04] the power of those prophets didn't break
[35:07] it it doesn't break that power
[35:11] oh the old mother do those two
[35:14] Prophets they're they're going to be so
[35:16] powerful it's going to take the
[35:18] Israelites and make them kill their own
[35:20] people 144 000 to do with him
[35:23] they said we'll make it all an
[35:26] organization and he brings in what is it
[35:28] the Abomination romanism to overstret
[35:31] the spread the whole thing that makes a
[35:33] desolation and it takes everything into
[35:36] it all right placing the order of timing
[35:40] of what it's to be of Armageddon then
[35:44] we'll see
[35:46] and read in a minute let this the
[35:47] prophet just read we'll read what he
[35:50] says about the battle of Armageddon
[35:52] right but just placing it together to
[35:54] see this is taken from from thy house
[35:57] reached in Tifton Georgia 1961-808
[36:01] paragraph 74. here's what I think it'd
[36:04] be
[36:05] now he's back up here explaining you
[36:07] know coming down and and the communism
[36:09] uh winds up and he told us you know
[36:13] don't fear communism but it is three
[36:15] Spirits just like communism fascism read
[36:18] another one in a minute where he names
[36:19] them calling it fascism
[36:22] communism
[36:26] one jump in Catholicism
[36:29] right now I want you to Anchor that one
[36:31] good
[36:32] because he said those three
[36:35] see
[36:36] you stop at saying audience in communism
[36:38] but remember communism is gone
[36:42] so you don't lost your point
[36:44] now Russia's not gone
[36:46] communism is gone right
[36:49] it's all those three are going to wind
[36:51] up in
[36:55] Catholicism we'll get down to that in a
[36:58] minute so here here's what I think it'd
[37:00] be I believe it's the spirit the
[37:02] sleeping virgin Confederation Church
[37:04] Judaism only rejection of Christ the
[37:06] Jews is rejected and Catholicism because
[37:09] you see where it comes out of and it
[37:11] come out of the false prophecy out of
[37:14] the mouth of the false prophet which was
[37:15] potpourri from out of the Beast see and
[37:19] all that were it come out of you can see
[37:23] the back background where you know where
[37:25] it is and that's the three unclean
[37:28] spirits that sets the whole world
[37:31] to Armageddon
[37:35] now he doesn't bring Natural Forces
[37:38] right he's not talking about Russia
[37:40] Wants to Rule the World
[37:43] he's talking about those three unclean
[37:46] spirits
[37:48] like frogs is going to lead the entire
[37:52] world
[37:55] to the battle of Armageddon right amen
[37:57] that's what I want you to see I'm
[37:59] wanting us to get away from the fact of
[38:00] even thinking about well boy communism
[38:03] is this and this Islam is that communism
[38:05] is gone
[38:06] Russia's not gone no right but communism
[38:10] is gone where did it go
[38:15] but eventually that goes into
[38:16] Catholicism
[38:18] you say no Russia is not Catholic
[38:27] they have a lot of religious people in
[38:29] Russia
[38:31] there's people in this message in Russia
[38:33] bringing the truth to them nurse imagine
[38:36] this Baptist Presbyterian all kind of
[38:38] churches and
[38:40] in China they have them I think I'm
[38:42] writing a quote won't quote them but
[38:44] they call it the three self church or
[38:46] something like that yeah in other words
[38:48] it's the one recognized by the
[38:49] government but it's massive this this
[38:51] Baptist it's Presbyterian it's
[38:52] Pentecostal this but they just put them
[38:54] under one
[38:56] my point is when you see it really see
[38:59] the battle of Armageddon you're going to
[39:01] get away from bombs and airplanes and
[39:03] things happening and you're going to see
[39:05] it setting right now in order that's my
[39:09] whole point setting an order because you
[39:10] know where it's setting in your mind and
[39:12] my mind
[39:14] that's right that's why I tried my best
[39:16] to bring our Sunday a little bit in
[39:18] advance to talk about the spiritual
[39:20] battle of Armageddon that's going on now
[39:22] and me and you right
[39:25] where they're trying to pull us into
[39:27] denominationalism
[39:29] you wouldn't surprise me none whatsoever
[39:31] if some of them had already applied to
[39:33] the World Council of churches to try to
[39:35] get membership in with this message this
[39:37] message is growing by lips and brown
[39:39] boundless millions and millions now
[39:41] right
[39:43] right in this message
[39:46] especially in the foreign field right
[39:52] right see you've got this thing going a
[39:56] few more years we're going to be listed
[39:57] as one of the as big as a lot of the
[39:59] denominational churches are
[40:05] I didn't say that all right I said if
[40:09] this thing goes on the way it's going
[40:12] thank God there'll be a Bride come out
[40:14] of it amen because we got to come out of
[40:17] the church right amen amen that's right
[40:19] amen
[40:20] come on there's a church but there's a
[40:22] bride called out of a church right
[40:25] now
[40:26] amen all right so where are we at
[40:30] look what he says on the next one now
[40:33] they're just placing the arm again
[40:36] ask him this question or question
[40:38] answered on the seal 63 324 in the
[40:41] morning service paragraph 341
[40:43] would you please explain how Satan has
[40:45] bound a thousand years being loosed
[40:47] again for the Battle of Revelations 20
[40:49] and 8 Revelation 20 and 8 is Gog and
[40:52] Magog
[40:56] all right
[40:58] watch it this is not the battle of
[41:00] Armageddon Revelation 28 and the eight
[41:05] that's
[41:06] that's not the battle of Armageddon
[41:08] that's what he's explaining
[41:10] the battle of Armageddon takes place on
[41:12] this side before the millennium we all
[41:15] right at the wind the tribulation period
[41:18] is ended
[41:19] you know what relation does it with the
[41:21] Battle of dog and mega none one is this
[41:24] thousand years on this side of another
[41:26] word the other one is is the end of the
[41:29] end of the Thousand Years in other words
[41:31] after the Thousand Years
[41:33] okay
[41:34] you got Armageddon coming first and then
[41:37] you got Gog and Magog we'll get to that
[41:38] as we get on over further in the The
[41:40] Book of Revelation but placing it in
[41:43] order to where you won't misunderstand
[41:45] it
[41:46] watch what he says about now how this
[41:48] will talk start taking place go ahead
[41:50] with number nine because I left out
[41:53] eight okay
[41:54] that's my fault nope
[41:57] we had this already worked out Sunday
[42:00] because that's with my note Sunday
[42:02] this is taken from the United common
[42:04] sign 63 818 paragraph 89 it'll go on
[42:08] down into the 91.
[42:11] because they're right now uniting
[42:15] you said brother Brown was that true
[42:19] they're coming to the battle of
[42:20] Armageddon
[42:22] exactly what they will do see
[42:25] and they're uniting for that right now
[42:29] that's why we got the U.N
[42:31] and everything we have
[42:33] the Western worlds uniting against the
[42:36] Eastern World communism and so forth
[42:38] It's all uniting together the churches
[42:41] are uniting together everything's being
[42:43] united united themselves together go
[42:46] ahead and pull them up
[42:47] the paragraph 91. God is uniting his
[42:50] bride she is coming together for the
[42:51] East and the west and North and the
[42:52] South there's a uniting time and that's
[42:54] on right now what is she uniting for now
[42:58] these others who you're not needing to
[42:59] go to Armageddon right she's uniting for
[43:02] the what the Rapture amen God's getting
[43:05] her ready yes sir uniting what is she
[43:08] uniting with with the word for all the
[43:10] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[43:11] work shall never pass away she's unite
[43:14] herself with thus said the Lord
[43:15] regardless of what any denomination or
[43:17] anybody else said she's uniting herself
[43:20] see that's going on right if we can see
[43:23] these others going on why can't we see
[43:25] what's going on in you and I right
[43:27] that's the point of reading is she's
[43:29] getting ready why she is the bride
[43:30] that's right and she's uniting herself
[43:32] with her bridegroom see and the
[43:34] bridegroom is a word in the beginning
[43:36] was the word word with God and the Word
[43:37] was made flesh and dwell among us all
[43:39] right

[43:43] if we can see a natural thing
[43:45] transpiring why can't we see what's
[43:47] taking place tonight all right amen amen
[43:50] well why can't we see the greatest
[43:52] battle ever fought being fought right
[43:53] now
[43:54] right here in our brain
[43:57] you see the people of this message
[43:59] trying to enroll with every kind of
[44:00] doctor it could be thought of
[44:02] that's right
[44:04] there's no new doctrine to everyone come
[44:06] out of Genesis that's what you're
[44:08] talking about
[44:11] just like we've showed you that the one
[44:13] where they're talking about now that
[44:14] Jesus wouldn't go out to the River
[44:15] Jordan that's identically what they were
[44:17] arguing at the First National Council
[44:19] whether Jesus was God or Alexa that's
[44:22] right
[44:25] you see we're we're battling this we're
[44:27] uniting to the word is correcting our
[44:30] era right
[44:31] amen right all right but that Trinity of
[44:35] unclean spirits that's trying to bombard
[44:38] us to get us to go is also inflicting in
[44:42] every nation in the world
[44:44] right right sure to bring the world to
[44:47] Armageddon amen we're not going to beat
[44:50] our arm again we're going to go up in
[44:51] the Rapture amen at least a three and a
[44:53] half year period before Armageddon takes
[44:56] place
[44:57] but see the battle is going on now
[44:59] that's what he said to you and that's
[45:01] what they're doing you should know that
[45:03] you you energy to try to stop Wars we're
[45:05] never stop one
[45:09] right
[45:11] I'm not against it I love America man
[45:15] but where if you ain't ever stopped the
[45:17] war
[45:21] and why is it when they want to do it
[45:23] we're always number one at goals right
[45:25] right
[45:27] amen so it shows that we're the
[45:31] as we were saying here a while back what
[45:33] we are the image to the Beast right amen
[45:35] we are the ones with enough military
[45:37] power to control the world because we
[45:40] got the bombs we got the planes we got
[45:42] everything ready all right but now
[45:44] what's it doing she's uniting
[45:47] and what's this next one
[45:52] Mr Nick which is ashamed 1965 711
[45:55] paragraph 2 23 224.
[46:00] and the spirit is not only in America
[46:05] he's talking about these
[46:08] three unclean spirits he's talking about
[46:09] all of the things that's happening how
[46:11] the world is falling down with the Rick
[46:13] Ricky's and the ricketters and the all
[46:16] of the things
[46:19] and the spirit is not only in America
[46:22] it has spread itself out over the world
[46:25] to bring them to the battle of
[46:27] Armageddon
[46:29] they act like that whether they are or
[46:31] not
[46:32] all the whole world
[46:35] and you know what the biggest portion of
[46:38] the world the reason they act like that
[46:40] is because we went in there and took
[46:42] into their nation and their country
[46:45] our thoughts and our ideas
[46:48] and we converted them
[46:51] and we freedom
[46:56] yeah
[46:58] we put the women in The Honky Tonks and
[47:00] the beer joints and
[47:03] yeah right line them up with a man made
[47:06] them equal
[47:10] right right
[47:12] I mean am I saying anything is wrong no
[47:15] and we're trying to convert the world of
[47:17] what
[47:20] so there must be something in the back
[47:22] of us more than just us because we don't
[47:25] want that
[47:29] so it must be that
[47:31] Reagan and the pope got together and
[47:34] destroyed communism
[47:37] that's what paper said
[47:40] the music the night the magazines here
[47:43] right
[47:45] well we kept running the arms race up we
[47:47] kept even falsifying it when we didn't
[47:49] even have the things right so that
[47:52] Russia would keep building and building
[47:53] when they did they demanded payment
[47:56] if they had a demanded payment that day
[47:58] of us we ain't broke too right amount
[48:00] the reason they didn't demand is because
[48:02] we are the one with the mark of the
[48:04] beast right all right
[48:06] but you see what I'm talking about
[48:10] together them together now bypass number
[48:13] 11 because we've done registration
[48:14] Revelation 16 16 and he gathered them
[48:17] together into a place called in the
[48:19] Hebrew tongue Armageddon now let's just
[48:22] take this a little bit and let run
[48:23] around them
[48:24] just do this jump over to number 12.
[48:27] let's go into the fourth seal and just
[48:29] read
[48:30] and then you just make up your mind
[48:32] about it yourself
[48:33] as we let him say to us this time
[48:37] this is paragraph 26 278 of the four
[48:41] seal 63 321
[48:43] and what is this all coming to
[48:46] now we just got about 12 14 minutes here
[48:49] I guess
[48:50] look
[48:52] what is this all coming to what is it
[48:55] it's going right back the way it did it
[48:58] started in heaven
[49:00] it's coming to the end time
[49:03] battle
[49:04] the first thing in heaven was about
[49:06] Lucifer was kicked out and come to the
[49:09] Earth
[49:10] and any polluted Eden then he's been
[49:12] polluting ever since
[49:14] and now from the battle in heaven is
[49:16] coming down to the battle on Earth it
[49:18] needs to be finished
[49:20] on Earth at the end time in a battle
[49:22] called Armageddon everyone knows that
[49:25] the battle started in heaven holy and so
[49:28] they kicked him out Michael and his
[49:30] angels overthrowed them just run out and
[49:34] when they did drop right down and eaten
[49:36] and here started the battle down here
[49:39] right amen all right
[49:41] now what kind of a battle did it start
[49:44] it didn't start a communism
[49:47] and the catholicisms and I mean the
[49:50] communism and Nazism and all of those
[49:53] were this Humanity coming down Nations
[49:56] developing
[49:59] where was the first Babylon
[50:02] in heaven right where was the next
[50:05] battle at in the mind of Eve
[50:09] right right
[50:12] in the mind of Eve and you know it's odd
[50:16] isn't it that we lay so much emphasis
[50:19] upon Armageddon being more into the
[50:22] spiritual mechanism of bringing together
[50:25] the the world to a Catholic Doctrine
[50:30] when you think about what happened in
[50:32] the garden
[50:37] went straight to the mind of Eve
[50:44] you'll be as God
[50:47] knowing Good and Evil
[50:50] you be able to talk to God because
[50:52] you'll have an understanding like him
[50:55] knowledge
[50:59] all wars has been thought over religious
[51:01] matters
[51:03] of one form or the other
[51:06] did I say it one country wants to take
[51:08] over another country because they want
[51:09] to Captivate them they want to
[51:12] get them under their
[51:15] domain and their gods right
[51:21] the Egyptians with many gods wanted to
[51:23] capture the Israelis and make them
[51:24] Egyptians right
[51:27] under their gods
[51:29] all battles in the world has fought over
[51:31] religion
[51:34] Cain and Abel started it out over
[51:36] religion right
[51:38] that's true yep amen
[51:41] fighting over a Doctrine
[51:47] don't worry about
[51:49] run around says don't you fear communism
[51:52] then he said Don't Fear Russia he said
[51:55] there's no place in the Bible that will
[51:57] ever show you that Russia will rule the
[51:59] world
[52:01] right
[52:04] now we know that in the Bible Russia
[52:07] will destroy
[52:10] because they're going to be part of the
[52:11] element of forces in the last days right
[52:13] right
[52:19] but that's not the main thing
[52:22] where did the battle start in the garden
[52:24] where did your Prophet say it's greatest
[52:25] battle ever followed what did he say
[52:28] he said it started in the garden in the
[52:30] mind of man
[52:37] and see what is it that you can
[52:39] have a religious matters
[52:42] and people of different countries both
[52:45] of them will be uh hedonistic
[52:47] governments
[52:51] but you have to go over and Conquer
[52:52] another government to try to convert
[52:53] them to their hedonistic ways
[52:58] and now come on folks I'm not backing up
[53:00] I'm going home
[53:02] America going to the world to try to
[53:04] convert the heater into the heat in
[53:06] America
[53:10] some of those rules and customs and logs
[53:13] that some of those countries has Beats
[53:15] us to death whether you like that kind
[53:17] of talking or not
[53:19] it does
[53:21] yep
[53:24] see we try to free countries to make a
[53:26] war we can give them religion what do we
[53:28] give them into this madness Presbyterian
[53:29] Pentecost
[53:30] I told you when I was in the Baptist
[53:32] Church I knew then
[53:34] the Baptist Association was sending
[53:36] money to incite rights and governments
[53:38] in foreign countries
[53:44] come on of course they couldn't get into
[53:46] that country
[53:48] we talk about the people of this message
[53:51] like that we've just barely got an
[53:52] inroad into China back what 10 years ago
[53:55] or something yeah
[53:58] yeah well you see the reason we got an
[53:59] inroad into China 10 years ago because
[54:01] the message that some Baptist doesn't
[54:02] eat us there probably 20 years ago or
[54:04] more than that right
[54:09] see it's setting up as I read to you a
[54:12] moment ago the prophet would say then
[54:13] that what these three unclean spirits
[54:15] like frogs going out of the mouth of
[54:17] someone a Doctrine is going to bring the
[54:20] whole world to Armageddon right
[54:28] now
[54:29] I want you to think a moment about this
[54:31] now just don't I'm trying to make
[54:33] something natural so listen
[54:35] sure the bombs will be from the U.S the
[54:38] bonds will be from Russia the bonds will
[54:40] be from China this will be from that
[54:41] this will be from that right all right
[54:43] we're still in the in the word and going
[54:45] down the line
[54:49] but what about all of us being
[54:52] religious
[54:55] Christian nations
[54:57] fighting against each other for what
[55:03] what is actually going to be what is
[55:05] your thoughts of Armageddon
[55:07] well one of these days the world is
[55:08] going to get mad somebody's going to
[55:10] push a button and they're just going to
[55:11] start doing that's always good but
[55:13] what's leading up to that how how do I
[55:15] get there other than just some drunk
[55:16] push a button
[55:18] you know
[55:19] I mean it's politude
[55:22] do you know that the president of the
[55:23] United States right now it keeps those
[55:26] ways before they consider a nuclear bomb
[55:28] anywhere they've got to have certain
[55:30] people get together and this has got a
[55:32] suitcase and that has got one and and
[55:34] all these things has got to be together
[55:35] to where they can get it to where they
[55:37] can push off one button
[55:39] because we know they know some drunk or
[55:41] get hold of the button
[55:46] they're doing everything to keep them
[55:48] from where they can set it off
[55:49] well you know naturally every country is
[55:52] going to be that way because they don't
[55:53] want their bonds or their own to go off
[55:56] so who is the battle of Armageddon
[55:57] fought against
[56:03] Earl going to be brought to a basis that
[56:06] we're actually going to be part of it
[56:12] I thought we believed that there would
[56:14] be a tribulation period
[56:16] and in that tribulation period everybody
[56:18] would have a mark of the Beast
[56:21] looking by ourselves without his Mark in
[56:24] their hand or their forehead
[56:26] and I thought we believe that Mark in
[56:28] the forehead was a Doctrine
[56:30] and the fact of the hand was the ability
[56:33] to work we can't work without it
[56:37] then who we fighting against
[56:44] now we're going to all be in one
[56:46] Covenant
[56:49] the Antichrist is going to have
[56:52] everybody in that one Covenant no matter
[56:56] what nation they're in they're going to
[56:58] be under it
[57:00] except for Israel right
[57:03] and the natural nation of Israel will
[57:07] also be in that Covenant
[57:10] I use the words the way I wanted it the
[57:12] natural nation of Israel amen it's only
[57:16] a hundred and forty four thousand and
[57:19] two witnesses
[57:21] that's right
[57:26] and they will be killed
[57:29] for their belief
[57:33] looks like the battle of Armageddon is
[57:36] defeated it looks like it's
[57:40] you see Israel one day will really
[57:41] realize
[57:45] what has went on
[57:48] when that Antichrist steps into that
[57:50] Temple and declares himself to be God
[57:54] then natural Israel will Rebel
[57:59] right nope
[58:02] that's when the bomb starts falling
[58:04] because it doesn't sitting all the way
[58:06] around her
[58:08] it won't be no wonderful little old USA
[58:11] that's fighting for Israel
[58:16] no that's right we will be
[58:21] we will be
[58:23] the destruction of Israel as well as the
[58:25] Arabs are today
[58:27] oh no no no you'll never never get us to
[58:29] do that
[58:30] mm-hmm
[58:33] well go ahead and believe what you won't
[58:34] do
[58:36] but try to have a little common sense
[58:38] sometimes right
[58:39] just plain Common Sense amen
[58:42] to think things over right if the whole
[58:45] world is going to be in an antichrist
[58:47] Covenant and there will be
[58:49] America and all then who's going to be
[58:52] fighting what
[58:57] during the tribulation those hundred
[58:59] forty four thousand and two innings will
[59:01] be able to call down plagues and all
[59:03] kinds of things right
[59:06] and even natural Israel will turn
[59:08] against her yep
[59:12] a new wife when they kill them
[59:16] but what do you think happens to Natural
[59:18] Israel about the time they begin to wake
[59:20] up because you know them two witnesses
[59:22] that 144 000 is going to be describing
[59:25] to Israel as a natural world on the
[59:28] internets and everything in the world
[59:29] they're going to be talking about just
[59:31] what I'm talking about tonight
[59:33] they're going to be talking and trying
[59:36] to tell Israel how they're in oh head
[59:39] over heels with an antichrist Covenant
[59:43] they don't blame them that's right no
[59:46] he's a wonderful guy
[59:47] oh look what he's done he's played all
[59:49] of our national debts
[59:51] yeah
[59:55] if I pay your debt brother Cauley oh you
[59:59] belong to me
[1:00:03] right
[1:00:06] yeah
[1:00:07] no we're in Freedom
[1:00:11] we'll tell the slaves that back in under
[1:00:13] a couple hundred years ago
[1:00:15] thank you
[1:00:17] but listen folks just trying to get a
[1:00:20] point across amen
[1:00:22] the point is the whole world is going to
[1:00:25] be in an antichrist Covenant
[1:00:28] for seven years he's going to make it
[1:00:30] that's right
[1:00:31] that's according to Book of Daniel all
[1:00:33] right amen
[1:00:34] he's going to make that Covenant just
[1:00:36] after us leaving here right
[1:00:39] and we just read a few quotes back there
[1:00:42] we're running around seeing Armageddon
[1:00:44] would be at the end of the tribulation
[1:00:45] but three and a half years through
[1:00:47] Israel all right
[1:00:49] right amen
[1:00:51] how do we leave it out of here there's
[1:00:52] three and a half years tribulation
[1:00:53] that's what your Prophet said
[1:00:57] but Satan makes his Covenant for one
[1:01:00] week why
[1:01:02] because he knows exactly what Jesus done
[1:01:05] he preached for one week
[1:01:08] three and a half years back there to
[1:01:11] declare himself to be God he preached
[1:01:13] three and a half years over here to
[1:01:15] declare himself to be God
[1:01:16] an will make his Covenant and see hey he
[1:01:19] done it in seven years and I'll do it in
[1:01:21] seven
[1:01:22] I'll make my Covenant card is odd isn't
[1:01:25] it that they make the Covenant for seven
[1:01:26] years right now
[1:01:28] but in the middle of that
[1:01:31] Israel will eventually win the 144 000
[1:01:35] are killed and they realize when that
[1:01:37] man walks in there and says he's God
[1:01:44] now now he's saying he's in God's stead
[1:01:48] all right right
[1:01:50] they're electing now a man to will
[1:01:53] declare that he is in God's stead all
[1:01:56] right
[1:01:58] all right
[1:02:02] but then when one day he comes up and
[1:02:04] steps up there and says I'm God
[1:02:06] yep
[1:02:07] yeah
[1:02:11] they're going to realize man ain't
[1:02:13] talking about instead of gonna guard
[1:02:15] somewhere else right they're going to
[1:02:16] realize he's leaving himself to be that
[1:02:18] and Israel is going to Rebel yeah and
[1:02:21] they got the Simpson effect that's what
[1:02:23] they say
[1:02:24] you know what Samson done he brought the
[1:02:26] temple down on himself
[1:02:28] Israel's always said they're not afraid
[1:02:30] of their enemies God they got their
[1:02:31] Sampson effect
[1:02:33] they can call down the bombs right on
[1:02:35] their own self and blow it to
[1:02:36] Smithereens you say they won't do it
[1:02:38] I'll remind you with about 900 of them
[1:02:41] went up on the Masada is that right
[1:02:43] we've got four up there
[1:02:46] and they refused
[1:02:48] to be captives anymore and they killed
[1:02:51] himself which was contrary to their own
[1:02:53] laws they said
[1:02:56] how about even I've just got through
[1:02:58] reading a book that sister truly let me
[1:03:00] read
[1:03:01] and he was bringing it all the way down
[1:03:02] through you remember he used to be what
[1:03:04] the prime minister of Israel or
[1:03:05] something he was some kind of a big
[1:03:07] official back there and he was one of
[1:03:09] them that was there when they signed the
[1:03:10] uh the fact of the Israel being coming
[1:03:13] to Nation you know in a different thing
[1:03:16] smoke was written in 56 I think
[1:03:18] but he tells us thousands of thousands
[1:03:23] of people that would kill themselves to
[1:03:25] keep from becoming
[1:03:27] captive to their enemy
[1:03:31] so Israel is not going to be worried
[1:03:33] about what's going to happen yeah
[1:03:37] we will all be sitting there because of
[1:03:39] the Covenant the bombs won't be falling
[1:03:42] it's just it just 144 000 in the
[1:03:44] tribulation calling down the things the
[1:03:46] two witnesses calling down the things
[1:03:50] but we need to realize something went
[1:03:52] wrong
[1:03:54] she's going to start throwing some bombs
[1:03:58] and when she does everybody else is
[1:04:00] going to start doing mom
[1:04:02] and I read to you the prophet said it'd
[1:04:04] be the atomic destruction that will
[1:04:07] cleanse the Earth Yep amen one place he
[1:04:10] says one time I didn't bring this one
[1:04:12] but he said everything just killed
[1:04:13] before the millennium
[1:04:21] seek Armageddon though
[1:04:23] will take place until we get out of here
[1:04:25] and it'll be three and a half years
[1:04:27] after we get out of here be right at the
[1:04:28] end of the tribulation
[1:04:30] all right
[1:04:32] with three and a half years it is what I
[1:04:34] keep saying that because some people
[1:04:35] connect us together and think we believe
[1:04:36] in seven years tribulation ain't never
[1:04:37] taught nothing like that never will go
[1:04:39] today in the Bible amen there's only
[1:04:41] three and a half years of tribulation
[1:04:46] but you see a cleanser of the Earth has
[1:04:48] to take place
[1:04:51] and that's the injection that'll bring
[1:04:53] Armageddon into being remember what I
[1:04:56] bring a while ago verse 12.
[1:04:59] tells you if you freak these drives up
[1:05:02] right verse 17 till 17 18 19 says
[1:05:07] there'll be an earthquake it'll happen
[1:05:09] it'll be greater than any earthquake has
[1:05:11] ever been
[1:05:14] Armageddon is bridged in between to show
[1:05:16] us what's going to take place right
[1:05:17] there
[1:05:20] now we're going to read in a minute what
[1:05:21] really takes place at Armageddon
[1:05:24] God is going to come down
[1:05:29] now remember he's not coming down to
[1:05:31] fight for the 144 000 right he will be
[1:05:34] doing that while they're here
[1:05:36] Oh They'll be calling down plagues of
[1:05:39] all forms but remember Armageddon
[1:05:41] they're already gone
[1:05:43] Armageddon the two witnesses had already
[1:05:45] gone
[1:05:52] the Armageddon will come to be a total
[1:05:54] termination and God will come down
[1:05:58] and I'm going to say it this way the
[1:06:00] majority of the Ministers of this
[1:06:01] message
[1:06:04] believe that we're going to ride back
[1:06:09] and battle in the battle of Armageddon
[1:06:16] I guess you're still so uh
[1:06:19] hide up in the world and the thoughts of
[1:06:21] life that they just want us to get some
[1:06:23] kind of a sword
[1:06:24] and they want us to ride back on that
[1:06:26] white horse and just killing everybody
[1:06:28] you know just well we're going to be
[1:06:30] over one of us going to be a kung fu
[1:06:32] where everyone's going to be better than
[1:06:34] all of these you know
[1:06:37] because that's what's called
[1:06:44] but folks
[1:06:46] I let's think we're gonna ride back with
[1:06:48] him and fight about him now if you
[1:06:51] believe it that's your business
[1:06:53] know but I just don't believe that no
[1:06:55] amen
[1:06:58] what me would be what kind of a battle
[1:07:00] would we fight we're Eternal they're
[1:07:03] moral all we have to say
[1:07:05] right come on man Joe they're gone
[1:07:10] we'll be eternal
[1:07:14] sure we ride back with him into the
[1:07:16] millennial reign
[1:07:18] on my horses amen
[1:07:22] but Brett Brown says God comes on the
[1:07:26] scene
[1:07:26] defy himself
[1:07:29] in the battle of Armageddon
[1:07:34] because he's normal
[1:07:36] don't have to worry about nothing
[1:07:38] but he's going to let them now listen to
[1:07:40] what I'm talking about
[1:07:41] see there's where the problem we don't
[1:07:43] think right
[1:07:47] you know that God didn't destroy the
[1:07:49] world with water so that's right
[1:07:51] everybody with me
[1:07:53] amen you know he didn't you know who
[1:07:55] destroyed the world of water
[1:07:57] people that's right right people rocked
[1:08:01] it out of orbit
[1:08:02] my Nuclear stuff and atomics and things
[1:08:06] brother Brown and said God don't destroy
[1:08:09] man man destroys himself that's right
[1:08:12] man all right
[1:08:14] are we are we right through the battle
[1:08:16] of Armageddon is not going to be
[1:08:20] God is doing it so much he's just going
[1:08:22] to let them kill each other
[1:08:25] they're going to cause it
[1:08:28] because see everybody about the times I
[1:08:31] said that old Pope walks in there and he
[1:08:33] says I want you to know
[1:08:37] it don't matter where you're Muslim
[1:08:40] hoodoos or whatever what kind of what
[1:08:42] you are You Belong To Me
[1:08:46] I'm in charge
[1:08:49] when he does Israel is going to see
[1:08:50] their mistake
[1:08:52] somebody is going to mash the button
[1:08:55] and when they match the button
[1:08:57] everybody's gonna match the buttons
[1:09:00] when they wipe the world end up
[1:09:01] delivering just almost totally
[1:09:03] annihilated almost
[1:09:05] just burn it over we'll put it that way
[1:09:07] but it won't annihilate because we know
[1:09:09] better than that
[1:09:12] but it'll burn off all the sin and the
[1:09:14] chaos of man
[1:09:17] but see God just let them do it yourself
[1:09:20] he didn't destroy the world with water
[1:09:22] we said well I got a call from right
[1:09:24] around him hey man Brayden do you find
[1:09:26] the others
[1:09:29] her brother Ryan says man destroyed
[1:09:31] himself
[1:09:33] that's right
[1:09:36] he brought on this thing and keep us out
[1:09:38] of water
[1:09:41] you realize when that and what is that
[1:09:43] big old word around that great big
[1:09:45] earthquake in the water struck over
[1:09:46] Earth
[1:09:48] Tsunami Tsunami hey I'll get it one of
[1:09:51] these days you know that they claimed
[1:09:53] the world at that time I read that

[1:09:57] about two degrees
[1:09:59] back up
[1:10:04] that one was a big one yeah
[1:10:06] but this old boy that comes over here
[1:10:08] after the end of all of it that God does
[1:10:10] bring right
[1:10:12] that we just read in verse
[1:10:14] 17 or 18 and greater than ever been

[1:16:55] together and he is from the four corners
[1:16:58] of the Earth
[1:17:01] now watch that next few words
[1:17:04] that's the key to understanding a lot of
[1:17:06] times
[1:17:09] Christ together he is not from the four
[1:17:11] corners of the Earth
[1:17:13] because there's going to be a little
[1:17:16] bitty red right
[1:17:20] that's all that's going to be on earth
[1:17:25] that little Remnant is you and I that's
[1:17:27] keeping them to come in from Battle
[1:17:29] right now
[1:17:30] but that little Remnant is is real 144
[1:17:34] 000 the two witnesses
[1:17:37] there's a little Remnant left on Earth
[1:17:40] go to Revelations 19 coming down we're
[1:17:42] coming down with him
[1:17:44] yeah but not to fight a battle
[1:17:48] but what are we going to do okay
[1:17:51] he's getting in from the four corners of
[1:17:53] Heaven
[1:17:55] we'll get them sold under the altar
[1:17:57] tomorrow night and you'll see whether
[1:17:58] it's right or not so these this group
[1:18:00] that he's got is gathered in heaven
[1:18:06] the others are getting on Earth four
[1:18:08] corners of Heaven on Snow White Horse
[1:18:10] these also have the name not death but
[1:18:12] the word of God lie that it wrote right
[1:18:15] on his thigh hear the word of God that's
[1:18:17] the only life because God is the only
[1:18:19] source of eternal life there he is Zoe
[1:18:21] that's right
[1:18:22] you've got life riding on a white horse
[1:18:26] and here's a man with three different
[1:18:27] powers mixed up Called Death given his
[1:18:29] Earthbound delegates and Christ is
[1:18:32] gathered and he is heaven-born subjects
[1:18:34] Saints
[1:18:37] all right
[1:18:38] we're going to ride back into the
[1:18:39] millennium
[1:18:41] but are we going to be fighting a battle
[1:18:43] that's the point I'm asking you
[1:18:48] I'm a kind of a battle would we find if
[1:18:50] we were already Eternal Immortal human
[1:18:53] beings
[1:18:54] right
[1:18:55] what would we find
[1:19:00] remember the part of the little Remnant
[1:19:02] yeah
[1:19:04] because that's where Armageddon takes
[1:19:07] place
[1:19:09] let that little Remnant just disappear
[1:19:11] in your Kong arm again
[1:19:16] and then we go riding into the
[1:19:17] Millennium not have to fight
[1:19:21] I've always said that to people I said
[1:19:23] oh my God what's your thought what what
[1:19:25] do you mean brother sit right over here
[1:19:27] one day one of the ministers means you
[1:19:29] remember
[1:19:30] he said well I always I've always been
[1:19:32] called that we fight that battle
[1:19:37] I said well when yeah right
[1:19:40] I mean they got Bazookas they got you
[1:19:43] know flamethrowers they got atomic bombs
[1:19:46] and we got the word to go to them and
[1:19:48] all that's gone
[1:19:51] what kind of a battle
[1:19:55] but she's having a Time 19 into a joke
[1:19:58] cause we go over into the millennium
[1:20:03] still wiping this thing out
[1:20:06] across got life right on him you're a
[1:20:08] white horse and often they're called the
[1:20:09] children because see those with him are
[1:20:11] owned by horses also they are to call
[1:20:14] the children before the foundation world
[1:20:16] this is when we get on over we'll read
[1:20:18] it in the 19th Chapter where the name is
[1:20:20] written on the side and the different
[1:20:22] children from the foundation World
[1:20:23] faithful to the word of God word of
[1:20:25] their choosing and all stimulated with
[1:20:27] new wine and oil just riding Right Along
[1:20:29] coming down to meet him they know the
[1:20:32] Thunders will issue the thing
[1:20:35] the thing course pretty soon
[1:20:39] what how does he do it
[1:20:42] so if he is the word and his name is the
[1:20:44] word and the word is
[1:20:45] where is life the Antichrist anything
[1:20:47] against it so Antichrist against the
[1:20:49] Christ the word so it's got to be a
[1:20:51] creep denomination which
[1:20:54] is against the word coming right back
[1:20:56] over to where we are they ain't going
[1:20:58] down what they say and don't miss it
[1:21:00] don't get the wrong thing come to the
[1:21:02] church ages I'm just trying to save time
[1:21:04] here we see life and death coming to the
[1:21:06] final struggle
[1:21:07] well just like some kind of battle we're
[1:21:09] going to make
[1:21:12] all right
[1:21:14] sounds just like we're going to come
[1:21:15] back in a battle
[1:21:21] thank you
[1:21:23] but let me just end that one time
[1:21:29] I tried to explain it Sunday
[1:21:34] there's quotes on down below where you
[1:21:36] gathers your subject and I'll
[1:21:39] try to explain it Sunday
[1:21:43] afternoon
[1:21:46] we're right now in a spiritual battle
[1:21:48] alarm again right right
[1:21:52] no doubt and for us to be able to be
[1:21:54] able to ride on that one of my horses to
[1:21:56] come back into the millennium
[1:21:58] this battle is going to have to be
[1:22:00] solved here now that's right amen for
[1:22:02] Rapture to take place for the bride
[1:22:06] this battle of Armageddon is going to
[1:22:08] have to be settled down that's right
[1:22:09] spiritual battle because we're not going
[1:22:11] to have a physical battle we're not
[1:22:13] going over the earth
[1:22:15] I don't even believe when we come riding
[1:22:17] back we're going to ride right in in the
[1:22:18] very presence of us and him coming in or
[1:22:20] just annihilate anything anyway it won't
[1:22:22] be a battle
[1:22:24] I've always been against that point of
[1:22:26] even thinking about a physical combat
[1:22:29] when their Mortals and we're Immortals
[1:22:31] right not these Immortals of these uh
[1:22:34] what is it the kind of a nine degree
[1:22:36] black belts don't even fight no more
[1:22:38] because there's so much Superior so much
[1:22:41] you know beyond and all like that well
[1:22:43] then they ain't even in the race
[1:22:46] whether it's that somebody's standing
[1:22:48] there it's Eternal right
[1:22:50] right because they still ain't eternal
[1:22:52] you remember that one he was about a six
[1:22:54] seven eight or somewhere in there and he
[1:22:55] decided he's gonna go sit down in that
[1:22:57] line dinner that Tiger's Den well they
[1:23:01] found a couple of pieces of his body and
[1:23:03] some of the skull
[1:23:05] because he thought he could go in there
[1:23:07] and whoop it oh boy
[1:23:10] just remember as long as we're in this
[1:23:13] world I don't care how fast you are how
[1:23:16] good you are with your feet in your
[1:23:18] hands you cannot run a bullet
[1:23:24] right right
[1:23:25] and that ain't even nothing the current
[1:23:27] prior to what we're talking about this
[1:23:29] gets a natural but listen Church
[1:23:33] if you and I can't win this battle over
[1:23:35] the Antichrist Doctrine and that's what
[1:23:38] we're battling amen whether you believe
[1:23:39] it or not you're battling doctrines
[1:23:42] hey man all right
[1:23:44] I'm not bad in the doctor I'm just
[1:23:46] having battling flesh
[1:23:48] well anyway you've got more to the
[1:23:51] battle to get on one of these days than
[1:23:52] you need to get on with it
[1:23:56] that's why a lot of people are never
[1:23:58] listen enough to know
[1:24:01] I've had people to look me every bit in
[1:24:03] the face of me telling them showing so
[1:24:05] so and so and they said he never
[1:24:06] said that
[1:24:10] here's the tape you want to listen to it
[1:24:12] you just make him say something
[1:24:16] if you want to say it
[1:24:18] he said Jesus went and gone to the River
[1:24:20] Jordan here it is read it you don't
[1:24:22] listen to it
[1:24:25] and she said right there and listen to
[1:24:27] weeks and hours and months of sermons of
[1:24:29] people and never catch thereof
[1:24:31] what's wrong
[1:24:35] maybe something wrong somewhere
[1:24:37] right
[1:24:41] especially here
[1:24:42] in what we've been trained right amen
[1:24:45] right
[1:24:46] train me to the point of
[1:24:49] to listen to every word you say it
[1:24:52] and the way out whatever words you say
[1:24:54] it and to see what you were talking
[1:24:56] about more than seeing what your mouth
[1:24:58] was literally letting out amen that's
[1:25:00] right
[1:25:03] and you know that there's a lot of these
[1:25:05] doctrines among the brethren
[1:25:08] that you can't find out from them what
[1:25:10] you want you got to go to somebody else
[1:25:14] you go to some of their assistances or
[1:25:17] some Churches following them and you'll
[1:25:19] get the truth about it
[1:25:24] I can go into a lot of doctrines and
[1:25:26] bring out a lot of natural things and I
[1:25:28] know
[1:25:29] of being hateful in there that's all
[1:25:31] about it but I've tried my best to help
[1:25:33] you
[1:25:34] if anybody else out there is listening
[1:25:36] that's up to you to what you listen to
[1:25:37] I'm not your pastor I'm not pastored
[1:25:40] internet I'm Pastor in Lula Georgia and
[1:25:43] then all
[1:25:45] but listen
[1:25:47] if we don't win this battle
[1:25:50] and they and if it don't come to a
[1:25:52] change of the body the Antichrist has
[1:25:53] whipped us whether you want to believe
[1:25:55] it or not right he's defeated us
[1:25:59] but it will stand up against it and say
[1:26:03] you're not saying what the prophet said
[1:26:05] right amen
[1:26:06] you know what they'll eventually won't
[1:26:08] come around
[1:26:09] because that's why they don't come here
[1:26:11] all right
[1:26:13] and one brother said he said I'll go
[1:26:15] anywhere in the messaging challenge
[1:26:18] the people
[1:26:19] to come and show me we're wrong but he
[1:26:20] said I don't do it Lula Georgia
[1:26:24] I know what I mean
[1:26:27] you think that felt that you think that
[1:26:29] made it big no it made him about as
[1:26:31] little as crawling under the floor
[1:26:35] because if he's afraid to do it here he
[1:26:37] ought to be afraid to do it anywhere in
[1:26:39] the world against the Bride of Jesus
[1:26:42] Christ right
[1:26:45] what I say I say here what I've always
[1:26:48] said I said home
[1:26:53] when I do I stand by what I say that's
[1:26:55] right
[1:26:58] because see this thing's got to be if we
[1:27:00] don't win this battle of Armageddon
[1:27:02] spiritually they're not going to be a
[1:27:04] physical battle over there amen but I'm
[1:27:06] trying my best to get you to see the
[1:27:07] night the battle of Armageddon is not
[1:27:09] Russia and China in the base of yes
[1:27:12] that's them coming down but he'd be
[1:27:14] Protestants and Catholics
[1:27:18] for the world
[1:27:20] and converts everything to their
[1:27:25] Doctrine that's right oh the Buddhist
[1:27:28] won't take down the temples of Buddha no
[1:27:30] the muscles will take down the
[1:27:32] temperature the bad this won't change
[1:27:34] the name the master this won't change
[1:27:36] come on
[1:27:40] he's going to destroy like that
[1:27:44] it's just when everybody's got the same
[1:27:46] Doctrine right
[1:27:47] one of them brother now wrote it down
[1:27:50] Muhammad didn't believe that that Mary
[1:27:52] was the mother of God
[1:27:56] I promise they probably didn't I don't
[1:27:58] know maybe he did but I'm trying to say
[1:28:00] he probably didn't
[1:28:03] but he was a heathen
[1:28:07] right right
[1:28:10] he wasn't a Christian
[1:28:14] I hear this Catholicism
[1:28:18] I've got it down in here look right
[1:28:19] around and said
[1:28:21] Nazism
[1:28:24] fascism
[1:28:25] communism winds up in Catholicism
[1:28:30] now Nazi ism
[1:28:32] communism
[1:28:35] fascism pretty well ruled shows you the
[1:28:39] world right
[1:28:41] you just come into mohammadisms and yeah
[1:28:44] yeah one of the isms and
[1:28:47] you know you go over to India right now
[1:28:49] that brother precaution says they have
[1:28:51] over what three million gods and
[1:28:52] goddesses and you go over actually I
[1:28:54] want to tell you about it you God will
[1:28:56] they okay Savannah we'll listen to you
[1:28:59] wasn't that what they were doing on Mars
[1:29:00] Hill
[1:29:02] they had an inscription for how many
[1:29:05] gods
[1:29:07] but just in case they left one out
[1:29:10] they made a little opening and set it
[1:29:12] down you know probably didn't put
[1:29:13] nothing in it just had a little block
[1:29:18] and it said under the bottom to the
[1:29:19] unknown God
[1:29:21] just in case they missed one of them you
[1:29:24] got the god of the toes you got the god
[1:29:26] of the heels you got the god of the feet
[1:29:27] you got out of the mouth you've got the
[1:29:28] god of the rain got the god of the sun
[1:29:30] you got all these villains and goddesses
[1:29:35] just in case you had one of them out
[1:29:38] so what did Paul say that's the card I
[1:29:41] want to talk to you about
[1:29:44] the unknown God
[1:29:48] see Church the unknown God is the only
[1:29:50] God there is there's not no catholicisms
[1:29:53] in the romanisms in this kind of ism and
[1:29:56] fascism and communism
[1:29:58] it's all that's what I'm trying to get
[1:30:00] you to see read the four seal
[1:30:04] it all comes down into one thing it'll
[1:30:07] all get tied up in
[1:30:10] Catholicism
[1:30:17] who's got to go to the world now
[1:30:22] come on I don't give a hoot I don't mean
[1:30:26] anything but can I I'm trying to make a
[1:30:28] point
[1:30:29] doesn't matter to me if it's China
[1:30:31] India Russia Africa
[1:30:44] what's the difference one more heaters
[1:30:47] the problem is going to be when the big
[1:30:49] guy stepped up and says I own you
[1:30:54] said we're not gonna say Okay pay you
[1:30:57] debt
[1:30:59] was that not what happened to Communism
[1:31:07] who do you think the world Banks and all
[1:31:09] the people are
[1:31:11] you know that I read shortly after
[1:31:12] communism went down that day was at that
[1:31:15] time after then but there were more
[1:31:17] billionaires in Russia
[1:31:20] than there was in the United States
[1:31:25] where do you think their money was at
[1:31:27] Swiss bank account right come on
[1:31:29] properties brought it up now they own
[1:31:31] everything
[1:31:33] and what am I trying to get you to see
[1:31:36] those three unclean spirits like frogs
[1:31:39] just went to the profit said to every
[1:31:40] corner of the world and gonna bring them
[1:31:42] from every place in the world to bring
[1:31:44] them down to their to where he can
[1:31:47] declare himself to be God
[1:31:49] and those that rebel against him he'll
[1:31:52] destroy them
[1:31:53] why because he owns the wealth of the
[1:31:56] world the Bible says in him
[1:31:58] we'll get on over and read a few more
[1:32:00] where it says the merchants that used to
[1:32:02] trade with him listen it says they back
[1:32:05] off from him
[1:32:08] it's just showing the natural since they
[1:32:10] back off from what from Rome
[1:32:15] the merchants of the world
[1:32:18] back off
[1:32:21] because when they see battling go down
[1:32:24] no
[1:32:27] come on
[1:32:28] you understand one more time don't
[1:32:31] matter what country in the world it is
[1:32:33] it's all hedonism
[1:32:36] Israel is the only nation when it comes
[1:32:39] to the tribulation that even is trying
[1:32:40] to believe that a one true and living
[1:32:43] God form right
[1:32:46] you're right the United States we're
[1:32:48] already trinitarian to the course of
[1:32:50] what's the matter amen
[1:32:53] rides are supposed to be gone so it
[1:32:55] ain't nothing like that Israel will be
[1:32:57] left
[1:32:58] and when he walks in there and says I'm
[1:33:00] glad to look at him and say you're not
[1:33:02] him
[1:33:03] but that's not the 144 000 that's not to
[1:33:06] well that's just natural Israel when
[1:33:08] they wind up and see what's wrong and
[1:33:09] then they push the buttons the things
[1:33:12] start blowing the
[1:33:15] then God or step on with a great
[1:33:17] earthquake and just wipe everything
[1:33:21] you see what I'm talking about amen
[1:33:25] you see what I've been trying to get
[1:33:27] across to you for 40 years
[1:33:29] read the seal book
[1:33:32] I remember I was looking down through
[1:33:34] the chart list you know all the books
[1:33:36] the index thing
[1:33:37] I'm looking at the index one day and I
[1:33:40] saw a tape there and it said invasion of
[1:33:42] the U.S
[1:33:44] man I run up here and I look through our
[1:33:47] tapes and I found that I thought I'm
[1:33:50] gonna find out how this United States
[1:33:52] gets War this Beat to Death or so what
[1:33:55] country is going to do it Russia's
[1:33:56] coming in when I heard brother Ryan say
[1:33:58] one of these days you'll wake up and
[1:33:59] there'll be a Russian standing with a
[1:34:01] gun pointed in your face
[1:34:03] that's what he said
[1:34:09] all right
[1:34:10] he starts talking about what I'm talking
[1:34:13] about
[1:34:14] he starts talking about
[1:34:16] not a nations of the world
[1:34:18] but how that Catholicism
[1:34:22] through Methodist and Baptists and
[1:34:24] Presbyterian the Pentecostal and brown
[1:34:25] of my she didn't use that word there I
[1:34:27] put it in
[1:34:29] we showed how that they are conquered
[1:34:33] by the Catholicism
[1:34:38] the pope don't want the the other
[1:34:40] countries to come down and bow down to
[1:34:43] him and call him God in the bases of of
[1:34:45] they've got their own they keep their
[1:34:47] own religious beliefs but
[1:34:50] they belong to me
[1:34:52] and he says if you don't Bow Down
[1:34:57] yep I'll declare your debt invite it and
[1:35:00] take over the whole country
[1:35:04] you say you can't do that
[1:35:08] we're the image to the Beast we're the
[1:35:12] people that sets up all of those things
[1:35:20] until it comes our Doomsday
[1:35:25] I hope you understand what I'm talking
[1:35:27] about
[1:35:29] if you and I can't win this spiritual
[1:35:31] battle and go out of here in a Rapture
[1:35:33] though don't be concerned about all of
[1:35:34] that
[1:35:35] as well
[1:35:37] there's nothing to do with us it'll be
[1:35:39] an end of all time
[1:35:41] you and I have got to become one with
[1:35:43] the word gotta Unite with the word we're
[1:35:45] reading
[1:35:47] become one with that word
[1:35:49] that's right and to do that it might
[1:35:51] cost us a lot of friendships
[1:35:54] you know
[1:35:57] it's cost me a lot of them
[1:35:59] for me just standing here and saying
[1:36:00] this is the way I see it if you don't
[1:36:02] believe it come and show me something
[1:36:03] different that's made me everything in
[1:36:06] the world
[1:36:08] the coach
[1:36:10] there is a bride
[1:36:12] there is a God there is a word that's
[1:36:16] right
[1:36:17] and that word is what's going to conquer
[1:36:19] that word to those two prophets is going
[1:36:21] to bring down plagues right yeah right
[1:36:24] you know that God don't have to be here
[1:36:27] to end it up an Armageddon
[1:36:29] those two witnesses can stand there just
[1:36:31] before their translation and they can
[1:36:33] say Let It Be
[1:36:36] yep
[1:36:37] that 144 000 if they live any longer
[1:36:41] don't go up in there with it they can
[1:36:43] stand right there and say Let It Be
[1:36:45] that's right
[1:36:46] and it will be amen and God don't have
[1:36:49] to come down and battle
[1:36:54] and I hope that's one thing that sunk in
[1:36:57] tonight
[1:36:58] what kind of a battle would it be
[1:37:00] between Mortals
[1:37:03] and an eternal Immortal bride
[1:37:11] the battle is going on now amen that's
[1:37:14] right that's right
[1:37:16] if you and I can't take the word and
[1:37:18] stand here now and say this is what the
[1:37:21] prophet said
[1:37:22] forget it
[1:37:27] and we're going to be in the world
[1:37:29] Council of churches
[1:37:33] because we're already got the
[1:37:34] trinitarian ID on their mind oh but
[1:37:37] brother Dale we should be friendly with
[1:37:39] everybody I try to
[1:37:42] don't you yeah
[1:37:44] show me somebody that I haven't tried to
[1:37:46] be friends with when I befriended people
[1:37:48] that I didn't even agree with I let
[1:37:50] people come preaching this church that I
[1:37:52] knew they was wrong
[1:37:54] proud to be friends with them
[1:37:59] I tried to be a brother in the Lord
[1:38:03] the man jumped like everything and said
[1:38:05] an antichrist wrote to his church
[1:38:07] I called him and said you're wrong
[1:38:12] but you're preaching Wednesday night
[1:38:13] right here in my church to prove it I
[1:38:15] don't have anything against you
[1:38:17] now how many preachers would do that
[1:38:23] when you call them on Southern
[1:38:24] Antichrist
[1:38:26] how many preachers out there of you on
[1:38:28] the internet how many of you would do it
[1:38:29] I've tried to be friends with everybody
[1:38:31] to love everybody
[1:38:33] but I'm trying my best to stay with this
[1:38:35] word amen right I want to know what that
[1:38:39] Prophet had to say that's right your
[1:38:41] opinion in my opinion ain't worth
[1:38:43] fooling with no that's right
[1:38:47] see it's going to be a word born bride
[1:38:50] that'll take a change
[1:38:53] not a bunch of babies sniffling running
[1:38:56] around
[1:38:57] can't never be satisfied can't never be
[1:38:59] settled
[1:39:01] right
[1:39:07] there's no stand on the word and say the
[1:39:09] word says it and I believe it
[1:39:15] what do you think about it
[1:39:18] they're going to be a spiritual battle
[1:39:20] in you and I if that's not one there
[1:39:22] won't be a physical battle they need to
[1:39:23] no need to have it
[1:39:25] but let me tell you the story before we
[1:39:27] handle
[1:39:28] they will be your bride they will take
[1:39:31] God's word and they will be a spiritual
[1:39:34] arm again and
[1:39:36] bombarding us like now to death about it
[1:39:42] doctrines and ideas flying on every hand
[1:39:47] was wrong didn't even now saying Jesus
[1:39:49] was wrong
[1:39:52] and yet I'm wrong to say something
[1:39:57] I stood right here in 1974 and proved
[1:39:59] that we could pass the year 2026.
[1:40:02] and not break a word on it and prove it
[1:40:04] by Brother round
[1:40:06] but I've never been popular and nobody's
[1:40:08] ever asked me to come to their church
[1:40:09] and preach it
[1:40:15] come on you simple brother Dale you're
[1:40:16] just I know it I'm just human
[1:40:20] I'm just me
[1:40:23] but you know these brothers can go out
[1:40:25] and prophesy and predict and do
[1:40:27] everything in the world and condemn you
[1:40:29] and scream and holler at you you've got
[1:40:30] to believe what I'm saying oh that's
[1:40:32] bruh
[1:40:34] he's a good brother
[1:40:42] you see I fight this out at home in my
[1:40:44] own self
[1:40:47] I'm not trying to be hateful to nobody
[1:40:49] I've never tried to be
[1:40:51] I try to love everybody and try to help
[1:40:53] everybody
[1:40:55] I'd fly anywhere in the world today to
[1:40:57] try to help somebody if it was really
[1:40:58] appointed woman and you start thinking
[1:41:00] of Apple
[1:41:03] all right do anything I could
[1:41:07] to help somebody
[1:41:12] I'm not going to get out of here
[1:41:15] I'm like brother my brother said you
[1:41:18] know he said he was 80 years old and he
[1:41:19] said
[1:41:21] I'm going to get out of here one way or
[1:41:23] the other pretty quick
[1:41:26] and I agree with you he's gonna die or
[1:41:28] he's going to Rapture or something
[1:41:30] that's 80 years old well there's a lot
[1:41:32] of us getting on up there and got some
[1:41:33] gears on us you know
[1:41:35] and uh
[1:41:40] let me think about it let's stay
[1:41:43] back on these things
[1:41:45] Armageddon
[1:41:48] if the forces can't be terminated and
[1:41:51] you and I they can't be terminated in
[1:41:53] the world it can't be done
[1:41:54] all right
[1:41:56] I hope you'll just take what I said and
[1:41:58] lay it down and then come and show me if
[1:42:00] I'm wrong or Israel is at and how Israel
[1:42:02] is in the Covenant with the Antichrist
[1:42:04] the whole world is in the Covenant with
[1:42:06] the Antichrist
[1:42:10] that's what your Bible says and
[1:42:11] Merchants of the World when they see her
[1:42:14] fall and get on over another chapter and
[1:42:17] says they back away from her
[1:42:21] so the whole world must be in an
[1:42:23] antichrist Covenant
[1:42:26] and don't you think well we we we're not
[1:42:29] in the Covenant brother we're not
[1:42:36] these things don't get made overnight
[1:42:39] covenants between nations are sometimes
[1:42:42] many years in the making
[1:42:45] before they're consummated as a covenant
[1:42:53] the Pope
[1:42:55] step down
[1:42:57] somebody else's gonna take over
[1:43:00] the two main Front Runners as of
[1:43:02] yesterday's paper
[1:43:04] I'd cheer some people up out there on
[1:43:06] the internet
[1:43:08] yesterday's papers said the Two Front
[1:43:10] Runners that were answering all the
[1:43:12] questions related to this situation
[1:43:15] we're from the U.S
[1:43:18] that was in yesterday's paper
[1:43:25] let's not be the guy that comes to the
[1:43:27] U.S but what if it ain't
[1:43:34] what are we gonna do
