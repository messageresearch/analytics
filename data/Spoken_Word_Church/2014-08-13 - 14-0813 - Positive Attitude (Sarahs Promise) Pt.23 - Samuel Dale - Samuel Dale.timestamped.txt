[4:43] would have to be said
[4:45] and we we love you and we thank you in
[4:48] jesus name
[4:49] amen okay hebrews 11
[4:54] we're reading one and two you know to
[4:55] get a point
[4:57] now faith is a substance of things hoped
[4:59] for
[5:00] the evidence of things not seen for
[5:04] by it by faith the elders obtained a
[5:08] good
[5:09] report now we're going to each one with
[5:12] taking
[5:13] the report that they made so verse 11
[5:16] says
[5:17] through faith also sarah herself
[5:20] conceived strength to
[5:22] conceive seed and was delivered of a
[5:24] child when she was past
[5:25] age because she judged him faithful who
[5:28] had promised
[5:29] now putting these two together because
[5:31] it it has a connection
[5:34] therefore spraying there even of one and
[5:38] him
[5:38] as good as dead so many as the stars
[5:41] of the sky in multitude and as the sand
[5:45] which is by the seashore
[5:47] innumerable so you may be seated lord at
[5:50] his
[5:50] blessing to the reading of the word
[5:54] now we
[5:57] are trying to take each one of these
[6:00] in our studies and things and going
[6:04] through
[6:05] some of the things you know the the
[6:07] points of looking at them and
[6:09] and seeing each one and you know their
[6:12] time and being and we went through able
[6:15] and
[6:16] then we went through noah and uh
[6:19] you know enoch then on to noah and then
[6:22] through
[6:22] abraham the last wednesday night
[6:26] and uh speaking about
[6:30] you know abraham's journey this past
[6:32] wednesday night then we were down about
[6:34] talking about our journey because the
[6:36] prophet of god said on the message who
[6:38] is this melchizedek
[6:40] said here he unfolds what all the
[6:42] attributes
[6:44] will do in the final end now what
[6:47] happened in abraham
[6:49] that we can look at and know that will
[6:50] happen in you and i
[6:52] abraham met god many times
[6:57] personally talking to him hearing him
[7:00] uh you know only in his journey
[7:03] but then one day he met melchizedek
[7:08] well we know then according to the
[7:10] message of the hour
[7:12] that melchizedek was almighty god
[7:15] okay all right so then he met
[7:18] god in a form of a man
[7:22] and was standing there and he was called
[7:25] melchizedek
[7:26] all right who was that the word
[7:30] right right the word
[7:34] made of flesh stepped into it
[7:38] you know and was down with abraham
[7:42] and doing that then it shows that
[7:45] every true believer
[7:50] will meet the word for the day that
[7:53] we're living
[7:54] all right you you know you can go back
[7:57] with the ages
[7:58] and say that that each age had a part of
[8:01] the word
[8:02] okay and is coming forth as
[8:06] giving understanding and being to that
[8:09] point
[8:10] and seeing that the word of their age
[8:12] was what they were making manifest
[8:15] but then we come down to the end of the
[8:17] point that
[8:19] i like to think of it like this that
[8:22] abraham met melchizedek
[8:26] talked with him etc and that was the
[8:29] word
[8:30] right almighty god creating
[8:34] a body and coming living in it but it's
[8:37] not
[8:37] it's not for you and i to just meet the
[8:39] word
[8:41] that's right i hope you was listening to
[8:43] what i was trying to bring out
[8:45] there the other night see we're not to
[8:47] just meet the word or know the word or
[8:49] how the word or
[8:50] or you know we thank god for all of that
[8:54] but we must become the word amen
[8:58] for the age that we're living all right
[9:00] then we found
[9:01] too that in this age that it's the
[9:04] promise of the
[9:06] entire word that's right
[9:09] i mean as far as man knows of almighty
[9:11] god
[9:12] there'll be a message of cheer down
[9:13] through the endless ages that we're not
[9:16] uh worried about but for what is to be
[9:20] revealed in this day
[9:22] and time then we are the ones that
[9:26] will meet melchizedek or have met
[9:30] melchizedek in the form of the word
[9:33] i've taught you and believed that this
[9:36] message
[9:36] is the uh you know the thing to carry us
[9:40] through the journey
[9:42] and it winds up being the headstone to
[9:44] the body
[9:45] i believe the opening of those seals is
[9:48] that point
[9:50] of the connecting of the word to the
[9:52] body
[9:53] and showing the day and the hour and
[9:55] we're living all right what has been our
[9:57] thought throughout this whole
[9:59] 20-something messages a positive
[10:02] attitude
[10:04] all right and the only way you can have
[10:06] a positive attitude
[10:08] is for you to have a personal contact
[10:12] with god all right
[10:15] now you can say well these people over
[10:17] here they do this
[10:18] they do that i'm not throwing off on
[10:20] nobody just telling it the way it goes
[10:22] the way it is
[10:24] you can say they have a positive
[10:25] attitude look at them look at all
[10:27] they're doing
[10:28] well that's great look at all the
[10:30] hospitals look at all the
[10:32] beautiful things that is being done in
[10:34] the world today
[10:36] by the what we call the religious
[10:38] society
[10:40] all right but in all of that they can do
[10:42] every bit of that and not meet the word
[10:45] amen
[10:46] but yet they claim to have the word and
[10:48] they do to a degree
[10:50] and they can take so much of the word
[10:52] the prophet said and make it work
[10:54] all right but we are not to just meet
[10:57] the word
[10:58] amen
[11:01] you know i told you before many times
[11:03] anybody in the bible had ever amounted
[11:05] to anything
[11:07] had a personal contact with god
[11:11] for that age all right
[11:14] and see doing that then we can see
[11:16] coming down through the bible get into
[11:18] the new testament coming on down
[11:21] that as those ages come forth they had
[11:25] a word to be brought all right
[11:28] but we're not to just to have a word to
[11:30] be brought
[11:34] we are to be the word made flesh
[11:38] i believe that i've always taught it
[11:40] that way that's why
[11:42] i believe when the prophet of god said
[11:43] the bride to be the fullness of the
[11:45] godhead bodily
[11:46] i can say amen because i believe it
[11:50] i believe that we've been down through
[11:52] those things and seeing the ages that we
[11:55] represent
[11:57] and that we don't represent pentecost
[12:00] as mary did we are
[12:03] to be back to the original seed that
[12:06] went into the ground
[12:09] all right in doing that then we have
[12:12] the most we everything is we'll get to
[12:15] it when we finish with this
[12:17] little maybe one more message uh then
[12:20] we'll get into the day without
[12:21] us cannot be made perfect all right
[12:24] because see
[12:25] everything behind us is dependent on you
[12:27] and i yeah
[12:29] we have a wonderful opportunity but we
[12:32] have a great responsibility
[12:35] all right and the responsibility is to
[12:38] uh not to just talk about the word but
[12:41] to be the word
[12:43] all right now it may be surprising when
[12:46] we get into those things
[12:48] because what a lot of people talk about
[12:50] when you meet the word
[12:52] i'll put it in this way and you'll see
[12:53] where my thoughts going
[12:56] a lot of people says well brother dale
[12:59] what do you mean in
[13:00] us becoming the word well one side will
[13:03] take it as
[13:04] memorize it know it to the letter
[13:08] all right we know that's
[13:11] good but it won't manifest the way god
[13:14] wants it
[13:15] and we know also that you take the other
[13:17] side of it and say
[13:19] well okay let's find everything we're
[13:22] supposed to do and we'll do it let's
[13:24] find everything that we're
[13:26] not to do and we won't do it and we'll
[13:28] become the word
[13:31] well that won't go that way either
[13:34] so we've got to find the middle of the
[13:36] road
[13:38] all right now i'm going to say this up
[13:40] front and then come back to it later
[13:45] and you hold on to it we're going to
[13:48] talk about
[13:48] sarah's journey tonight
[13:52] all right and the point i want you to
[13:54] get is
[13:57] is that she went through a journey
[14:00] all right she had a journey just like
[14:03] abraham had a journey
[14:05] but we want to look at the bad part of
[14:07] it
[14:09] we you mentioned sarah give her and
[14:12] she's done this
[14:13] and she's done that and she's done with
[14:15] hagar and she's done this she's done
[14:17] that and
[14:18] you know all we can think about is the
[14:20] the bad parts
[14:25] but what if the prophet would say
[14:30] that sarah represents the church
[14:38] today
[14:43] see if you're computer-minded and run
[14:44] through it you'll say sarah represented
[14:47] wesley that's true what that's true
[14:54] but what about sarah representing you
[14:56] and i
[15:02] yeah but now we don't want to be related
[15:04] with sarah we'll be related with abraham
[15:07] well i wish for one time
[15:11] that you could become out of such a
[15:14] supernatural super-duper revelation
[15:17] faith and i hope to god this goes across
[15:20] right
[15:21] but get down to being human beings
[15:26] who have a contact with god
[15:30] and that's the only thing that makes us
[15:32] super duper
[15:34] is our contact with god all right
[15:39] we think we're the great revelated
[15:41] people
[15:42] well that's all right
[15:47] but can we look back in the bible and
[15:49] relate to those in the bible
[15:53] oh yeah we like to relate to to abel
[15:58] we we like to relate to enoch
[16:03] and we like to relate to noah
[16:06] and we like to relate to abraham you
[16:09] know
[16:11] and those things
[16:15] but what about
[16:19] our relationship with sarah or our
[16:22] connection
[16:24] are watching her journey
[16:27] and see that you and i have all taken
[16:30] the same journey
[16:35] no i've taken i've taken abraham's
[16:41] i don't be relating sarah
[16:45] well then you'd leave wesley out because
[16:49] she does represent the tassel
[16:53] we don't want to be related with hagar
[16:55] but yet
[16:57] according to seed not air with a shock
[17:01] hagar represented luther and
[17:04] justification
[17:09] but you see we're so revelated to we
[17:13] don't want to be connected with any of
[17:14] those things
[17:19] but you know sometimes to just sit down
[17:22] and look back there and see what they've
[17:24] done
[17:25] it might help you and i in our journey
[17:29] right right all right
[17:35] to think about natural people
[17:39] doing natural things
[17:43] all right relating it to
[17:47] the bride of christ and seeing
[17:51] the day and the hour that we're living
[17:53] amen
[17:57] we want to talk about abrahams see
[18:00] i want my connections to abraham right
[18:03] that's where we want to be
[18:07] but you know
[18:11] in genesis 17 17 and 18.
[18:17] let's go back with the line we're trying
[18:18] to train josiah i reckon he's back there
[18:22] and uh i told him i'd try to be a little
[18:25] you know not jump around so much i try
[18:27] to stick with my notes
[18:28] where he can follow so brothers josiah
[18:31] he's hooked up on there and he's
[18:32] training and
[18:34] uh zach is supposed to be back there and
[18:37] we want him to get
[18:38] you know into doing it where that we
[18:40] need them
[18:41] and they can help and do things all
[18:44] right
[18:44] and so go ahead and pull up number one
[18:48] which is genesis 18.
[18:53] and let's just think about sarah
[18:56] and her journey all right we we like to
[19:00] lay on this one real heavy don't we
[19:04] that sarah lifed
[19:07] within herself
[19:10] and saying how can this happen
[19:18] how can these things take place
[19:22] if sarah was laughing
[19:25] and we know the story and we like to
[19:27] relate it and it's fine
[19:28] according to what you're comparing it
[19:30] with in the point
[19:32] that if it hadn't been for abraham
[19:35] you know abram at the time to have taken
[19:39] care of
[19:40] sarah there's been a lot of problems all
[19:42] right but we want to stay on that point
[19:47] but see we don't want to get to number
[19:48] two go ahead which is
[19:50] now remember genesis 18.
[19:53] now number two is genesis 17
[19:57] and according to my mathematical
[19:59] calculation that comes
[20:01] before the 18. it's okay
[20:08] god's speaking to abraham
[20:13] and he fell on his face and lied
[20:20] doesn't got his name changed
[20:25] done met god on many things
[20:32] and he laughed it just says oh sarah
[20:35] that she kind of giggled
[20:37] that the way the prophet described it
[20:39] says she kind of just giggled you know
[20:41] said can it be this way abraham when god
[20:44] speaks to him
[20:45] which is prior to speaking to where it
[20:48] happens with sarah
[20:49] he falls on his face and he's laughing
[20:53] then he gets up and he says
[20:57] name change met melchizedek
[21:00] and all of these things many times in
[21:03] his journey he met god
[21:05] and he gets up and he's trying to deal
[21:07] with god oh that is one
[21:10] might live before thee
[21:13] see we want to put all of the
[21:14] relationship with the fact that
[21:16] sarah liked
[21:19] we want to read over in
[21:23] the scriptures it said abraham
[21:27] doubted not
[21:30] right
[21:34] we want to put it that way all right
[21:39] now let's put it that way
[21:42] so remember
[21:46] we read here in genesis i mean in in
[21:50] hebrews 11 11
[21:55] it says talking of sarah
[22:00] and it doesn't mention her doubting
[22:07] right come on we read hebrews 11 11
[22:12] and it says that she through what
[22:17] through faith also sarah
[22:23] herself received strength to conceive
[22:26] seed
[22:28] and was delivered of a child when she
[22:31] was pissed
[22:32] age because she judged him
[22:35] faithful who had
[22:38] promised now you know the story down
[22:42] through the
[22:43] doings of abraham and sarah that
[22:46] he starts off abram and god speaks to
[22:49] him and tells him he's going to have a
[22:50] child and
[22:53] but you know he doesn't tell him who is
[22:56] going to come through
[22:58] right come on he doesn't tell him first
[23:01] off it's going to be sarah
[23:06] so
[23:10] abraham listens to
[23:14] sarah the part we want to
[23:17] try to relate to her and make her look
[23:19] so bad
[23:21] that she doubted the promise of god
[23:25] said let hagar have the child
[23:30] and i was looking at a quote there a
[23:31] minute ago and and i was going to write
[23:33] this down in my bible and
[23:35] i will have it down where brother
[23:37] branham on the message sees not air with
[23:39] a shuck in los angeles california
[23:41] paragraph 39 he said abram didn't
[23:44] abraham didn't want to do that
[23:48] but god told him to go ahead and do it
[23:51] anyhow
[23:53] amen now that's not in the scripture of
[23:56] god saying abraham go ahead
[24:01] that's brother branham telling us what's
[24:03] in the scriptures
[24:05] all right so abraham goes along with
[24:07] sarah
[24:11] all right and you get a hagar
[24:14] but remember hagar's got to be in the
[24:16] promised son
[24:18] ours were you going to swallow and say
[24:19] you missed it brother dale
[24:21] because hagar represented
[24:25] luther of justification
[24:30] is not that the promised son
[24:35] right i know you're sitting mighty quiet
[24:39] you ain't even blinking most of you but
[24:42] because you probably never thought on
[24:44] that line
[24:47] but read seeds not air with a shock
[24:51] hagar represented justification well if
[24:53] you're going to leave
[24:54] gar out of the whole thing
[24:58] then you're going to leave luther out of
[25:00] it
[25:02] and brother branham says luther took his
[25:05] like hagar
[25:06] said took his child
[25:09] and gave it over to a denomination
[25:15] that's what luther done with it
[25:18] what are you following me now picking up
[25:22] things that you don't
[25:23] generally think of
[25:28] to put it into a line of seeing what
[25:30] took place
[25:31] in sarah's journey that is related to
[25:36] our journey
[25:40] oh we we we want to be related to
[25:43] abraham
[25:44] that's what i'm saying right
[25:53] all right then
[25:57] but remember sarah finally learns
[26:05] that the promise is to come from her
[26:13] right you know
[26:17] i mean well we're in the journey
[26:20] and they're doing everything in the
[26:21] world they can to try to figure out how
[26:23] to get everything to work
[26:24] about the promise and one day god says
[26:27] to abraham
[26:28] says sarah is going to have
[26:32] the child amen
[26:37] well that's when abraham begins to life
[26:42] because he's got a hagar
[26:46] and he's got an ismo
[26:50] but he knows that's not the promised
[26:54] son that god promised him would come
[26:56] from him
[26:59] right so sarah's got a journey
[27:04] and i like it the way that it says
[27:06] because it'll say by faith abraham uh
[27:09] abraham by faith nor by faith you know
[27:12] by faith
[27:12] abel by faith the different ones that it
[27:16] goes on through
[27:18] but the siren says true faith
[27:26] i think we need to relate to sarah just
[27:29] a little bit
[27:32] and get our super-duper mind off of
[27:35] relating to abraham
[27:42] that might be an odd way of putting
[27:43] things right i'd like you to go home and
[27:46] think that over
[27:50] like i told a man the other day we were
[27:51] talking to him i said we need to quit
[27:53] right now
[27:54] and let you think this over
[28:01] can you relate yourself with sarah
[28:07] no i don't want to i ain't relating to
[28:10] sarah
[28:13] well i will remind you that
[28:16] something happened somewhere in the
[28:18] journey and you know what sarah wound up
[28:21] having a child
[28:23] that was the promise so take your
[28:26] super-dupers
[28:27] and bring the children
[28:32] you can't get it's more here without
[28:35] sarah
[28:41] verizoa excuse me you get excellent
[28:43] through hagar
[28:45] you can't get isaac
[28:50] without sarah
[28:55] said no god can do what he wants to not
[28:59] when he says what he's
[29:02] going to do he can't
[29:05] change from that right amen
[29:09] all right he hadn't told abram or
[29:12] abraham later either who the child was
[29:16] coming through
[29:17] but he knew who it was coming through
[29:26] we know that each church age had its
[29:29] part and its time
[29:31] luther had all day wesley had a day
[29:33] baptist saturday
[29:34] method of saturday presbyterian etc
[29:37] part of the word of god all right
[29:42] but we know that each one of those
[29:46] coming all the way down to azusa street
[29:50] to represent mary the prophet says
[29:53] see not out with a shock and he actually
[29:56] says in there says mary's not the seed
[30:00] remember that we've been through this
[30:02] before well mary wasn't the seed
[30:05] the seed was inside of mary
[30:09] amen not leaving out of zeus the street
[30:13] is not being a part of it we've got to
[30:15] have all of that to bring it down to the
[30:16] hour that we're living
[30:19] but there's also got to be a group of
[30:21] people
[30:22] to represent the restored
[30:25] original word
[30:30] oh brother dale you make it so
[30:34] complicated
[30:37] is that complicated
[30:42] you know
[30:46] is it complicated to take all of the
[30:48] years or the profit
[30:49] and his studies and bringing it down and
[30:51] showing that this age
[30:54] now it's complicated because you don't
[30:55] want to read the books and listen to the
[30:56] tapes
[30:57] and pay attention so you want your ideas
[31:01] your thoughts your concept well okay go
[31:04] ahead
[31:05] i'm just me all right
[31:08] at least there's a way i can see it come
[31:11] together
[31:12] and make a beautiful picture
[31:15] anything we want to think about sarah
[31:18] laughing
[31:19] doing this or that or the other
[31:22] remember some way
[31:25] somehow she came to a place
[31:30] until she produced the seed
[31:34] that god was intended to bring
[31:37] amen well
[31:41] you know i'm not much worried about
[31:44] the problems
[31:49] the main thing i'm concerned with is
[31:52] sarah reaching an
[31:53] end in her faith because it says through
[31:56] faith
[31:57] a journey
[32:00] and through her journey
[32:04] how would you like to be sarah
[32:07] and your husband give you away two times
[32:16] trying to save his own neck
[32:21] i've always said i've got confidence in
[32:23] my wife
[32:24] she wouldn't put up with that
[32:28] and if i was her and she was me i
[32:30] wouldn't put up with it either
[32:36] there's some things that there's no type
[32:38] of
[32:39] you know everybody says oh everything's
[32:42] a type
[32:44] well now take abraham giving his wife
[32:47] away
[32:47] two times and type that
[32:51] and here comes his son isaac and you
[32:54] know what the old boy does
[32:56] he gives away his wife just like daddy
[33:05] well you know what i'm as honest as i
[33:08] can be
[33:09] there's not as much bad when you really
[33:11] begin to look at it
[33:12] in the life of sarah
[33:15] as there is in the life of abraham
[33:19] come on be sensible
[33:24] read your bible and think it over
[33:28] she simply doubts the promise of god
[33:34] well now you tell me that abraham didn't
[33:36] doubt from along the journey
[33:39] but yet when it's written of him later
[33:42] he said he doubted not you know what
[33:45] because god didn't see it
[33:47] well you know what for sarah to produce
[33:50] the child you know that god didn't see
[33:53] her doubting
[33:55] and remember what i said there a while
[33:57] ago
[33:59] and even about hagar and sarah doubting
[34:04] that god tells abraham
[34:10] to go do what sarah said
[34:14] that's why i love that part if you don't
[34:16] like that you read what the prophet said
[34:18] see that i already shook los angeles
[34:19] california
[34:22] paragraph 39
[34:26] god tells him to go ahead
[34:31] because god knew there was going to have
[34:32] to be a top to get a justification
[34:37] right
[34:40] he knew they'd have to be a type to get
[34:42] a sanctification
[34:44] right and then there'd have to be a type
[34:47] to get a baptism of the holy ghost
[34:53] and then they'd have to be not a type
[34:56] but
[34:57] a total completion of the word
[35:04] are you listening
[35:07] say relies abraham life
[35:12] sarah's not mentioned anymore about her
[35:15] doing
[35:16] other than her fussing between her and
[35:19] hagar
[35:20] and keeping abraham in trouble between
[35:22] two wives and anybody that's got twos
[35:24] got two troubles
[35:27] you know i certainly am glad that we
[35:29] don't believe in polygamy
[35:34] because there would be a lot of
[35:38] bachelors
[35:41] once they realized putting up with that
[35:44] no brother homer longor says think david
[35:48] had 700 wives
[35:49] and 700 mother-in-laws
[35:55] all right but listen
[35:59] what's my point
[36:04] god finally tells
[36:08] after abraham his name is changed
[36:12] after all the things happened and even
[36:14] after his name is
[36:15] he's trying to still deal with god to
[36:17] get ishmael
[36:19] to be the promise he finally tells him
[36:24] he said sarah is going to hell the child
[36:31] well he just rolled over and lies
[36:41] but you know god didn't see that
[36:44] so he never seen his doubts
[36:47] you know what but he never seen sarah's
[36:49] doubts either
[36:52] okay
[36:56] remember sarah's the top of the church
[36:59] today
[37:00] we'll read that in a minute
[37:05] he finally tells abraham
[37:09] the promised son
[37:12] and where it's going to become
[37:18] abraham goes and tells sarah
[37:22] sarah god just told me
[37:28] you're going to have the child
[37:34] you know what
[37:38] she must have believed him
[37:44] that's why i was wanting to read that
[37:45] scripture where we'd think about our day
[37:47] and our time
[37:49] thinking about us but reading about that
[37:51] or it says
[37:53] true faith
[37:57] also sarah herself
[38:01] receives strength now you know what that
[38:04] means in the whole point
[38:06] she was turned back young would not only
[38:08] turn back young
[38:09] but she had to be turned back to her
[38:12] that
[38:12] you know she could have children because
[38:14] she couldn't have anything to start with
[38:16] all right so i kind of believe that
[38:18] after a little while
[38:22] maybe sarah's getting the idea
[38:30] you know how long has it took us to get
[38:33] the idea
[38:36] where do you hear it in this message
[38:38] taught about that we
[38:40] not just have to have the word we must
[38:44] become the word
[38:46] you know that we must be the word
[38:51] amen so about the time that sarah
[39:00] it's a change
[39:03] and she's young and if you'll read your
[39:07] scripture it's
[39:08] it'll tell you in there that first off
[39:10] they're dealing with a year
[39:12] i meant to bring that if you read your
[39:15] scripture you'll find out their first
[39:17] dealing with a year
[39:18] in other words like within one year
[39:21] so it's not a set thing it's like in one
[39:25] year
[39:25] read your bible all right
[39:29] i'd like for you to read why he said he
[39:31] was reading today and
[39:33] and found out that nehemiah was talking
[39:36] about
[39:36] how abraham got abram got his name
[39:39] changed abraham
[39:42] well i like for you to get to read in a
[39:45] little bit
[39:48] so it gives kind of a year's basis
[39:52] but then one day
[39:56] a personal contact comes and says
[39:59] within the time of life brother brown
[40:02] said
[40:03] 28 days you realize
[40:07] she could have been turned back to a
[40:08] young woman
[40:11] abraham gets up in the morning and looks
[40:13] over there and he says
[40:14] what savior's going to be mad at this
[40:17] because i'm in the bed with a
[40:18] strange woman
[40:22] he stumbles around and he walks over and
[40:25] there's a
[40:27] piece of something he can look at
[40:32] he said i can pretty well understand how
[40:34] she got in here but how did i get in
[40:35] here young
[40:36] you know i mean i'm wound up being young
[40:39] now
[40:42] but you know even though they were
[40:44] turned back young
[40:46] that's why it says she received strength
[40:49] see she was brought back to her
[40:51] position but her position was childish
[40:58] when she had that first monthly thing
[41:04] i imagine sarah begins to believe don't
[41:06] you
[41:10] he said
[41:16] god made a promise but did you notice
[41:19] what she said
[41:24] conceived seed and was delivered of a
[41:27] child
[41:29] when she was past age because she
[41:33] judged him faithful who made
[41:40] the promise
[41:49] you know what she finally caught on
[41:54] all right you know what god doesn't
[41:56] write a thing about her unbelief and her
[41:58] doubting and her thing
[42:00] no more than he did he didn't write
[42:02] about abraham
[42:04] because he's looking past and you know
[42:06] what
[42:07] he don't write it about you and i
[42:12] he don't write our downfalls and our
[42:14] problems and our doubtings
[42:19] he looks to see whether we can believe
[42:21] the promise
[42:23] now do you understand what i'm aiming at
[42:26] this age is promised the seed
[42:30] of the entire word to be made manifest
[42:33] in this age do we believe it
[42:39] amen or is that just a good story
[42:44] do we actually believe that god's going
[42:47] to bring it to pies
[42:52] i hope we're through they're trying to
[42:54] deal with god or trying to get him to do
[42:55] it this way
[42:56] or trying to get hay guards involved
[42:58] trying to get all kind of things
[43:02] and we can get down to looking at what
[43:04] we are
[43:05] in our day
[43:09] remember those in the bible that mounted
[43:12] to anything
[43:13] those in the ages coming down the
[43:14] mountain to anything was the people
[43:17] that believed the promise of god amen
[43:21] they believed the revelation come from
[43:24] god amen
[43:27] can you actually say that you believe
[43:32] what the prophet says on season on there
[43:34] with a shock
[43:36] when he brings it down from hagar and a
[43:40] doubt and says that's luther
[43:42] he brings it to wesley and the the
[43:45] the pollen you know or what you call it
[43:47] the coming forth and he brings it to
[43:49] mary
[43:50] as representing pentecost
[43:54] he said but a seed ain't come yet
[44:03] you want a little bit at least you can
[44:05] cover for seed you say but
[44:07] all the scripture is fulfilled just
[44:09] remember
[44:11] your prophet on spoken word is the
[44:13] original seed
[44:16] he gets down to telling the story of
[44:18] what i'm talking about
[44:22] and he thinks malachi 4 has already been
[44:24] fulfilled
[44:26] he thinks the seals had done been
[44:27] priests because he preached them
[44:29] you know one service yeah but he
[44:32] preached it
[44:34] and he gets over in there and he says
[44:38] lord what am i going to do
[44:41] i've got them out on a limb where do i
[44:43] go
[44:46] we see the great one to come forth the
[44:48] last is
[44:50] azusa street pentecost
[44:55] and said there's mary that the word is
[44:58] in her
[45:00] but he says where do i go and remember
[45:04] what he says
[45:07] he says as of yet the holy spirit spoke
[45:10] through the prophet
[45:10] he wrote it down that as of yet malachi
[45:13] 4
[45:14] is not fulfilled
[45:18] about a prophet that thinks that he's
[45:20] already preached the entire word
[45:25] and yet god says malachi 4 is not
[45:28] fulfilled
[45:29] he knew that was the seed of malachi 4.
[45:32] so what was he to do
[45:35] go to planting that seed
[45:39] maybe even thinking as he would say
[45:41] sometime if i'm not him
[45:43] somebody's coming
[45:48] let me be the one to lay the foundation
[45:53] right he was a human being
[45:57] but then he begins to realize because he
[46:00] goes right through the message
[46:01] and i wish you would take
[46:05] that message of the spoken word original
[46:08] seed
[46:08] and do something sometime when you get a
[46:10] chance reading
[46:12] and look at what the lord told him
[46:17] pick up your pen and write
[46:21] and go back to page one and start over
[46:24] again
[46:24] and see if that's not exactly what he
[46:27] had already done
[46:36] god picks up right where he started in
[46:38] the message
[46:39] read it sometimes come on
[46:43] he starts right in where the prophet is
[46:45] bringing his message
[46:46] as to what this is to be this is to be
[46:48] this says but as of yet
[46:50] malachi 4 is not fulfilled
[46:55] well there was a seed that had not been
[46:57] planted
[46:58] there was a word that had not been made
[47:00] manifest
[47:02] and there was a group of people that had
[47:04] not come on the earth
[47:07] in the time to manifest that
[47:12] but you and i are that people
[47:17] i want to take my journey
[47:21] and put it with the journey of sarah
[47:24] see that i've had doubts and
[47:26] frustrations
[47:28] and problems how about you
[47:36] but yet in the end sarah
[47:40] saw that the promise that he made with
[47:45] abram when he come out of the land of
[47:47] her childish
[47:48] and just met him a little while later
[47:49] then and she says
[47:52] you know what
[47:55] i'm going to give birth to the baby that
[47:58] he got
[48:00] the promise of 40 years ago
[48:04] or something how long it was before then
[48:07] i'm going to give birth to that promise
[48:15] i think it's about time for you and i to
[48:18] realize that
[48:22] we didn't make the book we didn't write
[48:25] the story if you understand what i'm
[48:27] got written down here remember sarah had
[48:30] a journey also
[48:32] and without sarah then abraham
[48:35] could not have had the child
[48:41] because god had already said it was
[48:43] going to come through he just didn't
[48:45] tell them
[48:48] he's already told who this is coming
[48:51] through
[48:54] so sarah through faith
[48:57] instead of just by faith
[49:02] she took a journey
[49:06] god knew the promise genesis 17
[49:10] verse 19 where he promises it to come
[49:14] through sarah
[49:17] so the promise was to
[49:20] sarah no
[49:23] no no no now the promise was abraham
[49:27] he can't get it done without sarah
[49:33] no he could go get him two or three more
[49:35] wives finally he'd get one
[49:39] oh no
[49:43] no god's predestinated plan before the
[49:48] foundation of the world
[49:49] that sarah was going to have that child
[49:53] and there was no way to change it
[49:57] god's promise there's going to be an end
[49:59] time bride
[50:00] that will be the word made flesh and he
[50:03] can't change that
[50:06] because he's already said it you say
[50:08] work through the prophet
[50:12] he said she'd be the fullness of the
[50:13] godhead bodily right
[50:17] come on then where are we at
[50:24] see god looked down
[50:27] now follow me
[50:31] god looked down in the life of sarah
[50:36] and was following her just like he was
[50:38] following abraham
[50:45] abraham's got problems sarah's got
[50:47] problems
[50:48] god don't have no problems
[50:52] right he knew what he was going to do
[50:57] it couldn't have happened but hagar
[50:58] could have married 14 other women
[51:00] and they don't but there's no type for
[51:02] him so there's no place to put him so he
[51:03] didn't have him
[51:06] polygamy was illegal in that day
[51:12] but god looked down and saw the problems
[51:16] of abraham and sarah
[51:17] but once he writes of them in hebrews 11
[51:20] he
[51:20] mentions nothing about their problems
[51:34] right
[51:36] and you mean to tell me
[51:39] that we think hebrews 11 40 says that
[51:43] they without us cannot be made perfect
[51:52] what are we doing
[51:58] but abraham he gives sarah away two
[52:02] times
[52:05] god keeps it from it we were discussing
[52:08] this with a
[52:09] brother the other day and i hope don and
[52:12] him will take it to him because i'll
[52:13] give these scriptures where
[52:14] he can do it and this brother was
[52:17] talking about
[52:18] abraham and sarah and he said yes said
[52:22] nursera what said she went into that man
[52:24] and become his wife
[52:26] i said huh couldn't have touched it
[52:31] couldn't have touched him
[52:35] there was no way if abraham were to give
[52:39] sarah away every other day
[52:41] there was no way that they could have
[52:44] touched her
[52:45] now you know what i mean right
[52:49] because the promise was made
[52:53] god was protecting
[52:57] we talk about that he was protecting
[52:59] sarah in the basis that she was
[53:01] abraham's wife and that's true
[53:06] but he was protecting his promise
[53:14] you know let's think about sarah a
[53:16] little bit
[53:19] go ahead with number three
[53:23] and just make sure you get these
[53:26] scriptures
[53:28] so that you'll understand abraham give
[53:31] his wife away twice
[53:37] first time
[53:42] he goes to egypt
[53:48] gives his wife away down in egypt
[53:58] he deals with his wife and said tell
[54:00] them that you're my sister
[54:04] wrote it on that
[54:08] look brother was reading this and she
[54:12] was taken into pharaoh's house
[54:14] that's true
[54:18] that's true she was taken into pharaoh's
[54:19] house but he didn't touch her
[54:22] uh-uh keep reading
[54:26] why says thou she is my sister so i
[54:29] might have taken her
[54:31] to me to wife
[54:36] your scripture is plain and give that to
[54:38] the brother
[54:39] see i might have taken her
[54:42] to be my wife god protected
[54:47] her you say oh no god
[54:51] no abraham and his lying
[54:54] was covering his neck
[54:58] right god was protecting
[55:04] sarah
[55:08] told that king it's a good thing you've
[55:11] done what you've done
[55:12] you remember what brother random said on
[55:14] marriage and divorce he said it was a
[55:16] law even among the heather and
[55:19] that you didn't take a man's wife
[55:23] to be your wife because he said that was
[55:26] a law even among heathers
[55:31] so here in this scripture he's in egypt
[55:33] now go to the next one remember now the
[55:35] scripture
[55:36] genesis 12. he's going to egypt
[55:41] pharaoh genesis 20.
[55:45] an abram journey friends toward the
[55:47] south country and dwelt between
[55:49] cades and sir and journeyed in koran
[55:52] and abraham said to his wife she is my
[55:55] sister
[55:56] instead of his wife and emily's king of
[55:59] girl went and took sarah
[56:02] but he never lived with her no
[56:06] read the rest of his scripture but
[56:09] brought it back down but abraham
[56:12] ambulatch
[56:13] had not come nearer to her and he said
[56:15] lord will god slay also a righteous
[56:18] nation
[56:20] give him those two scriptures brother
[56:23] jesus two times
[56:27] but two times god
[56:30] is protecting his promise
[56:36] are you with me
[56:39] he's not going to let that king touch
[56:41] her even though she's a beautiful woman
[56:43] and if you'll check it which i did one
[56:46] time and kept running it back till i
[56:47] found it
[56:49] sarah was 65 years old when they went
[56:52] down into egypt the first time that he
[56:53] gave her away
[56:54] she must have been a beautiful woman
[56:59] he said well they lived longer back then
[57:01] well you got a point but that's
[57:04] till the point is she was up close to 65
[57:07] years old
[57:07] because calculate your time when you're
[57:09] coming over for
[57:11] or that you're going with hagar coming
[57:13] forth and how old
[57:14] abraham was and the thing you'll find
[57:17] she was about 65 years old
[57:19] when he gave her away the first time but
[57:21] the second time
[57:22] he gave her away after she had been
[57:25] turned back to a young woman
[57:28] and abraham had been turned back to a
[57:30] young man
[57:36] abraham has many contacts with god
[57:39] personal
[57:40] meets melchizedek all kinds of things
[57:45] but yet he's got a little problem
[57:49] you know what he's human right
[57:56] you know god don't look at us as human
[57:58] too much
[58:07] we should never make a promise to him
[58:08] that we don't intend to keep
[58:12] but just remember if he made a promise
[58:14] to you
[58:15] you can't get out of the promise
[58:21] are you telling me that i'm telling you
[58:24] you show it to me in the bible and i see
[58:26] it
[58:30] if he makes a promise to you you're
[58:32] going to come to that place
[58:39] he said brother dale how do you feel
[58:42] standing today
[58:43] in the first sermon you preached in 1969
[58:46] was it the bride of jesus christ
[58:48] would be the son of man
[58:51] the word made flesh i feel great
[58:57] i've been through a lot of doubt and
[58:59] there's been a lot of thomas
[59:00] in the way i don't know about you i'm
[59:03] just honest enough to admit it
[59:06] had a lot of problems a lot of heart
[59:08] aches and troubles
[59:11] but he's never failed to keep his
[59:16] promise
[59:18] he won't fail on that
[59:22] even though you may have doubts
[59:24] frustrations
[59:27] you know you ought to sometimes take the
[59:29] life of hagar
[59:31] and you remember when she's run off and
[59:33] still these say run things
[59:35] you know god finds her under a tree
[59:41] you know god's still dealing with hagar
[59:43] you know why
[59:44] because she represents justification
[59:50] come on are you listening she had a
[59:53] representation
[59:55] and he's taking care of her
[59:58] and taking care of his word because he
[1:00:00] said ishmael
[1:00:02] will be a great nation many kings shall
[1:00:05] come forth
[1:00:06] from him and he's going to keep his
[1:00:09] promise
[1:00:12] right think about it
[1:00:19] because of the promise sarah come
[1:00:22] through
[1:00:24] and brought forth the child
[1:00:35] see my point is that sarah
[1:00:39] became a believer in the promise
[1:00:43] that god made to abraham
[1:00:47] but you know what by making it to
[1:00:50] abraham
[1:00:51] he made the promise to her
[1:01:01] he just finally tells them well you know
[1:01:05] i think church is about time we believe
[1:01:07] this prophet's message
[1:01:13] quit looking at her ups and downs and
[1:01:15] problems and heartaches and troubles
[1:01:20] and get down to business
[1:01:25] number seven if you can jump over that
[1:01:27] face
[1:01:30] every who's running it paragraph 168
[1:01:33] through 171
[1:01:35] number seven in your notes hey they're
[1:01:38] getting better on it and i wrote it up
[1:01:41] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:01:42] and forever
[1:01:44] look so has sarah typed
[1:01:48] church today called out out of sodom
[1:01:53] with a waiting promise of a coming son
[1:02:01] sarah is the type of you and i
[1:02:07] but just remember sarah threw faith
[1:02:12] she finally achieved
[1:02:15] what maybe some others that were super
[1:02:18] duper by faith abel
[1:02:20] by faith this one by faith that one but
[1:02:22] you know after a while
[1:02:24] sarah catches on that there's a journey
[1:02:26] going on and she's part of the journey
[1:02:29] and that god is going to use her
[1:02:36] i think it's about time you and i caught
[1:02:38] on to that church
[1:02:43] and you know what now go back to what it
[1:02:45] said
[1:02:47] if the promise was promised to come
[1:02:49] through sarah
[1:02:50] then there's no way that abraham could
[1:02:53] have
[1:02:53] died and went on or any problem because
[1:02:56] you had to have him because in him and
[1:02:58] her
[1:02:58] that's verse 12 counted the promise you
[1:03:01] know
[1:03:02] see time together put them together put
[1:03:04] abraham and sarah together in verse 12.
[1:03:08] it talks about him what
[1:03:14] the promised seed
[1:03:20] brother branham says
[1:03:23] sarah looked and saw
[1:03:30] she saw it the promise
[1:03:37] fulfilled
[1:03:41] you know what that means there's going
[1:03:42] to be a bride in the end time
[1:03:44] that was represent that that was
[1:03:47] representative
[1:03:49] and then there is no form no
[1:03:53] placing it other than with the the seeds
[1:03:56] not able to shuck in the prophet's
[1:03:57] message
[1:03:58] because you'd wind up with a zeus street
[1:04:00] representing mary
[1:04:02] and you stop there
[1:04:06] and you hear the wonderful preaching of
[1:04:08] the preachers of this message
[1:04:11] i'm not throwing off on it i said
[1:04:14] wonderful
[1:04:15] and they talk of luther wesley and
[1:04:17] pentecost
[1:04:19] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:04:22] of the holy ghost
[1:04:23] and it's beautiful
[1:04:26] but how many of you ever heard really
[1:04:29] tell you
[1:04:35] the real truth and brought it down to
[1:04:39] where we're at
[1:04:44] and to see there's got to be another
[1:04:45] step after
[1:04:47] the baptism of the holy ghost because
[1:04:48] you've got to have the
[1:04:50] holy ghost himself the prophet said
[1:04:52] coming down
[1:04:55] upon the people the word is going to be
[1:04:58] made flesh
[1:05:00] well like i said while ago we take one
[1:05:02] side okay the word's going to be made
[1:05:04] flat
[1:05:04] let's find out all he said don't do and
[1:05:06] we won't do it
[1:05:09] that would be your own
[1:05:10] self-righteousness
[1:05:12] let's find all he said do and we'll try
[1:05:14] to do that that wouldn't take it
[1:05:16] anywhere
[1:05:20] i'm going to make a bold statement so
[1:05:22] swallow good
[1:05:23] i'd rather follow the life of sarah
[1:05:28] and see that yet in the doubts and the
[1:05:31] problems and heartaches
[1:05:35] she came forth as a believer
[1:05:38] in the promise
[1:05:43] same promise part of it right it said no
[1:05:46] it's gonna rain same promise that enoch
[1:05:50] you can walk off the earth
[1:05:52] same promise that said abel offer blood
[1:05:55] it's all
[1:05:56] still in the same journey
[1:06:00] the journey of a christian
[1:06:05] and to find our journey and what our day
[1:06:08] is
[1:06:12] to not just part of the word come forth
[1:06:16] but the word to be made manifest in our
[1:06:19] day
[1:06:22] well brother dale all you talk about is
[1:06:23] word word word well now you tell me what
[1:06:25] to talk about
[1:06:29] i mean if it ain't talking about the
[1:06:30] word what are you talking about
[1:06:36] but yet people shout over the stories
[1:06:39] and the things and wind up with mary
[1:06:41] having the word within her and finally
[1:06:44] giving birth
[1:06:46] right mary gave birth to the word right
[1:06:55] but remember the word
[1:06:59] is what we're talking about the seed
[1:07:05] it shall not be air
[1:07:08] with the shock
[1:07:15] all of that's got to die and fall away
[1:07:19] and we're going to come forth as the
[1:07:22] bride of jesus christ
[1:07:24] that's it even though we have a lot of
[1:07:27] faults and failures
[1:07:28] and a lot of troubles and problems
[1:07:33] but god didn't make the promise
[1:07:37] to me of salvation
[1:07:42] if i would be good
[1:07:45] he didn't tell me that
[1:07:51] he told me that he'd already paid the
[1:07:54] price
[1:07:58] well why can't i be like sarah
[1:08:02] through faith
[1:08:06] walk in the journey and be what god
[1:08:09] wants me to be
[1:08:14] take one step at a time
[1:08:17] don't take a big long run you're gonna
[1:08:19] fall and get hurt
[1:08:21] don't try to figure it all out just walk
[1:08:23] a step at a time
[1:08:28] follow the blueprint
[1:08:32] right and just walk into it
[1:08:43] god wasn't looking at the life in a
[1:08:45] sacral no more than he was
[1:08:47] wasn't looking at the life of abraham
[1:08:50] he wasn't looking at none of their
[1:08:52] unbelief he never recorded it
[1:08:56] he didn't record it in the new testament
[1:08:57] abraham gave his wife away twice
[1:09:00] he didn't record that he had this doubt
[1:09:01] in that doubt now he said he's staggered
[1:09:04] not
[1:09:09] god don't look at your problems and my
[1:09:11] problems
[1:09:12] we are the ones that look at the
[1:09:14] problems
[1:09:18] why don't we just give them to him come
[1:09:19] on brother
[1:09:21] why don't we just give him our problems
[1:09:24] and say lord
[1:09:27] if i'm going to be a sarah i'm going to
[1:09:29] have a lot of problems
[1:09:31] maybe a little doubt along the way maybe
[1:09:35] not a lot of understanding but
[1:09:38] i'll just do what i can
[1:09:41] and walk as i can
[1:09:46] because it's a journey
[1:09:49] each day is a journey
[1:09:54] we can make it a wonderful one or we can
[1:09:55] make it a problem
[1:10:00] see just believe what do we got brother
[1:10:02] 596
[1:10:06] let's stand together
[1:10:26] i feel the poor
[1:10:43] what page number
[1:10:46] what page
[1:11:23] and my mind
[1:11:38] is
[1:11:45] it must be
[1:12:02] i hear the call
[1:12:08] i know his fear is moving me
[1:12:13] to give my all
[1:12:18] he speaks to me
[1:12:30] lord please come and take control
[1:12:45] and i begin to cry
[1:12:52] and my mind just fails to know
[1:12:57] exactly why
[1:13:02] i
[1:13:13] it must be god hearing my soul
[1:13:18] you ever do that at night you ever wake
[1:13:21] up in the middle of the night and just
[1:13:25] think about it
[1:13:29] and just lay there and pray
[1:13:42] then i can walk into it
[1:13:55] just come and take control please
[1:14:03] and think about what he's saying i went
[1:14:07] to hear the word
[1:14:10] and with my
[1:14:17] he was drawing me
[1:14:21] to live a higher
[1:14:38] i know for sure
[1:14:54] deeper
[1:15:07] we don't think about the contact
[1:15:22] abraham
[1:15:26] what do you think
[1:15:46] to give my all
[1:15:55] father we depend upon you because you're
[1:15:57] the only one
[1:15:59] and now you come on the scene and
[1:16:00] manifest yourself
[1:16:02] can we just lay this into your hands
[1:16:07] knowing that you will make it manifest
[1:16:10] for us because you promised it and we
[1:16:13] believe you
[1:16:15] in jesus name
[1:16:19] anybody else
[1:16:24] think about it
[1:16:56] he needs you to come on the scene into
[1:16:58] his heart and life to quicken them
[1:17:14] you'll see the word opening to it
[1:17:18] and you'll see the hour that we're
[1:17:19] living in the times of what's going on
[1:17:23] we condemn us any spirit that would be
[1:17:25] in any hindrance
[1:17:27] of trying to get our brother trying to
[1:17:29] come to this place of faith
[1:17:32] to see his own self in thy word because
[1:17:35] that's what we desire
[1:17:36] in jesus name
[1:17:45] what about it there's
[1:17:58] a deep call to the deep
[1:18:02] like a great magnitude
[1:18:07] i know for sure that i'll reach the goal
[1:18:26] in the name of jesus christ our sisters
