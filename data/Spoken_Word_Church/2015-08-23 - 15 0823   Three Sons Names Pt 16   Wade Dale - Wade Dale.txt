TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we got we got not starting down here oh I have kind of figured out a little bit now to deal with kind of work on this thing right there so let's see if we pull for close-up I'm going to read you some clothes the profit now I looked up the other day because I wanted I want to make sure you understand I'm not just saying that Jesus was the son of God to the church agent whether Brown said it several times so let's see I gotta figure out how to get back to this dumb here we go i've been i've been playing a little building community alright so this is 1965 large events made clear by prophecy now remember if i see that we're going to review a little bit but once it's remember he comes in three sons name he came first in the nameless on a man Jesus when he come on earth all right he never called himself to some God all right so Peter did not tell him who it was I who the son of man was he going to lose another god was he missed that revelation you know that see he came in the Son of Man profit jehovah himself to father called you're my soul man prophet of the son of man now he comes after the bed penticoff he came back in the form of the Holy Ghost supernatural now he's some guy Curtis right now he saw God he's not son of man I'm sure now he is now to us but through the church age he was what and for my holy go day of Pentecost that's when the turkey has begun right he come back in the form of the Holy Ghost supernatural spirit now he's son of god in the Millennium he'll be so David said on the throne of David art so you see where he's going to all right now let's go back read the next one proving his word the proper God said then he served his office & Son of Man service office son man then he served his office now I saw God God is the spirit and when now he served through the church ages as son of god so there's your son of God revelation on this rock Peter I'll build my church whatnot revelation so mad revelation the Sun God God in spirit form and the Holy Ghost coming back on the believer now in the Millennium he'll be son of David losing teeth Boeing Field he'll be the heir to the throne some of David's oh man some God something David and it's the same man all the time alright so it's not a different person but it's the same man all the time now let's go to proving his worth you just keep saying again that's the same thing he served his office now son of God God's the spirit and when now he served through the church ages as some guy nights least he's that he's and he's put a lot of the Son of God no one had to settle man revelation when Jesus Christ left this earth he took that revelation with them of the Sun lamp yet the seals he took that revelation winning he was the headstone the hex know what was rejected but when he was a projected at left all right because even Peter I mean even Paul writing in the old town New Testament he never mentioned much about the son of man all right let's read this if the church will come through justification do Luthor sanctification wesley driven baptism of the holy ghost and the Pentecostal then go right on into the perfection of the son of man all right so who was perfect Jesus Christ my brother Ron Spencer said the other night I really enjoyed that he said he said when he come before Pilate he said the devil was standing right there and he said when Pilate said I find no fault with you the devil if he would have anything against Jesus neither brought it up right there no earthly pilot he was focusing pilot and felt there was nothing all right so he's the perfect one all right but look through the profession into the profession of the Son of Man now it's not the son of man goes into profession right you and I go into perfection the Son of Man is perfected all right all right I'll and profane son of man took the body change the son of man is in the glorified condition he's the only man that was born of a woman okay who you talked to you can say any for whatever they don't Matt Barber one ever come to this earth live died rose and now he's worth my buddy right nobody nobody there's no one he didn't even do that Lodge didn't do that and then Jesus Christ Yolo was born a woman lived on earth is a man died hmm died rose up again now sure Hey look Lazarus born of a woman lived his life died rose again died got it all these people have been raised from the dead even the runarounds ministry I'm sure that wolf was think about the other than little boy in felon that was raised from the day absolutely America but you know what probably 70 years later he died and his body is still his body is still laying in the ground somewhere Jesus there's only one ft 10 what the Bible says only one empty tomb the only one that's reach a more immortality that means you were more one time and now you're in more see angels are just immoral they're not even really a more vigorous dieter could they're created creatures into eternity they never work more along they became in more they stay the same but there's only one that became what see we're mortal now we die like I said the other day we plant them in corruption raise them in incorruption all right Jesus died in corruption it was heading toward corruption right he wasn't corrupted but it was heading toward corruption it was beginning to break down but God raised him up because he did wouldn't suffer my Holy One to see corruption right when he raised him up glorified condition there's only one person in a glorified body right Jesus Christ no one else because he had to conquer that that's our scrap done that's right sí allí doing them they didn't conquer bad there and I really all right it's damned her brother Graham didn't understand much he just knows one thing for sure that that's why Elijah not too man Elijah but a lot just coming to the Jews listen the Jews no man brother Brown would have walked over there and showed them that side of them aside and knew they would have perceived that he was that Elijah the rapture would have took place and the Jews would have went home and I heard 44,000 we've been left all dead and all but that's not the way the Bible said that's why brother Graham couldn't go over that he can show that sound on sun because their eyes are still blinded my brother Dale we've been talking about but everybody understands so far some man some God so David just keep reading a few more because I want you to really should really see this I want to the unveiling of guard now read that the good one to read if you want to understand Oh throughout here very got 68 he can't pursue the Prophet know what he just explained what the Prophet was subtle man is the profit that's why I Ezekiel that's why I'm Jeremiah he say son of man problems not son of man props up son of man is a prophet all right now he came versus the Prophet they crucified his own crucified he came as the son of man then after the Holy Spirit came he was then the son of God God is a spirit he was the Holy Spirit some God he lived through the church ages a son of God alright but now remember what he keeps going went wrong he keeps going now in the Millennium he'll be so today they said on the small of his father David he's son David he says he's assigned David now not now that's when he was explaining when he was a son of David Wright and remember between the Son of God in the lab see interchange and put him out alright i'm standing at the door knock and they put him out they put him out and in Luke he said he would be revealed again and subtle and the Prophet fulfilling the rest of it that's why a lot of people call brother brown ones Deeks on a man because he was the problem he was the property that had signs of what so man hat but he wasn't these other men who was a son of men revealing the true prophet that was here the skechers type perfectly together shuttle and son of god son David what was it saying all the time just changes form in market he came a son a man the Prophet done exactly he was that woman and all her sin she recognized him he should we know the Messiah's coming when she called the Christ that's what he'll did you recognize okay okay then we got do I him for the Reformers they include the Wesleyan all down through them then we find out that they got it sold bundled up just like the Israelites did so when he does appear in the last days now he's don't like the first coming israel became so bundled up in their cribs and dogmas and ideas to Jesus they rejected but same thing that that's why brother around haggling diet this generation for the second crucifixion Jesus Christ they crucified not him they crucified the effects of the word all right till when he does appear in the last days in the Pentecost ways as the Holy Spirit they rejected it they did the same thing is we did and what does he do now return that son of man so in between writing between because brother God says three sons name course we know that he was son gone before everything started alright but he said son of man that's when Jesus come in for names came here son of man Sun God through the church agencytoday but brother branham is showing us now and later on in his ministry he understood what was going on and he put right in at the end time because that was his message right to restore all things that allowed you remember how to restore all things not just all things okay bring the head back that's what the Son of Man is doing now the Son of Man ministry is that ministry that no one understood Jesus for that three and a half years sure they got born again they got healing they got all the great things signs and wonders even the only of the word to a degree right Luther have a opening of the word for the great lastly had open the work to the Pentecostal time though they were degree but they were trying to tear him now now the headstones not print area hey stone not trapped Aaron the ex-cons not a false doctrine now you can have a little bit of false doctrine coming up here you sure you can that's wild at the head had to come that's why that everybody from here downs got to go by the grain because they can't get this thing out of the way they can't overcome this thing right here this is the problem Jesus overcame this thing right here son of man overcame because he was one he was God Almighty human flesh well what you and I got to realize that we are the same thing in portion as he was in the folder you know what's that we are in a portion we have to be the same spoon of ocean water chemicals what is that you say well you know you give us a little art and you put it under a microscope or you do kill him for work good you said have salt magnesium you said well this had to come from the ocean these are your chemicals these are your chemical Jesus had all these chemicals in its fullness he didn't have to battle over this heat he called you his friend and use done turn him in you know no malice no no no anger he's a lawyer no he wasn't angry he never lady he got mad at you down he never was angry right but he had the bonus of this this is our character we become up for a long time it is also our minimal this identifies where we come from your phone call you pour it in there you go that's got some fluid in it I didn't come from the ocean I come from the sewage pit all right but you put a little chlorine brother Browns the chlorine they glow chlorine and clean you up don't you put that red in that chlorine and it just does away with it same thing with our sins and the blood of Jesus Christ just doesn't alright so that's there's your chemical if you want to know what part if you want to know where you come from there's your genetic makeup right there same thing with a spoonful so we got to have these these have to be working in our life before that comes everybody goes well we understand the seals that we don't understand Daniel sending weeks and some of that end of the period or the teaching of the statute perfect plan well they got it reverse no they just think they know what they're coming all they're doing is quoting what's allowed see it right now true revelation but you got to start here and go up to there and you got to have the Holy Ghost ceiling you in then he brings you the word always bringing the word all up do hair they brought on the word i'll do seven church ages but right at the end time to forward that eli go back to Matthews everything daddy Lyons to come and restore hollow all things what back to that three and a half of your son of man ministry okay what I've been thinking about Peter exactly I wonder exactly working soon he thought Jesus was I mean when he said thou art the Christ the store thought that's what we didn't have the revelation of man well no one thing here to help holy ghost at that time that's why he said flesh and blood that reveal to you what is flesh and blood none of my inspiration blood he's a flesh-and-blood have revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven in other words in other words it was what was inside they can understand he was different they even called him the Creator they knew that creator lived in that lamb but they could not connect that that was the flesh of God I don't think they would have told him it said you're the flesh of God now let's see your son of God what would be another form coming down Peter Peter said let's make greet our apples look at the devil the devil is into everything he was on that mountain with him he said let's make a Trinitarian doctrine out of this program right here three Peter Jesus kept telling Peter get behind me Satan can you say was talking to Peter and give me one don't you think God knew exactly where the devil will happen the whole time computer said let's make three Tabernacles but brother let me tell you something when Jesus told Peter said after your converting strengthen the Brethren in other words after your converted you're gonna have a different doctrine then you got right now and now you can strengthen the brother I don't even want you to talk about nobody that's one so I hope those can't really help you know they talk about stuff they don't have if they don't have the life in size they can't give it to somebody else right the seal out has to come to the body and then that's why I believe we got a lot of preachers in this message and yes I'm don't say it on the internet we got a lot of preachers in this message it's not morning in it free to message me they you know they get a good outline and make a good speech but and if they're not born again absolutely their ship their followers are not going to be born yet don't remember you can't go any faster that's right that's why you get a lot of false doctrine also all right let me get one more there are people around did on the 1815 says the Lord your God to raise a prophet like it under me and so that scripture cannot be broken he had to come in son of man alright so that's the prophet now that was for his age when he was here on her not a man right then excuse me then when he died rose ascended and sitting back the holy spirit that was the Sun God God and they speared him through the church ages it's been good some God everybody got that same n ma'am so there he is he is he was the son of man on earth when he died he resurrected and came back on the day of Pentecost when Peter was filled with the Holy Ghost that was the son of God speaking I called the son of man in heaven what did what did Phillip say not a man standing on right hand of God what he see some jesus he saw a man is his spirit he saw the man all right the end of millennium it's not a David but that's what in the end time folks that's what that's what our I hold purpose we missed the whole purpose of being here the whole purpose of being here is to reveal some way well now this is the statue of a perfect man brother ground reads God having providing some everything for us Hebrews 11 40 that day without us shall not be made perfect you get it these people who died in here I believe he's showing right here are waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection so who resurrected so I God don't need a resurrection all right so a man needs to be resurrected out of the grave the Son of God never died the son of man and I right son of God King died but the son of man in the form he was living in at the time he was flesh and that flesh died so that's why he died some man rode son of God coming back now run around in it he said well he he rose he was in flesh listen brother branham's putting all that together one he's not coming to 40 or 50 days and he just walked on the earth he stopped because remember that was really honestly nothing went on during that Jesus would have here come they go fishing they never really understood I mean they never close what's in them you know finally realized who he was after a little one but that 40 or 50 days they really nothing happened but right there at the end when he ascended he ascended for a purpose he ascended for a purpose to come back remember the Angels Daniels were standing this in this same Jesus samjeeza till you see go up in this cloud today is going to come right back down in the sand cloud that's the Sun man being risen again because remember I've always said when Brennan random and dining us us we were better than he had died of us hi babe right because we killed Jesus Christ now we killed youth across that putting my great so the son of man had to be risen again from the dead there's Matthew 17 made fulfill when he was risen again do what not a person a message it was a message not a person it was draw a person he had to come through a prophet khurana brother Graham says a son of man revealing this other man they said a man revealingly son man revealing what those seven seals are seven unknown Thunder that would what put the head and body together oh Jesus has had a body off through seven churches the body of Christ but remember they never had headship like we have this now they never understood headship you can't have on hex yet less you understand who he loves if Jesus was to ask me now who do you say that I the Son of Man I like that it I could I could in my own way you understand me I could at least make it a little excited you know I really hate I could because of the revelation that we've had open but now Luther if he asked Luke or the same thing as Peter he would tell the same thing Peter said now work the Christ you are Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God that's all the revelation beeping okay so you set your aperture Caroline when some people want to perfection through these were trees weekend when you do that up to a certain point because perfection still have to come to us thats related well you have to be ready ok you have to make the bride has made herself ready for the head in the body of your night now if you come to adoption the head and body is already you know brother Brad with the head and the body was already United when brother animals here this headstone came down that's what happened to that cloud out in Arizona that's why I believe happened this same Jesus who you saw go up in a cloud he's going to come back in a cloud now wait a minute the Bible says I am rob said that's not that clever because he's going to come back in a mystery right right the mystery of the seven seals the mystery of the Seven Thunder he's coming back in a mystery they going to miss that one well I had a guy tell me one time he said I can't wait to look Eastern's gospel you know the Bible says the sky lid opening that's why all the graves of turn with the headstone for DS you know that check every grades don't in the world that believe in Christianity the headstones turned four days because that's where he's supposed to come and the resurrection come come he don't come out the east eastern gates Jerusalem you look all these headstone no I him any grave you see there everyone turned unless it's just some awesome but they're all term for these so they believe that's what's going to help the rhetoric I guess I lost my call coco milk cloud a cloud so the clown had to come from the West but remember what did they tell him they didn't he didn't get the revelation out with they said go back east that's where the Sun rises in need he's basically I've had people tell me oh he got the revelation out there he said three or four times he said they didn't all they don't told me to go back these and it would be revealed to you and then even during the seals he said I was sitting in a room that mission woods and all them sitting in the neighbors steady and he came in giving the revelation of the sea I mean he kept telling me every day every day then they want to get you know there's a piece of something that they want to really got Arizona they want to give him his dinner something where they know the seven seals will reveal East yes as the type shown that he come he's resurrecting again brother branham went back out east dude you're gentle simbel to what to resurrect Jesus again and not informed I've been in Revelation he come back alleys gave us the revelation and guess what when Jesus raised nobody understood it right forty days Peter's going fishing they're going over here that I mean I like you I'm telling you if if Danny was to die and I see him preach his funeral they closed that casket they put him in the grave in three days later he comes up north tonight you will know fishing tomorrow now look I wouldn't say no but I think I'll go walmart I'd be breathing the same air he breathing I wouldn't because the revelation that I have now now they didn't have a revelation he appeared to him and they're like oh because I wake up I didn't go back work right yeah ways that 500 brethren stall him and only 120 later in the upper room I will simone de libras in there didn't have to see him alive and it had seemed I haven't seen foot integrate right right him him come back in there as well whoa lookie program after the sealed open everybody rejected he preached the thousands before 63 he preached to 20 in a trailer I preached the rapture message in the trailer out Arizona for 25 or 30 people after he preached the resurrection the greatest message the seals the greats message they'll hit ever since Jesus Christ and people rejected worse than than than male and he said he said that I'll be rejected what what Jesus demand but listen it didn't stop what he died though the continuation of the revelation was actually for me and you today because if you're reading questions and answers he says going through you what stay in your revelation stay in your revelation you're under that old Pentecostal late you stay this is all you got to understand that's really what he was telling this is all you're going to understand and you're ending up lunch down a lot of it but you're born again ma would you like not but the ones are going to catch this that's not going to hold them anymore he's already died already raised raised already went to all that so what we're doing is we're walking right into the change so let's go we'll finish this next something get better man you got a question jittery around here I just like I'm do the other
