[2:38] okay all right Simon Peter a servant
[2:41] Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that
[2:43] have obtained light precious Faith with
[2:46] us through the righteousness of God and
[2:47] through our Savior Jesus Christ Grace
[2:50] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[2:51] the knowledge of God and of Jesus our
[2:54] lord according as his divine power hath
[2:57] given unto us all things that pertaineth
[2:59] unto life and godliness through the
[3:01] knowledge of him that has called us to
[3:02] glory and virtue now see that's a call
[3:04] he's called us to something so this is a
[3:08] call he calls you to the new
[3:11] birth right but then he didn't quit
[3:14] calling you that's when he just began to
[3:16] speak to you like he really wanted to
[3:19] cuz he can't speak to you like he wants
[3:22] to while you're in the world because
[3:23] we're going to see right here this quote
[3:25] here where brother Brandon says see the
[3:27] world we've escaped that now
[3:30] he's addressing this to the
[3:32] church so he's not addressing it to the
[3:34] outside people he's addressing it to the
[3:36] church all right or the bride but see
[3:40] you can say church and not be not be
[3:42] misled because He is wanting the church
[3:45] to see this but we as
[3:48] individuals have to grow up that statue
[3:50] of a perfect man all right so
[3:57] now that's um the street no that's our
[4:01] new Sunday school time for Sunday school
[4:03] oh
[4:04] Lord where's it coming from there's one
[4:07] on top of the free in there all right to
[4:10] cut the
[4:12] cord this thing when's it supposed to go
[4:14] off supposed to give me a warning Bell
[4:16] right 15 till right at 10 and then 15
[4:19] after for the young ones for them to go
[4:21] out okay all
[4:22] right whereby are
[4:25] given gifts unto us exceeding great and
[4:29] precious promises that by these Prophet
[4:32] said these promises you might be
[4:34] partakers of the divine nature having
[4:37] escape the corruption that is in the
[4:39] world through lust all right and besides
[4:43] this given all
[4:44] diligence add to your faith
[4:49] virtue and to Virtue
[4:53] knowledge and to knowledge Temperance
[4:56] and to Temperance patience and to
[4:58] patience God less and to Godliness
[5:01] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[5:03] kindness charity so does everybody see
[5:06] that it's it's seven
[5:09] ads faith is not an ad right right right
[5:14] faith is something you've obtained he
[5:16] said you've obtained this Faith all
[5:19] right Faith you've obtained this Faith
[5:22] then you got seven f 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 cuz
[5:26] you got to get charity in there you
[5:27] can't say 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven cuz you
[5:30] leave that one out so you add to your
[5:33] faith in other words what you
[5:35] believe add to what you believe virtue
[5:39] and to what you believe knowledge and to
[5:41] what you believe Temperance all right
[5:43] cuz we're Waring
[5:45] against the corruption that is in the
[5:47] world through lust so we're still Waring
[5:49] against that like I said you say well
[5:51] brother Brandon will say a little bit
[5:53] later on we'll not read it today but in
[5:54] the message he'll say oh I just got so
[5:57] so you're telling me I got to have faith
[5:58] I'll just have Faith No it's a birth
[6:01] it's something that is not and then is
[6:05] right okay you understand what I mean
[6:07] like the cow that was just calf that was
[6:09] just born it was not yesterday that's
[6:12] right it was there working you couldn't
[6:14] see it though with your natural life but
[6:16] now through a process it has been
[6:17] birthed so there's something
[6:19] new that's why they call it a new birth
[6:22] not an old birth made over it's a new
[6:25] birth totally different than your first
[6:27] birth all right so and when these
[6:29] virtues of birth is something totally
[6:31] different virtue is something totally
[6:33] different than what a man that would
[6:34] just give you everything he had or or
[6:37] and there's a lot of people like people
[6:39] like Warren Buffett and and um and um
[6:42] what's the other guy's name Microsoft
[6:44] guy Bill
[6:47] Gates they have virtue because people
[6:49] drew strength off of what they said and
[6:51] they become multi-billionaires but that
[6:54] ain't got one thing to do with God if
[6:55] they're not born again they're
[6:57] lost so being successful doesn't mean a
[7:00] thing that's right like brother Matthew
[7:02] was speaking last night it really
[7:04] doesn't mean a thing if you're wealthy
[7:07] right it's like brother bandam said said
[7:10] he said well well well God must be with
[7:11] me because it's a sunny day or God must
[7:13] be with me cuz cuz I'm prosperous he
[7:16] said that don't mean one thing he said
[7:18] you ought to realize God's with you in
[7:19] the prosperous and the days that you
[7:21] think he's not with you right he's there
[7:24] more like brother Matthew was talking
[7:25] about last night and that was really
[7:27] wonderful what that was 45 minutes of of
[7:30] of good preaching and about us as being
[7:34] the clay and the Potter doing the doing
[7:37] the work you know and it's true why
[7:40] would why would you not use a mason or
[7:42] or a steel worker well they use other
[7:45] tools to make what they make a Potter
[7:48] uses nothing but this right
[7:50] here there's no even before back in the
[7:54] 2,000 years before Christ when they
[7:56] first started making Pottery they make
[7:58] it the same way you walk walk across the
[7:59] street at my house and walk over across
[8:01] the street to that Pottery Shop they
[8:03] make pottery the same way it's just an
[8:06] electric wheel the other one they had
[8:08] was a wheel theyd spin with their foot
[8:10] they used to have and they used to have
[8:11] the one where they spin it with their
[8:13] foot and then they went into an
[8:14] electrical belt one about probably 72
[8:17] when I started working over there and
[8:19] you can control it by your knee that and
[8:21] it would it would slow it down and speed
[8:23] it up but um that's why God used
[8:26] pottering the clay instead of an iron
[8:28] worker or a or a brick mason all right
[8:30] but he does use brick masons in
[8:32] allegories and steel workers in
[8:33] allegories but something personal to me
[8:36] and you he uses clay Potter and Clay cuz
[8:38] that's what we are we're clay and he's
[8:40] the Potter well see even then the
[8:43] analogy that that brother Matthew was
[8:45] bringing
[8:46] yesterday he puts it on the wheel and
[8:49] you got to be balanced you got to be in
[8:51] the center of the wheel of
[8:53] God will of God you got to be Center in
[8:57] the will of God all right wobbles and it
[9:00] does they'll have to take and tear it
[9:01] off and start over again cuz that
[9:03] thing's got to be perfect for you to
[9:05] mold the pots I've watched them do it
[9:06] hundreds of times a lot of my cousins
[9:08] are into that stuff so they make I mean
[9:09] just make a beautiful pot just out of
[9:11] their fingers and their hands so we've
[9:16] got that analogy to work with but let's
[9:20] work with it
[9:21] here and see he's he's put you on the
[9:24] wheel down here cuz when you throw that
[9:27] pot down and that or when you throw that
[9:29] clay down it's not a Pott it's a hunk of
[9:31] clay about this big they measure it out
[9:34] they weigh it they measure it out and
[9:36] when they throw that thing on the wheel
[9:38] guess what it's real wide it's real wide
[9:41] down
[9:43] here it's real wide down here but when
[9:47] he they start molding that thing they
[9:49] can either make a small skinny tall jar
[9:52] or they can make a wide jar but they
[9:53] have to put their hand down
[9:55] inside to do the molding not a lot done
[9:59] on the
[10:01] outside until it's done on the inside
[10:04] once it's done on the inside then you
[10:06] start working on the flowery
[10:08] arrangements and the handles and all
[10:09] that stuff on the that's what God's
[10:11] doing
[10:12] here and this statue of perfect man
[10:14] God's already put you on the wheel
[10:17] okay at Faith he's getting ready to use
[10:20] you and he can't use you when you're out
[10:22] there in the in the muuk in the mire but
[10:25] when he throws you on that wheel he's
[10:27] got a purpose and that purpose is to
[10:30] mold you and make you into his image and
[10:33] this is the image this is the stature of
[10:36] a perfect man but if you'll notice some
[10:39] of the pictures that and I don't think
[10:40] we have one but it's got Christ standing
[10:44] here with his head here but that's what
[10:45] it is it's this it's the actual divine
[10:48] nature of almighty God it's what Jesus
[10:50] portrayed when he was here on
[10:53] Earth how else are we going to know
[10:55] that's right we just going to say well
[10:57] try you got to have the divine nature of
[10:58] God
[11:00] okay you got to show me what it is right
[11:04] you got to show me how to get there cuz
[11:06] I ain't there been there before right
[11:09] but Christ had been there before he grew
[11:12] up grew to an adult and he knew how to
[11:15] go up that thing because he grew the
[11:17] Bible says he
[11:19] grew in Grace and
[11:23] knowledge God yeah in human flesh he
[11:26] absolutely did that's right cuz he was
[11:28] born in this Satan's Eden not
[11:31] sinful wasn't born in sin but when he
[11:34] came into this world all the attributes
[11:38] of Satan's
[11:39] Eden was bombarding
[11:42] him right but his flesh was old getting
[11:45] old his flesh wasn't it come from God
[11:48] that's right listen his flesh came from
[11:51] God but once he hit this Dimension MH
[11:55] once he hit Satan's
[11:56] Eden he was in Satan's domain now Satan
[11:59] didn't have dominion over him but now
[12:01] see Satan had dominion over us the Bible
[12:02] says that's right that Satan had
[12:04] dominion over us until Christ came the
[12:08] law the law had Dominion right until
[12:11] Christ comes all right so that's what
[12:13] happened when you're when you're
[12:15] naturally born you're born into Satan's
[12:17] Eden well well Jesus Christ the same way
[12:19] almighty God flesh of God spirit of God
[12:21] soul of God but once he come out of that
[12:23] womb he come into this part of nature
[12:27] not his nature mhm his nature was divine
[12:30] right but not part of this I mean not
[12:32] born like we were right so he didn't
[12:34] need a new birth right he was born
[12:36] already the right way that's right
[12:38] spoken word okay but he still was
[12:43] bombarded Satan didn't have a problem
[12:46] talking to the man in human flesh he
[12:48] really don't have a problem talking with
[12:50] him in theophany you understand I mean
[12:52] he's talked to the he's talked to the
[12:54] devil longer than he's talked to me and
[12:55] you that's right or he's allowed the
[12:58] devil to talk to him longer than we've
[13:00] been able to talk to God right right cuz
[13:02] he created him first that's right he was
[13:05] God's right hand man when God started
[13:07] creating he created Satan first then he
[13:09] created everything else up in the
[13:11] Heavenly but see then when we drop down
[13:13] here on Earth when Jesus dropped down
[13:14] here on Earth he had to grow in Grace
[13:16] and knowledge the Bible said he was
[13:17] perfected right by the things that he
[13:21] suffered right being made perfect by the
[13:23] things he suffered Jesus Christ yeah
[13:25] because he had a human he had a human
[13:28] brain
[13:29] he had a brain that's the same as yours
[13:32] he had to be your brother he couldn't be
[13:34] born some Supernatural sure his birth
[13:36] was Supernatural but when he come forth
[13:39] from the womb he was just like us that's
[13:41] right he had to go to the bathroom he
[13:43] had to eat now there was things he could
[13:45] control that we can't control but re but
[13:47] really brother Brown said he could have
[13:49] children he could have a family well
[13:51] then he was capable of
[13:53] Ling like you love I mean you understand
[13:56] what I'm saying he was capable of loving
[13:57] a wife that's what brother Brown said he
[14:00] could have had a wife that's right but
[14:01] he didn't what did he do he took and
[14:03] said I sanctify myself that's right but
[14:06] he knew that we weren't going to be able
[14:08] to do that that's right cuz we were born
[14:11] in this when he come into this world and
[14:12] started growing up I believe he looked
[14:14] around and said they have no hope except
[14:19] me I just really think he realized that
[14:21] when he got up into his 20s and up in in
[14:23] his later years I really realized he
[14:25] looked around and said these people have
[14:28] zero hope about me and that wasn't
[14:32] making nothing big of itself but what
[14:34] was inside of him was trying to get out
[14:36] right right that's what was inside of
[14:38] him that's why he had to die to release
[14:40] the life he had the eternal life in his
[14:43] body or in his soul right that's right
[14:47] and it was just like a capsule just like
[14:49] a just like a pill that you take right
[14:51] that's Co that's coated with a with a
[14:54] capsule right what's inside does you
[14:57] good that's right but you got to put it
[14:59] in an environment for it to come out
[15:01] that's right right before it'll do you
[15:03] any good so that's what was happening
[15:04] with Jesus Christ he had to be our
[15:06] brother so he had to come in the capsule
[15:08] mhm human flesh he had to come in that
[15:10] capsule tempted tried tired weary got a
[15:13] little ill one time i' say he probably
[15:16] got a little ill a few other times but
[15:18] that one was recorded right okay I just
[15:20] really do I think he just got ill with
[15:22] people well hey he walked into the
[15:24] Pharisees and he said he didn't say oh
[15:27] you bunch of hypocrites no the Bible
[15:29] said he said you Hypocrites Snakes in
[15:32] the Grass
[15:33] vipers be kind of bad if a man walked in
[15:35] a church today and start calling all of
[15:37] us
[15:38] that you'd probably get a little mad at
[15:43] him right come on well that's what
[15:49] happened did that holy
[15:52] God before he became flesh did he have
[15:55] to come into flesh to really understand
[15:58] understand I think he did I think God
[16:02] knows all things right but he really
[16:05] wants this Dimension drop down from
[16:07] because remember he could commune with
[16:09] Adam I know it's a little off our
[16:11] subject but it is on faith the found we
[16:12] got to get a good foundation here before
[16:14] we start up this thing all right but I
[16:17] believe that that God knows all things
[16:21] yes understands all things but he had to
[16:24] be a Kinsman he had to do it down here
[16:29] that's right he could not do it up there
[16:31] that's right right he had to do it down
[16:33] here right see all this all this stuff
[16:36] that we need and I say stuff lightly all
[16:38] these things that we need are not for
[16:41] him they're for us right they're for us
[16:45] but he had to because remember in the
[16:47] mind of God he was slain before the
[16:49] foundation of the world that gave
[16:51] coverage for everything you understand
[16:54] what I'm saying that gave coverage for
[16:55] Even Adam before Jesus died or even
[16:58] Abraham or or Sarah they're all under
[17:00] that before the foundation of the world
[17:02] he was stood as a l stood as a lamb
[17:04] slain he wasn't physically
[17:07] slain he had to come down here I've
[17:09] always told you one day you're going to
[17:11] realize this that I'm not just saying
[17:12] this cuz it's a a wayd quote but God is
[17:16] not having to prove to no one but
[17:19] Satan that he can live in a human body
[17:22] and that he can do exactly what he
[17:24] purposed Adam to do in the garden so
[17:27] really say is one that he's cuz out
[17:30] mouth of two or three Witnesses God in
[17:33] you God in Me God in you are going to
[17:37] prove to the devil how many times
[17:38] brother rown said that going to prove to
[17:40] the devil that this eve won't fall
[17:42] that's
[17:43] righten the Holy Ghost is a real timid
[17:47] brother Bram said he was real honorable
[17:49] and real Meek because if you don't want
[17:52] him around you'll go out here for a
[17:54] little while right okay same way with
[17:58] the Devil he's a gentleman even to Satan
[18:00] he's a gentleman the Holy Ghost is
[18:03] saying Hey listen folks does God have to
[18:06] prove anything no no he's God that's
[18:08] right right it's kind of like Dave
[18:10] Ramsey said said we think we're
[18:11] something and and God needs us well you
[18:13] know all he's got to do is snap his
[18:15] fingers or even think that you're dead
[18:17] and you're dead there's nothing anybody
[18:19] can do about it but what about a god
[18:22] though that limits
[18:23] itself knowing that there's no way we
[18:25] can understand him down here but he
[18:28] wants us back up to where he was at
[18:30] where we were with cuz see Adam and God
[18:32] talk face to face right there was no
[18:34] problem with just like me and sister wom
[18:36] we we can talk face to face cuz there's
[18:37] nothing between us right but now if they
[18:40] become something between
[18:42] us Adam says I fear I fear see God wants
[18:46] back to that Fellowship well he can't
[18:48] now because everything's dropped down
[18:50] into this
[18:51] Dimension and that blood had to be a
[18:54] covering before the foundation of the
[18:56] world but a but a person had to
[18:58] literally come down here though and shed
[19:00] that blood that's
[19:02] right because remember brother R said it
[19:05] was a thought
[19:06] first word
[19:09] manifestation so God thought of all this
[19:11] in his mind and this then he just
[19:13] manifested so that's the way it is with
[19:15] God and before the foundation of world
[19:17] he knew he was going to have to
[19:19] die but to
[19:22] allow
[19:24] Satan to prove who he
[19:26] was see we're
[19:29] proving that greater is he that's in us
[19:31] than he that's in the world that's right
[19:33] we're pro who's proving that does God
[19:34] have to prove that he's greater than the
[19:36] devil no can the Potter say to the clay
[19:40] no or can the clay say to the Potter why
[19:42] did you make me this way no Satan's the
[19:45] same way cuz he he's got to look to God
[19:47] and say God you're the Creator you're
[19:48] the one that created me but what Satan
[19:50] done he wanted to raise himself above
[19:52] God thinking hey I've got this power
[19:54] I've got this might I've got these
[19:57] things and I'm going to just go over
[19:59] here and make myself a separate Kingdom
[20:01] well now remember God's still God that's
[20:03] right he don't share his glory with
[20:05] nobody right he's still God right he's
[20:08] still the one that made this so he can
[20:10] do whatever he wants to with it he can
[20:12] destroy it but God Lives by his own law
[20:14] that's right that's right brother Dale
[20:16] remember him preaching on God limiting
[20:18] himself he limited himself because of
[20:21] the word but he limited himself because
[20:23] of me and
[20:24] you we can't understand why God lets
[20:27] these things happen we can't understand
[20:29] why God lets certain people die and
[20:31] certain people live and that's not for
[20:32] us to to question or sure humanly we can
[20:35] have question but once we start up this
[20:38] statue of a perfect man I don't want us
[20:39] to be questioning God why have you not
[20:41] given me this and then turn that thing
[20:44] around and say God give me
[20:45] this and then there'll be no
[20:48] question okay I want to be where we can
[20:51] see virtue working in our life okay okay
[20:54] okay where people want to talk to you
[20:57] where they want to draw strength where
[20:58] if somebody has a problem pick up the
[21:02] phone I'm not going to call a
[21:07] drunk about my spiritual life
[21:10] right right why there's no virtue there
[21:14] that I can draw from now I've got the
[21:16] Holy Ghost somebody else has got the
[21:18] Holy Ghost we can draw virtue off of
[21:19] each other but if you got the Holy Ghost
[21:21] and somebody else doesn't have the Holy
[21:23] Ghost sure you might be able to listen
[21:26] to some uh
[21:28] common things of Life June's father has
[21:31] a lot of wisdom as far as life lessons
[21:33] and doing business and stuff he's a he's
[21:35] a he's a highly intelligent man as far
[21:37] as just not school work smart but he's
[21:40] just an intelligent man he's made a good
[21:42] living off of doing things right but he
[21:46] thinks that's his
[21:48] salvation but see he's never he doesn't
[21:51] even know about I tried to talk to him
[21:53] about scripture about 10 years ago and
[21:54] he said well I don't know about that I
[21:56] don't know about that I said have you
[21:57] ever read the Bible he said yeah yeah
[21:58] when I was younger well he's almost he's
[22:00] 80 he'll be 80 this year and I told him
[22:04] that time that day I said I said Jean I
[22:06] said I'll I said I will listen to what
[22:09] you have to say about life
[22:11] lesson I said but when you come and
[22:13] start talking to me about God and what
[22:15] God's going to do and what God's going I
[22:16] said you don't have a clue you don't
[22:18] know what God's mind is until you get
[22:20] into his word that's this is his mind
[22:22] right here so I'll listen to somebody
[22:25] that's got good that's got good
[22:26] knowledge about things but that's that's
[22:28] just human that's right that's just
[22:30] human life that's right like Dave Ramsey
[22:32] people I don't know if he's born again
[22:33] or not that's up to him and God but he
[22:35] does have some good life lessons he does
[22:37] apply it to scripture so I listen to
[22:39] that but now as far as me going to him
[22:42] for something of my
[22:44] salvation I don't know that he's got the
[22:46] new
[22:47] bir but see I know brother Bob does so
[22:50] if I'm in trouble whatever pick up the
[22:53] phone call Brother Bob pray brother Bob
[22:56] because we got a connection
[22:58] we got the same daddy that's right we're
[23:00] at least we're in the same family right
[23:03] now he may not like to hunt or fish or
[23:05] but that don't matter right
[23:09] yet you become a preacher you either got
[23:11] to play the guitar your wife's got to
[23:14] sing and play the piano or you got to
[23:16] hunting fish so you got the fishing part
[23:18] now so you got to get in that hunting
[23:19] stuff man to be a real message believer
[23:22] babe message preacher you got to do
[23:25] that but see how we do all we stigmatize
[23:28] stuff and we think man this this guy's
[23:29] got to do this to be a no you
[23:31] know feed me the word of God I'll tell
[23:34] you whether he's born again or not right
[23:36] watch his life that's what I mean about
[23:38] this is life this is still life lessons
[23:40] that's right but it's the Life of Christ
[23:43] trying to trying I said trying cuz we
[23:45] can hinder him trying to work its way
[23:48] out yes cuz it's all in there Faith virt
[23:52] knowledge add to your faith well it's
[23:54] not that we're going to take and and you
[23:57] finish with this yeah you will be in a
[24:02] second all this coffee that's in this
[24:04] cup see this is coffee this is the Holy
[24:06] Ghost what's good in the
[24:08] morning good but look all that you need
[24:12] is in there that's all coffee right M
[24:16] all right now there's a little bit in
[24:18] this
[24:19] cup it's the same
[24:22] substance faith is a substance of things
[24:24] hope for okay there's some there's some
[24:25] coffee in the bottom of that but there's
[24:27] not a lot of coffee in there but it is
[24:29] coffee doesn't matter how much more I
[24:31] pour in there it's still coffee it's
[24:33] just more of it right got it it's just
[24:36] more of it that's right virtue right
[24:39] knowledge right Temperance right
[24:43] patience Godly this and ready to drink
[24:45] it out of this
[24:48] cup this is your cup you don't
[24:56] need
[24:59] thank you Father that you H this from
[25:01] the
[25:03] wild but you see that it's it's it's
[25:06] it's the same coffee it's the same Holy
[25:09] Ghost God just wants to add more but you
[25:11] know what if if if I was pouring that
[25:13] for sister Gwen and she goes no
[25:16] I'm I'm fine I'm full yeah I'm full I'm
[25:19] fine I don't want anymore yeah then you
[25:22] know what God will do timid Holy Ghost
[25:25] he'll just say okay that's all you got
[25:27] that's all you're getting that's true
[25:29] you're going to struggle and you we
[25:30] going to all struggle anyway but you're
[25:31] going to struggle worse cuz you need
[25:33] virtue you need knowledge you need
[25:34] Temperance you need patience right but
[25:37] when you say
[25:38] God fill my cup Lord that's right fill
[25:42] it up that's what it is see you got the
[25:44] cup the
[25:46] Potter this is what Pottery looks like
[25:48] when you finish with it but it's a real
[25:50] it's like a glob when it started you
[25:52] don't you don't look very
[25:54] good right you're going to stumble in
[25:56] you look just like a regular piece of of
[25:57] clay that somebody threw out in the yard
[26:00] but once that man takes that clay puts
[26:03] it on a wheel changes the environment
[26:06] hello changes its nature puts it on the
[26:09] wheel then he'll form this and then
[26:12] what's he going to do he's going to fill
[26:14] it remember remember the analogy brother
[26:17] Ram said about the bottle he picks the
[26:19] bottle up it's dirty well you don't want
[26:20] to put anything in when it's dirty
[26:22] justification sanctification he cleans
[26:24] it up puts it aside for service but not
[26:27] in service
[26:29] but what's he looking toward I'm looking
[26:31] to F this thing that I found this pearl
[26:35] of great price this precious thing I
[26:36] found in the field remember the
[26:38] scripture found these things in the
[26:40] field well what is it God found you out
[26:42] in the field of the world brought you in
[26:45] and made you a
[26:47] cup made you a cup then he want he
[26:51] doesn't want now what's a cup
[26:53] for fill it up a cup to just leave empty
[26:57] somewhere and just no a cups to be used
[27:00] when you're
[27:02] thirsty fill it up put some liquid in it
[27:07] you might even could put some cough
[27:08] medicine or something you know it's used
[27:10] for many different things but unless
[27:11] it's a cup you can't use it got to be a
[27:15] cup first yes ma'am so reason I said
[27:19] ma'am I forgot your name sister mil all
[27:22] right go ahead so you know like how
[27:24] you're pouring bit by bit and somebody
[27:26] says you know don't want just you know
[27:29] they stop right they still have that new
[27:32] birth but they're not
[27:34] absolutely and they get all the way
[27:37] that's when they can take that Rapture
[27:38] that's cor you won't take a body change
[27:41] with this much with this you can see it
[27:43] with that much coffee in your
[27:46] cup okay you have rapturing faith the
[27:50] Holy Ghost is rapturing Faith okay
[27:52] everybody understand that it's not that
[27:54] it's not that we're going to Rapture
[27:55] enough of us to get our head out that's
[27:57] Catholicism and and Purgatory no if
[28:00] you've got if you've got coffee in the
[28:02] cup guess what you got coffee in the
[28:04] cup you can drink whatever even if it's
[28:06] a little
[28:08] bit I mean man you be hot outside and
[28:11] even a little bit of water is good but a
[28:14] whole lot of water is better but a
[28:16] little bit of God of God a little bit of
[28:17] God will suffice it'll get you an a
[28:20] Rapture if you're here at Faith and
[28:22] you're born again you are in rapturing
[28:25] condition but you cannot
[28:29] take the change of the body you'll have
[28:30] to
[28:31] die before the Rapture takes place like
[28:35] dadd said many times you could die
[28:36] tomorrow and the Rapture take place the
[28:38] next day or you could die tomorrow at
[28:39] 9:00 and the Rapture takes place at
[28:42] 10:00 but you don't have enough you
[28:45] don't have enough faith in what you
[28:48] got do everybody understand that you got
[28:51] enough
[28:51] Faith you just don't it says add to your
[28:54] faith so it becomes
[28:56] personal so whose virtue is it it's
[28:58] yours whose knowledge is it it's yours
[29:00] not brother Dale right not mine that's
[29:04] right brother raay it's yours it says
[29:06] add to your faith virtue and and not
[29:11] adding to the word but but to your
[29:13] virtue knowledge cuz once you get it
[29:15] brother BR said and he uses this analogy
[29:18] and is so positive and so wonderful he
[29:20] said this is my eye God gave it to me
[29:23] well what what's he trying to say this
[29:25] is my Holy Ghost it was God's it was him
[29:30] it's him it was his at one time it
[29:33] wasn't mine wasn't in my possession but
[29:35] once he give it to me it's mine see my
[29:38] eye was in God's possession a long years
[29:40] millions of years ago in God's mind my
[29:42] eye was in his mind he knew I would have
[29:44] one but once he give it to me whose is
[29:48] it yours it's yours it's your eye so
[29:52] it's your Holy Ghost what you know what
[29:54] God's done he said
[29:56] here you do with it what you
[29:58] please and that's what he
[30:01] said he give you the Holy Ghost it's a
[30:04] gift right now gift with stipulations
[30:08] are okay but I like if a gift's a gift
[30:12] you just give it to if I'm going to give
[30:13] my kids $100 I'm not going to ask them
[30:14] to climb the roof or or you know cut the
[30:18] grass if it's a gift I'm saying if it's
[30:20] a gift if something for me and I'm
[30:21] giving them yeah but if it's a gift if
[30:23] I'm just saying here I'm giving you this
[30:25] see that's what God does he gives it
[30:26] with no
[30:28] stipulation cuz you can stop it at any
[30:30] time right but he wants you and gives
[30:34] you the coffee even though there's this
[30:36] much or this much it's still coffee this
[30:39] much of the Holy Ghost this much of the
[30:41] Holy Ghost what's going to happen is
[30:43] though that divine nature is going to
[30:45] work its way out and see then God's
[30:46] going to be able to use you more yes see
[30:50] he can use you at Faith but he wants to
[30:52] use you more he just doesn't want you to
[30:53] just come to church and be a message
[30:55] believer and be a Christian no he wants
[30:57] more he wants you to do
[31:00] more everybody okay with that cuz that's
[31:02] what really you got to
[31:05] believe that that's coffee
[31:08] right whether you ever taste
[31:11] it but the Bible says taste and
[31:14] see that the Lord is good once you keep
[31:17] tasting of it you're going to say man
[31:20] that's good that's right that's coffee
[31:23] I'm identifying what it is cuz what
[31:26] having the Holy Ghost you're just like a
[31:28] baby a babbling baby right you're going
[31:31] to fall you're going to stumble you
[31:33] going to you you're not going to know
[31:34] how to drive a car but up here you going
[31:37] to know how to drive a
[31:40] car Deanna Faith Dale has everything she
[31:44] needs to drive a car she's got her eyes
[31:46] she's got her ears she's got all of her
[31:49] faculty arms legs to drive the Machinery
[31:53] you understand yes but what is she
[31:56] lacking growth
[31:58] development she's a
[32:02] human she was born one right when you're
[32:06] born again you're born again at Faith a
[32:07] baby but you cannot drive God's car
[32:10] that's right okay you cannot drive God's
[32:13] car he's not going to allow you certain
[32:15] things you know why not because
[32:19] he is Larry he knows you are he's got
[32:24] faith in
[32:25] you you don't have faith in him enough
[32:29] Faith you understand what I'm saying to
[32:31] have that's why you add to your faith
[32:33] virtue add to your faith knowledge add
[32:36] to you keep adding from what you believe
[32:39] cuz if you don't believe in it can't
[32:42] have it that's true that's true this is
[32:44] a question that kind of pertains to the
[32:47] Saturday night if a person dies at Faith
[32:50] I mean not at Faith but a person who's
[32:52] Born Again dies say at Temperance when
[32:55] the Rapture happens will they have all
[32:57] of that I don't think so cuz I don't
[33:01] understand that but well the Bible says
[33:04] as a tree lenth brother Brown said if
[33:06] you're this here you're going to be that
[33:08] there it just changes your Dwelling
[33:10] Place death just changes your dwelling
[33:12] place cuz what are we going to and this
[33:15] is my we need to go this is my thought
[33:19] though if we're all listen listen real
[33:22] quick listen to me look at me don't look
[33:25] around look at me if I know
[33:31] everything if I know everything I'm
[33:34] right here okay just say this is I know
[33:36] everything now if 75 million other
[33:40] people know the same thing what we going
[33:42] to talk
[33:44] about we know the same
[33:48] thing it's going to be
[33:50] repetitious there's going to be people
[33:52] in heaven with different levels of
[33:54] understanding why do they put brother
[33:55] brandom up on a pedestal I thought we
[33:57] all supposed to be equal no no no they
[34:00] put him
[34:01] up and God said because of what you
[34:04] chose down here a great portion of
[34:06] Heaven awaits you now he never told me
[34:08] that he never told you that right but he
[34:11] told that man
[34:13] that so that's why that message of cheer
[34:15] down through the endless ages I believe
[34:17] it's going to be that we're all going to
[34:19] still be
[34:20] learning about God and think of the
[34:23] people outside the city there's going to
[34:26] be more people people outside the city
[34:27] folks than is inside the city cuz
[34:30] there's only going to be bride inside
[34:32] the city say if there's one in a million
[34:35] if there's a million inside there's a
[34:37] 100
[34:39] million outside the city just because of
[34:41] one
[34:42] person
[34:44] one or
[34:46] 100,000 say they may be cuz the city's
[34:50] only so big it's, 1500 square miles so
[34:53] God knows how many it's going to be in
[34:54] there 144,000 plus the bride and him
[34:58] right but outside that city is a whole
[35:00] big world this world's not going to be
[35:01] destroyed you're still going to have
[35:02] this whole big universe I mean this
[35:04] whole big world There's 7 billion people
[35:06] living here now they don't have really a
[35:09] population problem certain places but if
[35:12] you scattered everybody out you wasn't
[35:14] if you had a perfect Utopia where there
[35:16] was no
[35:17] desert there's a desert out there that
[35:19] people can't live in but what if
[35:20] remember the desert's going to Blossom
[35:22] like a Roose so people can inhabit that
[35:26] so they make be 10 billion people
[35:28] outside the
[35:30] city that we can walk out every day and
[35:33] they're not going to know nothing some
[35:35] of them yes they're not even going to
[35:37] know how they got there I mean sure
[35:39] they're going to be brought to a a
[35:41] realization that Christ was in this
[35:43] sister right here and this man was a
[35:46] drunk adulterer whoremonger didn't care
[35:48] about Jesus didn't even know about Jesus
[35:50] didn't even go to church but because he
[35:52] changed her Tire God's going to give her
[35:54] him eternal life now just true there's
[35:56] no way he can can be up here right see
[35:58] there's got to be there's got to be
[36:00] levels to where people come in and then
[36:02] you can go sit down and say hey let me
[36:05] tell you about this yeah thank you first
[36:07] but he's going to thank
[36:09] you I've always said my Lord have what a
[36:12] way to get in are those people going to
[36:15] be able to come into the city they can
[36:17] come in but they can't stay they come in
[36:18] and go out we can go anywhere we want to
[36:21] right but they can't reside in the city
[36:23] that's just like you comeing to my house
[36:25] like can just come visit you come visit
[36:26] and then go back to your home all right
[36:28] and that's the way it is in the city
[36:29] it's just going to be the bride just
[36:31] going to be 144,000 inside that City now
[36:34] you can come in the Bible said that
[36:35] Kings will come in take a Le go back out
[36:38] all right they can't stay there now why
[36:41] did it say
[36:42] Kings if there's not going to
[36:47] be levels there's got to be more
[36:49] advantages though than just where you
[36:51] reside inside or out oh sure but inside
[36:55] you're his bride
[36:57] you get special
[36:59] privileges sorry I just believe that
[37:02] that this the light's never going to go
[37:04] out inside that City but it may it may
[37:07] be it may be daylight and dark right the
[37:11] way the Sun goes I mean God's not going
[37:13] to change this whole universe he's
[37:16] already set it in motion the problem is
[37:18] the world's doing this because of the
[37:20] flood but once that baby sit straight
[37:22] back up it's just going to go around and
[37:25] around but I believe that have Darkness
[37:27] outside I I just do but now inside the
[37:29] Bible says the lamb is the light and
[37:31] it'll never go out so what she's saying
[37:34] is just because you die at Temperance
[37:37] that automatically you should go up is
[37:39] that she's asking that's what she do I
[37:42] think as you die that's the way you are
[37:44] CH brother B says that death only
[37:47] changes your dwelling place because does
[37:50] not raise you up or down he'll be theop
[37:53] all right let me ask you this if you die
[37:54] at Temperance can you be
[37:58] honey if you have faith you're going to
[37:59] be in a bride okay so they'll be we'll
[38:02] be just say we're right we're right and
[38:04] you die at Temperance she dies at
[38:06] knowledge I mean she can teach you
[38:09] knowledge but we'll be Perfection so how
[38:11] can that be no no will be complete you
[38:13] got to remember yeah Perfection is
[38:15] completeness yeah Adam Adam was in a
[38:18] perfect condition but he still was not
[38:22] in the perfectness of God because
[38:25] remember his youth was being renewed
[38:28] somewhere brother Brown said his body
[38:29] would have been made Eternal will we
[38:31] still add there there oh sure I believe
[38:34] so I believe we that's what I mean if
[38:36] everybody knows the same thing at the
[38:37] same time what you going to do sit
[38:39] around and go yeah I know that will you
[38:42] cut this conversation off right there
[38:44] we're going to be in the city though
[38:45] right yeah we can go outside right We R
[38:48] around we travel like even though we
[38:50] didn't go make the if you're look look
[38:54] look look if you're born again at Faith
[38:55] you have a free ticket to the city your
[38:59] bride right here even just baby fi even
