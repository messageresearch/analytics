[6:49] we love you all with the love of the
[6:50] lord
[6:52] and uh we just appreciate each and every
[6:54] one of you amen
[6:57] um
[6:59] we're going to go ahead and read the
[7:00] word this evening and
[7:03] so let's turn to philippians chapter
[7:05] four
[7:07] starting at verse four
[7:09] we want to continue on a little topic
[7:11] that we started last time called think
[7:13] on these things part two this will be
[7:16] part two of
[7:19] and um
[7:20] you know the more that i think on these
[7:22] things
[7:24] the more i realize how important it is
[7:28] because your your your thoughts amen um
[7:33] mold your actions
[7:36] yes
[7:37] your thinking
[7:39] molds the things you say
[7:42] amen
[7:44] and your the things you say
[7:46] mold other people as well
[7:49] it helps shape other people too
[7:52] so so
[7:55] the lord tells us you know
[7:57] let this mind of christ be in you
[7:59] amen
[8:01] and so it has to do with the mind it has
[8:03] to do with the mental has to do with
[8:05] with with with with your thoughts amen
[8:09] and even think about it even the world
[8:12] couldn't be here without it first being
[8:14] thought of first
[8:16] it had to be a thought
[8:18] and so if we're part of god amen
[8:21] and the holy spirit who is a thinker
[8:23] amen
[8:25] and whatever thought came to him amen
[8:27] whatever thought comes to god it's an
[8:29] eternal thought
[8:31] therefore when we read the word of god
[8:32] these are eternal words
[8:35] and when you
[8:36] think these things and you're constantly
[8:38] repeating these things and you're
[8:40] looking at these things amen and you're
[8:42] receiving those words amen they're
[8:44] creating life in you
[8:47] amen
[8:48] and you become part of that eternal
[8:51] because you're feeding on the eternal
[8:53] thoughts of god amen
[8:55] praise the lord jesus so let's read this
[8:57] philippians chapter four
[8:59] starting at verse four rejoice in the
[9:01] lord alway
[9:03] amen
[9:04] it doesn't say sometimes it says alway
[9:07] always rejoice in the lord well my bill
[9:09] is too high this month for electricity
[9:12] oh rejoice in the lord alway
[9:15] well gas price is uh my gas price bill
[9:18] my gas bill is last month it was the
[9:20] highest ever rejoice in the lord alway
[9:25] amen and and look what paul says and
[9:27] again
[9:28] and again i say rejoice oh you don't
[9:31] know what i'm going through brother
[9:33] luisa you just i'm going through
[9:35] something i don't understand
[9:37] yeah but god understands and he was the
[9:39] one who wrote this word
[9:41] and he just he told us rejoice in the
[9:43] lord alway
[9:45] and again i say rejoice
[9:47] remember when jesus said barely verily
[9:50] this is paul's verily verily
[9:53] he says it twice in the same sentence
[9:55] let your moderation be known unto all
[9:57] men the lord is at hand
[10:00] be careful for nothing in other words
[10:02] don't worry about anything but in
[10:04] everything by prayer in everything by
[10:06] prayer
[10:07] and supplication with thanksgiving
[10:10] let your requests be made known unto god
[10:14] and watch what happens when you do these
[10:16] things and the peace of god
[10:19] which passes all of your own
[10:21] understanding
[10:22] all of the understanding of the world
[10:24] all of the understanding
[10:26] natural understanding
[10:28] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[10:31] who through christ jesus
[10:34] and christ jesus is who the word
[10:37] right
[10:38] finally brethren
[10:40] paul says whatsoever things are true
[10:42] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[10:45] things are just
[10:46] whatsoever things are pure
[10:49] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[10:51] things are of good report
[10:54] if there be any virtue and if there be
[10:57] any praise
[10:58] think on these things
[11:00] those things which you have both learned
[11:02] and received and heard and seen in me
[11:06] do
[11:07] and the god of peace shall be with you
[11:09] amen so let's just borrow our heads this
[11:11] evening our heavenly father as we come
[11:13] before you once again we've opened back
[11:15] the pages of your word lord we've
[11:16] studied we've we've read we've done what
[11:19] we could lord humanly speaking father
[11:21] but now lord god it takes your holy
[11:23] spirit lord god to pull these words from
[11:26] the from from the book lord god and make
[11:28] him life to us lord jesus father god we
[11:31] ask for revelation lord god and lord
[11:33] jesus open back father god those things
[11:35] that we don't understand the things that
[11:37] my cloud father god are our our thinking
[11:40] lord god our process our thinking on you
[11:43] lord god just
[11:44] let us lay aside for just a little while
[11:46] lord god and let us concentrate on you
[11:49] lord jesus for you're the one that we
[11:51] desire lord and desire father god
[11:54] everything else might get in the way but
[11:56] lord god in our hearts lord we we we
[11:58] desire truth in the inward part lord as
[12:00] david said in psalms lord we love you we
[12:03] ask you these things now in the name of
[12:05] the lord jesus christ forgive us for our
[12:07] sins now and continue to be with these
[12:10] requests that were mentioned this
[12:11] evening we pray in jesus christ's name
[12:14] amen amen god bless you you may be
[12:16] seated
[12:18] amen now let's read if you want to turn
[12:20] with me to romans chapter 12
[12:22] and we'll read verse 1 and 2 there
[12:26] it says i beseech you therefore brethren
[12:28] by the mercies of god that you present
[12:30] your bodies
[12:32] a living sacrifice
[12:34] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[12:38] reasonable service
[12:40] and watch in verse 2 and be not
[12:42] conformed to this world
[12:45] why because the world has a certain
[12:46] mindset
[12:48] right the world has a certain a certain
[12:50] way that they that
[12:52] they go
[12:53] they have their own style they have
[12:55] their own idea and they have their own
[12:57] agendas and they have their own things
[12:59] that they think
[13:01] is is is is what's what's cool what's
[13:04] hip what's what's what's what's in
[13:07] and
[13:09] i'm knowing that everything that we have
[13:11] gotten from the time from the older one
[13:13] in here to the the most the youngest one
[13:16] things have changed since then
[13:20] the styles that you used to wear the the
[13:22] the the clothes that you used to wear
[13:25] maybe you don't wear anymore
[13:28] why because things change
[13:30] styles change
[13:32] the way people uh uh
[13:35] even their houses change
[13:37] the the way you you you you decorate
[13:40] your home changes all those things
[13:42] change
[13:44] now we see uh uh houses and they're
[13:46] pretty too i mean they're painting the
[13:48] houses now white and black
[13:50] you know it's it's a nice style it's
[13:52] pretty
[13:53] but
[13:54] five years down the road 10 years down
[13:56] the road it'll be something else
[13:57] because man is never satisfied with
[13:59] their own stuff
[14:01] oh my but the word of god is totally
[14:03] different for a christian amen
[14:05] it satisfies the soul
[14:07] and be not conformed to this world but
[14:09] be ye transformed
[14:11] by the renewing of your mind
[14:14] that's how we are transformed by having
[14:16] your mind renewed
[14:19] washed cleansed amen
[14:22] that ye may prove that it that that you
[14:24] may prove what is that good and
[14:26] acceptable and perfect will of god
[14:29] i like the way that that scripture says
[14:32] it in romans chapter there in romans 12
[14:34] in in the new living
[14:36] version it says don't copy the behavior
[14:39] and customs of the world
[14:41] but but let god transform you into a new
[14:44] person
[14:45] by changing the way you think so so god
[14:48] god will do his part when you do your
[14:50] part
[14:52] right
[14:52] god has given us his thoughts
[14:55] right so you start thinking his thoughts
[14:57] that's you changing the way you think
[15:00] therefore god can transform you amen he
[15:04] can only transform you through his word
[15:06] he's not going to give you something
[15:07] outside of his word
[15:09] amen so that's why we have to be subject
[15:12] to the word but let god transform you
[15:15] into a new person by changing the way
[15:18] you think
[15:19] then you will learn to know god's will
[15:21] for you which is good and pleasing and
[15:23] perfect amen
[15:26] so just as a as a as a as a
[15:29] as a review from last time
[15:32] um
[15:33] you know paul wouldn't have said this if
[15:36] if if our minds weren't already needed
[15:38] to be renewed you see
[15:40] we have to have our minds renewed day by
[15:43] day
[15:44] that's why it's so important for us to
[15:45] continue in the word
[15:47] to be steadfast reading praying
[15:50] meditating on god
[15:52] amen and anything else that would take
[15:54] the place of that amen is is trying to
[15:57] shift your thought process away from the
[15:59] word of god
[16:01] they might not be bad it might be it
[16:04] might be good it might be might be
[16:05] something that that's good but but
[16:08] if we keep our thoughts on god amen if
[16:10] we keep our mind set on god then he can
[16:13] renew our mind amen he can change our
[16:15] mind so so
[16:16] we need to have our minds renewed
[16:18] you know because sometimes sometimes
[16:21] when i think we don't but
[16:22] we do
[16:24] that's really when you do if you think
[16:25] that
[16:28] and and and so
[16:30] uh we talked about last time about our
[16:33] thoughts how they're transforming amen
[16:35] they're they're powerful
[16:37] thoughts are powerful amen
[16:39] and we don't take them as seriously as
[16:40] we should amen
[16:42] and we know that thoughts relate to
[16:44] words and and words are highly important
[16:47] amen
[16:48] you you take your husbands for example
[16:50] you say something a certain way to to
[16:53] your wife
[16:54] uh
[16:57] you better be careful
[16:58] [Laughter]
[17:00] you might mean something else but it's
[17:02] the way you said it or or or or the or
[17:05] the words that you chose
[17:07] amen
[17:08] you see
[17:10] but then you you choose a different type
[17:12] of word amen and it'll just cause her to
[17:14] just sweep her off her feet you see
[17:16] what's the one the the one that brother
[17:18] ernie used to always say about the
[17:20] something about the clock or something
[17:22] like that
[17:23] something you you're you your face your
[17:26] face makes time stand still
[17:32] yeah and be careful the way you say that
[17:34] and not what you mean
[17:37] something on that line
[17:39] better not go there
[17:41] sweetheart that wasn't for you
[17:45] all right and we know that brother
[17:46] branham said that a word is a thought
[17:48] expressed
[17:49] or in other words thoughts are are
[17:52] uh thoughts are
[17:54] are capsules or thought containers amen
[17:58] they're they're thought containers you
[18:00] see god had to think it first
[18:02] then it became word
[18:04] then it became then it became intuition
[18:07] amen everything that we that we touch
[18:09] everything that we look at everything
[18:11] that we see even you and me as we're
[18:13] looking at each other you were thoughts
[18:15] in god's mind
[18:17] all these things around us were thoughts
[18:19] in god's mind
[18:21] expressed
[18:22] and you're beautiful you're unique in
[18:24] your own way amen
[18:25] brother branham says in in in
[18:28] in in the message law or grace he says
[18:30] when god speaks it has to be so there's
[18:32] no way to at all to get away from it god
[18:35] says let there be and it has to be the
[18:37] very word itself and the word was a
[18:39] thought
[18:41] god went and then he says a word is an
[18:43] expression of a thought god thought it
[18:45] in his minds and then spoke it into
[18:47] existence
[18:48] see god can't think things and then and
[18:51] then just be thoughts
[18:56] they have to come to fruition they they
[18:58] have to they have to come something has
[19:01] to come out of those thoughts
[19:02] they can't just be thoughts in his mind
[19:05] it can't just be something they're head
[19:06] knowledge that's why god doesn't want us
[19:08] to just have head knowledge
[19:10] god didn't give us the word of god for
[19:12] just head knowledge
[19:14] no he gave us the word of god so that we
[19:16] could take those thoughts in amen
[19:18] process them and then put them into
[19:20] action
[19:21] manifest them bring something into
[19:23] manifestation
[19:25] it's not it's not about head knowledge
[19:28] it's about manifesting the word of god
[19:30] or the thought of god amen
[19:33] praise the lord so we know that god's
[19:35] thoughts that are revealed in his word
[19:37] and we see him through creation amen we
[19:40] we talked a little bit last week in or
[19:42] last time in regards to how uh the uh uh
[19:46] if god's thoughts bring life amen then
[19:50] we we see how
[19:52] the the the the society today is
[19:56] anti-life amen
[19:58] and we see it in different avenues amen
[20:00] through the lgbtq agendas we see it
[20:03] through abortion agendas we see it
[20:04] through all these different things amen
[20:06] and when you are involved in those
[20:08] different things or when you constantly
[20:10] ponder upon those things amen they do
[20:12] not bring life
[20:15] amen they they they
[20:17] we'll read some some staggering to
[20:19] statistics here
[20:23] uh
[20:24] that ever since the uh the the the
[20:27] pandemic
[20:29] how
[20:30] mental health
[20:32] has increased the the the
[20:34] the
[20:35] people's mental people people mentally
[20:37] are breaking down
[20:40] amen
[20:41] it's sad to see
[20:44] and you would think that you know all
[20:46] the push of the lgbtq and all of that
[20:49] amen would would be making people happy
[20:53] they're expressing their their their way
[20:55] of life the the what they feel inside
[20:58] they they're expressing it and you think
[21:00] that that would make them happy
[21:02] but
[21:03] the lgbtq community is the most
[21:06] depressed people
[21:08] it's statistics
[21:12] so because you know the word gay means
[21:14] happy
[21:16] so they're really not happy people
[21:19] and it's not the way that they're trying
[21:21] to portray it to you
[21:23] on tv and in the news
[21:25] now i want to make something clear from
[21:27] last time we are not we as christians we
[21:30] are not against we don't wrestle against
[21:32] flesh and blood
[21:34] no we don't wrestle against flesh and
[21:36] blood i i have nothing against
[21:39] personally against anybody individually
[21:42] that that that has that lifestyle or
[21:44] that chooses to live that way
[21:47] i will shake with my hand
[21:49] i will i will sit down and eat with them
[21:51] then i have no problem i have no qualm
[21:53] because hey that could be the
[21:55] opportunity for them to see the light of
[21:57] christ in my life
[21:59] amen
[22:01] but it but it's it's it's when they're
[22:03] it's it's when they're trying to make me
[22:08] like their lifestyle
[22:10] that is when it's wrong
[22:13] because i'm not trying to make them like
[22:15] my lifestyle
[22:17] right
[22:18] you can you can live you can be a
[22:20] christian and not even say anything just
[22:22] live the life of christ in front of
[22:23] people and they will be able to see
[22:26] amen christ in you and you wouldn't have
[22:28] said not one word
[22:30] amen there's true christians that way
[22:33] praise the lord
[22:35] but it's when you're forcing it upon
[22:37] people
[22:38] or when you're forcing it upon our kids
[22:41] in school
[22:42] that's when we have to we have to put
[22:44] the line down you don't force anything
[22:47] on anybody just like i can't push a
[22:49] cigarette in brother boyd's mouth
[22:51] you're going to smoke the cigarette
[22:54] no i can't do that
[22:56] amen
[22:57] but the problem is is that in the media
[23:00] and all these different avenues
[23:03] that's what they're trying to do
[23:06] and and it's happening in schools they
[23:08] are force feeding it on our kids they
[23:11] are force feeding it
[23:13] and that's when that's when it becomes
[23:15] wrong
[23:16] that's when it becomes wrong so i just
[23:18] want to make that clear i i have nothing
[23:20] against amen the people per se the
[23:23] individuals i i've had friends like that
[23:25] my wife she went to school with people
[23:27] like that bella's gone to school
[23:29] with people like that
[23:31] we don't we don't we don't hate them
[23:34] amen
[23:35] we just we just
[23:37] we we don't we we dislike their
[23:39] lifestyle
[23:40] amen but not them personally it's just
[23:43] like brother branham said we don't hate
[23:45] the people in the nomination or in
[23:47] organizations we hate the organization
[23:50] we hate that belief that belief system
[23:53] that that binds people that that that
[23:56] that that causes people to to not
[23:58] believe upon the whole word of god you
[24:00] see
[24:01] and and you know and you might be
[24:03] wondering why is brother luis up there
[24:04] talking about the lgbtq community and
[24:07] and all these different issues let me
[24:09] i'm just going to say that we our young
[24:11] people are facing these things
[24:14] you see and i just feel compelled that
[24:16] through i'm trying to compare the
[24:19] thoughts of god versus the thoughts of
[24:21] the world
[24:22] because our young people are so
[24:24] bombarded with the thoughts of the world
[24:26] if they don't have the holy ghost if
[24:28] they're not born again that's what
[24:29] they're going to be attracted
[24:30] to you know youtube influencers people
[24:34] that seem like they know what they're
[24:36] talking about on youtube and on all on
[24:38] tick tock and all these all these
[24:40] different avenues
[24:42] and so if you are not grounded in the
[24:45] word of god
[24:46] your thought process is just going to go
[24:48] anywhere
[24:49] and everywhere
[24:51] but but but we have an absolute
[24:54] amen
[24:55] we have an absolute
[24:57] and our absolute is not the youtube
[24:59] influencer
[25:00] our absolute is not the tick tock
[25:02] influencer our absolute is the word of
[25:04] god
[25:06] amen
[25:07] our absolute
[25:09] is not even brother branham
[25:14] yeah it's not
[25:17] brother branham's absolute was the word
[25:18] of god
[25:19] and because he preached the word of god
[25:22] that's that's that's my absolute den
[25:24] amen
[25:26] some people don't like to hear that but
[25:28] it's the truth
[25:30] i believe that with all my heart
[25:32] amen
[25:34] wow
[25:35] so
[25:36] so say so the attack on life is so is
[25:39] relentless today we gave we gave the
[25:41] example of how the word of god amen in
[25:44] genesis we see god male and female
[25:46] created he them amen
[25:49] and and i don't see any other genders
[25:51] there but male and female
[25:53] created he them them was the only
[25:55] pronoun that he used there and that
[25:57] [Laughter]
[25:59] you know all the different you gotta
[26:01] call me this you gotta respect this you
[26:03] gotta respect my pronouns and all that
[26:06] that has never existed until
[26:08] now
[26:10] because the world is going insane
[26:14] it's a mental thing
[26:16] and it and
[26:17] and you want to be called something of
[26:19] some sort of pronoun it i'll if you're a
[26:22] girl
[26:23] you're a girl
[26:25] you're a woman because i go back to the
[26:27] word of god you're you're you're you're
[26:29] female
[26:31] and now they don't know what a woman is
[26:35] they forgot what a woman is
[26:38] but the animals know
[26:42] the animals never forgot what a female
[26:45] is
[26:46] when they stood they don't have no
[26:48] qualms with about it whatsoever
[26:51] but we who are supposed to be more
[26:53] intelligent than than animals
[26:55] we don't know what a woman is
[26:58] yeah
[26:59] there's a supreme court
[27:02] uh nominee or
[27:03] i think is a supreme court nominee they
[27:06] asked her and they said
[27:08] can you please tell us what a woman is
[27:10] and she said i can't give you the i
[27:11] can't give you an answer
[27:13] and she's a woman herself
[27:15] it's because they're so scared to offend
[27:20] jesus offended left and right
[27:22] john the baptist offended left and right
[27:24] paul offended left and right one is the
[27:26] truth it's the truth
[27:27] amen
[27:29] praise the lord
[27:32] so
[27:36] it's all these different all these
[27:37] different pronouns and things so we
[27:39] talked about that so
[27:42] and we talked about what are god's
[27:44] thoughts about you god has thoughts
[27:46] about you amen in jeremiah chapter 29
[27:49] verse 11 he says for i know the thoughts
[27:51] that i think towards you
[27:53] amen and set the lord thoughts of peace
[27:56] and not of evil to give you an expected
[27:58] end amen
[28:00] now let's let's go ahead we'll start
[28:03] here amen so
[28:05] so
[28:06] thoughts we know that they're not
[28:07] insignificant how many can agree with me
[28:10] on that
[28:11] they're not insignificant amen thoughts
[28:14] are very important as i said last time
[28:16] you thought about coming to church today
[28:19] and here you are
[28:21] it came to fruition amen
[28:25] and and and you you you think
[28:28] and then you do amen
[28:31] amen
[28:32] i mean everything that we've done in our
[28:33] life we we we we have thought about it
[28:36] first
[28:37] praise the lord
[28:39] and there and there's no such thing amen
[28:41] in life as thinking about something and
[28:43] and it doesn't have an effect on you
[28:45] it does have an effect on you
[28:48] amen
[28:49] it's very important what you think about
[28:51] amen
[28:52] because it will affect you
[28:54] it will affect you spiritually it will
[28:56] affect you physically and it will cause
[28:58] you to do or not do
[29:01] amen
[29:02] i mean see god gave us inlets right
[29:06] what are the inlets to the soul brother
[29:07] brahma said is the eyes
[29:10] amen
[29:11] we'll we'll touch on those things later
[29:12] but amen but he gave us the ears and he
[29:14] gave us the different inlets amen that
[29:17] get into our spirit realm right
[29:20] that affect our conscious reasoning and
[29:23] and and and those i always forget them
[29:26] but but but but all those things amen
[29:29] affect our spirit man
[29:31] and they're somewhat they're connected
[29:33] to also to the soul because from there
[29:36] from the spirit amen
[29:38] then it comes to the soul and then from
[29:40] the soul you have to either it's it's
[29:42] either you believe or you or you
[29:43] disbelieve
[29:44] it's either faith or doubt
[29:47] so first it has to come in through the
[29:49] inlets of the body whatever it is
[29:52] then it goes into the spirit realm and
[29:54] then and you're thinking about it you're
[29:56] meditating on those things and then
[29:58] eventually it will get down to your soul
[30:00] where you either believe the word of god
[30:02] or you reject the word of god
[30:05] but they first had to come in through
[30:06] the ear they first have to come in
[30:08] through the eye that's why young people
[30:10] that's why it's so important for you to
[30:13] be careful what you listen to
[30:16] because if it'll affect your spirit
[30:18] realm and then it'll affect your soul
[30:22] it's so important for what you watch
[30:24] because it'll it'll it brother brown
[30:26] said himself it it it it directly this
[30:29] is the gateway to the soul
[30:31] but you see it goes through the spirit
[30:33] realm amen and you process it what you
[30:35] saw
[30:36] and then it either had it affects your
[30:38] soul whether to believe the word of god
[30:41] or doubt the word of god amen
[30:43] so
[30:45] we see
[30:46] examples in in the word of god about you
[30:49] know when bad thoughts bad thinking
[30:51] turned into action
[30:52] amen we reminded of that story with the
[30:55] there in
[30:56] uh uh
[30:57] david had a a son amen and and and he
[31:00] had a half sister and amnon was his name
[31:04] and he raped his own half-sister now he
[31:07] just didn't wake up one morning and said
[31:08] i'm just going to do it
[31:10] no
[31:11] he thought about that for a long time
[31:14] and how he was going to pro how is he
[31:16] going how is he gonna
[31:18] bring that about
[31:19] i know that's a terrible story to bring
[31:21] about but i thought it was a good
[31:23] example about bad thinking
[31:26] bad thinking eventually led to bad
[31:28] behavior
[31:30] and it caused the whole havoc in in the
[31:33] kingdom of david later on in in his life
[31:37] all from one thought
[31:40] now you tell me thoughts aren't
[31:42] important
[31:43] they're very
[31:44] important all from one thought
[31:49] judas didn't wake up one morning and
[31:51] said i'm gonna just betray jesus
[31:53] i'm gonna sell him out no
[31:56] he thought about that
[31:58] for a while
[32:00] you know he was with jesus three and a
[32:02] half years you know
[32:04] and eventually the thought manifested in
[32:07] the spirit
[32:08] and the greediness amen that he had for
[32:11] the money the lust for the money
[32:14] sold jesus out amen now
[32:17] those are just two examples you can
[32:19] there's multiple lots of examples of
[32:21] thoughts producing
[32:23] terrible consequences bad thoughts
[32:26] so we should guard our thoughts right
[32:29] amen we should guard our thoughts
[32:31] so what is the thought
[32:34] can you touch a thought
[32:37] can you smell a thought
[32:41] can you taste a thought
[32:44] i thought i tasted it
[32:47] no
[32:49] that's just you haven't brushed your
[32:50] teeth yet
[32:52] [Music]
[32:52] [Laughter]
[32:59] thoughts thoughts are in the spirit
[33:01] realm
[33:02] right
[33:04] i'm just trying to make y'all laugh so
[33:05] you could keep keep keep listening
[33:11] so thoughts are spiritual right
[33:13] you can't you can't touch taste feel or
[33:15] smell thoughts
[33:17] man but
[33:18] what they what a thought will cause a
[33:22] reaction we'll we'll we'll bring
[33:24] something about
[33:25] i meant that you eventually will be able
[33:27] to touch taste feel and smell
[33:30] right
[33:32] i mean somebody had to thought about
[33:34] that fragrance of that perfume that you
[33:36] love to wear sister
[33:38] and they thought about taking this
[33:40] particular
[33:41] ingredient and this particular
[33:43] with some alcohol and this particular
[33:45] ingredient and adding this to create
[33:49] that that you that you love to put on
[34:00] yeah
[34:02] see somebody's thought
[34:04] came into manifestation and now you're
[34:06] wearing that thought
[34:08] is that right that's right
[34:10] it's holy word it's a thought expressed
[34:14] thoughts expressed amen so what is a
[34:16] thought webster's dictionary says that
[34:18] something that is a thought such as an
[34:20] individual act or product of thinking
[34:23] the brothers can bring this up a
[34:25] developed intention or plan
[34:29] in other words you can say for example i
[34:31] had no thought of leaving home
[34:33] amen
[34:34] a developed intention or plan
[34:38] something such as an opinion or belief
[34:40] in the mind
[34:42] and they give the sentence here he spoke
[34:45] his thoughts freely
[34:47] the intellectual product or the
[34:49] organized views and principles of a
[34:52] period place group or individual
[34:55] the action or process of thinking
[34:57] serious consideration
[34:59] reasoning power
[35:01] the power to imagine
[35:04] amen
[35:05] the power to imagine so there is power
[35:08] in imagining there's power in thoughts
[35:12] thoughts are creative remember that
[35:14] and you and i
[35:16] as human beings not just as sons and
[35:19] daughters of god remember this
[35:21] you and i are creators
[35:24] and that's the reason why satan hates us
[35:28] because he knows that we are creators
[35:31] and then when when we become christians
[35:33] my that completes the whole the whole
[35:35] thing then
[35:38] we are creators we're creators of the
[35:40] atmosphere we we we we
[35:42] we offer to people we're creators of
[35:44] things amen we produce things the human
[35:47] being is very intelligent
[35:50] as you can see
[35:52] what is mental
[35:55] you use the word mental what is that
[35:58] can you smell mental can you see mental
[36:01] you can't it's all spiritual
[36:04] now last month we had what was called
[36:07] may uh
[36:08] mental health awareness
[36:10] and and and so that's why i wanted to
[36:13] read a few of these things
[36:15] that i thought it was shocking just in
[36:18] the last two years just in the last two
[36:20] years i'm not going to read all of this
[36:21] but but just in the last two years this
[36:23] was in april of this year
[36:25] the mental health in kobe 19 two years
[36:28] into the pandemic mental health concerns
[36:30] continue to increase
[36:32] now
[36:35] and
[36:37] it says here that the number of people
[36:38] looking online for help with their
[36:40] mental health increased significantly
[36:43] from 2019 to 2021.
[36:45] in 2021 over 5.4 million people took a
[36:48] mental health screen
[36:50] representing a nearly 500 percent
[36:53] increase
[36:55] over the number of people who completed
[36:57] a screening in 2019 and 103 increase
[37:00] over 2020. this is from the if you want
[37:03] to you can read these facts yourself
[37:04] this is from
[37:06] mentalhealthamerica.org i believe
[37:08] is their website
[37:11] more youth
[37:12] more youth are struggling with their
[37:14] mental health and are seeking support
[37:16] online
[37:17] 45 percent of individuals in the us who
[37:20] took a screen in 2021 were youth ages 11
[37:23] through 17 16
[37:25] 16 higher than the average in 2019
[37:29] i i i wanted to read these to you
[37:31] parents because
[37:33] uh
[37:34] i don't want you to overlook when your
[37:36] kid is saying i have mental problems
[37:39] i know it's easy for us to to to think
[37:42] that but it's a spirit
[37:44] we're that's the spirit that we are
[37:46] living in in this hour and the only
[37:48] thing that can combat the spirit is the
[37:50] word of god
[37:51] so
[37:52] you fill yourself up with the word of
[37:54] god with god's thoughts till you can be
[37:56] able to help your child with god's
[37:58] thinking
[37:58] amen
[38:00] but it's real and the pandemic and the
[38:02] covet 19 and all the mask wearing didn't
[38:04] help
[38:06] it actually created it more
[38:09] the largest increases in the percentage
[38:11] of people scoring positive from 2019 to
[38:14] 2021 on this mental health screening
[38:16] here on their website
[38:18] were on the parent and youth screens
[38:20] indicating a large increase in the
[38:21] percentage of youth experiencing
[38:23] emotional attentional
[38:25] or behavioral difficulties during the
[38:27] pandemic
[38:28] there was there was also significant
[38:30] increases in the percentage of people
[38:31] scoring at risk for ptsd severe anxiety
[38:34] and psychotic-like experiences from from
[38:37] 2019 to 2021. the number and percentage
[38:40] of people screening with moderate to
[38:41] severe symptoms of anxiety remain higher
[38:43] than rates prior to covet 19. and that
[38:46] gives all the numbers i just don't have
[38:49] black individuals in the u.s had the
[38:51] largest increase in anxiety during the
[38:53] pandemic
[38:56] compared to other races and ethnicities
[38:58] the percentage of black individuals
[39:00] screening with symptoms of moderate to
[39:01] severe anxiety increased five percent
[39:04] from 2019 to 2021. the percentage of
[39:08] people in the us reporting frequent
[39:10] thoughts of suicide and self-harm in
[39:13] 2021 is the highest recorded since
[39:17] this screening program was launched in
[39:19] 2014.
[39:22] there are more people now thinking about
[39:23] killing themselves
[39:25] than ever before
[39:30] overall 39 of individuals in the u.s who
[39:32] took the depression screen reported
[39:35] frequent suicidal ideation in 2021. this
[39:38] was 8 higher than the average rate of
[39:40] suicidal ideation in 2019 and two
[39:43] percent higher than the rate in 2020.
[39:46] rates of suicidal ideation are highest
[39:49] among youth especially lgbtq plus youth
[39:54] overall 51 of all youth depression
[39:57] screeners ages 11 through 17 reported
[40:00] frequent suicidal ideation on more than
[40:03] half of nearly every day of the previous
[40:05] two weeks 63 of youth ages 11 through 17
[40:08] who identified as lgbtq reported
[40:12] frequent suicidal ideation
[40:16] that percentage are not happy
[40:20] how can you be happy when you're outside
[40:22] of the word of god
[40:24] you can't
[40:26] suicidal ideation has increased most for
[40:30] black youth and adults from 2019 to
[40:32] 2021.
[40:34] but they got they got the black the
[40:36] black youth out there marching in the
[40:38] streets and stuff
[40:39] thinking that their god and they're all
[40:41] depressed
[40:44] see what you watch on tv is not real
[40:48] it is just agendas trying to push things
[40:51] into your mind in reporters
[40:54] over 300 000 people took a psychosis
[40:57] screen in 2021
[41:01] people screening at risk for mental
[41:03] health conditions are struggling most
[41:04] with loneliness or isolation
[41:07] the differences in the things
[41:08] contributing most to mental health
[41:10] concerns among individuals of different
[41:12] races and a
[41:13] nested east reveal inequities in the
[41:16] experience of 2021
[41:18] 2020 and 2021.
[41:21] covet 19 has had a profound negative
[41:23] effect on the mental health of the
[41:25] nation
[41:26] throughout the kobe 19 pandemic mha
[41:29] which is this website has witnessed
[41:31] increasing numbers of people
[41:32] experiencing anxiety depression
[41:34] psychosis loneliness and other mental
[41:36] health concerns
[41:39] the problem i have with that statement
[41:42] is that covet 19 didn't do it
[41:44] it was the it was the laws passed after
[41:46] covert 19 that did that kobe 19 doesn't
[41:49] do it the kobe 19 didn't put a mask on
[41:52] your face
[41:53] covet 19 didn't do those things it was
[41:55] laws that was passed that caused that
[41:59] lgbt lgbtq individuals are more than
[42:02] twice as likely as heterosexual to have
[42:04] a mental illness
[42:06] those in the lgbtq community are 2.5
[42:09] times more likely to experience
[42:10] depression anxiety
[42:13] than heterosexuals
[42:15] 31 percent of older adults in the lgbq
[42:18] community report depressive symptoms
[42:21] women who identify as lesbian or
[42:23] bisexual more than twice as likely to
[42:25] engage in heavy drinking than
[42:27] heterosexual
[42:28] women because they're depressed
[42:31] they're not finding peace in what in
[42:33] their lifestyle
[42:35] and then it talks about you know all the
[42:37] suicide that we just read in that
[42:39] community
[42:43] so is satan dealing with mind with the
[42:45] thoughts
[42:46] he better believe he is
[42:48] and he's working overtime
[42:51] that's why i feel that this topic is
[42:53] very important
[42:54] i mean because it's hard it's hard for
[42:56] you and for our youth to concentrate on
[42:59] on on the word of god that we've been
[43:01] preaching here brother brother dale
[43:02] brother wade bringing wonderful things
[43:04] in regards to the son of man uh our the
[43:07] other ministers and the things that
[43:09] brother dale has brought throughout the
[43:11] years when they got all these things
[43:13] bombarding them
[43:16] they can't concentrate on the son of man
[43:18] they can't concentrate on on on on
[43:20] daniel 70 weeks and things like that
[43:21] when when these things
[43:24] when you when we tell them oh you
[43:26] somehow they'll just get through it
[43:29] amen they have to be addressed
[43:32] they have to be talked about
[43:35] praise the lord
[43:36] so the bible talks about being either
[43:38] spiritually minded or carnally minded
[43:43] it's one of the two there's a scripture
[43:45] we'll read later man there is no in
[43:47] between
[43:48] right
[43:49] you can't you can't but there's no in
[43:51] between you're either carnally minded
[43:55] or spiritually minded
[43:57] there's no gray area
[43:59] amen praise god
[44:01] now last time we had talked about
[44:03] uh abortion and the evil laws and
[44:07] thoughts being introduced around it amen
[44:10] and and and we know that in this last
[44:12] day
[44:13] jesus said in his word that that as it
[44:16] was in the days of noah
[44:18] right as it was in the days of sodom so
[44:20] shall it be in the days of the coming of
[44:22] the son of man
[44:23] right what are we believing in those
[44:25] days
[44:26] man what happened in the days of noah
[44:30] what was going on in the days of noah
[44:32] this is what genesis 6 5 says
[44:35] and god saw that the wickedness of man
[44:38] the wickedness
[44:39] of man
[44:41] was great
[44:42] in the earth
[44:46] it was great it wasn't just just bad it
[44:49] was great and that's not great like oh
[44:52] man that's awesome
[44:54] no it was really really bad
[44:56] now remember jesus said as it was in the
[44:58] days of noah
[45:00] amen
[45:01] was great in the earth and that every
[45:04] every imagination of the thoughts
[45:07] of his heart
[45:09] was only evil continually
[45:14] that right there
[45:15] that right there is a scope of the
[45:17] political world
[45:19] of the science world
[45:20] of the youth of that day
[45:23] of the of the middle age of that day the
[45:25] elderly of that day everything
[45:28] because when we think about noah's day
[45:29] we only think about
[45:31] uh a boat and noah and his family
[45:34] but you gotta remember there was a
[45:36] society a huge society just all just
[45:39] like ours and
[45:41] today
[45:42] and they had they had political things
[45:45] going on they had
[45:47] issues agendas and all these things amen
[45:50] jesus said as it was in the days of
[45:53] this day
[45:55] and he also said as it was in the days
[45:57] of sodom and gomorrah now we we we think
[46:00] that the sodomites and the the people in
[46:02] gamora we think that they're they're
[46:04] just like the drunk man with the flies
[46:06] hang you know around his mouth you know
[46:08] that they're just
[46:10] people that were not smart they had they
[46:12] had
[46:12] governments they were they were they
[46:15] were people they were they were they
[46:16] were they were people but they had some
[46:20] they had a terrible thought process
[46:23] it got so bad that they were trying to
[46:26] knock people's doors to just go in there
[46:28] and sleep with their own kind
[46:32] you don't think that in this day it
[46:33] can't turn into that
[46:35] it's we're heading that way
[46:37] and they're targeting you and me as
[46:39] christians
[46:41] oh they hate christians
[46:44] we get in their way
[46:46] we get in their way
[46:50] so every imagination of the thoughts of
[46:53] his heart and so when you look at that
[46:55] word imagination in that verse is the
[46:57] hebrew word yet sir
[46:59] and it means a form of framing a purpose
[47:02] amen this word is
[47:05] is related to the word yat sar which
[47:07] means to form
[47:09] fashion frame to form fashion of human
[47:11] activity of divine activity of creation
[47:14] of original creation of individuals at
[47:16] conception
[47:18] and
[47:20] predetermined preordained to be formed
[47:22] amen
[47:23] in other words it's like
[47:26] it's it's the same word that that that
[47:28] is used if for example like a like a
[47:30] potter
[47:31] when he is forming when he's when he's
[47:33] going to form that vessel that he
[47:35] that he's
[47:36] amen that he's thought about
[47:40] in order for him to form that vessel
[47:42] that that vase or that thing amen he had
[47:45] to think about it first
[47:49] it was an imagination in his heart
[47:52] right it was something that was really
[47:55] amen uh um
[47:56] uh um
[47:58] i suppose what's the word i'm looking
[48:00] for it it was causing him excitement in
[48:03] other words
[48:04] and then he goes on and works on it you
[48:06] see
[48:09] praise the lord
[48:11] and so when when when the when he
[48:13] creates that vase or he creates that
[48:15] that pottery or whatever it is amen all
[48:18] it is amen
[48:20] all it is that pottery reflects amen
[48:23] that that pottery existed somewhere
[48:25] before
[48:27] and it existed in the thoughts of of of
[48:30] the potter
[48:31] right
[48:32] it existed in his mind
[48:35] and man you think about that saints
[48:37] amen you and i men who are here and who
[48:39] are or who are looking at are lit trying
[48:42] to live the word of god amen
[48:44] raise the lord we we we existed in the
[48:47] mind of god we were special in the mind
[48:50] of god amen
[48:51] and god put us here exactly at the right
[48:53] moment at the right time at the right
[48:55] age
[48:59] you are here at the right age oh i wish
[49:01] i lived in martin's stage no you
[49:02] couldn't have survived it
[49:04] i wish i wish i lived when jesus was
[49:07] here you couldn't have survived it
[49:09] but he knew you could have survived this
[49:11] age
[49:13] oh this is the worst age
[49:15] ever but you are here
[49:19] was he was he going to have christians
[49:21] was he going to have believers in
[49:22] laodicea absolutely
[49:24] and you are one of them
[49:27] and he said that you are overcomers
[49:30] in this age
[49:32] i like the other brother the other day
[49:34] man and i believe that lafontaines they
[49:36] sing a song like that
[49:38] amen this is she
[49:40] the bride of the last age
[49:42] amen they're going to be amazed that you
[49:47] overcame this age
[49:50] paul will shake your hand
[49:54] paul will will will want to know
[49:57] how you did it
[50:00] we always look to paul we look at paul
[50:02] and we think my
[50:03] paul was just an overcomer and he was
[50:08] but you are an overcomer
[50:11] even greater
[50:13] paul didn't get didn't live in the age
[50:14] that we live in now
[50:16] it's a terrible age that we live in but
[50:18] we are here to overcome saints
[50:21] praise the lord
[50:24] so thoughts they're powerful how many
[50:26] are still with me
[50:28] crazy i know that i'm going slow i'm not
[50:30] running around and
[50:32] hey man this
[50:34] i just don't think we're gonna get
[50:35] everything if we
[50:37] i mean i got my my way in
[50:41] so we gotta we gotta we gotta be
[50:43] who we are amen
[50:47] thoughts are powerful
[50:49] and they can lead to inactions or or or
[50:52] actions
[50:53] yeah
[50:55] i'm gonna brag on my on my daughter here
[51:00] i'm very proud of her
[51:04] and i'm mainly proud of her because
[51:07] she you know two years ago you know she
[51:09] was struggling with with
[51:11] depression type spirits and things like
[51:13] that now she was going to public school
[51:16] and
[51:17] and she would hide those things she she
[51:20] wouldn't tell us
[51:21] later on you know she told us you know
[51:24] she was good at hiding those those those
[51:26] things but i think that's partly why
[51:29] it didn't help her
[51:31] but
[51:32] you know we we talked with her and we
[51:34] try to help and and you know sometimes
[51:37] those frustrating moments because
[51:39] you know you're like how can how can you
[51:41] think like that or you know
[51:44] because you in your mind as a parent you
[51:45] don't think
[51:47] that that's real to them you you see
[51:50] but it's real
[51:52] it's real
[51:55] but
[51:56] she told she told my wife and me uh
[51:59] she said you know mommy
[52:01] the way i overcame those things is that
[52:03] i had to choose on my own to overcome
[52:09] i didn't
[52:10] i didn't
[52:12] you know i could have quoted her all
[52:13] kinds of scriptures i could i could have
[52:15] given her printed out all kinds of
[52:17] quotes giving her all kinds of
[52:19] statistics
[52:20] anything but until she thought herself
[52:24] to say i'm through with this
[52:27] and move on
[52:28] she wasn't gonna may overcome it
[52:31] and that's how you're going to overcome
[52:33] it
[52:33] until you say take the word of god
[52:36] seriously
[52:37] and take it personally and say the the
[52:40] lord your thoughts is what's going to
[52:43] move me i'm not going to be moved by my
[52:44] feelings anymore i'm not going to be
[52:46] moved by my own thoughts i'm not going
[52:48] to be moved by my own opinions it's your
[52:50] thoughts or nothing
[52:52] it's your promises or nothing
[52:54] amen
[52:56] then you're not going to get out of your
[52:57] slump
[52:58] you're not going to get out of your rut
[52:59] you're not going to get out exactly
[53:02] i just needed to
[53:04] brag on that because that was an
[53:05] inspiration to me
[53:08] because i i i i tend to be sometimes you
[53:11] know
[53:12] i you know and she knows not the family
[53:14] no i've i've had to confess to them
[53:17] papi has not been the the
[53:20] the best in faith these last two years
[53:26] because we let the world and the cosmos
[53:29] around us
[53:30] push us around
[53:33] you see
[53:35] but but when i grabbed a hold of these
[53:37] scriptures amen in philippians chapter 4
[53:40] to think on these things amen that just
[53:42] changed my world
[53:44] differently amen
[53:45] praise god
[53:48] so
[53:50] you know and so she had to decide on her
[53:52] own you know thoughts thoughts uh they
[53:55] they can make your body
[53:57] feel
[53:58] a certain way
[54:00] they can make you uh you know

[54:08] careful

[55:12] getting a reaction right now
[55:13] [Laughter]
[55:16] esther esther black hates cockroaches
[55:21] now
[55:22] i want you to start close your eyes
[55:24] again
[55:25] and i want you to think about lemons
[55:28] putting a lemon in your mouth
[55:31] anna
[55:36] hey i want you can open them as soon as
[55:38] i start as soon as she started thinking
[55:40] about that her face went like this
[55:46] you see your thought you just thought
[55:47] about lemons we have no lemons here
[55:50] there's no chick-fil-a lemonade or
[55:52] anything like that where there's no
[55:53] lemons you just thought about it and it
[55:55] caused you to act
[55:58] right
[55:59] and then when you if i were to ask you
[56:01] start thinking about food those are
[56:03] those who are those of you who are
[56:04] hungry
[56:06] oh my
[56:07] your mouth is going to start getting
[56:09] watery

[56:13] growling
[56:16] going to cause it's going to make a
[56:17] reaction right
[56:19] but thoughts are not important
[56:22] thoughts bring reactions
[56:25] thoughts make you make you react a
[56:27] certain way amen
[56:29] praise the lord
[56:31] so so
[56:32] i just
[56:33] thought i'd bring that because
[56:35] i was hoping to get a reaction and i did
[56:38] anna and esther
[56:39] [Laughter]
[56:42] amen
[56:44] and so
[56:47] so that there you know there's thoughts
[56:49] that we can think about you know you
[56:50] just thought about lemons you thought
[56:52] about mosquitoes and all those things
[56:54] but then there's thoughts
[56:55] amen that excite you brother terrence
[56:58] when you think about your grandchildren
[57:00] does it make you sad
[57:02] depressed
[57:04] oh
[57:05] i gotta hold them again
[57:09] i bet you when you're thinking about
[57:10] your grandchildren and and what their
[57:12] futures can be i bet you that makes you
[57:14] excited
[57:15] and you haven't not even seen them in
[57:17] the future yet
[57:19] and that's already exciting
[57:22] see
[57:23] so why is the word of god telling us to
[57:25] think on these things
[57:28] amen
[57:29] think on the word
[57:31] because it because it will produce an
[57:33] action
[57:36] will it produce for you to hate your
[57:38] brother
[57:40] not according to the word
[57:41] when you're thinking on the word will it
[57:43] produce for you to to uh to back bite
[57:46] your brother or to or to uh go rob a
[57:49] store
[57:51] no
[57:52] not not if you're thinking on these
[57:54] thoughts
[57:55] amen
[57:57] think on these things
[58:00] there's thoughts amen that you're going
[58:01] to think about but that you think about
[58:04] that it will rob you from your peace it
[58:06] will rob you from your blessings from
[58:07] your joy
[58:09] it will rob you from all those things
[58:11] it'll make you negative
[58:12] it'll make you grouchy it'll make you
[58:15] hate people
[58:16] for for no cause
[58:21] i've i've
[58:22] experienced that
[58:25] it'll make you think that you're better
[58:26] than somebody else and you don't even
[58:28] know that person yourself
[58:32] just by what you think
[58:34] just about what you led in your mind
[58:37] and you have not even met
[58:39] that person you haven't you've not even
[58:40] talked to that individual and you
[58:42] already think that you're better than
[58:43] them
[58:46] just by what you're thinking
[58:49] amen
[58:50] it takes the peace and it drains you
[58:52] spiritually emotionally
[58:53] amen
[58:55] so if god's words are an expression of
[58:57] his thinking
[58:59] then satan's words are expressions of
[59:02] his own thinking right
[59:05] praise the lord and we talked about last
[59:07] week last time amen how satan came in
[59:10] and then and he
[59:12] he expressed his own thoughts to eve
[59:15] and how eve
[59:16] took on the thought you see eve had to
[59:19] had to think about what satan was
[59:21] telling her what the serpent was telling
[59:22] her
[59:24] then it came into manifestation then she
[59:26] did the act
[59:29] brother dale he preached about this
[59:31] several years ago
[59:33] and and and
[59:35] it's not just that
[59:37] she did the act right there and then no
[59:39] it had to be satan working with her for
[59:41] a while
[59:42] it could have been 10 years it could
[59:44] have been 15 it could have been a
[59:45] hundred years i don't know but satan was
[59:48] working
[59:49] just working to try to mold the mind
[59:53] trying to mold the mind the mind the the
[59:56] thoughts
[59:57] amen
[59:59] and that's why i was saying last time
[1:00:01] our young girls be careful when guys
[1:00:05] young men come and approach you in
[1:00:07] certain ways
[1:00:08] asking you certain inappropriate
[1:00:09] questions that's not the thoughts of god
[1:00:13] that boy has an agenda
[1:00:15] that young man has an agenda maybe he
[1:00:18] doesn't know that he's doing wrong
[1:00:20] but you be careful you you be so filled
[1:00:23] with god's thinking that you won't let
[1:00:25] that type of thinking take over you
[1:00:27] because the boy amen that those boys
[1:00:30] amen will get to your mind first
[1:00:33] if they get to your to your to what they
[1:00:36] really want first to your body then then
[1:00:38] that that would be that'll be rape
[1:00:40] but but but those that are
[1:00:43] they get to your mind first
[1:00:45] hey and they could be one year two years
[1:00:48] three years it doesn't matter
[1:00:52] that satan was patient
[1:00:54] so you so you be careful young girls
[1:00:56] amen who you entertain in your life
[1:01:00] well you're entertaining in your life
[1:01:02] it's very important
[1:01:05] so you and i we've become what we've
[1:01:07] thought about
[1:01:08] amen if you think about learning to play
[1:01:11] the guitar if that's what you're always
[1:01:13] thinking about
[1:01:14] zach being one for example brother aaron
[1:01:17] amen they thought about it and we see it
[1:01:19] in manifestation bella thought about she
[1:01:22] was playing the violin we see her
[1:01:23] playing the violin zoe
[1:01:25] you see
[1:01:26] whatever you think about that's what
[1:01:28] you're going to become amen
[1:01:30] i thought about building websites when i
[1:01:32] was younger amen now i have a job in
[1:01:34] that way
[1:01:36] you see
[1:01:39] things like that you see you think about
[1:01:41] gardening amen and that's what you're
[1:01:43] always constantly thinking about and
[1:01:45] you're going to go out there and garden
[1:01:48] by the way didn't just wake up
[1:01:50] one morning and said i'm just gonna
[1:01:51] garden
[1:01:53] no he he was probably planting
[1:01:55] or i'm gonna i'm do some beehives put
[1:01:57] some beehives it took some planning some
[1:01:59] reading of some books some education
[1:02:01] amen feeling filling with those thoughts
[1:02:03] and then it came into fruition amen
[1:02:05] praise the lord
[1:02:07] praise god we're not when i was gonna
[1:02:10] you know
[1:02:12] my mom says that when i was a young boy
[1:02:15] that i used to talk a lot
[1:02:19] and uh
[1:02:21] now
[1:02:22] nowadays i'm just trying kind of trying
[1:02:23] to prove her wrong on that now
[1:02:28] because she saw me at that time yeah and
[1:02:31] i was i i would she would tell me that i
[1:02:33] would go around
[1:02:35] and uh
[1:02:36] to the neighbors out in in in columbia
[1:02:39] south america not just about five years
[1:02:41] old and i'd go knocking the neighbors
[1:02:43] doors the ladies
[1:02:44] the uh the the women
[1:02:47] and uh and i'd just go in there and just
[1:02:49] start talking to him
[1:02:51] and they and they would come to my mom
[1:02:53] and my to my mom
[1:02:55] their neighbors and friends to my mom
[1:02:57] he's just so cute
[1:03:00] he just goes in there just talking to us
[1:03:03] and just telling us things ain't no
[1:03:04] telling what i was telling them
[1:03:07] my mom was probably like really
[1:03:12] but i would i have no i would have no
[1:03:14] qualms about going in there and talking
[1:03:16] to people
[1:03:17] see
[1:03:18] the later on
[1:03:20] the lord using that amen to minister the
[1:03:24] gospel a man to preach
[1:03:26] i had no idea
[1:03:27] i never wanted to to i never thought i'd
[1:03:29] be preaching the word
[1:03:31] but then
[1:03:32] then at one point
[1:03:34] at some point in time back in 2008 2007
[1:03:37] 2008 the lord started really dealing
[1:03:39] with me strongly on that
[1:03:41] and and it had to be thoughts i was
[1:03:44] thinking about it
[1:03:45] and then finally
[1:03:47] there at brother gene williams church i
[1:03:49] was i talked to him about it and and and
[1:03:51] it came into fruition
[1:03:54] so here i am
[1:03:57] a thought expressed
[1:03:59] right
[1:04:01] praise the lord
[1:04:03] so
[1:04:06] so in jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 so he
[1:04:08] says for i know the thoughts that i
[1:04:10] think toward you he knows
[1:04:13] the thoughts that he thinks towards you
[1:04:14] and we're going to finish here in just a
[1:04:16] moment for i know the thoughts that i
[1:04:17] think towards you seth the lord thoughts
[1:04:19] of peace
[1:04:20] and not of evil
[1:04:23] amen
[1:04:24] he has thoughts of peace about you what
[1:04:27] are his thoughts his thoughts are his
[1:04:29] word
[1:04:30] amen
[1:04:32] that's the reason why paul says think on
[1:04:36] these things
[1:04:38] because those thoughts right there are
[1:04:40] his word and so he tells us to think on
[1:04:42] those things so that that's why he says
[1:04:45] they're thoughts of peace
[1:04:47] because remember what paul said in
[1:04:48] philippians chapter 4 he said when you
[1:04:51] think on these things it'll bring peace
[1:04:54] it'll bring
[1:04:55] these things that you that you so desire
[1:04:59] to give you what an expected end
[1:05:02] amen
[1:05:03] that's why young people we say always
[1:05:05] put the lord first in your life
[1:05:09] amen
[1:05:10] always put god's thoughts first
[1:05:13] before anything else before any of your
[1:05:15] plans put god's thoughts first
[1:05:18] because god's thoughts will give you
[1:05:20] peace
[1:05:23] and peace about what you're going to do
[1:05:25] or not going to do
[1:05:27] see god will give you peace about
[1:05:29] whether you should go that route or not
[1:05:32] but only if you put god's thoughts first
[1:05:36] because his thoughts are always thoughts
[1:05:38] of peace of you
[1:05:40] and not of evil to give you an expected
[1:05:43] end to give you an and that he's already
[1:05:45] thought of you before the foundation of
[1:05:47] the world
[1:05:48] he knew you he loved you and he made a
[1:05:52] way for you
[1:05:53] they're thoughts of peace
[1:05:55] so just step into his thoughts
[1:05:58] step into this and he in his thinking
[1:06:01] praise the
[1:06:02] lord no
[1:06:04] aren't you aren't you thankful that we
[1:06:06] were in his thoughts
[1:06:08] amen
[1:06:10] and and and that his thoughts are to
[1:06:12] bring us peace
[1:06:16] saints is what drove him to die on the
[1:06:18] cross for us
[1:06:20] it's what drove him amen to to while you
[1:06:22] were under what how's the song go while
[1:06:24] he was on the cross you were on his mind
[1:06:29] they didn't do it for himself he did it
[1:06:30] for you and i
[1:06:33] you he was thinking of you
[1:06:35] and he was just continuing that thought
[1:06:36] process
[1:06:38] the same thought that he thought of you
[1:06:39] from the beginning before the foundation
[1:06:41] of the world he was just continuing that
[1:06:44] thought process while he was on the
[1:06:45] cross
[1:06:47] i'm so thankful for that
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:51] let's talk about abraham for just a
[1:06:52] moment abraham embraced god thought
[1:06:54] god's thoughts
[1:06:56] right
[1:06:58] he was told amen he was going to have a
[1:07:00] promised son
[1:07:03] and he was like
[1:07:04] how
[1:07:07] in his mental in his human way
[1:07:11] but it came a point amen that he's like
[1:07:14] okay lord you're gonna have to do it
[1:07:17] i can't do it
[1:07:18] you said it and i'm just gonna stand on
[1:07:21] it and believe it
[1:07:23] praise god
[1:07:25] he told him already that his descendants
[1:07:27] were going to be innumerable as the
[1:07:28] stars
[1:07:31] how is this god that that brought me out
[1:07:33] of my out of the land of where i came
[1:07:36] from where i was born he has led me all
[1:07:38] this way he's talked to me he's told me
[1:07:41] these things and and he has made me
[1:07:43] prosper and now he's telling me that
[1:07:45] he's going to give me a son he's going
[1:07:47] to give me descendants
[1:07:49] they were innumerable more than the
[1:07:51] stars
[1:07:52] what's more enumerable than the stars or
[1:07:54] the sands of the the grains of sand than
[1:07:56] the oh
[1:07:58] at the beach
[1:08:01] and you can think you can think
[1:08:03] how in the world is that going to happen
[1:08:06] humanly he probably thought that but all
[1:08:08] he had to do was rest on that thought
[1:08:11] he had to align his thoughts
[1:08:13] with god's thoughts
[1:08:15] man i can't explain some of the things
[1:08:17] in the word but i'll align my thinking
[1:08:20] towards that word
[1:08:21] i don't know how it's going to happen i
[1:08:23] don't know how how it will but if i
[1:08:25] think the way he thinks it'll come to
[1:08:28] pass amen
[1:08:30] praise the lord
[1:08:31] and then and that please god saints when
[1:08:33] you believe his thoughts
[1:08:35] and and you cling to them
[1:08:37] that pleases god
[1:08:39] they pleased god that abraham hung to
[1:08:41] his thoughts
[1:08:43] you don't have to know all the details
[1:08:45] of how it's going to happen
[1:08:47] i'm a hundred years old and he's saying
[1:08:49] i'm going to have a baby
[1:08:52] that's not for you to figure out abraham
[1:08:56] god will deal with that amen
[1:08:59] amen
[1:09:00] so i want to leave you with this
[1:09:03] i want us to cling to the to to to the
[1:09:06] thoughts of god
[1:09:07] all right
[1:09:08] and remember
[1:09:10] that i'm gonna we're gonna keep talking
[1:09:12] about this but i want us to cling to
[1:09:13] those to the healing thoughts
[1:09:16] to these healing thoughts and brothers
[1:09:18] can bring these scriptures you need
[1:09:20] healing in your life cling to these

[1:09:39] health and heal your wounds declares the
[1:09:41] lord
[1:09:43] he said it that's his thoughts
[1:09:46] how is he going to do it i don't know
[1:09:49] he could do it through the elixir that
[1:09:50] that sister regina took the other day or
[1:09:52] or the or he could do it through the
[1:09:54] doctor through a surgery or he could do
[1:09:57] it instantaneously but he just said he
[1:09:59] did it he will do
[1:10:00] it
[1:10:02] amen
[1:10:06] exodus 23 25 worship the lord your god
[1:10:09] and his blessing will be on your food
[1:10:11] and water
[1:10:13] i will take away sickness from among you
[1:10:15] this was right before the children when
[1:10:17] the children of israel were where were
[1:10:19] were left egypt
[1:10:21] god protected them while they were in in
[1:10:24] the in the desert in the wilderness with

[1:10:28] there was no walmart around
[1:10:30] there was no racetrack or q t
[1:10:33] nothing
[1:10:35] god was a racetrack god was their qt god
[1:10:37] was their walmart and he was more than
[1:10:39] that he was the creator
[1:10:43] some of us what would we do if we didn't
[1:10:44] have racetrack and qt
[1:10:47] be able to get our big gulps and and
[1:10:50] i don't see how some of y'all drink that
[1:10:56] but they didn't have none of that but
[1:10:58] god provided for them
[1:10:59] isaiah 53 4-5 surely he took up our pain
[1:11:03] and bore our suffering
[1:11:04] yet we considered him punished by god
[1:11:06] stricken by him and afflicted but he was
[1:11:09] pierced for our transgressions he was
[1:11:10] crushed for our iniquities the
[1:11:11] punishment that brought us peace was on
[1:11:13] him and by his wounds
[1:11:15] we are healed
[1:11:18] and that's another that's another
[1:11:19] version that's another version of the
[1:11:21] bible

[1:11:42] be patient in tribulation be constant in
[1:11:45] prayer

[1:11:49] but god can change the circumstance
[1:11:52] amen for your family member romans 8 28
[1:11:55] and we know that for those who love god
[1:11:58] all things
[1:12:00] work together for good
[1:12:02] for those who are called according to
[1:12:05] his
[1:12:06] purpose what a blessed thought that is
[1:12:10] proverbs 14 26 in the fear of the lord
[1:12:13] there is strong confidence
[1:12:16] and his children will have refuge
[1:12:19] in psalm 89 4 thy seed
[1:12:22] will establish will i establish forever
[1:12:26] and build up thy throne to all
[1:12:28] generations
[1:12:30] now he was talking to he was talking to
[1:12:32] to israel amen but the word of god is
[1:12:34] for all of us
[1:12:36] so god promised me my seed and i will
[1:12:38] believe that
[1:12:42] i don't know how they're going to come
[1:12:43] in i don't know what how it's going to
[1:12:45] happen i don't know i don't know what
[1:12:47] what's going to happen what god needs to
[1:12:49] do in order to get him to a place amen
[1:12:52] that they repent they receive the
[1:12:53] baptism of the holy ghost but god said
[1:12:56] that he will do it
[1:12:58] because his seed amen your seed amen
[1:13:00] your offspring god promised it to
[1:13:03] if you are claiming his thoughts about
[1:13:05] it amen then god has to fulfill his
[1:13:08] thinking because you're aligning your
[1:13:09] thoughts with his thoughts
[1:13:12] praise the lord jesus
[1:13:14] praise the lord
[1:13:17] so i want you to think on these things
[1:13:20] and i could give you these scriptures i
[1:13:22] can maybe put them on the whatsapp group
[1:13:24] if you need them
[1:13:26] put them on there think on those things
[1:13:29] i'll leave you with those thoughts
[1:13:31] we'll continue next time
[1:13:33] amen
[1:13:36] [Applause]
[1:13:43] our
[1:13:44] thoughts
[1:13:46] our thoughts will will our
[1:13:49] will
[1:13:50] will create things
[1:13:53] amen and i always remember that you are
[1:13:55] creator
[1:13:57] praise the lord you are you are
[1:14:00] you are a creator but it has to start
[1:14:02] with thinking first the right mental
[1:14:05] attitude
[1:14:06] towards god's thoughts
[1:14:08] or the right mental attitude towards the
[1:14:10] promises of god brother branham said
[1:14:12] we'll bring them to pass
[1:14:14] amen
[1:14:18] so it starts with your thinking
[1:14:21] if you take the word of god and you say
[1:14:23] i i just read isaiah
[1:14:28] and i believe it
[1:14:30] but
[1:14:33] you're not aligning yourself with god's
[1:14:35] thoughts
[1:14:37] you're not
[1:14:38] that won't bring the results
[1:14:41] amen
[1:14:43] but when you when you take god's word no
[1:14:46] matter how ridiculous it sounds
[1:14:48] and you say
[1:14:50] i believe it
[1:14:51] i'm gonna take it to me personally
[1:14:55] and i'm just going to express it
[1:14:58] you go around expressing and you go
[1:14:59] around saying i'm healed whether i feel

[1:15:18] he's been much better now thank god
[1:15:21] god heals through whatever avenue it
[1:15:23] needs to do amen
[1:15:27] but you know what
[1:15:28] you have to push through
[1:15:30] it's an overcoming
[1:15:32] it's an overcoming it's taking god's
[1:15:34] word and just pushing through
[1:15:38] and whether hey

[1:15:41] god i'm having heart issues whatever if
