Mary and the different on sister Jean sister Johnny and all the ones that that are sick among us that Lord we just keep them on our hearts and pray continually we love you and we thank you have your way in Jesus name amen if you'd like to turn in Exodus 3 we'll try to pick up our thought and continue on from where we've been speaking about this Exodus 3 now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see now I like that when the Lord saw now he knew he was going to turn and everything else but still Moses was was part of it wanted to to look and see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses mooses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet and for the for the place whereon thou standest is Holy Ground moreover he said now this God speaking once now I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob remember I told you last week the way to read that is really to say I am the god of thy father I am the god of Abraham I am the god of Isaac I am the god of Jacob because he's in it's Illustrated there to the point and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptian and to bring them out of that land with a good unto a good land a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the pites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and I will send thee un Pharaoh that thou th must bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt and Moses said unto God who am I that I should go unto pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou Hast brought forth the people out of Egypt ye shall serve God upon this mountain and Moses said unto God behold when I come unto the children of Israel and say unto them the god of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am hath sent me unto you you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now we were trying last week to uh you know get a uh kind of a layout and uh an understanding of what is taking place cuz that's what I like to to do that's the reason I like that you know like I said there when you're reading it more I am the god of Abraham well it's not put in there because it's doing but then you can say I am the god of Isaac I am the god all right now when we get down to the bottom in a minute you'll see the emphasis of that and why we we keep talking about it all right so we've been going through kind of the Old Testament looking at the things there and saw that uh it says in Genesis God created and it's 30s something times there in the Book of Genesis 1 God created all right that's not in total capitalization and things because remember our story when God is here on Earth when God is speaking to mankind from Heaven it'll say the Lord Capital great big letters and things like that because it's emphasizing where it's from he spoke to even to Cain the Lord the capital letters and things you know and then when it would come on down see then it from Genesis one it would be God and then when you get to Genesis 2 you'll pick it up and three and start from their own it'll be Lord God capital letters and things like that begins to appear which is to emphasize the importance of what you're talking about all right A noun is supposed to be started off with a with a capital letter because it's the name of a person place or thing see it can be brought all the way through because you're using the the letters like that not trying to be in English major but just to to make sure that you follow what I'm talking about all right that see we we can follow that Lord God all right when you come to this part now that he gets to Exodus and it picks up and Moses has his personal experience at the burning bush okay so then when he does God speaks to Moses and said I am the god of Abraham he reminds him you know I'm the god of a Abraham I'm the god of Isaac I'm the god of Jacob he reminds him of who who he is and Moses says plainly like I tried to emphasize to you a little bit about it that Moses said that's good I I I know about the God of Abraham I know about Abraham I know the records I know the things you know mental records if nothing else that I know about the God of Isaac I know what happened there the god of Jacob the the things I know what took place in those situations but now when I get down there they are going to ask me if I come in and say now I've come down here to lead you out of of bondage and they're going to say what's his name you know all right and then when he says now when they say what's his name Moses was saying was pling I don't know about this situation I don't understand it because I understand Abraham Isaac and Jacob I understand but now in all of that there was never a name picked up even when you go into Genesis you go to Elohim you go in Genesis 2 34 you going into Elohim Elohim means self-existing one but it is not a name it's a title of a name then you pick up Lord God and when you pick up Lord God what are you picking up Jehovah Elohim which Jehovah means like a father with his family but no name all right Moses is simply saying to God I understand all of the situation there but said I want to know what your name is said at least if you're going to send me you could tell me who's doing the sending well he said okay I'll just tell you I am that I am right all right and that's bold italicized letters of if you're looking in your Bible see it's bringing it down to understanding this is one specific situation am as I said when you come over to Lord God of of Exodus I mean of Genesis 2 then it emphasizes the emphasis is placed upon capitalization because that way you would understand that you're dealing with with God Almighty himself but remember whether it be Yahweh Elohim you know Jehovah Jehovah Gyra Jehovah tishu all of those things all of that is references as titles to a name because it's not a name remember they couldn't pronounce it that's right now they could pronounce or make a stab let me make that correctly in this way that I've tried to explain it you could make a stab at jvh you make a stab at it but remember the point there is no vowels except the you part that's used in there so there was no way they could interpret now they could take a stab you know they can make a stab well well it's jvh hu that's that's JV that's his name well we're right back where we was when we were in the denominations and things and you'd say what is the name of God well what do you mean what is the name of God his name is God we know his name is God well God is an object of worship right right and see that's not a name so you still don't have it and brother rown says even when it comes to the burning bush I'll get to this in a minute even up to the burning bush he still has no name now not that he didn't have a name not that his name wasn't present but he name could not be interpreted let's put it that way Jehovah could you know you know you could say well what that's this JV that's Jehovah but it couldn't be interpreted Elohim couldn't be interpreted to mankind right so when you get up here to even to the burning bush then you're still that and he says I am that I am now remember how we emphasized that the other day and I want you the point to remain in your mind because you go back up to verse uh six when he said moreover I am the god of Abraham God speaking personally to Moses I am the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob when he gets down here Moses says tell me your name right if I'm going down I want to know what name I'm going in I I want to tell them when they say something I want to tell them something that they'll realize that there's there's something involved here that we need to think about so he says Moses tell them I am listen see he's saying I am the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob right so he saying to Moses Moses tell them I am that I am who the one Abraham Isaac and Jacob that's right right I am that I am see because now you're getting closer to a name am you're developing more of an understanding to interpret as reading I saying instead of saying pronounce a name you can pronounce because brother R said there's plenty of jesuses in the world in the days of Jesus there was plenty of jesuses all right but there was only one Lord Jesus Christ there was only one that the Bible said you'll call his name Emmanuel but they didn't do it they called him Jesus cuz he said now you'll call him Jesus because he'll save his people specifically stating who he is what he's doing now that's the emphasis I'm trying to get you to think about is how that as it develops further and further throughout you're getting to a closer understanding of how to interpret the name amen all right because you're not just dealing with letters on a page no do you understand what I'm saying he saying I am that I'm the one that spoke to Moses I mean to to Abraham to Isaac to Jacob now I'm speaking to you said you just go tell them I am but said remember to tell them I am that I am right that's right because remember the children of Israel were supposed to be the people of God and should have understood who Abraham was was should have understood who Isaac was Jacob was and should have understood what took place and how God revealed himself to mankind over the the time and bringing it out that it would come from trying to bring it out as Elohim self-existing now that's self-existing for eternity now we'll get to to the uh when you take Elohim see you get self-existent when you get to I am I am means everpresent for eternity am same as Elohim Elohim was ever presentent for eternity now you're coming down here that you're getting to I am that I am I'm that name that's always been right and the Bible he says there he said this is my name forever amen right it'll be a Perpetual name forever well there's not but one name remember our last week we'll try to pick it up from that thought you remember what we're talking about there's only one name that can fit into this situation amen and there's where we've missed it out what did Brother Rand say about Eve's first mistake he said she didn't believe Hebrews 138 now that's his words Eve didn't believe Hebrews 138 what is Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now do we believe it as just trying to pronounce a name or trying to find a new name or trying to find a coded something or how you would say it in the Bible to try to pick up something to get something to make us real into our our understanding or are we trying to see who he really is see Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's no con coincidence that it happens up over here in Hebrews 138 and to bring that out to because that's the only name that God ever had all right now we're up to the point of where we're at right the prophet said what he said the only name God ever had is Jesus amen yes amen see then that would make him Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever remember what we talked about Hebrews 13:7 to consider a man's conversation consider what a preacher preaches about does he preach Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever or does he preach Jesus in a way oh in a way he's the same now the prophet said he's he's he's in every way the same name all right so now you've got your Hebrews 13:8 to understand that where you can come to the name and look back here look back here in the Old Testament and follow the opening of the word from God Elohim Jehovah yahweh's all of those titles and things the Jehovah gyus and all pointing to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ why because Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new right Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new all right now when you come to the New Testament part then you could pronounce his name but that's where I love it so much of where that they the way that they put it in there you know because it's in Isaiah that says you you'll call his name Emmanuel well why didn't the angel speak to Mary and say you'll call his name Emmanuel why didn't she call him Emmanuel right she did he did because Emmanuel is who you're talking about Jesus Christ sir why because Emmanuel it said because he'll save his people right have you ever notice one little Point go back in your uh Old Testament and you'll notice something there a little different to to what to doing the word uh Emmanuel is spelled two different ways in the Bible the Old Testament it's spelled with an i the New Testament is spelled with a knee I don't understand how come I'm not doing I'm just ask is telling you don't go and read run in your thing and you'll say well I'm going to run this in and and I'm going to find you know where it says back in the Old Testament about this Emmanuel and you'll find it you won't find Emmanuel with an e in the Old Testament I'm just giving you something where that you can go back in it and you won't get lost like I have you know you you have to sit down and think wait a minute how come this is cuz in Isaiah it says I onto Emmanuel and over in Matthew it says e Emmanuel there's something to wake you up and make you think read your Bible read it for yourself and try to get an understanding out of it read it just like I said read this where it says I am that I am he had just told him that he was the I am of Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph and all like that and Moses ain't ready to go right but he says now give me his name then The Voice rings back to him to say I am that I am amen Moses said okay I'm ready to go why because he's getting an understanding amen he's getting something personal a revelation of God to himself more of understanding that's why it's not to try to pronounce names and that it's to try to get an understanding of what the revelation of that name means to you and bringing you to that situation all right so remember the I am at the burning bush the Jehovah the old became Jesus Christ am in the book of Acts right the angel of the Covenant was the Lord Jesus Christ who appeared to Moses from the burning bush the Bible says the angel of the Lord and he said I'll send my angel before thee I'll do that it's always talking about this Angel who is that angel he's the angel of the Covenant he's the one that appears then to and they talk about him in Acts s they pick it up and and start talking about this and who it who it really is because his name as I said they had many jesuses they had many jesuses back in the days of the Lord Jesus Christ but there was only one Lord Jesus Christ there was only one that would fit Emmanuel whether you want to spell it with an ey or an e it don't make no difference it's just a point of illustrating and see then you coming down to understand the point that you're trying to find that name then isn't it odd that when Jesus came what did he say I am come in my father's name who was he he was the I am he was Jehovah the Old Testament appearing as the Lord Jesus Christ in the New Testament of the meaning ever present for eternity and never will change that name why because that name is is a Perpetual name that's what your scripture says all right not I was but I am all right so then jvh interpreted now did you get the background or I need to r that again jvh interpreted is the name Jesus not jvh you pronounced remember where brother Bram was at about it when he was sitting there and he said the voice spoke Jehovah over the old is the Jesus of the new remember that's where the squirrels came into existence right keep reading and listening to the prophet that's when the squirrel started appearing the different things happening why because he was Jehovah the old see then now listen to what I'm getting at see then Jehovah the old would have his name could not be pronounced are as I said now not to just try to pronounce it but it could not be interpreted but when it came into the New Testament you could find the interpretation of it because his name is to be called Jesus now remember what we went through there in Matthew in chapter one or two every what it is where they'll call his name Jesus remember they italicized that they they bold lettered that to make it where you would see who it's talking about right see coming from just the name Jesus that would be anybody right J uh jvh I mean yeah Jesus there would be just anybody what's the number somebody pronounce that Spanish name the other day Yus Jesus whatever what it is when you call him Jesus see cuz you got you got the name Jesus but you're not getting to the person that the name is implying it comes to the New Testament and picks it up in bold letter Jesus call he will be the savior of his of the people it tells what that name is it tells you who you're looking for the Lord Jesus Christ amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's right amen his name is Jesus right okay may not click and wake up in you as much but it's your house to me because brother R said on adoption 19 paragraph 184 adoption 1960 The Only Name that God ever had amen right is Jesus right it took all of those years for that name to come into being not to just get to letters j s u not that you get it up every how You' do it in Spanish or Jesus or whatever you'd making but getting to understand the name Jesus I keep saying it that way because the Bible would say he'd be the one that would save his people and things like that cuz it's emphasizing a specific person and when that's specific person is emphasized in the New Testament then when the angel came to to marry to call his name Jesus the interpreters are the writers and things that brought it into our English language to understand they italicized those letters j s u s but not all the way through cuz there in one chapter you have j s us italicize right other words bold letters in a minute you'll have it just regular letters because it's according to what it's dealing with remember the key of what I said to start with on like Lord Jesus I mean Lord God you notice it read it when God is speaking when God was speaking to Cain look at the big bow letters that they've got there the Lord spoke to Cain the Lord spoke to Abel the Lord spoke to Abraham the Lord look at it but then after a while you'll find it in lower case or what you want to call it and it'll be l r d but it' be small letter see that's why the Bible says it the Lord capital l r d said unto my Lord Lor L O R D the Lord said unto my Lord that's not two people to me it's showing something when you're speaking when God is speaking from Heaven it they pick it up and they bring it into Bolder letters or more talisis letters orever what you want to call it in your English doings I'm not the major I'm just a preacher trying to get you to see a point those writers when they picked it up they knew what that meant they knew there was more from Genesis 1 where it would just be God than it was over in Genesis 2 to say Lord God they knew something had happened so you got Elohim then you got Jehovah Elohim do you understand you keep building it up it keeps understanding of the revelation of the name and when you come to the Lord Jesus Christ you've got the name of almighty God he said I come in my father's name name amen glory amen to what would be the father's name Jesus is his name I'm just trying to get you to read your Bible and look for yourself and see the emphasis of how this italicized enough to where you can say hey they made that bold enough for me to understand something is being under brought out in me remember it's not pronouncing it it's in an interpretation or an understanding or a revelation that's going with what that is or who that is is Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new the one true and living God am not no Trinity not no idea that's that Trinity is not even in your Bible well we've been talking that's right we've been taught like Wade was saying the other day about it the devil he knows for sure there's just one God he the Bible said and he feared he trembled he was afraid but then he turned around and taught me and you a trinity and laughed at us and we come out of it swearing by the TR great Trinity of the Bible when there's no such thing he's a triun being Father Son and Holy Ghost is not three people it's one person has a triun understanding from that and his name is Jesus amen now come on did Jesus was he wrong when he said I come in my father's name well that just meant the father sent him down well explain to me how that if you remember when he was talking to Moses he says Moses you he said come Moses he said I've heard of the crying of my people and come I'm going to send you well now how did he send Moses come on what's your prophet's interpretation of said where it says as my father had sent so send I you that's right what's that understanding so send I you what's his understanding of that he said the one that came down came down and went in him it went in him that's how you're sent that's how I born again believer is sent that's what it does it's God living in you Christ in you the hope of glory amen are you listening The Only Name then God ever had would be Jesus to fit the I am to where he could say I come in my father's name John 5:43 and how then he would be Hebrews 138 right the same yesterday today and forever when something is placed you know we're we're in English you start off every sentence with a capital letter not a capital word right not a capital word and I'm looking at one here where it says a n d see it's the capital A N D when you English part your when you start off a sentence you start it with a capital but then when you bringing it into the larger case letters you're more or less referring to that person that is being made known his name is Jesus that's too simple isn't it amen but see that affit every scripture there is in the Bible from the old all the way through into the new am now we can pronounce jvh his name is Jesus because he'll save his people right amen he is the Emmanuel of the Old Testament spelled with an i an e in the New Testament why I don't know don't worry I'm just illustrating it showing you that this appears here this appears here then it will help us to understand his name his name is Jesus now when something is placed within bold letters you're speaking of the person you're speaking of the person when it's placed in bold letters you're speaking to the person you're emphasizing or making sure that you're understood to to say this is who I'm talking about all right then you can drop back down like I said you can say the Lord said unto my Lord CU remember it was written in English times to where a lord could be the ruler of a place or this that or the other and God could say the Lord said unto my Lord this is easy because he could be using you he can use you to bring forth but it don't make you him right that's right now are you following me yeah amen I'm trying to preach today I believe I came in his name I'm trying to emphasize that point but I'm not the god of the letter so then if you put my name there in bold letter you've messed up that's why it say sometime even like in in uh there in in Exodus that the angel of the Lord will go it's not always in capital letters probably there not any time used in capital letters because you're referring to the angel of the Lord even though that angel of the Lord is the Lord Jesus Christ what he's doing are you listening what's taking place are going on when God is speaking to mankind it's in bold letters that's right l r d will be a capital g o d will be Capital cuz he's speaking to mankind but when he's using others to speak that you're talking to your children you can be to them a lord to them because you can help them understand they don't say Lord you know but you understand what I'm getting at I believe God came down in the last days used the prophet to bring a message amen but the messenger wasn't God that's right you know what I'm getting at the man himself that's right no he wasn't God all right but he was used yes he was used where brother Brown said it was so close he said the only technical difference was the physical body between him and you come on between you as a child of God and him as God himself the difference is the humanity of where we came and the way we came in and what took place so it would pay for us to take attention sometimes to little bitty ideas that might be able to come out to be something to understanding like I said there where in in Psalms it said the Lord said unto my Lord check that out it's l r d capital letters bold but then they say LD smaller case why because I can say to Donnie my Lord if we're speaking in King's English my Lord but I'm not calling him God that's right he's lower case right he's in God's stad for the time or being used fine amen but he's not in the uppercase all right isn't there something four Services ago I started out to bring out a little bitty point to try to get you to see who you are now did the prophet make this statement he said when the bride realizes who she is right and what she's here for am he said she'll be an invincible Army Satan will be powerless before her when she realizes who she is and what she's doing well what have I been preaching for not five or six months now that's right about the Bride of Jesus Christ right the Bride of Jesus Christ to bring her to a place of understanding like brother brand and I was just pulling up if you wanted I got it right in here where brother BR said you know the godhead is not complete without you that's right amen do you need that you need that quote from the prophet the godhead is not complete without you why because if you're part of God and if you have the new birth that new birth is part of God Amen that's right the new birth is part of God it's part of God living in US you realize what he done he imparted now he's not going to brother Mo said you ain't going to cut him up like an apple passie out to Pieces run out of apple don't never think about God like that what I like to think about him is if you could cut him up in pieces and passie him out as quick as you P him out you'd have another Apple you just you just run out yourself trying to cut it you can't do it cuz the more he the more he reveals himself the more he coming into perfect view of what he wants sir us to be to realize ourselves and to see what we're doing amen well let's just take a few little scriptures and then we'll try to end this series on so let's turn over to we go ahead we'll just use it off the screen go ahead to number nine brothers I bypassed a long way so you didn't have to use all that now we'll use 9 10 and 11 that you can read which will turn out to be uh 1 Timothy 6:13 all right now look I give thee charge in the sight of God who quickened all things and before Christ Jesus that's not two people see amen just showing you what's taking place who before Pilate witnessed a good confession that thou keep this commandment without spot unrebuked until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ now watch which in his times he shall s now somewhere through the travel of time somewhere through the emphasis of the travel of time this is going to take place which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate right now who is that the Lord Jesus Christ right now watch look at that potentate and who he is the king of kings and Lord of lords now if you're looking in your Bible or if you're looking on the screen look bring it back down because we want to keep it on this for a second notice okay little K notice L and little L right who in his time will show he's going to be the king of kings and Lord of lords now we know for certain he's the king that's right right amen we don't have no problem with that he's the king now who's the little case we know that he's the Lord but now who's the little Lords Lord see we don't have time to really get into the message I started this years ago and went for about 60 services on uh making five out of it I'm doing pretty good but if you ever studied Revelations 5 where there's a group of people there in Revelations 5 that are Kings and Priests do we need to read that from the Bible the Book of Revelation talks about a group of people that are Kings and Priests amen that's right that's the bride of Christ sir we're the little CS the little elves we're the Kings and the priest he's the Big K right amen and he's the only potentate the only one that can fit that amen he's Hebrews 13:8 he's the only place you can put him see then he's the K he's the Big K he's the Big King but who's the little C he's the Big L of the Lord but who is the little Lord amen his offspring his children amen we're going to call her by another name in a minute when we get call her a wife amen I'm just trying to make an emphasis on king of kings and Lord of lords read Revelations 5 where it says that we're priests and Kings yes with whatever he is amen Well's nothing in US worth anything the Bible said it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people the Sheep of his pasture it's not what we are is what he is amen he's the king of kings amen right Bible says in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let everything be established all right we can make it a whole lot more but now watch because knowing for certain who he who this is let's read verse 16 who only hath immortality dwelling in light which no man can approach unto so you know that's the Lord Jesus Christ are are you clear with that one amen he's the Big K we're the little K right yes sir he's the big Lord we're the little Lord right we're his offspring amen amen right right we're his offspring now listen while we're in this world we will remain his offspring and don't jump up too high because it won't fit [Music] you all right but do you understand what I'm getting at now which in his own times now he's going to show what he's going to show who is the blessed and only potentate he's going to show how it takes place that there's a k of King of Kings and then Lord of lords he's going to show the bride who she really is she's his wife that's right wife we talking about it the other day you you're a bride when you stand at the altar and say I do but then you become a wife amen that's right right a maturity stature of a perfect man okay we get into that we can go all right now look okay we got that one now go to the next one go to Revelation 17 number 10 these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful am it's Offspring that's right he's the king go to Revelations 5 when you get through today read it read Revelations 5 that we are be priests and kings let see just take that to bring it in that blessed only Pon show it show it in the end time where we know it the message has brought it to understand it who he is but who we are right to know who he is is one thing wonderful but to know who we are that's right yes sir that's right come on what did Moses do Moses went down to Egypt Pharaoh said who in the world is this guy that sent you down here he said I'm just not going to tell you that way I'm going to say I'm I'm going to take the children out cuz I am going to do it right amen and it was so personal it didn't make him the God but it made him the second person right there ain't no way of saying it that way cuz it ain't right made him the person of God in another form the angel of the Lord in another form now look pick it up a little further now and these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and King of Kings Big K little K Big L little L same thing of that it is over there in Timothy but now he explains who it is and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful right that's his bride that's his wife right now come on let's go one more Revelations 19 okay now let's read this one Revelations 19 and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude who is this and as the voice of many Waters Waters his people who is this and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying Allelujah for the Lord God look at it omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready now you've got her involved in this whether you would think of it in the other two cases or not but now you got her there called his cing wife come on and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine lining cleaning white for the fine lining is the righteousness of the Saints watch it in a minute later on now and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he sath unto me these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy now watch and I saw heaven opened Revelation 19 brother brandham said is the Bride of Jesus Christ riding back into the millennial reign as the anointing to the temple now that is Daniel 70 weeks in the message the bride is returning back she is the anointing to the temple amen look and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that set upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crayons and he had a name written now this is revelation not now that no man knew but he himself okay and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God right and the armies which were in heaven followed after followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean white and clean linen back up our a minute ago so this is who the Bride riding back into the Millennium now listen and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should Smite the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he threat the wine press with the fierceness of the wrath of almighty God and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written now look in your Bible to make sure that that's right on this screen Big K Big K right King of Kings amen Lord capital l d stays capital l d you remember what we was covering King of Kings Big K little K Lord L O R D Lord Big L little L that's the bride that's what we you I hope you agreed with that point up to there look at the supernatural Revelation now that you're looking at as she's riding into the Millennium she has whatever name he has right cuz she's his wife right his name is Jesus so our name is Jesus right now if he comes up with a new name everybody in the message holler we're going to get a new name well that's all right I ain't never argue with nobody because I ain't worried about it I ain't exhausted the name of Jesus yet when that's true I'll be ready to go on because the next name can't be nothing in Redemption cuz Jesus is the name of Redeemer that's right amen and get that point Jesus is the name of Redeemer so whatever his name is is a redeemer if you got a new name coming that's fine that's all right but remember whatever it is at this time is riding into the Millennium she has done went to the marriage supper she done spent that time and she's riding back into the Millennium to be anointing to the temple riding with him and he recognizes her not as just to be a uh something he chose the other is the choosing we're chosen in him amen we're his children amen Big K little K we're his children we're his offspring now he brings it all to one emphasis bold letter look in your Bible bold letter king of kings and Lord of lords cuz he and the bride have both become one she's his wife amen the wife has the name of the husband so whatever his name is that's what my name is and until it runs out it stays Jesus and I ain't going to argue with you you start telling me well a brother down here has had the new name I want to hear it and I want to see it in the word you want to see it in signs and wonders you want to see if this brother over here they done it right after brother Brandon P off the scene come on I know a little bit brother r passed off the scene there was a group of people that were welln named went over to another man's meetings to see what kind of signs and wonders he was having why did I care what he was having I wasn't there to do it but I'm just saying it that way why do I care I don't care about signs and wonders I've preached that all of my life in this message the Bible says the prophet show you a sign and and it come to pass you better believe it right but now read the other one where he said if a prophet shows you a sign and it comes to pight but he takes you to another God said don't believe him said cuz I sent him among you to try you I'm going to try my wife brother R said the bride would be tried to prove that she would not fall like Eve fell in the garden where did she fall Hebrews 138 that's what he said she failed on Hebrews 138 to keep him the same when we get it to the basis that he's the same all the way amen you're not afraid of none of this stuff going on here no I say it's going to get worse the prophet said it so what are we worried about it but we ought to be like I told my wife yesterday or Wade was talking yesterday we ought to be the happiest people in the world that's right it shouldn't have to be that we have to tell people and you know I'm going to say this and leave it I am not going to call any of you and invite you to church I told you that to start with when this started with this 911 amen I mean not 911 I can't what is it Lily where you at I can't this this viruses I told you then I said we're going to have a church on a volunteer basis you remember that cuz it's like some of them said you know will they were to do this with with the governor of Georgia they do this with the president because of what he's doing he's doing his job that's right you realize you could tell me the same thing if I called you and invited you to come to church I will not call you if I know you're sick I'll call you if I know you're sick I'll call you but I'm not going to call you and invite you to church you're going to come on your own accord or not come cuz this is not a basis of trying to build some kind of something this is a basis of free moral agents yes sir amen you say are you talking about some of these I'm talking about the truth I'm telling it like it is from my side of the story CU if I called you up if I called up brother Mark and said brother Mark we missed you at church you ought to come then he could sue me for getting him involved in some kind of a deal that the people could be sick all around him then he could sue me for calling him I ain't going to do it but we're going to see who's who right right cuz we never missed the service yet amen right right amen than you Lord daughter asked me said Daddy what are we going to do I said we're going to church amen she looked over at her husband and said that settled that now that's the truth that's what happened I solved that problem we ain't missed a service so far amen you think this is the the persecution no this is the volunteer basis that you're giving up your rights every day oh they're getting you so involved come on they done got you with about how many kids about $2,500 that they shoved into his pocket ain't nobody send it back right and you that are against Trump I ain't for need nobody I'm making myself plain but if you don't like Trump you ought to send the money back I ain't going to do it but then keep the money come on I've got some quotes from The Prophet where he said keep your home and take the of the earth be become a Catholic that's the way the wording to you all right I'm not trying to be anything I'm just trying to be honest we didn't get into this by being anything nobody's begged anybody to come to church to get you to come here you're welcome to come here amen glad to have you but I'm just pling I'm sorry you w not be supplying okay maybe that's true cuz you see when you start dealing with money you going to get in people's pocket and you're going to get them in your hand then let's see how many sends back there how is it my neighbor says it he he says stimulus stimulous money ain't nobody going to send it back I ain't either why cuz I'm going to enjoy it if he's dumb enough to give it to me I'm going to spend it that's what he wants me to do anyway that's right he wants the economy to move right hey we get it to moving yeah but that's what now remember I didn't say this I didn't say this but he did Trump said it he said make sure you pay your tithe but I'll tell you one thing you better be careful from now on now I'm dead serious now get you to life get you to understand but I'm dead serious the Bible said and the prophet said he'll come in by flattery right don't get caught by all these things that's taking place that's right it'll come in by flattery you're going to invite him in amen that's what I said I said this ain't the the the persecution no no they ain't against it look at what he said look at what the man got up and said he said if you're going to open the bars and the nightclubs he said I'm opening the churches and if there any trouble he said come to me now but he must have some Authority cuz he said if you got any trouble you come to me well I agree with him if you're going to open up the bars and the thing well brother D we can't go to church I'm just talking I got a little it's 11:30 but you can put on a mask and go to Walmart yeah right that's right but I ain't going to church you put on a mask and go to Walmart don't you put on the mask and go to church that's right you know in some states it's it's against the law to go to out without a mask well I agree with it we're trying to do everything we can do to try to be you know honor to what's going on but then one day when it comes down to it what's it going to be next you realize they were so close there a few months ago that if they' have said no churches you realize that's all he had to say no churches what if he does it again what we going to do what if they demand we close the doors and they make them a storehouse for what they want we'll face that day when we get there until we do we will spend his money and enjoy what we're doing and have a good time in Jesus Christ and serve the Lord because we know the end of the story if you're listening to what I said right we start started out with this series in the Old Testament brought it all the way through coming through in the New Testament wind up and not at the end because the end of it but the end is the end of the the basics of the Bride because she just from there on out she's it goes into the Israel amen but then we ride back in the Millennium Amen on them white horses with him dressed in fine linen just like he's dressed and whatever his name is will be our name amen you say well what is it I don't know there's no need to worry about wanting to know it brother R said it may be made known when you get there now that's the only words I've got I'm not interpreting nothing I'm just saying that's what he said cuz ain't no need to worri about it right just be happy and thank God for him revealing the truth to us you realize what it would be if he hadn't Reve reveal this message to us you realize where we would be we would be just like they are right now around the world they're arguing and they'll they'll just dump their whole religious freedom and everything right into the hands of somebody down the road from now but what are you going to do well they going to arrest you oh Paul he stayed a few nights in jail yeah but you ain't Paul I see I ain't Paul I ain't trying to be but there's one thing about it one of these days we're going to find out what we are right we're going to see what we are but you know what this is when you're getting ready right cuz my Bible says if you can't keep up with a footman what about when the horsemen get here right that's the Bible plainly saying if you can't live now a Christian Life what's going to happen if persecution comes your way if you can't live right now as a Christian there has never been a question in my mind since the beginning of all of the even the Baptist I was ready to go to church am we went to church we didn't take if we take a vacation now it's related around something our clo close to it or whatever we're trying to do because this is all I've got Christianity is all I've got but you know what that's all I want I don't want your money and your doing I want a people that are all dedicated to one thing CU I will tell you this the Wednesday night service after they declared this situation and kind of put a little Stamper on the church thing I sat right there in the study and watched and counted I thought Lord there'll probably be 20 here hey I'm honest I don't well you're not talking about me like that hey you talk about me all you want to so don't worry about it I sat there and I counted I counted 80 something people cuz I didn't announce whether we was going to have service that Wednesday or not I never announced on Sunday we was going to have Wednesday Services I deliberately never

she appears anymore after then it'll be at the white throne with him sitting on the throne what about it come on musicians thank on these things amen can you put your name in there cuz that king of kings and Lord of lords at all capital right but now I'm going to say it to you so listen so then with Moses at the burning bush because he wrote the books of the Bible right five of them Moses wrote five books of the Bible from then on it was records of prophets and this doing that and that doing that and this taking place and the children of Israel and where they were doing and different thing but they started out and him writing those books and he put his final stamp on it when he said Moses I'm going to tell you my name he said okay tell me your name and I'll go to Egypt he said I am
