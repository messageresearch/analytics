TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so they go all around the world they can't find anybody they ask me really doing a good job he's taking us last week he took us to the stars the galaxies and but uh today i'm going to bring it down down to earth a little bit i'm just uh speculating expect a sin on the beast compared to brother bob so uh i'm gonna try and talk about signs and prophecies of the end time so let's go to matthew 12 38 to 40. then serna describes and the first answer saying master we will see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterer generation seek that to sign and there's no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas for jonas was three days and three nights in that whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth the man i never shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented repented that preaching and join us and be hell and greater than jonas is here and brother and sister brother brother i said there was a sign of the resurrection okay let's go to matthew 24 3. 243 and as he said upon the man all of this disciples came onto him probably saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of the coming and of the end of the world and at the bottom of schofield bible scofield kind of explains it he said when shall these things be said the destruction of that temple and the city that's one and the second and third is a two-fold he said and what shall be the sign of the coming and at the end of the age it has a double interpretation interpretation it says the the character of the age verses international conflicts famous pestilence and persecutions and the false prophet in the maze in the message the voice of the sign programmer said uh says now we find out that god gave most of the signs to improve claims and callings and every true sign every true sign that's sent from god as the voice behind it says no don't fail this is my last lesson on this every true sign now we have signs that that's not from god satan can almost impersonate anything there is but a true sign sent from god has the voice of god behind god said to moses if you won't believe the voice of the first sign then do this other sign before them and they they don't hear that just take water and pour it upon the ground hear this and that was a sign that they was that they would be drenched in their own blood so god gives signs to attract the attention of his people signs to attract the attention of god's people and watched the voice that followed sign was a scriptural voice he said i have heard the cries of my people and their drawings because of the taskmasters and remain and i remember my promise that settles it i remember the promise that was a scriptural sign and i'm sending you down there they come down to deliver them and i'm sending you see but god is trying to attract the prophet now and he gives him a sign and a voice that followed the sign was a scriptural voice he said i have seen that people have heard or they're crying i remember my promise now god is going to speak by his promised word he must send his prophet for the word comes to the prophet the bible said god said himself that he does not nothing until he reveals it unto his servants and prophet see and then the sign is given and the scripture is identified that's the voice of the sign he said again the comment of a prophet is assigned did you know that the commander of the prophet to the age is a sign i said i don't mean a doctor a divinity i don't mean a loyal pastor some good person that is fine name is god's servant but a prophet is a sign the bible says and what's the sign of it it's a sign that his word is fixing to fulfill be fulfilled by the voice of the prophet's sign notice the comment of a prophet that warning sign of judgment at hand did you know that judgment judgment is ready to strike if there's a prophet in the land remember he is certainly first cut to be vindicated by god and the word for that day and that he does the sign and that watch that sign what it predicts he said it comes to pass and hear him and if it doesn't come to pass forget it it's got to be a scriptural sign that he gives he said noah was a prophet on the land in the land of a sign of coming judgment moses was a prophet in the land the sign of the coming judgment elijah the prophet in the land of common judgment john a prophet in the land of sign coming judgment to israel they were already cut off another sign what what are the signs the sign is to attract attention and get the elected ready and out of the way before the judgment strikes that's what we want to do get ready for the judgment strikes that's what noah did he got directed ready the rest of them and what does he do the sign and the boys of the sign condemns the unbeliever and gets him ready for judgment gets the elected ready for the escape that's what the sign is that's what the signs are given for for the coming judgment to elect them i see it in the very judgment they say moses condemned the world he's preaching it gets the electorate what is elected ready for when they see a god sign send sign they look back in the scripture and see that they're supposed to be there yeah here it is what is it pending judgment then the elected listens to the voice but the unelected ignores and said nonsense go on we'll take the same old school see that's the way they did in that they used to look through that that's the way they did in the days of wesley that's the way they do now the way they always go and the message that true sign that's overlooked said man has sought for signs all the way from pharaoh until today and jesus and jesus told us a time there will be secrets of signs and said that a wickedness and adulterous generation would seek after sign but yet they would receive a sign and that generation was to receive a sign of the restoration which would be a week and a week and a weekend adulterer generation will be given a sign of the resurrection he said even the pharisees that the day that jesus showed us he said they said show us a sign from heaven but jesus referred to them that they would get a sign you already got a sign said you can discern the skies you can look at the sign you say if it's red and lauren tomorrow will be fall weather if they would look at the sign they have looked at him and knew that he was god's sign to them because their prophecies concerning him was being fulfilled before their eyes but they still look for sign this day the scriptures fulfilled he says no there's a great sign the jews are in their homeland they have their own nation money army jesus said learn a parable of fig tree in the mark of the beast he said if you want to see what day of the month it is look on the calendar if you want to see what day in the season it is at the coming of the lord watch where israel is saying that's because time peace there she is satan in her own land the oldest flag in the world that six point star of david the oldest flag in the world flies again for that first time for 2500 years yes sir gabriel's instruction to daniel i don't want to step on brother dale when i am out there john daniel this scripture the seven weeks it closes discloses until exactly from the time that daniel started there until the end of the consummation he says one of the greatest timepieces how many heard me say if you want to know what day of the week it is look at the counter if you want to know what time we're living in what's the jews that's right that's there's god's calendar taken from right here any theologian any bible scholar anyone will tell you that this is the timepiece the jews now we're in a better greatest battle we ever fought but just think of israel from the beginning there's always somebody trying to start a war room you know let's go to first games 20. first one to 14. and that hadn't the king of this syria gather all his souls together and there were 30 and two kings with him and horses and chariots and he went up and we see samaria and warned against it and he sent messengers to ahab which he was the king of israel then king of israel into the city and said unto him god said then hayden thy silver and that goal is mine my wives also and my children even godless are mine and the king of israel answered and said my lord o king according to the same i'm dying and all that i had i'll give you everything i get everything i got i'll give it to you and the messengers came again and said thus speaketh manhattan although i have said unto thee saying thou shalt deliver me thy silver and i go and my wives and our children yet will i send my servants unto thee tomorrow about this time and they shall search thy house and the houses of our servant and hiv that whatever is pleasant in their eyes they shall put it in their hand and take it away more they wanted more whatever they could find take it you know then the king of israel called all the elders of the man and said mark i pray you and see how this man's secret mischief for he has sent unto me for my wives and for my children for my silver and for my goal and i deny him not and all the elders and all the people said unto him heart cannot unto him nor consent wherefore he said unto the messengers abandoned tell my lord the king all that god you sent for the servant at first i would do but this thing i may not do and the messengers departed and brought him word again and they had ben hayden stand unto him and said the gods do still sow unto me and more also in the dust that samara satisfies for handfuls for all the people that follow me and the king of israel answered and said tell him let not him the gird on his harness boost both himself as he had that put it off and he came to pass when that man hadn't heard this matches message as he was drinking he and the kings and the pavilions that he said unto his servant set yourself in a ray and they said themselves and array against the city but god gives them the victory and behold there came a prophet unto ahab king of israel saying thou said the lord has not seen all this great multitude behold i will deliver unto thy dying hand this day and i shall know that i am the lord and i have said by whom and he said thus saith the lord even by the young man of the princes of the prophetesses that he said who shall order battle and he answer thou brother branham said uh well whatever israel uh so he has to read you know he's gonna hold him a convo but just like david he's still uh israel's still god's chosen people you know no matter what and uh like i said we're in a battle greatest battle i ever thought just think of them you know every little bitty country like right now they're trying to wipe the ezreal off the map i was reading on that on the on the right i was hurting at her in the radio where we were talking about it since they started this conflict 80 000 missiles or bombs they've been dropping it israel that's twice as many as they did in world war ii but i think israel has that technology to kind of blow some up before they get there but still just thank you uh at your house you're waiting for any bombs come in and hit my backyard or hit my house or something you know so you know but god's going to take care of him okay let's go to daniel 12 4. um there daniel 12 4 but thou or daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall increase you know me i always do the latest on what the laser technology so he said imagine a fire fighter that can fly a low level close air support missile mission delivering his weapons on target and then perform a full dog fight before returning to base imagine this level of combat flying with without a pilot in a cockpit a pilot pilotless f-16 has become a reality but not for long the program was in with engineers at edwards at first base were well on their way to perfecting this pilot step 16 when funding for the program was cancelled this was in the 90s so they probably already have it by now just think uh ryan has one of the little airplanes that he fights with remote control but these with a click of a mouse you can just send it with no no pilot in it and uh i don't know if they said uh when the future is coming they would have the airliners delta whatever no pilot on it but i don't think they would like that who's going to say it look i'm not bored israel and so-and-so we've been landing this for 20 minutes so how's that going to sound a lot of the technology they're already using it you know the enemy afghanistan they uh they dropped supplies and a helicopter we don't pilot on it so the technology is there they're using it on some but like i say i don't know that was in the 90s this uh thing right here y'all heard about the google car yeah uh the law was best it was okay and now let's see uh nevada i think was first and then california actually where's like three states it's okay for them to drive a car with no uh no driver like i said that technology helps but people that are blind by the way i was talking about this this guy that drove to taco bell in order and then they finally the people realized that he was blind and no you know blind and actually i think they only had like two accidents one time a driver was driving it and when the google car got an accident that that driver wasn't there it wasn't driving it was driving by itself the google car was stuck at a stop light and somebody came and hit him right behind so but the latest technology is uh vehicles that communicate with each other they uh they use like cell phone towers uh wire sensors in the road so the cars ahead of you or something he'll let you know there's a ice on the road or the accident or something you know so so i have all the airflow in case all you want to look at this but uh where are we at because brother branham had that vision of the choir yeah the families playing games that would be nice good thing yeah in the message the voice of the sign he said i said such progress will take place i said see ottoman automobiles looking like an a going down the street there's cars going on the highway with some kind of a control they don't have to guide it i seen an american family playing checkers in the back of the car they got the car right now it they just had if they just had the highways to put on it what was i talking about the sensors oh yeah so she brought brother brown knew about all this that was coming you see the little volkswagen is perfect it's perfect like an egg just accept it as it is all the other cars could you imagine in 1933 what the cars look like now but uh a lot of these uh technology is so expensive like the f-16 that that's why they've canceled that yeah that project is so expensive you know but i guess google's got a lot of money i don't know okay that's it thank you thank you you want money first i
