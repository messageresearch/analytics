[16:49] man good to be in the house of the Lord
[16:51] again good to be back thank you for your
[16:55] prayers we had a real good time in
[16:57] Kentucky and Illinois Jim got to was
[17:05] privileged to be at a hunting camp we're
[17:08] just guys there weren't any guys there
[17:10] but she saw how guys lived when there's
[17:13] no girls around
[17:14] so she cleaned the place up part of it
[17:19] anyway so a man a man good to be here
[17:25] good to be back good to be in the house
[17:26] with Lord good to have each and every
[17:27] one of you here you got your Bibles
[17:30] let's go ahead and turn to the Book of
[17:31] Revelations 8 verse 1 and we're gonna
[17:35] speak today on three poles we're talking
[17:41] about less Sonny will kind of catch a
[17:43] little bit of it this Sunday I want to
[17:46] try to get finished we've got next
[17:47] Sunday we got brother Jul here then the
[17:50] next Sunday I'll be in Arizona and the
[17:55] end of this month and August we've got
[17:56] all kinds of scheduling going on we've
[18:01] already got August almost full with
[18:02] brothers coming from foreign countries
[18:04] so we get to take a little break but I
[18:07] hope we can get finished with the
[18:08] seventh seal by then because I'd like to
[18:10] start on Daniel 70 weeks so we want to
[18:14] do it like we did downstairs and take it
[18:18] from a Jewish perspective because it is
[18:20] for the to the Jews it's not to us it is
[18:23] to the Jews we get a spiritual
[18:24] application of it but we've been over it
[18:26] I was looking back on the computer and
[18:30] we'd started doing doing the series in
[18:33] 2006 wow that's a long time ago
[18:37] so that identity since 1974 but we all
[18:40] kind of went through a cycle and then we
[18:42] went downstairs and did it two years ago
[18:46] we will we will Lord willing when we get
[18:49] finished here with the Seventh Seal
[18:51] we'll we'll start on Daniel seventy week
[18:53] so just keep us in your prayers and you
[18:56] know what to do pray the guard to give
[18:58] us a revelation of what's going on in
[19:01] the world we got earthquakes in divers
[19:03] places we got all these different things
[19:06] go we got a new election coming up we
[19:07] got a lot of things moving and shaking
[19:09] so 2019 is going to shape up to be a to
[19:15] be a year to remember I think I think
[19:18] we've grown in Revelation which to me
[19:20] that's the most important I don't care
[19:21] for California falls off them to the
[19:25] moon and I really don't care but as long
[19:26] as you've got a good revelation he'll
[19:28] hold you during the time of all this
[19:31] confusion that's going on everywhere
[19:33] else so god bless you remember each and
[19:36] every one to sake remember brother Boyd
[19:38] he's hurting a little bit today so we
[19:42] pray this to him Lord would bless him
[19:44] and and totally healing before the
[19:46] service is over with
[19:47] amen some nomads that's right this is
[19:54] the place to feel good you know this is
[19:56] the place to feel better here this is
[19:58] the place to come to if you feel bad you
[20:01] need them you need a new birth you know
[20:03] if you feel bad if you feel good then
[20:05] take that new birth and apply it to your
[20:07] body
[20:07] and let it let it yield to what's
[20:11] already inside of you all right so
[20:13] that's what we're we're looking for is
[20:16] for that inside man to take over mmm
[20:19] because by the new birth he's already
[20:21] there so we ain't gonna go get him or go
[20:25] find him he's already there so let's bow
[20:27] our heads and get started
[20:29] tell me Father we thank you Lord for
[20:31] this day we thank you for these
[20:33] wonderful people Lord they're the most
[20:36] special people in the face of the earth
[20:38] because they're your bride Lord they're
[20:40] the ones that had been chosen before the
[20:43] foundation of the world and you saw them
[20:44] sitting here hearing the word and how
[20:48] they would respond you knew all that
[20:49] before the foundation of the world so
[20:52] lord I pray that we'll all truly listen
[20:55] and hear from you today Lord and as
[20:57] Dwight Moody always says
[20:59] it says you'll fill those Lord who are
[21:02] not full of their self so let's get
[21:04] ourselves out of the way and let you
[21:06] come in and take over Lord you do the
[21:08] speaking you do the hearing you do the
[21:09] revealing father we got you just be with
[21:12] the ones that are sick the ones that are
[21:13] not here brother dick brother Colley
[21:15] brother Daugherty sister Johnny the ones
[21:18] that are not with us Lord we pray that
[21:19] you just touch their body the ones that
[21:22] are here Lord by the board certain ones
[21:24] that are going through different things
[21:25] here little situations of life because
[21:28] of the fall but Lord you said you would
[21:32] restore you said I will restore so Lord
[21:36] we pray that you'll do that today father
[21:38] just restore everything back Lord we
[21:40] pray Lord that you just be with us in
[21:42] our journey be with the missionaries on
[21:44] the foreign fields give them fruit for
[21:45] their labor Lord the prejudiced you just
[21:47] bless us now take care of us lead us and
[21:49] guide us by your love and jesus name we
[21:51] pray amen
[21:52] and when he had opened the Seventh Seal
[21:54] There was silence in heaven about the
[21:57] space of half an hour
[21:58] Eirene John 19 when Jesus therefore had
[22:01] received the vinegar he said it is
[22:03] finished and he bowed his head and gave
[22:05] up the ghost now Ephesians 4:30 and
[22:07] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[22:09] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[22:14] redemption you may be seated in the Lord
[22:16] adds blessing to the reading of the word
[22:18] now I want to I want to go back to that
[22:22] Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy
[22:23] Spirit of God whereby you're sealed
[22:25] until the day of redemption now what
[22:28] brother Dale was preaching he's trying
[22:29] to get us all sealed once he gets us all
[22:33] sealed in then you've sealed Satan out
[22:36] but we still have a work to do in the
[22:38] spirit realm it moves out into the
[22:41] spirit realm you don't have to go
[22:42] through justification if you that's why
[22:44] the Bible says those who he's justified
[22:46] he's already glorified you don't have to
[22:48] go through that baby form of
[22:49] justification ever again because that
[22:51] person inside of you that comes and
[22:53] gives you the new birth they never seem
[22:54] to start with so there's no
[22:56] justification that you have to go
[22:59] through again as far as that's concerned
[23:01] but you do have to go through a
[23:03] justification in the next realm or the
[23:06] spirit realm because today what we're
[23:09] going to try to talk about is a
[23:10] three-fold manner that this seventh sea
[23:13] was opened up to the Prophet and I want
[23:15] to read you a few quotes and get you
[23:17] started but look at these threes
[23:19] everything's in three threefold minor
[23:21] three the sixth seal had had three
[23:24] different parts to it
[23:26] mmm your new birth has three different
[23:29] parts to it because three is what its
[23:32] perfection so God is perfected not God
[23:35] is perfected in threes your perfected in
[23:38] God in threes God doesn't need
[23:40] perfection hey man he's already perfect
[23:44] but for him to bring you to perfection
[23:46] he does it in three folds or three ways
[23:49] called justification sanctification in
[23:51] the baptism of Holy Ghost all right and
[23:53] for us to be able to understand him
[23:56] that's the way he's working and the way
[23:58] he works it never changes so we're
[24:01] talking about this morning a Bible study
[24:03] at once God does something he's got to
[24:05] do it the same way every time so the the
[24:07] problem we have with us humans is that
[24:10] we have so much change in our life that
[24:13] we think God changes God doesn't change
[24:17] you can depend on what he said in this
[24:21] word from now until eternity you just
[24:25] keep on going he's going to be the same
[24:27] yesterday today and forever there's your
[24:30] three fold same yesterday
[24:31] you got threes coming up so now we look
[24:34] and we know that that brother brown said
[24:37] that this seventh seal opened in a
[24:39] three-fold manner and before we get
[24:41] started let me read you the definition
[24:42] of fold fold is to lay one part over
[24:47] another all right you understand what
[24:50] I'm saying fold when you fold something
[24:51] you lay one part over the other all
[24:54] right we used to fold a map for those of
[24:57] us that are old enough to remember we
[24:59] used to have physical maps and we folded
[25:02] them all right now Google Maps doesn't
[25:06] do that anymore but now remember you've
[25:09] got to look at one thing as far as our
[25:11] computers go it is in layers already are
[25:14] in folds you got things running behind
[25:18] other things so you've got them in folks
[25:21] or what's happening is there's something
[25:22] going on and then there's something
[25:25] going on underneath
[25:26] same way with God we see that we see God
[25:29] moving and he might be moving brother
[25:31] Boyd in in justification he might be
[25:33] with brother Martin sanctification but
[25:35] it's all God and he's working in a fold
[25:38] of a way to where that he's getting what
[25:41] he needs he's getting what he needs
[25:42] everybody's getting what their need
[25:44] their needs are met but you know why
[25:47] they're met they're met because of your
[25:49] desire it all hinges on you God will
[25:52] never open your brain and pour it down
[25:56] he only goes by what you desire that's
[26:00] what I told him this morning I'm gonna
[26:02] tell you all sitting here today if
[26:03] you're not going to church as much as
[26:06] you were two years ago you need the new
[26:09] birth you are lost the Bible says and
[26:14] more as the day approaches what's wrong
[26:19] with that sly brother Dale says you tell
[26:22] the Holy Ghost field woman Holy Ghost
[26:24] Phil one won't wear a pair of pants well
[26:25] if you put on a pair of pants or if you
[26:26] cut your hair you don't have the Holy
[26:28] Ghost it's just real ABC if you don't
[26:32] have more desire to come here like last
[26:35] night in a Bible study fifty something
[26:37] people and I know there's things to do
[26:42] life and all but still what's your
[26:45] desire you got a lot of time to do the
[26:49] things of the world yeah you got about
[26:52] six days to do the things of the world
[26:54] give God a couple of days and I'll
[26:56] promise you some of your problems that
[26:58] you have will go away you got money
[27:02] problems
[27:03] you're not tithing if you know if you
[27:08] got problems in your spiritual life you
[27:10] must not be praying enough you must not
[27:12] be reading your Bible enough you must
[27:13] not be coming to church enough that's
[27:16] pretty simple pray and read your Bible
[27:18] brother Brown I mean you know we try to
[27:20] we bring these great things out and we
[27:22] see that we're on the Seventh Seal which
[27:24] is the greatest the greatest happening
[27:26] since the dawn of time is that God's got
[27:28] a group of people here that he's trying
[27:29] to show what he's already done now what
[27:32] he's going to do what he's already done
[27:34] and he's doing it in your life now if
[27:37] you'll let him do it
[27:40] you can stop dart at any time that's why
[27:45] I love what brother Bram said about the
[27:47] holy ghost said the holy ghost was the
[27:48] gentleman he will not kick your door
[27:50] down and go into a door that you shut in
[27:54] your life if you shut a door and don't
[27:55] want him to go in that room he will not
[27:57] go in that room now that what strange to
[28:01] me is he knows what's in that room
[28:03] he knows what your problem is but if you
[28:06] don't open the door he's not gonna go in
[28:08] there because of what your free moral
[28:11] agency you are a free moral agent you
[28:14] decide whether you keep on going or you
[28:17] decide whether you stop it's all up to
[28:19] you
[28:20] you can't blame God you can't blame
[28:25] nobody but yourself
[28:26] I don't blame nobody but me for the
[28:28] problems that I have because you know
[28:30] what I live with it and I probably are
[28:32] the one that caused most of it like
[28:36] 99.999999 9 there's a little anomaly in
[28:39] there everyone's want somebody may cause
[28:40] you a problem but usually it's your
[28:42] fault amen so feel if you'll do that and
[28:46] just keep it in that lathe and
[28:47] everything will be fine
[28:48] but what are we doing here now are we
[28:50] coming up to this time now we see
[28:52] earthquakes we see all these things
[28:54] different things that are coming on the
[28:56] world yet we're still not wanting it was
[28:58] still just we just don't come to church
[29:00] and don't you know we just don't study
[29:02] don't read don't what are we doing do
[29:07] you think just one day God's gonna just
[29:09] walk in here and just gonna pour water
[29:11] over all of us and we're just gonna get
[29:13] it that's not his way of doing things
[29:16] that's not his way just like we were
[29:18] talking about this morning God couldn't
[29:21] give Martin Luther what we have today it
[29:24] would have choked him that was afraid of
[29:28] a sentence it's Frater was was tough
[29:30] said she said well that just answers my
[29:31] question well well I mean you don't you
[29:33] know you don't take little William or
[29:35] any little babies back here we're gonna
[29:37] go eat at Cracker Barrel no not a
[29:40] Cracker Barrel nevermind Lord
[29:41] sorry no a lot what's wrong with that
[29:44] but anyway if we go take the little baby
[29:48] somewhere we say okay we're gonna go to
[29:49] Longhorns and we're gonna give him a
[29:51] steak well now he's a human he could
[29:55] take the steak but it probably would
[29:57] kill him cuz he would choke on it has no
[30:00] teeth and that's what you are with God
[30:01] when you're a but spirit babe in Christ
[30:03] God knows you don't have teeth God knows
[30:06] you need to be spoon-fed you need to
[30:08] have stuff chewed up and fed to your
[30:10] little piece at a time
[30:11] well that's the way it is same way with
[30:13] the with a natural birth brother Dale's
[30:16] trying to get us all born again amen and
[30:20] then we can eat little pieces until we
[30:23] get to a place to where I mean God
[30:26] forbid we've been in this message for 50
[30:27] years and we can't eat meat you ought to
[30:31] be able to eat meat and it not choke you
[30:35] the 11th hour worker got paid the same
[30:39] amount of money for one hour of work as
[30:44] the people that worked in 11 hours till
[30:49] that levinthal worker comes in and he
[30:50] got the same wage why because God's
[30:54] doing a work he's really giving it to us
[30:56] he's giving it to us in abundance but
[30:59] he's chewing it up by fivefold ministry
[31:01] giving it out to the people or even in
[31:04] song and then all the different than
[31:06] going give yourself a hand clap because
[31:08] it's for you you know it's for you it's
[31:09] not not nothing special in our book I
[31:13] mean come on brother now spent 5060
[31:16] years studying this message while we I
[31:21] say we me went out 20 years in the world
[31:24] wasted God's time right amen
[31:31] we've all wasted our time somewhere in
[31:34] times past well this you know what we're
[31:35] running out of time because a Seventh
[31:38] Seal is the end of time of all things
[31:40] it's coming up to a place to wear this
[31:42] thing you know you think wow grandma
[31:45] said it was coming fifty years ago and
[31:47] grandma's grandma said it was coming
[31:49] fifty years ago and grandmas grandma
[31:51] grandma said well Jesus is coming any
[31:54] moment
[31:54] well you
[31:55] what this is the moment I don't see any
[31:59] other thing that's gonna give us another
[32:00] 50 years or another five years maybe
[32:03] okay or another one year if God wants to
[32:06] do a work real quick he's going to do a
[32:07] work real quick but we need to see this
[32:10] in a simplified form to where when
[32:13] brother Graham talks to the Seventh Seal
[32:15] we say well it's so great people's made
[32:16] it this and they made it that they made
[32:18] it polygamy they made it and you all the
[32:21] false doctrines you just name them and
[32:24] that's what comes they said well that's
[32:25] the Seventh Seal and then you know you
[32:27] got you got some people that did think
[32:31] the seven seals not open and you got
[32:33] some people think so it is and then
[32:35] ain't and well we're gonna read some
[32:37] quotes here from me but let's look at
[32:38] number one I left just background a
[32:40] little bit just for a second number one
[32:43] says he breaks the seal reveals we've
[32:45] read these but we're going to keep
[32:46] reading them because it it ought to set
[32:48] your mind in order for what we're coming
[32:50] to hear he breaks the seals he breaks
[32:52] the seals okay
[32:55] reveals gives us his inheritance to his
[32:57] people now you know what the opening
[32:59] these seals are it's not to get you born
[33:02] again it's not please realize one
[33:09] thing's for sure more people are going
[33:13] to be born again that don't know one
[33:15] thing about a seal than they are that is
[33:19] if I understand that
[33:21] Paul Iranians Martin Columba Luther
[33:26] Wesley Pentecost and even in brother
[33:29] branham's day have not had the seals
[33:31] open just like you and I have had them
[33:33] open right okay so this is a specialist
[33:37] tell them downstairs this morning this
[33:38] is your a special group of people you're
[33:41] the only people friend Freda said why
[33:47] didn't he just give it all to Martin
[33:48] Luther I said because the one thing you
[33:53] you take your finger this is the reason
[33:56] that Martin Luther didn't get everything
[33:58] and went in a rapture this is the reason
[34:01] John Wesley did not get everything and
[34:03] take a rapture this is the reason
[34:06] that Pentecost did not take a rapture
[34:08] when they were so close to going into
[34:11] rapture it's because I mean you sitting
[34:16] right here today if you want to define
[34:18] your life it's that God's gonna finish
[34:21] everything through you that's what a
[34:25] Seventh Seal is if they made it
[34:26] everything external they made it this
[34:29] and this happening in this tent in a and
[34:32] this and this and I read you we're gonna
[34:37] read it again if it's not Christ in you
[34:39] the hope of glory there's nothing else
[34:43] left folks
[34:44] there's not another bright list and
[34:46] there's not another message we got to
[34:48] study thank God we don't have to study
[34:49] another 50 years for another man that's
[34:51] coming we don't have to this is it and
[34:58] it's gonna come to me or you or somebody
[35:03] I'm just dumb enough to think he's gonna
[35:06] do it through me and you - you need to
[35:09] say that yourself he breaks the seals
[35:12] reveals gives us his inheritance to his
[35:14] people he gives the inheritance that he
[35:16] inherited now what did he inherit he
[35:18] inherited eternal life in his body
[35:20] that's what the seven seals are for
[35:21] they're not to get you born again
[35:23] they're to take that born again and make
[35:25] it an atom bomb I mean make it an atomic
[35:30] bomb not just a little Martin Luther
[35:35] head of little yeah a little button amen
[35:40] but he didn't have a word like we're
[35:42] talking about now he didn't have a
[35:44] prophet to come in the end time to tie
[35:47] up those loose ends and so that you know
[35:50] what when you tie the loose ends what
[35:52] are you tying up you're tying up a rope
[35:54] tying up loose ends what then it's going
[35:57] to be in continuity so this message it's
[35:59] coming in so so much continuity to where
[36:04] God's gonna have to come on this thing
[36:06] God's gonna have to come and honor what
[36:10] he said he was gonna do cuz we're gettin
[36:13] it we're getting lined up we're getting
[36:16] lined up with hair and dress and don't
[36:18] smoke and don't do this no no ain't get
[36:19] like you
[36:20] need to be passed out Paul says leaving
[36:23] again the principles of doctrine o'clock
[36:24] let's go on to perfection not laying
[36:27] again the foundation why don't we need
[36:29] another foundation brother that was
[36:31] trying to help you get morning in now if
[36:33] you're already boarding in you got the
[36:34] foundation build on it because
[36:41] everything you're gonna get is internal
[36:45] there is no external happening that's
[36:50] gonna get you born again there is no
[36:52] external happening that's going to cause
[36:55] the dad to come out of the ground it's
[36:58] going to be internal it's inside you
[37:01] right now if you're born again but
[37:05] instead of keeping it in himself he
[37:07] gives it back to the people that's his
[37:09] love for us number two breech one of
[37:14] these seals the whole thing together the
[37:15] whole mystery lays right here in these
[37:17] seals every mystery of the Bible lays in
[37:20] these seals in the seals cannot be
[37:22] broken until that time see the seals
[37:24] couldn't be broken under Luther's day
[37:25] couldn't be broken under wesley today
[37:27] couldn't be broken under pentecost today
[37:28] and it wasn't broke only to a prophet
[37:31] back in the sixties I'm just reading you
[37:35] what he said remember he said it's gone
[37:36] from you you're not supposed to get it
[37:37] that's why I said you and I are the only
[37:39] people aren't here to get it the pack
[37:42] stone have passed on it's us
[37:46] it's up to you and I to carry this thing
[37:49] on the whole ministry lays in these
[37:52] seals every mystery of the Bible lays in
[37:54] these seals in the seals cannot be
[37:55] broken until that time all right it's a
[37:59] book of redemption so what we're talking
[38:00] about is the book of redemption now look
[38:02] at number three
[38:03] it is the rising of the Sun this is
[38:05] where we were last Sunday Earth's two
[38:07] Sundays ago he is the one who opened
[38:09] those seals all right brother mom didn't
[38:13] open the seal he was there and God
[38:19] opened the seals through him he had to
[38:21] have a trumpet or a voice but Christ is
[38:24] the only one who can open those seals
[38:25] and then for the whole Word of God is
[38:28] Christ and Christ is the seals that was
[38:31] open not an ant
[38:32] Christ what is the opening of seals then
[38:36] revealing Christ so where we said where
[38:40] is Christ Christ is in you let's look at
[38:46] what that word means that word means
[38:48] anointed was the Messiah the son of God
[38:53] alright keep going to the next one which
[38:56] is Christo's
[38:57] alright the next one is I like that one
[39:00] 1b in doing Christians with the gifts of
[39:04] the Holy Spirit
[39:06] gifts there's nine spiritual gifts but
[39:09] the Keith was talking about it to us the
[39:11] other day well if you're born again
[39:13] you're in line for those spiritual gifts
[39:15] if you're not born again then you need
[39:17] to get born again then you're in line
[39:18] for those nine spiritual gifts for them
[39:20] to work in your life
[39:21] alright and as if the Jesus Christ it
[39:25] consecrating Jesus to the Masonic office
[39:28] then what brother Brown called us little
[39:30] messiahs so we got to see this
[39:32] connection we've disconnected ourselves
[39:36] man has disconnected ourselves with God
[39:39] God's never disconnected himself to us
[39:41] we have disconnected ourselves to God by
[39:44] thinking he's the second person or
[39:47] somebody else not what I'm fixing to
[39:51] read you let's go to the next one
[39:52] Colossians 1:26 we've read this a
[39:53] million times we're gonna read it again
[39:55] even the mystery which has been hit from
[39:57] ages from generation but now it's made
[40:00] manifest
[40:00] to who to help his Saints to whom god
[40:07] would make known what is the riches of
[40:10] the glory of this mystery amongst the
[40:12] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[40:15] of glory whom we preach warning every
[40:20] man and teaching every men and all
[40:22] wisdom that we may present every man
[40:24] perfect in Christ Jesus what without
[40:28] Christ in you you're not but with Christ
[40:29] in you that part of you is perfect can
[40:37] y'all Amen just a little bit louder
[40:40] okay well you can say on me if you want
[40:42] to but you name n if you wish
[40:43] all right let's go to the next to
[40:45] Matthew 24 except those days should be
[40:49] shortened there's been no flesh saved
[40:50] for the elects sake those days shall be
[40:53] shortened how about that that's a
[40:57] promise
[40:58] what because somebody's gonna say lo
[41:01] here is Christ believe it not but there
[41:03] sure arrives false Christ's and false
[41:05] prophets and shall show great signs and
[41:07] wonders and so much that if it were
[41:10] possible they shall deceive the very
[41:11] elect behold I have told you before he's
[41:15] telling you again wherefore if you shall
[41:16] say they now who died say last couple of
[41:19] Sundays who's they
[41:20] they are false people false preachers if
[41:26] they shall say unto you behold he is in
[41:30] filling the blank just fill in the blank
[41:37] go not forth behold his in the secret
[41:41] chambers oh man that sounds good being a
[41:45] secret chamber with God believe it not
[41:48] why because if he's in you you know
[41:49] where Christ is this is so elementary
[41:52] that you think y'all I know what y'all
[41:54] thought you thought well this seventh
[41:56] seal is gonna be some great thing we're
[41:57] just gonna take a rap it's no more than
[41:59] what we've just been talking about how
[42:00] can it be any different than what's in
[42:02] the Bible how can it be any different
[42:03] than your new birth how can be any
[42:05] different than your everyday life how
[42:06] can it be any different what it's just
[42:08] making you realize who you are and what
[42:10] you're doing here they ought to make a
[42:11] quote about that right friend for as the
[42:16] Lightning cometh out of the east and
[42:18] shines even to the west so shall also
[42:20] the coming of the Son of man now where
[42:22] is the coming of the Son of Man where is
[42:23] it at where is the coming of the Son of
[42:26] Man app in his bride nowhere else not in
[42:33] a place not that's what I mean it's not
[42:37] external it and we're looking at all
[42:39] these that well what about California so
[42:41] what so what big deal we know lisam
[42:48] plight brother Ernie Villanueva said
[42:50] we've read we've read tomorrow's news
[42:52] today
[42:53] we know there's gonna be California I'm
[42:56] going to the destruction and all these
[42:58] things but I'm not worried about it
[43:00] every day I mean if some kind of well
[43:04] we're humans after 9/11 church
[43:11] membership grew by a hundred percent why
[43:20] cuz they thought maybe this was the
[43:24] destruction of the beginning of the
[43:26] destruction of the world so we're all
[43:27] gonna start going to church and I'm sure
[43:31] other churches did too but you know what
[43:34] this church didn't you get solid in the
[43:39] word these things don't bother you you
[43:41] get solid in the message these little
[43:43] trivial things do not bother you they do
[43:46] not bother me when they had the
[43:48] earthquake the other day you know when I
[43:50] said brother Boyd I said it's because
[43:52] something's happening right here not
[43:55] something happening in the stars it's
[43:57] happening right here there's something
[43:59] going on in this earth right that's
[44:03] causing that to happen and I was
[44:06] thinking this morning you know this it's
[44:07] really kind of sad because you know
[44:09] thank well we talked about God and we
[44:13] had a prophet come and pronounce
[44:15] judgment and he pronounced judgment we
[44:18] know beyond a shadow of a doubt even if
[44:21] all the bride gets together in one place
[44:23] and prays California's gonna sink
[44:27] because they turned the word down
[44:29] California's going to sink so we can't
[44:31] change God's mind okay we can't if you
[44:38] put a George Washington Abraham Lincoln
[44:39] in every office in the United States
[44:41] ain't gonna change the politics you
[44:45] think what God can do God can only do
[44:47] what His Word says he cannot do any
[44:50] different than what His Word says so
[44:52] that judgment then is already there but
[44:57] it has zero to do with me but I have a
[45:01] lot to do with it because it's going to
[45:04] happen
[45:05] listen the resurrection is not just
[45:06] going to happen
[45:07] because it's gonna happen the
[45:10] resurrection is going to happen when you
[45:12] and I come to a place to where death is
[45:14] destroyed in your body death is
[45:17] destroyed in what you have already
[45:19] inside of you because remember death is
[45:21] destroyed already for a Christian some
[45:30] of you need a resurrection right now
[45:34] Freddy you're doing good though you
[45:38] that's okay that would keep you look if
[45:42] everybody will start Fanning it'll keep
[45:44] you awake if you don't then if you go to
[45:45] sleep then you know free to eat some
[45:50] fruit today with um honey on it and she
[45:55] said she'll be going to sleep bison I
[45:57] lie to keep you awake we sell honey
[46:01] Romans 10 verse 10 6 if listen I bring
[46:06] every one of you a jar if you stay awake
[46:09] I wouldn't care if you I told them I
[46:13] said the best thing to do is bring you a
[46:14] bowling ball with you the church next
[46:15] Sunday lean up hold it like this over
[46:19] your feet I'll guarantee you'll stay
[46:22] awake but if you do go to sleep one time
[46:24] you won't go sleep again we'll be
[46:26] praying for your toes could that be
[46:28] broke
[46:29] alright romans 10 look watch roman
[46:32] tenses but the righteousness which is of
[46:33] faith speaketh in this wise go see we
[46:36] got to put this in the Bible you have to
[46:38] put the Seventh Seal in the Bible
[46:40] brother Branham we're going to talk
[46:41] about in a minute where he talks about
[46:42] the threefold revelation but it's all in
[46:46] the Bible but the righteousness which is
[46:49] of faith speaketh on this wise say not
[46:51] in thine heart who shall ascend into
[46:53] heaven you know the Bible said that
[46:54] twice didn't you that is to bring Christ
[46:56] down from above or shall descend into
[46:59] the deep that is to bring Christ again
[47:01] from the dead you see what we're doing
[47:02] everybody I'm telling you one more time
[47:05] we have as message believers we have
[47:07] looked at external happenings they are
[47:12] signpost but they're not the vehicle
[47:18] you are the vehicle there are signposts
[47:22] that will tell you danger ahead but
[47:24] listen like I said before there's
[47:27] nothing going to change what the Prophet
[47:29] said about the United States of America
[47:31] it's doomed but I don't want to be here
[47:33] during that doom I want to be out of
[47:36] here don't you
[47:38] but what says it the word is nigh thee
[47:41] even in thy mouth and in thy heart so
[47:47] that is the Word of Faith which we
[47:50] preach that if thou shalt confess with
[47:52] our mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt
[47:54] believe in thine heart that God has
[47:56] raised him from the dead thou shalt be
[47:58] saved
[48:00] amen first Corinthians two verse 16 for
[48:03] who hath known the mind of the Lord that
[48:06] he may instruct him Paul said but we
[48:09] have the mind of Christ to know to do
[48:14] what needs to be done when it needs to
[48:18] be done right you know why cuz he will
[48:20] give you what brother Brian told us he
[48:22] said we were supernatural people with
[48:24] supernatural insight prophetic people he
[48:27] gave us all these titles that we are not
[48:30] using he told us what we were going to
[48:32] be now back when he was preaching there
[48:35] was a lot of Pentecostal babies that had
[48:37] not grown up yet but now you and I are
[48:40] grown are growing up because we have the
[48:43] statue of a perfect man we have a good
[48:45] teaching ministry here to pick you up to
[48:48] tell you that there's more sure the Holy
[48:51] Ghost is the greatest thing and the
[48:53] greatest thing ever happened in your
[48:55] life but that's not it please don't take
[48:59] that new baby that you have and put it
[49:01] over in the corner and leave it there it
[49:04] will die feed it but we have the mind of
[49:12] Christ
[49:14] no you're not that you're bought you
[49:16] know I was thinking the other day
[49:17] brother Branham talked about counting
[49:19] down and about pressurization and how
[49:21] that we're pressurized for this do you
[49:23] know it I was thinking this morning when
[49:25] brother Dale was preaching and you take
[49:26] pressurization the pressure that we have
[49:29] on us today
[49:32] because we're facing either death
[49:36] resurrection or we're going through the
[49:40] tribulation we're facing that we're not
[49:42] facing well we're gonna throw it to
[49:45] Martin Luther while we're gonna throw it
[49:46] to John Wesley where we're this is it
[49:49] because I'm gonna read to you when we
[49:51] talk about the Seventh Seal now you're
[49:52] talking about the end of all things the
[49:56] end of everything is coming upon us
[49:58] right here in the front of our face but
[50:01] you and I have so much pressure you say
[50:03] well and we do have we do have a lot of
[50:07] natural pressure that we have from work
[50:09] and blah blah blah and things like that
[50:11] but the spiritual pressure is what's put
[50:14] on us do you realize even when brother
[50:18] Branham was talking about radio waves
[50:20] when he was talking about radio waves
[50:22] going through the building at that time
[50:24] there was only AM radio maybe some ham
[50:31] radio governmental radio you understand
[50:35] what I'm saying TV and that was that
[50:39] there was no cellphone there was no
[50:42] internet Wi-Fi
[50:45] none of that stuff going on in the
[50:47] airwaves you and I today going through
[50:52] this building subconsciously and
[50:55] supernaturally I was thinking about this
[50:57] yesterday subconsciously and
[51:01] supernaturally every day you're fighting
[51:03] demons that you can't even see because
[51:07] you know what coming through this
[51:10] building right now it's everything
[51:12] that's on that internet pornography
[51:15] whatever you want to say filth child all
[51:19] that bad stuff that you think is out
[51:22] there set a computer right here and you
[51:27] can pick it all up well you know what it
[51:28] is it's airwaves
[51:30] it's waves that's going through this
[51:32] building and you know what it's
[51:33] bombarding it's bombarding that's why I
[51:36] read that but we have the mind of Christ
[51:39] only the mind of Christ can deal with it
[51:41] other than that you look at the world
[51:44] and see how crazy they are
[51:45] you know ever cell phone conversation
[51:48] that's going on within about a hundred
[51:49] miles of here's going right through this
[51:50] building all the cursing and the
[51:52] adultery and you understand what I'm
[51:54] saying God has give us a shelter it's
[51:59] called the Holy Ghost it's called the
[52:01] mind of Christ he's given to me in you
[52:04] to what to make sure that that doesn't
[52:07] bother us we've been pressurized for
[52:09] this moment right here Martin Luther I'm
[52:12] sorry Martin Luther would probably go
[52:15] crazy in just a few moments of all the
[52:17] pressures and demons that we have to
[52:19] deal with on a daily basis but if you
[52:23] have the mind of Christ how can Satan
[52:26] get in your mind he can't oh he can try
[52:31] to punch it in a little at a time but
[52:38] folks when you're sitting reading your
[52:40] Bible all that's still going right
[52:41] through the building when you're praying
[52:43] to God you know what all them demons are
[52:45] still floating right through your as as
[52:48] much as we want to put the token over
[52:49] our house and I hope we all have it's
[52:52] not impenetrable to all that because
[52:55] your kids could be in the bedroom doing
[52:57] something that they shouldn't be on the
[52:58] phone why because that stuff's going
[52:59] right through your house in that fourth
[53:02] dimension that's why the Bible says
[53:04] he'll have to enlarge this gates what to
[53:08] pack in all this junk that's going
[53:10] through the through the airwaves that we
[53:11] don't see but you know what there's a
[53:14] God there's a God that will protect you
[53:18] there is a God that has already told you
[53:21] we have the mind of Christ we just got
[53:23] to let it out because even with all this
[53:26] going on we are going to take a body
[53:29] change we are going to not have to walk
[53:33] out into the graveyards and call the
[53:35] dead out of the ground no they're going
[53:38] to walk right among us but it's gonna
[53:42] come from your external nothing I mean
[53:45] from your internal nothing external
[53:47] nothing so don't worry about this and
[53:50] going what's gonna happen in doing this
[53:51] and what natin don't worry listen we're
[53:55] facing a lot of things in our own ranks
[53:57] don't deal
[54:00] don't worry about just make sure it
[54:02] doesn't affect you
[54:04] Amen you can't change the world but you
[54:09] can change you amen you can't change the
[54:12] world but you can change you know you're
[54:14] not that your bodies are the members of
[54:16] Christ shall I then take the members of
[54:19] Christ and make them the members of a
[54:20] harlot god forbid what knowing you not
[54:24] that he which is joined to an harlot is
[54:27] one body in other words spirits demons
[54:29] whatever you want to call us what we're
[54:31] talking about say if he shall be one
[54:33] flesh but he that is joined unto the
[54:35] Lord is one spirit brother Dale is not
[54:39] teaching two or three different kinds of
[54:41] Holy Ghost it's one the spirit by one
[54:44] spirit are you baptized into this body
[54:48] and it doesn't matter I told the Sunday
[54:51] School this morning I delivering mail
[54:53] light beats my fingers that well I got a
[54:55] hangnail and I started to go and I
[54:57] started to quit work I was hurting but
[55:00] you know what yeah and you've got kids
[55:04] double sorry but no but it aggravated me
[55:07] why because it's part of my body and
[55:09] when I hit that thing on a mailbox
[55:12] I heard from my toes to my nose why well
[55:17] that's the same way with the body of
[55:18] Christ if we have a problem in the body
[55:19] you know why it hurts everybody we must
[55:22] all come and be joined unto the Lord is
[55:25] one spirit that's what we're looking at
[55:28] we're looking at that one not that you
[55:32] and I are gonna say the same thing but
[55:38] truly when somebody says something about
[55:40] the Word of God you ought to be able to
[55:42] say it man you ought to be able to
[55:44] respond to it
[55:45] you know Haddie Wright was standing
[55:47] probably washing her dishes this is how
[55:50] holy this whole thing is she was sending
[55:53] out washing her dishes and brother
[55:54] branham was setting it in her kitchen I
[55:56] believe or at a table and brother
[55:59] Branham was telling her an experience
[56:01] that he had had right right he was
[56:05] telling her an experience that he had
[56:07] had and she just looks over now she
[56:10] didn't pray she wasn't shy
[56:13] she wasn't probably even in a mood of
[56:17] worship she was watching dishes have you
[56:20] sisters ever gotten a spirit washing
[56:21] dishes I know it's probably but he
[56:23] wasn't a good one but anyway so she's
[56:26] what I'm telling you is that she's she's
[56:29] in her environment of her home and
[56:32] something is fixing to happen that had
[56:36] never happened before huh
[56:40] we think we gotta have all that she just
[56:43] looked over at brother branham and she
[56:44] said that ain't nothing but the truth
[56:47] and Buddy that opened a portal from God
[56:53] Almighty himself and he spoke to that
[56:56] prophet he said you tell her she has
[56:57] asked whatever she wants that ain't
[57:02] nothing but the truth try that sometime
[57:06] try that when brother Dale was preaching
[57:08] or somebody's preaching he said that
[57:09] ain't nothin but the truth and see what
[57:12] God would do for you he took a poor
[57:15] woman that didn't have enough money
[57:16] brother Branham said she could ask for
[57:18] all kind of money had a sister sitting
[57:20] in the wheelchair but she asked for
[57:22] something eternal
[57:23] she said the salvation of my two sons
[57:26] amen and God honored that right there
[57:30] try it sometime that ain't much truth
[57:36] what know you not that which adjoins a
[57:39] harlot is one body for two saith he
[57:41] shall be one flesh but he that is joined
[57:43] unto the Lord is one spirit all right
[57:45] let's go to Roman's oh the next one but
[57:50] you're not in the flesh but in the
[57:52] spirit if so be that the Spirit of God
[57:53] dwell in you if so be that the Spirit of
[57:56] God dwell in you now if any man have not
[57:59] the Spirit of Christ he is none of his
[58:01] and if Christ being you the body is dead
[58:05] because of sin hmm but the Spirit is
[58:09] life because of righteousness but if the
[58:13] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[58:15] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[58:18] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[58:19] your mortal bodies by his Spirit that
[58:23] dwelleth in you
[58:25] that's pretty powerful but it's all done
[58:29] by class what do brother Brown say the
[58:31] 7c it was or the stills were revealing
[58:33] Christ not revealing whatever whatever
[58:40] you want to in there
[58:40] it's revealing Christ in you the hope of
[58:45] glory all right let's look at the
[58:47] Seventh Seal let's get into this just
[58:49] for a second we must remember that this
[58:53] seventh seal is the end of time of all
[58:55] things that's right the things written
[58:59] in the seventh sealed book sealed up of
[59:01] the plan of redemption from before the
[59:03] foundation of the world it every bit
[59:05] ends it is the end it is the end of the
[59:08] struggling world now remember it's not
[59:11] the end of the world
[59:14] God's not going to destroy this earth
[59:16] right he's just gonna change it it's the
[59:23] end of the struggling world it's the end
[59:25] of struggling nature it's the end of
[59:28] everything and there is the end of the
[59:30] trumpets at the end of the vial to see
[59:32] into the earth it's the end of time time
[59:35] runs out the Bible says so where in we
[59:38] know where it says that in Revelation 10
[59:41] but you wonder I was telling I was
[59:44] telling myself the other day having an
[59:45] intelligent conversation
[59:49] I saw one time I ever do haven't told
[59:51] the conversation what was that it's the
[59:52] end of everything you you're looking at
[59:54] though number seven and I want to
[59:56] explain this to you because I think the
[59:59] Lord kind of just checked me on that you
[1:00:02] say it's the end of it look it's the end
[1:00:04] of the trumpets because remember when we
[1:00:06] the end of the end of time for us is
[1:00:09] when we take a body change but now
[1:00:11] remember that seventh seal goes all the
[1:00:13] way over to Israel I just want to throw
[1:00:16] that in that's it it sure it ends for
[1:00:19] our dispensation but remember when God
[1:00:23] in something that means he begins
[1:00:25] something else all right so what he's
[1:00:28] doing is he's ending the seventh seal is
[1:00:30] the end of all things the end of the
[1:00:32] earth but what it has to carry it to -
[1:00:34] it carries all the way to the future
[1:00:36] home
[1:00:39] he cares all because remember earth
[1:00:41] earth Redemption is still in the seven
[1:00:45] right and even in the millennium it's
[1:00:48] still in the seven the eighth day is the
[1:00:52] future home
[1:00:53] now you and I enter our eighth day here
[1:00:55] if you're born again you've already
[1:00:57] entered that eighth day amen
[1:01:00] so what's gonna happen is is your body's
[1:01:03] got to catch up to that everybody ok
[1:01:06] with that say Amen
[1:01:07] your body's got to catch up to that your
[1:01:10] souls already just it never can be any
[1:01:13] more eternal than it is right now but
[1:01:20] your body is suffering but it will be
[1:01:23] changed look man has tried to change
[1:01:26] your we try to change our body
[1:01:28] externally for years
[1:01:30] hair color facelift I want to be changed
[1:01:38] you know what if I can get changed
[1:01:40] internally I may be I may look as old as
[1:01:44] Freedom Roberts but if listen folks

[1:01:52] she's here I am so glad that she has
[1:01:55] that you know what she made a decision

[1:02:00] that she's here I'm just glad that she's
[1:02:02] back listening and doing the things of
[1:02:05] God she was my first girlfriend if y'all
[1:02:06] didn't know that so yeah well I spent a
[1:02:12] long time but it's the end of everything
[1:02:15] I'm reading the rest of the quote so I'm
[1:02:22] with this family I like for people
[1:02:23] sister barber you okay I've never seen
[1:02:25] her laugh that much well
[1:02:29] Wow you need to take a break

[1:02:42] family comes by your family I'm being
[1:02:45] honest you only all our family and when
[1:02:48] you know when you're not here I miss you
[1:02:51] and same here right you know when
[1:02:54] somebody says glad to have you back that
[1:02:56] means a lot
[1:03:00] we're glad to see you again you know why
[1:03:02] because there's a kindred spirit there
[1:03:04] it's not just it's not just you know you
[1:03:06] can tell a co-worker let's just be
[1:03:07] honest you can tell a co-worker oh it's
[1:03:09] good to have you back that's just you're
[1:03:12] just filling in space I mean really
[1:03:16] some of them employees you are really
[1:03:18] not glad to think anybody to work
[1:03:20] amen amen
[1:03:23] but I'm glad when y'all are going or
[1:03:25] we're gone or something and we come back
[1:03:26] in somebody shakes your hand or hold
[1:03:28] your neck and say glad to have you back
[1:03:30] you know why because it's two-spirit
[1:03:32] it's the same spirit talking to each
[1:03:33] other amen so just real and you know
[1:03:36] what that's the seventh seal the seventh
[1:03:38] seal is the end of all this other junk
[1:03:40] that's going on outside and it's
[1:03:42] bringing us to a place it's the end of
[1:03:45] everything they're not something at the
[1:03:47] end of the trumpets into the bowels see
[1:03:48] because God goes right on over to Israel
[1:03:50] the seventh seal is Christ right so
[1:03:55] Christ is going to go to the two through
[1:03:57] the two witness isn't going to bring out
[1:03:59] 144,000 people and then Christ is going
[1:04:02] to come back with a wife we were talking
[1:04:08] about that this morning
[1:04:09] God's not coming after a bride we've
[1:04:12] been bride down through 7 church ages
[1:04:14] he's coming back to get a wife because
[1:04:18] revelations 19 said his wife has two
[1:04:21] made herself ready he's coming to get
[1:04:23] him a tour by mature wife that was sure
[1:04:26] it's his bride you can say that that's
[1:04:28] okay but you know what I don't introduce
[1:04:30] tune and it's cute to say this is my
[1:04:32] bride no it's best to say this is my
[1:04:35] wife this is my husband this is my wife
[1:04:39] why because we've all matured Jim knows
[1:04:45] how Jim just knows how to handle me
[1:04:48] think y'all should say thank God because
[1:04:50] you know y'all else have to the man
[1:04:52] thank you praise the Lord
[1:04:55] but you know what God's the same way God
[1:04:59] only handles his wife he don't handle
[1:05:01] nobody else and she knows how it's
[1:05:04] supposed to know how to handle him
[1:05:06] you understand in all things because if
[1:05:09] we have the mind of Christ you have the
[1:05:11] mind of the bridegroom inside of you
[1:05:16] that's about that's what we were talking
[1:05:18] about the other day Adam and Eve listen
[1:05:21] before the fall Adam and Eve the Prophet
[1:05:23] weak we forget those quotes where he
[1:05:25] said they were coequal her name was not
[1:05:29] Eve her name was Adam
[1:05:32] she was him literally and that's what's
[1:05:38] changing us back to my atoms are not
[1:05:42] gonna be changed back to Samuel and
[1:05:44] Peggy Dale that's what they are now
[1:05:46] that's my problem now and getting older
[1:05:49] but when they change back to him that's
[1:05:55] when debt see that's one destined to be
[1:05:57] destroyed those people are gonna walk
[1:05:58] right through the wall walk right in
[1:06:00] here and say it's about time amen
[1:06:06] that's what I say brother boy bring it
[1:06:08] on whatever it is bring it on because
[1:06:11] we're coming to the end of something
[1:06:13] we're coming to the end of the
[1:06:15] struggling world we're coming to the end
[1:06:17] of the bowels into the earth the end of
[1:06:19] the plagues everything from the
[1:06:21] foundation of the world it's looking
[1:06:23] right here every prophet that has died
[1:06:26] and went before has looked and saw a
[1:06:29] little piece of the end time what the
[1:06:33] Old Testament prophecies of the old of
[1:06:35] the of the end time they didn't just see
[1:06:38] right up to Christ no they saw all the
[1:06:40] way the end Isaiah saw all the way to
[1:06:43] the future home right but you know what
[1:06:47] you say well that's just words no that's
[1:06:49] you comes without you
[1:06:53] it's not gonna happen that's why you're
[1:06:55] the word made flesh now it's the end of
[1:07:04] the church age it's the end of the seven
[1:07:06] seals it's the end of the trumpets into
[1:07:08] the vials it's the end of its even ends
[1:07:10] the ushering in of the Millennium that's
[1:07:15] on the seventh seal now you see that
[1:07:17] even ends the ushering in of the
[1:07:21] Millennium think about that now watch
[1:07:22] let's go to the next number seven let's
[1:07:24] talk about this
[1:07:25] what brother I'm saw mm-hmm well let's
[1:07:32] read this one first I'm sorry thank you
[1:07:34] I Sabina canyon he said this is the
[1:07:37] third fall I won't ask you a question
[1:07:41] same thing when you say third Pole deep
[1:07:43] what do you think about what do you
[1:07:44] think of hmm thank you better think of
[1:07:49] you you're the recipient of it you are
[1:07:56] the third pole because the third pole
[1:07:59] the prophet of God said is the opening
[1:08:01] of the word not a tent not of this not
[1:08:03] of that not all that issue remember what
[1:08:07] I said it's all gonna happen internally
[1:08:09] it's not gonna happen in anything
[1:08:10] external now there's gonna things happen
[1:08:13] external because of what happens
[1:08:15] internal just like the California and
[1:08:18] all these things I believe as we walk
[1:08:20] closer into the word that we're going to
[1:08:22] come to a place to where rebirth pains
[1:08:26] this place is ready to explode and it
[1:08:32] will not do it until we're ready amen
[1:08:35] there's three great things that go with
[1:08:37] it and one unfolded today or yesterday
[1:08:39] the other one unfolded today nice
[1:08:42] talking about the three fold
[1:08:44] opening of that seal there's one thing
[1:08:46] that I cannot interpret because it's in
[1:08:49] an unknown language and we'll talk about
[1:08:50] that maybe a couple of few Sundays from
[1:08:53] now but I was standing right there and
[1:08:55] look right straight at it and this is
[1:08:57] the third pole coming up now what is the
[1:08:58] third pole it's the opening of the word
[1:09:02] period it's do whatever you want to call
[1:09:04] it it's the opening of the word now
[1:09:06] that's what he said all right but I was
[1:09:11] standing there right it's the third pole
[1:09:12] coming up and the Holy Spirit of God oh
[1:09:14] my that's the reason all heaven was
[1:09:16] silent oh my eye just shows us from God
[1:09:20] for it fits exactly in the promises of
[1:09:22] God from the end of the message
[1:09:24] now notice now notice now for the end of
[1:09:27] time message we'll talk about the end of
[1:09:29] time message this seal after all he's
[1:09:33] revealed all I need to be able to read
[1:09:35] the rest of that he's revealed all the
[1:09:39] six seals now look this is where
[1:09:42] somebody says well the seventh seal is
[1:09:43] not open but it don't say nothing about
[1:09:45] the seventh and the end time seal when
[1:09:49] it starts now remember it's open in a
[1:09:52] three-fold manner he just said three
[1:09:55] things happen one was the day before one
[1:09:59] was that day and one he couldn't read
[1:10:00] right I just read that I'm just telling
[1:10:05] you what he said he's revealed all the
[1:10:07] six seals but it don't say nothing about
[1:10:09] the seventh why there's nothing to write
[1:10:11] on the board there's no in other words
[1:10:13] there's no nothing happening no action
[1:10:17] but there is something going on because
[1:10:22] remember it like I keep reading that
[1:10:23] scripture about Jesus gave up the ghost
[1:10:25] remember Jesus was dead the body was
[1:10:28] dead it's like the world said hey we've
[1:10:30] got him the devil said we got him
[1:10:32] there's nothing going on but look he was
[1:10:35] paying for me and you during that whole
[1:10:38] time he said I've acted like he was
[1:10:40] laying in the tomb cold dead he was down
[1:10:44] in hell he was into paradise took them
[1:10:49] up and redeemed me in you during that
[1:10:53] whole time of silence were they acted
[1:10:55] like there was nothing going on boy did
[1:10:57] he pull something over on Satan's eyes I
[1:10:59] still what he's doing now and the
[1:11:02] endtime seal when it starts will be
[1:11:05] absolutely a total secret according to
[1:11:08] the Bible now that's why he told the
[1:11:09] people on the sixth seal he's has gone
[1:11:11] from you it's not for you you're not
[1:11:14] going to get it but you and I are not
[1:11:17] those people
[1:11:18] we are going to get it we are going to
[1:11:29] get it it's for us it was not for them
[1:11:34] it was for us we are at the end time
[1:11:38] seal when it starts will be absolutely a
[1:11:42] total secret according to the Bible how
[1:11:45] can it be a total secret and be anything
[1:11:49] external anything they didn't move for a
[1:11:57] half an hour in heaven brother brown
[1:12:00] said it would give away the secret they
[1:12:03] didn't move for a half an hour they did
[1:12:06] not move a my soul I'm just reading what
[1:12:11] he said they didn't move why because you
[1:12:15] know what he said he said it may give
[1:12:17] away the secret the secret let's talk
[1:12:26] about that secret here just right now
[1:12:27] that's number six this is the seventh
[1:12:31] seal no angel singing no praises no
[1:12:36] altar service no nothing there was
[1:12:41] silence
[1:12:41] hush deadly silence in heaven for a half
[1:12:46] hour Bella I ask you where's Bella
[1:12:52] remember I asked you to be still for 10
[1:12:55] seconds she couldn't do it couldn't do
[1:12:58] it but they were asked to be silent and
[1:13:02] not moved for half an hour when the
[1:13:06] Seventh Seal mystery in the book of
[1:13:08] redemption was broke open now remember
[1:13:11] it looks like he said a minute ago that
[1:13:13] it wasn't broke but it's broke
[1:13:22] I know somebody had said something the
[1:13:24] other day about me and brother Dale
[1:13:26] didn't believe the Seventh Seal is open
[1:13:27] listen
[1:13:28] the very reason I'm standing here today
[1:13:30] is that the Seventh Seal is open the
[1:13:34] very reason you walked in this door
[1:13:36] today and sat down and listened to
[1:13:38] whoever you going to listen to reveals
[1:13:41] that the seal is open because the
[1:13:44] Seventh Seal is just like the other ones
[1:13:47] it's revealing Christ not a person now
[1:13:51] look to the world he is sealed to the
[1:13:56] world there's no way they can get this
[1:13:58] I'm just telling you what brother I'm
[1:14:00] saying I'll tell you what the Bible says
[1:14:01] it's a secret but now the secret
[1:14:05] remember brother Branham says the
[1:14:08] mystery has now been made history where
[1:14:12] has it been made history at in you
[1:14:16] that's where the mystery has been hid
[1:14:19] from the foundation of the world it's
[1:14:21] been Christ in you the hope of glory you
[1:14:23] say well that's just too simple that's
[1:14:26] why we've missed it for all these years
[1:14:28] it's been so simple we thought we
[1:14:30] thought it was tidal wave remember last
[1:14:41] night those of you that were here there
[1:14:46] was and we were just talking about
[1:14:48] something somebody said well there'll be
[1:14:49] tidal waves all the way to Kentucky he
[1:14:51] never said that he only spoke a tidal
[1:14:55] wave seven times and one of them is to
[1:14:58] Arizona and that's as far as it goes and
[1:15:02] he will say so I thought this title
[1:15:05] would I said I can make a tidal wave in
[1:15:06] my bathtub think about any other way you
[1:15:11] wanted to right so but you know what
[1:15:14] though it's what we're taught you know
[1:15:16] grandma died and walking on the streets
[1:15:18] to go with Jesus no she's not no she's
[1:15:21] not no she's not but we've been told
[1:15:25] that so many times till we just say that
[1:15:29] you go to a funeral home and the first
[1:15:30] thing they say oh mama she's walking on
[1:15:33] the streets to go with you now I mean
[1:15:34] not message believers but don't
[1:15:36] some people she's walking on the streets
[1:15:37] to go with Jesus right now no she's not
[1:15:39] but she's been told that so many times
[1:15:42] now we will be one day but we had a
[1:15:45] prophet come and told us and know
[1:15:47] they're in the sixth dimension under the
[1:15:49] altar can't get to Jesus at this moment
[1:15:52] so we have the truth folks we have the
[1:15:56] truth that's been give to us because
[1:15:58] what the seal has been broke the lamb
[1:16:02] breaks it now where today is the lamb
[1:16:08] inside of you that lamb is your Redeemer
[1:16:15] and he's your redemption so where is
[1:16:18] your redemption that in this not at the
[1:16:20] moment but that's what Christ in you I'm
[1:16:23] telling you Christ in you the hope of
[1:16:24] glory is the whole thing you know what
[1:16:29] they were awed by it I believe they
[1:16:31] didn't know there it was they just
[1:16:34] stopped now who's he don't might stop
[1:16:35] angels now let me ask you a question do
[1:16:41] angels know anything about redemption
[1:16:49] even the greatest angels that God ever
[1:16:53] made Satan himself knows nothing
[1:17:00] remember we sing that song the angels
[1:17:02] all will listen for they cannot join
[1:17:06] that song the John because their silence
[1:17:09] in heaven because redemption doesn't
[1:17:13] happen in heaven
[1:17:14] redemption happens right here so that's
[1:17:18] there for there was silence in heaven
[1:17:20] because they did not understand what was
[1:17:23] going on there's only one man that
[1:17:26] understands what's going on and that's
[1:17:28] the lamb and when he breaks the seal
[1:17:32] what do you do - what'd he do with it I
[1:17:34] just read it he hands it to who you he
[1:17:38] hands it to you redemption is not in
[1:17:43] that wall or in that pew it's sitting on
[1:17:47] that pew
[1:17:48] Redemption doesn't happen to anything
[1:17:51] but humans now all the other you said
[1:17:54] what about the world what about that it
[1:17:56] happens because you come to a place it
[1:17:59] happens because you come to a place all
[1:18:01] nature fell because of you now all
[1:18:04] nature is coming back because of you but
[1:18:05] you got to come to that place first now
[1:18:09] none of us know but I'm going to tell
[1:18:10] you in my my revelation be that's not
[1:18:18] it's not a problem with with us telling
[1:18:22] it in our revelation as long as it
[1:18:25] compares with the revelation of the
[1:18:28] Bible it can be a way Dell quote what's
[1:18:36] wrong with that if it's if it's
[1:18:38] according to the Bible it's according to
[1:18:39] the word I didn't really doesn't bother
[1:18:40] me but he's gonna that's okay for
[1:18:43] brother Brown to tell us of his
[1:18:44] revelation but it's the problem when we
[1:18:46] interject our own self I guess it is but
[1:18:49] now look you said I'm not prone to be a
[1:18:51] fanatic if I am I'm ignorant of it see
[1:18:53] I'm not giving to such now has nobody
[1:18:56] can say Illyria like he can to such
[1:19:01] hilarious look that up in the dictionary
[1:19:04] our carry owns and imaginary things I've
[1:19:07] said some things might be in kind of
[1:19:09] strange to some people but when God
[1:19:11] comes around behind it and vindicates it
[1:19:14] in other words they have to shut up if
[1:19:18] God vindicates it they have to shut up
[1:19:20] and says it's the truth and that's God's
[1:19:23] Word it may seem strange that way and
[1:19:25] now a certain as I'm standing on the
[1:19:27] platform door night I had the revelation
[1:19:29] that revealed this in a three-fold
[1:19:31] manner that's what we're talking about
[1:19:32] and running out of time that I will
[1:19:36] speak of you by God's help of a fold of
[1:19:38] it now and then let's go over there
[1:19:40] first here's a revelation to begin what
[1:19:42] I want to tell you what it is what
[1:19:45] happens is that those seven thunders
[1:19:47] that he heard thunder it was forbidden
[1:19:49] to write that's what the mystery is
[1:19:51] laying behind those seven consecutive
[1:19:53] thunders rolling out so it goes right
[1:19:55] back to the opening or to those Thunder
[1:19:59] sounding now we went through that hole
[1:20:02] part of the Thunder sounding and where
[1:20:04] does it sound brother Brown said the
[1:20:06] seven thunders sound on earth and who's
[1:20:12] here to receive it trees cars thank you
[1:20:19] y'all forgot that I am thing huh yeah so
[1:20:23] where's it going to happen it's gonna
[1:20:25] happen in you the seven thunders is what
[1:20:29] you're gonna hear not seven men listen
[1:20:32] not seven external yeah you're gonna
[1:20:33] have to hear it through your ears but
[1:20:38] you know what God speaks to you you
[1:20:43] don't have to have ears right a deaf
[1:20:48] person can hear from God so you don't
[1:20:52] have to have physical ears God can speak
[1:20:53] right into your mind and that's what
[1:20:56] he's doing now because if you listen to
[1:20:58] what I'm saying to you you might get
[1:21:00] confused if you listen to my physical
[1:21:02] words that I'm saying but if God ever
[1:21:04] speaks to you inside of the inside it's
[1:21:10] never wrong never wrong if something
[1:21:15] ever tells you that you're bad and
[1:21:17] you're awful and you're horrible is
[1:21:19] Satan it's not God now God may give you
[1:21:23] like I said me he may give you a little
[1:21:25] whack every once in a while but he's
[1:21:27] wanting to speak to what if you're his
[1:21:29] child he'll speak to you if you're his
[1:21:31] child he's obligated to speak to you mmm
[1:21:35] so this isn't a three-fold mystery all
[1:21:39] right now look brother Brown told us
[1:21:42] because we can break it down but I don't
[1:21:44] want to do it real quick but I'm gonna
[1:21:46] let brother branham break it down
[1:21:47] because he said if you don't get it in
[1:21:49] the seals go to what message
[1:21:51] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:21:53] come back to this message he said Christ
[1:21:57] is the cross Christ and they all ever
[1:22:04] heard that before
[1:22:06] so let's go to Christ is a mystery God
[1:22:08] reveal let's go to number eight or
[1:22:12] number seven let's read this real quick
[1:22:17] okay he's talking right now what he's
[1:22:20] doing on the seventh seal he's going
[1:22:22] back talking about the sixth seal
[1:22:24] because the whole earth is to be purged
[1:22:26] he so much as it's sealed now do you
[1:22:28] notice on the opening of this seventh
[1:22:30] seal it's also in a three-fold mystery
[1:22:33] this one I have will speak and have
[1:22:36] spoke that it is the mystery of the
[1:22:37] seven thunders the seven thunders in
[1:22:40] heaven will unfold this mystery it'll be
[1:22:42] right at the coming of Christ so I'm
[1:22:46] talking about right now he's talking
[1:22:48] about right now no other time but right
[1:22:51] now because Christ said no one knew when
[1:22:54] he would return everybody okay with that
[1:22:57] so now let's go to number eight brother
[1:23:02] Branham opens up talking about Christ as
[1:23:04] the mystery of God revealed on paragraph
[1:23:06] 140 first thing he starts he goes
[1:23:08] through all the preliminary tells you
[1:23:10] about different things going on this is
[1:23:12] where he begins now notice God's has had
[1:23:14] a three-fold purpose in this great
[1:23:17] mystery secret if I got that same am
[1:23:22] that's what he just said in the seventh
[1:23:24] seal it was opened in the threefold
[1:23:25] matter God in this great mystery secret
[1:23:29] that he had before the world began he's
[1:23:31] got a three-fold purpose in it and now
[1:23:34] what do you want to go upon this morning
[1:23:36] what we want to go upon this morning
[1:23:38] it's what is that three full purpose he
[1:23:41] didn't cover it so much in the seventh
[1:23:43] seal but he's fixing the cover here
[1:23:45] because he said if he didn't get in the
[1:23:46] seals come back to this message right
[1:23:48] here so we're coming back to this
[1:23:50] message right here now the first thing
[1:23:54] was that God wanted to reveal himself to
[1:23:57] the people now listen when you get born
[1:24:00] again
[1:24:02] god it's like brother Dale said brother
[1:24:04] Brown says that you got a little button
[1:24:07] okay you got a little part of God which
[1:24:10] is God doesn't matter if it's a molecule
[1:24:12] of God it's God all right and that makes
[1:24:15] you God hello
[1:24:18] all right but he gives you that the
[1:24:20] first thing was God wanted to reveal
[1:24:22] himself to the people now that's the
[1:24:24] same thing with you and I he wants to
[1:24:26] reveal himself to us not just get us
[1:24:29] born again that's one purpose but he
[1:24:32] wants to make us a living breathing
[1:24:35] instrumentality of God he wants to be
[1:24:38] able to use us in the way that he used
[1:24:42] Adam and Eve before the fall he said
[1:24:47] here this is your earth you take care of
[1:24:49] it the first thing was God one to reveal
[1:24:52] himself to his people he couldn't do it
[1:24:55] as great Jehovah God who covered all
[1:24:57] space time and eternity he could not he
[1:24:59] is too great to ever be revealed to
[1:25:01] people well if you stopped it right
[1:25:05] there then we're done but thank God he
[1:25:10] keeps speaking through the prophet he is
[1:25:13] too great to ever be revealed to people
[1:25:16] because it would be too mysterious how
[1:25:19] could that great beam that never did
[1:25:21] begin that after you went beyond the
[1:25:24] cycle of hundreds of billions and
[1:25:25] trillions and trillions of years of
[1:25:27] light space then out into the infinity
[1:25:29] into the eternity and a great creature
[1:25:32] that was all that and still is now
[1:25:37] remember what is the seven seals
[1:25:39] revealing Christ and where is Christ in
[1:25:44] you but what he wanted to do he loved
[1:25:49] fatherhood for he was a father and the
[1:25:51] only way that he could express it was to
[1:25:53] become the son of man because he had to
[1:25:57] be our brother son of God is not our
[1:25:59] brother son of God is God Creator God
[1:26:02] all right we done been to all this he
[1:26:04] had to become human flesh so that we
[1:26:06] could be heirs and joint heirs with him
[1:26:08] to start the plan of redemption one day
[1:26:14] this will excite you they didn't know
[1:26:18] what he was talking about many of them
[1:26:20] and you and I the same way when we first
[1:26:22] come in the message did you understand
[1:26:24] everything no but now do
[1:26:30] well the astilbe owe you more than you
[1:26:32] mourn you work you're not a baby
[1:26:35] you're not crawling you're walking on
[1:26:37] two feet and the only way that you could
[1:26:39] express it was to become a son of man
[1:26:41] that's the reason Jesus kept saying just
[1:26:43] on a man see they didn't know what he
[1:26:45] was talking about many of them but now
[1:26:47] you get it
[1:26:47] congregation says they men see he wanted
[1:26:50] to express his self the whole part of
[1:26:54] the opening of the seven selves folks is
[1:26:56] for God to express himself in people if
[1:27:00] it's the plan of redemption it's the
[1:27:02] plan of redemption for you and me this
[1:27:09] is so simple this is too simple because
[1:27:15] you're thinking this way up yonder this
[1:27:18] whole people in the message think the
[1:27:19] great Seventh Seal in the seven thunders
[1:27:20] is something way out yonder that I'm
[1:27:23] talking about your simple born-again
[1:27:27] life that is growing in Christ and the
[1:27:34] only way you can do that is come to
[1:27:35] church and you got to listen to God in
[1:27:38] human flesh talk to God in human flesh
[1:27:42] see that don't make didn't see then that
[1:27:44] don't make us no different than y'all
[1:27:46] it's God in human flesh talking to God
[1:27:49] in human flesh how in the world can we
[1:27:52] fail you can't fail when - I'm nepeta
[1:27:57] talk to each other we already been
[1:28:00] through that brother Graham said when to
[1:28:02] omnipotence meet well let's realize it
[1:28:09] and let's grow in it he wanted to
[1:28:11] express itself that was his one of his
[1:28:14] great three-fold purposes was to express
[1:28:17] himself identify himself with human
[1:28:25] beings
[1:28:27] oh what a mystery to reveal his self in
[1:28:33] Christ second to have the preeminence in
[1:28:38] his body of believers that is his bride
[1:28:41] that he might live
[1:28:44] in people first fall was what God wanted
[1:28:51] to reveal itself to his people because
[1:28:54] you can't understand God until he
[1:28:55] reveals himself to you first then you
[1:28:59] get the revelation and he does what he
[1:29:01] comes inside of you that he might live
[1:29:05] not with people live in people everybody
[1:29:09] got that say ma'am let's keep going
[1:29:11] paragraph 146 when I think of it I just
[1:29:14] see denominations pass off the scene and
[1:29:17] everything else just going see when I
[1:29:20] see God's great purpose revealing
[1:29:23] himself and having first to reveal
[1:29:27] himself in Christ the fullness of the
[1:29:30] Godhead bodily
[1:29:31] and then to bring that fullness of
[1:29:35] Godhead bodily into a people if he was
[1:29:44] the fullness of the Godhead boggling he
[1:29:47] has now transferred that into me and you
[1:29:51] I'm just telling you what brother Brahm
[1:29:53] said and then to bring that fullness of
[1:29:57] Godhead bodily into a people that he
[1:30:00] could have the preeminence is the
[1:30:02] oversight the leading they all rights
[1:30:07] amen
[1:30:08] all right now let's read number nine we
[1:30:13] got we got communion today I'm communing
[1:30:16] pretty good right now you communing
[1:30:17] pretty good not now what's the threefold
[1:30:20] matter what's the threefold opening
[1:30:22] first to express himself completely God
[1:30:26] in Christ now what did he tell us on the
[1:30:28] seventh seal it opened in a three-fold
[1:30:29] manner he told us of one fold of it all
[1:30:36] God was reporting to Christ because what
[1:30:38] is the seals revealing Christ but in
[1:30:41] revealing Christ he's got to reveal
[1:30:43] where Christ is and his Christ in you
[1:30:48] the hope of glory second to have the
[1:30:51] preeminence in spy this in his church
[1:30:54] which is his body the bride
[1:30:58] till he could have the premises to
[1:30:59] express himself through them and thirdly
[1:31:05] to restore the kingdom to its Riley
[1:31:07] position that fell by sin by the first
[1:31:12] item back to where he walked in the cool
[1:31:14] of the evening with his people talked
[1:31:17] with them fellowshipped with them amen
[1:31:22] so the end of time seal that's why I
[1:31:24] read that seventh seal he said it
[1:31:26] carries us into the Millennium what is
[1:31:29] the Millennium
[1:31:29] it's the beginning or a starting of Eden
[1:31:34] he's carrying us back to the Garden of
[1:31:37] Eden condition amen
[1:31:39] let me read that to you that okay they
[1:31:41] don't have this quotes but I'm gonna
[1:31:42] read it mm-hmm I pulled it up in back
[1:31:44] there Christ as a mystery God reveal if
[1:31:46] you can get paragraph 580 back there
[1:31:52] guys if you can because brother Ryan
[1:31:54] says see when we see all these great
[1:31:57] threefold revelation God in Christ
[1:32:00] Christ in the church the kingdom coming
[1:32:02] Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden
[1:32:06] of Eden and the representation of Christ
[1:32:08] and his bride and then the kingdom is
[1:32:11] going to be restored according to his
[1:32:14] promise now what's the first kingdom
[1:32:17] he's got to restore the one you living
[1:32:21] in so that tells me there's a body
[1:32:25] change all right then the kingdom is
[1:32:30] going to be restored according to his
[1:32:32] promise praise be to God let's read it
[1:32:36] again when we see all these things great
[1:32:37] three full revelation guarding Christ
[1:32:40] Christ in the church cuz see what
[1:32:43] brother Brian was telling us he said one
[1:32:44] fold open today or yesterday said one
[1:32:48] today and another one in an unknown
[1:32:50] language now watch he preached to us God
[1:32:54] in Christ but now at the seventh seal he
[1:32:56] gets a revelation that Christ the lamb
[1:32:58] and the Holy Ghost is the same person
[1:33:00] and where is that person act he goes to
[1:33:06] Christ the mystery of God and he
[1:33:08] preached Christ in the church
[1:33:10] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:33:13] where in you Christ in the church he was
[1:33:18] waiting on a time he could preach Christ
[1:33:20] as a mystery of God reveal because he
[1:33:23] said now back up he says you're now the
[1:33:25] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:33:27] I don't think he could say that before
[1:33:28] he got a revelation when that seventh
[1:33:30] seal open that you are the fullness of
[1:33:37] the Godhead boggling
[1:33:39] which means not one person but
[1:33:43] collectively we make up the fullness of
[1:33:46] the Godhead bodily now Adam and Eve
[1:33:50] redeemed back to the Garden of Eden in
[1:33:52] the representation of Christ in this
[1:33:55] bride now this is my quote everybody
[1:33:59] look at me I don't have a quote for this
[1:34:01] to bite nothing up this is me okay that
[1:34:04] all right this is me when brother Brown
[1:34:07] saw the third part of that seventh seal
[1:34:09] open it was open in a mystery he said I
[1:34:13] couldn't read it it was in an unknown
[1:34:15] language right this is the way del Club
[1:34:22] it was me and you because he never seen
[1:34:27] any of you he never seen the body change
[1:34:32] come to fruition in a group of people so
[1:34:37] the third part of the seventh seal that
[1:34:40] he couldn't interpret is what he
[1:34:43] couldn't see he couldn't see Freda
[1:34:47] robbers chimdale richard roberts
[1:34:51] lewis you a go today he couldn't see
[1:34:55] that God didn't show him individuals he
[1:34:58] just knew a bride was gonna make it but
[1:35:02] it was in an unknown language because
[1:35:04] listen brother Brown knew a lot but
[1:35:07] there's a lot he didn't know
[1:35:10] remember brother Brown said God doesn't
[1:35:13] tell his prophets everything a man
[1:35:16] showing that when that third when that
[1:35:19] third part of that seventh seal opened
[1:35:20] it was in an unknown language and it
[1:35:22] never spoke of it again but he spoke up
[1:35:24] at all through the whole sermon that it
[1:35:27] was Christ in a group of people that
[1:35:30] he's not gonna know them individually
[1:35:31] because he's going on it's me and you
[1:35:36] because the you and I have got to be a
[1:35:39] part of this and for that third fold for
[1:35:42] the whole seventh seal to open you
[1:35:44] understand what I'm saying
[1:35:45] then if you can't say that then it's not
[1:35:48] open
[1:35:51] if all three folds don't open then the
[1:35:56] seven seals not open so all three has to
[1:36:01] open and he never spoke of he spoke of
[1:36:05] this he told us about Christ in the
[1:36:08] church and the kingdom coming Adam and
[1:36:12] Eve redeemed back to the Garden of Eden
[1:36:14] he didn't see you and I he didn't see
[1:36:18] Lula Church but he knew there was a
[1:36:20] somebody coming he just couldn't read it
[1:36:23] why would God show him that if he didn't
[1:36:26] want him to be a representation of
[1:36:28] something I'm just what I'm telling you
[1:36:29] that's just my viewpoint it may be the
[1:36:31] wrong as rain but let me read this next
[1:36:36] quote in the future home it will be
[1:36:40] paragraph 274 the future home 1964
[1:36:44] brother branham said heavens and earth
[1:36:49] have met God and man is reconciled now
[1:37:00] who is that that's not all mankind
[1:37:03] that's the bride that has come to a
[1:37:06] Redemption of their body heaven and
[1:37:10] earth have met God and man is reconciled
[1:37:13] a restored Eden has begun see all the
[1:37:18] curse is gone
[1:37:20] now listen when you take a body change
[1:37:24] in this dimension in this church age in
[1:37:28] this time period all curses don't in you
[1:37:36] all curse is gone because what is the
[1:37:40] curse listen the curse has been lifted
[1:37:43] on your soul if you're born again the
[1:37:48] curse if you go through all this statue
[1:37:50] of a perfect man and you live close
[1:37:52] enough to God the curse is going away
[1:37:56] from your spirit because when you take a
[1:38:01] body change you got to deny you got to
[1:38:04] deny that you were born a human you were
[1:38:12] born to human but you got to deny
[1:38:15] because if you agree with that you're
[1:38:18] gonna die you've got to disagree with
[1:38:21] that and you know what I can stay here
[1:38:26] today and I can talk to you from now for
[1:38:27] another 15 or 20 minutes on this and
[1:38:29] it'll be in an unknown language if you
[1:38:33] don't get a revelation of your own self
[1:38:35] it will be gibberish it will be that
[1:38:39] third part of the seventh seal in an
[1:38:41] unknown language that nobody even the
[1:38:44] Prophet said he didn't know what it was
[1:38:48] it's a mystery of an individual coming
[1:38:52] to a body change that's just if I see if
[1:38:56] it's any other way I want somebody to
[1:38:58] tell me because let's read this last
[1:39:01] quote now we do have number 10 bring
[1:39:02] number 10 up and we'll be done and we'll
[1:39:04] get ready for communion sorry I've been
[1:39:06] letting this out an hour and 10 minutes
[1:39:07] I'm going hour 20 sorry number 10 listen
[1:39:14] live now watch this is still crossing
[1:39:15] mr. Gardner field this is the nth this
[1:39:17] is right what look Christ in you makes
[1:39:20] him the center of life of the revelation
[1:39:23] see Christ's life in you makes him the
[1:39:28] center of the revelation Christ in the
[1:39:32] Bible makes the Bible the complete
[1:39:35] revelation of Christ
[1:39:38] in you makes you the complete revelation
[1:39:42] of the whole thing see what God is
[1:39:47] trying to do what is the new birth then
[1:39:51] you'd say well brother branham what is
[1:39:53] in your birth it is the revelation of
[1:39:56] Jesus Christ personally to you see not
[1:40:02] you joined the church you shook a hand
[1:40:03] you'd done something different you had a
[1:40:06] Creed you promised to live by code of
[1:40:09] rules how many times have we done that
[1:40:10] when we get in trouble
[1:40:11] hey man we're just human you know you
[1:40:16] sometimes it's not that you're repentant
[1:40:18] it's just you got caught that's why some
[1:40:22] people try to find Jesus in jail Hey
[1:40:24] they just got caught but not you and I
[1:40:29] listen when you and I have the new birth
[1:40:30] it's not getting caught no it's not
[1:40:34] getting caught no godly sorrow leads to
[1:40:39] repentance
[1:40:39] we don't live listen you're not gonna
[1:40:42] live by coda rule we don't we don't live
[1:40:46] by coda roof but Christ the Bible he is
[1:40:52] the word that was revealed to you and no
[1:40:56] matter what anybody says what takes
[1:40:58] place
[1:40:59] it's Christ pastor priest whatever it
[1:41:04] might be
[1:41:04] it's Christ in you that is the
[1:41:06] revelation that the church was built
[1:41:09] upon not a Creed not a building but
[1:41:17] Christ in you so all God was he poured
[1:41:21] into Christ all Christ Porter in the
[1:41:23] church took her back to the Garden of
[1:41:24] Eden there's your three fold mystery of
[1:41:26] that seventh seal it's Christ the whole
[1:41:29] you hear that word Christ all God was
[1:41:32] reported to Christ
[1:41:33] oh Christ was your point in the church
[1:41:35] and you become Christ and takes you back
[1:41:38] to the Garden of Eden those remember
[1:41:41] God's not coming back after you he's
[1:41:44] coming back after himself
[1:41:46] it's okay if he comes back after himself
[1:41:48] and you have what balkanized
[1:41:51] are attached yourself to Christ then
[1:41:54] he's coming to get you - you're going
[1:41:56] with him
[1:41:57] hey ma'am with the three fold mystery
[1:42:00] brother Brown told us of the one he's
[1:42:03] revealing Christ the whole seven seals
[1:42:06] God in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:42:09] himself and then Christ in you the hope
[1:42:13] of glory what he preached in Christ the
[1:42:16] mystery of God revealed and that third
[1:42:18] part which was not revealed to him he
[1:42:21] said it was in a known language and he
[1:42:23] never spoke of it again
[1:42:24] I just believe folks that it's you and I
[1:42:29] we are the recipient of that mystery and
[1:42:34] what she's doing here somebody ought to
[1:42:37] bring that quote up one day really we
[1:42:42] have got to quit thinking that we're a
[1:42:45] separate person from Almighty God
[1:42:49] we gotta quit if we don't then it will
[1:42:52] be I'll be doing your funeral not your I
[1:42:59] know you are you feeling better see
[1:43:01] there told you you set up here where the
[1:43:03] fire falls man you get all that around
[1:43:05] here in that right I always thought you
[1:43:12] know let's stand to our feet
[1:43:14] wait I always thought if if you know if
[1:43:16] you had a church and usually everybody
[1:43:18] piles in the back I thought about having
[1:43:22] a church to where you you could take the
[1:43:25] pulpit and it was on a rail and you
[1:43:27] could stand here and then all of a
[1:43:29] sudden you could take that pulpit and
[1:43:30] run it back there to the back and turn
[1:43:32] them and make the seats turn around so
[1:43:34] that all the people in the back of being
[1:43:35] the front hmm fooling people but I
[1:43:43] believe the threefold mystery ends in
[1:43:45] you and me it doesn't end in brother
[1:43:49] Branham cuz he told us he saw something
[1:43:54] that he couldn't interpret so what
[1:43:59] couldn't he interpret he didn't see me
[1:44:02] in you lord
[1:44:04] I'm telling you I'm gonna make this
[1:44:06] statement and then gonna make it again
[1:44:08] all these people that won't brother
[1:44:11] branham to come back I don't I don't
[1:44:18] want him to come back not like they want
[1:44:20] him to come back he'd be so disappointed
[1:44:24] he would be like Jesus in the temple
[1:44:27] except it would like it a lot longer
[1:44:30] because he'd have to go around this
[1:44:32] country beating the devil out of people
[1:44:35] the way they've turned his message into
[1:44:38] what they've turned it into but thank
[1:44:40] God thank God we have got a revelation
[1:44:43] that is Christ in you not not what's
[1:44:47] going on up there above us that's what's
[1:44:50] going in on that church right over there
[1:44:51] but it's Christ in you what's going on
[1:44:55] in you is what's gonna take you out of
[1:44:56] here hey man what's going on in you and
[1:44:58] I is what's gonna take us out of here
[1:45:00] now we have to warn amen we have to warn
[1:45:02] about things that's going on but I'm
[1:45:04] telling you we will not take a body
[1:45:09] change because of what that church will
[1:45:12] be under did you're gonna take a body
[1:45:14] change by what's going on in your house
[1:45:16] in your life in what you're doing and
[1:45:18] the things that you see in the
[1:45:20] revelation I hope God gives you a
[1:45:22] wonderful revelation I don't I don't
[1:45:24] want to be listen I don't want to have
[1:45:27] that in an unknown language and stay in
[1:45:30] an unknown language I want it to be
[1:45:35] something I want it to be and if it's
[1:45:38] gonna be something that's going to be
[1:45:39] what Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:45:42] it's going to be that third part it's
[1:45:48] gonna take a body change and the dead of
[1:45:51] Christ gonna come out of the ground and
[1:45:53] guess what brother arms coming with them
[1:45:54] we're gonna be around here 30 40 days

[1:45:59] people I don't care if California falls
[1:46:03] off the face of the earth it will not
[1:46:05] harm me and a glorified body nothing
[1:46:08] will harm me so I'm not worried yes get
[1:46:10] body change let's get the resurrection
[1:46:13] let's get the body change and then it
[1:46:16] matter to me we could walk back in here

[1:46:20] have coffee and drink coffee and eat
[1:46:23] cake in the middle of that battle over
[1:46:25] there and it will not harm you that's
[1:46:28] what God's doing for us folks
[1:46:30] that's what God's already done for you
[1:46:32] we just got to realize that it's already
[1:46:35] here it's not a new book it's not a new
[1:46:37] tape it's not a new person it's not a
[1:46:39] new this it's not a new that it's what
[1:46:41] we already have make it make it known
[1:46:46] God making himself known in human flesh

[1:46:59] with something for a long time Lord and
[1:47:00] we we see that Satan he's tried for a
[1:47:04] long time to try to separate us but lord
[1:47:06] I pray that we'd bind together properly
[1:47:08] God told us to bind together whatever we
[1:47:10] do just bind together in one and Lord if
[1:47:15] if it be your will father I pray that
[1:47:19] everybody in this building will when
[1:47:23] they walk out that door they'll have a
[1:47:25] supernatural charge anything going on in
[1:47:29] their life each person is an individual
[1:47:32] and there's individual things right now
[1:47:35] bothering every one of us because we're
[1:47:38] in this age that that's going to happen
[1:47:41] but father you told us to a prophet in
[1:47:44] the message countdown that you have
[1:47:47] pressurized you have saved us for the
[1:47:50] end you have pressurized this astronaut
[1:47:53] to leave this earth amen so I pray Lord

[1:47:58] clear all that junk out of our out of
[1:48:02] our mind and Lord and have our minds set
[1:48:04] on you Father because you sent your
[1:48:08] prophet and now it's left up to the
[1:48:12] people to believe what he's already said
[1:48:15] and make it live because that prophet

[1:48:40] that will take this communion with clear
[1:48:42] minds and clear hearts and that the
[1:48:45] things of the world would just pass away
