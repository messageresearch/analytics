========================================

[Music] [Applause] to magnify his pain and worship christ our lord [Music] amen good morning everyone blessing to be back again i guess all of us all the people are getting younger because all these young ones are getting older but god has just blessed us that we all be together we're going to read this morning from psalm 34. let's pray heavenly father we are grateful and thankful for this opportunity that we're able to come together lord to worship around your whole words father we pray that the words that we read together lord that it draws close unto you father whoever we are

christ blessed name amen psalm 34 our blessed lord at all times his praises shall continually be in my mouth i'll magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together [Music] they looked unto him and were enlightened and their faces were not a shame the angel of the lord encount brown about them that fear him and delivers them that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusts in him oh feel the lord ye his saints for there is no want to them that fear him young [Music] come eat hearken unto me i will teach you the fear of the lord that deserves life keep that tone from evil in that lip from speaking gal the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto their cries the righteous cry and the lord hears and delivereth them out of their troubles many are the affliction of the righteous but the lord delivereth them out of them all evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate the lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be deathless god bless you maybe something um you you can you can pull it up yeah amen you know those are two of my favorite scriptures many are the affliction of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of them all and the reason is is because the angel of the lord and campeth about those who fear him and deliver him always keep that fear in your heart not a fear like you're afraid but that respect that love for god if i could describe it as like standing at the ocean and seeing how great it is on the mountain top it's just you're so in awe of how small you are and how great god is we're not self-sufficient but we're always relying on him amen brother michael would you come this morning and lift up the ties and offerings through them amen amen

brother richard [Applause] [Music] comes i am [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen good to be in the house of the lord let's give god a hand clapping praise good to see all of you here as brother joe said thank you so very much yesterday for all the ladies and the men that that helped put that thing together and all the youth that came and all the ones that are um that are here that are uh sister jordan come to be with us and god bless you being here and uh all the different ones that that were visitors yesterday are not visitors today and just part of us amen so god bless you thank you for coming thank you all for participating and today we're going to hear another great message from brother richard hyatt from russellville kentucky and we've been with him several times there they have a wonderful group and his wife was a little under the weather today so she's streaming in from the house down there and she'll be here this afternoon so just pray for pray for brother richard he's going to pour his heart out today i believe let's sing open the eyes of my heart as our brother comes i want to see [Music] i want to see to see oh you're shining in the light of the glory so pour out your power and love as we sing [Music] [Applause] shining in the light of the glory pour out your power and love as we see [Music] amen amen i want to see him this morning amen amen well it's a pleasure to be with you this morning and we appreciate our brother samuel allowing us to to stand here before you uh we're just family and so i'm just going to relax and i'll just preach to you like you're my family and we'll just enter into worship together and see what god has to say but uh appreciate uh the wade opening up his yard to us we're uh we're uh staying in the camper there and so we're camping roughing it a little bit but we're uh uh we're um appreciate the hospitality and uh i won't take a lot of time because i know i don't have a lot of time and uh so uh we get to know one another between services so uh we'll just jump right into the word so if you would take take your bibles and turn with me to second corinthians chapter four and we're going to read the entire chapter but focusing from about eight on but i want to allow you to get the context of what we're speaking of here and so uh you can go ahead and turn there and we'll take a reading and uh you love the lord this morning amen amen i can feel this presence this morning and and wherever the presence of the lord is there's liberty so therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but having renounced the hidden things of dishonesty one not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscious and conscience and the sight of god but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus's sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god and the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh is that what you'd like to see is for christ to be man manifest in this flesh so then then death worketh in us but life in you we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many red down to the glory of god for which cause we faint not but through our outward though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are not seen but at the things which are not things that are seen but other things are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal let's bow our heads father we just thank you for your word we thank you for uh lord just the the what you've told us just here and simply in scripture this morning lord uh what power what to what promise here and i as we look into it i pray god that you would anoint it to us and as we look into ministry and how it works i pray god that you would open our eyes to it even as we sung that song open our eyes that we might see jesus we want to see you in your word and we want to see you in each other and god we ask you to bless the service now in jesus name amen you can have your seats so this morning i'm going to be speaking on ministry paul spends a lot of time here in second corinthians and chapters three four and five and a little bit into six and and of course he spends a lot of time in timothy and some other epistles he spends time speaking about ministry so it must be an important thing and and i'd like to speak on ministry and unless any of you grab some pitchforks and start throwing it back because you're not ministers know this that every one of you has a ministry so when i'm speaking about ministry and i'm speaking about ministers know this you're all included and so uh when we look at this and second if we back up a chapter uh in second corinthians chapter three verse three it says for as much are you as you are manifestedly or or obviously declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us you are the letter just like paul wrote letters to different churches he wrote epistles to the corinthians he wrote epistles to different ones you are the letter that christ wrote to the world amen you are the letter and so he says you you're declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tablets of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart so god is writing his word on the tables of your heart that you might declare to this world his word that's part of your ministry and the pulpit ministry is is to uh enable the holy spirit to do that that we're part of that process but this this whole thing is a ministry working together to declare to this world the final voice to this final age this is what god is doing and so brother brahman says this in revelation chapter 4 uh 1961 he says now everybody can't be a preacher but you've got a voice and if you can't preach the people a sermon if you're a preacher you're called to a pulpit to preach but if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived it's the voice of god that'll bring reproach to them who reject it see that that voice is echoing out that he that written epistle read of all men it's out to this world and and what they do with it that's between them and god but your job is to minister to the world to shine that light to the world to to give what god has given you to them amen all right and if they reject it that's not your deal they say no one could put a finger on his or her life they're sweet living if there ever was a man of god it's that man or that woman see live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you'll get all mixed up anyhow messed up you'll get people tangled up and you won't know you'll ruin them and yourself too so you you stay in your lane you stay where god has called you just leave your sermon the preacher is called to preach his and to live it too so don't think we're exempt from that if you can't live it then you stop preaching it now now we're always preaching a little higher than where we're living because we've got to grow right amen there's always that room to grow we ain't there yet friends none of us have crossed the line and the good news is we're all going to cross it at the same time the apostle paul is waiting on us amen oh luther is waiting on us william branham is waiting on us we're all going to cross at the same time so you might think you're not as spiritually far as somebody else but know this there's going to be a quick short work and we're all going to cross that line right at the same time so you're you're supposed to live it he says oh how we need it in jeffersonville thousands of lived voices lived voices the thunder of god thundering out and sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lives walking around the earth today without blemish yes sir real christians that's the thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can haul her he don't care how much you can jump how much you can do this or that or shout what that hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything and he's just as sweet as he can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil and so we're talking about ministry we're talking about a life here and and as we look here at the what paul is saying here about ministry uh there's uh he's speaking here and he's talking about uh the fact that ministry is not an easy thing and that's what we're going to be talking about today and and whether it's a pulpit ministry or your individual ministry know this life is not easy all right and if you're called to be a christian if you're called by god it gets just a little harder because now you've got all hell working against you he don't care about what the world's doing he's got them his guns are trained on you and so anybody who who tries to tell you well once you give your life to christ once you surrender to him once you get the holy ghost everything's going to be easy everything's going to be smooth you're not going to have any bumps i'm sorry friends but they're selling you something there you need to you need to this is why jesus says make your decision man don't look back you you look forward you could if you put your hand to the cloud don't look back but understand it's going to be a rough road we're not trying to sell you something here today we're letting you know it's not going to be easy you're either in a trial or you're coming out of a trial or you're about to go into a trial because you aren't taking anything with you out of this life but your character and it is through trials that god molds and shapes those characters james tells us to rejoice when we're in trials now he's not being a masochist he's not he's not into pain and suffering but he's it's a reality of of knowing that god uses those things to shape and to mold us and so he tells us in galatians 6 not to be weary and well-doing because we we can begin in whatever our ministry is whether whether you're a truck driver you've got some type of ministry if you're a housewife you've got some type of ministry if you're standing in a pulpit you've got some type of ministry if you're working the sound board you've got a ministry if you're working the instruments here that is a ministry and you can you can think nobody appreciates it nobody cares nobody sees it but know this god keeps good books god knows he knows the secret things he said don't stand on the corners and and pray out loud and look all somber and all this stuff in front of the crowds he said the ones who do that they have their reward the people are they're there for the attention and they get it and that's all they'll ever get out of it but he says what you do in secret god knows and he will reward you for it so don't get weary in what god's called you to do don't think don't think that god doesn't see it don't think that god isn't working don't think that god isn't moving don't think that god doesn't appreciate you he keeps good books amen yeah and what what would you rather and this is the point of this chapter as we get to the end here and not trying to skip but but when we get to it is we we tend to focus on the temporal we tend to focus on the earthly we tend to focus on the the the moment rather than realizing that we're in this for the long haul there's a much bigger picture to look at and this is why paul could dust himself off after being beaten in the street and left stoned they thought he was dead paul who was in a city and the rumor was out that they the men had forsaken food and promised they would never take another meal until paul was dead that he had to be snuck out of the city at night let down in a basket over the wall paul could could forsake all of the the the trappings of the pharisees and all the the renown and reputation and the fancy meals and the fancy clothes and the the brand new cadillac camel he could he could forsake all of that stuff because he could see the eternal he knew that there was christ waiting at the end of the road and that held him through all of those circumstances and so we see that he tells us not to be weary brother branham echoes this don't be ever be weary in well-doing for you will certainly reap in due season if you faint not always do that which is right doing that which is right always is not the easiest road whatever that god has said in his book you believe that and you can hang your soul on any phase of the word of god it's good to know you have an absolute in a day in an age where people they don't even know which restrooms to use they don't they're so confused we don't even know how they don't know how many genders there are things that were pretty simple man i thought i had down in kindergarten we've got adults trying to scratch in their head trying to figure out but we have an absolute and we know that god's word is eternal and we can hold to it he says you believe that don't you he says whatever he has promised in his word that god will do because he's under god obligation to his word he's not under obligation to your feelings he's not under obligation to your concerns or your worries he's under obligation to his word amen and so well if we go back here to verse 13 it says this chapter 4 verse 13 if you want to throw it up it says we have the same spirit of faith according as is written i believe and therefore have i spoken and we also believe and therefore speak so he says he says this was as it is written so anytime i find in the bible where it says as it was written i like to know where it was written what's he talking about where is he what's he referencing so he's actually quoting psalms 116 verse 10 i believed therefore have i spoken but if you throw up psalm 116 go ahead and throw it up there verse 10 if you got it i'll take another drink while you do that you you love him this morning amen amen so psalm 116 verse 10 it says this i believe therefore have i spoken i was greatly afflicted see when paul quotes this in second corinthians he quotes twice what was written and he quotes the first part there i have spoke i believed therefore i've spoken i believe therefore i speak he's quoting this scripture and he leaves out and in psalm 116 verse 10 there's a colon there and that colon connects the two thoughts remember that from grammar school the colon connects it i believed i spoke i was afflicted and paul leaves this out because he had already said we're troubled on every side not distressed we're perplexed but not in despair we're persecuted but not forsaken were cast down but not destroyed he had already laid out affliction is part of the package and so he's he's laying out the rest of it and these three things are the the spokes of the wheel upon which the gospel rides so i'm just letting you know right now if anybody sold you a deal that hey become a preacher it's an easy life know this this is the ride believing speaking being afflicted amen suffering for the sake of the gospel this is what it rides upon and and so don't think it's an easy road and know this that your ministry no matter how insignificant you think it might be rides on the same wheel god doesn't do anything different for the fellow behind the desk as he does for the ones out there it's the same manner brother branham says that this man the the the holiest of the holy manna it's the same manna it's just set aside with a special anointing but it's the same manner you gotta go sit down the same road friends so we see that faith speaking suffering this is the three spokes of gospel ministry uh the cycle upon which we we move and and you're always in one step of this cycle and sometimes you're all in all three at the same time anyone who stepped in the pulpit knows that sometimes you're suffering while you're speaking and struggling to believe amen yeah we struggle sometimes too friends and so we're on this wheel and he says he says faith moves us to speak which brings problems which drives us deeper in christ that is the purpose of the affliction to look the devil don't like when you talk about god he don't like it when you share the gospel he don't like it when you share your testimony but it's by your testimony and the blood of the lamb that we overcome and so that's all i can do as a minister is all i can do is testify what this word has done for me i have to speak from experience any true ministry is one that speaks from experience and you get experience not by sitting in an easy chair not by coasting but by going through the cycle of believing and speaking and suffering for it the devil don't like it he's going to bring suffering but god takes and my two favorite words in the entire bible are these but god yeah right amen i don't care what your situation is you need to throw what god at the end of it yeah well i i've got some heart trouble and the doctors just don't give me much hope but god who is rich in mercy amen is more than able to take care of the problem but god are the two greatest words in the entire bible and so we see that that god moves in and and he uses this mechanism because when when you begin preaching when you begin sharing your ministry when you begin testifying the devil hears it and i know you all just had a 50th jubilee know this the devil heard it all right buckle your seat belts amen i i'm trying to help you here to let you know whenever you brag on god the devil hears it and he don't like it and know this affliction or suffering will follow he's going to bring it on and so we we see that it but this affliction it drives us to to a place with god this is what it is meant to do it's to drive us deeper in our need for god drive us deeper in our faith right amen we go deeper we reach we the harder the pressure the the bigger the affliction the more we've got to get down on our knees and reach out to an almighty god who can lift us above the circumstances and that is the purpose of the affliction and what comes out of that is a greater faith a greater trust a greater love in god and from that we believe more of his word and and it inspires us to speak more of what god has done and the cycle keeps spinning friends this is how it moves this is how it operates i it's as simple as it is don't miss the mechanism upon which god moves deep faith inspiration revelation enliven us fire us and under the burden of the word to seek the face of god and like moses to bring that glory to the congregation in the hopes that they too will seek a deeper faith and walk with christ it inspires us to speak to cry out the glories of god to encourage others to nurture the weak to correct the way we're to enlighten the uninformed and to become and it becomes a fire inside the minister and so we speak we can't help but speak can't help but minister i'll just say this preachers preach no one no one has been called to push play hey man it's not in my notes but i tell you this and i and i'm saying this as a preacher so i am obviously biased but preachers preach why would paul spend so much time talking about preaching talking about the burden of the word talking about the the requirements talking about all these things we preach you get two preachers alone together and i tell you what they'll be preaching to one another for hours preachers wives i feel so sorry for them they get preached too more than any other group of people upon the face of the earth got to share god you got to tell somebody and so boom there it goes brother branham out there preaching the squirrels i know he did sometimes preachers preach they can't help it and first peter chapter 4 verse 10 is every man hath received the gift every man amen has to receive the gift even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god each of you has a gift of ministry and you're you're to use that ministry one to another and your gift is in my gift and my gift isn't your gift and each gift is unique i'm never gonna be a jewel forney as much as i think he is an awesome preacher he has a unique gift he has a unique talent and i'll never take his place and he can never take my place and i would never even seek to try we have a unique gift don't try to be anyone else be genuine find what god has called you to do amen and it says if any man speak so if we're going to speak let him speak as the oracles of god not as paul said we're not preaching ourselves we're not brother samuel doesn't preach himself none of these ministers preach themselves they're preaching christ to you and so we let them speak as the oracles of god and if any man minister let him do with the ability which god give us that's it i can't be anybody but who i am when the spirit of god moves on me sometimes i cheer up and i bawl like a big baby and i wished it was not so right but that is who i am amen brother wade has a unique gift each one of these ministers have a unique you have a unique gift and you use it how god has given you to use it you'd figure it out i've had people tell me how how how what's your process for coming up with a thought me and brother wade he's got a certain application he's got a certain way he studies and thoughts come to him and he puts it down and he does things and my way is just haphazard he just comes at me just flies at me and other ministers they have a whole different process her brother donny reagan said sometimes he's two three months out on his next sermon i'm usually two three hours out on my next sermon if i had two three months i'd rewrite it 50 million times if i get too much time i i've done thrown the thing away a half dozen times and started over somewhere else each man has a different gift and god is the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom he prays in dominion forever and ever god has that variety for a purpose because my ministry and brother wades and brother samuels and brother bob's and all they each have a different niche in which they operate to the fullest that's why we don't have just one pastor this is why we don't just have one evangelist one teacher and one prophet god uses all those gifts to reach into different niches and different things because your experience and your perspective is different than mine peter and john had totally different perspectives on things peter was cutting ears off and john was talking about love that's why god sent them out together you cut the year off and i'll put it up and bandage it and god bless you we'll pray for you keep you in prayer you're hearing okay thank you very much have a nice day sorry about that two different approaches but the same god working read the books of john they're all about love they're all about this and your brother is very deep very poetic paul peter's just very matter of fact worry about your conversation god destroyed the old world worry about how you conduct yourselves peter had a different outlook than john did but it's the same god brother braham says this so they think today that the reason christianity has become to the people a nut is because we've got a bunch of reproductions and not genuine christians this is why people think we're crazy we're different i tell you anyone who who would give up their sunday to sit in a crowded hot building to listen to some man sputter and stutter and spit at you for a couple hours you're a little crazy a little crazy could be fishing could be golfing could be doing all kinds of things right but i'd rather be a little crazy and gain eternal life then be all got it together like the world does and lose it all amen so the world might think we're nuts but it's the nuts to hold the thing together so a bunch that has to he said uh uh not genuine christians a bunch that has to be babied and sprayed in order to stay in church i can imagine the very first church that they were compared to the reproduction of today that we would be a cheap reproduction of what the first church was oh god help us not to be that that rugged believers in god with the holy ghost you babied not them you didn't have to pat them and tell them you take them in this one and if they got tired of that one they go to another one and you'll make them a deacon if they'll come over here and leave that other one he said that's a hybrid reproduction i was thinking of michelangelo's original painting i believe the last supper when he painted it you realize that the original what it would cost you it would be countless thousands of dollars would would never touch the original because it's beyond price it's so valued so high but you could buy a cheap reproduction of it for about two dollars that's why people today can't understand the ruggedness of real genuine believers they become a nut you know the world gets in such a rut until every once in a while uh that's a little different and he's a nut to that generation i was thinking the other day who who is abel who today is not a nut and this is in 1964 when he preached the oddball he said who today isn't enough who today isn't crazy and if the world was going crazy in 1964. here in 2021 i tell you friends you'd be hard-pressed to find anybody to find this saying that's right amen he preached about the neurosis and the problems of that day oh we're so far beyond that man depression and everything this this last pandemic the number of suicides during that time was what five to ten times what had been the world's losing its mind friends he says you're somebody's nut i believe the world is completely going in and saying you know it's a time that people can't judge between right or wrong and truth and error yeah this is the time we're living in and so satan doesn't like it when we testify he doesn't like it when we share god's word you'd be genuine in the ministry that god's given you satan doesn't and he's not going to like it i'm warning you i'm warning you he's not going to like it when you're doing right people always wonder i've done right i've done this i've done that i've done this why are bad things happening because you've done right that's why bad things happen to good people that's the world we live in amen he doesn't like it when we talk about the lord he's going to bring the heat so speaking it brings suffering or affliction when you talk about what god's done when you testified about god done when when you get up in church how many of you could raise your hand and say well you know i got up and testified in church and what god did or i testified somebody at work i testified this and man the week after that was just it seemed like everything going wrong been there done that got the t-shirt wonder not that's right it's part of the process suffering will either bring you to your knees and desperate hope and a widening faith a deep calling to the deep or it'll crush you it'll make you better or it'll make you bitter so in this time of affliction or suffering this is where we're being trained where we're being molded and why christ speak brother abraham said this he said now moses being called for this purpose but he was a man and god trained him 80 years before he was ever able to use him amen 80 years 40 years in the palace 40 years in the wilderness and god can train a man take him 100 years for 30 minutes of work god knows how to train amen amen all right 100 years of work i did i found it i was looking for the wrong thing but i found it a hundred years of work for 30 minutes of ministry we want to talk about a grinding mechanism amen suffering for 100 years being trained and molded and so that you might speak for 30 minutes he's building your faith so that when you speak it's with demonstration and the power of the holy ghost and not with men's wisdom and so you're gonna suffer paul says this in second timothy or uh yeah second timothy 3 11 it says persecutions afflictions which came into me in antioch and iconium and lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me yea and all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution amen second corinthians 1 verse 8 for we would not brother this is paul in the same book just a few chapters prior here we were in chapter four now we're going back to chapter one verse eight for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired even of life amen paul said i got into such dire straits that i thought this is it this is the end i'm giving up i'm giving in there's what's the point of even living this is paul the man who was caught up to the third heaven this is paul who saw the the light knocked off his high horse he saw all those things and yet he was at a point he was so pressed for the wade his whole pushed so under pressure he despaired even of his life he said but we have the sentence of death in ourselves this is the thing people they take that scripture now first corinthians 10 13 that there's no temptation taking you but which is common to man but god is faithful he will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able people people take that and say god will never put on you more than you can bear i beg to differ god will put on you more than you can bear in yourself paul said in ourselves we were pressed out of measure under the sentence of death that we should not trust in ourselves god pushes you beyond what you're able to bear so you won't trust in yourself here's what he did but in god who raiseth the dead he says i thought it was over i thought it was dead i was at the point of just giving up and and laying down and dying but god who is able to raise the dead came and stepped into the situation amen who delivered us from so great at death and duck deliver us and will deliver paul came out of that experience with a deeper faith that is the purpose of trials to give us a deeper faith to to drive us to our knees to drive us to a place of desperation drive us to a place where we recognize uh and we admit as our brother said we raise our hands and say i surrender all i recognize i cannot do this i need the almighty to step in and to hold my hands up amen and that's why paul could say in philippians 4 13 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me amen so suffering drives you deeper in faith until you buckle under the weight of suffering if you aren't careful because if you do it'll make you a castaway and that breaks the wheel you got to have at least three spokes in a wheel got to have three they've tried to make it with two and they just don't look right it's got to have three you ever seen a stool with two legs it's a little awkward and he's the third leg you gotta have faith yeah amen it's going to drive you to speak right amen and you're going to suffer for it right amen and that is the foundation upon which the gospel stands so first corinthians 9 25 27 says and every man that's striving for the mastery must be temperate mastery is temporary in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we an incorruptable i therefore so run not as uncertainty and so fight not as one that beateth the ear but i keep my body and bring it under subjection lest that any means when i have preached to other i myself might be a castaway paul is saying i gotta i gotta make sure that i don't buckle under affliction i don't fall under suffering i don't fall and or the suffering of good times all right amen come on now yeah israel suffered and buckled under good times yes they did they forgot what god had done for him i tell you sometimes we need pressure yeah amen need pressure to perform things get too easy and we just drift and we'll talk about that maybe this afternoon but but we we need a little pressure to keep us moving and so leaderships and callings bring suffering and you're all called to something and the higher the calling the higher the suffering there's many people who would love to have had the ministry of william brown i remember when i was young and dumb i used to think it would be awesome to have that that discernment that he had but could you imagine walking out and shaking somebody's hand and having them tell you i love you appreciate you do anything for you i can and you didn't have the discernment to know that just five minutes prior they stabbed you in the back run you down didn't feel that way at all about you and he would smile and shake their hand give them a big hug said i love you that's christ i as a mortal man couldn't do that for him amen that's christ on display so we see the suffering the the greater the calling the greater the suffering we can we can look at that and and when i talk about suffering i want you to know this i'm not talking the first church we tend to when we read the bible we tend to think of a suffering for christ and things like that we think about we think about the first church he was fed to lions who was actively beaten and and threatened and did things like that but i tell you the the strain that we're under we're not under an oxage we're under a different age and the strain is right here the greatest battle ever fought is right here this is where the suffering takes place what people said about us what people have done what this and that and all these different situations we got we got uh uh and leadership in the ministry it's it's people constantly uh questioning the leadership moses had to deal with that uh criticizing people being critic critical all the time of every little thing people people leaving the church discord among the body uh marriage has become strained joy is lost in the home and the family and these things and these pressures begin to mount and your failures because we we have failures they accumulate and and when things don't go as expected and people people start looking for someone to blame remember david at ziklag his mighty men of valor the ones who would fight through a line of philistines to get him a drink of water were the same ones at ziklag who picked up stones to stone him but god was shaping that man for a throne right amen ziklag was his final test before he took the sermon amen right there and david had no one to encourage him he had he could have given up he could have walked away but he encouraged himself in the lord amen he fell on his knees and dug a little deeper and his faith rose to the occasion amen and we can see we can see the pressures mount moses in exodus four uh and for the sake of time because i'm running out quick for the sake of time we can see moses the strain on his family life ministry doesn't just it's not just the fellow behind the pulpit preachers kids yeah i heard a few the pressure the spotlight the the the demand upon that has such an effect that's an affliction all these all these pressures and all these things molding and shaping and to do what not to cause us to drift not to cause us to fall not to cause us to give up amen but to drive us to a deeper place with christ but moses himself and in exodus chapter four and beginning verse 18 and for you uh you can read it on your own but god gives goals as a commission you're going to go down load up load up the car put your wife and kids in it and you're going to head down to egypt and you're going to tell pharaoh to let my people go and you're going to deliver them with a mighty hand and he's not going to listen to you and in that same chapter in verse 24 it came to pass by the way in the end that the lord met him and sought to kill him under the pressures of ministry moses forgot about his own family you all weren't ready for this today where are you good see it's not all better roses up here we can't just oh we're here we still got to take care of all this still got to manage all of this and you know his wife gave him what for what am i following you for i'm doing i have to do it all myself so we see the straight it puts strain on marriage preachers wives there's a huge strain there huge strain there people don't understand it i think they ought to be this way and they think they ought to be that way preacher's wife her ministry primary is take care of your husband amen i got a few amens on that one all right amen but we have all these expectations we have all these things and these pressures and all these afflictions that come against us and all these things mount up and and if we don't find that hidden place if we don't get down on our knees if we don't and and i'm not just talking about pulpit ministry you have the same pressures maybe not to the same degree but maybe not in the same avenue but you have the same pressures you men you've got a pressure to lead your home to to be there to provide for them to take care of them to to make sure they have all they have and if you don't you're worse than an infidel and have denied the faith that's a pressure that you you've got to either pick up and and shoulder and carry or you'll buckle under it amen and it's meant meant not for you to collapse but for you to come to the real the whole purpose of the law was to play so much burden upon the people that they realized they could not do it and needed a savior amen we see moses moses we can see that how the pressure at one point god says you know what i've had it with the people i'm just going to wipe them all out start over with you moses you're going to wipe everybody out start over with you moses throws himself on the feet of god and says no don't do it he stands in the gap for the people moses his faith drove him there that 80 years of experience was so that when when he got to that moment of affliction he didn't collapse amen oh he fell to his face he fell on his knees but i tell you he stood taller that day than he ever had before because god wouldn't look when god looked upon that he said that's that's the line running through that's the seed manifesting itself that's christ on display laying his life down for the people but amen also had bad days yes speak to the rock moses oh you bunch of rebels and moses lost his spot in the promised land buckling under the afflictions buckling under the persecution but look the scripture tells us not to look at things that are temporal but to look at things that are eternal amen moses may have lost his spot that day but when jesus stood on mount transfiguration moses was home he may have never stood up in that promised land with this physical body but i tell you he was there on the mountain next to jesus in the promised land friends and there was no devil could take that from him couldn't even find his body god had it reserved for a special day we think of god molding men shaping them for a hundred years for 30 years 30 minutes of ministry and and i think of jonah jonah brother graham says i thought of jonah a man of god a prophet who spoke who was spoke by god and sent down in nineveh with a message to those people and god was so determined and filled him so full of his spirit till he stayed alive three days and nights in the belly of a fish in the bottom of the sea and it came out with such power in his speech until the people listened to him and put sackcloth on their animals on the hills the whole city so ignorant one didn't know some of them didn't know the right hand from the left hand and but repented before god and spared the city and then after that inspiration left jonah he went he wanted to die and sat under the tree and asked god to take his life but god knew brother him there's various different quotes but he said that jonah was not out of the will of god when he wound up in the belly of that whale god knew he was going to have to get jonah to a place of desperation for the task ahead and you read read the book of jonah carefully jonah hated those people he did not want to preach to him he did not want god to spare them but god knew that if he spent three days in the belly of a whale when he come roaring out of that fish he would preach with a fire there ain't a preacher on this earth that's ever heard before he preached so hot they made sure not only they had things taken care of they made sure their animals had things taken care of god knew how to prepare that man for those sermons three three days in the belly of a whale to get him ready to preach to that one crowd amen he was afflicted so that while in the belly of that whale in affliction he turned toward jerusalem and it was only by the inspiration of the holy ghost he knew which direction to turn he might have judged well i know this fish is going to nineveh so it's probably about right there amen but here he is backslidden suffering afflicted in the belly of a whale and his faith reaches out yes amen and he knew that solomon said if they turn their face towards that city god would hear their prayer [Music] amen and his faith rose to a place that when he spoke it was with power and demonstration amen amen scared the life out of them and under the strain if we're not careful minister can begin to buckle and he can say you know what i'm done you can start to say you know the more i try to serve god just seems the worse things get that's natural the the devil's going to come against you amen don't buckle under buckle down dig a little deeper call upon god let his face build inside of you and jeremiah got to such a point with his preaching and the affliction that came from it he said i'm not going to do it i'm not going to do it anymore i said in jeremiah 20 verse 9 he says then i said i will not make mention of him i'm not even going to talk about god anymore i'm going to talk about them anymore nor speak any more of his name but his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and i was weary with forbearing and i could not stay amen preachers preach amen brother man brother branham went through the same same thing how many of you listened to standing in the gap oh yeah amen brother branham went to a time he's he he said you know i'm going to give up on this thing he said uh well he said in chapter 108 he said uh paragraph 1 wait he said so i come down from canada and with fred in them and the other day and in my mind i had it made up if these people don't want to hear my message all right they didn't have to getting an attitude under affliction under suffering began to build a complex and got to a point he says well if they're not going to listen to me then i'm just going to preach to him he did he he talked about it i'm not making this up he says i had preached now for about 35 years in the last 15 to 18 years i've done nothing but just to the lord i've tried to live so close to him not say a word until he told me to first everything and people say now brother brahm tells you he's coming to remember look out for a meeting because he's come in the name of the lord and he won't do nothing to the lord tells that's right i waited till he told me he said i didn't move until he told me and then he he got so for the last few months he didn't tell me nothing about places to go there you go brother branham began to under the affliction and the suffering of a ministry got to a place where he says you know what i'm going to do and for the sake of time i'm just going to tell you the story and you can listen to it it's a good one brother branham said you know what i'm going to do he says i'm going to take my wife and i'm going to take her up on one of these mountains tell her i'm going on a hunting trip it says when i i get a kick out of this i'm going to grow my hair long that's what he said grow my hair long grow beard he's just going to let himself go and when god gives me a message i'll just come storming off the mountain and i'll bring it to the people and i'll head right back on up there that was his plan and him and billy are coming down out of montana and they pull into a diner and they're sitting there and they're they're sitting down at the counter and they're they're uh ordering sandwiches and stuff and and brother brandon had a a vision he had a or a dream i think it was a of a a dump and that him and uh i think it was his brother-in-law boy uh fletcher broy yeah had uh were there in that dump and that fletcher was trying to help him find a place to sleep they were bombs and he had that vision and they're they're there in the diner and uh and and god told him says if you follow through with your plan it's where you're gonna wear it wind up it's gonna happen he's sitting there in the diner he says this fella comes in because brother brown wanted to be a mountain man this fella comes in he's got long hair under his ball cap big old beard and he says some people when they sneeze they lit a little this guy let out an earth-shattering cut too i woke up a few of you waiting for the train to come by and wake up yeah cut you and and and brother branham elbow see we all got our image of what a man ought to be we got a lot of false images i'll save that for another time but he elbows billy that's me that's me that's me i want to be that man and billy looked at him and said dad you're crazy how would you want to be that this is the man that called men sissies for having long hair but that's the image that he wanted to be what got him there pressures suffering the everyday grind right of ministry people questioning him people uh uh uh fussing and fighting and this and that and the other and and meetings being uh him being uh uh scheduled to go places he hadn't even told anybody he was going all kinds of crazy things going on another place he said in his house people coming in and out all the time had to throw somebody out of the basement was just wandering around the pressures got to a place brother branham i just watched that's it that's what i want to do give it all up and just be that and about that time he said he looked in the back and two bums come getting out of the out of a uh one of the booths and we're trying between the two of them to pay for a little cup of coffee and billy looked at him said that looks just like you and fletcher bro and it shook him right it shook him god was giving him a warning that third spoke of faith is wavering because suffering was getting a bit much and he was warning them you gotta find a place of rest you gotta turn to me you gotta let your faith increase brother's going down and you can read the story but brother he shares just a few paragraphs later he shares the the the prophecy that was given to him it says this now here's what it said because thou has chosen the narrow path the harder way thou hast walked in your own choosing now i can see that moses had to make his choice too see thou has picked up the precise and correct way correct decision and it is my way the holy spirit speaking back because of this momentous decision see that when that spoke of faith is under the weight of suffering you are at a moment of decision that's right amen you're going to buckle in or buckle down all right you're going to give in give up or give him praise what are you going to do yeah the choice is yours amen brother branham had a choice and god was showing them if you if you choose your way this is what will happen but because he chose the right way all right amen it says what oh it says because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits you what a glorious decision what a glorious decision now has made this in itself is that which will make and come to pass the tremendous victory in love divine amen because he made the decision in the suffering and chose faith instead of his own past yes amen there was a reward not only for him but for us that's what ministry is for that's what it's all about this is why jesus said in in in mark 10 29 jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is no man that has left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake in the gospel but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal lives oh i and i know it's a dad joke but you know ministry is it's not the greatest employment it's not the greatest job but it has an out of this world retirement plan this is why and we're closing so the musicians get get ready hebrews 11 24 says this by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter but choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season he had a choice you have a choice esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible and that's what paul says we don't look to the scene but we look to the unseen we hold to the unseen we anchor to that to that which is eternal and that's what keeps us going that's what keeps the wheel spinning that's where you reach to when you're under the weight of affliction and through faith he kept the passover because moses made the right decision the children of israel were saved amen you're not in this alone ministry is all about someone else you got to take care of yourself too you can't you know the whole you're an airplane when that when the the pressure is released the mass drop they tell you to cover yourself before you turn to the child or to the elderly and that's what i'm telling you today don't try to save the world until you get to a place of complete and total surrender to god and he gives you the faith and strength because the you can endure on your own amen right but i can do all things through christ who strengthens me amen god bless you we love you musicians come on up [Applause] [Applause] now if you have a need let's reap the benefit of that if you have anything you'd like to be prayed for we will uh we will do that and look forward to coming back at two
