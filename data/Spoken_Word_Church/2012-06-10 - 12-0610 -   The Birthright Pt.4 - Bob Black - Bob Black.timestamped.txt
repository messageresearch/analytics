[0:02] so we've been talking on we've been
[0:05] going down through uh the genealogy of
[0:08] uh of uh Christ and Matthew one and um
[0:14] Luke and talking about the birth right
[0:17] and what that means and why um the uh
[0:21] birth right was given to Joseph and the
[0:24] scepter was given to Judah that's where
[0:26] we're going anyway
[0:28] um and you know I think I think a lot
[0:33] one of my favorite quotes is um this
[0:35] something that uh Einstein said that if
[0:38] you don't really understand it you can't
[0:40] explain it if you if you uh so uh if you
[0:43] could kind of distill down into the the
[0:46] core element the simplest form of what
[0:48] the birthright is it's the promise of
[0:51] many nations that uh out of many nations
[0:55] that we would come and that's really if
[0:57] you know brother Brown said the
[0:58] birthright is the Seal of God the
[1:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost the promise
[1:02] that we would be out of many nations we
[1:04] would be redeemed and
[1:08] uh to what I'm doing is kind of going
[1:12] through the scripture to to kind of
[1:13] prove that um so let me just outline
[1:17] again kind of the where the genealogy
[1:22] goes and this is I I think this is so
[1:26] beautiful
[1:27] how you know we started at Abraham
[1:32] and uh he was promised uh all the
[1:34] different attributes of the the
[1:36] birthright promised many nations is the
[1:38] core and the attributes are that with
[1:40] the Kings and Priests would come out of
[1:42] that and uh the land would be the youd
[1:46] get the promise of the land and um so
[1:50] forth and then Isaac the promis sea and
[1:54] then
[1:58] Jacob and then uh the birth right was
[2:01] given to
[2:03] Joseph and the SE to
[2:07] Judah and uh coming on down this was
[2:11] really manifested
[2:14] when Solomon son riab if you remember
[2:18] Solomon
[2:19] uh he T he T he heavily taxed the
[2:22] Israelites to build a temple and then RI
[2:25] came along after
[2:27] saw his son
[2:30] and said I'm going to continue those
[2:31] taxes but I'm going to tax you even
[2:33] greater so everybody got upset and said
[2:38] uh
[2:41] zob uh the the
[2:44] uh Israel wasit into the tribe of Judah
[2:49] riab riab was came from lineage of
[2:55] Judah and remember back here uh the
[2:57] birth right was given to Joseph and and
[3:00] uh Jacob crossed his hands and blessed
[3:03] Ephraim which was the younger and
[3:05] Ephraim uh guess which tribe J was
[3:12] from
[3:14] sorry
[3:16] not do need a
[3:25] computer so
[3:28] um you got kind of a type of The Many
[3:37] Nations
[3:39] and the Judah is going to bring forth
[3:41] the
[3:44] Messiah the
[3:48] Redeemer and
[3:53] redeemed and
[3:56] um so that's that's kind of what I see
[3:59] and remember uh
[4:02] Ezekiel Ezekiel chapter 37 I don't know
[4:06] if I'm going to have time to get to this
[4:07] the next few weeks but Ezekiel 37 he
[4:10] talked about the um the bones that would
[4:13] uh the cross side of the four stages
[4:15] that the church would go through the b s
[4:17] coming on and the wind and right after
[4:20] that he talks about two sticks the two
[4:22] sticks are Judah and Ephraim Israel in
[4:25] in throughout the Old Testament Ephraim
[4:27] is known called by Israel Joseph from
[4:30] but it's think think of it as the
[4:32] promise of many nations and those two
[4:34] sticks become joined the uh Redeemer and
[4:38] redeem and
[4:40] uh so it's not just a natural that
[4:43] Israel is going to come back they
[4:44] Homeland it's the uh the promise of our
[4:49] Union with
[4:51] Christ
[4:53] so let us um we talked about how the
[4:58] birthright is the Seal of God um the
[5:00] physical blessings the spiritual
[5:01] blessings Blessed Be those who bless you
[5:03] cursed be everyone that curses you um
[5:07] the we went through the pro the promise
[5:09] of many nations Jeremiah 3 see Genesis
[5:14] 175 through6 um where God promises to
[5:18] Abraham to make him the father of many
[5:20] nations and um and
[5:24] Romans Paul said who against hope
[5:26] believed in hope that he might become
[5:28] the father of many nations mhm and he's
[5:30] talking about us
[5:33] um and uh so where I wanted to start
[5:37] today was um God's promise to Sarah cuz
[5:42] he didn't make a different promise to
[5:43] Sarah and a different promise to Abraham
[5:45] Sarah was included in his promise to
[5:47] Abraham just like we are included in the
[5:50] promise that we are included in uh God's
[5:52] promises to to Christ Jesus and that's
[5:55] what uh brother BR said in believing God
[5:58] 1952
[6:01] um against hope believed in hope that he
[6:03] might be the father of many nations
[6:05] according to that which was spoken so so
[6:07] shall thy seed be and being not weak in
[6:10] faith he considered not his own body now
[6:12] dead not circumstances not what somebody
[6:15] else said well if somebody else died
[6:16] when you got the same thing don't
[6:18] consider it see she was included in it
[6:20] God never gives Sarah the promise he
[6:22] give he give Abraham the promise but
[6:25] Sarah was included he made the promise
[6:28] in Christ Jesus and I was included in
[6:30] him you were too see so let's turn to
[6:34] Genesis
[6:39] 14 let me can I interject the point here
[6:42] yeah go
[6:43] ahead remember ephra Dan and Ephraim
[6:47] was kicked
[6:49] out down here but they're going to be
[6:54] redeemed in the Millennium so that's
[6:57] where your redeemed come from that's
[6:59] good that's why I saw that when you put
[7:01] cuz down in Ephraim was kicked out and
[7:03] Joseph and Levi was put in when Joseph
[7:06] and Levi was going to be took back out
[7:08] cu Joseph is Christ Levis are us and d
[7:12] and Ephraim is going to be put back in
[7:13] so they're the redeemed M so there your
[7:16] T right perfect yeah and remember why
[7:20] they were kicked out was because
[7:23] they yep jeroboam set up a an altar in
[7:27] in Dan and in vessel and yep all the
[7:30] uh that uh God remembered that on the
[7:34] 144,000 so uh all the Levites went over
[7:38] Judah ended up being uh Judah tribe of
[7:40] Judah uh little Benjamin and the Levites
[7:43] when they couldn't come back to
[7:44] Jerusalem the worship uh a good portion
[7:47] of it went back to Judah to Worship in
[7:49] Jerusalem so that Judah ended up being
[7:52] Judah benjam and and a good portion of
[7:56] Levis um so to be redeemed you had to
[8:01] have been somewhere fell from it and
[8:04] then come back to
[8:06] right familiar that familiar we were in
[8:11] the plan of
[8:12] God right went after FAL
[8:15] ble God kicked us out down here but then
[8:19] the choice we made puts him back in the
[8:21] choice they make puts him back in that
[8:23] makes them redeemable the other ones
[8:26] weren't redeemable the ones were outside
[8:28] to dve
[8:31] that's yes
[8:34] do means a lot yes it
[8:39] does oh let's see where was I at Genesis
[8:46] 17 14 sorry about
[8:52] that oh sorry Genesis
[8:58] 17:4
[9:15] this is the promise of uh to Abraham as
[9:19] for me behold my Covenant is with thee
[9:21] and thou shalt be a father of many
[9:22] nations neither shall thy name anymore
[9:23] be called Abram but thy name shall be
[9:25] Abraham the father of many nations have
[9:28] I made thee and then uh Genesis 17:16 is
[9:31] where a Sarah is included in that
[9:35] um and I will bless her and give thee a
[9:37] son also of her yeah I will bless her
[9:39] and she shall be a mother of Nations
[9:42] Kings of people she shall be of her so
[9:45] she was included in that amen now um
[9:48] just to see where
[9:50] um The Many Nations come from let's turn
[9:53] over to Acts chapter
[9:55] 2 where are the many nations goes to
[9:59] and
[10:01] uh let's look at verse
[10:07] n acts one chapter 2 act two acts
[10:16] two let's start at verse
[10:24] five so they were the uh baptism of the
[10:28] Holy Ghost came 5 and they were dwelling
[10:30] at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of
[10:32] every nation under heaven now when this
[10:34] was noised to braw the multitude came
[10:35] together and were confounded because
[10:37] that every man heard them speak in his
[10:38] own language and they were all amazed
[10:40] and Marvel saying one to another behold
[10:42] are not all these which speak galileans
[10:45] and how hear we every man in our own
[10:46] tongue wherein we were born arthans and
[10:48] me and Elites and the Dwellers in
[10:50] Mesopotamia and Judea and caposa in
[10:53] pontis and Asia friia and pilia and
[10:56] Egypt and in the parts of Libya about
[10:57] sirene and strangers of Rome Jews and
[11:00] Crites people from all around the world
[11:03] PRS and Arabians we do hear them speak
[11:05] in our tongues the wonderful works of
[11:07] God so this was witnessed by the people
[11:09] of many nations EP that's uh let me just
[11:13] write up
[11:14] here you and me
[11:18] mhm make it
[11:21] personal praise the Lord and they were
[11:24] all amazed and were in doubt saying one
[11:26] to another what mean is this others
[11:28] mocking said these men are full of new
[11:30] wine but Peter standing up with the 11
[11:32] lifted up his voice and said unto them
[11:34] ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at
[11:36] Jerusalem be this known unto you and
[11:37] hearken to my words and uh he he told
[11:41] how to uh gave the keys to enter the
[11:43] kingdom and uh let's get down to uh
[11:48] verse 39 or
[11:52] 38 uh the the keys to enter the kingdom
[11:55] repent be baptized every one of you in
[11:57] the name of Jesus Christ for the mission
[11:59] of sins and he shall receive the gift of
[12:01] the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto
[12:03] you and to your children and to all that
[12:05] are far off even as many as the Lord Our
[12:08] God shall call not just one nation the
[12:10] Israelites but as many as the Lord Our
[12:12] God shall call all the all the nations
[12:14] and I I believe that's the birthright
[12:17] blessing and with many other words did
[12:19] he testify and exhort saying save
[12:21] yourselves from this uncor
[12:22] generation then they that gladly
[12:25] received his word were baptized in the
[12:26] same day they were added unto the about
[12:29] 3,000 Souls from many nations um so
[12:34] let's
[12:38] uh uh let's see I have some things
[12:40] written down in brother R said about
[12:41] many nations in the Investments he said
[12:43] our Father Abraham which is the father
[12:45] of many nations if there happened to be
[12:47] Jewish people sitting here sitting near
[12:49] wonder how the Gentiles was brought
[12:53] in Abraham was the father of many
[12:56] nations and he staggered not at the
[12:58] promise of God through unbelief he held
[13:00] a policy also God had made him a promise
[13:02] to be father of many nations not only
[13:05] the Hebrew Nations but other nations
[13:07] that he would be father
[13:10] of you know I posted I I there's a
[13:14] little message board that I just kind of
[13:15] post things on I I asked the question
[13:17] what is the birth right and U
[13:22] most people today uh don't don't really
[13:26] have I mean where would we be without a
[13:27] prophet to show us these things am the
[13:29] birth right isn't just land and uh
[13:32] double double possession and natural
[13:34] things but it's something more precious
[13:37] than gold I I remember um years ago uh
[13:41] the sister that um influenced my parents
[13:43] to come into the message she was a um
[13:46] message believer that um my mom red with
[13:50] in in college and uh after after they
[13:54] were introduced to the message she said
[13:56] um you know brother Bram didn't really
[13:58] teach us anything that we didn't already
[14:00] know and I that stuck with me that many
[14:03] people think that this is just a
[14:06] uh I I'm just glad God has opened our
[14:09] eyes that's
[14:12] right so uh the the birthright is a
[14:16] blessing of many nations that the people
[14:18] that didn't remember brother told that
[14:20] story about The Mule the firstborn mule
[14:22] I had to be think about that it's you
[14:24] and me that has to be Redeemed by the
[14:26] lamb come going take that didn't deserve
[14:29] anything
[14:31] okay um so now let's
[14:35] uh talking about
[14:38] Sarah and kind of keep in context we
[14:40] we've been talking about that um there's
[14:42] not a natural genealogy there's not a
[14:44] natural there a spiritual and so let's
[14:47] go to Galatians
[14:57] 4:22
[15:14] and Paul here is he's speaking of the
[15:16] Bond woman and the free woman and I
[15:18] believe this is the scripture that
[15:20] brother Brown used and the C's not able
[15:22] to shut um Paul's trying to tell the
[15:26] Jews that to explain to them the the
[15:29] superiority of Christianity or of
[15:31] Judaism that uh in Galatians 4:22 he
[15:35] said tell me ye that desire to be under
[15:37] the law do you not hear the
[15:40] law that the law spoke of something
[15:43] greater that there's a uh uh the
[15:46] circumcision of the flesh spoke of the
[15:48] circumcision of the heart that uh
[15:50] something greater to come for it is
[15:51] written that Abraham two had two sons
[15:54] the one by upon me the other by free
[15:57] woman but he who was of the Bond woman
[16:00] was born after the flesh but he of free
[16:03] woman was by promise which things are an
[16:06] alory for these are the two covenants
[16:08] the one from the Mount Si which
[16:10] gendereth to bondage which is AAR an
[16:12] allegory is uh Paul using these big
[16:15] words uh an allegory is is like a story
[16:19] or just a picture that can be we can
[16:21] that helps you to understand um a hidden
[16:24] meaning so he's telling a story here of
[16:27] s of Sarah and Hagar of the flesh the
[16:31] natural and the spiritual there's two
[16:33] covenants and just reading what uh I I
[16:37] just have to keep pointing out how
[16:39] blessed we are that a prophet came
[16:41] because nobody understands what the two
[16:44] covenants represent if you look at what
[16:46] all the denominational World nobody can
[16:49] explain these two covenants they they
[16:51] talk about uh various things but brother
[16:53] random knel it down in God's chosen
[16:55] place of worship one of them was given
[16:58] to Adam on conditioning if you do this
[17:00] and don't do that but that law was
[17:02] broken Adam Eve broke that and in the
[17:05] Garden of Eden then God made the second
[17:07] Covenant and give that to Abraham and
[17:08] that law was unconditional it isn't what
[17:10] you've done or what you will do he said
[17:12] I have already done it as the Bible said
[17:14] all Israel will be saved but that don't
[17:16] mean Jews as Paul said that Israel which
[17:18] is inward or Israel outward outward as
[17:21] we spoke of the other night it was
[17:22] Isaac's children by sex but the law of
[17:24] God was through Christ which was
[17:26] Abraham's royalty that by grace all
[17:28] Israel is saved that's all that's in
[17:30] Christ is sa all God's second Covenant
[17:33] but all these things foreshadowed Christ
[17:36] and when you read the Bible think about
[17:37] how perfect is even the terminology that
[17:39] would say all Israel because Israel
[17:42] ephra represents you and me doesn't say
[17:45] Jew it says
[17:48] Israel for this uh and let's see God's
[17:53] provided place of
[17:54] worship uh paragraph 29 he had a
[17:57] covenant with Adam the first first man
[17:58] on earth and that Covenant was on
[18:01] conditions if you do so and so I'll do
[18:03] so and so but then he made another
[18:05] Covenant and that was with Abraham this
[18:07] Covenant was not on conditions but was
[18:09] unconditionally and then uh next next
[18:12] verse that we're reading verse 25 uh for
[18:15] this AAR is Mount Si in in Arabia and
[18:18] answer to Jerusalem which now is and is
[18:20] in bondage with her children Mount Si
[18:23] represents the law and the natural the
[18:26] um appointed for the purpose of of
[18:28] keeping Israel separate a separate
[18:30] people and there they chose to uh to
[18:34] that they wanted to do something for
[18:36] salvation we gone through that before in
[18:39] bondage with their children made slaves
[18:41] of all who sought justification and
[18:43] salvation by their own doings by
[18:46] something they did
[18:48] themselves um and uh in in Acts 15:10
[18:52] Paul talked about uh why tempt ye God to
[18:55] put a yoke upon the neck of the
[18:56] disciples which neither Our Father nor
[18:58] we were able to bear that it's it's the
[19:01] law was something that it uh was we
[19:04] couldn't bear it
[19:06] um in verse 26 but Jerusalem which is
[19:10] above is free which is the mother of us
[19:14] all and this is contrasting the natural
[19:16] and the spiritual that we're above we're
[19:18] Heavenly it's a spiritual not a natural
[19:21] genealogy we're from above has
[19:23] contrasted to the Earthly we're free has
[19:26] contrasted to Hagar the Bond woman
[19:29] and Jerusalem is the mother of us all
[19:32] Jerusalem comes from the word like it
[19:34] was originally called Salem peace
[19:36] because remember the story of melkisedek
[19:39] was the prince of Salem he was Prince of
[19:41] Jerusalem uh Jerusalem uh is kind of a
[19:44] contraction of
[19:45] Jerusalem the the city of peace and uh
[19:49] it's the mother of us all because it's
[19:51] an eternal City and we become uh by
[19:55] being part of Christ we're Eternal so
[19:59] and in the communion 1957 he he said he
[20:01] was called the king of Salem which any
[20:03] scholar knows that Salem was Jerusalem
[20:05] it was called Salem before it was called
[20:06] Jerusalem who was this man that met him
[20:08] that thought that thought he'd taken the
[20:10] right step who was this person that
[20:11] stood by him watch who he is he's the
[20:13] king of Jerusalem and he's also the king
[20:16] of peace and th brother around said
[20:18] notice Jerusalem the word Jerusalem is
[20:20] from above the Bible says it's word is
[20:22] the mother of us all and Christ is our
[20:24] mother we realize that God is our mother
[20:27] for we are born of him the word simply
[20:28] means peace Jerusalem Shalom or Shalom
[20:31] which means peace jerus Shalom see means
[20:36] peace and a Hagar represents um Earthly
[20:41] carnal temporary sah Heavenly spiritual
[20:45] free
[20:46] Eternal in verse 27 for it is written
[20:49] Rejoice thou baren that bearest not
[20:51] break forth and cry thou that travail us
[20:54] not for the desolate hath many more
[20:56] children that she with which had and
[20:59] husband this is another verse that uh if
[21:02] God hadn't sent a prophet it it looks
[21:04] like he's saying that Sarah was baring
[21:08] until
[21:11] uh all of a sudden the promise of of
[21:14] many nations is coming to pass but here
[21:16] listen to what really is happening he's
[21:18] quoting Isaiah 54 Where Isaiah said sing
[21:20] Oh Baron thou that do not bear Break
[21:23] Forth into sin and cry aloud thou that
[21:24] do not trevail a child for more are the
[21:26] children of the desolate than the
[21:27] children of the married wife said the
[21:29] Lord Brother R said in the spoken word
[21:31] is the Original
[21:33] Seed do you want me you want me to read
[21:36] it all right uh sorry let me step
[21:40] back start at the top Paul was afraid
[21:43] that the people would catch would watch
[21:44] some kind of a big words that he could
[21:46] say some of his education 1 Corinthians
[21:49] 21-8 you want to put it down 1
[21:51] Corinthians 21 to8 Paul said I never
[21:53] come to you speaking words intellectual
[21:55] you know that your faith might be in
[21:56] some Seminary thing but I come come to
[21:58] you with the Simplicity and the power
[22:00] and demonstration of the Holy Ghost that
[22:02] your faith would rest in the word of God
[22:04] although the denominational churches
[22:06] were outnumber the bride a thousand to
[22:08] one do you believe that you believe the
[22:10] Bible teaches it Isaiah 54:1 he promised
[22:13] it for the do you want me you want me to
[22:15] read it all right let's get it you want
[22:16] to see where it's at we promis that they
[22:18] would outnumber sing O bear and thou
[22:21] that this not bear Break Forth into
[22:22] singing and cry aloud thou that do not
[22:24] travail with child for more of the
[22:27] children of the desolate the children of
[22:28] the married wife sayith the
[22:30] Lord more of the children of the
[22:33] than the married wife sure outn us many
[22:36] times though they more in numbers they
[22:39] have no true father now the
[22:41] denominational kinds is interpret is
[22:43] represented in Jude 8813 that's the
[22:45] secular Church clouds Without Rain
[22:47] foaming out their own shame the
[22:49] Pentecostal church is represented of
[22:51] that denominational group in 2 Timothy
[22:54] 3:1 to8 having a form of godliness their
[22:56] seed produced their kind no the unit now
[22:59] we Brethren Let's uh I'm go on verse 28
[23:02] now we Brethren as Isaac was are the
[23:04] children of
[23:05] Promise
[23:09] so a je might read that and say uh or or
[23:13] or we might read that and say how can we
[23:15] be the children of promise that was
[23:17] promised to Abraham Isaac and Jacob if
[23:20] the Jews would seems like they would be
[23:23] the promise the natural seed if they
[23:25] despise us and that next verse Paul
[23:29] answers that but as then he that was
[23:31] born after the flesh persecuted him that
[23:33] was born after the spirit even so it is
[23:38] now y because we are and this
[23:43] uh you know Isaac's birth I just have a
[23:46] note Isaac's birth revealed the true
[23:48] character of ishel when you get the
[23:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost when you see
[23:52] God and and when you get a revelation uh
[23:56] then it reveals
[23:59] who who you were where you came from and
[24:01] it also reveals the carnal part of you
[24:05] that's still present it makes it known
[24:08] and
[24:09] uh you know that uh that revelation of
[24:13] the depravity of the flesh can be uh can
[24:15] kind of shock new Believers into
[24:17] thinking that you're you have
[24:21] some uh that you have more troubles than
[24:23] you really it's a good thing to get a
[24:25] revelation of the gravity of the flesh
[24:28] that uh so this
[24:30] is Isaac's when Isaac was born you don't
[24:34] really hear anything about ishma until
[24:37] Isaac was born and then his true
[24:39] character was
[24:43] revealed in verse 30 nevertheless what
[24:46] sayith the scripture cast out the Bond
[24:48] woman and her son for the son of the
[24:49] Bond woman shall not be air with the son
[24:52] of the free woman so them brethren we
[24:53] are not children of the Bond woman but
[24:56] of the three
[24:58] so let's take uh in the last few
[25:02] minutes a closer look at Isaac and where
[25:05] we're going with this Birthright promise
[25:07] so God promised that many nations the
[25:09] promise would come through Isaac but
[25:11] then call on I'm I'm not going to go
[25:13] into details of the sacrifice then he
[25:14] called on Abraham to sacrifice his son
[25:17] the only one that through who the
[25:19] promise that of could be fulfilled and
[25:25] uh you know Isaac just like Jacob when
[25:29] we get to Jacob
[25:31] um you know Jacob had the birth right
[25:33] before he was even born because or he
[25:36] was he was going to get it because God
[25:38] said uh Jacob have I love Esau have I
[25:41] hated if he I believe if he had just
[25:43] waited on it then uh he would
[25:46] have it would have come to him because
[25:48] if you look through the
[25:50] genealogy all of the people through from
[25:52] Isaac down to Manasseh that they were
[25:55] not the first born God gives it to those
[25:57] that desire um and uh the
[26:02] reason Isaac typifies the uh the new
[26:06] birth and the Christ the promised seed
[26:08] is because he was a part of a creative
[26:10] act in Romans 4:19 Paul says that
[26:12] Sarah's womb was dead uh the son of
[26:16] Promise uh he uh just like Christ was
[26:19] raised from the dead and
[26:26] um let
[26:30] see so Abraham the whole walk of uh
[26:34] these three Patriarchs typifies election
[26:37] justification Perfection uh Joseph was
[26:40] Perfection Jacob was Grace
[26:43] um and Abraham uh I just have a note
[26:47] that that they each were represented by
[26:50] kind of something uh that typified their
[26:53] life Abraham what typified his was the
[26:55] Altar and Isaac was the wh and Jacob was
[26:58] tense traveling and ASA Isaac he was
[27:01] always associated with a whale um in in
[27:03] Genesis 2462 the first thing that uh
[27:07] I'll just read it the first thing that
[27:09] said of Isaac after he was bound to The
[27:11] Altar and delivered from uh came came
[27:14] forth
[27:15] um that a lamb was found as a as a
[27:19] sacrifice to offer instead of Isaac the
[27:22] first thing that was said of Isaac after
[27:23] that event was that um in uh Genesis 462
[27:28] and Isaac came from the well
[27:30] L The Well of him that liveth and seeth
[27:33] me for he dwelt in the South Country
[27:37] that's when he was coming from uh to
[27:39] meet
[27:40] Rebecca and it came to pass after the
[27:43] death of Abraham that God blessed his
[27:44] son this is verse 11 the next time was
[27:48] um and it came to pass after the death
[27:51] of Abraham that God blessed his son
[27:52] Isaac and Isaac dwelt by the well
[27:55] L The Well of him that liveth and seeth
[27:58] me and Isaac is associated with a well
[28:01] seven
[28:03] times a well of uh a Well Spring of
[28:06] everlasting life The Well of him that
[28:08] live conceive me and
[28:15] uh let's see I have some notes on
[28:18] Abraham Isaac
[28:26] sacrifice so now let's go over to
[28:28] Genesis chapter
[28:50] 22 this is just going over again Isaac
[28:53] Abraham's promise to Isaac after Isaac
[28:56] sacrifice
[28:58] and the angel of the Lord verse 15
[29:00] Genesis 22:15 the angel of the Lord
[29:03] called into Abraham Out of Heaven the
[29:04] second time and said by myself have I
[29:06] sworn sayith the Lord for because thou
[29:08] has done this thing and Hast not
[29:09] withheld thy son thy only son that in
[29:12] blessing I Will Bless thee and in
[29:13] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[29:15] the stars of heaven and as the sand
[29:17] which is upon the seashore and thy seed
[29:19] shall possess the Gate of his enemies
[29:21] and in thy seed shall all the nations of
[29:23] the earth be blessed because th thou
[29:25] Hast obeyed my voice
[29:28] now let's go over to Genesis so so he's
[29:30] establishing that that he's going to
[29:33] establish him as a uh he's going to give
[29:37] his
[29:38] seed as all the in all the nations of
[29:40] the
[29:41] earth let's go to Genesis
[29:48] 24 verse
[29:54] 60 and this promises established again
[29:59] and they blessed Rebecca and said unto
[30:01] her Thou Art our sister be thou the
[30:02] mother of thousands of millions and let
[30:04] thy SE possess the Gate of those which
[30:06] keep them and this is uh possessing the
[30:10] gates go around preach the sermon
[30:12] possessing the gates for enemies this is
[30:13] kind of the the uh National
[30:15] characteristic of the birthright people
[30:18] that they would uh let's see what
[30:19] brother said about thy seed shall
[30:21] possess the Gate of his enemy what are
[30:23] we afraid about possess the gates we
[30:25] have God's promise we have his word we
[30:26] have his Holy Spirit the angels are
[30:28] encamped about everything's in order
[30:31] every wall can be took down it's already
[30:33] took down the Son of God goes before us
[30:35] his Banners are waving and there's
[30:36] nothing can stand in the way of a saint
[30:38] going to be the promise of God death
[30:40] can't stop it the Grave can't stop it
[30:42] the devil can't stop it we are more than
[30:44] conquerors sickness is conquered for you
[30:47] friends death is conquered for you
[30:49] unbeliever wants you receive it and then
[30:52] uh further down PR paragraph 59 be
[30:55] thanks to God who gives us the victory
[30:57] through our Lord Jesus Christ and his
[30:58] seed shall possess the gates of his
[31:00] enemies possess the Gate of all of his
[31:02] enemies and when he come he possessed
[31:04] every gate the Gate of sickness the Gate
[31:06] of death the Gate of Hell the Gate of
[31:08] Temptation the Gate of the Grave he
[31:10] possessed every gra every gate and
[31:12] freely gives it to us and makes us more
[31:13] than conquerors through him that loved
[31:15] us and gave himself for us and then in
[31:18] Genesis 26 I'll stop on this the promise
[31:24] confirmed again to
[31:26] Isaac
[31:29] 261 and there was a fam famine in the
[31:32] land
[31:33] besides beside the first famine that was
[31:35] in the days of Abraham and Isaac went
[31:37] unto ailec King of the Philistines unto
[31:40] guar and guar is the city right on the
[31:42] border line and the Lord appeared unto
[31:45] him and said go now go not down into
[31:47] Egypt dwell in the land which I shall
[31:49] tell thee of ser Ser journ in this land
[31:53] and I will be with
[31:54] thee because Israel is never blessed
[31:57] that they're out of their place and Will
[31:59] Bless thee For unto thee and unto thy
[32:00] seed I will give all these countries and
[32:02] I will perform the oath which I swear
[32:03] unto Abram thy father and I will make
[32:05] thy seed to multiply as the stars of
[32:07] Heaven as that's us the spiritual and
[32:10] will give unto thy seed all these
[32:12] countries and thy seed shall all the
[32:13] nations of the earth be blessed because
[32:15] that Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my
[32:18] charge my Commandments my statutes and
[32:20] my laws so um that's just a summary of
[32:23] of the birth right when you think of the
[32:25] birth right you just want to summon up
[32:27] it's you and me
[32:30] am all right God bless y'all good
[32:42] job
