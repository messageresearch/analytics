[0:07] testing power we're live so this is the
[0:12] scripture woman are looking at again but
[0:14] before we before we get it started let's
[0:16] just go and pray Lord Jesus we just
[0:18] think you've gone for another day to
[0:20] gather around your word and the human
[0:21] what about you which is you're all
[0:23] closer to you or
[0:25] were pretty honor to lead with the
[0:26] services that they are great an upgrade
[0:28] or two people it away to studies more
[0:30] and open the eyes about Hartley asked
[0:34] anybody just Christ
[0:37] now so so let me bring it back up in the
[0:42] scripture us it's kind of look at it
[0:43] because they're asking this is this is
[0:46] kind of steers and uses these two
[0:47] examples Noah and lot it's going to be
[0:50] like that when when when they come into
[0:52] the son of man appears and the process
[0:56] and so forth and they're asking and then
[0:58] cuz it's a little parable there's going
[1:00] to be two in the bed to the field and
[1:02] whatnot and and one will be taken and
[1:05] the other left and to me I think this is
[1:09] this is really kind of striking because
[1:12] you know you you go to church with
[1:14] everybody you fellowship with one
[1:16] another and to think that so will be
[1:19] left and others will be taken you have
[1:22] you know to me when we get over there I
[1:25] think it's just going to be so wonderful
[1:26] to make me look across the street of
[1:28] that New Jerusalem and see see brother
[1:30] Joe and all of you here and be able to
[1:35] fellow sit up and sit down by the river
[1:37] life and talk it over talk about all
[1:40] thanks middle brother rhoram was
[1:43] pitching on this and it just begin to
[1:44] open up and things but it's really sad
[1:47] there's this little story the thing
[1:50] there'll be one taken and one left right
[1:53] that's not you know that I believe
[1:55] that's where Jesus comes on saying wipes
[1:57] the tears away from our articles that's
[1:59] that's a sad thing to think about the
[2:01] people that were were lovely to us that
[2:04] we're something real dear to us but yet
[2:07] they cannot see the essence of the
[2:09] message which by the way we're speaking
[2:11] on and really kind of struck me to the
[2:13] kind of kind of give me a little push
[2:16] with this little lesson that little
[2:18] thought on that so
[2:19] with the message is funny but I believe
[2:21] what this is what the soc is where the
[2:23] new trucks where the carcass is the
[2:25] Eagles will be getting together and that
[2:27] question that the Wayne Jesus responded
[2:30] to that question shows us how to be born
[2:32] again how to grow a stache your perfect
[2:35] man where we're going to be where we're
[2:37] going to be taken and you know he said
[2:39] that the kingdom of heaven doesn't come
[2:41] with a observation so when you think
[2:42] about where will the eagle's be gathered
[2:46] together it's not necessarily a place of
[2:49] observation but it's a he's telling a
[2:53] story trying to get it across to us
[2:55] something now I put together some little
[3:00] two little slides they're just going to
[3:02] illustrate my point and and and this is
[3:05] gruesome I know but your age because I
[3:07] have I even wore Bruce and slide ahead
[3:10] cuz we're talking about the carcass that
[3:13] this is a bloody gah spectra and we
[3:15] would never be able to go where the
[3:17] carcass is that Jesus had to come and
[3:20] died and his life for us to be like
[3:22] brother Brennan said ground up his
[3:24] facially buy hamburger meat now that's
[3:26] that's the first that that seed had to
[3:30] go in the ground so that so that he
[3:32] could have fellowship left so there's
[3:34] the question and the answer is seven
[3:36] a.m. where Lord where where are these
[3:40] people going that are are disappearing
[3:43] or changed where are they going is a
[3:47] place is it what is it wheresoever the
[3:52] body is still there when the Eagles
[3:57] now what about that black be you
[3:59] remember last last Sunday I was talking
[4:01] about how the believers Christians whole
[4:05] focus is to see that move that sermon
[4:08] but what does the tracks on the Mount
[4:09] we're attracted by God fulfilling his
[4:12] word when we see God's work begin to be
[4:15] fulfill that attracts us in it it calls
[4:17] us to focus in that's that's our whole
[4:19] our whole desire that's what Jesus
[4:22] desire he's not not my will but thine be
[4:24] doing you want to see God's Word be
[4:26] fulfilled and and let's look a paragraph
[4:31] 95 this message look and his faith can
[4:34] only be based upon one thing and that's
[4:36] the word I mean I feel like a shouting
[4:38] Baptist yes sir see when you get to that
[4:40] word that's the living thing that's the
[4:43] word we are mind and eyes can be single
[4:45] to that word and to focus that into you
[4:48] see exactly what God is doing what a
[4:50] wonderful thing that's what the Old
[4:54] Testament says let that I be single and
[4:56] let that you're the ideal heart is
[4:58] really you you can look over here look
[5:00] over there but focusing and let it be
[5:02] single but to God word right and and not
[5:06] be distracted because that is what's
[5:09] going to take us out of here and you
[5:11] think about is a word um I'm kind of
[5:15] getting over the wake talk a little bit
[5:17] here but is the word of like just
[5:19] intellectual understanding is it just a
[5:21] scriptural page and the more we know
[5:25] about is that learning the word but the
[5:27] water it is a person in it the word of
[5:29] somebody and that's what that's really
[5:32] the whole point of this little Sunday
[5:33] School lessons we're being weird that's
[5:36] where the eagles are gathered together
[5:37] to him we've become the word and we're
[5:40] drawn to the word
[5:42] and that's what we're going to now now
[5:44] in the beginning God had it in him these
[5:47] attributes not this is mega dope or
[5:50] illustration of attributes but
[5:53] attributes are like genius right there
[5:54] there are maybe look at these they have
[5:57] like a little own if you look at least
[6:00] one of these little things as an ant
[6:01] remain each one might describe something
[6:03] about whatever it is an attribute of and
[6:06] attributes are attributes are written
[6:10] that the genes and you are like it's
[6:12] almost like written and can give you
[6:14] updated overridden using for letters
[6:16] right I think is a cgt that science is
[6:20] used to transcribe the genes in your
[6:21] body for and that's up before the number
[6:24] of earthly glimmers for imagine or Luke
[6:27] and John for is a number that your
[6:29] attributes are inscribed in your DNA in
[6:31] it well God's attributes are actually
[6:34] written in him they were written full
[6:36] written in but they got to be expressed
[6:38] they got to be manifested in it so you
[6:40] can almost look techniques these
[6:41] attributes and think of them as as as as
[6:44] word that's writing but it's got to come
[6:47] in being and now this is this is maybe
[6:52] also a poor illustration but they would
[6:54] think of God in the beginning at all
[6:55] these things written down what kind of
[6:57] God he was what kind of person love and
[7:00] Redeemer and a savior and enjoy and all
[7:04] these different things but it's got to
[7:05] be expressed and what he's doing is is
[7:07] by his word he's bringing it on down to
[7:10] express it a first he groped and he
[7:12] wrote his attributes in the stars and
[7:14] program talks about how he put his
[7:16] attributes and he wrote him down in
[7:18] three different bottles he go to look
[7:20] you know that from the stars tell the
[7:23] whole story of o how God was go down and
[7:26] save us like like a Aquarius the Water
[7:30] Bearer with his paws I pour out my
[7:32] spirit conflation all the stars tell
[7:36] berger together it was written in the
[7:39] pyramid and maybe a little bit hard for
[7:41] us to understand but that whole story of
[7:43] going up a few it is written in that
[7:45] pyramid that enoch built and then it was
[7:49] written in the Bible but written on the
[7:51] pages is not enough got to be alive it's
[7:55] got to a and that's what we're talking
[7:58] about we're being drawn to the word by
[8:02] the word then it was written in a person
[8:05] but this person couldn't he took he got
[8:11] one word out I said I inserted a word
[8:13] that's my my illustration of a warning
[8:15] you insert one extra thing with an
[8:18] actual attribute and it just messes it
[8:21] up now here you got a line in a zebra
[8:22] it'll never be able to do and I don't
[8:25] think there's a real creature like that
[8:26] some I just made up that picture but
[8:28] you'll never once you have one thing to
[8:31] it it'll never be able to reproduce
[8:33] right it will never be able to go back
[8:36] to being a line or being a zebra and
[8:39] they'll be able to make another line
[8:40] because it's now it's all it's all off
[8:43] killed 40 all messed up and and that's
[8:47] why now God the book went back in the
[8:51] guards here now he's like well I'm just
[8:54] I'm going to come down to myself fun and
[8:57] that's why i did now what was written
[9:00] those attributes that were written now
[9:02] they're written in the man he's walking
[9:04] this is the fullness of Godhead bodily
[9:05] although that r abuse all those little
[9:08] things are now in this man that's
[9:10] walking on the shore Galilee and that
[9:12] means if that attribute that one day you
[9:14] heard that scripture in and clicking
[9:16] something inside unit came to like that
[9:18] actually that one was in that main I say
[9:21] because he was a fullness chaotic body
[9:23] all the little boxes think of those
[9:25] attributes one day you walk alone when
[9:27] they listen to the radio as the song
[9:29] those or listen to a creature and that
[9:31] actually that's why there might be a
[9:33] little picture that just something
[9:34] strikes personally me because that
[9:36] little word that you heard was oh so
[9:38] personal it just it just spring to life
[9:42] yep and that word was in here and if
[9:45] that word if that were missing you now
[9:48] within him then you're just as eternal
[9:50] as he that's right and look what he
[9:54] began to do those attributes that
[9:57] actually has to be spoken right so he
[10:00] began to preach he began to sow that
[10:03] seed and it and then live what he had to
[10:08] do in John 12 23 jesus H you can say the
[10:11] hour is coming that the son of man
[10:12] should be glorified very liberally I say
[10:15] to you except the corner we fall into
[10:17] the ground and die it abideth alone but
[10:19] if it died bringeth forth much fruit so
[10:23] he's so word by his teaching now that
[10:25] corner weeks got to go down on the
[10:26] ground so that what if the carcass
[10:31] here's that here's that gruesome picture
[10:33] I was talking about that this is what
[10:35] attracts the bride this is what attracts
[10:37] all the inkless because we're attracted
[10:39] by God shedding is like that he said the
[10:43] except to eat my flesh and drink my
[10:44] blood you have no life in the car with
[10:47] me and we're not eating is his actual
[10:50] literal flesh but his his word is flesh
[10:52] I word baba says the Word was made flesh
[10:55] and dwelt among us now now here's the
[11:02] big mystery it seems like growing up you
[11:05] know so many people couldn't quite
[11:07] pinpoint exactly how to get born again
[11:08] is it when you pray do you get a
[11:10] cessation your prey until you feel
[11:13] something still something nice and
[11:15] totally overlooked the word I see so
[11:18] many people doing that today think they
[11:20] are say well I'm not going to go to this
[11:22] church anymore why because i don't like
[11:24] a song winger because some
[11:25] my feelings but it's never about the
[11:27] word when you hear somebody leaving our
[11:29] churches almost never about the words
[11:30] never by the doctrine it's always
[11:33] because you get your feelings hurt or
[11:34] something so silly right that's why a
[11:37] believers focus is on the word the word
[11:40] is the main thing it's been the main
[11:42] focus of the whole thing I feel good on
[11:45] in now so this is the whole process the
[11:54] corner beat goes into the ground now I
[11:56] know he gave His life it goes in the
[11:58] ground it's going to be covered up it's
[11:59] got to go on a good girl good ground
[12:01] where it don't matter like like that dog
[12:03] speaking of you know brother rooms
[12:05] preach that sermon a message of a
[12:07] wounded or the snow white of a link of
[12:11] snow white deliver about how that does
[12:13] it he didn't care and want to see maybe
[12:16] just to illustrate wanted to see God
[12:18] worked on the pass and while I was
[12:20] shooting at it it didn't matter it had a
[12:23] goal in mind and I went and until you
[12:26] know maybe a wing halfway shot off for
[12:28] whatever well that's the way God was
[12:31] when he came down to give his life for
[12:32] us and that's where the believers got to
[12:34] be I don't matter how many girls are
[12:37] fired to how many people were saying
[12:39] stuff back to you i'm going to wrestle
[12:40] through until you get to the word i
[12:42] think no matter what stands in your way
[12:45] you want the word you will see God's
[12:47] work in the field so this is called we
[12:51] go to the ground and then one look at
[12:54] this process I was reading this a
[12:57] gardeners blog about how a seed
[13:00] germinates what's the process that it
[13:02] goes through I think I
[13:05] see begin us the German extermination is
[13:08] when you gotta see it and begin it
[13:09] breaks forth that's what that's what
[13:11] germination is calling it start to grow
[13:14] a seed begins the germination process
[13:16] when the seed coat is interrupt what's
[13:18] that mean that little that little far
[13:20] cope around outside they eat all this
[13:24] can't get out of it because it's hard it
[13:27] can't get you know it is preventing it
[13:30] so what's going to happen is it's got a
[13:32] ride you got to let go all your ideas
[13:35] and say God whatever let thy will be
[13:37] done what you were is first and then the
[13:41] water can permeate in there right and
[13:45] this blog on recent science don't even
[13:47] understand but something happens when
[13:49] that water gets in that seat enzymes
[13:51] began to react to something all sudden
[13:54] the spring forth and out goes a little a
[13:57] little seemingly insignificant but look
[14:00] at look at the new birth experience you
[14:02] hear the word and then the Spirit comes
[14:04] in clickers in all of a sudden you maybe
[14:05] somebody interest Kenya came to see
[14:07] what's happening but it says a little
[14:08] something happens and just a little
[14:11] spark and it starts growing and and now
[14:17] this is maybe I don't know what kind of
[14:18] plan
[14:19] get your tongue but but now we're not
[14:22] talking about a little Peter something
[14:23] we're talking about like Davis said i
[14:25] will be playing it like a tree planted
[14:27] by the rivers of water so on you you
[14:29] grow up in a great sycamore tree like
[14:31] that that you won't be shaken by your
[14:33] win the doctor I have a thing that comes
[14:34] along with all kinds of silliness you'll
[14:36] know exactly where you stand in exactly
[14:38] where they treat their that's exactly
[14:39] what up what who you are and what you
[14:42] are and whe when you begin to see who
[14:43] you are yeah then the bride will take a
[14:48] by chance
[14:55] a cv has a germination process when the
[14:59] c code is interrupted in the internal
[15:01] parts of the sea began to taking up
[15:04] water plant that seed in that frontal
[15:08] ground and and just let God where thy
[15:11] will be done and give yourself over God
[15:14] you know that like like I was mentioned
[15:17] last time psalm 42 David you gotta pray
[15:19] it's getting front of God to say nothing
[15:21] sometimes you got to do that you got it
[15:23] just lay down unless you're so we'll
[15:26] just pour out to God so if you come and
[15:28] fill it up and the internal parts of the
[15:33] cpk to take up water that's pee real
[15:36] quick and I see the water that you've
[15:38] heard and make it come to life and then
[15:41] all that word all that preaching that
[15:43] Jesus has done on the day of Pentecost
[15:45] that spirit failing quick and has seen
[15:47] the life and now they can go out and
[15:50] start preaching they can start that
[15:53] those attributes that were in God before
[15:55] the foundation of the world they can
[15:57] begin to speak those attributes and that
[15:59] is the greater works greater works shall
[16:02] you do because they now that Holy Spirit
[16:05] is in them to begin to speak out and
[16:08] give life to people to bring that same
[16:11] new birth because the light of the sea
[16:12] guys to come through the body is coming
[16:14] through the it's coming through these
[16:16] people and Christians and now they
[16:20] become written a Scrooge that what was
[16:22] written in the stars and the pyramid in
[16:26] the Bible now
[16:27] main benefits the least in these people
[16:29] these acts crees all these things that
[16:31] were written in God that were written in
[16:34] the hill this is all kind of a it's a
[16:37] little bit hard to explain me and that's
[16:40] why brother Graham said you'll never
[16:40] really be able to understand without a
[16:44] New York without that teacher to give
[16:45] you a spiritual and extended stays these
[16:50] attributes this word that was written in
[16:52] God and see see the way I'm doing it I'm
[16:55] going back it up now so he came he came
[16:58] down yeah man I like going back up with
[17:01] him back up look this is a Iranians
[17:09] Polycarp and Martin Luther it's written
[17:14] in the US it's only written in the last
[17:16] day no it was written on down who's
[17:19] seven churches they learned that they
[17:20] had it was flicking to them any change
[17:22] that's why I said I'll and the last a
[17:24] little social lesson it when i read this
[17:28] was on there there were they he had
[17:29] those preachers under him they better
[17:32] say exactly what he was preaching you
[17:34] better word on the Martin Luther they
[17:36] better stay exactly with the messenger
[17:38] for your bed just pretty exact because
[17:40] the you're trying to fulfill those
[17:43] attributes fulfill god's word the word
[17:46] for your name maybe if you add anything
[17:48] to it it screws up the plan but get it
[17:51] um it won't bring forth it won't
[17:54] manifest the word for the measurement
[17:56] day now per million church age milligram
[18:00] said let's get us in folks
[18:07] oh this is a google now let us take a
[18:11] scriptural warning here was it not of
[18:12] the days of Moses whom God had
[18:14] vindicated at Cora rose up and let's do
[18:16] that mighty prophet be disputed with
[18:18] Moses and claimed that he has much from
[18:20] God to lead the people on that other
[18:21] share the divine revelation as well as
[18:24] did Moses he denied the authority of
[18:27] Moses and other people back there after
[18:29] they had heard the true word and well
[18:31] acquainted with the fact that a true
[18:33] prophet was vindicated of God I say
[18:36] those people fell for and his gang
[18:38] sayings skip down they have the little
[18:41] at four years old our hands and balls of
[18:44] fire on the platform they are women
[18:45] preachers let women cut their hair wear
[18:47] slacks and shorts and bypass the Word of
[18:50] God for their own creeds and darling
[18:52] doggies now that's what kind of what I'm
[18:54] getting at is that somebody focus on
[18:56] these little all these little tangential
[18:57] things um the Golden Calf schemes all
[19:01] our hands and balls of high on the
[19:02] platform like like you know Elijah when
[19:05] he got in a cave and he was interested
[19:07] in that still small voice which is the
[19:08] word you know that outside it came there
[19:11] earthquake in the fire and all these
[19:13] different things but a lot of things
[19:15] that that people kind of get distracted
[19:17] by the main thing the main focus is the
[19:20] word of God it's still small voice it's
[19:22] something that maybe just seems so
[19:25] insignificant too many people I still
[19:27] small voice is the word of God yeah that
[19:30] they allow women preachers letting women
[19:32] cut their hair or wear shorts and slides
[19:34] and bypass the world
[19:35] their own fries and daughter was that
[19:37] shows what kind of seeds in them some
[19:39] something had something a little bit
[19:41] extra that they can't come to life yeah
[19:44] but not all of people turn on Moses and
[19:46] left the Word of God that's true in this
[19:47] day not everybody turned know the elect
[19:50] stayed within the same is happening
[19:51] today many are leaving the word but some
[19:54] are staying with it but remember the
[19:57] parable of the wheat no takers the tears
[19:59] on TV boo boo for burning these apostate
[20:01] churches are getting down cluster
[20:02] pushing the other ready for the prior to
[20:04] document a shot but the wheat is going
[20:07] to be gathered to the master now there's
[20:09] the answer to the question later on
[20:10] where will they be get any response that
[20:14] where the equals are where the carcasses
[20:16] the Eagles will begin together because
[20:18] the week is being added the master plan
[20:20] I go on where is going to the word
[20:24] that's what we want it back that's well
[20:26] that's what we're going right now this
[20:29] may be seemed like something so far I
[20:31] hear so many people people sprite songs
[20:34] and things about when i get over there
[20:36] then then kissing that and these and
[20:38] others but but God came down here so
[20:41] that his word could be manifesting us
[20:43] right here but and of course you know
[20:47] that is the sign of his coming that he's
[20:50] president he's he's manifesting himself
[20:52] now the word is fully open so that these
[20:55] things can come to pass in it now
[21:02] so Luke 1737 answered send me aware or
[21:05] and instead of them were so ever the
[21:07] body are still there will be Eagles
[21:09] together and and in that comparison
[21:11] scripture where makkac gels in Matthew
[21:13] 24 point 7 24 is the Lightning cometh
[21:16] out of the east and shyness even into
[21:18] the width should social officer the
[21:20] coming of the Son of man how's it going
[21:24] to be how God going to come by over the
[21:29] other order for wheresoever the caucus
[21:32] is there or the Eagles be gathered
[21:34] together all right let's kind of look at
[21:37] some quotes now this is the quote word
[21:40] yummy so am I asking about your
[21:41] scripture he explains it what is the
[21:46] carcass the Cardinals is what the Eagles
[21:48] feed on now I evil is considered in the
[21:50] Bible of profit the profit is the Eagle
[21:52] God called himself an eagle and we're
[21:54] eat less then the believers you see and
[21:56] what is the carcass that they feed on is
[21:58] the word wherever the word is the true
[22:00] nature of the bird will show itself see
[22:03] I ego which ones freshman team establish
[22:06] freshman he's not are not a buzzard he's
[22:08] an eagle you can't give me no
[22:09] denominational stuff to him he's got to
[22:11] have Eagles for you that's the freshest
[22:13] come to me not what Moses doesn't know
[22:15] what somebody else does not want saintly
[22:17] Phoenix knocks calendar right now the
[22:19] meat that's killed for this day and
[22:20] that's the part of Christ that died to
[22:23] make use word be confirmed that's where
[22:25] they get it CC now this is something
[22:30] that many of us here that have been a
[22:32] missed for a long time something is this
[22:35] seems so simple but this is I believe
[22:37] this is like the foundation of the
[22:39] message that everything is centered on
[22:41] the word the whole thing is a is so
[22:46] simple and it goes over are the thing
[22:49] because of the hand of the thing he
[22:50] loves is the wise and the prudent if I
[22:52] be careful and everything because it
[22:54] just just read your Bible every day a
[22:57] break my friend is your church could it
[22:59] be that soon I'll be a little bit right
[23:04] right exactly now there's there's a
[23:08] picture God feeding us know now this is
[23:13] kind of a strange thing to understand
[23:15] but this believe as he died so that we
[23:18] can feast on his body or word and so
[23:21] it's almost it's almost difficult to
[23:23] illustrate by a picture like this here
[23:25] working on the potty word of Christ and
[23:27] crisis fetus will become Christ and
[23:35] jealousy 63 said it is the spirit Lee
[23:37] quickness of flesh profiteth nothing
[23:39] yeah the words that i speak unto you
[23:42] they are spirit and they are life the
[23:44] time i was reading through all this
[23:49] almost question places where Bill Graham
[23:51] said run for your life and I believe
[23:54] that's what we should be doing which if
[23:55] you run it and now more than ever run
[23:57] into the word that's what really i
[23:59] scriptures talking about the english
[24:01] money will be gathered to the word and
[24:04] now more than ever if you if you don't
[24:06] or anything now's the time and i get in
[24:09] the Bible getting the scripture and and
[24:11] really prove it out place I like a
[24:12] brother we should approve out what you
[24:14] believe and get in there and study it
[24:17] out and see me if they spend it true you
[24:19] had a picture that
[24:24] yes something well thank you were just
[24:28] we get big money exactly come because
[24:31] God I come back for a little babies

[25:12] word 82 quickened by the spirit like a
[25:14] spark they slid off of something to make
[25:16] it a lot and seated now in heavenly
[25:19] places in prison 10 already alive and
[25:21] subject to put every promise in the word
[25:24] then what does that do you being a part
[25:26] of God Jeannie if hard words other than
[25:30] a part of God were seated together
[25:33] manifest the entire body of Christ
[25:36] because there's no living among see what
[25:40] he's talking about what about no 11 and

[26:06] written that you know we're gonna take a
[26:07] by change that it's written up all these
[26:09] things about sickness in the illness but
[26:11] every time this is my king of Jesus yeah
[26:13] that He healed them if you're
[26:15] threatening you can believe it and
[26:16] receive the word let that spirit coming
[26:18] quick and it may collide you Nathaniel
[26:21] devil inhale can take it away then you
[26:23] gotta get on the rock but what's written
[26:25] it up because up it was written if it if
[26:30] it becomes in a manifestation it's an
[26:33] eternal attribute of God listening
[26:34] internal word of god that cannot all
[26:38] Devils inhale can change if they if they
[26:41] pull it all the all the demon stallions

[31:25] mysteries of Revelation the last message
[31:27] for the last 2 change fulfills exactly
[31:29] at this age the day when the Son of man
[31:32] shall be revealed although now skip on
[31:36] down the people still in doubt and as
[31:38] usual the church is just as fun trying
[31:41] and that is the truth amen and you know
[31:43] why I oppose them because their eyesight
[31:46] is on something other than God were at
[31:48] their eyes not single if that I be
[31:50] seeing right now look at God's Word is
[31:52] looking at all the other times but all
[31:54] right then I'm already talked about
[31:56] granite background yes we're here that's
[32:00] what ever you know you can undergo a
[32:03] scroll all things to look at this so
[32:05] many legs is the brother ground wrong I
[32:08] don't like it that he did you've cleared
[32:10] luggage created I don't like it he
[32:13] didn't the news article of the days that
[32:15] didn't list all people that were killed
[32:17] this you can look at you know that they
[32:20] did the same thing to teach us and he
[32:22] says he said you know John came and he
[32:24] didn't you're drinking said this is such
[32:26] a specialist that's about human and the
[32:28] Son of man came and he eaten and drank
[32:31] we caught him a lot of everybody you
[32:32] know he said wisdom is justified were
[32:35] children in other words you you know
[32:37] you're gonna come up with something to
[32:40] criticize anywhere has come up with so
[32:42] many criticized but the main thing is to
[32:44] stay with God's Word and how do you even
[32:47] know what God weren't really talking
[32:49] about how do you stay with God with you
[32:51] must be boring and I think and it starts
[32:53] with as simple as we're being can be
[32:55] baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[32:56] such promises of the Utah although your
[32:59] children and so forth and me as an
[33:01] organized also call it starts with
[33:03] repeated let that OSHA just fall away
[33:06] even said where we go and hear the word
[33:09] that you know they they didn't hear much
[33:11] word I therefore the men and women on
[33:13] the outside the doors of that little
[33:15] upper room Peter just priests a little
[33:18] sermon little scheme and summon you
[33:19] killed him the one that you thought was
[33:21] coming to killing and then he told him
[33:23] this the TV open teach to him and they
[33:25] believe they heard that word that
[33:26] receive it and it was flicking tool and
[33:28] that little that little life begin to
[33:31] germinate kemon so we have no excuse we
[33:35] have excellent no excuse for being in
[33:37] doubt for me and still purple and
[33:39] wondering on one of the stars 20 a
[33:40] winner which which church near who's
[33:42] preaching the truth of who is doing that
[33:44] we should we should be I believe now we
[33:48] should be like trees planted by the
[33:50] water that should not be moving from
[33:52] that shall not be moved but not should
[33:55] not but shall I not be rude
[34:00] I got maybe two more minutes so let me
[34:02] just read a few and I was getting hot
[34:04] here yep that fan is really just speak a
[34:10] word as a man confirm the words God to
[34:12] say something is one thing God to do it
[34:14] is another thing God don't need eating
[34:15] interpreter he does his own
[34:16] interpretation go now I put this corner
[34:19] here because that's what he's doing now
[34:20] all these scriptures have been written I
[34:22] think the attributes re-written and you
[34:24] look around some might look around and
[34:27] say well nothing is happening but you
[34:30] know that remove that little boy that
[34:31] went out on the boat with runarounds
[34:32] deacon and he said how can I see God
[34:34] well that Deacon everybody else is with
[34:36] around I off Cena that diga said all i
[34:38] see is God wants guns on the inside how
[34:41] can you look around and say nothing's
[34:43] happened because it's happening to you
[34:44] and I might I might not be aware of
[34:47] what's happening if anybody else to see
[34:49] the life being they manifest remember
[34:50] but as won't see it in yourself and it
[34:53] can't see in yourself and go back to the
[34:55] word go back to your little prayer room
[34:56] until let everything just die out until
[34:59] that life becomes germinated in India
[35:01] going back what I say their message
[35:06] nothing
[35:09] whoever's up there out of the way not
[35:14] speaking
[35:16] Mary you'll ever see you only see that
[35:19] everything so now we've seen a miracle
[35:23] you know that is the truth that is and
[35:26] that's what still most people they look
[35:28] at that place on how far they look to
[35:30] that asking and people with problems
[35:32] whatever my skin problem wrong you know
[35:35] who those would that kind of that steer
[35:38] somebody away from from looking at
[35:40] seeing the word God but that that's
[35:42] exactly right that's the truth that's
[35:44] what stumble people in Jesus day they
[35:47] were saying you're not matter of a phony
[35:49] or whatever and not made a desired yep a
[35:52] man licking himself god I'm saying all
[35:54] these things and and and and they got
[35:57] they need to stumble over the fact that
[35:59] he would heal people own son over
[36:00] Sabbath yeah like my goodness you know
[36:02] how blind can we be much but watching
[36:05] make sure that we're not just one and
[36:07] they come a time when Abraham saw his
[36:09] last night just before so I was burning
[36:11] that was God manifesting himself in the
[36:14] following remain
[36:18] and I got some more folks but I'm best
[36:21] that's pretty much all i would say and I
[36:23] think that as an excellent place to stop
[36:25] back get also really himself ya know
