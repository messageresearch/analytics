they turn ing amen amen yesterday we oh I've never you know had a problem with uh recognize people a lot of times anyhow anyhow's sister McNally Doris McDowell she was sitting behind us and and they turned around shaking hands with everybody and I didn't expect to see her but she was there yesterday and glad to seeing her out and it was a little chain the small casheen girl you know she thought as I am then and I'll tell you what it is she walked up to me and they shook my hand I said who is this like that you know but then Rebecca I could walk in there a minute ago she had her hair it wasn't pulling back you know and I thought who's that what an idiot anyhow you know if I run into you in that condition you always forgive me of that amen so another thing happened yesterday and uh brother he turned around and looked at me and I thought golly if uh Lucy Kelly gonna be dead you know and yeah her sister saying yesterday and uh Sister Mary Beth was up behind the pulpit and you can see from her nose up and I was able to get out and behind before but she didn't hear me you know but anyhow he'll probably be on the internet y'all see it indeed Open the Eyes of My Heart alone foreign because you're seeing Jesus Christ that's right amen good way to see you man amen good to be in the house of the Lord good to see everybody out yeah brother Bob mom and dad with us all right just pray the Lord we bless and guide each one that's where the dick said we had a good time at the fellowship meeting yesterday and the Lord willing to win in March will be at brother pageants so remember that you know we've had many sicklemongers and many have gotten back in and gotten overcome the bugs yeah things and you know we appreciate that I appreciate the Lord being with each one um the Richard Marlow was sick this morning and brother Al and brother Gary so we know those are are not feeling good so just pray that the Lord would be with each one do you remember brother Howell he's sick of the lowest I've seen him in 19 years he's falling out most of you remember that brother Bill York the kind of tall guy that came a time or two back here under a few months ago he passed away this past week so just remember the family and everybody in it you know the big tall blonde-headed guy that came with Brother Ray and they really you know to remember that Revelations 1. Revelation to eight I believe that's all the announcements anything else to be made just pray that the Lord would bless each and every one of us father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us yes thank you for the day that we have the time that we can Lord you know hustle and bustle of life and all kind of things but to be able to just gather together and sit down lord and wait upon you and in doing that then we know that surely you will come and stick to our hearts because that's our desire is for you to have your way with each and every one of us forgive our sins and lead us by thy Grace and love remember the sickness Lord among us and you said you said your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you and we just committed all into your hands now as we read your word we ask that you would come and speak to our hearts because that's our desire we love you and we thank you Father committing it all now into thy hands most of all forgive our sins because we want to stand completely and just have your way now in Jesus name amen Revelations one we've been reading this scripture and one of these days we'll get over far enough you'll see why I've been reading Revelations one there's a revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel and to his servant John and by record of the word of God under the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand and one of these days we'll get over there I think it's about 21 or 22. it comes back to that it says the time is at hand right so we appreciate that okay Revelations eight one and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we have been quite a while on the yesterday's getting everything down and you will understand maybe a little later on when we we try to get on over past chapter 10 because we really got up to uh the reading eight one but we're over basically in chapter 10 in our studies in the Book of Revelations and you know after this part that we get through with this um dealing with the uh the 11 12 13 14 I don't know how much we'll put into each one uh as understanding but I want you to think about it and I wish you would go back and read the book of Daniel and and read that and then and think of that in relation to what uh we will try to be covering because to me the Book of Daniel is uh it's not many different Visions now I know he had them because it's over a period of time and like John was writing two years on Patmos you know and it only took him two days to write the whole book you know if he was just sitting down writing but he was two years in getting it and writing it down and see the Book of Daniel then to me I've always loved it because it's a continuation of opening up of things to show you uh after the prophet has brought us to understanding showing us the end time showing us the Journey of life and things in the Book of Daniel and this wonderful story but it just to me it's like you see this and then you see more and then you see more and then you see more all right and it's all One Vision then one uh things are transpiring one uh whatever you want to call it uh scenes or or whatever and to me that's the way I see the Book of Revelation because especially as we'll get on over now a little bit later and you'll see that like showing you for instance what I'm talking about in chapter in the sixth chapter where the opening of the seals uh especially say The Sixth Seal and and this talks about an earthquake it talks about things that are transpiring and and we know that the prophet brought us those understandings of it to see those things but then when you read the 11th chapter or something like that that's actually just a repeat of The Sixth Seal because what it is it's just telling you there about this 144 000 and that's where the prophet got the understanding to preach on The Sixth Seal you know and then preaching on The Sixth Seal he would cure it and bring in all about the 144 000 the ceiling in the foreheads and the different thing and see you'll find out then basically from chapter 10 on over to uh the white Throne about the 17th chapter that is actually a three and a half year period right amen uh you know it it will trash it will tell about how these begins and and ends but it's dealing with this tribulation period man it's what it will be doing and that's what I said that's where the Prophet then when he preached The Sixth Seal see he knew already the story behind the two witnesses and so he brings that out and he tells you about this and he brings that out and and things and if we can get there this afternoon I want to make one um message kind of showing you uh what I think that he saw and why he spoke the way he did and and covering the things that he saw and then see if we can see ourselves amen all right now because we're going to start moving up some in our we've just worked basically been grinding to get the foundation all right and that's just my way of doing it but now we want to pick up a little and we'll be repeating a lot of what we've said but I want us to pick it up into what is what does it mean to you and I amen right right you know I mean we can study the Book of Revelation it's like I told you oh anybody today oh they say Oral Roberts University has a complete set of brother Brown's message well you know what they don't wrote around say it right you know you could call them up and if there's anybody studied that right you know you could call them up and say well why did Brother Reynolds say on the first seal well let's say I wanted somebody was writer and and they would tell you the things that he said all about it and give you verbatim the statements of what it is right all right I mean you can say well what did he say about this and they could tell you that why because they have it right but because that we have it doesn't mean we have the Revelation that's what I've been trying to drive home amen and I want to drive that harder and harder because people say we have the message yes well anybody that wants to go on the internet yep that's right that's right right can search the message all right man it's not just because we've got it in our hands everybody's got it that's right once it was made public domain so even anybody can download a sermon anybody can do a search thing because you can go on their internet systems and and and it's not just that you can search to see what wrote around and said anybody in the world today can search to see what the prophet had to say there's never been a day like this even in the days of the Lord Jesus there was no way that the world could have seen everything it was only just a a small group of people or something like that so small a number of people that actually you that Jesus Christ was on the Earth but he realized that whether they want to agree with it or whether they're looking up to argue about it or trying to to whatever that anybody in the world today that has a computer can right get the message and tell you exactly what wrote around him talk and if they don't even have a computer they can get the MP3s the CDs the cassettes and you know any kind of thing to to do and all they got to do is just right and people send it to him so it's not the destination oh we're wonderful people because we have the message that's true amen that's true but we can't rest in the basis of just saying we have the message the world don't have this message now that's where where you people are wrong the world has this message you don't believe me go back there and turn the computer on anybody in the world that has a computer has an ability to tell you what run around saying right amen that can be a good thing or it can be a bad thing because there won't be no argument when you if you're called into judgment they won't get no excuse I'm saying y'all don't know what we're talking about if y'all just knew this message they said well what do you want to know about it yeah you know what you want to know what right around town on one God there's y'all the quotes you want to know what he taught American divorce I heard the book man it's a wonderful day amen but yet they can take the message now twist it earn it do whatever that's right and make it say what you want to do and that asks you to say well did he say this yeah it kind of reminds me I remember a story seeing it that when they were asking Martin Luther you know they said well will you recant for what is written you know he said what I've written I won't right no yeah go see there's a lot of other people that added a lot of things do what he said but he said well what I've written that's right I am no way can recant from them what did you say it's all right to burn all the Catholic churches but we got a book here that says you sitting you see they couldn't argue the point that's like I told you years ago was up in Indiana and I remember it this is probably about 1970 might have been a 68. and brother Billy Paul said that the World Council of churches ordered a church age book well ain't nobody can get a true change book I mean all you had to do was just go to somebody as a Believer and give you a trustee they were just all over the place but you see they ordered one which means they can use it as evidence because you could claim well we didn't write that they said well here's your publication you see Church we're living in a wonderful day amen but we're sitting here facing those things that can destroy us run out of the message Itself by being out on the internets and things like that well what a wonderful day amen all right thank God but at the same time I can search to find out what brother Reynolda said anybody else it's not just because we've got the message it's whether or not it's been revealed she didn't with that in mind I've tried to make that point over to us because see we used to say we we have a message people don't know what we're talking about right now having the message and then being revealed it's two different times right amen amen that's two different times me right it's not something that you don't know about right it's whether or not it's been revealed right amen there's the main thing Amen brother said we need a revelation more than anything now we've been as I said in this talking on the seventh seal found the prophet said a lot of things about the seventh seed and we say well it's just silence in heaven for space a half hour but we found he said a lot of things he's told us what it was he said it was the end of all things he said it was those seven thunders of Revelations 10. which is a revelation contained in the Seven Seals he's told us that this messenger of Malachi 4 will do two things one turn the hearts of the children back and other reveal the revelations of the seven Thunders which is the Revelation contained in the seagulls he told us it's the coming of the Lord now those things we went through right you know go look at it but he's told us that you cannot add to the word you cannot take away then you say well well then my idea the seventh seal is not what what does it make Endeavors what your idea is my idea who's ideal what did the prophet say even Oral Roberts University tell you what he's saying they wouldn't say this is our idea about it you asked us what he said we give it up we'll give you the page number but you see in the message were revelated people we're always looking for some form of of a great understanding that nobody else don't have no and in doing that see then we wind up come find out most time we wind up not having it or sale right amen but still listen to something that the prophet said in the Bible says that there's silence in heaven we've had over the years emphasis placed upon by a lot of preachers and things that in using quotes from run around them they would say that uh see they're the Seven Seals not even written well it says there's silence in heaven there's not a blank in Revelations 8 1 right all right it says there's silence in heaven right amen all right then we went through where the Prophet would say this is my revelation of it paragraph 245 of the seventh sealed he said this is my revelation of it well it's like I told you then we we we say well now she'll one two three four five six then we come to seven he said well this is my Revelation he told us what his Revelation was of seal number one I have to be dependent upon him to to be able to understand what seal number one is don't you but he said this is my revelation right well when he come to the seventh seal it wasn't his revelation of a revelation of a revelation and had no Revelation all right amen I hope that come out right I'm trying to put another point in his foot when it says they silence in heaven that's written in the Bible amen so that means the seven sealed in the Bible there was a problem with the brother Brown coming along then and we gave the quote where he said he said this seven sins even spoke up from Genesis all these seals just broke up coming down from Jesus well it's not an addition to the book nope that's right you remember they said to him run around with your ability said you could write a 23rd chapter of Revelation you said they're trying to drown me right he said no he said you can't add two well those seven Thunders brother random won't that be something that will be given to someone he said watch what you're saying right right because you're saying that someone is going to receive something that is not written that's your implication and then that way you can make it anything you want it to be I can say my big doses haven't sealed what you can say it's yours is well that's being silly now it's just I have no scripture for my big Toby and God that's right man but we do have a message that is the message is perfect sure the messenger had flaws in his human abilities in the speech and things but the message is perfect that's right but it's just written and all this in the same basis to me that's why it's so wonderful to read and study is because it's just like the Bible was written then we have the people of nation say you know and it's fine line these up get them lined up with that stud but if you don't know how to get this one lined up with that one I mean you got all you want to about the two shots on the gun thank you yeah and if you lay that gun down in a vise and clamp it down and buckle it down and right get down there and look down through there it's going to show the same thing every time right right but if you hold it up in your hand it's gonna float around right and you ain't gonna be hitting at a horse breath in a hundred dollars you're gonna be lucky with iron shots of the two inch group and 100 yards or something no but you see that's the way we try to make it something why worry about making it something amen that's right if we're going to depend upon one two three four five six of the seals for you know the prophet to review it and we're going to depend upon marriage and divorce if we're going to depend upon this the serpent seat the one God the all of the things then why can't we depend upon what he says about it amen Brothers amen let's say what a prophet said but yet they're arguing whether the Seal's broke or not the Bible says it is yes but we just don't know what we we know what them other seals are now how did you know what they are right how did you come to the ability right of understanding field number one right because of the quote I love to give to you the brother Reynolds said they'd be a prophetic gift we've been over at and over and out on questions and answers on the sealed he said the seventh seal doesn't reveal anything what's going to happen to it because at the end of that church age is to come a prophetic gift to reveal these things amen until we're totally dependent upon him for everything well we better be totally dependent upon the seven three under the seventh seal to tell us what it is right that's right then when he said this is my revelation of it all right amen and then he'll say it's no seven Thunders Revelations 10. then he'll say it's the end of all things then he Obsessed the coming of the Lord the thing that even Jesus didn't know when he would return now we can go through the last message and see what is being said to us to help us to understand amen what does it mean to you to find out what it meant to him we must do that and we'll deal more of that this evening with what it meant to him but if we don't find out what it means to us then where are we at e amen sorry no no different than Oral Roberts University with the tapes and books lesbian in front of me that's right you certainly don't get the message reading Greer's Almanac right amen they truly must come by hearing amen right and hearing by the word of God right man not kept emphasizing something to you the other day that I want you to get this morning it says there's silence in heaven first place and a half hour I know that what the prophet has said and can quote with you know about it so the reason I say that is just for not to be smart ethically but to be the truthful I know that run around covers when it comes to seal number one he kind of drops back to Earth and brings things but remember seal number one number one never broke on Earth foreign was given to John brother Branham say it right and Ben was handed down he said to the seventh angel who proclaimed all right all right so you're not on an Earthly Journey just because that you can see that's right that's why that it turned out to be as we've been over to chapter 10. chapter 10 you find this Mighty Angel standing on Earth which is Christ right right around said that seventh angel has to be on earth at the time of this coming right talking to Revelations 10 1 and through there now you're dropping back to Earth because dropping back to Earth means we're dropping back to the point of where it can be revealed to us amen when John went up over in Revelations foresee five six seven eight nine ten it's things that are transpiring in heaven we want to get to Earth on a lot of it I said what I did a moment ago that chapters when you get into the Sixth Seal it just says there's an earthquake and this happens and that happens this happens right well we run around and covered what happened he said this is the Tribulation period man but he said this is worth 144 000 is called out well it doesn't lift 144 000 in chapter and The Sixth Seal is riding out see he's giving you his revelation but he's got scripture for it right it's not just his thoughts he's telling us the scriptures the seal breaks in heaven chapter five is in heaven chapter four is in heaven right right the breaking of chapter in chapter six of the first seal is in heaven Richard Bible see then it's revealed and brought down to us by way of the seventh angel amen right to tell us about these times amen how many years have we preached or the prophet said in chapter four of the Book of Revelation that the bride goes up amen and not seen until chapter 19. but see we're seeing by revelation what transpires in heaven now remember we were trying to bring out about the the prophet said no silence in heaven he goes right over to Revelation 10 and he brings out it's those seven Thunders then you back up to a message because uh Services it's just the time just prior to the seal he said those seven Thunders don't sound in heaven amen people say John was translated up and heard the Thunders right fine sure the blood around said Daniel heard the Thunders that's right but Daniel wasn't translated into heaven he was on Earth writing about divisions that was coming to it see those seven thunder sound on Earth amen amen why is there silence in heaven and where would that silence be related to in the scriptures you remember how I was bringing down and I hope you put this thing at least you snore or not or whatever you know you've been just a hire enough to understand I keep repeating things because it's very valuable to me amen he didn't The Sixth Seal there's no mention of hundred forty four thousand there's no mention of two Prophets in the writing of the 6C it was an earthquake it's things that happened transpired upon the Earth right but the prophet goes over into the 11th chapter 12 and on through and picking up that two witnesses and 144 000 right so that he's tied with the scriptures okay Dooney comes to Revelations 8 1 he said today silence in heaven because I want to tell you my Revelation jumps right over to revelation 10. come on read the book 2 45 with it Shield book I'm sitting here looking at it if you want me to read it he goes immediately to chapter 10. what because it says a silence in chapter 8. in chapter 10 it says Shield up right the things that the seven Thunders said and write them not so then the Bible they sealed with the seven Thunders silver Seven Seals the more you you're really Paul Roberts can say that right I hope they don't mind me using those terms you know because anybody with a book can read that right I can ask you anything that you can go in there and sit down on the computer just type in Thunder that'll come to you eventually and you can read it but listen he goes right straight to the thing that there's related to silence one if something is sealed up it's solid yes The Book of Daniel it comes to the end and Daniel says he's told by the Angels seal up the things and write it on yep would not be made known until the end time when the prophet would come to bring us the message right amen then we can understand the Book of Daniel in the Book of Revelation all right you see why the prophet would immediately go to that watch that this afternoon now when we tied together the Lord willing when we come down to the 10th Vision The Sword in the hand The Turk pull the things and and watch that again be repeating that's what I'm saying so it'd be good to write it down then when a prophet comes over to Revelation 8 1 it says silence in heaven he immediately because he knows by chapter 10. the seals have already been broken by the lamb amen come on read your Bible eight one comes before ten okay I'm not good in math if I get above that I'll take my shoes off but I can't at least but listen why wouldn't you immediately go to something that is see you around right around what is revelation 8 1. he said revelation 10. it's the thing that's sealed up those seven Thunders the book is sealed with the seven Thunder remember he said no no no no no you don't understand we got a quote here we're good just keep voting you'll find a good one where the Prophet said the seals are sealed with those seven Thunders sure he's gonna do those to understand we don't know what these seals are he even said that if the seventh seal wasn't broke and all week long he had said this is thus saith the Lord right come on and he said it throughout the week of the seagulls and all you know this is going to say if the Lord he gets over to the questions and answers and he said if God don't come and break that seven seal we're only presuming amen right what about having thus saith the Lord and your only person yeah come on you explain that now if you if you want questions you know people got questions they will watch this and what is that I got a lot of good ones I don't mean yours ain't no good when I just mean I got a lot of good ones but why would it immediately go from Revelations 8 1 over to Revelations 10. he said there's silence in heaven place a half hour to seal up those things which is having Thunder and write it not right but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the prophet said not in his years of preparation as he was restoring the faith of the fathers but he said when he begins to sound his message he brought around his message began with the opening of the seals right and he preached about three years the other was a restoration back to the faith of the fathers that was written in the book the seals is not an addition to the book or he would be a false prophet amen to try to tell us his revelation of something is not even written at all he just says a silence in heaven now brother randomly face silence in heaven I can understand and go with you and believe you jump over to Revelations 10 to find and show me something dark that is sealed up that nobody don't know anything about and that would make definitely a silence okay a lot of blabbering about what it is I hope I get down to the description in a minute but you know but that brought around I want to know one thing when you got to this part of explaining it and you said all in heaven Heaven stood in all you remember that he said they didn't move because he did said he'd give away the secret nobody around him where you at turning out on there I've got to get too much blabbering going on foreign so he's certainly not on Earth who is in heaven and I ask you a simple question where is a silence in heaven where's your scriptures brother random that you're going to your scriptural Prophet what are you going to tie it to you he said all them cherubims yep all them angels now I'm paraphrasing but I'm quoting him come on come on all those 24 elders standing in all Now where's he at he's in Revelations four and five right hmm come on you understand I hope you're catching on they run around had a scripture for things we must have scripture by way of him see not our own but our own gonna twist it like crazy so if I'm going to depend on him because if my tell me his Revelation I'm certainly going to depend upon him tell me the scripts right all right I I may be doing but I ain't stupid all right but you go to chapter four and five like I said I've got a lot of questions but is the bride does she go up in Revelation 4 1 is that the words of the prophet well I want to ask you a simple little question how can they be 24 elders in chapter four and five a simple question foreign who are those 24 Elders he said the 12 apostles and the 12 Patriarchs right right now I can understand because of rapture in chapter four bringing it and John cop in the rapture to be able to go up to heaven to see things but how can those 12 Patriarchs be there I got questions too right would also like something else it was said one time about me you know we were speaking one time on marriage and divorce a certain man he was up speaking and I got up behind him and I asked a few questions and he raised his hand and the end of it and he said I hate it when a man asked a question when he's on the one in the building's got the answer I said I wouldn't ask the question if I didn't have the answer right you want to sit down and talk we talk I don't ask the question that I don't know the answer you say well I asked questions because I don't know them you don't study long enough if you study a long time you'll find out there's an answer all right just like run around them now there's silence in heaven first place a half hour where have you got a scripture for that he said well okay he says although the elders all those angels and all those shirt beams and things are standing in all Now where's he at he's in chapter five he has a scripture he knows where he's at but still brother random I want to know one thing because in chapter 5 all at once it becomes a from a situation of standing in awe it comes to a time of a holly glorious elated wonderful right shouting Glory Hallelujah time in chapter 5. right even John said everybody in the world heard me hollering that's right amen right but you better read your Bible John wouldn't hollering until the lamb took the book right are we in the scripture do we need to read chapter five for you to know what I'm talking about isn't there John sees that lost without a lamb to come over yep is that chapter five because he's all wrong without a lamb pull it up Brothers we might as well get all this out of the way while we at it you have brother Joe pull up chapter five I know you can do that Mary I'll talk a little bit see there's a silence in heaven first base of half hour then there's a rejoicing in heaven I don't really know how long that lasts did you I ain't gonna worry about it right but look I'm showing the right hand of him and said on the throne of what we're written with him on the back side sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the sealed Proclamation goes out is there anybody that steps up and tells you now wait a minute you're gonna read them down here just stay with me where I'm at okay but then I said we'll put it up and just read it when you see a book and a proclamation and he says no man in heaven nor on Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book needed to look their own okay there's much going on and I went much because no man was found worthy to open and read the book needed to look down now you know what the prophet said happened there was he said and this is a man that's had the baptism of the Holy Ghost for 60 years he's not wondering about whether or not he's saved right right right he ought to know by now pretty well that he is saved because he wouldn't be taken up to where he was if he hadn't been saved and you know he didn't use somebody else he used John but when John comes to this point of seeing things he knows there's something about the Plan of Redemption that is not complete yet right he has already written his gospel come only wrote John right you're with me the same one that wrote John the same one went to Batman scene 1995-96 right right he's already wrote about the savior he's already even said and wrote that John the Baptist said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world amen so he knew he was a savior he knew he was God he explains him in John 1 1 in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he's writing this somewhere around 80 50 according to the records it wasn't actually pinned as they went along somewhere close to 80 50 before gospels were written you remember Luke and Mark was not even one of The Originals all right and John had already written about these things he'd already seen maybe Millions saved under his ministry right are you the two what Regal difference right two or two million don't matter to God just get the point just what you say you say something to people how did he know they were for me you know then you buy them done gone and you ain't heard nothing else I'm saying you're gonna race it all after your computer went blank your brain open it back up I say those things that make you think the Falcon really run Spencer last night about something I said he said something about your smart man I said no I ain't smart I said a smart man is not one you think knows everything I said a smart man is not the one who knows everything he's already got his brain full of junk right a smart man is a man that knows where to go get what he needs you've heard me explain that a lot of times you know what he said Einstein said he said Einstein said why to try why try to remember what you can write to him I didn't know he said that that's the way these are pretty smart guy me and him get along a little bit don't put me in that yeah but listen I went much because no man was found where to open and read the book needed to look down so there was nobody running around screaming in the hallway it's in a quiet mode nobody's saying I know who can do it you know that brother random said the sages was there the prophets and things were fine you deck of 24 elders and get down in there with it and you'll find out there's a lot of things in there they were there but he said they wasn't Worthy so that get pretty quiet if I sit around here is anybody Worthy I wouldn't raise my hand and you wouldn't do yours either because you know you'd be wrong that's right so things is pretty quiet in heaven but then he went much and what they understand it may we not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book into Luke's The Seven Seals turn up okay a proclamation is made of one that can do it and what's the next verse and I'll be held in low in the midst of the throne in the full beast and in the midst of the elders instead of lamb as they'd been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spiritual Gods supporting that all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand to him that set up on the prom um there's your deadly hush silence right there yep even though the lamb has the book in his hand he hasn't said a word right I asked the person a question the other day which was not even a Christian he just don't crossed not derogatory to anybody and I just asked a simple question why was there silence in heaven first place a half hour there's no answer would be able to reply I said what would cause you now first we've got to get to standing all then we get to Rejoice him okay everybody understand how we're going to divide the Book of Revelation 5. well what can you think about what can you think about they would make you stand in awe now the fact about if you stay with me you know write it down if you want to whatever what would cause you to stand and cold all in reverence for 30 Minutes in Heaven which that could mean no telling what on Earth because that's what everybody's trying to figure it out they got it down to 21 years and they got it down to this and they got it down to that well my Lord it says silence in heaven don't say nothing about her watch silence in heaven when Heaven had no time right ain't no days and times and seasons in heaven go ahead but everybody's trying to figure out 30 minutes on Earth well it's about 21 years short door to me well it's over with by now about the 21 yet figure it out yeah but listen what could happen Robbie that would cause you to stand you know I'm afraid to move a muscle afraid about an eye what could happen well now what have you Brother David I just walk up to him and I hand him a million dollars be smart enough to know that ain't right that's right because you know what to do if I started handing out million dollar bills this day they'd be a stampede up this way and they'd be screaming and hollering are you getting the bullet you're letting me silence would it won't be no afternoon service yeah because it wouldn't be nobody here everybody be gone to pay the bills to buy the cars to buy the home to do the what surely wouldn't be silent what would cause you what would cause you because remember in chapter five you are supposed to be there that's right yep maybe not in a Corporal body because I don't personally believe Revelations 5 of this physical corporal I believe it's John in heaven seeing the future that can become physical and Corporal right that's right well it caused you to standing on remember those in heaven must be looking down to earth I made a little point a moment ago I didn't know where you followed it or not but the seven Thunders sound on Earth what would be that would cause you to stand in awe okay brother Dale you tell us what you think it is the thing that would cause me to stand in perfectly all in a condition would not be no materialistic nothing or any form you realize that a revelation is eternal you ever notice that God revealed something to you especially say you preachers you know to think about it God reveal something to you it takes you five years to preach what he showed you in a split second right right what about something sister Gail when you were standing in the kitchen there and he's mopping or whatever you're doing and you know what happened something spoke to you didn't it you said that ain't nothing but the truth but you just wasn't gone you know that time Stood Still sure amen now if that was only a blink a twink would try to figure out all of those things you know twinkling of an eye or this is a twitching or what whatever it is Revelation is eternal amen amen there's no beginning there's no ending when you saw this message was true you believe that run around with the prophet God sent a prophet a split second was what it was right right I heard people tell about you know that God had told him to do this and I heard a man one time then and he said God told him go fish over here and he said no Lord I'm gonna get you over here because they moved his water over here ain't nothing over there he's like this God's kept telling him he said go over here and fish now you don't argue with God if you think you do you're arguing with the wrong one you got the guy with the horns talking to you God don't argue with nobody run around and sit come down there in that room and meet me and tell me this and he said the rest of the day I spent it checking out to see whether it was true or not quoting from the silver you realize when something is revealed to you you're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and you agree how long Earthly time only a Split Second and I know God deals with you the rest of the day would do it but get what I'm saying he deals with you for months he does with me and I'm preaching on something that he spoke to me one Split Second I'm talking about how long it was when he revealed it to me you saw one God you saw water baptism it was just a was it are you catching on right yeah what would cause you to stand and all I think I can say this about everybody here amen at least I'll save for myself and I'm going to say it in a way there's a question if God would drop down right now and reveal to me in a Split Second that I'm just as righteous as he is by being in Jesus Christ you can have all your money you can have all your shoes shouting The Flash I'd burn the million dollar check right amen but even by telling you okay we're going to give you a million dollars this morning when everybody here to take a check a million dollars Michelle you need to come back this evening there might be something else how many would come back yep let's say your only condition is you've got to burn that million dollar Journey I'm just talking I'm trying to get a porn cry John Saul the wanted to take the book right was he screaming and hollering no he waited till he got through taking the book then he started hollering right amen that's secondary right I thought we believe the CEOs and the things was his prophet's message it was the Plan of Redemption that's right and even though they were back there and as they were bringing out while ago that the disciples they preached those great wonderful things but yet they never brought this into manifestation or an opening of the scenes and times it was left for the end time to be here with the bride of Jesus Christ and the prophet of God The Plan of Redemption now remember those that are in heaven whether you want to make it literal what you want to do with it I ain't going to argue with nobody I'm done I've already fussed around the world all these years it ain't done no good I'm going on down the road I preach what I believe you want to know what I believe go back and get the tapes of what I believe just don't accuse me of saying things that I don't say right the tapes are there I'm going on down the road one time this message has brought us the Plan of Redemption yep and you don't understand what you're doing it if you don't believe that seventh seal is opened then you're not even into the silence you're not even capable of understanding The Plan of Redemption amen that's right now how many of you been around here for quite a while heard me about 82 and 83. 79 we don't have the taste but we have the 82 and 83s where I preach when I believe those seals were never chose to go back and try to preach them over again during 2005 just a review for people here but I don't believe in arguing about anything I believe in preaching it and then going on down the road up to God the whether it's true or not right but how many of you remember all down through there brother Gary was here he could tell you the tape it was on and the day I preached it these seals revealed The Plan of Redemption and that the disciples understood the Plan of Redemption for Soul and Spirit which it didn't bring adopt bring it to an adoptional form to where that it would be to wit the Redemption of our body that's right to understand the Redemption of the body it would take this end time message to bring forth and review the whole entire Plan of Redemption amen but then the prophet's message would start and he would bring us the message to take to the change of these bodies the seventh seal then doesn't reveal anything about Redemption what your Prophet says six seal book of Redemption how many measures of barley did he give roof amen right how many seals did Jesus preach amen in Matthew 24. he denied to preach the seventh because he was a seven come on you want to argue the point he was a Sabbath he didn't have to preach it like he was just standing there yes amen well I told you over and over when I read the seal book The First Time when I got over to the seventh seal and all I can see that brother Brown was talking about himself and that drove me for a loop and I said Lord I don't understand what the man's are doing all he did talking about himself he supposed to be telling me about you yeah come on dude I better back up but I don't understand I'm back then went to the church age book stayed in it for years studying and then finally came forth and preached it and could see you know what he was doing he was talking about himself I was right all along I just didn't have it lined up in Revelation you know but he was telling us what happened in his own life right right amen now what about in my life in your life amen amen that's right the prophet said it and the first paragraph of the seventh seal he said have we heard the voice of God speaking to our hearts through the opening of these fields he said have we heard the voice of God see Church the Thunders the voice of God we had all we want is some kind of a thunder or some kind of a great Revelation that nobody else know how if you think that's what brother Dale's done on Sean referee all right amen I want to try to preach what God reveals to me look you see the Thunder's the voice of God that's what Jesus said when he said here's the Thunder now I've got these all written down here to bring if you want if you can read my notes okay you know the story a voice from Heaven spoke and said I'm glorified thy name and will glorified again they that stood by John 12 said heard it thunder right he heard a voice yep Elijah one day was pulled back in a cave and he heard lightning wind heard thunder that's right but he wouldn't get up walk out of the cave yep until he heard the still small boy am I right the steel Small Voice the prophet said that's what we need to hear amen he said that's God speaking in authority to you and I right a steel small woman what does it matter whose voice is being used at the time are we listening to The Voice are we listening to the still Small Voice that speaks with inside of us but remember voices are speaking outside of you and always be questioned right Lord spoke to me brother now told me is it contrary to the word that's right if it is then it wasn't God amen I don't care how much loud it got right it thundered about shiny eye I'm scared the people to death but Moses heard the voice of God they may have her son that's right should go back home it'll because you want to be done amen have we heard his voice that's right speaking to us by the revealing of the word are we just still listening for Thunders and Loud things and so and so Elijah or a steel Small Voice right brother random heard a still Small Voice and then tried to tell us what that boy said to him thank God for that right amen but have you heard his voice that's right speaking sister one time year years ago had a dream she said brother Dale said there was a voice in my dreams and it was speaking about the Sixth Seal and bringing it down in the dream and telling what it was she said then I realized it was your voice well you see does that make anything out of you no right if it did the donkey got just as much and a rooster too right are you in the Bible you know a donkey spoke to a prophet one day yeah it don't matter about what speaking is what's revealed that's why I asked the man I said what would cause you to stand in awe going to reveal the Plan of Redemption to me right because you see the prophet didn't say he said they silence in heaven he didn't say they were silence on Earth and if you go ahead and read the rest of whatever was there in chapter five you'll find out in a few minutes they started rejoicing that all of those people are screaming in a holler and they're having a Glory Hallelujah after the lamb not before right right after the lamb took the book Heaven went to Rejoice amen that's right and John said everything on Earth hurt him yeah so it must have been transmitted down right so it must be right that the prophet said it was given to John and John handed it Down Right amen come on you say now I said Angel which one you want an angel give it to John and John give it to an angel how many angels you want why do you want to deal with it just get the point if John hadn't wrote it down it couldn't have been transmitted to Earth right but then once it comes to Earth and just for a split second God reveal somebody you you're standing in Heavenly places sure amen what about it back on these times one of these seals and things mean to you what about the rejoicing it's not been in a Revival ever since I came to this message I hear everybody else talk about Revival in trouble with no you just don't know what you're talking about you ought to say as far as I'm concerned or if I were over with don't say it's over with for everybody right I just got started in one when I heard this message because Revival to me is not shouting Glory Hallelujah and hooplogs that's wonderful that's after effects Revival is when God is revealing his work and I'm saying thank you Lord through this silence in heaven when he looks down right those in heaven are looking down right now come on do you want me to get in the prophet's message with it he said mom was looking over the bannister this morning he wants to do that did they know the Thunders will sound forth the thing pretty soon who's he talking about I know we'll do it with the two witnesses to the and I know who had a rejoicing time bringing it to the Gentiles don't you amen well what about you and I receiving the same message my way of the prophet let the same voice of God is speaking right amen see they took word around and says thousands of Little Voices thundering out which is in the church and they made a Doctrine called a seventh under virtue but see that was before the sea would ever broke yeah of the thousands of live foreign right if God ever speaks to your heart my revelation you'll know that's right see what does it matter about the vessel that's used right amen as long as the ultimate end is reached that's right a good old Baptist brother preached all you do in word indeed do all in the name of Jesus Christ and I said Thank You Lord I'm going to the water everything I'm ready come on let's get in the water there's a good old Baptist Street Station what does it matter about the Dom donkeys and the things you know as God spoke to her heart The Way Forward stand in somewhere Indian Blue Sky News
