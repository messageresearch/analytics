and and uh and bring us uh we as we we always pray before we start the service and we pray for the anointing to come that's we were talking this morning we pray for that anointing because there's an anointing for singing there's an anointing for preaching there's anointing for hearing there's anointing for time for Revelation a time for worship afterwards and we pray that that's what God does he brings a revelation and it brings the anointing in and uh you know I've never led singing before but you know you hear them say well I had these songs you know lined up and and don't sing them you're singing something else come in here with a sermon and say this is it buddy I've done preaching the couch the wall the cat the dog and they enjoyed it they didn't fall asleep praise the Lord and then you come in here and you go where'd that go well you just have to you know let the Lord give you the anointing for that so and the anointing for our age is for us to come to Perfection and get out of here so we must this these things are required we must come to the fullness of the word and not just part of it they've had part of the word all down Through the Ages a part of the word has come but the fullness of the word is here everything we need all the mysteries of God have been finished as he has declared unto who his servants the prophets and he brought that to me and you by Prophet just by way of announcements real quick I'm not gonna we we did it this morning if you're going on Friday then we're going to start at about five o'clock at that Sycamore Shoal State Park so just be there it's kind of very informal there's no there's no service we just come in and fellowship get to know each other a little bit more on Friday that's kind of what we made it I think some of them some of the youths are going to maybe hike a mountain or something but this young guy hiking no mountain ah give me my mountain that's that's Caleb said give me my Mountain well give me my mountain but that's what's going to uh transpire on Friday so it's just um kind of casual Saturday will be casual also somebody asked about this I'm going to cover it Sunday will be a regular church service so you need to wear your Sunday best but Saturday is going to be still informal even with brother Joel Brown being there for the Youth um likes and meals will be provided except for the the meal for breakfast and that at the facilities then on Sunday after the service on Sunday we will go to the farmer's daughter and have um dinner there it's twenty dollars each plus tax plus tips which would be around 30 bucks a piece and uh cash or check only no debit card no plastic I don't know Amish must not believe in it or something maybe we should do the same thing Dave Ramsey said maybe he owns that restaurant check only all right but just remember that uh you can't pay for it with a credit card so cash your check only and then we will eat there right afterwards and then we should be finished by three or four and then another three hour come back home so we should be home way before dark so just come and enjoy the motel is a Comfort Inn and our Comfort Suites in Johnson City uh super nice lady we've changed some of the rooms up a little bit and we sure appreciate them giving us a little bit of a break have y'all tried motel rooms ain't cheap that rental cars goodness gracious we should have gotten a rental car business not just Car Sales rental okay a lot of yours were rented just for a few months then you picked them back up again yeah no so anyway would you remember that we're going to have a good time in the Lord and remember the moraleses will be here Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday uh they'll be here Wednesday and brother Christian will be leading singing for us and we sure do appreciate them and uh they're doing really good uh brother Isaac is doing a good job up there pastoring the people and we keep up with them so we just make sure we keep up with them and and we're going to haul them all down here probably by the end of the year maybe we'll get them all to come down here I don't know I don't know brother I just ready to preach here or not he might fall out and die but um we'll see what we can do we can stand and hold brother up hey man if he falls out we just take over for him it'd be all right let Michael preach for him or something did I say that yeah okay just remember that um brother Bob will be preaching for us Wednesday night too so we'll just keep that in prayer and there will be service here for those of you that don't go there will be serviced here 10 o'clock one service only and uh Josh will be here too so he'll tape it so we a CD it so we can listen to it go back to the old-fashioned way and then we'll have several here and brother Bob is coming back to preach on Sunday morning so just keep that in prayer also one other thing make sure that you that Bethel Camp I I I want us to try to take a couple days off if you can and go up there and work in the kitchen for them uh we are actually one of the closest churches that are affiliated with Bethel and um with brother Jason Watkins in them and we're actually they're four and a half hours and we're an hour and a half so let's go up there and at least support him a day or so I know some of you said you couldn't go during the week but if you could just go help them on Saturday and Sunday morning that would be good brother Aaron you're gonna you you're gonna help with the security this year or you don't know oh that's right we already talked about it never mind we got it okay Aaron's banking his days because he's going to make a special trip at the end of the year somewhere down south not Florida a little bit further down further than that so yeah I got you all right so let's turn to uh John 1 and uh sister Rhema was we were talking between services and she said we ain't been here about three months is the last time they came she said you're still on son of mine she said like part 60 something I said you just hang on you come back again and be part 190 something because we ain't even gotten to the son of man yet we we ain't got we got to get to the Holy Spirit and I hope we get to it a little bit today so let's bow our heads remember these that are not here the ones that that are sick and pray for them dear Lord thank you for this time you've given us thank you for the word that we have Lord and we want more we want more of you Lord Lord I pray that you should open us up Lord open our eyes open our ears that we may see and hear you Lord be with the ones that are sick that are not with us Lord I pray this should touch them Lord in their body Lord I pray this should be with this church as a body too Lord all people that have anything to do with the church father we pray this should just give them strength Lord I know it's a sometimes it's a struggle to drive and do all the things and stay here all day and and spend money on food we we realize that Lord and we we pray that you will bless the people that have made the effort to come Lord and sit and listen Lord to maybe just a moment of what you got to say to them Father forgive us of our sins bless us in the further middle of their service we with us Lord as the Morales come visit Lord this week be with them on the highways be with us Lord as we go and take some fellowship to brother Andre heads Lord we pray this should be with him Brother Richard Wilson also Lord there together we pray that you'd bless us Lord in our fellowship just be with us now and take care of us in Jesus name amen I touched something while I was praying all right in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God what that word you we're going to take it later on but when we talk about Agape you got to talk about the word of God agape love is the word of God that's what he actually that you know God could express itself any other way and he did he went to the Stars he went to the pyramid but he wanted to get it to us in Word now when he got this agape love the love of God into word it became flesh because it had to be equal with us according to Romans 8 it had to become equal with us so that we can even understand this word there's a lot of things in the Bible I don't know about you there's a lot of things in the Bible I don't understand hello there's a lot of things I don't understand in the Bible all right it's going to be made known but there's a lot of things I do understand in the Bible and I understand God said if he give it to us and required it through a prophet brother round and said if God required it he's got to already put it in there for you to make it all right so if there's going to be brother Ramsay the rap stream Faith lays in what books and tapes these books and tapes which is the enhanced word of God for us it's the love letter that God wrote to us the in between the lines is what we're getting now is that love letter from God and it doesn't have anything to do with the Trinity doesn't have anything to do with false Doctrine it's Truth All right so in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us we behold his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of Grace that's what I want I want us to get full we're going to talk about that in a minute about sister Shepard's dream that that pyramid got so full it started running out that's what I wanted to do I want to start running out I I don't I don't want to ooze I won't run I want to just just if Billy George needs something I want to just flow right down to him when you're sitting here today when you're out on your job where you're anywhere you're at doesn't matter if those people flip you off call you whatever you just keep you just keep packing it in you just keep letting it out listen you're going to probably be the only breath of fresh air those people ever see do you think about that next time you choose your words choose your words lightly and you know don't choose your words lightly in other words don't do that because you may be able to what let the water out let it run on them and let them feel something that they had never felt before that's what I want I want I mean they felt enough of my junk and my and my stuff I want him to feel God and his presence as they've always told us this himself when we was down here in 06 but he was relating to the picture because I think his daughter had just painted the picture this one it's right there in the room where he he painted a picture she did Brother Ram he took a picture of brother brown with the over the fire you know they were they were hunting and it's right in there but his daughter did that but brother biscoll relayed the message that brother Branham was going to like stay up a little while so he kind of took the first watch and kept the fire going and then and then um no brother Ed did and brother brother random got over under a bush and laid there went to sleep for a couple hours and then brother Brown you know he woke him up and said brother Brown now you know I'll let me take a nap he said he laid down right where brother Brown was that said said he had never had felt that feeling of a presence of God he didn't want to get up he said I never felt that before and you can see like some like sister clean in different ones I know brother George Canada always told us that that when brother random would look or he would say something to one person they would be sitting standing right beside of them they'd feel that presence sure he said oh that's just for a prophet no I want that to be us I want us to have the presence of God so much to till we don't not love everybody right that's what I want to do okay that's that's our goal let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem others better than themselves you may be seated and if we get to this we'll get to this today because I want to get to because we're going to have to explain and I didn't bring it today but we're going to have to explain that for those of you that are here that that have weren't here at the beginning this part of your journey or this part of your um Christianity starts at Faith and faith is a new birth all right that's when God takes the old nature you had Burns it out by the fire of God not by the fire of anybody else by the fire of God burns your old nature out and puts his nature in that means that you are birthed from above not birthed from Hall County hospital or Northeast Georgia Medical Center they're by with me all right or some of y'all owed you birthed at home but anyway wait praise the Lord that's right just thought I'd throw that in there but that's down here now we see this word Holy Spirit up here all right there are many people in the message now brother Branham and I'll bring the quote later on but I don't want to throw it to you right now I want to read you what Corinthians says but but brother Brown says you've got all this way and you don't have the holy spirit yet now then there's a teaching in the message that teaches that you got to have all these virtues before that's your new birth well that can't happen because this is God God God if you don't have the new birth you're devil devil devil devil devil with me if you're not born again today you have a soul that is demon-possessed yes you do either face or doubt God and the devil one of the two all right so if he burns the old you out burns the old you out puts to puts the Genesis 1 26 man the love of God the agape love what we were reading in Genesis 1 26 when he puts that in there then you begin to believe like God believes then you begin to have virtue like God had virtue knowledge knowledge of God tempers patience godliness broadly kindness but that Holy Spirit is written there for a purpose and it's very important all right that it's placed there brother random place that there listen that's not you can't read that in second Peter all right because let me read it real quick second Peter 1 verse 5. look and besides this and he talks about the divine nature of God all right come on take your hand like this all right you got it put it right here pinch thank you but anyway we're all family here okay we are where's the Perrys at that it takes both of them to take care of that baby bless her heart oh Gene you got the baby you got the where are they at I guess they sold they sang a song they have to go in there and get water and eat something and come on back up here I guess but I appreciate the pairs they have a good testimony we really appreciate them coming and uh and being a part of our part of our assembly for a little while we borrowed them from Brother Jewel so oh there she is now they come in after we after we talked about them so anyway what was I talking about I'm just kidding but no it says besides this in other words you've got to get the divine nature of God for him to impart it out because you can't he's not going to impart this nature of God is not going to be imparted to mirror you if he knows we're not gonna go on or use it or if we're going to use it wrong everybody with me so he gives you the new birth and then Peter says besides this in other words besides the new birth besides you starting on your Christian Journey giving all diligence add Okay add to your faith virtue and all his Temperance patience godley's brother kindness now it continues on says if to brotherly kindness charity so the Bible takes it on up to to hear but the prophet of God knew what he was talking about knowing that the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit Holy Ghost same thing had to be there to finish the product because watch let me just cover this if it's okay this the musicians they'll kill me if I do anything remember this is this is what we've been dealing with since Christ left everybody with me this is what we've been dealing with the headstone of the church has not been here amen we've had the Cornerstone right Chief Cornerstone to build the building and even Paul talking about being a master builder Paul was teaching us Paul and Peter and James and all the different ones teaching us how to live this but this was withheld you know why the Bible says The Headstone was rejected all right so we're going by the Bible not Bible hearsay or what even what brother Brown said the Bible says that the headstone was rejected it was a stumbling Stone a rock of offense amen amen so it wasn't here it was now look still there right but it was hid the book was closed now it's open but the book was closed the seals how to get your body changed was withheld because Peter and James and John they had all this working in their life all right and I say irenius in different ones too if you if you may but this was not there get by with me all right so that's why this is important we'll get to in just a minute but now since the seals broke what came in in a form we could watch in Arizona in 1963 we could see the headstone coming down amen coming down on the church not on just William Brown on all of us I say church I say bride listen denominational World they don't care anything about clouds you've seen 90 well not 90 half the people in the message are are debating it was even Larry come on this is a sign to me that God is here that he came in 1963 through the word not but it came to a prophet had to come to a prophet because that's what the Bible said but it was The Headstone brother Brown said to the church where the church or the bride they're by with me so that's got to fit though this yes the reason it came was somebody came to that but you say well why did Paul not get the headstone Paul wasn't promised to the first church agent was not promised a headstone only in the end time when the son of man that's what I'm telling you this this is not I wasn't going this way but I am now this is the this is the church age bride can everybody see this don't look at my ball head I know you did Aaron did because he's like mine 's about six four you wouldn't see it amen but anyway this is this is a revelation that God give in the Bible that was open to Paul irenius Martin Club this was their message all right everybody with me this is their met this is the Son of God revelation God in a bride all right right Son of God which is the new birth all right then when you get to our age it requires that the son of man according to Luke 17 30 and who was the son of man son of man is God that word I was talking about in human flesh now listen we know it was in human flesh here but it was in human flesh and a part because Wesley didn't have an open book Wesley still preached trinitarian Doctrine God went into ignorance of that and but let Wesley bring his message of sanctification all right amen am I making sense all right so then you come up here to uh to um Malachi 4 5 he's going to turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers 1906 no 80 30. we're not going back to 1906 is Right Here Right 80 30s right here hey bye with me all right he's going to turn us back that message is going to turn us back to where he takes not zeros this guy out but takes their message plus takes their message opens the book and says no we got to get back to here to where Paul these three Church age Messengers right here never preached trinitarian Doctrine remember they only started baptizing in like 300 A.D which was in Mark past Martin heading into Columbia by the Catholic church so those doctrines were not here that's why we had to be turned back to the faith of the fathers now remember brother Brown said though this messenger Malachi forced to do two things one take the people forget about all these lines this is where we are people wise time wise all right and he's going to turn us back by revelation to hear Amen brother Brown said did I preach for paw print he said I preached what Paul did Paul make it he said yeah Paul made it remember he went over across the certain time he said if Paul make it he said yeah Paul made it he said well I preach the same thing Paul prays he didn't say I preached the same thing Wesley free he said I preached the same thing Paul preached and in preaching the same thing that Paul preached he literally that message brought us back to here his message but that's the first part if it brought us back to right here we're just going to die again because we're right here I mean you can you can come back and start this race again you can just keep looping like this something's going to happen to bring this back so number two brother Brown said two to open in other words in my paraphrasing to open the Bible to the Thunders and the seals to literally turn us back in other words why it literally turn us back not to here to Christ when he was standing on the Earth because that's the son of man message Luke 17 30 and the days when the son of man is what being revealed today you're under that anointing of the son of man being revealed all right amen but we've got to go through this journey of virtue knowledge temples places goddess brother kindness that's why brother Ram said it was required it was a requirement that we make it but there's other there's anointings I want you to read this right here let's go to First Corinthians 2 verse 12. maybe this will help now this is I'm heading I'm jumping way up there where it says holy spirit it's up there for a reason okay now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which is not false Doctrine right which things also we speak now here's Paul saying I'm speaking this all right not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual all right now we take and we say they're natural types of spiritual but we've got to understand we've got to come to a place where the natural goes away natural is temporary natural is filial natural will make you sin but the spirit of God will never make you sin now the spirit of man the spirit of the devil absolutely but the spirit of God the Holy Ghost will teach us remember the Bible says and will show us things to come comparing spiritual things with spiritual and that's what brother Brown did he took us and he literally opened he didn't physically open a book he opened our eyes he opened our revelation two back to the face of the fathers then he said he would bring his message which would be the opening of the seals which in 1963 all that that happened as a sign to me that brother Branham not that he was this great something but he was but you know what it brought me it I knew at my point of my journey that was a sign to me that God was back here in his entirety in one human at the time one first fruits gotta have one person here gotta get a start somewhere Jesus wasn't it nobody but Jesus at the time Jesus was here everybody with me can I say that again Jesus was not in no other person when he was here but in himself but now in the dead Pentecost only that Pentecost it was 120 of them little Jesus is running around and that's what he wanted amen but when they started they started down here with the pure word kept preaching the word of God preaching the word of God till you get up to where the Catholic Church takes over and starts interjecting and brother Ryan said takes the Holy Ghost out and puts their own ideas in now that's what happened but God winked at the ignorance of those people and let him preach that because God can't preach false Doctrine and Wesley was a man of God Luther was a man of God right but their Doctrine wasn't all right that's why I read y'all several weeks ago that a church without a Doctrine is like a jellyfish it has no backbone you gotta have a Doctrine our Doctrine is I say our Doctrine is maturity you see some Churches they preach the same thing they preached 30 years ago 40 years ago and guess what you are what you hear you are what you hear if your pastor can't get you past a new birth you ain't going past him praise God ours did amen there was a maturity taught and listen it's like brother um ulti we've known him I mean he came here to church in 70 early 70s when he first came in the message I mean he didn't attend the church here but he would always come here for meetings and stuff and him and brother Dale were were close then because we fellowship with brother Dole which was in Augusta and that kind of put us all together but um he said he said you know he said people um think you and your dad's a little arrogant he said he said he said he said I defended you he said no he said they just know what they're talking about I'm just telling you that's what another preacher said he said no they're not arrogant they know what they believe what they preach and they can back it up and to me like brother like brother Dale always said you know brother um um Perry green you know bragged about being in a hundred and something countries well if the dude went to a hundred and some countries he ain't bragging he went right now if I go to bragging I've been in a hundred and something countries you can call me a liar because I've only been in a few Alabama was one of them but but that's what you see because the Paul Paul you know you know it's okay for Paul to say the boldness of preaching it's okay for Paul to say you'll be judged by my gospel it's okay to say for Paul you know well Paul said for us to be and for the you know Peter said for us to stand up and be bold you know stand up and be bold but when brother Dale gets up and Bowl they're like he's just arrogant well so was Paul I wasn't arrogant he knew what he was talking about listen principle he'll be judged by the gospel that's in this church and you more is required more is given more is required you can't sit here and say we dream milk so if you don't get it it's your fault and mine I'm part of it too but let's get back to this so he brought us back to the foundation and now we are by The Prophet's message we're moving up into this statue of a perfect man but there's something got to happen right there that seals the deal all right well talk to you about in just a minute so it says this though giving all diligence add to your faith first Universal knowledge and all this Temperance add add then we were talking about this morning about the Genesis 1 26 man the agape love the agape love is what come to you at the new birth that's what brought you the faith of Jesus Christ and not this is not the faith of William Branham this is not the faith of Samuel Dell or Wade Dale that's the faith of God but once it's given to you I love what brother Brown said he said this is my eye he said God gave me this eye and now it's mine so in other words God gave me the Holy Ghost in 1998. now it's mine but you know what there's a requirement that comes with that God give it to you what are you going to do about it amen it's in your hands now much is given much is required let us make man our own image so he did so now he's working on that image to build that stature back not statue we're not statues statues don't move stature is what growth development is when you when you got the little marks you know Deanna of course she's a tall girl but we've got her in the in the uh on the whatever we call that thing right there on the side of the door in the bathroom every time you know about every six months we'll soccer up against that thing and we'll mark it you know and put the date on it she's growing in stature right and you can see the growth Spurs they just want several you know the the last year she's only grown about that much but buddy the year before that it was like four inches so you can track all that same thing with God same thing with the gospel if you don't love the Lord more than we started number one to 119. if you hadn't learned something okay you can blame me but I blame you too because you listen to it and I hope it was right but what are we gonna do about it more is given more is required we have been given with hormones we should be bigger and taller than others so God created man his own image so now we have come into that image and then on Masterpiece I love her brother Brian said he said the the the flaw so all the flaws of Moses uh no uh all the different ones all their flaws we look at them and we learn from them right we learn from those there are examples we were talking about this morning but God saw us as a masterpiece family and that's what he's building back listen God didn't tear it down Satan tore it down but God Drew Paul calling himself a master builder He is building this family back up and we do have flaws we're human but as brother Brown says the flaw The Mooring is what makes it a masterpiece how in the world would you have a testimony if you didn't have trials and tasks you could not stand up here and give a testimony if your life was perfect I testified Dave my life's perfect you ain't never heard nobody stand up until that usually if I was this and I was that and I was lost and I was this and right okay then that we were marred moreover Brethren I would not you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud dude we're talking about this this morning all passed through the sea baptized under Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all these same spiritual meat in other words went to the same message Church read the same message books listen to the same message tapes all right and did all eat of the same spiritual me is that not what we're doing today we're eating on spiritual meat all right and did all drink the same spiritual drink for the drink of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples like I said before you took the old you take the Old Testament out and you've took about half your sermons out amen lots of testimonies you take out especially Abraham people preach on Abraham it don't matter if it's a Methodist Baptist Pentecost or whoever they preach on Father Abraham he's the father of the of our faith now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after in other words the things they lusted after Fame Fortune Lord why are you not doing this why are we eating all this uh wafers we want something different so we give them quail and kill them because it was not in the plan was for them to eat manna because that's what he's saying I'm going to give you a man I'm going to give you a double portion on Saturday you or Friday you can't do anything with it on Saturday and well I'll start again on Sunday remember somebody tried together so even sticks on the Sabbath day and God killed him neither be idolaters that's where some of them has written the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play is that what we're doing need to let us commit fornication that some of them committed and fell on one day 23 000 people need to let us tempt Christ if some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents that's when the serpents um poisoned them neither murmur and some of them murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer now these things will happen to them for examples and they are written for our admonition to whom the ends of the world are come and remember that word means pattern or the mark of a stroke or blow a figure formed by a blow or an impression hence a figure an image a form the teaching which embodies the sum and substance of religion and represents it to the Mind manner of writing the content and form of letter in other words sermons all right a pattern of warning of ruinous events because remember David stood one day and said God you've lived in Tavern you've lived in Badger skins all the whole time I won't build you a house remember and then Nathan said do all this in your heart David but God went back to Nathan and said hold on a minute we got a problem David you shed too much blood he killed Uriah he commanded adultery you've done too much David you can't do it but I promise you your son will amen so he gave him a son that built Solomon's Temple right but to ruinous events which serve as admonition or warning to others in a doctrinal sense it's a type a personal thing prefiguring a future person or a thing Jesus was all in the Old Testament they just couldn't see him when he came here in flesh all right brotherly kindness so now we come to brotherly kindness what a brotherly kindness was it was Philadelphia which meant just it's just love it's just love for the brethren all right but our problem is is our love as I've always said our love and feel your love is conditional think about that our filial love is conditional so-and-so's my favorite preacher oh what about the other guy I don't like him that must be on condition because that preacher probably stepped on your stinking toes one day and that's why you don't like him or he said something you didn't like I've heard it God don't let you decide who he loves I've said it many times before there's a lot of you I'm glad you're not God I said you I'm glad we're not God because we're critical we have so much feel your love to where don't you tell me now don't tell me that feel your love is not conditional you say I love my wife unconditionally there's days preach brother yeah I believe it will I don't know I love her around her oh wait a minute y'all all lying if you're not Lily stop that business y'all ain't been married long enough remember that's why June tells me to go hunting do not tell him to stay home but we got to get Outfield if we thank God that God's love is not feeling your love because see then it would be just like this right remember though he can't unlove you if he loved you to begin with thank God for that he cannot I love you if he loved you to begin with you're loved all the way through like brother Brown said thank God he can't see my sins he hears my voice through the blood all right now remember put yourself in the person's place I've said always said before something happened the other day and um it was kind of a similar situation and you just don't know what people are going through you don't know what people kind of day they're having so you just don't want to make their day worse because like I said you're probably the only God or closest to God that they'll ever see they'll see the God of this evil age and somebody will cuss them out or give them the middle finger wave or or run them off the road and they'll shoot you now if you cut people off you know right they don't care anything about life but you're still somebody that's a little bit upset just say God bless you we were somewhere the other day and we says Lord bless you and I mean it's just like they go that's right now you do see some that told one lady told us yesterday said God bless you and I thought I did the same thing but but we do why should I mean we shouldn't be that way like I always said before uh and you know that's this is me if I go through Walmart and I see something laying in the floor I pick it up and put it on the Shelf if I go through the parking lot at the post office I went through the parking lot the other day and I'm going to tell the truth there was something Landing there in the in out in the parking lot I didn't pick it up if I can't identify it I ain't gonna pick it up but most of the time if it's a plate or a napkin or a a cup or something I'll pick it up and throw in the trash and then something that was in the floor the other day in the post office and two people just stepped over it well I picked it up and the Postmaster said I was wondering if somebody's gonna pick that up I said yeah I try to make things a little bit better right my attitude may not be better but I try to leave the world a little bit better place and that's life lesson what was it June 763 all right but you know what it makes me feel better does it not make you feel better to make things better well you know what you say well that's human that is human but if it's God telling you this is the things we need to do on the Earth to keep it better and make it better we know this the god of the evil age we know that but you've got your own little world need keep it clean my brother sinned against me shall I forgive him seven times a day that's pretty good but Jesus said no 70 times 7. brotherly kindness now you see if her brother's All Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him see be kind to him go anyway then there was he's talking about how in the world did Brother Brown do you put up with these people he said hoping someday see patience with him see temperate enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes you ever tried to do that brother Ram always says put yourself in their place yes because putting yourself in the place you understand maybe you understand why they're going through it or you try to understand what they believe and listen if it's contrary to you that's okay that's okay if they try to explain the Trinity to you I don't want you to sit there with a knife I don't believe that listen to what they got to say I'm blessing I'm I'm preaching on myself today me quick on the trigger but watch this John 13 34 this is what we're talking about this morning a new commandment and I put that in big a new one why did he bring a new commandment he really brought a new commandment out of an old commandment he can't change the word of God he did not stand there and say all right you don't have to live the Old Testament I'm here now you don't have to live that no he healed that leper remember he healed the people with the blind eyes what's the first thing he said he said go do the law of Moses because remember if you were cleansed as a leper you had to go to the priest and they had to examine you and if he found no scars or boils or whatever open source then you were not a leper anymore and they didn't have to stick you over in the corner somewhere right Jesus didn't say well bless God I'm God I'm no he said go do the law because he was born what under the law all right so he's giving him a new commandment that you love one another because they had always come to the place he knew one thing for sure those Pharisees didn't love nobody but theirselves they love their self you could tell that because they were always tempting God they were always tempted in the Lord by this shall you know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another in other words an outward display an outward display but let your communication be yeah yeah and Nate Nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that it's been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you that's hard to do love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you it didn't say evil for evil well we always call it in the South get back at them the golden rule in the south is due unto others and run [Laughter] no no do unto others as you would have them do unto you okay dude well I brought back a memory do good I didn't like my parents either oh y'all did I'm listen I'm just so bad I'm just way off here in left field right field left field thank you I ain't like I even told my mom I hated her one time have you ever done that if you hadn't you've done it in your head hello hey what do you mean I can't stay out till 11 15. what's 15 minutes you were just want to be contrary to what your parents said if they said blue you wanted black still am I the only one who's done this oh thank you appreciate that your mom was sitting right back there he's good did everything you told him to do I told him I said listen bro George I told my kids and honestly they sat down one day and said Dan what can we do there was two things they asked that day said what can we do to be able to do whatever we want to do all right because I put these rules out Anna you you got rules uh rules you got rules yeah rules you got them written in your van no they're in here Rose we all got rules we got to do rules they said what can we do dad and then what can we do to be famous I said number one I can tell you how to be famous you'll be on Oprah you'll be on maybe not well Phil Donahue back when y'all knew that who fell down who was I said you know how to get on there I said do everything I tell you to do because since the dawn of time no kid has ever done everything their parents told them to do right Esther don't look at me I've known y'all since we were kids but anyway so they said well what can I do to uh you know if we want to stay out to 12 or 1. just I said you know what I said pay my house payment paid the car payment I had one then don't have one now but pay the car payment I said uh oh uh the electrical bill will be here every month make sure you pay that or they'll turn your power off all right gas bill oh food when I'm hungry you got to go buy me groceries Josh and Hannah Hannah right I said now you can do whatever you want to do if you don't know do those things I said oh by the way I need clothes I've had these shoes Dad I've had them for two months they're out of date we used to wear our Converse tillers feasts toast up through the end of it I said if you can do all that you can be king of this Castle but if you don't I am if you tell them that way explain it to him that way see explain something to your kids and then kids like I said before pray for your parents don't don't despitefully use them and they're not despitefully using you because I'll promise you one thing for sure this is life lesson 763 kids you're gonna grow up and God for forbid we make it long enough you're gonna have kids right right and you'll find out exactly that the love that we had for you sure it may not have come the way you wanted it but does the love of God come exactly the way we want it no it doesn't because we go oh Pete love me he'd give me this no that means the way God works no that's why he always said and it was a it was a young man we were talking yesterday on my mail route and he said you know what he said God's ways are funny I said yeah the Bible says they are he says my ways are not your ways my thoughts are higher than your thoughts in other words you're just zeroed out but thank God when you have the mind of Christ you can understand a little bit of what God's telling us amen that's why the new birth is the most important then you become and go up to be an adult in Christ listen you can be an adult in Christ and be 20 years old rb70 and B2 if anybody's 70 I just hit that number okay you talk about me yeah probably if you were 70. and still acting two absolutely but we want our don't we want our kids to grow up but it's hard it's a hard battle this is yes it's a hard battle to get them to see so so the battle then don't let us you know I pray for Michael I pray for all the young kids but y'all pray for me pray for your parents like I said this morning you pray for them they'll make them because you listen until you get to the age of accountability they're your Holy Ghost so their decision is what you got to bear am I okay brother Daniel do you did you grow up the same way his grandpa was a message preacher he's just from the whole line now her sister Raymond's like me he just picked her up out somewhere out of the world and amen I know we know same way with you but we all come a different way all right yo I've always told you you think about predestination you think about the things that you the choices you make in life I was dating a message girl right brother Hal Thomas's daughter Debbie Janet was here she'd know she was a little nine-year-old girl so we've known each other for a period of time and uh so I had you know I hadn't she would come to church I'd go to church at brother Mike's and she'd come here the only way we could see each other is go to church I kind of like that idea if you want to have a date come to church we'll see how serious you are hey man I'm just off but but here I am and I'm dating this girl that's a message girl all right so I meet this other girl well actually she meets me and she's y'all know she smoke she had short hair cursed a little smoked a little um what no church girl no but now I went contrary to what the message tells you to do and I tell you now like I told Zach and Lily different ones you need to marry a Believer all right don't get me that I'm trying to tell you but this this did happen for the good so I'm dating this message girl and then all of a sudden I bring I'm sorry but I bring that home my mom was watching she said who is that and where did you get her I said mama she got me she did she's wanting to knock me down I wasn't looking for another one but now to make a long story short though and and I say this I say this with all respect Debbie's not a message believer she she just when she got married she just went out you know she didn't go out in the world become wild but she got married had kids and don't care a thing about the message don't even go to a message Church don't even believe it short hair pants all that stuff see the difference I know my mother prayed for me to help get a good girl but she just wasn't she just she just wasn't expecting her that's right we all want the best for our kids right and even out of a mistake I don't mean it was a mistake I'm playing an instrument from now on even out of what they thought was a mistake God Amen put us together God God put us together you know I found miss you know miss queen of the world and she found Mr King of the World We Were King and Queen all right but we fought like kings and queens but we made it [Music] we had our conversation in times past you don't don't get me wrong it wasn't uh uh what do you call it Camelot but now we love God a lot and that's what makes a difference amen and my parents prayed for me but you know my problem was though I didn't pray for them brother George am I getting somewhere over there kids I'm telling you pray and listen even us like me I need to pray for my mom and dad now uh connection apparent that's my living parents that's your blood down here right as long as you got them alive you need to pray for them Michael you need to pray for your mama your mama's done an outstanding I mean I I almost cry when I realized what sister milk was went through to raise you two young men and boy did she do a good job but you know what even all under all out of all that adversity she kept her Christianity because it was true it was the foundation she come to this church not just this church she came and listened she heard she matured and being that she matured she could raise two mature listen a parent that's a kid Can't Raise a kid to be a parent they're about with me I mean if you're 40 well I ain't going there never mind I'll get on video games in a minute if you're 40 years old you got kids and you're sitting around playing video games you're lost I don't mean maybe not lost in the Lord but you're lost get alive love your wife play games with her what an idea but I'm Sandy love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father now we all want to be children of God right that's how to do it that's your formula right there for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth Reign on the just and the unjust for if you love them which love you what reward have you you do not even do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only that's why brother Brown said look he said don't be clannish don't be cliquish I know we all have our little groups but that's okay birds of a feather and I don't mean that bad I mean you know if you're sitting over there talking about um Electronics I might go somewhere else and find somebody talking about hunting you know but that's okay but if you're talking about the word of God you should never walk away from it because the word of God is what is common and what brings us all together amen it does and that's supposed to be that you feel comfortable comfortable around these guys talking about uh computers and bits and bytes and right bro George is like that ain't hitting anywhere but you start talking about a little bit of hunting I'll get a little closer to you but you start talking about the Lord I'm right there with you right that's what we have in common we may not like each other as far as you know that uh things of the of the nature of going out and hunting and different things but when we come to the word of God it should be everybody's Focus turns in makes us common all right sisters too if you salute your brethren only in other words Michael's my favorite I'm just gonna hang around him you'd hate that wouldn't you I was going I was gonna hang around him bro dirty [Music] that's in my bud because you've done something for me see what I mean conditional I'm supposed to love Michael even if he don't if I know he don't like me if you don't like me so dad told me one thing a long time ago and I went this is life lesson 760 nine nine not five five seven sixty five if everybody loves you you're a hypocrite and you think about that if everybody loves you you're a hypocrite I mean I these people grates my cheese just the way it is man I grate theirs like dick said my spirit irritates your demons yeah yours vice versa as a father have to love me we're just family as a father hath loved me so have I loved you continue love listen agape love remember feel your love brother Rama I read the quote a couple Sundays ago all other loves have a beginning and an end filio love has a beginning and an end you'll never love your wife on the other side like you lover now it will turn into total agape love which is Genesis 1 26 never had a beginning it'll never have an end all right perfect love that's what brother Brown calls him so continue ye and my love now you can only continue if the Love's eternal all right so we put our faith in Jesus that he loves us if you keep my Commandments look if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love now that's not just 10. even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full listen I appreciate when people uh you know like brother Brown said that guy said oh I don't like people bragging on me brother Brown said he's a liar I don't mind somebody packing me on the back and saying a good job some of you ain't never done it but that's okay I can look over that this is my commandment that you love you love love them both I loved you um now I wrote myself a note brothers or sisters that denotes you're from the same family I mean you won't now it is okay to go to the convenience store and the guy's selling liquor and beer and all that other stuff and you say God bless you brother but that ain't saying God bless you brother like we're saying to us right we would like listen and that's why I was thinking about the other day I thought if I brought it this way they're gonna they're gonna say something about it but I'm hoping they're wanting to be my brother I'm hoping that my life will convert them that they will be my brother and come in come in family of God we're already in you're already in the family of God you're not struggling trying to get in you're in so you want others to come in a comfortable be around family I mean most of the time you do have them weird cousins but anyway but when I go home today I'll go in my Mom and Daddy's house and I feel just as comfortable I'll take my shoes off but we don't drink on the tap tap floor but we can take our shoes off and put our feet up and enjoy what's in the fridge if Mama tells us to no I mean so it's same thing here that's why I tell ministers I said look don't be nervous this is a family meeting this is brothers and sisters getting together in a family reunion and we want to hear what you got to say about our daddy because now we all got the same Daddy I want you to tell me what your Daddy has done for you and I'm telling you today what my daddy's done for me and I hope it helps you because we got the same Daddy I hope we do Divine love and Sovereign Grace let me get this real quick 1956. now we're facing a day now this is 1956. think about today I was thinking the other day of going down the road and most of the time in the South all of us are from the south pretty much you you know somebody comes by you know car comes by you or at least if you're driving you go you know hey how you doing you know right now you get the other one but nobody hardly now I mean it's just like well there goes Terrance and he never said he never even looked at me but you two menus always you know and you didn't even know if you knew him or not so brother Brown says now we're facing a day with prophesied that Brotherly Love would become a strange thing among people and it's to my humble belief that that is the greatest of all the gifts in the Bible wow I read you this quote the entirety of it so I broke it down a little bit to save time brotherly love will become strange and it's my humble belief remember he he said if God took me on the platform and says I'm going to give you the greatest Ministry the greatest healing campaigns I'm gonna give you the greatest gift but I'm gonna withhold love from you which one would you want brother I'm emphatically said Give Me Love take every gift you've got God but one Give Me Love so what's the greatest gift we should be looking for love love I'm talking about agape love and the only way you can get agape love is to be born again and then get into the word of God all right let's look at this for a minute because this is a selfish world to be selfish is to be concerned excessively or exclusively with one selfie selfishness is one of the biggest obstacles to having the kind of close relationship with God why why because you're looking to self all the time I want to be able to look in the mirror brother George and see Christ not see this guy the kind of close relationship with God and the inspiring relationship with other people that many of us desire you can't be selfish and be friends to people I am crucified with Christ here's where Paul just laid it right out he said nevertheless I live in other words I've got a life yet not I but Christ live within me now I've got the new birth and the life which I now live like I said before and brother um Mike was bringing it out Sunday there was a life before this even though listen even though people can be loving and sweet and nice there's some just people have that nature and they'll be in hell because they never accepted Christ and that love they're just loving people maybe had loving parents maybe had loving grandparents so it just came down through the kids I've seen people that way even like Brother Richard Wilson said he was preaching on Statue of perfect man years and years ago he said there's a man in my in my plant that's just so Meek and mouse if you said look John I'm going to take your paycheck away from you this week and I ain't gonna give you nothing I'm gonna get you a paycheck he said that man will say well if you need it take it not me bless God I worked 40 hours for that paycheck right well your name man I'll amen for you every one of you do it how many of us ever give your paycheck to your that's what I thought and I said paycheck and I didn't say a certain person anybody except your wife boy can I go home with one y'all she's actually got the car keys and she's leaving me here I need somebody to take me home Hannah's stuck in Six Flags without a key so she's got to go down there and they're gonna make her kids so pray for that situation she's gotta drive all the way to Six Flags so anyway she got to leave here in just a few minutes but you know what life happens do it for your kids right I'm Paul says I'm crucified but now the life I now live now look he didn't say he didn't live in the flesh he said the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God not my faith his faith all right who loved me and gave himself for me so he has took that life of himself out that's why you take people like brother they're on different ones that that have just look at his body now and I'm sorry if you think I'm bragging he's my dad and he's one of the greatest man I've ever met in the face of this Earth okay all right I wish I'd be like him more but I don't want to be him okay you understand I want to be my own individual and you need to be your own too all right but you take look how they wore their self out why because of you I say Dad let's go hunting this it's rut time you know if you don't know what that is look it up Google it not now later oh you listen there's a new app on your phone have you seen it everybody's got it it's right on the side it says off use it sometime when you're in church you thought you thought I really had come going didn't you it's on every one of your phones you thought I really had come going didn't you it's on every one of your phones they ain't one it's not on not a one so anyway where'd all that come to hmm oh okay thank you say you use the app that's wonderful thank you I'm trying to find my fault back again so let's continue on the knife the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God so my life's been taken out and his life has been put in so what did I do oh now I know we're talking about so I gave my life up I called Dad I said come on dad it's right time it's time to go hunting three or four days I got time off a cane I got a funeral I got a counsel with somebody I got a wedding and I gotta preach can't do it we grew up playing baseball on different things you know pretty decent at it and and he'd get out just every once in a while play catch with us but he wasn't inside playing video games he wasn't inside watching TV because we didn't have one he was inside with his Bible open and a message book out trying to get something from me and you and he's wore himself out because of it that say is the life I now live see and become so unselfish unselfish a servant is never selfish let's continue on second Timothy 3 for men shall be lovers of their own selves oh boy Covetous boasters proud blasphemer disobedient parents unthankful and Unholy now brother Brown listen 1950. I'll tell you that's what a whole lot the matter with the people today they're not friendly 1950. all right yeah 99 of us wasn't even born when this was preached 1950 I tell you they're not friendly like they used to be the people's got too selfish got to a place where they think they live in a little world all by themselves you know that's the truth now I put this in red because this is a prophet tell them I'm fixing to tell you three quotes this one another one and another one where brother Branham he says I despise that old somebody feels they're bigger than somebody else hmm he was a human 1954 listen to this I recognized the other day a selfish Spirit Come On Me I'm saying this man's wrong I ought to tell him about it he said that's wrong God's the one to tell him about it it's none of my business but my business is to preach the gospel and love everybody and move on and love my enemies as Jesus Christ listen we spend a lot of time what's that old saying I was trying to get it the other day maybe we need to Google that one too where it says that people spend 90 percent of the time worrying about people worrying about them only 10 of the time in other words I'm like what's Michael thinking about me oh Lord he's probably sitting there no he ain't he's working he don't he might he God bless my brother and that's about it you know you know I don't do the same thing if if there's something comes up like sister and I had talked about something and and and she get a little harsh everybody say Amen she and I clash with each other and we have but that's okay it's all right but but two minutes later brother George honestly with my hands up to the Lord It's Gone why do you want to keep how many times have you done that though you've held on held on and held on Gina held on hold on I bet you I bet you oh um sister Anna is sitting over at her house just steaming mad and talking about men and you know you go through the whole thing you know and and then like Aunt sits around the camera to me one time she said I want to apologize for something something and I'm like wouldn't you say that right and I know one thing's for sure once we get something straightened out and straighten out we're done there's no grudges there's no oh well I'm gonna I got enough to worry about sitting worried about what y'all think about me collectively but we do the old saying we spend way too much time worrying about what somebody else is thinking about us when that person ain't worried about you they got their own issues life lesson 6 95 6. 76. you got to keep up with it ought to tell him about it that's wrong God's wanted to tell him about it it's none of my business but my business is to preach the gospel and love everybody and move on move on me in general have a spat think about that just had one a few minutes ago and uh but I'm over it now we'll talk about it later if she's overwritten but I I'm over it now yeah but how many of you have I ain't going no further blessing Lord worry about stuff that you should never even worry about and you should never listen you need to be an altar if you are fabricating a plan to get back at somebody and we've done it wait a minute I'm not going to call any hands I'm gonna raise it for all of you we've all fabricated a plan you remember what brother Dale and different ones that says boy you know I'm me and my wife we say something and I bless God I go to work and I'm like when I get home I'm on absolutely let her have it she fitting to get it because I'm the head of the house and she's gonna get it she's going to just absolutely get it as soon as you open my door she's standing there and your favorite outfit I said yours not hers and she says honey I am so sorry I love you and I got your favorite meal cooked on the stove it just blows your whole day it really makes you mad more mad than what you were because you're worried about all day what she's going to do now is that not us right and this is all got to do with brotherly kindness because we do that to other people if you try to fabricate a way to get back at somebody you need a new birth thank God God doesn't fabricate away listen he made a way for us to get back to him not to drive us away from me who drives us away from God we do we do my stake himself I want to ask the church one more thing before we get some place to study in the scriptures that you'll pray for me oh wow a prophet I've developed a critical spirit oh now brother Branham come on I want y'all to realize something did you see that he talks about having a selfish spirit in the word become flesh 1954 1003 it would be all right if that was just one sermon I mean one thing in a couple of you know so the next thing he says he's going to have a critical spirit watch where he preached this at same message he's continuing down the line getting himself cleaned out I want to ask the church one more thing before we get someplace to study that you'll pray for me I've developed a critical spirit and it haunts at me I told my wife yesterday the first time something happened now we're sitting in the yard and I told her she had reminded me and I told her about it I said honey I've got to a place till I've become critical of people I don't want to be whose job is it it's not mine and God's the one to criticize not me Jubilee a year 1954 this was priests in the evening of 1003 same day different message I'm not going to ask you how many made the concentration but I believe many of you did and myself I did in My Heart Lord take that critical spirit from me he said it the morning and now he's saying in the afternoon same thing now I don't criticize people out to their face that's what I was telling you after the service this morning I don't criticize people out to their face but in my heart I do I see a lady walking down the street especially that see she's not dressed properly I say isn't that awful in my heart I don't say it to nobody else after all that's her business she's a free moral agent she ain't got no right to do it Christ bought her life but maybe she doesn't understand wow so it's not for me to criticize let God do that when I'm in the Pulpit I'll preach the gospel the best way I know how and the rest of it I'll commit to God let's stop right there I can't get to the rest of it musicians come on because we'll get to uh we'll get to the holy ghost in a minute in a little bit but I wanted to read that but I won't read it I'll wait it's almost four o'clock and I forgot to announce that we needed to have communion today so I think we'll let's have it next Sunday I forgot I didn't huh are you leaving me too okay we'll do it maybe the next weekend I forgot about today though somebody remind me of that because we didn't have it last weekend because we had special service let's stand our feet but we don't like to miss communion I think it's important that we have communion so we will have it on the 20 no I'll tell you that'd be too close then we'd have it y'all don't mind having two weekends in a row all right so let's have it on the uh the weekend we get back from up yonder we'll be there the 14th 15th 16th so 16 and 7 is 23rd we'll have it on the 23rd okay they'll be okay with that we'll have it on the 23rd and then we'll be back on the first of the month I I do apologize for that we should have had it today but that was my fault for not mentioning that for it thank you I will thank you that's one out of 80. visitors don't even forgive you anymore God bless you let's say no he's not a minister you're right sometimes y'all listen too well it's just like a kid you know you don't want the kid to hear a thing and that's what they hear and you want you tell us like Johnny Johnny Johnny and they're like I didn't hear what you said let's sing a song to me let's embody to take us and get rid of all this stuff I know we laugh about it and we we play with it but it's serious when it comes to life it's serious when it comes to your kids and your family and different ones I want these things out of my life like brother Brown said Cheer Me Lord I call that out oh the wrong that shot [Music] his love and he covers me that with his hands [Applause] and he covers me there with her time think about that oh wonderful savior is Jesus [Music] away [Applause] [Music] just let him do that today he holdeth [Music] say it to him [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] his love and he cursed me there with his hands what a wonderful father with his eyes it to him [Music] with his fullness [Music] [Music] Joseph said I know my redeemers [Music] driver s [Music] my life [Music] with his hands [Applause] and recovered me that I want y'all to make sure that on Tuesday if all still stays the way it is brother Dale will be having an injection in his back uh if if it continues on it's already been scheduled uh June had one thirsty and it's really helping her back it's kind of a nerve block thing don't understand it all but but dad's having trouble even getting out of the chair um really hurting in his lower back so they're going to try that and you know we believe in medicine we believe in doctors we've never from this Pulpit ever told you bless God don't go to the doctor just have faith you go to the doctor brother random went to the doctor go to the doctor and let the doctor tell you what his book says then go talk to Dr Jesus and let that book that he's got tell you what the Cure is hey man right let let's let him tell us what the Cure is but let's let's pray that Tuesday that if he does take that injection that it'll work and it'll help him because his desire is to go to uh Tennessee with all of us and we're going to pray and bind together that that desire will be met God God said I'll give you the desire of your heart desire of his heart and Mom's heart is to visit the ones that they hadn't seen in years Brother Richard Wilson they really brother Bob

his nerves in his in his legs when he pick his legs up and walk all right he's a soldier you don't stay down long boy now he only gets up all the time you have to kind of chase him around and find him he runs away from his little scooter you know you have to find him and go hand it back to him because he's up and about so you know why because he's always been that he's always been that way his whole life never has been a man to sit around and not do anything he's always been doing something for the church or or the house or us keeping up with us was a full-time job and building all of our houses and all that stuff so but we sure appreciate him and and he stood for God all these years I'm just praying God stand for him God stand for okay we can stand for him but let's pray that God stands for him and condemns that demon because we know it's all the devil it's just the devil Hey listen he'll take me and you out if he could God ever releases his hand off of you he did with job didn't he and the problem was the devil wasn't even looking for job was all fat and happy and sitting there under the umbrella of the Lord and the Lord said hey devil come here a minute have you

don't take his life hey no you go do whatever you need to do don't take his life in other words God's inside of himself going I know what's going to happen devil I didn't I didn't choose John Henry
