[3:48] and
[3:49] brother doherty said they was going to
[3:51] run tests
[3:52] to see about her stomach
[3:54] because they had pretty well ruled out
[3:57] everything
[3:59] else so they were going to try to go
[4:01] into that realm
[4:02] and see if they could find what was
[4:03] causing her to have problems
[4:06] so just pray for it amen

[5:14] hebrews
[5:16] 11.
[5:19] now faith is the substance of things
[5:21] hoped for
[5:23] the evidence of things not seen
[5:25] for by dealers obtained a good report
[5:28] through faith we understand that the
[5:29] worlds were framed by the word of god
[5:32] so that things which were seen were not
[5:34] made of things which do appear
[5:37] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[5:39] excellent sacrifice than cain
[5:42] by which he obtained witness that he was
[5:44] righteous
[5:46] god testifying of his gifts
[5:48] and by it he being dead yet speaketh
[5:52] by faith enoch was translated that he
[5:54] should not see death
[5:56] and was not found because god had
[5:58] translated him for before his
[5:59] translation
[6:00] he had this testimony that he pleased
[6:02] god
[6:04] but without faith it is impossible to
[6:06] please him for he that cometh to god
[6:09] must believe that he is
[6:11] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[6:13] diligently
[6:15] seek him now just one scripture
[6:17] nehemiah if you'll look at it
[6:20] and study it you'll find out this is
[6:22] uh following watergate you remember
[6:26] now that it falls in verse 1 there that
[6:28] they stood before the watergate and read
[6:30] the scriptures
[6:31] and god how it come in the end time you
[6:33] know that this prophet's message come
[6:35] before
[6:36] the big watergate times
[6:38] but
[6:39] you know just getting down to verse
[6:41] eight
[6:42] look what it said
[6:44] so they read in the book
[6:47] in the law of god distinctly
[6:50] and gave the sense
[6:52] and caused them to understand
[6:56] the reading hallelujah you may be seated
[6:58] lord had his blessing
[6:59] now
[7:00] we'll get to that in a minute
[7:03] just to make a point
[7:06] of what we're talking about but i want
[7:08] you to think on something and i'll try
[7:09] to get it up front
[7:11] um
[7:12] a point
[7:13] but it says there that he would uh
[7:18] give the sins
[7:21] well
[7:22] we think of and that's the only time in
[7:24] the bible the word sense is used
[7:27] you know we think it's you somewhere
[7:29] talking about five senses or whatever no
[7:32] it's not
[7:34] and i firmly believe now in five senses
[7:37] all right we'll get to that in a few
[7:38] minutes
[7:39] but where did we get that word from
[7:44] and what does it mean
[7:47] you know
[7:48] well it just means a sense of you're in
[7:50] a sense of feeling a sense of that
[7:53] you know
[7:54] but we don't ever think
[7:56] about uh
[7:59] why things are like it is
[8:02] now
[8:03] what i want you to think about a minute
[8:05] and i don't have any
[8:06] form or layout to bring it from
[8:09] but i want to get a point across to you
[8:12] about something
[8:13] that i've been dealing with
[8:15] and looking at and just keep on going
[8:18] and straight toward it and watch it
[8:21] unfold
[8:22] until you know we can move on further
[8:25] all right
[8:27] but when we talk about the word faith
[8:31] what does the word faith mean to you
[8:35] what do you think about when you hear
[8:37] the word
[8:38] faith you know
[8:42] we can go through a lot of
[8:44] things talking and
[8:47] and saying the prophet said it's this
[8:50] he said faith is a revelation
[8:54] all right
[8:55] now
[8:57] uh
[8:59] where did he get that
[9:01] from
[9:10] where did he get that
[9:14] faith is a revelation
[9:21] well
[9:24] remember now
[9:25] we quote brother branham
[9:29] and we quote him so much
[9:32] until we begin to think the bible
[9:35] says that
[9:37] when it actually doesn't say that
[9:41] you know
[9:42] and we uh we say well the bible says
[9:47] faith is revelation well
[9:49] there's no scripture
[9:51] come on there's no scripture it says
[9:53] faith is a revelation
[9:55] all right
[9:56] see that is an understanding amen from
[9:59] what the word faith means
[10:04] right
[10:06] a revelation is to
[10:08] uncover something
[10:12] something that's hidden
[10:14] right
[10:14] it's make known right
[10:17] all right
[10:19] and and bringing out those things
[10:22] but why would the prophet say
[10:24] faith is a revelation
[10:26] i was laying there in the bed the other
[10:27] night thinking about it and i thought
[10:29] lord
[10:34] we take a lot of things for granted
[10:37] in our lives
[10:40] and we
[10:41] think we know
[10:44] what we're talking about in a lot of
[10:46] respects
[10:47] and uh you know
[10:53] but is it
[10:54] let me ask you the question is it a
[10:56] revelation
[11:02] because we can have a great
[11:05] uh
[11:08] ability
[11:10] to understand
[11:13] to explain
[11:16] uh and things
[11:19] but is it a revelation
[11:23] and what is a revelation
[11:29] a revelation is like uncovering
[11:31] something
[11:33] we'll give it a minute
[11:35] it's like something that's been
[11:37] hidden
[11:38] but then it's made known
[11:41] and we call it revealed
[11:44] but then why would the prophet say
[11:47] faith
[11:48] is a revelation
[11:52] did he get it from the uh
[11:56] definition of the word
[12:00] you know
[12:03] did he get that understanding where did
[12:05] he get it from
[12:07] and well he was a prophet we'll praise
[12:08] the lord it's got to be in the word
[12:10] though
[12:11] because he's the word prophet
[12:13] all right and we believe it's dire but
[12:15] i'm i'm trying to
[12:17] lay something down
[12:19] to make you think sister gail make you
[12:22] think
[12:23] all right
[12:24] something to go home
[12:27] and consider
[12:29] have you ever looked up the definition
[12:30] of the word faith
[12:36] you
[12:36] know have you ever looked it up
[12:40] to
[12:43] understand what it is
[12:46] you know
[12:48] it's only used two times in the old
[12:49] testament
[12:52] i showed you that you know in
[12:54] deuteronomy
[12:55] 32 and 20 if they can pull these up
[12:59] he's talking about
[13:01] i'll hide my face from them and see what
[13:02] their ends shall
[13:04] be
[13:05] for they are very forward generation
[13:08] children in whom is no faith
[13:12] see the word faith remember we went
[13:14] through
[13:15] explaining it it's not an old testament
[13:17] word
[13:20] it is a new testament word
[13:23] meaning that it has
[13:25] greater meaning over here
[13:27] than dire and
[13:31] they were not born again back there so
[13:34] it limited their point
[13:38] so you would use like
[13:40] you know
[13:43] i know
[13:45] i
[13:46] believe know
[13:49] it's been made known to me
[13:53] those words were used
[13:56] to express
[13:58] what they were
[14:00] and in doing that
[14:04] it didn't give the true meaning
[14:07] so then
[14:09] look at
[14:10] that was one a brothers this is one b i
[14:12] put these in later because of what came
[14:15] to me
[14:17] that word where it's talking about who
[14:19] children in whom is no faith
[14:22] is number 529
[14:26] which is faithfulness
[14:29] trusting
[14:30] faithful
[14:33] or trustee
[14:35] all right
[14:37] in whom is no faith
[14:42] it
[14:43] doesn't have a good enough connection to
[14:47] hebrews 11 1.
[14:50] you remember i tried to go through this
[14:53] now here's the reason so
[14:56] the next time it's used in habakkuk 2
[14:58] and 4.
[15:01] behold his soul is lifted up
[15:06] excuse me behold
[15:08] his soul which is lifted up
[15:10] is not upright in him
[15:12] but the choice shall live by
[15:15] his faith
[15:17] remember
[15:18] we get in the new testament it doesn't
[15:20] say that you shall live by his faith
[15:23] instead of just shall live by faith
[15:25] all right
[15:26] and here it has more of a reference to
[15:29] the individual
[15:32] because look at the
[15:34] 530 which is the number used for it
[15:38] and it says firmness
[15:40] fidelity which means that your
[15:43] your uh loyalty sometimes
[15:45] uh
[15:46] steadfastness
[15:48] or steadiness
[15:51] see it's more or less dealing with you
[15:53] in the things you remember how we went
[15:54] through that
[15:58] but
[15:59] before we go to the
[16:02] hebrews 11 1
[16:05] i want it to dwell in your mind
[16:09] and i want you to think
[16:12] what is faith
[16:20] why would the bible say
[16:23] now some of you already got sleepy i
[16:24] said i was going to do this before you
[16:26] got sleepy
[16:27] and three of you is already nodding your
[16:29] head
[16:30] so all right come on
[16:36] why would paul say
[16:39] when the definition of coming forth
[16:42] here seems to deal with faithfulness
[16:45] trusting
[16:46] trusting it be firmness
[16:50] fidelity steadiness
[16:53] why would paul say
[16:56] faith is the substance
[16:59] of things so far
[17:03] when the word faith
[17:05] according to
[17:08] webster and according to
[17:10] the strongest concordance
[17:14] doesn't relate to that
[17:19] that's why i asked to wonder if you've
[17:21] ever looked it up
[17:24] to see what the natural wording
[17:27] is
[17:31] i believe it'll be something shocking in
[17:33] a second that'll really open your eyes
[17:36] to something that i've been dealing with
[17:38] for many years
[17:39] for you to see
[17:43] all right go ahead and pull up
[17:45] we don't have to go with hebrews 1 we
[17:47] know i mean 11 1 we know what that is
[17:49] faith is a substance we'll pull up the
[17:51] definition brother
[17:56] which is one e
[18:00] this comes from number 4102
[18:04] all right now this is taken from
[18:08] the word faith in the new testament
[18:12] and the basis i looked up there may be a
[18:14] little differential in a certain wording
[18:17] but if you notice a little differential
[18:20] in
[18:20] the old testament between the two words
[18:23] faith that was used because a writer or
[18:26] a or the person who does these things
[18:30] like a concordance
[18:31] is not supposed to be translating by
[18:34] revelation but giving you verbatim word
[18:37] for word what it says
[18:39] and what that word
[18:40] means and the strongest concordance is
[18:43] more or less giving you the meaning of
[18:44] that word at that time
[18:48] we look at the word faith
[18:53] the word faith is faith
[18:55] assurance
[18:57] belief
[19:00] belief belief
[19:03] them that believe
[19:05] fidelity like i said means loyalty
[19:08] or uh
[19:09] appearance
[19:11] to fact
[19:13] and things means accuracy
[19:16] but look roll it on up a little now
[19:19] faith is
[19:20] conviction of the truth of anything
[19:23] belief
[19:25] in the new testament of a conviction or
[19:27] belief
[19:29] respecting
[19:31] man's relationship
[19:34] to god and divine things
[19:36] generally with the idea or included idea
[19:40] of trust and holy fervor
[19:42] born of faith and joined with it
[19:45] relating to god
[19:46] the word faith
[19:48] is the conviction that god exists
[19:51] and is the creator
[19:53] and ruler of all things
[19:55] the provider and restorer of eternal
[19:58] salvation through christ
[20:01] relating to christ the word faith
[20:04] is a strong and welcome conviction
[20:06] or belief that jesus is the messiah
[20:10] whom we obtain eternal salvation
[20:13] in the kingdom of god
[20:14] it's all if you notice what i'm talking
[20:16] about
[20:17] it's all relating back to a belief
[20:23] that's the point i want you to get
[20:26] believing belief
[20:31] the religious beliefs of christians
[20:34] belief with the predominant idea of
[20:36] trust or confidence
[20:38] whether in god or in christ
[20:40] springing from faith in the same
[20:42] fidelity faithfulness the character one
[20:45] who can be relied on
[20:48] now
[20:52] there's no indication there
[20:57] from the word faith
[20:59] of it connecting to hebrews 11 1.
[21:10] now hang on
[21:11] what i said get you where you walk
[21:15] webster says faith
[21:18] is confidence
[21:21] or trust in a person or thing
[21:26] it's belief in god
[21:28] or in the doctrine or teaching of
[21:30] religion
[21:33] belief in anything
[21:35] it's doctrines or tenets or
[21:37] are creeds or dogma
[21:40] you know because
[21:41] this is the baptist faith this is the
[21:44] catholic faith
[21:46] this is the so-and-so faith
[21:48] all right
[21:51] webster gives a good idea on it
[21:54] he said faith is a belief
[21:58] that it's not based on truth
[22:04] can you swallow that one
[22:07] well it is it's based on the mind but
[22:09] see
[22:10] what he's saying people don't believe
[22:12] the bible
[22:15] so
[22:16] a faith is based upon man's ideas
[22:21] and that's why you got this faith that
[22:23] faith this faith that faith
[22:27] and you've got all of that relating
[22:30] to faith
[22:32] but you still have no
[22:35] connection
[22:39] to answer me
[22:43] what is faith
[22:49] is it just a belief
[22:53] is it a doctrine
[22:55] is it a creed
[22:58] is it an assumption
[23:01] you remember we've been through a lot of
[23:02] this it's not an imagination it's not
[23:05] okay
[23:12] is it
[23:13] a revelation
[23:20] all right now we're getting to something
[23:23] that ties it together
[23:26] that it is a revelation
[23:29] but why would it be said it's a
[23:30] revelation
[23:35] i just read you a few and you always
[23:37] read on down we will
[23:39] by faith abel offered unto god and more
[23:41] excellent sacrifice but it doesn't say
[23:43] in genesis that it was revealed to abel
[23:50] read your bible
[23:56] we know it was
[24:00] but it's not written in the scripture
[24:04] here comes the prophet that telling you
[24:07] the bible definition
[24:10] of faith
[24:12] would relate to
[24:15] revelation
[24:19] all right
[24:22] now to get the point to you what i'm
[24:24] talking about and then we'll get off of
[24:25] that get on something else i want
[24:27] you to think
[24:32] if the word faith
[24:35] is not an old testament wording
[24:40] but it's a new testament form
[24:45] then
[24:48] we've got to go to that to find it
[24:52] and we can't find a scripture that says
[24:54] faith is a revelation
[24:59] i mean i invite you to go home and
[25:01] run what you want to
[25:04] see we're taking what brother branham
[25:06] says
[25:10] and we're using that
[25:13] to say what we're saying
[25:16] but do we have any anchor
[25:19] into the word
[25:21] to be able to comprehend thank you thank
[25:23] you
[25:29] so we asked god
[25:33] that's what i
[25:34] learned our thank you neither not us
[25:36] lord
[25:37] that's right the word faith is so
[25:39] important
[25:43] it's so great
[25:47] but we cannot take the natural
[25:49] understanding
[25:52] of what
[25:54] even the
[25:55] authors of
[25:57] strong's concordances etc
[26:00] even webster
[26:02] doesn't bring it to a point
[26:04] where we can comprehend what faith
[26:06] really is
[26:14] so he had a man to write
[26:18] what faith was
[26:22] god
[26:23] had a man to write
[26:26] what faith was
[26:29] the word faith is so great in the new
[26:31] testament
[26:33] until he would come on the scene
[26:37] to give his own definition
[26:46] would you go with me on that
[26:50] that if it's a word that we don't
[26:52] we can't use the background things to
[26:55] do definitions of it
[26:58] to come out to
[27:00] a total correct understanding
[27:05] and it must be revealed to us
[27:10] it must be a revelation
[27:15] for your prophet's right when he said
[27:17] faith is a revelation
[27:26] but now
[27:28] how would he place that back into
[27:30] scriptures
[27:33] for it to line up
[27:36] we've read it
[27:38] we've read it we've read it how many
[27:40] times have you ever read hebrews
[27:46] 11. you realize in hebrews 11
[27:50] god is defining
[27:53] what the word faith is
[28:01] let that sink come slow try it i want it
[28:03] to be slow
[28:05] it's up to god to define that
[28:10] and make sure we would get the correct
[28:13] understanding
[28:15] of the word faith that's right
[28:21] and then it's so simple
[28:27] the god came to the apostle paul
[28:32] and he was writing about the just shall
[28:33] live by faith
[28:35] remember the message
[28:37] that's hebrews 10 38
[28:41] he drops down a few verses to 11 1
[28:44] and he
[28:45] finalizes his statement before he starts
[28:48] his
[28:50] uh
[28:51] point of bringing it
[28:53] of it being a revelation
[28:56] he gave you the exact definition
[28:59] of the word faith
[29:04] faith is
[29:06] the
[29:07] substance right
[29:14] is that clicking
[29:16] right
[29:17] god himself is defining
[29:20] he doesn't need a strong's concordance
[29:24] remember brother branham would say i
[29:26] looked and i looked and i looked
[29:30] he said i couldn't find
[29:34] that said
[29:35] finally i come up with a word
[29:40] he couldn't find a definition or an
[29:42] answer
[29:43] for what he was looking for in the
[29:45] wording
[29:46] and even in the definitions of the
[29:49] wording
[29:52] then the holy spirit would drop down
[29:54] and pick out something and say
[29:58] there it is
[30:00] the word form
[30:03] means in morphy
[30:07] and he'd say there it is
[30:13] but he had a revelation
[30:19] so if i ask you again
[30:21] and i say what is faith
[30:24] what is the biblical bible
[30:29] answer
[30:30] for the word faith
[30:35] you don't have to quote brother branham
[30:36] as it's a revelation
[30:38] although that's wonderful that's right
[30:42] but then you try to quote what the
[30:43] definition of the word is
[30:46] and your mind is going to lead you away
[30:49] from
[30:51] the truth
[30:58] what is faith
[31:04] paul said
[31:06] it is
[31:08] the substance
[31:12] you say it was a revelation
[31:14] he had the revelation of what it was
[31:18] right
[31:21] he had the revelation of what faith was
[31:26] he said faith
[31:28] is
[31:30] the
[31:30] substance
[31:32] the things hoped for
[31:36] it's the evidence of things
[31:39] not seen
[31:41] by it we know the worlds were framed
[31:45] by
[31:46] the word of god
[31:54] did that strike home to you
[32:01] okay
[32:02] i'll wait on you
[32:06] i don't mind holding it and keep on
[32:08] preaching
[32:10] i'll wait on it for it to drop into your
[32:12] heart
[32:14] what don't you say it
[32:17] but you'll see that's what i've been
[32:18] saying the whole time
[32:24] what is faith faith of revelation
[32:26] we got the quotes from the prophet it's
[32:27] the revelation
[32:29] amen what's the revelation
[32:36] a revelation is the uncovering
[32:40] or making known
[32:42] of god
[32:44] to man
[32:47] well the prophet's right when he says
[32:49] faith is revelation
[32:54] but we know by revelation
[33:00] that abel offered unto god a more
[33:02] excellent sacrifice than cain
[33:08] we know by revelation that enoch walked
[33:10] off the earth
[33:13] or better known to us
[33:15] is it that it says through faith
[33:19] we understand
[33:21] you see why it's a new testament word
[33:26] do you get it
[33:28] faith then is a new testament word
[33:35] because
[33:37] the importance of the word would come
[33:39] into being
[33:41] here
[33:45] faith
[33:46] is
[33:48] the substance
[33:51] that's the definition of the word faith
[33:53] god gave it himself
[33:58] he doesn't have to depend upon him yet
[34:00] he uses man to write books and and to do
[34:02] things in concordances and in
[34:04] dictionaries and things to help us and
[34:07] we thank god for it
[34:09] but just remember
[34:14] to read is not a revelation
[34:20] remember we brought that out a few weeks
[34:22] ago and the prophet said it that way
[34:25] to read is not a revelation
[34:30] it's when something's revealed to you
[34:37] and something's made known to you and to
[34:40] you only
[34:49] but brother dale i got a revelation
[34:51] brother someone got a revelation
[34:53] that's all right i'm not talking about
[34:55] that
[34:56] but i'm talking about one thing a
[34:58] revelation is personal to you
[35:04] it's not a collective
[35:08] it's personal to you and you only
[35:11] you and you only have it
[35:17] but the other person says
[35:20] i'm the only one's got this
[35:26] is that any problem
[35:30] there any problem for the apostle paul
[35:32] to stand before the brother and then say
[35:35] brother and i'd like for you to realize
[35:38] that none of you
[35:39] have added one thing
[35:42] to what god showed me
[35:45] remember that in the book of acts i'm
[35:46] paraphrasing it just to her but it's
[35:48] close enough
[35:52] the boy you think
[35:54] here comes a god and all he's ever done
[35:56] is kill people and and done all kind of
[35:59] dirty things wrong
[36:00] and he goes out in the wilderness won't
[36:02] even stay with the rest of them and let
[36:04] them teach him
[36:07] right
[36:09] and he goes all by himself
[36:11] and he comes stomping back out
[36:16] he ain't listening to the hierarchy
[36:23] right
[36:24] he didn't get it he said from man
[36:28] that would have been definitions and
[36:30] things and wordings and
[36:32] etc
[36:34] and he didn't care who it was that he
[36:36] was talking to
[36:41] he said you didn't add one thing
[36:44] and what the lord revealed to me
[36:47] now did he mean that
[36:49] peter and them didn't have no revelation
[36:51] or did he mean that they didn't have
[36:53] even maybe
[36:54] greater revelation than him
[36:57] no
[36:59] he just said i didn't get it from you
[37:02] i got it from god
[37:06] well you know peter was supposed to say
[37:08] it that way
[37:10] right
[37:12] peter's supposed to say i didn't get it
[37:14] from nobody else i got it from god alone
[37:16] because that's where it come from
[37:21] i thought we believed in personal
[37:23] revelation i thought we believed in
[37:26] a god that was revealing himself to us
[37:32] but my point is we try to get things
[37:34] upon wording and i'm the world's worst
[37:37] to do it
[37:38] so i'm not throwing off on it right i
[37:40] give the definitions of words i give the
[37:43] strong concordance i give the webster
[37:45] definition we do that because what else
[37:49] can we do
[37:52] are you going to come up with some kind
[37:54] of a hocus pocus jiminy okay's word that
[37:57] don't exist in the human language
[38:00] no
[38:05] we do the best we can do
[38:08] but the best we can do a lot of time
[38:10] don't bring a revelation
[38:14] the bible always said there was just one
[38:16] god
[38:16] right where did we get the concept of a
[38:19] trinity
[38:22] and called it a revelation
[38:28] you remember the other week i titled one
[38:30] message i didn't
[38:32] tell you the title but the title to one
[38:34] of the message was
[38:36] is how sure
[38:38] of the accuracy
[38:41] of god's word
[38:46] how sure it is
[38:51] why because
[38:53] faith
[38:54] revelation
[38:59] is a substance
[39:01] if you've got a revelation of one god
[39:08] come on
[39:10] you've got the substance of god
[39:14] now you want swallow for that one
[39:17] that shaky spirit's getting there again
[39:19] swallow it down
[39:22] if you've got a revelation
[39:24] you've got the substance that god exists
[39:26] from
[39:31] you agree with me
[39:34] so then what is the bible definition
[39:38] considering all of the wordings
[39:41] in the things
[39:42] of the word faith
[39:46] very simple
[39:48] and what's more simple everybody says
[39:50] brother dale is so deep
[39:52] i'm sure a lot of you were thinking well
[39:54] i was saying that
[39:55] man he's confused me so much i don't
[39:58] know what's going on he's so deep
[40:03] how much more simple can you get
[40:06] than to say
[40:08] god told paul the definition of faith
[40:13] he didn't look it up in webster's
[40:15] dictionary
[40:17] he never had a strong concordance to get
[40:19] it from
[40:21] god told him
[40:26] what faith was
[40:29] faith is
[40:31] the substance
[40:34] of things hoped for
[40:40] just run that through your mind and just
[40:41] keep thinking on it
[40:43] and keep saying that well he did read to
[40:45] me worthy it looked like the word faith
[40:47] has got other relationships and to the
[40:50] point
[40:51] in a very little relationship to
[40:54] the real understanding of hebrews 11 1.
[40:59] i think at least you'd admit that when
[41:00] you
[41:05] you see in that respect then
[41:09] do we have a
[41:11] substance revelation
[41:15] or do we have our own concept
[41:19] and call it a revelation
[41:24] hey
[41:26] if you're afraid of what you believe and
[41:28] won't tell what you believe all of what
[41:30] you believe because you're afraid
[41:32] somebody will differ with you or
[41:34] whatever then you don't have it
[41:38] i've been in the same preacher i've got
[41:40] a great revelation right here i'm going
[41:42] to read to you after a while
[41:46] and they never read it i want to get
[41:48] them go read the notes
[41:52] i'm honest
[41:56] see
[41:57] do they have anything or do they try to
[41:58] make you think they got something
[42:02] man got the goods ain't worried about
[42:03] them being put to the test
[42:06] right
[42:11] older brother the other day i said
[42:14] we've got all the tapes here from 83 82
[42:17] somewhere in there up
[42:19] and they're on the internet
[42:21] and i'm sure that
[42:23] richard's got most of them on there by
[42:24] now
[42:25] they have all of them but i know it's
[42:26] from 83 or 83
[42:29] he said that's a lot of information
[42:32] right i said yep sure
[42:35] you know that way you can check me
[42:38] to see whether i've changed my doctrine
[42:40] or not
[42:42] you know but that way i can tell you i
[42:44] haven't
[42:46] because i can prove to you by the type
[42:55] that's why i'm not afraid of what i
[42:56] believe i want the world to know what i
[42:59] believe come on amen
[43:04] why because
[43:06] if it's a revelation
[43:08] what have i got to worry about that's
[43:09] right
[43:11] it's a man-made doctor and i've got a
[43:13] lot to worry about that's right
[43:16] but what about it
[43:18] a bible definition
[43:21] of the word faith
[43:23] is a very simple statement
[43:26] telling you what it is
[43:29] it's not an idea or a thought or a
[43:31] concept
[43:34] or a doctrine
[43:36] a recreate or a tenet or whatever that
[43:38] word is for you know
[43:43] it's the substance that's right right
[43:47] amen
[43:48] faith is the
[43:50] substance
[43:52] he said well what is faith it is the
[43:54] substance that's right
[43:57] right
[44:00] whatever i'm asking for
[44:05] the world was brought by faith
[44:11] enoch walked off the earth by faith
[44:21] what about it
[44:24] we'll get down to a little bit more
[44:25] sunday
[44:26] and you'll see more what i'm talking
[44:28] about
[44:29] but i hope you follow my point
[44:32] we quote brother branham
[44:35] and we say able by faith by revelation
[44:39] no other way
[44:42] but there was no bible back there
[44:43] written
[44:44] right that's what he says
[44:48] see it was revealed to abel
[44:52] right
[44:53] abel had a substance
[44:59] his substance was
[45:01] the thought that came from god
[45:04] into his heart thank you jesus
[45:07] and even in a lost condition as we'd
[45:09] call it
[45:12] he would still work
[45:16] and bring him to a place
[45:19] that
[45:20] he had a substance
[45:25] right
[45:27] you remember a man named peter that one
[45:30] day
[45:31] a man told him he said in fact be thee
[45:33] bid me come if if that's you lord put
[45:36] under your feet what's under my feet and
[45:38] i'll just walk out there he said just
[45:39] come on
[45:42] you have a substance
[45:47] but because he was not a born-again
[45:48] believer
[45:51] he began to sink
[45:53] because he began to doubt
[45:56] all right
[45:58] and as he did then
[46:01] he lost his substance
[46:04] right
[46:05] but he still had his confession right
[46:07] you know what his confession brought a
[46:09] hand out to him
[46:11] and put a substance back under him and
[46:13] he walked on the end of the boat
[46:18] right
[46:21] so what is a bible definition now
[46:27] the great man the apostle paul
[46:30] was defining that a joy shall live by
[46:32] faith
[46:33] and he said now listen before i get into
[46:35] these
[46:36] that have done these things by faith
[46:39] let me define the word faith
[46:43] it is the substance
[46:46] of things hoped for
[46:49] the evidence
[46:51] of things not seen
[46:55] my point
[46:57] just don't think because we have the
[47:00] definitions of something
[47:03] that that is what is being revealed
[47:10] it can be confusing
[47:12] great thing to have and a wonderful
[47:14] being but because confusing
[47:17] now let me go into
[47:20] the next part
[47:24] where do we get the idea that we have
[47:26] five senses
[47:37] what does the word sense mean
[47:39] s-e-n-s-e sins
[47:41] okay
[47:44] webster says
[47:46] the word sense
[47:48] is a realization
[47:53] inspiration
[47:56] a sense of awareness
[48:00] or recognition of something
[48:02] there's your best one
[48:06] it's a feeling or a perception
[48:09] you can actually webster says the word
[48:11] sense can actually go to discernment
[48:17] the only time the word sense is used
[48:20] in the bible
[48:22] is there in nehemiah
[48:24] 8 and 8
[48:27] right
[48:29] where it says
[48:31] as they read in the book in the law of
[48:34] god distinctly
[48:36] and gave the sense
[48:41] and caused them to understand the
[48:43] reading
[48:50] we say
[48:50] what do you mean we got five senses see
[48:53] taste field smell in here
[49:02] webster doesn't even agree with that
[49:06] because he gave you the definition of
[49:07] sense
[49:09] it's a realization or impression it's
[49:11] for inspiration
[49:18] i believe
[49:19] we're going to get to this and i don't
[49:20] want tonight so we may have trouble
[49:22] sunday sunday evening may be a long
[49:23] service i'll warn you i'm honestly
[49:25] serious but i want to play three
[49:27] quarters of a tape
[49:28] all right when we say sins
[49:32] i feel him
[49:35] i see him
[49:38] he went
[49:39] i hear him he laughed
[49:43] now
[49:50] give me webster on it
[49:55] he'll say okay we'll look up five senses
[49:57] in webster
[49:58] and you'll get see tasteful smelling
[50:00] gear
[50:01] save you trouble okay
[50:04] my point is
[50:06] just like the point was that i
[50:08] previously covered
[50:11] that we try to use words to express
[50:14] ourselves
[50:16] when sometimes words will not express
[50:20] the correct meaning
[50:30] are you with me yeah
[50:32] maybe you'll catch on one of these days
[50:33] what i've been doing
[50:36] for quite a while
[50:40] the strong's concordance says sense is
[50:44] go ahead and pull that up brothers it's
[50:46] number one that's where i supposed to
[50:48] start right here number one i was
[50:50] supposed to start it right here
[50:52] number 72 20 79 22
[50:55] the word sense
[50:56] is prudence
[50:59] insight
[51:00] understanding
[51:02] prudence
[51:05] good sense
[51:07] insight
[51:09] understanding
[51:11] cunning
[51:13] or cutting craft by bad sense
[51:19] but where is it see tasteful smelling
[51:22] here there you know
[51:27] you know this is a very funny service
[51:28] tonight so
[51:30] you know i want you to think
[51:33] you think you got it all figured out
[51:38] just because we can read
[51:40] and we said the prophet said it
[51:46] but what is your revelation that's right
[51:48] can you explain to me what you're
[51:51] talking about without quoting brother
[51:54] branham
[51:55] or
[51:58] the letters of the bible
[52:04] but remember now the way we believe it
[52:06] that what we explain
[52:08] had better connect to what the prophet
[52:12] said
[52:13] and better connect to what the bible
[52:15] says and not be something different
[52:18] right
[52:20] but when you do you're going to be
[52:22] saying i say
[52:27] you're going to get in trouble
[52:30] i think this is what it means
[52:39] what about it
[52:43] listen to what your prophet had to say
[52:46] about census
[52:48] whoever number two
[52:52] i'd like to speak
[52:53] i would like to speak just a short time
[52:56] upon the subject of senses
[52:58] we're taught that the natural man has
[53:00] five senses
[53:05] and those five senses control his his or
[53:07] give
[53:08] god give him these five senses
[53:12] to contact his earthly home
[53:14] those senses are known as see
[53:16] taste feel smell here
[53:20] those five senses which are known to the
[53:23] natural man
[53:25] and they're good
[53:27] and we cannot operate
[53:29] or live in normal life when one of these
[53:33] senses
[53:35] failed to act
[53:37] do we agree with that
[53:40] now when we get down to
[53:44] what we're going to read on the next one
[53:45] let's see if you agree
[53:50] you agree that we cannot operate
[53:54] normally without see tastes feel smelly
[53:57] here
[53:59] because that's what we contact each
[54:00] other with that's what we associate with
[54:03] that's where we work that's what we live
[54:04] it's what we do
[54:05] all is related to that
[54:08] and it's called a sense
[54:11] now
[54:13] my point is is a sense
[54:16] of imagination
[54:21] or is it real
[54:28] is it just an imagination
[54:32] or is it real
[54:36] i'm looking at you
[54:38] that's a sense of sight you're looking
[54:40] at me that's a sense of sight that's not
[54:42] an imagination right that's right
[54:47] i wouldn't want to bite brother callie
[54:48] to see how he tasted but
[54:52] right
[54:56] the five senses
[54:58] are real
[55:00] right write that down write it down
[55:02] because that'll be the thought for the
[55:04] next two services
[55:05] the five senses are real
[55:14] they are a scientific fact
[55:19] remember now
[55:21] i don't have to have faith for a shirt
[55:23] to
[55:24] be on me or a tie
[55:26] it's dire
[55:28] that is a scientific fact
[55:32] right
[55:34] see takes phil smelling here is relating
[55:37] to scientific facts
[55:41] ain't talking about getting any huda
[55:43] duties in your mind and get your mind
[55:45] all messed up and start seeing things
[55:46] that ain't real we're talking about the
[55:49] five senses
[55:51] that are real
[55:53] you're the ones messing with that with
[55:55] drugs and all kind of things that's
[55:57] messing you up
[56:01] well you don't believe in spooks
[56:03] nope i believe we got we disputes
[56:12] but think about it
[56:18] see tastes feel smell in here
[56:22] is the senses of the body and we accept
[56:24] that as being
[56:26] what we're talking about
[56:28] all
[56:28] right but even though we would read the
[56:31] word sense would relate to
[56:34] realization impersonations
[56:38] a sense of awareness
[56:40] or recognition of something
[56:42] a feeling of perception that can come on
[56:45] down to see taste field smell and ear
[56:47] all right
[56:50] but brother brown says
[56:53] they're good
[56:55] and we cannot operate or live a normal
[56:57] life
[56:59] when one of these senses
[57:01] fails to act
[57:04] see there's something missing some
[57:06] portion
[57:07] of life
[57:08] that we cannot contact
[57:11] without the sense acting
[57:13] and they're good and they're useful
[57:16] and they were given to us
[57:18] by god
[57:20] they are real
[57:23] they're not an imagination or a thought
[57:26] they're real
[57:28] now
[57:29] look at the next one
[57:31] experiences 1948
[57:35] e-73
[57:38] if your sense of faith
[57:42] sense of faith
[57:46] and remember what faith is
[57:49] faith is a substance thing so far
[57:54] of faith
[57:55] here it is get it
[57:58] if your sense of faith declares to you
[58:01] that this gift come from god
[58:03] and you're going to be healed
[58:06] just as much
[58:08] as your desire
[58:10] declares
[58:11] that that's a white shirt
[58:14] you're sure to get it when you pass by
[58:21] he's talking about substance faith right
[58:27] sense of faith
[58:31] well brother devil is only five senses
[58:32] ct's phil but now there's six sins we'll
[58:36] get to that later
[58:37] we want to hold it on the point tonight
[58:40] sense
[58:42] of faith somebody answer your phone real
[58:45] quick ring
[58:48] once now
[58:50] now if you can trust the human part
[58:55] now what's the human part see taste
[58:57] field smelt here
[59:02] yeah
[59:03] right
[59:05] if you can trust the human part
[59:09] why not trust the superhuman part
[59:14] if you can trust a body
[59:18] will not trust the spirit
[59:20] for the spirit is superior over the body
[59:23] amen
[59:24] there it is
[59:26] see what i mean
[59:27] it's faith
[59:29] the substance of things hope for
[59:35] not a sense of faith
[59:39] faith is a sense
[59:43] all right
[59:45] i'm holding it to try to keep your mind
[59:47] from relating to the sixth sense as so
[59:50] much for the next message
[59:51] but that's what it is
[59:54] but i'm trying to get you to just look
[59:56] at it
[59:58] look at the next one the queen of the
[1:00:00] south
[1:00:01] 58
[1:00:03] 613.
[1:00:06] look what is faith
[1:00:08] i got a minute here
[1:00:10] face is the substance of things hope for
[1:00:11] the evidence of things not seen
[1:00:14] now seeing isn't believing
[1:00:18] right
[1:00:19] it isn't
[1:00:20] many times come here paul
[1:00:22] there's a man standing by me
[1:00:25] got on a
[1:00:27] grey coat dark hair emmy believes that
[1:00:30] he said
[1:00:31] so now we know what he goes through i
[1:00:33] can feel him i can do this
[1:00:35] we got a new microphone system tonight
[1:00:37] we're playing with the ears like the
[1:00:39] rest of you do but we'll get it adjusted
[1:00:41] all right
[1:00:42] but he said what is faith
[1:00:44] a substance a thing hopefully
[1:00:46] every tense of things you do not see
[1:00:48] tastes feel smelly
[1:00:50] you believe it
[1:00:51] and if every person in here believes
[1:00:53] that jesus christ
[1:00:55] is present
[1:00:58] and is going to heal you
[1:01:01] just the same as your sight
[1:01:12] if you can see
[1:01:14] see that shirt's white
[1:01:16] that's it's settled
[1:01:18] if the synth of faith says
[1:01:20] it's right
[1:01:22] just the same as the sense of sight says
[1:01:25] it's right
[1:01:26] it's over amen you don't need praying
[1:01:29] for or nothing come on it's all over
[1:01:35] so then
[1:01:37] it's more real than see takes field
[1:01:39] smell in here
[1:01:44] a sense of faith is more real
[1:01:46] than anything you can see taste feel
[1:01:49] smell hear
[1:01:52] for real
[1:01:54] right
[1:01:59] he said it's the same as right
[1:02:02] let's go to the next one
[1:02:05] number five
[1:02:08] perfect strength by perfect weakness
[1:02:11] 61 11 29 paragraph 127.
[1:02:16] we're controlled by five senses
[1:02:18] and those five senses see taste filled
[1:02:20] smell in here is very fine until they
[1:02:23] interrupt the sense of faith
[1:02:27] then when they come against faith
[1:02:30] and how do you know which one is
[1:02:32] right how do you know where it's still
[1:02:35] sense of faith
[1:02:37] or the devil
[1:02:39] you know
[1:02:42] all right
[1:02:44] what he says because faith will
[1:02:46] always agree with the word amen
[1:02:51] and then if your faith is contrary to
[1:02:54] the word
[1:02:55] or you think it is then you haven't got
[1:02:58] faith
[1:02:59] you got to make believe that's right
[1:03:01] you've got a boost in your senses
[1:03:04] of some scholarship
[1:03:06] that you've learned about or something i
[1:03:09] love that one
[1:03:12] if it's contrary
[1:03:15] you gotta make believe
[1:03:17] you got a boost in your senses
[1:03:21] something happened to your senses
[1:03:26] of some scholarship that you've learned
[1:03:28] about or something
[1:03:30] but when you get away from that
[1:03:32] and depend completely upon faith
[1:03:35] and faith can only be built upon the
[1:03:38] word of god
[1:03:39] correct faith
[1:03:41] look at the next
[1:03:42] one that was paragraph 127 this is
[1:03:45] paragraph 128.
[1:03:48] he's coming down he's talking about the
[1:03:50] doctor and the things once
[1:03:52] but any man that's mentally balanced
[1:03:56] would know
[1:03:57] that that is the word
[1:03:59] of the living god
[1:04:01] now you're just talking about
[1:04:03] you know god's word you get all about it
[1:04:06] and looking at looking at the word all
[1:04:07] right
[1:04:08] he said with anybody with mental
[1:04:10] violence would know that that's the word
[1:04:12] of god
[1:04:13] but i can base my face upon that and
[1:04:15] show it's thus saith the lord and if
[1:04:17] anything is contrary to that then i
[1:04:19] don't believe my senses
[1:04:22] no sir just leave it alone
[1:04:25] go by your other sense
[1:04:28] the sense of faith
[1:04:32] the christians live by the sense of
[1:04:34] faith
[1:04:35] all right
[1:04:38] look at the next one
[1:04:39] diseases and afflictions
[1:04:41] 1956.
[1:04:43] now another sense that his hearing
[1:04:45] strikes some music during the play you
[1:04:47] know wrote it on it because you're going
[1:04:48] through the sense of hearing the sense
[1:04:50] of doing it
[1:04:51] now faith is the substance of things so
[1:04:53] far the evidence of things you do not
[1:04:55] see tastes feel smelly here
[1:04:57] but the sense of faith is just as real
[1:05:00] as your side is
[1:05:03] or any other of your senses
[1:05:08] how do we believe that
[1:05:14] do we actually believe that
[1:05:18] it's a sense of faith
[1:05:19] it's just as real really it's more real
[1:05:22] but that's just his point of brain
[1:05:25] something you can literally see
[1:05:28] feel
[1:05:30] here
[1:05:36] but is that your faith
[1:05:40] and you'll see why i said paul gave the
[1:05:42] definition
[1:05:44] of what faith was because god gave him a
[1:05:46] direct
[1:05:47] understanding
[1:05:51] faith is the substance of things so far
[1:05:56] think about it
[1:06:02] you see what i mean you believe it
[1:06:05] you just there's no one can make you
[1:06:07] doubt it
[1:06:09] because you're possessed with that sense
[1:06:12] that tells you it's soul
[1:06:16] that's why if the lord tells you you
[1:06:18] don't have to
[1:06:20] worry about it
[1:06:22] everything's all right
[1:06:24] all right
[1:06:26] now faith is the substance 1951
[1:06:31] is something just as real as any other
[1:06:33] sense of the body
[1:06:39] it's just as real
[1:06:43] faith is the substance
[1:06:45] it just isn't a makeup or a thought
[1:06:48] it's a substance
[1:06:49] that's where the trouble's at
[1:06:55] you got a great revelation of this
[1:06:56] message
[1:06:58] and then somebody come along and talk
[1:07:00] you out of it
[1:07:05] and you follow these two souls two lords
[1:07:07] seventh under virtues perusias
[1:07:10] river jordans
[1:07:12] and you get all confused
[1:07:15] then you don't have a revelation
[1:07:18] because there's never been a revelation
[1:07:19] confused
[1:07:21] now i do have one in here that brother
[1:07:23] random says we
[1:07:25] let's
[1:07:28] pull us away
[1:07:30] from
[1:07:31] the faith
[1:07:40] but what is it
[1:07:45] it isn't a makeup or a thought it's a
[1:07:47] real substance
[1:07:49] it's something you just as real as any
[1:07:50] other sense of the body
[1:07:54] what
[1:07:56] there's these five senses that control
[1:07:59] this body
[1:08:00] now watch it
[1:08:02] and there's two senses
[1:08:04] control the inner man
[1:08:06] now listen to him
[1:08:08] and that's faith and unbelief
[1:08:11] for the inward man see tastes filled
[1:08:13] smelling here for the outward man
[1:08:16] all right
[1:08:18] sounds like there's two there
[1:08:23] but what is it going to the next one
[1:08:26] perseverance
[1:08:30] 1962 paragraph e
[1:08:33] faith is the substance of things hope
[1:08:35] for the evidence of things you do not
[1:08:37] see taste feel smelly here
[1:08:39] it's an actual sense that you know
[1:08:42] there's no getting away from it
[1:08:45] you're positive then something is going
[1:08:47] to happen
[1:08:48] when you have that
[1:08:53] i walked out of the baptist church
[1:08:57] they didn't run me out
[1:09:00] my family was a controlling or one of
[1:09:03] the controlling factors
[1:09:05] in the church which would have amounted
[1:09:07] out of a 200 group people about probably
[1:09:10] 150 of us
[1:09:13] they had rule set that no member could
[1:09:15] raise up and become pastor but
[1:09:19] i had enough votes to put me in where i
[1:09:21] wanted me
[1:09:24] it didn't run me off
[1:09:27] i left
[1:09:29] you know why i left
[1:09:32] you've heard me explain it right
[1:09:36] the baptist church
[1:09:37] any other church you can go from this
[1:09:39] church over you can go from a baptist to
[1:09:41] a methodist etc you don't have to have
[1:09:43] that rebaptizing thing but if you go
[1:09:46] from a methodist or anything pentecostal
[1:09:49] catholic or anything to a baptist church
[1:09:51] you're going to get baptized again
[1:09:55] that is their doctrine
[1:10:00] all right
[1:10:04] he said well why don't you keep bringing
[1:10:06] it up because at one point
[1:10:08] the day i got baptized in the name of
[1:10:10] the lord jesus christ
[1:10:12] i knew that day i was out the door
[1:10:15] it wasn't they run me out the door
[1:10:18] i was out the door
[1:10:21] that's right
[1:10:23] because i was contrary to them right
[1:10:26] and was no longer
[1:10:28] taking what they said
[1:10:31] i had a revelation
[1:10:37] have you ever had a revelation when
[1:10:40] somebody come up with a doctrine or an
[1:10:42] idea
[1:10:45] and you listen to them and they really
[1:10:47] are
[1:10:48] flamboyant and great with their words
[1:10:52] and you know seemingly convincing
[1:10:55] but all at once something says
[1:10:58] but that ain't right
[1:11:00] that's right
[1:11:03] something just says but that ain't right
[1:11:08] and have you ever been to the place if
[1:11:10] you were sincere enough to admit that
[1:11:12] you didn't know at that time what was
[1:11:14] right
[1:11:17] you couldn't explain why they was wrong
[1:11:22] you just knew there was something wrong
[1:11:31] so if it held on you had a substance
[1:11:36] right
[1:11:39] look what he goes on to
[1:11:42] did we get through perseverance
[1:11:46] yeah we read it that you know it
[1:11:49] there's no getting away from it you're
[1:11:52] positive there's something going to
[1:11:53] happen
[1:11:54] when you have that
[1:11:57] believe us thou this
[1:12:00] 1951
[1:12:03] look what he says
[1:12:06] e65 right
[1:12:09] you got five senses wrote it on there
[1:12:13] in the human body haven't you see takes
[1:12:15] field smelling here
[1:12:17] i know he's standing there because of
[1:12:18] seed okay he's going through i'm from
[1:12:20] missouri you got to prove to me so i
[1:12:21] gotta prove to you the man standing
[1:12:22] there i see him i hear him i feel him
[1:12:26] right i don't know
[1:12:28] and i know he's there
[1:12:31] in my sense of
[1:12:33] of sight
[1:12:35] cannot see him
[1:12:39] but the sense of faith
[1:12:42] which is a separate sense
[1:12:44] declares that he is there
[1:12:50] you think he's
[1:12:52] jumbled
[1:12:53] but keep reading he unjumbles it
[1:12:58] he says my side
[1:13:01] you know
[1:13:02] but said
[1:13:03] he's a separate sense
[1:13:06] declares that he's there
[1:13:08] you say well that's just another sense
[1:13:09] because it's
[1:13:10] it's
[1:13:12] see
[1:13:12] or taste or feel or smell or hear no
[1:13:15] there's another sense it takes over
[1:13:21] a sense of faith
[1:13:26] let's get to life's room
[1:13:28] i'm doing pretty good i didn't think i'd
[1:13:30] get it
[1:13:33] this is part of the message that i'll
[1:13:34] ask you to listen to if you desire
[1:13:37] by sunday
[1:13:38] and you can see the title of it a super
[1:13:40] sense brother ray said he's done listen
[1:13:42] to it so some of you listen to it if you
[1:13:44] want to
[1:13:45] and we will connect into about paragraph
[1:13:47] 44 and run for quite a while
[1:13:51] in that message
[1:13:53] because it explains everything to a
[1:13:55] detail
[1:13:57] of what i've been talking about and i
[1:13:58] thought well i'll just let him say it
[1:14:01] instead of me quoting quoting quoting
[1:14:03] quoting quoting quoting you know we'll
[1:14:05] let him say it
[1:14:06] all right
[1:14:07] look what he says now
[1:14:12] cast down the reason of these senses
[1:14:17] believe the supersense
[1:14:21] the sense
[1:14:22] of faith
[1:14:24] that jesus gives
[1:14:28] we'll get into it sunday
[1:14:30] you can't have this super sense without
[1:14:32] the new birth
[1:14:34] now you got close to it
[1:14:38] in peternam
[1:14:39] but remember it was faith for the time
[1:14:41] so we're going to have to define that
[1:14:42] again where you'll understand it but
[1:14:44] we'll get down
[1:14:46] cast down the reason of these senses
[1:14:48] believe the supersense the sense of
[1:14:50] faith that jesus christ gives
[1:14:53] by that same sense listen
[1:15:00] read that next part
[1:15:04] right
[1:15:07] the sense
[1:15:09] of faith
[1:15:10] that jesus christ gives
[1:15:14] by that same sense
[1:15:17] god spoke
[1:15:18] when there was nothing right
[1:15:21] what is that sense
[1:15:23] that super sense is god
[1:15:26] the faith of god in you
[1:15:30] the part of god comes into you
[1:15:33] gives you the super sense
[1:15:36] but that same super sense god framed the
[1:15:39] world together with things which was not
[1:15:42] and did not appear he spoke his word
[1:15:45] and believed his word
[1:15:48] and a world
[1:15:49] suck into
[1:15:50] existence he said glory
[1:15:55] so you can see where we're going sunday
[1:15:58] we've got one more message before we
[1:16:00] play the tape
[1:16:02] but
[1:16:03] you can be looking up things all you'd
[1:16:05] like to because i enjoy you doing it
[1:16:08] go home in your computer
[1:16:10] and run in faith is a sixth sense
[1:16:15] you know it's been a whole lot of time
[1:16:18] and i'll show you that you
[1:16:19] you you'll lose a lot by saying faith is
[1:16:21] a sixth sense so just run in six cents
[1:16:25] and make sure you've got a lot of time
[1:16:29] just run in sixth sense
[1:16:33] these people only tell you couldn't
[1:16:34] understand my wording six the number six
[1:16:38] s-i-x-t eight
[1:16:40] since
[1:16:41] s-e-n-s-e
[1:16:43] just run it in like that and read for
[1:16:45] quite a while
[1:16:47] i like for you to read
[1:16:52] it doesn't do away with my job
[1:16:59] i think my job proved his point to start
[1:17:01] with
[1:17:07] about you trying to take your
[1:17:08] definitions of words and find out what
[1:17:11] faith is
[1:17:14] and i've done all of that too
[1:17:19] but then a little voice spoke and said
[1:17:23] the bible
[1:17:25] gives you the definition
[1:17:28] of faith
[1:17:34] the bible gives you the definition of
[1:17:36] faith
[1:17:38] faith is this
[1:17:40] substance of things hoped for
[1:17:43] the evidence of things not seen
[1:17:46] super sense
[1:17:49] sense of faith
[1:17:51] beyond your senses more real
[1:17:55] anchor that in your mind and think about
[1:17:57] it faith is more real than anything you
[1:17:59] can see
[1:18:01] taste feel smell here
[1:18:08] more real
[1:18:11] have you ever failed his presence
[1:18:15] when you turn around and look for it
[1:18:18] it doesn't joggle your mind because you
[1:18:20] don't see with your
[1:18:24] eyes yet the present still stays there
[1:18:29] without you seeing it tasting it feeling
[1:18:32] it smelling it
[1:18:34] but then sometimes he moves it into a
[1:18:36] rim
[1:18:38] but you'll see a flash of light
[1:18:40] you'll hear a
[1:18:43] rumbling of thunder
[1:18:48] you'll smell it
[1:18:51] and you'll know his presence is real
[1:18:57] i wish i could anchor that into your
[1:18:59] heart right
[1:19:02] that god is real he's not just an
[1:19:04] imagination
[1:19:08] this old god is a spirit
[1:19:10] he don't have no form
[1:19:15] well he made man his own image i guess
[1:19:16] we don't have no form
[1:19:23] you see where we're at
[1:19:26] we've become educated people
[1:19:28] who think
[1:19:30] that we by education
[1:19:33] have a revelation
[1:19:38] if our education won't fit our
[1:19:39] revelation
[1:19:41] we got a problem that's right right we
[1:19:43] get in trouble
[1:19:48] but you just sit down a minute and think
[1:19:51] lord
[1:19:54] you mean you created me
[1:19:56] and i think
[1:19:58] that you're just a glob
[1:20:00] that you're just a spirit floating
[1:20:02] around
[1:20:13] remember what the prophet said
[1:20:17] let's get god's atom bomb
[1:20:20] faith
[1:20:22] what do you call it
[1:20:25] and within my hand i hold enough
[1:20:28] to blow up the world
[1:20:39] remember the world came from some
[1:20:41] existence
[1:20:43] was spoken into being
[1:20:49] i'll end by making this statement
[1:20:53] and listen to it
[1:20:56] to be healed
[1:20:58] you must believe in your heart
[1:21:02] and confess with your mouth
[1:21:10] you wait you pray for god to reveal that
[1:21:13] to you
[1:21:16] when you do
[1:21:17] your life at the doctor
[1:21:20] because you've got a substance he can't
[1:21:22] see
[1:21:26] to be
[1:21:26] saved you must believe in your heart
[1:21:31] and confess with your mouth
[1:21:34] that you are saved
[1:21:36] he makes intercession upon our
[1:21:38] profession our confession
[1:21:41] we say we're lost he says we're lost
[1:21:43] we say we're saved he says we're saved
[1:21:49] somebody made a statement the other day
[1:21:51] and probably didn't realize it how long
[1:21:53] i've been preaching it
[1:21:55] i don't mean maybe wouldn't somebody
[1:21:56] here but
[1:21:58] somebody here did make that statement
[1:22:00] too but
[1:22:03] but you know
[1:22:05] the rapture comes that somebody's gonna
[1:22:07] speak it right
[1:22:14] i've taught that ever since the
[1:22:15] beginning 40 something years i've tried
[1:22:17] to get you to see that
[1:22:19] that if there's going to be a rapture
[1:22:20] somebody's going to have to speak
[1:22:23] and to illustrate it i say brother
[1:22:24] random says on the rapture message
[1:22:27] it has been spoken
[1:22:30] now let it come to pass
[1:22:35] you realize they would have never been a
[1:22:37] rapture
[1:22:38] had he not said that
[1:22:46] we're going to have to say we're changed
[1:22:48] before we're changed
[1:22:53] but it doesn't do any good to write
[1:22:54] letters or send it to everybody in the
[1:22:55] world so we're already changed
[1:23:00] then go out and live like the devil the
[1:23:01] rest of the week
[1:23:08] someday somebody's going to say it
[1:23:12] nobody's going to have to say it
[1:23:16] say where it's already changed
[1:23:20] but it'll be a revelation
[1:23:23] not a concept or a thought
[1:23:26] and it won't be because somebody else
[1:23:27] said it
[1:23:34] seen the videos of the man speaking
[1:23:37] he said brother branham would have to
[1:23:38] speak our glorified body into existence
[1:23:43] what he
[1:23:46] said but i believe you and i will have
[1:23:49] to
[1:23:53] we'll have to speak our glorified body
[1:23:55] into existence
[1:23:59] i don't believe brother branham could
[1:24:00] speak all of our bodies into existence
[1:24:04] i believe he can speak his own come on
[1:24:06] man
[1:24:07] but i believe you and i are going to
[1:24:08] have to speak
[1:24:12] and that's what god's waiting on
[1:24:14] a man asked me the other day he said
[1:24:16] what do you think is the end of the
[1:24:17] world the end of all things
[1:24:20] and i just kind of let him lead the way
[1:24:23] and he began to talk about
[1:24:24] the great things happening here and the
[1:24:26] great thing happening here my wife said
[1:24:28] later said
[1:24:29] why didn't you tell him
[1:24:31] that brother brown said they wouldn't
[1:24:32] but one thing
[1:24:34] holding off the coming of the lord
[1:24:36] and that was the readiness of the bride
[1:24:38] right
[1:24:40] i said honey i didn't think of it
[1:24:44] and you know why the prophet says when
[1:24:46] you don't think of it it wasn't meant
[1:24:48] for you to say it
[1:24:50] there was no such thing for me to call
[1:24:52] him on the phone and tell him i let him
[1:24:55] talk
[1:24:56] about what he taught would bring the end
[1:24:58] of the world you know all natural things
[1:25:01] that's good
[1:25:06] what about the church
[1:25:11] is the revelation you have
[1:25:13] a substance
[1:25:15] that's right or it is is it an
[1:25:18] imagination
[1:25:19] boost it up as we read
[1:25:22] boost it up in your senses
[1:25:24] by some scholarship
[1:25:27] come on
[1:25:28] some teaching
[1:25:30] some idea
[1:25:32] you see the people of this message and
[1:25:33] i'm watching them for 40 something years
[1:25:36] somebody come along got to move oh boy
[1:25:38] they're up they're up oh wow we're going
[1:25:39] to speak that word boy and glory glory
[1:25:41] that brother's got everything and had a
[1:25:43] while they just start
[1:25:47] and then most of them go back to the
[1:25:48] world
[1:25:50] a few of them stay with the message
[1:25:54] but let nothing happen in there up again
[1:25:56] and going again
[1:25:58] you know
[1:26:05] what do you have
[1:26:07] come on
[1:26:08] that's why i put it on the internet i'm
[1:26:10] not afraid of anything i preach
[1:26:12] it's open to the public open to the
[1:26:14] world
[1:26:19] boy brother dale i'm not going i'm not
[1:26:21] going to let the world know what i
[1:26:22] believe
[1:26:26] they'll prove to you you don't believe
[1:26:28] what you believe
[1:26:31] you know hey
[1:26:32] man
[1:26:33] i'm not an idiot i'm not going to
[1:26:35] explain that einstein was wrong are you
[1:26:41] you know what i mean by that i'm not
[1:26:43] going to
[1:26:46] tackle the world about a light bulb
[1:26:47] because i don't know nothing about it
[1:26:52] but i do know what this word says
[1:26:54] come ahead musicians
[1:26:56] thank god
[1:26:58] that's what we should know amen the
[1:27:01] bible says they that know their god
[1:27:04] what
[1:27:06] shall do exploits
[1:27:10] but they that know their god
[1:27:17] are you afraid of your revelation
[1:27:24] if you believe something contrary to me
[1:27:28] and you're so afraid of what you
[1:27:30] believe that you wouldn't come and talk
[1:27:33] to me about it
[1:27:35] you don't have a revelation
[1:27:39] because you're afraid
[1:27:43] i'm not afraid of anybody
[1:27:46] i'm not afraid to suggest doctrine with
[1:27:48] anybody
[1:27:51] because i'll just tell you what i
[1:27:52] believe
[1:27:54] at least you can find you can show me
[1:27:56] what i'm right or wrong
[1:28:01] brother dale i'd come and talk to you
[1:28:03] but you just ain't level-headed enough
[1:28:05] to understand
[1:28:07] that may be true but i'll try to get it
[1:28:08] over to the side some way
[1:28:10] you know i'll do the best i can
[1:28:16] you know what i want to be right
[1:28:19] i mean we've come a lot of us 40 50
[1:28:21] years
[1:28:22] and we've been serving god
[1:28:26] and then we would just happily want to
[1:28:28] end this thing up
[1:28:30] no
[1:28:33] understand
[1:28:34] no
[1:28:37] faith is
[1:28:39] the substance
[1:28:42] that's what it is
[1:28:44] of what anything consists of
[1:28:48] anchored back to god
[1:28:50] no there's only one faith
[1:28:52] one lord
[1:28:54] one baptism
[1:28:56] one god
[1:28:58] father what does it say
[1:29:01] only one
[1:29:04] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[1:29:06] what we got right
[1:29:09] 369.
[1:29:14] you have a need
[1:29:16] i believe that same god is here
[1:29:22] i don't have to see him
[1:29:25] feeling
[1:29:26] tasting smelling or hearing
[1:29:32] i believe him
[1:29:34] he said i'll be with you always he
[1:29:37] didn't say
[1:29:38] always
[1:29:40] that he'd be right with us so much we
[1:29:41] could feel it
[1:29:43] a lot of times brother danny he just
[1:29:45] backs up
[1:29:46] i don't see what you'll do
[1:29:51] i want to see what you're doing
[1:29:55] i don't see what you're doing what are
[1:29:57] you doing
[1:29:58] where are you standing
[1:30:17] understanding
[1:30:20] faith
[1:30:22] is a revelation
[1:30:25] that's what we ask for right
[1:30:27] father
[1:30:28] we lay our hands upon our brother asking
[1:30:30] you to open his understanding
[1:30:33] as he said he talked with a man the
[1:30:35] other day and was amazed
[1:30:38] lord sometimes we are understanding it
[1:30:39] over a lot more than we think
[1:30:41] but we just ask you to open this
[1:30:43] understanding
[1:30:44] as to the correct things or writing or
[1:30:46] doings and all in life and being
[1:30:50] just open is understanding of you lord
[1:30:53] you come on the scene
[1:30:55] and you be unto him the thing that he
[1:30:57] has made of
[1:30:59] in jesus name
[1:31:03] anybody else
[1:31:05] what about it
[1:31:08] will your face stand the test
[1:31:16] it ain't gonna be long until you're
[1:31:17] gonna find out
[1:31:19] whether it'll stay in the test or not
[1:31:24] what's it gonna be
[1:31:27] well
[1:31:39] my revelation is what i'm walking on
[1:31:44] not afraid of it
[1:31:48] glad to tell you what i believe
[1:31:52] never been able to keep a secret
[1:31:58] i just refuse a lot of times to talk to
[1:32:00] people because i know if i start talking
[1:32:03] to you we have bible study
[1:32:05] saturday night
[1:32:06] and and some of them have learned a few
[1:32:08] tricks of the trade and they they try to
[1:32:10] pull me into a sparta talking about what
[1:32:12] i'm gonna preach on and i i know that
[1:32:15] but
[1:32:16] i'm still human i'll i'll still
[1:32:19] lean over that way and that while i say
[1:32:20] i'm not going any further
[1:32:22] i'm not gonna talk anymore on it
[1:32:25] because
[1:32:28] i want it to come and let you hear
[1:32:33] because see i really believe faith
[1:32:37] the definition of faith
[1:32:39] is that it's the substance
[1:32:44] of what i have need of
[1:32:46] i believe
[1:32:48] well then if i have a revelation of just
[1:32:50] one god
[1:32:51] that's the substance of that god
[1:32:57] mr gill it's not something we're going
[1:32:58] to get
[1:33:01] it's what we have
[1:33:05] at least let's walk on what we got
[1:33:09] if he's just seeing water baptism thank
[1:33:11] you lord
[1:33:18] gotta be something real
[1:33:20] faith the substance
[1:33:24] not an imagination or a thought
[1:33:26] it won't hold you
[1:33:29] somebody talk you out of it
[1:33:34] but if you really got it it'll hold you
[1:33:38] you have your hand upstairs
[1:33:39] i was just thinking
[1:33:43] about myself and
[1:33:46] i think it's like we have a veil over
[1:33:48] our eyes
[1:33:50] like before you know
[1:33:52] who god really is that veil you know
[1:33:56] and we look at ourselves with these
[1:33:58] earthly eyes and we look at each other
[1:34:00] with these earthly eyes
[1:34:03] how in the world can we make a rapture
[1:34:05] looking at people and ourselves like
[1:34:07] that we've got to go beyond that and
[1:34:09] look at ourselves the way god looks at
[1:34:12] us and the way he looks at other people
[1:34:14] and if we can do that with godly eyes
[1:34:17] we're going to be a whole lot closer but
[1:34:18] it's something he gives you you can't
[1:34:20] work yourself into it it's a revelation
[1:34:23] and i seek that revelation because when
[1:34:25] i look at myself i think how could this
[1:34:28] body this person this
[1:34:30] how could i make a rapture you know
[1:34:33] and i was talking to some sisters
[1:34:35] tonight and i think they basically may
[1:34:37] feel the same way that i do
[1:34:39] uh you look at other people and you
[1:34:41] think oh they're just so much better
[1:34:43] than i am
[1:34:46] anyway i that's just was thought that
[1:34:47] kept going through my mind you've got to
[1:34:49] change the way you look at yourself and
[1:34:52] in other things to get beyond this veil
[1:34:54] that's over your eyes to move in
[1:34:57] to a place where we can have a rapture
[1:35:01] remember god doesn't deal with see takes
[1:35:03] field spelling
[1:35:06] god deals with the supersense
[1:35:09] of faith
[1:35:10] he doesn't live in our natural
[1:35:12] capacities
[1:35:15] he lives in a realm of supernatural
[1:35:19] because he's already been here in a
[1:35:21] natural
[1:35:23] so what it was like understands us
[1:35:28] but he's in a supernatural realm
[1:35:33] not looking at things we do or don't do
[1:35:37] he doesn't do that
[1:35:41] but then what's the problem is it's like
[1:35:44] i tried to explain it the other day
[1:35:48] then for me to know that he doesn't look
[1:35:49] at me
[1:35:51] and see what i do
[1:35:53] you mean i would in any way have a
[1:35:55] thought in my mind
[1:35:57] that it doesn't matter
[1:35:59] because he doesn't see me
[1:36:07] i'm under the blood he doesn't sin how
[1:36:09] could i ever have that thought
[1:36:13] that it's all right for me to do
[1:36:15] anything
[1:36:17] because he doesn't see me
[1:36:22] that's all right i know i'm guilty
[1:36:24] but he didn't see me
[1:36:26] no i want to repent
[1:36:29] i want to confess
[1:36:32] and believe
[1:36:37] well because of what he's done for me
[1:36:42] then i look beyond the natural
[1:36:46] i've asked you before have you ever done
[1:36:48] it
[1:36:48] i looked at a person one day with my own
[1:36:50] natural eyesight and was standing there
[1:36:53] looking just like looking at brother
[1:36:54] collie with my natural eyes
[1:36:57] and all at once i went back in my head
[1:37:02] and i saw that person different
[1:37:05] than i'd ever seen them in my life
[1:37:09] i didn't see their faults and failures
[1:37:14] i saw them the way god saw
[1:37:22] he said what i've never done that would
[1:37:23] brother that one
[1:37:24] all right
[1:37:29] maybe sometimes you don't want to do the
[1:37:31] things that
[1:37:32] some people have seen and done because
[1:37:34] it's too much requirement goes with it
[1:37:40] and that way then there's no need of
[1:37:42] talking about it because people get the
[1:37:44] wrong idea
[1:37:47] you pray
[1:37:49] that god let you
[1:37:51] see people different
[1:37:54] than what they are
[1:37:59] well i'll tell you what i'm going to let
[1:38:01] them get by with that i'm going to
[1:38:02] preach
[1:38:07] be careful
[1:38:10] be careful
[1:38:12] truth is truth we must tell it
[1:38:15] and a lot of times i have to tell it
[1:38:17] but i don't like it
[1:38:20] you don't like the truth no i don't like
[1:38:22] to have to tell it
[1:38:24] because it always hurts
[1:38:26] i told a man at work one day something
[1:38:28] and i said because i've told you
[1:38:31] i will lose your friendship
[1:38:37] i did
