[35:45] last night and she had to stay at home
[35:47] this morning wasn't able to go to church

[35:52] fought the Battle with them for years
[35:53] and they're getting better but that's
[35:56] you know that's one of the those things
[35:57] but good to be here always good to be
[36:00] here we had a wonderful time when
[36:01] brother Jim came out and preached for us
[36:04] and all and just we really enjoyed it I
[36:07] enjoy the the word of the Lord don't you
[36:10] so let's just go into the scriptures if
[36:12] you'd like to turn in the scripture to
[36:15] follow along with us turn to Joshua
[36:20] 10 Joshua
[36:22] 10 and we'll begin reading about verse
[36:25] 12 and then we'll
[36:27] get over to Hebrews 1 so Joshua
[36:31] 10 Hebrews 1 I'm just the kind of a guy
[36:35] that I like
[36:38] to speak to people and and I like to get
[36:41] you to thinking yes I don't like to see
[36:45] you standing there with a blank face and
[36:47] you know I mean I'd rather see you
[36:49] frowning than to see you with just blank
[36:52] I'd rather see you saying what in the
[36:53] world is this guy talking about than to
[36:55] just I don't care what he says you but
[36:59] uh I like to get you to
[37:01] think because that means that God can
[37:04] speak to you brother around and said a
[37:06] minister had only one thing a gift and
[37:10] he said that gift was to
[37:12] get to block that spell that Satan has
[37:16] over your eyes
[37:18] right he said where God can speak to you
[37:21] thank you Lord so that's all the gift is
[37:23] for and that's what we're doing okay
[37:24] let's pray father we thank you for your
[37:27] love and your grace unto us we thank you
[37:28] for this day and this opportunity and
[37:30] Lord we love you and we pray that you
[37:32] would just come this day now and speak
[37:34] to us touch her wife Lord and let
[37:36] everything be well and be with the the
[37:38] church there we know they're already in
[37:39] service and just bless and take care of
[37:41] everything be with Wade over at
[37:43] Bartlesville AR with brother Claud and
[37:45] him and just bless and just let your
[37:47] love be made manifest with each one of
[37:48] us as we read your word you come and
[37:51] speak to our hearts because we love you
[37:53] and we thank you in Jesus name amen
[37:57] and I came off and had to bar glasses
[38:00] cuz mine's left in the cabin so if I
[38:03] don't read right it'll be Jim's
[38:06] fault you know reading through other
[38:07] people's glces you know all
[38:11] right verse 12 very familiar with
[38:14] everybody then spake Joshua hey man I
[38:16] can read it here I didn't have to need
[38:17] no glasses brother
[38:19] J okay all right then spake Joshua to
[38:24] the Lord in the day when the Lord
[38:26] delivered up the amorites before the
[38:27] children of Israel and he said in the
[38:30] sight of Israel son stand thou still
[38:34] over upon gibon and thou moon in the
[38:37] valley of adelon and the sun Stood Still
[38:40] and the moon stayed until the people had
[38:42] avenge themselves upon their enemies is
[38:45] not this written in the book of jasher
[38:48] so the son stood still in the midst of
[38:50] heaven and hasted not to go down about a
[38:54] whole day there was was no day like now
[38:57] get this point and there was no day like
[39:00] that day before it or after it that the
[39:04] Lord hearkened unto the voice of a
[39:08] man for the Lord fought for Israel now
[39:12] let's go over to
[39:13] Hebrews very familiar everybody knows it
[39:17] all right God who at Su times and
[39:19] diverse maners spake in times past in
[39:24] the fathers by the prophets so you know
[39:25] what's the prophet of God said he spake
[39:27] in the prophets that word by should have
[39:30] been translated in but it's fine because
[39:32] it's okay all right and hath in these
[39:35] last days spoken unto us by his son whom
[39:37] he hath appointed heir of all things but
[39:39] whom also he made the worlds amen you
[39:43] may be seated the Lord at his Blessing
[39:45] to the reading of the word
[39:48] now you know mankind says they can't
[39:51] trust the
[39:53] Bible because it was written by man
[39:57] well you know that's right in a degree
[40:00] of pinning it uh speaking it you know
[40:05] bringing it to us uh those things are
[40:08] true but we read in the Bible that God
[40:12] LED those men amen see all right so now
[40:17] don't misunderstand me when we get on
[40:18] over into the message in a minute of
[40:20] anything you'd think I'm trying to say I
[40:22] say what I mean and I mean what I say as
[40:25] whether it's good or bad that's the way
[40:26] I am I just say what I mean so don't try
[40:29] to figure out what I'm talking about
[40:31] just listen all right and
[40:34] see we know that the Bible then was
[40:38] brought to us by
[40:41] prophets man brought the Bible to us God
[40:45] used that man all right now it was at
[40:48] one time there even with Moses you
[40:50] remember that uh God wanted to speak to
[40:53] all of
[40:55] Israel but they they
[40:57] chose for a man to speak to them all
[41:01] right so then God said okay that's the
[41:03] way I'll do it I'll do it through man
[41:05] I'll bring it to you and I'll and see
[41:08] then we are the ones that chose it you
[41:09] say I wasn't back there to do that but
[41:12] we were because we're human all right
[41:15] and when they chose that that put us in
[41:18] a
[41:19] category to where we must believe what
[41:21] man
[41:22] says now if the man's wrong it proves to
[41:25] be wrong we don't believe him right I
[41:28] mean sensible if it's something out of
[41:30] the Bible it's not right there's
[41:32] doctrines trinities Etc that were taught
[41:35] by man that we don't believe but that
[41:37] was days gone by we're supposed to be
[41:39] today to where that we can believe the
[41:41] word of the Lord would you notice there
[41:43] in verse 14 as I emphasize it said God
[41:47] hearkened to the voice of a
[41:51] man
[41:55] now you know I I believe it this way and
[42:00] this is the way I've always taught it to
[42:02] my people when brother Jim came out and
[42:05] spoke to
[42:07] us I invited him to come I believe the
[42:10] Lord LED it and all like that and you
[42:12] know I believe that's God's way of
[42:16] speaking right if I hadn't I wouldn't
[42:18] have called him okay I believe that's
[42:22] the way of God speaking so then there
[42:24] wasn't 10 other guys supposed to come in
[42:26] and preach you know I mean it wouldn't
[42:28] have mattered to me and you know if if
[42:30] brother Jim was scheduled to preach and
[42:33] and and uh Obama wanted to come I I'd
[42:36] have said sorry I got a speaker
[42:39] scheduled you know I don't care about
[42:42] what you believe or whatever but I got
[42:44] somebody schedule cuz I believe that's
[42:46] God's way of speaking is through man
[42:48] sure to us right now that's my whole
[42:50] point right
[42:53] now
[42:54] remember and we're going to going to get
[42:56] some scriptures in a minute to bring out
[42:58] something and I have a odd way of
[43:00] approaching something so follow the
[43:02] approach and after a while I say okay
[43:04] now you ready here's what I got to say
[43:06] okay all right now even in the writing
[43:11] of the
[43:12] Bible I'm believing cuz some of these
[43:15] notes I I had to write I getting here
[43:18] and changed a few things
[43:20] but I believe it's in the second seal
[43:23] that brother brandom said that
[43:28] God gave to Moses a thought he said
[43:32] first it was God's thought he said he
[43:35] gave it to Moses as a
[43:37] thought he said it was not the
[43:40] word he said but then when Moses spoke
[43:44] it it was the word so you understand
[43:47] that the word was written before the
[43:48] world and coming down that's the point
[43:51] that the prophet received the thought
[43:53] what how did um how did Abraham say why
[43:58] did he say I'll give you a tenth of the
[44:02] spoil I mean what what was that number
[44:04] off the top of his head well then we pay
[44:07] a 10% TI don't we right I mean see that
[44:11] would fit together that God before the
[44:13] world transmitted down through the the
[44:16] to Abraham and he just didn't pick up a
[44:18] number and say well I'll give you 10%
[44:20] right you already gave him 90 you know
[44:23] but see but when it was finished it's in
[44:27] God's word then it all fits all the way
[44:30] through and then you'll see that it's
[44:32] been God the whole time leading the
[44:35] writing of the Bible that's my whole
[44:37] point amen all right so then it was not
[44:39] the word until Moses spoke it out right
[44:43] then it became words unto us all right
[44:46] now what about that
[44:48] man now that walked out there one day
[44:52] and he said I know he done it through
[44:53] through Aaron but he went out there and
[44:57] he said let there be
[45:00] flies and they
[45:02] came Let There Be fleas frogs Etc it
[45:05] came right by the words of a man the
[45:10] Bible said that he plagued
[45:12] Egypt with his
[45:15] word actually through Moses he plagued
[45:18] Egypt with the words from a man right
[45:21] now that's that's the point I want you
[45:23] to look at and let's turn over now to
[45:26] another scripture and pick it up look at
[45:29] Exodus
[45:31] 32 all right Exodus
[45:35] 32 we'll begin reading about
[45:40] 30 now I got a slide way of sliding
[45:42] things
[45:45] in I say that to where you remember what
[45:48] I get when I get back to it after a
[45:49] while and I'll put my point in and then
[45:52] I want you to catch
[45:54] it and if you don't catch it I'll come
[45:56] back and tell you what it
[45:58] is but then you can look on people's
[46:00] faces and they
[46:02] go see they getting the point okay I'm
[46:05] I'm carnal I know but that's just me
[46:07] forgive
[46:08] me but look look what he says in verse
[46:12] now 30 of Exodus 32 and it came to pass
[46:16] on tomorrow that Moses said unto the
[46:18] people now you know what this was was
[46:19] the golden CF situation and all of that
[46:22] you know look what he said he said unto
[46:25] people you have a great sin and now I
[46:27] will go up unto the Lord PR Adventure I
[46:31] shall make an atonement for your
[46:33] sins now remember that Moses making
[46:38] atonement Moses returned unto the
[46:42] Lord and said oh this people have sinned
[46:45] a great sin and have made them gods of
[46:49] gold yet now if thou will not forgive
[46:53] them their sin if not BL me I pray thee
[46:57] out of thy book which thou has
[46:59] written and you we know what happened
[47:03] God told Moses said
[47:07] okay I won't kill him he said I'll deal
[47:10] with him and he did he said they won't
[47:14] go into the land but they'll go up to it
[47:17] they'll get around it yeah they won't be
[47:19] able to go in right but he said now I'm
[47:22] going to spare them now now I know so
[47:24] many thousand that day but the biggest
[47:27] portion of Israel out of the some 2
[47:29] million they went right on their Journey
[47:32] going on towards the promised land all
[47:34] right now we know what brother brandham
[47:38] has said about this of reading the
[47:40] scripture you know blot my name
[47:44] out and uh I don't feel on some of these
[47:48] I have to give you all of it because I'm
[47:50] standing before congregation as well
[47:52] taught and you'll know even the quote
[47:54] and we were laughing want to go about my
[47:56] cut and
[47:57] paste really is cut and
[48:00] tape all right they laugh at me at home
[48:03] but we get it
[48:05] done now we know that brother brandham
[48:09] said that he even had
[48:12] trouble with the fact that Moses could
[48:15] tell God a better way of doing
[48:18] something don't know he said if you blot
[48:22] them out blot me
[48:24] out all right so we know that that was
[48:27] not Moses brother Brandon said on the
[48:29] message souls in prison paragraph
[48:32] 77 or 1
[48:35] 117 he said that always puzzled me how
[48:39] that God could tell Moses Moses could
[48:41] tell God a better way than God had till
[48:43] I found out that it was the spirit of
[48:46] Christ in
[48:48] Moses all now we're back in Hebrews 1
[48:52] right that God in the prophets
[48:57] spoke to man so we're not putting the
[49:00] honor upon the
[49:03] man the honor is going upon the god that
[49:07] would speak but you can't leave the man
[49:09] out of the
[49:13] situation it can't be done it's got to
[49:15] be left out way so he says you know if
[49:17] you're going to do that block my name
[49:18] out all right but now listen to this
[49:22] one this is take looking looking to
[49:25] Jesus which is paragraph
[49:28] 83 the brothers are putting them up and
[49:30] they're real good at that and as they do
[49:32] it at home I hand them these you know
[49:33] but I didn't hand these so they're
[49:35] they're getting ahead of me okay but
[49:37] look what he says and there was another
[49:39] one that puzzled me that was when Moses
[49:42] paragraph
[49:44] 85 could tell God a better way than God
[49:47] knowed how to do anything when Moses
[49:50] said the people will
[49:54] say you're God God was able to bring you
[49:56] out but not able to keep you and Moses
[50:00] threw himself in the
[50:02] breach then later I found out that Moses
[50:05] that that was Christ and Moses standing
[50:08] for the people now we'll get to it in a
[50:11] minute that's actually quoting numbers
[50:16] 14 all right the one we read was Exodus
[50:20] now we we'll get to numbers 14 in a
[50:21] minute and you'll see but see just don't
[50:24] don't lose the point I I tell you that
[50:26] because see that's actually in numbers
[50:29] 14 all right which is another situation
[50:32] that Moses has to do the same
[50:34] thing but this is what I like he said in
[50:36] modern events made clear by prophecy
[50:39] paragraph
[50:41] 57 that he's the same yesterday today
[50:45] and forever he said it was Christ in
[50:48] Noah it was Christ in
[50:51] Moses it was Jesus Christ in David it
[50:54] was Jesus Christ in Joseph it's Jesus
[50:57] Christ the same yesterday today and
[50:59] forever and it's Jesus Christ among his
[51:01] people
[51:03] today doing the same thing that he
[51:05] promised he' do in that age all right so
[51:09] now we know the story then that the real
[51:14] man is the man God you know himself
[51:17] speaking through a
[51:19] man but he doesn't do
[51:23] anything apart from man right
[51:26] okay so now watch the point as we begin
[51:29] to just lay it down just a little
[51:32] bit even God allows a man brother brand
[51:36] on The Sixth
[51:37] Seal he said he was out there and and
[51:40] God was revealing those things to him
[51:42] and listen to a
[51:44] prophet I don't have this quote but he
[51:46] said God I can't tell them
[51:50] that
[51:53] yeah a man
[51:57] that could have such a connection to the
[52:01] mind of
[52:04] God that he could say as Jos as Moses
[52:08] would say you blot them out blot me out
[52:11] he wasn't playing games his life was on
[52:14] the line
[52:15] right but he knew how to deal because
[52:18] over numbers when we read that in a
[52:19] minute you'll see it a little better he
[52:21] knew how to deal with
[52:24] God and there in numbers he says now it
[52:27] will be said that's the quote of again
[52:30] that you could bring them out but you
[52:31] couldn't take them
[52:33] in he he knew how to deal with it now
[52:37] this may be carnal to you but even
[52:41] balum with a prophetic
[52:43] gift he could not curse Israel right
[52:46] right cuz God said you can't do it right
[52:49] but with that gift in the presence of
[52:52] the Eternal God he could back out of
[52:56] and tell bik I can't curse him but I
[53:01] tell you how to get them
[53:02] defeated just get them Moab about women
[53:05] over with
[53:07] them get them men around them Moab about
[53:09] women because they were pretty and the
[53:11] Israeli women wasn't too pretty cuz
[53:13] they're out there living in the deserts
[53:14] and like and you know the story so he
[53:18] goes and they get him there but now I I
[53:21] don't lay it all against all things but
[53:23] I just put it all together you know a
[53:24] lot of those Israelite women wanted to
[53:26] look like him Moab about women that's
[53:29] why you got them painting their faces
[53:30] and all today you know they still want
[53:33] to be the mo about women but just making
[53:36] that point but just
[53:39] think Moses
[53:42] said
[53:45] God they will
[53:47] say you were able to bring them out but
[53:52] not able to take them
[53:54] in
[53:56] and you know what Moses what God told
[53:59] Moses turn over there to numbers 14 and
[54:01] see what he told
[54:06] him and we won't have to read all of it
[54:08] to get down because you got the story in
[54:10] of It Go Just Right Back above in verse
[54:12] 13 14 15 but get down to verse
[54:17] 20 he said pardon I beseech Thee the
[54:21] iniquity of this people
[54:23] according unto to the greatness of thy
[54:27] mercy that's just after he's finished
[54:29] telling them they will say you could
[54:31] bring them out but you couldn't take you
[54:32] couldn't get them in so it's going to be
[54:34] against your
[54:35] name and we're going to read a quote in
[54:37] a minute where brother R said he
[54:39] promised
[54:41] him so Moses was reminding god of the
[54:45] promise so look what he
[54:50] says and as thou Hast forgiven this
[54:54] people from Egypt up until
[54:57] now you know in other words you've been
[55:00] forgiven them you go on down below here
[55:02] in the next verse or two you'll find
[55:04] that they sinned 10 times from the time
[55:06] they
[55:07] left the Red Sea or you know left Egypt
[55:11] to the to Cades Barne I think 10 times
[55:14] and you know God was ready to take them
[55:16] in you know the sin that kept Israel
[55:19] from going to the promised land the big
[55:21] one cadis
[55:23] barnea when he didn't believe God's word
[55:26] when he said I give you the
[55:30] land and God said that's it I can look
[55:33] over you here and look over you there
[55:34] and looked over you 10 times but you
[55:36] ain't going right because see they
[55:39] become
[55:41] unbelievers right but look what he says
[55:43] in verse 30 verse uh 20 and the Lord
[55:48] said I have
[55:50] pardoned according to Thy Word
[55:57] and what about the words of a
[56:00] man that he could so go before
[56:05] God get an audience with
[56:08] God he'd know the mind of God and know
[56:11] what he was fixing to
[56:14] do but yet he could turn
[56:17] around and use that gift that was in his
[56:22] life to be able to what would be a word
[56:25] for it I don't have any education but be
[56:28] able to bargain with God or deal with
[56:33] God or whatever words you would use you
[56:35] know he would be able to talk to him in
[56:37] plain
[56:39] language and said now look you blot
[56:42] their name blot mine
[56:45] out don't let it be said that you could
[56:49] bring them out cuz he knew they was out
[56:51] but said you can't take them in cuz you
[56:54] promised them You' take them in all
[56:56] right let's see what brother R had to
[56:59] say that's why I like to read what he
[57:01] has to say you
[57:03] knowen this is from the message
[57:07] presuming
[57:09] e24 you come on down watch what he
[57:12] says said he would have killed the whole
[57:14] world he said that was Christ and Moses
[57:17] he would have killed the world and
[57:18] everything but look Christ throwed
[57:20] himself in the breach for the whole
[57:22] human race we know that Moses thred
[57:25] himself in the breach for Israel and he
[57:27] said you made a promise God you made a
[57:30] promise that you'd take them to the land
[57:33] that's right what did Moses do to
[57:36] God now listen we're reading what he
[57:39] said what did Moses do to
[57:42] God when looked like God was going to do
[57:45] something
[57:46] contrary he throwed the word in his
[57:51] way I'm reading brother random it's up
[57:53] behind you here he throwed the word in
[57:57] his
[57:58] way see amen I love that brother R says
[58:03] I feel like
[58:04] shouting just talking about it put the
[58:07] word in the way God can't walk over his
[58:11] own word am all right said you promised
[58:15] to do it you said you would take them to
[58:18] the good land that was flowing with milk
[58:20] and honey I've told them what you said
[58:25] listen and here we are we're on your
[58:31] hands see he knew how to deal with God
[58:36] all
[58:37] right look on down to the next one the
[58:39] message on the second seal paragraph 54
[58:42] right down at the bottom you get all of
[58:44] the coming down to it
[58:46] but and there Moses took the place of
[58:49] Christ then to throw himself in the
[58:51] breach and say don't do it Lord see and
[58:54] of and of course he after he'd ordained
[58:57] Moses to do
[58:58] this he didn't come over
[59:01] Moses this is brother randam saying it
[59:04] what he because he was acting like
[59:06] Christ in that time that was Christ in
[59:12] Moses he ordained Moses for the job and
[59:14] he wouldn't come over him right and we
[59:17] know he was kind of discontented with
[59:18] him back there when he smoked the
[59:20] rock
[59:23] right and we know that caused Moses to
[59:26] not get to be able to go to the promised
[59:27] land as a Walkin he was 800 years later
[59:31] coming into scripture but yet he wasn't
[59:33] able to
[59:35] go but you see he could he could go
[59:37] before God being a prophet that's why I
[59:39] mentioned balum balum could go before
[59:41] God he could see the Holiness and
[59:43] righteousness of God but he couldn't
[59:46] curse Israel but he could go before him
[59:48] and look at it and he'd say if I can
[59:50] just get them to do something wrong amen
[59:53] yeah you remember even balam was shown
[59:56] the hinder
[59:58] part in other words the worst thing that
[1:00:00] could be happening in Israel he said I
[1:00:03] don't see it he couldn't go over it but
[1:00:07] yet he come out of it with an
[1:00:09] understanding that's why brother random
[1:00:11] says you got the line the ox the man the
[1:00:13] eagle he said the man is
[1:00:17] shrewd he uses his
[1:00:21] mind you see it in the message you see
[1:00:23] preachers
[1:00:25] that they don't care what the word says
[1:00:27] they're using words to get the mind of
[1:00:31] the people
[1:00:33] right and they can get them on that side
[1:00:35] and they'll
[1:00:37] say well the brother is a wonderful
[1:00:42] brother yeah but he's off the message
[1:00:44] but but but he said he believed the
[1:00:49] prophet some people told my wife years
[1:00:51] ago this right we come in the message
[1:00:53] about a man named lry over in India and
[1:00:58] she said I'm I Dar say anything about
[1:01:00] him said cuz he's
[1:01:02] God said he's he's preaching he's God my
[1:01:05] wife she said does he believe brother
[1:01:07] R's message she said well no said he he
[1:01:10] he he he say his brother R was wrong you
[1:01:12] know and changing well wife said well I
[1:01:13] don't give a hoot I can say what I want
[1:01:15] to about
[1:01:16] him you know maybe she didn't use the
[1:01:19] word hoot that's son the language okay
[1:01:21] but the point she wasn't worried that's
[1:01:24] right if he was off the messag am amen
[1:01:27] but you see the shrewdness of man's mind
[1:01:30] man's
[1:01:31] words you can take a man's words and you
[1:01:34] can twist
[1:01:35] right you I know your pastor he knows
[1:01:38] the truth about any Doctrine you call
[1:01:40] the brother Brown's message and I'll
[1:01:43] give you a quote from Brother Brown I
[1:01:45] from memory that will sound like it's
[1:01:48] contrary is that
[1:01:51] true he said one day he said now you
[1:01:53] know he was always one true and living
[1:01:55] God he said one day let's stand and
[1:01:56] address the third person of the
[1:02:00] Trinity right now did he believe in a
[1:02:03] trinity no that was your Trinity he was
[1:02:06] telling you let's adj just the one you
[1:02:07] want to talk to yeah he didn't believe
[1:02:10] in it itself see but see man's words can
[1:02:14] be
[1:02:15] twisted and make things that's what they
[1:02:18] do in the message they take so much of
[1:02:20] the message and then they twist
[1:02:22] it to where just Twisted enough and then
[1:02:25] until now they're saying that even Jesus
[1:02:28] done wrong
[1:02:33] yeah great followings
[1:02:35] though you know well I'm just honest now
[1:02:40] if if I follow a doctorine I don't mind
[1:02:42] telling you I follow it no
[1:02:45] problem you ask me what I believe I'll
[1:02:48] tell you yeah and I won't sugarcoated
[1:02:50] either I'll tell you up front what I
[1:02:53] believe and I'll tell you why I don't
[1:02:55] believe something else you
[1:02:57] know see because that's just the words
[1:03:00] of a man all right but now look God has
[1:03:05] got to keep his promise look at the last
[1:03:06] quote we give you sir as we would see
[1:03:08] Jesus paragraph uh
[1:03:11] E36 he said if God don't keep his
[1:03:15] promise then it's not God's
[1:03:18] word god couldn't be God make a promise
[1:03:22] and did not keep it
[1:03:25] all right
[1:03:28] now at the words of a
[1:03:31] man God would spare
[1:03:36] Israel at the words of a
[1:03:39] man he would actually say I
[1:03:42] pardoned those
[1:03:45] people now without going back and
[1:03:48] reading it I want to just get the whole
[1:03:50] story now all that's
[1:03:53] background
[1:03:55] we read the scripture where that in
[1:03:57] Exodus
[1:03:59] 32 that after they had made the golden
[1:04:02] CF and the great sin Joshua said I'll go
[1:04:06] up before the
[1:04:09] Lord and said pre-
[1:04:12] Adventure I can make an
[1:04:17] atonement
[1:04:19] right now we deal with basically don't
[1:04:23] blot out and just blot out that's
[1:04:24] basically you're preaching from that
[1:04:27] point but I want you to think about what
[1:04:29] is an
[1:04:30] atonement it's a
[1:04:33] covering you know a lot of times Moses
[1:04:37] would tell Aaron say take your sensor
[1:04:39] run among the people you know and make
[1:04:41] an
[1:04:42] atonement all right there were more
[1:04:44] atonements than just a
[1:04:49] lamb or a goat or things like I said he
[1:04:53] tell Aaron said take take your censure
[1:04:55] run in off the fire and of the altar get
[1:04:58] that go among the
[1:05:00] people and make an atonement for him
[1:05:03] make a covering for
[1:05:06] him but I want to ask you a simple
[1:05:08] question this is a whole message is one
[1:05:12] nutshell what was the offering Moses
[1:05:16] made when he said I shall make an
[1:05:23] atonement
[1:05:24] what was the
[1:05:26] offering it was not far off the altar
[1:05:29] even though Aaron done that and that
[1:05:31] was it was not a ram a goat or a lamb or
[1:05:37] whatever what was the
[1:05:46] atonement it was his
[1:05:50] word excuse
[1:05:52] me right if was his word
[1:05:56] right he reminded god of what he had
[1:06:00] said right brother R said you find it in
[1:06:03] the Bible call God on the scene he'll do
[1:06:08] it because he said it he can't deny his
[1:06:11] word Moses never offered any
[1:06:14] animal he never even offered fire from
[1:06:17] the
[1:06:20] altar it was his
[1:06:23] word
[1:06:26] you blot them
[1:06:27] out blot me
[1:06:31] out same thing would be on over in
[1:06:34] numbers when he'd come to that place
[1:06:37] that he begin to deal with
[1:06:40] God and say God it'll be said that you
[1:06:43] could bring them out but you can't take
[1:06:45] them
[1:06:46] in so don't let that be said to keep
[1:06:48] your
[1:06:49] promise he reminded God of his
[1:06:53] word
[1:06:57] think about
[1:06:59] that the words of a
[1:07:02] man now we establish that that man
[1:07:05] speaking through Moses was Christ
[1:07:08] right speaking through Joshua was
[1:07:12] Christ but there was a connection to the
[1:07:14] human
[1:07:17] man that you cannot
[1:07:20] separate and I read you the quote or
[1:07:22] showed it to you there we did that he
[1:07:24] said he chose Moses for the job and he
[1:07:27] would not go over him
[1:07:31] right I know I'm carnal the way I speak
[1:07:34] but I like to make you think if Peter
[1:07:36] have said in Acts two repent every one
[1:07:39] of you and go off for a $10
[1:07:42] bill that would have been what it was
[1:07:46] and if you got the Holy Ghost you'd have
[1:07:47] done
[1:07:50] that but he wasn't going to do it that
[1:07:52] way why because the mind of Christ
[1:07:53] Christ was in Peter to tell him what to
[1:07:56] do see the mind of Christ come through
[1:07:59] Moses and
[1:08:01] told God a better way of doing
[1:08:05] something the atonement Moses made was
[1:08:08] his own words yes that he took before
[1:08:11] the
[1:08:12] man so you know what we are built on the
[1:08:15] words of a man yes it said about brother
[1:08:18] Randon when he was talking on the sick
[1:08:20] seal he said Lord I can't tell him
[1:08:22] that
[1:08:27] what about I know this is going to be
[1:08:28] short and sweet so I like
[1:08:32] it what about a man that could stand in
[1:08:35] this
[1:08:37] day and said let there be
[1:08:44] squirrel God didn't tell him how to
[1:08:46] speak that he just told him what
[1:08:49] whatever you have need of
[1:08:52] speaking go through the life of brother
[1:08:55] brandham then of the things of the third
[1:08:56] pull and the things of speaking to the
[1:08:59] uh storms out of existence the uh you
[1:09:01] know the the the growth that was on his
[1:09:04] wife the the things that he spoke of
[1:09:06] sister had right took the words of a
[1:09:11] man that said I give you your
[1:09:14] children sure I heard years later and
[1:09:17] they I don't know about it they said
[1:09:18] they'd both be slid but that don't
[1:09:21] bother me how many times you ever
[1:09:29] backslid see brother random said
[1:09:32] it now that's not for everybody cuz
[1:09:34] brother Brown said it to the
[1:09:37] person but get the
[1:09:40] point what atonement do we need today
[1:09:42] what do we
[1:09:44] offer we don't go get a lamb and crucify
[1:09:47] it right
[1:09:51] right we've got God's
[1:09:55] word I thought we believed in like
[1:09:58] Romans 8:10 everywh it is in there that
[1:10:02] you believe in your heart right and
[1:10:04] confess with your mouth Yes you be saved
[1:10:09] right you know what you're doing you're
[1:10:11] reminding God of his word right he said
[1:10:13] if you do that in Acts two you'd be
[1:10:15] saved right repent everyone and be
[1:10:17] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:10:18] remission sin you shall receive the gift
[1:10:19] of the Holy Ghost promises to you and
[1:10:21] your children and far all you just
[1:10:23] reminding God
[1:10:26] right it it don't bother God for you to
[1:10:28] remind him what he
[1:10:31] said come on how many daddies in here
[1:10:34] especially granddaddies now that's the
[1:10:35] worst part but how many daddies in here
[1:10:37] your kid comes up and
[1:10:40] say you daddy you told
[1:10:44] me you
[1:10:45] know that you'd do
[1:10:50] that well we're as human sometimes we
[1:10:53] can't do it maybe but we should tell
[1:10:55] them so well we can't do it so but you
[1:10:56] told me you do it that's the way my kids
[1:10:58] always done me right they just come to
[1:11:01] me and they said daddy you told me we
[1:11:02] was going to do this are we going to do
[1:11:04] it or not they don't forget not no
[1:11:07] problems yeah well especially grandkids
[1:11:10] now they're they're they're in a greater
[1:11:12] higher category and Welly they can
[1:11:13] really get to you they don't even have
[1:11:15] to remind you of what you said yeah they
[1:11:18] just look at
[1:11:20] you and you just go do it come on do
[1:11:22] your granddaddies and everything else
[1:11:25] but you
[1:11:26] know my whole point is one
[1:11:30] thing a man with the word of God did
[1:11:34] brother Brandon make this
[1:11:36] statement he said a
[1:11:39] Believer with the word of God in his
[1:11:41] heart speaks that by
[1:11:45] faith he said it's deity speaking yes he
[1:11:49] yes he see it was Christ in Moses it was
[1:11:52] Christ in Joshua
[1:11:54] yeah it was Christ in brother
[1:11:57] brandham now I don't want to raise a
[1:11:59] hands cuz I don't do that but how many
[1:12:02] of us needed the grace of marriage and
[1:12:03] divorce
[1:12:08] amen have you ever noticed brother
[1:12:10] brandham said I say unto you
[1:12:14] right right said from what God showed me
[1:12:16] up right in that mountain you go back
[1:12:19] and you see Moses had a
[1:12:21] Grace you go back and you find out
[1:12:24] that Paul had a
[1:12:28] Grace at the words of a
[1:12:30] man we stand
[1:12:34] today at the words of a man that came
[1:12:37] that God Vindicated to to be the prophet
[1:12:39] of the hour that's why we don't look for
[1:12:41] another one
[1:12:42] right because there may be great
[1:12:44] anointings out there but they don't have
[1:12:47] a message right brother see you're right
[1:12:51] they don't have a message pointing you
[1:12:52] back to God they have a message pointing
[1:12:54] to their billfold and their own
[1:12:57] things
[1:12:59] but at the words of a
[1:13:03] man we stand on that every day
[1:13:07] yes I wasn't there when brother Brandon
[1:13:10] spoke squirrels was
[1:13:12] you I believe it
[1:13:15] happened why because of the message he
[1:13:19] preached would tell me that can be done
[1:13:22] that's right yeah
[1:13:23] that's right I wasn't there when Moses
[1:13:26] crossed the Red
[1:13:29] Sea now I know I we got the quotes
[1:13:31] brother R said I was back there with it
[1:13:33] you know what I'm talking about but you
[1:13:34] know what I'm saying you and I wasn't
[1:13:36] back there physically to walk across
[1:13:38] right I believe it happened am the
[1:13:42] reason I believe it
[1:13:44] happened is because just like brother
[1:13:46] brandham when he was preaching one day
[1:13:48] and he was bringing that out about
[1:13:50] Joshua you know and his son stood still
[1:13:52] and he said I'd love to
[1:13:54] have all afternoon he said or something
[1:13:57] to speak on and God Stood
[1:14:01] Still you know son stood
[1:14:05] still and he'd say look at
[1:14:10] uh the little woman with
[1:14:14] problems and she touched His
[1:14:17] Garment and said the son stood
[1:14:21] still see what about all those places in
[1:14:24] there where that God would step on the
[1:14:28] scene and to prove that he was God what
[1:14:30] about the The Prostitute that was
[1:14:33] brought before
[1:14:35] him and they said now the Bible says in
[1:14:38] other words to us the law says she's to
[1:14:41] be stoned what is your
[1:14:45] judgment he couldn't say I forgive
[1:14:49] her that would have been contrary to his
[1:14:51] own word so he couldn't do
[1:14:57] it but he knew how to take care of
[1:15:00] it yes he right so what'd he do he knew
[1:15:05] under the law if you had two or three
[1:15:06] Witnesses you'd Stone the person to
[1:15:08] death right
[1:15:10] right they just got rid of the
[1:15:14] witnesses right that's what he done he's
[1:15:17] got rid of the witnesses he just
[1:15:19] condemned them of what they were doing
[1:15:21] that's right they all walked away yeah
[1:15:23] he said who condemns you she said I
[1:15:26] don't have no condem he said neither do
[1:15:28] I go and sin no more that's
[1:15:32] right why because I believe Jesus was a
[1:15:37] man yes the
[1:15:40] flesh but in that flesh was almighty
[1:15:44] God am not the doctrines that's going
[1:15:47] today and that's all right that's their
[1:15:48] doctrines I got a i the other day I was
[1:15:50] down in the
[1:15:51] woods and I was reading on anointed once
[1:15:53] at the end time I don't see a lot of
[1:15:56] deer but I get to do a lot of reading
[1:15:57] huh but or listen to tapes cuz I got an
[1:16:01] iPod and I just stick it in I went
[1:16:02] through three tapes sitting there on
[1:16:03] this deer stand you know just listen to
[1:16:05] brother Brown my house slept through
[1:16:06] half of them and you know but I was
[1:16:10] reading on anointed once the end time
[1:16:11] you know and it really struck
[1:16:13] me he said those people can't help
[1:16:17] it don't throw off on somebody that
[1:16:19] doesn't believe like you believe cuz you
[1:16:21] know what they can't it that's right
[1:16:24] they've heard the words of a man in the
[1:16:26] wrong direction
[1:16:28] right they've listened to man Express
[1:16:32] things and they've went after the wrong
[1:16:35] thing but you know they can't help it
[1:16:37] right that's not going to save them not
[1:16:39] going to do it but I pray that God will
[1:16:42] be lenient yes you know yes because
[1:16:46] they're wonderful
[1:16:47] people but they're caught by man's
[1:16:50] ideas but my point was what
[1:16:53] what atonement did Moses give it was his
[1:16:58] word right he reminded God of his word
[1:17:03] yes yes marriage and
[1:17:07] divorce brother Randon spoke to us and
[1:17:10] he said I
[1:17:14] say well you know what you may not need
[1:17:18] the natural Grace of marriage and
[1:17:22] divorce but there's not a person in the
[1:17:24] world that didn't need the spiritual
[1:17:25] Grace
[1:17:27] right you may differ with me on that
[1:17:29] that's all right but even brother
[1:17:31] brandham carried a Baptist Bible and
[1:17:33] converted them to a Baptist
[1:17:35] Faith that's what he
[1:17:38] said we all need the grace of marriage
[1:17:40] and divorce have you ever thanked God
[1:17:42] have you ever repented for being in a
[1:17:44] denomination sometime you ever done
[1:17:48] that no the Holy Ghost led me out well
[1:17:51] okay have you ever thanked him for
[1:17:52] leading
[1:17:55] out have you ever just said
[1:17:58] Lord I was sincere there and I was I was
[1:18:02] 23 years old I was an ordained
[1:18:04] Deacon when I left the
[1:18:06] church I was teaching the adult Sunday
[1:18:08] school T the deacons and Elders that's
[1:18:10] what I was doing when I left they
[1:18:13] thought the world of
[1:18:15] me but you
[1:18:16] see when this message came I I couldn't
[1:18:20] do nothing but move I got up and told
[1:18:22] him in the church I got them told
[1:18:24] everybody I said I'm sorry I can't stay
[1:18:27] here I've got to move on yeah my brother
[1:18:31] came out and he said any minute he said
[1:18:33] what you going to do I said I don't know
[1:18:34] he said are you a preacher I said Heaven
[1:18:36] Help I surely don't know about
[1:18:38] that and uh he said well just stay and
[1:18:41] we'll build you a church and he meant
[1:18:44] it said we'll build you a
[1:18:47] church and my family would fill this
[1:18:50] church
[1:18:51] up my
[1:18:53] family would fill it up all right cuz
[1:18:56] I'm the baby of
[1:18:58] 13 right four died real early but n
[1:19:01] lived on got a big family all right but
[1:19:05] my point of what I'm saying I couldn't
[1:19:07] help
[1:19:08] it
[1:19:10] right couldn't help it friend of mine
[1:19:13] was speaking there not too long ago in
[1:19:15] the church where were used to go and I
[1:19:18] went to hear
[1:19:21] him I have no problem
[1:19:23] right I don't figure I backslid cuz I
[1:19:26] went back there I went to hear the man
[1:19:29] and encouraged him you know young kid
[1:19:31] coming
[1:19:33] up but you see the point of where I'm
[1:19:35] trying to
[1:19:37] get whether you like it or not you can
[1:19:39] say oh it's the Holy Ghost it's
[1:19:41] this you're you're built on the words of
[1:19:44] a
[1:19:46] man whether it be that or whether it be
[1:19:49] the quotes of a
[1:19:51] prophet
[1:19:54] and I sure like the atonement that the
[1:19:56] prophet made I may not have needed the
[1:20:00] natural but I surely needed the
[1:20:03] spiritual I made this statement I said
[1:20:06] Lord you've got me out of the Baptist
[1:20:08] now get the Baptist out of
[1:20:10] me you ever done that just say thank you
[1:20:13] Lord thank you for saving me there's not
[1:20:16] a day PES that I don't pray Lord thank
[1:20:18] you for saving me
[1:20:20] yes thank you for delivering BR
[1:20:24] me thank you for bringing me into the
[1:20:28] word at the words of a
[1:20:32] man I stood one day in a
[1:20:36] church told him I said
[1:20:38] Wade is
[1:20:41] backslid but he will come
[1:20:46] back I said leave what you want to Lord
[1:20:49] told
[1:20:51] me all right told my wife something one
[1:20:54] day I said that'll take place or I'll
[1:20:55] quit preaching she said well you just
[1:20:56] preached your last
[1:20:58] sermon she was
[1:21:01] honest she said you just preached your
[1:21:03] last sermon I said well okay but you
[1:21:07] know what happened but I'm just getting
[1:21:10] a
[1:21:12] point I come to my wife after Wade come
[1:21:14] back to the Lord before he came back I
[1:21:18] come to wife I said now
[1:21:21] this's uh little more been added to the
[1:21:23] story he said okay I said he's not only
[1:21:27] going to be coming back to the Lord but
[1:21:29] he's going to be preaching with
[1:21:32] me she said well okay you know well he's
[1:21:37] preaching with
[1:21:39] me my point is this we think that the
[1:21:43] word comes to the prophet now we know
[1:21:44] that I've established that established
[1:21:46] who it is is Christ and what's taking
[1:21:48] place right all right so you shouldn't
[1:21:50] have any open part or any problem with
[1:21:52] these
[1:21:53] statements but brother Brandon when we
[1:21:55] read one of those he said and he's still
[1:21:57] the same yesterday today and
[1:21:59] forever you know he's still using men to
[1:22:02] speak to us he's using a five-fold
[1:22:05] Ministry the Bible does not say that the
[1:22:07] prophet was made for the perfecting of
[1:22:09] the Saints it says a five-fold Ministry
[1:22:12] but now if that Pro if that five-fold
[1:22:14] Ministry Don't Preach what that Prophet
[1:22:15] said they're not a five-fold Ministry
[1:22:17] forget it you know that brother around
[1:22:19] said the five-fold ministry is
[1:22:20] predestinated eternally yes sir
[1:22:23] he said but the nine spiritual gifts in
[1:22:24] the church is
[1:22:27] not gifts and calling without repentance
[1:22:29] but he said the five full ministry cuz
[1:22:30] really see that's
[1:22:32] God we're built on the words of a
[1:22:35] man you know that sometimes brother Jim
[1:22:38] has to say something that probably if a
[1:22:42] lot of you heard it you wouldn't agree
[1:22:43] with
[1:22:45] him you'd probably condemn
[1:22:50] him but
[1:22:53] sometimes we ministers have to say
[1:22:58] things sometimes we have to speak
[1:23:01] things well I don't believe that brother
[1:23:03] Brandon was the only one that could
[1:23:05] speak the word I believe he come to
[1:23:07] bring a bride to the position they could
[1:23:09] speak the word
[1:23:11] absolutely well why can't you speak it
[1:23:13] for your family you got a child you got
[1:23:15] loved ones you got a husband or wife or
[1:23:17] whatever just out speak the word for
[1:23:19] them and say it and keep saying it till
[1:23:23] it comes to
[1:23:25] P cuz if you say it for a while and then
[1:23:27] say well I really don't know so you
[1:23:28] never did have it right to start with it
[1:23:30] wouldn't God but if you keep speaking it
[1:23:32] and it'll finally come to pass it be God
[1:23:34] that's the way I believe God I still
[1:23:35] believe he's speaking through a
[1:23:36] five-fold
[1:23:37] Ministry for the perfecting of the
[1:23:43] Saints see the words of a
[1:23:46] man and you know
[1:23:49] sisters now we we don't believe in women
[1:23:51] preachers right
[1:23:53] okay but brother R said you got your own
[1:23:55] pull pit at home with your
[1:23:59] children and see it's not just the words
[1:24:01] of a m n masculine you
[1:24:04] know that's why I read that in
[1:24:08] Hebrews he says what in this day he has
[1:24:12] spoken unto us through his
[1:24:16] son so it's the son in you that's why
[1:24:19] women preachers you know they say it a
[1:24:20] lot of times they say well I've got god
[1:24:21] in me I got a man in me why can't I
[1:24:23] preach well we know that's not correct
[1:24:25] but but you do have God in
[1:24:27] You Preach to your pull pit at home
[1:24:30] right right you claim your children this
[1:24:33] is not just made for a man to have to
[1:24:35] speak it well I'll wait till brother Jim
[1:24:37] speaks
[1:24:38] it who was it which Revival was it was
[1:24:41] started and they check back to find out
[1:24:43] that it was the lady that cllean the
[1:24:45] church and she would just doing the pews
[1:24:47] you know and she' just cleaning it and
[1:24:49] she'd say the brother sits here Lord
[1:24:50] bless you and sister sits here and cause
[1:24:53] Revival to come in a
[1:24:57] church the words of a
[1:25:01] man and you know what now I'm going to
[1:25:04] end it by saying this to make you
[1:25:08] understand it was Christ in Moses you
[1:25:10] agree Christ in David Joshua etc
[1:25:15] etc but now if I cross a Doctrine I'm
[1:25:18] sorry I'm just I say just just this way
[1:25:22] none of those in the Old Testament had
[1:25:23] eternal life by the new birth
[1:25:26] right right right there was no new birth
[1:25:30] cuz the Bible said Jesus had not been
[1:25:31] glorified and the Holy Ghost couldn't
[1:25:33] come until till Jesus came and released
[1:25:35] that life to come back to give us a new
[1:25:37] birth that's why you got an Old
[1:25:38] Testament and New Testament okay
[1:25:40] simple now under the blood of bulls and
[1:25:43] goats listen to brother
[1:25:45] brandom if they could speak flies fleas
[1:25:47] and
[1:25:49] frogs he said why would you st stumble
[1:25:53] at squirrels under the blood of Jesus
[1:25:55] Christ that's it yeah absolutely so I
[1:25:57] believe he spoke them squirrels into
[1:25:59] existence absolutely yes
[1:26:01] sir yes sir I believe he come to bring
[1:26:04] me the word yes he this is my Bible it
[1:26:08] was give to me but this is my Bible
[1:26:10] don't belong to
[1:26:12] you this is my
[1:26:14] Bible this is my message you know
[1:26:17] holding up brother brandom's
[1:26:20] quotes I can't say it belong to you cuz
[1:26:23] it's
[1:26:25] mine there's just one God and he's
[1:26:29] mine but see you got to say that
[1:26:32] now there's just one God and he's mine
[1:26:35] cuz see you don't know whether I have
[1:26:37] God or not right
[1:26:40] right at the words of a man yes sir we
[1:26:45] put our whole
[1:26:47] life I mean what if it came along now
[1:26:50] they've tried to do it you know they
[1:26:51] tried to prove that brother Brandon was
[1:26:53] illegally hunting out there in Arizona
[1:26:56] did that stumble
[1:26:59] you you know what if they come up now
[1:27:02] and they put out a Doctrine and put
[1:27:03] pictures up and showed brother brandham
[1:27:05] and he was standing there and he had 14
[1:27:07] women lined up down through
[1:27:10] there and said all of them was his
[1:27:13] wives what would you
[1:27:18] do see we natur said no that can't be
[1:27:20] well sure that we know that's right said
[1:27:22] it couldn't
[1:27:24] be but even if it
[1:27:26] was he brought me to an understanding of
[1:27:31] God's word amen I would Glory no matter
[1:27:34] what anybody would say about him I would
[1:27:38] glory in the word that he's brought
[1:27:41] me the words of a
[1:27:44] man that we stand
[1:27:47] on what do you think about
[1:27:51] it you got to depend on
[1:27:54] somebody brother here is probably the
[1:27:56] oldest what are you about
[1:28:02] 65 you know what he got to depend on
[1:28:06] somebody
[1:28:09] right that was the old riddle of the
[1:28:11] Spinks many of you in school ever was
[1:28:13] Tau that and I tell that to people and
[1:28:14] they say where'd you go to school the
[1:28:16] old riddle of the
[1:28:17] Spinks what starts off in you know four
[1:28:21] legs wind up two legs and wind end on
[1:28:25] three and you had to Solve the
[1:28:27] Riddle this man he starts off crawling
[1:28:31] four legs he stands walking up end of it
[1:28:34] he's got a walking stick he's got three
[1:28:36] legs that soled a riddle it was called a
[1:28:39] riddle of the
[1:28:40] Spinx you see
[1:28:43] Church we're dependent upon what
[1:28:46] somebody says yes pray for your
[1:28:51] pastor because now if you're going to
[1:28:52] stay here and he's going to be your
[1:28:54] pastor he's your link to
[1:28:58] God no bless God I depend on all right
[1:29:01] see you're not in the you're not in the
[1:29:03] field I'm talking about if you're going
[1:29:04] to say bless God I got my own Holy Ghost
[1:29:07] and it'll lead me and I ain't depending
[1:29:09] on nobody we'll go
[1:29:12] home you're a hindrance that's what I
[1:29:14] tell them at church don't come you're
[1:29:16] going to have a Doctrine like that
[1:29:18] you're a hindrance to me and I'm a
[1:29:19] hindrance to
[1:29:20] you but we move on with God yes and we
[1:29:24] depend upon the five-fold ministry amen
[1:29:28] true for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:29:31] right
[1:29:32] yes because they're predestinated Amen
[1:29:36] to that
[1:29:37] gift brother Jim has one gift I have
[1:29:39] another brother Tommy has another we're
[1:29:42] not all the
[1:29:45] same I wish I could have a gift at these
[1:29:47] brothers has are remembering names I
[1:29:49] finally got to remember
[1:29:50] Tommy
[1:29:52] heard it 10 times last night I said one
[1:29:54] of these days I'll remember
[1:29:59] that see that's why I love the Lord CU
[1:30:01] he's that
[1:30:02] man that's leading all of
[1:30:05] us and all of our honor and Glory goes
[1:30:07] to him come on brother J the man Christ
[1:30:14] Jesus that was back there and could
[1:30:17] speak now he's here and can speak
[1:30:20] through you
[1:30:23] wonderful day isn't it
[1:30:28] amen praise the
[1:30:31] Lord only thing wrong with that it was
[1:30:33] too
[1:30:36] short but I got enough to finish it
[1:30:40] up I'm just kidding oh the Lord has
[1:30:43] spoken this morning and uh it's not the
[1:30:47] amount of words that's spoken it's the
[1:30:50] value of that which is spoken and what
[1:30:52] we receive like the naturopathic doctors
[1:30:55] will tell you it's not actually how many
[1:30:57] vitamins you take is what you can
[1:30:59] metabolize it's not how many books you
[1:31:02] read or how many tapes you hear I mean
[1:31:04] those things are good but there's not
[1:31:07] necessarily more grace that's ministered
[1:31:08] because of that but it's how much you
[1:31:10] retain it's how much you that actually
[1:31:13] you metabolize spiritually that causes a
[1:31:16] uh causes growth amen and that's what
[1:31:19] the word is to do we're not going to
[1:31:20] measure it physic physically you know
[1:31:22] day in day out day in day
[1:31:25] out but we know now that there's a
[1:31:27] restored Eden that's begun and we've
[1:31:28] been invited back into the Garden of
[1:31:30] Eden to eat from the Tree of Life we
[1:31:32] know there's a change taking place what
[1:31:34] Adam failed to get now the bride in this
[1:31:36] hour absolutely sidesteps the grave
[1:31:39] cheats death and continues to eat word
[1:31:42] upon word upon word upon word and it'll
[1:31:45] change us into his glorious image I
[1:31:48] believe it was David that asked the
[1:31:49] question in Psalms 8:4
[1:31:53] he said uh he said when I consider the
[1:31:56] stars and the heavens I can just picture
[1:31:58] David just gazing
[1:31:59] out under uh under a Starlet night and
[1:32:04] he said Lord what is man that thou art
[1:32:06] mindful of him what is man what is man
[1:32:09] what's his value what's his
[1:32:11] worth well our brother helped us to
[1:32:14] understand David's Dilemma not
[1:32:16] necessarily a dilemma but he's asking
[1:32:18] the question man brother B says God's
[1:32:20] agent he said he could have chose the
[1:32:22] trees to preach that would have been a
[1:32:23] sight wouldn't it we could have been if
[1:32:25] God had chose a tree we could have been
[1:32:26] sitting out on an NA tream
[1:32:28] today or either brought the elm tree in
[1:32:31] here or whatever but we would be
[1:32:32] adjusted to it if that's what God I mean
[1:32:34] that's God calls us to believe some of
[1:32:36] the strangest things sometimes but
[1:32:38] that's what separates us from from
[1:32:40] everybody
[1:32:41] else but David said and I like his
[1:32:44] answer here when the Lord apparently
[1:32:46] responded back he says Thou H has made
[1:32:48] him a little lower than the angels has
[1:32:49] crowned him with Glory and Honor has
[1:32:51] made made him to have dominion over the
[1:32:52] works of thy hands and has put all
[1:32:54] things under his feet now what he told
[1:32:56] us in Genesis gave us dominion over
[1:32:58] everything all the sheep and The Oxen
[1:33:00] and all the Beast of the field the foul
[1:33:02] of the air the fish of the sea
[1:33:03] whatsoever passes through the past of
[1:33:04] the sea oh Lord Our God how excellent is
[1:33:07] thy name in all the
[1:33:09] Earth David found so many different ways
[1:33:12] and reasons to worship and praise our
[1:33:14] God didn't he there's always something
[1:33:16] to to praise him thank God thank God
[1:33:21] thank God
[1:33:22] I heard a brother was finishing up and
[1:33:24] and I normally don't do this well we got
[1:33:25] a few few minutes I I normally we just
[1:33:27] was finished but
[1:33:28] if I know if we get out too early you
[1:33:31] know there's kind of a fine line this is
[1:33:32] kind of a gray area we get out too early
[1:33:33] well well you know what we going to do
[1:33:35] now the Baptist already beat us to the
[1:33:37] buffet
[1:33:39] so but just so just some thoughts I'll
[1:33:42] just it just just uh just take a minute
[1:33:45] I was listening to Terry Fox this
[1:33:46] morning I knew I wasn't having to preach
[1:33:48] and I was looking at the newspaper and
[1:33:49] listen on Terry Fox I remember Terry Fox
[1:33:50] I know brother Chad's a big fan of Terry
[1:33:52] Fox well after you heard what Terry Fox
[1:33:54] Said Today he was talking about election
[1:33:56] predestination choosing and everything
[1:33:57] he says I submit to you congregation us
[1:34:00] a Doctrine from the pits of
[1:34:02] Hell well Terry just he fell to the
[1:34:05] bottom of my list of
[1:34:07] preachers because he was given an
[1:34:09] invitation whosoever will whosoever will
[1:34:12] and he said all the people say well God
[1:34:14] elected somebody and God's chose
[1:34:15] somebody said that's the doctrine from
[1:34:16] the pits of hell but you know you just
[1:34:18] you feel sorry for people like that
[1:34:20] because you have once you deny election
[1:34:22] Jesus said John 15:16 he said you hadn't
[1:34:24] chosen me I've chosen you what are you
[1:34:25] going to do with that said I'm the one
[1:34:26] that put your name on the Lamb's Book of
[1:34:28] Life for the foundation of the world I'm
[1:34:30] thinking if Cain was in his in his
[1:34:32] service I wonder Esau I wonder if he
[1:34:33] could have convinced them that they
[1:34:34] could have been saved it had been
[1:34:38] hard it have been
[1:34:40] hard either boy both boys not having
[1:34:43] done good or evil God said I've chosen
[1:34:45] one I've rejected the other I've given
[1:34:47] Grace to one giv grace to the other I
[1:34:49] say this because it helps me to
[1:34:50] appreciate
[1:34:52] it helps me to appreciate the love of
[1:34:53] God the word of God and the fact that
[1:34:55] God has chosen us and as the brother was
[1:34:57] getting getting to and in so many
[1:34:59] directions you go now brother bam made
[1:35:00] the statement he said he talking about
[1:35:02] questions anwers 1964 he said uh he said
[1:35:06] you know the king and the queen how the
[1:35:07] queen will serve the king he said the
[1:35:08] wife will serve the husband by
[1:35:10] ministering him food and he said now
[1:35:12] that's a relationship we enter into now
[1:35:14] in this hour where the Queen of Heaven
[1:35:16] the bride ministers that food to her
[1:35:17] husband we got to take that word that we
[1:35:20] hear from man we take right back to the
[1:35:22] word we find it's right it's wrong like
[1:35:24] you said examine it and so forth examine
[1:35:26] these things that we hear if it's right
[1:35:29] we adopted as a part of our own uh
[1:35:31] spiritual growth and we believe it and
[1:35:34] we testify it and we confess it and so
[1:35:36] forth and Minister it back to God Jesus
[1:35:39] is the one that said in Matthew chapter
[1:35:41] 18 and verse 18 He said uh how did he
[1:35:45] say it he said uh whatsoever you bind on
[1:35:48] Earth I'll bind in heaven he said what
[1:35:51] whatsoever you loose on Earth I'll loose
[1:35:53] in heaven he's pointing back to the man
[1:35:55] now cuz David said what is man it's a
[1:35:58] man who's actually crowned with honor
[1:36:00] and Glory from God so God deposits that
[1:36:02] word in his heart to what to speak it
[1:36:04] out David said I have seen therefore I
[1:36:06] have spoken say I have heard but now I
[1:36:09] see and what's the last part of that now
[1:36:11] I speak that back out and that's why
[1:36:13] we're called to be Witnesses and we
[1:36:14] testify of what God has done and that's
[1:36:17] how the word gets from generation to
[1:36:18] generation to generation to generation
[1:36:20] God established that all through the law
[1:36:21] teach it to your children and your
[1:36:23] children's children your children's
[1:36:24] children then and and write on down and
[1:36:26] write on down and that's why we have it
[1:36:28] in such volume today in such Clarity
[1:36:30] today because it's uh continued to be to
[1:36:33] be preached bride ministering the word
[1:36:36] to husb brother man said oh I said
[1:36:37] something then it just come fresh you
[1:36:39] said something he said but you didn't
[1:36:40] get it he said but there's going to
[1:36:42] people there'll be a people rise up and
[1:36:44] they'll absolutely get it thinking of
[1:36:46] another statement he made on page 50 of
[1:36:48] souls in prison he said when the word
[1:36:50] comes to the Prophet we know that God's
[1:36:52] ordained it he says but now now that
[1:36:55] last prophet is off the scene he said
[1:36:56] now the word comes to the individual to
[1:36:59] the bride the elect and he said they
[1:37:01] become now the word to the
[1:37:03] people God's entrusting his word in
[1:37:06] human vessels in Earth and vessels where
[1:37:09] the will of God is he prayed not my will
[1:37:12] but thine be done he told us to he
[1:37:14] taught us to pray in Luke 11 he said he
[1:37:17] said Our Father which art in heaven
[1:37:18] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:37:19] thy will be done in earth in Earth Earth
[1:37:21] in
[1:37:22] vessels this is where God's this is the
[1:37:24] final resting place of God's word is to
[1:37:27] develop us into the very image of God
[1:37:30] himself we become living Epistles
[1:37:32] written Epistles known in R of all
[1:37:35] men amen that's a good word today I
[1:37:37] enjoyed that I enjoyed that I'll be
[1:37:40] munching on that for a while we're sheep
[1:37:43] we're of the ruminant family how many
[1:37:44] knows what a rumin it is you see a cheap
[1:37:47] always R they always
[1:37:49] ruminating or they got four stomachs see
[1:37:51] they just they they eat it down it comes
[1:37:53] back up eat it down comes back up it's a
[1:37:54] type of meditation meditate on these
[1:37:57] things David said day and night when you
[1:37:58] get up commune with your heart meditate
[1:38:00] on these things and there's where it
[1:38:01] becomes strength because you get into
[1:38:03] that fourth stomach which is called the
[1:38:05] abomasum you get into that fourth
[1:38:06] stomach and that's where it becomes meat
[1:38:08] actually to them not here just hearing
[1:38:11] it in the first realm and so forth and
[1:38:12] just kind of processing in our mind but
[1:38:15] when we meditate on those things
[1:38:17] meditate on those things meditate on
[1:38:18] those things that's become that's where
[1:38:19] it becomes reality that's where it
[1:38:20] becomes life
[1:38:22] to us amen whosoever sends you retain
[1:38:25] remember as Jesus blessed them and so
[1:38:27] forth at Bethany and what he tell him he
[1:38:29] said whosoever sins you retain he said
[1:38:32] they'll be retained and whoever sins you
[1:38:33] remit you remit talking to people said
[1:38:36] and also he said whatsoever if any two
[1:38:38] of you will agree or touch two or three
[1:38:40] will agree is touch anything on Earth
[1:38:42] that they shall ask he said it shall be
[1:38:44] done they that you ask shall be done of
[1:38:46] my heavenly
[1:38:47] father amen God entrust man to to
[1:38:51] deliver his word to receive his word and
[1:38:54] to preach his word to believe his word
[1:38:56] and that's what's going to change us
[1:38:57] friend that's God's order that's God's
[1:39:00] contract that's God's covenant with us
