[0:00] oh
[0:27] because that's what we're here for
[0:29] but joe gave me something i thought was
[0:30] very interesting and i'll just
[0:33] read it to you one of the musicians are
[0:35] going back
[0:38] it says if you have food in your fridge
[0:41] clothes on your back
[0:43] a roof over your head
[0:45] and a place to sleep
[0:47] you are richer than 75 of the world
[0:53] if you have money in the bank
[0:56] your wallet
[0:58] and some spare change
[1:00] you're among the top eight percent of
[1:02] the world's wealthy
[1:05] now see that's not on the downside that
[1:08] means it's wearing that
[1:10] if you woke up this morning with more
[1:12] help than illness
[1:14] you are more blessed than the million
[1:16] people who will not survive this week
[1:21] if you have never experienced the danger
[1:23] of battle or the agony of imprisonment
[1:25] or torture
[1:26] or horrible pains of starvation you are
[1:29] luckier than 50 million people alive and
[1:32] suffering
[1:34] if you can read this message
[1:37] you're more fortunate than three billion
[1:39] people in the world
[1:41] who cannot read it all
[1:44] seven billion people in the world and
[1:46] three billion people can't even read
[1:48] that's something
[1:50] amen good to see everyone in the house

[5:21] and that way the children can come up
[5:24] and go to the bathroom and everything
[5:27] and they will be uh just they bring them
[5:29] up to the bathrooms and everything so
[5:31] your children will be brought up to here
[5:33] and you they will be you know the
[5:36] classes will be sent to the bathroom and

[5:43] school some of you going to the bathroom
[5:45] you know
[5:46] when you come up so that'll put a little
[5:48] bit of a different
[5:49] uh different situation and all and i
[5:52] said then that's going to mean that some
[5:54] of your parents are going to have to get
[5:56] here a little bit earlier
[5:59] so sometimes some of you get here
[6:01] uh five after
[6:04] now
[6:04] i'm just honest and i'm not mean but
[6:07] just
[6:08] hateful
[6:10] okay
[6:12] there's a difference in the word you
[6:14] know but
[6:16] you don't do that to your work
[6:20] all right this is more important than
[6:22] your work
[6:23] and see then that's what i said you
[6:25] don't come in downstairs
[6:27] and and causing a lot of confusion over
[6:29] in the other side
[6:31] there while uh
[6:32] you know while the sunday school classes
[6:35] is going on
[6:36] you know and all like that because we
[6:38] will if necessary we will assign a
[6:40] deacon to make sure that you come in
[6:43] and all and we should be in here i've
[6:45] never been one to worry that you've got
[6:47] to do right now
[6:48] but we should at least be in here
[6:51] 15 minutes before service starts 30
[6:54] minutes is better
[6:55] but that's hard i'm honest you travel a
[6:57] long ways and and i try to be as nice as
[7:00] i can about that but we need to be here
[7:02] 15 minutes early come in the services
[7:04] and sit down and praying and listening
[7:07] to the music you know being played then
[7:09] the the
[7:10] live music will start 10 minutes before
[7:12] the service time and that will give you
[7:15] time to relax a little bit and get
[7:17] everything in the way you know straight
[7:20] so is everybody understand that
[7:23] starting this afternoon from then on
[7:26] 10 minutes before
[7:28] the music will start of the piano
[7:30] playing you know in the musical
[7:32] instruments playing
[7:33] of live music and not singing with them
[7:36] just you know letting them play and
[7:38] letting it be a a
[7:40] time
[7:41] and then we'll have that from now on on
[7:43] that services and then the sunday school
[7:46] class will be starting 10 minutes
[7:48] earlier sister monica's now consistent
[7:50] rachel's now don't come up to tomorrow

[8:02] it's for those two classes only to where
[8:05] we can get the children upstairs
[8:07] to be able to
[8:09] do away with a little confusion out at
[8:11] the front so everybody understand
[8:13] okay all right then that'll
[8:15] that'll take care of that so i i've got
[8:17] myself notes to write down here to do
[8:20] but you know that we
[8:22] we had a good time yesterday at the
[8:24] bible study we've just finished up on
[8:27] all the officers of the church

[8:32] of the church and we will be back on
[8:34] regular

[10:15] to stand complete in you and to guide us
[10:17] in your love guide us now as we read and
[10:20] have your way in jesus name
[10:22] amen
[10:24] revelations what are we using this is
[10:26] just the basis for the
[10:28] the part that we're in but we're in
[10:30] revelations one
[10:32] 1-3 and the revelation of jesus christ
[10:35] which god gave unto him
[10:37] to show it to his servants things which
[10:38] must shortly come to pass
[10:40] and sitting sent and signified by his
[10:43] angel and to his servant john
[10:45] who bear record of the word of god and
[10:46] the testimony of jesus christ and of all
[10:49] things that he saw
[10:52] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[10:53] hear the words
[10:54] of this prophecy and keep those things
[10:57] which are written therein for the time
[11:00] is at hand you may be seated as a little
[11:03] daddy's blessing to the
[11:05] reading of the word
[11:07] now remember we were covering
[11:09] the other day if i have time i'll get
[11:11] back into the end of the message one but
[11:14] we were covering how the word
[11:16] prophecy
[11:18] it's a setting in order of scriptures
[11:22] you know in the book of revelation then
[11:24] would be the summation
[11:26] of all of the things and bringing it
[11:28] down to a basis of setting everything in
[11:31] order
[11:32] and bringing it to that place and i
[11:34] noticed it when i was looking up
[11:36] studying on this a little
[11:38] uh this morning that
[11:40] it says three times the testimony of
[11:43] jesus it says uh excuse the testimony of
[11:46] jesus christ that we just read here and
[11:48] then it says one time the testimony of
[11:50] jesus
[11:51] and uh
[11:52] then that's the spirit of prophecy the
[11:56] testimony of jesus revelation 19 i
[11:58] believe says it's the spirit of prophecy
[12:01] and see that's sitting in order of
[12:03] scripture so our we're looking at the
[12:05] book of revelations
[12:07] not as an addition to any of the writing
[12:10] you know we're adding to the bible or
[12:12] anything but looking at it as the the
[12:14] one that is is prevalent or most
[12:17] important for
[12:19] our day
[12:20] because it's going to show us who we are
[12:24] and what we're doing here in the book of
[12:26] revelation the one that we were told to
[12:28] stay away from now satan doesn't want us
[12:30] to to read the book of revelation and to
[12:33] understand it
[12:34] so then he attacks that and says you
[12:37] can't understand it well by way of the
[12:39] prophet's message we can understand the
[12:41] things that are said and don't have to
[12:44] worry about it see we know what he said
[12:46] these things mean and like i said if you
[12:48] want to know what they mean you take my
[12:50] bible and read the side of it
[12:53] because i write down what he says these
[12:55] things are
[12:57] and everything because i want to keep up
[12:59] with it myself all right
[13:01] now
[13:03] but it's a revelation
[13:06] of jesus christ that we read
[13:09] that god gave
[13:11] to jesus
[13:13] all right
[13:14] to give to john
[13:17] now when you say but yeah but jesus was
[13:19] god how is it that he didn't understand
[13:22] when you have god in you
[13:25] how it is that you don't understand
[13:26] everything
[13:27] right
[13:28] but see
[13:29] he knew everything but he didn't know
[13:31] about his coming right
[13:34] that was withholding from him
[13:36] and the fact of what was going to be the
[13:39] future
[13:40] in the church
[13:42] you know the future part of the church
[13:44] all right
[13:45] was withholding from him
[13:47] and here
[13:50] when he comes to patmos
[13:53] he has went through the death burial
[13:55] resurrection
[13:57] you know ascension
[13:59] and then receives the prophet said from
[14:01] the father
[14:02] of the future
[14:04] of what would be
[14:06] all right
[14:07] and see then it when it does then
[14:10] he can see the book of revelations that
[14:12] i've tried to say to you
[14:15] it is the one book written directly to
[14:18] you and i
[14:20] the others would be written to the
[14:21] ephesians
[14:23] which means it's to us because you know
[14:26] it's in the book
[14:27] but it was written to the corinthians
[14:31] all right
[14:32] but see the book of revelation is
[14:34] written to you and i yes
[14:36] all right
[14:37] it's our book
[14:39] it's the most important book that we
[14:40] could think about because it shows the
[14:44] christ
[14:45] the present
[14:46] and the future
[14:48] all right
[14:49] and it shows those things and brings in
[14:51] the light
[14:53] the the opening of the entire world
[14:57] so then whatever
[14:59] would not be comprehended
[15:02] now listen to this point
[15:04] but around my statement one time he said
[15:08] if you miss it in the seals and things
[15:10] he said come back to christ's mystery
[15:14] and this is worse he said come back to
[15:15] this message christ the mystery
[15:18] see then that would explain the seals
[15:20] and things
[15:21] into that order all right now so if you
[15:24] don't understand what is in
[15:26] you know this is going to be reversed to
[15:28] what mankind thinks
[15:30] but if you don't understand what's in
[15:31] ephesians
[15:34] are you listening
[15:36] go to the book of revelation that's
[15:38] right
[15:42] now pause for that to be thought about
[15:45] and the emphasis is what
[15:48] you don't understand the seals
[15:50] you didn't say you had to go back and
[15:51] stay in the seals and keep reading what
[15:52] you need to do what do you say come to
[15:55] the christ the mystery
[15:57] right
[15:58] because that would help you understand
[16:00] those things all right so if we don't
[16:03] understand the
[16:04] godhead
[16:07] of john where it says god is a spirit
[16:12] then go to the book of revelations
[16:16] and it will explain that to us
[16:19] it'll unfold it because it's the
[16:21] revealing
[16:24] the making gnome
[16:26] i think go ahead and pull up number one
[16:28] brother
[16:31] forgive me for my throat but we talked a
[16:33] good bit last night then
[16:35] we was around 12 getting into bed
[16:38] and
[16:40] ate too much ice cream and
[16:43] sat around and talked too much but
[16:45] really enjoyed it had a good time with
[16:47] brother
[16:48] being in sister brenda
[16:50] and uh you know just
[16:53] listening to old things and thinking
[16:55] about where we've been down to time
[16:57] but i guess it left my throat just
[16:59] aggravating enough but that's all right
[17:02] i can whisper you know we'll draw it out
[17:04] on the board
[17:05] you know we'll take care of it one way
[17:07] or the other but look what he says now
[17:09] in the church age book
[17:11] page 13 this is the revelation jesus
[17:13] christ which is actually called the
[17:15] church age book
[17:18] now the greek word for revelation is
[17:20] apocalypse
[17:22] which means
[17:23] unveiling
[17:25] this unveiling is perfectly described in
[17:27] the example of a sculpture unveiling
[17:30] this work of statuary
[17:32] exposing it to the onlooker
[17:36] it is an uncovering revealing what was
[17:38] previously hidden
[17:40] all right now listen
[17:43] now the uncovering is not only
[17:46] the revelation of the person of christ
[17:50] listen
[17:52] but is the revelation of his future
[17:54] works
[17:55] in the oncoming seven church ages
[17:59] all right
[18:00] now so it's not going to be dealing i've
[18:02] told you
[18:04] over and over
[18:05] the book of revelation
[18:07] you never see jesus by himself
[18:12] you see him with his bride
[18:15] you see him in his bride
[18:18] revealing himself to his bride or
[18:19] whatever you know
[18:21] but you never see him by himself
[18:24] because remember on the death pentecost
[18:27] when the holy ghost come and started the
[18:29] new testament church
[18:32] it was revealing jesus christ
[18:35] living in mankind
[18:37] right
[18:39] now we come
[18:40] and we'll get just mention it more maybe
[18:43] this afternoon
[18:45] because see then you can get in the
[18:46] church ages and actually go back
[18:50] to the and connect it to the book of
[18:52] acts
[18:54] because the first church age started
[18:56] about 1890 i mean uh 1853
[18:59] that's where paul coming through you
[19:01] know all right so then it would tie back
[19:03] and connect it together
[19:05] and the book of revelation was written
[19:07] about 1895. all right now
[19:11] it's going to be revealing christ in his
[19:13] church
[19:16] how much greater could that be
[19:20] than to find a book
[19:22] that we could read that's talking about
[19:24] us
[19:26] i hope you you you know you you anchor
[19:29] your teeth into that and think on it
[19:32] we think well we can't understand the
[19:34] book of revelation why not
[19:39] the prophet has brought us to understand
[19:41] it
[19:42] the symbols have been explained
[19:45] but the biggest problem is
[19:47] is we can't see ourselves
[19:53] and that's hard to look at because we
[19:55] look at ourselves in the wrong way
[19:59] we look at how bad we are
[20:04] and we'll get to it the lord within this
[20:05] afternoon
[20:06] that
[20:08] before he even comes into the church
[20:11] ages
[20:12] to write
[20:16] okay
[20:17] you know what's happening what would
[20:19] take place on earth
[20:22] he already described how perfect the
[20:24] church is
[20:26] before he writes anything about what
[20:29] she's done
[20:32] now record that in your mind
[20:36] and it'll help you to see what god is
[20:38] doing and it'll help you to understand
[20:40] how that the lamb could be slain before
[20:42] the foundation of the world
[20:45] and all could be done because surely if
[20:48] we believe in god we ought to believe
[20:50] him enough to realize that he knows the
[20:52] beginning of the ending
[20:54] if he doesn't then he's like me and you
[20:56] changing her mind every day
[20:59] but we know that's not true now that's
[21:00] the emphasis of my whole thing and i
[21:03] keep referring to it every service
[21:07] to tie our minds into thinking about
[21:11] that we're talking about ourselves
[21:14] it's not armand neville written in the
[21:16] bible right
[21:20] but when armand neville's on earth and
[21:21] what he's doing you know what's taking
[21:23] place he said his name's in the book
[21:26] well then that's our names in the book
[21:30] it's so simple
[21:32] until we stumble all over it
[21:35] i always try to emphasize it you know
[21:36] that the uh stumbling stone when people
[21:39] stumble over
[21:41] uh you take a
[21:42] uh
[21:43] a whole football field you know and
[21:45] there's nothing on it
[21:47] i forgot what is it wide 50 yards wide
[21:49] but it's 100 yards long
[21:51] and uh nothing on it
[21:54] but lines drawn out
[21:55] and then one rock
[21:58] laying in the middle of it
[22:01] and you're looking for it
[22:04] you know the mankind was supposed to be
[22:05] looking for god to come and stumble over
[22:08] it
[22:12] trying to find it
[22:14] now that's
[22:15] you know i know that's carnality but
[22:17] it's pretty sensible too
[22:19] you think about it
[22:21] let's don't stumble over the word trying
[22:23] to find it that's right it's already
[22:26] been delivered unto us
[22:28] given into our hands all right
[22:30] so then it's the revelation of his
[22:32] future work
[22:37] the godhead is explained throughout the
[22:39] bible
[22:42] life and immortality is brought to light
[22:45] through the scripture
[22:48] all right the bible explains that jesus
[22:50] says unless you believe that i am healed
[22:52] in your sins
[22:55] then the book of revelation is not just
[22:57] dealing with
[22:58] trying to explain the godhead
[23:01] as much as it's dealing with explaining
[23:03] the godhead and where it's at
[23:06] that is in the people
[23:09] that's right and we're seeing a picture
[23:11] of ourselves
[23:14] of how perfect we are in god's eyes
[23:18] before we ever even see it you know
[23:21] before it ever takes place
[23:23] all right now if you don't get that mess
[23:25] get that point because that's what i
[23:27] want dwelling in our mind all right
[23:30] in the book of revelations we never see
[23:32] him alone
[23:33] we see him in bright form or we see him
[23:38] with the bride
[23:39] you know like revelation 19 to make
[23:41] riding with him you know whatever
[23:43] you know and we see the lamb standing
[23:45] there but it might be interesting one
[23:47] day
[23:48] when we get to revelations 5
[23:51] to talk about that lamb
[23:56] the lamb that takes the book
[23:59] that might be interesting when we get
[24:01] there
[24:03] because remember that lamb has seven
[24:04] horns and seven eyes
[24:10] which is the church itself
[24:13] right so put that down and think on it
[24:15] as we go along all
[24:16] right now
[24:20] it's the revelation that god give to
[24:23] jesus
[24:25] because he didn't understand
[24:29] when he would be coming back
[24:32] he said well he was gone he said
[24:35] he understood all things don't it was
[24:37] withholding from him
[24:39] that's right
[24:41] if god
[24:43] i noticed brother richard wilkes wilson
[24:45] they would mention they would always say
[24:47] if god can have amnesia
[24:53] oh that's impossible well evidently it's
[24:56] not
[24:58] because our sins can be put in the sea
[25:00] of forgetfulness
[25:03] and god can't remember them
[25:08] when i thought god could know everything
[25:11] he does
[25:13] but what he decides he don't want to
[25:15] remember
[25:18] you know and i don't mean this wrong now
[25:20] i just try to think in a carnal way you
[25:23] know we think about alzheimer's and i
[25:24] like that every time you say those words
[25:27] but
[25:28] you know
[25:29] you've ever thought about it
[25:31] you look at a person sitting there
[25:34] and they they can't remember
[25:39] you know
[25:40] i know i'm carnal i know that but
[25:42] forgive me
[25:44] but you know there's a lot of things i'd
[25:46] like to be able to not remember
[25:51] right
[25:53] i mean a lot of things i wish i couldn't
[25:56] remember
[25:57] you know
[25:58] well are they
[26:00] cursed or are they blessed
[26:02] you know i just look at things
[26:04] differently
[26:06] i know it's it's a bad thing
[26:08] but it's mainly because we
[26:11] and you know
[26:12] come on i know i get in trouble trying
[26:14] to explain things but still
[26:16] you know you go into people and the
[26:18] first thing you do you go in like
[26:20] somebody that's real sick
[26:23] what's your first thing
[26:25] you remember me
[26:31] right
[26:32] in that 90 of the time
[26:35] you remember me you know who i am
[26:40] unless you ain't helping the person
[26:44] you say i just want to know if they can
[26:46] remember why
[26:49] why don't you tell them who you are
[26:53] might be like i told you before about
[26:56] my brother gave my mother a ring because
[26:58] you know daddy never had one to give to
[27:00] her
[27:00] my brother gave my mother a wedding man
[27:03] hanging
[27:04] you know had a little stone in it
[27:07] but he told me he said when you pass
[27:09] away i went back
[27:12] but we were sitting there until we took
[27:14] care of her house and
[27:15] you know
[27:17] and she was laying there we thought like
[27:19] liking a coma you know whatever just
[27:21] not saying nothing
[27:23] my brother would have taken it off it
[27:25] would just turn over and a little stone
[27:27] was pushed into her finger
[27:29] and it just reached down and turned it
[27:31] back over you know to get it from
[27:32] pressing in she said leave it alone i
[27:35] ain't dead yet
[27:38] well
[27:41] when i think about life in a different
[27:43] form
[27:45] in a way why you want to go in you know
[27:47] who i am
[27:49] don't tell them who you are
[27:50] that's right
[27:52] you know what i'm saying when you're
[27:53] doing all right
[27:55] you said when you're you're telling them
[27:56] who you are well
[28:01] the birds on me and you get the point we
[28:03] we we run a lot of things and i don't
[28:05] mean to get into all that
[28:07] i don't charge for those things
[28:09] but listen church
[28:13] i think it's about time to realize who
[28:15] we are
[28:17] and our purpose for being here
[28:21] it's not too good of a day to try to
[28:23] figure out what we're going to do and
[28:25] what we're going to have
[28:27] because tomorrow we might not have
[28:31] you know
[28:32] it's the time to realize who we are
[28:35] god's got a purpose for you and i
[28:39] to find out who we are
[28:47] he wasn't denying his family
[28:50] he said i found out i'm a child of god
[28:54] it's time you and i realize who we are
[28:58] and our purpose for being here
[29:01] is to conquer satan right
[29:05] well that can't be done let's see
[29:06] there's where you you just first off you
[29:09] lied because the bible says we can
[29:14] i said all things are possible to them
[29:16] that believe
[29:18] so you're lying about it and you're not
[29:21] facing up to what see we're chosen for
[29:24] an end time to bring somebody's got to
[29:26] come to a change of the body right right
[29:30] but how can we come to a change of the
[29:31] body if we don't realize who we are
[29:35] and our purpose for being here
[29:40] maybe it'll work all right
[29:43] jesus didn't know
[29:45] when he was coming
[29:48] right
[29:49] and the prophet said in the same way
[29:51] he didn't know
[29:53] what was going to be in the future about
[29:55] the church
[29:57] you know
[29:59] the operation the daily part to him
[30:01] being in the church
[30:03] he knew he came to die
[30:05] he knew that things but
[30:08] i know i think cardinal but
[30:10] as i said god if god can have amnesia
[30:12] why can't we think of jesus being
[30:15] human enough to work
[30:17] that things had to be made known to it
[30:21] that was that inside making outside
[30:24] known
[30:25] right
[30:26] and see then god had never made the god
[30:28] inside of him had never made known to
[30:30] the outside man he is part of what was
[30:33] going to be
[30:35] because i think i honestly believe
[30:37] i believe that one day when they handed
[30:39] him the scroll you know when he sat down
[30:40] there
[30:41] and he read isaiah
[30:45] and he when he read isaiah 61
[30:49] the spirit of the lord's upon me because
[30:50] he hasn't wanted me to
[30:51] see he only read heist
[30:53] because when he started reading it
[30:56] it was made alive
[30:59] so he stopped
[31:01] and didn't read the rest of it
[31:03] so because that'll be for another day
[31:05] then he looked back and he said
[31:06] this day
[31:08] this scripture is revealed to me
[31:13] all right when are we going to do that
[31:16] to get to that point all right get on
[31:18] into what we're trying to do
[31:20] he didn't know when he would come he
[31:22] didn't know he's part of the kingdom
[31:24] my point is trying to get one thing
[31:29] that god has come to join our patmos
[31:36] to reveal
[31:38] the future of the church
[31:43] all right
[31:44] as i say we basically most of the time
[31:47] reading the bible
[31:48] we read the bible to try to find out how
[31:51] bad we are
[31:54] right yes
[31:55] we want to know what we've done how
[31:57] about does the bible say it's wrong
[31:59] because
[32:00] remote used to say
[32:02] i don't know it had a point of funny way
[32:04] of expressing it and said
[32:05] you know you talk about stealing he said
[32:08] you know the bible don't say thou shalt
[32:09] not steal chicken
[32:12] you don't say that
[32:14] then you scripture
[32:17] but see it tells you not to steal them
[32:21] well then it would cover all animals
[32:24] but you see then
[32:26] are we reading the bible to try to find
[32:28] out what god is saying about us
[32:32] or are we trying to find out what he's
[32:33] saying the bad part about us
[32:35] sure we want to get rid of
[32:37] the things of our life right
[32:40] sure we want to quit things that god
[32:42] says we shouldn't be doing and we want
[32:45] to do the things that that he said we
[32:47] should be doing right
[32:49] but why can't we read it to find out who
[32:51] we are
[32:54] the entire bible is written to show us
[32:56] who we are
[32:57] then the book of revelations counts it
[32:59] off by actually showing us
[33:08] when something is revealed to you to you
[33:12] you know that's as real as almost that
[33:14] you can make it that's right right
[33:19] if i run around and say he said if god
[33:21] told me to go raise george washington
[33:23] from the dead
[33:25] he said i'd invite the world
[33:28] why
[33:29] because
[33:30] if he showed him he was raised george
[33:33] washington was already raised as far as
[33:35] he was concerned
[33:36] right
[33:37] see that's the way a revelation is so
[33:39] when god shows the church
[33:41] what i love and i'll try not to spend
[33:44] much time in it because i'm wanting to
[33:46] get on over
[33:47] but yeah i love to read and see like
[33:51] verse one maybe of the church age
[33:54] and how bad we are and like i said what
[33:55] we need to get rid of i i that's fine
[33:59] but i like to read the last verses to
[34:01] that age because every one of them says
[34:04] to him that overcome it
[34:09] well you know as far as god is concerned
[34:10] he's not seeing what we're doing
[34:13] if he's seeing what we were doing he'd
[34:15] have to kill us for doing it that's
[34:16] right
[34:19] but he sees the lamb
[34:21] that paid the price that's right
[34:24] so he's not looking at us that's right
[34:27] well
[34:28] see that's where that most of your
[34:29] preachers preach what you're doing and
[34:31] what you're not doing
[34:34] now come on first i'm not
[34:37] that bad just try to express it a little
[34:40] but you know it's true they spend their
[34:41] time trying to condemn you
[34:44] to straighten you up the lord call me to
[34:47] straighten the church up no the lord
[34:49] called me to preach the gospel
[34:50] illustrating the church
[34:53] he didn't call me to straighten up the
[34:54] church that's bad business because who
[34:57] am i going to start with i'm starting to
[34:58] pull pip first
[35:01] i never would be able to get out of the
[35:02] pulpit
[35:04] right
[35:06] because every time i get one thing
[35:07] straight you ever done that
[35:09] you ever had something bothering you yes
[35:11] you think if i could get over this
[35:13] oh would it be wonderful if i get over
[35:15] this you get over that and this board is
[35:17] pretty good for a little while you know
[35:20] but all at once here goes something else
[35:23] then you got to start working on that
[35:25] one
[35:28] because we're just human mortals
[35:30] all right
[35:31] we see we need to get down to the point
[35:33] of believing
[35:36] that the bible is telling us who we are
[35:42] and not only does god tell us who we are
[35:45] you know we're his children we're his
[35:46] offspring
[35:48] all right
[35:49] but he's telling us how precious we are
[35:51] in his side
[35:55] he's telling us what he look what we
[35:57] looked like through his eyes
[36:01] he said well boy that's bad because of
[36:02] what he looked on because he can't see
[36:04] us
[36:09] he only sees the blood
[36:12] you can't see what we're doing
[36:16] the church that's what i'm trying to get
[36:17] us to understand
[36:20] then the book of revelation is just
[36:22] summing up
[36:25] and showing
[36:27] who we are
[36:32] he said but but brother dallas if we go
[36:34] too far into that we'll go out into the
[36:36] world no matter what we do
[36:48] deceiving your own self
[36:54] by him revealing to me how perfect i am
[36:58] you know where that carries me to my
[37:00] knees
[37:01] right
[37:02] because i know
[37:05] what i am
[37:07] i don't have to be told what i am right
[37:10] i know what i am so then it'll be in
[37:13] that way
[37:15] when he starts telling me what he thinks
[37:17] about me
[37:20] you know i mean if you want to really
[37:23] have a day home or something just get
[37:25] all of these sisters together with their
[37:27] bright books
[37:30] you know
[37:31] then pictures of the kids and the
[37:32] grandkids
[37:34] you know
[37:37] well you know you don't start out and
[37:41] you know
[37:42] and look down and
[37:44] there's a baby and then you grow up you
[37:46] know
[37:47] you don't look down to said
[37:51] that dirty rascal is a drug addict
[37:56] don't talk to mama about her kids okay
[38:01] right you get into trouble
[38:03] if you want to get along with grandmas
[38:05] you talk with grandmas about the good
[38:07] things you know
[38:08] you don't throw off on the kids or the
[38:10] grandkids
[38:12] cause they you know they're blind they
[38:14] just can't see it
[38:16] now they know what happened
[38:19] we get what's in it look at the baby
[38:22] and they don't think about all the it
[38:23] has to
[38:24] see later pictures
[38:27] it makes them start thinking about the
[38:29] wrong things in life
[38:31] we don't i don't know later pictures
[38:34] he made one picture
[38:38] you know what i like about it
[38:40] we can put all the emphasis in how how
[38:43] old we was 18 20 years old or something
[38:45] you know prior to the prime of life the
[38:47] thing but you know
[38:49] most people don't ever read enough to
[38:50] realize where that picture was made
[38:53] what do you mean it made one 1820 no no
[38:55] no
[38:57] it was made before the foundation of the
[39:00] world of prophecy
[39:03] it wasn't made sister gayle when you
[39:05] were 18 or 20 in your prime it was made
[39:08] before the world well then it's not a
[39:10] picture of you in 1820
[39:16] it's a picture of what he sees
[39:20] oh they can take these things now you
[39:22] know they can take an old rugby face
[39:24] like mine and they can just doctor that
[39:26] up and and man they you know they make
[39:28] you look good
[39:30] but don't change nothing
[39:32] i can put on all kinds of stuff to make
[39:34] me look good it don't change my hand
[39:36] but just get what i'm saying
[39:40] god
[39:41] so much of his bride in the end time
[39:46] and i keep emphasizing that because you
[39:48] know yourself what you think
[39:50] now how many of you think this way i
[39:53] wish i'd have been back there
[39:57] i wish i'd been there when
[39:59] when jesus was this or that i wish i'd
[40:01] been back there when brother branham was
[40:03] here
[40:06] no i'm glad to be here
[40:09] right
[40:13] i mean there's no way i want to erase we
[40:14] talk about that this morning i wouldn't
[40:16] want to raise my life for nothing i've
[40:17] told you over and over there's a lot of
[40:19] things in my life i don't like i wish i
[40:20] could get rid of
[40:22] without changing me but you know if i
[40:24] got rid of them things
[40:27] i wouldn't be who i am
[40:31] so good or bad i just take it like it is
[40:35] what i've been through in life has made
[40:36] me what i am
[40:40] but what about god not even seeing us
[40:42] wrong
[40:45] i can't get away from that point that's
[40:46] just you know let's see
[40:50] now look
[40:54] he's revealing his presence
[40:58] to us
[40:59] all right so let's start in a little bit
[41:01] i didn't think you're gonna be on this
[41:02] but
[41:04] all right let's just read a little bit
[41:07] of the things that you understand
[41:10] let's go to verse
[41:13] 4 of
[41:16] brother
[41:17] anderson there's any way for you to pull
[41:19] up because you would own three want to
[41:20] go and he's going to scroll down you
[41:22] know one two three revelations one can
[41:25] you pull revelations one four
[41:27] like through a to describe it you know
[41:31] and
[41:32] while they're working on that to get it
[41:35] i want you to notice something that's
[41:37] very
[41:37] odd to me
[41:42] anytime god repeats something
[41:47] it means like where he says very very i
[41:49] say unto you
[41:50] all right
[41:51] now for him to repeat something the
[41:53] prophet said it one day like this he
[41:54] said he's emphasizing
[41:57] you know
[41:58] led emphasis upon the point
[42:01] so when he says verily verily
[42:04] surely surely i stay under these pearson
[42:08] he's emphasized now what i want you to
[42:10] do
[42:11] i've never counted to see how many they
[42:12] are but we're going to read verse 1
[42:14] through
[42:15] down through eight
[42:18] in revelations one
[42:20] but i want you to notice how many times
[42:23] it says and
[42:27] all right
[42:29] then in your mind translate the word
[42:32] from and to even
[42:34] because that's interchangeable word
[42:37] every time an ant is used it's not
[42:39] meaning even but you know like paul said
[42:41] to god and father
[42:44] that's two people
[42:46] god ansi but when you say god even
[42:50] father
[42:53] it totally changed the thought didn't it
[42:56] you come back to one understanding of
[42:57] who it is
[42:59] it's not two gods
[43:02] so then use that in your mind and think
[43:04] about it but now
[43:05] just notice how many times
[43:08] that when you get down we'll start on
[43:09] verse four brother so roll it up to the
[43:11] top
[43:14] john to the seven churches which are in
[43:16] asia grace be unto you
[43:18] and
[43:22] you don't have to move it to there but
[43:23] that's good even peace
[43:28] from him which he is
[43:31] and
[43:34] now for a second what i'm talking about
[43:35] when it's used is and i'll use the word
[43:37] even okay
[43:39] so then we'll read it john to the seven
[43:41] church ages which are your names of
[43:42] grace be unto you even peace from him
[43:45] which is
[43:46] even which was even which is to come
[43:50] emphasizing the one
[43:53] even from the seven spirits which are
[43:56] before his throne
[44:00] now
[44:01] we've got them here if you need them so
[44:02] there's no need of scrolling even up in
[44:04] it to find them
[44:06] but there's not seven spirits of god
[44:14] and i have a quote in here for good time
[44:15] we'll get back and read it but brother
[44:17] brown said it's like explaining
[44:20] in corinthians about the
[44:22] uh gifts and times
[44:25] he said it's one
[44:27] holy spirit
[44:28] with nine gifts
[44:30] right
[44:31] all right so it's seven times god uses
[44:35] the the
[44:36] uh spirit of god down to the ages and
[44:38] that's the emphasis i put onto the
[44:40] life's messenger of the holy spirit in
[44:43] every age
[44:47] to make it blind be in our minds and
[44:49] line up that that it's not seven spirits
[44:53] i don't have seven holy spirits
[44:56] it's one holy spirit
[44:59] manifesting himself in seven ways
[45:02] through the seven church age messengers
[45:04] all right it's one holy spirit
[45:06] manifesting himself in the millions of
[45:09] born-again christians that from there up
[45:12] until now
[45:14] not a different holy spirit so then when
[45:17] you talk about is the word that was eat
[45:18] down in the ages not the holy spirit
[45:21] right it was the holy spirit in those
[45:23] ages that was the emphasis all right now
[45:26] we're coming up to the point of what
[45:28] from the seven spirits not seven spirits
[45:31] but it was selling spirits and be
[45:32] selling thrones
[45:35] right
[45:36] so then you agreed seven spirits which
[45:38] are before seven thrones
[45:43] because you'd have to have a throne for
[45:45] each one of them if not you've got to
[45:46] throw them full of spirits
[45:48] right
[45:49] you know seven spirits sitting on one
[45:50] throne
[45:52] but you see we needed the prophet to
[45:54] explain them things to us
[45:57] and to emphasize the things to work that
[46:00] we would understand what it's talking
[46:02] about it's talking about the church age
[46:03] messenger and the spirit of god through
[46:05] those men and the spirit of god in each
[46:07] church age
[46:11] giving the new birth to the people and
[46:13] leading the people in that age
[46:15] all right
[46:16] and what
[46:17] don't keep in their point now verse 5
[46:21] even from jesus christ who is the
[46:23] faithful witness
[46:24] even the first begotten of the dead even
[46:26] the prince of the kings of the earth
[46:31] there's no emphasis made then upon
[46:33] trinitarianism in any form
[46:35] that's what i'm trying to erase from our
[46:37] minds you say well brother dale what do
[46:39] you mean i've never been a trinitarian i
[46:42] never was out there i don't understand
[46:44] the doctor was born one
[46:46] they born one
[46:49] we were born with a carnal mind a carnal
[46:51] mind right
[46:53] to not be able to understand so then it
[46:55] just keeps on going unto him that loved
[46:57] us even washed us from our sins in his
[47:00] own blood i'm just emphasizing it
[47:04] that he's showing
[47:08] us this is a description
[47:11] of you and i
[47:14] it's a description of him yes
[47:17] but where's he at
[47:21] he's in you and i
[47:23] manifesting himself and has made us
[47:27] kings
[47:29] even priests verse six
[47:32] unto god
[47:33] even his father to him be glory even
[47:36] dominion forever even ever
[47:40] it is emphasizing the point
[47:45] he's showing a picture of you and i
[47:47] starts right off the book of revelations
[47:51] telling us it's a revelation
[47:53] that's going to be given to jesus christ
[47:57] of himself and his works in the church
[48:00] all right
[48:01] that one through three that we've been
[48:03] reading
[48:05] all right and then it would be showing
[48:07] the bride
[48:10] and what he thinks of us
[48:12] before he ever gets to chapter two to
[48:14] start writing about what we've done
[48:17] he's already telling us how perfect we
[48:19] are
[48:22] but see our problem is we look through
[48:24] our own eyes
[48:25] not only at other people we look at our
[48:27] own sails
[48:29] now sometimes we lie to ourselves tell
[48:31] us how beautiful we are but we got
[48:33] enough sense to know
[48:35] right
[48:37] like i've always told you there's more
[48:38] muscle strain my weight lifters in front
[48:41] of a mirror you know doing the pumping
[48:43] their muscles than they are pulling on
[48:45] the weights
[48:46] you know
[48:48] but there's no need to lie
[48:52] i know i get in trouble by trying to say
[48:54] things and then i say that something
[48:56] like my wife you know
[48:58] and then she'll say well why'd you bring
[48:59] that out
[49:01] i don't look as pretty as i did no we're
[49:03] not as pretty as we used to be
[49:05] but in my eyes she's just as beautiful
[49:07] as she was the day i married her
[49:10] why because
[49:12] she's my wife and i love her
[49:17] yeah i know i'm not the guy she married
[49:20] i'm old
[49:23] but her eyes got damn
[49:26] right
[49:28] she can't see it's because she used to
[49:32] you have to be along with her that
[49:34] because
[49:35] you put her hair on the floor and she'd
[49:36] find it
[49:38] anything i'll do this come here honey
[49:42] find a screw i don't look all over the
[49:45] place
[49:46] you look clarity yes when you see that
[49:48] one you know
[49:50] but see that's just
[49:51] life
[49:54] all right
[49:56] but not get the point
[49:58] it's not seven spirits
[50:00] it's the holy spirit
[50:03] that's right dealing in
[50:05] the church ages
[50:07] all right
[50:08] now in doing that
[50:12] it connects to every verse to show us
[50:14] the and
[50:18] the and the and
[50:21] as even not another one not and meaning
[50:24] one thing and then another one
[50:27] you see if you reach this way you go to
[50:29] town and get a loaf
[50:31] and a pound of bananas
[50:34] all right now you don't read that you go
[50:36] to town to get a loaf of bread even a
[50:37] pound of bananas now you don't let one
[50:39] of them out
[50:42] right
[50:43] come on i know that's carnal but is it
[50:45] sensible
[50:46] you left one of those off you're only
[50:48] going to get one
[50:49] but when god says
[50:52] god and father
[50:55] god even father
[50:59] he's not talking about two people
[51:04] he's talking about the one person and
[51:05] how beautiful it
[51:06] is all right now
[51:09] i want to emphasize a minute one thing
[51:13] do we believe we are the children of god
[51:17] by the new birth
[51:19] do we believe the bible and what it says
[51:21] we are his offspring
[51:23] amen
[51:27] now if we are the children of god
[51:31] then you can run a dna
[51:34] to find out whether we're real or not
[51:37] right
[51:38] now that's the word you know that's what
[51:40] they do
[51:42] to find out whether we're really the
[51:43] children of god is to go into the word
[51:46] it's not go down and find out how we
[51:48] shout and scream and glory hallelujah
[51:50] and all that's well and good you know
[51:52] how we are and how good we are
[51:54] is to go and see what we think about
[51:56] this word
[51:57] because this word not only was my father
[51:59] writing to me
[52:01] this word is my father writing about me
[52:06] now can you separate
[52:08] you know
[52:09] we have
[52:11] wade
[52:12] karen
[52:13] anna
[52:15] now
[52:16] can you separate them from me
[52:19] irregardless if anna got married
[52:22] see and her maiden name changed to
[52:24] roberts all right
[52:25] i mean her name changed robert
[52:27] her maiden name was dale
[52:30] she got dale blood
[52:33] right
[52:34] and it'll never change
[52:38] because your children are you
[52:41] reproduced
[52:42] right
[52:43] right the dna proves it the things that
[52:46] we run through but what about in god
[52:51] when seeing in in natural they had to be
[52:54] a a a um what's the word procreating is
[52:57] that the ones you use
[52:59] you know they had to be
[53:00] uh uh
[53:02] some take place between me and my wife
[53:03] to bring the kids all right
[53:06] but see in god by the new birth
[53:12] he didn't just make us another person
[53:15] by the new birth he makes you
[53:18] his offspring
[53:20] which is him
[53:23] in another form
[53:26] right right
[53:28] he said well i'm a son of god
[53:30] you see a lot of people believe in
[53:32] trinitarianism right
[53:34] now which one are you
[53:37] in trinitarianism which one are you are
[53:39] you a son of jesus are you a son of god
[53:42] or your son of the holy spirit
[53:48] so trinitarianism won't work you would
[53:51] be divided up and trying to figure out
[53:52] where you come from
[53:55] but in the one true and living god the
[53:56] father son and holy ghost is the same
[53:58] lord jesus christ
[54:01] so then that would make you
[54:04] god make manifest in another form
[54:08] is that true
[54:11] we're not just the offspring
[54:15] like some offspring that is made
[54:19] we are him made manifest
[54:23] so he's not describing
[54:25] you and i
[54:28] in the book of revelation come on you
[54:29] understand follow that word
[54:31] you're not describing what you're
[54:32] looking at that's right
[54:35] he's not describing samuel dale and his
[54:37] attitudes and ways and things and doing
[54:40] that's the part of the the church ages
[54:42] that he always has to kind of click us a
[54:45] little bit
[54:48] but he's talking about himself
[54:53] in you and i
[54:56] not another person
[55:00] but himself may manifest in you and i
[55:04] well brother dale if i believe that i'd
[55:07] be shouting why don't you
[55:16] what i think about what god
[55:18] says we thought long enough about what
[55:21] we thought
[55:23] we talked long enough about ourselves
[55:28] i like that song you know so what sims
[55:30] are you talking about
[55:33] huh
[55:37] so you can't always say it over and over
[55:39] you can't accuse my dad he's been dead
[55:41] since 1945.
[55:43] you can't accuse him
[55:46] of doing something today
[55:51] and even if i've done something it's not
[55:53] credited to him
[55:56] hey
[55:56] he's telling us
[55:59] if we be dead in christ
[56:04] i mean why can't we start looking at
[56:05] that
[56:07] hey listen folks
[56:10] see some people are worried that you
[56:12] preach to people and get them to free
[56:18] now don't you worry about it
[56:22] because the devil ain't gonna let you
[56:24] get free
[56:28] if he does you belong to him
[56:33] if you ever get the idea well it don't
[56:35] matter what i do i'm a christian all
[56:37] right you're not a christian isn't that
[56:39] sensible
[56:41] you're the devil's child
[56:42] you're deceived
[56:46] well i can get my way because i'm a
[56:47] christian no you can't get by
[56:50] brother said you sent us in as a
[56:51] christian you'll reap a top four
[56:55] don't you worry about the devil's gonna
[56:56] keep beating on us to keep us from
[56:58] getting to play to the place that we
[57:00] find out we're too perfect he's going to
[57:01] beat on us too much until god's going to
[57:04] have to cut the work short
[57:06] if he don't there ain't going to be no
[57:08] flesh saying that's what the bible says
[57:09] the prophet
[57:10] said you see we say well bless god
[57:13] brother dale i can't be deceived
[57:15] you're quoting good you're talking good
[57:17] but what are you going to do where the
[57:18] prophet said
[57:20] if and the bible says
[57:23] if he didn't cut the work short there'd
[57:26] be no flesh saved
[57:29] now what are you gonna do that what are
[57:31] you gonna do with the prophet saying you
[57:33] know
[57:34] that we're seeing every day
[57:37] what are you gonna do with those type of
[57:39] things
[57:41] you see we've got to get to the basis of
[57:43] seeing the way god sees things
[57:48] that's where problem is because that's
[57:50] that's the point of what we're talking
[57:51] about we'll get to because you're going
[57:53] down to verse 9 of what we've been there
[57:54] now and he said john he said he was in
[57:57] the spirit
[58:00] all right
[58:01] and we know enough to know all the
[58:02] things we don't need the quotes i've got
[58:04] them laid here if you'd like them
[58:07] when the prophet talks about you go to a
[58:09] ball game you don't go down to a ball
[58:10] game and said turn like
[58:12] all fire
[58:15] you know whenever your teams are winning
[58:18] oh
[58:20] i was good
[58:23] oh you do like the kids that was cool
[58:28] me and zach was going through jefferson
[58:29] one day and the guy right in front of us
[58:32] just smacked the far out of the back of
[58:33] a car and zach was about four years old
[58:36] 10 or 12. and this guy run right in
[58:38] powder in the back
[58:40] exactly told me he said that was cool
[58:42] wouldn't it
[58:46] well i just think he's too cool and i'm
[58:47] sure the guy got run into it and thank
[58:49] you
[58:50] why would you see him no cool
[58:54] but listen church
[59:01] if you get in the spirit
[59:04] you know they brought around said you
[59:05] cannot get the holy spirit without
[59:07] getting in the spirit
[59:10] now you didn't say the spirit fall on
[59:11] you then you get in the spirit
[59:15] right
[59:17] he says you can't get in the spirit
[59:21] you know i mean you've got to get in the
[59:23] spirit to get the holy spirit
[59:29] getting in the spirit
[59:34] but do we pray for a revelation
[59:36] how many today prayed that god would
[59:38] speak to you this morning here in the
[59:39] church
[59:41] before you came
[59:43] i mean you don't have to get down and
[59:44] beg him to do and i'm just talking about
[59:46] you know on the road you're thinking
[59:47] driving up the road to the lord i assure
[59:48] you hope is a good service today
[59:51] we'll see how i count that as talking to
[59:53] god
[59:55] you know what you'd be in a prayerful
[59:56] attitude and never say never get down on
[59:58] your knees and pray and do all those
[1:00:00] things you just live in a prayerful
[1:00:02] attitude
[1:00:04] you ever just go around thanking god for
[1:00:06] what he's done
[1:00:08] never do that
[1:00:10] just thank him i get up in the middle of
[1:00:12] the night and go to the bathroom you
[1:00:13] know
[1:00:14] and everything and then i thank him for
[1:00:16] getting me up and letting me go to the
[1:00:17] bathroom
[1:00:20] you know like we read
[1:00:22] a lot of people incapable of doing that
[1:00:24] that catheters take care of that
[1:00:26] problem but listen church
[1:00:30] we need to get in the spirit more than
[1:00:31] anything in the world
[1:00:34] now we get in the spirit of everything
[1:00:35] we do in life and living and things like
[1:00:37] that that's all
[1:00:39] and i i'm not one to say you can't go to
[1:00:41] the ball game
[1:00:43] yeah
[1:00:44] but if you emphasize the ball game above
[1:00:47] the church then you miss it
[1:00:49] you go to the ball games and the things
[1:00:51] like that hunting fishing whatever you
[1:00:53] do it and you go do it deliberately on
[1:00:55] sunday and miss the services in this
[1:00:57] room wrong
[1:00:59] i'm just honest
[1:01:00] but if we just in the spirit
[1:01:04] can live in the spirit
[1:01:06] let's run through these in a hurry okay
[1:01:08] because there's some in there i want to
[1:01:09] make sure we just read them go ahead
[1:01:11] brother
[1:01:12] pull up
[1:01:18] all right
[1:01:21] there that's the one that i went through
[1:01:23] that well ago because this is explaining
[1:01:24] the seven spirits to begin with this is
[1:01:26] taken for 248 church eight books already
[1:01:29] in church age to begin with we know that
[1:01:31] certainly these verses are not teaching
[1:01:33] a new and country doctrine to john
[1:01:36] 4 24a which says god is a one spirit
[1:01:40] but this is like first corinthians 12 8
[1:01:43] through 11 wherein we find one spirit
[1:01:45] manifesting himself in nine ways thus we
[1:01:47] know that the seven spirits of god mean
[1:01:50] it is the one and same spirit coming
[1:01:53] forth in a seven-fold way go ahead and
[1:01:56] screw the other and we'll read as fast
[1:01:57] as we can
[1:01:59] it is very evident that the word they
[1:02:01] refers to men thus we see that the eyes
[1:02:03] of the lord in this testicle that's what
[1:02:05] he's talking about to plummet there's a
[1:02:06] ruble in the thighs of the lord
[1:02:08] of course they will be the be anointed
[1:02:10] men full of the holy ghost for god's
[1:02:12] ministries
[1:02:14] are not in the power of men but of the
[1:02:16] holy ghost putting our scriptures
[1:02:18] discoveries together it is evident that
[1:02:20] the seven spirits of god refer to the
[1:02:22] continuous ministry of the same holy
[1:02:24] spirit in the lives of seven men with
[1:02:26] whom god identifies himself very closely
[1:02:29] they are his eyes and they are his lamps
[1:02:32] who these seven men are can easily be
[1:02:35] seen
[1:02:36] because the next verse calls them the
[1:02:38] seven stars which you already know which
[1:02:41] is the messenger of the age go ahead to
[1:02:42] the next
[1:02:44] huh
[1:02:46] yes
[1:02:47] this is 251 church eight book yes the
[1:02:49] spirit is not seven spirits but one he
[1:02:52] will always be the same and act the same
[1:02:54] all right now
[1:02:56] and the seven messengers will have the
[1:02:57] same spirit and teach the same word and
[1:02:59] have the same power
[1:03:01] if the church is the true church it will
[1:03:03] have the very same spirit and word and
[1:03:06] acts of power that they had at pentecost
[1:03:08] by experience it will be a pentecostal
[1:03:10] church and there will be tongues and
[1:03:12] interpretation and prophecy and healings
[1:03:15] god will be in the midst of her and god
[1:03:17] will declare himself in the midst of her
[1:03:19] as he always has hallelujah
[1:03:21] and she will be unorganized don't forget
[1:03:25] that now you say well we don't have tom
[1:03:27] we don't have a shout out
[1:03:33] you me we don't have it
[1:03:36] you know what you're saying
[1:03:41] you're saying y'all don't have it
[1:03:45] you're not saying we
[1:03:49] right
[1:03:51] you're saying it's everybody else's
[1:03:53] fault
[1:03:55] so if you think that we don't have tons
[1:03:58] of interpretation why don't you do
[1:04:00] something about it
[1:04:02] and shut up dropping about what
[1:04:04] everybody else and thinking y'all don't
[1:04:06] have it i'm in the spirit
[1:04:10] but won't you act like like i always
[1:04:12] tell everybody you know if you're happy
[1:04:14] let your face know it
[1:04:19] right
[1:04:20] come on get the next one
[1:04:22] okay
[1:04:25] this is talking about getting in the
[1:04:26] spirit this is what i want to get to and
[1:04:28] you can't do any good until first you
[1:04:29] get in the spirit god can't use you
[1:04:33] that's right okay
[1:04:35] you're you're you're you're
[1:04:37] he stutters real good
[1:04:39] all your efforts are are in vain until
[1:04:41] first you do it in the spirit if i will
[1:04:44] sing i will sing in the spirit
[1:04:47] if i'll pray he said paul i pray
[1:04:50] and then if there is anything that comes
[1:04:52] to me that's any good it has to be
[1:04:55] revealed to me by the spirit and
[1:04:57] confirmed by the word
[1:04:59] made manifest by the results it bears
[1:05:02] okay
[1:05:03] so now it's our problem
[1:05:05] if we don't get in the spirit god can't
[1:05:07] use us
[1:05:09] you come in and sit down like a fired up
[1:05:11] prune and want everybody else to why why
[1:05:13] is everybody else not happy today
[1:05:16] you know that brother brown says
[1:05:18] one person
[1:05:22] hinder the spirit of god
[1:05:25] and we'll have to give an account
[1:05:30] he said a judgment for that
[1:05:34] there are certain people that i don't
[1:05:36] want to come to church here
[1:05:40] no you know why because they've never
[1:05:42] changed yet and they can come in here
[1:05:44] and lock this place down
[1:05:52] because everybody's got in the spirit of
[1:05:54] that person
[1:06:00] well brother dale's mean i know
[1:06:04] but i have to fight them out of service
[1:06:10] well why don't you just tell the person
[1:06:11] to leave then see that way i wouldn't be
[1:06:13] i wouldn't be loving the person that's
[1:06:15] right
[1:06:19] i love people and i want them to be
[1:06:21] helped so there's not a person in the
[1:06:23] world i don't want to see in this church
[1:06:25] did that change it around where you can
[1:06:26] understand what i'm talking about
[1:06:28] i want everybody to come but it wants
[1:06:29] all to be in the spirit of god and be
[1:06:32] happy and joyous and be you know
[1:06:35] rejoicing about god's word
[1:06:39] all right
[1:06:40] now
[1:06:41] go ahead with the next
[1:06:44] all right now this is the patmos vision
[1:06:46] uh not this this is 1204 which is the
[1:06:50] sea reason
[1:06:51] all right now it was in the spirit of
[1:06:53] the lord's day now remember the first
[1:06:54] thing you have to do is what get in the
[1:06:56] spirit
[1:06:57] yours how's these revelations going to
[1:07:00] ever come to you
[1:07:02] you know what most people don't get a
[1:07:04] revelation right here it is
[1:07:08] they don't get a revelation cause they
[1:07:09] don't get in the spirit to receive it
[1:07:12] amen how's these revelations going to
[1:07:14] ever come to you get in the spirit are
[1:07:17] you ever going to get the holy ghost get
[1:07:19] in the spirit
[1:07:21] was that right what i said a while ago
[1:07:22] how are you going to get the holy spirit
[1:07:24] you got to get the spirit to get the
[1:07:24] holy spirit
[1:07:32] you know i want it
[1:07:38] you know i love you lord
[1:07:40] that means told him to date you loved
[1:07:42] him
[1:07:45] or you like the fella was you know
[1:07:47] his wife said honey
[1:07:49] you told me when you love me you know
[1:07:50] when you married me that day she loved
[1:07:52] me and said it's 20 years now you ain't
[1:07:54] never told me again he said if i ever
[1:07:56] change my mind let you know
[1:07:59] well is that the way we would thank god
[1:08:04] you know thank my mind lord i'll tell
[1:08:06] you i love you
[1:08:07] now that's not exactly the way it's
[1:08:09] supposed to be all right
[1:08:11] now
[1:08:12] go ahead to the next one
[1:08:15] this is off the patmos vision church
[1:08:17] book now page 43
[1:08:18] i was in the spirit isn't that just
[1:08:20] beautiful my i love that if you could
[1:08:23] just call these words the whole of the
[1:08:25] christian life
[1:08:27] what getting in the spirit
[1:08:30] if we are going to live as christians we
[1:08:32] have to be in his spirit
[1:08:34] john was not talking about being in his
[1:08:36] own spirit that would not have brought
[1:08:39] these visions
[1:08:41] now come on john patmos wouldn't talk
[1:08:43] about being his own spirit it wouldn't
[1:08:44] brought the vision it had to be the
[1:08:46] spirit of god it has to be the spirit of
[1:08:48] god with us to
[1:08:50] our all our efforts are inviting paul
[1:08:53] said i i will pray in the spirit i will
[1:08:55] sing in the spirit i live in the spirit
[1:08:57] if there's anything good that will come
[1:08:58] to me it has to be revealed by the
[1:09:00] spirit confirmed by the word and made
[1:09:03] manifest by the results it bears as
[1:09:05] surely as john needed to be in the
[1:09:08] spirit to receive these tremendous
[1:09:09] revelations fresh from jesus
[1:09:12] we need to be in the spirit in the in
[1:09:14] the spirit to understand the revelation
[1:09:17] that god has given to us to live by in
[1:09:20] his word for it is the same spirit one
[1:09:22] to the next
[1:09:25] this is patma's vision paragraph 40 or
[1:09:27] page 42 oh we need to get in the spirit
[1:09:31] and then things will be done don't go
[1:09:34] through the acts first
[1:09:37] acts means we come to church today
[1:09:42] right
[1:09:44] we come to church today that's the axe
[1:09:48] all right but what should we come to
[1:09:49] church for
[1:09:51] don't go through the acts first get in
[1:09:53] the spirit and then go through the acts
[1:09:54] and watch
[1:09:55] what god will do go ahead to the next
[1:09:57] one
[1:10:00] this is the fatma's vision going back to
[1:10:02] the church age part 6 1960. in the
[1:10:05] spirit of the lord's day we hear it now
[1:10:07] we hear it now what
[1:10:09] now what was he doing he was transferred
[1:10:11] from the aisle now in the spirit over
[1:10:14] into the lord's day and as soon as he
[1:10:16] got over into the lord's day he heard a
[1:10:19] trumpet what is it it's somebody
[1:10:21] approaching
[1:10:22] a great one's approaching
[1:10:24] trumpet sound somebody's coming
[1:10:26] he looked hallelujah
[1:10:28] it what then i'm out for an amiga this
[1:10:30] is the one on
[1:10:32] so watch before i show you anything
[1:10:38] now you ready
[1:10:40] before i show you anything
[1:10:45] i want you
[1:10:48] i want to let you know
[1:10:50] who i am
[1:10:56] now i'm coming back to the point i was
[1:10:59] trying to emphasize to start with
[1:11:03] in the book of revelation is god
[1:11:05] revealing himself
[1:11:10] to a church you know
[1:11:12] a distance away or something
[1:11:15] or is he revealing himself in the church
[1:11:20] my emphasis on this whole thing is he's
[1:11:22] revealing himself in the church
[1:11:24] he's revealing where he's at
[1:11:28] he's in the church he's in the bride
[1:11:30] not in the church there's a difference
[1:11:32] in the bride in the church
[1:11:33] let's see
[1:11:35] the church is going through the
[1:11:36] tribulation right with the bride ain't
[1:11:39] so there's a difference in it but he's
[1:11:41] using those words and what
[1:11:42] before i say show you anything i want to
[1:11:45] let you know who i am the greatest of
[1:11:48] all the revelation is the deity
[1:11:50] the supreme deity of our lord jesus
[1:11:52] christ you can't get to first base until
[1:11:55] you believe that and walk out
[1:11:59] so fine
[1:12:01] brother gary and i talking one day about
[1:12:02] something
[1:12:03] he said well i see that
[1:12:06] in us or something like that and i said
[1:12:08] brother here you can't do it you gotta
[1:12:09] see it in jesus first
[1:12:13] see we gotta see one true living god
[1:12:16] and jesus being that god
[1:12:18] all right
[1:12:19] but then because we when when we see who
[1:12:22] he is then he reveals where he's at
[1:12:24] right you realize the revelation brother
[1:12:26] callie of one god to you is god telling
[1:12:29] you where he's at
[1:12:32] i said it a moment ago you agreed with
[1:12:34] it in revelation this eternal word of
[1:12:36] god revealed how much more would you
[1:12:37] want than what something revealed to you
[1:12:43] see when it's revealed to you you don't
[1:12:45] have to worry about it amen
[1:12:47] right
[1:12:48] i know i should have done it on more and
[1:12:50] i just emphasized the point but
[1:12:52] i've looked for the lord to come every
[1:12:53] day i want him to come every day
[1:12:58] but when he revealed to me that we was
[1:13:00] missing on daniel 70 weeks the time of
[1:13:02] his coming
[1:13:04] that i began to preach that we could
[1:13:06] pass 77.
[1:13:12] you know i still that was 73 said before
[1:13:15] i was wanting to come
[1:13:16] but i was just saying it could be done
[1:13:19] but you know when he showed me that it
[1:13:21] could be done i should have said his
[1:13:22] stuff said the lord he can't come to
[1:13:24] life 77.
[1:13:26] that was the way i should have said it
[1:13:28] but i'm not that
[1:13:29] strong in what you think
[1:13:35] i still wanted it to come
[1:13:37] 72 73 74 75 i wanted him to come
[1:13:41] but i knew he didn't have to
[1:13:44] to fulfill the bible or the prophet's
[1:13:46] message
[1:13:48] so where the others were saying that he
[1:13:49] had to come i was saying he could
[1:13:52] be longer
[1:13:54] because he revealed it to me
[1:13:58] that he could pass there
[1:14:01] you ever got a revelation you stand by
[1:14:03] yourself
[1:14:05] you know and i'm honest and i'm not
[1:14:07] bragging just tell it like it is
[1:14:09] when i said that in 74 i stood by myself
[1:14:16] no
[1:14:19] and the richer them will hear that they
[1:14:21] know it's true but i didn't know them
[1:14:23] back then
[1:14:25] brother would've been them i got
[1:14:26] acquainted with them long and said
[1:14:27] before but had already preached it
[1:14:31] when i preached it to 57
[1:14:34] i stood by myself
[1:14:38] then my wife began to see and talk to me
[1:14:40] about it and
[1:14:45] then some people begin to catch on and
[1:14:48] listen a little
[1:14:50] and i stood by myself you tell me i
[1:14:52] didn't come show me you tell me anybody
[1:14:54] else that said it that way
[1:14:57] i know that don't fit good in your
[1:14:58] pocket
[1:15:00] but chew on it
[1:15:01] i've got the tapes to prove to what i
[1:15:03] preached
[1:15:06] and that's bragging on jesus christ
[1:15:10] for what he shows me
[1:15:13] i can't hit this he chose me to bring it
[1:15:17] that wasn't what i wanted i wanted it to
[1:15:19] be
[1:15:20] through anybody else
[1:15:23] but when you get a revelation
[1:15:29] now what was we read there the other day
[1:15:31] when the bride of christ gets a
[1:15:32] revelation of who she is
[1:15:35] and what she's here for
[1:15:37] that she'll be a super race
[1:15:40] a super people
[1:15:42] why because nobody can't argue with it
[1:15:49] i told you about when i told the the
[1:15:51] dream of anna and forrest being born
[1:15:56] way before that you know
[1:15:59] that there's even born
[1:16:02] the brother motors have a little boy and
[1:16:03] we'd have a girl she'd be back you know
[1:16:05] maybe six seven eight years old whatever
[1:16:08] and that was about 72
[1:16:11] and see everybody laughed at me said
[1:16:12] you're gonna miss the rapture
[1:16:14] because it had to be over in 73.
[1:16:18] i said i just tell him dream like a tree
[1:16:20] i saw
[1:16:22] a girl with a long black hair and a boy
[1:16:24] that brother mole was supposed to have a
[1:16:25] boy and was supposed to have a girl
[1:16:28] i just told her dream it's a dream
[1:16:32] but you see it to enterprise
[1:16:35] well
[1:16:37] it must have been something right
[1:16:41] well the reason is because it was
[1:16:44] the reason is because the bride ain't
[1:16:45] ready
[1:16:47] i mean that's the reason
[1:16:49] that's really got out of here you know
[1:16:51] what we ain't believing what god says
[1:16:52] about us
[1:16:56] we ain't believing what he says in his
[1:16:57] word
[1:16:58] when i read melancholy in malachi 4 told
[1:17:00] my wife that was in the badges where he
[1:17:02] joined the baptist church i said
[1:17:03] according to what the bible said there'd
[1:17:05] be two prophets coming for the end of
[1:17:06] the world i believe what it said
[1:17:10] but when brother mulch said malachi 4 i
[1:17:12] said what about malachi 3 who's that he
[1:17:14] explained john the baptist and brother
[1:17:15] brown's ministry and i said that settles
[1:17:17] that
[1:17:20] but you see i seemed by the bible that
[1:17:22] that was what it would take place
[1:17:24] the bible says there'd be pestilence
[1:17:26] like someone was talking the other day
[1:17:27] you know they said what kind of what
[1:17:29] kind of prayer could you pray
[1:17:32] is there any way that you could pray for
[1:17:34] the economy to straighten out
[1:17:41] now i want somebody to get in the bible
[1:17:43] with me i want you to talk in the bible
[1:17:44] with me i don't want your opinions
[1:17:49] pray for your economy to get
[1:17:50] straightened out
[1:17:52] right and that'll work that's right
[1:17:55] help
[1:17:56] you but you're praying contrary to the
[1:17:59] bible if you ask god to straighten out
[1:18:01] this economy and make it work
[1:18:06] you're praying contrary to the bible if
[1:18:08] you ask god to not bring pestilence and
[1:18:10] and things upon the earth because he
[1:18:12] said he was going to do it you can pray
[1:18:15] for god not to let it come on you and
[1:18:17] your family or whatever
[1:18:19] that's wonderful that's bible but you
[1:18:22] can't pray for god to change his mind
[1:18:24] about his word he's already said it's
[1:18:26] going to take place
[1:18:29] you can't pray for god to to straighten
[1:18:31] out all of this situation to the
[1:18:33] doctrines and the ideas of mankind
[1:18:35] because he said they would be here but
[1:18:37] you can pray for him to strengthen your
[1:18:39] and your ideals
[1:18:45] and that way the whole world can be
[1:18:46] falling apart and you can be flooding in
[1:18:48] money
[1:18:49] i mean that's just honestly that means
[1:18:52] because god can take care of you
[1:18:56] but you can't pray for those things to
[1:18:58] happen that's right lord
[1:19:00] we're going down here and pray for the
[1:19:02] empty hospital the prophet said it is
[1:19:04] not in the bible it won't work
[1:19:10] because god said there would be
[1:19:11] sicknesses and heartaches and troubles
[1:19:15] but you can pray for it to be straight
[1:19:17] in your life or your family or or
[1:19:19] whatever that's for somebody
[1:19:21] and god can honor that i hope you
[1:19:23] understand that don't blink off women
[1:19:25] when i said that while ago a lot of
[1:19:27] people do that when i say something
[1:19:28] their computer just shuts down and they
[1:19:30] don't even hear the rest of what i say
[1:19:33] you know the mind the computer
[1:19:37] but you see church
[1:19:41] we can
[1:19:42] let me ask you this way
[1:19:44] do you believe the bible says that there
[1:19:46] will be pestilence earthquakes
[1:19:49] great destruction come up on the earth
[1:19:51] do you believe that yes i am everybody
[1:19:53] believe that's what you mean
[1:19:57] now you shouldn't have done that
[1:19:59] i'm going to ask you another question
[1:20:05] do you believe the book of revelation
[1:20:07] shows you how perfect you are
[1:20:10] i got one yes and three or four nods
[1:20:13] not an amen
[1:20:15] okay
[1:20:19] now you see
[1:20:20] you believe this other part that's right
[1:20:23] but it brought it back personally
[1:20:27] see there's where we're missing the
[1:20:28] church
[1:20:31] we can read the bible and see all these
[1:20:33] things that take place and we know it
[1:20:34] well
[1:20:35] but when we read the bible it's telling
[1:20:37] us how perfect we are
[1:20:40] and that we're his body we're his people
[1:20:42] amen and then we
[1:20:45] down man
[1:20:48] well in a way
[1:20:51] i guess that could be right
[1:20:54] there ain't no in the way you're getting
[1:20:56] in the way
[1:20:57] when you're doing that
[1:21:00] when are we going to believe what god
[1:21:02] says come on music what are we going to
[1:21:03] believe
[1:21:05] we believe all the other
[1:21:08] we the people of this message puts her
[1:21:10] and come on now folks listen to what i'm
[1:21:12] saying they put their emphasis upon
[1:21:14] trying to prove brother branham as a
[1:21:15] prophet amen that's good right right
[1:21:19] but the same bible says you're perfect
[1:21:25] come
[1:21:26] on
[1:21:28] right
[1:21:30] the same bible tells you it shows you
[1:21:32] how pretty you are
[1:21:37] you're that beautiful
[1:21:39] that you
[1:21:40] are amen
[1:21:45] and what about it
[1:21:49] do we believe that
[1:21:51] go now if you believe one you gotta
[1:21:52] believe the other
[1:21:54] but if you deny one
[1:21:57] now quote the prophet you're denying the
[1:21:59] other
[1:22:02] if you deny that in god's eyes you're
[1:22:04] perfect
[1:22:05] then you deny the blood of jesus christ
[1:22:10] all right
[1:22:11] but brother dale i just got so many
[1:22:13] problems what's that got to do with it
[1:22:21] i got a lot of problems right i'm a
[1:22:22] human i've got a lot of problems i'm
[1:22:25] sorry she had hateful awareness
[1:22:28] but you know what my wife loves me
[1:22:32] she must she puts up with me
[1:22:38] so she's evidently looking over what i'm
[1:22:40] doing
[1:22:44] right
[1:22:48] you know that's where god is
[1:22:52] he ain't a dodio granddaddy
[1:22:55] he's a father
[1:22:57] let's say him again
[1:23:30] jesus is
[1:23:39] you see
[1:23:48] is
[1:24:08] is
[1:24:21] take away
[1:24:42] our little buddy is developing a
[1:24:44] coupling call
[1:24:46] nevermind about got it so we can
[1:24:48] sympathize with him
[1:24:50] and pray and believe
[1:24:53] you don't mean he's got to have it
[1:24:54] because the rest of us has got it
[1:25:04] we thank you lord jesus for touching our
[1:25:06] little body this little proof because
[1:25:09] the thing that is
[1:25:17] anybody else
[1:25:38] jesus
[1:25:47] why do you want him to come down here
[1:25:50] he's already down here
[1:26:06] you know brother rick they got him in
[1:26:08] jail
[1:26:11] it's not a sensible thing
[1:26:14] whether they trumped up the charges or
[1:26:15] whether they would guilty
[1:26:17] no problem
[1:26:19] you could face as much as 40 years
[1:26:25] because of the different accounts like
[1:26:27] four felonies or something like that
[1:26:29] five felonies
[1:26:31] he's one to get in ten years
[1:26:37] pray
[1:26:40] pray for his family his wife
[1:26:42] kids
[1:26:44] let's just pray
[1:26:46] let god
[1:26:48] come on the scene and work it out
[1:26:50] because he can work out things
[1:26:56] but you see we tried to get into that
[1:26:57] basis of trying to
[1:26:59] well he should have done this and he
[1:27:00] shouldn't have done that
[1:27:05] they say don't even pray in that way
[1:27:11] pray that god will come on the scene
[1:27:14] and touch the brother give our brother
[1:27:16] the words to be able to go to him and
[1:27:17] talk to him
[1:27:19] and pray that he can contact him or
[1:27:21] somebody that he can do
[1:27:26] but i've already told brother
[1:27:28] boyd this part
[1:27:29] he said something about it i'll be glad
[1:27:31] to go that maybe you know somebody from
[1:27:33] the church or minister could go
[1:27:35] and stand there with him at the the time
[1:27:37] of you know the
[1:27:39] um
[1:27:41] kind of in the sentence
[1:27:43] and i'll be glad to go
[1:27:46] and stand there and just say your honor
[1:27:48] i'm here to say he come to church for
[1:27:49] two years
[1:27:52] and i don't have any problems with him

[1:27:56] but i wouldn't lie and tell him that
[1:27:58] everything was perfect or whatever i
[1:28:00] just say your honor that's the way it
[1:28:01] stands
[1:28:03] you know

[1:28:32] to where you can do it

[1:28:40] it father it's not that satan has come
[1:28:43] in to take out one of our members
[1:28:47] because he's not gonna be able to take
[1:28:48] him out if
[1:28:49] we just hold on to you
