TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all right good morning everyone um boy the devil's been giving us a run for it this morning amen um let's go ahead and turn to Matthew chap 5 we''ve been reading all right Matthew chapter five so last time we we got to U we had finished about half of hunger and thirsting for righteousness and then I went back to meekness cuz meekness is um let's just kind of give let's let's read through these real quick just to refresh our memory we Matthew 5 verse1 seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven realizing that your righteousness is is filthy rag like Isaiah said blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted if you mourn for your condition and desire to se God's word fulfilled in your life then God will give you the comforter and comfort you blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth real meekness I believe is when you can pick up the message and and say this this man knows what he's talking about this is these are the words this is the word of life we same thing when you pick up the Bible and you don't argue over the scripture anymore but it becomes real to you blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled and that's what we're going to talk about today so we summarize all these we want to find out last time we kind of talked about what hungering and thirsting is and now we're going to kind of get into what righteousness is and I'm going to go ahead and Skip ahead and tell you the whole lesson that righteousness is his word and be we hungering and if you hunger and thirst to see God's word made manifest in your life and there's a promise that it will be fulfilled you can stretch that word fill out to fulfill that his word will be fulfilled in your life all the promises that were spoken through scripture uh that's that's what we're here for it uh there's so many people in the in the in the world today that don't really understand what their purpose in life is and kind of go through life um Meandering not knowing where they're where they're going or where they're coming from and but we're so blessed to be able to um to know what our purpose in life is and where we're going so what is righteousness we looked at this slide last time um in the Old Testament the word c rightwise in mtis said one this is his interpretation of right just U mtis was a um he's kind of a regarded as a famous Jewish scholar that the Jews highly regard what he has to say and he said one whose Merit surpasses his iniquity is a sodic and tend to um kind of coin the word righteousness and use it in the New Testament to translate um holy people holy conformed to the will of God and there's only righteousness is the only thing that uh that is acceptable to God and God looks at us think like a mirror he's got to look at us and see himself reflected back the only thing that will be right is God's is God's word fulfilled in us so I just put a few scriptures down what is righteousness let's kind of take a little bit just to slowly go through these in Matthew 5:20 Jesus said for I say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven now the scribes and Pharisees obeyed the the law but what God's requirement is is to see his word made manifest in you right acts 10:34 35 then Peter opened his mouth and said of of a truth I perceive that God is no respector of persons but in every nation he that fearth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him in Romans 1:17 for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written just shall live by faith we know that faith is a revelation just like down Through the Ages from from the Revelation that Luther had that the just shall live by faith to the Revelation that John Wesley had that our lives must be holy and cleansed now we've come to from Faith to Faith that God's word in this day can be completely um to is totally un unveil and we can have a complete understanding from the beginning from Genesis to Revelation that and then what's the ultimate goal of is not just to say I know all these secrets but it's to have your life changeed that's where I'm getting to is to is it it's not just speaking words but it's to have God's life in you revealed if it doesn't change our life then that's the goal in 1 John 3:10 and this is the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother it's the life life behind the name is what makes the demons tremble so let's look at Romans chapter 10 let's start at verse one Brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved for I bear them record that they have a Zeal of God but not according to in knowledge mhm for they being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted unto the righteousness of God for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth for Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall Ascend into heaven that that is to bring Christ down from above or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up Christ again from the dead what sayith that the word is n the even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which be preached that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with a heart man believeth unto righteousness and with a mouth confession is made unto salvation so if the only thing that's acceptable to God is himself revealed in you his word and and uh you must confess it is it interesting that you've got to confess it and you know the the word that this the term the word is maybe one of the most difficult to um Concepts to maybe explain but it's interesting that you got to confess it because the word is the manifestation of what's inside of you when you have whatever is inside is sooner or later going to come out when you say when you say I I believe what the prophet said butt when you put a little butt on it it shows there's something something missing on the inside it's not in in lining up with God's word think about the word is if if I'm thinking something in my mind there's no way for you to to have uh there's no way for you to know what's inside of my heart until I speak it that's what the word is it's the manifestation of God's attributes the the uh God manifest manifesting himself so let's um I have a just a quote here the sudden secret going away of the church brother ROM said and each night the conversation would be that going to Vamp this young man and marry and who would then they would own the r themselves for the sun would fall air to fall so they made themselves ready so you see there's a ready to be made you make yourself ready by joining church or something that ain't all that's required you got to have oil in your lamp see just you're dressing saying we'll build a big church we belong to a better denomination we'll give them a pip org to the Lord we'll make plush seats that isn't what God requires righteousness is what God requires of his son Christ Jesus that's the garments for the Bible said the white clothes she is adorned in is the righteousness of the Saints now let's look at Matthew 3 this is a beautiful story now I want to read um from verse um let's let's start at verse one cuz I want to kind of point out that John knew who he was and what he was there for in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying repent ye for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord make his path straight and the same John had his rment of camel's hair and a Lea G about his loins and his meat was Locust and wild honey then went out to to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region round about Jordan and were baptized with him in Jordan confessing their sins but when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them oh generation of viers who warn you flee from the Wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits meat for repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have Abraham to Our Father for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children of Abraham and now also the ACT is laid under the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is HED down and cast into the fire I indeed baptize you with water under repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost into the fire so John knew what he was doing there and he knew what the one that was coming after him was going to do he knew he was there to introduce the Messiah that he was coming whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purch his FL and gather his weed into the GN but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan un John to be baptized with him but John forbade him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me and Jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and we read last time in Exodus how why Jesus had to be baptized to um to fulfill all the word that was spoken of him and this speaks of the the bride today we're supposed to know exactly what we're here for we're supposed to we're supposed to be a reflection of God's word God all the all of the scripture in the whole Bible that that speak leading up to this day we're supposed to um eat it up take it in fill it out fulfill every word until the last scripture the the last promise that we'll take a body change just will Fu us um and uh keep what is righteousness and it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness brother man said um let's see where I want to start let's start right here you know who I am because God and L has told you to be a sign call me and you've already bore witness of it and you know it we know who each other are we know each other and it's true that you need to be baptized in me but let's suffer that to be so for John if we are the lights of this day we must fulfill fill all righteousness all God's word must be fulfilled by us for this day for it is becoming to us behing is becoming as like us for if we are the true Witnesses of God today we are the liks of this age and if we are the liks of this age there some of the scripture that's got to be fulfilled during this age and it's up to us it's up to us to see that God all God's righteousness is is fulfilled and what is his righteousness his word right and it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness he said um God wants men and women who will stand and fulfill all righteousness of course righteousness is his word it becometh us to fulfill all rightous 61 it said the words all the words got to be fulfilled the last paragraph the line of every age should do the same thing we know what's to be fulfilled you who are spiritual and know the word of God you see what God has promised now the word will not come just easy but it comes by observation you got to press your way in do it but yet it beh behoveth us it is is becoming for to us to fulfill all God's righteousness we must do it so blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after seeing God's word fulfilled in our life for they shall be filled it's a promise that you'll get the Holy Ghost and after you get the Holy Ghost it's a promise that moving on up to stature of the perfect man moving through God's promises every promise in the Bible will be fulfilled if you look at any it's a promise that unlike Eve and the in Genesis who couldn't take all of God's word there's going to be somebody in this day that will take every every scripture and say I believe it and make it manifest in their life every every promise of God in the Bible we can say Amen to that's why it's it's confession is so much a part of it because you can't if you believe it out of your mouth will come the confession that that is what's in my heart to manifest what's what's inside what is the word let's look at Matthew 26 now my point here is a lot of times we um the the word being made manifest is God's life in you God's life being revealed in you a lot of times we kind of get off of that a little bit and think that U God's the be the word being revealed in you is be able to um uh say what other people expect you to say or um just be able to um uh pray long prayers or or uh do things that uh well let's maybe it'll be clear once we read this cuz I think this shows this is just this is really amazing Matthew 2631 through 35 then saith Jesus unto them after the the the Passover they taken the Lord's supper and sayth Jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written I will Smite the shepher and and the sheep or the flock shall be scattered abroad he's prophesying what's about to happen he's going to die to die for our sins and the disciples will um not having yet the baptism of the Holy Ghost that going to be scattered abroad wondering what has happened not sure what's what's taking place but after I am risen again I will go before you into Galilee and Peter answered and said unto him what seemed to be what what would seem to be uh righteous testimony what would seem to be acceptable to anybody that would listen what that was over here in this conversation Peter answered and said unto him although all men should be offended of thee yet will I never be offended and it sounded good but it was just the word is not just words it's the life in you revealed and in this case Peter just had he didn't have the word in his life back in up the words that he said so that's that's my point is the um it's not enough just to be able to to repeat after someone to say the same thing that they did but you got to have the word made manifest in your life that's what righteousness is is not just saying repeating what the Bible said repeating what somebody else said or doing something because you think that would be acceptable to man or to man's ears Jesus said unto them the next verse well let's go back read that again Peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will I never be offended Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee that this night before the crew Thou shalt deny me Thrice Peter said unto him now now Jesus was the word made manifest all of the scriptures what he was fulfilling everything that was in the mind of God all of the the love everything was made manifest right there before him and the word had just spoken verely I say unto thee that this night before the cre Thou shalt deny me thri and right after that Peter said unto him though I should die with thee yet will I not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples it wasn't just Peter it was all the disciples they all made a confession that that their what was inside of them couldn't back up right so now let's do I I have it on the screen so you don't have to turn there Luke 52123 and this is when Jesus was preaching in the synagogue and they had lowered the man down into be that was sick and lame they lowered him down so that Jesus could pray for him and he he told the man I for all your sins are forgiven and the scribes and Pharisees began to say who can forgive sins but God Luke 5: 21:23 and the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but God Alone Now Jesus says you think that's amazing let me let me show you something a little bit greater when Jesus perceived their thoughts he answered and said unto them what reason ye in your hearts whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee which according to the scribes and Pharisees by their own mouth only God can forgive sins he said which is easier thy sins be forgiven thee or the say rise up and walk y cuz if you can say rise up and walk it's only God being made manifest that can do that so now let's turn to acts three and I've got a picture of what the gate beautiful look like as you go into the inner Court of the temple now before Peter only had he was just repeating what he thought would sound good he just he couldn't back it up with his life but now after the day of Pentecost acts 3:1 now Peter and John went up together into the temple at The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour and a certain man lay from his mother's womb was carried whom they laid daily at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful and laid him right there because that's where all of the people that should be having fellowship with God were going in they should have had they should have like expecting all of the people that went up this gate to have to uh to have a relationship with God and then came two people that really did have a relationship with God a certain man lay from his mother's wom was carried whom they laid down at the Gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask arms of them that entered into the temple who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple ask the arms and Peter fastening his eyes upon him with John said look on us and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have give I Thee and the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk so nobody can say rise up and walk except God being made manifest in you that's my point the life of God being made manifest in you is what righteousness is hungering and thirsty this is a Psalm that David wrote A Psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see what's he longing for so that he can have a lot of words to to impress people to um but but it's not just vain words but it's the life made manifest in you to see thy power and thy Glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall pray thee 1 Corinthians 23:5 and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling in my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of his spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God and what's the power of God power the power well let's read John 1:11 he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received unto them gave you power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name and this power to live a Christian Life is is such a it's so much greater than any word you could say remember that the test testimony that brother Brandon told of the little lady that um her husband was drunk and uh she they they were making fun of her and everything and they went out and just heard her in in there sweeping the floor and saying that singing that song uh must Jesus bear the cross alone and she didn't say one word but her life was a greater testimony than all of the all of the sermons all of the uh expounding scripture saying let me tell you how much I know her life was what brought them to the Lord and I uh when we were at uh brother Tim hes church last um Sunday George Smith was kind of telling how he came into the message a little bit and it I found it striking that he said more than all the signs and wonders and everything what really pulled him to the message was looking at brother Brandon's life how he didn't have some a bunch of slaves washing his car or just how he treated his wife and how he treated his family and how he treated the people in his church that's the life that is the righteousness of God made manifest and the only way that you can have you can you can Manu try to manufacture something like Peter did saying something that his word couldn't back up when the word is made manifest in you it won't be made manufactured anymore the word is life there's a man here that can turn on the light 1963 just think the old husk of yesterday see don't point PL it back there it's rotten it cannot cannot stay with it no sir it will not do no good it won't grow it's off of the life and the word is the life that's right the word expressed in the Ephesian Church age he said God's intention for his creation man is to express his words in Genesis Adam was given the word to live by life live by the word would be the word expressed and down at the bottom and on the tree he received the wounds andto death that we by him and because of him might eat of the tree of life and in that life freely given would enable us to overcome and express the word of God Amen and uh I just just as a little exercise I just compiled a little short list of the scriptures that uh the promises of God to fulfill all righteousness let's just real quick go through some of these Psalms 10312 let's as far as the East is from the West so far have he removed our transgressions from us and all these promises that in this day we're fulfilling 1 John 1:9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness acts 2:39 for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call as we read I'm reading through this we can say Amen to every one of these words if you read any of these scriptures and say yeah but the promises unto you and your children but maybe not mine something inside needs to be protected Philippians 46:7 be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God and the peace of God which pass passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus that's the promise of the Peace of God Malachi 3:10 bring ye all the ties in the storehouse that there might be meat there may be meat in mine house and prove me now there with sayith the Lord of hosts the I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out of blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it 1 John 5:4 to5 for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God James 478 submit yourself therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you Sinners and purify your heart ye double minded 1 Corinthians 15:53 54 for this corruptible must put on incorruption mhm and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall had put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory and that's what I'm looking for all right let's stop amen
