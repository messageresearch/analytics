we still read the same scripture first Peter one and then we'll go to second Peter one brother George Quinn sent us a note and said he got home I think yesterday but anyhow said he got home safely I think everybody for praying for him and the fellowship at the times we had together he said he really enjoyed it so we appreciate that just amen miss Pratt the Lord would bless him now as he begins and goes on and makes plans to travel and go fellowship with the other brothers we had a good time with all of the ministry brother and we've enjoyed having them come by and minister for us and gave a little relaxation time for us to where we could you know do but now we're back in time so let's get started them be right in the Lord amen any announcements that we need to make first Peter and then second Peter a father we thank you for your grace and love Lord thank you for all the things that you've given unto us Lord we know and understand that they're given freely we didn't have to do anything to get them or any rewards that we would have it would be nothing at all because of you and just have your way Lord and speak to our hearts and your love and let your understanding goddess keep us Lord and just bless each one just remember the stick among us remember that the different ones remember the families are of the loss of the little baby and just right the Lord would would be with them and everything and comfort them just have you wait as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts because that's our desire more anything else it's just to be a vessel to be used for you in your honor and glory we love you and we thank you in Jesus name first Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see if you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever alright let's go then to 2nd Peter one will begin verse 1 Simon Peter servant and apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge into knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity amen you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word and I hope that your thoughts has been enhanced some because some of the Brethren came right down the same line and the thoughts and things that we were trying to bring you know and maybe it hope you know would help us to understand and open up or understand the word because we believe faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word amen all right now we are talking about the stature of a perfect man and knowing for a surety that these things that we read of that we read here in the scripture if it was not necessary for someone then it would never have been written in the Word of God all right and we believe that this is the final age the winding up of all things so everything would wind up in this age and be made manifest by this endtime people to bring forth you know whatever is for the day an hour which is really to finish up all things and then you know bring it to a completion bring it to a finished product that we could see the day in the hour that we're living now we talked about and we you know as message believers we're talking about say the faith of the fathers and and all like that we we've mentioned that a lot maybe in the messages and what is that that is the revelation of Jesus Christ that was given to the Apostles and as we covered our in a message or so that this Peter is writing the word you know this is the writing of the word where we were reading of the first Peter second Peter order that's the writing of the word of God all right and then bringing forth the things that God says we must have all right and seeing that then we we realized something has to take place because if God requires as one of the brothers was talking there in the message of be therefore perfect you know if God requires perfection then he has to bring it alright if he requires these virtues to be in the bride in the end time then he will provide a way and he has he's provided the message to be brought unto us that we can read the message and study it and read the Bible and do and you know as I was bringing out in one of the messages or the other day the Prophet never came to bring us a different Bible or this that or the other he came to turn our hearts back to the original Word it's not another Bible it's not an edition it's not something extra you know added it is the Word of God for the day and the time all right and then seeing this would be the hour that we're living then these virtues would be required in this age may be not required in other ages coming down because of the loss of the word you know the the point of were that the bugs ate it down and in losing the revealed word that the original apostles came out with but we were promised in this day tuber to bring forth you know that God would restore those things to you and I all right so then the faith of the fathers has got to be restored and see you'd say what do we need that well now don't guess we do if we're going by the grave did that get through we don't need it if we're going by the grave if we're gonna miss this all right we don't need it no no just eat drink and be merry to have a good time you know what you see for forty over almost fifty years I've preached on this thought an idea that this of the writing here if God required it number one he'd supply the wafer to be done right to bring it forth and number two it would have to be brought forth because he said it would all right and when God says something we can depend upon that to be able to walk in the light of his word paragraph 148 statue of a perfect man brother Brennan said that the disciple had these virtues these qualities and things and said they had the least little nod from God to know what God wanted and see they needed that little nod from God to write the word because that's what they were doing they were actually in the time of the writing of the scriptures so you can say well now Jesus done this but see he didn't he didn't write the things that the disciples brought sure he brought the word which is all of the word in his message but the disciples then begin to bring forth the word to us to help us to see and understand where we're to live in what were to do alright so then it's in this age as I said maybe not down through the time of the Dark Ages and Luther Wesley and Pentecost etc they were required to have a new birth all right they require death and they received that okay they had their day they had their time okay you know that's well and good but now you and I have to have our day and it's time and to recognize the word for this hour is the unveiling of all of the Word of God right it's to bring forth all the Word of God in this age and that's why God had to send a prophet to bring it forth to us that we would have these things and we've been through that as to how do we get these virtues we've been through that over and over on 327 Church age book this messenger Malachi 4 look at 17:30 we'll do two things 1 turn the hearts of the children back to faith of the father's you know and and reveal the thunders which is a revelation contained in the seven sealed it be these divinely revealed that mystery truths that literally turn us back all right and see then God sent the Prophet with the message we believe that okay then he said in his word that the fivefold ministry would be for the perfecting of the saints or you know as the Prophet said in the in the statute of perfect man are they bringing forth of these things all right so now God has given us then the message and then we've had 50 years almost from the time of the passing of the prophet for the bride to be able to walk in the light of the word and to understand and he gave us a fivefold ministry not a onefold there is no such thing in the Bible as to try to find a onefold no what would you fold you know I mean you just take that one that would just be round it wouldn't fold right I mean that's silly but it's truth there's a five fold ministry for the perfecting or the bringing of these things all right so we've had 50 years to preach on it and I don't back up no way I said all he just said no there's people sitting here that's been here almost the 50 years that we've been 40 some years and they know that this is what I've been teaching all of the time the statue of a perfect man the growth development the adoptions the things that you and I would have to have all right and in doing that see it would be a requirement now listen to where we we stopped off for a long time ago but just go ahead brothers and pull up number one on the only there's notes and let's just read a little bit and listen to what he's saying and see whether it's very important that you and I understand okay go ahead and roll it up to the to the now what but each age God has placed these things into his church now listen and pattern it by showing that each individual has these things possesses these qualities and wants it and this being when it's completed is the Church of God the church now watch it this being this stature of a perfect man this being when it's completed is the Church of God going in the rapture now listen going to rapture and this being what's it now now that's the church that's the whole all the ages that's everything now what and this being and completed is the servant of God in the Church of God that's going in the rapture see what I mean there you are there's the full thing all right now so then this would be pointing to this age because this is the age of the finish so now looking at the church as a whole this is the seventh church age this is the life stage all right so this is the age of the rapture the rapture the rapture is going to come in the 7th church age all right because they're not in a church age we'll get to that another couple of messages on the thought all right but now so within this church this this Church of God no not the name of God you know like congregational holiness or whatever it is you know no this bride of Jesus Christ all right the Church of the Living God has got to have these virtues to go in a rapture well you say well brother Dale down to the ages they didn't have it you just said they didn't that's exactly right so the Bible's right they without us cannot be Hebrews 4 11:40 they without us cannot be made perfect or complete are finished are come to full stature alright so this is the age this is the age that the message came this is the age that God has predestinated a group of people and a fivefold ministry to bring the Word of God all right so you know of course you've got all this going now around the country you know about playing the tapes and everything else you know and all that that's their business that ain't nothing to me I just can't find that in the Bible that the playing of the tapes is for the perfecting of the science if you find out you come and tell me all right I can find where it says the fivefold ministry Hope over but brother Dale everybody believes the fivefold ministry oh that's a way of believing in the fivefold ministry that you can bypass everything so you can say I believe in if I fold ministry yeah but I think the fivefold ministry supposed to play the tapes so you don't put those two dollars into understanding you just put the will of the brother or just eternal said they believe in the fivefold ministry yeah but you don't put the other with it because the other relates to it just play the tapes well thank God praise God glory hallelujah we play the tapes we listen to the Word of God amen if you don't play the tape listen to the Word of God then you're starving your own self to death and don't tell me you're going into change don't tell me your rapture buy them because what everybody say oh boy glory hallelujah we're hearing rats we just waiting on that final one see that we find it well praise God the brother branham's just said that they'd be a church that would go in the rapture then he said there's individuals that will make up that Church in other words that will go in the rapture all right and see if they're going in the rapture the servant of God that's going in to rapture what is he referring to why would he be referring because every age goes in the rapture there's a there's a bride of every age every age has a group of people that will go in the rapture but why would the Scriptures say they without us cannot be made perfect why would the Prophet emphasize this is the church that's going in the rapture and these are the individuals that's going in the right that has these virtues what about those that don't have these virtues or didn't get these virtually because it died and went into the ground are they gonna be sit come on now get it to the right understanding Peter of them had the Word of God right Satan come in and pervert it and pulled it down but Martin Luther started out with a new birth and he's part of the Church of the Living God and he will go in the rapture one day Wesly Pentecost whatever you know they will go in the rapture of being the bride of that age but they're waiting on somebody to attain to a position what waiting on somebody to receive these virtues all right now listen to what I'm saying you can just you can do not like what I say or whatever but I try my best this be as straight as I can in that way you don't you can't you don't walk and tell nobody I don't know what he's talking about well boys you in bad shape you don't know what I'm talking about because I plain about what I'm talking about you know there's not going to be now here's no brother Dale okay there's not going to be a bride to go in a rapture unless the end time reaches the stature of a perfect man now let's get another one code we're gonna read the next quote there's not going to be a resurrection unless somebody attains to the position of these virtues yeah but brother Dale you're making yeah I'm a just I'm not saying this I'm reading what he said I mean have I become your enemy because I found the quote God I found the prophet says this what brother Dale you just try to be fine oh okay I'm trying to be what I am go ahead to the let's see go ahead do the same quote we were using it's just on down all right so then what does he go to and say now listen to it 367 paragraph their stature of perfect man you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us okay so this church has got to come to perfection now that was paragraph 354 that we were just on about possessing in the church to go in the rapture and the individual this is paragraph 364 67 they just moved over a little bit so read it so this church has gotta come to a perfection in order to bring the resurrection there under souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to its perfection that when Christ does come in this church you see is coming smaller into minority that one refers to the chart war it's a whole lot sharper than that but that's just to write that roaster to come up to the needle point and place and it coming up when the headstone comes now watch what is business and when it comes this church has got to be honed all these rest of the stones in the pyramid are laying so perfectly - you can't run a razor blade what's he talking about the stature of a perfect man is the honing of the church right it'll have to be so perfectly like Christ still when he comes he and that ministry will fit right smack together then will come the rapture that won't home now that's what your prophet is saying in the stature of a perfect man that we've asked you to read and study it see then he's explaining the whole thing there's not going to be a rapture unless somebody reaches the position of these virtues into manifestation I don't mind saying that cuz that's what he just said there's not going to be a resurrection now remember see we don't think about it a lot of things but remember in the Bible that's why I quit years ago looking for a rapture there because that ain't biblical that ain't Scripture scripturally it's what resurrection comes first then rapture comes after resurrection is that scripture Lord himself shall descend heaven with us not boys market don't God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we were to rob and remain unto the coming of the Lord then it'll be changed that's Bible so we need to look for a resurrection then the Prophet we just read it the church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection the church has got to come to perfect how is that coming to perfection the statue of a perfect man coming to perfection to bring a resurrection so it's dependent on you and me it's totally dependent on whether or not we can become what God says we will and you know don't worry about if somebody will but now that's our choice to make ourselves a part of it things I'm saying our moment ago why would he put rapture into that I can follow resurrection because it comes fir but then he would take rapture and put it right in it that there's not going to be a rapture on this block that somebody becomes the stature of a perfect man why would you call it rapture when we know every body and every age will go in a rapture right but just remember one time there's not going to be a change the moment the twinkling of an eye can I restate it there's not going to be a change in a moment in the twinkling of an eye unless somebody comes to that position well I just don't see that okay that does that change it and stop it from being true have I read to you out of this series in trying to study the stature of a perfect man have I read to you what the Prophet said well then it's not what I'm saying you know what you're trying to interpret it I don't know how to interpret all that gotta do is read it you don't need interpreting he's reading he needs believing where's the interpretation would have to be to the point to where he was said in other words plain language is not going to be a rapture unless somebody has these virtues is that what we just read there's not going to be a resurrection unless somebody the church has got to come to perfection all right why the end we have any problem will not believe what he's saying it'll have to be so perfectly like Christ to when he comes he and that ministry will fit right smack together see then will come the rapture the going home now we've already had the Ministry of Malachi for right you agree we've had the Ministry of Malachi 4:2 the perfection so then what are we waiting on we're waiting on somebody to believe it accept it and think about it as being for them is that true then see then you see one that I'm so hard about the way that I try to bring things because it's not whether or not what that's the way you think I think it's this way well what you thinking what I think ain't got nothing to do with it it's what God said it right he said they would be a bride he said now throughout the scripture pointing that they'd be a bride --it they'd be a resurrection that they'd be a rapture so he's gonna have to provide the way to be done so he has he brought us the message he brought the Prophet now he's got the fivefold ministry to take that from taught to prophetess brought and I preached it over and over to you not that the fivefold ministry is gonna get anything different no Kuster five full minutes don't even have a message you didn't listen when I said dad you don't listen to those statements they don't have a man I don't have a message brother don't know I only can have what they've already brought those prior to me has already brought it why do I need a message I need a quickening of the message to the word to be made alive to me that I can believe myself where I'm standing in what's going on right but there's nothing - looking for another message to come uh-huh see that's where you're wrong well brother so and so he gives in we're losing we'll go with brother so-and-so the only thing I've ever said is you're getting older I'm getting older if they somebody else supposed to lead this thing oh we need to find out who it is and get Go Go we're getting older right we'll see I don't worry about it I believe the message that has already been brought that's why for over 40 years I've stood in hollered about this message well brother Daniel we've gotten brother so-and-so he hollered at 40 years now he's gone what are you doing wishing I go hit is that the point what's the point of saying it well they stay quit no they didn't stay with there's something wrong with them all alone now you can't tell me that so don't even talk to me about don't tell me brother so-and-so spent 40 years preaching this message to the word the letter and the truth of it and brought it right and then went off of it I'm gonna tell you I don't believe you I don't tell you I don't believe you wouldn't know though they had something wrong all the way down through that right you want to name a few of them and then we'll get started on it they had things wrong to start with right they had their own ideas and thoughts to start with they didn't follow the prophets message because if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's it's impossible for you to turn against this message I don't care who you are you just didn't have it to start with why not admit it like I said the other day I listen to these messages two or three times since I've kind of been on vacation I listen to my own self but I was talking about these people what are they going to convert us to you know somebody come along tell you this profit is wrong what are they trying to convert us to they're trying to convert us to them come on wake up then you don't pittypat well the brother defect is his way of seeing it we just supposed to love him and you got nothing to do with it I like what wasn't said you know what listen let me get talking about the love how it was he's supposed to love me just as much if you differ with me if you do if you don't differ women that's not exactly the quote with the point well you know that's easy if you didn't love me to start with okay you get it if you didn't love me to start with you ain't got no problems you just say I don't like it listen Church I think it's time for us to root to get down into and walk in the light of the love of God and tell all this junk that's floating around it to go peddle it some words out you know I mean you know come on all right so we've been through these things and we've come up and that was just a point I wanted to inject because I've tried to emphasize that in the message that we must have these virtues to make a change or the body and by making the change of the body will make the way for the perfection for the others to come forth so that means resurrection comes first the resurrection is dependent upon you right it's dependent upon you and me we'll see then let's get down to our part or at least admit it's that well hey looks like we don't have nothing if we can't even agree with the Prophet we surely don't have nothing and he was the one that said that these people this church would go in the rapture this individual person that would come to these virtues would be the one that would go in the change of the body of the rapture and he says that would be in the resurrection would be because of the people of this message that has become the statue of a perfect man but you see that's where we take all of that things you know well I just don't see it we'll see that's what that's not what you're looking at you're not looking in the right order I preached a whole service into that trying my best and crying out in my heart to get you to see one time we were supposed to been Christians for we ever heard of the Prophet if we had the new birth the Prophet didn't have to come to teach the people that already had the new birth that it was wrong to sin I'm glad the Prophet Cohn showed us on the straighten us out on adultery and straighten us out on on killing and murderers and all these things and I'm glad he come and straitness out on all that my lord he didn't have to come to straighten that the new birth was supposed to straighten out a lot in our hearts and lives when the Prophet come well we found out it was wrong to cut her the Bible said it was wrong what was the problem we didn't believe it then we don't believe it now that's the problem well you just don't understand this and that's what I'm say it we didn't believe it back then we don't believe it now that's our problem lip service is one thing but serving God is another thing don't you think it's time to start settling down and serving God you so well we've got these problems well see you don't like for me to talk well brother then we just got these problems we're gonna be human until the change comes the Prophet said we're gonna be stickers till the change come now you say you try just fast we don't know no no no I'm telling you the truth is that what he said did he say we would be stickers as long as we were in these flesh well I'd he's the one that done it not me well brother though I think you're trying to put it work we can just live like the devil huh no that wouldn't dare when I was in the Baptist Church so let's don't start on it now you see Church I'm trying to get me and you to a point this message brought to the people and revealed to the people is to bring us to a change is that true a lot see then it's not waiting on something of this that or the other it's settled in Christ and the only thing that I've ever said about anything and I'm playing blunt and plummeting but you say I'm waiting on the bus to pull up now you can aim that bus anything you want to return ministries tents or whatever you can name anything you won't do that's your business because I've never been but one time you can't get on the bus at the airport the bus don't go to the airport the bus goes to the bus station so get word about station now not is that simple is that hard is that contrary is that arrogance are hateful no so why is it if this message is to bring us a change was any problem about spraying them studying and reading it we have a Bible study the first Saturday of every month we have a pretty good attendance we have a pretty good attendance but a lot of you don't come well I ain't got time you got time to go to Walmart you got time to go everywhere there you got time to do everything else but you ain't got time to come and sit down talk about the word that's your business well you think we ought to be here no I'm not telling you anything you always say it they shouldn't be that I would say it you ought to say it and if you don't say it then I doubt your new birth okay brother Dale wasn't lying why go we do all we try to that we can to have services and things for you to come and the Bible study is one time you can come and bring up anything you want to and we'll discuss that and we've spend two hours discussing them wait okay what of me you done made you excuse okay all right go with it now where did we come up to so we come through knowing that we have to how these virtues so we have faith and be born again and then we must have virtue added to the faith and it must be the same kind of faith you know must be the virtue must be the same kind of Revelation as the original birth because when you start talking about as we did on the last one or so they're about the vulcanizing the material that you don't vulcanize a piece of wood you know or a piece of leather or something like that to an iron piece it won't work it's got to be the same material so the new birth is faith the born-again experience the revelation of Jesus Christ the Prophet says Christ to the mystery of God revealed what is the new birth he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally do you know that's the new birth all right so what would be virtue then it would have to be the virtues of Almighty God to be given to us it's the virtue the knowledge the temperance all of that is God's virtues to be given to you and I to cool in our faith right and see then the virtues got to be the same material it's more of the new birth it's more of the growth in God it's more of the understanding of the word of God what is knowledge now remember we just finished that what is knowledge it's not head knowledge remember virtue we spent the time on that the Prophet said now and what would he emphasized stuff like that why would he make the statement he said not virtue he said that's that's not living a virgin life he says not in this case is he against living a virgin life no what was he doing trying to give us understanding of what the stature of a perfect land is to be poor takers of his divine nature and his divine nature would be his virtue his strength his power his life given unto each and every one of us that would be the virtue he's talking about that would be why he wouldn't be saying now not not to live a virgin I said not in this case he's emphasizing what is it meant like I said you could be a virgin being mean as a rattlesnake but get born again get born again it'll take care of every time then he can add his virtue to you and I and his knowledge it's not net it's not human knowledge it's not a matter of it's not Webster's definition of knowledge it's the Holy Ghost definition of faith which means the new birth right the Holy Ghost understanding of virtue that it means to live a a good Christian life to be a virtuous Christian to walk in the light of the love of God not just because you'd say well well I you know I need a I I'm not a virgin so I can't fit into this thing there's where you're misunderstanding if you get down to what the new birth is you might find out a lot of things and it's taken care of in our lives in the new world but it's holy ghost' knowledge it's holy ghost' virtue it's not the virtues of a human being in the point of just some virtues that we have it's a virtuous life of Christ living in each one of us and the knowledge what is knowledge is holy ghost knowledge it's not head knowledge it's not how much you know how much you've read or study it's how much is revealed to us because that's the only knowledge that is worth anything is holy ghost knowledge there's people that can quote you the Bible verbatim but that's hidden homage you remember the Prophet and what he brought about he said that's a nature given a nature given thing statue of perfect man and blasphemous names both let me covered it if you'll read it a nature given virtue is not what God is talking about a nature given knowledge is not what God's talking about that won't change nothing that just builds your knowledge puffeth up the scriptures it what holy ghost knowledge does it puffier no no no no no no that's not what it's saying right natural human knowledge purpose you up holy ghost knowledge we'll take you down so then what are we talking about these virtues these virtues our Holy Ghost virtues given to you and I to place upon our faith which is a Holy Ghost faith it's his faith given to you then it belongs to you now it's your faith cuz he gave it to you right now it's his virtue given to you to place on his faith which is your faith each one of them is God giving to you and I what he's doing because of our growth development in the word all right now but in it's so odd that a prophet would would cover like we went through with virtue how that he was covering that you know and he was saying he said now that's not the word here so now I don't care about your definition well president I looked at Virgil how Lord it means no I looked at what the Prophet said it meant you go what you think it means and I'm gonna go with what I believe the Prophet says it did right because he's the one supposed to be giving us the definition right now so is it when we come to this next one which is difference in difference definition to the natural Webster point goes back to a point of showing you that you don't suppose to drink alcohol that's what we know we use as the word temperance the Prophet said that doesn't mean that in this case so there's a different definition from what the Prophet could bring to you and I then what the literal wording is bringing to us right the literal wording of the Bible is talking about how is it Oh about the Antichrist let's see how is that statement I'll get it in a minute but anyhow deal ah little random tells you that the the ends and the buts and the Bible's in the right place right now what are you gonna do with this one he said but where it says the where it says a lie it should have been translated deal I now he's the one son told you the ends of the books in the right place right now he just changed the word right he changed it from a which could be anything to thee which is a singular the same lie that he told even the garden is the same lie he telling you and I right now right now did he change that or did he give us the recurrent definition he physically changed to read the word right from A to B then he looked like he condemned his own self because he said you can't change nothing well then he wasn't changing it to make it be anything never he was emphasizing the way that it's brought that it should be bringing D because D is a singular point and it's the same lie all the way through right then he hasn't changed the word no that the ends and the bus is in the still in the same place the right place he'd just given you a better definition when he says virtue and he says that's not drinking alcohol he's just giving us the Bible terminologies of Christianity they're not not temperance temperance coming unloads in it virtue and temperance there's two different two words that he changed both words right he changed to virtue and said it's not being a virgin life so that evidently is not what God was writing there I don't care if man wrote it down a dozen times he's telling us what God is saying temperance is not to stop drinking alcohol what is it it's the controlling of that temper now here's where we're gonna go for a minute I might as well nail this part down and finish the rest of it later is it possible for a born-again Christian to have a temper be careful how you answer that you answer it one way you're gonna be wrong you answered the other way you're gonna be wrong so the best thing to do is back up wait on the Prophet and let him decide because he's the only ones gonna be able to tell us what's right Roselle can't tell us what's right you can't tell us what's right we can't go to Webster and guess what right agreed so we go back and listen to the Prophet as he's trying to emphasize things and by doing that it'll open up the wording that you'll see that it's really holy ghost' virtue holy ghost' virtue is living a virtuous life not a virgin life in the basis of just being a natural virgin it's a virtuous it's Christ living in us I thought the prophets that during the book they were it's his virtue and said is to be like him see now all we want to go to the over to the strength part virtue means strength no though you're not you're going I said you answer the question one way you're going wrong you answer it the other way you're going wrong virtue is strength right virtue went out of Jesus right and healed the people virtue but why did it go out I mean you're setting some word and somebody walks in and you look at him and say he's God I believe he can heal me no there's got to be some reason while all them people cried out and said even the one you know and he said who is this going in other words he said it's the son of David and he said how mercy only son of David lady called him son of David had no right to do it are you listening we take our own wording our own thoughts about what things should be saying that's what I'm trying to get you to see why would a prophet say well the natural words are means virtue means a a virgin life I said that's not in this case he's showing you what the understanding of that word is he's showing you that you can be a virgin all the days of your life and still die and go to hell right it's wonderful commendable great but you can be ever better that'd be as mean as a rattlesnake then he said a virtuous life you see those people seem Jesus they seed him heal the sick and raise the dead cast out Devils and that made that virtuous part of it made it to where they could connect with him and that would bring the strength into view the strength wasn't in the wouldn't brought into view just because they knew that he done this that the other right when he healed that person and said virtue went out of him strength went out of him was you know what had caused it a virtuous life had caused him to come to a place that people could believe him right these artists were our problem is you remember what the Prophet said on virtue he said you see where well most of us gonna fall off right now because see we don't know what virtuous means we make it a virgin life or we making this another the other or we say oh it's not a virgin I see strength well how did the strength come out of him because they connected to the God that was in the flesh and then the flesh got weak the virtuous I can't I can't even get away from that one I'm trying to make a point so when we come to the temperance it's not stop drinking alcohol stuff like that no it means that uncontrollable temper but brother that I don't have a temper that's all right go ahead cause you see that's not going to bring a virtuous life to anyone what you claim it's what you and I live it's what we live and how we walk is going to bring the virtuous part not how much we can read or how much we can say is how much we can walk in God now watch him is he talking about a temper a very uncontrollable temper that cannot be controlled a mean person no because that ain't supposed to be in the Christian well that's what he said we'll go ahead you won't get no definition out of it taking it from the natural and it's reading that's why I spent so much time on that message on virtue trying to get you to think about well we sell streams we know what it is now we don't what the Prophet told us it was strength ain't no strength draw it out of something it's not tired if there's not a virtuous life then there's no need to try to draw anything out of it and that's where we're ever one failing we're failing on that virtuous life part we're human we're making mistakes and we do wrong we still need a Savior we still need an advocate we still need one to take care of all of our problems if a brother daily I don't have no problems I ain't had a a wrong thought since I got born again you just lied I need no backup their statements are falling away or it won't brother Dale you don't know me I know everybody like a brother told me one time he said me and my wife lived together 30 something year he never had one word I said I don't believe it I said if it's true that means she's just tired down under you and she won't say nothing cuz she's afraid of you I don't care who you are you live together 30 years you're gonna have problems you live together one year you're gonna have problems right and being a yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yeah that's that's all right that's good but it ain't gonna solve the problem I'm just human all right you know that's it's the way I believe it this way live I try to live what I am and I fail and I mess up all right I know that no problem what I'm trying all right see that's the problem we need to do is just try at least you know to be what we are all right well you get what I'm talking about the emphasis E is in the statute of perfect man that there's a you know virtue he's trying to make it something else but see we move it from here to over here and we just say oh yeah we know what it is now it's strength it's not living a virgin live being this natural its strength well how did he get that strength now God living inside of him how are you gonna have any strength you see one of the profit in the way he made the statement he said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a most important thing in your life because there's no way to have these virtues without having something to start from temperance getting over to the it for this two minute go ahead and know him number four we're brothers well that's a prophet and read it paragraph two nineteen stature perfect man you talk about to number four he gets down to the point they said add temperance oh my we've come to temperance you see we're gonna get one next see I'm trying to show you one thing your prophet has given us definitions from God of what these virtues are he's not giving us natural words that we can put together and come up with some definition of what the virtues are when we get over to godless he's gonna say he said we come all this way they ain't got to hold a ghost yet you know what that started a doctrine that is still going around the world a doctrine that there's nobody got the Holy Ghost it's still in the foreign field is still going I can get you a book on the one that wrote and supposed to be the first martyr of the age the first one kill for what he believed and that was the message no baptism of the Holy Ghost like in the book of Acts I've wished to debt for 40 years because I can read brother Brenham said the same Holy Ghost fell on deaf penico it's the same Holy Ghost living in your heart now I didn't say that he did you see but listen now we've come to temperance now you've had faith first have to have that to begin with then you had virtue to your faith if it's the right kind of virtue then you had knowledge if it's the right kind of knowledge now you're going to add temperance temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol either here either no no temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure not in this case this is Bible temperance holy ghost' holy spirit temperance that's just one of the lusts of the flesh what drinking in time right and we're talking about the holy spirit temperance now what is the holy spirit temperature that means and here is a holy spirit temperance how to control your tongue let's see we want to lay emphasis back here most of the time off of this temperance is how to control your temper he brings the word temperance as doing that how to control it but he says not to be a toddler what's the Tattler got to do with temperance you don't read what Stadler got to do with temperance you don't read you don't listen as you read your mind don't work come on he said that's just one of the lusts of the flesh well we're talking about Holy Spirit temperance that means how to control your tongue not to be a toddler how to control your temper we're getting down we're going to understand it on that right how to control your temper when he's talking about how to control your tongue that's not a definition of temperance out of Webster that's a profits definition of the word temperance not to just be a point to control your temper but to control your tongue come on you see why it's so hard to preach the truth oh it's easy to preach it a lot we eat neither one's got no Holy Ghost or devour we know it's got the Holy Ghost stronger we don't have to hold a gorilla you can preach that lie any time you want doing people agree we but the Prophet put the Holy Ghost in ever church age he didn't know no problem and he said the same Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost and coming into your life and see what what happened back there years ago the brother came up with a point one did that nobody's got the Holy Ghost like but because there's nobody being beyond her you know nobody went beyond the curtain of time and I said I'm sorry I'm can't happy I can read brother branham saw a lot of people beyond the curtain of time they must have had perfect love what about the 90 year old woman did he saw her what about sold under the altar what about all those people they saw that's why we just get what we want we don't take the whole man and I admit the message a lot of times is hard to follow cause just what I'm talking about here he's got temperance coming up and to tell you that it's not an alcoholic cooler but he's telling you the temperance is how to control your tongue and not be a toddler then he tells you that temperance is how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks across to you he's got many definitions but they're all right because we could say well bless God I don't I don't have no problem when I've got a little temper now like a little temper but the Prophet said we could have a little temper in that area no he didn't say we could have a little temper he said we had a little there's a lot of difference in it we could have a little temper and have in it B&R don't make it God giving it to you and making it work off of him that means how to control your tongue not be a toddler how to control your temperature not fly off every time anybody speaks across to you oh my boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started aren't we then we wonder why God is not in his church doing miracles and things that he used to do yes sir add these things add temperance to it old temperance how to answering kindness when wrath is spoke to you somebody say you know watch this because this is coming up to your to your religious side of your life somebody say you bunch of holy rollers don't jump up and roll up your sleeves not that but talk with godly love temperance kindness is that the way we want to be congregation says Amen when we're out upon Ron I'm back let him be your example when they said if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread he could have done it and showed he was God but he temperance when he called him they called him bells above these and I'll forgive you are you listening I'll just have to stop this and pick it back up in the next message read the Statue a perfect land and read about the temperance and the vines but just remember temperance is not to stop drinking alcohol then he gives you two or three definitions of a word temperance just like he gives us two or three definitions of the word virtue and when he gets to godliness he's gonna give us a lot of definitions of wordings and he's gonna say you come all this way and they ain't got to hold it go but see you ain't listening because remember back about 20 message years ago we covered the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the new birth and how that it was Christ living in you and how that you could have the baptism every day you'll often miss it because that's on your spirit we've covered those things and we covered true that there's a difference between the born-again experience and the baptism of the Holy Ghost we've done covered that so you're gonna lose it when I get up and start making that statement that your prophet has made you're going to lose because you're gonna say now wait a minute how can you how the new birth in the back came out the back it's all one in the same you ain't listening to him there's one the troubles that you still have your own definitions of words I'm trying my best to get one thing to us we need to get rid of our education that's as plain as I can say we need to get rid of our education he said no no no we don't need to become dummies getting rid of your education eight dummies couldn't read the education is a right thing because your education is what making them your dummy right education is what's making you a dummy let's get rid of the educational part and we'll see that a lot of definitions of words don't mean what they mean come on what do you listen virtue doesn't mean a virgin life don't forget what it means from there it means strength he went off the scale on both ends and you're saying what the prophets say what you running it off on both in come back in the middle and think a little bit about a virtuous life in Christ of letting him live into our hearts and lives human mistakes yes problems yes we're going to be that away all of us are going to be that away I don't care who you think you are or what you think I am we're all got that problem we're human but we need to get rid of ourselves and let Christ feel because that's the Christian life Father we thank you and we ask you to just be with us as we Lord come to a close we know that we can't continue the thought we talk too much time so we commit it to you we'll finish this later you'll bring it back we'll all be in you and whatever to be and we commit it to you now in Jesus name come on musicians this sing if anybody hasn't need the altars open all I'm trying to do is get us to look at a human as human beings we have human traits and those traits and things is our problem that's our problems that's our troubles and then we look at each other to try to find out about the other person you know instead of looking at our own sales and saying lord help me help me Lord just be what you want me to be but takes one thing for certain I hope you'll remember that you'll take that first two or three quotes that we read that you'll take them home and think about the church that has these virtues as going in the rapture the church that has these virtues the individuals who have these virtues is going in the rapture the individuals that has these virtues there's going to be a resurrection because God said it he's promised it but they're not going to be there without these virtues because they're required if he's given us the ability to receive something - to make it to come to an end then he will also condemn us with the same point since I've told you I told you you didn't listen well you just you just make things to where I can't understand you I thought I could understand I thought I understood what virtue was until you explained what it was well maybe you ought to listen quit trying to figure it out what about it well we're getting ready remember
