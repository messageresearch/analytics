[0:01] amen but we're starting by the grace of
[0:03] the Lord to continue going on
[0:06] um as I bring it up we're going to
[0:08] continue a little bit more talking about
[0:09] what we started talking about last time
[0:11] talking about conformity
[0:13] and conforming
[0:18] uh-oh
[0:20] let's see if I can
[0:23] brothers let's see if it'll
[0:25] come up
[0:41] thank you
[0:45] I don't know
[0:47] okay well we're probably gonna have to
[0:50] talk about it
[0:53] all right
[0:56] all right well we're going to continue
[0:57] anyway with talking about conformity
[1:00] and um you know just to set the record
[1:03] straight I'm not the credit police
[1:07] we'll leave that to brother Terence
[1:08] he'll be the credit police
[1:10] so that means you are welcome to do
[1:12] whatever you want to do
[1:15] you don't have to apologize you don't
[1:19] have to tell me
[1:20] but um certainly wanting to be a
[1:23] blessing to you
[1:25] and um to let you know that God doesn't
[1:27] want good things you know that's number
[1:29] one God doesn't want you to have bad
[1:30] things and you have to settle for the
[1:32] rest of your life that's not God wants
[1:34] all good things for his people
[1:36] God just has a way
[1:38] and that's what God wants us to have the
[1:41] scripture proverbs 10 22 it says the
[1:43] blessings of the Lord it maketh rich and
[1:47] he addeth no sorrow with it that's a
[1:51] powerful scripture so God wants to bless
[1:53] us you know and that word Rich that can
[1:56] also be enrich but it's literally the
[1:59] word Rich if you run it back Abraham
[2:00] when he told the king of Sodom he said
[2:03] hey I don't want to take anything from
[2:04] you because you're going to say that you
[2:06] have made me Rich it's the same word you
[2:09] have enriched my life you can say that
[2:11] so God wants to bless our lives but he
[2:14] wants to do it in a certain way
[2:16] amen so let's go and go to the Lord in
[2:19] prayer
[2:20] precious Lord we thank you for bringing
[2:21] us here this morning Father we pray you
[2:23] just come down bless your people this
[2:25] morning Father we are so thankful for
[2:27] your word Lord and all your blessings
[2:28] that you have for your children father
[2:30] we pray you be with us Lord this service
[2:32] as we started as we open it up Lord just
[2:34] prepare our hearts Lord Jesus for more
[2:37] of your word Lord Jesus help us to see
[2:39] it in reality father we love you father
[2:42] and we commit this service a Sunday
[2:43] school into your hands in Jesus name
[2:46] amen
[2:47] amen so Conformity we know Romans 12 2
[2:51] it says and be not conformed to this
[2:54] world but be ye transformed by the
[2:57] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[2:59] what is that good and acceptable and
[3:02] perfect will of God Amen think about it
[3:06] be not conformed to this world but be ye
[3:08] transformed so that's what we're here to
[3:10] do trying to transform your mind trying
[3:13] to transform it by Renewing Your Mind to
[3:16] the things of God in our day-to-day
[3:18] mundane spending saving buying working
[3:21] getting money we spend most of our hours
[3:23] doing this
[3:25] and we have to renew our minds because
[3:27] the world is set to conform us and um
[3:31] we had a great Sunday uh Bible Study
[3:34] last night for those who missed it was
[3:35] really good brother Wade brought out a
[3:37] forehead and that that really
[3:39] stood out to me you know what it was
[3:41] saying that that whole thing is saying
[3:43] where sin becomes so common to us that
[3:46] we're not afraid to broadcast it we're
[3:49] not afraid to show it off we know the
[3:51] internet you can see any and everything
[3:52] all the time you know no one's ashamed
[3:56] of it anymore just don't call yourself a
[3:58] Christian doesn't mean anything anymore
[3:59] you can wear what you want to wear do
[4:01] whatever you want to do
[4:03] so that's what Conformity is all about
[4:06] you know and that's what the devil wants
[4:07] us to do in all areas of our lives so if
[4:10] we go back to the slide before and it's
[4:11] very simple
[4:13] you know it's a yes and no if I were to
[4:15] show that to a kid and say which one is
[4:16] nice they would always say the smiley
[4:18] face with the yes and the sad face with
[4:20] the no but the member of God is the
[4:22] opposite of this world so when we start
[4:24] seeing God's know as blessings in our
[4:26] lives we're now on the right track he's
[4:29] going to say no to us because he has a
[4:32] provided way
[4:33] so he can't take our way if a good
[4:36] father who's laying out a plan for our
[4:38] lives he has to say tell us no because
[4:40] we don't know what tomorrow holds man
[4:43] think about if we locked in everything
[4:45] when we were teenagers and we said it in
[4:47] and we said this is what we want man I
[4:49] would be ashamed of the things right now
[4:50] that I thought was the best
[4:52] my goodness you know we would think my
[4:54] if I could just get with that girl it
[4:57] would my life would be thank God
[5:00] you know praise the Lord think about it
[5:03] you know if I just had this or if I just
[5:05] had that all my life would be set
[5:09] but God had a plan and that's why we're
[5:10] all here today God orchestrated our
[5:12] lives with yes and no's and all of that
[5:15] to bring this church together today
[5:17] because he has a plan that he's working
[5:19] on and we want his provided way now the
[5:22] devil is always going to be about yes
[5:24] he's always going to try to find a way
[5:27] for you he's never going to tell you no
[5:30] he's going to say there is a way and I
[5:33] can make it easy that's always been his
[5:34] tactic back in the Garden of Eden we
[5:37] know Adam and Eve God said no the devil
[5:40] said hey we can find a way for you we
[5:43] got you and he'll do the same thing
[5:45] today the same thing and money is just a
[5:48] tool to help you see how he works so if
[5:51] you can't afford something he'll find a
[5:53] way make it very easy for you it's
[5:55] always been his trick when God told
[5:58] Cain and Abel toe Kane nope you can't do
[6:01] this he said no I'm going to still do it
[6:04] and then I'm going to get angry if I
[6:06] can't do it and that's the same attitude
[6:08] we'll have we can't get our way we start
[6:10] getting upset and angry so just remember
[6:12] God is saying no because he has a
[6:15] provided way that is so much better if
[6:18] we can learn to wait on the Lord
[6:21] go to the next slide
[6:23] so confirm Brothers go to the next
[6:25] conform it means with or together means
[6:29] basically to adopt the form of those
[6:31] around you Conformity can be defined as
[6:33] the act of matching attitudes and
[6:35] beliefs and behaviors to group Norms
[6:37] Conformity can occur due to a variety of
[6:40] factors including the desire for
[6:42] approval or acceptance a need for social
[6:45] harmony and we've got to fit in or a
[6:47] perceived lack of personal knowledge or
[6:49] certainty about a particular issue you
[6:51] may just not know and you're just going
[6:52] with the flow
[6:54] and so the picture on the side if you
[6:56] can tell what it is it's three of the
[6:58] same elements in different forms one is
[7:00] water one is ice and the other is steam
[7:03] so we know water is going to go with the
[7:05] flow and that's what the world wants
[7:07] don't want us to make a scene just go
[7:09] with the flow go with it why why disrupt
[7:13] why do it differently just go along with
[7:15] it
[7:16] then he wants to freeze you in that as
[7:19] ice so you're locked into that for the
[7:21] rest of your life you're going with
[7:23] something he sets you in and now you're
[7:24] stuck
[7:25] however if we can get heated with the
[7:27] Lord then we'll become steam We rise
[7:29] above all of this and that's what God
[7:32] wants us to do to rise above it so we
[7:34] can see him
[7:36] by the grace of the Lord Jesus see I was
[7:38] as I told you my testimony coming up you
[7:40] know I was used to thinking like a slave
[7:43] we grew up extremely poor so you know
[7:46] all around us was just chaos and we we
[7:50] thought like a slave sometimes I started
[7:51] making a little money I thought well I
[7:53] have to get everything I got to get it
[7:55] now can't wait
[7:57] you know you know God set me up and he
[7:59] told me no to my business idea and all
[8:01] the plans that I had and that
[8:02] transformed my life helped me to renew
[8:05] my mind and that's what I'm trying to
[8:06] encourage you just in a small area so as
[8:09] we go to the bigger things that God has
[8:11] your mind can be renewed God has
[8:14] blessings for each and every one of us
[8:16] that's beyond what we can even imagine
[8:17] but we have to be able to manage that we
[8:21] have to be able to manage these things
[8:22] that God has for us and without the
[8:25] character there is simply no way and
[8:27] remember he's going to say no if we
[8:29] can't handle he's not like us we might
[8:31] give in you know we might say well okay
[8:33] I feel so sorry for him look at his face
[8:36] I'm just gonna go ahead and give in you
[8:38] know I know he blew all his money but
[8:40] I'm going to give him that loan I'm
[8:42] gonna go on co-sign God is not like that
[8:44] he's like if you can't handle I am not
[8:47] going to give it to you and you will go
[8:49] your entire journey and die in the same
[8:52] way
[8:52] that's how serious he is because he
[8:54] wants you to manage it well he wants to
[8:57] bless us
[8:58] so when God told me no he certainly set
[9:00] me up for a miracle and a blessing
[9:02] so as we repeat don't conform to the
[9:05] words the world's way of saying yes to
[9:07] everything if you can wait on the Lord
[9:09] you'll see him come on the scene
[9:12] next slide
[9:14] as I shared the testimony of my dad and
[9:16] God saying no and a lot of things I know
[9:19] from the lessons that I learned in life
[9:21] through all of this this helped us
[9:23] navigate the difficult situation with my
[9:25] dad difficult situation had to get out
[9:27] of the house that he was in but it was
[9:30] many ways that we could have said yes so
[9:33] I want to make sure that point is clear
[9:34] we live in the world today where you can
[9:37] find a way that's the you got to
[9:39] understand that you see this is very
[9:41] different we can make a way today
[9:44] okay you can push yourself you can make
[9:47] it happen
[9:48] and compromise on what God wants for you
[9:51] I could say well you know what we'll
[9:53] just put look I'm tired of this stress
[9:55] we're just going to borrow we're just
[9:57] gonna buy we're just gonna do not give
[9:59] God an opportunity to say no so as we
[10:02] were looking at things we of course we
[10:04] didn't know so we would put a contract
[10:06] on a house but instead of going all out
[10:08] to make sure it happened we said okay
[10:10] let's let's give God a little room here
[10:12] if God wants this now he's we're going
[10:14] to wait on him to see what he's going to
[10:16] do
[10:17] so we're going to put it in maybe
[10:18] slightly lower but still a good deal and
[10:21] then we'll wait on God
[10:23] now but let's instead we can say that
[10:25] we're going to go so take that same
[10:26] approach with anything that you have now
[10:28] if you said I can make it happen without
[10:31] giving God an opportunity to give you a
[10:33] yes or no then you're going to prevent
[10:36] God from coming on the scene right
[10:38] all right so we said no no no we allowed
[10:40] God to do that and by God's grace he
[10:42] opened a door for my dad that was a
[10:44] blessing and a miracle beyond what we
[10:45] can even imagine or think and we thank
[10:48] God today but we had to walk through
[10:50] those no's slowly slowly you're tired
[10:54] yes wanting to make it happen wanting to
[10:56] do something and make it but no we just
[10:58] waited on God and we saw him come
[11:00] through and brother Branham says but you
[11:02] see what it is it's God in his Mercy
[11:05] providing sometimes a thing gets real
[11:07] low where we wonder how it's going to be
[11:09] but God has already provided he just
[11:12] holds it up here drawing interest on it
[11:15] you see to give it to you that is
[11:17] nothing but the truth he holds it
[11:20] waiting until for that right time
[11:22] allowing if you're going to allow it to
[11:25] get real low can you trust him
[11:27] can you trust him to allow it to get
[11:29] real low all right now right before he
[11:32] said this quote now this message is God
[11:34] has a provided way let's go to the next
[11:37] before this quote it's exactly what
[11:39] we're talking about
[11:41] he said I'm going to read through this
[11:43] he said I looked at my old Pontiac the
[11:46] other day it was getting all beat up the
[11:49] high dramatic is going out on it and I
[11:51] got two little girls that bounces around
[11:53] a whole lot in the seats and they about
[11:54] broke the seats down out of it and I
[11:57] went and had it prepared and the man
[11:59] said Billy I'll tell you what I'll do I
[12:01] said I'll give you a good swap for that
[12:03] I said how can I swap that I said I
[12:05] can't do it he said well your credit's
[12:08] good around here as long as you want it
[12:10] I'll hold your note I said That's mighty
[12:12] nice but I can't do it said I'll give
[12:15] you a real good deal on it said being a
[12:17] preacher I'll give it to you at
[12:19] wholesale I said that's nice but see I I
[12:22] can't do it see and said well if you
[12:25] ever take a notion to swap let me know
[12:27] and said all all right
[12:30] next slide so then I thought
[12:33] well God
[12:36] um this old thing is ripe is all right
[12:38] for me it's fine and dandy that in my
[12:41] old truck now you may not know what he's
[12:43] doing but he's renewing his mind he's
[12:46] pausing and thinking wait a second you
[12:49] know my good truck is you know my car
[12:51] it's good it's fine for me you know I
[12:54] said we beat around over the country
[12:55] with it it's okay been doing all these
[12:57] years I can continue on you know I don't
[13:01] have to do this and the other night a
[13:03] phone call came from California
[13:06] he said on the 31st of the month there
[13:08] will be one of the biggest Cadillacs
[13:10] that's made will be brought and set at
[13:12] your door for service to you I said no
[13:14] no brother please said don't do it I
[13:16] said don't I said my neighbors wouldn't
[13:17] understand that and people I don't need
[13:19] a Cadillac I said take the difference
[13:21] and give it somebody else if you want to
[13:22] help me give me a Ford all right or a
[13:24] Chevy I said he said no this is already
[13:27] bought and it's setting here I don't
[13:29] know what I'll do with it that's what
[13:31] brother Brenham said the next slide and
[13:33] this is when he said but you see what it
[13:36] is God in his Mercy providing now that's
[13:39] a natural thing but look what this
[13:41] Prophet is showing us he sat there
[13:43] renewed his mind instead of compromising
[13:45] and God came on the scene and blessed
[13:48] him now that's natural blessed him and
[13:52] that's what it is we have to allow it to
[13:54] sometimes get low so God can come on the
[13:56] scene the devil is going to find a way
[13:58] for that dryer that washer that
[13:59] refrigerator he's gonna find a way that
[14:01] you can get around it
[14:02] you see but we're not going to give God
[14:04] a chance so we can build our faith in
[14:07] the things of God to see wow God you
[14:09] will come on the scene if I could just
[14:11] hold out I can hold out by your grace
[14:14] and do what it takes
[14:16] because God is holding it he is so we
[14:19] see from The Prophet's example how he
[14:21] sat there he resisted he renewed his
[14:24] mind value in that old car you know what
[14:27] it could still go on it's still here you
[14:30] know what am I doing it for anyway and
[14:31] that's what God wants us to do just to
[14:33] think now if you can afford it there's
[14:34] nothing wrong with that but still think
[14:36] do I want it am I ready is it the right
[14:38] time thank God I didn't get a brand new
[14:40] car when my kids were little all those
[14:42] chips and pretzels and candy and all
[14:43] that stuff would have been around thank
[14:45] God my goodness you see so there's a
[14:48] season that might be right you know but
[14:51] even in that we want to just give God an
[14:52] opportunity to work give him he knows
[14:55] what the future holds for us so give him
[14:57] that opportunity resist be thankful
[15:00] renew your mind wait on God God has a
[15:04] provided way but watch those tools that
[15:06] he used he renewed his mind he started
[15:08] being thankful gratefulness is a
[15:10] powerful tool
[15:12] grateful and so that's what we got to
[15:14] watch what Satan is trying to do in this
[15:16] day and time let's go to the next slide
[15:19] back to this quote there's just always
[15:21] dear to my heart for all of us to keep
[15:23] this in mind clean your lives up pay
[15:24] your debts oh no man get all things
[15:27] right get everything right Make Ready
[15:29] Get Ready remember name of the Lord
[15:30] something is fixing to happen cleaning
[15:33] up our lives so yes paying your death
[15:35] but also cleaning our lives up thinking
[15:37] getting organized where it's slow enough
[15:39] to where we do have peace peace in our
[15:42] life peace in our homes
[15:44] and what are we coming here for what are
[15:46] we doing are we coming here playing a
[15:47] game are we coming here meeting as a
[15:49] lodge it's Christ can't come into the
[15:51] church it's perfectly right he's waiting
[15:53] on us I believe we're at the end we
[15:55] truly know that we're here at the end
[15:57] God is waiting on us to get ourselves
[15:59] together and it's going to be us
[16:03] building through all of these things and
[16:04] getting the character from the smallest
[16:07] mundane as brother Louise brought out
[16:09] things in our life getting that
[16:11] character through those things that
[16:13] we're working through
[16:14] so we can handle these bigger things but
[16:17] we are being told we're being told
[16:19] through the word of God we're having
[16:21] this word share to us we know Brother
[16:23] Sam if you saw that um on WhatsApp that
[16:26] you know said his business is something
[16:29] positive for us that's right it's all
[16:32] about growth and for those who've been
[16:33] here years by God's grace I even know
[16:36] the church has gone through financial
[16:38] peace I believe with Dave Ramsey so what
[16:41] is God trying to do he's trying to give
[16:44] us good things by God's grace so it has
[16:47] a church body we can be an encouragement
[16:48] to each other in the right way to
[16:51] encourage Us in the right things so I
[16:53] want you to know as for me in my house
[16:55] this is what we're doing we're fighting
[16:56] this fight by the grace of the Lord
[16:57] Jesus yes we get tempted like everybody
[16:59] else we want to do things we want nicer
[17:02] things but I've learned to wait on God
[17:04] take it slow slow down just a little bit
[17:08] because God wants to bless us above what
[17:10] we can ask or think
[17:12] go to the next slide
[17:14] and God set out from the beginning
[17:16] that's been his plan if we could follow
[17:18] him he'd know so much better than we
[17:20] know and he laid out for Israel they
[17:23] were coming out of this land as
[17:24] immigrants as as a body of people coming
[17:27] into a new country you know pilgrims and
[17:30] strangers that's what they were supposed
[17:31] to be and they were coming into this
[17:33] land and God was laying out that I will
[17:35] bless you abundantly if you obey me if
[17:38] you don't there's nothing but cursings
[17:40] and laying at the door because you don't
[17:42] know the way you're going to do it to
[17:44] yourself if you don't follow what I'm
[17:47] telling you to be obedient to my word
[17:49] that's what God says and the Lord opened
[17:51] up unto thee and the Lord shall if you
[17:54] be if you obey so open unto thee his
[17:57] good treasure the heaven to give the
[18:00] rain into thy land in his season and to
[18:02] bless all the work of thy hand and thou
[18:04] shall lend under many nations and thou
[18:06] shall not borrow and the Lord shall make
[18:08] Thee the head and not the tail and thou
[18:11] shalt be above only and thou shall not
[18:13] be beneath if that thou hearken unto the
[18:16] Commandments of the Lord thy God which I
[18:19] command thee this day to observe and to
[18:22] do things if you can obey the Lord will
[18:26] do this in your life in all things it is
[18:30] his word he set aside to make his people
[18:32] separate and different to see the
[18:35] blessings of God to get such a handle on
[18:38] these natural things that we can see God
[18:40] you see we start knowing that money
[18:42] can't solve all my problems so it
[18:44] becomes a smaller thing that we're
[18:46] managing and we become like Abraham who
[18:48] was very very rich
[18:51] but that didn't mean anything to him you
[18:54] know even he knew money couldn't buy his
[18:56] son a wife so he said Lord take Eliezer
[18:59] down here look he didn't he didn't think
[19:01] of it in that way it was just a tool to
[19:04] help him to be a blessing that's all it
[19:07] was for Abraham
[19:09] that's what it was and that's what God
[19:10] wants us it's the same thing in our
[19:12] lives or where we can manage this thing
[19:13] show the character of Christ and the
[19:16] small things and take that same model
[19:18] just like a map and model it into the
[19:20] greater things the true Riches of God
[19:22] but we have to be able to follow God
[19:26] and we know what happened to Israel they
[19:28] slowly slowly the next chapters in this
[19:31] verse next verses in this chapter he
[19:33] talks about of course all of the
[19:35] cursings and he laid it out and now they
[19:37] said looking into that Kingdom you
[19:39] thought they thought they would drift
[19:40] apart and lose everything that God had
[19:43] for them no they didn't do it and it
[19:45] happened slowly
[19:47] what happened they started losing
[19:49] gratitude right they started looking
[19:52] around looking what everybody else was
[19:54] doing and they lost that renewing of
[19:57] their minds that thankfulness like hey
[19:59] you know what we are chosen people we're
[20:00] special people to begin with the Unseen
[20:03] I don't need to be exactly like the
[20:05] world to consider myself blessed by God
[20:08] I can thank the Lord for choosing me for
[20:10] calling me for giving me a wonderful
[20:12] wife to all of these things that are
[20:14] unseen
[20:15] instead of counting my blessings with
[20:17] the things that are seen but they kept
[20:19] looking around they had a king this
[20:20] nation's doing this and they wanted to
[20:22] be like everybody else they wanted to
[20:23] conformed and then slowly they did it
[20:25] until they completely drifted away and
[20:28] that's the same thing Bible study the
[20:30] horse forehead slowly drift away our
[20:33] eyes is on everything you got the
[20:34] internet just blasting away to conform
[20:37] us we can't be satisfied with anything
[20:39] the more you look at it the more you
[20:42] will be unsatisfied we're sheep my
[20:45] brothers and sisters we will follow it's
[20:48] very difficult had a young brother
[20:51] he posted a picture he's a young married
[20:53] brother and he posted a picture he got
[20:57] his wife I think a new vehicle and he
[20:59] said what do you do for people you love
[21:04] I said mine well praise the Lord if he
[21:07] got it now I'm not creepy if saved and
[21:09] he got it
[21:10] but I would love for him to put that on
[21:12] there hey I also saved and I paid cash
[21:14] for this then I'd be like Amen brother
[21:16] thank the Lord but
[21:19] if not then what that's going to do to
[21:21] the other young couple that's like honey
[21:23] do you love me
[21:25] you know he does this for the thing
[21:27] people he love
[21:28] you know I don't know anymore right and
[21:31] that thing starts deteriorating you see
[21:34] what I'm saying so we have to all be
[21:35] careful what we're looking at we're just
[21:37] sheep we're gonna go with the flow and
[21:39] start conforming
[21:41] and that's the devil's tactics right if
[21:43] it wasn't an enemy we wouldn't have to
[21:44] worry about it but there's an enemy so
[21:46] he's going to say all this yes to allow
[21:48] you to slowly conform
[21:50] what is this sister doing in her house
[21:52] what is this brother doing in what is it
[21:54] oh my goodness and we start just going
[21:56] along with it instead of taking God's
[21:58] word and conforming to this and being
[22:00] transformed and have our minds renewed
[22:03] so gratitude again they started losing
[22:06] that gratitude because of the Conformity
[22:08] stop being satisfied with what God was
[22:10] providing when God was providing it and
[22:13] slowly lost lost that renewing of their
[22:15] minds so God wants to renew our minds he
[22:18] wants us to be thankful I was reading
[22:20] something as we kind of narrowed down
[22:22] just to show the power the power of
[22:24] God's word and what he's trying to do
[22:26] with renewing our minds and bless his
[22:28] people things that they can do that God
[22:31] wants to give us
[22:33] go to the next slide
[22:36] so these are several Brands and I I
[22:39] asked you know look at it Baskin Robbins
[22:42] it's Ben and Jerry's it's Google
[22:44] Facebook Haagen-Dazs Snapple Starbucks
[22:46] Dale uh DreamWorks I mean all of these
[22:50] companies and now they have something
[22:51] very similar in common you may say what
[22:54] what is in common with these companies
[22:55] outside of them certainly wanted to take
[22:56] my money as well but they definitely do
[22:59] that but it's something in common with
[23:01] it and number one the number one thing
[23:03] that's in common these were all started
[23:05] by Jewish people
[23:06] all started by Jewish people now you say
[23:09] well what am I interested what makes the
[23:10] Jewish people so successful well they
[23:13] have some principles they have
[23:14] principles you know and that's what I
[23:16] want any young person oh God has
[23:18] principles in this word that he wants to
[23:20] bless you beyond what you can imagine
[23:22] but the devil wants to take all of that
[23:24] from us so we can't see God at work we
[23:26] go with the way of the world instead of
[23:28] God building this character in us until
[23:30] we see these gifts and these blessings
[23:32] in our lives that we can then manage so
[23:35] Jewish people we know the history
[23:36] persecuted all through this but they
[23:38] still maintain some of that character
[23:39] like immigrants and you know immigrants
[23:42] we know they say hey they got an edge so
[23:44] I'm just going to share some tips with
[23:45] you about immigrants Edge because we
[23:47] should be pilgrims and strangers we have
[23:50] tools that God has given us in his word
[23:52] that should allow us to be different to
[23:54] overcome many of these obstacles next
[23:56] slide we're going to run through as we
[23:58] wrap up
[23:59] so pilgrims and strangers immigrant Edge
[24:02] there's actually a book out about this
[24:04] you know what make these immigrants that
[24:05] come over and they're able to just kind
[24:07] of outwork Americans you know and I work
[24:10] around the world you know God has given
[24:12] me that opportunity to work with people
[24:13] around the world and I see it I
[24:16] you can barely sometimes get Americans
[24:19] to show up at work
[24:21] to show up and if they show up it's like
[24:23] hey reward me to the max you know I came
[24:27] you know what I mean I only left 30
[24:29] minutes early you know it's like but you
[24:32] go around different places that they're
[24:33] not taking it for granted my goodness
[24:35] they'll work all night literally
[24:38] literally for a quarter of what someone
[24:42] here is getting paid for so what is this
[24:45] Edge and we're pilgrims and strangers so
[24:46] take this with you to renew your mind
[24:49] start getting that gratitude back in
[24:50] your life
[24:51] number one they're hungry and open to
[24:54] learning good things
[24:55] so always hungry being open to learn we
[24:57] come here by God's grace a great
[24:59] teaching Ministry it's so much to learn
[25:01] take it in be hungry open to it praise
[25:05] God for the variety that God brings to
[25:07] this church it's such a blessing hungry
[25:09] open to learn number two a do whatever
[25:12] it takes mindset willing to sacrifice
[25:15] get out of the comfort zone do whatever
[25:17] it takes so the same thing if you need
[25:19] to wait on Lord do whatever it takes if
[25:21] I gotta you know wash the dishes our
[25:22] dishwasher's broke but I'm gonna get I
[25:24] am going to get her one
[25:27] so she's been washing the dishes like we
[25:29] need you know and I tried to fix it once
[25:31] I'm gonna do it one more time I think I
[25:34] could get it but do whatever it takes my
[25:36] mindset try
[25:38] a willingness to outwork others a
[25:40] willingness to keep going keep working
[25:42] keep doing
[25:44] a heartfelt Spirit of gratitude thank
[25:48] God and focus on what you have not what
[25:50] you lack
[25:51] take that time pause you start a prophet
[25:53] think about well I got a car I got a
[25:55] truck hey I can continue on
[25:57] to be thankful for what you have that
[25:59] Spirit of gratitude is so powerful and
[26:02] remember the devil is trying to take
[26:03] that from us by seeing everything else
[26:06] he gradually steals it right out of our
[26:08] hearts so keep that Spirit hone your
[26:10] skills invest in yourself your job and
[26:12] others hone your skill if you're
[26:14] studying something if you have a job God

[26:32] the right season in the right time and
[26:33] you will be glad for it if you learn to
[26:35] wait and number seven an appreciation of
[26:37] where you came from amen remember where
[26:41] God has brought us from my brothers and
[26:43] sisters we are should be such great for
[26:45] people that God has revealed to us this
[26:48] powerful word he's given us skills and
[26:51] talents to bless our lives he's
[26:53] enriching our lives by his grace and
[26:56] where we came from my goodness where
[26:59] would we have been my mama if God didn't
