churches father forgive us of our sins bless this day continue to be with us be with the bride around the world we were the missionaries on the foreign field Lord give them fruit for their labor or just give us our daily bread today we ask these things in Jesus name amen so we're running on one wheel so we got the we got the uh one computer working our brothers in the back so they're uh they do a wonderful job a lot of stuff y'all don't see that they take care of before all this has been taking place out here so uh remember them in your prayers too but Daniel 9 verse 24. we're going to continue on the study of the six-fold purpose but we're going to try to like we said last Sunday is bring in the natural part of the seals because you know we get the spiritual part and and brother Dale was speaking on that this morning and did you know of course he always does a wonderful job but that just kind of fits right in if you'll keep your mind on that then you'll be able to maybe learn a little more about the natural part of the seals being open because we don't see the natural part of the seals we see the spiritual part the natural part goes to the Jews so as we're standing on a six-fold purpose let's read Daniel 9 24. the 70 weeks are determined upon thy City and upon thy holy and upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to do these six things right to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity bring in Everlasting righteousness seal of division and prophecy and to anoint the most holy now let's go to Revelations 11. read verse 1 there that is where the good profits are coming into Israel we've all ready for those of you that are not they have not been here or have been here a few times before not the background so much but we in this church believe that Daniel 70 weeks that the prophet preached them correctly he preached them right the first time he does not need someone to come back and correct him if he needed correction God corrected him right so we believe that today of 70 weeks was preached by our prophet and then it was then it was Vindicated and then it was revealed to you and I anything the prophet preached has got is is a revelation to you and I we'll take it as that right all right now remember Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood that's a quote you take that quote out of context you make him a vampire right right but if you take that quote in context he's telling us what to do as far as the communion goes all right so that's the same way with brother Branham we see that he brought and and revealed to us the love letter and showing that these two prophets would come after we leave but it does have something to do with us because it is the Redemption of Israel we must see our Redemption because like I told you last Sunday what we received here is a revelation we have to hand that child right handed that child to Naomi not a different child the child that they conceived and they birthed they handed it to Naomi which was the type of us handing Jesus Christ back to Israel so we can't hand them a trinity we can't hand them a false Doctrine we can't hand it hand them that brother Brandon was wrong and that the the words wrong here and there we can't handle that we got to hand them the perfect word of God for God to come into these two prophets and reveal reveal what's already been revealed to us that's right see we're the bride they're servants right I'm gonna I'm gonna converse with my wife first tell her the secret things that's right then if we decide to give it to somebody else we can but if not it's between us that's right that's what God did he revealed his secrets to his bride and then we take what we have and we hand it to Israel so they can be redeemed also so Revelations 11 1-6 and there was giving me a read I want you to watch this because we usually skip down to verse three to talk about the two witnesses but remember in our study of Daniel 70 weeks in the six-fold purpose remember that six things has to happen to the people and the what City amen listen to this and that was giving me a read like I can do a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God now we know where the temple of God but there's going to be a natural temple built in Jerusalem the Millennium Temple all right all right so this is the twofold manner here a twofold purpose rise and measure the temple of God and the Altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not remember we get we don't get time times and the dividing of times he raises his hand in this fraternity right right we're gentiles but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not right right because there's no special time for the Gentiles there is a special time for Israel though what is given unto the Gentiles what the outer core right the outer Court you there was a court that you could walk in as a gentile but watch this and the holy city shall they tread Under Foot 40 and two months who the Gentiles so that Temple cannot be restored during the 42 months that these two prophets are going to preach exactly so there must be a time for the holy heavy to be restored right and redeem all right and I will give power to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days clothing sackcloths these are the two olive trees and two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth now that's not literal fire it's what they're words right and devours their enemy and if any man will hurt them he must die must be in this manner be killed these have power to shut heaven and Reign not in the days of their prophecy and have power over Waters to turn into blood and to Smite the Earth with all plagues as often as they will and you may be seated in the Lord at his Blessing for the reading of the word now just in the background we want to show for those of you that have not been here are are coming a little bit later we're looking now at the part of the Daniel 70 weeks chart that brother Branham Drew and we're looking at the last week so we're that's what we're dealing with is the six-fold purpose is for the Redemption of Israel correct amen amen amen Mr Michelle I get the Sleepy crowd so I get to walk out here and wake them up see what I mean don't you need to go sleep all right six-fold purpose though finishes Israel's Redemption right right them and the City correct all right six seals finishes our Redemption so there's a parallel there the library Adele said this morning we get the spiritual part we get the spiritual part of Revelation 6 1 through 19. we're not here doing that time we're not here we're going 401 we're caught up into heaven correct right right all right so now message to the 144 000 will last how long the Bible said 1260 days which is a 30-day prophetic calendar 30 days in a month that's exactly three and a half years right okay so now those two profits are going to preach and prophesy for 1260 days according to Revelations 11 3 that we just read right so and then during that time Israel is going to receive the Messiah message that Jesus preached three and a half years when he was here right Jesus preached three and a half years here now he's going to preach three and a half years over here through to profits right all right so we see that I mean we've already been through that this is just the background but I wanted to show you like we were talking about last week how that comes to the seals because it's got to show us that in this 1260 days that all these things happen the seals the plagues the vows the trumpets anything from Revelation 6 1 to Revelations 19 21 when we come back with Jesus into the Millennium has to do with the Jews right right nothing to do with us at all right except if we don't get the spiritual revelation of it no they're not going to get the natural part of it right remember God does it he reveals it and then he makes it manifest right right so he does it reveals it makes it manifest so he does it reveals it to us then he makes it manifest to Israel through two prophets all right but you and I have got to see the breaking of that seal yes are the books still closed right and if the book's still closed they can't get the open book all right because Revelation 6 1 does revelation 19 is what's going to happen between that 1260 days that these two prophets are going to preach right you don't agree with it I'll you'll have to disagree with the prophet but I'm going to read quote with you in just a second to back that up the revelations 19 and throw it away like I said last Sunday if six one to 19 is not to us and we don't have anything to do with it then just taking care of it out of your book throw it away but now you got to deal with Revelations 22 where it says if you take anything out of the book your name's took out of the book all right so be careful when you take something out of the Bible now let's go to the quote number a now let's read it this is Gable's instruction to Daniel now this is Brother Brown he's preaching the 70-week series he's in the instructions to Daniel Revelation 6 1 to Revelations 19 21 it's connected with the 70 of weeks therefore we must stop and explain before we go further that's what we're doing now we must stop and explain why these 70 weights because if you don't you'll miss the sales you'll miss the trumpets you'll miss the vowels the plagues three unclean spirits like frogs that's all in six one to nineteen all right those three woes the casting out of the Red Devil the woman in the sun you'll miss it all if you don't because it takes place right here in this 70th week that's where it takes place everybody see that say Amen all right the Revelation 6 1 to 1921 is to the Jews but it does have a spiritual meaning to us but it's going to be a natural happening to the Jews all right everybody got that same man all right number B this is the six-fold purpose what we're talking about now what is it his people had just crowned him King of Kings now to save time that was the last one which is anoint the most holy this is what he was talking about when he was talking about the bride coming back and anointing the temple right here and then paragraph 134 he starts with this what is it his people had just crowned him king of kings and Lord of lords coming back to his holy Temple Anointed with the presence of God to living Reign through the Millennium with his church because remember I after the two prophets prophesied battle of Armageddon the holy cities to needs to be built and then we're supposed to come back in in the Millennium in Revelations 19 21 is that correct right all right so now the appearing with the mighty king to take her place at his side the new Royal anointed Temple so we must be there with her with him her right that's us okay all right now the sixth full purpose of Revelation 6 1 to Revelations 19 21 is fulfilled so Revelation 6 1 to Revelations 19 21 has to be fulfilled in that last part of the 70th week of Daniel now in closing the seven seal seven trumpets seven files three woes woman in the sun casting out of the devil the red dragon comes between these times during the Great Tribulation period don't forget it all these things take place during this time but here is the six-fold purpose of his coming who's coming Christ amen what is the two prophets preach Christ right so much for where they say where did you get those scars that's right man he doesn't physically come but he doesn't physically come here either but we get a body change and we get took out of here just by the revelation of him being so present Among Us that brother Khali is God made manifest in another form we are the Bride made manifest where God made manifest if we're in The Bride of Jesus Christ we are God not a second person amen that's right amen if we're not we're anti right right we're Antichrist if we're not Christ make manifest in another form but here's the sixthful purpose of his coming what to them because he promised he'd never forget Israel that's right even though he put him away in adultery he said I'll never forget them because they are to come in as servants all right but here's the sixthful purpose of his coming do you believe it what a glorious time lays in store for those who love the Lord I tell you friends we can't afford to miss that don't miss that whatever you do be sure it's like Daddy said today don't miss the Rapture because it's the tribulation period if you miss it right right and as much as we know about the message it's going to be hell if we miss it so now who will these two prophets be we know it's Moses and Elijah and we know they're coming to bring a message but now we're going to see and bring up number one just kind of lay a little background here and then we're going to get into the scripture and talk about the seals watch these two prophets this is in the 70th week of Daniel watch these two prophets going to do when they come so in other words the Raptors already taking place we're gone right we don't go through the defibrillation period right man we don't see the amount of sin sitting in the temple of God we don't see the seal open in its natural form right right we get a revelation of it remember what brother Dale said the seal does what shows what was what is and what is to come right so we can see what is to come this is what is to come this is the prophecy that we can see that brother Brown came to bring us the open book so that we can read it not that he read it for us right I didn't graduate high school because my teacher could read that's right right right amen I graduated high school because I learned how to read all right watch these two prophets going to do when they come this Beast this Prince that shall scatter the power of the Holy people what will you do he'll break his Covenant with him after three and a half years he'll ask them now people think that's communism that's just because you're the spirit of God hasn't dealt with you yet it's not communism it's what religion Protestants and Catholics all right the Bible said it would be so close it would deceive the very elected possible Jesus said sit so so we're in the last one now these two prophets what will they do it's more than Elijah they'll rise on the Saints they'll tell those Jews their mistake to what they're going to tell them you're wrong they're going to establish Temple worship the Beast is going to sign a pact with them and let them do their own sacrifices and all that stuff and then these 144 000 these two prophets they're going to raise up and say hey you missed it you've made a mistake they'll tell those Jews they're mistaken out of that Jewish Bunch that there's now to be 144 000 so it's not all Israel going to be saved amen there's only 144 000. all right God will call with these prophets what is it the spirit of Elijah off of this Gentile church now who's he talking about us all right off of this Gentile church will just continue right on into that Jewish Church go right on in and call Moses with him Hallelujah you see it and he'll preach the same message of Pentecost to those Jews that they rejected the Messiah amen you see it it will be the same Pentecostal message that these Jews will preach right over to them now we're going to get into that stop this is hanging we're going to get into that because I want to if we can get through the seals today I want to go into the trumpets because the trumpets brings a little different it's not different but it is a little bit different angle of because the Jews missed the Feast of Pentecost right they missed the piece of Pentecost all right so just keep that in your mind for a minute because it'll be the same Pentecostal message they're not going to preach something different than Paul said I mean Peter stood up on in the book of Acts in Acts 1 Acts 2 1 he comes up and in Acts 2 38 Peter gets up and starts preaching him a message what is a Pentecostal message action 38. it's the same Pentecostal message that these years will preach right over to them and they'll hate those Jews so badly till they'll kill them and we're hated by All Nations and in the midst of the week because it had raised up a great hundred and forty four thousand now here's one that I didn't bring last Sunday a great powerful 144 000 not just two profits are great right not just one profit in the end time was great right right there's the people raised up underneath that message took the voice in the days of The Voice we're taking the message and becoming a powerful one without number they are a powerful 144 000. they had the Holy Ghost and brother you talk about doing Miracles they did them they stopped the heavens it didn't rain the days of their prophecy spoke the Earth with plagues as often they wanted to they give plagues and everything else they'll give them Romans the hard way to go but finally they'll be killed now that'll be over after the 1260 days our God is a terrible God when he's anger but remember that's over in the 70th week in the church in glory the wedding supper going on yes and now notice that's where we've seen her coming back to the millennial Temple over here at the end of the Jewish age the anointed here he comes riding on a white horse those following him on white horses horses Powers dressed in white blood or vegetable dipped in blood wrote the word of God he cometh the mighty conqueror to set up the Millennium coming to the temple Glory there he meets that 144 thousand now let's go to the next one face of the trumpets now what's going to happen is let's just read a quote now notice exactly the continuity of the scripture exactly the same under the seventh trumpet now that's in Revelations over there in eight right right when this when the seventh seal breaks there's silence in heaven if you continue to read a little bit further over you'll see the seventh trumpet is sounding under the seventh trumpet is to Israel the same as the seventh seal was was to the church we find under the seventh seal that we know Souls that were on the altar they'll received roads they were given roads not that they earned them because they were in a dispensation when God was dealing with Grace brother they'll talk about that this morning we the Gentiles not the Jews Israel is saved as a nation that's that hundred forty four thousand they're going to be saved at the 144 000 as a nation God deals with Israel as a nation Gentiles are the people for his name not a nation for his name Israel and I think maybe we have one more number five or number three now piece of the trumpets again and at the same time now as soon as this church the bride is drawn together she's taken up and that mystery of the seventh seal on the seventh seal the mystery of going man the Jews is called by The Mystery of the seventh trumpet which is two prophets alive and Moses they come back and there's where Pentecost is all mixed up they're looking for something to happen in other words they're looking for something to happen in the future and the church has done gone and backs to the Jew right all right let's go to the next one number four listen to this because we're going to step back now and turn to Matthew in a minute and start on the field but I want to kind of set up a stage here number four recognizing your day in this message and this is after he preached piece of the trumpets and I went into praying called my wife I'm going in and sincerely I Nat down before God to pray and he revealed to me that the them seven trumpets sounded under the Sixth Seal and I've done preached it supernaturally yeah supernaturally all right and not naturally supernaturally all right so it's not naturally happened it's supernaturally already happened see it's the hand of God the whole thing it pertains to Israel and we picked it up under the seal and you all who have that how the persecution of the Jews can we have one more we have one more they speak back to the face of the trumpet now here's a calling out time and at The Sixth Seal when it when it opened the persecution struck the Jews in the literal standpoint see we're talking spiritual nice and then the literal standpoint all right and here comes the persecution to the church and the ecclesiastical standpoint right that's what's happening now we don't see the sick still open but there's a six seal purging going on now of you and me to get us out of here all right but now look here comes the persecution to the church and the ecclesiastical standpoint but you're spiritual right right right right religion the sabbaths are over because the bride is already called the Sabbath are over and ready for the Jews to be called where to the Feast of atonement now I throw that in there just for you to realize that the Feast of atonement is when they realize that Jesus was already crucified for him not a re-killing of another of another animal but it's not animal blood anymore it's the blood of almighty God where to the Feast of atom an old church don't you see it call to the Feast of atonement to recognize the atonement not no more chickens and geese of what they've been doing the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world Israel is going to know that all right now to read all that just to summarize that now what they're going to do is those two prophets are going to go to Israel after we leave they're going to take this message that we're preaching now right right revealed to them and they're going to tell walk in and tell those Jews they're going to say hey no more chickens geese or whatever are lambs because remember they're they're trying now to establish Temple worship go to the Temple Mount uh go to the website for The Temple Mount they're trying their best to get the red heifer they're trying their best to get all these things and we were talking downstairs a couple of weeks ago if you realize this do you know who owns all the pieces of the original Temple who the Catholic church right when Titus destroyed Jerusalem in 80 70 they took the menorah they took the holy of holies they took everything with them and where is it now it's in the Vatican right right that's right so the Jews though think they have to establish the temple worship again so that their Messiah can come right right they got to have a red heifer I've told you to study and look up the five cups of Elijah on the uh I can't remember the name of the website I'm gonna put in cup of Elijah because they said a couple of Elijah they know Elijah's got to come back before Christ comes right the natural Jew knows that they know that now they're waiting for Elijah to come to introduce because they set the cup down they opened the door they look down the road and if Elijah's not coming up the road they close the door and they say until next year so they're waiting for Elijah to come well they're going to get that fifth coming of Elijah but it's going to be through two prophets Elijah and Moses right and they're going to say hey you guys missed it because the forthcoming of Elijah that guy came and revealed everything what see we didn't know anything about a coma we didn't know anything about the Feast of Pentecost oh yeah sure we had the 1906 Isuzu Street and we had a Pentecostal experience but did you know anything about the true atonement until you heard of Jesus Christ and and and just even come into the message and you're we're still learning about the atonement we're still learning what God's doing for us right we didn't get it all at one time so they're not going to get it all at one time the only problem is our Feast of atonement was the second person of a trinity theirs is one true and living God they know that Messiah will be God Almighty you and I were fed a trinity and it took all these years to get the trinitarian doctrine out of us to know that the true atonement was almighty God given his life for you and I not some second person of a trinity so that's the problem with us well not now but still we have come to the Feast of atonement we realize but they have not come to that Feast of atonement yet Acts 2 and 1 says when the day of Pentecost was fully come amen now what happened was before then thanks guys and when the day of Pentecost was fully covered with asking you shall receive it I had one of the damn Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place so that was the day of Pentecost you know the Holy Ghost fell on the day it was supposed to fall right Jesus was in the temple every time there was a feast day Jesus was standing in the temple because he was that lamb he was trying to tell him that Lamb's not doing you any good anymore this is the Lamb you need to look at but when they rejected him they said let his blood be on us and our children and that's why the two prophets are going to have to come back and preach Jesus Christ because they were cut off let his blood be on us and our children and you know what I was thinking the other day you can think of that in a in a bad way let his blood be on us and our children but if his blood wasn't covering them Brother Dean they can't come in right man so is it such a bad thing that they said let his blood be on us and our children yes it was because they rejected the Messiah but it's not such a bad thing to be covered by the blood lettuce blood I'm glad his blood is on me Amen in the right way I'm glad it's blood I'm glad that it's combing in I accept that atonement and the blood covers me all right so the blood's been covering them but see what the two problems are going to do they're going to turn around and you know what they're going to say repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ they're not going to go over there and tell them Father Son Holy Ghost right they gonna say in the name of Jesus Christ for their mission of your sins one of the sixth full purpose do make an end of what Sans all right and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and that's exactly what they're going to do they they were cut off so that the Gentiles could be grafted in right right all right they were grafted in we were grafted in and then God's not going to forget Israel though he's coming back into profit to do the very same thing right right that's one of the feasts that's why the Feast of trumpets has to come through those two prophets because the Feast of trumpets is what it's a calling of the people right God's calling you and I spiritually under the Feast of the trumpet that's why the Seven Seals and the Seven trumpets I read you the quote brother Brown said they're the same thing right amen the seven sealed to us it's the same as the seventh trumpet to the Jew which is calling us to what the Feast of atonement amen they're calling us to the atonement same way with you and I you know when we really realize the atonement when your body's changed right because he didn't die just for your soul at Calvary he died for your body your spirit and your soul he died for the whole guy right and that's what you and I got to realize we're only accepting a little bit of the pardon that's right remember a pardon is it not a pardon collector said well we've accepted the pardon for our soul right right man why not for this guy right all because it comes from Mom and Daddy and SN and it does this and now that's not what God Said right God said you're perfect that's the same thing with you and I God's going to go over there and he's going to tell those people he's going to say look repent if you repent I'm going to restore you back now I'm not going to restore you back to sonship I'm not gonna restore you back to bride and I'm going to restore you back to sermons and you're going to be right there with me all the time right they're going to be in the temple with us they're going to be in the city with us so let's go to Matthew and let's look because they missed all this but you and I remember let the ass Jesus they ask him what three things right then brother Brown said this was the sealed right okay so we're okay we're we're in the Bible this is not C Spot Run remember that those either working here don't worry about it c-spot run was a first grade reader I know Sister Michelle's not even old enough to remember that all right we don't teach first grade readers then we have to See Spot Run I still had one of those books somewhere my mom may still have them damn sure still reading them Jesus went out Jesus went out Lisa's helping him though Jesus went out and departed from the temple that's my brother Jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to Empire to show him the building of the what the temple right we're talking about City now right Temple okay and Jesus said unto them see you not all these things barely I say unto you there shall not be left one stone upon another they should not be thrown down and as you set upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world all right three things and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you and if you'll go back end of the sale book I believe it's on the fifth seal of The Sixth Seal brother Brown he breaks these down so we're going to break them down here and show you that that Jesus preached the seals six seals to the people and of course we obviously know that Jesus was the seventh seal which is is coming and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many pursue what's profit saved all right second seal is verse six and you shall hear wars and rumors of wars remember the red horse killing right see that you've been out trouble for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet verse 7 and 8. third seal for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom there shall be famines pestilence earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows then shall you be delivered up to be afflicted and shall then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake right all right that's the fourth seal fifth seal and then shall many be offended before reading this what Jesus was telling now who was he talking to right he was talking to Jews they want a gentile in a bunch unless someone was in the bush she's listening they were no Gentiles they're all Jews all right so he's telling the Jews what's going to happen to them all right because the sales are to them but you and I need to get the spiritual part of this all right and they shall need to be offended shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he shall endure until the end the same shall be saved now he's telling them what to do they ask him three questions all right and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come now that's what's happening now in the spiritual part all right when you therefore shall see the Abomination look at verse 15. when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy place whosoever readeth and understand now we know that when Titus came in and destroyed Jerusalem because Jesus tells them after that to save time says then let them which into in Judea flee to the hills and let him that's on the housetop not come down what's he telling them don't be caught in the city this is the natural part of when uh Titus comes in and levels because remember he said there won't be one stone left on another so that's what Titus did he came in and totally destroyed the temple amen Jesus was telling him not to be there that's the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel right then but now we know now that the mosque of Omar are sitting in that same spot right right that's the Abomination is that there's a and we're all Gentiles to a Jew if you're not a Jew you're a gentile I don't care if you're an Islam or you're or whatever you are you're a gentile compared to them so the abomination of desolation is set in there in right over the holy of holies right that thing's sitting there and the Jews can't get to it that name were over there 15 years ago and they were trying to Tunnel underneath to get to it with all that over the top they're trying to get to because they know that's the spot where that Temple was and where it's going to be reconstructed again right but when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken up by the name of the Prophet standing in the Holy place whosoever readeth let him understand right and then just keep talking about Great Tribulation but I want to try to get to the seals here in just a few minutes so we need to hurry through let's go to verse 27 this is a continuation this is where the Sixth Seal comes in according to the profit from 28 30 28-31 whereas the lightning come a thousand East and shineth even into the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be because remember remember what we're talking about the seals the son of man Ministry was Jesus on Earth as the son of man right he was God in human flesh right now we see that the Son of God Ministry was down through seven Church ages and then for a little while you see it at the end time not through just William Brown but the son of man Ministry is back in powerful whether you believe it or not right amen this is the son of man Ministry this is the Messiah message that that Jesus preached that's right for three and a half years we get that here remember we're talking about Rachel and Liam bringing in the types but Sal that son of man Ministry doesn't end it goes right on over to the Jews right because they see the nail prints in his hand where you get those scars what they see Jesus through those two Prophets so he's so we're not just talking about us this is not just the son of man just to you and I right those two prophets were gone in human flesh to those people over there in Jerusalem all right so now look hope you're also the coming of the son of man beef or who orsoever the carcass is there where the Eagles begin you say well that's us well that's Israel too right Israel will come one is the Feast of trumpets the in gathering what does the trumpet do it denotes a war or it's trying to tell you something in the days of the voice of the Sabbath Angel when he begins to say what he calls out and we come in like Dad said this morning it says come out of her my people well that's to us coming out of denominations and that's also the Jews coming out of that junk that's over there now the 144 000 coming out of her my people all right who's her and start Roman Catholicism Doctrine I don't care what age it was in I don't care what time it was in to us or the 144 000 that's what it is it's a it's religion right all right it's that Roman religion that come in so where's whoever the carcass is there when the Eagles begin of us and also speaking of the 144 000 right now look six seal immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her life the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great glory and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other all right so now let's go to revelation 6. one now remember we have been going through the field that has been going through them breaking them down and at number four going into number five so now let's watch and see the natural opening of the seal because we get the spiritual part right remember they get the natural part we get the spiritual part of the of the seven trumpets they get the natural part of the seven trumpets all right and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it was a noise of Thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see you said well the four beasts are gone from the Earth from work when we're gone that's exactly correct but brother Brown said the four Beast was what the Holy Ghost now watch the Holy Ghost gonna be doing he's gonna be in two Prophets you see how can he be two places one time how can you be in a million places at one time right it's gone yeah it's not for us to understand for us to believe that that I can be born again here and somebody can be in Alaska preaching the same message and it's the same Holy Ghost but we're four thousand miles apart right so don't wonder about well how can the Holy Ghost be here and even be hearing him be here the four beasts is connected to the bride we know that right and it's the Holy Ghost and the bride but now those four beasts are going to absolutely help those 144 000 or it's a different Holy Ghost okay is that all right and I saw and behold a white horse and he didn't sell him had a bowl and a crown was given on him and he went forth conquering in the conquer now we know that that in the natural the spiritual opening of that seal that brother Brown typed that was the first page it being a saying you know right it wasn't a person it was a little spirit that went out oh yeah that's right well now listen when we leave out of here and God starts dealing with the Jews I don't think that man of sin see remember he's not the Antichrist the Beast fulfilled I think he's going to start in with flattery just like he did in the first church he's not going to come in as soon as we leave and go I'm it this is it no he's going to come in why he's going to make them sign a pack that's what the scripture says he's going to make them sign a document that okay we'll we'll give you your Menorah back that's right we'll give you all your gold back we'll give you all your altars and all your your stuff but but you're gonna have to do this yeah because remember he holds all the gold and he holds all the wealth and he holds all the bonds right he's got everything under his control but he's not going to come in and just boom I don't think he's not going to do that because see we look over after the 1260 days and we see that they find out the world finds out the Jews find out they've been duped right because that's what the battle of Armageddon is going to be about right they're going to figure out that something happened right so see the the first the first horse rider he's going to be religious oh he's going to be a white righteous shirt he's not going to be a devil like he ends up after 1260 days no he's going to come in with flattery the Bible says right right and we don't have time to read every scripture but you understand what I'm saying and I saw him Behold a white horse and he had a bow and the crown was given on him remember he was a bluff he was a blessed in the first stage as far as the spiritual part of of us seeing the seal in the spiritual part right but in the natural part he's going to be the same thing now he's not going to ride over there on a white horse he's riding in the people that's right that's right all of Israel he's writing in all of Israel because they all signed that Pact all right then God's gonna say come out of her my people he's going to draw out 144 000. just like you and I were in the church ages right Baptist methodists and all those things he's gonna what come out of her my people all right but he's a blessed and he's still a bluff he has no power unless God give him he's a bluff because the Bible says one day we're going to look at the Devil that's what a man laying in a ditch on the side of the road and we're going to look down and say is this the man that calls Nations to fall amen and us and billions of people to die is this the man that caused all that dress the same way here he's going to start out as a little saying a little deed a little Doctrine a bluff he's going to bless them people right because when he becomes the full incarnate Beast at the end after the 1260 days he's gonna say I'm the man right I've been the man all along that's right now I've got you all under my control and the next one they're gonna start punching the buttons for the battle of Armageddon everybody okay with that so we're just kind of we're going to run through them because I promise you I would and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beef say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and brother they'll touched on it this morning they're going to kill those 144 000. they're going to kill those two prophets right right that's right just like they killed the people in the Dark Ages why did they kill the people in the Dark Ages because they went against the Catholic church right any different here are we seeing a pattern we're seeing a pattern God's in a pattern remember God's got a plan and a purpose and his plan and purpose is not just to do us one way and do Israel another no he's going to redeem them the same way he redeems us right and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say and they went on another horse that was red and Powell was giving him to selling him to take peace from the earth what's this guy gonna do he's going to do that those new prophets are going to be preaching and he's going to be anti against anything they say oh yeah because they're going to preach the true word of God but he's not going to sit here at first he's not going to deny it he's going to do just like he did before he's going to ease his way in say well brother Brown was wrong here but over here he's okay and yeah and and you can't really listen to 47 to 63 you know just 63 and above and and now after 63 he really wasn't right then well next thing dude that's to find another profit if he was that confused and I don't think he was actually I know what he was right and I went on another horse it was red and power's given what he's getting a little more power sat on him take peace from the earth that they should kill one another Wars are still going on here there's going to be peace on the earth for a little while but remember what the Bible says about when you hear of Peace then what sudden destruction right where's it going to come from it's going to come from that Beast that Antichrist system that's going to do the killing they're going to kill those 144 000. and the one on another horse that was red take peace from the earth they should kill one another and was given unto him a great sword in other words a word power was given power was given all right and I'll be held and look he opened the third seal and I heard the third Beast say come and see him Behold a black horse he'll sound him a pair of balances in his hand what the gold of the world he's he's accumulating wealth he's not going to quit accumulating well during this time he's going to still accumulate wealth while the two witnesses are preaching bringing 144 000 out just like you and I hey folks those same horses are here today right here right right we're not immune to them yet I said yeah we're not immune to them they're still here they're working on you they're they're working on me they're they're in our brain Santa I wish you'd shut up but remember you see a black you see a white horse he's going to come in just want it right just you okay assistant she's cold and I'm sweating she does have a lot when I'm sitting over here she does it so I can see it she throws it way out like catch it out of my vision and I'll turn it down so I'm not over there now so okay that's all right okay but you're seeing comes a white horse as a red horse and as a black horse just like he's coming down through the church ages as brother Brandon was talking about because remember when he was get up to the Black Horse He was talking about Luther and Wesley a great time of Revival as far as man's intelligence I said man's intelligence right it was the age of man which was that Beast was a man Beast right right same way what's going to happen you think he's going to get any Dumber no he's going to get smarter and smarter because we're gone now he's worried about 144 000 people he's not worried about the bride we're gone we're protected we're in glory so he's not dealing with us and I believe he knows he's got just a little bit of time that's why he's got to kill that 144 000 but when they resurrect and those two prophets resurrect but even when that happens it's going to be a day of Blackness don't you think because when Bailey there is nothing this whole world's going into total Blackness because there's no holy ghost on the earth why do you think the battle of Armageddon is going to be an all-out War there's going to be nothing here to stop it right right see we're not being killed because of the Holy Ghost protecting us right 144 000 during that 1260 days and those two profits the Holy Ghost is going to protect them right from being killed but when they're gone who's going to be there to protect there's nobody there to protect remember the foolish virgins being hunted down like dogs during that time they're being killed all right because you see the killing is not going to be it's not just going to be toward 144 000 right when we leave it's going to be Unleashed around the world it's going to be a worldwide thing the devil is going to just unleash everything he's got because he doesn't have you and he's Unleashed it on us remember the 200 000 000 demons brother Brown said it was least Unleashed on the end time bride to drive her back into our homeland which is the word of God so those two hundred thousand thousand demons are going to come right back over onto the children of Israel or the 144 000 and they're going to direct their power right toward them but God's going to protect them until they're killed but after that watch and I heard the message before be saying measure I'm sorry let's go back to three when he had opened the third seal I hold the third the third third Beast say come and see and I'll be healed and lower Black Horse and hit it selling him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four B say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou not hurt the oil and wine that's what I was just saying now I missed that part I'm sorry I'm glad the Lord brought me back to that but remember brother Ryan said that was not the voice of any of the Beast that was the voice of the Lamb amen right man so they're 144 000 they're going to be protected just like we are by this right here see thou not hurt the what the Holy Spirit in the 144 000 and in the two witnesses you see how they're getting the natural part of this because Jesus preached the seals over there we're talking about wars and rumors of wars and false christs well guess what that's what's going to be there beating on those 144 000 right and I heard the voice in the midst of the 4B say a measure of wheat for penny three measures of barley for a penny because you know what brother Brown said there's going to be famines pestilence there's gonna be all things going on around the world while these two prophets are preaching and we're going to see in a minute I'll read this quote to you where under the Sixth Seal they break these things to the world they are the six seal they're the ones that's going to speak and all these things are going to happen who the two Prophets the two prophets are going to break that sick seal standing on earth right right that's right right and when he had opened the force Hill I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see you know let me hold a Pale Horse his name that said on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given on him for the fourth part of the earth to kill his sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth and the light Rodell said that fourth that fourth that horse is a pale Grizzly Porsche a sickly horse but that's when the power of that Beast is going to be so powerful so he's going to be the one in Thessalonians that walks in and tells those guys says hey no more sacrifices remember in Daniel 70 weeks it says that he'll confirm the Covenant with many for a week but in the midst of the week he will cut it off so after three and a half years or 1260 days everybody with me after 1260 days he's going to walk in and say no you're not gonna do that anymore because of sacrifice and oblations will cease he'll make it stop and he'll say what I'm the guy I'm the one I'm God worship me and the Jews of course 144 000 is going to be gone the two witnesses are going to be gone right so what's going to happen well the fifth seal we know watch what the fish said when he opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that will slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held that's what brother Dale was talking about today and for those of you that that are not following along and I'm not saying that drugstore I'm just saying you come in in the middle of a series because brother Dale and I were more like teachers so we have to you know teach 10 sermons before we get a point across about it and um that's just the way it is but when it opened the fifth seal and he was talking this morning about the souls under the altar that was slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held now if you read the fifth seal that's a fifth seal Jew that's a testimony they held not the testimony of Jesus Christ that's the testimony they have which what we're Jews that's it that's it they don't believe Jesus Christ but God's giving them eternal life because he had to Blind them on the cross he had to Blind them so that you and I could come in so if he blinded them then he's going to have to take that blindness because remember the Bible says blindness in part has happened right so let the Gentiles could come in right so now he's taking the blindness away from the 144 000 but he's still got that fifth sealed Jew that's already dead so he can't he can't redeem them they're already dead all right so he's going to give them eternal life but listen this is connected with 144 000 and a little piece watch this for the testimony we sell when they cry with a loud boy saying how long the Lord holy and proved us thou not judge and avenge our blood see if it was a Christian it wouldn't say avenge our blood right so we know this is the fifth sealed Jew Hitler killed and all the ones down Through the Ages avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth question mark they're asking that question and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants but the Jews that are on the Earth right 144 000 it's alive and also and their Brethren what Jews got to be Jews that they should be killed as they were should be fulfilled so the 144 000 and the two witnesses are going to have to be killed according to here we see that until that fellow sermon also on their Brethren they should be killed as they were should be fulfilled and I'll be home we open the Sixth Seal and though there was a great earthquake the sun became black the sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood and stars of Heaven fell into the Earth even as fig leaves casteth her untimely fruit when she's shaking of A Mighty Wind we can go on but we know that look the kings of the earth and great men rich men so there must be people alive 944 000 and those two witnesses after they're resurrected I don't know how much longer they're going to be around here because the Bible doesn't say the Bible just says there was a boy said come up hither and they took a Rapture if they're around here a day 10 days two weeks months whatever doesn't matter but right here's what's going to happen that is going to run through that Sixth Seal because brother Brown said they are that Sixth Seal they open it whenever they want to so when they open it then buddy that's when it's going to really start but that's when that battle arm again is going to get real hot and heavy but they're not going to be hearing the two Jews or not the two witnesses not going to be there all right so you see that now let's don't do second Thessalonians for time let's just go down to the last quote number six just finish it up with it because we've already Revelation now look here's what's gonna happen The Sixth Seal is the Tribulation period that's what takes place the bride has gone see this is in the Sixth Seal there's no living creature nothing there to say it it's just now God is not dealing with the church no more it's been gone he's dealing with Israel see this is the other side yeah this is when Israel receives the message of the Kingdom what what's the first thing Jesus preached the son of man said the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand first thing and two witnesses are going to preach the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand all right by the two prophets of Revelations 11 remember Israel is a nation God's servant Nation and when Israel is brought in it'll be a national Affair Israel the kingdom age is where David the son of David sits on the throne that's the reason that woman cried thou son of David and David is the son of David God swore by him to David that he'd raise up his son that would take his throne remember the Millennium is not to us I've already said this one time I'm saying it again the Millennium is not to us it absolutely has nothing to do with us right amen right according to description according to promise message the Millennium has nothing to do with us we're eternal we're with our king that's right that has nothing to do with that right right but God promised David that he would have a son that would sit on the throne and would what watch over the 12 tribes of Israel during a time and that's what the Millennium is a millennium is for the Jews it's not for us brother Brown said we're there on a honeymoon well now you don't take your bride somewhere Danny didn't take you somewhere and make you work for a week when y'all did honeymoon right no we're there for a honeymoon to have a wonderful time they gonna bring us things they're going to be our servant right that's the reason the woman cried thou son of David and David is the son of David God swore by him to David that he had raised up his son that would take the throne and it would be an everlasting Throne see it have no end Solomon gave it in a pipe in the temple and Jesus just told them here that there won't be a rock left on one one of them what he's reading Matthew 24. but he's trying to tell them here what he's coming back when are you coming back these things shall take place before I come back and here they are now we're at the time of the tribulation remember when the kingdom is set up on the earth now this may be a little shocking if there's a question you still ask me if you want to put the question up afterwards because I just hit it if you didn't if you don't already know it in the time of the Millennium it's Israel that's a nation the 12 tribes of the nation but the bride is in the palace we live in the temple she's a queen now she's married and all of the Earth shall come into this city Jerusalem and shall bring the glory of it in there all right just get them down for time do you see that in there not the bride not the bride isn't going to be out here laboring in advance no sir she's a bride Queen to the king it's the others that labor out there the nation not the bride amen all right notice these Messengers now these messengers of Revelation 12 these two prophets they're going to preach the kingdom is at hand see the kingdom of Heavens to be set up the last time the last three and a half years of Daniel 70th week promised to the Jews his people remember now that to prove that that this is Daniel's last part of the 70th week I got a question on that for tomorrow see now 70 weeks was promised which was seven years everybody okay with that I know everybody didn't go to church here knows that for a fact that there's there was a seven year Ministry of Jesus Christ promise to restore us and to restore Israel right we just talked about the last half of it the 1260 days that the two prophets preached and Jesus preached the first three and a half himself right right but now remember that doesn't mean that there's only three and a half years left after the Rapture there's one wheat left after the Rapture because you got to restore the city that's right we can't restore the city during the 1260 days right right because the Gentiles are still here just like a red day in Revelations 11 1-2 they left that out of court for the Gentiles so there's no way they can restore the city until everybody's out of the way those 144 000 are going to have to come back to this earth and start that bringing an Appalachian righteousness self-devision and Prophecy in the anoint the most holy during the last half of that week to the Jews everybody understand that right we got it yes okay all right where was that and in the midst of the seven weeks oh wait a minute I got a question for that now 70 weeks was promised which is seven years so it was only a seven year Ministry of Jesus Christ right right three and a half he preached by himself and the three and a half that is due to the Jews the 1260 days all right but now you and I we get the revelation of that three and a half years you see that we get the revelation of that three and a half years just like Jacob worked seven years for Rachel right seven years for Lee anywhere seven years for Rachel which is three and a half that Jesus preached plus the Revelation that we're preaching now is the revelation of that three and a half weeks that Jesus prayed all right so Rachel was the one he was looking for anyway but he got Leah remember which is a type of old old Israel and in the midst of the seven weeks the Messiah was to be cut off to be made a sacrifice that was back there at Calvary right he would prophesy three and a half years and then he'd be cut off for a sacrifice for the people and still a determination that three and one half years are still determined for Israel and that's what we've been talking about today right yes that's the 1260 days notice now we find out that the times time lasts I said three and a half years of Daniel 70 weeks let me explain that a little closer now because I see somebody here that's always watched that now I want to try to make myself clear a teacher notice when the 70 weeks come in when Daniel seen the vision of the time coming and the ending of the Jews but he said there was determined 70 weeks that seven years you see how he's brought that every bit of that 70 weeks down to one seven year period three and a half when Jesus preached here three and a half when Jesus is going to preach to the prophets the 1260 days all right so the whole 70 weeks is income passion 117 year period that's seven years in the midst of it while the Messiah would be here we'd be cut off for a sacrifice now that's exactly what taken place then God built with a gentile so he took out a people for his name as soon as the Gentile church is taken out he taken up the church and when he did the sleeping virgin the church itself the bride went up and the church itself was put into outer Darkness with his weeping and wailing and ashing of teeth and the same time the tribulation falls upon that people when we leave the tribulation begins right and while the tribulation is falling in there comes these two prophets of Revelations 11 to preach the gospel to them and they preach a thousand one hundred and three score days which is actually a thousand two you learned three four days that's why what's exactly what 30 days in a month like the real calendar has is exactly three and a half years that's Daniel's 70th part last part of the 70th week all right God doesn't deal with Israel now you know God's dealing with Israel when we're out of here there you are there you are see how the seals open down there in the church age us how it showed the martyrs right watch him typing back and forth we get the spiritual part they're going to get the natural part because see and now here's these two prophets standing here with the word of God to do anything to Nature they want to they shape the Earth and it shows exactly who does it it's Moses and Elijah because there's their ministry reimbursemented again both men oh my do you see it now see what that six seal is it's those prophets now notice don't let it choke you but watch what happened what opened that seal prophets see amen there you are oh we're living in the eagle day brother what's he talking about Revelation brother head up among the clouds they opened that Sixth Seal they have power to do it amen there's your Sixth Seal coming open until those two prophets opened that sick seal and there is a quote where like brother Dale said last week they are that sixth ceiling right so you see a one through six we see that those seals open to the Jews in the literal standpoint they opened us spiritually now we're preaching them but we have to see that we got to see the spiritual part amen before the natural part can take place because as long as we're still here it can't open to them all right but there's going to be somebody that's going to catch the spiritual part there's going to be somebody that's going to say I see that and they're going to apply that to their life and like brother now said justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the opening of the word and toward the adoption series you got first horse second horse third horse and fourth horse then five six and seven is your fifth seal six seven so he's still showing how it's done and who does it Christ does all those right it's nothing we've done it's all Jesus Christ then it goes to two prophets and they do the same thing they stand over there and nothing can come against them right they open that seal they see see they see what's going on they're like we do now we see the opening of the seal in the spiritual part where they're going to come over there and realize they're in the natural opening of the seal but they've got to call out a group of people according to Redemption which the seals are Redemption that's right but we'll get into it next time maybe Lord willing the next time we we Minister we'll we'll show the Feast of the trumpets because the trumpets have to sound if the trumpets are the same to them as a seal guard to us then there's got to be a connection between those two just like I said about the atonement and all those things like that it's a wonderful study I know people I've heard ministers many times say that that the Feast of the trumpets was so messed up that brother Brown didn't know what he was talking about I'm tired of listening to those people I'm tired of that amen I'm tired of it I'm tired of people talking about my profit that's right I want us to stand up one day and do like brother Rams said I want us to look at people and say you're not preaching what Apollo Creek right you're not preaching what William Brown and preaching and I say that myself to anybody that comes against the prophet saying he was wrong right yeah if he's wrong we need to find another one because we got to find somebody that's right to get us out of here because remember we were talking about righteousness do you know what righteousness means to be right if you're wrong you're not righteous that's why God's not wrong when God brings a message and he says that he says it's thus said the Lord then that you know what the problem is me that's right that's right if you can put it in Scripture Richard Marlow right you put it in scripture we put it in scripture if we put it in Scripture I don't care what anybody says I still know what the word says and brother Brown couldn't be anything but a word Prophet that's right he got it from the word he caught the mind of God the revelation of what we need he caught that and brought us that love letter out of that Bible same thing those two prophets are going to do they're gonna say you missed it and this is where you missed it I don't they don't have to take a message book over there they're going to prove it to him out of the Bible and you know what they gonna prove it to him out of the Old Testament that's right the Old Testament because remember the Jews don't care a thing about New Testament because I don't believe but when the Messiah comes they're going to say okay look now we got a whole book right right now New and Old Testament this is where you missed it and now look all right here's what God was saying about you that's right you're in here 144 000 12 000 out of every tribe but you know what you and I are going to have to see the same thing that they see that God in my name's in here too I may be a gentile and and I may not be my name name because my name is in the book Samuel you know but if I don't see my name in here like the 144 000 they're gonna have to see their name in the book because that book in Revelation 5 that we were talking about that was the name of the redeemed right and you can only be considered in Redemption if you see your name in the book because if your name's not in the book you're not considered in Redemption Glory man so the 144 000 they're gonna have to see their name brother Mark in the book just like you and I are gonna have to see our name in the book to see that we have been redeemed right then when we see and everything's open then guess what this is going to go right over to Israel not a quote book those two prophets are going to say there was a group of gentiles dogs that's right that believed this and took a Rapture and you know what they're going to say sister Johnny what's your problem what's your problem you're God's chosen he knows there's going to be 144 000 of you whether you like it or not there's going to be 144 000 you're gonna make it amen amen that's what I've always said you know I've always said there's going to be a bride confess for every one of us but that's Catholicism he's not a priest right when it comes to like being a Catholic priest he's not gonna do pants on you and and you make it because he makes it you gotta make it for yourself because the Bible said we're all priests and kings and we're Reign Over this Earth but you know what God's got to come to us first yeah right man here's my whole point God's got to come to us first sure through the opening of the seals amen through the opening of Revelation 6 1 to 6 19 that's got to open up to you and I right right that's why Prophet had to come and he had to put those pieces together he's the only one who could do it to make it a beautiful picture because if you read straight through six one to 19 you can't understand all right because it kind of jumps around a little bit but according to the prophet it's all laid out perfect and if you don't listen to him it's all laid out perfect right and when they take it and lay that down to that 144 000 they're gonna say where did you get those scarves right he's gonna say in the house of my friend right right a group made it over there in America out of the most hideous nation in the world out of laodice sister Gail the most the worst of worst those two witnesses are going to say God pulled out a group of people right and they made it because of this right here so we're preaching to you today repent yes and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I hope they feel that Jordan River full of them baptize them right there where Jesus started every bit of the bat where John started baptizing I hope they baptized a whole 144 000 right there in the in the Jordan River but you see now you and I though we're going to be in glory but right now you and I are going to have to take those seals because the sales was given for this guy right here that's right exactly right right the seals were given for the Redemption of this body not for the soul it is for the soul part of it but remember there's a lot of people didn't get the opening of the seals it's going to be in the bride Son of God Ministry that's right right right that's right but the son of man Ministry is this guy's gonna get changed that's right amen which is the opening of The Seven Seals which is the opening of the trumpet so the of the vowels and the plague showing us that God's doing something right here like Dad said this morning the greatest battle ever fought well Armageddon is going to be the greatest battle there was on the face of the Earth right right between men religions well guess what what's fighting you now religion right religion is what's killing us right and right here this is the battle of Armageddon for us but thank God we're not going to be here when the literal part happens right but we're going to overcome because there's no weapon formed brother Aaron there's no weapon formed amen there's no weapon formed amen that's going to take this guy right here right right and put it like this it's not Us beside Christ it's not a Perugia right no that's not standing here but God's standing in here now that's right he wants this Temple this is the Temple of the Holy Ghost let's stand right this is what's going to the Jews not this literal man you see Samuel down junior standing in front of you right right but it's going to be the Revelation that we get amen the revelation we get brother Bonnie that's what that's why we got to get the Revelation right amen the Revelation has got to be correct or it can't go to Israel that's right you can't take a false Doctrine to them Jews that's right it's like that Jim said he said you can't you can't he won't take it so anything contrary to the word to me is transarian I am that's right because where did the trinitarian doctrine come from the prophet said come from the pits of hell right so if we don't see one true and living God we're sure not going to be able to take it to Israel right let's sing song they're doing a great job aren't they great job if there is a future this is our future amen yeah who's singing the move is on what page is that 473 page 473 the move is on this is gonna go right over foreign we got just a few minutes we'll go remember at five o'clock we'll come back up here or we decided when we were going to do it yoga come out from the back say something Yes No Maybe she's gonna have to stand on top of the building this thing almost my latest son I always saying okay foreign us classroom what's up because you know they know we missed Jehovah maybe I miss Jehovah God they know him as a seven compound names of Jehovah but they don't think he's come yet what a bless the thing to know that he's already come and we can call him all these names and we get all these Redemptive blessings before Israel gets them because see look how look what a look what a God that we served and if we turn him down look what we get right right we get blinded brother Brown said God blinded Israel on purpose he said if you're blind you do it yourself right and there's no cure for that there's no seal for that there's no Redemption for that if you turn him down you can't say no God you didn't tell no only to Israel he blinded Israel so he's the one that's going to redeem them amen right we blind our own eyes remember I read you that quote the other day and he blind if we blind our own eyes there's no Redemption for that right you and I are just on our way to hell so you and I realize one thing's for sure we ought to be the Most Blessed people on the face of this Earth amen knowing that God has come to us showed us Redemption first showed us full Redemption and now he's going to take that little part and he's going to send it over to the ones that should have been his wife Israel should have been his wife they turned him down exactly so when they turned him down he still couldn't forget him because he said they're woven in my thinking they're just as how can you count the Stars how can you count the Sands of the sea he says I can't forget Israel because there's people right but he had to take out a little piece to bring a bride in because he was looking at Rachel because she was very pretty Leah was the owner but Rachel was very beautiful the Bible said and Jacob worked seven years to get Rachel and that's what he's done for you and I he's worked all this time to get a bride ready to get somebody who will be able to stand in this end time and not let this bother him and not let that bother him and not let this bother and not let this false Doctrine over here and his false Doctrine over here remember he's going to come and knowledge is going to increase and we'll uh what is it we said about the elite silly women women churches that's what's going to happen he's even going to get give the church a strong delusion that they they believe in that I lie and be damned by it that's right believe a lie and God's going to let that happen but not to his not to his bride all mine who in the world would treat their wives like that almighty God we serve never will let us fail because we're predestinated not to fail you and I are going to make it amen amen we're going to make it by the skin of our teeth but we're going to make it remember the five wise virgins said hey we just got enough oil to get us in you need to go get your own that's right in other words I've come to church for a long time and I've gotten I'm full I don't got any more I give you you should have come to church when the door's rolling that's right that's right you should have listened to the message that's what they're going to say you should listen you should have heard we got just enough to get us in but you know what that is just enough to get us in we are going to make it we're gonna make it Glory you know the Lord amen all right anything can be said before we go now I don't know where we're going to have the class here or downstairs so just hang around those of you that's going to stay I think sister Michelle and the uh the two friends she has that are here with her I've seen brother Daniel likes her too you know I've known them for a long time we we started going to youth camps way back in the late 90s and she was just a young kid back then so she's I told her I said you're a pastor's wife now I said because God started putting that highlighter in your hair that's right look at my mom keep gray headed dude so you pray for pastors lives not just for pastors you pray for pastors wives my brother Brown said when he died called the man he called the woman with her women so you pray for her too because I'm going to tell you something it's tough it's real tough but just keep him in your prayers thank you thank you for coming honestly really did um we have went through the Financial Peace University class we finished it last Sunday we don't have all of our numbers tallied up but I know for a fact that we saved that we paid off about 70 or 80 000 in debt in nine weeks paid off around that seventy eight thousand dollars in debt and we avoided almost a hundred thousand dollars in debt that we would have had and we not have taken the class so you're looking at about a two hundred thousand dollar turnaround much less uh 14 or 15 000 I think they that we put in savings between that nine week period so you know we we trust in God and we all gathered together last Sunday downstairs and we held hands and we prayed and I pray for each one of them and we've all prayed for each other and it takes prayer right but it takes some of this right here God give you a brain like brother Brady said I've told you many times brother Brady said God give you five senses you need to start using them right all right because you I don't believe you can be a well-rounded Christian if you don't have your finances straight I just don't I just do not believe that because God don't want you to be wrong in one place and right in another this has taught me to look and and try to do things in a Godly way first trust God sure and like I was telling them a couple weeks ago we were somewhere and I said well I told him that brother Collins Thursday night I said look I said we're going to trust God I'm gonna trust God for a new job so brother Mark I'm not coming in for about three months I'm gonna sit at home and wait for God to bring me a job that don't work no God wants you to do he wants you to have a party you know why it's like Dave Ramsey said he said you you need to see the part of giving because remember he read the scripture he said God gave his only begotten son so God forgive her we know he did it himself but the scripture says he gave his only begotten son right so God's a giver that's what God wants us to do he don't need our money but he wants you to give to get the blessings right go ahead Malachi says you pay your time I'll pour out a blessing read the whole Book of Proverbs The Book of Proverbs tells you that if you handle any finances right God give you more to handle right if he doesn't he won't give me any more right same thing with the word of God he knows you're not going to handle the word of God right he's not going to give you any more God's a good daddy amen amen and remember God's knows are better than any yeses God tells you no that's the best yes you'll ever get in your life because he knows what you'll do if he says yes and he knows what you'll do if he says no and if he says no you know one thing's for sure brother Eddie you would have done something wrong if he would have said yes because when God says no Then you think that is the best yes you'll ever get because he's a heavenly father that knows the end from the beginning if we would have known the end from the beginning we'd have begun our lives a lot different but we don't we're finite and living in a finite world we need an infinite God though to come and teach us and in scripture there's 800 scriptures about money and finances in the Bible so it's very important I believe to have a good well-rounded Christian Life you got to have your finances straight because you know what Hey Brother Dale like you said he paid for all these kits and probably four or five thousand dollars worth of kits he needs the money now guess what we got him to give back to him if you'll handle your finances right you'll have a little bit set aside that you can give the money back if he needs that money right God works in mysterious ways but I'm really glad that that you know probably 90 percent of y'all have went through this class and it has really um some it helps more than others that's okay he's gonna take just a little part of it and watch your finances and watch your life then God's going to bless you yes sir God will bless you he said I'll pour out the windows of Heaven you know you do your tithes and offerings right on correct the windows handled so let's take him at his word try sometimes just try sometime make sure everything's well-rounded you know you you what I said many times when we first started this course even when we taught the first one was that I wanted to see husband and wife closer together because you two are one whether you like it or not right right yes thank you you two are one whether you like it or not and all the finances is one anyway God give it to you a hurry to one it's all together right it's his and he's just gonna let you operate for a little while that's right but remember God gave his only begotten son so he's a giver he's the first Giver because he give his life for us so now what we give back to God that's just something we do because we love him I don't pay my ties because I have to I pay my ties because I love the Lord and I don't pay that tire check say God now you said you'd pour out of a blessing no it just comes with the territory right brother Gabe how many times have we seen now me and brother Gary's walked in life together a good bit I mean how many times have you seen God bless you if you'll do what he says all right that's pretty simple in it I'm gonna bless you when you do what he says just the way it is so let's bless him by asking him to bless us yeah right and give us a good week sure absolutely you know the secret to all of this is work yes we got a daughter if she had one job in her lifetime she's 55 years old somewhere and uh she's uh lost a lot of jobs that's went out of business in her lifetime but on Monday morning she was temp service and he's blessed her and the Secret's work absolutely and I think we've lost it yeah as a nation did that yes absolutely we're not a working Nation that's what Dave Ramsey said he said you wanna he said you wanna have money he said get a job that's not gonna that's entitlement God's not he's not you know he's not going to give you a big wad of money but you know what if you go out and make money and you do well and you put it back into his work yep he's going to bless you it's like brother dick I've said many times and I'll say this for the glory of God not because he's my father but my dad's worked all his life and he's got everything he needs but you don't want to give God the glory first and he does the things right he handles well Mama handles the finances right but they're a team we suppose I'm working together a member of free spirits and nerds you know the Nerds the one that saved the money and the free spirit spends it but it takes both of you thanks a little free Spear and it takes a little nerd I was a free spirit and Jim was a nerd but now we're both nerds we're real nerdy now because we don't yeah there's the free spirit right there Susan's had to throw the net over him and sent your bottom stuff flying out of his pocket you know it's a full-time job right it's a full-time job but you know what you realize that that's what this course does it realize it helps you realize what you are and you work in that you worked in your ability now I'll I'll become a nerd now because I don't spend money like I used to but man my uncloth is full y'all see it next time Saturday I'm gonna sell some of that stuff I don't need it all but I had it at one time and it was a bunch of stuff and I shouldn't have I should have been saving that money or or you know I've always wanted to be where a minister walked in and needed something and him a hundred dollars handy fifty dollars handing 200 whatever and just give it out of the goodness of your heart not have to not have to go back and worry about where you're going to pay a bill or not right right you know it feels good I've had to I've been able to do that recently you know and and give that little girl down that uh uh Ryan's the other day she had a table of eight people they left her two pennies for a tip oh two pennies and she was about in tears because somebody picked the two pennies up somebody we were a bunch of us were there somebody picked the two pennies out and said what is this and she said well that's all I got out of eight people at a table and she stuck them in her apron and she's wiping the table off you know and I'm sure she was thinking in her mind probably not very good thoughts yeah I'm human I'd probably the same way but I just reached in my pocket and I got a 20 bill out I just stepped in there all right we're stuck in her apron she wants that she said I don't have your table you know her table was over here I said that's for the people that didn't couldn't give you a tip if they couldn't afford it then I can afford it I'll just give you twenty dollars she did cry then I mean she was bawling man she was crying but it makes you feel good you know to be 14 and a half percent because no 120 and make her a day we're still human people we still live in a human world right just like sister Michelle coupons you may not think a thing about them but you know what if God give you 90 percent of your money back he only asked for 10. right he get he owns 90 of that 90s hits too but he gives you that 90 to be a steward of right and I read you a quote not too long ago for brother Brown said you're going to give an account for the money you spend apparently you're going to give an account for it right I don't want to have that on my slate I don't have that on my sheet where I have to give an account for for spending something idly or or stuff like that but take that 90 and if you can if you can correctly use that 90 percent you'll never out give God right but if we can save from this couponing class then I believe it's God I believe God helps us because he knows we're humans and he knows we have ups and downs and problems and ins and outs and you know what what's most of our problems money come on baby money is most of our problems if we have a problem in an area you say well no it's me and my husband fighting oh let's dig on back this a little bit further that we ain't got the money for this or we don't have the money for that or we don't have the money for that right so it's pretty much all money and we hate that but we still live in a world where um we're not able to give out anything but money tomorrow when we go to work we're expecting money as pay and then when we go to Walmart they're expecting money in return for the services that we give them so money has got a good part in our life you know but maybe that uh since we got sister Michelle here she can help us keep some of that money coach couponing will help you keep some of that money and brother Benny helped us out by by showing us some things too he's a pretty good coupon guy himself so we thank God that we got people that that like that that took enough emphasis to say hey I'll pay for that yeah and you come and you learn learn how to do you know do your finances learn how to do your money right because I don't want to get I got enough I'm gonna have to give an account for yeah I hope money I hope is not one of them brother didn't sister girl I look at them it's four o'clock and I'm gonna talk another 30 minutes brother didn't accept the Gale has always been a good example she told me one time they didn't have enough money to where church was helping you right when Dick broke his leg or something couldn't work they brought food to your house now that's the low part of of their life right it's like Dave said he said broke his he said broke shouldn't be a way of life broke is just a passageway through we've all been broke in our life somewhere right we've all been broke in our life somewhere brother Dean's sister paid the same way now that they what they do they become smart with their money right and now you know what they're retired and they're not having to pinch pennies they go out and do what they want to do and they enjoy life I I applaud anybody that can retire and enjoy themselves about anybody I don't care if you're 50 years old my brother I don't hold one thing against him retired when he was 44 years old and I don't God knows I know never I know I just wish I could do that but he you know what he's doing well I was out messing playing with my money he was putting his up he was saving it and you know what he can retire 44 years old so you see and he can enjoy life and he can give money when people need money and he can give to the church when the church needs it because he done what he started the right way and he listened to Mama where I didn't so wait yes I think the most important thing about money and having money is make sure you give your money to God first person we saw a time in our life that we did not have money to tithe if we had him we might not have had enough grocery money coming in but he made the decision that we're going to tithe regardless right and we started tithing even when we didn't have it right and I don't know what happened but somewhere along the line God just worked a miracle right and and maybe 25 saving never touching it and it just first thing you know and then he was telling Brother Ray the other day I got a statement one time it's been years ago and I handed it to him and said explain this to me and he looked at and he says Gail you've got over a hundred thousand dollars in this account and I had you know I didn't check them I didn't pay any attention to him or anything and that's God sure that's right nothing but God that's right because we were young with kids didn't know how to save didn't know how to do anything but he knows how sure so make sure you tired no matter what no matter what how poor you are make sure you give God you've never seen a righteous forsaken or received begging for Prince or don't worry if you might have to eat some soup and ramen noodles but our water in ramen noodles and then noodles and rum and water whichever one but he said he would supplier needs not our wants he'll Supply your need all right back to the store of brother brother Nick sister Gayle they weren't a four-letter word work they worked hard and they had they they're able to enjoy now brother they ain't seem to pay the same way Mom and Daddy and some of your others but you see people come to the end part of their life the one that's struggling I don't like to see that I don't like to see it June's mother lives on 900 a month 900 a month how many of y'all can live on 900 a month we hardly live on 900 a week but she wasn't smart with her money so she's come down to where we have to take care of her a little bit well thank God we can take care of her but I don't want to be a burden on anybody I I don't I don't want to do that like I said I want my slate clean and my sister Gail said pay your tires God will pour out the windows of Heaven he will bless you if you pay your time right and you know what one year when I when I owned jng one year I paid more time June and I paid more tithes than I made the first year I was on salary at McDonald's I made about eight thousand dollars a year seventy nine hundred and twenty dollars I think was my first salary in 1979 at McDonald's and in 1996 seven June and I tithe about 8 800. so I tithe more than I made and I'm sure you probably have too tithe more than you made your first job and you wonder how you made it on the 80 on the 7 900 and here you are giving God 8 800 and you're living 20 times better so listen got to do that I'm sorry to keep you on but got to do that God will keep his promises you and I are going to have to be able to keep ourselves we promised something somewhere we better be able to keep that promise see I don't make promises much because I might have to break them because I'm human but God it don't matter to him he'll make a promise and it doesn't matter he'll see it fulfilled don't pay your tires pay your offering do the right thing pay your debts like Dave said he said here show me one place in the Bible that that's good there's not one scripture in the Bible that said dead is good but I know we have to have it brother Brown even said for you rent and car and stuff like that we don't we can't accumulate money and help not have rent but we not we not have twenty thousand dollars on a credit card that we don't even know where to win our Panther on credit card don't even know where it went at least with a car you're going to look at four wheels and you got a way to get to work so you look at a house and you can get my house and you can be you know cool when it's hot and hot when it's cool but when you just go out in frequency spend money and you don't know where it went to and you don't know you got to pay it back right so that's the part that God don't want you to do he don't want you to be in so much debt till you can't get out right I don't know where I started here but let's play our heads the heavenly father truly I thank you Lord for all the blessings you've given and I thank you for giving us Lord a pastor that cares about his people that cares about their finances it cares about their life Lord because as you as a Shepherd Lord you care about your sheep and I pray Lord that even coming down to the deacons and the assistance and the song leaders and all the all the ones that call this their church that we would truly be an example and and show others Lord how that you have surely poured out the windows of Heaven and you poured out a blessing that we couldn't contain Bobby you give us good health you give us good finances and most of all and most important you give us the word I believe you've given it to us here Lord pure and unadulterated now if we'll just take that word Lord and apply it to our heart apply it to our life apply it to our being father and let us become Lord truly a son that you're proud of a daughter that you're proud of the Lord Lord I pray that you'll be with each one give them a good
