TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign was born in fornication and it had its influence on somebody even though it was the wrong Revelation but it had influence so that's why we got to give an account forever how to work is honey in other words we want to know what's been said young people all right hold people's the same all right please and I I didn't tell her this is quite a long story and tell us I mean I don't think he should have took that long what you say that I said hello yelling when she tell you you come back and tell somebody and we're gonna get this thing down in a few minutes how about we need Amazing Grace how you doing in Jesus saying let every man worry me what and let nine be the one I think we gotta stay with the words I understand this here now the prophet God said do not never testify nothing negative every time when you confess I still feel bad today I guess you you go right straight back into the same old rut that you was in in the beginning but there's not a man or a woman in here that that baptized with the Holy Ghost but what would start your confession I believe I'm lost I'm losing the Holy Ghost I believe it's gold from me I need I you got you go right you go right now you never you never you never listen close you'll never live above your confession all right well you deserve you tell something you're gonna have some negative here she comes she ready to tell somebody at least she ready to kill somebody oh Hallelujah but right here hello man right come out of that we can't do with this we're gonna need to make some Grease foreign bless now she's ready to tell them two things she opened the door so it wasn't good enough so she had to tell him again hey ready look at it I cannot wait to tell what I heard no you need to tell one more person tell somebody else well make sure you hear the right thing we're gonna be a little weekend best after we heard and that's when we got to give it to California right Hallelujah when they heard that Jesus was born in fornication somebody should have checked the word but they didn't remember check your word they just said well so and so said that Jesus Mama Mary was pregnant before Joseph come to her and somebody else would have told a little bit and somebody told a little bit on that and by the time they got to Jesus right they said we're not before in the fornication what did they get there from they did not get it from the word because the word is in it and you said through the word hella answer for saying for saying something of giving the answer for this thing you hear the word dude yeah oh praise God she cannot wait to tell what he heard but she here and we want to deal with the absence hope this be something to me abuse it was all yes Amazing Grace one of these all the stuff they've been told in the message people tell things and say things and when you get to it it ain't never you notice that people that the message is one of the biggest news carrier in the world I've been movements and people go to Jordans Supply the work for the mail company they already drinks right huh no I'm gonna let you do it enjoy it now and you will have to tell because I want to put this on the board he told the women's Hotel there it is tell everybody I went to New York they went hunting they came back on Wednesday and they went fishing okay thanks me they did they win she said where you said we went and then we're doing what they came back on Wednesday and went fishing me and brother Dale yeah okay I would like to say what we were saying it never come out the way you say it I would like to tell you that brother Dale and me and brother Sammy there with with with with with Dylan in New York and then Wednesday we 2012 we come back and we leave and on a fishing trip with me and brother Dale everything never told to the point cause somebody had to bring it in and say it this way and somebody said it that way like the point of it is the way it say here how about we got to stay with the words answer for everything that we say right now you said now Jesus said here I said to you to ever had a word a man shall speak Bishop give an account in the day of judgment right some people got a yes and a no for everything yeah some people know everything if you ask them a question they just know it didn't write a room but they got to know it is when a man always got an answer something wrong for anything more than that that will become will be will be come to sin you you're not supposed to even joke and cut up with one another what you say what you saying what kind of job I'm talking about the captain jokes that's just a sense of humor I'm telling jokes right you know one thing you know joking about maybe something that's fiction a fiction joke but you know but to tell something is true that happened you know anything happening it's just funny in life in other words you know how many this thing happened and find that funny life I tell the story of mosa I don't want them I got the attitude I was looking in the mirror I waited about 270 pounds and I was flexed and the devil will say look at this you have Tony Atlas and my wife walked in there and she says to me I hope you don't think you look good Eagles this thing ain't really happy but even the ones but see people we we all got a sense of humor and brothers ain't even God got us to you but when he come now to make another lying jokes and things yeah not the joke that we want to see God will make you give and count for every other word that you speak do not do that the Bible said that you have to give an account forever out of work so what what kind of people we ought to be people that frankly Stern love and sweet kind never never a bunch of nonsense always going along so we got to bring it to the point that Lord I'm trying to get my mind in order I'm trying to keep us out here the best thing for me to know if I don't see it in the word let me leave it alone we don't want to kill it but that's the question is old people just saying the only thing that we got that we know is true is you know the Holy Spirit we can hear these outer words outliness come here uh Jesus is coming on a uh this year and somebody trying to put a date on it somebody say he's out in the desert I mean they don't even go out there and bleed that he said that's an outer word how did they say he's in the secret bride tree chamber he tell her not to even bleed him please because where are you he's not in the secret bride trailer he's not in the desert he's in you so we just need us God to Open the Eyes of My Heart and let me see Jesus Christ in me and you know we need to see Jesus Christ everyone the only way I want to see Jesus Christ I gotta find somebody with the baptism that only goes right I gotta find somebody that got the word on the inside somebody that praising God that's not how to work come out of your mouth you ever bless a curse you know something that we don't understand how powerful words is we don't realize this this somebody you know sometimes we got somebody that we against you know and then you know we don't realize what we say and we shouldn't we should and we got somebody with this we need to get on our knees and pray to God to take and give me created me a clean heart so I can deal with it so we'll see that person that we're against and the first time we shake his head what we say God bless you but you do not bless him right and he didn't get going better than you doing you're thinking why you keep prospering because you keep blessing well you know we we just got to deal with it deal with the judges of things and then we turn around and say honey God bless you yeah oh boy you know what he gonna be blessed and he's like oh why you ain't dealing with him because you keep listening I need jokes you need to say Lord have your worry on my child and can you get into the Denture because if you keep saying bless him he gonna keep on getting good yeah out of your own mouth and the people just keep on getting blessed and then just keep on because why it's in your mouth how did you like love and every other word is in your mouth how do you say people how do I love you gotta start speaking it right right something that you don't like you got to say Lord give me the Divine love that I can overcome this Spirit you've got to speak it so your body can come to it right right it don't Just Happening by accident a chance you've got to speak the word right yeah that's right we we've got to come to that point you know how we get a bad service you know what Curry had a bad service the mouth yeah right and I'm so tired because I'm sitting back in the office I'll get to sleep so good and I think your boy this too just let it be I kept looking at the closet I wake up a few minutes I got 10 more minutes we ain't got 10 more minutes that's the best sleeping you get Hallelujah you know some people talk their way what talking about here they speak their way I don't feel like I just feel like tonight after they think the church is going to be so down speak that right speak that and you will create an act of right to pull the spirit of God down in our mouth so much power in you and remember to say if you ever recognize who you are he said you could speak a world into existence but first of all you got to speak about the point of it is the people curse their own self right it ain't God putting it or you gotta healed you but they say how you feel I'm sick Ness the sickness to say that you're gonna curse your own self how you been because you've had power either out of your mouth to bless or good deal honey will you say I'm sick you gotta curse yourself to do that why did I say I'm here how you feel I feel healed amen and we all got to come through that and I gotta go do that right Lord let me get control of my tongue and the only thing they can control the tongue is the baptism of the Holy Ghost I preached a message years ago don't nobody ever preaching him but the one thing the message I picked years ago that well what Adam lost control of was the power of his children because Adam was created to speak the word that's right and Adam lost control of the power to speak right Adam should have been able to speak and the devil should have left Adam had power to get rid of the devil right right do you realize that all of them had bubble to get rid of the devil animal giving you Dominion on the fishes I'm giving you the meaning of the beasts of the field I'm giving you Dominion out of the word of God is in your mouth speak amen why did God kill that demon second coming up and he had the problem get rid of it yeah I don't want you to exist anymore it wouldn't have been no such thing as a devil right he had the word to speak about existence and if God gave him that dominionship my God giving you the same dominionship he giving you power over the flesh over the devil and over the world now how are you gonna overcome the world the same way that Jesus did Jesus had to speak the word get behind me said get the hint it is Ricky amen I mean he had to speak the word how did it in order for us to get rid of the word the world is bad enough we gotta start speaking the word how do young people if you're battling rock and roll music you battle with lust you bother with internet pornography or whatever it is the only way you could ever come to overcome that you gotta raise her and make it be your mind latest heateds in me the heaters in the world you've got to start telling your faces you want your body amen you want

down honey he did not get back I've been beat yeah you know and he didn't even know what you know he didn't even have the message you had he believed in a different Bible did you believe but he had favored what he believed and he took his confession and he made his body come subject to that right and only not only did Muhammad Ali believe it that he was the greatest come on for Muhammad Ali will
