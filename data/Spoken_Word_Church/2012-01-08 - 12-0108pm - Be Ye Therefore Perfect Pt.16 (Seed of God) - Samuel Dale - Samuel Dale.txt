the eyes of my Mia you I live around power oh we go honey in the Oh right Oh amen any other day male they got earlier Missy hey see about in the house on the Lord you like turning the scripture turn away where we've been reading Matthew 5 and we will go to 1st John 3 Matthew 5 1st John 3 remember now that will be having bible study the Lord willing this coming Saturday six o'clock general questions which means we just whatever comes off the floor if we you know go through the things in having a good time and like I told you we were committed on today had been comments questions and thanks but i'm pretty sure that will be next sunday anyway but we'll get there one of these days so write down all of your comments your thoughts your questions and and things about what to what we've been talking about and in everything so that we can see don't ever forget what we're talking about is be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect now can I translate that dis away be there for perfect because your father the perfect one is dwelling within you would that be a change of the scriptures or would that be the thought of what is being said alright so let's think of these things any other announcements that you may call liverman in the signup sheet is downstairs for me for the banquet and I opened hoping everybody will come and deal with it so we have a good time is sitting around talking and fellowshipping you know you know all the end the Lord they may it's not that somebody oh there was a man sent us a note about City a couple of years ago his father had come down with cancer and he requested it we pray for him and said that he's living now for two years and doing well so we just appreciate the Lord you know we're doing under was about to forget social think them about that let's pray father we thank you again we ask you to just help us now give us understanding ears that we may be able to hear what you have to say because Lord is truly in the hearing which were the miracle is that so have your way that your beloved be with us forgive our sins cleanse us Lord from all unrighteousness and let your light shine in our hearts let's wait in June and them as they travel at home and just be with each one let your love be with each and every one of us we thank you for all things you said you'd give them to us freely guide us now keep us in Jesus name Amen Matthew 537 through 48 and then snake time drop down to verse 45 square we already be getting the point by now and you may be the children of your father which is in heaven where you make us his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust or if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so me therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect alright now let's go over to first John you remember this morning we were reading very nice day at work says the disc generation that was to be created you know don't lose that point now but what we were talking about this generation that was to be created we are that generation the born-again believer is the generation that was to be created so don't lose that man's as we go on through our thought first John 3 we start with verse 21 verse 1 behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us then we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not we love now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is right and everyone that had this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law and you know that he was manifest to take away our sins and then he'll his notes in now remember that and in him is no sin men who serve about it in him sinnath not whosoever senate that's not seen him neither known him little children let no man to see you he didn't do it righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous you have committed sin is of the devil for the devil sent it from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifest that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seizure landed in him and he cannot sin because he's born of God in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil what one of them notes in the other one truly just sin on whosoever does not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother you may be seated the Lord is blessing to the reading of the world no I'm going to do a little different this afternoon because what I'm going to do or try to do is you know you gently always you I do I try to just give you a little salt and then build up to a point and then blame I thought on to you you know go from dark and I found that sometimes it that works okay but a lot of times you're tired more out of sleep every time I get to my point to you don't get the point all you get is a backdraft but that's all right I understand so what I'm going to do is just tell you up front okay then we'll just tell you up front what I'm talking about and then that way you can make up your mind and do whatever and those on the internet and you see got the little button that said off you just put it off and forget it you know know how to worry about it but now I believe the scripture itself is self-explanatory yeah right then that way being self explanatory we don't have to worry about it so we read here in first join all right we'll just take your pointer four brothers put it back up the first Johnny three and you know that he was manifest to take away our sins all right now remember that he has manifested take away our sins okay but what does it say and in him is no sin okay I would highlight those two thoughts in my mind at least and then you drop down to verse 8 he that committeth sin is of the devil and here's the devil's children okay for the devil sent it from the beginning now all of us before we receive the new birth we had closer kin to us then God you agree with the Book of Ruth all right we got a closer kin we won't get folks to the devil we were born his children all right sensor will rot self-explanatory okay so he that committeth sin is of the devil but the devil said it from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifest what purpose that he might destroy the works of the devil now what is the works of the devil oh it's adultery it's this it's um you know murder stealing that's not to work for the devil the works of the devil is to provoke the word amen when I'm in the church eight books as to discredit I discredit the word now that's the works of the devil I like what brother Steven Wilson another day were saying about it he said we want to put the devil away under some word that's way over that way in the he started out showing how that you know even the devil then the beginning just wanted to be like god no because that's you know he doesn't want to be so separated he's he different we call him the guy with the horns but Loretta said he's not down at the beer joint in the slot pins you know of the world he said he's in church they don't want to go to those things he's in church no lot closer what we think believe what it says men the works of the devil which is to destroy the revealed Word are to keep you and I from seeing the revealed Word that's his words did any tactic he can use he will use those to try to move hurt us remember one word in the beginning all right he said that I would have to be so we'll all we miss it that way all right so nothing watching it whosoever is born of God does not commit sin why milder he does not commit sin now we used to try to translate that we used to try to change commit as I'm being um we don't deliberately do it we don't do that we don't do this no I just read it and say what it said me whosoever is born of God does not commit sin now every person in the world is born of God by natural creation we said this morning but that is not the person this is talking about through this is talking about those who are born again whosoever is born bill God if you have the new birth all right he does not commit seen what for his Cedars would seek remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God all right and here's the whole thing in a nutshell a born-again believer as eternal life in their soul but our bodies spirit is still in Satan's delaney you know motivated by worldly things and it's not all Rome because we have to live we have to do have children we have to be husband life etc cuz that's all part of life all right now in doing that then I want you to think about something a person that's perfect remember is a person that I can anything be credited to you where you would be called perfect alright and see then the new birth is the only thing is perfect you agree leave Earth the only thing about us is perfect all right now then we come through with um David blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin is that some kind of a person that is a special seed special something oh my family come over on my fire you know what is it they would be a person that would God do not have you seen so we found that out that you have to be that man right Joey we're dead to ourselves and born again then we have the new birth and what is the new birth it's the birth of the word in God's Word is his seed right so it's the birth of the seed a lot of people spend over time trying to figure out where these come from i come from what was and we was here whatever it was and they'll consider 15 the way i read that scripture looks whoever is born of God does not commit sin 1 because God remains any just god that's not sinning right true God and in Seoul we are perfect and you cannot see them now we've got a lot of scriptures so it might take us go to services on this point those you save you have no say in your liar but the Bible says huh now so we got to get it right hey go now it's the seed of God which is the revealed Word now see without the Holy Spirit is no good right it's just see this letter Paul said in the letter killeth so when I'm saying seed you saying well I took this see you know I took some corn in a seed and I planted it all right because I've got to see well not what if they like that mechanically to look exactly like a seed you know it's running explained about the cornflakes and things got all the nutrition everything in it you remember but don't have no life what good is it what good is the word of God if it's not revealed all right no now to me then the new birth is the words you heard received as the topless says about them kelp is it says about it and then the Holy Spirit hang on the death hit hawks and gave life to that seat because a seed without life is a dead sea alright so now when it's saying whosoever is born of God does not see him for his seed reason we can't sin in the soul you can't see him with you have the new earth right right if you have a new birth in your so you can't sin because you would be saying that God was a sinner cause the sea of God remind Athenian right so are you gonna say the City of God seems no minded blood what am I saying the seed of God is what cannot see him that seed of God must come into our soul we made eternal by the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that bad kids my Holy Ghost cannot see him you agree all right so it's simple language the reason a born-again Christian does not have seen imputed until that soul is because that soul is born again but born-again Christian they do that does wrong Jim can be imputed through the body in the spirit that's right you be followed the thoughts that I've been trying to bring if you're born again there's no way God can see them go these inside of that give an eternal after soul then how can you sold seen you would be sailing us in that God's in no that won't work but if I was exactly right whosoever is born of God does not seen cause its seed so the seed cakes in the seat of God which is eternal life will get to where the runaround calls it you said the sea of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so you can't make that a sinner do that I'm just putting it bluntly we'll go back and we'll just go through a real slow you know going back to the point and I wrote it like this because I want you to listen sin cannot be imputed to the soul that is born again because it cannot sin because it's of God that's the see that remain athenia to see that remains in ian's get the new birth okay no but the Spirit can sin through the body and that can be imputed to us but now what we've got to learn to do that's like that's what people are failing to see we've got to learn how that sin will not be imputed to the body our spirit I think that's the key that's what I've been driving that all the services to try to get it to place cuz we gotta get something out here right knee because if this body is going to be change then that's the me as the working of the change in this body all right now there's the message see the sea cannot sin for his see who see God see it's not just my seeds not your seed you start see God's eat cakes in all right so we ought to know enough by now to know the ended by the new birth we used to thank the new birth with just some kind of anointing then you better click this they know your iPhone you sweat and another high school in sleep whatever so we'll move trying to click it a little bit you we do maybe they'll bring on the air conditioner we might hear being alone afternoon anyway so I don't want you sleep now listen to what I'm talking about run around and said my check these out with the with the many translations to see exactly what the scriptures say and brother Brown said that he liked the lungs of translation he said it was the closest of any of them and he said it was exactly right in content and everything of the King James Version now I agree that sometimes it's hard to read along sir cuz if you get so used to the King Jane do if the changes are her then it's not so in the King James said whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remain in him alright and he cannot see who the sea all right now listen to the lung the translation who's heard born of God does not commit sin because God's seed is in him and he cannot see him because he's born of God God see just get more personal but see the god you can if you send to the sea of God you'd be saying God was a sinner alright so that solves your problem so we want to be able to set back man listen no that's what I want to try to express how did the new birth legs that soul eternal and the new birth is the birth of the word if you heard you said other spirit lives I heard that you yeah you heard it somewhere right no how long do we need to go through it and the Prophet said though the seed has to come through the body hey hey right right they fill up that Ethiopian eunuch we're doing wonderful well he was reading the Bible and what he had to scroll but the seed was in the body which was felt all right me all right and so he could go there and speak to the Ethiopian eunuch and the Ethiopian eunuch went down to wear with it India or whatever the country there was and basically the whole nation receive the gospel all right so it's surely not a natural seed on some form that was in Philip because when Philip translated it over her God did to the unit remember he was a unique he had no ability to how natural see not even hurt people in this message say that if a person didn't house Ed couldn't preach well I don't get it no no no it's got in trouble cuz I always tell them say well the one I found out is a bet the worst problem is if you're wounded in your stone yeah yeah you got a problem but just get off of all that junk get down to the word all right now so the soul by the uber is old deal is the word had been made alive within us right the seed of God is made a lot to us eternal life and that seed then eternal life cannot see him me right but we're still in a realm of body and spirit were that we can do wrong now used to keep people from you know I try to go ahead and think if people do and a lot of this out on the internet system look he said what brother Dale I thought we were just a unit the body spirit soul okay we reunit body spirit soul now so then you have to be careful so you'd say well how are you going to claim it were a unit you know you and I didn't unit body spirit soul mix an individual okay now remember that the old Indian he said go ahead book first and really this is taken from the message preparation 1960 1953 1111 his only Indian he said he talked to it he asking me out how to eat how you do it he says pretty good pretty bad what do you mean pretty good it said well since i got saved so there are two dogs in me when dogs my one dogs why they just about all the time so the black dog wants me to do bad look your dog won't feel it did it good or the white dog wants me to do good which one wins cheap depends on which one fake most so we're two people right we're a split personality of a person in the basis that we are we can have eternal life the chief said after me say in the afterman save two people do dogs what you're looking at here is the black dog my actions and reactions of my body through the fact of my spirit because James to and 26 there's the body without the Spirit is to head so let's bring them rain into two bodies useless without the spirit another two parts of us is the spirit on the soul okay mono black dog thank you all right now in that mian the white dog on the inside and the soul wants me to do right the spirit working out through the body using the body to two diff things right it wants me to do wrong right and we're not necessarily talking about the dog tree etc because the Bible says that anything is not a faith its sin then we got to cover a lot of real I'm going to be really slow call my voice keep acting up so maybe it'll be enough to keep me to get the move to fight look what he says in the next one he said well that just say it saved and I just justification no let's read another one to make sure that we don't get no problems with this situation so he goes to questions and answers 1964 830 the evening service program 36 we come down pretty good pretty bad he said since may receive the Holy Ghost he said there's been two Dalton me one of them like no I'm one and what though they argue all the time so they growl in five it was another and said the right now wants me to do good and like God wants me to do bad well Tim which one of them wins the fight depending on which one chief vigilance so I think that's a good actually she depended on the warring of the body that's in you it depend on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world are the spiritual nature after the things of God all right for them to say that we're just a unit and if I sin then the unit seems you are you follow me you said well if i send it's the whole unit that seems will not worry you after that you just agreed minorly may be shaking your head something looking or whatever but you did agree that we have eternal out by the new birth and the new birth can't sin so then it would seem is a unit after becoming the Christian that's impossible right I want the Bible I won't script your own name that fart that's impossible for Christian to seeing them a soul you and I saying God's in right right do then it's good thought about the unit because it is one through ten a person that is not born again now listen if you're not born again if you don't have eternal life we used to seeing them as a unit you're so your body and your spirit as a unit used to see them right right and a soul I don't have time to preach on it I've done solo home true you ought to think about it a soul is like what you call a kind of a moral obligation and even as a sinner I used to regret the things I've done you said let's go I did not enjoy it well it's all right i'm not trying to be any goody-goody i just talked back I am I go do wrong and unjust I would unfilled early because that was the sole you took your first beer the first beer he's right you felt condemned before you drink it in then he felt condemned after you drank it but then I her while I got where did my own effort why cause you sealed your conscience off running but to begin with you didn't cause that conscious of a human being is to be good so we sin is a unit when we're lost but when we're born again the born-again person cannot see him in Seoul that's why David you know Satan was speaking in prophecy blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin we showed it to you in the Bible that God did impute sin the David ruined all by itself oh you just don't understand the great thing of the intercede you know you leave this live like the devil and did we all right we wrote a deal i'll bet you what I've got where the prophet said then I always was eternal well you don't need God Jesus Christ out in Lane this merger concern right I guess you think you just dies for me well I'm glad you think that could I think he died for me right now whatever you think about it don't matter to me it's what I think of that I think he died for me see because that puts us in that place see because I look I'm up I'm I split planning and whatever you want to call it I'm a black belt right now because that my dog it wants me to do right with that black dog wants me to do wrong right we get the point there as I said so you won't forget it it is impossible to even think about and I know I get mum nicely when I say thanks but maybe an idiotic stupid person they ever consider that God can see what you're saying now they say Jesus done wrong no don't play around with me I don't fool it if Jesus done wrong email us will be a mom right blood brothers don't your gift from it well I don't get what he done you did a slight natural you don't need a revelation you need pine common sense in God's in he can't the dama center right I suit you so now let's go into the thought so we must conclude that we do wrong with our spiritual being part of us this late to a body but the soul is pure and in his eternal by the new earth we cannot see him as we would call it as a unit because that would mean God would be sinning and that won't work but you got to divide the individual and that's what we're gonna spend the rest of the day probably wednesday night talking about it is to try to define this individual to see what we are you see that we're living here in a realm of Satan then we're motivated by that all right we have to be but yet we are Christian know who had turnover to Romans 7 but I just want to get all this on together turn around seven most of you know what that is you get rolling seven let's just read what the Apostle Paul had to say about us now of course if you want to go along with it I'll eat some of this go off with you want it a good old bag is dr. right the good old badness doctoring isn't it Oliver he got saved until he was over about the eighth chapter by lee 270 after begin to wonder the 8th chapter he got away with no condemnation good or bad his doctrine you don't believe all was it I'm Christian in Romans 1 go to remember is written thus I another written in the world all right Romans 7 verse 14 through 25 where we know that there were always spiritual but I'm carnal so over under see them Millie the policy within which I do I'll allow not for what i would that do i not but when I hate that do I to let me explain something here right around said on paragraph 2 30 of questions and answered book for in me now is two persons so that's the 10 by know okay now let me explain this all explains I mean for around explains that pole on question that's right of lytic 59 there Paul wasn't talking about going out living like the devil and you know this commitment dog trade night he was just talking about playing life everybody I'm saying oh and saying that I got troubles going on oh you're lusting after women I'm over here running back to this one I'm over you're doing this no you wouldn't man it's just normal life ok well let's read if I do that which I would not consider to the law that is good yeah it is no more higher than do it but see him that dwelleth in me know Oh are you saying you I said it's not one second he said extended birth in me for I know in me now he's explaining to me right he well he started off 17 verse seeing that dwelleth in late now explain to me where I know that in me that is in my flesh got no good thing for two-wheelers present with me but but to perform that what she's doing on wit I find out for the good that I would i do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more I'd do it but sin that dwelleth in Lynch now who's to me he just got to explain the body no I find them then a law that when I would do good he will express it with me where I delighted the law of God after the inward man I'm good remember to person so we're delighted in the log on after the implement but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind bringing me into the captivity of the loss in which is in my members black dog white dog right to person right inward part wat outward black born-again body snarling whole wretched man that I and shall deliver me from this body who shall deliver me from the body of this death' the you listen to what that man said that menu death was destroying him right he could prophesied to change etc the things but he knew he was living in a dying body that was getting older and death was taking it they didn't have to cut his head off he would have finally got right but he did you know the killer that's what he said I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord so with the man and he said that the man across the EU right make a new creature I myself sir the law of God but with the flesh the law sin now not that he had to go out i can head it he was not talking about that he was just me to claim natural you and I today are dying you can prefer all you won't do when you get home and you can pretty up all you want to but it don't change you can get face lit up some better listen all kind of this it is don't change the Sun young guru died good we're in a body of death until this body is maybe new you know my vajay through everybody death so then we've got the problem all right ma'am so Paul what are you saying all said in another scripture he says I die daily we get through the minute without time with run run said see very soon we die David that's why I'm say he's you want to get rid of it come on now by the new birth I'm staying over where you won't misunderstand me as we going on by the new birth the soul is made eternal and the seed of God Romanian the seat of God cannot see it because the seat of God is the word of God which is eternal life which is got itself living inside of us move with our body and our spirit making the body work we are healing body of death we are dying somebody's got to look at that and I might wait brother hope years ago made a real good point he said you cannot destroy death until you know what death he is right that's where I come the phrase from it you know people say with their dad it's just physical no you're not dead you're somewhere that you just left the body and going somewhere thing you're not dead yet no matter who you are Center site you don't do it do we need to find out what that is all right if we read about it to destroy the works of the devil the works of the devil is to pervert the word because that is what brought death in the garden right agree in the garden death came because of reverting the word alright so we'll never go back without the pier word run there you think you understand that I didn't say that I don't never find know everything I'll never claimed to know everybody run around and never clean nothing hungry so then we need to get down and seven bama quit being sold super religious did you see yourself right I that out of people ever since I've been in the message the church so forth so spiritually hi no no earthly good where the other sounds are working minded you know maybe that's where i'm at dunno spiritually good but you know alright but now think about it if we say we're going again and we see it as a unit then where would we be at I'm trying to get myself to come back into the right line under coach right where I'm reading from see we would be saying that God is sinning now if God is sinning we won't go to my prom with the white dog in the black dog situation shows us that it's not as a unit it is the fact of a human being that is under the curse and being under that curse as far as his body is concerned to the spirit we are still of that cursed nature but by the new birth then we are put into a different place and by the new birth God cannot impute sin to the new birth you know what oh don't sing some run people anymore you ain't spiritual at all could you just all these other day on him I don't know hi sermon in the way no I have something amusing a way to be perfect with the mediator run a couple of services talking about we need to be David but that's the end of our sales anybody physically did you know that all right now burford the sake of understanding I've tried to make this point along the way now I know this is not going to go to good people gonna say Brett around said lame in I'll be glad to give you what I said my dad said there's only one scene he said that is to disbelieve God's work huh now go get ready back if he does move out there what you won't do no I'm not trying to destroy what he said I'm trying to prove what it says right sin must be understood because according to 1st John 5 about 16 through 18 there's two different sins so let's read it yeah but more before I get to it and you draw all over the haywire not two different times it's two different phases degrees there's degrees of heaven there's degrees of gifts or degrees of all things and progress that there would be degrees of hell so sin must be understood by degrees so we're trying to establish not only what is sin but how soon can be destroyed all right so listen to what it do what jhansi first Johnny 5 14 or 16 5 you to work finally be over and then wrote down a scripture on someone but listen somebody find it for me go here to see unto death you know pray for that one but if you want to go run in and then somebody then get up here okay first John 514 yeah is that right okay you said one of God does not commit sin which I still another scripture said it you paint getting brother runs that you nervous it's annoying nervous I just missed it but turn their sin unto death you don't pray for that 17 right there is a sin not unto death not 16 if anyone's a brother sense in which is not unto death he's so ask me she'll give you a lot for them that seem harder to death there is a sin unto death I do not say that you shall pray for it listen all righteousness you see them there is a sin not on the death so now scene is not in degrees explain that to me now that there's a sin unto death but there's a sim not on the deck phases degrees parks whatever the words you want to use what you put seeing upon one level damage to disbelieve God's Word right do you got a problem if you don't understand record we're going to get down just a minute read my brother and said he seemed every day now that he disbelieve God's Word so now you can argue with not me you're gonna say I'm not destroying him I'm destroyed you and me he's right right who they must be degrees there is a sin there's two stages of the ceiling to death one stage of the sin unto death is a few black thing the Holy Ghost right right you can never be forgiven for blacks million long ago that is the sin unto death if you make light of the Holy Ghost if you do things you know and make fun of it whatever and you blaspheme the Holy Ghost you don't pray for that person right now you have to go through stages of correction in a church and you bring people before the church you give them opportunities to it again if they will not repent you go with them you take one you go yourself or somebody else then you take two people you go to the doctor I'm giving you right around the orders and then you yell in 30 days if they don't straighten up you take that person come under the bud and you do not pray for that person who only your friend right brother them off you're not getting this picture are you wanting to going to live like a devil you remember the guy in Paul leaving with his father's life in other words your stepmother he said turn six you won over to Satan further destruction of the flesh that the soul might be saved see that's the ceiling to death that you can't pray father we don't you tell me I can't pray for my children I'm not I'm just telling you if you want to do what the Bible said to get them straightened up we'll do it if you want if you want to go to correct route you try to get them straightened up we'll do it because I found out we run around them you can't turn them over to the devil right you can turn them over to God he turned them over to the devil so we're not being devil's to start with let's see you telling me I can't pray for the family if you want your family saved and they have gone to the point that they won't straighten up what do you want me to do not go to hell you think I mean I'm past drive to do funny rosette when they said I'll bring the stone then who's going to cast a much to give to me after I'm bastard I can't do that now don't care if the storm comes flying back I gotta throw some money because we got our church see that's the sin unto death all other seeing you pray for rather than the edges it you know I put my family in the hands of the Lord set up a farm I just pray father pray far cry out for but if we ever come and commit them to the Lord you don't pray for them anymore you're a predator you mean no I'm trying to save them you're the one that's mean you're trying to do is the Bible says if we keep our family in this world so they were able to sing unto death but you don't pray for all right unless it turn him over you God letting turn over the devil he said you'll see them come running if they're Christians is if they're not leaving you know whether the crease different but you see there must be degrees of sin known as I said you said we're running around and said grow brother though there's only one sin that's the nest believe God's Word ice exactly right because that is a sin unto death come on to disbelieve God's Word is a sin unto death anyone argue the point he's done solved right all right he turned around and said I see him every day with him did he disbelieve God's work or is he trying to explain the difference in degrees like I was trying to explain this morning of the by-product that the Prophet one case would be saying Jesus sexual garbage can by product not in the original then the other side she's a beautiful wife a beautiful jewel where you can type on one side of a horrible day the top on the other side the most wonderful time truly must be degrees you said when I heard this over and over well you're gonna hear one more time or even you like to get a blade cousin uh no you go to sleep put it off whatever you do but I'm not being funny on this being truthful do we understand what's it really is the Bible said anything that's not a faith is sin this is him to eat too much but show me where the Prophet said the too much don't send you to hell all right it might send you to the grave but it don't send you to hell but there is a sin that I send you to hell so there is a sin unto death in their SCM that is not unto death yeah i'm going to explain this one but i'll have to preach it later if you can see that there's a sin unto death of a see if it's not on the deck and you can see that red around can be explaining that sin is to disbelieve god's word and that would make you totally AR a blasphemer and then there is a sin that we see them every day in life and we do things that are wrong and how to appeal now if you can see those two things you'll see the white dog like no right right right and you'll see right here within us with that takes place you'll see that the sin that is unto death will not like the whole being let the scene of our lives can be forgiven and the sin that is on to death listen I love it right a sin that is unto death and never be imputed to the soul of a born-again Christian I love that but I just got too excited they want because he gets in mercian can be imputed county dragon when it's just a sin of life and that won't be unto death my causes go by the grave number an eternal separation cause death is eternal separation I hope you listen I didn't they do they go this way you got Chinese want to go cuz i got my notes but yeah I'm you see how the colors change I mean that's my notes he is now run blue and write and read all right yellow yeah domi daze I'll explain what that means but yeah well no this seeing your lives Britain breaking it down he's showing us that in their natural life that we live in this lecture hall said we follow after the desire of that spirit that's within us and we display it with the body if it was not that way we would not be able to live we would not be able to have children do you understand what I mean husband the wild desires and the things you know like that he's using on a war that sin Melissa no here South come out about years ago he he preached the great doctor she wouldn't close to how no more sex with you off this big Roderick whose evil 80 years old I'm not money going to jump that's just the truth all right the doctor is a lot of time to determine a lot of fun but now this one is our natural life the things of life okay now within that category of the things of life and living and doing things then that makes us subject listen to Lexus subject to greater things other than just living which would make us go into the form of lusty desire e 0 steely TD just a little bit Oh which is a little bit of makeup on no just a little bit of this whole look signs so I got wrote in here over and over so okay since you said but brother Dale brought it round said seeing this time believe the word disbelief God's work right now if I go out and do wrong you we go out and do wrong don't lose something you remember the man said he thought he'd live a good life and he stood before that light and said they asking said he ever who was it no my call him out but he huh he said he stood before that light and said said he told me if you realized I thought I never have told a lie he said we're all at once everything come up before me all those little bitty lies have you ever stole anything so I thought I never stole nothing he said then it come up before me all those little things that were shady deals me because God don't all about what we're doing but in your natural life we go after the things of life and that makes us subject to the world of sin then we can go off and do wrong you know you laugh you have to repent good we know it isn't beauty all right under cap we brought a random now did you disbelieve God's Word every day look away to brother pull this look number three on you notes Hebrews chapter 6 part 2 57 908 evening I right 262 now listen close as we read they said leaving the principles of doctors of Christ let's go into perfection then we got that this morning how that we are perfected perfected absolutely spotless and blameless not once in of us are you above temptation never do you see it every day yes sir but yet we are perfected because we are in him God can or judge us than nothing that couldn't be ratchet he's already judged us in him when he just Christ he judge me he judge you and he can't judge me again because he just took my judgment I've been reading honey leave the 38 I hadn't put that in as an addition later 330 adoption 1965 18 part 2 paragraph 10 for you after the adoption would only stop when sins here I mean it seems did you notice that that's the visions 17 it says the same thing and it says in Colossians 1 14 it's the same then if you want to check okay you know God note the damage center for seeing you condemn him for being a sinner if it's Sarah smokes a cigar you don't condemn in fart piece of Center anyhow you see you don't have any sins the center home he's just a sympathy you don't have any sins but you have sins you that's Christians you notice here he's talking to the church keep her strange to see forgiveness of sins we commit sins but the center is just a sinner God don't forgive him my brother Brad did you disbelieve God's Word now I don't try prop it up okay go do your prop it up and saying well yeah that's right become very he didn't have all the revelation and he he went into a place you know he'd come later to that by ason just be honest run around with its London sign thank all Christians are the only one cause his sins plural Christians the only ones that have sins okay the main thing is what we got to do try to find a way to keep over being imputed right now go back make sure you don't misunderstand me Christians from the new birth cannot sin because his seed is the thing that cannot sin so now what's he talking about the black dog the other person that we are right it's living in this room all right did he said every day yeah all right go over to number four look what he said it from contending for the faith 50 60 to 200 we're tempted all of us are kinky all of us in verse 9 without seeing it every day you see him Paul said he had to die daily and if we say we sin but and how does the end of the Bible says we make God to life so he's reversing his went right and we could not do that so we sin daily and His grace God's grace that saves us the same day to turn over the first John still got your bobblehead night first John 1 verse 7 if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another in the blood of Jesus Christ his son limited us from all sin now listen if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not English well that's your tour down everything you've been popular I don't like home you'll notice it says it we we not a unit we miss fellow right here if we say this feller that we're looking at now I'm looking at you don't do wrong we are a liar mine enough if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and Clinton's from all unrighteousness if we say these old I always was eternal I never have been a center all right now the Bible says first John 110 if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar you both are well are we safe but if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in US that's fun well you still know how to preach on greeley sorry I wish I did let's go on the illness quote for more look at number well let's get this murder if we say that cm is to disbelieve the word and put it in that category and when we do then we would condemn everybody because we would have to come back the Prophet saying he's sinned and saying Paul was talking about he sinned do you see what we're doing he's may be boring to you one of these days your nightly heart when you realize what sin is and you realize what I'm driven grow there if I believe like you believe that I just wanna live like the devil you might as well if that's what you believe because you are the devil but you is making it too much disgrace greazy Grich don't try to tell it like it is I thought the truth was gonna set it free latex gives me a license to steal with this go stale hey you see where what we're doing see they just just put it on the one lap some then when we love summit as sin is being the disability God's Word then you're putting the profit on the disbelief in God's work we're not looking like Roman 1423 we're talking about anything it's not a faith to see them what are we doing the prophet and the Bible if you understand what I'm trying to say is explaining the degrees are stages of sin how that there is a sin unto death it's you don't even break on but there's a sin that is not unto death did you dip I far so that's enough to explain it to me enough to you and I like it to witnesses so then we go to James 1 and 15 and it says that when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it's finished bring forth death right who you were to see what we're talking about I hope you see what I'm getting at on this trying to explain sin and have it when the prophet said we seen each day the end of price I'd probably say Bible says we cannot sin I certainly no problem he's explaining that with a slow by the new birth we have the allowed word are to see the woot God the alazhi I'm God in us and that seed of God cannot sin but this body and spirit is not more to him and still can do wrong and that is called sin little rest any sin but did he say just believe God's work no he said it was a human none he said in human a human does wrong oh we run around you said we can live so close to God do we wouldn't see him much wrong because we get to God the less then we're gonna have our body right that's sensible so now watch what we're getting at number five pull it up let's get this oh no i'll cover a little bit me to go easily what is the seat of God does not have a seed you only have one seed in X's word right so then if that's his word then watch what I say what it excuse me mr. technical questions and answers 1959 1223 I got 169 who's read one of God does not commit sinful to see what is the seat of God the promised Abraham had to see to what is the scene now Christ his Christ the seat of God who see is he if he isn't alright alright he's acetal going the seat of God remaineth any the holy ghost comes down to abide not from meeting the meeting but for eternity eternal now if you want to put down your scripture of this Ephesians 4 30 we're not all this fear whereby you seal until the day of your addiction the seed of God reminds him and he cannot see him because he's born of God he can't disbelieve gods were a truth born-again believer cannot disbelieve gods were that doesn't mean as you know all the gods work you can learn that but you can't disbelieve God's work so brother rounds right when he said that disbelief God's work but then you break it down to sin that there's a sin that's not disbelief in the work is this natural living or doing cuz that see it remaineth in it cannot lift the next one from the token 963 901 the morning service / 120 there it is it cannot purse now the life ladies over it it is a token legs over that little body legs over that so love that person there is a token over the heart the Holy Spirit it belongs to God as he is when I see the token I'll pass over you a positive token the Holy Spirit is our token therefore when you receive the Holy Ghost you're passed from death to life that's all there is to it because life is in you you can no more perish the vile said he this born of God does not commit sin because he cannot sin for the seat of God Amen deceit of God remains inning how can he be seeing how can he sinned when the sinless God is in him no no you wouldn't men with a statement I've been trying to make he paints in what is he's in a silver star how can he said no matter what he's done the blood covered these a new creature now he's desired an ambition is of heaven because he changed from a couple birth to a week his desire date to say they watch was and he displaces listen the skin these the scene of God is the word of God you prove that but man this born of God is other he's on the scene of God in the seat of God is the word of God and he only lives by that what if i'm going for 11 paragraph to another and different messages what is the seat of life the Word of God therefore for life you can't come through the Creed you can't true you can't come through a denomination come back to the word now the seed of life amen his word is his seed and his spirit is the water hey birth means new creation birth means creation you're a new creature all right seat of God is in him he was born of God you know no Kenny commits notes in four he takes in see you've got his enemy cannot see it as lonely that Holy Ghost is in that you take some desire enough for seeing a real seat of God is an absorbent for the spirit when all the Spirit comes into that germ of life that's laying that it produces another seat did I say it while ago you say I got to see your corn you know how to see a corner until the water starts it you only got to see it won't hold no unusual I spoken words original see all of God's Son must be the same yes serve to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again i can john c 3 c to be born of water and spirit what does it do it brings you right back again into the place where you should have been at the beginning there's the reason of Christ's death bring us right back begin to work sons of God you want to say I want to say it's the seat of God that keeps in so then with the inward man most that I serve the law of God and no sin can be imputed to the soul of a born-again believer because that so we'll never seen once it's born again right now DeLeon it's got struggle right they won't see him I'm just going to game body and spirit yes so we're going to take it up in where David said listen to the man whom God will not impute sin and that will not be talking about the soul there has to be a way for that scripture be fulfilled because you cannot disbelieve from your soul diff you're born again look see Sam wonderful it is I can't see enough to go to hell right but heaven help made it even think about trying right this together there's no way that seal enough to go to hell that's it if I'm born again could I be puttin God in hell but if I'm born again I'm not you sure Satan can kill me with it but you can't make it come to pass there has to be a way that lesson is the main living God will not impute with special person no special condition all right not a special person nato 16 special special person there was only one special person that Jesus Christ make on these things the seat of God is that word God has been made alive in your soul which is the new birth and there's no way that that sneak can see which is the part out here I still got prom but around says whoa I know people don't like this he said we will be a sticker right until we're changed well that's okay then open it now you go that way seething yo you've proven you're lost you proven you're trying to justify something you're trying to prop up something the way with God is not to prop up anything listen one dealer they were run around city we don't go to God say now if not now old Daniel who daddy knows the words you he said we don't go to say now oh daddy oh now daddy oh you know I love you Daniel you know luckiest language of today now you know daddy I love you he said you don't do that you go to him it's in an order for DME it's the first time did he comes back and saying what seeing you talking about and I ignore fighting just jump up nice no he's told me what's not but is everybody understand that there on the internet I hope you understand look whoever that's born of God cannot send you cannot impute sin to a born-again believer because you're not computed to it so which you can impute sin to a born to getting believers body and keep records you will go now to give an account of the deeds done in the body where good or bad come on Brooke bang on these signings great opportunity to be a
