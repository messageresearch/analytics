[25:33] head-on collision they said it was
[25:34] pretty
[25:35] pretty uh pretty intense so we need to
[25:38] keep him in prayer because brother Rush

[32:42] Lord
[32:43] thank you Lord for the people here
[32:46] without the brothers and sisters in this
[32:48] church it would be just four walls
[32:51] a ceiling and a floor
[32:53] there would be nothing here but Lord
[32:54] they bring you here
[32:57] in their bodies and their their soul
[33:00] lord they
[33:01] they worship you Lord
[33:03] they worship you in song and
[33:05] and putting these plays together and
[33:08] and working together and bringing food
[33:10] together and everybody pitching in and
[33:12] doing what they're supposed to do Lord I
[33:14] pray that you would continue that
[33:16] throughout the coming years until you
[33:17] come Lord and take us home and then we
[33:19] won't have to do this anymore
[33:21] we won't have to do we'll go to a
[33:23] banquet supper that's already fixed for
[33:24] us we'll go to a house that's already
[33:26] fixed for us and we'll be there for an
[33:29] eternity be able to eat and drink Lord
[33:30] and enjoy each other's company father I
[33:33] pray this should be the ones that are
[33:35] sick be the brother Dale there in the
[33:36] back Lord that you'd raise him up Lord
[33:39] and take that old cough away from him
[33:41] and all the ones Lord sister Freedom
[33:43] different ones that are not here that
[33:45] are sick Lord I pray that you should
[33:46] touch their bodies you're still the
[33:48] Healer and Lord as the Bible says as a
[33:50] word Goes Forth that you sent your word
[33:52] and healed the people and delivered it
[33:54] from destruction so I pray Lord you
[33:55] should be with us the further minutes of
[33:56] service in Jesus name we pray
[33:58] amen the Bible says in the beginning was
[34:01] the word where was with God and the Word
[34:02] was God
[34:03] and that word was made flesh and dwelt
[34:06] among us and we beheld his glory the
[34:08] glory the only begotten of the father
[34:09] full of grace
[34:11] and Truth Luke 6 verse 19 the whole
[34:14] multitude sought to touch him for there
[34:16] went virtue out of him and he healed
[34:19] them all
[34:20] and here's what I want to get to this
[34:22] afternoon
[34:23] I was
[34:24] um
[34:26] sitting yesterday and a day before
[34:28] yesterday and just kind of
[34:30] chilling out and
[34:33] I thought Lord there's got to be you
[34:35] know there's layers to this message
[34:36] there's layers to the Bible it's like
[34:38] someone says an onion pill the layers
[34:41] are there they're the same layers but
[34:43] they're real thin but you should peel
[34:45] them back and it's the same limb it's
[34:46] the same orange I mean uh onion so I
[34:49] said Lord there's got to be something
[34:51] that connects
[34:52] this to the seals so we're going to try
[34:55] with the help of the Lord because I
[34:56] believe he showed me some things uh day
[34:58] before yesterday to uh to help us put
[35:01] these into sales because we're I want to
[35:03] call us from now we're seal people
[35:07] not seals
[35:10] but seal people we we have come the
[35:12] Seven Seals are open
[35:14] brother Dale I believe has preached the
[35:16] word to us
[35:17] opened up the seals to us
[35:21] the prophet brought us the opening of it
[35:23] and I believe brother Dale even way back
[35:25] in the 80s
[35:26] he brought it like no one before and no
[35:29] one after and I'm uh you can hate me if
[35:31] you want to but listen to those
[35:33] 60-something sermons if you'll listen to
[35:36] those 60-something sermons it'll change
[35:38] your life
[35:39] brother Boyd you got your hand up me too
[35:41] it'll make you see the word in a way or
[35:44] different than than you just say well
[35:46] it's horses riding off and it's red
[35:48] colors and black colors and no there's
[35:50] something behind that
[35:52] and brother Brown said it was a book of
[35:53] redemption
[35:54] all right so let's read Revelation 6
[35:56] verse 1.
[35:57] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[35:59] the seals and I heard as it were the
[36:01] noise of Thunder one of the four beasts
[36:03] saying come and see now what Beast was
[36:05] that it was the lion l-i-o-ns everybody
[36:09] with me so keep that in the back of your
[36:10] head so we can get through into this
[36:11] into the service and I saw him Behold a
[36:14] white horse
[36:15] and he that sat on him had a bowl and a
[36:18] crown was what something was given to
[36:20] him a crown was given to him and he went
[36:23] forth what conquering and to conquer you
[36:26] may be seated in the Lord as blessing to
[36:28] the reading of the word but just to get
[36:30] to that I want to read here as we did
[36:31] this morning and allowed to see in
[36:33] church age I know there's some new ones
[36:35] here some that that have never heard
[36:37] these terminologies before and and we
[36:39] appreciate new people coming in and we
[36:42] we want to not so much go all the way
[36:45] back but if you've got the Holy Ghost
[36:47] I'll promise you if you'll open your
[36:49] heart up to God he will fill it with the
[36:52] truth he will catch you up he will he
[36:56] will not leave you behind he will bring
[36:58] you to where you need to be if you'll
[37:01] just open yourself up and say God I
[37:03] don't understand what that man's saying
[37:04] could you please either send somebody or
[37:08] tell me what to read tell me what to
[37:10] study and I promise you if you'll make
[37:12] yourself available God will give you the
[37:14] answer
[37:14] to what you need so we know that brother
[37:16] Branham came for a special reason he
[37:19] came for two reasons number one is as we
[37:22] said before as Jude said he came brother
[37:24] Brown came to take those Mysteries those
[37:26] truths that were in the first church age
[37:28] checking Third Church Age and what did
[37:31] he do he brought them what current
[37:34] to take care of all the denominational
[37:36] ideas to take care of all the man's
[37:37] ideas to take care of father son Holy
[37:40] Ghost and tell what the truth of that is
[37:42] amen the truth of marriage and divorce
[37:45] the truth of of all these different
[37:47] things the truth of water baptism the
[37:49] truth of no eternal hell what bringing
[37:51] the loose ends together so that so that
[37:53] not so that we can not that we can be
[37:55] smarter than somebody else don't ever
[37:57] try to use this message to know
[37:58] something somebody else don't know
[38:00] that's the wrong attitude to have
[38:02] the right attitude is to say Lord
[38:05] it couldn't have been me
[38:07] it could not have been me
[38:09] right I could be like that person over
[38:11] there
[38:12] but you don't want to stand up like
[38:14] those Pharisees did and said uh
[38:16] you know that guy's over there
[38:17] confessing his sins and he's got his
[38:19] hands up and he's crying out to God I
[38:21] never did those things remember what did
[38:24] Jesus say which one went home
[38:26] forgiven not this guy that guy did amen
[38:29] so the best thing for us to do is just
[38:31] get the Slate cleared out and know that
[38:33] we're in the right message of the hour
[38:34] know that we've got the truth
[38:37] and that we're listening to the truth
[38:39] not so much to say me but all of the
[38:41] whole thing the whole five-fold Ministry
[38:42] the whole every time you put on a tape
[38:44] every time you watch somebody Maybe on
[38:45] YouTube brother Donnie Reagan in
[38:47] different ones listen to them
[38:50] it's like brother Nails always said he
[38:51] said even in error
[38:54] he's found truth
[38:57] listen to that even in error he's found
[38:59] truth
[39:00] because you listen to somebody and it
[39:02] makes you study it makes you dig more it
[39:04] makes you you hear this little something
[39:06] and maybe the Bell goes off
[39:09] something ain't right about that
[39:11] well you know what it makes you do it
[39:12] makes you go find some quotes it makes
[39:15] you go find some Bible it makes you go
[39:17] pray Lord is this it or is this it
[39:20] all right so it's a constant unfolding
[39:22] of God and that's what I believe the
[39:25] message of the hour is the constant
[39:26] unfolding of God it's not just one drop
[39:28] on top of you and just you know no you
[39:31] couldn't stand that
[39:32] we have to develop as we're talking
[39:34] about now we have to develop from what
[39:36] babies to adults so so and I told you
[39:39] that Lord many a couple years ago said
[39:41] you know tell the people don't worry
[39:43] he's not going to leave anybody behind
[39:45] that wants to be
[39:47] caught up if you don't want to be caught
[39:49] up then
[39:50] God can't help you anyway
[39:53] but this messenger of Malachi 4 in
[39:55] Revelation 10 7 is to do two things one
[39:57] according to Malachi four he'll turn the
[39:59] hearts of the children
[40:00] to the fathers what the children the
[40:02] Pentecostal babies that had their
[40:04] Doctrine wrong that had their speaking
[40:07] in tongues wrong that had their gifts
[40:09] wrong that had their idea that if you
[40:11] spoke in tongues you got the Holy Ghost
[40:12] and it didn't matter how you lived
[40:14] afterwards
[40:15] that's Pentecostal babies but he was
[40:18] trying to bring them back to the faith
[40:19] of what of the mature fathers when Peter
[40:22] James and John when they were at the
[40:24] gate beautiful when Peter when Paul was
[40:26] writing the most of the
[40:28] New Testament they were mature
[40:30] Christians they weren't novices they
[40:32] weren't somebody that just come in the
[40:33] message in other words nobody with me
[40:35] okay
[40:36] so number one according to Malachi 4
[40:38] he'll turn the hearts of the children of
[40:40] the fathers and if you'll if you'll read
[40:42] a few times if you'll look up the word
[40:44] uh years of preparation brother Brown
[40:46] talks about it several times he said
[40:48] it's not in the years of preparation
[40:52] in other words his full message was not
[40:54] just the years of preparation not just
[40:56] bringing these truths back it was what
[40:59] it was then like we were saying there it
[41:01] was to open the seals to show us the
[41:03] full Plan of Redemption not part of
[41:06] redemption the full Plan of Redemption
[41:07] so everybody all right with that we'll
[41:08] just kind of easing along here just for
[41:11] a little bit maybe for a couple weeks to
[41:13] everybody can and listen I catch up
[41:16] all of us we all have a catching up time
[41:18] we like there's been many times brother
[41:20] Dallas preached sermons and two or three
[41:21] months later I'm like
[41:24] but I said God there's got to be
[41:25] something in there
[41:26] gotta be something in there that that
[41:29] may not been for me that day but give me
[41:30] something for me and then the Lord will
[41:32] put it all together for you
[41:34] if you'll make yourself available now if
[41:36] you just say well I'm just lit this I've
[41:38] heard this 25 times
[41:40] well
[41:42] One Day You're Gonna Hear It for the
[41:43] last time
[41:46] amen
[41:47] so number two so he has a two-part that
[41:50] he's going to do so so brother Brown
[41:52] says not in the years of preparation the
[41:54] healing campaigns you know I I enjoy it
[41:57] but not as much as I used to I enjoyed
[41:59] that you know they made a tape one time
[42:01] of all just a prayer line
[42:03] that's okay but that's not for growth
[42:06] that's for faith
[42:08] gotta have faith first
[42:10] but then there's going to be a growth
[42:12] what brother Brown say he said that was
[42:14] just what the bait
[42:16] on the hook
[42:17] you catch the fish with a hook you just
[42:20] throw bait out there and they're not
[42:21] gonna catch a thing but you got to put
[42:23] what hide the hook in the bait and once
[42:26] you throw it out there well what was he
[42:28] hiding these mystery truths is what was
[42:30] hiding in the message of the hour that
[42:32] people were trying to get up to and you
[42:34] know what a lot of times they'd take the
[42:36] bait
[42:37] I wouldn't get the hook
[42:41] they they dwelt on what the minor the
[42:44] prayer lines and all that that's okay
[42:47] to a degree
[42:48] but that's not going to mature you
[42:51] if brother Brown says every time you
[42:52] come up to the pulpit and get prayed for
[42:54] you get weaker that doesn't mean you get
[42:57] stronger
[42:58] anybody with me all right now well we
[43:01] you know we pray for the sick we pray
[43:03] for anybody who wants to be prayed for
[43:04] but there's got to come a time when you
[43:06] may not can get to the people that you
[43:07] need to try to get to and you have to do
[43:09] it for yourself
[43:11] and you know what if you're not used to
[43:13] it
[43:18] you ought to practice some for once in a
[43:20] while
[43:21] practice talking to God for yourself
[43:24] okay
[43:25] guy asked me this morning
[43:28] um we sell so much honey do we have to
[43:30] buy uh from a guy that lives in
[43:32] Maysville and he we met him this morning
[43:34] or I did it 15 minutes till eight
[43:37] we got to talk and I looked at my watch
[43:38] he said oh do you have to go to mass
[43:40] this morning
[43:43] sure
[43:50] I said no I said we don't believe it I
[43:52] said we believe in going to church hello
[43:54] somebody
[43:55] I mean if somebody can uh can put that a
[43:59] Catholic you know they go to church
[44:00] every day
[44:01] devout ones go to church they do maths
[44:04] all the time and we're just trying to
[44:06] write sister I mean they go they go to
[44:08] mass that's that's their thing
[44:10] that's their salvation that's their Holy
[44:12] Ghost as they get that wafer and and get
[44:14] the blessing from the from the from the
[44:16] not the pope but from the priest and I
[44:18] thought that's kind of funny well really
[44:20] because every time he we pick up from
[44:22] him we I got to go because then we're
[44:24] going to go to church so you always
[44:25] always wants to meet on Sunday so um I
[44:28] said no we're not Catholic I said I
[44:30] should have told him the original
[44:31] Catholic but I didn't have time to
[44:32] explain that either I needed to leave
[44:33] and get the church
[44:35] so I cut it off and I said nope not
[44:37] Catholic but
[44:38] we'll see you later
[44:40] all right so number two he will reveal
[44:42] the mysteries of the seven Thunders
[44:43] which is the Seven Seals now what is the
[44:46] thunder the Thunder is the voice of God
[44:48] not some mysterious boom boom boom it's
[44:51] the voice of God
[44:52] when the seal breaks to you there's
[44:54] something happens you you hear this you
[44:57] hear something you've never heard before
[44:59] amen if if the seals ever break to you
[45:02] you will hear something that you've
[45:03] never heard before and that's the
[45:05] Thunder or the voice of God speaking to
[45:07] you so in Revelations 10 brother around
[45:09] see if he was just Malachi 4 then we
[45:12] need a 10-7 to come
[45:14] because we need the maturity part we've
[45:16] already down through the church ages
[45:18] from church age one to church age seven
[45:20] they've got the Holy Ghost they just had
[45:22] a problem with some of the
[45:23] denominational ideas God winked at that
[45:26] ignorance but he in the end time he said
[45:28] no I'm going to send you a prophet
[45:30] according to Malachi 4 and that same
[45:32] Prophet according to Revelations 10
[45:34] verse 1 through 7. everybody with me on
[45:36] them
[45:37] so Revelation is 10 which are the
[45:39] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[45:41] contained in them so the Thunder when
[45:43] the thunder sounds that's the Revelation
[45:45] that's inside the seal
[45:47] it will be these divinely revealed
[45:50] not just haphazardly divinely revealed
[45:53] mystery truths that what literally
[45:55] turned the hearts of the children to the
[45:56] Pentecostal fathers to me that's the
[45:59] Capstone
[46:00] everybody with me on that the the seals
[46:03] don't get me wrong
[46:06] but you don't need the sales for this
[46:11] because Paul had this and he didn't know
[46:13] what a seal was he never heard about a
[46:15] seal
[46:16] am I with me
[46:18] Peter
[46:19] James
[46:21] John they all had this right here
[46:23] working in their life but what happened
[46:25] was is The Headstone once he went to
[46:27] heaven there in Acts 1
[46:30] . he went and took and let the head left
[46:35] and and to be real honest men became
[46:37] head in the church
[46:39] Satan became the head of the church now
[46:42] this is anointing ones at 10 times he's
[46:44] trying to be the head of the church now
[46:46] so in him being wanting to be the head
[46:48] of the church God sent the headstone
[46:51] back
[46:51] Revelations 10 1 that Mighty angel that
[46:54] came down from heaven that's Christ
[46:56] that's the son of man that's God moving
[46:59] into John come on somebody
[47:02] that's God moving into John I didn't I
[47:06] didn't think about doing this but let's
[47:07] just continue for a minute
[47:09] but Revelation is 10 1 was the mighty
[47:12] Angel who did he come down to
[47:15] he came down to John
[47:17] and John typed the bride
[47:20] he came down and he was standing on
[47:24] Earth in a man called William Bradham
[47:27] not that he was the son of man no way
[47:31] the requirement of the son of man was is
[47:35] he had to be virgin born
[47:37] brother Branham was not virgin born
[47:40] so he was not the son of man
[47:42] he identified himself as a son of man
[47:45] revealing the son of man all right so
[47:48] that's the where the mystery truths come
[47:50] in but but people you know Satan Satan
[47:53] wants to be so close
[47:55] till he'll put it in their mind oh he
[47:57] was God
[48:00] God didn't say that
[48:02] God didn't tell people brother Brown was
[48:03] God
[48:06] Satan said what brother I'm calls him
[48:08] one time a Tripper upper
[48:10] he's somebody who wants to what get your
[48:12] mind off of the real and get you about
[48:14] that far off
[48:16] all right
[48:17] brother Branham
[48:19] was the greatest man that ever walked on
[48:21] the face of this Earth outside of Jesus
[48:23] Christ but he was not Jesus Christ
[48:25] because God said and declared I will not
[48:28] share my glory with no one I am a
[48:31] jealous God
[48:32] I won't share my glory because I didn't
[48:35] create me I always was
[48:38] I created everything else
[48:40] amen so these divinely reveal what
[48:43] mystery truths are going to turn the
[48:46] hearts of the children to the
[48:47] Pentecostal father's true Pentecost not
[48:49] Pentecost 1906.
[48:53] so let's read just a few minutes on
[48:56] Truth John 17 17 says sanctify them
[48:58] through thy truth the only way we're
[49:00] going to come to real true
[49:01] sanctification I don't have my chart I
[49:04] took it off of my notes for a minute but
[49:06] you know that we came through
[49:07] sanctification where the unclean Spirit
[49:09] goes out right
[49:10] and by with me all right don't get quiet
[49:12] on me all right that unclean Spirit
[49:15] leaves that's coming out of your soul
[49:18] all right all right say now that we got
[49:21] it filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:23] just because sanctification baptism Holy
[49:25] Ghost comes in and what SEALs
[49:28] that thing can't get out I mean in
[49:31] God can't get out
[49:33] you're a sealed unit but we got to go as
[49:36] we were talking about this morning you
[49:37] got to go to that second man the spirit
[49:40] man of memory reason conscious affection
[49:42] imagination and you've got to see that
[49:46] in there it's like sister Shepherd's
[49:48] dream there was a box and when that
[49:51] water what water the word was poured
[49:54] into that box what happened Sticks came
[49:56] out trash came out brother Brown said
[49:58] after she was born again so that's what
[50:01] we're dealing with now we're not dealing
[50:04] we're not dealing with sometimes truth
[50:06] we're not dealing with sanctifying your
[50:08] soul again
[50:10] okay because I believe in once Born
[50:13] Again always born again
[50:15] am I with me I don't believe that I
[50:17] don't believe like the Baptists do once
[50:18] saved always saved and you go out and do
[50:20] the way you wanted to and you did the
[50:22] same as you did before no don't believe
[50:23] that
[50:25] there's a change in your life because
[50:27] somebody else has moved into the house
[50:30] and the devil's out but you know what he
[50:31] still wants to get back in
[50:34] he can't understand why he can't get
[50:36] back in and make you curse as I was
[50:38] talking about this morning make you do
[50:39] the things you used to do
[50:41] he has no clue you know why because he
[50:43] can't get bored again he's always been
[50:44] the way he was
[50:45] he was perfect
[50:47] but iniquity was found in his heart
[50:49] sanctify them
[50:52] through thy truth Thy word is true so
[50:54] the sanctification that we're talking
[50:55] about now is is taking these bits of
[50:58] demons virtue in all this Impressions is
[51:01] driving out those other little guys
[51:04] those little demons that bother us all
[51:06] the time that's the cartoon has you know
[51:08] got one on your shoulder one on the
[51:09] other well I got about 16 or 17 18 20 on
[51:13] this side and one on this side but this
[51:15] one listen if you're born again a
[51:16] different wins
[51:18] hey man different wins if you're born
[51:20] again if you're not then you're in
[51:22] trouble anyway
[51:23] sanctify them us through thy truth Thy
[51:26] word is truth and I believe we have
[51:29] we have you as even brother the Bible
[51:31] was talking about this morning
[51:33] you cannot believe that scripture he
[51:35] read
[51:38] about forsake the same you can just not
[51:40] believe that
[51:41] but that doesn't make it wrong
[51:43] that doesn't make it that doesn't negate
[51:45] it or do away with it no that means you
[51:48] just what you don't believe in truth
[51:53] you don't believe that you're supposed
[51:55] to do what the Bible says do so if
[51:57] you'll get it off on one you'll get off
[51:59] on another one
[52:00] all right
[52:02] listen every day of our life we don't
[52:05] live a hundred percent of the Bible
[52:08] because we're born in sin Shaker nickel
[52:10] we have a carnal mind but having the
[52:12] mind of Christ as opposed to what the
[52:14] Bible says what transform us
[52:18] into His Image that's what this statue
[52:21] of perfect man is is transforming it's
[52:23] letting that inside guy work outside
[52:27] let it out
[52:29] one way or the other
[52:31] and thou has sent me into the world even
[52:33] so now I send them into the world so
[52:34] he's sending us out in the world he's
[52:36] not going to put a hedge around us
[52:40] not like job
[52:41] he's not gonna put a hedge around us
[52:43] he's going to let Satan do all he can
[52:46] because you know what he told job
[52:49] Satan said you got a hedge around
[52:51] himself if you'll take your heads down
[52:52] and said I'll make him deny you
[52:55] and the Lord said okay the Hedge is down
[52:57] but you can't touch his life I'm the
[53:00] only one that can do that
[53:02] that's why the trials we go through in
[53:04] the tribulations we go through we think
[53:05] where is God
[53:07] he's right there
[53:09] if you're a son and daughter of God and
[53:11] you believe that you are every trial
[53:14] every test is for your good
[53:18] and your benefit and you'll see at the
[53:20] end of it you'll go
[53:22] that's exactly why I shouldn't that
[53:24] happen right
[53:27] let your what what's the song said let
[53:30] your child become a blessing right
[53:33] and it's hard listen it's hard it is
[53:35] hard on our flesh and on our spirit
[53:37] realm but that Soul inside of you loves
[53:41] to come to church loves to read the
[53:43] Bible loves to study the message of the
[53:46] hour loves to be good to people but that
[53:49] memories and conscious affects the
[53:50] imagination that's attached to that
[53:53] that's keeping that thing like this you
[53:56] know like you know when Lazarus was was
[53:58] taken out of the and giving his life
[54:00] back you know he still had to be loosed
[54:03] even though he had life
[54:06] even though he had life even though
[54:08] you've got eternal life and Satan is
[54:10] still got his hands around you but God
[54:12] said Lazarus come forth and he called
[54:15] your name and said come forth and your
[54:17] soul then what was what Resurrected
[54:20] and walk in the newness of life you
[54:22] still are bound by those grave clothes
[54:25] because Jesus even have this I had to
[54:27] say he said hey Lucy
[54:29] that's what we're talking about now
[54:30] we're trying to get the losing part
[54:32] loose us
[54:34] loose those things and let us go he was
[54:36] still bound hand in foot with grave
[54:38] clothes so he couldn't do nothing I mean
[54:39] he was totally alive but he was like
[54:42] this
[54:43] but once he got out of that thing man
[54:46] he wasn't sleeping I promise you that
[54:49] for their sake I sanctify myself that
[54:52] they also might be sanctified
[54:54] through the truth
[54:56] God of this evil age
[54:58] he talks about the Inside Man now do we
[55:00] all understand there's there's five
[55:02] senses to the outside memories and
[55:04] conscious effects imagination on the
[55:06] inside five C tastes Phil smell in here
[55:08] that's just to contact this world it
[55:10] can't they can be fooled every one of
[55:12] them can be fooled
[55:13] remember raising conscious affection
[55:15] imagination that's where God is and
[55:16] that's where Satan plays
[55:18] but if your soul is born again today it
[55:20] is God
[55:21] it is no more God it is no less God but
[55:24] he wants to be more God in your spirit
[55:26] Realm
[55:27] he wants to be more
[55:31] then sometimes we even want him to be so
[55:33] I'm not going to read this again because
[55:34] it's the very bottom man is what free
[55:36] moral agency free will we were talking
[55:38] about this morning that inside God
[55:40] because that spirit is of a worldly
[55:42] nature as we were speaking of this
[55:44] morning because it was not given from
[55:46] God but it was permitted by God all
[55:48] right
[55:49] now you got to understand that you say
[55:51] well where'd it come from it did come
[55:52] from God but it wasn't
[55:54] eternal
[55:56] it was perfect
[55:58] your soul
[56:00] the Breath of God breathe into your kid
[56:04] when you're a baby and you became a
[56:06] living soul but you didn't become a
[56:07] newborn creature in Christ
[56:08] you were still born in sin still safer
[56:10] than iniquity still a spouse with your
[56:12] mother's womb a liar doomed it on your
[56:15] hat way the house so look
[56:18] so that person inside is a center to
[56:20] begin with
[56:22] so the five inlets is what we memories
[56:24] and conscious that's what we're going to
[56:25] talk about
[56:27] from now on
[56:28] when he talks about your body and as
[56:30] I've always said and some people look at
[56:32] you all cross-eyed they say my flesh
[56:34] made me do this no your flesh did not
[56:36] make you do that
[56:37] your flesh never made you do anything
[56:39] that your spirit inside of you didn't
[56:41] want it to do
[56:42] I cannot move my hand without thinking
[56:44] that my hand's going to move
[56:46] everybody with me all right so you're
[56:49] motivated by what your flesh no you're
[56:51] motivated by the spirit that's inside of
[56:53] you all right so there's no faculty or
[56:56] mental faculty even in your brain
[56:58] the Bible says you as a man thinketh in
[57:00] his heart
[57:01] not as a man thinketh in his brain now
[57:03] you got to process it through there like
[57:05] this computer you got to process the
[57:07] information through there right but
[57:09] remember
[57:11] the old saying garbage in
[57:13] garbage out
[57:15] good in good out all right garbage in
[57:17] garbage out good in good out this guy is
[57:20] just along for the ride
[57:22] but it's cursed and it's dying it's
[57:24] getting gray headed I was looking I want
[57:26] brother Joe and some of them to to do
[57:28] this and I know y'all probably don't
[57:29] want it done but
[57:32] I think I'll keep it a secret never mind
[57:35] boy it doesn't ain't that good
[57:38] so now from now till the end of the
[57:40] service you're not going to think about
[57:41] nothing but what I'm going to do
[57:43] amen no I was looking I was looking back
[57:46] to 2013. have you ever looked back in
[57:49] our on our website we've got the
[57:51] Valentine's banquet coming up and and uh

[58:12] keeps
[58:13] getting worse and worse now to the last
[58:15] man which is a soul there's only one
[58:18] sense I was looking at

[58:53] another one coming up
[58:55] so give us a break somebody else if you
[58:57] don't mind
[58:59] but you look at all the all the time
[59:01] effort and money
[59:03] and and message Believers though we live
[59:05] under a whole different a whole
[59:07] different
[59:07] um
[59:08] um
[59:09] attitude
[59:12] but the world
[59:14] 50 percent
[59:17] of people
[59:18] within five years are divorced
[59:24] five out of ten so when they walk up
[59:27] there to the aisle and they're not
[59:29] they're just people of the world
[59:30] anything can take them apart
[59:33] but brother Brown says what God joined
[59:35] together you take two Holy Ghost Field
[59:37] people they'll learn to love each other

[59:41] thick and thin now it's just nothing

[1:00:16] write if you don't so it kind of
[1:00:17] squeezes but you see that's what the
[1:00:19] world's
[1:00:21] that's what the world
[1:00:23] I saw it online I read it I read it
[1:00:25] online
[1:00:27] um but no that's what the world lives
[1:00:29] under and you spent 25 and 30 000 for
[1:00:32] weddings now
[1:00:33] can you imagine five years later
[1:00:36] they're gone
[1:00:38] from each other
[1:00:39] what in the world
[1:00:41] but see I don't Lillian's like there's
[1:00:44] nothing in their mind that I know
[1:00:45] nothing in our minds that says well
[1:00:47] about five years from now we ain't gonna
[1:00:49] see one of them no
[1:00:51] no it's real
[1:00:54] nice

[1:01:01] Lily's already hit him look at his hand
[1:01:05] he said he done something with it some
[1:01:08] Bachelor the bachelor party but anyway
[1:01:10] we won't talk about that either
[1:01:12] but I believe it was more like
[1:01:17] frying pan yeah frying pan
[1:01:21] and that's all right just don't come in
[1:01:23] next next week with another one like
[1:01:25] that one
[1:01:26] you'll learn shut up and stand up it's
[1:01:28] two different words
[1:01:30] but you see we we can even our
[1:01:33] sweethearts banquet and we can we can
[1:01:37] we can negotiate life
[1:01:39] if you'll just let God in your life
[1:01:42] if he'll let if you'll let God in your
[1:01:44] life they'll sometimes you do think that
[1:01:46] hey this is it I'm I'm done
[1:01:48] but then God will bring one preacher
[1:01:52] or he'll bring one sister or call you or
[1:01:54] one brother will call you say hey
[1:01:56] I hear you having trouble
[1:01:58] I want to pray for you
[1:01:59] man talk about Obama in Gilead
[1:02:02] talk about something that'll smooth
[1:02:03] something over
[1:02:05] talk about what a surety and that faith
[1:02:08] that we have that two people can come
[1:02:10] together and we can live together in
[1:02:12] harmony and we can live together as Mom
[1:02:14] and Dad has for 64 years
[1:02:17] five years amen
[1:02:20] a lot longer a lot of those been born
[1:02:22] that's for sure alive right
[1:02:24] and I know and listen
[1:02:27] when you say this in a congregation and
[1:02:29] I don't want to make anybody mad or
[1:02:30] think about old things but we just have
[1:02:32] life a lot of times we make bad
[1:02:33] decisions
[1:02:36] right Donnie you know I mean you make
[1:02:39] bad decisions but you've come to the
[1:02:40] truth
[1:02:42] that you've come to the truth let's go
[1:02:43] forward from that don't worry about what
[1:02:45] happened in the past let's go forward
[1:02:46] from that
[1:02:48] so I believe brother Branham gave us a
[1:02:50] provision when he gave us marriage and
[1:02:52] divorce he said go on as you are in
[1:02:53] other words don't go back
[1:02:59] do that again
[1:03:01] our problem is is a lot of people do
[1:03:03] that again well see that you took
[1:03:05] yourself right out from under grace boy
[1:03:06] ain't going to preach on marriage and
[1:03:07] divorce y'all stay right where you're at
[1:03:09] we'll be fine
[1:03:12] what were we talking about
[1:03:14] oh having a wedding but really think
[1:03:17] about it
[1:03:18] if you'll sit down sometime and just
[1:03:20] write down the pros and cons of being in
[1:03:23] the message
[1:03:25] of what we don't have to deal with that
[1:03:26] the world deals with every day
[1:03:29] you better consider yourself a blessed
[1:03:31] group of people
[1:03:33] I mean a blessed group of people
[1:03:36] and I know we have anxiety I know we
[1:03:38] have fear I know we have stress I know
[1:03:40] we have Strife I know we have Wayward
[1:03:41] kids and we have problems at work and we
[1:03:43] have problems here and problems there
[1:03:44] but listen we know how to handle them if
[1:03:47] you'll just go by the Bible
[1:03:49] and that Holy Ghost inside of you will
[1:03:51] lead you and guide you into all truth
[1:03:53] and that means how to handle your boss
[1:03:55] how to handle the girl in the
[1:03:57] drive-through that hates your guts she
[1:03:59] don't even know you
[1:04:00] I say a girl some guys too
[1:04:03] but I just appreciate God giving me an
[1:04:06] opportunity to at least try to get
[1:04:08] inside that building
[1:04:09] called the message of the hour which is
[1:04:11] tied in completely with the word of God
[1:04:13] it is the word of God Amen so let's get
[1:04:17] this right here we're done seeing all
[1:04:18] this remember obeying the truth that's
[1:04:21] why I love what brother Bob was bringing
[1:04:23] out this morning we got to obey the
[1:04:25] truth if you obey the truth then you get
[1:04:28] the promises and you get the power
[1:04:31] behind the truth
[1:04:33] thereby with me on that you get the
[1:04:35] power behind the truth but listen God
[1:04:38] does not have to honor non-truth
[1:04:41] he actually hates it
[1:04:44] we're going to read it maybe if we'll
[1:04:45] get down to it Nico
[1:04:49] Nicole Anthony spirit
[1:04:51] conquering of that word yeah we're going
[1:04:53] to get to if we get down to it where
[1:04:55] that says to conquer and to conquer it
[1:04:57] said Nico is the is to conquer
[1:05:00] brother Brown says conquer the laity
[1:05:02] that's what Satan's done he's conquered
[1:05:03] the laity
[1:05:05] and then he's got the preachers too all
[1:05:07] right but it was obeying what God Said
[1:05:10] to do it's what brought the power what
[1:05:13] brought the virtue is obedience to the
[1:05:16] word of God
[1:05:17] and for those of you Lillian's active
[1:05:19] married been married if you put God
[1:05:22] first
[1:05:23] the center of your life the center of
[1:05:25] everything you do
[1:05:27] put God first I'll promise you your life
[1:05:30] will be a lot easier than a life lived
[1:05:32] out in the world
[1:05:33] amen
[1:05:35] listen
[1:05:36] we are not a set apart group of people
[1:05:39] that we set apart
[1:05:41] we're a set of part group of people that
[1:05:43] God set apart
[1:05:45] the whole world listen
[1:05:51] want it now because Satan is what he's
[1:05:54] the king of this world he's the God of
[1:05:56] this evil age he wants this place to be
[1:05:59] destroyed
[1:06:00] he wants you to be destroyed
[1:06:05] you know the
[1:06:07] quote misery loves company
[1:06:09] it really does
[1:06:12] there are some people I've met
[1:06:14] that if they weren't miserable
[1:06:17] they'd be miserable
[1:06:21] how'd that sound
[1:06:22] but have you ever met somebody like that
[1:06:24] if God healed them
[1:06:25] under my head they'd be like why
[1:06:30] why because that's the program
[1:06:33] that's the program the world gives you a
[1:06:35] program to always be this and always be
[1:06:37] that
[1:06:38] negativism
[1:06:40] brother Brown says we're not building an
[1:06:42] organization it's what we got to this
[1:06:43] morning he's not building an
[1:06:45] organization look when he sent me to
[1:06:47] build individuals
[1:06:49] to the statue of Jesus Christ that they
[1:06:52] might be the what the PowerHouse and
[1:06:54] Dwelling Place of the Spirit by his word
[1:06:57] by his word built up the individual to
[1:07:00] that place not build an organization
[1:07:03] listen there's people out there in
[1:07:04] organizations that are absolute
[1:07:06] super good people
[1:07:09] that that like Dr Bennett that Mom and
[1:07:12] him goes to we've all been all of our
[1:07:14] life almost you go there too boys
[1:07:16] you know some yeah okay well Dr Bennett
[1:07:19] is just if he was if he was a believer
[1:07:23] I'm talking about a message believer
[1:07:25] with all that whatever with all the
[1:07:27] truth
[1:07:27] he'd be standing right here
[1:07:30] he's just a good Christian
[1:07:33] as good as he can stand
[1:07:35] a Christian
[1:07:37] but God's not building an organization
[1:07:38] he's putting all his he's putting all of
[1:07:40] his his strength on an organization a
[1:07:43] Baptist to take him across or a
[1:07:45] Methodist to take him across
[1:07:47] we're not we're dependent on God to take
[1:07:49] us across amen but build the individual
[1:07:53] to Sons and Daughters of God that's the
[1:07:54] idea add to your faith first reverse
[1:07:57] your knowledge
[1:07:58] well now you're coming to a place now
[1:08:00] we're going to talk about virtue just
[1:08:01] for a minute and then we'll get down to
[1:08:02] what we were talking about a few minutes
[1:08:03] ago
[1:08:04] the whole multitude sought to touch him
[1:08:06] for that went virtue out of him now that
[1:08:08] there's not science has proven that that
[1:08:12] there's something with contact
[1:08:15] remember my brother Abram and brother
[1:08:16] Brown's when they had limited X-ray and
[1:08:18] different things that they proved that
[1:08:20] male or whoever it was proved that if
[1:08:21] you reach and touch something there's a
[1:08:23] charge
[1:08:24] goes between you and that person so it's
[1:08:26] contact that's why brother Branham would
[1:08:28] sometimes he would take the sisters by
[1:08:31] the shoulder or take them by the hand
[1:08:32] right and sometimes he wouldn't
[1:08:34] sometimes he just point his finger at
[1:08:36] him so it really is not to the to the
[1:08:39] fleshly contact he contacted their
[1:08:41] spirit and when he contacted their
[1:08:43] Spirit the holy spirit that was there
[1:08:45] did whatever healed them saved them
[1:08:47] whatever it was
[1:08:49] but there had to be God there for that
[1:08:51] to go out of
[1:08:54] like I said before if you're having
[1:08:56] trouble in your marriage
[1:08:57] don't go see somebody's been divorced
[1:08:59] seven times
[1:09:05] that's like I told you I think before
[1:09:08] Hannah Hannah's you know working at the
[1:09:10] battery plant she's making good money
[1:09:13] and uh she's trying to get her debt
[1:09:15] straightened out she's had some had some
[1:09:17] debt problems I know we
[1:09:19] she's not the only one
[1:09:22] but
[1:09:24] she started we I took her to the bank
[1:09:26] and we started talking to the banker and
[1:09:28] she started saying some things and I'm
[1:09:30] like
[1:09:32] where'd that come from
[1:09:34] like can you know how to consolidate you
[1:09:36] alone well just make the minimum payment
[1:09:38] I said no who told you that
[1:09:42] her credit score was like 550.
[1:09:44] I said who'd you hear that from
[1:09:46] somebody's credit score was 550.
[1:09:49] no I said you need to talk to somebody's
[1:09:51] credit score is 800.
[1:09:53] right that's why you are with the word
[1:09:55] of God and the things of Life why do we
[1:09:57] need to go somewhere else when we got
[1:09:59] the answer here
[1:10:00] we've got the answer in the word of God
[1:10:02] we've got a credit score of 800. why you
[1:10:05] want to listen to somebody else
[1:10:07] take that as a life lesson my brother
[1:10:11] but risk I mean that's but that's the
[1:10:13] mentality of the world they'll migrate
[1:10:15] to that every time
[1:10:17] birds of a feather
[1:10:19] you know all the 550 credit scores
[1:10:20] getting together and say well this is
[1:10:22] the way to do it well what's your score
[1:10:24] of 550 what's your 550 this is a way to
[1:10:26] do it
[1:10:27] not
[1:10:33] anyway
[1:10:35] that's why I said that's why brother
[1:10:37] Brown said a novice did not write the
[1:10:39] Bible
[1:10:40] novices God did not use novices to write
[1:10:43] the Bible he used mature people to write
[1:10:46] the Bible why would you go to a novice
[1:10:48] that's never had any experience with God
[1:10:50] or never had any like said about a
[1:10:52] marriage counselor you go to marriage
[1:10:53] counselor and he's got all these degrees
[1:10:54] and then he then you ask him about his
[1:10:57] wife and he said well number four she's
[1:10:59] doing okay
[1:11:01] I'd go out the door
[1:11:04] amen
[1:11:07] that's why we enjoy
[1:11:08] having the truth
[1:11:10] we enjoyed dealing with somebody that's
[1:11:13] at least tried their life to live their
[1:11:14] life good we've all had mistakes but
[1:11:17] still
[1:11:18] we tried to make sure that the ship
[1:11:20] stayed upright and we can depend on each
[1:11:22] other not give totally false information
[1:11:25] wherever that came from you it's free
[1:11:28] well if you create it's not bad it's
[1:11:31] free
[1:11:32] you'll get that in a minute and a woman
[1:11:34] having an issue about 12 years spent all
[1:11:37] of her life her earnings upon Physicians
[1:11:40] neither could be healed of any of them
[1:11:44] came behind him and touched the border
[1:11:46] of His Garment immediately her issue of
[1:11:47] blood stance and Jesus said who touched
[1:11:50] me because what happened was he didn't
[1:11:52] feel the material move
[1:11:55] because his robe was moving the whole
[1:11:57] time it was moving bumping up against
[1:11:59] people because Peter says well look
[1:12:01] Peter said of course oh Peter jumped up
[1:12:02] he said why are you talking about Lord
[1:12:04] everybody's touching you
[1:12:07] he said Peter in other words you don't
[1:12:09] understand what I'm telling you
[1:12:11] right here he says Peter
[1:12:13] somebody touched me because of virtue
[1:12:16] or strength that he had built up inside
[1:12:19] of him a part of that had left him
[1:12:22] and had went and what healed that lady
[1:12:25] with a blood issue and when the woman
[1:12:27] saw that she was not hid she came
[1:12:30] trembling and falling down before him
[1:12:31] she declared unto him before all the
[1:12:34] people for what cause she had touched
[1:12:35] him and how she was healed immediately
[1:12:37] she wasn't she wasn't afraid to testify
[1:12:41] and he said unto her daughter be of good
[1:12:43] Comfort thy faith has made thee whole
[1:12:46] go in peace now that word verse you
[1:12:48] right there
[1:12:49] means the same thing as the Holy Ghost
[1:12:53] because it's dunamis it's power
[1:12:56] Mighty work strength strength power
[1:12:58] ability inherent power so that in other
[1:13:00] words brother Brown said though we'll
[1:13:01] read it here in just a few minutes where
[1:13:02] brother Brown said you got to have it to
[1:13:04] give it out
[1:13:06] and you can't go buy it you gotta have
[1:13:08] it inside of you so you can give it out
[1:13:10] that's what Jesus said he didn't have to
[1:13:11] go get it and I love Peter in that in
[1:13:14] that situation where Peter and I believe
[1:13:16] was Peter and John that was in the gate
[1:13:17] beautiful they didn't have to go call
[1:13:19] the
[1:13:20] State presbyter they didn't have to go
[1:13:22] call the other disciples Peters Peter
[1:13:25] Peterson look on us
[1:13:27] look right here I want you to focus on
[1:13:30] this I don't want you to focus don't
[1:13:31] focus on my ugly face I want you to
[1:13:33] focus on me
[1:13:34] focus on what I'm fixing to tell you
[1:13:37] that I have
[1:13:39] silver and gold I can't buy you a ticket
[1:13:42] to the physician
[1:13:44] but such as I do have
[1:13:47] I'm fixing to display it
[1:13:50] and I believe the man in his heart said
[1:13:53] I want what they want
[1:13:55] and he got what he wanted
[1:13:57] and brother Brian says look here's what
[1:13:59] we do what's the first thing how faith
[1:14:00] and be born again we've talked about
[1:14:01] that several several months ago but
[1:14:04] after we lay the foundation secondly you
[1:14:07] add to your faith first you have faith
[1:14:10] then you add virtue to your faith that
[1:14:14] is the next column first pour your
[1:14:15] foundation then
[1:14:18] to your faith at virtue
[1:14:22] now right there knocks a lot of us down
[1:14:24] wow
[1:14:25] boy that's only the first virtue and
[1:14:28] brother Brown said that knocks a lot of
[1:14:29] us down right there knocks a lot of us
[1:14:32] down yes sir and virtue advert you to
[1:14:34] your faith that doesn't just mean living
[1:14:37] a virgin life
[1:14:39] everybody with me let's wake up it's
[1:14:41] getting a little hot in here and I know
[1:14:43] it's
[1:14:44] hard to stay awake but just try to try
[1:14:46] to stay awake a little while longer that
[1:14:48] doesn't just mean living a virgin life
[1:14:50] you know like a woman or a man and so
[1:14:52] forth that look that doesn't have
[1:14:54] nothing to do with that
[1:14:56] it didn't matter to that woman that
[1:14:58] Jesus was a virgin
[1:15:01] it didn't matter to the man that gave
[1:15:02] beautiful what Peter's background was
[1:15:05] he was focused on what that meant he had
[1:15:08] what he'd either heard or seen though
[1:15:10] that they had something different than
[1:15:12] the rest of the they probably that man
[1:15:14] went to the Pharisees Sadducees he went
[1:15:16] to the herodians he went to the
[1:15:18] Physicians he went like the woman 12
[1:15:19] years looking for a doctor
[1:15:22] and that man when he was sitting at that
[1:15:24] gate he looked up
[1:15:27] and he said I want what you got
[1:15:29] I'm gonna try you I've tried everything
[1:15:31] else you know what the woman said she's
[1:15:33] I've tried everything else
[1:15:34] but I'm just want to touch his garment
[1:15:37] brother Brown said being a virgin has
[1:15:38] nothing to do with it
[1:15:40] well I'm gonna skip to this a little bit
[1:15:41] further virtue before you can let it out
[1:15:43] you got to have it first you haven't got
[1:15:46] it it won't come out there's nothing for
[1:15:48] it to come out of
[1:15:50] what if someone tried to draw virtue out
[1:15:53] of us and the check would return
[1:15:55] insufficient funds see no no none of
[1:15:58] their none there to draw from check
[1:16:01] bounce somebody looking at you as a
[1:16:03] Christian and tomorrow see you out
[1:16:05] carrying on like a sinner
[1:16:07] now there's no other virtue in that
[1:16:09] much for
[1:16:12] first see
[1:16:13] but you must be
[1:16:18] inherent power from Heaven the Holy
[1:16:20] Ghost you have Holy Ghost virtue inside
[1:16:23] of you you just got to be able to use it
[1:16:25] all right
[1:16:27] then when you get true virtue you can
[1:16:29] add it to your faith
[1:16:31] that's the next foundation wall now
[1:16:33] first you must have faith faith alone
[1:16:35] won't do it
[1:16:36] all right faith alone will not do it
[1:16:39] Peter said then add virtue to your faith
[1:16:42] you must have virtue in order to add it
[1:16:44] to your faith and then it might be the
[1:16:47] reason you don't have it it's because
[1:16:48] many churches of today teach you don't
[1:16:51] have to have it I say something in the
[1:16:53] message teacher don't have to they don't
[1:16:54] even worry about the Statue of perfect
[1:16:56] man
[1:16:56] come on somebody
[1:16:58] some of you preachers I know so maybe
[1:17:00] this that's been around that hardly
[1:17:02] anybody preaches on the Statue of
[1:17:03] perfect man I said hardly there are some
[1:17:05] but it's not prevalent it's not trying
[1:17:07] they're just trying to get the people uh
[1:17:09] anyway in prayer line Maybe
[1:17:13] they teach you you don't have to have it
[1:17:14] of the days of it has passed they don't
[1:17:17] have to have it the only thing you have
[1:17:18] to do is just join Church yeah days has
[1:17:20] passed virtue anyone knows what the word
[1:17:23] virtue means see we must have it at
[1:17:25] first you went from him to heal the
[1:17:27] woman that was sick he's expecting the
[1:17:29] same virtue in his church
[1:17:32] let me read that one more time if first
[1:17:34] you went from him to heal the woman that
[1:17:37] was sick he's expecting the same virtue
[1:17:39] in his church
[1:17:41] because he's our example and if he had
[1:17:43] virtue to give to the people he expects
[1:17:46] us
[1:17:49] expects us to have virtue to give to the
[1:17:52] people and what is virtue virtue is
[1:17:55] strength and power
[1:17:57] we're going to get into that in just a
[1:17:59] minute because remember
[1:18:00] all those seals we see that power was
[1:18:03] given
[1:18:03] there was a power permitted
[1:18:06] but there is an inherent power
[1:18:08] of God
[1:18:10] that caused those seals to open
[1:18:13] it caused the white horse rider to write
[1:18:15] off
[1:18:16] because he was comfortable where he was
[1:18:18] at down through the church ages
[1:18:20] because of false Doctrine because of
[1:18:22] false teaching and different things
[1:18:24] but when brother Branham comes up and he
[1:18:26] stands there and that seal breaks and he
[1:18:28] said here stands a lamb with a book in
[1:18:30] his hand and there goes the white horse
[1:18:31] rider Satan had to leave Satan had to
[1:18:34] get away from him
[1:18:35] but what do you do though he took a
[1:18:37] power with him
[1:18:38] he took a virtue with him
[1:18:42] listen
[1:18:43] catch a perfect man brother Brown says
[1:18:45] look Peter said add virtue now Peter's
[1:18:46] talking about building the house of God
[1:18:48] the temple of God fixing to a play fix
[1:18:51] it to a place and after you have virtue
[1:18:54] you must have after you have faith he
[1:18:55] said you must have virtue with it having
[1:18:58] virtue for the whole
[1:19:01] world
[1:19:04] that'll make you silent
[1:19:07] virtue for the whole world I preached a
[1:19:10] sermon about 20 years ago on Reverend Mr
[1:19:12] Lilly Lilly the pastor took it from the
[1:19:15] text where Jesus said consider the Lily
[1:19:16] how they need the toil or spin you know
[1:19:19] I say to you Solomon and all of his
[1:19:20] glory is not a raid like one like this
[1:19:22] one look at the Lily it comes from way
[1:19:25] down in the muck every minute of the day
[1:19:27] it has to be drawing from the earth and
[1:19:29] what does it do with this virtue that it
[1:19:31] draws it gives it out
[1:19:34] listen you can't today sit here and say
[1:19:37] I have virtue and keep it all to
[1:19:38] yourself
[1:19:39] virtue has to be
[1:19:42] forwarded to someone else
[1:19:46] that's why Paul had to go see a nice
[1:19:51] come on somebody
[1:19:53] to get that dunamis or That Power from
[1:19:56] ananas to Paul
[1:19:58] because after
[1:19:59] and I prayed for Paul
[1:20:03] scales fell off his eyes
[1:20:05] he'll received the Holy Ghost
[1:20:07] because the life comes through the body
[1:20:09] every minute of the day it has to be
[1:20:11] drawn from the earth and what does it do
[1:20:12] with this virtue that it draws
[1:20:15] it makes a beautiful sight for the
[1:20:17] admirer it opens up itself for honey for
[1:20:20] the bee to come and get his part don't
[1:20:22] complain
[1:20:23] it's just got it to give out what if the
[1:20:26] bee come in there insufficient funds no
[1:20:28] honey
[1:20:29] that little bee would scratch his head
[1:20:31] and say what kind of Lily is that what
[1:20:33] kind of Christian is that
[1:20:35] don't have no strength to give nothing
[1:20:37] out to people just a weak question well
[1:20:40] if you're a weak Christian that means
[1:20:42] you've not done you've not paid your
[1:20:44] tithe come to church read your Bible
[1:20:46] study
[1:20:48] right that that's the only thing we can
[1:20:50] that's the only standard we can put it
[1:20:52] up against is the word of God
[1:20:53] can't put it up on what this one said in
[1:20:55] that one said but if we put it up on
[1:20:56] what the word of God says and we decide
[1:20:59] that's what we're going to listen to
[1:21:00] come on now
[1:21:02] don't get quiet
[1:21:05] don't start snoring either I said then
[1:21:07] the first thing you know there's
[1:21:09] somebody loves to smell the odor he
[1:21:11] ain't selfish
[1:21:14] a pastor brother Dale different ones
[1:21:17] they give their life they're not selfish
[1:21:20] selfish people can't be pastors
[1:21:23] I I mean me
[1:21:26] no you can't be selfish
[1:21:28] he's got older before he can give out
[1:21:30] odor he has to have it before he can
[1:21:33] give out Beauty he has to have it before
[1:21:35] he can give out virtue you have to have
[1:21:37] it
[1:21:38] so add to your faith virtue amen
[1:21:40] understand
[1:21:42] all right look I and I put this in here
[1:21:44] this is what brother Brown said
[1:21:46] she touched not the physical
[1:21:49] person of Jesus in other words I'm
[1:21:51] paraphrasing here but she pulled out
[1:21:53] what she needed
[1:21:55] she needed to be healed of a blood issue
[1:21:58] that was her that was her whole problem
[1:22:00] in life
[1:22:01] and so what did she do she touched him
[1:22:04] spiritually she did physically touch His
[1:22:07] Garment but that didn't heal her the
[1:22:10] Garment part these these don't heal us
[1:22:13] but the what the power or virtue behind
[1:22:16] it is what does the healing you can take
[1:22:19] cloths off of anybody and just hand them
[1:22:21] out
[1:22:22] but are they going to do any good no
[1:22:24] this has power behind it
[1:22:26] not nothing to do with this though
[1:22:28] nothing to do with this it's what's
[1:22:31] inside it's what what it's the approach
[1:22:34] right
[1:22:37] now Jesus we were talking about the
[1:22:38] Centurion this is where the power to me
[1:22:40] this to me this scenario shows one thing
[1:22:43] for sure that Centurion was not a
[1:22:46] Christian
[1:22:47] he wasn't even a Jew
[1:22:49] so he didn't go to the synagogue he
[1:22:52] didn't believe in Moses Doctrine
[1:22:55] that he was just a ranked sinner he was
[1:22:57] just a a heathen
[1:22:59] a Roman a dog that the Jews would
[1:23:02] consider but the Centurion had to have
[1:23:05] some sense about him that he watched
[1:23:07] Jesus and every time Jesus walked by
[1:23:09] things happen
[1:23:11] walk by and reach and grab somebody and
[1:23:13] they stand up boom Lazarus come forth
[1:23:16] boom they see all these people that are
[1:23:18] blind he may have been around that day
[1:23:20] when when uh blind Bartimaeus received
[1:23:23] his sight you don't know he had to be
[1:23:24] somewhere because he answered and said
[1:23:26] Lord I'm not worthy that thou should
[1:23:28] come under my roof but speak the word
[1:23:30] only
[1:23:31] speak the word only
[1:23:34] look and he never said maybe my servant
[1:23:38] will be healed he said and my servant
[1:23:40] shall be healed for I am a man of
[1:23:44] authority having soldiers under me I say
[1:23:48] to this man go you know what he was
[1:23:50] saying he said Lord I know what you do
[1:23:52] you say to that devil go on it goes
[1:23:55] comedy cometh to my servant do this and
[1:23:58] he doeth it when Jesus heard it he said
[1:24:00] I have not found so great faith no not
[1:24:02] in Israel
[1:24:04] and I'm saying to you that many shall
[1:24:05] come from the East and West and sit down
[1:24:07] with Abraham Isaac Jacob in the kingdom
[1:24:09] of God
[1:24:09] the children of the Kingdom shall be
[1:24:11] cast out in outer Darkness they'll be
[1:24:13] weeping and gnashing of teeth and Jesus
[1:24:14] said unto the Centurion go thy way as
[1:24:17] thou Hast believed
[1:24:19] so be it done unto thee and his servant
[1:24:22] was healed in the self-same hour the
[1:24:25] Centurion didn't have any virtue but he
[1:24:28] knew where to go get it at
[1:24:31] he knew where to go how many times have
[1:24:33] you in your life being a Christian have
[1:24:36] just some random somebody or you say hey
[1:24:39] buddy can I pray for you
[1:24:42] or or somebody come up to you and say
[1:24:44] something to you and it's kind of like
[1:24:46] how'd you know that well you're
[1:24:48] different
[1:24:49] I've been watching you across the room
[1:24:50] you're different
[1:24:52] I've got a problem
[1:24:54] what is it it's a draw
[1:24:56] they need virtue and we've got it
[1:25:00] now listen to this real quick and I'll
[1:25:01] get to the seal part in just a minute I
[1:25:04] can imagine them Apostles never acted
[1:25:06] like us
[1:25:09] this is a prophet
[1:25:10] they went around probably men of few
[1:25:12] words
[1:25:14] till they got in the pulpit
[1:25:16] they walked in they'd done what they
[1:25:18] were supposed to do and walked out
[1:25:23] hmm
[1:25:24] yes sir they had power
[1:25:26] they had virtue they had no arguments
[1:25:29] with men they knew where they stood
[1:25:33] that's all they know who they believed
[1:25:36] they kept on walking in the spirit just
[1:25:39] as I said the other night one little nod
[1:25:41] that's all God had to do then nothing's
[1:25:44] going to stop them they didn't question
[1:25:45] and study and hum Hall and worry like we
[1:25:48] do whether they should do this or not
[1:25:50] this is like this is Brother Branham
[1:25:52] saying that we do that he's talking
[1:25:54] about himself
[1:25:55] just one little nod from God that done
[1:25:58] it just as soon why how could they know
[1:26:00] it was a nod from God they had all these
[1:26:03] virtues in here all these qualifications
[1:26:06] so they knew by what their
[1:26:09] virtues that God was saying go ahead
[1:26:13] and the first little knot of God
[1:26:15] compared with every bit of this and with
[1:26:17] his word they knowed it was the word of
[1:26:18] God and the way they went didn't have to
[1:26:21] worry about nothing else when God spoke
[1:26:24] they went now here's one at the gate
[1:26:25] beautiful
[1:26:27] Peter and John went together to the
[1:26:29] temple to our prayer being the ninth
[1:26:31] hour and a certain man laying from his
[1:26:33] mother's womb was carried whom they laid
[1:26:35] daily at the Gate of the temple which
[1:26:36] was called Beautiful to ask alms of them
[1:26:38] that entered into the temple
[1:26:41] look who's seeing Peter and John about
[1:26:43] to go into the temple ask an alms
[1:26:47] and Peter fastened his eyes upon him
[1:26:49] with John and said look on us
[1:26:51] and he gave heed unto them expecting to
[1:26:53] receive something of them expecting to
[1:26:57] receive something of them
[1:26:59] expecting to receive something when you
[1:27:02] walked through that door expecting to
[1:27:04] receive something when you press play
[1:27:06] expecting to receive something when you
[1:27:08] open a book and read a book or read the
[1:27:10] Bible expecting
[1:27:12] we we should not read this like a
[1:27:14] newspaper and I know we do sometimes
[1:27:17] well I got to read my daily devotion you
[1:27:19] know whatever it is
[1:27:22] are you expecting to receive something
[1:27:25] wow then Peter said Silver and Gold Have
[1:27:28] I None but such as I have
[1:27:31] not that I got to go get or go by or
[1:27:33] talk to Jesus again come on somebody
[1:27:35] Jesus had already left and he said what
[1:27:37] power I got I'm giving to y'all and you
[1:27:40] use that power the same way I did
[1:27:43] such as I have give out thee in the name
[1:27:45] of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and
[1:27:47] walk and he took him by the hand and
[1:27:49] lifted him up and immediately his feet
[1:27:51] and ankle bones received straight wow
[1:27:54] what a miracle
[1:27:55] and he leaped up
[1:27:57] the temple walking leaping and praising
[1:27:59] God and all the people saw him walking
[1:28:01] and praising God and they knew it was he
[1:28:03] that sat at Arms so that other people
[1:28:05] aren't seeing him the whole time they
[1:28:07] were filled with wondering amazement
[1:28:10] at that which had happened to him and as
[1:28:13] the lame man which was healed held Peter
[1:28:15] and John all the people ran together
[1:28:16] unto them an importance is called
[1:28:18] Solomon's greatly wondering and when
[1:28:20] Peter saw it look he answered unto the
[1:28:22] people you men of Israel why Marvel yet
[1:28:25] this
[1:28:26] or why look you so earnestly on us as
[1:28:29] though by our own power our Holiness we
[1:28:32] had made this man to walk the god of
[1:28:35] Abraham Isaac and Jacob the god of our
[1:28:37] fathers has glorified his son Jesus he's
[1:28:39] preaching them a little sermonette here
[1:28:40] whom you delivered up and denied him in
[1:28:43] the presence of pilate when he was
[1:28:45] determined to let him go but you denied
[1:28:47] the Holy One and the just and desired a
[1:28:50] murderer to be granted unto you he
[1:28:53] rebuked everyone I'm standing there the
[1:28:55] whole Temple full of priests probably
[1:28:57] full of Caiaphas was there and satis and
[1:29:00] a whole bunch he said y'all bunch
[1:29:02] what'd you do you denied the very one
[1:29:05] that you're saying that you worship
[1:29:07] let's look at this real quick and then
[1:29:09] we'll
[1:29:10] closing and we'll back up maybe next
[1:29:12] Sunday
[1:29:13] preach a little more on this Revelation
[1:29:15] 6 verse 1. so now let's shake yourself
[1:29:16] for just a minute
[1:29:18] and let's see if we can put these
[1:29:19] together
[1:29:20] and the second one and the third one and
[1:29:22] all down through here and I saw when the
[1:29:24] lamb opened one of the seals and I heard
[1:29:26] is it where the noise of Thunder one of
[1:29:28] the four beasts saying come and see now
[1:29:29] which one was it it was lion the lion
[1:29:33] which was the power the powerful one all
[1:29:36] right
[1:29:37] and I saw and behold a white horse
[1:29:39] and he sat on him had a ball why horse
[1:29:42] not a dirty one white horse seemed to be
[1:29:45] righteous
[1:29:46] seem to have power
[1:29:49] and he sat on him had a bowl we know
[1:29:52] that he didn't have any arrows he was a
[1:29:53] bluff but it kind of looks good the way
[1:29:55] this is
[1:29:56] put in the Bible right kind of looks
[1:29:59] good kind of looks good because brother
[1:30:00] Brown even was deceived come on somebody
[1:30:03] he preached the mighty conqueror in 1957
[1:30:05] 1959 and said that was the Holy Ghost
[1:30:10] but remember
[1:30:11] he had to progress once those seals
[1:30:14] opened he knew that white horse rider
[1:30:15] was the Antichrist not Jesus Christ all
[1:30:18] right and I'll be holding a white horse
[1:30:20] and he that said on him had a bow
[1:30:22] well if you don't believe bro if you
[1:30:23] don't believe me go to the first seal
[1:30:24] brother said if I I'd have made a
[1:30:26] horrible mistake if the Lord hadn't come
[1:30:27] into the room what he was going to
[1:30:28] preach that that was why horse rider was
[1:30:30] the Holy Ghost
[1:30:32] well he said I'm just telling you what
[1:30:34] he said don't don't throw stones at me
[1:30:38] and I saw him Behold a white horse and
[1:30:40] he that sent on him had a bowl look and
[1:30:42] a crown was given
[1:30:44] a crown was given unto him
[1:30:46] and he went forth conquering
[1:30:48] and to conquer
[1:30:51] now that word
[1:30:55] brilliant
[1:30:56] that white horse
[1:30:58] brilliant brilliant from whiteness
[1:31:00] spoken of the garments of angels of
[1:31:02] those exalted to the Splendor of the
[1:31:05] Heavenly State shining or white garments
[1:31:07] worn on festive or state occasions look
[1:31:09] used of white garments as the sign of
[1:31:12] innocence and purity of Soul that's how
[1:31:14] Satan presented himself
[1:31:19] he presented himself in the first church
[1:31:21] age as that a white righteous Church
[1:31:26] that God was right there he used white
[1:31:29] oh look at white that means purity
[1:31:34] that was the worst mistake
[1:31:37] that people made by pointing to that and
[1:31:39] saying that's God
[1:31:41] because it wasn't God none of this whole
[1:31:44] six one two it's not God six two it's
[1:31:47] not God
[1:31:48] that's Satan
[1:31:50] but we give him as Brother Gary Atkins
[1:31:53] always said we give him the power
[1:31:55] we draw virtue the world draws virtue
[1:31:58] off of that daily
[1:32:01] the whole world
[1:32:03] listen the whole world is deceived
[1:32:07] except for the bride
[1:32:09] read your Bible revelations of whatever
[1:32:12] it is 17 or somewhere another he
[1:32:13] deceived the whole world
[1:32:16] except those names were written in the
[1:32:18] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:32:19] foundation world to see the law
[1:32:21] Revelations 13 8.
[1:32:24] because it correlates with Hebrews 13 8.
[1:32:27] you still used white garments as a sign
[1:32:30] of innocence and Purity then that word
[1:32:32] conquer
[1:32:34] means Nico or niqueo are
[1:32:39] nicolaitan Spirit look overcome
[1:32:44] conquer prevail
[1:32:46] get the victory
[1:32:49] to conquer to carry off the victory come
[1:32:51] off Victorious now of Christ it's
[1:32:54] Victorious over all this foes of
[1:32:55] Christians that hold flash their faith
[1:32:57] even into death against the power of
[1:32:59] their foes and Temptation and
[1:33:00] persecution when one is arraigned or
[1:33:03] goes to law to win the case maintain
[1:33:05] one's cause and wrote myself a note that
[1:33:07] was all a false power in Revelation 6
[1:33:09] verse 2.
[1:33:12] but the world one more time the world on
[1:33:15] that scripture draws virtue saying that
[1:33:19] that's God
[1:33:21] when it's the devil
[1:33:23] but on the flip side like I said before
[1:33:26] when the sale opened it meant that Jesus
[1:33:29] was revealed first
[1:33:32] that there is a white righteous church
[1:33:34] that there is something what conquer and
[1:33:37] to conquer what's the statue of perfect
[1:33:39] man
[1:33:40] who you conquering I'm Conquering the
[1:33:43] devil no you're not you're conquering
[1:33:44] yourself
[1:33:46] you conquering yourself
[1:33:48] and you can't be white there was a white
[1:33:50] righteous Church in the first church age
[1:33:52] but Satan was right there mirroring the
[1:33:54] whole thing all the way down through
[1:33:55] there
[1:33:56] listen the first church first two or
[1:33:58] three Church ages they did conquer they
[1:34:00] conquered Satan
[1:34:03] by their power that was given to that
[1:34:05] virtue that was given of the true word
[1:34:07] of God and then what happened
[1:34:09] Satan turns around and gets on another
[1:34:11] horse
[1:34:13] and he starts deceiving them again
[1:34:16] right and listen he deceives them this
[1:34:19] time with a little bit of
[1:34:22] knowledge
[1:34:23] that's the next one coming up
[1:34:26] the second seal is what
[1:34:28] he comes in he's a red horse
[1:34:31] all right
[1:34:32] and he rides through a couple of church
[1:34:34] ages
[1:34:35] false power the whole time
[1:34:38] but it was knowledge
[1:34:40] when they went to nicaea it was
[1:34:42] knowledge of man that created these
[1:34:44] false doctrines
[1:34:46] not God God does not ever formulate a
[1:34:50] false Doctrine
[1:34:51] but Satan gets on his white horse in the
[1:34:54] first church age and he deceives them
[1:34:56] enough
[1:34:57] to take the power away from the church
[1:34:59] and for the church to put all their
[1:35:01] strength and virtue or a false power on
[1:35:04] that what Beast system
[1:35:06] that's why nicolaitan conquered the
[1:35:09] laity if they conquer the laity they got
[1:35:12] everything else
[1:35:13] so that false power is what come up in
[1:35:17] the first few Church ages that's why
[1:35:18] that we had to have a faith that went
[1:35:20] back to that first church age brought
[1:35:22] the true word of God the true virtue and
[1:35:25] brought it into this church age
[1:35:28] by a prophet that what preached listen
[1:35:30] there's not a man like I said beside
[1:35:33] Jesus Christ that had as much virtue as
[1:35:34] that man did
[1:35:37] that you could pull from him and he
[1:35:39] could call 50 people on a prayer line to
[1:35:41] get to about number 10 and he's
[1:35:43] staggering
[1:35:44] he's had so much strength pulled out of
[1:35:47] him by the congregation and by the
[1:35:49] people but you know what it had to be
[1:35:51] there first
[1:35:54] it had to be there that's why to me he's
[1:35:57] a Vindicated prophet and if you turn him
[1:35:59] down
[1:36:03] that white horse has got you
[1:36:05] right that false power has got you
[1:36:09] so The Virtue now watch
[1:36:11] let's talk about just for a minute let's
[1:36:13] talk about the church being a woman
[1:36:17] everybody understand everybody with me I
[1:36:20] know about half y'all are asleep but I'm
[1:36:21] going to preach right on
[1:36:24] somebody listen Ruth 3 verse 11 says
[1:36:27] look and now my daughter now this is
[1:36:28] this is Boaz and Ruth right
[1:36:31] Ruth being on top of the church or top
[1:36:34] of you and me because we need a
[1:36:35] Redemption and now my daughter fear not
[1:36:38] I will do to thee all that thou requires
[1:36:40] for all the city of my people
[1:36:43] does know that thou art a virtuous woman
[1:36:45] how'd they know that
[1:36:47] how'd they know that
[1:36:49] by the way she acted
[1:36:52] in the city
[1:36:53] not just in the church
[1:36:55] in the city in our everyday life going
[1:36:57] into Naomi coming out from Naomi going
[1:37:00] into Boaz and going and doing the things
[1:37:02] same way with me and you to me that's
[1:37:04] the virtue and the strength that God
[1:37:06] wants us for each one of us like I said
[1:37:09] before when that first seal opened it
[1:37:11] opened and it exposed the Antichrist but
[1:37:14] to me it revealed Jesus Christ and where
[1:37:16] he was
[1:37:19] or who he is
[1:37:21] he's in me and you he was in that first
[1:37:23] three Church ages there was truth in
[1:37:26] those churches it wasn't just completely
[1:37:27] wiped out no but Satan tried his best to
[1:37:30] put the light out
[1:37:32] because remember in the fourth Church
[1:37:33] age he almost got everybody
[1:37:36] he killed 68 million Christians
[1:37:39] born-again Believers because of what
[1:37:41] what they believed
[1:37:44] but for all the city of my people to
[1:37:46] know that thou art a virtuous woman
[1:37:48] Proverbs 12 verse 4. the Bible says a
[1:37:52] virtuous woman is a crown to her husband
[1:37:55] bride
[1:37:58] bridegroom
[1:38:00] a virtuous Bride is a crown to the
[1:38:04] bridegroom that's what God's looking for
[1:38:06] now people he's looking for that in me
[1:38:08] and you listen he wasn't looking for it
[1:38:11] in the fourth Church age they could
[1:38:12] barely just say they were Christians in
[1:38:14] the fourth Church AIDS and they died
[1:38:15] they didn't have much of a life
[1:38:17] right
[1:38:18] but now you and I look we live flowery
[1:38:22] bed of ease almost
[1:38:24] amen
[1:38:25] we drive cars that cost more than most
[1:38:27] houses did when we were growing up
[1:38:30] right
[1:38:33] Proverbs 12 verse 4 says a virtuous
[1:38:35] woman is what a crown to a husband now
[1:38:38] remember a crown was given in that first
[1:38:40] seal
[1:38:41] a crown was given was it a real crown no
[1:38:44] it's a false crown
[1:38:46] that was a false Crown given so he could
[1:38:48] look good Satan wants to look good he
[1:38:52] wants everybody to look good that's why
[1:38:54] he wants you to paint your face up and
[1:38:56] he wants you to put you on tight clothes
[1:38:57] they want you to do this and have all
[1:38:59] the glamor of the world
[1:39:03] but the most beautiful people in the
[1:39:04] world is the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:39:07] don't have to put on
[1:39:09] don't have to take off
[1:39:13] some of these people you see out there
[1:39:15] in the world and they're like
[1:39:17] I'd hate to see that with all that off
[1:39:18] of her paint what I'm talking about
[1:39:22] a virtuous woman is a crown or a husband
[1:39:24] my question to you is can you do that
[1:39:29] can you do that
[1:39:31] can Lord Jesus look at you and say
[1:39:33] that's my virtuous wife
[1:39:37] spotless
[1:39:39] sinless
[1:39:41] really let me read you a quote here
[1:39:44] but now she that maketh ashamed is
[1:39:46] rottenness in his bones
[1:39:49] righteous and just listen to this and
[1:39:52] we'll read something in just a second
[1:39:53] and we'll close The Virtuous person
[1:39:55] exhibits The Joint Excellence of reason
[1:39:58] and character
[1:39:59] a virtuous person not only knows what
[1:40:02] the good thing to do is he or she is
[1:40:04] always also emotionally attached to it
[1:40:10] think about that run that around your
[1:40:12] head
[1:40:13] a virtuous person not only knows what
[1:40:16] the good thing to do is he or she is
[1:40:17] emotionally attached to him Jesus was
[1:40:20] emotionally attached to Lazarus
[1:40:22] he was emotionally attached to that
[1:40:24] Centurion because he looked at that
[1:40:25] Center and he said I can't find no
[1:40:27] greater faith in Israel everybody in
[1:40:28] Israel
[1:40:29] devil
[1:40:31] the ones that don't sound I'm a devil
[1:40:32] sound this and Sam that
[1:40:35] Centurion just saw him live his life
[1:40:41] can the Centurion in your life
[1:40:45] do the same thing
[1:40:53] question
[1:40:54] can the people in the world see that
[1:40:56] you're different
[1:40:57] that you've got virtue about you that
[1:40:59] the world can't touch
[1:41:01] that's my question to you and then if
[1:41:04] when you got it do you know what to do
[1:41:05] with it you're emotionally attached to
[1:41:06] it in other words I want the virtue of
[1:41:08] Jesus Christ I don't want that virtue of
[1:41:10] the white horse rider I don't want to be
[1:41:11] given a crown
[1:41:14] right
[1:41:16] don't worry
[1:41:19] you'll get a crown
[1:41:21] but it'll be because the virtue of Jesus
[1:41:23] Christ not because the virtue of
[1:41:24] somebody giving you that like the devil
[1:41:27] let's listen to this quote and then
[1:41:28] we'll close but I like that
[1:41:31] you not only know what to do but you're
[1:41:33] emotionally attached to it that's our
[1:41:35] problem
[1:41:36] we're not emotionally attached to the
[1:41:37] word and I'm not talking about crying
[1:41:39] and I'm talking about emotion I'm
[1:41:40] talking about not having Agape I mean
[1:41:43] filial love but agape love for the word
[1:41:44] of God agape love virtue not the other
[1:41:48] one
[1:41:49] listen to this
[1:41:51] reunion the bride of Christ musicians
[1:41:54] come on
[1:41:56] he the bridegroom took away your shame
[1:41:59] and put it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:42:00] by the washing of the word of the word
[1:42:02] and the blood of life
[1:42:04] that's what the Bible said your first
[1:42:07] husband that you were married to the
[1:42:09] world
[1:42:10] the anointed bridegroom which
[1:42:12] foreordained you has washed you by the
[1:42:14] washing
[1:42:15] of the Water by the church congregation
[1:42:18] says no that don't sound right does it
[1:42:21] you might find that in the almanac but
[1:42:23] you're not going to find out in God's
[1:42:24] Bible
[1:42:25] by the washing of the Water by the word
[1:42:27] in the word see by the you are standing
[1:42:30] completely
[1:42:32] Justified let's stand as though you
[1:42:35] never did it at the beginning
[1:42:37] this is my message to the church this
[1:42:40] was on actually this was on Thanksgiving
[1:42:42] Day I believe it was and this was his
[1:42:44] Thanksgiving message kind of a weird
[1:42:46] message to the world that he didn't talk
[1:42:48] about pilgrims and turkeys
[1:42:51] he talked about your standing completely
[1:42:53] Justified as though you never did it at
[1:42:56] the beginning
[1:42:58] that's virtue folks
[1:43:01] this is my message to the church now as
[1:43:03] we go off the air just in a moment just
[1:43:05] in a minute you are standing if you're
[1:43:08] standing on God's word and with God's
[1:43:10] word every amen every jot every Tittle
[1:43:13] where you're standing question mark I'm
[1:43:15] trying to tell you pull away from them
[1:43:18] shucks
[1:43:20] and get out here in the wheat where you
[1:43:22] can get right before the sun I hear the
[1:43:25] coming of the combine you're standing
[1:43:27] complete Justified like you never did it
[1:43:30] in the first place Hallelujah talk about
[1:43:34] a Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more
[1:43:36] thankful for that than anything I know
[1:43:38] of listen to this you the bride this
[1:43:41] virtuous woman I'm talking about you are
[1:43:43] the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the
[1:43:46] son of the Living God every man and
[1:43:48] woman that's born of the spirit of God
[1:43:50] and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:43:52] and believes every word of God stands as
[1:43:54] doe you never sinned at the first place
[1:43:58] can we not draw virtue off of that can
[1:44:01] we not draw straight that's where our
[1:44:02] strength should come that God said that
[1:44:04] about us God said it in the word about a
[1:44:07] virtuous woman and then he sent us a
[1:44:08] prophet to reiterate that it says you
[1:44:13] though you never sinned at the first
[1:44:14] place you are perfect
[1:44:16] by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:44:19] amen you are
[1:44:23] virtue
[1:44:25] of God not the devil because there's two
[1:44:28] Powers working we know that
[1:44:30] and this power over here and this power
[1:44:32] over here there's not a lot of
[1:44:34] difference in it
[1:44:36] as far as what we see
[1:44:37] because it's deceiving 99 of the world
[1:44:41] it's deceiving them they're deceived I'm
[1:44:43] sorry the Bible says they're deceived
[1:44:47] they're deceived and only one percent of
[1:44:49] maybe one percent in this whole world
[1:44:52] believes that they are the Bride of
[1:44:55] Jesus Christ and the Bible will back it
[1:44:58] up
[1:44:59] right the
[1:45:02] Bulls had to back up what brother Brown
[1:45:03] says it wasn't your brother Brown said
[1:45:05] it and I believe it and that's it
[1:45:08] well you know
[1:45:09] he can his son can say that or whoever
[1:45:12] can say that but uh
[1:45:16] I believe that we live by every word of
[1:45:18] God
[1:45:19] hey man
[1:45:21] and brother round speaks the word of God
[1:45:23] that's God talking to us and I believe
[1:45:26] that
[1:45:27] but when you say that that means you
[1:45:29] ain't got to study it's just uh he said
[1:45:31] it and I believe it
[1:45:33] you got to study the Bible says to show
[1:45:35] yourself approved a Workman in need is
[1:45:37] not be ashamed what rightly dividing
[1:45:39] what you hear on those books and tapes
[1:45:42] rightly those of you here on those books
[1:45:45] and tapes rightly dividing what you hear
[1:45:48] from this pulpit
[1:45:50] rightly dividing not wrongly dividing
[1:45:53] rightly dividing the word of Truth amen
[1:45:55] because you know what there's one one
[1:45:58] quote I'm bringing where brother Brown
[1:45:59] said let's stand up today and address
[1:46:00] the third person of the Trinity well he
[1:46:02] never believes in no third person of the
[1:46:04] trinity
[1:46:05] right
[1:46:08] people misunderstood him I mean you know
[1:46:09] we talk about other stuff you know
[1:46:11] brother Brown preached 1977 was going to
[1:46:13] end the world
[1:46:14] he didn't say that though they said he
[1:46:17] said that but he preached it anyway
[1:46:19] why'd he preach it confused people
[1:46:22] we're still here aren't we it proved one
[1:46:25] thing's for sure
[1:46:26] that there were some people in this
[1:46:28] world that knew what he was talking
[1:46:30] about
[1:46:32] and didn't turn their books in in 1977.
[1:46:34] like brother Dale different ones that
[1:46:37] didn't quit the message because they
[1:46:38] thought that's what he said and why did
[1:46:40] he preach that why did he preach
[1:46:42] marriage and divorce he didn't to
[1:46:43] confuse a lot of people
[1:46:48] listen brother Brown said God God
[1:46:52] would have one brother say something to
[1:46:55] another brother to see how they'll react
[1:46:59] God not the devil God will have one
[1:47:04] brother say something about another one
[1:47:05] to see how they react
[1:47:07] God knowing from the foundation of the
[1:47:09] world how you'd react to begin with but
[1:47:11] you didn't know how you'd react
[1:47:13] and if you know how to react and build
[1:47:15] on it
[1:47:17] thank God
[1:47:19] that's virtue that's strength that's
[1:47:20] power that we need not the power that's
[1:47:22] out there in the world not the power
[1:47:23] that comes from from Satan that's
[1:47:25] permitted power
[1:47:27] you and I don't have a permitted power
[1:47:30] God's not a permitted power he permits
[1:47:33] power but he's not a permitted power he
[1:47:35] is power and if you and I connect to
[1:47:38] that that makes us what The Virtuous
[1:47:40] sinless bride of Jesus Christ I'm
[1:47:42] telling you what the Bible said about us
[1:47:44] and then we need to draw strength off of
[1:47:46] that draw virtue off of that well I
[1:47:48] ain't nothing
[1:47:49] ain't nothing you ain't nothing that may
[1:47:51] be true but one day you're going to
[1:47:52] stand on your own two feet and you're
[1:47:54] gonna have to face the devil
[1:47:56] oh no not me I'll I'll let you do that
[1:47:58] no you ain't gonna let me do that
[1:48:00] brother Brown said he's building
[1:48:01] individuals
[1:48:03] you're an individual
[1:48:04] he's building individuals to what stand
[1:48:07] when the time comes to stand he's
[1:48:09] building you he's built us now for 60
[1:48:10] years or 50 years since the prophet's
[1:48:12] been gone Plus in this church trying to
[1:48:14] get us to see that we're what we can
[1:48:15] stand
[1:48:18] what a victory it is that you can stand
[1:48:20] on your own two feet in this world where
[1:48:22] they don't care what you do they don't
[1:48:24] care where you go as long as you just
[1:48:29] go as the flow I guess you might say or
[1:48:31] go as the normal
[1:48:33] that's why we're not normal
[1:48:36] I want the world to know like Martin
[1:48:38] Luther Martin Luther
[1:48:40] the world
[1:48:42] hates you
[1:48:43] pretty much is what he said
[1:48:46] and what Martin Luther say he said I
[1:48:47] want the whole world or no one I like
[1:48:48] them either
[1:48:50] that's the way I want to look I want the
[1:48:52] devil to know I don't like him
[1:48:55] you don't so you just sit there quiet
[1:48:59] he's beat us too much
[1:49:01] he's beat on us and beat on us and beat
[1:49:03] us it's time for us to look and say hey
[1:49:05] buddy your power is permitted mine is
[1:49:09] eternal yours is going to end one day
[1:49:11] mine's not you say well what if he jumps
[1:49:14] on me it'll be for your good God will
[1:49:15] not allow that unless he knows you're
[1:49:17] going to take it amen so let's start
[1:49:19] what let's start exerting some virtue

[1:53:20] [Music]
[1:53:29] where's your fear
[1:53:33] Miss Grace
[1:53:34] [Music]
[1:53:37] I hope y'all got that
[1:53:39] [Music]
[1:53:41] Miss Grace
[1:53:43] [Music]
[1:53:46] on display
[1:53:52] the innocence innocence of a child
[1:53:57] showed me Grace today
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:00] everyone you all did a good job okay
[1:54:02] don't don't get all ill but when I saw
[1:54:06] that I about shouted
[1:54:08] that's Miss Grace and then brother Ram
[1:54:10] talk about that
[1:54:12] Miss Grace Grace to the bride a real
[1:54:15] simple young child that's what we need
[1:54:18] for Grace Grace is it's the greatest
[1:54:20] thing we ever get but
[1:54:22] a young child
[1:54:24] displaying
[1:54:26] Grace with a purple dress on
[1:54:30] wow
[1:54:32] wow
[1:54:34] did you just mean to put a purple dress
[1:54:35] on her whoever did that
[1:54:37] did you do it
[1:54:44] it's the little things
[1:54:45] you look at those little things
[1:54:49] it wasn't the dinosaur sorry
[1:54:54] it was
[1:54:56] but when I saw her do that
[1:54:58] and display herself
[1:55:01] not
[1:55:03] sometimes she's a little shy
[1:55:06] but she wasn't shy of standing right
[1:55:07] here she was Miss Grace
[1:55:09] she wasn't disgrace she was Miss Grace
[1:55:12] and I thought Lord that's me
[1:55:14] that's what you did for me
[1:55:17] you put on a purple robe and went to
[1:55:19] Calvary so that I could have Grace
[1:55:22] right and it would be nothing but a
[1:55:24] simple Jesus said remember what he said
[1:55:26] he said the faith of a child
[1:55:29] [Music]
[1:55:31] the faith of a child unless you have
[1:55:33] that Faith you're not going to enter
[1:55:33] into heaven so in other words if you
[1:55:36] don't get Grace like a child
[1:55:38] that's why we try to we try to go well
[1:55:40] it's got to be Grace has got to uh well
[1:55:43] it's got to be you know 30 Hail Marys
[1:55:45] and we got to read 75 quotes childlike
[1:55:49] faith
[1:55:51] and we everyone need it
[1:55:55] if you don't have Grace you don't have
[1:55:57] God
[1:55:58] because if you don't have Grace you got
[1:55:59] the devil
[1:56:01] but man when she did that when she did
[1:56:03] that when she spun around and put
[1:56:05] herself on display

[1:56:09] she was
[1:56:10] about six or seven times ever how long
[1:56:13] many times they sang that song every
[1:56:15] time on key
[1:56:17] and I thought Lord
[1:56:19] that's for me
[1:56:21] that's Grace given to each and every one
[1:56:24] of us
[1:56:25] thank you
