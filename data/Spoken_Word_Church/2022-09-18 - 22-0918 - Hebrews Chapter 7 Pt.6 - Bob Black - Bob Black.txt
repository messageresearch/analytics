TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that we unpacked this morning and I pray Lord that you'll bless us as we study these things out and be with brother Ronnie as he's preparing Lord to bring us the word this morning granted Lord that you'll just set our hearts in order Lord Jesus to receive what you have for us this morning in your name amen so now we've kind of been going through Hebrews chapter 7 and and as we meditate on these scriptures as we as we look through them um think about um now these are my words the theme of Hebrews is Hebrews chapter 10 verse 1. that Paul's trying to sit in our mind that that um all of these things that that uh the Jews the Hebrews understood about the Old Testament were a shadow of the things that now he was pointing to that Christ had come and paid the price for us for all of our sin for uh for our healing for our Redemption and so he's saying in Hebrews chapter 10 we just skip ahead to that chapter and then we'll drop back to Hebrews chapter seven he said for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect so he's trying to sit and sit in the uh the Hebrews mind the people that he's talking to in that day you're reading this letter that he wrote that now we have access to something that was in the Old Testament it was just an image uh looking looking ahead to something that was coming now you think about what a shadow all the shadows in the Old Testament just kind of run through a few that Joni and the Jonah in the belly of the well for three days and three nights was a shadow of Christ that would die and be in the earth and that the bronze serpent was also a shadow of Christ suffering on the cross and and like the bronze Serpent of sand representing sin already judged there on that tree or on the staff that was held up if all the people would just look at him and look just look at it they would live and the man of the Phil in the wilderness was was actually something that they ate but still was a shadow of of he said I am that bread of life that came down from God out of Heaven he was he was the Fulfillment of that shadow and the rock that the Israelites drank from was a shadow of Christ who was our rock that out of him comes well a Wellspring of everlasting life and the Tabernacle in the wilderness was a shadow of of of Christ and and the model of of our of our new birth that God will take us through the outer Court inner core the holy of holies and uh a model of the of the human condition that you've got a body and a spirit and a soul it's a shadow of who of the thing that now we can look at and see our Redemption through Christ and the first Adam was a shadow of the second Adam was as it was laid out in Romans chapter 5 14. and the Passover Lamb was a something that they ate but was a shadow of of Christ dying for us and now we eat his body word as we're as we come to church and we we we read the Bible and we we're actually partaking of of the whole thing eat the whole thing like like they had to do it there in the evening time when the Cities of Refuge were a shadow of of Christ that we've got somewhere that we can run to when we when we do something that we're not supposed to do that we you know they they would run until they got to that City and when they got to the city they were safe and the temple veil was a shadow of Christ's body that was torn on the cross and Isaac the promised son was a shadow of Christ that would come and Elisha feeding a hundred men with 20 loaves was a shadow of Christ that would sit on that hill and feed feed all of the different ones that were gathered there were just a few uh fish and a few loaves of bread and even Elisha there's so many so many things that you could go through with in the Old Testament there were a shadow of other things that now we can see and and substance in reality Elisha's body dead body Elisha's dead body giving somebody life the Elisha's body laying there in a grave but yet when somebody touched it they came back to life could touched his bones and Christ died for us and his his death is what gives us life and so Elisha's dead body was a shadow of Christ and all these things that we're speaking of so now Paul's trying to set in our mind that now we've got the reality and that Melchizedek in Hebrews chapter 7 is is what he's pointing to a shadow of things to come than the Old Testament the law gave us what God demanded but Calvary gave us a provision that satisfied God's demand you see if you go back and study and I hope you are as it go back and read through Hebrews chapter 7 and see what uh just kind of study it out and meditate on those things that as Paul's talking about Melchizedek he begins to wind up that chapter talking about how we knew we need a new priest the priesthood change the law changed everything changed because he's he's now where where God gave us is requirements now we've got a priest an eternal priesthood not just a priesthood that uh you know that where they they have to keep passing it down to the next then their their son and on down through generations but we've got an eternal priesthood in Christ Jesus who can who who paid the price for us and who satisfied all of God's demands in the law so Hebrews chapter 7 says for there is verily in verse 18 verily a disannulling of the Commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof there's no way for the law to make you perfect the law can tell you you're not perfect that you need something but the law there's something else is required what it was require the life of God and to believe the Life of Christ that he would give his life on the cross to pay the price for you that that same life could come and live in The Believer for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God so that's really you know that that's that's the sense I believe of what Paul is trying to communicate to us in Hebrews chapter 7. the bringing in of a better hope now what is that better hope you know we talked about it laying out that that shadow of thinking good things to come in the Old Testament when when Melchizedek came walking up to Abraham and and and they had he served in Bread and Wine and then you can see how that foreshadows Christ there in that upper room and he's serving his disciples of bread and wine and even what did that foreshadow what did that represent that actually represented him dying on the cross for us where Jesus said this is the blood my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sin so they're on that cross what's the difference between that man that met that met Abraham that man was that God in theophany come down but then he rode himself in flesh and became my Kinsmen Redeemer that man that talked to Abraham uh came and and was born in a manger to be our Kinsmen to die on the cross so that we could have his same life so in verse 6 it says but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better and here are men that die receive tithes but he there he receiveth him of whom it has witnessed that he liveth and as I may so so say Levi also who receiveth ties paid tithes in Abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him and see there's Paul he's trying to set out that that uh in our mind to to have to understand that that that Levi was was part of Abraham and he actually paid tithes to him in the same way that you were part of Christ God knew and he had it all planned out he he he knew you were coming and he had he had uh he had the whole the whole story all planned out he wasn't surprised by anything brother said in things that are to be he said you were all pre-planned by God nothing happens by chance with God he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight did you know that just think that you at one time I repeat this again you at one time was in your father in the gene or your father now he didn't know you at that time neither did you know him at that time but you see then you were put in the betting ground in the womb of mother through holy wedlock and then you become a person expressed in the image like your father then there's Fellowship so you see what Paul's talking about is he said he said as I may so say Levi also who receiveth ties paid tithes in Abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him brother Raymond said in God's power to transform you or in the loins of your father but your father could not have any fellowship with you until you was transformed into a body of Flesh my son there was in me I wanted a son but he was in me then see he was in me then but through wedlock he was transformed into a man like me and then he become like me all you think about Jeremiah saying before of God telling Jeremiah before I formed again the belly I knew thee and before thou came us forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations that's something that if we could realize that God knew before the foundation of the world that we'd be sitting here this morning that that he knew that you would have need of something and if we can sit in our minds that that the minister is going to come forth is going to give us exactly what we have need of because God knew before the foundation of the world that we he knew we didn't need it he knew you'd be sitting here I think that should give Comfort to any believer to know that God God had it all your whole life and your the eternal life the day you would get it and everything all planned out he said in spiritual Amnesia he said notice and he is in me and I in him every Christian that's a real genuine Christian was with him with the morning Stars sang together in the sons of God shout out for Joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal Realms with God 10 million years before the world was ever formed I was back there with him if I got eternal life I was there with him I was identified with him when the morning star sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy and you think look at that little the little graph I got I've got over here on the other side that ate from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob the Levi that's a that's a long way but yet God God knew Levi was coming all the way back then before uh four generations back see what are we what are we talking about this morning with the Melchizedek Abraham met eternal life walking up to him and that same that same eternal life was manifested In the Flesh and died on the cross for you so that that same eternal life would come back into you into the believer you think about that God uh we were we were trying to tying back into Genesis 1 26 27 that God had it all mapped out the the part of himself that was going to be manifested in you and one day one day you you turned aside you heard the word preached and you were connected with that eternal life when you received it like brother Randall said in the message Investments and the messages leadership and the message things that are to be you receive the Holy Ghost you receive an eternal life so brother I'm sending the message identification when you receive eternal life there is only one forming of eternal life that's the Greek word Zoe is that right brother God's own life so you being a son you become part of that life so the life that's in you never did begin and it never can end I I hope maybe I don't know if you can see this this chart too good but the top part is that the eternity Genesis 1 26 27 and the bottom part is time down here in time you were born in sin you you went through a journey born from your your natural mother and father but there came a time when you got connected to Eternity when you receive the word and the word that you heard was quick and now you're you're connected back with what God foreknew you to be before the foundation of the world and God's power to transform he said just as you were in your father at the beginning a germ seed did you know that every one of you you were in your great great great great grandfather also did you know that read the book of Hebrews read the book of Hebrews he's saying where that we find that Levi paid tithes when he was in the loins of Abraham four generations behind him when Abraham paid ties to Melchizedek it was accounted to his great great grandson down below him and he was then in the loins of Abraham there you see so what are we talking about eternal life my brother said in the possessing all things he said now we find out that he that he met him and after the promise had been Vindicated he had Fellowship Melchizedek come out to bless Abraham and he said Blessed Be Abraham and blessed be the god of Abraham the possessor of heavens and earth earth oh my how I like that believer's promise you say what's that got to do with us maybe this morning you're thinking what's what's all these things that we're studying about got to do with me what's it what has got to do with you is there's a promise laid in God's word a promise of eternal life to every believer the Believers promises eternal life the believer's promise is life joy peace long-suffering gentleness patience fruits of the spirit Divine Healing a dozen things I got wrote down here nearly that is your possession it's your possession because you're part of him so in verse 11 of Hebrews chapter 7 it says if therefore Perfection were by the levitical priesthood if you could get perfected by the levitical priesthood what do you need another priesthood for for Andre the people received the law what further need was there another priest that should rise after the order of Melchizedek and not be called after the order of Aaron now if you ever read the Pilgrim's Progress you remember that how the pilgrims started off with that that burden on his back and he went on he went journeying with that bird he was trying to get rid of the burden and the only thing that can get rid of that burden of Pilgrim in that story was the cross that's the only thing that we can get rid of our bird and that's why we needed another priest because what's going to get rid of your burden of trying to live trying to live right trying to do right what good does it do if you're like the Rich Young Ruler and you you do all the things but get down in your heart you still got iniquity down in your heart there's something wrong or something Twisted you can't love your brother you can't love God the way that you need to that what good does it do if you can keep all these things and like Jesus told the Rich Young Mueller yet there's you there's something lacking there's something lacking in your life we needed we needed a priesthood that's different from that old Old Testament priesthood an eternal priesthood that God himself would come and die for us so what's the if we go uh it's a little bit small I don't know if you can read all that but I'll just run through so the order the the order of the priesthood is is going to be changed from the order of Aaron to the order of Melchizedek the priesthood is going to be changed what's the difference now the order of Aaron was an imperfect priesthood but the order of Melchizedek is a perfect priesthood the order of Aaron is temporary you every year you got to repeat your sacrifices you've got to come back and you got to do it over and over again but the order of Melchizedek is a permanent atonement Christ entered in once for all the order of Aaron is insufficient but the order of Melchizedek is sufficient that Christ's sacrifice was sufficient to make a way for the believer's Perfection the order of Aaron can't reconcile man to God and can't represent God to man and can't remove the sin barrier but the order of Melchizedek can the order of Aaron cannot bring man to Perfection but the order of Melchizedek can the order of Aaron is just Earthly it's just a priesthood that's passed down according to the flesh but the order of Melchizedek is a royal Heavenly priesthood that isn't based on any carnal linears that's passed down from generation to generation but it's based on eternal life the order of air and the priesthood after the order of Aaron is that that the priest the priest that comes to represent you as a sinner his own self but the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek is a as a priest that is sinless the high priesthood after the order of air and is is under sentence of death and under condemnation of the law but the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek it broke the power of death and fulfills all the requirements of the law through Christ faith in Christ sacrifice so if we keep reading through Hebrews chapter 7 it says in verse 12 for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe not Levi but now he's going to talk about Judy he's flipping everything over of which no man gave attendance at the altar for it is evident that our Lord spring out of Judah of which try Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of Melchizedek there ariseth another priest who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life of God sends his power into the church to make you live different and think different and to to to to cover cover over all of your sins to satisfy everything that the carnal commandment could not for he testifies thou art a priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek for there is verily a disannulling of the Commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God that's right what kind of a new commandment are we talking about the Commandment that Jeremiah prophesied of in Jeremiah 31 where he said behold the days come saith the Lord that I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt which my Covenant they break although I was a husband unto them saith the Lords he's saying I'm not going to make a covenant where with all these things that you've got to keep but I'm listen to The Covenant he's going to make but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my law and their inward parts and ride it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the Lord for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more you think about what a blessing it is that that that law that Moses came down from the mountain with if you could take that law that was on the stone and put it into a believer's heart now that law that they looked at and kind of pondered over but now it's alive inside of a Believer living and walking onto your feet now you can love somebody the way that I somebody smites your face or or spits on you you can love them back because the law that was on those tables of stone is now written on the tables of your heart so that's you you now we I I told you we were gonna we're gonna put put things together all the way from Melchizedek serving Bread and Wine to Abraham bring it all the way over to Christ in that Upper Room serving Bread and Wine is a type of the New Testament the New Testament has blood The Life of Christ and and his flesh being broken on the cross his life being poured out so that we could have fellowship with him so that all those attributes that were in him could be put on display and manifested and he could have fellowship with us and and talk with us in love with and show and reveal itself to us so brother Adam said in Hebrews chapter 7 he said when he was preaching this he said you can't no matter what you do you quit drinking quit smoking quit telling lies go to church and try to do this and try to do that you're still carnal that's just law the law makes nothing perfect but what makes perfect Christ I might quit lying quit stealing quit committing adultery quit chewing quit all the things and I'm still carnal God don't receive it because I have nothing to offer him in propitiation but the minute that I lay my hands upon the Blessed head of the Lord Jesus and say Lord I'm no good will you take me as your servant and God kisses away my sin I stand perfect in the sight of God I'm not standing on my own Merit standing on kids and he has perfected us through his suffering and his blood that's that's the melchized that Paul is talking about in Hebrews chapter 7. I'm not standing on my own merits like the Rich Young Ruler when Jesus talked to him in verse 17 of Mark chapter 10 he said when he was going forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life he was trying to interrupt life eternal life by just keeping the law and Jesus said unto him why call us without me good there is none good but one that is God thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery they're not killed and I still do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said I am master all these have I observed from my youth then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lack us go thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me there's something we need that goes beyond just keeping the law just being a good church member just coming and paying your tithes but we've got to be born again in Hebrews chapter 7 if we keep reading he's in verse 20 he said and as much as not without enough he was made priests for those priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him that said unto him the Lord swear and will not repent thou art a priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek but by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better Testament and that the scripture that we keep going back to in Psalm 110 the Lord has sworn and not will not repent thou art a priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek God God made an oath he made an oath to Abraham that he was going to give a promise he made an oath that during Psalms that he was going to send a priest after the order of Melchizedek so brother Brown was saying in the water of Separation in 1955 he said the Old Testament we had laws and bylaws and things that people had to do by The Works of the law to be saved but God wound everything in the Old Testament right up and put it in Calvary that believer hath now only has one thing to do look to Calvary and be born again that's all it is just so simple the laws and all the ceremonies and everything passed away with the shedding of the blood when my shadow was coming to me when my shadow and I meet my shadow was no more but I took the place of my shadow and that's the way the law was and so forth the Old Testament was the shadow of the New Testament and was fulfilled Grace and law met at Calvary and law was fulfilled and Grace come into existence Paul said in verse 23 and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man because he continuous ever hath an unchangeable priesthood wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them for such an high priest became us who was wholly harmless undefiled separate from Sinners and made higher than the heavens and brother around said this about this he said there it is now if I try to represent my own case I'll lose it if I try to represent say well my daddy was a good man my daddy was a preacher well I've lived in church I still lost it but this man is a perfect one to Christ he sits there and offers his blood constantly for my sins there you are so in verse 27 Paul said we who needs us not daily as those High priests to offer of sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this did he wants when he offered up himself and the musicians can go ahead and come forward for the law maketh men High priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who was consecrated forevermore what's the word of the oath the oath that I'm sinning a promise I'm sending the promise of a priest after the order of Melchizedek to give you eternal life in Genesis chapter 22 he made Abraham that promise of a promised son and in Psalm 2 1 10 he made a promise of a priest after the order of Melchizedek and brother Graham said again he said but the real thing is this nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling oh God naked Wounded Knee sucker oh I most only come Christ confessing that I am nothing and there's nothing Within Me perceive Me O God then God receives you now you might not even know your ABCs you might not know coffee from split peas you might not know G from hall right from left hand it won't don't make any difference what you don't know there's one thing you must know that Jesus Christ took your place as a sinner and you take your place to stand in his righteousness confessing every day that you're wrong and love him with all your heart and your whole motives be set towards him you'll make Heaven that's all there is to it for the love that was in Christ for the life that was in Christ has to be in you or your loss there's the theme of Hebrews chapter 7. and brother Rams are Paul said in verse 28 he said for the law maketh men High priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who was consecrated forevermore you think about that the lyrics of that song Rock of Ages cleft for me is speaking of that oath the immutable two immutable things that a God who cannot lie made a promise of eternal life Rock of Ages Cliff for me let me hide myself a knee let the water and the blood from thy wounded side which flowed be of sin the double cure and brother Brandon said double cure he swore by it two immutable things that a God that cannot lie made a promise to you we've got something that we can lay hold on this morning I hate on those words as you prepare for the for the sermon this morning and just think about that and let it build up your faith in you this morning God bless you
