[0:23] we pray that God will bless them and so
[0:25] let's just sing open the eyes of my
[0:27] heart is brother Danny del mundo from
[0:29] the Philippines comes to speak the word
[0:30] of the Lord unto us tonight oh my oh my
[0:35] heart
[0:38] Oh
[0:42] I want to say
[0:46] I want to see
[0:54] opening the eyes of my heart
[0:59] open the eyes of my heart
[1:03] I want to see
[1:09] to see to see
[1:18] [Music]
[1:20] joining in the
[1:22] [Music]
[1:25] pour out your power
[1:29] as we say
[1:33] [Music]
[1:35] hi
[1:36] [Music]
[1:40] shining in the light of your glory
[1:45] pour out your power
[1:49] as we say holy
[1:53] we heard
[1:58] holy holy holy
[2:02] [Music]
[2:08] Oh
[2:11] holy holy I want to see
[2:19] praise the Lord the Bible said blessed
[2:22] are those who are humble for they shall
[2:25] see God amen so that's the only way
[2:29] where we can see him and that's to
[2:32] humble ourselves before him probably
[2:36] that's the that's the thought where we
[2:38] are going tonight amen I can say goodbye
[2:46] all right so you see let's go straight
[2:52] to the reading of the word tonight amen
[2:55] in Psalms chapter 65 let's read verse 4
[3:03] it says here this very familiar
[3:05] Scripture blessed is the man whom thou
[3:09] chooses and causes to approach unto thee
[3:14] that he may dwell in thy courts we shall
[3:19] be satisfied with the goodness of the
[3:21] house even of thy holy temple amen let's
[3:26] bow our heads in prayer dear Heavenly
[3:28] Father we thank you for your mercy we
[3:30] thank you for your blood and tonight we
[3:33] certainly appreciate your presence
[3:36] because that's the only way where we can
[3:39] meet you and once again Lord bless this
[3:44] church this congregation bless but Sam
[3:49] well Lord God is family and it's
[3:51] ministry and all the people that are
[3:53] standing with him to propagate this
[3:56] endtime gospel we thank you and we give
[3:59] you all the glory and honor in Jesus
[4:01] Christ wonderful name amen praise the
[4:05] Lord God bless you you may be seated
[4:07] amen praise the Lord I would like to
[4:10] greet you once again in the name of the
[4:13] Lord Jesus Christ it's good to be back
[4:15] here and really appreciate by the
[4:20] samwell for always giving me the
[4:24] opportunity when there's when there's
[4:27] opportunity amen
[4:29] and good to see my friend by the way
[4:33] better Luis and his family glad to see
[4:36] them also I saw brother John amen so god
[4:39] bless you and we're just doing good by
[4:45] God's grace amen
[4:46] a lot of things are really going on on
[4:51] the other side amen but praise God we we
[4:56] we cannot do anything without him and we
[5:00] really will really appreciate your your
[5:02] prayers and let it letting us feel that
[5:07] you are behind us to push on and press
[5:12] on with this ministry amen so back there
[5:15] in the Philippines there's still a lot
[5:19] of things going on in various islands
[5:22] and also we have the opportunity to be
[5:27] able to witness and propagate this
[5:31] gospel to the other parts of Southeast
[5:34] Asia and there are some and many
[5:37] developments that are actually going on
[5:42] particularly in in Myanmar before I have
[5:45] mentioned to you and I will keep on
[5:48] mentioning because the Lord has been so
[5:51] good because since I started going to
[5:56] Myanmar in in 2005 if I'm not mistaken
[6:02] it is quite different today because at
[6:06] that time they were still under the
[6:09] military junta where you know there are
[6:12] there were soldiers everywhere and the
[6:17] moment you step into the airport to the
[6:21] immigration they will check your
[6:23] itinerary and they will really check you
[6:25] on the hotels that you have indicated as
[6:30] you enter so but today things have
[6:33] changed because now their economy is
[6:36] also moving forward a lot of things are
[6:39] going on they see a lot of
[6:42] action going on and I believe it is
[6:45] God's Way of doing these things so that
[6:53] the gospel will be you know we don't
[6:56] have much time to propagate this endtime
[6:59] gospel and so probably way back in 2012
[7:07] I was praying because every time we go
[7:10] there we we oftentimes see the same the
[7:16] same people the same the same ministers
[7:19] and the Lord has placed in my heart a
[7:24] great burden and I was praying Lord you
[7:27] know if if you are pleased with what I'm
[7:31] doing here in in Myanmar I pray that you
[7:34] give me more new open doors and new and
[7:39] younger translators where you know we
[7:42] can we can travel around and in so short
[7:46] a time since probably two years ago the
[7:52] Lord has opened up new doors and now we
[7:55] have started a work I sent you some
[7:59] reports on that and so there's a place
[8:04] which is called PA province seven hours
[8:07] from Yangon and it's really fresh it is
[8:12] message from the ground it's now a group
[8:17] who have come out of the denomination
[8:18] and we baptize the the pastor his family
[8:21] and probably close to 30 of his
[8:26] congregation have been baptized one of
[8:29] them one of them one of them was a
[8:34] Buddhist nun who's been in the Buddhist
[8:39] only then I knew there were nuns also in
[8:42] the Buddhist in this Buddhist Nana an
[8:45] old woman and he or she she heard about
[8:52] this faith and
[8:55] she got baptized and there was a there
[9:01] was a man behind now before the start of
[9:06] the service they were singing and the
[9:09] the pastor was saying something I just
[9:11] took a picture in front and I was able
[9:14] to take a picture up to the background
[9:17] and I never noticed that and then when
[9:23] [Music]
[9:24] the following day there were 12 people
[9:29] who decided to be baptized and one of
[9:33] the one of the brothers or one of the
[9:36] men that the pastor testified his
[9:40] brother is he owned that that's his that
[9:44] that his name and he testified that one
[9:48] of the brothers that got baptized was
[9:51] also a Buddhist faithful and he just
[9:56] happened to pass by and he was standing
[10:00] at the back if I have opportunity I can
[10:03] show you the picture he was standing at
[10:05] the back and I was able to locate him in
[10:09] the picture that I took the day before
[10:11] and he was he had no clothes you know
[10:15] the this this Buddhist you know they
[10:17] just have this kind of garment you know
[10:19] and he asked the pastor he said I like
[10:25] what I heard and I want to attend
[10:29] tomorrow again because I conducted three
[10:31] days message presentation to them and he
[10:34] said I want to go back tomorrow but I
[10:36] don't have proper you know proper
[10:39] clothing whatsoever and the pastor gave
[10:42] him okay you just go and then on the
[10:46] same day when he went when we talked
[10:48] about the baptism in the name of the
[10:50] Lord Jesus Christ he was among the
[10:52] Brethren that had been proposed to
[10:55] so it's it's a wonderful thing that in
[10:58] that area this is a small group but by
[11:06] God's grace it is hard to avail piece of
[11:12] property there because it is a Buddhist
[11:14] dominated community but by God's grace
[11:20] and provision we were able to purchase a
[11:23] piece of property and Lord willing amen
[11:31] depending on God's provision I believe
[11:33] that the Lord continued to to see the
[11:36] need and all these things and I believe
[11:39] one of these days a church building will
[11:42] be put up in that and you know it is
[11:46] something that they say it's something
[11:48] close to impossible because it's a
[11:51] beauty sweetest community and to be able
[11:53] to purchase at least we have already
[11:57] overcome the to say it's closed now we
[12:01] will realize it's not impossible it's
[12:03] nothing is impossible with God so if the
[12:06] Lord provided for a piece of property
[12:09] amen he's more than able to provide a
[12:13] church building in that area and that is
[12:15] that is my prayer and so also we're
[12:19] doing the mission works in Japan now and
[12:24] I'm working closely with with the
[12:27] brothers probably two years ago brother
[12:33] Craig boomer and but the Tim Pruett
[12:36] approached me because they were doing
[12:38] missionary works in Gifu which is
[12:40] probably six to eight hours six or eight
[12:42] hours by train in Gifu and there were
[12:48] few source that they were visiting there
[12:51] and when we when I met them I told them
[12:53] where there is there is much action
[12:55] going on in Tokyo and the you know and
[12:57] they say if we can go together
[12:59] and put our efforts together then we
[13:03] will be able to accomplish more and so
[13:05] at one time we traveled there together
[13:08] January of the other year so brother
[13:11] Craig by the Timothy prove it and
[13:12] another brother but the George winters
[13:14] we went there together and we we got
[13:17] there all the believers some of them
[13:18] Chinese believers who moved into Japan
[13:20] and there are now residents of Japan and
[13:23] then this new believers I baptized in my
[13:27] purse trip the Lord has given me two
[13:29] souls a mother and not that the doctor
[13:32] in the Social Doctrine
[13:34] but the mother and her son which are
[13:37] pure Japanese and they got baptized and
[13:40] then when we were together there there
[13:44] is a couple the name the name of the the
[13:49] woman was Ruth and she's married to a
[13:52] Dutch that's brother and they used to be
[13:56] missionaries in in Japan they go to they
[14:01] go to Ghana and they even went to the
[14:04] Philippines before but when we when we
[14:08] met them they testified that they were
[14:11] looking for things because they have
[14:15] come out of the denomination already and
[14:18] when they come out of the denomination
[14:20] because they said we become so tired of
[14:23] these things that are going on and we
[14:25] found out you know that the Lord is
[14:27] dealing with us and so they were already
[14:31] at home
[14:34] gathering few people and testifying
[14:37] about the goodness of the Lord
[14:39] so they came out of the denomination
[14:42] even before we met them but at that same
[14:45] day brother Timothy but the Craig and
[14:47] brother George
[14:48] were living but I will be leaving home
[14:51] back to the Philippines the following
[14:53] day and so we just discussed something
[14:57] and I believe on the we took breakfast
[15:00] together before they went to the
[15:03] brothers went to the airport and then in
[15:08] the process of our conversation they you
[15:11] know to cut the story short the cat
[15:13] excited and they said well we are
[15:16] running out of time but if brother Danny
[15:18] will still spend you know
[15:21] I mentioned part of this last year if it
[15:26] brother Danny has time
[15:28] can we still sit down with you and so we
[15:32] had we had it in in the small room in
[15:35] where I where I was staying
[15:37] amen and then the continuation of that
[15:41] story they got excited about this
[15:45] message and when we discuss about the
[15:49] love dision age the sister said you mean
[15:54] Jesus Christ is already outside the
[15:57] church when we talk about love the same
[16:00] church well that's what the Bible is
[16:02] saying you know and said oh my she the
[16:06] woman testified and since the oh my I
[16:08] thought we were just trying to be
[16:10] different now we know that the Lord is
[16:15] really leading us and we believe that
[16:18] there is more entry into it so that was
[16:21] the first time that we met and then
[16:24] recently when we had the the
[16:29] continuation and we have already
[16:31] introduced them the Prophet and they
[16:35] have accepted brother Branham as the
[16:38] Prophet so I believe this is already a
[16:41] good good sign amen you know Japan is so
[16:47] different
[16:48] Japan is so different they're so close
[16:50] and it's really hard to to talk to them
[16:54] amen
[16:55] but I know the Lord has has been stupid
[16:58] and so but the Vernon has a sister in
[17:04] his church in his congregation that was
[17:07] married to a Japanese and so we are
[17:11] arranging a trip together because now
[17:15] the the Japanese is quite old and their
[17:20] children have been brought into the
[17:25] Japan already and the sister previously
[17:29] was hesitant to go to move to Japan
[17:31] because there was no message
[17:35] and so brother Vernon said we're doing a
[17:39] work there and so now the whole family
[17:43] is already in Japan so Lord willing
[17:46] brother Vernon and myself will be going
[17:51] there together and start in their family
[17:55] you know so you just include that in
[17:57] your prayers amen and also if you heard
[18:01] something about the lost believers they
[18:04] were there under challenge now because
[18:08] previously they were being attacked
[18:13] because one of the pastors who got
[18:15] baptized and received this message the
[18:17] denomination are so influential in this
[18:21] communist country and still it's still
[18:26] illegal you know unless you are
[18:28] identified with the churches that are
[18:30] recognized by the government you cannot
[18:33] preach so when this brother when this
[18:37] brothers were baptized they were being
[18:42] pressured by the authorities because the
[18:47] denominations have so much influence in
[18:50] in the government because now they
[18:54] become illegal because they came out of
[18:58] those recognized organization and it is
[19:02] not the authorities are being forced and
[19:08] they were being placed in such a
[19:11] position that they had to present they
[19:13] were being questioned and so why do you
[19:17] have to baptize in the name of the Lord
[19:19] Jesus Christ while they are baptizing in
[19:22] the name of the Father Son and the Holy
[19:24] Spirit the status and these people who
[19:27] are mediating or judging them were
[19:29] communists they don't know about the
[19:31] Bible you know then they said and then
[19:34] this this brethren just stood and said
[19:37] well we just they were the ones who led
[19:40] us to believe in the Bible and we
[19:43] recognize that but the Bible that that
[19:46] that we believe and they were the ones
[19:48] introduce us to the Bible now we found
[19:51] out that this Bible
[19:52] teets that people must be baptized in
[19:55] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[19:57] then they pointed that to the scripture
[19:59] and this judges were looking at the
[20:02] scriptures and said yeah that's right
[20:04] that's right it is it it is in your
[20:06] Bible it is in your Bible so so in the
[20:15] initial investigation it looks like they
[20:18] gained some some kind of advancement in
[20:25] though you know in this thing it looks
[20:26] like they were you know so that's the
[20:29] good point of beer and but lately we've
[20:35] got a got another news that you know it
[20:40] looks like something have happened and
[20:42] the authorities are turning their backs
[20:45] on what they have declared previously
[20:49] and so again we're asking your prayers
[20:51] for this laus believers I believe it's
[20:55] they are having a hard time the
[20:58] denominations are giving so much
[21:02] pressure and then through the
[21:03] authorities because they are not
[21:05] recognized but one of the Authority said
[21:11] well what you have to do Amen is if you
[21:16] have if you have like you know seven
[21:20] groups or five groups you know and then
[21:22] you can apply for your own you know
[21:26] organization and then if the government
[21:29] will recognize you then you will not
[21:31] have a problem okay well so I believe
[21:35] you know that that that that that thing
[21:39] will you know we will come out later but
[21:42] at this point in time nothing is
[21:44] happening it except the pressures on our
[21:46] brethren so we cannot go to to the Laos
[21:51] area but what we normally do there is a
[21:55] place in Thailand which is called the
[21:57] triangle where in that place you have
[21:59] tile and you have Cambodia and you
[22:02] the your blouse so the last people in
[22:06] the Cambodian believers they just cross
[22:09] to Thailand and we rent a place in a
[22:12] hotel and that we do the Bible studies
[22:16] and so in that way we have no problem
[22:18] when we rather than crossing Laos which
[22:21] is quite quite hard so everything is in
[22:26] the hand of the Lord these are actually
[22:29] open doors Indonesia is moving forward
[22:33] they are doing mission works on their
[22:37] own as I mentioned to you there were
[22:40] only three churches when they came there
[22:42] in 2003 and but now we have more than
[22:48] you know more than probably two dozens
[22:52] or close to 30 churches in Indonesia
[22:56] that are spreading this message except
[22:58] those works in in the home so last year
[23:05] I was able to help another two trips in
[23:10] Indonesia but I am inclined in spending
[23:14] more time in Myanmar now as they need
[23:17] more some encourage so with all your
[23:20] prayers and by the way but the burnin
[23:25] when he knew that I was going to man Mar
[23:28] he shared part of the mission fund and
[23:33] brother Brandon is doing a good job amen
[23:35] and so in that way you were part of that
[23:40] missionary okay so god bless you and
[23:43] let's let's go back to the preaching of
[23:46] the word amen so at this point I just
[23:50] want to talk a about a simple subject
[23:54] which is the right approach towards the
[23:58] Word of God amen so everything I believe
[24:02] there is always a an approach just like
[24:07] being mentioned here in some chapter 65
[24:10] he said blessed is the man whom thou
[24:13] chooses
[24:14] and cause us to approach unto thee that
[24:18] he may dwell in thy courts we shall be
[24:21] sweet I'll be satisfied with the
[24:23] goodness of thy house even of thy holy
[24:28] temple amen
[24:30] so I like what what brother Branham said
[24:32] he said you know there is always a right
[24:36] approach in everything let me put it
[24:40] this way as brother Branham said you see
[24:43] remember Jesus when he was here on earth
[24:46] talking to a bunch of people who was
[24:49] very religious very fine very cultured a
[24:52] very zealous people of God but jesus
[24:55] said to them in vain you worship Me
[24:58] teaching for doctrines the traditions of
[25:01] men remember how I used this those
[25:04] people where and how zealous of God I
[25:06] believe if we were counting the people
[25:08] who were more zealous of today or that
[25:10] day they would be more zealous than we
[25:13] are far more when it comes to keeping
[25:16] the traditions and laws and things they
[25:18] live by those and they were very serious
[25:21] of God and they believed God but Jesus
[25:24] God made flesh among I said in vain do
[25:27] you worship me now he didn't say they
[25:30] didn't worship him they were worshipping
[25:33] him but in vain amen so again we go back
[25:36] to the book of Genesis and we we find
[25:39] two men there both of them who worship
[25:42] God amen and I believe when we when we
[25:46] categorized them in in sincerity in the
[25:50] way they want to please God amen
[25:53] both of them were sincere but you know
[25:56] as a prophet of God said we can be
[25:58] sincere people can be sincere and yet
[26:00] sincerely wrong and that was proven in
[26:03] that in that occasion Cain was sincere
[26:06] amen he he offered the best of his
[26:10] harvest he offered the first fruit of
[26:14] his harvest I believe Amen because but
[26:16] but we notice that that the only
[26:19] difference is Abel's approach he
[26:24] approached the worship
[26:28] we approach God in the right manner he
[26:31] approached God in the right way
[26:33] amen so and said now far more when it
[26:38] comes to keeping the traditions and laws
[26:40] they lived up by those and they were
[26:41] very serious of God and they believed
[26:43] God but Jesus God made flesh among I
[26:46] said in vain do you worship Me
[26:48] now he didn't say they didn't worship
[26:49] Him they were worshipping him but in
[26:51] vain
[26:53] now below
[26:56] he said worship in the place that I have
[27:02] chosen even he coated the scripture but
[27:04] I'm not going to read at the same time
[27:07] now chosen what he said in display shows
[27:10] that he has a place where all people
[27:13] worship other places are in vain and in
[27:18] this same place he said I have chosen
[27:21] also to put my name in this place I'll
[27:25] choose a place and I'll put my name in
[27:28] it and in this place that is going to
[27:30] worship now this shows that there is one
[27:33] place just one it must be God's choosing
[27:37] it can be ours we have no choice coming
[27:41] he's already chosen it now what God
[27:44] chooses is right amen
[27:46] I can choose wrong you can choose wrong
[27:49] but God cannot choose right after all he
[27:53] is the one that being worshipped and
[27:55] he's got the place where he wants his
[27:57] worshipers to meet there and we must
[28:00] meet him there that's the only place
[28:03] that he stays only place that he will
[28:05] hear you from even and I like that so
[28:08] blessed is the man whom thou choices so
[28:11] there are two things that I see here God
[28:13] choose a place where he put his name and
[28:17] also even in the book of sign he said he
[28:20] also choose men to approach him now this
[28:28] is something hard to the people but this
[28:30] is something scriptural I mean meaning
[28:32] there are people who approach him but
[28:35] but their worship are in vain amen but
[28:39] we're so glad we have
[28:41] message of the hour Amen that provided
[28:43] us a ways away and means to be able to
[28:47] approach him a man in the right way and
[28:50] in the right place amen
[28:52] and he's the one doing this and Barb
[28:55] Adam said it is God's choosing alright
[28:59] and so he's saying God's choosing and
[29:02] God you know he has he has a pattern to
[29:06] approach him and so the vindicated
[29:11] prophet has us has preached to us the
[29:16] three stages of grace and were very much
[29:18] familiar with that and this is God's
[29:20] choosing even so we approach him and we
[29:25] should recognize his way we have
[29:27] recognized his pattern and that's why we
[29:29] are being justified by faith were being
[29:32] justified and you know when we are being
[29:35] justified we have not done anything yet
[29:37] it is it is all his doing when we
[29:41] approach him and when were being just if
[29:43] I do know it's him who picked us
[29:46] we were we were unworthy we were
[29:49] undeserving we are disqualified amen but
[29:54] because amen it is his own way it is his
[29:57] own choosing a man he was able to
[30:00] provide the way for us amen and by his
[30:03] own choosing he we were able to see the
[30:10] message of justification amen the judge
[30:13] shall live by faith and then and and and
[30:15] that's why I said you know in in the
[30:18] first stage of of grace which is
[30:20] justification we have not done anything
[30:23] else it's all His grace remember I'm
[30:27] justified you know justified means you
[30:31] are being counted as perfect we're not
[30:35] yet perfect but we're just being
[30:37] justified we're just being counted as
[30:40] perfect amen
[30:43] because instead of looking to our
[30:46] condition instead of looking to our
[30:48] needs instead of looking to our
[30:50] shortcomings Amen brother Branham said
[30:53] through his blood amen and only his
[30:57] blood can justify us it's not any any
[30:59] form of religion any any goodness that
[31:02] we do amen any act that we do a -
[31:05] nothing to do with it is all by His
[31:07] grace and there is no other way
[31:11] amen and so in this day and age we
[31:14] believe you know the people they go to
[31:17] the church they go to the denomination
[31:19] they become part a man they become
[31:21] members of all this organization amen
[31:24] but they cannot approach God in the way
[31:27] God wants it to be because the right
[31:32] approach is always to recognize the
[31:36] sacrifice just like in the Old Testament
[31:40] you know in in the tabernacle you know
[31:42] you have to pass through the altar and
[31:44] you have to to kill the the sacrifice
[31:48] and you have to honor that
[31:51] Amen there's no other way amen also
[31:54] unless a man recognized the sacrifice
[31:58] and you cannot recognize the sacrifice
[32:00] without recognize God God's vindicated
[32:04] prophet so before they left before they
[32:10] left Egypt talking about Israel they had
[32:13] to recognize their to listen to their
[32:16] prophet amen because God spoke to that
[32:19] prophet that they had to choose a land
[32:23] Amen that every every help the family
[32:28] should should kill the land and and they
[32:31] have to eat in heyse all right
[32:33] but you know we know that not all the
[32:37] homes not all the houses at the time
[32:39] killed lamb and so unless the Angel of
[32:45] Death can pass through the doors and see
[32:48] that blood being applied you know it
[32:53] will not pass over them and so that's
[32:55] what you know the Prophet was saying and
[32:58] he was illustrating you know there was a
[33:00] there was a son who was who kept on
[33:03] asking father father can help you have
[33:06] you killed
[33:07] have you listened to the Prophet because
[33:09] he was so nervous because he heard the
[33:13] cries of the mothers in there in the
[33:16] neighborhood and said that's that's the
[33:19] that's the cry of my friend's mother so
[33:22] that the boy a man could have thought or
[33:25] maybe his father did not listen to the
[33:27] Prophet and so the my friend was the
[33:31] first one in the family in a and and his
[33:34] mother was crying so the boy was so
[33:36] nervous amen but you see the father said
[33:41] women said now look at the table amen
[33:45] there's our land amen
[33:47] look at the doors that's the blood down
[33:49] there amen and so you see all this thing
[33:53] Ament because they listen to the prophet
[33:55] and the Prophet pointed them to the
[33:58] right sacrifice hallelujah and so they
[34:00] were they were spared amen and all those
[34:05] who obeyed the prophet in the day amen
[34:09] continued to live and they were able to
[34:11] come out of Egypt all right so it's the
[34:13] same thing today without recognizing the
[34:16] vindicated prophet of God you will not
[34:19] be able to recognize the message of the
[34:21] hour because the sacrifice Amen is none
[34:25] other than the word that is being broken
[34:27] and then it's the same thing that the
[34:30] Lamb that was being shared to the family
[34:32] and then being killed by the father and
[34:34] being being shared to the family and
[34:37] then and it come from Abe indicated
[34:40] prophet of God so that's why you see
[34:43] outside of the message of the hour
[34:46] there's no hope of the rapture they can
[34:49] talk about the rapture they can wait for
[34:51] the rapture wherever they are they can
[34:54] talk about it amenda but there's no
[34:56] reality in that unless they accept the
[34:59] message of the hour amen you can just
[35:02] talk about it you can people can just
[35:04] wait for the reckoning amen but it will
[35:08] not it will not be realized
[35:10] and we're sorry for them but you see but
[35:13] that's but that's the truth
[35:15] amen and so unless you know so that's
[35:17] why the message of the hour has the only
[35:21] power to justify a man Amen that a
[35:26] sinner can pass through Amen because
[35:29] this is the only mention we will be able
[35:33] to identify ourselves to the sacrifice
[35:38] amen in the day and age that we are
[35:40] living in hallelujah and so through that
[35:44] justification we can move forward and
[35:46] come to the sanctification you know
[35:48] there were people who are better who has
[35:50] better lives than us amen you cannot put
[35:54] finger in their lives amen they can they
[35:57] can dig in they can do good works all
[36:00] right you know you see people a lot of
[36:02] Christian foundations a lot of good
[36:06] things that they're doing all over the
[36:08] world and you can really appreciate what
[36:11] they're doing
[36:12] amen but unless you you do something
[36:16] where the message of the hour the word
[36:19] per today is the foundation yeah it will
[36:22] help it can excite people you know but
[36:25] unless it is according to the Word of
[36:27] God in this day amen it will always go
[36:31] in vain
[36:32] that's what Jesus said in vain do they
[36:35] worship me because it's the doctrine I
[36:39] mean it's the word amen
[36:42] so you see and then we move on and then
[36:45] and then and we're talking over the
[36:47] breakfast table this morning and you see
[36:49] just like there is a difference between
[36:52] accepting God as your personal Savior
[36:55] accepting him as your Lord amen but
[36:59] there is another side of it
[37:01] amen and we must be accepted by him and
[37:07] our fate can only be accepted ayman to
[37:13] the Holy Ghost amen because that is
[37:16] God's provided way and so he and this is
[37:20] the only this is the way this is the way
[37:22] to approach him we must go amen to
[37:25] justification sanctification and baptism
[37:28] of the holy ghost this is the only way
[37:30] amen and so what do you expect amen from
[37:36] an organization it's no way to be
[37:40] justified and we do not claim exclusive
[37:46] salvation there are many there are many
[37:48] means to be to be saved
[37:51] amen you know there are people behind
[37:53] him said there are people who do good
[37:55] things to the bride and you know in the
[37:58] end eventually they may be able to
[38:00] receive benefits from it and they will
[38:02] be surprised amen so we do not witness
[38:06] but we're talking about the body change
[38:08] we're talking about the rapture here
[38:11] we're talking about sitting beside him
[38:13] in his throne and that's we are after
[38:18] hallelujah and so it only goes to the
[38:22] approach amen and in this approach God
[38:26] builds a standard that we should meet
[38:30] him amen and and you see the the message
[38:34] tells us that you know there is a
[38:37] certain condition that we must meet him
[38:41] and that's why we have the stature of a
[38:45] perfect man and I believe this is God's
[38:48] standard in this day even because these
[38:51] are all the potentials these are all the
[38:54] characteristics and and this is not our
[38:57] faith this is not our own temperance
[39:00] this is his nature amen that's why we
[39:04] are we are partakers were partakers of
[39:07] the divine nature amen and so to be able
[39:10] to meet God's standard Amen we must be
[39:13] able to sit on on his provided table the
[39:18] provided food in this day and we must
[39:20] partake amen and so that's why I see by
[39:24] partaking of his word we are partaking
[39:27] of this nature we're partaking of his
[39:30] divine nature
[39:31] amen we are we by His grace he's
[39:35] building up his own characteristics in
[39:38] us him building himself amen
[39:42] so that even he may be able to to mirror
[39:44] himself through our nature to
[39:46] characteristics through our lives that
[39:49] we will be able to manifest not our
[39:52] lives not our organization and not our
[39:54] church life but his life payment will be
[39:58] must be displayed in this declaration
[40:00] that we are living in and we can only do
[40:03] that by partaking on his word because
[40:05] whatever we eat amen it becomes amen it
[40:10] becomes us amen and when we partake of
[40:13] this word we become the word hallelujah
[40:16] that we can he can see himself in us him
[40:21] and he can see himself in as he can he
[40:23] can mold us and at times all these
[40:26] characteristics you know can can only
[40:27] come you know by trials and persecutions
[40:32] and testings and you know temptations
[40:36] that we that we overcome hallelujah amen
[40:40] and so I remember job one said you know
[40:45] let me call it he said for I know he
[40:49] know the way that I take even God knows
[40:53] everything in us Amen in all the trials
[40:57] you know that God that comes along with
[40:59] it God knows everything and then you
[41:01] know God is the author and finisher of
[41:04] our faith he's the beginning and the
[41:07] ending is the Alpha and the Omega
[41:09] amen so that's why because he's the
[41:12] beginning at the end he shows us the
[41:14] beginning he shows us the end but the
[41:19] same thing he does not show us in
[41:21] between that's why people are you know
[41:26] people sometimes are surprised why these
[41:29] things are happening to me I'm a
[41:31] believer I'm standing for the truth how
[41:33] come these things are coming in amen I
[41:37] never expected it you know that
[41:39] statement is not new to all of us I
[41:41] never expected it
[41:43] because of the hardships that were going
[41:45] through because of the trials that were
[41:47] going through Amen parents the trails
[41:50] that they're going through with their
[41:51] children you know and sometimes the
[41:54] other way around you know and and
[41:55] pastors you know you know all these
[41:57] things we come through things that we
[42:00] never expected amen but but by God's
[42:04] grace because we knew Amen we knew where
[42:07] we come from and we know where we are
[42:09] heading for a man we've got the kind of
[42:12] revelation hallelujah so when when God
[42:15] when God sent Moses to Israel amen
[42:18] they were they knew the promise Joseph
[42:23] died believing that there is a deliverer
[42:27] that must come and he said when he comes
[42:30] dig my bones amen and bring it to the
[42:34] promised land
[42:34] so he died believing amen from the
[42:38] beginning of his life when he when he
[42:40] began to understood and to understand
[42:42] God's Word and when he was expecting for
[42:45] a deliverer amen and he never fade from
[42:49] that kind of condition so he died
[42:51] believing amen and so because he died
[42:57] believing God fulfilled his word because
[43:00] he heard the cry of his people and and
[43:02] he sent he said he sent a prophet you
[43:05] know and then and they were expecting
[43:07] you know you're living in a place in the
[43:09] land
[43:10] you know filled with milk and honey
[43:14] everything was good
[43:16] amen but he never showed they're going
[43:19] to pass through the wilderness never
[43:23] they never had any idea that they have
[43:26] to cross the Red Sea
[43:29] amen they had to pass through Kadesh
[43:31] Barnea amen
[43:34] they suffered a lot because God told
[43:38] them the beginning and the end amen
[43:42] and so this is our greatest comfort that
[43:46] whenever wherever we are whatever
[43:49] condition we have we know amen and so
[43:53] with these things any problem that
[43:57] comes away any struggle that comes our
[43:59] way we know how to approach it
[44:02] amen and we say things you know that's
[44:05] why the words are becoming a reality to
[44:10] us all things work together for good
[44:13] amen to them that love God so all these
[44:15] things you know God has a standard that
[44:18] we should meet him and when when Jesus
[44:20] said you know be perfect even as your
[44:27] father in heaven is perfect
[44:30] amen of course we understand that it's
[44:34] not our own perfection it's his
[44:35] perfection him and just like when Moses
[44:38] was standing in that holy ground it was
[44:40] God who said you know he that identified
[44:44] that that place was a holy place he was
[44:47] standing on a whole he was standing on a
[44:49] holy ground but it's the same mountain
[44:51] all throughout amen
[44:53] but what change the condition was the
[44:56] presence of God amen and and and so
[44:59] Moses because of the presence of God he
[45:02] had to approach him Amen he had to
[45:05] approach it because there is the
[45:07] presence of the Lord so you see in the
[45:09] message watered from the rap he said if
[45:11] you just know the right approach to it
[45:13] you could walk right up and receive it
[45:16] just like that that's all because it got
[45:19] promised anything and you don't receive
[45:21] it there's something wrong amen
[45:26] so if we're so sure that God promised us
[45:30] something amen
[45:35] God is able to to do it Amen we just
[45:41] have to approach it in the right way
[45:43] and-and-and-and you see it gives us a
[45:46] signal brother Branham said there's just
[45:48] something wrong I mean what's wrong with
[45:51] it
[45:52] Amen so let me just read you a scripture
[45:54] here on on the approach and see in the
[46:02] scripture in Luke 22 verse 63
[46:09] men that held Jesus mocked him and smote
[46:15] him and Wendy they had Blount folded him
[46:19] they struck him on the face and asked
[46:22] him saying prophesy who is it that smote
[46:27] thee and many other things blasphemously
[46:31] speak they against him amen now listen
[46:37] they were asking him prophesy no all of
[46:42] us believe tonight that he can prophesy
[46:47] because he is the word an entire seuss
[46:52] man who smote thee he knew them although
[46:57] he was blindfolded a man and they said
[47:00] show us tell us and we shall believe
[47:06] what a challenge amen
[47:09] and what a challenge amen to the gift
[47:13] what the challenge and he was the word
[47:17] but they did not receive what they were
[47:22] asking for what's the reason the
[47:29] approach amen they approached him the
[47:33] blind the blindfolded him they mocked
[47:36] him smote him and when they had
[47:38] blindfolded him they struck him in the
[47:40] face and asked him saying prophesy who
[47:44] is it that smote day he knew every one
[47:47] of them he knew the numbers the number
[47:51] of their hair well madam said you know
[47:53] we're serving a God who knows how many
[47:56] mosquitoes there are not only in Georgia
[48:01] but in the whole world
[48:03] amen and not only that brother madam
[48:06] said he also know how many times these
[48:10] mosquitoes but their eyes and then just
[48:15] few soldiers who insulted him map him
[48:18] smote him you know the blindfold could
[48:22] not do any
[48:23] thing to do you know to know who they
[48:25] are even knew what they were thinking
[48:29] about him
[48:31] so they approached him and he had
[48:35] everything they were asking for but they
[48:41] approached him in the wrong way
[48:43] they approached him in the wrong manner
[48:45] there is something wrong
[48:49] hallelujah and so that's why the prophet
[48:51] of God said in everything that you do in
[48:53] everything that you say in everything
[48:55] that we think we should always check our
[48:57] motives amen we you know we preach the
[49:01] gospel amen we should have the right
[49:03] motive amen we go to far-flung areas
[49:08] amen we only have one motive and that is
[49:11] to bring souls at the feet of Jesus
[49:13] Christ amen we were not building any
[49:17] Kingdom whatsoever except the building
[49:20] the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:21] amen
[49:22] and so we're not promoting any man we're
[49:26] not even promoting brother Branham got
[49:28] promoted him hallelujah in that
[49:30] condition and so you see this man they
[49:35] and to think we will believe you amen
[49:40] so you see God wasn't Jesus was not
[49:43] after whether they believed or not amen
[49:48] and you see God you know he did not
[49:53] squander the gift amen and they never
[50:01] got anything they were asking for
[50:04] because of the wrong approach that they
[50:06] had amen and you see this is different
[50:10] when also in the book and the Book of
[50:14] Luke in chapter 8 and this very much
[50:16] familiar with that when when a woman
[50:18] approached him and you know there were
[50:20] many people crowding on the Lord Jesus
[50:24] and you know he was she was so sick she
[50:28] was so weak and there was no strength in
[50:31] her body that that was left
[50:34] amen and so we know she crawled between
[50:37] those legs she approached him
[50:42] she never shouted because she had not
[50:45] enough strength to shout amen
[50:49] she didn't even have enough strength to
[50:52] stand up but she was crawling on her
[50:58] knees amen and we did with her last
[51:01] range she just extended their hand and
[51:04] just touched the hem of the Lord scarlet
[51:07] Amon and that Amon pulled some power
[51:14] amen
[51:15] she got it because of a right approach
[51:21] amen and Jesus felt it who touched me
[51:28] amen
[51:29] and some know there are many people who
[51:31] were touching you you know why should
[51:33] you ask that's you amen no amen somebody
[51:37] approached me somebody touch me right
[51:40] Amen hallelujah and so in in the message
[51:46] resurrection of Lazarus in in Bell
[51:49] Bonhams prayer said our Heavenly Father
[51:51] now we've come together this afternoon
[51:53] for one purpose to speak up Dee and to
[51:56] love thee and we all love you and we've
[51:58] come facing this today knowing that
[52:01] today maybe someone may steal their
[52:04] eternal destination from the service
[52:06] today
[52:07] the attitude towards the world so it's
[52:13] very important
[52:15] amen and we're so glad that the Lord
[52:18] Himself who chose us to approach him
[52:25] that's why we don't expect all people to
[52:28] have the same approach Amen this word
[52:32] will be available to them this message
[52:34] will be available to everybody but it is
[52:39] different reaction amen
[52:43] but thank God for the grace of the Lord
[52:47] amen
[52:48] that we were able why because of his own
[52:51] juicer amen and I believe that's the
[52:55] word Amen blessed is the man whom thou
[53:00] chooses to approach me so he chose a
[53:05] place and he chose people to approach
[53:08] him I'm just glad to be part of it I'm
[53:14] just glad to be a man and and and saying
[53:18] God revealing himself he said the right
[53:21] mental attitude towards any promise of
[53:24] God will bring it to pass right mental
[53:35] attitude but what more if our hearts are
[53:39] right amen and he said it's the way you
[53:42] come that's what it will that's it what
[53:47] it will happen just the attitude you
[53:50] take towards wonderful amen
[54:04] another statement he said now you
[54:08] remember this zero Phoenician woman
[54:11] right we're so familiar with that he
[54:13] said now this woman this zero Phoenician
[54:15] woman she believed also she said Lord
[54:18] first she said thou son of David a
[54:21] Gentile has no hold on Christ by the son
[54:25] of David he had the wrong dog she had
[54:29] the wrong dog him to start with but we
[54:31] believe that he is the son of David but
[54:34] that was not 2000 years ago
[54:37] amen so she approached him she called
[54:42] him son of David and because she she
[54:47] called her with the wrong name Amen
[54:50] and he said a Gentile had no hold on
[54:53] Christ by the son of David that was true
[54:55] King David the race of Jews he never
[54:57] paid any attention to her but when she
[55:01] turned
[55:01] said lord help me approaching him as we
[55:10] are in needy people that got him he was
[55:15] her Lord not his son of David but he was
[55:19] her Lord and said Lord help me and that
[55:21] caught him he turned around and said
[55:24] it's true the dogs eat the scraps from
[55:28] the master's table that is true look
[55:30] what the woman had the right approach to
[55:32] God skip what did she say he said she
[55:36] approached it right amen and he never
[55:40] said oh that's too much I called you son
[55:44] a baby they called you Lord and now you
[55:45] tell me I'm a dog amen but she said that
[55:53] is true amen because there's not nothing
[55:58] wrong with the word of Jesus Christ
[56:01] because he is the word he's not going to
[56:05] tell a lie amen
[56:07] they said that's true she recognized
[56:10] that the word that he said was true
[56:14] and he said now he disgraced her he said
[56:17] I'm not sent to you your dogs in your
[56:20] generation your races are nothing but
[56:23] dogs I am NOT sent to you and she said
[56:25] it's truth Lord there's the word Amen
[56:28] stay with the word faith will always
[56:30] recognize the world but the dogs eat the
[56:33] crumbs under the master's table that got
[56:36] him Lord helped me he turned and he said
[56:38] for this saying o woman great is your
[56:40] faith and port is saying that that will
[56:42] slap your daughter what she got what she
[56:45] approached the gear she approached God
[56:48] skipped in the right way you've got to
[56:52] approach and remember that was the first
[56:54] Gentile that ever had a miracle
[56:57] performed on them by the son of David
[57:01] remember that was the first miracle
[57:03] performed to a Gentile that's right this
[57:06] healing of the zero Phoenician woman
[57:08] that she had the right approach to God's
[57:10] gift faith in the midst of the
[57:13] is Right Reverend humble amen
[57:17] so humility always attracts God because
[57:22] it's always the right approach amen
[57:26] now he how much more the bride amen and
[57:32] you know just like in the home you know
[57:36] when the the wife knows how to approach
[57:40] her bridegroom amen
[57:44] and you know what you know what I mean
[57:48] husband and wife you know and then and
[57:50] you see at times we go extra mile that
[57:54] that's just like the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:56] amen
[57:57] he came even not work he came for the
[58:00] lost sheep of Israel and that woman was
[58:04] not even a Jew he was a Gentile but
[58:10] because of her attitude Jesus being
[58:14] absolute he had to go extra mile and he
[58:19] had he had to extend his hand beyond
[58:23] beyond the border amen beyond what he
[58:27] had what he was supposed to do and who
[58:32] can question him amen nobody can
[58:35] question him but because he was so
[58:38] caught by the kind of attitude a man she
[58:41] extended her hand and and grace was
[58:45] being extended to that woman because of
[58:48] her attitude hallelujah and and so it's
[58:53] the same thing with their with us amen
[58:56] so that's why you know in this day and
[58:57] age in this generation
[58:59] I mean God has prepared us amen
[59:03] something that that we will be humble
[59:06] enough to be able to approach the gift
[59:09] that God has made available in this
[59:15] generation that we are living in amen so
[59:20] let me continue and said now now of
[59:25] course we know if even in the order of
[59:27] servus we know how to approach God you
[59:29] know and so we approached him by our
[59:30] means of worship and you know that's
[59:34] what before we brother bantam said
[59:35] before they go to battle it is
[59:37] scriptural you know you have the
[59:39] musicians and you have the the army
[59:41] behind a mint so you have you have the
[59:44] the music you have the word and then the
[59:47] battle
[59:48] amen so we always approach him in that
[59:51] way now in the Old Testament being a
[59:53] type of the new and the works of the
[59:54] inward course of the Tabernacle was a
[59:56] beautiful picture of God's plan of
[59:58] salvation for his mankind today and if
[1:00:00] we can only learn by this now and how to
[1:00:03] get ourselves in the condition to
[1:00:04] receive what God has in store for us it
[1:00:08] will just sweep the whole valley here
[1:00:10] but don't you think it's better to
[1:00:12] always know how and what you're coming
[1:00:14] for you got to know the way up approach
[1:00:16] to anything he said I prayed for kings
[1:00:20] in my day and I noticed how they taken
[1:00:22] the cups out of my trouser legs and when
[1:00:24] I walk before the King and they told me
[1:00:26] not to turn my back on him but when I
[1:00:28] left to back up and it's a certain way
[1:00:30] of reproach otherwise should be called
[1:00:33] down I mean you got to come a provided
[1:00:36] way a man is your person your honor and
[1:00:40] everything and we must meet God upon his
[1:00:43] appropriated provided plan of how we
[1:00:46] must approach him and if we could only
[1:00:49] approach him through that plan and get
[1:00:52] it right we're sure to get an audience
[1:00:54] with God amen
[1:00:57] people at times fail to receive result
[1:01:03] because of their attitude in getting
[1:01:07] attention from the Lord amen but you
[1:01:09] know but the Prophet said if only every
[1:01:12] one of us will be able to to find out
[1:01:16] and of course you know and then he said
[1:01:19] we will be able to get an audience with
[1:01:21] God amen he said now he said in the now
[1:01:30] we watch what was in the outer Court
[1:01:32] then there was the holy place or the
[1:01:34] first bill and then inside the holiest
[1:01:35] of holies and what furniture was in the
[1:01:38] outer court what was at the way
[1:01:40] the holy place and what was in the
[1:01:41] holiest of holies now he said Amen the
[1:01:45] dwelling place where God Himself dwell
[1:01:48] in them days he dwelt in his tabernacle
[1:01:51] and today he dwells in you as his
[1:01:54] tabernacle but we must make this place a
[1:01:58] dwelling not an outer Court place or the
[1:02:04] first holy place but we must live with
[1:02:07] God in the holiest of holies is
[1:02:09] consecrated hidden life alone quiet with
[1:02:13] God amen and so just like you know
[1:02:16] always most of the time I take that
[1:02:21] illustration of brother Branham that
[1:02:23] this dwelling place this home you know
[1:02:25] this is a three room house amen and you
[1:02:28] know we have the we have of course in a
[1:02:32] three room house you said brother
[1:02:33] Branham no matter how big your house is
[1:02:35] it's only divided into three a many pew
[1:02:38] have you even if you have a dozen room
[1:02:41] you know you have no matter how big your
[1:02:43] Lobby is amen so it's only divided into
[1:02:48] three you have the living room we have
[1:02:50] the kitchen you have the living room and
[1:02:52] you have the bedroom amen and brother
[1:02:55] Branham said we don't only approach him
[1:02:58] in the outer court amen and and and said
[1:03:04] it's it's just like the kitchen you know
[1:03:06] just like you know when we when we
[1:03:08] approach our friends our brethren our
[1:03:11] new frame and we meet our new friends
[1:03:13] amen
[1:03:14] and the person approach is let's eat
[1:03:19] amen go let's eat all right so that's
[1:03:23] that's the that's the outer court amen
[1:03:26] we go to the kitchen we eat amen and but
[1:03:31] we don't stop just in eating amen
[1:03:35] and so that's the same thing when we
[1:03:37] serve God when we have the home church
[1:03:40] we go to church and this is God's
[1:03:43] kitchen amen the preacher just provide
[1:03:46] the pooled amen that God has prepared a
[1:03:49] man we're just serving you the word amen
[1:03:52] it's it were just in the kitchen amen
[1:03:55] but you see there people they sometimes
[1:03:57] you know they go to church they listen
[1:03:59] but they don't have so much attachment
[1:04:01] with the people and then they just in
[1:04:05] the outer court or we come there we
[1:04:07] listen there's nothing wrong with it
[1:04:09] amen but you see if we are a part of the
[1:04:11] home church if were part of the local
[1:04:13] congregation amen
[1:04:15] we don't just we thought we just don't
[1:04:17] leave after after eating amen but we
[1:04:20] still have just like dinner brother
[1:04:22] branham you stay a little bit and you
[1:04:24] sit down in the living room and then you
[1:04:26] talk about things you plan a man you
[1:04:29] become identified admitted there our
[1:04:32] relationship becomes so mutual and then
[1:04:34] and so and so that's why you know all
[1:04:37] these things and then because your
[1:04:39] church as part become your your pastor
[1:04:42] has become so mission mission minded you
[1:04:45] know and IIIi was so touched when when
[1:04:51] brother Sam told me this you know well
[1:04:52] well you know we're talking about these
[1:04:54] things and we're just down there and the
[1:04:56] Lord has blessed you that your neighbor
[1:04:58] gave you that that that portion of the
[1:05:01] property and it's God's blessing amen
[1:05:04] you know not everybody can get that kind
[1:05:07] of privilege I'm especially here in
[1:05:09] America you know of course not even in
[1:05:11] the Philippines there's nothing that is
[1:05:13] free now amen but you see God has
[1:05:15] blessed you with something and you can
[1:05:17] see we can always recognize God's
[1:05:19] goodness even in little things why
[1:05:22] because you have the right approach and
[1:05:25] so God has given you something you're
[1:05:27] not expecting amen and and in the
[1:05:31] process of our conversation you know and
[1:05:33] he said you know we we can build a
[1:05:36] better church better than what we have
[1:05:39] right now but what for
[1:05:42] amen and you know although we are we
[1:05:48] have the privilege you have the
[1:05:50] privilege to do that you don't do it
[1:05:52] because but as I'm said in that way we
[1:05:57] can do more in the mission field out
[1:06:00] there
[1:06:01] amen why because we're not just after
[1:06:07] the kitchen food amen but because of the
[1:06:10] food that we are eating B it becomes
[1:06:14] part of it part of us and so you're
[1:06:17] looking for something and so you can
[1:06:20] plan you can you can do something and so
[1:06:22] I believe I mean that the heart of the
[1:06:25] pastor becomes the heart of this
[1:06:27] congregation - amen and you know you can
[1:06:31] only know the heart of your pastor and
[1:06:33] then of course the way he preached but
[1:06:36] you know when you become identified with
[1:06:38] each other
[1:06:39] Amen when you when we become one in
[1:06:42] heart we become one in vision we have
[1:06:45] one in plans and everything and we learn
[1:06:48] that by sitting down we learned that by
[1:06:50] talking about things amen and where does
[1:06:54] it happen but Abraham said not only in
[1:06:56] the kitchen but when you stay a little
[1:06:58] bit amen but of course we know Amen that
[1:07:04] the third room is where the result
[1:07:06] happens amen so it's not it's not on the
[1:07:11] kernel principles but we believe Amen
[1:07:14] that that that in the bedroom is where
[1:07:16] something takes place amen and so
[1:07:21] brother madam said now we approach him
[1:07:23] of course he is the word all right
[1:07:27] we listen to the word we partake of the
[1:07:29] word Amen but the world that we partake
[1:07:31] a man should put us into something where
[1:07:35] we will be identified with him and we
[1:07:39] are so much identified with the end and
[1:07:41] will become one with him and when we
[1:07:44] have union with him we receive more
[1:07:46] sense in him
[1:07:47] and that will bring result hallelujah
[1:07:50] and because we approach him not just
[1:07:53] because we want to pay their souls
[1:07:56] Amen with things and you know there are
[1:07:58] many people because they want to be fed
[1:08:00] by the preaching of the word which is
[1:08:02] which I said there's nothing bad with it
[1:08:04] but because they they do not stay so
[1:08:08] long
[1:08:10] amen they could make it they cannot go
[1:08:13] a deeper relationship only the kitchen
[1:08:18] relationship it's just the outer court
[1:08:21] but madam says don't just meet him don't
[1:08:23] just approach him in the outer court
[1:08:25] meaning don't just feed yourself with
[1:08:28] the word although it's good but you
[1:08:30] don't have to stop there because when we
[1:08:34] were just after the word Amen it will
[1:08:37] just stay in our minds amen and it will
[1:08:41] only make our heads big and this is the
[1:08:45] problem at times you know even even
[1:08:47] ministers you know they they're so fed
[1:08:51] with the information of this message
[1:08:56] amen and yet concern does not follow
[1:09:00] after their ministries and they don't
[1:09:02] care about souls and they just care
[1:09:05] about the things that they know a man
[1:09:08] they just so after the information and
[1:09:12] so you see bourbon said no just is it
[1:09:14] and today he dwells in you as his
[1:09:16] tabernacle but we must make this place a
[1:09:18] dwelling not outer court only amen
[1:09:22] not living room only amen
[1:09:26] but approach him Amen up to that inner
[1:09:31] Vail and he said but we must live with
[1:09:34] God in the Holy of Holies a consecrated
[1:09:37] hidden life alone amen
[1:09:41] alone so unless this message becomes
[1:09:44] personal now in the kitchen there are
[1:09:51] many there you know we rejoice you know
[1:09:54] and then it's good you know to talk
[1:09:56] about the word and and all the stop you
[1:09:58] know many are rejoicing we always
[1:10:01] rejoice with the word because the word
[1:10:04] the revelation is what stimulates our
[1:10:06] faith amen
[1:10:10] we can rejoice every time because of the
[1:10:13] revelation amen
[1:10:14] but when we don't become part of it
[1:10:22] and then that's why what shall we do I
[1:10:25] mean there's always something that we
[1:10:27] have to do when we receive the
[1:10:29] revelation amen when when those about
[1:10:32] 3,000 souls in the book of Acts they got
[1:10:35] the revelation that Peter preached and
[1:10:38] then they said it's not just kitchen but
[1:10:40] they said what shall we do amen so when
[1:10:44] we caught something it put us into
[1:10:46] action I mean that's the same thing when
[1:10:50] when I say you know I believe in Isaiah
[1:10:53] chapter 6
[1:10:54] all right and and so God called I said
[1:10:58] to be up to be a prophet even Isaiah was
[1:11:01] called to be a prophet not to be a king
[1:11:04] but Isaiah was looking after a king he
[1:11:08] was so he was so caught up amen
[1:11:12] about this young king that that he saw
[1:11:17] and then happen to be his close friend
[1:11:19] brother Branham say that and he received
[1:11:21] so much attention also and privileges
[1:11:24] because the king was his friend close
[1:11:28] friend amen
[1:11:29] but you know God knows how to get our
[1:11:32] attention and and you know he for us to
[1:11:36] be able to to approach him in the right
[1:11:39] way and so when when the King died a man
[1:11:43] who was he was looking for a king but
[1:11:46] the earthly King amen
[1:11:48] but when when he came when he was down
[1:11:51] because he was so affected by the death
[1:11:53] of the king who was his friend amen and
[1:11:56] now the first thing that he did he
[1:11:59] approached the temple Amon so and then
[1:12:03] he approached and him when he went to
[1:12:04] the temple a man he saw a man not only a
[1:12:07] man know so God amen
[1:12:09] Cody Amen God allowed that thing to
[1:12:12] happen so that you know Isaiah will
[1:12:16] change his vision from an earthly king
[1:12:19] he can look up and he saw the heavenly
[1:12:23] king even and so you see but the Menem
[1:12:26] said identified that those you know
[1:12:30] angels that he saw Amen you know there
[1:12:34] are three pairs
[1:12:36] wings and he's an any priests on that on
[1:12:39] the message influence and he said the
[1:12:41] the pair covered their faces a Mende the
[1:12:44] other pair covered their knees and then
[1:12:46] the other pair amen it continued to to
[1:12:49] flappin and he said they covered their
[1:12:52] face because it is it represents respect
[1:12:56] and then the cover Denise and it was a
[1:13:01] man a sense of humility and then it was
[1:13:05] a continuous action prapannam said and
[1:13:08] then putting them together by the madam
[1:13:10] said it was respect and humility in
[1:13:13] action and that's the way to approach
[1:13:16] God and you know I say uh so it and then
[1:13:21] when he saw it
[1:13:22] Amen now something happened to I saya
[1:13:27] that when he did it he also caught the
[1:13:30] attention of God and he said and and I
[1:13:33] saw I said Lord Amen I am a man of
[1:13:36] unclean lips and I'm living in the midst
[1:13:39] of people who are also unclean so
[1:13:42] suddenly he realized who he was he
[1:13:46] suddenly realized he needed God and he
[1:13:49] suddenly didn't realize he knew he had
[1:13:52] to humble himself he had to confess amen
[1:13:56] and so that's why I'm John in Isaiah
[1:13:58] chapter six you know it has three parts
[1:14:00] and and you see the first part amen
[1:14:03] it was you know he he recognized he one
[1:14:07] who he was Amen and he made the
[1:14:09] confession amen and then later on
[1:14:13] because of that confession confession
[1:14:15] Amen he was forgiven and then what
[1:14:20] follows after that was the greatest
[1:14:22] Commission
[1:14:23] amen and said Lord Here I am send me so
[1:14:31] everything so that's why you see how do
[1:14:34] we approach God
[1:14:35] of course we approach him with all
[1:14:37] manners of humility just like what this
[1:14:40] this women have shown that's why you
[1:14:42] have you you will see seldom in the
[1:14:46] Bible brother Branham said seldom in the
[1:14:47] Bible you see we
[1:14:49] our woman's name are being written you
[1:14:52] know but they're women because they have
[1:14:55] special participation they have you know
[1:14:58] they have special attention being given
[1:15:04] by God to them because of the display of
[1:15:07] their characteristics
[1:15:09] hallelujah they were able to approach
[1:15:12] his glory they were able to approach
[1:15:14] amen and then and you know we find lots
[1:15:18] of women like even Queen Esther how she
[1:15:21] approached the king amen and there were
[1:15:26] many women more beautiful probably than
[1:15:29] Esther but she caught the attention of
[1:15:34] the king amen and the good thing there
[1:15:38] amen Esther had Mordecai who instructed
[1:15:43] her how to approach the King the way she
[1:15:48] should conduct herself the way she must
[1:15:50] approach the king and it was because
[1:15:54] there's a Mordecai amen
[1:15:57] so it's the same manner that we have
[1:16:01] right now we have our Mordecai in this
[1:16:04] generation who dress up the bride a man
[1:16:07] who gives instruction to the bride so
[1:16:10] that we will be able to approach our
[1:16:13] King in this generation amen
[1:16:17] so we always glorify God for His
[1:16:20] goodness and it's it's always earns good
[1:16:25] result when we continue to humble
[1:16:28] ourselves before as a bride you know we
[1:16:31] all have the reasons to be that was that
[1:16:36] to be proud you know the Prophet had all
[1:16:41] the reason amen and I remember you know
[1:16:44] brother Branham was you know in front of
[1:16:46] these two these buildings you know being
[1:16:51] built by his contemporaries at that time
[1:16:53] and you know being human he said Lord
[1:16:56] maybe you know you
[1:16:58] you cannot trust me with all these
[1:16:59] things because I'm an educated of some
[1:17:02] sort and everything but I'm happy with
[1:17:05] this what what what you have done to
[1:17:06] these people although they although they
[1:17:09] admit that they have you know caught
[1:17:12] something they got the inspiration from
[1:17:14] the little little ministry that you have
[1:17:16] given me but look what they've got now
[1:17:19] amen
[1:17:20] when she with that humble heart there
[1:17:23] was a voice she said as clear as you
[1:17:25] hear my voice he said but I am your
[1:17:28] Portia and what can be greater than that
[1:17:34] when God becomes our portion we may not
[1:17:39] have everything that others have amen
[1:17:43] but even then we can still approach him
[1:17:45] a man with the right attitude and I
[1:17:48] believe those those attitudes are always
[1:17:51] produced amen
[1:17:54] by the things that we get from the
[1:17:58] message because the words that I speak
[1:18:00] unto you
[1:18:00] their spirits and they are amen so this
[1:18:06] message being received in the head it
[1:18:11] will make our head big amen
[1:18:14] but when this message is being received
[1:18:16] by our hearts and say then that is
[1:18:20] that's the hidden life and I'm glad
[1:18:23] tonight I'm glad tonight we have this
[1:18:26] message that came in to the hearts of a
[1:18:29] prophet who was a real humble man a man
[1:18:34] and and God helped us you know to be
[1:18:39] like the Lord Jesus Christ and to be
[1:18:41] like amen his word amen so may the Lord
[1:18:45] adds his blessing amen to the little
[1:18:50] portion that I have tonight amen and may
[1:18:53] we continue to approach him all the time
[1:18:57] amen not just on the outer court not
[1:19:00] just on the living room amen but inside
[1:19:03] the room he said that he didn't like
[1:19:05] well where he becomes so personal to us
[1:19:08] Amen unless we walk with him personally
[1:19:11] amen so we don't we just don't worship
[1:19:14] him by group by Church but we approach
[1:19:18] him and it's it's some kind of a hidden
[1:19:20] life that only you and him
[1:19:23] hallelujah can you recognize him and he
[1:19:27] can recognize you we accepted him and we
[1:19:31] are being accepted hallelujah
[1:19:34] so do we see the two different
[1:19:36] approaches
[1:19:38] Amen those men amen the Lord had what
[1:19:43] they were asking for but they approached
[1:19:46] him with the wrong approach and they did
[1:19:50] not receive it but this women amen they
[1:19:54] approached the Lord Jesus Christ with
[1:19:58] the right approach with the right manner
[1:19:59] with the right attitude and they receive
[1:20:02] and I believe whatever we're asking for
[1:20:05] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:20:08] the spirit of humility and respect and
[1:20:10] we put our faith into action it will
[1:20:13] earn good result and it will give him
[1:20:16] glory amen god bless you and just
[1:20:19] continue on praying for us amen and if
[1:20:24] the Lord tarries Amen we will keep on
[1:20:27] pressing on until that last
[1:20:29] predestinated seed amen we'll come into
[1:20:33] the fall bless you brother Sam amen and
[1:20:37] all the rest of the believers here in
[1:20:39] Lulla Georgia yeah we will keep also all
[1:20:48] of you in our prayers I mean as I turn
[1:20:51] the microphone to brother Samuel god
