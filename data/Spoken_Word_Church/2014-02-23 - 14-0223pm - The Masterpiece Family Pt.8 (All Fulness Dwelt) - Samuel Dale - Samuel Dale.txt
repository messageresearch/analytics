========================================

we all need you my lord won't you come on by we all need you my lord won't you come on by we all need you my lord won't you come on lord open the eyes of my heart oh dining in the light of your glory amen is that your desire for him to do that today amen and amen and amen and amen all right that's what we want to do in it good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to colossians 1 and it'll be right on over colossians 1 colossians 2. remember that colossians 1 and colossians 2. remember the bible study will be this coming saturday six o'clock come and be with us and just have a good time kind of hear what we do eat popcorn sit around talk about the lord it's kind of an informal uh time but we do it once a month and have a good time remember also the fellowship meeting will be the third saturday of march it will be at brother longorus then the fellowship meeting as far as we know now will be here in may so remember those announcements uh also brother uh vernon from the philippines will be with us the lord willing on the he's coming down on the 14th and be with us going to the fellowship meeting and fellowshipping a few days and then he will be preaching for us here on march the 16th so remember that brother vernon's wonderful brother looking forward to the time um the offering was 400 and what 450 was 450 we appreciate that we'll put some more with it and then we will send it to brother dwight hall he lost his whole uh the church and everything got washed out in a a flooded area and he didn't have any insurance to replace it because of the water area where he was at so he lost everything on it lost a vehicle lost a lot of other things so you know just pray for him that the lord would would bless him and we'll send him a little offering to try to help him you know get him a place where they can do something you know but remember that also brother bob black will be preaching for us the lord willing this coming wednesday so remember him he said he had a busy day on wednesday it might be a little late i said okay we'll wait but not after 12. we'll wait on you but not after 12. okay but uh i reckon that's all the announcements anything else i generally miss a few somewhere down the road but colossians one and then colossians 2. the lord jesus we thank you for your grace and your love and to us we we know for surety that you give it to us freely because there's nothing in any of us that would be worthy of it not any special people as we tried to explain this morning there's nothing no different about us than anyone that's ever been but we are just the people that believe that your promise for this day is here being made manifest among us and we believe you and we love you and we thank you we pray that you'd bless all the people that are sick because you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe your promises and we know for surety that you say your promises are yea and amen so how much more could it be that we would believe them we love you father and we thank you and just have you away with each one of us and keep us in thy grace and love in jesus name amen romans excuse me colossians one we'll just start with verse 15 because that's we know who is coming down talking about the the the kingdom the translating into the kingdom of his dear son and then we go down to verse 15 who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things watch now and by him all things consist in other words there's nothing because in hebrews he's the creator john he's the creator of ephesians he's the creator nothing is created without him doing it because he's the creator and whatever we are he created us and he is the head of the body the church which is to be getting the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell now just drop over the next page and you'll notice we start with verse 2 and verse 9. for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and you are complete in him the verse 10 which is the head of all principality and power you may be seated lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now remember this morning trying to get a point to us and as we start reading on these things in a minute and referencing to the end time just remember that we are trying our best to express one thought and that one thought is the fact that there is no different in each church age it's been the same god now there is a difference in maybe manifestation uh different things we will try to cover some things later on it because there are dispensations of this and dispensations of that you know in the bible and uh but yet remember that we're talking about it so when we come down to reading and we're talking about the fullness of the godhead bodily remember that the is in the entire body of christ now not just speaking of the end time it is the end time people who will make that manifest are you following me somebody's got to make it manifest jesus christ was almighty god right he made manifest the word and things of his time all right now he's left it for you and i to make it manifest and each church age made manifest what was in that age but they couldn't one make manifest the other age see backwards before but it's the same god so then when you talk about the fullness of the godhead bodily never have i pointed to solely the end of all things as us being the fullness and the rest of not you know that when you try to drive things down people will get the wrong idea about what you're trying to say and you know make you say something that you're not because uh as we'll read in a minute and you've i've read it before a prophet said he's not complete without you right well we're not complete without all the ages to hold us up that's right and we definitely went through the the uh uh carriers were in their place and doing what they needed to do but then we're in the age when it's not called carriers it's called the seed all right because it returns to the original jesus christ was not a carrier right he was the seed well see then that's what's left for the end time to be is the seed of god made manifest the word of god to finish it all up all right see then that way we can we can follow that point but remember that i put it on this morning put it on here i'll put it on the next two or three services because i want you to think about it oh you that use your internet a lot to study the message i only chose just a few but i wish you would run in uh you know the quote that is a favorite part a lot of times that we say that all god was he poured into christ all christ poured into the you know all god poured into christ all christ in the church and take her back to the garden of eden all right i wish you'd run that in just run it into your computer just read the things we will read some of it and then you know be uh moving on so just think about it now because we read the scriptures and we know and we talked about this morning as a background to where that we would think about what speaks of the bridegroom speaks of the bride all right you say well i just can't find myself we'll read about him and see what he's doing because it's him doing it justification was not martin luther right it was god revealing himself in that day and that hour for the word of that hour all right now so is it whatever ages so is it throughout the old testament and coming down see that everything is very vital to not just come down to making us special something the bride of jesus christ is the special something the entire bride all right see then we have dispensations of this and thoughts and ideas that we'll get back to but we we covered that this morning that the what spoke of the bridegroom spoke of the bride and how that she would she is smitten from the church and how that that is the way that he is on the outside of the church knocking at the door trying to get back in is because he has been driven out of the church the people the real true bride of christ is smitten this day from the church of of denominationalism because of her stand on the word and the denominationalism then whether or not it be baptist methodist presbyterian pentecostals catholic or or brahmites you know or lulaites see whatever it is you know because he is smitten from the church he's rejected by the majority of the people in this last days right now they want him as healer they want him as savior but they don't want him as lord and god of all right all right let's see then that way if he can't be one all he can't be just one yet he can be over there healing the sick he can be doing but there'll come a time that'll stop and you know when it stops then uh you don't want to be just in that category the prophet then said what being in the wrong ranks at the rapture would be no excuse all right so then what is our purpose and what did we end up the other day talking about that the seed must do what it must lay in the presence of the sun to ripen what if no what if it had been that when the prophet was here that even while he was here or shortly after he was gone that this was all finished up well the basis of what i'm looking at today would not be around us you a few people would be but you know we would be not counted into this but he's given all of these years for us to lay in the presence of the sun i'm not um down-hearted because of of the time that has come you know and that we're way past what it looked like that it should have been and i'm not disheartened at that and i'm glad god spoke to me years ago i believe it and reveal it because it happened you know and i preached that we could pass the year 2026 which i say now we could pass a year 5 000 that wouldn't happen because once you entered what happened in 1977 then there is no limit to a time element it is not that it is into the opening of the word all right now but what i want us to do today is think about it and if we'll put everything into him then we can understand and we can still use our thought of what spoke of the bridegroom will speak of the bride because somebody has to make that manifest because the bridegroom is not here now you know what i mean by that right he's not physically here when he went away 2 000 years ago see he hasn't been back here physically since that time and we don't expect him to be here physically and brother branham said you know people that say they got oil on their hands and blood on their foreheads and all these different he said they're saying the corporal body is here and he says that's incorrect because it's not here see we meet him in the air all right he doesn't need to be here because he has a body so it would be contrary to scripture if he came physically to meet us here now it could be visions it could be dreams it can be uh all kinds of things happen and you say well what about brother branham when he was up at schoolhouse well just remember what he said and you'll still see he's right when he saw the lord jesus out in that field where he preached marriage and divorce you know in that schoolhouse and thing he said that was the very field that he saw him in back as a young man but remember he said he was standing up in the air you know he didn't say he was on earth he said he was standing up in the air all right so we meet the lord jesus physically all right then we're we are in the time and we have been since pentecost all right i keep emphasizing that we have been in the time that the body of jesus christ the bride church has been in his place upon the earth right and it's him making himself manifest in each age right the spirit was not eat away because the prophet preached a message there the spirit seven spirits of god he said it was the holy spirit never church age but the holy spirit can only work according to the amount of word the word was what was eaten away right all right and the word was what would have was to is now still being restored unto us all right and then that brings it down to a beautiful time see then now think about that as we talk about where we read that in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily well now if i can read you some quotes from the prophet that that fullness now dwells in the bride right the church the bride would you believe it me would you accept it that way or keep your ideas of like one brother said no quote it the way he said it he said you you say the bride is to be the fullness of the god he had bodily said hogwash yeah because he didn't believe it well no i don't care what he believed that's his business but now when a prophet says things why can't we believe it if we can't believe that what he said about us being the fullness of the godhead bodily then we can't believe about us being the people of god remember the emphasis i've always placed upon it is what 99 god one percent human because all we are is a vessel that the god dwells in i've made it so strong until maybe some people didn't understand me whether that i would make it so strong as saying that you are god by having the new birth you are deity is that the way he'd say it you are god made manifest in flesh called a son all right is that any problem is that the bible is that the prophet's message well then why can't we believe that then it would speak of the end time of things to take place why cannot we believe that we are the people see we are the ones that are keeping it from taking place so don't blame nobody else well if we could get brother dale straightened up we'd be ready to go well that might be true but remember you have to get yourself straight first too you know so work on yourself and i'll work on myself and god will work on all of us all right but see in him now dwells the fullness of the godhead bodily all right so the the godhead is what father son and holy ghost all right then we believe in one true and living god we don't believe in a god in three persons or things like that we believe in one true and living god and we believe that oh god was he poured that into christ all right now a quick explanation when the bible speaks of saying all god was he poured into christ does that do away with god and you only have a christ because if if that's the way you're going then the next quote you're going to have to deny totally that all christ would be in the church then you wouldn't now know christ but we know for surety that the church is christ made manifest we know that jesus was god made manifest in human flesh all right so we don't hold that point as oh brother now all means all well then you ain't got nothing left well then what about the prophet would say that there'll be a message of cheer down to the endless ages after we leave here so evidently all of god that there is is not revealed to mankind evidently you know or there wouldn't be anything left over that should be a sensible statement no need of clarification that it just simply means that what all that is needed here will be might manifest here to give you an understanding brother gary atkins and i used to talk about this a lot you know that really when jesus said all power is given unto me in heaven and earth you know that was after his resurrection it was after his resurrection he read your bible he said no he had it all the time well there was certain things there that would give you a little problem like him saying that he didn't know when he's coming you know so i'm i'm trying to make a point of how that we try to make our by our own concept of thoughts we try to make something in a line that we can look at it and that's well and good but sometimes it'll run your ground too you know i mean it'll just run you off and you have to believe what god says you know when he says you're perfect we want to spend all of our life trying to figure out what perfect means right well it means is it means complete it means that you know why not just say what he said ever what it is that we try to clarify as far as he's concerned it's perfect right and as far as god is concerned using the word perfect wouldn't need no interpretation it would have to mean just as perfect as he is and that's what brother brown said he said you by the new birth are just as perfect as god is yes why because it's god made manifest is that a simple explanation it's god made benefit and he don't see our faults and failures he only sees our sacrifice and the prophet said he hears our voice through the blood well i'll just go do what i want to see now you prove you're lost come on get off the junk you try to make little trips and traps or something that you're saying and it shows your stupidity see if you think you can get by with it you're lost that's as plain as can be brother dale you told me it's lost you take your choice but church do you see what i'm trying to drive at he said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily so that whatever god was to be on earth whatever he was to manifest on earth not after the future we get on into the eternities but all that he is to make manifest here was manifest in jesus christ all right then if we wasn't in christ now how long do we need to preach on that if we wasn't in christ and we'll never make it anyway if we wouldn't part of that word we'd never be part of that word if we wouldn't die with him in the beginning we'll never be there all right we've been through all of that without any problems right yes but just remember it's all in him and paul sums it up in verse 10 of the second chapter and you are complete in him the word complete is perfect are finished and brought into completion and he is the head of all principalities and powers so no matter what it is he's ahead of it brother randomly said one day said do you mean he's the head of the center he said yes because he can destroy him he's not the head of him like headship he just can destroy him all right trying to get a few thoughts and get into the notes but compound meaning compound revelation so then if we can look at the bible through way of the prophet's message and see that that fullness that there's a capability of it being made manifest upon earth now i'm doing number six or seven again it's got to be in the entire body it's just like we do talking oh i believe the ministry of jesus christ is here today that's what your prophet said now you can argue with him well it was only in him well you know he said it was in the church so that's now you're arguing with him not me all right but then if it's here then why can't we confess that it's here she'll do us no good do not confess his word because you're not going to be saved unless you confess his word right you've got to confess your mouth believe in your heart or you're not going to be saved so then somebody start we need to start confessing what god has said about us but we want to look at our faults and our failures well if god was here that away look what we would be doing and like i illustrated the other day is you know there's getting ready to come out of egypt and moses came down there well that was their deliverer and because he came down there to deliver them the taskmasters started getting a whole lot worse it didn't get better because moses was there it got worse well then when they went into and moses run off 40 years i don't think that they said when he went out oh well you know they started making them get they wasn't getting their up they were supplying them straw et cetera to make brick and all and they were just stepping in the mud maybe or something you know and so he started making them go out and get their own straw well do you think when moses left the first time and they run him off hey moses is gone we'll give you straw i don't think so i think it got worse i think they had 40 years of the most horrible times until probably they said we resent the fact that moses even mentioned that he come to deliver you know and then they were crying out for a deliverer don't you think church it's about time after all that we've seen and heard to be crying out for an end time a deliverer i think it is we should have been doing that all along but remember obama is not going to take care of you and i don't care who comes in either him they're not going to take care of you right i i hope we're finding that out until we get to where we're depending upon god and standing up on on the social security check that we get you know and thank god for the check but uh what if we don't get it next month you know that's can be done away quickly but now so who's worried all right it may be right what the prophet said that we would be physically bereft it may be right where he said that we'd be at the mercy of the elements it may be right where he said we could be shot on the spot for praying for the sick it uh may be coming down what but who worries well it scared me to death brother if you talk about well that means you're not ready okay we got that soft now do something about it okay forgive me all right now let's get started do you believe in compound revelation and compound meaning you know that what speaks of the bridegroom speaks of the bride all right then let's go into some thoughts on something and i may not uh get but just a little bit into this and what i've done is i've i've had these this morning i didn't make enough for everybody but anybody that wants a copy of the notes today on the uh where you can read or where the prophet says the things about the bride being the fullness of the godhead bodily you're perfectly welcome for uh to come up here and get them at the end of the service and uh then we if we need to we'll make you some more all right but i want to just think about it i titled this in him in him or all fullness dwelled in him then the emphasis is made upon him and not upon where it's at if he's the head of the church then it emphasizes it upon him being the head of the church all right and him being in charge all right so if we believe in compound meaning and knowing that what speaks to the bridegroom speaks to the bride and even compound revelation now remember that's quote this morning compound revelation okay i mean that's uh paragraph 56 and through 58 of this day this scripture is fulfilled and that's not just the one there's plenty of them compound meaning but that one has compound meaning and compound revelation so then if that's true then we believe that god was revealed in christ all right well see then that means the bride the prophet said it's part of the revelation and she's to be revealed but now do we believe that and see what i mean by revelation and being revealed is just like the old testament people as i said those prophets are there where god made manifest for the time yeah in each church age it's been god made manifest for the time all right that doesn't make us any different it makes us just being what it is that we're to finishing up for the gentile dispensation and as i've always said to you i was listening the other day somebody wrote me a note about it that if it was necessary to oh go to israel or send to israel would your revelation be enough to convert the jews would your revelation of god be enough to bring them to a understanding of one true and living god in the correct way well we better consider that because you know that's what's going to happen the two prophets the prophet said will take this message and go to israel all right now he didn't say they'd be over passing out quotes and things because they're already doing that they know about this message right and they know what brother branham believes because it's been over the internet over there you know we'll see would it would it convert them just think about it now as we consider a point then if we can show and i'm going to do this kind of an odd way so i said it may take just a little bit and then cut it off uh if we can show by the prophet that the bride is to be the fullness of the godhead bodily i repeat again the entire bride not just the end time people because if he's not complete without us then the church ages is not complete without us but we're not complete without them all right but think about it let's see if we believe it let's see if we can just read and believe what he says go ahead brother and pull up number six and let's start there right above there you remember what we were covering was that the word made flesh is the light of the age all right so now look what he says on sirs we would see jesus 57 804 the evening service e3 there's many different gifts he's talking about his ministry and the things you know the anointing right many different gifts that god has to his church but they're all for the perfecting of the church to bring together in unity the great body of the lord jesus christ and the powers that was in christ now listen has now has is a past tense form right so read it has been given to his church do we believe that in the worst conditions that life could exist until i evenly openly admit it they may have more healings right over there in that service today than we'll have over here but can we still believe it i mean how would you like to been on israelite being beat and stomped and kicked and torn to pieces i'm the people of god it's been kind of hard to confess right but yeah we want it yeah we want the flower blood of evil yeah we want the great the great things are taking place it's no problem to believe when great things are taking place the problem is when not much is taking place and you have to stand on god's word well look what he says the gifts therefore the perfecting of the church to bring together in unity the great body of the lord jesus christ and the powers that was in christ has been given to his church now i started explaining that while ago i believe the ministry of jesus christ is in the bride of christ around the world it is in no place one time but no one is that ministry right now brother branham that ministry was in brother branham but um it takes a collective now to be the body right and i mean collective around the world see all right so then that way god can be doing a little bit here and a little bit there and god looking down at it and says man there's a great revival going on and we look at it and says ain't nothing taking place according to his eyes we look through he says the powers that was in christ has been given to his church all that god was he poured into christ and christ was god manifested on earth and all that christ was he poured into his church and all the powers that god had rested in christ and the fullness of christ rest in his church so what a people this should be look what you and i should be right but can we stand up and say you know somebody comes along and say well i heard your prophet said all the powers of god rest in the church well i i i don't know i don't want to i don't want to confess something that ain't true why you're already lying when you don't say what he say born that away die that away without christ converting us so what good is it to us to play in our little pity patties and think i'm so great at what he did well i don't know he said what a group what a people that should be now i have a funny way of doing things so you bear with me let's go to a statement brother random made because if you can believe that all the powers that christ has has been given to his church then let's think about this statement go ahead with number seven thinking from christ the mr god revealed 63 7 28 paragraph 143 and 144 but what he wanted to do now listen he's talking about god himself right what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father now watch the next statement the only way he could express it was to become a son of man right that's an odd sounding statement in it when we know he could create and he did create and he he created adam and eve and that made him a father right he created angels that made him god he created adam and eve and that made him father now why is your prophet taking it from seemingly there and bringing it seemingly over 4 000 years to express a thought that the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man see he was a father because he created right but how could he express that may i add a word without you tangling me up the only way that he could express what he really had that he really wanted to do and the way he wanted to do it was to become the son of man is that mistranslating anything that he said there the way he wanted it you know the way he wanted to be a father was not in the garden no i went in the garden just to make him the father he wanted to be he had other things in mind that he would have to come through and come down and be now let's read it he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man that's the reason jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it in the congregation of holiday men he wanted to express himself connecting to thought that was his one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in christ well now you've done move 4 thousand years right are you with me yes your thought is moved 4 000 years from father creator down to the way he wanted to be it and he could only do that by being the son of man you see why that it's been so joyous to see things in for over almost 50 years now still try to preach it and preach about the bride of jesus christ being the son of man we'll give them quotes too but it's a joy in my heart to look back at it and see it and think about it brother harris used to preach along on this line years ago about the the only way he could be a father the way he wanted to be a father was to be the son of man all right but think about it do we believe that the son of man is the only sower of the seed do we believe that you had the man in black sowing but that doesn't count because that's wrong seed the only sower of the seed is the son of man do you need those quotes in the prophet we will get to them the next few services why choose to move over and not preach wednesday because some of you are not capable of being here and i'm trying to put all this together on the sunday services all right now if the son of man is the only sower of the seed then that means that he had the seed of his entire right if he's the only sower now now we know that we're not talking about sexual seeds to just be blunt or some gene genetics sexually parts that's not even no the son of man spent a lot of time talking about sowing a seed have you read your bible lately if you happen you need to read it a lot of parables was placed in the scriptures about sowing seed the son of man was the sword of seed in one of those parables it emphatically states that the good seed is who the children of the kingdom the tares are satan in his ways and doings but the good seed is the children of the kingdom well see then it wasn't never right god never got a rightful position as wanting to be father the way he wanted to be father throughout the old testament that's why none of those in the old testament had the new birth you showed me where they did and how they got it when my bible says ghost had not been given because jesus christ had not been crucified now so the son of man he sowed his own body bride that's what he was doing while he was preaching and there was a handful of them walking with him and he sowed into their hearts the word of god and then one day he came and made a way that he came to the place that he could make a way and he could only do that as son of man the holy ghost could not get into mankind in the old testament and give him a new birth it could give him an anointing right but a man like david could be on his way home from the bed with bathsheba and singing out and praying return unto me the joy of thy salvation doesn't sound too much like a born-again christian right but you see that son of man then was god made manifest in flesh and he had the soul if you go back to spoken words original seed and listen to that message over and over the wonderful message a little more but something's very special to me because he speaks in there is that quoted i'm talking about about the word born bride and he tells about eve and her two wombs naturally and you know naturally and spiritually for the body that would come forth see he sowed the new testament bride not into the heart of the earth but into the heart of mankind and that's why there can't be you can't make one greater than the other one because we're all just children of the kingdom no matter what age or what we are or whatever we are in it prophets ministries whatever there's nothing no nobody's no bigger than you are and nobody's no smaller than you are the least in the kingdom is greater than john the baptist now the bible says that but you see what i'm talking about there was no way for him to be the father that he wanted to be unless he would come forth as son of man and as in the natural the only way that you can be a father is for you to have a seed to sow right we're not talking about adoptions or just any other we're talking about natural all right the only way you can have a family is to have a seed because it is not your dna family unless it comes from you right so is it with god the way he wanted a family he wanted a family of children that would love him now quote brother branham that no matter how hard it gets or bad it looks that we would realize that we were his children see those ages as they came down and luther realized he was a child of god and we'll get to it later i know the quotes and you know that could have been at it too long you do not think that i know a little bit he died son of man he wrote son of god to be through the church ages but that's explaining the dispensation because now i'm not correcting brother branham i'm just stating it the way i said it that is explaining dispensation because he died son of man it was the same son of man it raised out of that grave the body raised out of that grave but to be a dispensation he could not come back on the church on the day of pentecost as the son of man he had it would all been finished you and i wouldn't be part of it so he doubts on a man to release that life that was within him which was the son of god who was he when he walked the shores of galilee the bible said he had fullness of the godhead bodily then he was father son and holy ghost he was son of man son of god and son of david now he he couldn't manifest son of david right come on he couldn't manifest son of david that's that's all right but he was still that who's going to well son of david is going to be the son of man and the son of god the son of david's going to israel because that's not three people that's the same god in different manifestations and when he goes over there he'll have to be the son of man the word then he'll have to be the son of god to give them the holy ghost then he'll be the son of david to take them on into the millennium but i hope you're following me how could he be the father he wanted to be by being the son of man how can you be the father you want to be by being a man by choosing a wife right can't do it without y'all girls but you see he didn't have to have a wife to bring forth a dna in a sexual point he created how many people have you've been around here 30 years how many times over 20 30 years have you heard me preach on new creation and brother mo preached that in 1971 i guess 77 we started in 71 and he preached on new creation new race and on the day of pentecost it was a new race of people started now quote the prophet no longer was he dealing by ways of the flesh as he dealt in the old testament a new creation he spoke his bride into being as he was preaching the word and then telling about her what about when he gets over there you know look how let's see uh when the son of man is revealed you know in the scripture glorify thy my name you know glory how glorified will glorified again where's he going glorified again in his bride see all of that pertains to you and i speaking of you and i compound meaning come about in revelation coming down to where we're at are you following me see by doing it and being the fullness of the godhead bodily then he could put that in the church we'd have to start it off i didn't mean to go this way so it's all right we've got plenty of time anyway he started off on the death pentecost with the baptism of the holy ghost in the hearts of the bride right the new birth all right he wasn't spoke of in the ages as son of man paul didn't even write about it the son of man no doubt he knew because he'd talk to the others and even john and and and the ones who wrote in the you know the the writings of matthew mark luke and john you know i know all of them wouldn't original luke and mark were looking which one luke and mark but the others never wrote of him in any of their writings peter never spoke of son of man why because it was not the dispensational time or the doings for that to be done it was the holy ghost dispensation to build his church and upon this rock i'll build my church is that what jesus said in the gates of hell shall not prevail against it really was against it wouldn't it but it couldn't prevail it's still come forth because he promised i will restore so he's building a church none of that through the church ages would call him son of man but yet immediately when this prophet appears on the scene back in the 40s 49 50 he started talking about son of man now we just read that jesus kept saying son of man and said they didn't understand right now you think the people understood when brother randall started talking about the son of man now the best a lot of them could do was try to make him that and he had to clarify i am not the son of man i am a son of man you had to make it clear why because the capability of the people was not at the place to believe it and i wonder is our capability there because i've been preaching this for over 40 years trying to get somebody to believe it believe what the word says believe what the prophet says you know well brother so-and-so said he didn't believe with his gut fullness well the same brother said that the third pull was only for brother branham and brother and the lord jesus well i don't agree with that because the prophet said the third pool was for the bride and the church oh and to the totally lost even the church today is getting the benefits out of the third pool the opening of the word you turn on the radio today and listen to them preach man they preach beautiful messages you know why they've heard the tapes they've read the books it's helping them right one day some of them will say hey you remember that man said them denominations is wrong and they're going to give their life because of what they believe but do you see it the only way to be the father he wanted to be was to be the son of man and he would speak into existence the very word seed some took the seed is that the parable and hell the seed and then the rain would come what was it that pentecost right what about creating your own bridegroom is that a quote the bridegroom created his own bridegroom that's why we're called a new creation a new race but the whole bride of christ is that new race not just the end time that's just a message to the end times do we believe it do we believe the promises that god has made right but i'm not asking you to believe what i'm saying i'm asking you do you understand what i'm saying yes that he created his own bride ride by speaking the word and you know by doing it he gets into matthew 24 and he covers what will happen if you don't believe he spoke the ages et cetera et cetera in matthew 24 he tells what will take place in the church ages right read matthew 24 because he tells what will happen that's where the seals is taken where it's at right in the seals in matthew 24 and he tells what's going to happen through the ages and so just don't think well he spoke that back there and then he's going to speak this over here no the brother branham never come to speak a bride god already had one you don't need nobody to speak abroad he needed somebody to get the bride to realize who she was and what we're doing here is that what he said then satan will be powerless before that group of people that finally believes it but if we don't believe it then there's no need of fooling with it anyway all right but look what he's saying they didn't know what he was talking about many of them now do you get it amen i'm not making light of anybody i'm just saying sometimes we say amen when we don't know what in the world is going on then we should have been saying oh me explain that to me amen right i've said amen when a brother would be preaching and he would be right and be bringing it along and everything would be running right and i say amen in the next words he goes and i've had people come to me and said will you amend what he said i said i am end up to that one point wasn't there on i wouldn't amen and then i'd hold me in it but look how he deals so much that's why i asked you if you would to go home and read the things where all god was he poured into christ all christ in the church take her back to the garden of eden just give a little time sometimes and run that in your computer and see all the times that he spoke about that that all god was he poured into christ saw christ in the church and that's the only way he's going to take us back to the garden of eden right well see what he needs is what we're reading here in the doing so pull the quote back up brother on where he was on christ and mr god revealed paragraph 143 and he's talking about one of his threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in christ all right so that's not the old testament dealings see then secondly to have the preeminence that means first place right in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in people all right drop on to the next one jumps over a couple of paragraphs and it goes to paragraph 153 across the mystery oh if god can get him prisoners like that now that's when he can express the preeminence you see he he's got the man or the person so that he knows nothing but christ you get what i mean congregation said amen all right that's second first to express himself completely god in christ second to have the preeminence by this by what by all that was in god to be poured into christ by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them and all right thirdly to restore the kingdom to his rightly position that fell by sin by the first adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people and talked with them fellowshipped with them now if you want to walk in the cool of the evening you're going to be with god then what do we need to do preeminence we will read one when we get into where brother ryan says he talks about the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelling in the bride he says when there is no leaven among you it will bring he said the fullness now we're not going there this evening but that's what he said it'll be but you see what it was partly he was in moses david had him but here he is manifested in the fullness deity himself standing on earth god in his fullness to die for the sin of the people is progress 372 that he might bring to his church a sanctified life that he might have the preeminence in fullness in his church to manifest every promise in these days that he promised for the last days see promised it let's just bring up 374 for your number eight christ is the mystery of god reveal are you following that then we'll go on down to paragraph 375 and through that purpose he achieved a church that he the fullness of god might bring to pass ever promised word of god in these last days when he gets the preeminence the earth to catch preeminence in the church the position his place in the church now what would be the greatest place that jesus christ could have in the church is be headstone wouldn't it because the head the body don't operate without the head we'll get to those things jesus said he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also even more than this shall he do for i go to my father see that was his purpose there was the manifestation and now today he wants to get somebody that can so see it that they can let the word what just go through them fullness of the godhead bodily can we ever believe it let me get this one and then we'll quit but it won't go on into the lights going to number number eight and let's do that we would see jesus but i'm doing this for the purpose of you understanding that it's in every church age or the purpose of bringing this one we would see jesus 62 7 12 uh e 53 same thing tonight by the holy ghost god on the day of pentecost that pillar of fire broke into many tongues of fire four tongues and set god was separating himself among the people that day god was in one person christ now he's in the entire church universal amen he said now he's in the entire church around the world today he's been in the entire church all the way down to the ages because she's him made manifest but can we believe it can we believe that we are not just a special people in the end time but it's been a special people all the time because it's a new creation a new race not of the old that new birth put us to a position brought us into a dispensation of grace all right brought us to a place to believe who we are wasn't it uh luther that they said you know luther said don't you know that the whole world is against you he said i want them to know i'm against them well you think there's one man well that one man started a reformation that you and i still believe in because he brought the word of god he proved he was the bride he proved what age he was of now we've got to prove what age we're of i hope you get it with the illustration of what i'm talking about in him the prophet said he's not complete without you amen why because he imparted his own life he was not happy to be just the old testament people in what they were doing that was never his goal his achievement he looked down upon jesus christ and can i say this if you'll go to the future home you'll get the whole thing he looked right down to that body that was standing there and said in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelling in jesus christ was god's whole purpose what he was going to do oh was done in him he saw him in him a finished product and he said the statement that we use what is page 49 i think that there in that body our bodies were redeemed in that body sister gail that stood on calvary and died and went down to the grave and rose again my body not speaking of a physical because it's not a point but it was a point that my body will come back to the place it's supposed to be and that's the point but in him was all things made manifest he's the head of all things and by him all things consist you and i are anything we better put the glory in him and say thank you lord for what you've made me that's what he said he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people the sheep of his pastor right but do you see what i'm talking about if there's anything any good about you and i it had to be in him amen and then brought out of him by death that he could see his family right he had spoke the word right he spoke it matthew mark luke and john read it over and over he spoke it but then he had to go to calvary and die to where that could come and make any effect because that was his word and he couldn't put it in them people they had it into them as much as a human being could have right and they even said one day now we know nobody don't have to teach you but remember nicodemus said that we know that no man can do these things well see we want all of this about a seed oh brother dale i heard brother show and show set years ago and i just believe that i'm a seed of what you've got a seed of unbelief you've got you've got all kinds of seeds but he spoke us into existence from his own mouth in that body called lord jesus christ the son of man and then he began to make a way he went on to calvary that you and i could believe that and it could only be coming into the church as son of god we realize that because those disciples did not have the end time message they would bring about the change of the body and i believe that i believe this message brings us to the fullness of the change and that was not present back there it was present in jesus christ matthew 24 because he was talking about but nobody understood it just like he said nobody understood the son of man but do we understand the son of man by being son of man he's my daddy that has more to do with it than just a spiritual baptism i'm ending with a lifestyle a little bit it's more to do than just his life released because he's going to have to make this thing like him and that's why you'll see when we get to it it'll be about four messages i guess where he says the bride of jesus christ is the son of man just run it in your computers if you want these notes on we'll get around to it next weekend the lord willing about the fullness of the godhead bodily being in the bride i believe that i believed it so well years ago i wrote it in my bible and i just keep adding to it because it keeps unfolding to what i tried to preach the bride of christ is the son of man and i still believe that amen no matter if there ain't but one person right it's going to take place i don't look for a big majority and i don't say that wrong about the people coming in the message because what would be a majority counting 7 billion people and if there was 1 billion bride i'm talking about alive right now and there was one billion people bride right now that would still be a minority as compared to seven billion but it says fear not little flock because only the bride's going to know they that know their god shall do what exploits come on brothers let's end it right there before we're going up a little bit into it but if you want these quotes come and get them out of the service and read them if don't then just run in fullness of the godhead it'll give you a good time to just read all of them and you can just read off your computer and study it all day long fullness of the godhead we just remember and find where he's talking about in his church not in one person phyllis the godhead was not in brother branham that would make him the wrong way of being god brother ranum is in the body of christ so he could as john type the church on patmos in the rapture brother branham could walk into the opening of the word but now he's got to wait until somebody gets it and becomes what he said and it's not an extra message or something what we got brother let's stand together red book yes sir 167. anybody have a needle jesus came and made me oh i would not be till jesus came and revealed it till he came and revealed it unto me i won't stop things start going wrong things start going wrong i don't remember let's go everything's going wrong i'm about to be a christian i start searching i start reading and praying because i know that devil trying to cut me off on something if he can cut you off he's done his job just stay right there so you can't figure out the word of god i don't mean that you say you study too much brother dale you can't study enough but you can't study it anyway you can get familiar with the message the layout but it's got to be revealed how do you think i felt in 69 when i said the bride of jesus christ is the son of man when i knew i was standing hello hello people didn't believe it oh we believe the prophet what about this we don't know about that you don't know about what either it's right or wrong right either it's right or wrong but what's the problem i see people say oh but but you're just exalted um brother dick there he's been able over the years to travel about the united states my wife and i and brother dean and sister peggy we got to see the the uh who's the lady out in the ocean out there that you know holding the torch you know uh a statue of liberty uh but we were so tired until we just looked out the window of the bus as we were riding by because we've been wore out from a 12-hour trip and knowing we had four hours go home and uh we didn't even get a picture of it and uh let's see brother dick's been up in it one round and okay some of you may have been in it i can't say that i landed in california but i couldn't get off the plane i mean out of the airport landed in hawaii couldn't get off our plane that time i tell you i've been to hilaria no i just landed but a lot of people been there and landed and can tell you about it that's what i'm talking about this message i love to hear people talk about something that's real to them a real god that leos god that speaks to him talks to him reveals himself to him i love to hear that why because you're talking about my daddy who is your daddy brother of the son of man because he's a daddy of the entire bride he spoke her into existence now he's coming to make it manifest bring it to a reality but it's up to us to believe it anybody have a need just search out that search the messages he's all he's all there is he's wanting to reveal himself just think about him think about what he's trying to do and then let's sing ain't god good because that's getting down to where we are right and just think about it he got good to give us that's what we are tomorrow but we ought to are him love and praise him a little more today again take jesus you
