[0:00] things that he saw blessed is he that
[0:02] readeth and they that hear the words of
[0:04] this prophecy and keep those things
[0:06] which are written they're in
[0:08] for what the time is at hand
[0:11] the time to understand right
[0:14] now in revelations 8 1
[0:18] and when he had opened the seventh seal
[0:21] there were silence in heaven
[0:23] about the space of in half an hour
[0:26] you may be seated lord had his blessing
[0:28] sister regina has a testimony she wants
[0:30] to give us
[0:31] while she's coming up i'll just make
[0:33] this comment you know a lot of people's
[0:35] tried to figure out
[0:37] how much time one half an hour but you
[0:40] got a problem because it said about the
[0:42] space
[0:44] so you remember back in the bible there
[0:46] that it says the sun
[0:48] stood still for about a day it didn't
[0:51] say a whole day right
[0:52] so part of it was left off you had to go
[0:53] on over to pick it up they're getting it
[0:55] and line it back up
[0:57] remember those things come on sister
[0:58] regina
[1:05] i am i want to testify to something that
[1:08] brother dale said
[1:09] at the end of the second service last
[1:11] week and he said
[1:13] thank him for your pain and i want to
[1:17] start with a question
[1:18] can i see a show of hands for who knows
[1:21] that i have back issues
[1:25] not as many as should know once i share
[1:28] the medical diagnosis with you
[1:31] the medical diagnosis is these three
[1:33] things
[1:35] degenerative disc that means they
[1:38] decline over the
[1:39] span nerve impingement
[1:43] pinched nerves and last but not least
[1:47] severe spinal stenosis that's a
[1:50] narrowing of the spinal canal
[1:53] the column that's the diagnosis
[1:57] i'm not on any drugs i don't take
[1:59] neurotin
[2:00] muscle relaxers anything like that over
[2:03] here with my god and my father
[2:06] i live a grateful thankful
[2:09] attitude every single day amen
[2:13] i thank him for everything i thank him
[2:15] for the pain i thank him for
[2:17] the good times i thank him for the bad
[2:19] times
[2:20] he has blessed me to sit on that row
[2:23] with the gibby's
[2:24] they know when i'm having a challenge
[2:26] they will lay hands on me
[2:29] and it flees just like that
[2:34] um
[2:38] for those who don't know the power of
[2:40] that language for the diagnosis i'll
[2:42] break it down
[2:42] further i went to see an orthopedic once
[2:46] and
[2:46] the assistant was reading the mri and he
[2:49] said oh my gosh
[2:51] you are in a lot of pain how are you
[2:54] even standing
[2:56] it's by the amazing grace of god that i
[2:59] am not
[2:59] on medication i might have to take a
[3:02] couple of ibuprofen but that may be
[3:04] two or three months just because i'm
[3:06] having a challenge
[3:08] but i just wanted to share this brother
[3:10] dale gets the opportunity to hear
[3:12] where his little flock is so don't be
[3:14] afraid to testify
[3:16] amen but i appreciate the lord i
[3:19] appreciate the kidneys i appreciate
[3:20] brother dale and i appreciate you for
[3:23] listening thank you amen
[3:34] you know even one thing about
[3:37] pain
[3:40] you know if you didn't have pain there's
[3:43] a lot of things you'd die of
[3:47] that you wouldn't know to get treatment
[3:48] for right
[3:51] you say well a child has a temperature
[3:53] when i don't like for them to have them
[3:54] either
[3:55] but you realize you have a temperature
[3:57] you know right
[3:58] that means something in your body's
[3:59] wrong so you you get help
[4:01] if it didn't you would die right right
[4:05] but thank god for pain all right but the
[4:08] main thing is what
[4:10] the healer comes to take the pain away
[4:13] that's the main part of the healer amen
[4:16] and we appreciate that but around said
[4:19] if god does something for one
[4:21] to order encourage others to uh
[4:24] you know receive and to believe amen
[4:27] now we've been talking for quite a while
[4:31] on the
[4:32] the seals we've come up now to the
[4:35] seventh seal to where that we're going
[4:37] to be speaking for
[4:38] a little while on this and uh
[4:42] i want you to think about these things
[4:46] and i'll repeat this in a minute but
[4:49] what is it that we've been talking about
[4:51] the seals
[4:55] we've been talking about what it reveals
[4:59] um what it shows you know
[5:02] and the time-wise of a lot of it
[5:06] you know the earthly happenings
[5:09] of those things and uh you know
[5:12] trying to understand that because that's
[5:15] written in the word
[5:18] but what is the main thing that i've
[5:20] been trying to get you to consider
[5:22] or keep in mind
[5:25] that what it reveals to you and i
[5:30] mean you say well the first see a white
[5:33] horse rider you know
[5:34] we got that see all right you got the
[5:37] symbol
[5:40] you got the symbol but what does it
[5:42] reveal to you
[5:44] amen when we know that the prophet said
[5:47] to seals and things like that
[5:49] we go out in a rapture in revelation 4 1
[5:54] not seen until 1921 and then he says the
[5:58] seals and these things are not even
[5:59] pertaining to us
[6:02] it's pertaining to israel but see we are
[6:06] supposed to get the revelation
[6:07] amen all right
[6:10] through the opening of the seal and in
[6:13] doing that then we see
[6:15] that it's christ
[6:19] revealing himself to the church amen
[6:22] all right now and then we'll see in a
[6:25] minute what
[6:26] why that's so vital he said well we just
[6:29] read what the prophet says and we
[6:31] believe it well that's wonderful and
[6:33] that's wonderful
[6:35] that's what we read there in revelation
[6:38] blessed is he that readeth and hear
[6:43] these things that's a blessing
[6:46] because a lot of the world knows nothing
[6:48] about these things
[6:50] that you and i talk about on a common
[6:52] basis we'd call it
[6:53] or an everyday thoughts you know
[6:57] they know nothing about it you just
[7:00] think what if we were in that shape
[7:02] right man all right then
[7:05] you come into the message part and you
[7:08] get into it
[7:08] and people then says but but we don't
[7:11] need to go too far now and go
[7:13] get too far out because we could miss it
[7:17] well i i don't know how far you can get
[7:19] out to make you miss it
[7:21] now if you get off you miss it right
[7:24] but if we get enough to get us changed
[7:28] i don't think that's too far out right
[7:31] i think that's what it's supposed to do
[7:34] but see we miss it by you know trying to
[7:38] self-interpret
[7:39] right we we've had a profit
[7:43] to give us the words you'll see in a
[7:44] moment why we depend upon that so much
[7:48] you know because that if god had not
[7:51] sent a prophet to us in the last days
[7:54] you and i would be exactly like the
[7:56] religious world system
[7:58] that would know nothing about redemption
[8:01] oh yeah we would be talking about jesus
[8:03] we would preach that he saved us he
[8:05] heals us he he delivers us
[8:09] and maybe one of these days we're going
[8:11] to get to go to heaven
[8:13] where he's at or something see and we
[8:15] wouldn't know anything about it so
[8:17] i thank god just for the intellectual
[8:20] conception
[8:21] right right to just to be able to read
[8:25] that's right
[8:26] and here listening last night we worked
[8:28] around him on questions and answers and
[8:31] him explaining uh hebrews
[8:34] hebrews 6 you know
[8:37] and to just think that we always
[8:39] wondered about those things
[8:42] you know when we wonder how that that
[8:44] would be and then here comes a prophet
[8:46] just makes it so simple
[8:48] until it's just amazing amazing to us
[8:52] you know
[8:53] but now as we approach this i said i'll
[8:56] probably repeat this many times
[8:58] because to me it's what is revealed to
[9:01] you and i
[9:03] through the opening of the word right
[9:04] amen
[9:07] because we can say well the prophet said
[9:09] so and so well that's wonderful
[9:12] but has he revealed himself to you
[9:16] the bible doesn't say
[9:20] that we're waiting on the prophet by
[9:23] himself
[9:25] that's right it says we're waiting on
[9:28] the faithful ministry
[9:29] amen one thing to bring the word
[9:33] but then we're waiting on the
[9:34] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[9:36] of the living god
[9:38] to finish up what jesus didn't finish
[9:42] when he was here see that's where people
[9:44] go haywire when you make statements like
[9:46] that
[9:46] but when brother brown makes those
[9:48] statements then you have to listen
[9:52] but see then
[9:55] we read here of when he had opened the
[9:59] seventh seal
[10:01] there was silence in heaven about the
[10:03] space of half an hour
[10:05] that's what i said people's trying to
[10:06] figure out how much that is
[10:10] make it so many years of earthly time
[10:13] you know
[10:15] but now here's the main emphasis this
[10:17] morning
[10:20] it doesn't say a half an hour on earth
[10:25] right right it doesn't say anything
[10:27] about earth
[10:28] that's right in this seal the other
[10:32] is dealing with time and earthly
[10:34] happenings and
[10:36] et cetera et cetera you know
[10:40] tribulations and things but here it says
[10:43] silence
[10:45] in heaven amen
[10:49] now keep that in your mind and keep it
[10:52] in your thoughts
[10:53] because see
[10:56] i'll say it and then come back and prove
[10:58] the point
[11:00] until all the seven seals are revealed
[11:04] to the bride of jesus christ and made
[11:07] manifest
[11:09] there's still silence in heaven
[11:25] i said seven seals
[11:28] is revealed to us right that's right
[11:31] yeah but how in the world brother dale
[11:33] can we
[11:33] find out what this is
[11:37] god sent us a prophet that's right i
[11:40] thought we believed
[11:41] yes amos three and seven
[11:45] amen that he would send it by the
[11:48] prophet
[11:48] right and see we then we
[11:52] we've got to be dependent upon the
[11:54] prophet for the entire bible to be made
[11:56] known
[12:01] see that way we put our whole emphasis
[12:03] upon whether or not
[12:04] god did keep his work
[12:07] and we know he did he did and we know
[12:10] that he will
[12:12] and i wish he would write this down
[12:14] because
[12:16] i wrote it at the top of my notes and i
[12:18] wish he would just jot this down
[12:20] to consider it
[12:23] what we're going to be dealing with for
[12:24] a little while is to see how
[12:26] perfect god's word
[12:29] is
[12:34] how perfect his word is
[12:40] and how he keeps his word
[12:45] he said well that's that's a simple
[12:47] thought that's what i i try to make
[12:49] everything as simple as i can and i know
[12:51] i'm accused of being
[12:53] everything from an intellect to a devil
[12:54] i guess but
[12:56] in a dodie old grouchy god
[12:59] but uh
[13:03] to me the only way we can understand god
[13:05] in his ways is in simplicity
[13:10] he hides himself that he might reveal
[13:12] himself how
[13:14] in simplicity people say that's deep no
[13:20] it was deep before you got to revelation
[13:22] right when it's revealed it's simple
[13:25] that's right damn it anything that's not
[13:28] revealed is deep
[13:30] that's right it doesn't matter what the
[13:32] apex of what your revelation
[13:34] is it's still simple i'm afraid
[13:39] you know why because that way
[13:42] the simple minded can understand that's
[13:45] right
[13:47] you know if an illiterate child
[13:49] according to the prophet can be saved
[13:53] how simple is simplicity
[13:57] see we want to make it the word
[14:00] and talk about that they can't be say
[14:02] well why because the prophet says again
[14:07] you know he can reveal itself to someone
[14:09] who has no education whatsoever
[14:13] see that's where we want to try to make
[14:14] it some deep
[14:16] serious thing instead of the simplicity
[14:21] the prophet would go to a place like
[14:23] africa
[14:26] and preach one sermon and god do
[14:30] some signs and wonders and 30 000
[14:34] people come to jesus christ
[14:38] right
[14:41] and the women would get up and go put on
[14:43] clothes
[14:46] but nobody has preached to them that
[14:48] they had to put on gloves
[14:52] yeah we think the message is closed and
[14:55] higher than the rest
[15:06] but that's not the new birth
[15:12] the new birth is the birth of the word
[15:15] to bring christ into you as i was trying
[15:16] to bring her
[15:17] this past wednesday on the soul of the
[15:21] individual
[15:23] and what we are
[15:26] you see simplicity
[15:33] simplicity is revealed word
[15:38] intellect is
[15:41] word that's not revealed
[15:47] and in those things then
[15:51] we as we approach something like this
[15:56] we try to look at it in the best way
[15:57] that we can because that's what i've
[15:59] encouraged you as i started off
[16:01] talking to see what these seals revealed
[16:04] to you
[16:06] look around said god opened one of the
[16:08] seals and showed john his name
[16:11] he said has your name been revealed to
[16:12] you through the breaking of the seal
[16:18] but yet we're not supposed to know about
[16:20] these things
[16:23] well i thought man i'm just
[16:27] you know 44 or more years of studying
[16:31] i thought we were supposed to know the
[16:33] plan of redemption
[16:38] i thought that was what we needed to
[16:39] know
[16:41] not that it would just go to church and
[16:43] be good
[16:45] you know but i thought it was to
[16:49] know the plan of redemption
[16:53] well then i thought the prophet said
[16:56] that it was a six seal book of
[17:02] redemption
[17:04] i thought the seals revealed the plan of
[17:06] redemption
[17:07] why wouldn't we want to know that
[17:15] we see church
[17:20] we tried to figure out things with our
[17:22] own intelligence and that's where your
[17:24] intellect is
[17:30] when brother adam would say something
[17:32] he'd say he said i think
[17:35] now there's no writing in the bible that
[17:37] he said i think right
[17:39] but brother random would say that
[17:43] and he said that's where she messed up
[17:45] right
[17:48] it was what her own thought
[17:52] upon what god was going to do
[17:58] see then our thinking if it's not
[18:01] according to god's word
[18:03] is the same thing that happened in the
[18:04] garden of eden
[18:09] because that's where the problem is at
[18:10] right around said
[18:12] that satan stopped up those fluids
[18:14] talking about your spiritual realm
[18:16] right we talked about wednesday night
[18:21] and he messed that up and he said we
[18:24] need to blow them things out
[18:26] but now listen as we approach this
[18:29] seventh seal
[18:34] he said but it says there's silence in
[18:35] heaven for especially half an hour
[18:40] and there's not anything revealed
[18:47] well
[18:50] the first thought is it it says
[18:54] their silence
[18:58] in heaven respects a half an hour
[19:02] so the seal is
[19:06] it's written out in language
[19:12] this it says they're silent so there was
[19:15] challenge
[19:19] now we went through in our study on
[19:22] these things we've covered
[19:25] that seal one two three and four
[19:30] each had a symbol right what was writer
[19:33] read was writer black original
[19:36] hail
[19:38] all right and we went into the fifth and
[19:43] the sixth to see that
[19:44] that they were not symbols
[19:49] so it's be coming negative or partial
[19:53] understanding
[19:55] to perfect understanding
[19:59] see the fifth and sixth seal
[20:03] what we needed from the prophet was to
[20:05] know who those people were
[20:08] but yet the bible says it was people
[20:12] so it's not a symbol
[20:16] the earthquake is not a symbol
[20:22] it's a reality but see now we come to
[20:25] the basis that there's not a symbol
[20:32] but we come to a positive realization of
[20:34] understanding that
[20:36] whatever
[20:43] happens
[20:46] it causes silence in heaven right
[20:51] so i guess we think that what it is all
[20:53] these other things is revealing things
[20:55] and then
[20:55] you're on the seventh it's your silence
[21:03] well then when we get to heaven and
[21:05] still be silent
[21:11] we'll get to it in a moment where the
[21:12] prophet said until these seven
[21:15] seals are revealed
[21:18] we're only presuming amen
[21:26] which means to venture without authority
[21:30] but now what has been the example we've
[21:33] given to understanding or
[21:35] breaking forth of the seals
[21:39] first we look at what they reveal
[21:44] the time wise the earthly happenings
[21:45] events etc
[21:49] but we just didn't stay on that
[21:55] we begin to talk about as i said what
[21:57] does it reveal to you and i
[21:58] right right amen
[22:06] because i told you about it
[22:10] i told you when i first read to see a
[22:12] book after reading the church eight book
[22:14] and
[22:15] many other messages and hearing a lot of
[22:17] tapes that brother moat was very wise
[22:20] and telling me he said
[22:21] i don't suggest you that i wanted that
[22:24] seal book
[22:25] because that always i knew that they
[22:27] were written in the bible i
[22:28] i had read that you know and
[22:33] so he said read these other books and
[22:34] then
[22:36] get around to reading that one i said
[22:38] okay so
[22:40] i kept the word you know i sure did look
[22:44] at that seal book a lot though
[22:47] but i kept a word and i read the things
[22:50] the church eight books and many
[22:51] many messages and then when i got into
[22:55] the seals i was really understanding
[22:57] great things that
[22:58] i had really wondered about you know
[23:00] what did these things mean
[23:04] but then when i came up to the seventh
[23:06] seal
[23:10] i saw something there that really
[23:15] made me think
[23:19] that here's a man telling me
[23:22] what is taking place
[23:29] and as he's telling me
[23:32] he's talking about himself right
[23:37] you remember when you first read yes
[23:41] he was talking about himself
[23:44] and that began to be confusing to me
[23:51] well you know what i've done i'd like to
[23:52] see a book down
[23:54] i went back to reading some of the other
[23:56] messages
[23:57] and i got into the church age book and
[24:00] began to read that one and
[24:03] getting a background of one god and the
[24:06] things that was really needful
[24:08] and then one day i opened the seal book
[24:10] and i began to read
[24:14] and i admit when i came to the seventh
[24:16] seal that it seemed still
[24:20] that this man talking about himself
[24:22] right
[24:25] you know you might don't don't either
[24:34] we should be looking at the bible to
[24:36] find ourselves
[24:40] now you know what we look at the bible
[24:41] to try to find most of the time
[24:44] we look in it to try to engage other
[24:47] people
[24:52] you look around
[24:56] saw donnie goof up the other day
[25:01] see a lot of these dresses get a little
[25:02] too high some of them too old
[25:04] you know in the tops
[25:08] now come on i try to be honest with you
[25:23] instead of trying to read the bible to
[25:25] find ourselves we were reading the bible
[25:27] to find other people
[25:28] yes boy ain't it something about them
[25:32] denominations man
[25:34] ain't that something
[25:40] well look at all that twisted up mess
[25:45] and i i just don't understand how come
[25:46] you can't see what i see
[25:50] when i first read it i seen it
[25:54] that's good brother and i come along and
[25:57] i got a problem dealing with that
[25:59] because
[26:00] i remember the six or eight months of
[26:01] the year or two that it took me to get
[26:03] you to see what you see
[26:06] and of course you don't like that
[26:14] i remember when you argued with me about
[26:16] it
[26:21] i know i'm not supposed to be that old
[26:23] hateful dirty old guy but i
[26:25] i still am and i remember
[26:30] but see after a while then it begins to
[26:33] within you you begin to
[26:37] see that the word is really talking to
[26:39] you
[26:43] we're not to be concerned about what
[26:45] it's talking to everybody else that's
[26:47] right
[26:48] because it's none of our business
[26:52] between them and the lord
[26:56] you begin to get a little different look
[26:58] you begin to read the bible and you
[26:59] begin to see
[27:01] hey he's talking about me
[27:07] how many of you remember when you first
[27:08] saw the water baptism
[27:11] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[27:17] yes of course first time you heard it
[27:20] you run out and got it done
[27:29] sorry didn't do it
[27:34] but you remember a little point that i
[27:36] want to get to you
[27:38] that you know
[27:42] we got to noticing it said the name
[27:44] that's right right
[27:47] well you know it wound up that every
[27:50] time i'd read anywhere in the bible
[27:53] i'd find that little word in a me that's
[27:56] right
[27:57] i said well the whole bible bible's full
[28:01] of that word
[28:02] name you ever notice
[28:06] you go buy you a car you got the only
[28:09] green one
[28:10] that's right you drive down the street
[28:14] now comes about 15 green cards
[28:20] you just didn't notice it before
[28:24] see that's what the bible's supposed to
[28:29] is do bring out ourselves into the bases
[28:31] that way we can do something about
[28:32] ourselves
[28:34] it's not what we can do about getting
[28:36] other people ready that's right
[28:38] i conned that phrase that time you know
[28:41] found out it was in the book but a lot
[28:44] of people laughed about it where brother
[28:45] brown would say
[28:46] is your wife worthy of the gospel
[28:50] because everybody thought see 60s 70s
[28:53] and all and that's what they still think
[28:55] if we get the women lined up we're going
[28:57] to rapture
[29:01] well
[29:04] it might be just me that's holding it
[29:06] back
[29:08] you know but you understand what i'm
[29:10] saying i'm trying to talk and something
[29:12] to get you to think
[29:16] that the bible the bible itself is very
[29:19] very simple
[29:20] yes amen
[29:23] because it can speak to the hearts of
[29:24] the most illiterate
[29:27] yes amen and reveal jesus christ to them
[29:32] that's right and you know that could be
[29:37] one rapture
[29:40] it's not the intellect that's going to
[29:42] make the rapture that's right
[29:46] it's the revelation that's right
[29:50] amen now
[29:53] in doing that then we're total as i said
[29:55] and come back to it some more
[29:57] we're totally dependent i mean totally
[30:00] you realize what we're doing today you
[30:03] realize
[30:03] the people of this message now i'm not
[30:05] saying that will work or they don't
[30:07] depend on them
[30:08] because they're always trying to change
[30:09] what the prophet said and do this that
[30:11] or the other
[30:12] yeah but if we're really going to
[30:15] believe
[30:17] that god kept his word
[30:21] and sent a prophet
[30:24] unto us then we must believe that he was
[30:28] sent to bring us the word
[30:31] amen right so that means that we didn't
[30:34] have it right that's right
[30:40] see it took him 30 something years he
[30:42] said
[30:44] to preach up to 62 in the statue of
[30:46] perfect man
[30:48] that's what he said
[30:52] 30-something years of preaching to get a
[30:55] people to the bases that they could
[30:56] believe a little bit
[31:01] and what about when he would get into
[31:02] the seals
[31:05] he gets over the questions and answers
[31:09] and because of the questions that he was
[31:11] receiving
[31:13] that he asked to be specifically on the
[31:16] seals
[31:19] and the question was about her and dress
[31:22] and clothes and pajamas
[31:24] and water baptism
[31:28] brother brown how can jesus
[31:32] and god be one
[31:36] to what he said there in this in the
[31:38] question of nature he said it's gone
[31:39] from you
[31:41] that's right
[31:50] no he hadn't preached it yet that's
[31:52] right
[31:55] but you can see by the questions on the
[31:57] people's heart that
[31:58] they were not getting what he was
[31:59] talking about
[32:06] see church then are we getting it after
[32:09] 40 something years
[32:10] yes why haven't we had 40-something
[32:15] years
[32:16] right
[32:21] you know that moses was down in egypt
[32:23] ready yes
[32:25] to deliver israel
[32:30] come on he was a deliverer he was called
[32:32] right
[32:38] and for 40 years he had to wait
[32:42] that's right and the people until the
[32:44] people got ready
[32:45] that's right brother said calling for
[32:49] a deliverer
[32:53] they hated o moses because you know all
[32:55] moses done to the children of israel
[32:57] on his first journey was increased their
[32:59] taskmasters
[33:02] right that's right come on that's what's
[33:05] happened
[33:06] that's right where they were just doing
[33:09] a certain amount of day then
[33:10] they kept increasing it because of
[33:12] moses's presence that's right
[33:16] them in trouble they certainly didn't
[33:20] want moses
[33:22] do we want the prophet's message
[33:25] is our life now get on to the point i
[33:28] want to run there
[33:31] is our life totally dependent
[33:34] upon whether or not
[33:38] god sent brother branham to you and i
[33:44] remember the scripture that said behold
[33:45] i send you
[33:49] elijah the prophet yes right
[33:53] it didn't say them right right
[33:56] you amen
[33:59] now are we dependent upon that
[34:04] yes or do we still have our own thoughts
[34:06] and ideas
[34:07] right
[34:11] did i take it well that's where we get
[34:13] in trouble
[34:14] right when we start trying to think it
[34:17] out that's right
[34:18] now but like we covered wednesday night
[34:20] see the bible says come let us reason
[34:22] together
[34:26] but around said no senses are no problem
[34:29] if they're lined up with the word
[34:34] god uses those senses to speak to you
[34:37] and i
[34:38] yes
[34:42] to try to bring this the revealed word
[34:43] yes
[34:45] right but now we went through
[34:49] six seals
[34:52] as i said a moment ago seeing that they
[34:54] were dealing with symbols
[34:56] and dealing with actuality of the fifth
[34:59] and sixth seal of seeing
[35:01] people
[35:04] and we had to have a prophet to even
[35:06] tell us what the symbols were
[35:11] we had to have a prophet to tell us what
[35:13] who the people were
[35:16] and it was totally contrary to all of
[35:18] our thinking that's right
[35:22] and he said it was contrary to his
[35:28] thinking
[35:31] so now what are we going to do getting
[35:32] to a
[35:34] seventh seal when it just says there's
[35:37] silence in heaven
[35:40] about the space of half hour
[35:44] as i said while ago then we try to
[35:46] figure out how long that would be
[35:48] thinking that would help us
[35:54] do you know that if we knew the day of
[35:55] the coming of the lord it would only be
[35:57] a hindrance
[35:58] to us yes
[36:03] brothers we would be no more than a maya
[36:06] calendar
[36:08] it went out yesterday
[36:12] world in the end
[36:17] see if you knew the day you wouldn't be
[36:19] prepared until the day got there
[36:24] right
[36:26] it's true i mean you go down now it's a
[36:28] good idea you know you say well i'm
[36:29] going to take a vacation
[36:30] somewhere in november well you know
[36:32] what's a good idea go buy you plane
[36:33] tickets
[36:34] you get real cheap right right
[36:41] but you don't pack your clothes
[36:47] right right do you sat down in front of
[36:50] the airport
[36:56] you get what i'm saying yes
[37:00] if we knew the very moment and that's
[37:02] why brother randall said god
[37:04] kept it that way the word of bride will
[37:08] be watching and waiting
[37:14] he's oh yes if i knew the day no no no
[37:20] no
[37:22] probably be so shitly lazy about it we'd
[37:24] forget today
[37:26] that he said he was coming
[37:32] all right church now let's go on into
[37:33] something now
[37:36] we read here in revelation 8 1 that it
[37:38] says a silence in heaven
[37:43] now you want to write this down and then
[37:45] just use it later on
[37:47] you'll hear it a lot of it doesn't say
[37:50] there's silence on earth
[37:57] there has to be a reason for the silence
[38:02] would you agree that's right yes as i
[38:04] said a moment ago
[38:05] it's not just 30 minutes
[38:10] or 20 years or never how you get it all
[38:13] figured out
[38:19] something had to take place
[38:23] right witness said there was silence
[38:33] something had to go on there
[38:40] okay
[38:43] now we went through the seals coming up
[38:49] we came up to the sixth seal and
[38:52] the prophet of god covers through that
[38:54] that's the earthquake and the thing
[38:58] and he covers a lot of things and says
[39:00] it's the
[39:01] you know the two witnesses come in that
[39:02] period of time and and
[39:04] and all like that but then when he
[39:07] starts on the seventh seal
[39:09] he does an odd thing
[39:13] he doesn't just jump in to tell you what
[39:15] it is you remember in the seals back
[39:17] prior
[39:18] you can't find this i'll help you find
[39:20] it
[39:21] he said i i just talk a while until
[39:25] paraphrasing it until the spirit comes
[39:28] for to
[39:29] to deal with this so when he take the
[39:32] first seal
[39:33] and then he he talked about regarding
[39:35] simplicity
[39:36] until something happened and then he
[39:38] would
[39:39] not and he got into the seventh seal and
[39:43] he
[39:44] begin to talk and he says
[39:49] there's an interval which means a
[39:52] like a space between
[39:56] you know a gap whatever you want to call
[39:58] it
[40:00] between this sixth and seventh seal said
[40:02] we need to cover this because this is
[40:03] all the material we got to go on
[40:05] we'll read that in a second
[40:11] if you notice there was a breach between
[40:15] uh
[40:18] sixth and seventh seal i mean six and
[40:20] seven churches
[40:22] and he preached a message on the uh
[40:25] the throne and the different things you
[40:26] know
[40:28] ten virgins is the message there's
[40:32] always a gap
[40:32] and something has to come in there there
[40:35] was a gap between the old testament and
[40:37] the new
[40:38] right and see john the baptist had to
[40:40] come in
[40:42] and fit exactly into place to be able to
[40:45] carry it across
[40:47] because always in an interval or a gap
[40:50] there's got to be something to go across
[40:52] and like you go down and you look and
[40:54] there's a mountain here in the mountain
[40:55] there and you can't get across what do
[40:56] you do you build a bridge
[40:58] so the bridge is the gap so he preached
[41:00] the message
[41:01] god in simplicity and then he preached a
[41:04] message called the bridge breach
[41:07] and that word breach means that you
[41:10] bring those two together
[41:12] by a bridge in between
[41:16] right you reach over you you get over
[41:19] to the other side all right then there
[41:22] was a breach between the
[41:26] six and seventh seal
[41:29] and uh he said this is all we got to go
[41:31] on
[41:33] talks about the calling out of the 144
[41:35] 000 to dan and ephraim and
[41:37] yes and all of the things missing and
[41:39] then being put back in
[41:44] he said that's all we got to go on
[41:49] now you might not
[41:52] consider a way that i think and i'm glad
[41:54] you don't because we'd all be in trouble
[41:56] with everybody
[41:56] like me i agree with that 100 percent
[42:02] but to me i've got to be able to see
[42:03] something to get across
[42:05] yes if there's a gap i've got to be able
[42:08] to see what gets me across there
[42:11] i'm not just going to stand up there and
[42:13] it'll be foggy down have you ever been
[42:15] above the clouds in an airplane
[42:16] have you ever been above them in out in
[42:19] colorado one time walked out on this
[42:21] plateau and looked at the prettiest
[42:24] mountain right over there and it looked
[42:25] like all i gotta do is walk this snow
[42:26] over there
[42:30] but that wasn't snow it was clouds
[42:35] and you know what would have happened
[42:37] that i stepped out
[42:39] right you see i want to know how to get
[42:42] across there
[42:45] all right now my total dependencies upon
[42:47] whether or not
[42:48] god kept his word right i'll ask you to
[42:51] write that down
[42:53] see how perfect god's word is and
[42:56] whether or not he'd keep that word
[43:01] so he sent us a prophet we agree right
[43:04] yes
[43:08] now brother branham couldn't bridge us
[43:10] across
[43:15] but god through keeping his word to send
[43:17] us a prophet
[43:19] that the word could come to
[43:24] then we'd have the ability to be able to
[43:26] cross these gaps
[43:30] he said john the baptist yes
[43:33] right 200 years to messiah
[43:37] he brought him across he bridged it from
[43:39] the old to you amen
[43:44] see then when you get into the feast of
[43:46] the trumpets brother adam will tell you
[43:47] that
[43:48] between the sixth and seventh seal the
[43:51] messenger of malachi 4 comes
[43:53] okay and that drove people to haywire
[43:58] the one brother said you can't trust
[43:59] what he said there because there's too
[44:01] many mistakes
[44:02] well i don't find any at all because he
[44:04] said it was thus saith the lord
[44:05] i found a lot of my gap mind and you
[44:08] know messed up
[44:10] see you looking and saying and we'll get
[44:11] back to that eventually one of these
[44:13] days
[44:14] and you'll say what brother rather said
[44:17] all the trumpets sound on the sixth seal
[44:20] that's right that's true yeah
[44:25] and if the messenger of malachi 4 comes
[44:27] between the 6th and 7th seal
[44:30] i'd put him in the tribulation that's
[44:32] where our mind goes
[44:38] that's why people say you can't
[44:39] understand what he's talking about i
[44:41] agree
[44:42] we can't if it's not revealed i don't
[44:43] agree with that 100 percent
[44:46] we see they fail to look enough and keep
[44:48] searching to find out brother brown said
[44:50] one day
[44:53] after the seal's broken honey
[44:56] he said all those trumpets sounding on a
[45:00] sixth seal
[45:00] and he said six of them's already
[45:02] sounded
[45:09] so the prophet came between the six and
[45:11] seven trumpet
[45:15] got six of them done sounded
[45:21] see that's where we look at it we try to
[45:23] analyze there and nail it down on one
[45:25] thought instead of listening
[45:26] yes to consider what's being said
[45:30] that's right i believe that we had a
[45:33] prophet to come to bring us a message
[45:35] yes
[45:39] he didn't stand there for me jesus
[45:42] christ
[45:43] amen but he had to use him to tell me
[45:46] about it
[45:48] right right how much greater could it be
[45:51] to honor to a prophet
[45:53] than to believe his work
[45:58] but he says about this and he brings out
[46:01] during the seventh seal to the beginning
[46:04] he brings out those the things of the
[46:06] 144 thousand
[46:08] are taken out of the of danny from the
[46:10] putting back of dan and ephraim and
[46:12] he says go ahead and pull up number one
[46:15] a brother
[46:17] look what he says
[46:22] this is in the seventh seal paragraph 81
[46:25] now we're going to speak here now on
[46:26] this seventh chapter in just a minute
[46:28] to kind of bridge it in between
[46:32] sixth and seventh seal
[46:36] because that's the only material
[46:39] we have to go on right now
[46:43] is the between the six and seventh seal
[46:45] is the calling out of israel
[46:48] all right so he preaches and
[46:52] brings a great lengthy discourse there
[46:54] or whatever
[46:55] the word is called i don't like our
[46:57] human words
[46:58] he preaches a great message of the
[47:00] taking out of danny from the putting
[47:02] back of dan and ephraim
[47:04] to show us that god said
[47:07] if you go after the models your name is
[47:10] going to be removed from under heaven
[47:14] and danny from was removed from under
[47:16] heaven
[47:18] but when heaven comes back into view in
[47:20] the millennial reign
[47:21] dan and ephraim is put back in
[47:26] that's why i ask you to write down
[47:30] how perfect is god's word
[47:37] and how he keeps his word
[47:41] now to me that's the basis of what he
[47:44] was saying
[47:46] the only thing we got to go on is the
[47:48] calling out of israel
[47:49] to bridge it between the six and seventh
[47:51] seal
[47:57] he said that's all we have to go on
[48:01] what god
[48:04] telling them what it would do
[48:11] and telling them that their name would
[48:13] be blotted out under heaven
[48:16] but it will not be blotted out in heaven
[48:20] under heaven thereby he
[48:24] kept his word amen
[48:29] how perfect a foundation could you lay
[48:31] it down
[48:32] to be able to say what he was going to
[48:34] say and tell us what the seventh seal is
[48:36] that's right what would be more perfect
[48:39] what a thought could you bring
[48:41] to be more perfect than god
[48:44] giving you his word amen and god
[48:47] keeping his word
[48:52] and then you will start dealing with a
[48:54] silence in heaven
[49:00] an interval a space
[49:04] there but now here's the point and i
[49:08] said i'll repeat
[49:10] because we're not to look at the seals
[49:12] to see what he's talking about somebody
[49:15] else
[49:19] that's fine that's wonderful that's like
[49:20] reading the book
[49:22] you get john and mary you know
[49:28] you get what's his name
[49:31] don't run spot run
[49:37] sister julie gave me that one for a
[49:40] christmas present
[49:46] so we're looking for the revelation
[49:52] of not just who these things are talking
[49:56] about
[50:02] but what does it reveal to you and i
[50:10] am
[50:13] remember the six seals are to
[50:18] reveal the plan of redemption the
[50:20] seventh seal doesn't reveal anything
[50:22] it's silence
[50:25] but you'll find out later it can be
[50:27] revealed right
[50:29] in silence the fact of the silences
[50:32] means that
[50:34] if if if it was just the seventh seal
[50:36] open
[50:38] right then why did it just say it that
[50:41] way
[50:43] let's set up still open then just go on
[50:48] it stipulated made a point
[50:52] but there was silence in heaven
[51:03] see mankind has always been waiting
[51:08] the plan of redemption to be completed
[51:10] right
[51:15] is that our desires is that our thoughts
[51:17] to plan a redemption to be completed
[51:20] finished brought into reality made into
[51:22] manifestation
[51:24] revealed and it must be revealed
[51:28] before it can be brought into a reality
[51:32] i go that's the way god does it yes all
[51:35] right
[51:39] see there's a plan of redemption
[51:43] what is it about the plan of redemption
[51:45] that we need to know
[51:50] what would be the end time that we've
[51:52] preached so long on all these years and
[51:54] talked about
[51:56] what would be the thing in the end time
[51:58] that we need to know
[52:04] paul and peter and them preach to plan a
[52:06] redemption
[52:10] they preached the new birth
[52:14] and then we must receive it that's right
[52:17] they preach the statue of a perfect man
[52:21] that brings the individual to a position
[52:26] they preached of adoption
[52:30] they preached
[52:35] to talk about a child coming to
[52:38] adulthood
[52:42] but what is the thing that's always been
[52:44] the mystery
[52:50] that they were not able to bring into
[52:52] reality back there
[52:56] the change of this body that we live in
[52:59] that's right
[53:01] so the plan of redemption is not
[53:02] complete until we see
[53:05] the full redemption um
[53:09] this body and then by this body being
[53:12] redeemed
[53:12] the world is going to have to follow it
[53:14] right so we're waiting the redemption to
[53:17] bring us to a reality
[53:19] and then a world will have to be one day
[53:21] changed
[53:24] so that is the mystery of redemption
[53:26] that we need to know about
[53:28] and that's what the seals reveal
[53:32] we're talking about the fifth seal as to
[53:35] be
[53:37] those that were crucified that were
[53:39] killed from by
[53:41] from calvary down to where we are now
[53:44] that
[53:47] know nothing about jesus christ that's
[53:49] right
[53:50] but yet god is going to give them
[53:52] eternal life
[53:54] yes
[53:57] and to think about how that that plan
[53:59] our redemption would so apply there that
[54:02] you could see justification
[54:07] that in god's eyes you and i didn't do
[54:09] what the things we've done
[54:15] so justified
[54:18] until we can see him giving those people
[54:21] eternal life
[54:24] sanctification under the sixth seal
[54:28] there were people in the world and then
[54:30] all is purged
[54:33] and to realize it must be a people in
[54:35] the end time purged
[54:37] so much until god can step on the scene
[54:39] in our hearts and our lives
[54:44] the plan of redemption
[54:49] knowing that one day this world that we
[54:51] live on
[54:52] will receive such a baptism of the holy
[54:54] ghost
[54:55] until it will burn off all the dessert
[54:57] diseases the germs
[54:59] the life that we call it today and
[55:02] destroy
[55:03] all of the demons and things
[55:09] and to realize the baptism of the holy
[55:11] ghost to you and i
[55:13] should bring that soul to that place
[55:19] towards eternal life living in the soul
[55:23] of mankind by the new birth
[55:29] but still with that new birth
[55:33] with that adoption you talk about
[55:36] but all of those things
[55:42] we don't see the body redeemed
[55:46] you know what i mean we believe it is we
[55:48] talk about it
[55:51] not in the manifestation that's right
[55:54] all right
[55:55] so something has to happen
[55:58] but the prophet of god made the key to
[56:00] it one day
[56:01] he said and we know that he doesn't step
[56:03] here physically until the millennium
[56:04] but he made a statement one day he said
[56:07] god fill every fiber of our being
[56:10] and take us in the rapture
[56:14] well i just don't see that brother dale
[56:16] one
[56:19] i don't either but that got anything to
[56:21] do with it
[56:29] come on does that got anything to do
[56:30] with it because i don't see it
[56:32] that's right that's what people are
[56:34] about to sell it's sealed see they say
[56:36] it's not open
[56:37] well what the heart says not open to me
[56:40] they're not safe not open but the bible
[56:43] says
[56:44] it's open the prophet says it's opened
[56:45] them
[56:49] see they want to say the way i believe
[56:52] it is not open
[56:53] they don't do that they want everybody
[56:55] it's not open to nobody
[56:57] you know what they're saying when it
[56:59] does open i'll tell you
[57:02] right you don't recognize them dot them
[57:04] demons
[57:05] you don't recognize them things standing
[57:07] in front of you
[57:08] call preachers right i'll tell you when
[57:13] it opens
[57:13] okay yeah
[57:18] now brother dale they're not all white i
[57:19] didn't say there was
[57:24] but now listen
[57:28] we're waiting the redemption of the body
[57:38] i'm not concerned about the world being
[57:40] made eternal that's a thousand years
[57:42] plus a short season and
[57:44] went on down and white throne and a
[57:46] whole bunch of things before this world
[57:48] gets eternalized right that's right
[57:52] i'm concerned about the redemption of
[57:54] this body that i'm dwelling in
[57:55] that's right and the older i get the
[57:58] more i'm concerned about it
[58:04] let's just read something here a couple
[58:06] of scriptures i know i'm not going to
[58:08] get done when i want to but
[58:10] go ahead we read hebrews
[58:14] 11 40 a lot but we ever read 39.
[58:26] verse 39 said and all these which means
[58:29] the above
[58:31] which is the old testament saints and
[58:33] the bride of crisis in the ground
[58:35] right right the grave wait
[58:40] and all these haven't obtained a good
[58:42] report through faith
[58:45] receive not the promise
[58:53] now you say but that
[58:56] that promise is only talking about that
[58:59] the old testament saints
[59:03] never came to anything until jesus
[59:06] christ came
[59:10] but you need to read
[59:14] amen they came to their place in faith
[59:22] kill the giants and the bearers in a
[59:24] different place
[59:28] haven't obtained a good report through
[59:30] faith receive not the promise what was
[59:33] the promise
[59:37] god hasn't provided some better thing
[59:40] for us
[59:44] not just the end time bride
[59:51] come on before the bride
[59:58] right that's right my brother dick says
[1:00:00] about it when
[1:00:02] when paul was standing there saying that
[1:00:06] he was saying without me
[1:00:13] but when he died he was having to say
[1:00:15] without us
[1:00:17] right he become one of them right he
[1:00:20] become one of them
[1:00:21] good point verse 40 god hadn't provided
[1:00:24] some better thing for us
[1:00:26] today without us should not be made
[1:00:28] perfect
[1:00:30] perfect complete finished full age
[1:00:34] all of the words
[1:00:37] see them they're waiting on us to bring
[1:00:39] to buy something that will
[1:00:44] bring together their perfection
[1:00:52] now going over to romans
[1:00:58] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:01:00] creature which is creation which is
[1:01:01] everybody
[1:01:02] that's not just world that's everybody
[1:01:05] that's right
[1:01:05] right everybody is waiting
[1:01:09] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:01:14] where the creature was made subject to
[1:01:15] vanity that's natural things
[1:01:17] all the way not willing to move but by
[1:01:19] reason of him which subjected the same
[1:01:20] and hope
[1:01:21] because the creature itself shall be
[1:01:23] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:01:25] into the glorious liberty of the
[1:01:26] children of god all right so it's going
[1:01:29] to happen
[1:01:30] for we know that the whole creation
[1:01:31] growth and prevailed and pained together
[1:01:33] until now
[1:01:37] why and not only they
[1:01:40] but ourselves also which have the first
[1:01:43] fruits of the spirit
[1:01:47] even we grown within ourselves
[1:01:50] waiting for the adoption to wit
[1:01:54] the redemption of the body
[1:01:58] that word to whip means to understand
[1:02:03] all right so paul peter and him
[1:02:06] didn't understand so now you are dealing
[1:02:09] with the endtime people
[1:02:13] that's right i emphasized while ago the
[1:02:15] us to make sure we didn't just
[1:02:17] well they were waiting waiting on them
[1:02:18] waiting on us no
[1:02:20] their connection was waiting on them
[1:02:22] right
[1:02:26] but now it's waiting on us
[1:02:29] we're the only people that can break the
[1:02:31] price
[1:02:33] this plan of redemption
[1:02:37] and to bring a device we must know what
[1:02:39] it is yes
[1:02:44] right right
[1:02:47] now right what the quotes we gave the
[1:02:49] other day
[1:02:50] look at 1b which is spoken words
[1:02:54] original seed
[1:02:55] paragraph 4 20 4 21.
[1:02:59] look what harmony jesus never did
[1:03:02] anything
[1:03:02] until sin of the father or the father
[1:03:04] showed him first
[1:03:06] harmony between god and christ see john
[1:03:08] 5 19
[1:03:09] so will the bride and he shows her
[1:03:13] his word of life
[1:03:16] he shows her and she receives it he
[1:03:19] never doubts it
[1:03:20] nothing can harm her not even death
[1:03:22] earth deceit is planted it's got to come
[1:03:24] forth
[1:03:25] here's the secret the word is in the
[1:03:27] bride and the mind of christ and know
[1:03:29] what
[1:03:29] he wants done with the word not sending
[1:03:31] her
[1:03:33] where it comes from from him right
[1:03:36] and she does it in his name she has thus
[1:03:38] saith the lord
[1:03:39] then it's dramatized but the holy spirit
[1:03:42] said you now thus saith the lord
[1:03:45] this says lord by stripes you're healed
[1:03:47] but if that ain't germanized
[1:03:49] that's right right
[1:03:52] we'll do any good right that's right she
[1:03:55] has it we've got the message
[1:03:59] we've got thus saith the lord by way of
[1:04:01] the prophet's message
[1:04:03] but we need a german diamond
[1:04:06] they do only his will i mean i believe
[1:04:08] that no one can persuade them different
[1:04:12] they don't go after the two souls the
[1:04:13] seventh on the verge of prove this ever
[1:04:16] all of those doctrines they have thus
[1:04:18] saith the lord
[1:04:19] or they keep stealing because those
[1:04:21] doctrines are not gonna save the lord
[1:04:24] then they will do the works of god so
[1:04:26] much
[1:04:28] for it is himself in them continuing his
[1:04:31] word
[1:04:32] to fulfill it is not me and you
[1:04:36] it is him in us amen to fulfill his word
[1:04:40] what as he did not complete in his day
[1:04:45] he didn't complete the full word mistake
[1:04:48] all things when he was here he did not
[1:04:51] complete all when he was here
[1:04:54] for it was not time yet
[1:04:57] they paid the price before he redeemed
[1:05:00] us
[1:05:01] he went through himself death burial
[1:05:04] resurrection
[1:05:05] ascension rapture
[1:05:08] but it wasn't made manifest to anyone
[1:05:11] else
[1:05:15] right you went up come back give the new
[1:05:18] birth
[1:05:20] all right
[1:05:23] you see he hasn't finished his work
[1:05:27] what he's going to do is through her
[1:05:29] look at the next one
[1:05:32] this is the church age book or page 172
[1:05:35] those that degrade the only his will no
[1:05:38] one can make them do otherwise
[1:05:39] they have thyself the order they keep
[1:05:41] still they know that it has to be god in
[1:05:43] them doing the works
[1:05:45] fulfilling his own word now they know
[1:05:47] that we ought to realize that
[1:05:49] he did not complete all his work while
[1:05:51] in his earthly ministry
[1:05:52] so now he works in and through the right
[1:05:56] she knows that for it was not yet time
[1:05:59] for him to do certain things
[1:06:01] and he must now do but he will now
[1:06:04] fulfill truly
[1:06:05] bride the work which he left for this
[1:06:07] specific time
[1:06:09] what is that to bring about a change of
[1:06:11] the body
[1:06:15] right to preach redemption
[1:06:20] bring the redemption our life's
[1:06:23] redemption
[1:06:24] is what
[1:06:28] what does first corinthians 15 26 say
[1:06:31] the last enemy that shall be destroyed
[1:06:36] is what death
[1:06:40] so when somebody takes a change they're
[1:06:42] going to be no more death
[1:06:46] so it'll take place all right all right
[1:06:52] let me get something here i know i won't
[1:06:55] be able to finish the message this
[1:06:57] morning but let me get a point
[1:06:59] to you
[1:07:02] that i want you to see
[1:07:08] you think i'm just repeating and i keep
[1:07:10] doing it and i do keep doing it because
[1:07:12] i want you to see it
[1:07:14] those first four seals has got a symbol
[1:07:17] written with them
[1:07:18] one horse red horse black horsepower
[1:07:22] the fifth seal doesn't have a symbol
[1:07:26] it is a reality or a statement
[1:07:29] of these people the sixth seal
[1:07:34] it doesn't have a symbol right
[1:07:38] yeah it says earthquake
[1:07:43] really under the sixth seal it does not
[1:07:46] even bring into reality
[1:07:49] the redemption 144 000 reading just to
[1:07:51] seal itself right
[1:07:54] so we know that we're dependent upon the
[1:07:56] prophet to come
[1:07:57] to tell us the symbols of the seal
[1:08:01] and we know then by him coming to give
[1:08:03] us
[1:08:04] to show us the symbols and then he would
[1:08:06] have the capability
[1:08:08] of telling us who it is under that field
[1:08:10] seal
[1:08:11] and it always poses with all mankind
[1:08:16] and he would be able to tell us about
[1:08:18] the sixth seal and the redemption
[1:08:22] not even having a symbol to work from
[1:08:24] but having the fact that the scripture
[1:08:26] says
[1:08:26] it he would take that scripture
[1:08:30] and god would reveal to him what that
[1:08:33] scripture was
[1:08:38] see the prophet had to tell us this time
[1:08:40] amen
[1:08:42] you agree the prophet had to tell us
[1:08:47] all the way up to what we're talking
[1:08:49] about now
[1:08:52] even got to a place that he now symbols
[1:08:54] to deal with
[1:08:58] so we dealt with the word
[1:09:01] of the lord coming to him
[1:09:07] right symbols one two three four
[1:09:12] five six no symbol
[1:09:15] writing in the scriptures but yet having
[1:09:18] to be a prophet to know what that's
[1:09:20] saying
[1:09:21] right
[1:09:24] raise it greater than symbols right amen
[1:09:27] but you got a symbol you got something
[1:09:29] to look at
[1:09:34] when you got it coming straight to him
[1:09:37] and he said
[1:09:38] i've never saw this before right
[1:09:43] and he told us what happened on that
[1:09:44] fifth ceiling that it was
[1:09:47] took it back into the bible to prove it
[1:09:50] sit sealed he took it into the bible
[1:09:54] to see it all right
[1:09:59] and when he did
[1:10:03] he gave us his revelation
[1:10:06] right right right
[1:10:10] well nobody else didn't have it now we
[1:10:13] baptist used to read the sixth seal
[1:10:15] and i've heard him preach about it and
[1:10:17] say that's a tribulation
[1:10:18] because you could read it you know the
[1:10:20] great earthquakes the great thing
[1:10:22] we didn't know what's going on you know
[1:10:25] that clark's larkin before brother brown
[1:10:27] come on the scene first larkin said the
[1:10:30] white horse rider was the antichrist
[1:10:39] that didn't mean he understood fully
[1:10:41] what the word was saying did
[1:10:44] he just said what he believed
[1:10:47] because he couldn't prove it because
[1:10:48] he's probably trinitarian
[1:10:54] but now we come to the seventh seal
[1:11:00] and they're silence in heaven
[1:11:08] charlotte's in heaven
[1:11:11] going to quote number two
[1:11:15] i added those one two three four on this
[1:11:19] abc's from wins when i had their
[1:11:21] wednesday wednesday preach on me but
[1:11:23] look at what the prophet said paragraph
[1:11:25] 241
[1:11:27] the four and 20 elders that stood before
[1:11:30] god
[1:11:34] they're harping with their hearts
[1:11:39] you remember where that's at
[1:11:44] that's in chapter five right four coming
[1:11:47] up and into five
[1:11:48] right okay they quit play in their
[1:11:54] hearts it was
[1:11:55] angels there they were um 24 elders no
[1:11:59] revelations four and five angels
[1:12:02] hustlers singing in heaven
[1:12:04] think the holy cherubims and serve them
[1:12:06] now isaiah saw in the temple with six or
[1:12:08] three sets of wings
[1:12:09] and over his face and the thing and they
[1:12:11] walked and said holy holy holy
[1:12:13] no syrup films pushed up
[1:12:17] angels quit singing we
[1:12:21] flying in the presence of god singing
[1:12:23] holy holy holy
[1:12:24] they just stop
[1:12:33] no angels singing
[1:12:36] no praises
[1:12:39] no alder service i sound like earth
[1:12:45] but you gotta remember in heaven
[1:12:52] don't get the idea nothing ain't taking
[1:12:54] place on earth
[1:12:58] why would they stand in all if something
[1:13:00] would take place somewhere
[1:13:02] okay
[1:13:06] this is going to be a little bit ahead
[1:13:08] of time
[1:13:10] doesn't mean about the authors here
[1:13:11] because they know all the services in
[1:13:13] heaven
[1:13:14] they're the altars and they just
[1:13:15] everything in heaven throngs
[1:13:19] there were silence hushed deadly silence
[1:13:21] in heaven
[1:13:22] for half hour all the host of heaven was
[1:13:25] solid for this half hour
[1:13:28] with the celestial mystery in the book
[1:13:30] of redemption was broke open
[1:13:33] think of it but it's broke now why does
[1:13:37] people keep saying it's not broke
[1:13:39] i know what he's talking about when he
[1:13:40] said it's not broke to the public
[1:13:43] and there will be broke to the public
[1:13:52] but it's broke the land breaks it you
[1:13:54] know what they were all
[1:13:55] done right
[1:13:59] right i believe they didn't know
[1:14:03] something they didn't know there it was
[1:14:06] they just stopped why what is it
[1:14:11] silence in heaven
[1:14:15] now silence in heaven
[1:14:22] the great silence right why would there
[1:14:26] be such a silence
[1:14:32] why would he come to a space of about
[1:14:34] half an hour
[1:14:37] it could be silence
[1:14:40] now remember what you're seeing this is
[1:14:42] in heaven
[1:14:48] there was silence
[1:14:52] in heaven but something made
[1:14:56] them go silent right amen
[1:15:01] that's what i want to know don't you i
[1:15:04] want to know why
[1:15:06] silence would be in heaven
[1:15:13] let's don't get too over joyous about
[1:15:15] what's on earth right exactly yet
[1:15:18] okay because you're going to find out
[1:15:21] something in a minute that's going to be
[1:15:23] surprising i guess
[1:15:30] but there was silence in heaven
[1:15:38] didn't say this knowledge on earth
[1:15:42] silence in heaven
[1:15:48] this seventh seal
[1:15:52] he's dealing with what happened in
[1:15:53] heaven
[1:15:58] whereas the other six seals deals with
[1:16:02] what takes place on earth
[1:16:05] time wise etc
[1:16:10] silence in heaven
[1:16:18] let's get one more quote and then we'll
[1:16:20] quit
[1:16:22] number three paragraph 43 the seventh
[1:16:25] seal
[1:16:29] our heavenly father he's praying he said
[1:16:31] here comes that great night
[1:16:33] a great hour that when a great thing has
[1:16:35] happened
[1:16:38] remember that we'll be back to it
[1:16:41] he's been all around the people
[1:16:46] and father i pray that tonight that will
[1:16:49] be made known be under shadow of a doubt
[1:16:50] to the people's hearts and minds
[1:16:52] that they know that god is still on the
[1:16:54] throne
[1:16:56] everybody wants him to leave the drama
[1:17:00] and he still loves his people and it's
[1:17:03] the hour
[1:17:04] hour that the world has longed to see
[1:17:12] the world is long to see
[1:17:16] is now approaching or it cries out for
[1:17:20] redemption
[1:17:22] we see the elements ready to bring it
[1:17:24] back we see the elements ready to bring
[1:17:25] the church into the presence of christ
[1:17:29] we can see the the right taking on the
[1:17:31] form
[1:17:32] where you're wetting gargano making
[1:17:34] ready we can see the lights are
[1:17:35] flickering
[1:17:36] we know that we're to end
[1:17:40] the heavenly father as this goes forward
[1:17:43] now to preach on
[1:17:44] to teach on this great mighty event that
[1:17:47] taken place in glory
[1:17:50] some 2000 years ago
[1:17:53] and was given to the great beloved
[1:17:55] apostle john and tonight we're to speak
[1:17:58] more upon him
[1:17:59] let the holy spirit come forward now in
[1:18:01] his mighty power and revolution
[1:18:04] he might reveal to us that thing which
[1:18:07] he wants
[1:18:07] us to know
[1:18:11] now he says this silence in heaven
[1:18:16] was a silence on earth and that's what i
[1:18:18] said everybody's trying to figure out
[1:18:20] how long
[1:18:22] 20 years old ain't that something but
[1:18:25] where do we start
[1:18:26] with it you know
[1:18:33] it says silence in heaven
[1:18:41] he said he gave it to his apostle to
[1:18:42] bring it to her with cover this
[1:18:44] afternoon
[1:18:45] that that's the order he forgot to give
[1:18:47] it to john john had to give it
[1:18:49] sent it down to it early on enjoy
[1:18:53] right but remember this took place in
[1:18:56] glory
[1:18:57] 2 000 years ago
[1:19:02] what happened in glory 2 000 years ago
[1:19:16] you see now here's where you're gonna go
[1:19:19] outside and talk
[1:19:25] and i'd come back and listen this
[1:19:26] afternoon
[1:19:31] because i want to make a nice statement
[1:19:35] there were silence in heaven when all
[1:19:37] seven seals broke
[1:19:48] i said it the way i want it to
[1:19:55] he says just under the seventh seal
[1:19:56] we'll eventually get bound to knowing
[1:19:58] what that means
[1:20:04] but there was silence in heaven when the
[1:20:06] first seal broke
[1:20:16] are you thinking with me i'll ask you a
[1:20:20] question and i wrote down
[1:20:22] a very serious question
[1:20:25] did anybody know
[1:20:29] anything about these seagulls until the
[1:20:32] prophet came
[1:20:35] now come on reading it we can see this
[1:20:38] reading it we could talk about that
[1:20:40] we bad just could talk about a six seal
[1:20:41] tribulation but was there anybody that
[1:20:44] had the mystery
[1:20:46] of redemption before this prophet came
[1:20:53] did anybody know what these seals are
[1:20:55] before the prophet came
[1:21:05] okay
[1:21:09] we only make silence in heaven when the
[1:21:11] seventh seal is broken
[1:21:14] we'll show this afternoon it run around
[1:21:15] and said until that seventh seal is
[1:21:17] broke
[1:21:19] we're only presuming
[1:21:28] he knew that the first before he started
[1:21:32] that's a statement i'm thinking out of
[1:21:35] the breach
[1:21:41] because he knew nobody knew what the
[1:21:43] plan of redemption was
[1:21:47] it was going to be revealed to him that
[1:21:49] week
[1:21:52] he was going to bring it
[1:22:01] see we only look at one seal
[1:22:07] and you that heard the seals only years
[1:22:09] ago know one thing for certain
[1:22:11] there is not but one seal to be broken
[1:22:13] in time
[1:22:14] amen
[1:22:17] and the holy spirit is that steel amen
[1:22:23] there is no seal apart from the holy
[1:22:25] spirit ephesians 4 30.
[1:22:34] all six seals broke in glory
[1:22:38] and they're silence and to the world
[1:22:42] it's still silent
[1:22:44] to the little bride of christ he's
[1:22:46] beginning to catch on
[1:22:50] is he having the first healers on earth
[1:22:52] well that's what i just said
[1:23:00] but the silence is in heaven
[1:23:05] now brother dale are you saying that for
[1:23:08] 2 000 years it's been solace in heaven
[1:23:11] well he said this took place 2000 years
[1:23:18] ago
[1:23:23] see 2 000 years ago and glory john saw
[1:23:26] the plan of redemption
[1:23:28] nobody couldn't see it
[1:23:31] until now this time
[1:23:37] take on these things
[1:23:41] you're just confusing what's confusing
[1:23:44] you know what's confusing see you got
[1:23:47] your own idea
[1:23:49] right and you're not listening to anyone
[1:23:52] else
[1:23:52] talk about the word
[1:24:01] right
[1:24:05] you got your own idea about what this
[1:24:07] thing is
[1:24:11] you take silence in heaven
[1:24:16] just mentioned high five
[1:24:19] but a random even gave a quote in his
[1:24:21] early ministry of that you know what he
[1:24:23] said
[1:24:23] he said the reason is silence in heaven
[1:24:25] for supposed to have an hour
[1:24:26] he said there's nothing up there
[1:24:33] the moment you heard that he said
[1:24:35] there's nothing up there
[1:24:40] what silence
[1:24:43] but then when you go away today you
[1:24:46] remember what i said
[1:24:47] i remember it this way
[1:24:52] that first seal was not revealed back
[1:24:56] there
[1:24:58] right
[1:25:04] you begin to come in to a
[1:25:07] time on the earth that the things could
[1:25:09] be made manifest
[1:25:11] yet but no one knew
[1:25:19] what that white horse rider was
[1:25:23] until the prophet spoke to revelation
[1:25:28] so there was silence in heaven for 2 000
[1:25:30] years
[1:25:36] now why don't you calculate your
[1:25:38] backwards
[1:25:40] you figure out a height of 30 minutes
[1:25:42] equals out of 21 years or something like
[1:25:44] that
[1:25:45] breaking it down to so much time for
[1:25:46] this and so much time for that but just
[1:25:48] remember it said about a day so you
[1:25:50] goofed up
[1:25:50] don't you go back the other way
[1:25:55] you realize 2 000 years on earth it's
[1:25:58] been
[1:26:00] about 30 minutes
[1:26:03] in heaven don't you count that way
[1:26:09] it's been about 30 minutes up in heaven
[1:26:14] that's not a long time
[1:26:18] if you're rejoicing
[1:26:22] if you're in a state of suspense it's a
[1:26:23] long time
[1:26:28] see we have a lot of things that we can
[1:26:30] cover on the seventh seal that
[1:26:34] where the prophet will call it those
[1:26:35] seven thunders you call it the coming of
[1:26:38] the lord
[1:26:44] but yet we say we don't know what it is
[1:26:47] we can say what he said
[1:26:52] and the only way you're going to know
[1:26:55] what the first seal is
[1:26:57] is to say what he said
[1:27:06] right
[1:27:10] see doing away totally with her own
[1:27:13] concepts but i get right to think
[1:27:19] that's what brought us into this
[1:27:21] situation we're in
[1:27:23] that's what brought death with this
[1:27:26] thinking
[1:27:28] so we keep on thinking we're going to
[1:27:29] keep on dying
[1:27:33] and you and i ain't got much time a lot
[1:27:35] of us ain't got much time to
[1:27:36] afford to lose you know it
[1:27:44] nigga's aunt died the other day burying
[1:27:46] her today
[1:27:48] he was 97 years old
[1:27:51] there's people now 100 years old
[1:27:55] but you know what there's a lot of
[1:27:58] people dead at 16.
[1:28:02] so we don't have no time to fool around
[1:28:04] church
[1:28:06] when are we going to get down go ahead
[1:28:08] 161
[1:28:09] inspirable 161 anybody have a need
[1:28:23] anybody have a name
[1:28:47] you know that's one of the things that's
[1:28:49] like her sister was saying about pain
[1:28:51] see the pain that i've been through
[1:28:53] makes me able to sympathize
[1:29:08] is
[1:29:22] is
[1:29:53] but i feel hurt
