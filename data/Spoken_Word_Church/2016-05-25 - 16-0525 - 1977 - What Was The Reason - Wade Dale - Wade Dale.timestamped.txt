[1:12] all right also remember june just called
[1:14] her mom
[1:15] pray that we get her in rehab now in the
[1:17] oaks in gainesville they're talking they
[1:19] were talking about putting her in
[1:20] atlanta and
[1:21] that's too far away for june to have to
[1:22] go so pray that they
[1:24] she's already been in the oaks one time
[1:27] uh when they rehabbed her
[1:28] niece so so they replaced one of her
[1:32] hips
[1:33] on monday and she's had a real tough
[1:34] time june's probably had
[1:36] 10 hours sleep in three days so just um
[1:39] but she sounded okay she said tell
[1:41] everybody hello
[1:42] and just keep praying for that and
[1:43] number one that they'll bring her into
[1:45] the oaks
[1:46] for her rehab this will be a lot closer
[1:48] the oaks is here in gainesville
[1:50] instead of putting her somewhere way
[1:51] down in atlanta where june can't get to
[1:53] her so
[1:54] but good to be in the house of the lord
[1:55] if you got your bibles let's turn to
[1:57] i was telling the brothers in the back
[2:00] you know when you put
[2:01] titles to things and you put them online
[2:04] usually that's
[2:05] it gets a it gets a bigger
[2:08] hit when you when you put something on
[2:10] there you know a little mysterious
[2:13] so we're gonna we're gonna try to
[2:15] tonight
[2:16] speak on something i've never heard
[2:18] anybody speak on before brother dale a
[2:19] little bit
[2:20] but 1977 what was the reason
[2:26] 1977 what was
[2:29] the reason because something did happen
[2:31] in 1977
[2:32] right exactly but i don't think
[2:34] anybody's really tried to explain
[2:36] it but we've come to place now i think
[2:38] and uh
[2:40] brother bob can tell you and some of the
[2:41] ones brother louise has been down in the
[2:42] sunday school class that
[2:44] uh this old testament has opened up a
[2:46] lot more since we've been going through
[2:47] daniel 70 weeks
[2:49] and it has just absolutely just blown us
[2:52] away the things we found
[2:54] and there's a couple more things brother
[2:55] bob that we found last night
[2:57] that uh you know i said about had a
[2:59] kicking fit sitting in the
[3:00] sitting in the recliner so it's uh
[3:03] it's one of those things that you you
[3:06] sometimes you i told brother claude one
[3:08] time i said brother claude he said well
[3:09] i feel like i hadn't even preached i
[3:10] said
[3:11] you'll get your anointing when you get
[3:12] it fresh
[3:14] when you're studying and god brings
[3:16] something to you brother richard and you
[3:17] can put it down on paper
[3:18] that you know what you're talking about
[3:20] you know that you can get it to the
[3:21] people
[3:22] to me that's the greatest anointing i
[3:24] can feel like i hadn't preached to
[3:25] nobody tonight
[3:26] and and still that anointing that i had
[3:30] i'm
[3:30] depending on that because now it's not
[3:32] on me it's on you
[3:34] it's not on me i'm a servant i serve
[3:36] what you actually want
[3:39] me to preach tonight so and same way
[3:41] with all the other ministers it's not
[3:42] just one it's everybody
[3:44] all right so leviticus 25
[3:47] verse eight we're going to read this
[3:48] scripture then you can be seated and
[3:50] we're going to read some quotes so
[3:52] just pray for us tonight uh let me
[3:55] tell you uh beforehand that uh we're not
[3:58] trying to set any dates or times
[4:00] or or anything like that but for those
[4:02] of you that's been in the sunday school
[4:03] class downstairs we went through some
[4:06] dates and i believe that we can see the
[4:08] time that we're living in
[4:10] and that we can dig deeper in that onion
[4:12] peel you know you keep peeling the onion
[4:14] back it's the same onion but
[4:15] brother luis you peel another layer off
[4:17] and there's another layer you peel
[4:18] another layer off there's a thin layer
[4:20] you can see that
[4:22] what's going on in the word of god so i
[4:24] know we all have unspoken requests
[4:27] um every time i raise my hand and say
[4:29] god save my children
[4:31] you know it's like uh i was telling
[4:35] somebody sunday they were asking about
[4:38] praying and i said
[4:39] jim said something the other day said we
[4:41] need to pray for our children i said no
[4:44] stop stop
[4:48] brother bryan said you'll pray something
[4:49] off of them that god's put on them you
[4:51] put them in god's hands
[4:53] and if it gets worse brother dale's told
[4:55] us many times we try to reach out
[4:58] and pull them back when we give them to
[5:00] the lord
[5:02] if abraham would have looked at his
[5:04] circumstances through his journey
[5:06] the promise would have never come to
[5:09] pass
[5:10] but brother brown said he looked so far
[5:11] into the future that he could see the
[5:13] baby
[5:13] in his hands so i see my children in
[5:16] church
[5:17] regardless of what it is save my
[5:19] children that's all i can tell you can't
[5:20] say bless your children
[5:24] not if they're out there in the world of
[5:25] sin now if they're in the infinite
[5:26] church full of the holy ghost yeah
[5:27] it will bless you but if you turn them
[5:30] over to god you leave them alone
[5:31] amen if they go through a bad time
[5:33] you're just gonna have to refrain
[5:35] right but you're gonna have to have more
[5:37] faith then really i think than being
[5:38] then the faith you would have to pray
[5:40] for him
[5:41] do you understand what i'm saying
[5:43] because it's easy to pray and say oh
[5:44] lord you know you
[5:45] and brother brown said he said i have to
[5:47] even watch he said if god put something
[5:49] on somebody and i take it off he said
[5:50] i'm in trouble with god
[5:52] so you get more trouble than they do so
[5:54] leave them alone i just say when i
[5:56] you know everybody says somebody says
[5:58] well if you've got any unspoken requests
[6:00] save my children save my children it
[6:02] doesn't matter
[6:04] i want them saved glory i want them
[6:06] saved sanctified and filled with the
[6:07] holy ghost
[6:08] amen so turn them over to god
[6:11] and let it be all right don't hold on to
[6:15] them
[6:16] mama tried to save me for 20 years she
[6:19] couldn't do it
[6:20] god's the only person that can save your
[6:22] soul he's the only one who can save your
[6:24] children's soul
[6:25] so turn him over to god and let him go
[6:28] and believe that that promise
[6:31] like he made to abraham that one day is
[6:33] going to come to pass amen
[6:34] long as there's breath in my body i'm
[6:36] praying for my kids just to be saved
[6:39] save my children then after that god can
[6:41] put the blessings on them
[6:42] i don't have to bless them god's going
[6:43] to bless them out of the scripture by
[6:45] the word of god right
[6:46] okay so let's just just a few things to
[6:48] think about there but let's buy our
[6:49] heads and
[6:51] and speak to the author to heavenly
[6:53] father we pray tonight lord that
[6:55] he would bless us in a special way lord
[6:57] we've come to a place now we're
[6:59] heading toward the end of time and
[7:02] things are getting short
[7:04] but father you told us that you
[7:06] pressurized us especially for this time
[7:09] you put astronauts in space or man put
[7:11] astronauts in space
[7:13] they were pressurized for the job well i
[7:15] believe that we're pressurized for the
[7:17] job tonight
[7:18] i believe we are pressurized for this
[7:21] journey
[7:23] father you've already seen the end
[7:27] so you know what's going to happen but
[7:29] we don't
[7:31] and we have to believe in your word
[7:33] where it says
[7:35] by your stripes were healed
[7:38] that you will be there with your
[7:39] offspring all those great promises that
[7:41] we have lord
[7:43] one day they're gonna come to pass and
[7:46] we're not one to set dates
[7:49] but there will be a day when this thing
[7:50] ends
[7:52] there will be a day when we go in a
[7:54] rapture
[7:55] and we'll be gone out of here in a
[7:57] jubilee
[7:59] our jubilee began at at the day of our
[8:02] pentecost when we received the holy
[8:03] ghost but there's going to be a jubilee
[8:04] of this land
[8:06] where we're all going to be able to rest
[8:08] and not have to worry about the things
[8:10] of the world
[8:11] father forgive us of our sins and our
[8:13] many mistakes
[8:14] save the lost blessed ones that are here
[8:17] tonight lord
[8:19] fill them more with the holy ghost let
[8:22] us see more of your word
[8:24] and let all things be done decently and
[8:27] in order
[8:29] for we ask these things in the name of
[8:30] jesus christ
[8:32] amen tell you what i've been enjoying
[8:35] the sunday school now whether y'all

[9:10] tells you what the world's looking for
[9:14] but greater is he is in us glory than he
[9:16] that's in the world
[9:18] leviticus 25 8 we're going to read the
[9:19] scripture sit down we're going to read
[9:20] some quotes and then we're going to go
[9:21] back to this scripture a little bit
[9:23] and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of
[9:25] years unto thee seven times seven years
[9:28] and the space of the seventh sabbath of
[9:30] years shall be unto thee
[9:32] forty and nine years times 7
[9:36] is what 49 all right
[9:39] 49 years then shalt thou cause the
[9:42] trumpet of the jubilee to sound
[9:44] on the 10th day of the seventh month now
[9:45] it gives you a day
[9:47] right and a month
[9:50] amen all right gives you a day and a
[9:53] month
[9:55] and it is the day of atonement everybody
[9:57] see that
[9:58] right it's on the tenth day of the
[10:00] seventh month which is tesry
[10:02] in the which is our october remember
[10:05] their calendar begins
[10:07] in april their religious calendar begins
[10:11] in april
[10:13] listen listen one okay there there
[10:16] so you're in the middle of the year in
[10:18] october here in the day of atonement
[10:20] is everybody all right with that right
[10:22] okay all right so
[10:23] their year is not like our year that
[10:26] this is the this is the fall
[10:28] on the day of atonement all right the
[10:30] 10th day of the seventh month
[10:32] and the day of atonement shall you make
[10:33] the trumpet sound throughout
[10:35] all your land and you shall hallow the
[10:38] fiftieth year
[10:39] and proclaim liberty throughout all the
[10:41] land and to all the inhabitants
[10:43] thereof it shall be a jubilee unto
[10:46] you and you shall return every man on
[10:50] his
[10:50] unto his possession and you shall return
[10:53] every man
[10:54] unto his family in other words the 50th
[10:56] year everything goes to zero
[10:59] there's no rich people in the next year
[11:02] we're all
[11:02] equal amen if you sold a piece of land
[11:05] if you were still alive in that 50th
[11:07] year
[11:08] you got it back everything comes back
[11:10] all right
[11:11] and a jubilee shall that fiftieth year
[11:14] be unto you you shall not sow
[11:16] or reap that which growth of itself so
[11:18] it's not just for the people
[11:20] it's for the land i told them downstairs
[11:23] this is where
[11:24] man got crop rotation amen in the
[11:27] natural crop
[11:28] you rotate your crops remember way back
[11:30] a long time ago they planted cotton
[11:31] cotton cotton cotton
[11:33] and it burnt the land up and that's why
[11:35] you got these big gullies because of the
[11:37] wash and all that because now they use
[11:40] crop rotation where they rotate the
[11:41] crops
[11:42] in and out they plant peas one year
[11:44] because peas has nitrogen
[11:45] they till them up in the soil and then
[11:46] they plant corn if you plant corn every
[11:48] year it's just going to get smaller and
[11:50] smaller so god knew how to do it
[11:52] before man ever thought about it a
[11:54] jubilee shall that fiftieth be unto you
[11:56] and you shall not sow nor reap
[11:58] that which growth of itself itself in it
[12:01] nor gather the grapes in it of thy
[12:03] vineyard undressed for it is the jubilee
[12:06] it shall be holy unto you you shall eat
[12:09] the
[12:10] increase thereof of the field in the
[12:12] year of this jubilee
[12:13] you shall return every man unto his
[12:16] possession it's just
[12:17] it reckons it right back okay so
[12:19] everybody sit down now
[12:21] we'll get started trying to take my time
[12:23] a little bit here
[12:24] if that's all right because i'm going to
[12:27] read you a few quotes
[12:29] maybe this will help the ones that in
[12:30] the sunday school class
[12:33] but also will help some of you maybe uh
[12:35] kind of skip through the
[12:37] some of the things we've been studying
[12:39] on but we have we have been on daniel 70
[12:41] weeks now for
[12:42] 20 some odd weeks and man it's been a
[12:45] blessing to me
[12:47] um i thought i thought i knew something
[12:49] about daniel 70 weeks until i got into
[12:51] this and started looking at it
[12:53] in a jewish in a jewish view
[12:56] because remember it is to them the 70
[12:59] weeks of daniel is not to the gentiles
[13:02] but the 70 weeks of daniel is to the
[13:05] jews
[13:06] and the city the land and it all
[13:09] connects back
[13:10] so we're going to read something to
[13:11] today that that we found
[13:13] last night that really blessed our heart
[13:16] maybe it'll help
[13:17] at least help some of you there in the
[13:18] sunday school class but condemnation by
[13:20] representation let's just read a few of
[13:22] these quotes because look
[13:24] 1977 what was the reason
[13:27] why did brother branham keep repeating
[13:29] 1977
[13:30] there was 10 times in the message he
[13:32] talked about 1977.
[13:35] now several of them were pertaining to
[13:37] the visions that he had
[13:40] right that's right but there was only
[13:42] there was one time
[13:44] he tied it to a scripture and we just
[13:46] read it leviticus is 25
[13:48] 8. brother brown talks about all these
[13:49] prophecies coming to pass between
[13:51] 1933 when he had divisions in 1977 but
[13:54] he never tied it to the bible
[13:57] until in the 70th week of daniel he tied
[14:00] it into the bible
[14:02] right in leviticus 25 8. is that all
[14:05] right
[14:06] all right so we're going to read a few
[14:07] of them where he didn't but we're going
[14:08] we're going to see that
[14:10] when he comments watch what he says
[14:12] condemnation by representation 1960
[14:15] 11 13. he's talking about divisions
[14:19] let's go on down
[14:22] to where i've got the uh to the
[14:23] highlight
[14:26] because it comes to the very last one he
[14:27] said then i seen the united states as
[14:29] one smoldering burn over place
[14:32] it will be near the end now remember
[14:33] this is 1960 because i'm going to tell
[14:35] you something in a minute
[14:36] and you you catch what he's talking
[14:38] about he talks about 1977
[14:42] way before that right all right watch
[14:45] then i say in the united states is one
[14:46] smoldering burn over place it will be
[14:49] near the end then i've got in
[14:52] parentheses i predict that this will
[14:53] take place now remember the lord
[14:56] that's what the lord showed but i
[14:58] predict this will take place before
[15:00] 1977.
[15:02] upon this prediction i base because of
[15:03] the on rushing slot that's coming now
[15:06] how fast it's moving how long it'll take
[15:08] till this nation
[15:09] meets this place so he's connecting it
[15:12] back to the seven visions that he had
[15:14] right everybody understand what seven
[15:15] visions are
[15:16] talks about uh mussolini hitler
[15:20] the maganal line or the siegfried line
[15:22] and the different things woman gets to
[15:24] vote
[15:24] woman in the white house are a woman in
[15:27] power
[15:28] and then the smoldering of the united
[15:30] states everybody got that
[15:32] amen are y'all here tonight okay just
[15:35] wondering didn't know
[15:36] somebody just looking maybe just came
[15:38] for entertainment
[15:41] 1960 11 25 conferences number two
[15:46] brother ryan said then i turned to look
[15:47] and i seen the united states with a
[15:49] smoldering something had burned it up
[15:51] and down beneath there i said not in the
[15:53] trance but i predict
[15:55] remember this i guess this is tape too i
[15:57] predict that these things will take
[15:59] place between now
[16:00] 1933 and 1977 which will give us 16 more
[16:04] years
[16:04] if my prediction strikes right from 1960
[16:07] to 77.
[16:09] all right so now let's go to number
[16:10] three get some of these out of the way
[16:12] because these are the ones he is
[16:14] predicting
[16:15] as he's telling the visions all right
[16:18] the ephesian church age this is in the
[16:20] church age book all right
[16:24] let's just read the uh
[16:27] because watch i want you to hold a point
[16:30] here and hold
[16:30] hold hold it right here now remember
[16:32] this is
[16:34] this is brother branham on the ephesian
[16:37] church age this
[16:38] is what he's talking about after the
[16:41] ephesians churches now he puts
[16:42] it the dates what's the date all the way
[16:45] down
[16:46] all the way down all the way down and at
[16:48] 1906 the laodicean
[16:50] church aid set in everybody got that say
[16:52] amen
[16:53] the odyssey in church a started in 1906
[16:56] and i don't know when it'll end but i
[16:59] predict it'll be
[17:00] done by 1977.
[17:04] what the loudest in church age exactly
[17:06] all right
[17:07] i predict not the lord told me but i
[17:09] predict now so it's not
[17:11] it's not according to a prophecy
[17:15] it's according to a prediction all right
[17:18] five of those things that come to pass
[17:19] already taken place all right let's go
[17:21] to
[17:25] brother pull up number four
[17:31] this is the layout to see in church age
[17:34] the other one was the ephesian this is
[17:36] the layout of sin now he's in the layout
[17:37] of sin church age so watch
[17:39] we believe that the loudest in church
[17:41] age church started
[17:42] in a.d 1906. i predict now remember
[17:45] predict
[17:47] especially you listening at the tape now
[17:49] remember this is before he preached
[17:50] daniel 70 weeks this is all before
[17:53] right before he preached daniel 70 weeks
[17:55] he's making a prediction
[17:57] all right i don't or he doesn't tie it
[18:00] to anything except
[18:01] the seven visions he didn't put it in
[18:03] the bible yet
[18:04] i don't say it will be but predict that
[18:07] it will end by 1977 that the church will
[18:10] go completely
[18:11] into apostasy and she'll be ousted out
[18:14] of the mouth of god
[18:15] and the second coming or the rapture of
[18:16] the church might come any time
[18:20] now i can miss it a year 20 years so
[18:22] he's really you know everybody's
[18:24] dwelled on 77 but brother branham really
[18:26] never
[18:28] prophesied that 1977 because obviously
[18:30] he'd have been a liar if he did
[18:32] if he prophesied but i want to show you
[18:34] something in just a minute
[18:37] he's talking about 1933 and 77 now let's
[18:40] go to number five
[18:42] which is 1961. this is the 70th week of
[18:46] daniel
[18:48] which is a a very it's very contentious
[18:52] in the message
[18:53] and i hope especially those of you that
[18:55] in the sunday school class know for a
[18:56] surety
[18:57] that there's one week left after the
[18:59] rapture according to the bible
[19:01] and according to the prophet's message
[19:04] there is one week left
[19:05] i don't care who you are and what your
[19:07] name is
[19:08] buddy i'm telling you this thing but now
[19:10] you say well you're just talking about
[19:11] something that's to the jews
[19:14] hang on a minute because brother branham
[19:17] said
[19:18] the jews was our timepiece
[19:22] we can tell time by the jews
[19:25] right all right if we can tell time by
[19:27] the jews
[19:28] there was something given to us to tell
[19:30] us a time
[19:32] because gentiles has no time right time
[19:35] shall be no longer
[19:36] one hand on one hand you know one foot
[19:38] on land one feeling see time should be
[19:39] no longer
[19:40] but in daniel 12 there was one man with
[19:42] one foot away one foot on c with both
[19:44] hands up in the air
[19:45] and it was for a time times and a
[19:47] dividing of time three and a half years
[19:49] all right so you had time here a
[19:51] striking statement now watch he's come
[19:53] now to daniel 70 weeks he's come to the
[19:56] 70th week
[19:57] look most people in the message
[20:00] don't think there's a 70th week it's a
[20:03] half of a 70th week
[20:08] according to the bible there's a week
[20:10] left right
[20:11] okay so brother brahm said face final
[20:14] resting places in the word of god
[20:16] take it back to the word of god always a
[20:19] striking
[20:20] statement now watch he's come to a place
[20:22] where he's in the 70th week he's at the
[20:24] last sermon
[20:26] and god has shown him something because
[20:28] he keeps talking about 77 77 77 77
[20:32] for the predictions but now watch he's
[20:34] going to take and turn it in
[20:36] put it in scripture put dates and put it
[20:39] in scripture
[20:40] a striking statement from the time god
[20:42] made the promise to abraham don't miss
[20:44] this
[20:44] from a time god made the promise to
[20:46] abraham genesis 12 3
[20:48] to the time of christ being rejected in
[20:50] a.d now that
[20:52] should be 80 30. we know that
[20:58] we know that if you've been downstairs
[20:59] in a sunday school class we've already
[21:00] proved it
[21:01] that's 80 30. because we're going to go
[21:04] and we're not going to read it tonight
[21:06] but in the seals we went to the seals
[21:07] and brother brown said jesus was killed
[21:09] in 80 30.
[21:10] okay i don't know what god put that in
[21:13] there to blind
[21:14] people i guess it sure has
[21:18] because you got to remember when we get
[21:20] to 1954 years brother branham says
[21:22] there's 1954 years
[21:24] that 3 430 years you can't put it in 80
[21:27] 30. right
[21:28] three you've got gotta have put it in 80
[21:29] 30. all right
[21:31] being rejected by by rejected in 1833 by
[21:34] the jews according to galatians 3 16
[21:36] 17 according to usher's chronology of
[21:39] the hebrews the power of god was with
[21:41] the jews exactly
[21:42] 1954 years god dealt with the jews 1954
[21:46] years according to chronology of the
[21:48] jews and according to galatians 3 16
[21:50] 17. got many more scriptures now
[21:52] counting the time we find that we have
[21:54] exactly
[21:54] listen 17 years left
[21:59] from 1961 to 77
[22:02] right because it was preaching 61 he's
[22:05] talking about 1977
[22:06] 17 years left and we will have the same
[22:08] span of time given to us as god dealing
[22:10] with us in the power of the holy spirit
[22:12] since 80 33 to 1977 which is 80 30.
[22:15] the same span of time 1954 years
[22:19] god dealing with us the same as he did
[22:20] with the jews see how about that now
[22:22] mark down in your book a little
[22:24] scripture now what's he doing he's
[22:26] fixing to take you into the bible
[22:28] okay all these others have been
[22:30] predictions and things that he saw
[22:33] we're going to read one in a minute
[22:34] where a long time ago
[22:38] when he said he went to the back of the
[22:40] tabernacle and said
[22:42] he draw the line and said i believe all
[22:43] these things will be finished by 1977.
[22:46] well that was a way long time ago
[22:49] so 1977 has been prevalent in the
[22:51] prophet's message not just recent
[22:53] right okay he's had that number in there
[22:56] but watch when he gets to that 70th week
[22:58] of daniel
[22:59] which is numbers and dates and times
[23:03] he puts it in the bible amen all right
[23:07] now mark down in your book a little
[23:08] scripture here i want to give you
[23:09] leviticus 25
[23:12] begin with the eighth verse god calls a
[23:15] jubilee every 49 years
[23:18] year the 50th year was the jubilee right
[23:21] we know that we understand that from the
[23:22] first jubilee of leviticus 25
[23:25] 8 in 1977 will be the 70th
[23:28] jubilee making exactly 3 430 years
[23:33] jubilee means to going up the release
[23:35] now
[23:36] somebody add up 1977
[23:40] because what is the jubilee 50.
[23:45] 50 times 70 is
[23:49] right he says 3 430
[23:53] right that's what they say is wrong
[23:56] a lot of people but you got to remember
[24:00] let's stop for just a second i've read a
[24:02] lot
[24:04] but a jubilee cycle is seven sevens is
[24:06] 49.
[24:09] your 50th year is not a 50th year
[24:14] your 50th year is the first year of your
[24:17] next 49 year cycle
[24:20] so
[24:23] 70 times 49
[24:30] 3 430 years he was exactly correct
[24:34] he knew what he was talking about
[24:36] because when we say jubilee
[24:38] we automatically think 49 and then a 50.
[24:42] that 50th year was the first year of the
[24:46] next 49 year cycle
[24:48] there was an overlap read your bible
[24:53] it tells you that and what blows my mind
[24:57] is it's it's a blowing of a trumpet on
[25:00] the day of atonement
[25:02] begins to jubilee amen which is the
[25:06] tenth day
[25:07] of the seventh month october
[25:16] it tells you the month and it tells you
[25:19] the day
[25:20] to start your jubilee year
[25:23] okay
[25:26] the words you believe as brother dale
[25:28] said many times means trumpet
[25:30] right the word you believe but it also
[25:33] means i looked it up last night
[25:34] it means the jubilee means ushering in
[25:38] the season of joy
[25:42] ushering in the season
[25:46] of joy wow
[25:49] from what we've been studying it just
[25:51] makes me have a jubilee
[25:53] amen will be the 70th jubilee
[25:58] right now plug this into the computer
[26:00] just real quick and then we're going to
[26:02] we're going to loop back because i want
[26:03] to show you something
[26:08] because watch him down here at the
[26:09] bottom
[26:11] he's going to make a he's going to make
[26:13] a prediction not a prophecy a prediction
[26:17] we've got 17 years left until 77 will be
[26:20] the 70th jubilee
[26:24] now 70th jubilee 70 times 49
[26:28] 3 430 all right since the beginning of
[26:30] jubilees
[26:31] and what will it be oh brother watch
[26:34] close now don't miss
[26:35] it it'll be the jubilee of the going up
[26:38] of the gentile bride
[26:40] and return of christ to the jews with a
[26:43] key point
[26:44] when they go out of bondage now they're
[26:47] not going to go out of bondage till we
[26:49] leave
[26:50] amen they're
[26:53] bound now right remember they're blinded
[26:57] until 144 000 come out they're blinded
[27:00] they're bound but watch
[27:06] 70th jubilee since the beginning of
[27:09] jubilees
[27:10] everybody got that now that jubilee is
[27:13] also means rest
[27:18] or the millennium
[27:22] the jews are looking for a millennium a
[27:25] jubilee year
[27:28] and this was so striking last night
[27:31] i was telling dad mom i went online and
[27:35] was looking at some commentaries
[27:37] whoo
[27:43] yeah thank you i i know it's okay so you
[27:45] don't have to tell me that
[27:47] brother branham read usher he read
[27:49] schmidt uriah smith he read
[27:52] larkin he read he went to the
[27:54] encyclopedia and got this
[27:58] remember he said told brother collins or
[27:59] whoever that was he's a brother i know
[28:01] why you brought those
[28:02] encyclopedias because he read them
[28:06] listen god will give you so much but he
[28:08] expects you to do a little bit
[28:10] right amen so we come to a place the
[28:13] 70th jubilee since the beginning of
[28:15] jubilees and
[28:16] and i tell you what struck my heart was
[28:21] there's no recorded history that the
[28:24] jews
[28:25] ever celebrated a jubilee year
[28:28] right
[28:32] never god told them in leviticus now
[28:35] where was leviticus they were getting
[28:36] ready to go in the promised land right
[28:37] or they were in the journey
[28:39] right they were in the journey god told
[28:42] them he said you
[28:44] we read leviticus 25 8. seven sabbaths
[28:47] you number seven sabbaths 49 years
[28:50] and on that 50th year you give
[28:52] everything back that you bought
[28:54] right a jew ain't going to do that
[29:00] sorry if there's any jewish people
[29:02] online
[29:03] but there's no recorded history i was
[29:05] reading the commentary there was no
[29:07] recorded history anywhere
[29:09] that because remember they were in the
[29:10] wilderness 40 years then they went into
[29:13] the promised land
[29:15] well that was 40 years not 49 they never
[29:18] made it to a jubilee year
[29:20] sure they went through it but they never
[29:23] celebrated a jubilee year they never
[29:26] celebrated that 50 where they give
[29:28] everything back they bought
[29:30] never recorded so god told them
[29:34] and um i found this the other night
[29:37] let's go now to
[29:39] second chronicles god put it in the
[29:41] bible
[29:42] amen he put it in the bible
[29:47] daniel 70 weeks is not just something
[29:49] that we brought up
[29:50] and daniel had this vision and oh gosh
[29:54] this is what's going to happen god
[29:57] already told them
[29:58] exactly we're going to read in
[30:00] chronicles and then we're going to read
[30:01] in leviticus
[30:02] keep reading in the leviticus where god
[30:05] told them what he was going to do
[30:08] in other words this is what he said he
[30:10] said if you won't
[30:12] celebrate the sabbath and if you won't
[30:14] let the land rest
[30:16] i'm going to make it rest
[30:21] guess how long 490 years
[30:29] was daniel 70 weeks 490 years
[30:33] and then that had escaped from the sword
[30:36] carried her away to babylon now this is
[30:37] the dispersion remember israel was
[30:39] dispersed
[30:40] right driven out of the they're driven
[30:42] out of jerusalem
[30:44] and the city was leveled
[30:47] because what is daniel 70 weeks it's
[30:50] calling them back
[30:52] rebuilding the city rebuilding the
[30:54] temple
[30:55] bringing the people in bringing the
[30:58] sacrifices back redeeming the people
[31:02] that's what daniel 9 24 is so it had to
[31:05] be all tore down
[31:06] you can't restore something that's
[31:08] already here you got to restore
[31:09] something
[31:10] that has fallen from here and then they
[31:13] had escaped from the sword carried
[31:14] away to babylon where they were servants
[31:16] to him and his sons
[31:17] until the reign of the kingdom of persia
[31:20] to fulfill the word of the lord by the
[31:22] mouth of jeremiah until the land
[31:27] he drove them out and made that land
[31:30] rest
[31:32] let me tell you something god's going to
[31:33] do what he said he's going to do glory
[31:35] until the land had enjoyed her sabbath
[31:38] he drove him out of the land and let the
[31:40] land sit there
[31:42] but look he won't forget him for as long
[31:45] as she
[31:46] lay desolate she kept sabbath
[31:49] to fulfill 70 years right
[31:52] that's how many years they were in
[31:54] captivity 70 years exactly
[31:57] remember daniel was 68th year he was
[31:59] getting ready to go out in two years he
[32:00] said god what are we going to do
[32:03] and god told him brother brown said god
[32:04] told him not only what was going to
[32:06] happen
[32:06] he told him all the way to the
[32:07] millennium right
[32:11] because daniel was serious about what he
[32:12] was doing maybe that's our problem we're
[32:15] not serious about what we're doing
[32:16] now in the first year of cyrus king of
[32:18] persia you remember that down in the
[32:19] sun's good class
[32:21] cyrus king of persia that the word of
[32:23] the lord spoken by the mouth of jeremiah
[32:25] might be accomplished the lord stirred
[32:26] up the spirit of cyrus king
[32:28] of persia that he made a proclamation
[32:29] throughout all his kingdom
[32:31] and put it also in writing saying thus
[32:33] saith cyrus king of persia all the
[32:35] kingdoms of the earth had the lord god
[32:36] of heaven given me
[32:38] because they persia ruled the whole
[32:40] whole world
[32:42] but god charged him to build a house in
[32:45] jerusalem which is in judea
[32:47] who is there among you of thee all his
[32:49] people the lord his god be with him and
[32:51] let him go now that was where
[32:53] that nehemiah i mean the ezra comes
[32:57] and says we need to rebuild the city
[32:59] then nehemiah
[33:01] is the one where if you've been studying
[33:04] our our lesson
[33:05] it wasn't the edict from ezra because
[33:07] that was like 5 30 something bc
[33:10] and it don't fit daniel 70 weeks began
[33:12] on 445 bc
[33:16] 445 bc when jeremiah i mean sorry
[33:19] i'm getting ahead of myself when
[33:21] nehemiah finished the wall in 52 days
[33:26] that's when daniel 9 24 says that thy
[33:29] holy city and the walls will be built
[33:30] even in trouble as times
[33:32] all right all right now let's go to that
[33:34] was chronicles let's now go to
[33:37] leviticus leviticus 26.
[33:42] so we went to leviticus 25 talk about
[33:44] 1977 because brother brown
[33:46] tied it back to leviticus 25 8.
[33:49] leviticus 26 32. watch this
[33:53] and i will now look he has finished
[33:56] telling them what he was going to do
[33:58] he told them all the sacrifices he give
[34:01] them all the feast days he told them to
[34:03] to make your sabbath 4
[34:06] 7 7 49 hallow the 50th let the
[34:10] land rest i'll give you three years of
[34:12] plenty all these things but watch
[34:14] he comes to the end and i will bring the
[34:18] land
[34:18] into desolation and your enemies which
[34:22] dwell therein shall be astonished at
[34:24] it and i will scatter you among the
[34:27] heathen he's going to
[34:28] he told them in leviticus he told them
[34:29] before they got in the promised land
[34:30] what he was going to do
[34:32] and i will scatter you among the heathen
[34:34] will draw out a sword after you and your
[34:37] land shall be desolate and your city's
[34:39] waste
[34:40] then shall the land enjoy her sabbath
[34:48] judy that's why daniel said in the weeks
[34:49] had to be it's not just that daniel 70
[34:51] weeks
[34:51] is a historical happening right god said
[34:54] land rest amen and if you don't do it
[34:58] i'm gonna do it
[34:59] that's what god says if you don't do it
[35:01] i'm going to do it then shall the land
[35:03] enjoy her sabbath as long as it lies
[35:06] desolate
[35:07] he knew if those jews stayed in that
[35:09] land they would not hallow that sabbath
[35:11] because they weren't going to give it
[35:12] back
[35:13] so he run him out of the city he run
[35:15] them out of the country
[35:19] then shall the land enjoy her sabbath or
[35:20] as long as it lies desolate and ye
[35:22] be in your enemy's land
[35:25] they were dispersed remember even then
[35:29] shall the land rest and enjoy her
[35:32] sabbath
[35:33] as long as it lies desolate it shall
[35:35] rest
[35:36] because it did not rest in your sabbath
[35:40] they didn't they didn't even hold one
[35:43] sabbath
[35:46] because look because it did not rest in
[35:48] your sabbaths when you dwelt
[35:50] upon it and upon them that are left
[35:54] alive of you i will send a faintness in
[35:56] their heart in the land of their enemies
[35:58] and the sound of a shaken leaf shall
[36:00] chase them
[36:01] and they shall flee as fleeing from a
[36:03] sword and they shall fall when none
[36:05] pursueth
[36:06] seems like god has just let them go and
[36:08] that's about all he's going to do
[36:09] no no remember israel is god's people
[36:13] amen and they shall fall one upon
[36:16] another as it were before a sword
[36:18] when none pursueth and you shall have no
[36:21] power to stand before your enemies
[36:26] even when jesus was on the earth they
[36:28] were looking for the messiah
[36:30] they were looking for somebody to take
[36:32] over and drive rome out of it out of
[36:34] jerusalem
[36:35] right and you shall perish among the
[36:38] heathen and the land of your enemies
[36:41] shall eat you up a lot of people died
[36:44] not in the promised land
[36:46] amen because of the transgression
[36:48] because watch
[36:49] because remember what is daniel 70 weeks
[36:51] make an end of sin
[36:52] reconciliation for iniquity remember
[36:55] these words
[36:56] because they're going to be in here in
[36:57] just a second and they that are left of
[36:59] you shall pine away in their iniquity
[37:03] in your enemy's land and also in the
[37:05] iniquity of their father shall they pine
[37:07] away with them
[37:09] if they shall confess their iniquity
[37:13] glory he's just jumped a long way
[37:18] in his prophecy if they shall confess
[37:21] their iniquity and the iniquity of their
[37:23] fathers
[37:24] and with the trespass which they
[37:25] trespassed against me
[37:27] and that also they have walked contrary
[37:30] unto me
[37:31] and that i also have walked contrary
[37:33] unto
[37:35] hmm them god talking you know and have
[37:38] brought them into the land of their
[37:40] enemies they were dispersed
[37:42] if then their uncircumcised hearts be
[37:44] humbled
[37:46] what's brother dale been talking about
[37:48] that ain't a heart
[37:50] right that draws blood that's the center
[37:53] of the person
[37:54] glory shall be humbled and they then
[37:56] accept of the punishment of their
[37:58] iniquity
[37:59] right where's the sixth full purpose
[38:02] is to bring the people restore the
[38:04] people and restore the city
[38:06] all right then will i remember my
[38:09] covenant with jacob
[38:10] and also my covenant with isaac and also
[38:12] my covenant with abraham will i remember
[38:14] and i will remember the land
[38:19] that's where people don't understand
[38:20] about daniel 70 weeks it's the people
[38:22] and the city now what does the city sit
[38:24] on land
[38:28] brother brown said the very what about i
[38:30] was telling them at sunscreen class
[38:31] brother brown said the very spot abraham
[38:33] took communion
[38:34] with melchizedek he was looking for a
[38:37] city and it was right up under his feet
[38:39] he said that's where the city is going
[38:41] to come down
[38:42] right where he was standing so the
[38:44] mountain's already underneath there
[38:46] right that's what he said
[38:50] and the land also shall be left of them
[38:52] and shall enjoy
[38:53] her sabbath while she like desolate
[38:56] without them
[38:57] and they shall accept of the punishment
[38:59] of their iniquity because even because
[39:01] they despise my judgment
[39:02] and because their soul afford my
[39:04] statutes and yet for all that
[39:08] you'd think he just forgot him and let
[39:09] him go brother gary just you know give
[39:11] him the
[39:11] left foot of fellowship you know and yet
[39:14] for all that
[39:15] when they be in the land of their enemy
[39:18] i will not cast them away because you
[39:20] know why
[39:21] he knew they were coming back he knew
[39:24] that he was going to make a promise that
[39:26] he was going to bring them right back
[39:27] into the land
[39:30] and they're there now amen
[39:33] in the 40s they started coming in i will
[39:36] not cast them away neither will i abhor
[39:38] them to destroy them utterly
[39:41] now he destroyed some of them but he's
[39:43] not going to destroy them utterly
[39:44] and to break my covenant with them from
[39:46] the lord like god but i will for their
[39:48] sakes
[39:50] remember the covenant of their ancestors
[39:52] amen
[39:53] whom i brought forth out of the land of
[39:55] egypt in the sight of the heathen that i
[39:57] might be their god
[39:59] i am the capital l rd amen
[40:02] so daniel 70 weeks is not just some
[40:04] happening in history
[40:08] god already spoke about it before daniel
[40:10] remember daniel read books
[40:13] he read jeremiah he read books
[40:17] brother brown said we understand by
[40:18] books right well guess what if i had a
[40:20] message book up here but this is a
[40:21] message quote
[40:22] we know by books amen
[40:27] but what about that god's already told
[40:29] him he said if you won't have a jubilee
[40:31] i'll make you have one right i'm going
[40:34] to let that land rest
[40:37] but we're coming back to a jubilee to
[40:40] where it's going to rest for eternity
[40:41] glory amen it's not going to rest for a
[40:44] while but when it does rest when that
[40:46] millennium
[40:47] it's going to rest for an eternity amen
[40:50] we know the millennium's in time but hey
[40:52] if you make it to the millennium
[40:54] you've made it to eternity amen
[40:58] right okay is everybody all right with
[41:00] that
[41:01] that just thrilled my soul that says
[41:03] find that scripture i'd read it many
[41:04] times before it hadn't even had it
[41:06] underlined but it
[41:07] even tells them for 70 years you're
[41:09] going to be in captivity so i can make
[41:11] this land have some sabbath
[41:15] and they stayed out of land 490 years
[41:17] that's kind of interesting isn't it
[41:20] and then he takes a heathen king
[41:23] cyrus of persia
[41:26] because remember if you'll remember what
[41:29] we were talking about in the sunscreen
[41:31] class
[41:32] those etics had to be written and signed
[41:35] by the king of that
[41:36] land because if you just went over to a
[41:39] place and started building buildings
[41:42] this other king might get mad at you and
[41:44] come over and start a war
[41:45] and destroy your land but if you have
[41:48] that
[41:50] paper that says cyrus
[41:53] sent me to rebuild this city then they
[41:56] were somewhat protected
[41:57] right all right so god knew because see
[41:59] he stirred up cyrus he didn't stir up
[42:01] nehemiah or jeremiah no he already had
[42:04] them they were already in the playing
[42:06] they were already in the play but he had
[42:09] to stir up somebody with power during
[42:11] that time
[42:12] to bring them to a place to where you
[42:15] can say hey
[42:16] i've got protection i can build a city
[42:19] because cyrus told me i could
[42:21] then it went from cyrus to darius and
[42:23] went over to
[42:24] to where nehemiah rebuilt the city we
[42:26] understand that everybody all right say
[42:28] amen
[42:29] all right so 1977 is real significant
[42:31] because
[42:34] brother branham takes it to a scripture
[42:36] all right
[42:37] so taking it to a scripture then i can
[42:39] take it
[42:40] silly old me and we can try to make it
[42:43] work
[42:45] and why in the world would it be the
[42:47] very time that brother brown was
[42:48] preaching daniel 70 weeks
[42:51] and telling us that these things can
[42:53] happen
[42:54] amen these things can happen and the
[42:57] things can
[42:58] uh can be that way because i'm gonna
[43:00] read you a quote here in just a second
[43:02] but we're gonna
[43:03] read one more time with daniel 70 weeks
[43:05] pull up number six
[43:07] because i want to read this again keep
[43:09] it fresh in your mind
[43:10] so we can turn the looks of the united
[43:14] states
[43:14] and here come around and shows and then
[43:16] i predict i never said the lord told me
[43:18] but standing that way here it is
[43:20] standing that morning in the church i
[43:22] said the way progress i got back to the
[43:24] end of the wall
[43:26] this is before this is something he
[43:27] preached before i got back to the wall
[43:30] and run to the other end of the wall and
[43:32] i said the way progress is going on
[43:34] i'll predict that the time i don't know
[43:37] why i'm saying it
[43:39] but i predict that they'll all happen
[43:41] between right now 33 and 77
[43:43] and not knowing that god knows my heart
[43:45] i never noticed until yesterday
[43:47] that 1977 is the jubilee
[43:50] exactly the same amount of time run out
[43:52] that he gave with israel and everything
[43:54] at the end so we're at and here we are
[43:56] at the end of the age
[43:58] at the coming end of the
[44:01] what so one more time
[44:05] did you say halfway oh
[44:09] oh a week is seven years if y'all didn't
[44:11] know that
[44:12] in the bible week equals seven years not
[44:15] three and a half
[44:18] at the coming in of the 70th week
[44:22] we don't know what time that the church
[44:23] will be gone
[44:25] oh my what can we do friends where are
[44:28] we at
[44:29] so he goes back to 77 is the jubilee now
[44:32] you say oh brother
[44:33] here you're gonna dive in well let's
[44:35] dive on in let's read quote number eight
[44:36] layout of sin church age
[44:39] this is one brother bob keeps in his
[44:41] keeps in his little
[44:42] file and and he plays it every once in a
[44:45] while so we can hear brother ram
[44:46] actually say it
[44:47] all right based on these seven visions
[44:50] along with the rapid change which have
[44:51] swept the world in the last 50 years i
[44:53] predict i do not prophesy
[44:54] that these visions will all come to pass
[44:56] by 1977. and though many may feel that
[44:58] this is an irresponsible statement in
[45:01] view of the fact that jesus said that no
[45:02] man know the day in her hour
[45:04] i still maintain this prediction after
[45:06] 30 years because jesus did not say
[45:09] no man could know the year month
[45:13] or week in which his coming
[45:17] was to be completed
[45:20] year month
[45:24] and week that's getting pretty close
[45:27] danger hours in a week's time that would
[45:30] be a day or an hour
[45:32] but if we can if you can because brother
[45:34] branham he talks about many times in
[45:35] daniel 70 weeks the 70th week the last
[45:37] one he preaches
[45:38] he talks about if we can get this
[45:41] correct
[45:42] we can know the weak exactly we can be
[45:44] close
[45:46] we've already took 77 downstairs as a
[45:49] marker
[45:50] but i want to show you something that
[45:51] happened in 1977 it was before 77
[45:54] actually
[45:54] that you're not aware of maybe that
[45:56] brother branham
[45:58] um spoke of in the masterpiece in 1964
[46:02] because you say what happened in what
[46:04] happened in 77 well 77 to me was a
[46:06] marker year
[46:07] but watch put up number nine
[46:11] all right this is the masterpiece we see
[46:13] the day's darkening you see the shadows
[46:15] falling when i predicted just a few more
[46:17] turns of the sun this nation is gone
[46:19] yesterday was the fourth of july this
[46:21] was preached on 705
[46:23] right yesterday fourth of july thomas
[46:25] jefferson signed the declaration of
[46:26] independence
[46:27] him and the other board that was with
[46:28] him in the liberty bell rang and we
[46:30] declared an independence as a nation
[46:32] according to history there's never been
[46:34] a democracy at any time
[46:35] last over 200 years right and that was
[46:39] 1776.
[46:41] now what's 100 years added to that
[46:45] somebody did somebody graduate
[46:51] 1776 plus uh plus 200 years
[46:54] is what 1976
[46:59] right okay july the 4th and we're just
[47:03] 11 years left will it make it no
[47:06] right can't see 11 years and if it does
[47:10] it'll break all history yeah all right
[47:14] everybody know what happened before that
[47:17] we're going to read it
[47:18] where i googled it let's go to the next
[47:21] one gerald
[47:22] rudolph ford i didn't know this till
[47:26] yesterday
[47:27] i guess dick some of y'all older ones
[47:29] knew it i was only 14 years old at the
[47:30] time
[47:32] gerald ford's real name was leslie lance
[47:34] king i would have changed it too
[47:40] he was an american politician who served
[47:42] as the 38th president of the united
[47:43] states
[47:43] from when 1974 to 1977.
[47:48] kind of odd prior to this he was the
[47:50] 40th vice president of the united states
[47:53] serving from 1973 until president
[47:55] richard nixon's resignation
[47:58] in 1974.
[48:01] he was the first person appointed the
[48:03] vice presidency under the terms of the
[48:04] 25th amendment
[48:06] if you remember brother dick agnew quit
[48:10] ford came in then nixon quit
[48:15] and they appointed ford president of the
[48:17] united states
[48:18] no vote exactly no vote
[48:22] even now your vice president is going to
[48:25] be appointed
[48:26] right watch following the resignation of
[48:30] a vice president sparrow agnew on
[48:31] october the 10th becoming president upon
[48:33] richard nixon's departure in august 1974
[48:36] he claimed the distinction
[48:37] as the first and to date the only person
[48:40] to have served as both vice president
[48:42] and president of the united states
[48:44] without being elected to either office
[48:46] your democracy ended right right there
[48:49] exactly
[48:50] there was no man put in there was no man
[48:53] voted in office
[48:55] and by 1977 right we have no democracy
[48:59] right the people were both appointed i
[49:01] didn't know that
[49:02] the vice president was but let's pull up
[49:04] him he is his
[49:05] name is very familiar his name is
[49:09] his name is josiah nelson rockefeller
[49:16] he was the 41st vice president of the
[49:18] united states under president gerald
[49:20] ford
[49:21] after unsuccessfully seeking the
[49:22] republican presidential nomination 1960
[49:24] 64-68 served as vice president
[49:26] for 74-77 under gerald ford ford
[49:29] ascended to the presidency ascended
[49:33] ascended i thought we voted him
[49:37] ascended you know what ascendant is
[49:42] one more time you ascended that means
[49:45] that when
[49:47] queen elizabeth dies her son or
[49:50] whichever one is going to ascend
[49:52] they ain't going to vote him in
[49:56] ford ascended to the presidency
[49:58] following the august 74 resignation of
[50:00] richard nixon over the watergate
[50:01] scandal and ford selected rockefeller
[50:04] right
[50:05] he wasn't even voted brother richard as
[50:08] his replacement only the second vice
[50:10] president to be appointed under the
[50:12] provision of the 25th amendment
[50:14] ford was the first right right there
[50:16] together both of them
[50:18] were put into office with no vote right
[50:21] a democracy is the vote of the people
[50:23] right
[50:24] so brother branham was exactly correct
[50:26] this nation ended before 1977
[50:29] being a democracy and then who did they
[50:32] vote in
[50:32] a southern baptist jimmy carter and it
[50:36] was horrible
[50:38] i'm not saying jimmy carter was horrible
[50:39] i'm saying he just had a horrible
[50:41] presidency
[50:42] because he's done really good things and
[50:45] he was a devout christian
[50:47] as far as he knew you know as far as he
[50:49] knew still alive
[50:50] still battling cancer but look what
[50:52] happened in 1974
[50:54] this nation from 74 to 77 had two
[50:58] officials in the white house that never
[51:01] were elected by the people
[51:04] they weren't even elected by the
[51:06] electoral college
[51:08] they were not elected period they
[51:10] ascended
[51:14] i kind of i kind of cringed at that word
[51:16] when it says ascended
[51:18] he ascended to the presidency nobody in
[51:21] history has ever
[51:22] ascended in the united states to a
[51:23] presidency presidency except
[51:25] this situation right here so there is to
[51:28] me
[51:29] now that's not all in 1977 but 1977
[51:32] ended that era from 74 to 77 it ended
[51:38] the era of the united states being a
[51:39] democracy so brother brown was exactly
[51:41] correct what happened in 1977
[51:44] when we read it before let's go back
[51:46] again
[51:47] to the 70th week of daniel that's just
[51:49] some little history that i want you to
[51:50] look at because
[51:51] people uh and and i don't want to be
[51:56] yeah i do want to be critical i do want
[51:58] to be critical
[52:00] we had a brother sit right here right
[52:01] about where dick was at no he's probably
[52:03] on the
[52:03] second row i guess wasn't he he stood up
[52:06] and he said
[52:07] i wish somebody would explain 1977
[52:11] because a lot of people are leaving the
[52:12] message
[52:12] because of that being one of them and
[52:15] other things
[52:17] and he never came back to another
[52:18] minister's meeting and daddy tried to
[52:20] explain in just
[52:22] three minutes about 1977.
[52:25] they're not going to listen because they
[52:27] just you know i i was thinking this
[52:30] morning
[52:32] before i started my mail route and i
[52:34] don't think about much anything except
[52:35] getting the mail in the box
[52:36] during that time but i was thinking i
[52:39] said you know
[52:40] um the jews had a had three accidents
[52:45] right brother i'm talking about the
[52:46] third exodus one two and three
[52:50] well what about in the message
[52:53] we've had three exoduses the first
[52:56] exodus was 1977. there was a lot of
[52:58] people exited the message
[53:00] in 1977. dad was around
[53:04] i don't think brother in the message 77
[53:06] okay well dad i know for sure brother
[53:08] colley
[53:09] was in 1977 people sent their books back
[53:12] they quit the message i'm not having any
[53:14] more to do with this blah blah blah
[53:16] then i believe the second one was around
[53:18] the year 2000 because a lot of people
[53:19] thought 2000 was going to be it and then
[53:21] they started
[53:21] going now the third exodus is remember
[53:24] that's when they left
[53:26] i'm talking about the the elect left
[53:28] right
[53:29] yeah that's right but now you got to
[53:31] twist it back we're not talking about
[53:33] the elect
[53:33] we're talking about the third exodus now
[53:35] of the people leaving the message
[53:37] and not just not just disappearing
[53:40] they're going out
[53:40] and creating websites and things against
[53:43] the message
[53:45] happy that people are leaving the
[53:47] message happy that they're saving people
[53:49] from the message of the hour
[53:51] this is the last exodus there was three
[53:54] exoduses and i believe there was three
[53:56] x's brother donnie i believe god has
[53:58] narrowed this thing down because it's
[53:59] gonna be a little flock it's not gonna
[54:00] be a bunch
[54:01] it's not gonna be a lot of people it's
[54:03] not gonna be a lot of people
[54:05] but why can't we look at 1977 if brother
[54:08] branham took 1977
[54:10] and put it in the scripture why can't we
[54:13] look at 1977 just for a minute
[54:16] and see what he was talking about and
[54:18] i'm not trying to interpret anything he
[54:20] said
[54:20] because i want to tell you something
[54:22] brother branham said 1977
[54:25] will be the 70th jubilee
[54:30] right exactly 70th jubilee making 3 430
[54:36] years
[54:36] jubilee means the going up are the
[54:38] release
[54:40] everybody got that say amen amen so
[54:43] in 1977 something happened
[54:47] he said that was the 70th jubilee
[54:50] okay now 70 times 7 is 490 that's what
[54:55] the jews have been given for redemption
[54:58] amen listen folks there is no
[55:02] 71st jubilee
[55:08] there is no 71st jubilee
[55:13] 70 jubilees ends it right
[55:17] okay there is no 71st jubilee
[55:22] you can't type it anywhere 70th jubilee
[55:25] you can type it all the way through the
[55:26] bible
[55:27] amen right
[55:31] all right i know some of you kind of got
[55:34] a little upset when we were talking
[55:35] about downstairs but listen
[55:37] if brother i'm not saying we might can
[55:39] know the year the month and the week
[55:41] and that daniel's 70 weeks and that the
[55:43] jews were our timepiece
[55:46] right i think we ought to be able to dig
[55:48] in
[55:50] and and see what god has done if there's
[55:52] no 71st jubilee
[55:55] now brother dale preached this in 1974
[55:58] right proving by daniel 70 weeks that we
[56:02] could go
[56:03] to the year 2026. you say how did you
[56:06] get that
[56:07] take 1977 and add
[56:10] 49 years to it
[56:16] because if you go to the 50th year it's
[56:17] the 71st jubilee
[56:22] you say oh that's going past god
[56:24] overlaps everything people
[56:25] right god overlaps everything said
[56:30] hey all the scripture god told him it's
[56:32] going to be in bondage 400 years
[56:34] right how long did it take him to come
[56:35] out 430
[56:37] god give him a little grace i believe
[56:40] god's given us a little grace
[56:42] because brother branham did take us back
[56:45] to one scripture we already read it so
[56:48] let's go back and read again
[56:50] leviticus 25 8.
[56:55] should be the next one
[56:59] josiah who's back there josiah wake up
[57:03] okay thank you i worked that poor boy a
[57:06] couple days ago he did a real good job
[57:08] brother joe was a real good testament
[57:10] that your son worked that he was good he
[57:12] did a good job
[57:13] i didn't have to i didn't have to guide
[57:15] him much and we did a lot of work
[57:17] i'm still sore i can't hardly raise my
[57:19] hands
[57:21] and thou shalt number now brother brown
[57:23] said according to leviticus 25
[57:26] 8. everybody got that amen
[57:30] 25 8. now 25 8
[57:33] is how much 49 years
[57:39] brother brown said according to
[57:40] leviticus 25
[57:42] 8 it's 400 i mean
[57:45] 49 years seven times seven every seven
[57:47] years as a sabbath right
[57:49] when you numbered seven sabbaths the
[57:50] next year was the 50th jubilee which was
[57:53] the first year
[57:55] of the next 49 cycle they overlap each
[57:58] other
[57:58] did i say overlap if i talked about
[58:00] overlap before
[58:02] he over got overlaps about everything
[58:04] really
[58:05] church ages overlap brother brown said
[58:06] one little age lapped over the other
[58:09] right you know what i call that grace
[58:13] because god could have said 400 years
[58:14] and if they weren't ready in 400 years
[58:16] you're just out but god gave them 430
[58:19] years
[58:20] god gives us grace to me an overlap is a
[58:22] grace period
[58:24] amen because 1977 was
[58:27] the 70th jubilee amen god could have cut
[58:30] it off right there
[58:31] if he would have went to this scripture
[58:34] right here
[58:34] right because there's your 50.
[58:39] right that would have been it it would
[58:42] have had to took place in 1977
[58:44] but he put it in leviticus according to
[58:46] leviticus 25
[58:47] 8 which is 49 years plus 1977
[58:52] it's 20 26 you say well that what are
[58:54] you doing with that
[58:55] we ain't got but 10 years right till we
[58:58] get to 2026.
[59:01] and everybody's going man well just hold
[59:03] on a minute we're not done yet
[59:07] trudy you want to come up here and
[59:08] finish this for me okay
[59:11] we've been through it before but i'm
[59:12] just going to throw this out i'm not
[59:13] saying any dates really i'm not
[59:15] but why would somebody in 1974
[59:20] preach that we could go to 2026 and not
[59:22] break what brother branham said
[59:24] and everybody calling daddy a fool
[59:25] really under their breath
[59:27] oh 77 is it 2026 my heavens
[59:33] some of them was pretty old in 77 and
[59:36] ain't with us anymore
[59:39] but here we are 10 years from that
[59:43] 1977 meant something glory
[59:47] it was an absolute to me like was
[59:49] talking about downstairs
[59:50] 445 bc boom to me that's a marker
[59:54] that's when daniel 70 weeks began in 445
[59:57] bc
[59:59] jesus was crucified in 80 30.
[1:00:02] that's a marker to me amen
[1:00:06] that fulfilled 69 weeks
[1:00:11] not 67 and a half right
[1:00:15] at fulfilled 69 weeks in 80 30.
[1:00:19] then you had thank god you had 2 000
[1:00:22] years of a gap for the gentiles
[1:00:24] that's what we're setting in right now
[1:00:28] and there's one week left to finish
[1:00:31] daniel's 70 weeks right
[1:00:35] if 69 years is already 69 weeks is
[1:00:38] already finished
[1:00:39] and we got seven years left
[1:00:43] brother dick you got to take seven years
[1:00:45] off of 2026
[1:00:47] because 2026 ends daniel's 70th week
[1:00:53] you got to back it up seven years to
[1:00:56] 2019.
[1:00:58] now it's real striking to me though
[1:01:03] that and this commentator had a made a
[1:01:05] good statement he was talking about the
[1:01:07] book of luke
[1:01:09] and it really is jesus fulfilled
[1:01:12] he was around when all these feast days
[1:01:13] were going on he fulfilled we know the
[1:01:16] first four
[1:01:17] but watch what happened in october
[1:01:22] what happened in october in luke
[1:01:26] the bible says jesus becoming 30. now
[1:01:28] listen
[1:01:29] what is our what is our
[1:01:32] jubilee what brother dale's talking
[1:01:35] about
[1:01:36] our jubilee now is the rest that god
[1:01:39] promised come to me all you the heavy
[1:01:41] and
[1:01:42] heavy laden and i will give you rest we
[1:01:44] have started our
[1:01:46] that's why the millennium is not to us
[1:01:49] the millennium i was thinking about this
[1:01:50] morning
[1:01:52] brother homer frazier you all need to
[1:01:53] pray for him you know a couple years ago
[1:01:55] he had his leg caught in the tractor
[1:01:57] he's 80 something years old
[1:01:58] but they had to cut his leg off well
[1:01:59] he's in bad shape now real bad shape
[1:02:03] but i thought god if it hadn't been for
[1:02:05] the fall
[1:02:07] homer fraser is not sitting in that
[1:02:09] wheelchair with no leg his theophany
[1:02:11] doesn't have a leg missing
[1:02:13] so which one is greater if we were able
[1:02:16] to see into that other dimension you see
[1:02:18] that other leg
[1:02:20] you say you're stupid well maybe
[1:02:23] but theophany you can't hurt a theophany
[1:02:25] of god
[1:02:26] a theophany of god don't have an arm
[1:02:28] missing
[1:02:30] don't have a leg missing this is what
[1:02:32] this is what mom and daddy gave me and
[1:02:34] that's what's missing
[1:02:36] from homer fraser but that's theophany
[1:02:38] inside that man
[1:02:40] it's more real than the man sitting
[1:02:41] there with a leg off
[1:02:43] if we just realize that people i believe
[1:02:45] that's when the limbs will be restored
[1:02:48] and the body change will happen amen i
[1:02:51] believe that i really believe that
[1:02:54] but jesus
[1:02:57] preached the acceptable year of the lord
[1:03:01] and this commentator tied that into the
[1:03:04] jubilee
[1:03:06] because jesus on the day of atonement
[1:03:11] that's where he was at he was in the
[1:03:14] temple
[1:03:16] and he said this day this scripture
[1:03:21] is fulfilled remember the book of luke
[1:03:23] said jesus becoming 30.
[1:03:25] well if he was born in april
[1:03:28] right if he was born in april
[1:03:33] and crucified in april but he only but
[1:03:35] he preached three and a half years
[1:03:38] october is when he started his ministry
[1:03:40] october is when he started
[1:03:42] his harvest
[1:03:45] in october harvest time in october
[1:03:49] harvest time
[1:03:50] we don't harvest in april we plant in
[1:03:52] april
[1:03:53] we harvest in october right why do you
[1:03:56] think the day of atonement october
[1:04:00] october what day is it the 10th day of
[1:04:03] october
[1:04:04] now not exactly the 10th day of our
[1:04:06] october but the 10th day of their
[1:04:08] testery or october
[1:04:10] is the day of atonement now what's going
[1:04:13] to happen when the
[1:04:14] two witnesses preach to the 144
[1:04:18] 000. they're going to see their day of
[1:04:21] atonement
[1:04:22] glory yes sir we're not through with the
[1:04:25] feast days
[1:04:26] amen now to me 1977 was given
[1:04:30] for a sign because watch now we can take
[1:04:34] 1977
[1:04:37] and we can say okay it can't go past
[1:04:39] 2026 or that'll be a 71st jubilee
[1:04:42] which there is no such thing then we can
[1:04:44] back it up seven years you say well
[1:04:46] you're making a prediction i'm just
[1:04:47] telling you
[1:04:48] that between now and in 2019 is exactly
[1:04:52] three and a half years
[1:04:59] because there's another thing we're
[1:05:00] going to look at downstairs
[1:05:02] let me just throw this out because in
[1:05:04] daniel 9 27 it says
[1:05:06] that when the that when the man in other
[1:05:09] words the
[1:05:10] 927 says he shall make a covenant with
[1:05:12] many for one week
[1:05:14] and in the midst of the week that's why
[1:05:16] there's one week left after the rapture
[1:05:17] people
[1:05:18] the bible tells us there's one week left
[1:05:21] and he shall confirm a covenant with
[1:05:23] many for one week and in the middle of
[1:05:25] that week
[1:05:26] he's going to cause the what sacrifice
[1:05:29] and oblation to cease
[1:05:34] there's only one time that one priest
[1:05:37] goes in the holy of holies one time a
[1:05:40] year right
[1:05:42] that's at passover
[1:05:47] so now we got another marker the middle
[1:05:49] of the week
[1:05:50] is it passover because when that pope
[1:05:54] walks in and says no more sacrifices
[1:05:56] he has desolated that temple they can
[1:05:58] make no more sacrifices
[1:06:01] he's desecrated the temple passover
[1:06:05] back it up three and a half years and go
[1:06:08] forward three and a half years
[1:06:13] october 2019.
[1:06:18] could start the 70th week of daniel and
[1:06:21] october 2026
[1:06:23] could end it
[1:06:27] year month a week
[1:06:31] right right
[1:06:37] you decide what you want to decide right
[1:06:39] but i'm telling you
[1:06:41] i'm getting older too brother dick
[1:06:45] 10 years from now you'll be 90 right
[1:06:50] you may not know you'll be 90 but we'll
[1:06:51] know you're 90.
[1:06:53] if we make it i don't think we're going
[1:06:54] to make it people i'm telling you
[1:06:56] the way this thing's going and listen
[1:06:59] this is going to be
[1:07:00] a secret catching away it's not going to
[1:07:02] be
[1:07:03] we i think sometimes we feel that that
[1:07:06] we're building
[1:07:07] up to something when jesus went to
[1:07:10] calvary it was the greatest time that
[1:07:12] he'd ever had in his life but
[1:07:14] it to the outside world it looked like
[1:07:16] it was the worst
[1:07:17] right i mean think of a commentary of a
[1:07:19] man writing a commentary about somebody
[1:07:21] hanging on the cross and there's people
[1:07:22] crying and this one and they're running
[1:07:24] and
[1:07:25] you know you're right on the banks
[1:07:27] county
[1:07:28] news and journal or whatever it is banks
[1:07:30] county whatever it is
[1:07:32] yeah whatever it is in the banks county
[1:07:35] newspaper you know if you're sitting
[1:07:36] there
[1:07:36] writing about this guy that's dying on
[1:07:38] the cross and he's crying and he's
[1:07:40] screaming
[1:07:41] and he's asking for uh you know it would
[1:07:43] look like to me
[1:07:44] if i read the paper that just some
[1:07:46] center died
[1:07:48] they crucified hey they didn't crucify
[1:07:50] good people
[1:07:54] they crucified people that done
[1:07:55] something wrong
[1:07:57] so whether they knew the history of that
[1:07:59] man hanging on the cross if they never
[1:08:00] knew the history of him
[1:08:02] they just thought he was another center
[1:08:03] with the other two
[1:08:05] but that was the finest hour that ever
[1:08:07] was on the face of the earth
[1:08:09] but it was the darkest hour for the
[1:08:11] people around the sun went down
[1:08:13] that's what i'm saying about you and i
[1:08:15] if we do better under persecution
[1:08:19] let it come it's got to happen it's got
[1:08:22] to happen
[1:08:24] but 1977 to me
[1:08:28] was a marker to give us a few more dates
[1:08:32] to put with daniel 70 weeks just a few
[1:08:36] another marker that we can put down
[1:08:38] because
[1:08:39] i'm telling you there is no 71st jubilee
[1:08:42] right right
[1:08:43] there's only 70. if you go 50 more years
[1:08:47] you put it into a 71st jubilee
[1:08:50] you've got 49 years to 2026 and that's
[1:08:53] the date that brother dale came up with
[1:08:55] but this is the this is the shocker that
[1:08:58] i found online and then we'll
[1:09:00] we'll close
[1:09:03] there's three time periods because
[1:09:06] there's only
[1:09:07] remember if you've been studying with me
[1:09:09] downstairs
[1:09:11] there's there's so many moon cycles
[1:09:13] that's what they go by in israel they go
[1:09:15] by moon cycles
[1:09:16] they don't go by calendar if they come
[1:09:20] up to the last month of adar
[1:09:22] and they're getting ready to go to
[1:09:23] nissin one and if they look up and
[1:09:24] they're still a sliver of the moon
[1:09:27] they add another month of adar
[1:09:31] 30 more days why because if you the
[1:09:34] moon i mean the world's tilted you know
[1:09:36] it's wobbling that's why we have a leap
[1:09:38] year
[1:09:38] because see if they didn't do that it'd
[1:09:40] start pushing all them spring feast
[1:09:43] would be in the summer and then they'd
[1:09:44] fall in the winter and they they keep
[1:09:46] moving like this
[1:09:47] well they jack it back that one month
[1:09:49] about every three or four years
[1:09:55] on the julian calendar but not the the
[1:09:58] lunar calendar has
[1:09:59] zero to do with the julian with the uh
[1:10:02] uh whatever one we go by right the
[1:10:05] gregorian or the julian or whichever one
[1:10:06] has nothing to do with it doesn't bob
[1:10:08] nothing it's moon cycle and there's only
[1:10:12] three years listen to this there's only
[1:10:16] three years that there's exactly enough
[1:10:19] moon cycles
[1:10:20] because remember if 1260 days is three
[1:10:23] and a half years they're going to
[1:10:23] prophesy 1260 days in the midst of the
[1:10:25] week
[1:10:26] they're going to be cut off and killed
[1:10:28] there's 260 more days
[1:10:29] that's what 2500 and
[1:10:33] 20 days there's only three time periods
[1:10:36] now this is
[1:10:37] online some of you already went to the
[1:10:40] website
[1:10:40] online this guy figured it out by moon
[1:10:43] cycles
[1:10:44] not by not by calendars but by moon
[1:10:46] cycles
[1:10:48] 2 520 days only falls
[1:10:51] in three years
[1:10:56] 2014 which is past 2016 which is this
[1:11:00] year
[1:11:02] and that one year i just told you
[1:11:06] 2019. right
[1:11:10] 2019 plus seven is 20 26 we go right
[1:11:12] back to the same two days it just keeps
[1:11:14] bouncing back for
[1:11:15] that's what i when i looked at on the
[1:11:17] line i thought
[1:11:19] why does it keep coming up 2026. and i
[1:11:22] kept digging and kept digging i knew
[1:11:23] what brother nell had said about 2026
[1:11:25] and i knew how
[1:11:26] that worked but for somebody to come in
[1:11:28] and give you
[1:11:29] a commentary and said there's only three
[1:11:31] years
[1:11:32] that you can have exactly 2520 moon
[1:11:35] cycles
[1:11:36] days or the of the time 2 520 days
[1:11:40] which is that seven year period is 2014
[1:11:44] 2016 and 2019 and it will not happen
[1:11:48] again
[1:11:48] for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[1:11:50] of years you see why
[1:11:55] i've been digging 2019 means a lot
[1:11:59] whether we going to rapture or not i
[1:12:01] don't know
[1:12:03] but there's one thing for sure brother
[1:12:05] brown didn't say 1977.
[1:12:08] just by mistake
[1:12:13] he brought it into the 70th week of
[1:12:16] daniel
[1:12:18] that last seven years 1977
[1:12:22] helped us with a marker and it marked a
[1:12:24] time
[1:12:25] that we may know the year the month
[1:12:30] and maybe even the week right so
[1:12:34] if we're here you know what though i
[1:12:35] told them downstairs if we're here past
[1:12:37] 2019 i'll stand right here
[1:12:39] and i'll tell you i must have got
[1:12:40] something wrong because 2026 to me
[1:12:43] ends all 70 there's no other there's no
[1:12:46] 71st
[1:12:47] jubilee the jews right now folks are
[1:12:51] looking for that jubilee they're
[1:12:54] wanting that jubilee they got to get the
[1:12:56] messiah here we've already got the
[1:12:58] messiah here
[1:12:59] we're already in our jubilee we don't
[1:13:02] need days and times and seasons
[1:13:04] glory that's right if you're born again
[1:13:07] you're already in eternity
[1:13:09] you're already in that rest that's why
[1:13:11] brother brian says he said the
[1:13:13] millennium's not even to us
[1:13:16] we're there on the honeymoon what it's a
[1:13:18] rest
[1:13:19] for that land of israel
[1:13:22] to thy people and thy holy city
[1:13:25] we're going to dwell in a literal city
[1:13:33] because that's what god said in daniel 9
[1:13:35] 24
[1:13:36] he's going to restore a group of people
[1:13:38] and he's going to restore the city amen
[1:13:40] and once he restores those two we're
[1:13:42] going to ride into the millennium
[1:13:44] we're going to be the anointing to the
[1:13:47] temple
[1:13:48] they don't need to be anointed again
[1:13:53] day of atonement
[1:13:57] then what do you got after the day of
[1:13:58] atonement a few days later you got feast
[1:14:01] tabernacles
[1:14:05] feast of tabernacles yeah where we going
[1:14:08] to live
[1:14:10] right see we're all ready brother ryan
[1:14:12] said we're feasting under the feast of
[1:14:13] tabernacles right
[1:14:15] why because it's god tabernacling human
[1:14:16] flesh but he has promised
[1:14:18] israel that he's going to build them a
[1:14:20] city they're going to build a city
[1:14:21] and we're going to all dwell in that
[1:14:23] city it's a literal city john didn't see
[1:14:25] a figment of his imagination when he saw
[1:14:28] that city
[1:14:30] because remember the bible says
[1:14:34] in isaiah that they shall build and no
[1:14:38] one else inhabits so somebody's going to
[1:14:40] build something
[1:14:41] that's not the future home
[1:14:44] that's not the future home some of those
[1:14:46] scriptures you can put together
[1:14:48] that's not the future home brother
[1:14:50] branham read the future home he said
[1:14:52] this city was built by your
[1:14:55] desire god
[1:14:58] put that city together and you ain't got
[1:15:00] to build nothing
[1:15:02] but the bible says that you'll build
[1:15:05] because really what you're saying is
[1:15:07] see i build a house and then i give it
[1:15:08] to josh and josh gives it or sells it
[1:15:11] to another the bible says you'll not
[1:15:12] give it to another you'll build that
[1:15:14] house and you'll dwell in it
[1:15:16] for a thousand years then
[1:15:21] the real city that we're all looking for
[1:15:23] the real city
[1:15:27] the one that's built for me
[1:15:30] is going to come down out of heaven as a
[1:15:32] bride adorned for a husband
[1:15:34] what a great time i mean if it makes you
[1:15:37] scared you need to get in the altar
[1:15:38] right if it makes you concerned that's
[1:15:40] okay
[1:15:41] but if you're just really scared about
[1:15:43] this then you you know you
[1:15:45] listen folks regardless of whether i'm
[1:15:48] right or wrong
[1:15:49] there's a day when god's gonna come
[1:15:52] he's not and he's not coming in you know
[1:15:55] he's not going to come and pick up a few
[1:15:57] and then come pick up a few more and
[1:15:59] then come pick up a few more
[1:16:01] he's coming to pick up one bride
[1:16:06] and it's going to be on one day
[1:16:09] that's right right brother brown said
[1:16:11] between six and nine in the morning he
[1:16:13] got pretty close
[1:16:15] he's talking about hours now almost but
[1:16:18] he didn't pick the hour he said six
[1:16:20] and nine right see he stayed in the
[1:16:22] scripture no man know the day or hour
[1:16:24] he didn't say the rapture going to take
[1:16:26] place at seven o'clock in the morning he
[1:16:27] said no
[1:16:28] some morning between six and nine
[1:16:31] i believe folks there's going to be a
[1:16:32] harvest
[1:16:34] and that harvest is in october november
[1:16:36] september somewhere in there
[1:16:38] that's just my thoughts everybody's
[1:16:40] talking about resurrection in april
[1:16:43] i thought the bible said that jesus told
[1:16:46] the angels to go
[1:16:48] and reap did he not
[1:16:52] he said separate the tares from the
[1:16:55] wheat
[1:16:56] and bring the wheat into my garner
[1:17:00] well when do you harvest wheat not in
[1:17:03] april
[1:17:04] you harvest wheat in october or in this
[1:17:08] in the fall let me put it that way in
[1:17:09] the fall of the year so let's stand our
[1:17:11] feet
[1:17:12] i hope i haven't made anybody mad amen
[1:17:15] if i have just get over it
[1:17:19] because it's just what i believe you
[1:17:21] know what i i'm not a date setter never
[1:17:22] have been we've never been one we've
[1:17:24] never set dates
[1:17:26] but when you can take a certain marker
[1:17:28] and you can say hey
[1:17:29] i think i know that's what that man was
[1:17:31] talking about
[1:17:32] and i think brother branham wants us to
[1:17:34] know
[1:17:36] he wants us to know why he said in 1977
[1:17:39] and then he put it in a scripture now if
[1:17:40] he would have just said
[1:17:41] i predict i predict i predict i predict
[1:17:44] but you come to the 70th week of daniels
[1:17:46] kind of odd
[1:17:47] when he started looking at those dates
[1:17:50] luis he took and put it right into a
[1:17:52] scripture
[1:17:52] one scripture leviticus 25 8. exactly
[1:17:55] seven
[1:17:56] sevens is 49. so 49 plus 1977
[1:18:00] is the year 20 26 or somewhere there
[1:18:03] about that
[1:18:05] all right so you decide
[1:18:08] yeah if you want to stay here to 2026
[1:18:10] that's fine with me
[1:18:12] we'll be having a real birthday party
[1:18:14] for cletus you'll be knocking almost
[1:18:16] 100 i know
[1:18:19] but that's all right she's pretty good
[1:18:21] shape for for the shape she's in
[1:18:23] but listen you know what god will take
[1:18:25] care of people that'll that'll
[1:18:27] uh be loyal and faithful right right
[1:18:30] i believe that i believe the bible says
[1:18:34] when brother dale reads that scripture
[1:18:35] about
[1:18:36] um taking the communion a mess where if
[1:18:39] you take it that it would not discern in
[1:18:41] the body you could be sick
[1:18:42] and weakly and sick among you and many
[1:18:44] sleep
[1:18:45] i believe you can cut yourself short
[1:18:47] right look at israel
[1:18:50] god promised them a promised land he
[1:18:52] promised them if they would
[1:18:53] hallow that 50th year that he would make
[1:18:56] an increase i didn't read the rest of it
[1:18:57] read that whole chapter
[1:18:59] he even tells them he said from the
[1:19:01] sixth year
[1:19:02] to the eighth year three six six seven
[1:19:04] eight for three years i'll give you
[1:19:06] plenty enough to make it to that ninth
[1:19:09] year
[1:19:10] right because see you gotta let the land
[1:19:11] rest for seven you gotta plan on the
[1:19:13] eighth
[1:19:14] well you gotta reap later on you can't
[1:19:16] reap the same time you gotta reap later
[1:19:18] on
[1:19:18] so there's a big gap but god said if
[1:19:20] you'll do what i say
[1:19:22] he even said in there he said i'll give
[1:19:23] you rain
[1:19:25] when you need it glory
[1:19:29] but they didn't do what he said so god
[1:19:32] drove them out of the land
[1:19:34] the denominations didn't do what god
[1:19:36] said
[1:19:37] so he drove him out of the land he's
[1:19:39] taken a people
[1:19:40] not a denomination and i see this
[1:19:43] message become denominated so much
[1:19:46] so much more and more that people are
[1:19:48] just coming to church just because it's
[1:19:50] a message church
[1:19:52] i'll tell you something people we got
[1:19:55] what we need to get out of here
[1:20:00] we ain't waiting on nobody else to come
[1:20:02] back
[1:20:04] sorry i believe there's enough in here
[1:20:06] right now to get us out here brother ray
[1:20:08] don't you
[1:20:09] rapturing faith lays in these books and
[1:20:10] tapes that the problem is is we don't
[1:20:12] get in them enough
[1:20:13] in them not on them he said it lays in
[1:20:15] them so we got to get in them
[1:20:18] i don't want the holy ghost on me that's
[1:20:20] right i want it in me
[1:20:22] amen in earth right brother dick
[1:20:25] in earth as it is in heaven not on
[1:20:29] own won't get you nowhere end we'll get
[1:20:32] you in
[1:20:33] let's sing a song god bless each and
[1:20:34] every one of you
[1:20:36] i am thinking of a rapture in that
[1:20:40] blessed home on high winds
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:58] [Music]
[1:21:08] [Music]
[1:21:12] hello
[1:21:19] [Music]
[1:21:26] here
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:49] [Music]
[1:21:54] our gathering and this one's one i like
[1:22:00] because the angels never fell
[1:22:05] the angels that are worshiping god never
[1:22:08] fell
[1:22:10] the angels all will listen
[1:22:15] for they cannot join this song glory
[1:22:18] they don't know nothing about it
[1:22:22] bro louise that angel that was with
[1:22:24] brother branham i was thinking about
[1:22:25] this the other day
[1:22:27] now listen let me ask you a question
[1:22:30] brother brown was the holy ghost field
[1:22:31] prophet right amen
[1:22:34] he preached the word of god right god
[1:22:36] god was speaking through that man
[1:22:38] right right amen anybody agree amen
[1:22:42] why do you have to say i'm waiting on
[1:22:43] him
[1:22:49] why do you have to say i'm waiting on
[1:22:50] him remember because he had it was
[1:22:52] another anointing
[1:22:53] right that healing anointing come he
[1:22:55] said okay he's here
[1:22:57] well i thought he was there the whole
[1:22:58] time
[1:23:00] there was just another gear like brother
[1:23:02] brown said and that's and you say what
[1:23:04] are you talking about
[1:23:04] we got the holy ghost don't we but we're
[1:23:07] not raptured yet
[1:23:08] but one day we're going to really know
[1:23:11] he's here
[1:23:14] and then that's when we go glory because
[1:23:16] that's your healing
[1:23:18] healing is temporary that angel would
[1:23:21] come
[1:23:22] uh the lord jesus christ would come and
[1:23:24] heal those people but when they walked
[1:23:26] out of that away from that anointing
[1:23:27] brother ramsey some of them would
[1:23:28] get it back on them before they walked
[1:23:30] across the platform
[1:23:32] wow but you can't take a redeemed person
[1:23:36] and unredeem them
[1:23:39] there is not you can't take a redeemed
[1:23:41] person and unredeem him
[1:23:43] he can't walk off the pull off the
[1:23:44] platform and lose his holy ghost
[1:23:47] no he's got it till the day of their
[1:23:50] redemption and the angels will know
[1:23:52] nothing about that that angel would come
[1:23:54] to brother branham he'd say
[1:23:56] he brother brown said the angel came and
[1:23:58] showed me this this and this well what
[1:23:59] was the angel doing
[1:24:01] the angel wasn't revealing nothing to
[1:24:02] him
[1:24:04] oh brother wade no he didn't
[1:24:08] the angel didn't reveal anything to him
[1:24:09] an angel cannot reveal anything to you
[1:24:12] he can bring you a message because
[1:24:15] remember he's not a child of god you are
[1:24:17] right oh the great ain't doesn't matter
[1:24:21] doesn't matter that angel would tell
[1:24:24] brother brown
[1:24:25] he said i believe i believe he'd come to
[1:24:27] say william branham
[1:24:28] have you read daniel 9 24.
[1:24:33] yeah i've read 924 have you really read
[1:24:35] daniel 9 24 how about this scripture
[1:24:37] have you put this scripture with this
[1:24:38] one
[1:24:38] he wasn't revealing anything to brother
[1:24:40] branham he was bringing it to his
[1:24:42] attention glory
[1:24:44] and then the holy ghost inside of
[1:24:45] william branham would tur
[1:24:48] bring that through that filter and then
[1:24:51] it would what
[1:24:52] it'd click you click
[1:24:57] the angels all will listen for they
[1:25:00] cannot join that song
[1:25:02] when the reading look another ringing
