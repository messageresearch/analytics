[8:56] Genesis
[8:57] 135-15 and um just take a little topic
[9:01] tonight prepared for his Pro prepared
[9:03] for the promises and uh before we read
[9:06] this let's just go into the word to the
[9:07] author Lord we're so grateful be to be
[9:09] able to gather around your word tonight
[9:11] Lord Jesus and Lord like our Prophet
[9:13] told us it's like look into the Sheep
[9:15] music and if we can just get into the
[9:17] the rhythm of what's laying here in the
[9:18] word and Lord if the conductor the
[9:21] spirit of the conductor can tell us
[9:23] what's what's laying here and what we're
[9:25] supposed to be doing we can just see how
[9:26] everything's supposed to unfold I pray
[9:29] God that you'll be with us tonight Lord
[9:31] just enter in enter into that Rhythm of
[9:33] the word Lord Jesus that enter into the
[9:35] rhythm of the the music for the sage
[9:37] Lord Jesus so that we know our we can
[9:39] find Our Place be with us tonight Lord
[9:42] we pray and you just bless this little
[9:43] service Lord here in the middle of the
[9:45] week and give us strength Lord God help
[9:48] us in the hour that we're living in Lord
[9:49] we pray in your
[9:52] name and uh so as we read this scripture
[9:56] just think about Abraham and all of the
[9:57] things that God had promised him and
[9:59] before before he could see all those
[10:01] promises come to pass he had to be
[10:03] completely separated from any unbelief
[10:05] from anything that was contrary to God's
[10:07] word so that he could see the promised
[10:09] son made
[10:10] manifest and uh so we'll read from verse
[10:13] 5 and it says and lot also which went
[10:15] with Abram had flocks and herds and
[10:17] Tents and the land was not able to Bear
[10:20] them that they might dwell together for
[10:21] their substance was great so that they
[10:23] could not dwell
[10:24] together and there was a Strife between
[10:26] the Herdman of Abram's cattle and the
[10:29] her of Lot's cattle and the Canaanite
[10:32] and the perizzite dwell then in the land
[10:34] and Abram said unto lot let there not
[10:36] let there be no Strife I pray thee
[10:37] between me and thee and between my
[10:39] Herdman and thy Herdman for we be
[10:41] Brethren is not the whole land before
[10:43] thee separate thyself I pray thee from
[10:45] me if thou wil take the left hand then I
[10:47] will go to the right or if thou depart
[10:49] to the right hand then I will go to the
[10:50] left and lot lifted up his eyes and
[10:53] beheld all the plain of Jordan that is
[10:54] well watered everywhere before the Lord
[10:56] destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the
[10:58] guard of the Lord like the land of Egypt
[11:00] as thou comest unto Zoar then lot chose
[11:03] him all the plain of Jordan and Lot
[11:05] journeyed East and they separated
[11:08] themselves the one from the other Abram
[11:10] dwelt in the land of Canaan and lot
[11:12] dwell dwelt in the cities of the plain
[11:14] and pitched his tent toward Sodom but
[11:16] the men of Sodom were Wicked and sinners
[11:18] before the Lord exceedingly and the Lord
[11:20] said unto Abram after that lot was
[11:22] separated from him lift up now thine
[11:25] eyes and look from the place where thou
[11:27] art northward and Southward and Eastward
[11:31] and Westward for all the land which thou
[11:35] seest to thee will I give it and thy
[11:38] seed forever God bless you you may be
[11:41] seated the Lord out his Blessing to the
[11:43] reading of the word all you think about
[11:45] all the promises that are laying here in
[11:47] the in the in the Bible for us but if we
[11:49] can just separate ourselves from
[11:51] unbelief and just lay claim to God's
[11:53] word I I was preaching this this past
[11:55] Sunday on how God doesn't forget his
[11:57] promises that we've got a God that that
[11:59] when God makes a promise he he he he
[12:02] he's going to back it up and he's just
[12:04] trusting in us he's relying on us to
[12:07] take just take him at his word and and
[12:09] you see here where we've got a story of
[12:12] of Abraham and and and lot both having
[12:14] different desires a lot wanted to see
[12:16] you know a type of the carnal believer
[12:19] that wants to see how close they can get
[12:20] to the to to Sodom and gomorra and the
[12:22] the things of the world but Abraham
[12:25] Abraham uh once once he was separated
[12:28] from lot then he could be visited by
[12:30] melkisedek then melkisedek could come
[12:33] and break the bread and the wine with
[12:35] him and then he could unfold all of
[12:37] these Mysteries of the the the promised
[12:39] son and I I think today sure surely we
[12:41] can see that in our own lives how that
[12:44] uh when you truly are separated from all
[12:46] unbelief and see unbelief just drop away
[12:48] from you and you see it maybe like right
[12:51] away into the sunset then we've got a
[12:53] promise that the son of man will be
[12:55] manifest in our lives and we've got a
[12:57] promise that that man that that child
[12:59] that's that what we've been waiting on
[13:01] all these years will be manifest in our
[13:04] sight and brother Brandon would say he
[13:06] said our thought of God's word calling a
[13:09] total separation we only know this by as
[13:12] we read the word and see the word
[13:15] manifest and you know all all through
[13:16] the scripture is a story of how the word
[13:19] when the word is being preached the word
[13:21] actually will create a separation it
[13:23] separates it like it separated Abraham
[13:26] and lot it separates in in the very
[13:28] beginning in the beginning in Genesis
[13:30] 1:3 we find that God saw that the light
[13:33] was good and God separated the light
[13:36] from the darkness and how did he do it
[13:38] he did it by his spoken word so the word
[13:40] of God actually began to separate the
[13:43] light from the darkness from the
[13:44] beginning so does it remain even until
[13:47] this day and later on in this sermon
[13:50] brother ROM would explain that even even
[13:51] the day when we're in a meeting when the
[13:53] word is going forth it actually
[13:55] separates it separates the true and the
[13:57] false it separates it actually will
[14:00] cause your unbelief to begin dropping
[14:02] away the word of God when it's received
[14:03] in a penitent heart it's going to cause
[14:06] you to begin believing and begin it
[14:08] changes the way you think you see and in
[14:10] Genesis 1 chapter 2 or chapter 1: 2 to 4
[14:14] it says the Earth was without form and
[14:16] void and darkness was upon the face of
[14:18] the deep and the spirit of God moved on
[14:21] the face of the waters and God said let
[14:23] there be light and there was light and
[14:25] the and God saw the light that it was
[14:27] good and God divided the light from the
[14:30] darkness I think surely that we can see
[14:33] how that mirrors our own our own uh uh
[14:37] Christian experience how our life was
[14:38] all in chaos and then we heard the word
[14:41] of God and then that word took our life
[14:43] that was in chaos and darkness and
[14:45] actually begin to mold it and begin to
[14:47] separate us from the things of the world
[14:50] I you know just looking at if you can
[14:52] look back in your own experience maybe
[14:54] maybe you used to hang around with the
[14:55] wrong crowd and hang around with people
[14:58] that were smoking and vaping and
[14:59] drinking alcohol and and cussing like
[15:01] Sailors but then you heard the word and
[15:03] it be to it it caught your attention and
[15:06] begin to draw you away from that and so
[15:08] it separated you from that Old group of
[15:12] friends you
[15:13] know it it truly will separate you it
[15:17] makes you it makes you not want to hang
[15:19] around that anymore I I saw that even in
[15:22] my my children's life my Zach used to
[15:26] work out with some a group of fans and
[15:29] they weren't the best group of friends
[15:30] to have and but once he got saved he met
[15:33] one of them one time in the in the in
[15:35] the gas station parking lot and he's
[15:36] like I just can't hang around that
[15:38] person anymore why because the he heard
[15:40] the word of God and it and it separates
[15:42] you it it changes things and separ I
[15:45] thank God that God can take chaos and
[15:48] turn it into order now there's one way
[15:51] you can tell the difference between the
[15:52] devil doing something and and God doing
[15:54] something the devil is going to always
[15:56] be an author of chaos chaos and darkness
[15:59] where and confusion where you don't know
[16:01] what's going on and you're you're just
[16:03] what what what is wrong and what is
[16:05] Right wondering whether somebody's
[16:07] telling the truth or not that's what the
[16:09] the devil is the author of confusion
[16:11] that's one thing I always want to stand
[16:13] when I when I preach and when I when I
[16:15] declare what I believe I I want people
[16:16] to know where I stand and what I believe
[16:19] on things because because that's what
[16:21] God is all about that's what light is
[16:23] the the the God is the author of light
[16:27] and life and illumination and taking
[16:29] chaos and tearing down uh tearing down
[16:34] all those things that represent darkness
[16:35] and chaos and bringing order just like
[16:38] Babylon Babylon was the symbol of of
[16:40] confusion when all their their language
[16:42] was turned to where they couldn't
[16:43] understand each other's language that's
[16:45] the total opposite of God giving
[16:47] knowledge and understanding I I I love
[16:49] when you read the book of John John
[16:51] constantly says well we know we know we
[16:54] know over and over again he says we know
[16:56] because God brings understanding and and
[16:58] and and and Revelation and truth and
[17:01] order to the thing and so you can see
[17:04] how the word actually actually separates
[17:07] light and darkness and Chaos and Order
[17:10] it actually produces a separation and 2
[17:13] Corinthians
[17:15] 4:6 Paul said for God who commanded the
[17:18] light to shine out of Darkness hath
[17:21] shined in our hearts to give the light
[17:24] of the knowledge of G of the glory of
[17:26] God and the face of Jesus Christ now
[17:29] there our new birth parallels what God
[17:31] did in the creation where he he took
[17:33] chaos and and Shone light the light of
[17:35] his word and and and brought order out
[17:37] of chaos and now he's doing Paul's
[17:39] saying he did the same thing with our
[17:41] hearts who commanded the light to shine
[17:45] out of Darkness our dark reprobate heart
[17:49] uh that didn't want nothing to do with
[17:51] God and God cused the light to shine to
[17:54] shine out of that Darkness to shine in
[17:56] our heart to give light of the knowledge
[17:58] of the glory of God and even in second
[18:01] Peter 1:19 now this is one of my
[18:04] favorite scriptures cuz Peter is talking
[18:05] about he's saying we we saw all these
[18:07] things I was there up on the mount
[18:09] Transfiguration when we heard a voice I
[18:12] was there when we saw so many wonderful
[18:14] things but he said but now we got a more
[18:17] sure word of Prophecy and what more sure
[18:19] word of Prophecy is that the light that
[18:22] as unto a light that shineth in a dark
[18:24] place until the day Dawn and the day
[18:26] star arise in your hearts the the new
[18:29] birth that's what the new birth is the
[18:30] light of God's word to take that
[18:33] darkness and that chaotic old life and
[18:35] change you to separate you so that you
[18:37] ain't like you used to be now that's
[18:39] kind of the that's kind of the
[18:41] centerpiece of this message tonight is
[18:43] that we got to be separated that's what
[18:45] the new birth does that's what the
[18:46] Holiness of God does is it SE SE
[18:49] sanctification is another word for
[18:51] separated and when you're separated from
[18:53] the things of the world you don't want
[18:55] to go back to that anymore you're
[18:57] separated and you're cleaned up and
[18:59] you're like like a nerite in the old Old
[19:01] Testament you're you're separated from
[19:03] it and you're you've God has taken you
[19:05] and removed you from that to where your
[19:07] conscience has been cleaned out you
[19:09] don't want that anymore you don't want
[19:11] all that you don't want to look at that
[19:13] nastiness anymore you don't want to you
[19:14] don't want to drink those things you
[19:16] used to drink you don't want to smoke
[19:17] the things that you used to smoke you've
[19:19] been cleaned out and in every stage of
[19:21] your journey you got to be separated
[19:24] before God can do something in your life
[19:26] you want the new birth for first you got
[19:28] to be Sanctified in your soul and then
[19:30] God can manifest his promises to you you
[19:32] want to see the son of man manifested in
[19:34] your midst you got to be cleaned out you
[19:36] got to be separated and then you can see
[19:38] that promise you want a body change you
[19:40] got to be cleaned out you got to be
[19:42] separated you got to be separated from
[19:44] your own ideas from your own will you
[19:46] got to be cleaned out if you want to see
[19:48] God manifested in fullness God's light
[19:51] always brings Clarity and it removes
[19:54] confusion and it REM removes Darkness
[19:56] now all these stories in the old
[19:58] Testament God through his light he
[20:00] separated the darkness and and separated
[20:02] light he separated he even separated the
[20:05] water from the land in the beginning and
[20:07] how did he do it in every case he did it
[20:09] by his word God spoke and the water was
[20:12] separated from the land so brother R
[20:15] said he had a reason for that now now
[20:17] look listen to that real quick how he
[20:19] how he did that in the in in Genesis
[20:21] chapter 1 God said he spoke it let there
[20:25] be a firmament in the midst of the
[20:28] Waters and let it divide the waters from
[20:33] the waters now if you want to paint a
[20:35] picture if you could see like a
[20:36] cross-section of of the sky and the and
[20:39] the ocean there's the whales swimming
[20:41] underneath and there's the water and he
[20:44] divided that water from the water that's
[20:46] in the atmosphere this got clouds and
[20:48] the air that we breathe now come on now
[20:50] we're not talking about some Dome over
[20:51] the Earth or some nonsense like that
[20:53] we're talking about what the Bible
[20:55] speaks of that the firmament the
[20:56] firmament is the the Bible calls it the
[20:58] the heavens the heaven is the firmament
[21:01] you look up in the sky and in the
[21:03] daytime the ocean water is reflected off
[21:06] of the the sky and it bounces back and
[21:08] you can see it looks blue but at night
[21:11] time you can see the like the Bible
[21:13] refers to the all the stars that are
[21:16] painted in the firmament and God is
[21:17] telling us here in the Bible the uh
[21:20] Moses actually is telling us here in the
[21:21] Bible that he divided by his word he
[21:24] divided the water that is in the
[21:26] atmosphere and the water that is under
[21:28] the ocean with all the the Seas and and
[21:31] he divided it by his word and in Genesis
[21:34] 1:9 he said and God said let the waters
[21:36] under the heaven be gathered together
[21:38] under one place and let the dry land
[21:40] appear so so again he divided by his
[21:43] word he divided all the water that was
[21:45] just floating around he divided it from
[21:46] the land and caused the land to appear
[21:49] it was his word that separated it's his
[21:52] word that separated during the on the
[21:54] seven days of creation it is his word
[21:56] that separates today you see even but
[21:58] even just now as I'm speaking these
[22:00] words it's his word that separates
[22:02] that'll make you think is he telling the
[22:05] truth is that really true or what's true
[22:09] my own ideas my own conception about
[22:12] what the Bible says or is it true what
[22:14] the Bible says about it what's true and
[22:16] the word actually going forth will
[22:18] separate the truth from the false it
[22:20] will SE separate Faith from unbelief how
[22:24] do we know that because the Bible says
[22:25] in Hebrews 4:12 the word of God is quick
[22:28] and powerful and sharper than any
[22:31] two-edged sword the word is like a sword
[22:34] what does it do it separates it says P
[22:37] piercing even to the dividing aund of
[22:40] Soul and Spirit that the word of God can
[22:43] actually separate and divide so you know
[22:46] what we're talking about when we're
[22:47] preaching about flesh and spirit and
[22:50] soul you know where where the word is
[22:52] hidden and of the joints and Mary and is
[22:54] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[22:56] of the heart amen oh that's really what
[22:59] the preaching of the Gospel is to do
[23:00] it's to not stroke our fur like a kitty
[23:02] that you don't want to upset but it's
[23:04] actually to prick us and make us examine
[23:07] ourselves and and see where we are and
[23:09] what our state is because what it's to
[23:11] it's it's actually like Jesus said in
[23:14] Matthew 10 the word was not given to
[23:16] bring peace but it was actually given to
[23:19] separate to bring division oh you you
[23:22] know you go to a home where where the
[23:24] the father and mother maybe believe in
[23:26] just a nice tape Ministry or something
[23:27] and the other people believe in in
[23:29] things a little bit different way and
[23:31] you can't help but have a Division One
[23:33] Believes going to church the other
[23:35] doesn't believe going to church and you
[23:37] can't help if you stand on what you
[23:39] believe you can't help but be divided
[23:41] there's going to be a divide a division
[23:44] oh but I don't want to be divided from
[23:46] God I want to believe what we might be
[23:48] divided from one another but if we'll
[23:50] keep looking to Christ so that we're
[23:52] United with him he's the one I want to
[23:54] be United with and I want to be
[23:56] separated from all of my unbelief and
[23:58] separated from all of my ideas and
[24:00] separated from all of my will and fully
[24:02] United with him and you'll never be
[24:05] United with God until you're totally
[24:07] separated from all of your unbelief
[24:10] that's what Jesus said think not that I
[24:12] am come to send peace on Earth I came
[24:14] not to send peace but a sword for I am
[24:17] come to set a man at variance against
[24:19] his father and the daughter against her
[24:21] mother and the daughter-in-law against
[24:23] your mother-in-law and a man's foes
[24:25] shall they be of his own household now
[24:27] you know that doesn't mean that we
[24:29] disrespect our mother and father that
[24:31] doesn't mean that we don't honor
[24:32] somebody that's older than us but what
[24:35] it does mean is that you're going to
[24:37] have to stand on what you believe sooner
[24:38] or later and you can't you can't say
[24:41] well I believe this but I'm going to be
[24:42] opposite of that you you you've got to
[24:44] the word of God is what separates us
[24:47] from other separates us from a different
[24:50] walk how could Abraham and lot walk
[24:52] together if lot was leaning toward Sodom
[24:55] and Abraham was leaning toward a
[24:56] personal encounter with mized
[24:58] it's going to separate you sooner or
[25:00] later it's the word was sent to separate
[25:04] that's why John 177 177 says sanctify
[25:08] them through thy truth Thy word is truth
[25:12] and sanctification means separation how
[25:15] how were they Sanctified how were they
[25:17] cleansed by the word of God that
[25:19] actually was was preached for three and
[25:21] a half years until it began to uh bring
[25:23] about a change in their life to where
[25:25] they they begin to leave the old way
[25:28] Peter P you know Peter and them they
[25:29] were probably fishing and and and
[25:31] spouting off some things that they
[25:32] should not to be saying and and you know
[25:34] Peter was renowned for uh uh fishing
[25:37] naked and all that kind of stuff but I
[25:39] tell you what you get Sanctified and
[25:40] you'll start leaving all that old rough
[25:42] way behind it'll begin to change you
[25:45] it'll begin to separate you from your
[25:47] past so that you are changed that's what
[25:49] sanctification means to se set apart or
[25:53] separate for a holy purpose now aren't
[25:57] you glad sitting here tonight that God
[25:58] wants you to be used for a holy purpose
[26:01] aren't you glad that that's what the
[26:03] gospel was for to make you holy to make
[26:06] you clean we we were talking the other
[26:08] night just sitting around about how
[26:09] people in the world they they think a
[26:12] lot of times that their friends are
[26:13] there to help them but really if you
[26:15] really examine it your friends in the
[26:17] world just want to drag you down and
[26:20] keep you keep you in the in like the
[26:22] Crab Pot like crabs being bold alive and
[26:24] it's crabs reaching up to pull you try
[26:26] to get out of the pot and you're friends
[26:28] are reaching down to
[26:31] grab boy I'm I'm enjoying this wine this
[26:34] afternoon wouldn't you like some I'm I'm
[26:37] sure enjoying this I'm enjoying this
[26:39] television show well don't you want to
[26:41] tune in and watch this television show
[26:43] that you know no Christian has any
[26:45] business watching it and your and your
[26:47] friends that you think are so good will
[26:49] drag you down but I tell you what the
[26:50] word of God will separate you and clean
[26:53] you up and and separate you from those
[26:55] old ungodly friends and those old
[26:58] ungodly ways that you ain't got no
[27:00] business hanging around God's word God
[27:03] is light and his word is light and his
[27:06] light is life and that it will separate
[27:08] you from all the darkness all the
[27:10] nonsense of the
[27:12] world nothing likes Darkness but a bunch
[27:14] of cockroaches scrambling around behind
[27:16] the fridge and and all the dark places
[27:18] but you turn on the light you turn on
[27:20] the light and all that will
[27:22] scatter and I I had to put in my
[27:24] disclaimer not not my house
[27:31] I did I did get in trouble recently I
[27:33] preached that at a church and and I
[27:35] didn't put the disclaimer in that didn't
[27:36] sound right
[27:38] so I got to put that disclaimer in not
[27:41] my house but you know you know we've all
[27:45] you go to school you go to a place that
[27:47] a public place or something that's got
[27:49] got bugs and things but you turn on the
[27:51] light and all that will scatter now look
[27:54] it's the same way in the in the gospel
[27:56] if you want to get real of a problem in
[27:59] your life if you want to overcome
[28:01] something bring it to the light oh the
[28:05] gospel is not about doing some shady
[28:06] business in the darkness over in some
[28:08] back alley some some sidebar discussion
[28:11] but you want to get you want to really
[28:12] overcome and get deliverance and do
[28:14] things the right way you bring it into
[28:16] the light and Shine the light on it you
[28:18] want to get rid of something and have a
[28:20] family discussion and get all the family
[28:22] together and say we're going to air this
[28:23] out out in public where everybody knows
[28:26] what's going on and we're going to shine
[28:28] The Gospel Light on this until we've
[28:29] overcome if you want to get rid of that
[28:31] pornography devil then get it out in the
[28:33] light and and confess it and say I'm
[28:35] done with this thing if you want to get
[28:37] rid of them problems in your house get
[28:39] it in the light and you you watch it run
[28:41] away like a
[28:44] cockroach brother R will say now today
[28:46] if God has made a promise and when that
[28:49] promise is Vindicated then that is light
[28:52] that is the light of the day when the
[28:55] word is a Vindicator the word for the
[28:57] hour
[28:58] is a
[29:01] vindictive I thank I thank God tonight
[29:04] that
[29:04] we're we believe in a live word and a
[29:08] live present day
[29:10] light not oh you know we talk about how
[29:13] we're we're preaching we're preaching
[29:15] meat we're preaching the real word but
[29:18] this is not word this is not meat from
[29:20] some bygone day this is not meat like
[29:23] from Martin Luther John Wesley either
[29:25] the Pentecostal day but this is a
[29:27] present tense reality I think that's
[29:29] what differentiates from us from all the
[29:31] all the other churches of the world is
[29:33] this is alive this is not just some
[29:35] theology or something but there's power
[29:38] in this to deliver you and I I think
[29:40] that's that's what brother Bron was
[29:41] talking about when he said an eagle's
[29:43] got to eat fresh meat fresh meat like
[29:46] you go down into the river and an eagle
[29:47] fishes out a trout and it ain't just a
[29:50] trout that it catches it's got some
[29:52] Decay to it but it's it's got some some
[29:55] it's it's still thrashing around a
[29:56] little bit in other words words it still
[29:58] got some blood pulsing in it and that's
[30:00] what we want to Feast on today we want
[30:02] to Feast on the present tense reality of
[30:04] a living God with some meat that's still
[30:07] got some life in it that's what I want
[30:09] to serve every time I preach I want to
[30:11] preach a word that's got some life some
[30:13] power in it that will deliver you not
[30:15] something to just memorize some quotes
[30:17] or just learn some theology but
[30:19] something that will change every fiber
[30:21] of your being something that'll make you
[30:23] walk right and live right and talk right
[30:25] something that will separate you from
[30:27] the things of the world and make you
[30:28] live holy and make you be a real son and
[30:31] daughter of God that's why John 1:4 says
[30:34] in him was life and the life was the
[30:36] light of men the life was the light of
[30:40] men oh every promise in God's word is
[30:42] light amen he separated in Genesis life
[30:45] from death and Genesis CH 3:24 it says
[30:48] so he drove out the man and he placed at
[30:51] the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims
[30:54] and there's that sword again a flaming
[30:57] sword a sword to divide to prevent them
[30:59] from going back I'm Sor what's God doing
[31:02] he's separating Holiness from unbelief
[31:06] and he's placing a sword between to
[31:09] separate unbelief that unclean un look
[31:13] look what what they had gotten
[31:14] themselves into almost something
[31:16] like forgive me if this sounds wrong but
[31:19] almost something it sounds like you
[31:20] you'd find it on Jerry Springer or
[31:22] haraldo or one of all that mess that
[31:24] they had turned into what what do you
[31:26] mean you you got a child of a beast and
[31:29] you almost like you who who's your daddy
[31:31] who one of them situations was like well
[31:33] who's your come on now I'm not trying to
[31:35] make light but this is a real thing and
[31:38] God said go cuz God's like I I I can't
[31:40] you can't come and eat from the Tree of
[31:42] Life in that condition oh all that
[31:44] nonsense and you see that's how some the
[31:46] devil the devil will get us in
[31:48] situations like that in life where your
[31:50] life is just all messed up in chaos and
[31:53] God how how is God going to fulfill his
[31:56] promises in in a situation like that
[31:58] he's got to have a holy being that he
[32:01] can work through he's got to have a holy
[32:03] life that he can fulfill his promises in
[32:05] and that's why he put that flaming sword
[32:07] there which turned every way to keep the
[32:10] way of the tree of life you can't eat
[32:12] from the Tree of Life if you ain't
[32:13] living a holy life you can't eat from
[32:16] this tree of life if you ain't separated
[32:18] oh church if you want to eat from this
[32:20] tree of life you got to get your life
[32:22] cleaned up and how better way to get
[32:24] your life cleaned up by the word let the
[32:26] word begin to get a subject oh let the
[32:28] word begin to move in your life and it
[32:30] you'll watch all that unbelief and
[32:32] everything begin to drop away because
[32:34] the Tree of Life separates and access to
[32:37] the Tree of Life requires separation oh
[32:41] Eve questioned just one little phase of
[32:43] God's word brother Bram said if we
[32:44] believe the word of God it is the Word
[32:47] of Life to us but if we question the
[32:49] word of God it's death to
[32:52] us do you see what brother Ram's message
[32:54] is molding us into to a place where we
[32:57] don't doubt not one thing we're not like
[33:00] Sarah sitting back in the tent
[33:01] snickering at the promise of the son of
[33:03] man we're not like lot wanting to go
[33:05] down to the Sodom and Eden or we're not
[33:07] like the children of Israel wanting
[33:09] their leaks and onions back where they
[33:11] came from but we're we're we're we're
[33:13] the the unbelief is dropping away from
[33:15] our life to where we can believe truly
[33:17] that all things are possible that's our
[33:20] problem that we just can't grasp that
[33:22] these promises laying here in the word
[33:23] are really for us even now we're
[33:26] battling it out is it really for me is
[33:28] it really here here on this on this
[33:30] Wednesday night meeting in the middle of
[33:31] the week is all these promises really
[33:33] for me can I hear in the middle of the
[33:36] week after I've been working hard all
[33:38] week can I really get a fresh outpouring
[33:40] of the Holy Ghost is the power of God
[33:42] still manifested in my life and you know
[33:44] that brother R said that's what lot
[33:45] typed the type of somebody who says well
[33:48] I don't know if the days of Miracles are
[33:50] passed or not I don't know if the
[33:52] promises of God are really true I don't
[33:54] know if discernment really is true I
[33:56] don't know if the word will do what it
[33:58] says it will but the word of God is
[34:00] still operating it's still separating
[34:03] and it will do what it says it'll do
[34:05] because there's a God backing it up that
[34:06] doesn't forget his
[34:08] promises that's what Isaiah chapter 60
[34:10] said behold the darkness shall cover the
[34:13] Earth and gross Darkness to people but
[34:16] the Lord shall arise upon thee and His
[34:19] glory shall be seen upon thee and the
[34:22] Gentiles shall come to thy light and
[34:24] Kings to the brightness of thy Rising
[34:27] God will
[34:29] continually continually has been
[34:31] separating and that's what he's doing
[34:32] tonight he's still speaking his Word of
[34:35] Life to those who want to believe it and
[34:37] the world is in Gross
[34:41] Darkness he said you can see it in every
[34:43] meeting he separates Faith from unbelief
[34:46] he speaks out he declares himself to
[34:49] those who will believe and have faith in
[34:51] him he's separating separating and every
[34:55] meeting separating separating separating
[34:58] until the final separation when they'll
[35:00] separate the sheep from the goats he's
[35:03] separating separating and you
[35:06] know that Hebrew word Nazir there's a
[35:09] Hebrew word Nazir that means consecrated
[35:13] or separated now if you're a Nazir to be
[35:17] a Nazir you have to take a vow to be
[35:21] separated to be consecrated and the kind
[35:24] of vow you have to take is called a
[35:27] Nazarite vow and that Nazarite vow means
[35:30] I I'm I'm doing away with all of my own
[35:33] will I I'm doing away with I I I'm
[35:35] separating myself to totally totally to
[35:39] God and when you separate yourself by
[35:42] taking a Nazarite vow it symbolized a
[35:44] total dedication to God now brother BR
[35:48] didn't explain these things just so we'd
[35:49] learn about it but he explained it so
[35:51] that it would Inspire something in us so
[35:54] when we go home there's something
[35:55] stirring within us that I want to be
[35:57] like like that I want to be separated to
[36:00] God so much that God can use me that he
[36:02] can come down and speak to me in the
[36:04] cool of the evening like he did Adam and
[36:06] speak to me like he did Abraham and
[36:08] reveal himself to me like he did Moses
[36:10] in the burning bush I want to be
[36:11] identified with those characters I want
[36:14] to be separated like Samson was it
[36:17] emphasized Holiness and separation from
[36:19] worldly pleasures and impurities if
[36:21] you're going to be a nerite you can't be
[36:23] drinking alcohol cuz you're separated oh
[36:25] oh but we've got so carried away and
[36:27] today well I think I can take a little
[36:29] tody every now and then I think I can
[36:31] get all caught up and all the stuff that
[36:33] the world is doing but if you're going
[36:34] to be a Nazarite you can't do it if
[36:37] you're going to be a real if you're
[36:39] going to be the antitype of the what the
[36:40] levitical priests were you can't be
[36:45] go you got to stay away from that stuff
[36:48] and it a Nazarite vow produces something
[36:51] that is visible visible in the life of
[36:54] the believer you know they got Samson
[36:57] had his seven long locks that everywhere
[36:59] he went they could look and see well he
[37:01] has taken a vow of separation and that's
[37:04] true in in the life of our sisters today
[37:06] you you when you go through Walmart
[37:08] everybody will look at you because you
[37:10] are different and that's what God wants
[37:12] us to be he wants us to be different he
[37:15] don't want us to look like the world and
[37:16] look like the trash and the Holiness of
[37:18] the world but he wants to I'm sorry if
[37:20] that offend you but listen it's like a
[37:23] garbage can out there and forgive me if
[37:26] that offends you that I use the word
[37:27] trash but that is it's a garbage can out
[37:29] there and God doesn't call you to live
[37:31] like a garbage can he doesn't call you
[37:33] to look at the smut and trash of the
[37:35] world but he's called you to live a holy
[37:37] clean life and God is going to have a
[37:40] holy clean life I feel like screaming
[37:43] out like brother Ram did when he saw
[37:44] that church walking by at the end and he
[37:46] said get in line you got to get in line
[37:49] if you want to take a Rapture you got to
[37:51] get in line and it's going to be visible
[37:53] a Nazarite vow is going to be visible
[37:56] where somebody can look at you the world
[37:58] can look at you and say that person is
[38:01] separate they've been separated to
[38:03] something maybe they don't understand
[38:04] what it is but they know that you ain't
[38:06] like them you ain't like them something
[38:08] has got a hold of you and the Nazarite
[38:11] vow required personal sacrifice and
[38:15] discipline I wonder tonight how many of
[38:16] us could say that we're really
[38:17] disciplined I I like what Brother
[38:19] Richard Wilson said he said make time
[38:21] for the word it's my life and sometimes
[38:25] we get it we get that frame in our mind
[38:27] well I I I got to make time to read my
[38:29] Bible I got to make time to read re to
[38:32] to to pray but is it really your life
[38:35] then if you got to set aside time and
[38:37] you got to lay aside all that nastiness
[38:39] on TV to make time for God is it really
[38:41] your life it's supposed to be your life
[38:44] if you love it it'll be your life it'll
[38:45] be your everything it'll be your all if
[38:47] you're really in love with Jesus Christ
[38:51] and the numb the CH sixth chapter a
[38:53] Nazarite call was to separate themselves
[38:56] from all the world separated separated
[38:59] nothing nothing of the world separated
[39:01] no strong drink and no contact with the
[39:05] dead you got to stay away from any dead
[39:08] thing anything that will bring will
[39:09] cause you any kind of a hindrance no
[39:12] contact with the dead and no razors
[39:14] which is why our sisters don't cut their
[39:16] hair because it's a separation you're
[39:19] showing you're that's what Paul said you
[39:21] you don't cut your hair because of the
[39:23] angels and the angels are the
[39:25] ministering spirits that bring you the
[39:27] word and so you're not cutting your hair
[39:29] because you believe the word of God that
[39:32] has been preached and it is a visible
[39:34] sign to you that you are subject to the
[39:36] word of God that has been held over your
[39:38] life that's why brother Rand would say
[39:40] today when we see our sisters wearing
[39:42] long hair as the Bible said they should
[39:44] I think it's a Nazarite sign that they
[39:46] want to follow the lord listen what he
[39:49] said no matter what the
[39:52] price no matter what the
[39:55] price well people at school make fun of
[39:57] me yeah but God's Got Your
[40:00] Back people at work make fun of me yeah
[40:04] but God's on your
[40:05] side listen when when the time comes
[40:07] when when people are getting laid off
[40:09] and and and people are losing their jobs
[40:12] and and and people that you graduate
[40:14] with can't find work oh it'll be good to
[40:16] have God on your side and we're not
[40:19] doing thing we're not working to get a
[40:21] reward but I tell you what God looks and
[40:23] sees when you got faith and you're
[40:25] living a separated life because because
[40:27] you're in love with him and you're want
[40:28] to live for him God knows God knows if
[40:31] you're a real believer he knows if
[40:33] you're a real Abraham if you're a real
[40:35] believer like that I'm telling you it's
[40:37] good to be separated I thank God that
[40:40] God has given us the ability to live a
[40:41] separated holy life that's clean that's
[40:44] Sanctified that's set apart from the
[40:46] world and oh when we go to bed at night
[40:49] that our whole home can have an
[40:50] atmosphere of peace and it's not chaos
[40:53] with the television playing all kinds of
[40:54] stuff on it but we're living in a in a
[40:57] God God can change the atmosphere of our
[41:00] being and change the atmosphere of our
[41:01] mind so that we're not living all called
[41:03] up with all these mind battles and
[41:05] things like the world brother said I
[41:07] believe tonight that every man woman
[41:09] every boy and girl that's born of the
[41:11] spirit of God is a Nazarite under the
[41:13] Lord because they have separated
[41:15] themselves from the cares of the world
[41:17] and whatever the world has got to say
[41:20] you are a separated people holy unto the
[41:24] Lord now when brother R was preaching
[41:25] this this this quotee is from another
[41:27] message he said you are not the same as
[41:32] them and later on this message he'll get
[41:34] to the
[41:36] point there's silver dollars and there's
[41:38] pennies you ain't the same you are a
[41:42] separated people oh God don't want you
[41:45] to be the same he don't want you to be
[41:48] the same as everybody out there you are
[41:51] different and you are different because
[41:54] of the the effect that the word has had
[41:56] on your life not by any particular
[41:58] goodness or something righteousness in
[42:00] yourself but the effect that the word
[42:02] has had on your life has changed you and
[42:05] that has made you a separated people
[42:08] holy unto the Lord dedicated to the word
[42:11] and the spirit of
[42:12] God the Holy Spirit brother said in the
[42:15] message the token he said the holy
[42:16] spirit is an eternal token written
[42:18] across your heart soul make up Mind Body
[42:21] everything else that you are a separated
[42:24] person from unbelief you're a separated
[42:26] person from the things of the world you
[42:28] are separated from Death you're
[42:31] separated from everything and you are a
[42:34] product that God has sealed into the
[42:36] kingdom by his holy spirit that's
[42:40] through separation is the only way to
[42:42] bring light now listen education can't
[42:44] do it and we're not talking about
[42:47] education at the school we're talking
[42:49] about education in the church education
[42:52] won't do it am learning and rot
[42:55] memorization and just learning
[42:56] everything oh but you got to have a
[42:58] personal revelation of Jesus Christ
[43:01] Science can't do it history and math
[43:03] can't do it but God has one way of
[43:06] bringing light to you that's when you're
[43:08] ready to separate yourself from all the
[43:12] things of the world and all the cares of
[43:14] the world and cling only to God's
[43:16] promised word now that's that's been the
[43:19] problem all down Through the Ages hadn't
[43:20] it people not don't want to separate
[43:23] right Eve went out and unbelieved and
[43:25] she just never really got into in her
[43:27] head that she had done something wrong
[43:29] she just didn't want to separate from
[43:31] that always carrying along well I I
[43:34] think surely there's something good that
[43:36] come out of this that's our problem
[43:38] isn't it we think our way is the right
[43:40] way to do it and we're just not ready to
[43:42] separate oursel we're not ready to be a
[43:46] real Nazarite you know brother Brown
[43:48] said now this is a maybe a choker Paul
[43:51] was a Nazarite he was separated now now
[43:55] listen that means that Paul was a
[43:57] Nazarite then I can be a Nazarite and
[44:00] you can be a Nazarite a real Nazarite
[44:03] cuz a Nazarite is a nazer that is
[44:06] separated somebody that has left
[44:08] everything behind Paul was separated
[44:11] from his Orthodox Church to the word of
[44:13] the Living God he said it is a total
[44:16] separation we're not to go back into the
[44:18] world no more or have anything to do
[44:20] with the world but cleave only unto God
[44:23] and Jesus is coming after a bride a
[44:25] woman a church that separate at from the
[44:27] cares of the world she is separated from
[44:30] the Fashions of this Modern Age that we
[44:32] live in oh praise God that means when
[44:34] you go into the supermarket aisle and
[44:37] see how the world's dressing or you see
[44:38] how all your friends dressing you don't
[44:40] have to dress like that where everybody
[44:42] can see every curve and every dimple and
[44:44] everything every everything about you
[44:46] and there's no no secret left to be
[44:48] revealed but you don't have to live like
[44:50] that you are separated from that she is
[44:52] separated from the traditions of
[44:54] churches she is separated only to God
[44:57] and God is the word and as husband and
[44:59] wife is one so does the bride and the
[45:01] word become one for the word is living
[45:04] through the bride oh and that's our
[45:07] identification brother R would say that
[45:09] is your credentials as a
[45:12] Believer aren't you glad tonight that
[45:15] we've got that as an
[45:16] identification you know you know going
[45:18] through your Christian Journey people
[45:20] want to identify you and label you as
[45:22] this or
[45:23] that right but we don't have to we don't
[45:26] have to go by how they label us they
[45:28] might label us as a Pentecostal or a
[45:31] charismatic and you know people will try
[45:33] to label you by what church you go to oh
[45:36] well oh you come from Lula or whatever
[45:38] they'll put that label on you and that
[45:40] might mean different things to different
[45:42] people might Pentecostal charismatic
[45:45] fundamental whatever they might put you
[45:47] know they tried to put a label on Jesus
[45:48] that he was beelove but that wasn't his
[45:51] identification that wasn't his
[45:53] credentials our credentials come from
[45:56] the word of God and brother BR said the
[45:58] only credential that a Believer has is
[46:00] the word of God living in him declaring
[46:02] Jesus Christ lives in that person it's
[46:04] the only credential you need that's the
[46:06] only credential we need people will put
[46:08] labels on you and tell you this and that
[46:10] and tell you you look weird you look
[46:11] funny because you're living a separated
[46:13] life what kind of a oddl looking thing
[46:16] must a Nazarite been with his his Seven
[46:18] Locks hanging down from the back of his
[46:19] head oh but he didn't take his
[46:21] identification from what people called
[46:23] him but boy the word of God said about
[46:25] him and oh praise God when I look into
[46:28] the word and I can be identified with
[46:29] what the word of God says I am and be
[46:31] glad I I can be glad to live a so holy
[46:34] separated life he said that's a
[46:36] separated Nazarite unto the Lord
[46:38] separated for the word's
[46:41] sake separate yourself from the woman of
[46:44] this world join yourself to the Bel
[46:47] blessings that God has promised to every
[46:51] believer lot was like a perfect type of
[46:54] the lukewarm carnal-minded believer
[46:56] today that still wants to cling with
[46:57] what their tradition says instead of
[47:00] taking what the word
[47:02] says yeah I'm I'm trying to I'm trying
[47:05] to find a place to helicopter
[47:08] in I y'all I I don't like going over 45
[47:11] minutes on is that I'm trying
[47:13] to he said when the second Adam was
[47:15] created in the womb of a woman and came
[47:17] to the world he was a Nazarite to the
[47:19] word of God so Jesus's whole life was
[47:21] totally separated from the cradle all
[47:25] the way to the culmination of his
[47:26] ministry there was oh you think about
[47:28] what an example Jesus was there was no
[47:30] unbelief found in him nowhere he said
[47:33] who can condemn me of sin sin is
[47:35] unbelief if I haven't done just what was
[47:37] prophesied for this age if I haven't met
[47:39] the requirements of what Messiah is
[47:41] supposed to do then don't believe me
[47:43] search the scriptures for in them you
[47:45] think you have eternal life and they are
[47:47] they that testify of me tell you who he
[47:50] is so there's our real identification
[47:52] when the scripture says the scripture
[47:54] said who he was and the scripture will
[47:56] say who you are because every scripture
[47:59] that speaks of Jesus also speaks of you
[48:01] because you're part of him and you're
[48:02] wrapped up in him he he said that's why
[48:05] he said that Greater Works than these
[48:06] shall you do because you're going to do
[48:08] the same thing you're going to act the
[48:10] same way because the same life that was
[48:12] in Jesus is in you and that makes you a
[48:16] separated set aart people and any real
[48:19] born again Christian is a Nazarite
[48:21] totally
[48:23] separated oh there's a question for us
[48:25] tonight how separated are
[48:27] we all always brother Bram said the word
[48:30] requires total and complete separation
[48:34] Jesus said let every man's word be a lie
[48:37] let mine be true and that should guide
[48:40] the compass of our life something pops
[48:43] into our mind that's contrary to the
[48:45] word cast it down I I can't I can't
[48:47] agree with that I'm not going forward
[48:49] with that it's not possible it's not
[48:51] true the devil that's that's the devil
[48:54] the devil's tactic is to give us some
[48:56] reasonable out just something reasonable
[48:59] and then we'll accept it something
[49:01] reasonable come come with well I I it
[49:04] it's reasonable to think that the
[49:05] doctor's report is true oh but if God's
[49:08] word says contrary to that take God's
[49:10] word because he he God backs up his
[49:14] promises Isaiah was separated from the
[49:17] church World Moses was separated from
[49:19] the church world and all the prophets
[49:20] and Jesus and the
[49:22] apostles and and and all the way down to
[49:25] Abraham who was a separated person from
[49:27] the world GE God told him separate
[49:30] yourself from your Kindred and from all
[49:32] of the unbelief and come out into a
[49:33] world that you've never walked in before
[49:36] and amongst a people that you've never
[49:38] known before come out and separate
[49:41] yourself from anybody that would be
[49:42] contrary to what you're believing that
[49:44] you would be a Nazarite under the Lord
[49:47] because he was holding a promise of a
[49:51] son and you know today we're holding
[49:53] that same promise not the promise of
[49:56] Isaac but we're holding a promise of a
[49:58] son to see God fully manifested in our
[50:01] lives and he's not going to be fully
[50:04] manifested until we separate from all
[50:07] unbelief Abraham had to separate he had
[50:09] to leave C he had to separate from his
[50:12] father and from his mother and from his
[50:14] Kindred and what separated him tonight
[50:17] because he
[50:18] believed that God was able to keep the
[50:21] promise that he had given he believed
[50:25] and lot did not lot could not believe
[50:29] that the days of P the days of Miracles
[50:31] were not passed he went down into Sodom
[50:34] and gamorra after all that but Abraham
[50:37] held on and God in a human form sat down
[50:41] before him and talked and Sarah was
[50:43] almost a hundred years old laughed
[50:46] because the angel said I will visit you
[50:48] according to the time of promise now now
[50:52] here's and I'm going to be closing in
[50:53] just a second but here's the strange one
[50:56] of the strangest things that brother
[50:58] random would ever say is that all
[51:00] believers are not the same that lot lot
[51:04] was like a penny and Abraham was like a
[51:06] silver dollar lot wanted the world lot
[51:10] he brother would say you pull out a
[51:11] bunch of change there's pennies nickels
[51:13] dimes quarters half dollars dollars all
[51:16] in coins now that's where the world is
[51:18] in God's hand there's some people that
[51:20] just can have a Penny's worth of it and
[51:23] God can only use them in a penny way
[51:26] that's all all they can buy don't reject
[51:29] them if they can't believe the real
[51:31] truth don't turn them down don't kick
[51:33] them out and say they're not in it
[51:34] because God uses penni sometimes lot was
[51:37] just a penny Abraham was a silver dollar
[51:41] so it taken a hundred lots to make in
[51:44] Abraham now how do we know which one we
[51:47] are if the if our credentials are the
[51:50] word of God and the word of God is our
[51:53] identification that's how we know what
[51:55] we are if I identify myself with Abraham
[51:58] if I identify myself with lot that tells
[52:01] what we are so when you read the Bible
[52:03] oh that's what the the power of the
[52:06] Gospel is when you get along in the
[52:07] morning time with your coffee and you're
[52:09] reading through the Bible it's actually
[52:12] it it's like taking a DNA test it
[52:14] identifies back to show you who your
[52:16] daddy is it identifies back to show
[52:19] where you come from to identify you it
[52:22] is your identification and it will show
[52:24] you what you are oh this morning I want
[52:26] or tonight I want to encourage you I I I
[52:28] don't want to just have a little Penny
[52:30] amount of Faith but I want to have
[52:32] enough faith in my life I want to have
[52:33] enough enough separation from unbelief
[52:36] to where if I want if I desire something
[52:39] big from God and we're talking about a
[52:41] promised son you're going to have to
[52:43] have silver dollar Faith to see the
[52:45] promised son you can't have a little
[52:47] Penny faith and see the son of man
[52:49] revealed in your life you got to have
[52:51] silver dollar faith brother Brown even
[52:53] said he said in one place we got to have
[52:55] we got we can barely have of faith for a
[52:57] two twoth how are we going to take a
[52:58] Rapture how are you going to take a
[53:00] Rapture with a little Penny Faith oh and
[53:04] see how he's identifying us with our
[53:07] faith God don't care what you look like
[53:09] or how you part your hair or but he
[53:11] cares about your faith do you believe
[53:14] his word and your faith is tied to how
[53:17] he's looking at you are you are you
[53:19] somebody that was going to believe
[53:20] everything he said or you somebody
[53:21] that's going to can't can't can't really
[53:24] can't really believe that he's still a
[53:26] present in tense help that there's still
[53:28] power in this gospel oh lot was just a
[53:31] penny and Abraham was a silver dollar he
[53:34] said he can only take a Penny's worth
[53:35] that's all he's got so you see people
[53:37] that say I don't believe in healing I
[53:39] don't believe in these things just know
[53:41] it's a penny but just let him alone see
[53:43] just a Penny's worth so that's all he
[53:46] can buy don't stop him just let him
[53:48] alone remember that's just all the
[53:49] farther he can go he said he lot
[53:52] couldn't believe in discernment and the
[53:55] powers of God that's promise for this
[53:57] day but I might not be able to
[53:59] understand all that's in there but I
[54:00] believe it it's God's word I want to
[54:03] separate myself from anything that's
[54:06] contrary to it that's right how do we
[54:08] separate ourselves we get into the
[54:10] rhythm of the
[54:11] word get into the word because the
[54:13] rhythm of the word as you're going
[54:15] through the Sheep music it'll tell you
[54:17] what's coming up and and and I'm trying
[54:19] to make it short here but brother R
[54:20] going say the sheet music will tell you
[54:24] whether you're an Abraham or whether
[54:26] you're a lot and what's going to happen
[54:28] next what's coming up down the road
[54:30] it'll tell you all these things if we'll
[54:33] just get in the rhythm of the word to
[54:35] separate ourselves fully from unbelief
[54:37] fully from the word fully so that we can
[54:40] take God at his word if God said it and
[54:43] you know as the musicians come forward
[54:45] the bride will be separated the bride
[54:48] will be totally separated from the world
[54:51] the bride has to be separated to move
[54:54] into the promises if God promised it you
[54:57] can have access to it but you got to
[54:59] separate yourself from your
[55:01] unbelief brother R will say these words
[55:03] are you willing to separate yourself
[55:05] tonight from all unbelief to hear the
[55:07] word of the Lord if you'll do it and
[55:10] believe that he is the same yesterday
[55:12] today and forever these things what he
[55:15] has promised to do we see him doing it
[55:18] we see him we've seen so many things
[55:20] that God has done uh this weekend I was
[55:22] talking to Zach and Lily and Lily was
[55:24] telling us about her her brother
[55:26] brother-in-law how he got electrocuted
[55:28] and his shoulder was shattered his the
[55:31] socket was shattered in his shoulder and
[55:34] they were going to have to do all this
[55:35] surgery on him but you know what the the
[55:38] church got together and they prayed and
[55:41] they got some saints together that
[55:42] believed that the power of God was still
[55:44] real and they did another X-Ray when he
[55:46] went back to the doctor and there wasn't
[55:48] nothing wrong and the doctor was mixed
[55:50] mystified they gathered around because
[55:52] that shoulder that they had seen was
[55:54] shattered and he couldn't use it was
[55:57] completely healed
[56:02] and oh that's why tonight we're not
[56:05] talking about just some meat from some
[56:06] bygone age but we're talking about some
[56:08] meat with some blood in it some meat
[56:11] that's still pulsing some they still got
[56:13] some thrashing around in it like a
[56:15] little trout that an eagle just pulls
[56:16] out of the stream there's some life in
[56:19] it it's not something dead it's not
[56:21] something dead from byone asan tonight I
[56:23] invite you as we stand to our feet if
[56:25] you need something tonight I believe
[56:27] that we can have confidence in a present
[56:30] tense Living God if we'll just SE
[56:32] separate oursel lay down our unbelief
[56:34] lay down all those carnal ideas that the
[56:37] devil's trying to throw at us to say
[56:39] well you can't have it it's it's too
[56:41] late it's it's beyond the reach of
[56:43] anything that God can do well that's
[56:45] what the doctor said when when they
[56:47] looked at his shattered shoulder but
[56:49] that ain't what God Said and that ain't
[56:51] what those Believers said when they laid
[56:53] hands on him that oh we're serving a god
[56:56] is still God he's still the same
[56:59] yesterday today and forever and tonight
[57:02] maybe remember all those times maybe
[57:05] years ago that God come on the scene for
[57:07] you and remember that and let that lift
[57:09] up your faith to to so that you realize
[57:11] that that same God that was with you
[57:13] then he's still with you today if you
[57:16] can just believe him you love the Lord
[57:19] let's worship
[57:20] him if you have a need come forward and
[57:23] we'll be glad to pray with you thou
[57:25] strong
