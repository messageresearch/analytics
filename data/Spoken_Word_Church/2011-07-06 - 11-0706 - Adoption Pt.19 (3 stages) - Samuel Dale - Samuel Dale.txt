I'm gonna start reading about verse 36 this is right where the remember after the crucifixion and the and all and and the Lord is kind of a rumor around it he has risen and the two on the road to Emmaus is uh going and and the Lord appears to them and then they're gone back now to the disciples and they're beginning to relate to them you know of the things and we'll start reading in verse 36. and as they speak Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said saith unto them peace be unto you but they were terrified in afraid and suppose that they had seen a spirit and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do you're right why do thoughts arise in your hearts behold my hands and my feet that is it is I myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as you see me have and when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet and while they yet believe not for joy and wondered he said unto them have you any meat in order he's trying to make it to where then make sure that they understand he's real see so he says now you know in other words see me feel my hand handle me doing this that and the other and all now he's telling them what have you any meat and they gave him a piece of boiled fish and of a honeycomb and he took it and did eat thereof and did eat before them and he said unto them these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me then he then opened heed or understanding that they might understand the scriptures now watch what he opened he did not open all the understanding of the Bible That's not no reference no thoughts whatsoever involved in it he didn't open all of the understanding he only opened the the specific point and go to verse 46 and you'll see what he opened towards 45 and he opened her understanding but they might understand the scriptures and he said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoove Christ to suffer and to rise from the day at the third day and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and your Witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but Terry you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now when we get back to that in a minute you think about it he didn't open their understanding of all the scriptures he just opened the understanding of the things that was related to that specific point or time or whatever that he was doing and dealing with them all right now but we we that's it if you will study the message next now it is the rising of the Sun and just you know follow the things through there and you will find the whole point of the message that we'll be trying to get to you know in in the further of the preaching but this one I want you to think about it and see I haven't taken as maybe you thought I would or just to take the future home and read a lot we've read a lot in it and I don't misunderstand somebody on takes it my Lord's read the whole book well that's pretty well true but I mean I just wasn't dealing with uh trying to show this justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost because we should understand that that should be simple to us as we read the the prophet's message of the future home that there of the uh you know and seeing the the point of he said I want you to make sure and get the Plan of Redemption so we believe in what we believe in three stages in the bases or whatever you want to call it three steps um you use your own words as to applying to the soul of the individual and you could read in there what the prophet said about how that you know justification just chops off your past sins all right it says does nothing to the Future it's just a repentance in other words you come up and you recognize and you realize that the goodness of God the scripture said is what caused us to repentance see now just to repent is is not it it's when God calls you to repent brother Tom said one time we was talking he and I to this man and he said something and the guy and the guy said well I said saying I'm sorry it's simple you know that's just words in other words you don't mean it it's just words see so you can do that and a lot of people repent and all but uh you know maybe they don't go on to uh cleansing and and all of the doing what they need to do you know because if you repent of something you shouldn't want to go back and do that again you should want to get away from that you know and feel sorry for the way you've been all right then we we know from the future home that sanctification is a cleansing and setting aside of the heart of the individual see to worry that God can come and dwell because he's not going to dwell according to the scriptures he won't dwell in an unclean vessel all right so if he's not going to dwell in an unclean vessel then he had to cleanse it so you know like he says you've taken you go out into the yard and you see a glass or a cup or something and you pick it up that's you know you take that and that's justifying it you've got a use for it right all right and then see that's what God done with us he had to use for us so he he called us to himself and and then sanctification you take that in and you wash it and you cleanse it real good you know and and you get everything out of it because you don't want to put it in service while it's dirty right but sanctification is a cleansing and setting aside so that soul of the individual has to be washed of all of the old adamic nature and self that what we are and cleansed and you know and and come to church and and believing and seeing that we need to to live for the Lord and and you know be better and and be cleansed and set aside amen but see that's not the whole story and there's where the problem is that a lot of people do that and and they'll come to church and they begin to do that and they get a religious atmosphere about them and they they'll come to church and live in the church and do and and all but they don't go on to receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit see and if they don't go on to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit then it's not God's fault and see then there are some things left of us that just when we're Sanctified even though you're cleansed and set aside you need to fire a baptism that's why the scripture calls it the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire right the fire comes to burn out everything about us this left in the soul right all right the word God can come and and the prophet said in the future homes you ready makes it a place for God to dwell all right and see then that's why I believe that that the soul of the individual is eternal but the body and spirit is not Eternal right it's still in a separate even though we are a unit yes of Body Spirit and soul we're a unit and you'd say soul as a being right that's fine but just remember a Christian cannot sin in the soul right right so if a Christian sins and the prophet said he sinned every day so that sells it but that's you know and the Bible said if you say you sin not you make God a liar right all right because you know that's that's you know you can really lay down but ain't no need of it we ought to move on man see but see we we need to to see then that the body and the spirit of the individual is not fully redeemed right all right the soul is what's redeemed page 49 future home and you're waiting the Redemption of the body right then we found from the future home and studying it that the world this Earth in the days of Noah went through a time of washing it off right to justify it all right cleanse it to make a new world you know tumbled it all over and they dig down now for thousands of feet and uh uh the boss Daddy was telling me the other day he just read an article where they had went down like in a coal mine or some kind of an underground something and they found a modern day ship thousands of feet down below the surface sure right and you said well I don't know about that well they were modern in the days of the flood and where did all that go to all right you know where'd all just get dumped to they're finding things now that are that are just amazing you know way underground and things and and and you go up here in Kentucky and find uh alligator fossils wet up on the mountain you know but see it was a turmoil a twisting and turning in the days of of Noah right and the world was justified all right and then we found that the prophet was teaching that it had it that when Jesus was crucified that his blood dropped down on the earth to cleanse and claim the Earth all right so we're not going to get as we study then see and the Bible says the word pass away and we all thought that one of these days this world is going to be blasted away you know and we didn't think about where we was going to live or what was going to do but we found out that's not correct that it's going to be washed off cleansed and burned off right as far as man has tampered with it so it's the cosmos that's destroyed the world order amen and the situation of man all right but see it's already went through justification in the days of Noah sanctification when Jesus dropped his blood on it to cleanse and claim it this world this Earth all right but one day it will receive its fiery baptism right to burn off everything right and that'll not only be just a natural burning it will be a spiritual burning that will destroy Satan and all of his angels and the things that are wrong and it'll be a fiery baptism all right so then the Earth is in the process of being redeemed right but it's not in the finished part of it yeah right all right now see then we got to talking about it and see then now what are you going to do about your body because your body was in the earth so you can cover then about the body in the earth in the days of Noah when the world was washed off and and then you could talk about that it was in the earth in the days of when Jesus dropped his blood on it and claimed it but surely we don't want to have to wait until after the Millennium right is when the world is to be burned with fire and cleansed so we surely don't want to have to wait that long to get our you know redeemed body that's right see so then we must step ahead of the world or the Earth you know receive our body amen because God is not going to destroy the world so then he doesn't destroy our body he redeems it amen all right and see then I I believe in a rediction of the body right I don't believe in a replacement I don't believe in getting a new body I believe in this body being made new all right amen this body will become Eternal turn back to where we're we're 18 20 years old but it won't just turn back there and start right back over again in age Factor amen it's to redeem right all right see then in that then we came to the end of it to talk about and I just mentioned it at the end of the message I said I'll get back to this all right that when you receive the new birth and I'm not going to try to prove a lot of points tonight I'm going to preach something to you and then the Lord willing will pick up Sunday and bring some more into uh showing you from the scriptures maybe in the things of of what the prophet is saying about it because see I believe we're going to be changed here right now because we read the Bible and we found in the Bible that we shall not all sleep right in first Thessalonians 15 learn about verse 5 that will not all sleep we're not all going to have to die and go by the ground that's right somebody's going to be changed right all right sure thing and doing that then we see that our bodies don't have to be destroyed it's not destroyed amen see it's redeemed right all right see then we we've talked about it and and we've seen that that even the scripture says you know in first Thessalonians that Paul explains how let this Rapture this change these things would take place that the Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of an archangel and a trumpet you know and and the dead in Christ shall rise first so why would we be looking for another body when the Bible had already been speaking of thee and has always spoken of even in the types and the Shadows of the Prophet that the Earth is to be redeemed you know why would we want to think about getting a new body but see that's people like if they look at their old cells and they just can't see how God can do anything with that well he's he's if he's lift it like it is it would be a problem right but see we already have the types and the Shadows we already have Abraham and Sarah turn back see to show us that we're going to go back to be young again right but remember the Earth was just a type that was turned back in all right they got old and died all right but that see this group of people in the income is not going to have to die right because we already know the message right right but is it a reality to us or is it as a quote now I'm asking you a simple point I try to to get across something to you in thinking and and try to help you to understand because we always read first Thessalonians and we said we wouldn't all sleep we would be changed right right that's all we bred around it come and add that to the Bible that was in the Bible we read that when where's the Baptist and we talked about it all right and we talked about it now no we didn't understand all of it right that's why I don't want to get you to them in amen but we read in Thessalonians that the Lord had said with the sin from Heavenly shout sure we had an attitude to do trumpets we had all kind of things but at least we could read all right right we could read why then would we be looking for another body I want to get that point to you could you say what but but but now brother there we we studied those scriptures we didn't have the understanding that we now have no but we had the reading of the scripture that's right that's right and we read them and talked about them why would we be looking for another body but to prove we didn't understand to prove we did not understand what Paul and Peter I mean Paul was saying in Thessalonians and Corinthians to prove we didn't understand it we believe we were going to get another body right now you know yourself you believe that I believe that we all believe that before this message came amen right so you pull him no I mean well go ahead and forget it but listen we proved what we believe about the scriptures by our self-interpretation amen of the fact that we were going to get a new body right amen right right now could it be that we still have um come on those problems come on Amen right but after all the prophet has said now prove the point after all that run around him has said about resurrection's not replacement what goes down comes up even Jesus would came up with nail prints in his hands and all other things all of that after all is said done a large portion of this message people still believe you're going to get another body yeah that's right exactly right so now it goes to prove do you understand right I like to I like to put something down there say boom now just get around that you know just dig a hole all you want to to get around that statement I just made because you're going to work yourself to death and when you get through you're gonna come right back all right amen and how to admit what was said was right right amen but see people are not going to admit it right they're going to keep going down the road right it won't work out all right now why would we be looking for a new body when we've got all of the background to show us that we're not to do that right amen but it's just body redeemed amen amen then we prove we don't oh but I've got all these posts written I got all these quotes I got all these quotes that are screwdriver way man right but will it line up with the Bible come on yeah right there amen will it line up with the Prophet come on no you have to deny some of the things he said all right bring me anything he said about a new body run said we're getting you Bobby I'll give you an isolated quote before he said we're gonna get a new body yeah but then take all the other statements where he said this body redeemed so what's he talking about come on Amen is he saying there's going to be a new body or is he just saying this body is going to be you right and he doesn't say it the way we want it in words right right which one is it yeah see do we understand all right but now listen could we be at the place the disciples were that we just read about no brother Dave we got the Holy Ghost what with the Holy Ghost right could we still be that way right because if you ever thought about the disciples Jesus opened their understanding of the scriptures and that was before Pentecost right right man we just read it in Luke till then you can have your understanding of the scriptures opened and still not have the new birth right amen I got one amen a couple of headshakes Amen you know but listen is it possible that we stand in the same way they stand or even move us up with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you think about this a minute now you know that in Oral Roberts University they say they have brother Brown's message and that they study it you know that uh Neil frisbee was one they called a scroll Prophet the writer Prophet you know and all back down there and and to show you how that he went he he wrote a scroll and said that the the unidentifiable flying objects was aliens or something like that and something was said I forgot which way now if I do that wrong you put it in the right one but then he may just made a statement and when brother Brown said it was investigating angels he wrote a correction it was writing thus saith the Lord but when the prophet told it to be investigating Angels he wrote a correction and said corrected and then scroll throwing show and so and so it's investigating angels all right and uh my point is is he got his he's got his understanding open right all right and Oral Roberts University they can read all that wrote around said just like you read all that brother Brian said amen see we're in the day when the manifestation of all things nothing could be hit anymore God decide to run for president we don't even know his name I didn't know Obama's name I didn't know he existed as far as I was concerned I didn't even know how he lived in Hawaii it didn't matter to me and I never knew it but all at once here's Obama all right okay and before he went two weeks trying to run for president they'd already lambasting him about it he couldn't run because he wasn't an American citizen this is the day when you can't hide nothing no that's right amen because Bud didn't find you all right right they can go on the internet today and find out everything in the world about you all they need is your telephone number your telephone number today is more valuable to you to prove who you are than your birth certificate because they know who you are do you know if you ever applied for a birth certificate a copy or whatever try to relying it up do you know that a record from a baptismal service in a church is more authentic than a birth certificate did you know that they'll take it quicker because somebody says that's you when you can falsify all the others this isn't the day when they can just open it up and just get anything they want to that's right because it's a day of manifestation it's the day of the opening turn on the radio today and listen to some Baptist preacher be preaching about the seals and the white horse rider would be in the Antichrist and and you know the Pentecostals preaching it this way and then preaching it that way I heard a man one day preaching brother ratification write down the letters preaching the statue of perfect man right it's perfect as could be fine because his understanding had been opened getting what I'm saying see our understanding at Lula Georgia has been opened right now there's a lot of difference between a revelation in an opening of our understanding that's what my point of trying to get you to say Amen the disciples had their understanding open of the scriptures acts 1 and 8 they asked Jesus what I believe it's one and eight it says in the first chapter of Acts they asked him was he going to restore the kingdom to Israel at that time yeah that's right there was only that was the point I was trying to make when it says it opened their understanding of the scriptures go right on down that tells you what they opened he opened their understanding of who he was and how he had to die and how that repentance and remission of sins would be preached in his name and and the things that would take place and how the Holy Ghost would come right right but he didn't open their understanding of everything trying to find out what he's doing all right but get my point we can have our understanding of the scriptures open and not have one dab of Revelation right amen amen all you got to do is just get brother around his message and just read it and you can preach one God to the letter right and you can show all the in morphees and the theophanes and all of the great letters about it and great sweating speeches and yep it better not be a revelation what you'll have that's right that's right amen do I like to do this to get you to thinking you know he wrote around him I gave you a quote the number one on you no sir page 31 of the release of Revelation Jesus Christ but it's Church in each book you run around and proves a point now we can read in the Bible that by our new birth we are just as righteous as God is amen the Bible says it right that's right but he says our understanding has not been opened are you reading it on the notes our understanding hasn't been opened he said that's not real to most people I want to ask you a blunt question just don't raise your hand because both the mind's going to be up do you understand that you're just as righteous as God is many times as brother Branham have said that to us listen is it a revelation that we're just as righteous as God is come on mine's enough to say no mind's up to say I don't say that it's been revealed to me fully it's been partially revealed to me it's not fully been revealed to me that I'm just as righteous as God is do I need my understanding open to the scriptures what about you amen sir I'm just illustrating that then we'll get back to the point of the message right he said it's not real to most of us it's just a good scripture that's right what if all of our understanding is that away what if all of our understanding is just the things that has been opened unto us come on because we've read come on you know they used to say you know years ago you don't hear too much now but they used to say you know beware of that God has got all the answers well I just called the phrase on it you know I said Beware of a people after all the years they've studied the message and don't have no answers at all right I mean my Lord 40 years we've been reading I have right most of you are in the 20-year bracket in 20 to 40 years you've studied this message or even more than 40. we ought to have an understanding of what Rhode Island said amen that's right but you know what it's the most illiterate bunch of people you've ever met in your life because you go talk to the people of this message and just start saying a few things about what wrote around and said where'd he saying right I don't know where to say that or not man on a phone call me he said I don't know where he said I said would you hold on just a minute and let me go turn the computer on or are you going to believe me I said call you know if I'm gonna turn the computer on I gotta take time that I'm I'm going to prove to you what I'm saying right and I said you turn your computer on and you run it down if I ain't right you call me and let me know and I'll come to your church with a big sign on my back and say that I'm a liar I said that's how much I know what brother Randall said on that topic because I quoted it to him verbatim he said I don't know where brother runs that doesn't know I said go read the book could it be that we've had our understanding open to the scriptures right because of the intellectual conceptions that we have received by so much studying I've always told you how many remembers this statement brother Dale we said God would reveal in his heart what he's got in his head and many thousands of times have you heard that statement made but I don't claim that God has revealed to me all of the scriptures but what he's revealed to me I'll stand on it right like I said there the other day you can take a man of Peace you take a drunk that says truly drunk and really seen a peak elephant you put a lie detector's test on him it'll show he's seen a peak elephant when they don't exist me something that's revealed to you nobody can take it away from you right they can't deprogram a born-again Christian they deprogram people that are not born again right because that's intellectualism that's right that's right but you see we can have our understanding of the scriptures open that we can quote for any random about every scripture and then not be one dab of Revelation that's right no see that's what people don't want you to say those things because they say that was a revelation to brother Branham hmm that was a revelation to brother Branham right but it's not a revelation to me and you just because we can read it that's right because the Bible never changed come on it always read for you to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it never said to baptize Father Son and Holy Ghost that's right right but yet we swore by and done it didn't we all right you understand what I'm saying we need a revelation more than anything amen right because a revelational change thing that's right amen that's right we can argue about quotes but when it's revealed there's no argument right amen those reveal to me I'm not going to argue we at all I'm gonna just tell you what I believe and walk off and leave you You Can Do What You Won't Do With It about it or whatever right because that's what I would expect you to do to me exactly when are we going to get gonna get we can tell people what we believe without having to pour blood around them amen now gee I don't need internet I'm holding up that's right uh 12 quotes and that's a very short amount I'm trying to be good to Richard because Joe's not here and I'm trying to hit Richard where he don't have to put so many quotes in the computer to where it goes out on the computer system out there so if anybody's ever listened to me two sermons you know I'm quoting brother Branham all the time right a lot of times it's about 98 of the whole message so you know that I'm not saying something wrong when I say quotes will kill you amen that's correct quotes will blow your head up to where that you cannot get in a building with it it's so big right but a revelation will humble you until you crawl under a 10 gallon hat and leave plenty of room right a lot of difference in Revelation and intellect but see without a revelation of what's being said we're just like the disciples right amen that's right having their understanding open right now I'll get off that in a minute so just get what I'm saying now the people on the radios the news media I mean the the uh the uh the radio Christian radio there you listen to them you know how run around says certain things and you know how people will say it and you say hey that old boy was in the field 155. you give him the place and already agreed off huh but you see it's opening of understanding right a lot of difference between Revelation that's right and understanding being open now if we don't get it in the field there's no way for us to get a revelation right no that's right amen all right so then in doing that now take that with all of the message but remember one thing it did not give them eternal life because he opened their understanding of the scripture that's right they still had to go to Pentecost to receive and turn right amen amen all right all right it is not eternal life to you and I to be able to quote brother Branham or the Bible it is only when the Holy Spirit can Quicken that unto us right and make it alive amen that's right oh we call it see right yeah we read between the lines blessings well agree with that because that's what brother Raymond said about it right but now they brought around what he said but was between the lines is it contrary to watch online no is it different from what was on the line now what was the point of used to express it he said now like Abraham and Sarah said it doesn't say that they were made Young he said but we read between the lines amen and we see that they were well stricken in a age and done past childbearing the word said right and then they were made to the basement to be able to Bear children so they must have been turned back Young he said now that's reading between the lines we are right yeah I've heard people say we read between the lines and my revelation of seventh seal is polygamy it's all right have all the wise you want um Now where's that reading that's not even in Greer's Almanac let alone the Bible or the prophets message right right or McDonald's either one if you're in Jamaica but now listen what we need is a revelation do you come to church praying for God to reveal to you something today right that ought to be our greatest desire you know not because I'm getting older but it's getting to the bases of this old world getting back looking my bad me but now we've got enough understanding right okay you following me we've got enough understanding by hearing the prophet that there's only going to be a small group of people to be saved right and if we stayed around here a thousand more years it wouldn't be one more save than what were the names written in the last book of life and foundation of the world right that's understanding isn't it right right I mean I had to understand it and I could read that first seal and I could see that brother Randall says the white horse rider is the Antichrist all right well I had enough understanding to realize that he was the prophet and I wasn't so you know if him being the prophet I'm going to take what he said about it whether I understood it or not but you know what one day the Lord revealed that to me and when he revealed it to me it was not a different wording at all of what the letter on the page said letter on the page says here stands the white horse rider your standard lamp with a boogie down there goes the White Horse Rider riding off says everybody's got to be the Antichrist right amen he said see that guy riding off see that fella riding off see that other person there you know it's revealed to me right that the Waterworks Rider with the Antichrist and is it just a quote to you or has that been revealed now come on up see brother Dale made that statement and and can and then you go quote what brother Dale said right is that a revelation or is that an understanding of the scriptures open to you right what's your revelation and we know for sure that our Revelation can't be any contrary to what the prophets was and what the Bible says amen right just get a little background say a few words but you understand because their understanding of the scriptures was open did not give them eternal life our understanding we can understand brother Brown's message to the letter and be able to quote everything he says and have a photographic memory of everything that he would say and that is not one dab of eternal life all right be wonderful but still it's not a doubt of eternal life he says why people are afraid to talk like I do because they don't know where to stand all right like a brother told me one time he said you ain't nothing but a Baptist you just put the word together but a few days later he looked at me and he said but I I know better than the food we he said because you can take the Bible in the message and turn me to Pieces right but you know what I look back and you've heard me say it many times I look back at it myself yes and you know I won't do it because this is not a tarp equal to part thing right man this is a revelation of Jesus Christ right this is the life it's not an argument quote that's right brother told me that he heard these two men talking when they got to computers and they said now we can quote with brother Dale well boy isn't that something quote with somebody my goodness folks but get the point we can have our understanding open but do we have the Revelation come on Amen right we need to apply this law of what we're talking about our way of presenting it to all of the scriptures and all of the prophet's message do we have understanding of the message by reading and studying it but we need to have it made alive to us right amen now let's apply this to the Redemption of our bodies that we live in because we have the message to show the Redemption of the Soul justification same case Matthew baptism we have the message to show us in the scriptures to show us justification for the Earth in the days of Noah sanctification and days of the Lord Jesus and and of fiery baptism to come after the millennial Reign and and all to burn off everything we have that as an understanding but can we bring the body through the scriptures and redeem it and show where it's at come on me now all this what I just got to saying was a background in other words lay it down something to the background and now let's apply this application to the understanding of the Redemption of the body right right because it's got to be revealed to somebody one day that they're fully redeemed right amen and then God can take and make it manifest that's right right but until that's revealed you say well I wonder why our body while we're here after 40 years because it hasn't been revealed amen is that sensible had it been revealed to us 40 years ago what the to what we've been studying in the adoption Romans 8 and 23. the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body it doesn't say to Redemption there is to wit to understand the Redemption of our body right is he brought a random comment I've tried to explain it to you he come to bring us the Plan of Salvation right for the Earth for the soul of man and for the body of man right well actually we just put this over here put that over there all right put that over there and we're gonna have to wait for the Redemption of our body when the world is to annihilated after the Millennium right you see that won't work that's right can it to what did we go through join in the scriptures that the prophet said page 49 I gave back to you again where you can read it that the soul is redeemed but we're waiting the Redemption of the body but he says it's growing on in other words a process is taking place now they gave you one bear from who is this Melchizedek my brother Randall said it's already started the Redemption of our bodies already started to then at the end of the message last Wednesday I made the statement and said I'll explain later but I said today God gave you the new birth the day he gave you the new birth that day he redeemed your body right the day he gave you the new birth he redeemed it amen amen that's when I'm getting older I received it when I was 10 and I'm 70. Jesus brother random says I gave it back to you future home from this part of the earth I have redeemed which is on the River Jordan where it said this in my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell right around said from this part of the earth I have redeemed his body and I've come to live in it and from that I'm going to redeem the rest right amen three and a half years in the most horrible life of the Lord Jesus that he'd ever lived yeah God said he's redeemed right there yep I'm trying to talk to you by revelation but I realized that the opening of our understanding has to come by words we use right that's right amen foreign though the New Birth the prophet said and I gave you a bunch of quote he said it's the most important thing in your life but who's seeking for the baptism well the Holy Ghost well okay when I believe and to prove it I believe this message yeah could that be you had the understanding of your your understanding open right yeah Jesus's body was redeemed right by her when God came down and United with him not that he wasn't already God that's right and he didn't need that baptism of the Holy Ghost to give him eternal life right he already had eternal life he was eternal life it was an example for you and I but you see I know what it is it's hard to get people to say when I got the new bird God's pleased to dwell in me but one of these days I believe one of these days he'd be pleased and dwell in me you ain't got corn on it that's that's blood around since dinner in the soup made over a chatter my chicken is starting to death what are you talking about you're saying God made you perfect and you're saying you need perfection when the day God leave the cloud all right where is he living amen come on he being inside of us that's right that's right he's pleased to dwell that's right yeah when are we going to start confessing that amen when are we gonna start saving saying we're just as righteous as God is by the new birth that we have inside of us that's right right unless we confess it God can't make it alive that's right amen see Jesus's body was redeemed in three and a half years before the crime after the change or the resurrection and the things took place amen the day you receive the new birth God said right there I lay claim on his body yep amen and he ain't going to get a new one nope folks that's proof that you're not going to get a new one right amen because it would have been like some of them are saying that we don't know how the Holy Ghost yet we just got an anointing oh Lord have mercy the morning they're saying that in a message man I've been at it for 40 something years where are they preaching the new birth today that's right come on a lot of you listen on the internet I think she had a word about it you don't have to raise your hand you don't have to hit but write down on a piece of paper or somebody you've heard preaching on the new birth in the past 20 years and turn it into me I would love to hear it all right because you know it's not being done oh now they're saying the new birth is just the Baptist it's just the baptism we don't have to go through just the same things about you it's just a baptism it's just believing this message no I'm still a firm old believer in justification is the work of the Holy Spirit sanctification of the work of the Holy Spirit and the baptism is the holy spirit I'm still a firmal believer in each stage there that you must live through right and saying it would be a very very rare rare rare rare rare rare rare occasion for anybody to go through it at one time right yeah and maybe I didn't put enough rice in there but what are we doing is our understanding of the scriptures open or do we have a revelation right when I said that Wednesday night I thought that the biggest portion of the people in this church are going to be standing on their feet when they get through making this statement and I only got one or two amen right I literally thought most of you would be rejoicing because you had learned the Redemption of the body and how the process has taken place and it started with our new birth I already know that brother though all right all right so I've always preached that same thing but now it's revelation my difference in it too you see we prove what we are of what we do right that's why people walking away you know going other places doing things that's their business ain't nothing to me but it's one point how can you leave the word if you say the word here and all that's ever that's left from here before they left here they said the word was here man now brother Dale you're too plain you shouldn't talk like that why how much longer we got to play around age-wise there's a lot of us in trouble but I shed a lot I'm looking at a lot of gray hairs and and some that put stuff on it to keep it looking great but that ain't gonna change the roots of it I'll be it Roots will tell what it is but you see we ain't got time right we ain't got another 40 years that's right that's right I've never made dates sometimes with Seasons you know better than that I say that we need 40 more years what little bit I understand of the message that I believe needs to be revealed to us it's going to take it take me 40 more years to preach it where we can see it I'm not a joke because I'm trying to preach to you where we can get a revelation amen amen not an intellectual conception sure we've studied the message we can say we preached one God okay we preached marriage and divorce we preach to seal all of that wonderful but if it's not revealed right that's right it's the same thing as I gave to where we took it 31 of the church a book where the Prophet said to most people this is just a good quote it we're just as righteousness God Is by being in Jesus Christ do you know that most of the quotes that I gave you were brought around and said that when you received the new birth you have everything you need for the journey do you know what Mo you know what the biggest fortunate people thinks that means that means they don't need to get nothing else because they got everything when they believed oh my they got everything one day except in Jesus Christ they believe this message spread around them didn't say that read the quotes right come on we can read them there's no need of it he said keep breaking in and pushing out the more you drink in the more you push out the more of the message you take in the more God can reveal to us amen right but people would say yeah look right around said it got everything I needed red bell preached about that statue of perfect man I don't need that I got everything when I was born again oh my good Baptist Doctrine right I said I got everything when I believed but what about it what about it we're growing on it we understand the mechanical side of the message I ain't seeing everybody around the country preaching on it because I just got through asking that question how many bricks on any bird what if you don't preach on any birth then there's one thing for certain you don't know what your new birth is because that's just the point but see we can talk about how that the new birth Rings assist we can talk how the adoption brings us this we can talk about it this brings to this and the opening the word brings to this but if it's not a revelation amen we have had our understanding opened of the scriptures we're just like the disciples because as I said the disciples still wanted to know in Acts 1 what Jesus was going to do all right that isn't come on folks I hate to talk but isn't it true around this message that people don't know what in the world's going on if California went under right now most of the people of this message would blow their brain up because they'd say they don't miss the rapture right sure when it didn't happen in 1973 in 1977 what happened to the people of the message they sent their books back to Jeffersonville they got out of the message yeah show me you look back there and remember those days when everything happened would you say brother day or what what would you do if California went under I say praise the Lord there's an earthquake number one because according to I believe what the Bible and the prophet says is going to be two major ones and one can bring the resurrection right amen but another one will open the seventh The Sixth Seal right because it opened with an earthquake and you better not put the bride over there when the seal breaks because you've got an accribulation you done messed up all the prophets said we don't go through the tribulation so you see but could that just be an opening of our understanding right a sensible reasoning out of factors a taking of things and that's what the brother told me there was a Baptist because see where the Baptist brother and I said you better leave them alone now what he's talking about is they will take the Bible and dissect it or a thought and dissect it I tell the brother read about my sister my brother-in-law was a Baptist preacher he's had four years in college and my sister was teaching a class one day and they they you know somebody gave it to her she took it or something and she went back and picked up like this town or this person or something and she studied it out and she brought it to the group and she laid it down step by step where this came from here this year this year this year this year and this year and right down you know like that and when it was finished the lady in the congregation said where in the world did you get that my brother-in-law was the Baptist preacher he said she must have got it out of Greer's Almanac um she took him home and set him down and she laid her down she said you go back and apologize she had the scriptures to the letter yep and he didn't even know it see that's a Baptist the people of this message have the quotes to the letter right I've never said nothing other than telling me I got a lot in my head it's just letter yep what's in my heart is revealed amen don't worry about that part what's in that head is running around there and it's mighty confusion how many of you ever said to me because I just know I've said it to you you say one day one time I see one God so clear it's just beautiful I can just follow it all the way down in the next few minutes later it's just like it's gone and I don't even know what in the world I'm talking about right that's right right sure could be intellectualism that's right nothing wrong with intellectualism thank you we must have it the disciples had to have their understanding opened before they could make it to Pentecost right sure all right had they not Jesus had not opened their understanding now I've read it to you and we read there that when he appeared to him they first thought he was a spirit right he tried to make it more convincing by saying come and feel me all right a spirit hath not flesh and Bone didn't get it I'm a rich if I don't let it get it he said if you've got any bread right he brought it to a natural thing that they could not question because he ate the bread and the fish right right and it didn't go floating through the wall blessing and he was in a glorified body that's right right you see could we have our understanding open come on and not have a revelation right what about it how can you deal with different see Paul said in what is it Thessalonians or Corinthians 1 he said Corinthians I think he said I show you a mystery right in Corinthians I show you a mystery we shall not all flee 1551 15 51. we shall not all fleas I'll show you a mystery yeah a mystery is something that has not been previously revealed right so Paul said this has not been previously revealed but I say unto you we shall not all sleep so everybody thought before then that they had to go to sleep or die in other words brother random come and told us many Mysteries but could it be that we just knowing by heading on it come on hang on next time how do you know the difference not a deal how do you know the difference because you can't take away what's been revealed to me that's right that's right yep that's right you can't take away what I've told you I've seen no matter what you do you can't take it away brother Al said what you need to do sometimes just let go up there to look like and let brother Dale see if he can talk you out of what you believe remember that brother this name see if he can talk you out of what you believe if I talked you out of it it's not a revelation right if you are afraid to talk to me about what you see right it is not a revelation to you that's right because I'm not as scared of the wrong or the pokes of this message that's right but that's it I'll just tell you what I believe and if you give me an opportunity I'll tell you why that I believe then you say well now right here brother Dale Prophet said so and so I said okay let's wait this minute and it'll all be put together but you see some of the things that God has spoke to me about is revealed some of the things is opening of my understanding has been open to where did I see their right and I believed it all right all right but I'm waiting for Revelation what about you right amen amen do you understand that when you receive the new birth that your body was redeemed scripture we gave now we'll use it because I'll use it later what was the last scripture we gave I said you want a scripture for the fact that your body would redeem the day you received the new birth I said what about the Bible it said what if our enrollments were those who Justified he had already glorified right amen now I'm going to make a statement strong because I've been studying about 98 of the times brother random uses that quote he is talking about a glorified body I'm excusing a theophany a celestial I say 98 somewhere close to 95 percent there's only a very few quotes that he's really dealing with the glorified human mortal body he said well why because we first need the spiritual right right we first need to plan a Redemption amen we need to know about our theosomy amen right do we have one up there or is it down here or is it at well it don't matter to me I just got one yeah to see those we Justified he's already the day you receive that new birth you glorified your body right in his presence right right one day that will catch up with it amen right you remember five eight years ago when I preached a series called matching pieces they're putting those down on the tape system to where you can get them on the Internet probably 40 sermons or more called matching pieces whenever what God's seen there is matched with it here we've got to go that's right sure why hasn't it been because it's not matching Central when we see ourselves dire as we stand here then we can go better yep but all of the talking about going there and how far it is and let's just knowledge I want a revelation folks right man I want revelation what I've got in my head drop down in my heart and be revealed to me because I welcome man come on I can walk on what God's revealed to me I can be like the old color brother was you know here in the Bible right you can't even read he said no but I've Been Told it said holy Bible on there then when I watched if God told you in that Bible to go jump through that wall he said I would jump he said to be up to God to have a whole made by the time I get there see that's the way we've got to get we got to get to the place Abraham believed God and it was imputed of doing for noxiousness take on these things do we have a revelation or intellect well 369 in the red book 369. anybody have a need the body of God is Jesus the prince of peace a wonderful Lord and wisdom by who all things were made history is I hope everything that's what they believe drawing and let me know in his voice I believe it was all in him but I believe it all here now in the ride Dory our form of God and Perfection the righteousness to survive we now I change that song Halloween just calling him Every Praise Jesus again no evil cause me call me my God everybody we place the blood of Our Lord in Jesus name thank you of Israel recreated it's always my power me who's in you can see it so Progressive Revelations he heard Jesus for three and a half years they had a great understanding and he opened their understanding of himself I love you I love it any problems what they had became alive and they saw him as the resurrection in the night begins I'm a brand new man action again brand new man do you believe it foreign by revelation pray for Revelation more than anything else you know everything for today foreign
