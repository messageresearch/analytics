TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen God bless you Saints couldn't be in the house of the Lord and we're talking about faith this morning and just to kind of get things started as we meditate on these scriptures let's read Luke chapter 18 7-9 that says and shall not get God avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him Jesus telling the parable of the unjust steward though he bear along with him I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the Earth and he spoke this Parable into certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others now you think about this the day that we're living in now that God is looking for somebody that will believe him and it's a place where that he would make this declaration that when the son of man cometh is he going to be able to find faith and you know many times we'll we'll get to a place where we'll think we're doing all right but I I I I want to encourage you to you know just step out in faith because there's many times where we fail to just really take what God Said and grab a hold to it because if you if you grab a hold of what God said something is going to happen now we can kind of see that play out in in the story of Abel here as we as we read through that when Abel came with faith with with a real revelation and God come behind his faith and Vindicated it and proved that he really believed now brother Brown would say and healing what cancer is he said we hear Jesus say when he returns would he find Faith he didn't question whether that he'd find churches or righteousness or teachers but he said would I find faith oh God such a valuable thing in preparation he said will I find somebody who will stand at my word and say every word's right now I'm not scared whether this one says so or that says so or nothing I believe in God and I'm accepting it and standing right there on it that's the thing and that was the thing in Abel's day and that's the thing in our day sometimes you know you got that story of Sarah sitting there in the tent saying that is it going is it be is it going to be possible for my body to be changed for me to have pleasure with my Lord and doubting and things so that you see in this day we can't have no doubts like that we gotta just grab a hold of everything that God said and not doubt not falter but believe that when God said it that your toothache can be healed that everything that if God promised it I believe it and that settles it and all the days of our life he said he didn't say well I find churches will I find religion but will I find faith and not even he didn't question sincerity but he questioned faith and just kind of thinking about faith and Deuteronomy 29 29 it says the secret things belong unto the Lord our God but those things which are revealed belonging to us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law now that means once God reveals it to you it's mine if God reveals it to you it's my possession so these things that are laying here in the scriptures as we read about when God opens it up to us and gives us the revelation of the thing you got a promise that you can have it let's pray before we go into the study Lord we just think so thankful to be able to gather here today Lord and to be looking able to look into the secret things and now have been made known to us we just ask your blessing upon the study this morning that you will prepare our hearts for the services today or the service today as we just have one service and I pray God that your lord just feel that Liberty Lord to help us we ask in your name so verse 4 that we've been kind of studying on and I I think we'll I think we'll make some Headway past this it's kind of taken a while to get through this story but I think it's been helpful to kind of background and you know some some are not familiar with even maybe the story of what's of the the doctrine of what serpent seed is and it's kind of helpful to give some clarity on on kind of back back up a little bit on some of these things but in verse 4 it says if I by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than came by which he obtained witness that he was righteous so so now now that faith faith is how you get righteousness because God's righteousness is applied to you in this case that that that the life of that lamb was applied to Abel God testifying of his gifts God come behind it to prove that the faith that Abel came with offering up that little lamb was the correct approach and he come behind it what with something Supernatural happened oh we gotta we got to be constantly looking for something Supernatural I don't ever cabbage down and say well now we just got a lot of knowledge and stop looking for God to do something I'm constantly looking for some God to move in my life and by it being dead yes speaketh now Brethren would say in God's provided a way of dealing with sin he said here he come pulling the little lamb the lamb knowing that death laid near him pulling back I wonder what kind of a death that was when this little fella knowed he was coming and he laid him upon the rock pulled back his head he perhaps didn't have any knives or lances then so they just took a sharp Rock and began to chop on his Little Neck did you ever hear a lamb die you hear the most pathetic cry you ever heard when you hear a lamb die anyways they beat him across his little jugular veins with this rock and the Bloods spurting out bathing his little wool God looked down and said that's it now wouldn't you this morning sitting here would like for God to have that same testimony about your faith to look at the way that you're believing and say that's it that's what I'm looking for now we read that scripture in Luke that God in this day when the son of man is supposed to be manifest today he's looking for somebody that'll have faith and it's gotten to a place so much where you can't hardly Find Faith but yet there's going to be somebody that'll still believe that'll look at God's word and a promise that's laying there in the scripture and then lay claim to it and say I don't care if people make fun of me for the way that I'm acting I don't care if people say all manner of things I don't care what false preachers say when God said it I'm I'm grabbing a hold to him if there's a promise for my healing or a promise for a new birth or a promise for a super anointing in this day a promise that you understand the Capstone Mysteries I'm grabbing a hold to it and and for God to look at that and look at somebody's Faith like that and say that's it now you read you'll find out further on as we study it through Hebrews 11 that you can't please God without faith that faith is the thing that pleases God so this morning sitting here if you want to be pleasing to God then you've got to believe and that's that's how you make God happy now brother Adam said if we keep reading this quote he said what did he speak of it spoke of some 4 000 years later when the Lamb of God was hanging on the Rock of Ages and the judgments of God of The Sinner Man was hanging there and his bloody locks dripping around his shoulder speaking Abel couldn't understand what the lamb was saying and Jesus when he died spoke in an unknown tongue my God my God why I said Thou forsaken me he was God's lamb dying on the altar the innocent for the guilty God dealing with sin in that manner nothing at all you can do it's all oh you think about how faith faith even is a gift to you that God will give you that gift of his faith simply because you accepted it there was ain't nothing you can do nothing you can work up nothing you can do within yourself all you have to do is accept it and God will give you that gift God has already did it you have to accept it and by Sovereign Grace believing it and God will vindicate your faith by giving you the baptism the Holy Ghost now now there's a pattern I think sometimes when we study out scriptures we need to look for the patterns in the scripture and there's a pattern here that where if you believe then God will vindicate your faith if you believe for the new birth and you truly believe God will come behind that Faith to give you the many birth now that's the same thing for anything that you're believing for if it's real genuine faith God is going to come behind it to prove it God will come behind the meeting this morning the service this morning if you really believe God will come with a supernatural anointing God will move on the scene with your if you really believe God will vindicate it now now all these promises in the scripture that prove that out that God will recognize Faith just like Abel he recognized Abel's faith in Matthew 17 it says truly I tell you if you've got faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move nothing will be impossible for you now that's what we're trying to uh the god the preaching of the Gospel in this day is trying to raise our faith to up to the point where we don't believe that we're not like Sarah sitting in the tent saying well I I don't know if God can change my body but to believe that all things are possible now it seems sometimes that that's beyond our ability to accept that anything anything is possible if you can believe it if you can grab a hold to it with faith all things are possible now you think about what Jesus was saying here in Mark 11 where he said therefore I tell you whatever you ask for in prayer whatever you ask for in prayer now that's a big statement whatever you ask for in prayer believe that you have received it and it will be yours so if you come with faith and prayer and lay God's promises before him with your requests believing something's going to happen now there's when faith gets to moving and Hebrews 11 verse 6 he said without faith we're getting to that in our study of Hebrews 11 without faith it is impossible to please God because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and what that he rewards those who earnestly seek him so in other words if you bring your faith expect to get something back don't just bring your faith and say well it's good enough that I know a lot of things but expect to see God move on the scene in James chapter 1 6 7 but when you ask you must believe and not doubt because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea blown and tossed by the wind that person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord but now if you come with faith you expect to receive you come with your faith believing that you're going to get what you asked for and first John 5 14-15 this is the confidence we have in approaching God that if we ask anything according to his will he hears Us Now isn't that a confidence that when you come in prayer if you need something we don't have a god like like the Buddhas or the James or whatever all these other religions of the world believe that it's just an impartial God that's not involved with you with your activities but we have a God that hears what you have need of and is concerned about you and if we know that he hears us whatever we ask we know that we have what we ask of him now there's faith faith believes that it doesn't matter what it is how big the mountain is what faith brother Brown said it's like big and Burly and it says it tells the devil get off of my property this is mine and I'm coming for it and uh maybe maybe this speaks bullish like sister milk out there the baptismal pool last Sunday saying I ain't taking the devil uh messing with my brother anymore I'm standing on God's promises I'm laying claimed what God promised now there's when you see Faith stepping out something begins to move in Matthew chapter 23 uh Jesus said woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for ye pay tithe the mint and Ennis and cumin and have omitted the radio matters of the law what's what is the weightier matters of the law that they were not teaching the spare season scribes he said judgment mercy and Faith to think that it would be Faith would be removed from the teaching of the day that Faith because what is faith faith is when you're believing to expect that God will give you something that God will give you the holy ghost that God will reward your faith that God will give you peace in your family that God will give you your children that whatever you have need of that God will reward your faith with something Supernatural happening these are you they have done and not to leave the other undone and Matthew chapter 19 see this is what they were leaving out in that day with their teaching they were forgetting that With God all things are possible all things means all thing anything is possible now this is what as we're setting the stage of able bringing in his little sacrifice brother Ryan said in message presuming he said what was the difference said Moab up on the mountain with seven altars and seven Rams and Israel down in the valley with seven altars and seven Rams both of them keeping the Commandments of God both of them trying to do it but God Vindicated Israel in other words there's some one one of the two sides really believed because God's Gonna vindicate your faith one really had a correct understanding a real Revelation that God was in their midst that God was with him how did Cain when he made an altar just as pretty or prettier than Abel's he offered fruits he give his tithes he brought his income into the house of the Lord he knelt on the altar he bowed himself he prayed he worshiped just as sincere as any man but God Vindicated Abel by consuming his sacrifice in other words God got to give indicated Abel by supernaturally confirming his life and we'll see in a minute where brother Brown proves out that when God supernaturally vindicates somebody's life and it makes the other side jealous jealousy stirs up why are they jealous because there's a supernatural Vindication in the life of a real believer and they don't like that they want they they they get all bent out of shape because they seek God's supernaturally confirming somebody and the life lived out and signs and wonders following them that believe and they and and it makes them jealous now look what brother Ram said I I know this is a little bit small so I'm just going to read it to you in Leviticus 9 24 that I I I wonder what we're what we're trying to do too is we study these things out is to learn how to study the Bible how did Brother Branham know that God consumed Abel's sacrifice because look when you study the word out you because he's the same yesterday today and forever if God does something once one way over here and you can follow that pattern through the scripture you you how did how was the door opened up in Revelation 4. if you can find out how a door is opened up a door on Pentecost how was that door opened up how did Peter open up the door to the Samaritans how how did God open up a door once he's going to open it up the same way the next time if you could find out how he Vindicated Abel's sacrifice then you can find out how your sacrifices how the how the sacrifice was Vindicated on the day of Pentecost when he when he fell on them with the Holy Ghost and Fire so we'll just kind of read through some of these scriptures where in Leviticus 9 24 it says fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the Altar and when all the people saw it they shouted for joy and fell face down Moses has come and and did everything that God required by a revelation of what God required and what did God do he come down with fire and consume the sacrifice on the altar something Supernatural happened and judges 629 when when Gideon was uh you know when fear wondering if God was really with him and he and the angel uh the latest tip of the staff on the Rock on the meat and the unleavened bread and fire consumed the sacrifice that had been offered in First Kings chapter 18 the fire of the Lord burned up the sacrifice the wood the stones and the soil this is when Elijah come and rebuilt The Altar and repair the the altars and Fire come and consume the sacrifice accepting what accepting the revelation the Revelation that they that they had come with and First Chronicles 21 David built an altar to the Lord there and sacrificed burn offerings and fellowship offerings he called on the Lord and the Lord answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering and second Chronicles chapter 7 when Solomon finished praying after he had built the built the temple and got everything prepared and laid everything out on the altar that God come with a holy fire and consume the sacrifice on the Altar and Hebrews 12 says for our God is a consuming fire in Matthew chapter 3 John the Baptist said I indeed baptize you with water under repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire why does it saying with fire because it's identifying what what the Holy Ghost will do in you with all of these scriptural things that we can read about that the Holy Ghost is the fire of God coming what to vindicate to vindicate your faith that's what it means where it says God testifying of his gifts in verse 4 of Hebrews 11 verse 4. brother Raymond said gifts must be confirmed anyone can say anything they wish to now now we know people people have said all kinds of people have said they have discernment they've said they had the Holy Ghost they said they're called to preach all these sorts of things but it's got to be proved out right anyone can say anything they wish to and they can have impressions but when God really sins something people vindicate that to be the truth God will speak of it oh you you think now when the God sends the Holy Ghost had fire in your life then he begins to speak back to testify that you really got it that the life is in you now see when when Gabe Abel coming he brought that he brought that uh he brought his sacrifice and laid it up there on the altar then see he was waiting for God to speak back when God speaks back it proves that Faith really is there the Bible said in Hebrews God testifying of his gifts Hebrews 11 10 is that right God testifying then you got God's testimony the holy spirit is the gift of God you believe it when he comes to you he will testify that is there all God's gifts testify and the angel of God he said now if I make these statements and then and I just make them myself there's nothing of that to happen then don't believe it because my words would be untrue but if I make those statements and God backs that up then that's God's testimony to it is that right that's God's testimony saying that it is true well then if God says it's true and confirming the word with signs and wonders following isn't that what you prayed for for years oh you to think about that we're not just following the ideas of a man we're following a Vindicated message where somebody didn't get up and just say some words but God come behind it and Vindicated it and not only the message but he'll come behind your life and vindicate it he'll come behind your faith and vindicate your faith that it's true that you really believe what what with a supernatural testimony God speaking back over your life to prove that God is with you in Revelation chapter four brother Randall said now to you my Baptist brother I want to ask you something you say what more could Abraham do but believe God and God imputed him for righteousness that's only you thing you can do is believe but God's got to answer back that it's that it really is faith no don't we want our faith inspected this morning God's respect and God God will come by and and inspect it and look it over and see if it's really his faith and real and then come and vindicate it and prove it with something Supernatural happen in your life that's all he could do right there right here he believed God but God to accept his belief given the Seal of circumcision and sealed him showing that God had accepted his faith and you if you profess faith in God and has never been sealed by the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4 30 says if you want to put it down grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed and you're not sealed until you have received the Holy Ghost oh when God comes and accepts your faith and begins to change the directory of her life and makes you want to come to church and make you want want for the preacher the preacher a little bit longer because there's something hungering in you and the only way that you can explain that is something Supernatural happened in my life that you started off believing and God come and did something super nice to me make you act different and think different and walk different and talk different and want to associate with different people and live around different people and everything's different because something Supernatural happened brother I'm saying I got all these quotes without without the what message it came from so you just have to you can ask me later if you want the the message she said you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ accept him as your personal Savior and then receive the Holy Ghost and until you have received the Holy Ghost God has never recognized your faith that's right now you are a Believer but God doesn't recognize your faith until he proves it to you amen it might be recognized in your own thoughts but when he comes when it comes into God's thoughts God seals that Faith by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's the same thing it is when God recognizes your faith and he cuts the world off of you and give you the Holy Ghost and you really believe God then for whatever he says now now maybe some of the old-timers sitting here will maybe your cab is down and say well he's talking about the old the Holy Ghost and maybe I I just don't let's go on beyond that and think think in larger terms for God to come and vindicate your faith by taking you out of this world you got to have fracturing faith for God to come and vindicate your life with a supernatural anointing you've got to have Capstone Faith see it builds up the re the way we're going to get out of here is the same way we got born again the way that you get the Holy Ghost is with your faith the way that you get the Capstone is with your faith and how does faith come by the word so to raise your faith you've got to hear the word and the more word that you pack in the more word that you're believing your faith increases to a place where you can believe that all things are possible it doesn't matter what the circumstances say it doesn't matter what I appear would it matter how I feel that I believe that if God said it it's going to come to pass I don't believe how I feel I believe what God's saying okay we got two more minutes or I'll say two more we got a few more minutes but we'll close in two minutes and brother Brown said and I wear a story he said now look what Cain done when he's seen his brother was accepted his brother had what not just a lot of head knowledge not just a lot of Education his brother had the supernatural revelation now that's what we're here for we're here for something Supernatural to happen that's what I'm looking for a supernatural change in my life Supernatural change in my thinking I'm looking for something Supernatural don't never get away from expecting a supernatural move of God and then it when Cain saw that then he was jealous over him and saw a way to kill him to think about that that when God would come down and supernaturally vindicate now you can see that in a lot of people's lives God will come down and supernaturally feel somebody with a Holy Ghost and all his friends will start to hate him supernaturally vindicate a preacher and all the other preachers will start to hate him Supernatural vindicates somebody's life and the people at work will start to hate him Supernatural Vindication is what caused Cain to start hating Abel and brother or whether dictionary definition of Supernatural as a musicians come Supernatural is when a manifestation or event attributed to some Force Beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature you can't explain it by science you can't explain it by schooling you can't explain it by somebody giving you a good reason there's something when you're healed or cancer or sealed of the way that you think something's changed God's come on the scene God bless you [Applause]
