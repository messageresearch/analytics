[44:55] name that he would be here in our our

[45:25] we're not here to play games but we're
[45:27] here just to gather around the table and
[45:29] hear what God has for us and uh I
[45:32] believe that the Lord has something uh
[45:35] in store for them that are looking for
[45:37] it so uh we just want to go to the Lord
[45:39] in a word of prayer before we read the
[45:41] scripture we want to invite the author
[45:43] of the word to come uh we know that the
[45:46] prophet taught us he said that any man
[45:48] can read words on a page but it takes
[45:50] the Lord uh to anoint that word and to
[45:53] make it live so uh we want the Lord to
[45:55] do that this morning so let's just bow
[45:57] our heads together Lord we come before
[45:59] your great throne of grace and mercy and
[46:01] Lord we're so honored to be in your
[46:04] house one more time Lord on this side of
[46:06] Eternity and what a blessing it is Lord
[46:08] to gather around Believers of like
[46:10] Precious Faith Lord but Lord people that
[46:13] believe this word with all of their
[46:14] hearts Lord we're not here A bunch of
[46:16] unbelievers but we're here your redeemed
[46:18] Sons and Daughters of God and Lord we
[46:21] just come to you this morning and we
[46:23] welcome you and we feel your presence
[46:25] Lord moving in our midst all already
[46:27] Lord as the songs of Zion have been sung
[46:29] We believe it's created an atmosphere
[46:32] where your presence can be welcome to be
[46:34] here and we pray Lord that you would be
[46:36] the center focal point in this service
[46:38] today Lord may you not be in a corner
[46:41] Lord unrecognized with dirty and
[46:43] unwashed feet but Lord may may you be
[46:46] the Center focus of this meeting here
[46:48] today Lord we give you the control we
[46:51] give you the prance Lord we give you
[46:53] this whole service today Lord we pray
[46:55] that you would speak to our hearts and
[46:57] our lives Lord and and give us the
[46:59] things that we have need of Lord as the
[47:01] Bible would read and tell us to to
[47:03] search our hearts Lord and try us and
[47:06] see if there's any evil way in us and
[47:08] Lord if you find anything take it out
[47:11] Lord I pray that you'd anoint me Lord to
[47:13] to just get out of your way father I
[47:15] have no gift but to surrender to you and
[47:18] Lord it would be one thing for me to be
[47:19] an anointed gospel preacher but I pray
[47:22] that you'd anoint your children here
[47:24] this morning Lord that they would be
[47:25] able to hear the word Lord and receive
[47:28] the word and become the word as they
[47:30] receive it Lord we'll be sure to give
[47:32] you all the glory and all the honor and
[47:34] all the praise it's in the Wonderful
[47:36] Name of Jesus Christ we pray Lord bless
[47:39] us now we ask you amen and amen if you
[47:43] have your Bibles we'll uh go straight
[47:45] into the word of God and uh we want to
[47:47] read in the Book of
[47:49] Revelation the 10th chapter very
[47:51] familiar scripture to us Revelation 10
[47:55] And1 and we'll also read in the book
[47:56] Book of Mark in the seventh chapter and
[47:59] we just greet you this morning in the
[48:00] name of the Lord and bring you greetings
[48:02] from our pastor brother Josh Bennett and
[48:04] the Saints back home and uh the
[48:06] different Ministry Brother Richard
[48:07] Douglas and uh brother Tim cross wanted
[48:09] to be sure and greet your folks here so
[48:11] we want to do that for them and uh we're
[48:13] just looking forward to what God has in
[48:15] store for us and uh we're just at home
[48:18] amen not not strangers we're all the
[48:20] children of God so uh we don't have a
[48:23] new message to bring don't have a new
[48:24] sermon to bring but uh we're just here
[48:26] to put our shoulder to the will and uh
[48:29] to help you along the way and that's
[48:30] what we want to do and uh I believe that
[48:33] uh the message of the hour has an effect
[48:36] in the heart of the bride and so we just
[48:38] want to do that so let's just read here
[48:41] uh in Revelation 10 and one the Bible
[48:44] says here and I saw a mighty a another
[48:46] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[48:49] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[48:51] upon his head and his face was as it
[48:54] were the Sun and his feet as pillars of
[48:57] fire now we know that uh the prophet
[49:00] would tell us very plainly that only
[49:01] Christ that could have been it was a
[49:03] mighty angel that come out of heaven and
[49:05] he was clothed with a cloud only Christ
[49:08] that could have been and and he had in
[49:10] his hand a little book open and he set
[49:12] his right foot upon the sea and his left
[49:15] foot on the earth and cried with a loud
[49:17] voice as when a lion Roth and when he
[49:19] had cried seven Thunders uttered their
[49:21] voices and when the seven Thunders had
[49:23] uted their voices I was about to write
[49:25] and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying
[49:27] unto me seill up those things which the
[49:29] seven Thunders uttered and write them
[49:31] not the angel which I saw stand upon the
[49:34] sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[49:36] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[49:38] liveth forever and ever who created
[49:41] heaven and the things that therein are
[49:43] and the earth and the things that
[49:44] therein are and the Sea and the things
[49:46] which are therein that there should be
[49:48] time no longer but in the days of the
[49:51] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[49:52] begin to sound amen the mystery of God
[49:55] should be finished as Heath declared to
[49:58] his servants the prophets amen now we
[50:00] all see and we all know who that seventh
[50:03] verse is speaking of but I want to draw
[50:05] your attention here uh in the eth verse
[50:08] and the ninth verse and the and the
[50:10] voice which I heard from Heaven spake
[50:12] unto me again and said go and take the
[50:15] little book which is open in the hand of
[50:17] the Angel which standeth upon the sea
[50:20] and upon the earth now we know the
[50:21] prophet taught us that John was a type
[50:23] of the bride and so when John is coming
[50:26] unto this Mighty Angel and he's taking
[50:28] that book it it is our type it is our
[50:31] type as the Church of the Living God
[50:33] that we are taking that book and eating
[50:35] it the voice which I heard from Heaven
[50:37] spake unto me again and said go and take
[50:39] the little book which is open in the
[50:41] hand of the Angel which standeth upon
[50:43] the sea and upon the Earth and I went
[50:44] unto the angel and said unto him give me
[50:47] the little book I like an attitude like
[50:49] that don't you give me the little book
[50:52] amen he told him to do it and he said
[50:54] then give it to me amen that's our
[50:56] attitude come to God God you got
[50:57] something for me give it to me you got a
[51:00] blessing for me then give it to
[51:02] me give me the little book and he said
[51:05] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[51:07] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[51:09] be in thy mouth sweet as honey and he
[51:11] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[51:13] before many peoples and Nations and
[51:16] tongues and Kings let's read also if you
[51:18] will in The Book of Mark the seventh
[51:20] chapter and we'll read the sixth verse
[51:22] down to the 9th Jesus speaking here to
[51:25] the pH uh pH es he gives a very strong
[51:28] rebuke unto them and he says he answered
[51:32] said unto them well hath Isaiah
[51:34] prophesied of you
[51:36] Hypocrites amen could you imagine
[51:38] somebody talking to you like that
[51:40] Hypocrites as it is written there people
[51:42] they honth me with their lips but their
[51:45] heart is far from me amen you could
[51:49] preach about church members there for a
[51:50] long time amen they worship good and
[51:53] they they do this good but their heart
[51:55] is far from
[51:57] how be it in vain do they worship me
[52:00] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[52:01] of men notice what Jesus is saying
[52:04] they're teaching for Doctrine not the
[52:06] word of God but they're teaching for
[52:08] Doctrine the Commandment of man for
[52:11] laying aside the Commandment of God in
[52:13] other words laying aside the word of God
[52:16] ye hold onto tradition of man as the
[52:18] washing of pots and cups and many other
[52:21] like things you do and he said unto them
[52:24] full well you reject the Commandment of
[52:26] God that you may keep your own tradition
[52:30] amen we just ask that God would help us
[52:31] and bless the reading of his word as you
[52:33] can be seated and I want to speak to you
[52:35] on the subject of restored and balanced
[52:38] amen restored and balanced how many
[52:41] wants to be a balanced church amen not
[52:43] not here leaning to the left or leaning
[52:45] to the right but we want to be balanced
[52:48] Amen in everything that we say and do we
[52:50] we want our song service to be balanced
[52:53] we want our worship to be balanced we
[52:55] want uh uh the word to be preached in a
[52:58] balanced manner we don't want to be to
[52:59] the left or to the right and and brother
[53:01] Brandon would tell us he said amen that
[53:04] where we're on a oneway street and and
[53:07] you always want to be in the middle of
[53:09] that road you don't want to be to the
[53:10] left and you don't want to be to the
[53:11] right you want to be in the middle and
[53:13] and you remember when the uh the man
[53:15] came to brother Bram said well brother
[53:16] Bram if you're in the middle of the road
[53:18] you're going to get hit and he said no
[53:19] you're not going to get here in the
[53:21] middle of this road because this is a
[53:23] one-way road that we're on and we want
[53:25] to be in the middle of it and you see
[53:27] what the devil wants to do is he wants
[53:30] to push us to the left or push us to the
[53:32] right see what the prophet said he said
[53:34] what the devil will try to do to you and
[53:36] I is that if he can't keep you from
[53:39] believing something he'll push you
[53:41] overboard with what you believe and
[53:44] that's exactly how the devil is going to
[53:45] come against you if he can't make you
[53:47] not believe it then he's going to make
[53:50] you try to get so legalistic and so
[53:53] fanatical over one thing that instead of
[53:55] seeing the whole picture you're just
[53:58] seeing a little small part of it and see
[54:00] amen the prophet taught us that we're to
[54:02] realize the Antichrist Spirit that's
[54:05] working in the framework of the church
[54:07] and then resist that see amen you've got
[54:10] to resist the devil wanting to push you
[54:13] overboard with this or say well this is
[54:15] not important or this is very important
[54:18] amen see God sent us a message to
[54:20] balance us out he sent us a message to
[54:24] restore us and make us a Balan Church
[54:26] and I want to to to to just lay a little
[54:29] foundation in this because we see Jesus
[54:31] here speaking to the Pharisees and he's
[54:33] rebuking them and says you lay aside the
[54:36] word of God and you hold to your
[54:38] tradition of man in other words he's
[54:41] rebuking them because they're making
[54:43] their Traditions more important than the
[54:45] word of God Amen they they they come to
[54:48] Jesus and say well we was pots and we
[54:51] wash pans and before you eat it or
[54:53] before you eat out of this vessel you
[54:55] got to wash and you got to do this and
[54:57] then they get behind their pull pit and
[54:59] preach it and say this is what God wants
[55:00] you to do and this is how God wants his
[55:03] church to be ran and this is how God
[55:05] wants it to be and see Jesus is rebuking
[55:08] them because he says you're you're
[55:10] teaching Doctrine the Commandment of man
[55:13] what you're telling the church to do is
[55:15] not in the scripture what you're telling
[55:17] the children of Israel to do is not in
[55:19] the Bible and Jesus is rebuking them
[55:22] because they're telling the church there
[55:24] so called that it needs to be done this
[55:27] way and you need to conduct it this way
[55:29] and Jesus gives them a very sharp rebuke
[55:31] and says you're a bunch of Hypocrites
[55:34] because you're teaching the doctrine of
[55:36] man as the Commandment of God but it's
[55:39] not right and see amen what Jesus is
[55:42] rebuking as he's telling them that
[55:44] you're putting your your amen your
[55:46] routine or your tradition you're putting
[55:48] it way up here and you're putting God's
[55:51] word here and see that's out of balance
[55:54] brother sister you can have a tradition
[55:56] you can do things the way you want to do
[55:58] it but whenever that contradicts the
[56:01] word of God you better get the tradition
[56:04] out of here because it's going to make
[56:06] the word of God of non effect and that's
[56:09] exactly what Jesus said he said through
[56:11] your Traditions you make the word of God
[56:14] a n effect because you're you're putting
[56:17] your Traditions up here and the word of
[56:20] God is down here and it's lost as effect
[56:23] because you said this is more important
[56:25] than what God's word says is more
[56:27] important amen but may I put my voice
[56:30] with the prophet and say your Traditions
[56:32] they are not more important than the
[56:34] word of God and how you think you ought
[56:37] to do things it is not more important
[56:40] than what God's well you say well well
[56:41] we've been doing it this way for 15
[56:43] years that don't matter if you've been
[56:44] doing it for 80 years if it contradicts
[56:47] God's word and it don't line up with the
[56:50] word of God you ought to repent and say
[56:53] God I'm throwing away Traditions I'm
[56:56] away what I think about it preacher I
[56:58] tell you what I think I got a better
[57:00] idea than God well I'm glad you're not
[57:02] God Amen listen you don't got a better
[57:04] idea than what God has you don't have a
[57:07] better method than what God has you say
[57:09] well well how does the church need to be
[57:11] ran it is in this Bible well how do we
[57:14] need to preach it is in this Bible
[57:17] what's the position of deacons it is in
[57:20] this
[57:21] Bible and see that's what the Prophet
[57:23] come to point us back to because the
[57:25] church they had Traditions am mean you
[57:27] think about it for a moment because amen
[57:29] our prophet he went into amongst the
[57:31] Pentecostal ranks the Methodist ranks
[57:33] Presbyterian ranks and he's preaching to
[57:36] exactly what Jesus is preaching to a
[57:39] bunch of Pharisees and say well you got
[57:41] to say a man just right you have to do
[57:43] this just right and Jesus has given them
[57:46] the same rebuke or the prophet's giv
[57:49] them the same revie that Jesus is
[57:51] because they're holding on to traditions
[57:54] and saying well this is the way we do it
[57:57] amen you realize sometimes you just got
[57:58] to rub that fur on the cat the wrong way
[58:01] a little bit amen I say God if I'm
[58:03] living wrong I want you to make me
[58:05] uncomfortable if I'm not doing right I
[58:08] want you to make me uncomfortable amen
[58:10] listen I'm not here to be comfortable as
[58:12] we were preaching yesterday amen we're
[58:14] here to be a character filled
[58:17] people that's exactly right we know amen
[58:20] it was the message of the hour that put
[58:22] the church back in order it's exactly
[58:24] right amen the first seal the prophet
[58:25] would tell us he said it's through them
[58:27] seven Thunders that will be revealed in
[58:29] the last days he said why are they
[58:31] revealed in order to get the bride
[58:33] together for rapturing faith not in
[58:36] order to get a a better class of people
[58:39] or to get a nicer group of people but
[58:42] the reason God sent us this message is
[58:44] to get us together for rapturing Faith
[58:47] you say well what are we gathered to
[58:49] you're not gathered to a Ministry you're
[58:51] not gathered to a man you're not
[58:53] gathered to a personality but you're
[58:55] gathered to Christ the revealed word
[58:59] listen I say away with special
[59:01] Ministries away with well anointed ones
[59:04] and lightning and thunder and magic and
[59:07] spectacular listen we ought to be
[59:09] uniting with Christ the word I don't
[59:12] want you to be like me I want you to be
[59:14] like Christ I don't want you to be like
[59:16] your pastor I want you to be like Christ
[59:19] amen and the prophet said I didn't come
[59:21] here to build an organization I didn't
[59:24] come here that you would just follow me
[59:26] and create another clan it's in the end
[59:28] of the church age book and the resume of
[59:30] the ages he's clear on it and the very
[59:33] end of your church age book he said I
[59:35] come here for one thing and that's to
[59:37] see a true established relationship
[59:41] between Christ and the bride amen
[59:44] between man and between God see that's
[59:47] the purpose of this message is to
[59:49] balance us out and to restore us and
[59:52] give the relationship
[59:55] right amen amen we're not here for
[59:57] religion we're here for relationship say
[1:00:00] we we've had religion for hundreds of
[1:00:02] years and it ain't done nothing no good
[1:00:04] amen I don't want religion I want
[1:00:06] relationship with the God of this Bible
[1:00:09] hey I've seen what religion produces it
[1:00:12] produces a Christian on Sunday amen and
[1:00:14] a good for nothing nobody on Monday
[1:00:16] that's exactly the truth amen I don't
[1:00:18] know about you all but I'm not
[1:00:20] interested in a religion like that I
[1:00:23] want a religion that gives me a
[1:00:25] relationship with the god of the
[1:00:28] Bible that's exactly right amen and
[1:00:30] that's what this message came to do is
[1:00:32] to establish a true relationship between
[1:00:35] man and between God we know very clearly
[1:00:38] it was under the opening of the word
[1:00:40] that would actually wake the bride up
[1:00:42] and it would restore us and it would put
[1:00:44] us in balance in the third seal you're
[1:00:46] all very well taught but the prophet
[1:00:47] said the bride has not had a Revival yet
[1:00:50] now this is in
[1:00:51] 1963 and you say but preacher there's
[1:00:53] been shoutings and there's been
[1:00:55] movements and there has been amen all
[1:00:57] the charismatic and healing campaigns
[1:01:00] and all of this and yet William brandom
[1:01:02] is saying here in
[1:01:03] 1963 that the bride has not had a
[1:01:06] Revival yet he said there's been no
[1:01:08] Revival there has been no manifestation
[1:01:11] of God to stir the bride and he says but
[1:01:13] we're looking for it and it will take
[1:01:15] them seven unknown Thunders back there
[1:01:18] to wake her up it'll take the seven
[1:01:21] unknown Thunders to wake her up he said
[1:01:23] he promised it he'll send it now what
[1:01:26] amen and that's exactly the truth
[1:01:28] there's been nothing to Waker as of yet
[1:01:31] amen you'll find in the church age book
[1:01:32] The Prophet says now this messenger of
[1:01:34] Malachi 4 in Revelation 10:7 is going to
[1:01:37] do two
[1:01:38] things one according to Malachi 4 he'll
[1:01:41] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:01:43] fathers and two he'll reveal the
[1:01:45] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:01:47] Revelation 10 which are the revelations
[1:01:50] contain in the Seven Seals it'll be
[1:01:53] divinely revealed now the prophet shown
[1:01:56] you something here because under amen
[1:01:58] before the opening of the word there has
[1:02:00] not been a Revival for the bride he says
[1:02:04] there's been nothing to wake her up as
[1:02:06] of yet now he's telling you something
[1:02:08] very clearly here he said to get you to
[1:02:11] wake up it will take the revelation of
[1:02:14] the word of God Amen to put a bride in
[1:02:17] Revival it will take the opening of them
[1:02:20] Seven Seals it'll take the opening of
[1:02:22] the word amen and I'm here to announce
[1:02:24] to you this morning amen we're not
[1:02:26] waiting for the revelation of the word
[1:02:28] to come but the revelation of the
[1:02:30] message of the hour has come and listen
[1:02:33] friends amen the seals are aome the
[1:02:36] revelations have been revealed and all
[1:02:38] you say well where is the bride's
[1:02:40] Revival you are looking at it this is
[1:02:43] the bride's Revival he said but where's
[1:02:46] the shouting and where's the music amen
[1:02:48] this ain't a Pentecostal Revival it is
[1:02:51] Revival within the soul of man and our
[1:02:54] hearts have been turned back to the
[1:02:56] faith of the apostolic father if you're
[1:02:58] looking for music and and all of the
[1:03:01] Pentecostal movement you come to the
[1:03:02] wrong church amen see the brid's Revival
[1:03:05] is not an emotional workup see where
[1:03:08] emotional workups start they'll go
[1:03:10] down y'all know it's the truth amen you
[1:03:13] get a church work up with the music that
[1:03:15] ain't always going to be there but if
[1:03:17] you get her work amen if you get her
[1:03:19] Focus put on the word of God I'm telling
[1:03:22] you right now brother and sister
[1:03:23] there'll be a Revival in that person
[1:03:26] heart all they got to do is read one
[1:03:28] quote and it it sends them off into
[1:03:31] another Jubilee because the Revival is
[1:03:34] not based on the church it's not based
[1:03:36] on the piano but it's based upon the
[1:03:39] revelation of the word of God listen I
[1:03:42] don't need a piano to shout I don't need
[1:03:45] a music to shout I see my name amen
[1:03:48] written upon the L's Book of Life
[1:03:51] underneath the revelation of this
[1:03:53] message amen I tell you what friends
[1:03:55] we're not a bunch of Pentecostals that
[1:03:57] are just worked up and emotionally
[1:03:59] worked up we're worked up but not
[1:04:01] because of Music we're worked up because
[1:04:03] of the
[1:04:06] word that's exactly the truth amen I
[1:04:09] think it's amazing God sent us a prophet
[1:04:11] to put the church back in order you
[1:04:12] believe that amen God sent us a word
[1:04:15] Prophet I ain't talking about a reformer
[1:04:17] this ain't a Reformation message it's a
[1:04:20] restoration message God did not come to
[1:04:22] reform a church he came to restore a
[1:04:25] church back to everything that was lost
[1:04:28] in the Garden of Eden this is a
[1:04:30] restoration message now either we
[1:04:32] believe this or we don't believe it and
[1:04:34] I believe I'm talking to Believers amen
[1:04:36] underneath the opening of the word it
[1:04:38] would come back the amen the order of
[1:04:40] all things amen the prophet taught
[1:04:43] conduct order and Doctrine did he not
[1:04:45] amen all of these things are set in
[1:04:47] order where they need to be it's amazing
[1:04:50] because brother R would begin to place
[1:04:52] things back in order and you find people
[1:04:54] that they start fighting against the
[1:04:56] move of God and say well if there's a
[1:04:58] move of God that breaks out in the
[1:04:59] church y'all get too Pentecostal if you
[1:05:02] if you get that way or if y'all if y'all
[1:05:04] shout too loud then then I'm afraid
[1:05:06] there's going to be too much emotion or
[1:05:08] there'll be too much of this and you see
[1:05:10] it's amazing to me because William
[1:05:13] bradam never took the shout out of the
[1:05:15] church but then men raise up and say
[1:05:17] well well we don't need to worship God
[1:05:19] and we don't need to we don't need to
[1:05:21] shout Praises To God and we don't need
[1:05:23] to do this you find men take that out of
[1:05:26] the church but William brandom never
[1:05:28] took it out of the church brother sister
[1:05:30] and then you find it on the other one
[1:05:32] we're preaching about restore and
[1:05:33] balance you find people on the other
[1:05:36] side they say well if the church don't
[1:05:37] shout then it means they're dead and you
[1:05:40] find a brother you find that wrong on
[1:05:42] this side and wrong on this side you
[1:05:45] find one man wants to make everybody
[1:05:47] emotional and then one man wants to make
[1:05:49] everybody dead I say listen if you're a
[1:05:51] worshiper you got Liberty in the house
[1:05:54] of God if you want to shout you can
[1:05:57] shout if you want to say you can say you
[1:06:00] don't got to do it but just be who you
[1:06:02] are it's in you brother and sister amen
[1:06:05] just let it out of who you are amen see
[1:06:08] what the devil wants to do well well we
[1:06:10] need to there might be a Revival
[1:06:12] breakout or somebody really gets loose
[1:06:15] hey we ought to be the most freest
[1:06:16] people on the face of the
[1:06:20] Earth am I think it's a shame amen when
[1:06:23] Church comes like a place you got to be
[1:06:25] uncom able listen this ain't an
[1:06:27] uncomfortable place we're all family
[1:06:29] listen this is the quietest place you're
[1:06:31] ever going to be at he said what do you
[1:06:33] mean what the prophet say in Hell
[1:06:35] there's going to be weeping and Welling
[1:06:37] and nashing of teeth and then in the
[1:06:40] heavens there's going to be shouting and
[1:06:42] screaming and he said when I get over
[1:06:44] there oh brother I'm going be free I'm
[1:06:47] not waiting to get in heaven to enjoy my
[1:06:50] Liberty I'm not waiting for heaven to
[1:06:53] praise my God and to give him what he
[1:06:56] deserve listen I'm not waiting for
[1:06:58] another day when I can do it right
[1:07:02] now
[1:07:04] hallelujah amen I'm not waiting for it
[1:07:06] you can do it right now see amen you
[1:07:08] find it on both sides you find getting
[1:07:11] out of balance on both Sid one says you
[1:07:13] got to shout one says don't shout I say
[1:07:16] just be who you are listen I'm not here
[1:07:19] trying to make you a big shouting church
[1:07:20] I'm here to I'm here to tell you just be
[1:07:23] who you are am me listen everybody don't
[1:07:25] got to shout and scream and do all of
[1:07:27] that to be a born again believer but I
[1:07:30] tell you one thing you do have to be a
[1:07:31] Lively
[1:07:35] Stone it's the truth you say well
[1:07:38] brother you you you you you listen to me
[1:07:40] real quick my dry worship is fine my
[1:07:44] starchiness is fine sounds like a good
[1:07:46] Methodist my starching my my routine my
[1:07:49] tract don't you disrupt me my routine is
[1:07:52] fine the way I'm doing thing it's just
[1:07:55] fine anden what are you doing you're
[1:07:57] doing exactly what the Pharisees did and
[1:07:59] you're teaching doctrines of man as the
[1:08:02] Commandment of God Amen see there in a
[1:08:05] scripture in 1 Peter 2 and5 amen know ye
[1:08:08] not that ye are dead no it didn't say
[1:08:10] that know ye not you are stagnated
[1:08:13] Stones no it didn't say that know ye not
[1:08:15] ye are Lively Stones listen God ain't
[1:08:19] looking for some dead church member God
[1:08:21] is looking for a lively church that has
[1:08:24] the power of Christ
[1:08:26] living on the inside of her and I'm
[1:08:28] telling you he's going to have
[1:08:32] it he's going to have it he also has
[1:08:35] Lively stones that build up a spiritual
[1:08:37] house and holy priesthood to offer up
[1:08:40] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[1:08:43] Amen see you you can get out of balance
[1:08:45] on either side of it you say well I'm
[1:08:47] fine the way I am my dryness and
[1:08:49] starchiness is fine well I'll tell you
[1:08:51] when it ain't fine when it contradicts
[1:08:53] God's word it is not fine
[1:08:56] you can be who you are but when it
[1:08:58] contradicts God's word I'm here to tell
[1:09:00] you you just can't be who you are amen
[1:09:03] well I think my way is right and that's
[1:09:04] exactly what the scripture said there's
[1:09:06] a way that seems right to a man but the
[1:09:09] end of it is the ways of death listen I
[1:09:12] don't want what I think is right I want
[1:09:14] what I know is right according to the
[1:09:16] revealed word of
[1:09:19] God it's exactly right amen you hear it
[1:09:22] you you you hear it on both ends of the
[1:09:24] spectrum amen people rise up and they
[1:09:26] preach against emotionalism and what do
[1:09:28] they find what do they end up doing the
[1:09:30] church ends up cooling off and cooling
[1:09:32] down and that they'll laugh and scorm by
[1:09:35] the way say look at them people over
[1:09:36] there they're so out of order and
[1:09:39] they're them Pentecostal babies and
[1:09:41] they're and they're crying and running
[1:09:42] the aisles and they're doing all that
[1:09:44] and they're out of order amen I like
[1:09:46] taking things and reasoning together
[1:09:48] with it do you I like putting it on both
[1:09:51] sides so so what I do when they say that
[1:09:53] I throw the ball in their core and say
[1:09:55] well look at them them dry starchy
[1:09:58] people they just sat there like a knot
[1:10:00] on the log amen listen you're just as
[1:10:02] out of
[1:10:04] order oh come on Church you're just as
[1:10:07] out of order if you're sitting like some
[1:10:09] dry stick amen as the church down the
[1:10:13] street amen that's hanging on the
[1:10:14] chandeliers and ripping the paint off
[1:10:16] the wall listen you say this is out of
[1:10:19] order well being a dry starching message
[1:10:21] mossback believer but it's just as out
[1:10:24] of order
[1:10:25] as the other end of it I say let's not
[1:10:28] be out of order to the left and let's
[1:10:30] not be out of order to the right but
[1:10:32] let's get in the middle of the road amen
[1:10:35] where the Prophet said the angel of the
[1:10:37] Lord is always in the middle of the
[1:10:42] road Hallelujah I hope this okay well
[1:10:47] you don't well you know I I just don't
[1:10:49] have nothing to be happy about I don't
[1:10:50] got no joy I don't have know you you
[1:10:52] give me some grace we'll turn into
[1:10:53] something a little bit deeper here in a
[1:10:55] minute but I've got to obey the Lord in
[1:10:57] this amen because some people come and
[1:10:59] say well I don't I ain't a joyful
[1:11:00] Christian I don't have joy I don't have
[1:11:02] why you smile all the time brother the
[1:11:04] Solomon you you must not have any
[1:11:06] problems now I got a lot of problems
[1:11:08] amen but see I don't let my problems
[1:11:10] take away my joy and I don't let my
[1:11:12] problems take away the victory that God
[1:11:14] has put in my soul amen see not having
[1:11:17] Joy is out of order you say I need a
[1:11:20] scripture for that I'm glad you're
[1:11:21] asking 1 Peter 1 and8 whom having not
[1:11:24] seen ye love and whom though now you see
[1:11:27] him not yet believing you rejoice with
[1:11:29] joy
[1:11:30] unspeakable you rejoice with joy
[1:11:33] unspeakable and full of glory amen you
[1:11:36] realize you can actually be a joyful
[1:11:38] Christian you realize you don't have to
[1:11:40] be negative and you don't have to be
[1:11:42] well I tell you
[1:11:43] what if I just had any good luck then
[1:11:46] maybe I would be happy if I just had
[1:11:47] something to be happy about then I would
[1:11:49] be happy amen see what the prophet said
[1:11:51] Christians are never
[1:11:53] negative they're never
[1:11:56] Negative they ain't ever negative amen
[1:11:59] listen you can have the worst sermon in
[1:12:01] the world that you hear amen and if
[1:12:03] you're a true Born Again believer that
[1:12:04] ain't full of a bunch of negativity
[1:12:06] you'll find something good to say about
[1:12:08] that person instead of something
[1:12:10] negative to say about it because you're
[1:12:13] listen I thank God I I wish that God
[1:12:15] would give us a bunch of positive
[1:12:17] Christians listen I'm not coming to here
[1:12:19] to be a negative person I'm here to be a
[1:12:22] positive person am me listen you can
[1:12:24] sing amen completely off key and can't
[1:12:27] carry a tune in the bucket and what will
[1:12:28] you say if you're a positive Christian I
[1:12:30] tell you what she sings with all her
[1:12:34] heart that's what God wants us to be I
[1:12:37] tell you what he he don't he sings with
[1:12:40] all his heart she can't play that man
[1:12:42] and Li word nothing but she she gives it
[1:12:44] everything she's got see and Jo God will
[1:12:46] judge you for your heart he'll judge you
[1:12:49] that you're trying to do something for
[1:12:51] God he I think it's amazing that mostly
[1:12:53] the critics they ain't doing nothing for
[1:12:55] God there there say I wish he'd play
[1:12:57] better why don't you come up here and

[1:13:07] critical of one another because that is
[1:13:10] out of order amen never get a critical
[1:13:13] spirit that's exactly what the prophet
[1:13:15] said amen listen we got enough critics
[1:13:18] out in the world why don't you let that
[1:13:20] stuff stay out there don't let a
[1:13:22] critical spirit come in the house of God
[1:13:24] to where you're criticizing everybody
[1:13:27] and criticizing the singers am remember
[1:13:29] when somebody starts worshiping you say
[1:13:31] that's the way to do it sister you
[1:13:33] Worship the Lord or somebody start
[1:13:36] singing you join in with them and say
[1:13:38] yes brother amen sing to the

[1:19:56] presence of God can do to a Believer am
[1:19:59] mean you just get me to Jesus and he'll
[1:20:01] burn all them things off of me listen
[1:20:03] you don't have to waste time trying to
[1:20:05] do it yourself you've got God on your
[1:20:07] side you don't have to waste time trying
[1:20:10] to to get balanced and to do this and do
[1:20:12] you've got God on your side of course
[1:20:14] you still have to do your
[1:20:16] part that's exactly right look at Jesus
[1:20:18] we know he was after the order of mzc is
[1:20:20] that right and he only did what he saw
[1:20:23] the father do exactly right in John 5:19
[1:20:25] then then answered Jesus and said unto
[1:20:27] them verily verily I say unto you the
[1:20:29] son can do nothing but what he seeth the
[1:20:32] father do for whatsoever or for what
[1:20:34] thingss soever he doeth these also doeth
[1:20:37] the son likewise we know that Jesus
[1:20:39] would walk in order according to what he
[1:20:41] saw the father do amen now how many
[1:20:43] knows that he was after the order of MDC
[1:20:46] and God would actually give Jesus
[1:20:48] visions of where to go and what to do Be
[1:20:51] not Afraid the prophet picks it up he
[1:20:53] says any Bible student knows that that's
[1:20:54] true and St John 5:19 Jesus never
[1:20:57] performed one miracle in his life
[1:20:59] without first God the Father showing him
[1:21:02] a vision to do it or he told him
[1:21:04] something wrong in the Bible for he said
[1:21:07] verily verily I say unto you the son can
[1:21:09] do nothing in himself but what he sees
[1:21:11] the father do so we know that Jesus
[1:21:14] brings order by visions is that right
[1:21:17] amen he brings order by visions and we
[1:21:19] know ultimately that God brings order
[1:21:21] and balance by the power of His word how
[1:21:24] many beles that amen when God wants to
[1:21:26] create something what to use the power
[1:21:28] of the spoken word when God wants to set
[1:21:31] things in order what to use he uses the
[1:21:33] power of the spoken word in Genesis 1 we
[1:21:36] find the very prime example in the
[1:21:38] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:21:40] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[1:21:43] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:21:46] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[1:21:48] upon the face of the water and then God
[1:21:52] said and God said let there light and
[1:21:55] there was light and God saw that the
[1:21:57] light was good so listen friends this
[1:21:59] whole earth was without form and void
[1:22:02] and it was chaos it was vanity it was a
[1:22:05] wasteland and darkness was over the face
[1:22:08] of the deep and God wanted to change it
[1:22:11] amen so you study it out you'll find in
[1:22:12] the Greek that or in the Hebrew rather
[1:22:15] that this world was completely void and
[1:22:17] it was in chaos chaos is the opposite of
[1:22:21] order right chaos is the opposite of
[1:22:24] order and so God spoke and said let
[1:22:27] there be firmament and let there be
[1:22:29] light and let there be land and let
[1:22:32] there be seed and let there be herb Let
[1:22:34] There Be tree and then let every seed
[1:22:37] bring forth of its kind and then what
[1:22:39] happened exactly what God Said to happen
[1:22:42] the earth begin to shape and begin to
[1:22:44] mold and it got in order because of what
[1:22:48] because of the word that it heard it was
[1:22:51] the word that put this Earth in order
[1:22:54] took something that was chaos and it put
[1:22:57] it in order oh church if God could set
[1:23:00] this whole globe in order what makes you
[1:23:03] say that God cannot put your life back
[1:23:06] in the order that it needs to be hey if
[1:23:08] he could remove darkness by the power of
[1:23:11] His word he can take a dark and Stony
[1:23:14] heart and can speak to it and say let
[1:23:17] there be light and let it be firm
[1:23:20] brother you won't know how you're
[1:23:21] starting to change but before you know
[1:23:23] it that malice drops off of you and that
[1:23:26] Envy drops off of you what is that
[1:23:28] you're laying in the presence of the
[1:23:32] word I say that's what we need lay in
[1:23:35] the presence of the sun amen how you
[1:23:38] going to grow if you're in the dark how
[1:23:40] you going to grow if you're in the
[1:23:41] basement amen how you going to grow if
[1:23:43] you're not in the sunlight amen see you
[1:23:46] become the word as you receive that word
[1:23:49] that's exactly the truth the spirit of
[1:23:51] God begin to move it's amazing as you
[1:23:53] study this because this whole world was
[1:23:56] completely out of order but just one
[1:23:59] word from the
[1:24:00] master it took vanity it took Wasteland
[1:24:03] it took cha just one word amen I know we
[1:24:06] get stuck in this finite mind and we
[1:24:08] think it's going to take a seven night
[1:24:10] prayer Mee and Revival to change things
[1:24:12] but I'm telling you about a God all he
[1:24:14] has to do brother sister speak one word
[1:24:16] over you all amen you realize when the
[1:24:19] maniac at gadera when they came down to
[1:24:21] Jesus and and and they cried out said
[1:24:24] why you come to torment us before our
[1:24:26] time and then yeah and then they asked
[1:24:28] Jesus said well let us go into the swine
[1:24:30] what did Jesus say a two-letter word g
[1:24:34] go he didn't pray he didn't shout he
[1:24:36] didn't scream he didn't do nothing he
[1:24:38] just stood there and used the power of
[1:24:41] His spoken word and said go amen oh
[1:24:45] church amen and what are you amen you're
[1:24:48] a messiah and the prophet said that g or
[1:24:51] that God would actually he would use
[1:24:53] Jesus to show you as an example that
[1:24:55] when he was on a 40-day fast and he was
[1:24:57] out in the wilderness he you talk about
[1:25:00] being
[1:25:00] hungry 40 days no food and no water may
[1:25:03] I had water I don't know a 40-day fast
[1:25:06] regardless of brother he was weak in his
[1:25:08] body and and the tempter AM mean you
[1:25:11] think you've been tempted when you're
[1:25:12] amen see Satan knows when to tempt you
[1:25:14] he don't tempt you when you're all fired
[1:25:16] up he tempts you when you're in a low
[1:25:18] spot that's exactly right he tempts you
[1:25:21] when you're down low and discouraged
[1:25:23] that is when the tempter came to Christ
[1:25:25] and you are fighting the same devil that
[1:25:28] Jesus fought in the mountain that's
[1:25:30] exactly right and then Jesus stood there
[1:25:33] and Satan is here said well I tell you
[1:25:35] what if you'll bow down I'll give you
[1:25:37] the whole world and the prophet said he
[1:25:39] gave Jesus a vision and showed him the
[1:25:41] kingdoms of this world and said if
[1:25:43] you'll Bow Down and Worship me I'll give
[1:25:45] you all of this Jesus didn't fight there
[1:25:48] and deny that it was not his because for
[1:25:50] a season this world belongs to Satan
[1:25:54] it's right he's the God of this evil age
[1:25:57] if you don't think he is go outside and
[1:25:58] look at the government and see who's
[1:26:00] running

[1:26:03] politics and see who's running it
[1:26:05] brother amen I'm sorry to bust youren
[1:26:07] bust your bubble amen but see the devil
[1:26:10] is the God of this evil age Republican
[1:26:13] Democratic left and right up and down he
[1:26:15] is the God of this Earth it's exactly
[1:26:18] right he said Jesus worship me and I'll
[1:26:20] give you all of this and what did Jesus
[1:26:23] do amen he got down and started to pray
[1:26:25] and started to shout and that's not what
[1:26:27] he did amen he turned to the word of God
[1:26:30] and he said Satan it is written you
[1:26:33] shall not tempt the Lord your God Amen
[1:26:37] why did Jesus turn to the word listen he
[1:26:39] could have spoke Lucifer out of
[1:26:41] existence he could have said devil go
[1:26:43] back to hell where you come from and he
[1:26:46] that would have been gone but he didn't
[1:26:47] do that but he came to the word amen to
[1:26:50] show you as the Son of God and to show
[1:26:53] you as a daughter of God all you have to
[1:26:56] do is stand there and speak the word
[1:26:59] over that devil and say devil I am more
[1:27:02] than able Amen to possess the land amen
[1:27:05] stand and remind the devil of what God
[1:27:07] Said in his word the devil says you

[1:27:11] written I am more than a conqueror
[1:27:14] through Christ that have loved me and
[1:27:16] the devil says I tell you what I'm a
[1:27:18] bring a spirit of fear on you anden
[1:27:20] devil I've got one for that I have not

[1:27:24] of love a spirit of power and a sound
[1:27:28] mind see Jesus showed you what to do
[1:27:31] when you're backed up in a corner and

[1:28:35] that because William brandham never
[1:28:36] taught it that way well brother bram's
[1:28:38] the only one that can speak things into
[1:28:40] existence and he's the only one that's
[1:28:41] got the power of the spoken word well I
[1:28:44] I I see what you're saying but he never
[1:28:45] taught it that way amen he never taught
[1:28:48] a onean Ministry but you'll find what
[1:28:50] this message is always doing is is
[1:28:53] putting it back on on you hallelujah
[1:28:56] amen it's putting it back on you you'll
[1:28:58] never find William say look what I can

[1:29:06] vine ever puts forth another
[1:29:08] Branch it'll be a continuation of the
[1:29:11] book of Acts listen William Brandon was
[1:29:14] not that only Branch brother sister but
[1:29:16] you are a
[1:29:18] continuation amen of the book of Acts
[1:29:21] because you're pulling from the same
[1:29:23] life source of the original vine you got
[1:29:27] original word you got original
[1:29:31] Power that's exactly right and the
[1:29:34] Masterpiece the prophet tells us here he
[1:29:36] said how is God making us a masterpiece
[1:29:38] how was God restoring and balancing us
[1:29:40] he says he does it by his never changing
[1:29:42] method the same way he made his first
[1:29:44] Masterpiece he uses his
[1:29:46] word you say I want to be a masterpiece
[1:29:49] listen to the
[1:29:51] word I I want to be a bride for Christ
[1:29:53] listen listen to the word I want to be
[1:29:56] that Michelangelo sculpure that that
[1:29:58] that Christ's got a vision of me and
[1:30:00] he's chiseling me amen you need to sit
[1:30:02] down and listen to your pastors what you
[1:30:04] need to
[1:30:05] do it's just the truth brother sister I
[1:30:08] mean listen the Chisel is the word and
[1:30:10] the Holy Spirit is the hammer amen it
[1:30:13] ain't just the man up here telling you
[1:30:15] what you should and shouldn't do amen
[1:30:17] you got to look past the veil and say
[1:30:19] God this is your word this is the
[1:30:22] message of the hour regardless if it's a
[1:30:24] 60y old B I'm sorry I hope you're maybe
[1:30:27] younger than that orever
[1:30:29] older he just looking at
[1:30:31] me it don't matter
[1:30:34] how it don't matter what the veil looks
[1:30:37] like see that's what the prophet said
[1:30:39] the problem was is that man gets wrapped
[1:30:41] up on the veil they said that that's
[1:30:43] just my brother up there that and that's
[1:30:45] exactly what the Pharisees did with
[1:30:47] Jesus they got caught up on the veil I
[1:30:49] said that ain't God look at him he cries
[1:30:52] he bleeds that's he ain't Divine look at
[1:30:56] him out there crying and weeping over
[1:30:57] the grave of Lazarus but I say look at
[1:30:59] him when he spoke amen I said Lazarus
[1:31:02] come forth ammen don't you get so
[1:31:04] tripped up on the veil that you miss the
[1:31:07] message don't get so wrapped up on the
[1:31:10] ve listen I want to give you a great
[1:31:11] news flash your pastor's a
[1:31:14] [Music]
[1:31:16] man sister Jun said a man he's a man old
[1:31:22] man
[1:31:24] that's the truth you get so concerned on
[1:31:26] the veil you get so concerned on the man
[1:31:30] you forget the message amen see listen
[1:31:33] you can't get I think it's amazing there
[1:31:34] in the Old Testament that God would hide
[1:31:36] behind Badger skins now I don't know if
[1:31:38] you know this but a badger is the most
[1:31:40] meanest animal there is a badger is a
[1:31:43] mean mean mean animal but that would
[1:31:45] hide the shakana glory of God Amen
[1:31:48] showing you brother it don't matter what
[1:31:50] you Veil God in brother sister amen
[1:31:52] you're veiling him in this
[1:31:55] flesh it's exactly right amen you're
[1:31:58] veiling him in this flesh but it is
[1:32:00] still God the word and the prophet said
[1:32:03] that's what God is doing he's using that
[1:32:05] word he's using that word to make us his
[1:32:08] Masterpiece so we know it would take a
[1:32:10] perfect bride to put us in perfect order
[1:32:12] how many believes that and how many
[1:32:14] believes we got a perfect word amen now
[1:32:16] listen how does God bring us his word
[1:32:18] now he uses he amen the way God brings
[1:32:21] us his word is by the prophets
[1:32:24] you say well I don't need a prophet yes
[1:32:25] you do I don't need a prophet to get
[1:32:28] God's word I got God himself but that's
[1:32:30] not God's order and that's not how God
[1:32:32] set it up well well I'll tell you what
[1:32:34] I'm not going to sit down and I'm not
[1:32:35] going to brother amen you just might be
[1:32:37] in the seat of Cain if that's your
[1:32:41] attitude because remember when God came
[1:32:43] or God came to Kane said Cain if you'll
[1:32:45] just do what your brother did he had an
[1:32:47] opportunity to get in order he had an
[1:32:49] opportunity to get in life K if you'll
[1:32:52] just do what your brother I love love
[1:32:54] you I'll receive you I'll take you to
[1:32:56] myself and then Kan said if you don't
[1:32:58] want my way and you don't want my offer
[1:33:01] and you're not getting nothing of it
[1:33:03] amen see listen folks there's some
[1:33:04] people you can preach to them till
[1:33:06] you're blew in the face and you won't
[1:33:09] ever change them you won't change what
[1:33:11] they're going to do because in their
[1:33:13] mind they have determined the way I'm
[1:33:16] doing it is the right way and the order
[1:33:18] in which I'm doing it is the right order
[1:33:21] so don't get mad at the person you've
[1:33:23] got to realize they're under a spiritual
[1:33:25] problem in their mind listen you can
[1:33:28] bring a horse to the water but you can't
[1:33:29] make them
[1:33:31] drink it's the truth it's up to them
[1:33:34] it's up to you if you want to get in
[1:33:36] order amen listen if you want to be out
[1:33:38] of order church it's because you want to
[1:33:40] be amen if you want to have your home
[1:33:42] out of order and instead of having God
[1:33:45] and the man and the wife and the
[1:33:46] children and you got the wife over the
[1:33:49] man and the man over God if you want to
[1:33:52] run your house that way it's up to you
[1:33:54] but you don't have to do it that way
[1:33:56] amen God sent us a prophet to put the
[1:33:58] home in order you said well I want God
[1:34:01] to bless my home then get back in line I
[1:34:04] want God to bless my church then get
[1:34:06] back in line you realize what the
[1:34:08] prophet said he said God could only
[1:34:10] bless the children of Israel when they
[1:34:12] was in the
[1:34:13] Homeland when they was in the Homeland
[1:34:16] he said and God will only bless you when
[1:34:18] you're in the Homeland and he said where
[1:34:21] is the Homeland it's in the message of
[1:34:23] the hour Hallelujah where is the
[1:34:27] Homeland and send the message of the
[1:34:29] hour underneath Divine leadership and
[1:34:32] divine headship and a Hess in order amen
[1:34:36] I say men be the men of your house and
[1:34:39] sisters be the pastor of the house and
[1:34:41] be the pastor of your children that's
[1:34:44] the order God sent it
[1:34:46] in come back around to this as God gives
[1:34:49] us order by His prophets you you all
[1:34:51] remember there in Exodus the 20th
[1:34:53] chapter 9 he told me to preach as long
[1:34:55] as I wanted to but I'm going to try not
[1:34:56] to but you find in actus the 20th
[1:34:59] chapter that the children of Israel came
[1:35:00] to Moses and said Moses don't speak
[1:35:02] don't don't let God speak to us it's
[1:35:04] fearful we might die paraphrasing it's
[1:35:06] fearful we might die amen and then he
[1:35:09] tells Moses and they said to the Moses
[1:35:11] speak speak now with us and we'll hear
[1:35:13] but let not God speak and you'll find
[1:35:16] that after this that that no more God
[1:35:18] would speak to the children of Israel
[1:35:20] but he would use a prophet to speak to
[1:35:22] them and then what did God tell Moses he
[1:35:25] said Moses you be God to the people and
[1:35:28] you let Aaron be your Prophet that's
[1:35:30] amazing that you find this type all the
[1:35:32] way in the book of Exodus because here
[1:35:34] was a man he says Moses you be like God
[1:35:38] and you speak and tell Aaron what to say
[1:35:41] and then Aaron will be the prophet and
[1:35:43] he'll give your message to the children
[1:35:46] of
[1:35:47] Israel and God has done the same thing
[1:35:50] this is not William Brandon's message
[1:35:52] this is not the message of a man amen
[1:35:55] but God Amen here's the roles you've got
[1:35:58] God and you've got Aaron also known as
[1:36:01] Elijah the prophet amen and God put the
[1:36:04] words in his mouth and then from him he
[1:36:08] would give it unto the
[1:36:10] church amen this is not the message of a
[1:36:13] man this is a message from God himself
[1:36:16] and God was showing us in type all the
[1:36:18] way in Exodus the 20th chapter that I'm
[1:36:21] not going to speak to you by my lips
[1:36:23] anymore more but I'm going to use the
[1:36:25] ministry of a
[1:36:27] prophet where do you get the order where
[1:36:29] do you get Raymond restoration from a
[1:36:31] prophet's message amen Amos 3:7 surely
[1:36:34] the Lord God will do nothing unless he
[1:36:36] Reveals His secret to his servants the
[1:36:38] prophet so we find very scripturally
[1:36:41] that God by His prophets brings the
[1:36:42] order back to the church and the
[1:36:45] prophets clear on it he said we've had
[1:36:47] these reformers and they were good men
[1:36:49] he said but see they still baptized in
[1:36:51] titles they still baptized in father son
[1:36:54] Holy Ghost and they Still Smoked cigars
[1:36:56] and they still died all those things he
[1:36:58] said they was anointed and they tore
[1:37:00] those things to Pieces he said but the
[1:37:02] full word of God never come to them
[1:37:05] because they were not prophets they were
[1:37:07] reformers but he said in the last days
[1:37:09] it's going to take a prophet it's going
[1:37:12] to take a prophet to take these
[1:37:13] mysteries of God and bring it back up
[1:37:16] because the Mysteries is only known by
[1:37:18] the prophets now it's amazing as you see
[1:37:21] this because God would bring order
[1:37:23] throughout the church ages and what is
[1:37:25] God doing he's laying the he's laying
[1:37:27] the
[1:37:28] pyramid he's laying in faith he's laying
[1:37:30] in knowledge he's laying in Temperance
[1:37:32] and you'll find every time God would
[1:37:34] sent forth we know that God was sent
[1:37:35] forth a major prophet in the Ephesian
[1:37:37] church or in the Ephesus Church age
[1:37:39] right amen unto the angel of the Church
[1:37:41] of Ephesus right and so on and then
[1:37:43] along in that church age God would send
[1:37:46] an anointing amen and during that time
[1:37:49] we all know you're very well taught I'm
[1:37:50] not going to to take a lot of time in
[1:37:52] these but God was send an anointing
[1:37:54] along with that message and then you'll
[1:37:56] find all the way amen here we are at the
[1:37:59] Capstone age of Brotherly kindness and
[1:38:01] the Capstone being love and then God
[1:38:03] would send us another message amen
[1:38:06] another Prophet it's amazing I know many
[1:38:08] of you know this but but youd ever take
[1:38:10] and study it out there in the Book of
[1:38:11] Revelation you'll find that for sure
[1:38:14] it's a first prophet in the first church
[1:38:15] age and the last Church
[1:38:17] age it's in the reading the prophet
[1:38:19] actually talks about it amen unto the
[1:38:21] angel of the church and then the rest of
[1:38:23] unto the angel in the church unto the
[1:38:25] angel in the church and then you'll find
[1:38:27] in Leia unto the angel of the church
[1:38:29] showing you this is not going to be a
[1:38:31] Reformation message but it's going to be
[1:38:33] a restoration message and I think it's
[1:38:36] amazing because God did not just send us
[1:38:38] the word but he sent us the spirit with
[1:38:41] the word how many believe that God did
[1:38:43] not just send us the mechanics but he
[1:38:46] sent us to
[1:38:48] dyamics and the mechanics and he said
[1:38:51] the Dynamics of this church would be
[1:38:53] what amen the refilling of the Holy
[1:38:56] Ghost amen and I want to turn a corner
[1:38:58] we'll bring it close shortly but I want
[1:38:59] to preach to you here for a moment
[1:39:01] because in every age God would send
[1:39:03] forth that anointing of a lion an
[1:39:05] anointing of an ox and you look at them
[1:39:07] them Martyrs how many's ever read that
[1:39:08] Fox's book of Martyrs and you read about
[1:39:11] them Martyrs and they was burnt to death
[1:39:13] and burnt to the steak and women they
[1:39:15] catched their hair on fire and many grew
[1:39:17] some things that they would amen kill
[1:39:19] Christians it's amazing many testimonies
[1:39:22] you can read about because there was
[1:39:24] this one man he was on a cross and they
[1:39:26] set up a fire underneath him and he just
[1:39:28] stood there tied up to a cross being
[1:39:29] burnt to death and he singing worship
[1:39:32] songs and he's singing Praise songs and
[1:39:35] then I got to think him of the way I
[1:39:36] thought my God how could a man he's
[1:39:38] being burnt to death and being tortured
[1:39:41] and if there was ever time to not have
[1:39:43] church that was a time to not have
[1:39:45] church if there was ever time to be
[1:39:47] discouraged that was a time to be
[1:39:49] discouraged but he was there on that
[1:39:51] cross and just begin to worship God and
[1:39:53] begin to praise God Amen and then it
[1:39:56] connected very clearly to me because the
[1:39:58] prophet said that the church can only do
[1:40:02] what she is Anointed to do I thought
[1:40:05] well there's the picture the reason they
[1:40:07] could stand there is because they was
[1:40:09] underneath a beast of burden and they
[1:40:12] was anointed to lay down their life for
[1:40:15] the cause of the gospel and I studied it
[1:40:18] out and I saw the man anointing amen I
[1:40:20] saw how Luther and the prophet talked
[1:40:22] about them he said he wasn't it wasn't
[1:40:24] the mystery how he could protest the
[1:40:26] Catholic church and all of that he said
[1:40:28] the mystery was how he kept his head
[1:40:30] above all that fanaticism he said to me
[1:40:33] that was a mystery and I thought well
[1:40:35] how could he do that and the pressure
[1:40:37] that he fought it's because God released
[1:40:39] an anointing upon that church so they
[1:40:43] could live out the word for their age
[1:40:46] now listen friends you're not under an
[1:40:48] ox anointing you're not under an eagle
[1:40:50] anointing but or you you are under an
[1:40:53] eagle
[1:40:54] anointing that's the anointing that God
[1:40:57] has given to you now listen amen because
[1:40:59] people say well and you hear young
[1:41:00] people say well you know I I I'd live
[1:41:02] the message but it's just too hard to
[1:41:04] live and and and I'd really sell out to
[1:41:07] God but it's just too difficult to do
[1:41:09] amen I'm here to tell you this morning
[1:41:11] God has given you the tools you need for
[1:41:13] the job and listen the church can only
[1:41:16] do what she is Anointed to do you said
[1:41:20] well preach I'll tell you what I'm
[1:41:22] anointed to be discouraged that's not
[1:41:24] right i'm anointed to be disappointed
[1:41:27] but that is not right actually you're
[1:41:29] too anointed to be disappointed that's
[1:41:31] just some good charismatic preaching but
[1:41:33] I like it am me listen you ought to be
[1:41:35] too anointed to be disappointed amen
[1:41:37] listen you're not anointed for failure
[1:41:40] you're anointed to overcome this world
[1:41:43] you're not anointed for defeat you're
[1:41:46] anointed to Amen to overcome the God of
[1:41:49] this evil land he said but I can't do it
[1:41:51] I'm not able to do it you're exactly
[1:41:54] right you can't do it amen but greater
[1:41:57] is
[1:41:58] he greater is he that is in you and he
[1:42:01] is in the I don't have the strength
[1:42:04] that's okay because my strength is made
[1:42:07] perfect in your weakness I don't know
[1:42:10] how much more I can handle amen that's
[1:42:13] okay because when your strength runs out
[1:42:15] God is a god of unlimited resource he's
[1:42:19] a god of unlimited Revival if you want
[1:42:22] out God has got some
[1:42:26] more it's the
[1:42:28] truth amen the church can only do what
[1:42:30] she's anointed for you realize you can't
[1:42:33] help but
[1:42:35] overcome how because you're anointed for
[1:42:38] it they couldn't help but give their
[1:42:40] lives for the cause of Christ and you
[1:42:43] can't help but overcome That Old
[1:42:46] Devil Glory I'm feeling good this
[1:42:48] morning you can't help but overcome
[1:42:51] every devil in hell amen young people
[1:42:54] I'm telling you you're
[1:42:56] unstoppable amen you can't help but
[1:42:58] overcome this world because God has
[1:43:01] anointed you to do
[1:43:03] it that is your order amen over well
[1:43:07] what what do I do overcome that's what
[1:43:09] you do what do I do so it's amazing
[1:43:12] because as you study that eagle
[1:43:13] anointing out you find it's one of the
[1:43:15] only anointings that he don't really
[1:43:17] have a lot of strength an eagle is not a
[1:43:20] real strong bird
[1:43:23] right amen Eagle ain't real strong you
[1:43:26] can take its wings and break it fairly
[1:43:28] easy amen because they're light and amen
[1:43:30] a got hollow bones and so on anden
[1:43:32] they're a very weak animal but see the
[1:43:34] thing about that eagle is it's not
[1:43:36] relying on its own strength it's not
[1:43:39] relying on its own ability but it knows
[1:43:42] that God sent forth a wind it knows that
[1:43:45] God sends a wind upon the face of the
[1:43:47] earth and the prophet said I was out
[1:43:49] there in the woods and I looked at that
[1:43:51] eagle he said it just took two or three
[1:43:53] flaps and it was just far as the eye can
[1:43:56] see because it learned how to do what it
[1:43:59] learned how to surrender to the power of
[1:44:02] the wind and the wind could carry him
[1:44:05] higher than where he was because he
[1:44:08] learned to surrender you said brother I
[1:44:10] want to come up higher amen the problem
[1:44:13] is not with the anointing the problem is
[1:44:15] with you the problem is not with God the
[1:44:19] problem is with you you're here trying
[1:44:21] to fly and get high and get high you are
[1:44:24] not a crow you're an eagle you got to
[1:44:27] learn to surrender to the power of the
[1:44:30] Holy Ghost I say God give us a church
[1:44:33] that will surrender to the anointing of
[1:44:36] the spirit of God you said well preacher
[1:44:38] I'm on the ground and this one's
[1:44:40] attacking me and this one's attacking me
[1:44:42] you realize what that Eagle's got to
[1:44:44] do he don't stand there and get his
[1:44:46] claws out and fight and fight and fight
[1:44:49] and fight the crows all he does is
[1:44:51] relies on that wind and that wind will
[1:44:54] take him up to a place Hallelujah that
[1:44:58] wind will take him up to a if he can
[1:45:00] just learn to surrender to it that wind
[1:45:02] will take him up to such a spot to where
[1:45:05] the crows ain't able to get up there and
[1:45:08] the vultures ain't able to get up there
[1:45:10] listen I'm telling you there's a place
[1:45:12] that you can go that the devil don't
[1:45:15] even know what to do with you I said God
[1:45:18] bring the church amen to a place where
[1:45:21] the devil don't know what to do amen
[1:45:23] bring a young person Amen to the place
[1:45:26] where the devil don't know what to do
[1:45:27] with
[1:45:28] them stop trying to fight on the Devil's
[1:45:31] Ground you go up higher than where he
[1:45:34] is it's the truth amen you've been
[1:45:37] restored you've been placed God has
[1:45:39] placed you underneath this anointing
[1:45:42] amen by the message of the hour it has
[1:45:43] balanced you out it has placed you upon
[1:45:46] a rock the revelation of who Christ is
[1:45:48] and the revelation of who the true
[1:45:50] church is
[1:45:53] it's exactly the
[1:45:55] truth praise the Lord I mean the devil
[1:45:58] don't have a lot of stronghold on that
[1:46:00] eagle let me tell you about it stop
[1:46:02] trying to fight the devil out there in
[1:46:04] the world you bring him to the house of
[1:46:07] God am I heard brother Wayne Lawson tell
[1:46:10] tell a story one time he was talking
[1:46:11] about wrestling with a dog he said he
[1:46:14] had that dog and pl tug war on y'all
[1:46:16] probably done that I'm sure they been
[1:46:18] playing tug with this dog and he said I
[1:46:20] had that dog on the carpet and he had so
[1:46:21] much pool and so much G he just nearly
[1:46:24] pull you over is what he's talking about
[1:46:26] he said but if I ever move that dog over
[1:46:28] to the
[1:46:28] tile if I ever move that dog over to the
[1:46:31] tile he was just spinning his wheels and
[1:46:33] he couldn't go nowhere amen he said I
[1:46:36] thought about that Old Devil amen
[1:46:38] because you get out of here brother
[1:46:39] sister and you're living in Satan's Eden
[1:46:42] listen but you are going to feel the
[1:46:44] pool of Darkness you're going to feel
[1:46:46] the pool of the stronghold am but see
[1:46:49] what you need to do is stop trying to

[1:48:20] in
[1:48:21] order it's exactly the
[1:48:23] truth how be it when he the spirit of
[1:48:25] Truth has come he'll guide you guide you
[1:48:28] into all truth he'll not speak of
[1:48:30] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:48:31] that shall he speak he will show you
[1:48:33] things to come amen listen friends this
[1:48:36] is this message this message is the
[1:48:39] spirit of Truth amen listen who was that
[1:48:41] Mighty Angel it was only Christ amen
[1:48:44] only Christ that could have been amen
[1:48:46] you listen what the prophet said in the
[1:48:47] breach he said here come that lamb that
[1:48:49] been slain amen since the foundation of
[1:48:51] the world he took the book he opened the
[1:48:53] book and tore the hills off and he sent
[1:48:55] it back down to the Earth to his seventh
[1:48:57] angel to reveal it to the people amen
[1:49:00] and people want to come along and say
[1:49:02] well I tell you what you know that's
[1:49:03] just brother ROM's thoughts and that's
[1:49:04] brother ROM's opinion you better be
[1:49:06] careful with an idea like that well well
[1:49:08] that was just brother Ram's uh approach
[1:49:10] on it you better be very careful amen
[1:49:13] saying that that's just brother Ram's
[1:49:14] idea I tell you what I'll take a
[1:49:16] prophet's
[1:49:18] opinion I'll take a prophet's opinion
[1:49:20] over what many preachers say in any day
[1:49:23] of the month brother a sister I'll take
[1:49:24] what the prophet thought about it amen
[1:49:26] because last time I check I don't have a
[1:49:28] pillar of fire above my head neither do
[1:49:30] anybody else but God did send a prophet
[1:49:32] that was thoroughly Vindicated amen and
[1:49:35] God was not ashamed to have his
[1:49:37] photograph taken with the prophet so why
[1:49:40] would I be ashamed to tell you what he
[1:49:41] said and why would I be ashamed to be ID
[1:49:44] did I me listen I'm not ashamed Amen to
[1:49:47] be identified as a born again Holy Ghost
[1:49:51] filled in time message believer with
[1:49:54] rapturing faith and rapturing grace and
[1:49:57] the day I ever get ashamed you grab me
[1:49:59] and pray for me and we ought to never be
[1:50:02] ashamed for this
[1:50:05] message it is the spirit of
[1:50:08] Truth and I'll say this if you ever get
[1:50:10] a man truly truly born again he'll come
[1:50:13] to this
[1:50:14] message he'll come to this message you
[1:50:17] say you mean to tell me them folks out
[1:50:19] there in them churches they don't have
[1:50:20] the Holy Ghost not the true born again
[1:50:22] if they do they're going to come to this
[1:50:24] message eventually I'm not saying when
[1:50:26] I'm not saying it won't be a process but
[1:50:28] there it'll create such a search in them
[1:50:31] it'll create such a hunger and they'll
[1:50:33] be searching for truth but they'll sit
[1:50:35] there and know they ain't a chicken
[1:50:37] they'll sit there and know I can't eat
[1:50:38] this vomit on the table they'll sit
[1:50:40] there and know I can't this is not my
[1:50:42] kind of food and it will send them on a
[1:50:45] search and God knows who are his own and
[1:50:48] brother Bob he'll let somebody come to
[1:50:50] you at work and then you'll be begin to
[1:50:53] witness on them but that's how God works
[1:50:56] this message is the spirit of
[1:50:59] Truth where did the Earthly Angel get
[1:51:02] that message from Christ The Mighty
[1:51:04] Angel it's ain't his thoughts it came
[1:51:07] from Christ The Mighty Angel we've got a
[1:51:09] wonderful message we've got a powerful
[1:51:12] message we've got a positive faith
[1:51:15] building message that came from God
[1:51:17] himself and God gave it to the prophet
[1:51:20] and the prophet gave it to you and I I
[1:51:22] me it's amazing because God would begin
[1:51:24] to amen Focus the prophet's Ministry
[1:51:27] there in 1963 upon the word and we all
[1:51:30] know when he's there in Sabino Canyon
[1:51:32] and the sword comes down and it's in his
[1:51:34] hand brother said I was always afraid of
[1:51:36] a
[1:51:36] sword and brother said that's that third
[1:51:39] pole it's the opening of the word it's
[1:51:41] your ministry you say why are you
[1:51:43] preaching about that because I want to
[1:51:44] ask you a question because we're here
[1:51:47] amen and we have been restored and we've
[1:51:49] been balanced and we've been placed
[1:51:51] because a lot of people don't have any
[1:51:53] issue saying William Brandon was
[1:51:55] Revelation
[1:51:56] 10:7 but when you go on down to
[1:51:58] Revelation
[1:52:00] 10:9 when you go on down to Revelation
[1:52:02] 108 and John is told to take the book
[1:52:05] and to eat the book oh brother amen let
[1:52:09] me tell you this very clearly amen John
[1:52:11] is told to take the book out of the hand
[1:52:13] of that angel and I want you to notice
[1:52:15] John tied that bride and listen it's
[1:52:18] amazing because it shows you something
[1:52:19] very powerful because John actually
[1:52:22] would take the book out of the hand of
[1:52:24] the mighty Angel yes he did right did
[1:52:27] but I thought we got the message from
[1:52:28] the seventh angel as son of man Ministry
[1:52:31] very
[1:52:32] perfectly that's exactly right it's the
[1:52:34] ministry of Christ it's the ministry of
[1:52:37] the son of man amen he has no body but
[1:52:40] our body he has no voice but the
[1:52:42] prophets he does nothing unless he
[1:52:44] reveals it to his servants the prophets
[1:52:47] it's exactly the truth brother sister
[1:52:49] amen so where did you take the book out
[1:52:51] of the hand of you got it out of the
[1:52:53] hand of the Prophet hallelujah amen you
[1:52:56] got it out of the hand of the Prophet
[1:52:59] amen listen we come to this message and
[1:53:00] say give me this food amen give me this
[1:53:04] body word of the son of man amen give me
[1:53:07] something to eat give amen I take a book
[1:53:10] listen let me tell you very clearly and
[1:53:11] closely you don't have to beg the bride
[1:53:13] to take the
[1:53:15] book I don't have to come here brother
[1:53:17] the Bonet and say but you better eat
[1:53:18] this food you better take this and you
[1:53:20] don't got to do that to the bride but
[1:53:22] she comes ready she's got her cup lifted
[1:53:25] up and says God I I want to eat this
[1:53:28] morning God I I want to feed this
[1:53:30] morning listen we are hungry in our
[1:53:33] souls brother sister and listen let me
[1:53:35] tell you the only thing that will
[1:53:37] satisfy your soul is the word of God
[1:53:40] this world can't satisfy me amen I want
[1:53:43] to tell you there ain't nobody that Can
[1:53:45] Do Me Like Jesus can there ain't nobody
[1:53:48] that can satisfy me like Jesus is able
[1:53:51] to
[1:53:56] Hallelujah you don't have to beg her to
[1:53:58] eat the word amen you read in Revelation
[1:54:01] 10:11 he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:54:03] again before many peoples people say

[1:54:07] speak that word I'm not this and I'm not
[1:54:10] that but you can speak that word I know
[1:54:11] what the prophet said in the Patmos fion

[1:54:49] the final one but she is a continuation
[1:54:52] of the voice because the word and the
[1:54:55] prophet and the bride the spirit and the
[1:54:57] bride they're all saying the same thing
[1:55:00] it's even so come Lord
[1:55:04] Jesus never failed in the m in the

[2:04:15] message we know where it come from it
[2:04:17] came straight from God so why do you
[2:04:19] want another message why do you want
[2:04:21] another Prophet we got one brother Ram
[2:04:25] said the prophet was the Holy
[2:04:28] Ghost amen because brother Adam's not
[2:04:31] here physically but the holy ghost that
[2:04:33] was in him is here now same Holy Ghost
[2:04:36] sure he had a prophetic gift that we
[2:04:38] don't
[2:04:39] have like he had as all over the world
[2:04:43] but he called us little
[2:04:45] Messiahs whatever he got we get right
[2:04:49] amen it's distributed amongst the bride

[2:05:26] time you are the
[2:05:30] book you're the book that's going to be
[2:05:33] open because the Saints I thought the
[2:05:36] Bible said the Saints judge the Earth
[2:05:38] not a book A book doesn't judge the
[2:05:40] Earth the Saints judge the Earth are you
