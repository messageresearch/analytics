[0:34] you know
[0:35] i was just thinking people
[0:38] don't really know the age we're living
[0:42] but
[0:43] it talked about people being blind
[0:46] miserably naked
[0:48] and don't even know it
[0:50] how could a person
[0:52] in this time not know
[0:55] the condition that we're living
[0:57] and where we live
[0:59] but god had given us
[1:03] the word
[1:04] of the evening time and we would only
[1:06] accept it and receive it
[1:08] and be sincere
[1:10] about what we hear when we're here and
[1:13] walk in it and hold fast to jesus christ
[1:17] we're going to read this morning from
[1:21] psalm 90 we just read the
[1:24] entire chapter of psalm 9.

[1:29] heavenly father as we come together
[1:32] again
[1:33] lord to worship around your holy word

[1:38] each day lord let us understand and love
[1:41] one another and all things that we do
[1:43] father let us pray continually one for
[1:46] another
[1:47] lord jesus if we see our brother our
[1:50] sister
[1:51] in a way lord there shouldn't be let us
[1:54] pray god and uplift them father for we
[1:57] know that without them lord we will not
[2:00] be complete

[3:03] are like grass
[3:05] which growth up
[3:07] in the morning
[3:15] for we are consumed by thine anger and
[3:18] by
[3:19] their wrath
[3:21] are we troubled
[3:31] for all our days are
[3:34] passed away
[3:35] in the raft we spend our years as a tale
[3:40] that is tough
[3:59] who knows the power of that anger
[4:02] even according to thy fear
[4:05] so is that wrath
[4:15] return oh lord

[4:21] repent concerning thy servants

[18:27] devastation there was just ashes
[18:29] everywhere and you know trees standing
[18:31] up and uh burnt half off and all that
[18:34] stuff and
[18:35] and um
[18:37] this park ranger said he happened said
[18:39] something caught his eye and said he
[18:40] turned and looked
[18:42] and he said it looks like it was a dead
[18:44] bird
[18:47] so he looked at it again he thought well
[18:49] i'm i'm just gonna
[18:51] you know see if everything's you know
[18:52] make sure the bird's dead because it was
[18:55] just burnt to a crisp
[18:57] so he took a stick

[19:05] there were six little babies
[19:11] underneath her wings
[19:13] that had survived that fire
[19:17] just cause mama

[28:58] father what a wonderful time we don't
[29:00] know that because we're in time
[29:01] but lord we're heading toward an
[29:03] eternity we've got an eternal word
[29:05] that was given
[29:07] lord through the lips of a prophet
[29:09] that was given to a fivefold ministry to
[29:11] speak to his bride to get us all
[29:14] together and bind us closer together not
[29:16] further apart to bind us together lord
[29:19] in you
[29:20] lord we pray that you just be with us
[29:22] now and further my life service in jesus
[29:24] name we pray
[29:25] amen john 1 verse 1 says in the
[29:27] beginning was the word where it was with
[29:28] god and the word was god
[29:30] and that word was made flesh as brother
[29:32] bob was talking about this morning
[29:34] melchizedek was not
[29:36] your brother melchizedek was
[29:39] created flesh
[29:41] out of existence flesh but it's the same
[29:43] god
[29:44] he was the word but now that word then
[29:47] became flesh through a womb like i was
[29:49] telling you last sunday once he decide
[29:51] once he decided god decided this was his
[29:53] plan that he was going to come into the
[29:55] end of the world through a womb and he
[29:57] was going to be locked in that human
[29:58] body until he died
[30:00] he couldn't move around like he could
[30:01] move he said oh well he can't well no he
[30:03] can't
[30:04] he decided that he was going to be human
[30:07] he decided
[30:08] that he was going to be locked in time
[30:10] on this earth
[30:11] for a period of 30 some odd years he
[30:13] decided that so okay i'm going to let
[30:15] him just have his time have his way
[30:17] that's the best thing for us to do not
[30:18] mess up god's plan and wonder why he did
[30:21] that well he did it for me and you
[30:23] he did it so he could suffer like me and
[30:24] you suffer so he could grow up like me
[30:26] and you grew up so he could look around
[30:28] and see the the world and the
[30:30] systems of the world and condemning the
[30:32] denominational world and different
[30:34] things while he was here knowing that he
[30:36] would do the same thing inside of me in
[30:38] you
[30:39] amen so that word was made flesh and
[30:41] dwelt among us that we behold his glory
[30:42] the glory of the only begotten of the
[30:44] father
[30:44] full of grace
[30:46] and truth you may be seated i'll read
[30:48] the rest of these i'm going to
[30:48] background just a few minutes
[30:52] for the sake of the ones that are
[30:54] that haven't been here in a little while
[30:56] so
[30:57] everybody boy brother michael good
[30:58] looking suit man
[31:00] good job brother michael you know again
[31:01] he's teaching sunday school downstairs
[31:03] for a little time so we appreciate the
[31:05] youth of this church ain't young no more
[31:07] but we appreciate the
[31:09] the ones that are younger that were way
[31:11] baby young
[31:12] are now taking over some of the jobs and
[31:14] even in the back back there
[31:16] we've got um
[31:18] levi and abby and different ones that
[31:21] are in the very back back there running
[31:22] the sound system and i mean and then uh
[31:26] the bonnet girls are running helping
[31:28] with the sound system and so we've got
[31:30] a young group of people so us old people
[31:32] can kind of sit back and watch them
[31:34] watch them grow up like terrence said
[31:36] was about to read kids we were talking
[31:38] about last night
[31:39] we were wondering when was the first
[31:40] time they came and monique said she was
[31:42] four
[31:43] and i can remember when she was four
[31:44] years old she had a frilly white dress
[31:48] it was the whitest frilliest little
[31:50] dress and it was just i mean it was no
[31:51] baby in it it was all frilly dress
[31:55] so we decided to go
[31:58] to sonny's barbecue
[32:02] i don't know who did but
[32:04] we went to sonny's barbecue and here's
[32:06] this little kid that's now growing up
[32:09] sitting right here
[32:11] and that dress wasn't white when we left
[32:20] if you thought of that there's a turkey
[32:21] right who thought of that
[32:24] but they've all grown up so same way
[32:26] with us we've all grown up family so now
[32:27] i pray that we start growing up in the
[32:29] statue of perfect man we start growing
[32:31] up in god and that's what we're going to
[32:32] talk about
[32:34] a little bit background this morning but
[32:35] this afternoon
[32:37] i want you to really pay attention
[32:38] because this afternoon we're going to
[32:40] talk about the virtues
[32:43] not virtue
[32:45] everybody with me because these are the
[32:48] virtues
[32:49] a virtuous person but then there is a
[32:53] then there is a the number one which is
[32:56] to have virtue or brother brown said
[32:58] strength we'll talk about that a little
[32:59] bit later but we got to talk about
[33:01] what's going to happen when we become
[33:03] virtuous when we become to a place
[33:06] i love it when when we were reading in
[33:09] the bible about ruth
[33:11] now
[33:12] remember in ruth's time there wasn't any
[33:15] internet
[33:16] there wasn't facebook there wasn't tick
[33:19] tock there wasn't
[33:20] and i like what sister cletus said to uh
[33:23] luis the other night said i don't know
[33:24] what you're talking about all these tick
[33:25] tocks and
[33:26] and uh facebook's and facetime and
[33:29] and uh what is it instagram and twitter
[33:31] and all that stuff you know well it's a
[33:33] form of
[33:35] getting yourself out there well well
[33:37] ruth didn't have that when she was
[33:38] growing up but the bible says
[33:41] thou art a virtuous woman
[33:44] how did they know that
[33:46] because she the power that was in her
[33:48] made it to where people could see that
[33:51] she wasn't running around she wasn't
[33:52] doing things i was looking at the word
[33:55] virtuous back here a few minutes ago
[33:56] where brother adam was talking about he
[33:58] said you can be virtuous in your body
[34:00] every day of your life and put on that's
[34:02] why we dress the way we do you look at
[34:05] the world they don't dress virtuously
[34:07] they dress to where every man can see
[34:09] every piece of flesh they have
[34:11] and brother brown said i don't care if
[34:13] you're the most virtuous woman in the
[34:15] world if you put your body out there for
[34:16] men to see and they lust after you
[34:19] you've committed adultery and will give
[34:20] an account on the day of judgment
[34:23] so let it then then it does have
[34:25] something to do with the way you dress
[34:27] and man it's what you portray ruth
[34:29] portrayed what
[34:30] she was a virtuous woman she wasn't she
[34:32] didn't stay out all night she didn't do
[34:34] this she didn't do it people could see
[34:38] see her virtue
[34:40] coming forth from her
[34:42] because they said thou art a virtuous
[34:44] woman and i don't think boaz would have
[34:46] had anything to do with her if she
[34:47] wasn't a virtuous woman amen and god's
[34:50] not gonna have anything to do with us
[34:51] unless we're a virtuous
[34:53] woman right we're talking about brides
[34:55] today right amen
[34:58] the first
[34:59] thessalonians force is that every one of
[35:00] us you should know so we got to come to
[35:02] a place to where we know how we're going
[35:04] to know apostles prophets pastors
[35:06] teachers and evangelists
[35:09] we'll read it a little bit for the what
[35:10] perfecting of the saints that's what
[35:12] it's for it's not for you just come and
[35:13] listen to a good dissertation or a good
[35:15] sermon today and you get all riled up or
[35:17] not
[35:18] or you fall asleep or not
[35:20] amen
[35:22] it's to get us as i was reading the
[35:23] quote and i was when we were praying
[35:25] brother brown says i'm here to break
[35:27] individuals not an organization don't
[35:30] not organize lula church
[35:33] but organize
[35:34] an organism take an organism you are an
[35:37] organism
[35:38] and put us all together where we do work
[35:41] together as apostles prophets pastor
[35:42] teachers an evangelist for the what
[35:44] perfecting of all of us that's right i
[35:46] need perfecting by the five four
[35:48] ministries but by the way you're part of
[35:49] the fivefold ministry yeah but i gotta
[35:51] be perfected by the fivefold ministry i
[35:53] can't we're not set apart somewhere
[35:56] right i'll promise you that never put
[35:58] somebody on the pedestal because satan
[35:59] is there to knock them off
[36:02] amen
[36:03] let's put god up there
[36:05] and that's the one we want to get to
[36:07] anyway
[36:08] so that every one of you should know how
[36:10] to possess
[36:12] you know i don't know one thing about
[36:14] criminal justice
[36:16] but danielle went to school
[36:19] and she knows
[36:20] about how to talk to criminals
[36:23] i wouldn't have that much patience
[36:26] but she knows how to do it why she was
[36:28] schooled
[36:29] she knows you said well we we don't need
[36:31] brother brian said we don't need
[36:32] education he never said we didn't need
[36:34] that knowledge right there
[36:36] he never said we didn't need to learn
[36:38] about
[36:38] god amen
[36:41] it's kind of strange and you know when i
[36:42] was growing up
[36:45] people pulled the kids out of church out
[36:46] of school well some of them church too
[36:49] pulled them out of school because
[36:50] brother brown says education is of the
[36:52] devil
[36:53] when all his kids graduated high school
[36:55] one of them went to college and i'm like
[36:57] what's he teaching this and then
[36:59] see it's the ignorance of people
[37:01] amen it's the ignorance of people
[37:04] if you lean on your education that is of
[37:06] the devil your education but if you lean
[37:09] on god's education because a pastor
[37:11] teacher they teach you they teach what a
[37:13] teacher is to teach you something right
[37:16] so every one of you should know how to
[37:17] possess his vessel not that i don't know
[37:19] how to possess michael's he'll know how
[37:21] to possess his own all right in what
[37:23] sanctification
[37:25] and honor
[37:26] romans 12 verse 2 says be not conformed
[37:28] to this world we're going to we're going
[37:29] to hammer on this a little more even
[37:31] louise was on it wednesday night that
[37:33] was a good job he did wednesday night
[37:35] we appreciate the fivefold ministry
[37:38] bringing different angles but he read
[37:40] the same scripture but be what
[37:41] transformed
[37:43] by the renewing of what your mind
[37:46] look
[37:48] you could put a period there and be done
[37:50] with it but it's a comma that ye may
[37:53] prove
[37:55] ruth proved who she was she proved she
[37:57] was a virtuous woman
[37:59] they didn't have a commentary written
[38:01] about her it was her person her persona
[38:04] her her past
[38:08] you say i don't want the world know
[38:09] about my past well
[38:11] you better have a past with god
[38:14] you better have a place where you put
[38:15] the nail down back here and then you
[38:17] walked and people can see that walk is
[38:19] different than what it was before
[38:22] amen what's wrong with you i want
[38:24] somebody well let y'all say that about
[38:26] me anyway
[38:28] what's wrong with you
[38:29] but i want people to say what's wrong
[38:31] with that guy
[38:33] they tell me it works they start talking
[38:34] about all these series and different
[38:36] things you know what yellowstone and all
[38:38] i don't know what it is but they start
[38:39] talking about these and they get into it
[38:41] bob like they're like they're it's like
[38:42] a soap opera they get into it like
[38:44] what'd you see i wonder what's wrong
[38:46] with mary
[38:47] wonder what's wrong with john do you see
[38:48] you got pregnant
[38:50] they and they start telling me they look
[38:51] at me and i'll go
[38:56] don't know what you're talking about
[38:59] they say you're strange i said that's
[39:00] okay i can be strange
[39:02] leave me alone i don't want to care
[39:04] about i don't get wrapped up i got a big
[39:06] enough soap opera in my own life i don't
[39:08] need one on
[39:12] television and the bride says amen
[39:16] but you see how satan gets us wrapped up
[39:18] in all that and pulls us apart from god
[39:21] so this so this has got to be a
[39:22] transforming by the renewing of your
[39:24] mind
[39:25] that you may prove what is that good
[39:27] everything i'm reading is something you
[39:29] got to do though remember we talked
[39:31] about faith and works
[39:34] you got to show your faith by your works
[39:38] and man you can't just say i've got
[39:39] great faith
[39:41] and then you don't show up for church
[39:42] that's right here we go again
[39:45] you tell me you got all this stuff and
[39:46] don't show up for church no it's a lie
[39:48] the devil has given you a lie that's
[39:50] right
[39:52] but you gotta have you gotta say well
[39:54] that's why that
[39:56] for some people it's hard
[39:58] because they've been in that furrow for
[40:00] so long
[40:02] the furrow that i was in is that samuel
[40:05] dale
[40:06] on sunday morning there was not one
[40:09] thing
[40:12] going to stop me from going jerks
[40:14] and guess what
[40:16] we went too
[40:18] okay
[40:19] we tried to stay in the bed as long as
[40:21] we could
[40:23] and me and tanner's support with support
[40:25] back then we had to sleep in the same
[40:26] bed
[40:27] of course my sister didn't ever realize
[40:29] any of that
[40:30] but we were we were laying in bed and we
[40:33] said well just a few more minutes daddy
[40:34] daddy'll forget about us yeah right
[40:36] he'll forget about you
[40:37] yeah he comes in there and he takes that
[40:39] big old hand and he grabs the bottom of
[40:40] the of the sheets and he crumples up his
[40:42] fist and throws them across the thing
[40:44] here you are you know you the cold is
[40:46] ice
[40:47] so you had to get up
[40:49] but that was what we came up under we
[40:51] didn't come up under one you feel like
[40:52] going to name one no
[40:54] well cat's got diarrhea again so we
[40:56] can't go
[40:58] grief
[41:00] kind of bad when you get sick and you
[41:02] stay sick on sunday and then you go
[41:03] party on monday tuesday or go on
[41:05] vacation or something you know but just
[41:06] smile better praise the lord and
[41:08] somebody prayed for me sunday
[41:12] just saying that look but you're going
[41:14] to pray we're going to prove who we are
[41:16] we are going to prove who we are
[41:19] regardless of whether you say well i'm
[41:21] just going to hold it inside i'm not
[41:22] going to say anything
[41:24] no you go one day you're going to prove
[41:26] who you are amen
[41:28] you're either and so remember i told you
[41:30] brother brown said there's only two
[41:31] things that you're motivated by what
[41:33] faith or doubt
[41:35] either you've got god in your soul today
[41:37] or you've got satan in your soul today
[41:39] that's just
[41:40] i'm sorry that's just the way it is
[41:44] that you may prove what is that good and
[41:46] acceptable and perfect
[41:49] will of god everybody wants the perfect
[41:51] will of god right
[41:52] okay well then let's get in the word of
[41:54] god
[41:56] ii peter once said simon peter's servant
[41:58] apostle of jesus christ to them they
[42:00] have obtained this light precious faith
[42:02] with us through the righteousness of god
[42:04] and our savior jesus christ grace and
[42:06] peace
[42:07] be multiplied i love those words
[42:10] unto you through the knowledge of god
[42:12] and of jesus our lord there's the
[42:14] knowledge of god
[42:16] according as his divine power has given
[42:18] unto us what all things that pertaining
[42:20] to life and godliness through the
[42:21] knowledge of him that have called us to
[42:23] glory and virtue he's building up to
[42:25] somebody to somebody
[42:28] this is building up peter is building up
[42:30] to somebody
[42:31] a person
[42:32] all right we know it's jesus christ but
[42:34] he's then when we get the divine nature
[42:36] of jesus christ that puts us in that
[42:38] furrow that i'm talking about you get in
[42:40] that furrow and you stay in that furl
[42:42] and you listen to what god has to say
[42:44] whereby are giving unto us exceeding
[42:46] great and precious promises that by
[42:48] these you might be what partakers of
[42:50] that divine nature partakers of faith
[42:53] partakers of knowledge particulars of
[42:55] virtue of temperance patience guidance
[42:57] partakers of that
[42:59] it's not so far off that we can't do it
[43:01] amen
[43:03] that by these you might be partakers of
[43:05] the divine nature look having escaped
[43:07] that's the renewing of your mind your
[43:09] mind is all it's it's bound up
[43:13] it's in prison
[43:15] souls in prison now what were they in
[43:17] prison in their mind amen
[43:19] but they would have escaped the
[43:21] corruption that is in the world through
[43:23] lust
[43:25] and that's what we're beginning that's
[43:26] the beginning of the foundation we've
[43:28] been talking about forever
[43:30] is you must know that you're justified
[43:32] you must know that you're sanctified and
[43:34] you must know that you're filled with
[43:36] the holy ghost not just anointing
[43:38] that you're filled with the holy ghost
[43:39] and your desire i read your quote last
[43:41] sunday your desire is to be a church
[43:44] it's not
[43:45] i gotta go it's a desire it's a want to
[43:50] if the want to is not there you won't
[43:52] have the person inside of you that wrote
[43:54] the bible
[43:57] so the first stage is the birth you got
[43:59] to make sure you're born again that's
[44:00] why it's really wide down at the bottom
[44:02] faith really wide
[44:05] wide
[44:06] foundation because you're not going to
[44:08] get the virtue of jesus christ if you
[44:10] don't have the divine nature of jesus
[44:13] christ
[44:14] all right
[44:15] because look
[44:17] you are not your own source of these
[44:20] virtues think about that you are not
[44:23] your own source well i'm just going to
[44:24] because brother brown says even a statue
[44:26] of perfect man he says some of these
[44:27] have a portion of these virtues that are
[44:29] just out in the world
[44:32] but not godly virtues
[44:33] not the fullness of godly virtues and
[44:36] you can't now buy the new birth though
[44:38] you do have a source to get it from
[44:41] but without the new birth you don't have
[44:42] a source to get it from there's just
[44:44] some people that are good there's just
[44:46] some people that are bad
[44:48] it's just the way it is
[44:50] there's a lot of good people going to be
[44:52] in hell
[44:54] because they turn jesus christ down even
[44:56] though they're good people
[45:00] i just pray there's grace for them
[45:04] so the baptism of the holy ghost is what
[45:06] seeing you have what purified your souls
[45:07] i thought god did the purifying
[45:12] that seems a little odd doesn't it
[45:15] how many times have i read that
[45:17] several times have you ever just read
[45:19] that and stopped for a minute see you
[45:20] have purified your souls
[45:24] unclean spirit goes out
[45:26] you lock it down by the baptism of the
[45:28] holy ghost and then your soul has got to
[45:31] be still you got to be purified keep
[45:33] going what and obeying the truth to get
[45:36] that thing locked in to get where
[45:38] there's no hole where satan can get
[45:40] listen if there's a crack the devil can
[45:42] find it
[45:43] if there's a crack that you can't see
[45:46] he'll find it
[45:48] get that thing sealed together
[45:51] and obey what the truth so you got to
[45:53] find the truth
[45:56] through the spirit under what unfeigned
[45:58] in other words
[46:00] nothing
[46:01] is going to keep you
[46:03] from being a christian
[46:05] nothing
[46:07] i read you and i will read in a few
[46:08] minutes where jesus said you got to
[46:09] forsake father mother sister brother
[46:11] that's why the the carnal mind that's
[46:13] why we got to have a renewing of our
[46:15] mind the carnal mind is against all that
[46:18] that's why you look at when jesus was on
[46:20] earth everything he said was contrary to
[46:23] common practice
[46:26] think about it he was just contrary to
[46:28] all that that's why they hated him
[46:29] that's why they couldn't understand him
[46:31] that's why they called him all those
[46:32] names
[46:33] but now peter on the day of pentecost he
[46:35] didn't call him that
[46:36] why because that person was inside of
[46:38] him
[46:39] that person was residing in him and he
[46:41] knew then why jesus acted odd
[46:44] he knew then why jesus said hey
[46:47] let the dead bear the dead
[46:49] come follow me
[46:51] i didn't come to bring peace i come to
[46:53] bring a sword
[46:55] oh my he was the prince of peace
[46:58] but he said he came to bring a division
[47:00] a sword mother against father sister
[47:03] against brother that's what he said it's
[47:05] the bible
[47:06] but by the renewing of our mind we
[47:07] understand what that is it does pull us
[47:10] away from the world i'm not going to let
[47:13] my mother father sister or brother keep
[47:15] me away from god and listen god's not
[47:17] going to let your mother father sister
[47:19] brother keep you away from god
[47:21] you're the only one
[47:23] that's going to let
[47:25] your children
[47:26] your job
[47:29] your mom and your daddy
[47:33] like i said a million times before
[47:37] your kids are watching you the ones on
[47:38] this list right here
[47:41] how many times the brother dale says
[47:42] that maybe it's because of you they're
[47:44] not here
[47:50] because they don't see god in you
[47:55] that'll make us quiet
[47:58] just start thinking though
[48:00] if i can just get my mind
[48:03] on god
[48:04] purified from the things of the world
[48:07] unto unfeigned love of the brethren i'd
[48:09] rather be here than be anywhere in the
[48:10] world
[48:12] with my brothers and sisters amen see
[48:14] that you love one another with a pure
[48:17] heart
[48:18] fervently not just i love you
[48:21] no fervently
[48:25] being born again
[48:27] not a corruptible seed but of
[48:28] incorruptible by the word of god which
[48:30] liveth and the body forever so the only
[48:32] way for you to get born again is to have
[48:34] the word of god somewhere around you
[48:36] you've got to hear the word of god you
[48:38] can't read as dad says grier's almanac
[48:40] you can't read uh good news for modern
[48:42] men max locator and all these different
[48:44] ones sure they may have some good ideas
[48:46] they may have some good ways
[48:48] but i'd rather read the word of god and
[48:50] the prophet's message
[48:52] amen
[48:53] than all these other books and listen
[48:55] reading the books is not bad i've got a
[48:56] lot of stuff from different different
[48:58] people spurgeon all the different ones
[49:00] you know
[49:01] smith wigglesworth wonderful but they
[49:03] didn't have a message behind
[49:06] their message
[49:08] everybody with me the prophet of god had
[49:10] a message that was vindicated by god in
[49:12] the bible
[49:13] dwight moody had a message he had a move
[49:15] a move of god brother brown said he put
[49:17] millions of people in heaven
[49:20] christians
[49:21] but not like the bride that we're
[49:23] talking about today we're talking about
[49:24] somebody that's a little bit different
[49:27] a little bit odd
[49:28] listen when that uh the armor meat
[49:31] packing uh story
[49:32] the three sisters were common they were
[49:34] just oh you know we're gonna dance and
[49:37] we're gonna catch his eye but what
[49:39] caught the man's eye
[49:42] not the frilly dress and the paint and
[49:44] the
[49:45] what caught his eyes he walked outside
[49:47] and he saw a woman in her place washing
[49:50] in that place i mean the inner place in
[49:52] that place washing stuff lily hush
[49:55] why
[49:56] watch and then what did he do now listen
[49:58] he didn't have well i saw her on
[49:59] facebook yesterday
[50:02] i saw her she's got a twitter account oh
[50:04] look at that
[50:05] no he kept watching her
[50:08] and kept watching her she was different
[50:11] she was different
[50:13] she was odd
[50:14] to the other people that were there
[50:16] but guess who he came after
[50:18] he didn't come and get those other ones
[50:20] he came and got that odd one
[50:22] that man one year later he said i'm
[50:24] coming back to get you because i see
[50:26] something a character in you that's not
[50:28] in those other people
[50:32] so how we're going to get there
[50:33] therefore leaving the principles of the
[50:35] doctrine of christ leaving that
[50:36] foundation not tearing it up
[50:39] building on top of it all right build on
[50:41] top of that foundation leaving the
[50:43] principle of the doctrine of christ let
[50:44] us go on into perfection
[50:47] that must mean that we're not so perfect
[50:48] when we first get started
[50:51] amen your soul by the new birth is but
[50:54] that outside realm memory reason
[50:56] conscious affects your imagination if
[50:57] that's not if that's not what bothers
[50:59] you pray for me
[51:01] that's what bothers me
[51:02] my memory of things i did
[51:04] the consciousness that i have of things
[51:06] i did man
[51:09] that's right
[51:10] am i so wrong from that
[51:12] that's where our problem is your
[51:13] problem's not in your flesh oh yeah
[51:15] you're getting older we're looking older
[51:16] we're getting pain sister francis sister
[51:19] francine i said how you doing she said
[51:20] i've got these pains that i've never had
[51:22] before
[51:24] i said you're older than you ever have
[51:26] been before
[51:28] so that that's just part of the sin
[51:31] curse of the fall
[51:34] but inside of you though is a soul
[51:36] that's either born again or not and then
[51:37] you've got an outer realm called the
[51:40] spirit remember reason conscious effects
[51:41] and imagination that all that's spinning
[51:43] around in
[51:45] amen and whatever you
[51:47] whichever one
[51:48] black dog white dog whichever one you
[51:50] feed the most is the one who's gonna win
[51:53] amen that's why i said before let it out
[51:56] if you've got a soul that's born again
[51:57] let that thing start working on it on
[51:59] the middle realm if you don't then you
[52:01] need to get born again because you never
[52:03] will
[52:05] come to the knowledge of the truth
[52:07] unless you got the truth inside of you
[52:09] therefore leaving the principle of the
[52:10] doctrine of class let us go on into
[52:12] perfection not laying again the
[52:14] foundation of repentance as i was saying
[52:16] a couple of sundays ago we had about
[52:18] we've had 20 people be baptized and some
[52:20] were baptized over again there's got to
[52:22] come a time where you got to quit
[52:24] getting wet
[52:25] you got to put steak down that's it no
[52:27] more i'm going forward
[52:29] hey man i'll baptize you many times as
[52:31] you want to but there's got to come a
[52:32] time where this right here has got to
[52:33] happen we've got to leave that
[52:37] in other words build on it when you have
[52:39] a foundation of a house you don't leave
[52:41] it like get rid of it you leave it where
[52:43] it's at
[52:44] and then you build on top of it
[52:47] that's what all of us all the years
[52:49] brother dale's preached 40 something
[52:50] years we ought to have a foundation that
[52:52] can't be shaken
[52:54] it can't be stirred it can't be moved
[52:58] because it's the right foundation it was
[53:00] built on the right place at the right
[53:02] time
[53:03] listen for the right group of people
[53:07] spitting all over the place
[53:09] of the doctrine of that
[53:12] how'd that happen
[53:18] you know what it is though
[53:20] can we not put our confidence
[53:22] on that
[53:24] i can put my confidence on that
[53:27] that we have a sure foundation
[53:29] a firm foundation
[53:32] one that cannot be moved
[53:33] it should not ever be shaken
[53:36] oh it's going to be all the winds of
[53:39] the winds of of things are going to come
[53:41] upon us doctrines or whatever you want
[53:42] to say or or people's ideas or or uh
[53:46] well i think you're doing this wrong or
[53:47] you think you're doing this right
[53:49] human beings
[53:51] if it weren't for humans we'd have a
[53:53] good church
[54:01] thank you sister
[54:04] but we got to have them
[54:05] amen of the doctrine of baptism and have
[54:08] laying on of hands and of resurrection
[54:10] of the dead and of eternal judgment
[54:12] and look and this we will do or will we
[54:15] do if god permits so god has permitted
[54:17] now in the end time he has given us a
[54:20] place an opportunity to go on with god
[54:23] to not just say i'm born again
[54:28] no i'm born again plus yes
[54:31] i'm this rod that we're looking at here
[54:33] i'm that rod but that rod's got to have
[54:36] some buzz on it that rod's got to put
[54:39] for some almonds because that's the life
[54:41] that's inside of that stick
[54:44] and that stick was dead you and i all
[54:46] both were dead sticks
[54:48] but god is what raised us up that's
[54:51] right praise the lord
[54:53] the ark is the symbol of the son of man
[54:55] i'll just kind of background a little
[54:56] bit i'll get to my
[54:58] point in just a minute and brother brown
[55:00] thank god for a prophet
[55:02] he knows how to say these things look
[55:04] anyone who knows the scripture now
[55:07] probably not brother donnie
[55:09] there was people in you know he says
[55:11] anyone who knows scripture
[55:13] well that's probably 90 of the people in
[55:15] that church didn't know that he was
[55:16] fixing to say wood speaks of
[55:19] humanity and
[55:20] gold's piece of deity
[55:22] but being cordial and being nice and
[55:24] being sweet
[55:26] he's including everybody anyone knows
[55:28] the scripture says
[55:29] that gold speaks of deity
[55:31] and wood speaks of humanity see you
[55:34] shall cover it overland with gold that's
[55:35] what we were talking about part of that
[55:37] ark is wood
[55:39] it's not pure gold it's part wood
[55:42] it's got wood involved in other words
[55:44] it's got humanity involved in it
[55:46] amen but it's overlaid by gold and when
[55:49] christ hung on the cross it was wood
[55:52] but it was deity hanging on the cross
[55:55] standing in judgment for me and you
[55:58] overlaid in gold because listen inside
[56:01] of that ark is the two tables of stone
[56:03] which says thou shalt not and if you do
[56:05] you die
[56:06] thou shalt not and if you do you die
[56:09] but there was a man called jesus christ
[56:11] the gold part the deity part of it
[56:14] now what are me and you
[56:18] by the new birth we are deity yes sir
[56:21] unveiled in human flesh
[56:24] and the word was made flesh well the
[56:26] word's gone by the way this guy ain't
[56:27] left with brother branham
[56:30] no you're the word made flesh i thought
[56:32] the law speaks of judgment but between
[56:34] the law and the congregation there was
[56:36] something for deity
[56:38] stood in its place type of christ
[56:40] and then down here at the bottom brother
[56:42] brown said deity stands in the way
[56:44] between judgment
[56:45] the judgment of god was met by deity
[56:50] dedicated to death
[56:53] was what the
[56:55] three wise men brought jesus when he was
[56:57] born
[56:58] brother brown said a type of deity
[57:00] dedicated to death gold frankincense and
[57:02] myrrh
[57:02] then we talk about aaron's rod again
[57:04] look everything it was was restored
[57:06] again so what we're looking at we're
[57:07] looking at a dead stick we have debt
[57:09] we're all dead sticks
[57:11] amen
[57:12] but once put in the shekinah glory
[57:15] what's in that third department not the
[57:18] second one not the first one in that
[57:20] third compartment where nobody's back
[57:22] there but you and god
[57:25] either something's gonna die or it's
[57:27] gonna come to life one of the two amen
[57:30] but you put it under the shekinah glory
[57:33] everything it was was restored what that
[57:35] old dead stick that was dead couldn't
[57:36] produce anything
[57:38] you put it in a shekinah glory guess
[57:40] what
[57:42] please come out
[57:45] blooms come out
[57:48] almonds come out
[57:50] and you know what's miraculous with that
[57:54] it was shut up in a tent
[57:58] and an almond if y'all read your if
[58:01] y'all read about almonds
[58:03] your almonds only bloom when it's been
[58:06] pollinated
[58:08] and it's pollinated by bees
[58:11] how did that thing get pollinated
[58:13] overnight and make almonds inside of a
[58:16] building
[58:17] god
[58:18] how did you get saved god
[58:22] amen the impossibility of you making it
[58:26] you're born dead
[58:31] a stick
[58:34] that's the way a sinner is when he goes
[58:35] under the kind of glory of the holy
[58:36] spirit the veil drops behind him
[58:38] everything he ought to have been the son
[58:40] of god what bloom's out that's what
[58:42] we're going to talk about that's why my
[58:43] brother least was talking about this it
[58:45] just it just struck my heart it that's
[58:47] that's the almond that's that's just a
[58:48] dead stick
[58:50] but it's got life now it's going to
[58:52] start producing something and you know
[58:54] what when he brought that stick out
[58:57] guess what the whole congregation
[58:59] identified that that stick was different
[59:02] yes
[59:03] because why it showed what it was
[59:06] it showed the fruit it showed everything
[59:09] all right
[59:10] same way with me and you
[59:12] a son of god blooms out in him again
[59:15] amen remember overnight it budded
[59:17] blossom grow to almonds fruits of the
[59:18] spirit love joy long suffering goodness
[59:21] gentleness patience
[59:22] that's what we need to get in the third
[59:24] step in the shekinah glory in other
[59:26] words where that little sacred light was
[59:28] hanging over the mercy seat
[59:30] you know the night you got born again of
[59:31] the day you got born again there was a
[59:32] halo of light
[59:34] you just didn't see it
[59:36] there was a halo of light and it's not
[59:38] right here
[59:39] it disappeared in here
[59:42] amen
[59:43] you carry the shekinah glory today if
[59:46] you're born again
[59:48] you carry as brother bible talk about
[59:50] that part of that genesis 1 26
[59:52] that's that's your kind of glory
[59:54] that was a that was a precursor that was
[59:57] genesis 1 26 coming down into this time
[1:00:00] element in a halo of light yes
[1:00:03] and you were in that hollow
[1:00:06] you were part of that that's why
[1:00:08] and you may not understand this
[1:00:11] but there's no way you can get a
[1:00:12] revelation without the one that wrote it
[1:00:14] inside of you
[1:00:17] not a true revelation you say oh that's
[1:00:20] good that sounds really good
[1:00:22] yeah but what's it doing to you what's
[1:00:24] it doing for you
[1:00:26] is it changing your life is it making
[1:00:28] you better is it making you worse
[1:00:31] but that's your kind of glory that part
[1:00:33] of that genesis 1 26 that's what he led
[1:00:36] those children of israel through
[1:00:38] their journey
[1:00:40] above them
[1:00:41] right
[1:00:42] but remember that's the kind of glory
[1:00:44] went away
[1:00:47] when jesus christ stepped on earth
[1:00:50] you say no it didn't you understand what
[1:00:51] i mean it went in that man
[1:00:54] that genesis 1 26 man was in jesus when
[1:00:56] he came on earth thereby with me
[1:00:59] he was not just part of the kind of
[1:01:01] glory he was the shekinah glory
[1:01:03] he was
[1:01:05] the holy of holies walking in human
[1:01:08] flesh well there where were you you were
[1:01:09] inside of him
[1:01:11] that's why folks i'm telling you when
[1:01:13] you get the new birth that's one
[1:01:15] evidence is that you agree not just to
[1:01:18] go well yo that's good no you don't
[1:01:20] agree it becomes a part of you
[1:01:22] it becomes a part of your life it
[1:01:24] becomes a part of you
[1:01:26] what kind of vocabulary did we have
[1:01:28] before
[1:01:30] it was pretty horrible wasn't it
[1:01:32] but now that vocabulary has changed and
[1:01:34] now i love to hear the word of god i
[1:01:36] love to talk about the word of god you
[1:01:38] should love that
[1:01:39] it should be something you say hey tell
[1:01:42] me about that don't tell me about that
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:46] amen
[1:01:48] because when i was out in the world i
[1:01:49] promise you i wasted a lot of times
[1:01:50] reading stuff i should not read
[1:01:53] amen
[1:01:56] what a beautiful picture it is today of
[1:01:57] a consecrated life beautiful picture
[1:02:01] once enters in with christ
[1:02:03] dead to the things of the world
[1:02:05] hid away with god and the veil dropped
[1:02:07] down around and all the world shut off
[1:02:10] that's what it felt like last night
[1:02:11] that's why i like to come here when
[1:02:13] there's nobody yet no yakking going on
[1:02:14] no talking
[1:02:16] total quiet
[1:02:18] except for a little background music
[1:02:21] you come in you pray
[1:02:24] like i said before me man i was talking
[1:02:25] about joe telling joe this morning
[1:02:28] i saw him well i didn't tell him this
[1:02:30] but he'll hear it now but
[1:02:32] i walked out the door this uh brother
[1:02:35] john and sister alicia was the last two
[1:02:36] give them kudos they were they were the
[1:02:39] last two that was that ready to leave so
[1:02:41] i stepped out and i looked at brother
[1:02:42] joe walking toward his van
[1:02:44] and and he turned he didn't see me but
[1:02:47] he turned and you could just see this
[1:02:49] this happy glow
[1:02:52] just just and like i said like the like
[1:02:54] the cares of the world had just been
[1:02:55] stripped away for a little while
[1:02:57] and listen i know one thing's for sure
[1:03:00] the devil was still there
[1:03:03] okay
[1:03:04] but listen there's a power there's a
[1:03:06] dunamis inside of us that pushes that
[1:03:09] thing away
[1:03:10] listen it is a powerful force yes
[1:03:14] that we don't use a lot of times
[1:03:18] i mean what were you doing last night
[1:03:22] between seven and eight i it's listen
[1:03:24] voluntary i don't count names i don't
[1:03:26] keep up with stuff like that that don't
[1:03:28] bother me that's between you and god

[1:03:55] a consecrated life who once enters in
[1:03:56] with christ dead to the things of the
[1:03:58] world hid away with god and the veils
[1:04:00] drop down around all the world shut off
[1:04:02] then look then christianity and religion
[1:04:04] becomes a what
[1:04:07] pleasure

[1:04:10] everybody believe brother brown was a
[1:04:12] prophet i'm in the right place right

[1:04:15] shifted
[1:04:15] shifted over somewhere today people just
[1:04:18] have enough religion to make them
[1:04:20] miserable
[1:04:23] and that's correct
[1:04:25] just enough religion to make you
[1:04:27] miserable
[1:04:28] listen you hang around this message all
[1:04:29] you want to but if you're not born again

[1:04:33] person in the world because you're gonna
[1:04:34] have to hear me complain about you not
[1:04:36] coming to church
[1:04:41] today people just have enough religion
[1:04:43] to make them miserable
[1:04:44] knowing that they ought to do this
[1:04:45] they're trying to escape hell
[1:04:49] i hope he didn't get up this morning

[1:04:51] to church today

[1:05:16] i love being around his people
[1:05:19] i really do god knows my heart i love
[1:05:21] being around his people but listen
[1:05:23] before i was born again i was ashamed to
[1:05:25] be around him
[1:05:27] i didn't want to be around brother
[1:05:28] colley
[1:05:29] i sure didn't want to be around tom
[1:05:31] falbush
[1:05:34] because he'd be on your head every five
[1:05:36] seconds
[1:05:38] i mean you saw big brother tom was he
[1:05:40] grabbed you by the shoulder and he said
[1:05:42] boy

[1:05:48] i'm like going where
[1:05:51] living in sin you know i'm like going

[1:06:16] wrong because they're some of them are
[1:06:18] married but
[1:06:21] asa
[1:06:23] where's julie
[1:06:24] asa grace
[1:06:28] think about them all ashley jeffrey
[1:06:30] jeffrey's back there but
[1:06:33] call james
[1:06:35] i like what brother keith said when he
[1:06:36] was here remember he was here the last
[1:06:37] time we were we were we were downstairs
[1:06:39] and in a bible study
[1:06:41] talk about speaking the word for your
[1:06:43] kids
[1:06:44] listen we can't save them
[1:06:46] but we can get so much close to god till
[1:06:50] he'll honor what we said
[1:06:54] oh i don't know
[1:06:55] brother branham
[1:06:57] that ain't nothing but the truth she
[1:07:00] didn't know one thing about a seal
[1:07:02] she didn't know one thing about a vial
[1:07:04] or daniel 70 weeks she just said that
[1:07:06] ain't nothing but the truth prophet of
[1:07:08] god and the prophet said whatever you
[1:07:10] want
[1:07:11] you ask him for it and she said the
[1:07:13] salvation of my two sons
[1:07:15] well the salvation of my children lord
[1:07:17] i'm looking the prophet's gone but the
[1:07:19] word's still here
[1:07:24] god changed me
[1:07:26] so that my kids can be changed
[1:07:29] change me so that my husband and my wife
[1:07:31] can be changed
[1:07:32] you see i've already got the new bird
[1:07:34] changed me some more
[1:07:40] brother brown said you'd be so close to
[1:07:42] god until satan won't know what to do
[1:07:44] with you i am waiting and wanting that
[1:07:46] time
[1:07:48] aren't you not aren't you tired of that
[1:07:50] idiot
[1:07:51] sitting on your shoulder
[1:07:53] [Applause]
[1:07:56] yeah he's an idiot
[1:08:00] but now that we come to the new birth
[1:08:05] with faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:08:06] we built a foundation i hope we i hope
[1:08:08] i've said enough
[1:08:10] to where we are not going to don't ask
[1:08:13] for the knowledge of god without asking
[1:08:15] for the new birth first
[1:08:17] all right
[1:08:18] now god can do a short quick work no
[1:08:21] doubt but you got to be quickened first
[1:08:24] you've got to have the divine nature of
[1:08:26] god something what to vulcanize
[1:08:29] you got to have rubber to rubber
[1:08:31] amen
[1:08:32] in other words we got to have stone to
[1:08:34] stone
[1:08:35] a rock to a rock
[1:08:39] but here we're going to start
[1:08:42] with these virtues
[1:08:45] not this afternoon but we're going to
[1:08:46] talk about these virtues not virtue
[1:08:48] these virtues which is what it's what
[1:08:50] the son of god portrayed the son of man
[1:08:53] portrayed the son of god portrayed
[1:08:54] through the son of man when he was on
[1:08:56] earth anybody with me i mixed my words
[1:08:58] there for a minute the son of god is
[1:08:59] what spirit god
[1:09:01] that's the holy ghost that you have
[1:09:02] today that was in jesus like brother bob
[1:09:05] was talking about that wasn't that he
[1:09:06] got the holy ghost he was the holy oak
[1:09:08] amen he didn't have to get anything
[1:09:11] but now he did have to grow in grace and
[1:09:13] knowledge the bible says
[1:09:15] that he grew in grace and not what the
[1:09:17] humanity part of him
[1:09:21] he was human
[1:09:23] but he was god
[1:09:24] but now listen what's the difference now
[1:09:27] i'm human
[1:09:31] but i'm god
[1:09:35] made flesh in another form
[1:09:38] called the bride
[1:09:41] not johnny depp
[1:09:45] but you see that analogy that he used
[1:09:46] that's exactly what god is he's given
[1:09:48] himself in different forms same guy
[1:09:51] look same character same characteristic
[1:09:54] of that person
[1:09:56] i don't want an actor no
[1:09:58] man
[1:09:59] he is that person
[1:10:03] and where does that person reside if he
[1:10:05] resides in you he's going to make you be
[1:10:08] happy
[1:10:09] in christianity and religion just like i
[1:10:11] read you before
[1:10:13] happy
[1:10:16] but we're heading toward that right
[1:10:17] there we're heading toward the son of
[1:10:19] man the revelation of the son of man
[1:10:20] which is god in human flesh but look
[1:10:22] he's got to start here i'm going to read
[1:10:24] you a quote in just a few minutes where
[1:10:25] brother branham talks about
[1:10:28] why were you tonight where it says build
[1:10:30] me up lord
[1:10:32] build me up so that i can bring these
[1:10:34] people individuals
[1:10:36] up the statue of a perfect man that's
[1:10:38] not a collective bringing up that's an
[1:10:40] individual bringing up
[1:10:46] something needs more temperance some
[1:10:47] needs more patience some needs more this
[1:10:48] and than the other that's why he gave
[1:10:50] some
[1:10:52] apostles
[1:10:53] some prophets some evangelists and some
[1:10:55] pastors one for the perfecting the same
[1:10:57] he gave us five different avenues
[1:11:01] pick one
[1:11:02] it'll do you some good yes
[1:11:06] i was taken yesterday
[1:11:08] you know we've got now
[1:11:11] we've got like three different factions
[1:11:13] in the message now they're all splitting
[1:11:14] off from each other you've got the group
[1:11:16] that that
[1:11:17] we don't need a five-fold ministry we
[1:11:19] got brother branham to play tapes
[1:11:21] you know press play and all that group
[1:11:23] up there and wherever they're from up
[1:11:25] north
[1:11:26] then you've got a group that says well
[1:11:31] we've had enough
[1:11:33] shouting
[1:11:35] we need just the word
[1:11:38] then you got another group bob knows
[1:11:40] what i'm talking about
[1:11:41] then we got another group that says we
[1:11:43] ain't had enough shouting we got to know
[1:11:45] this over here
[1:11:46] and we don't want to be any anything
[1:11:48] that's anything that's that's dead needs
[1:11:51] to be buried
[1:11:54] can we not just draw them all together
[1:11:58] can we not just draw them all together
[1:12:01] press play when you want to
[1:12:04] do never deny listening now listen i say
[1:12:06] never deny and it condemns me because i
[1:12:08] don't listen to tapes i can't
[1:12:10] my mind wanders too much i think about
[1:12:13] y'all
[1:12:15] but no my mind wanders but if i'm
[1:12:17] reading i can read that's why i was so
[1:12:19] enamored by that what bob had on we'll
[1:12:21] talk about that later but but i love to
[1:12:23] read
[1:12:24] my books dad knows everybody that knows
[1:12:26] me that you know that my books are just
[1:12:28] like his they're all scribbled up
[1:12:29] they're all marked i love to read
[1:12:32] so i press play but it's in it's in form
[1:12:34] of words you know on a page
[1:12:38] then i hope we do come to a place to
[1:12:40] where we learn a lot from god
[1:12:42] and then i hope maybe somebody will
[1:12:44] stand up one day and start shouting and
[1:12:46] speaking in tongues that'll be the
[1:12:47] happiest thing i've ever had in my life
[1:12:49] and for somebody to do that and do it
[1:12:50] under the inspiration of the holy ghost
[1:12:51] not on the inspiration of the devil
[1:12:54] because gifts and callings
[1:12:57] are without repentance but you can't put
[1:12:59] the word together
[1:13:01] and not be born again
[1:13:05] so let's just bring them all three
[1:13:06] together
[1:13:08] and who's separating this
[1:13:11] the hierarchy of the message yeah
[1:13:12] they're they're the hierarchy of the
[1:13:14] message is separating over here they're
[1:13:15] separating here and they sit separating
[1:13:18] over here this group over here has only
[1:13:19] got you know there are five more
[1:13:21] preachers and no more and they all
[1:13:22] preach all the camps and all the
[1:13:25] sorry
[1:13:26] then you got this group over here that
[1:13:27] when we ain't going to deal with them
[1:13:28] because they shout too much we're just
[1:13:30] going to stay right here and they've got
[1:13:31] their little circle of people
[1:13:33] draw the circle bigger
[1:13:37] love them all that's right
[1:13:39] if you want to shout shout please do let
[1:13:42] it out
[1:13:44] if you want to learn from the word of
[1:13:45] god learn from the word of god but
[1:13:47] somewhere there's got to be a little bit
[1:13:49] of emotion
[1:13:50] look this is not an emotion
[1:14:03] all right
[1:14:04] so now we talked about there's
[1:14:06] talk about the cross bearing the cross
[1:14:08] because i i
[1:14:10] the analogy was just wonderful when i
[1:14:11] was reading this about the
[1:14:13] jesus not carrying the whole cross he
[1:14:15] only carried the top beam because the
[1:14:18] real cross would weigh 400 pounds it's
[1:14:20] just you can't do that even that beam
[1:14:22] probably weighs 100
[1:14:24] or more just the beam the part that
[1:14:26] you're hanging on the bean part and
[1:14:27] that's why that
[1:14:29] that the guy picked it up from jesus and
[1:14:31] carried it for him there's a big burly
[1:14:32] guy big big um brother brown taught
[1:14:35] ethiopian kind of a black guy cyrene all
[1:14:37] right so there's enemies of the cross
[1:14:39] people's not even going to get to it
[1:14:41] then there's people that get to the
[1:14:42] cross listen i want everybody to get to
[1:14:44] the cross brother said for you to go to
[1:14:45] hell you got to crawl over the cross
[1:14:48] so listen let's don't forget calvary
[1:14:50] let's don't make brother branham god
[1:14:53] let's don't make your pastor god let's
[1:14:55] don't make anybody god but god
[1:14:57] and he's the one who died so get to the
[1:14:59] cross
[1:15:00] don't ever forget that don't ever forget
[1:15:02] calvary
[1:15:04] that's the very basic
[1:15:06] of your christianity
[1:15:09] we didn't pray to william branham last
[1:15:10] night we prayed to god
[1:15:12] he's the one who died for me
[1:15:16] but i do believe he used that man to
[1:15:18] speak to me
[1:15:19] so you know what i accept that
[1:15:21] i accept that he used a man to bring me
[1:15:24] god
[1:15:25] amen amen
[1:15:28] and then
[1:15:30] here's the difference
[1:15:32] carry your cross
[1:15:35] people get to the cross they get as
[1:15:37] brother brahma said they get sometimes
[1:15:38] they get a real good case of
[1:15:40] sanctification i'm sorry
[1:15:43] god forgive me in my sins
[1:15:45] clean that unclean thing out of me
[1:15:48] and then some get the holy ghost some
[1:15:50] don't some get the holy ghost and and
[1:15:52] and it seems like they just don't want
[1:15:53] to do anything else
[1:15:56] because carrying the cross is tough
[1:16:00] i was looking online this morning
[1:16:03] there was a cruise ship
[1:16:04] and a battleship
[1:16:07] this is not cruise ship christianity
[1:16:11] everybody caters everybody everybody's
[1:16:13] happy and everybody gets along and
[1:16:15] everybody's good now it's a battleship
[1:16:17] all hands on deck we have a mission to
[1:16:20] do we got a devil to kill
[1:16:23] inside of me and you
[1:16:25] start with us
[1:16:27] shoot me lord
[1:16:28] [Applause]
[1:16:31] and then carry the cross listen
[1:16:34] wars are one used to be not so much
[1:16:37] anymore but wars are won by boots on the
[1:16:39] ground
[1:16:41] now maybe not now because they got
[1:16:42] drones and they got this but back when
[1:16:44] world war one world war ii even korea
[1:16:47] even
[1:16:48] vietnam was won by boots on the ground
[1:16:51] it was won by the soldier
[1:16:54] going into the battle
[1:16:56] and fighting for what they believed in
[1:16:58] now that's what me and you got to come
[1:16:59] to do
[1:17:00] amen
[1:17:02] carry your cross but overlay it with
[1:17:04] deity amen
[1:17:06] your deity the deity inside of you but
[1:17:09] you still got to carry the victim did
[1:17:11] not carry the whole cross but only the
[1:17:13] cross beam and there's your crossbeam
[1:17:15] number one faith
[1:17:17] carry it yes until you get it
[1:17:22] then you grab
[1:17:23] the beam of virtue
[1:17:25] knowledge temperance grab that beam and
[1:17:27] take off with it
[1:17:30] take up your cross
[1:17:32] and follow jesus
[1:17:34] take up your cross what every once in a
[1:17:36] while
[1:17:37] no
[1:17:39] every day because we're going to read it
[1:17:40] here in luke philippians says for many
[1:17:43] walk of whom i've told you often now
[1:17:44] tell you even weeping
[1:17:47] paul weeping
[1:17:50] that they are enemies of the cross of
[1:17:52] christ in other words they're never
[1:17:53] going to get there
[1:17:55] whose end is destruction whose god is
[1:17:57] their belly and whose glory is in their
[1:17:59] shame who mind earthly things
[1:18:03] colossians 2 verse 14 says blotting out
[1:18:05] the handwriting of ordinances that was
[1:18:07] against us which was contrary to us
[1:18:09] and took it out of the way nailing it to
[1:18:13] his cross
[1:18:15] matthew 10 verse 37 he that loveth
[1:18:18] father mother more than me
[1:18:20] is not worthy of me
[1:18:22] and he that loveth son or daughter
[1:18:25] more than me is not worthy
[1:18:27] of me like i said before they're
[1:18:29] watching you
[1:18:33] it's okay to you know i love
[1:18:36] hannah josh
[1:18:37] josh is back there now i don't have
[1:18:39] hannah
[1:18:40] but they're not going to stop me from
[1:18:41] coming to church
[1:18:43] because you know what the first time you
[1:18:44] stay out because they're standing in
[1:18:45] your in your living room they're going
[1:18:46] to go aha
[1:18:48] mama you ain't got what you think you
[1:18:50] got
[1:18:51] aha daddy you ain't got what you think
[1:18:53] you got
[1:18:54] don't tell me the devil don't work in
[1:18:56] your kids come on somebody
[1:18:59] and he that taketh not his cross
[1:19:02] and followeth after me is not worthy of
[1:19:04] me see he went before yes
[1:19:06] he was the stature of a perfect man one
[1:19:09] man
[1:19:10] but now he's calling us to be that same
[1:19:12] stature so we're following after him
[1:19:14] following with what not his cross his
[1:19:17] cross done away with your sins this is
[1:19:20] talking about a live life yes
[1:19:23] he defined us his life shall lose it and
[1:19:26] he that loses his life for my sake shall
[1:19:29] find it luke 9 23 says and he said unto
[1:19:31] them all if any man will come after me
[1:19:34] let him deny himself
[1:19:36] and take up his cross
[1:19:38] daily amen
[1:19:40] daily
[1:19:42] and follow me
[1:19:44] listen if y'all don't have any trouble
[1:19:46] on monday or tuesday
[1:19:48] call me i'd like to give you some um one
[1:19:50] of my beans
[1:19:54] i wouldn't do it for the world you know
[1:19:55] i wouldn't do that
[1:19:58] first corinthians 15 it says i protest
[1:20:00] by your rejoicing which i have in christ
[1:20:02] jesus our lord not in anything else
[1:20:05] i die daily
[1:20:07] amen
[1:20:08] daily
[1:20:09] daily something's got to die
[1:20:14] now listen to this in smyrna church
[1:20:16] everybody all right
[1:20:20] let's read we've read this romans 8
[1:20:22] verse 17 and if children then heirs
[1:20:24] heirs of god this is brother branham
[1:20:25] talking in the smyrna church age
[1:20:28] if children then heirs heirs of god and
[1:20:30] join heirs with christ if so be that we
[1:20:32] what suffer with him
[1:20:34] not going to vacation not going to
[1:20:35] cruise ship all right
[1:20:37] that we may be also glorified together
[1:20:40] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:20:41] present time are not worthy to be
[1:20:43] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:20:45] revealed in him
[1:20:47] that's not what it says
[1:20:49] what shall we revealed in us
[1:20:53] brother brown now that's the end of that
[1:20:54] scripture listen brother brown says
[1:20:56] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:20:57] reign with him you have to suffer to
[1:20:59] reign
[1:21:00] the reason for this is that character
[1:21:03] simply is never made without suffering
[1:21:08] character is a victory
[1:21:10] not a gift
[1:21:12] a victory
[1:21:13] not a gift
[1:21:15] a man without character can't rain wha
[1:21:18] what is rain that means you rule over
[1:21:20] something
[1:21:21] you rule over your
[1:21:22] self-will you rule over your
[1:21:25] your earthly knowledge your earthly
[1:21:27] temperance that's why i'm talking about
[1:21:28] renewing your mind
[1:21:30] your mind says i can get mad at somebody
[1:21:33] because they're mad at me
[1:21:36] amen
[1:21:37] hello somebody
[1:21:39] i cannot give this person something
[1:21:41] because they not giving me nothing
[1:21:45] hello somebody
[1:21:47] i i don't have to be kind to this
[1:21:49] brother cause he don't like me
[1:21:52] or he don't agree with me he said
[1:21:53] something so i don't have that's the way
[1:21:56] your natural mind is thinking
[1:21:59] but renewing of your mind
[1:22:01] brother brown said put yourself in his
[1:22:03] place
[1:22:05] i heard a preacher one time it's true
[1:22:07] you see somebody's having a bad day do
[1:22:10] we want to just stomp them and hang them
[1:22:12] maybe they're going through a trial
[1:22:16] right
[1:22:17] that's why i'm going to say it all right
[1:22:19] everybody with me wake up for a minute
[1:22:21] listen to this this is going to be a
[1:22:22] moment of teaching
[1:22:25] everybody with me
[1:22:27] when you go to a restaurant bride of
[1:22:29] jesus christ
[1:22:33] donny don't look down
[1:22:35] listen to me bride of jesus christ you
[1:22:37] go to a restaurant neat that woman or
[1:22:39] man is waiting on you that's their job
[1:22:43] hey ma'am
[1:22:45] whether they do a good job or a bad job
[1:22:48] they may be having a bad day
[1:22:50] maybe you ought to slip them an extra
[1:22:51] five dollar bill
[1:22:53] i've seen something i've not seen y'all
[1:22:55] but i've seen people message people go
[1:22:57] to go to a restaurant and get a whole
[1:22:59] table full of people and walk out and
[1:23:01] never put a dime down
[1:23:03] for for a tip
[1:23:04] that's horrible
[1:23:06] that's pitiful that's right
[1:23:09] that ain't somebody ain't got some of
[1:23:10] this right here
[1:23:11] [Applause]
[1:23:15] i tip 20 whatever if you give god 10
[1:23:18] give her 20.
[1:23:20] because she's doing or he is doing you a
[1:23:22] service whether it was good bad or
[1:23:24] indifferent
[1:23:25] because remember don't tip because of
[1:23:28] them doing a good job you tip because
[1:23:31] they're a human being and they may be
[1:23:32] going through a rough time and you know
[1:23:34] what you may be going through a rough
[1:23:36] time you know what god's going to go
[1:23:37] he's going to go you remember that
[1:23:40] this is going to be a teaching this is
[1:23:42] going to be teaching moment for you
[1:23:44] i'm not going to give you 20 i'm going
[1:23:46] to give you none you're gonna get up
[1:23:48] from that table empty
[1:23:50] you say oh no way he's not like that yes
[1:23:52] he is
[1:23:54] he's a daddy
[1:23:56] he's corrective
[1:23:57] he lets you go through things because he
[1:23:59] wants you to build
[1:24:00] character characters of victory
[1:24:04] listen thank god boy where are you at
[1:24:08] thank god
[1:24:10] he don't turn desk over anymore
[1:24:14] we've said this before he don't care he
[1:24:15] don't mind
[1:24:16] he's not gonna get mad
[1:24:18] might have before might have might have
[1:24:20] a long time ago but he used to tell
[1:24:22] about that he had such a temporary you
[1:24:24] know
[1:24:25] flip a desk over you know what the only
[1:24:27] problem with that is he beat a he
[1:24:31] somebody was doing something with a cell
[1:24:32] phone one time and his family
[1:24:35] jeffrey i don't know if it was
[1:24:36] lame is laughing so she knows so boyd
[1:24:38] gets mad at the whole family takes the
[1:24:40] cell phone out in the parking lot and
[1:24:42] beats it up with a shovel
[1:24:47] now listen y'all are going i've never
[1:24:49] done that
[1:24:51] it's never happened to me blessed
[1:24:52] brother boyd bless his heart no it's
[1:24:55] happened every one of us if you didn't
[1:24:56] do it you sure wanted to
[1:24:59] a man
[1:25:01] all right so
[1:25:02] but he's got a victory over that
[1:25:05] he don't do that anymore
[1:25:09] far as i know common more meat than he's
[1:25:11] ever been
[1:25:12] right
[1:25:14] that's a victory
[1:25:15] that's a change of character that what
[1:25:18] his mind is still sure babbling oh if
[1:25:20] you just kick that wall you know what if
[1:25:22] you if you beat a cell phone up you just
[1:25:25] gotta go buy another one
[1:25:28] you just wasted eight hundred dollars
[1:25:31] on a good one
[1:25:32] right
[1:25:33] so you look down you go why not do that
[1:25:39] you you punch a wall and you put a hole
[1:25:41] in it guess what you gotta have to
[1:25:42] either pay to have it fixed or fix it
[1:25:44] yourself
[1:25:45] right amen
[1:25:47] so renewing of our mind now we gotta get
[1:25:50] over here and do like brother brown said
[1:25:52] you know count one two three four five
[1:25:53] six seven eight nine ten or do whatever
[1:25:55] you know
[1:25:56] but get the character of jesus christ
[1:25:58] and that really will help you
[1:26:01] everybody all right with them hey man
[1:26:04] we've all come through listen we live
[1:26:05] together we know about each other don't
[1:26:07] we boy
[1:26:08] i'm brother we we know about each other
[1:26:10] and we can say that
[1:26:14] but listen it's something we've all been
[1:26:15] through i just know he's been through it
[1:26:17] because i've experienced it with him
[1:26:19] but some of you well you're a little
[1:26:20] hiding a little center you
[1:26:26] [Applause]
[1:26:28] i don't know what i cannot believe boyd
[1:26:30] did that
[1:26:34] find you all your stories i'd be going i
[1:26:36] don't know why the world they did that
[1:26:38] either
[1:26:39] but character is a victory
[1:26:42] there's victory in that you know where
[1:26:44] that victory is that is power
[1:26:48] that's power over that thing because you
[1:26:50] know what it had power over you that's
[1:26:52] right
[1:26:53] that's what we're trying to get rid of
[1:26:55] because look power
[1:26:58] apart from character there you go
[1:27:01] it's satanic
[1:27:03] make you put a hole to a wall like that
[1:27:05] make you throw your cell phone out the
[1:27:06] window
[1:27:08] right
[1:27:11] but power
[1:27:12] with character
[1:27:14] is fit to rule
[1:27:16] that's what we want
[1:27:18] we know that god's ruling over us but
[1:27:20] you know what we're supposed to rule and
[1:27:21] reign over the earth how are we going to
[1:27:22] do it being babies we can't we got to
[1:27:25] have what a raising up we've got to get
[1:27:28] come up a little bit higher
[1:27:30] and that's what i i appreciate all of us
[1:27:33] look
[1:27:34] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:27:36] throne
[1:27:37] yes
[1:27:38] we'll stop right here and since he wants
[1:27:40] us to share even his throne this is
[1:27:42] jesus christ this is this is the one
[1:27:43] that has a throne
[1:27:45] a dominion
[1:27:47] he owns the world
[1:27:49] he wants you to sit with him
[1:27:52] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:27:54] throne on the same basis that he
[1:27:57] overcame
[1:28:00] and it's set down in his father's throne
[1:28:02] then we have to overcome to sit with him
[1:28:05] and the little temporary suffering we go
[1:28:07] through now is not worthy to be compared
[1:28:10] to the tremendous glory that we will be
[1:28:13] revealed what in us
[1:28:15] when he comes oh what treasures are laid
[1:28:18] up for those who are willing who are
[1:28:19] willing
[1:28:23] who are willing to pick up the cross oh
[1:28:26] lord i love the cross thank you for
[1:28:27] dying for me i really don't want to go
[1:28:28] through that you don't have to son you
[1:28:30] just pick up your cross and follow me
[1:28:32] amen we don't have to get hung on the
[1:28:34] cross
[1:28:37] we just have to pick up a cross
[1:28:39] and follow him oh what treasures are
[1:28:41] laid up for those who are willing to
[1:28:42] enter into his kingdom through much
[1:28:45] tribulation
[1:28:47] let me read this right here
[1:28:50] everybody's very familiar with this i'll
[1:28:52] read this musicians come on let's stand
[1:28:55] the son of man is christ
[1:28:57] he's the one that you're feeding on
[1:28:59] you're not feeding on a man
[1:29:02] a man his words will fail
[1:29:04] but you're feeding on the unfailing body
[1:29:07] word
[1:29:08] of the son of man now who is that that's
[1:29:10] character that's that man right there
[1:29:12] that's what struck me we've read that
[1:29:13] quote many many times but now it brings
[1:29:16] home it's the part of the statue of
[1:29:17] perfect man amen
[1:29:20] it's the we're feeding on that body word
[1:29:23] that was his body that was his character
[1:29:25] he he presented his character to that
[1:29:27] body
[1:29:28] so you and i are going to do the same
[1:29:30] thing
[1:29:33] gifts of god without virtues
[1:29:35] is a stumble block to the unbeliever
