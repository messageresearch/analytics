[0:00] surgery so just keep that in
[0:04] prayer let's go to the Lord in prayer
[0:06] Lord we're so grateful to be able to
[0:07] gather around this morning and be able
[0:09] to study your word while Lord I pray
[0:10] Lord that you just set our mind in order
[0:12] to receive the things that you've got in
[0:14] store for us today Lord Open the Eyes of
[0:16] our heart Lord we pray Grant it Lord
[0:18] that you just be with us in your
[0:20] name now we're studying out in in
[0:23] Hebrews chapter 13 where where uh we got
[0:26] to the scripture where Paul's talking
[0:27] about remember them they have the rule
[0:28] over you and and really what what I'm
[0:31] kind of moving toward is just kind of a
[0:33] little brief study on um nickan ISM
[0:35] because we um we want to make sure we we
[0:38] keep that balance where it it's it's it
[0:40] it you know it's it's hard to keep a
[0:42] balance sometimes when you're studying
[0:43] out scripture you can go one way and
[0:45] you're in the gutter on that side one
[0:46] way you're in the gutter on that side so
[0:49] we want to be we want to be uh to have
[0:52] the Lord rule over us not a man's ideas
[0:55] or things so that's where you come into
[0:56] the nickan the
[0:58] nickan uh spirit and what that is now
[1:01] brother Brown said in the resume of the
[1:03] church ages or resume in the church age
[1:06] book he said the nickan doctrine was the
[1:10] corruption of the clergy as they sought
[1:13] political power amongst
[1:15] themselves and then you you follow that
[1:17] uh it kind of grows it's the same it's
[1:20] the devil moving nickan ISM balam ISM
[1:24] Jezebel moving through those different
[1:26] stages but starts out as just a little
[1:29] uh a will say in nician Doctrine was the
[1:31] corruption of the clergy as they saw
[1:33] political power amongst
[1:35] themselves while bism is the subjection
[1:39] of the people to their system of creed
[1:42] and worship in order to hold them and
[1:46] further on down in that quote he says
[1:49] nanism is
[1:51] organization humanizing the leadership
[1:54] of the church and thereby deposing the
[1:57] spirit now I got the you know a lot of
[2:00] times when we talk about nanism we
[2:02] immediately start thinking about the
[2:03] illustration of of the Catholic church
[2:06] and you know how the example brother
[2:08] Brandon would give of the um you know
[2:10] saying that the Eucharist is the literal
[2:13] Body of Christ we know that's wrong you
[2:16] think about really what the essence of
[2:18] nianis is
[2:19] nanism is
[2:21] swapping the liberty of the Holy Ghost
[2:25] swapping the Holy Ghost the leadership
[2:28] of the Holy Ghost in your life and the
[2:30] life of the church swapping that for
[2:34] what a man says swapping those two
[2:37] things instead of allowing the Holy
[2:39] Ghost Liberty in your life by the
[2:42] correct understanding of the word and
[2:44] all those things instead you're looking
[2:45] at what a man says so the the um the
[2:48] example here we've got of a man saying
[2:50] well uh the priest is going to drink the
[2:53] wine that congregation can't do it it
[2:55] all it represents that that Eucharist
[2:58] represents the literal body and blood of
[3:00] Christ and all those things are wrong so
[3:02] instead of looking at what the re true
[3:04] revelation of the word is you're looking
[3:05] at what a man says which takes away and
[3:08] remember what brother I I really enjoyed
[3:10] Tuesday night what brother Chris long
[3:11] was bringing out is that if your mind is
[3:14] is is is been transformed by the word so
[3:17] that it's in the right Avenue in the
[3:19] right channel then the Holy Ghost can
[3:22] have Liberty so if you've got the right
[3:25] teaching and the right understanding and
[3:27] you're looking at it right if you're
[3:28] looking if You' got the right
[3:30] uh if your mind is in the right gear
[3:33] then the spirit can have Liberty so you
[3:35] see why the doctrine matters the doctr M
[3:38] because the doct if the right Doctrine
[3:40] is going to it's going to give the Holy
[3:41] Ghost Liberty in the church so you can
[3:44] see where brother randam as he's
[3:45] bringing out what nickan ism is it's
[3:48] really about uh giving the Holy Ghost
[3:50] the ability to do what the Holy Ghost
[3:53] wants to do in the church now really
[3:56] really nianis is um is is it it starts
[3:59] off that Antichrist Spirit which is an
[4:01] anointed one and uh but you know you can
[4:05] um nail it down like that but all these
[4:08] little attributes of what nickan ism is
[4:10] when you study it out you know you begin
[4:12] to realize I want to stay as far away
[4:14] with any of that as I can I want to stay
[4:16] as far away from anything that would
[4:19] restrict the ability of the Holy Ghost
[4:21] to do what he wants to do in my life in
[4:25] the church in the people so look look at
[4:27] this last little statement that brother
[4:29] Ram said nanism is
[4:31] organization
[4:32] humanizing the leadership of the church
[4:36] what does that mean I I like to just
[4:38] kind of meditate on these things what
[4:40] does that mean
[4:41] humanizing the leadership of the church
[4:45] now if you kind of break that down that
[4:47] means humanizing the leadership refers
[4:50] to a shift in focus and these are just
[4:52] my notes really just uh from within the
[4:54] church from Divine or spiritual guidance
[4:56] so in other words it's swapping again
[4:58] swapping the leadership of the Holy
[5:00] Ghost to what some man says to a more
[5:03] human- centered approach in leadership
[5:04] and decision- making it's prioritizing
[5:06] human authority over Divine Guidance the
[5:09] church begins to Value the decisions and
[5:11] authority of human leaders like clergy
[5:13] or church officials over the spiritual
[5:15] and divine guidance traditionally sought
[5:18] through prayer and meditation on
[5:19] scripture or the guidance of the holy
[5:21] spirit it's organizing organizational
[5:24] Focus over spiritual humanizing the
[5:26] leadership leads to an emphasis on
[5:28] organizational structure Ure bureaucracy
[5:31] and governance potentially at the
[5:33] expense of spiritual values and
[5:36] practices starts functioning more like a
[5:38] Human Institution focused on management
[5:40] rules and hierarchy rather than a
[5:42] spiritual entity Guided by religious
[5:44] principles now now really to sum all
[5:46] this up it's we want the Holy Ghost to
[5:48] have Liberty in the church that's that's
[5:51] what it is personal power and politics
[5:54] church leaders might start to operate
[5:56] more like secular leaders seeking
[5:57] personal power engaging in political
[5:59] maneuvering or prioritizing their own
[6:01] agendas rather than serving as humble
[6:03] stewards of the church or just loss of
[6:06] of just being real having a real
[6:08] authentic spiritual experience where God
[6:11] is moving in your life and you're
[6:12] praying praying and meditating and
[6:14] reading your Bible and trusting in God
[6:16] to leave you to to lead you a decrease
[6:19] in the emphasis on personal faith prayer
[6:21] and spiritual growth as a focus turns to
[6:23] maintaining the institutional and human
[6:25] aspects of the church so what what is
[6:28] brother brandham talking about here when
[6:29] he says humanizing the leadership of the
[6:31] church it's it's just when you when you
[6:33] start shift swapping that where a man
[6:36] it's man's ideas instead of the Holy
[6:38] Ghost
[6:39] leading so now let's go back to what
[6:42] Paul's talking about in Hebrews 13 let
[6:45] Brotherly Love
[6:47] continue be not forgetful to entertain
[6:50] strangers for thereby some of
[6:51] entertained angels
[6:53] unawares remember them that are in bonds
[6:56] as bound with them and them which suffer
[6:58] adversity is is being yourselves also in
[7:00] the body marriage is Honorable in all
[7:02] and the bed undefiled but whoremongers
[7:04] and adulterers God will judge let your
[7:07] conversation be without covetousness and
[7:10] be content with such things as you have
[7:12] for he hath said I will never leave thee
[7:13] nor forsake thee so that we may boldly
[7:16] say the Lord is my helper and I will not
[7:19] fear what man shall do unto me see how
[7:23] Paul's the words that he's saying are
[7:25] molding our mind to just trust in God
[7:27] trust in the leadership of the Holy H
[7:29] ghost trust that God is going to lead us
[7:32] in the path that we should go right and
[7:35] verse seven remember them which have the
[7:38] rule over you now now let's position our
[7:40] minds not like a nickan idea where where
[7:44] it's it's not it's the whole if Paul
[7:46] said we'll get to in a moment follow me
[7:48] as also follow I follow Christ Christ is
[7:51] the one that we're following if we can
[7:53] just stay with the word stay with what
[7:55] God Said remember them which have the
[7:57] rule over you who have spoken unto you
[7:59] the word word of God there's the thing
[8:01] whose Faith follow considering the end
[8:04] of their
[8:06] conversation considering the summation
[8:08] of their life and the conclusion of what
[8:11] it means for them to have followed
[8:12] Christ that is Jesus Christ the same
[8:16] yesterday today and
[8:18] forever and what we'll get to in a
[8:20] moment is if if God was if God was with
[8:22] brother brandom if God was with brother
[8:24] Dale then he's still the same God and he
[8:27] can still do the same today for you that
[8:29] he did for them so that remember them
[8:32] that remember them which have the rule
[8:33] over you them that led you to that kind
[8:36] of Fate now now here's what brother Ram
[8:37] said about this we just kind of reminder
[8:39] what we kind of studied out last time he
[8:41] said it is the word that rules us not
[8:45] men cuz if it's men then you then you're
[8:48] going to go off into believing that the
[8:49] Eucharist is the literal body and blood
[8:51] of Christ you're going to go off and
[8:52] believing that hell is eternal and you
[8:54] got all these things that what does it
[8:56] end up doing is it is it it it prevents
[8:59] the holy ghost from being able to move
[9:02] in your life because it's false Doctrine
[9:04] and if your mind is not in alignment
[9:06] with the with the word with the true
[9:08] understanding the Holy Ghost won't be
[9:09] able to move right so what's that nickan
[9:12] Spirit doing it's preventing it's it's
[9:14] constricting the liberty of the Holy
[9:16] Ghost to move it's the word that rules
[9:19] us not men now a man as a husband is
[9:21] head of the woman he rules her but the
[9:24] church is a woman too and her ruler is
[9:26] the word Jesus is the word
[9:29] now if you really just sit on that for a
[9:31] moment and think about that that will
[9:33] give you the true understanding of how
[9:35] God rules the church any man knows that
[9:39] if his wife maybe does something that he
[9:41] doesn't agree with and you sit down I'll
[9:43] tell you I'm going tell you and you
[9:45] start trying to straighten her up like
[9:46] that you could you you'll find out real
[9:49] quick you need to approach things in a
[9:51] different way God approaches the He
[9:53] he'll straighten up the church with love
[9:56] it it's love a a correction by love not
[9:59] just telling somebody you putting your
[10:01] fist in your you you any man put his
[10:03] fist in his wife's face and say I'll
[10:05] tell you you going to line up or else
[10:09] that's not that's not the right spirit
[10:12] so that's the kind of rulership that's
[10:14] that's not the kind of rulership that
[10:16] God does with his church he he rules
[10:18] with with a a staff of love where he's
[10:21] trying to he's he's trying to he's
[10:23] trying to line us up with by pulling us
[10:25] not pushing there's three pulls not
[10:27] three pushes amen
[10:30] the church is a woman too and her ruler
[10:32] is the word Jesus is the word if she
[10:35] rejects the word and takes any other
[10:37] headship she is an adulteress and so if
[10:40] we look at the translation a lot of
[10:42] different translations of what that
[10:43] scripture means like we did last last
[10:45] week remember your leaders who spoke the
[10:49] word of God to you consider the outcome
[10:51] of their way of life and imitate their
[10:54] faith and the ESV remember your leaders
[10:56] those who spoke to you the word of God
[10:58] consider the outcome of their way of
[10:59] life and imitate their faith in the NLT
[11:03] think of all the good that has come from
[11:05] their lives and follow the example of
[11:08] their faith now think about let's
[11:11] position our mind this morning think
[11:12] about all those that great cloud of
[11:13] witnesses in Hebrews 11 and not just
[11:16] those but the great cloud of witnesses
[11:18] that you've seen in your life all the
[11:20] good preachers in the message all the
[11:22] ones down through history that you
[11:24] looked at think of the outcome in their
[11:26] life and think about Hebrews 13 if God
[11:29] was with them what about you if God was
[11:33] with them he'll be with you too if you
[11:35] can have that kind of faith that they
[11:36] did that they demonstrated in their life
[11:39] amen remember those who led you the nasb
[11:42] who spoke the word of God to you and
[11:44] considering the result of their way of
[11:46] life imitate their faith doesn't it
[11:50] doesn't it stir up Faith within you when
[11:52] you see a real Godly Christian somebody
[11:54] that's real stand Standing true in the
[11:56] face of adversity somebody like maybe
[11:58] like Ry Spencer that's got cancer but
[12:00] yet he takes all his pills in the
[12:02] morning and then he gets up behind the
[12:03] pullit and just preaches anyway and just
[12:05] don't care what the devil's do and he's
[12:07] going to do it anyway and that you look
[12:09] at somebody like that and you think well
[12:11] if he can do that what about me in my
[12:14] situation that's what this scripture is
[12:16] speaking of the whole everything that
[12:18] Paul preached is a message of
[12:20] encouragement to encourage the believer
[12:22] remember the way the outcome of these
[12:24] people's life so if you look at what
[12:27] conversation means to definition in the
[12:30] Greek Lexicon manner of Life conduct
[12:34] Behavior to look at all these great
[12:36] examples we have and it builds up our
[12:38] faith brother Brown said in the works
[12:40] that I do bear witness of me he said and
[12:41] now I want to speak just a moment or
[12:44] just bring your attention to a few words
[12:45] here that Jesus said the works I do bear
[12:48] witness of me the things that I do what
[12:51] I say is what Bears record of me and
[12:54] that's what Bears record of every person
[12:57] do you know I'd rather you live me a
[12:59] sermon then preach me one it'll be a
[13:01] better evidence that you're a Christian
[13:03] isn't that right a live a sermon and
[13:06] what we are is what we live what we do
[13:08] our actions shows what we are so that's
[13:11] what Paul is talking about look at not
[13:14] just the words that came out of a
[13:16] preacher's mouth but look at the life
[13:18] the example that they portrayed for you
[13:20] and one of the greatest examples of that
[13:22] in the Bible to really get the essence
[13:23] of what this is is is that little story
[13:25] of David all of Israel was standing
[13:29] there watching as a little Shepherd boy
[13:32] that didn't amount to nothing said I can
[13:34] take on Goliath and when they saw him
[13:36] cut off that Giant's head it built up
[13:39] their faith they said if he can do it
[13:42] then we can too now that's real true
[13:45] leadership is not coming up and saying I
[13:47] don't like Saul sitting back in his tent
[13:48] I don't know if we can overcome but
[13:50] David said we can do it because God if
[13:52] God is with us then there's no devil
[13:55] that can stand against us so what are we
[13:58] doing in Hebrew 13:7 remember the
[14:00] essence of the scripture is remember and
[14:03] consider the outcome remember and
[14:06] consider the outcome of all these
[14:08] examples that have gone on before us and
[14:11] you look down Through the Ages I've got
[14:12] just some little books of all these
[14:14] great
[14:15] authors Augustine and Bon Huffer and
[14:18] Calvin and
[14:20] Luther you think of all the all the
[14:22] church age Messengers all the things
[14:24] that brother R talked about how that the
[14:25] like Martin St Martin how that his the
[14:28] word that he preached gave Liberty to
[14:31] the Holy Ghost to be able to do great
[14:34] signs and wonders in his life and the
[14:37] people in that age and in every age of
[14:40] John Wesley and each each age they could
[14:42] look at that as an example and it would
[14:44] build up their faith and encourage them
[14:46] to know that Jesus Christ is the same
[14:50] yesterday today and
[14:51] forever oh look at look at that great
[14:54] example that we've had that the pillar
[14:56] of fire was with brother brandom and you
[14:59] could I I I I like to you know you you
[15:01] sit and just listen and meditate on how
[15:04] brother bram's relationship was with his
[15:06] wife hope and how the conversation that
[15:09] he had with her on his deathbed and the
[15:11] way that he had faith and all those
[15:13] different situations and it you look at
[15:16] the outcome of their life and the way
[15:18] the manner of his conduct and it builds
[15:20] up your faith to say well if God was
[15:23] with him in those situations what about
[15:25] me if the pillar of fire was with him
[15:28] and and God we've got a promise that he
[15:30] where the word is God is that we know
[15:33] that that same Pillar of Fire is still
[15:36] with the bride is still moving with the
[15:38] word and that's what Hebrews 13:8 is
[15:41] about that that same God that was with
[15:43] brother brandham is still the same God
[15:52] today so Paul said in 1 Corinthians 11
[15:55] he said be ye followers of me even as I
[15:59] also am of Christ now that's what a lot
[16:02] of people that hear about we follow a
[16:04] prophet and things they get kind of all
[16:06] it's hard for them to understand that
[16:08] you can follow when when the word is
[16:10] being preached if it's according to
[16:13] scripture and it's by Revelation and
[16:15] it's like Shining Light on the on what
[16:17] the Bible says that you're not following
[16:19] a man you're following Christ we're
[16:23] following Christ and and we know that
[16:26] we're following Christ because Hebrews
[16:28] 138 is evident in that you follow Christ
[16:31] and and it will show Christ will show
[16:33] himself alive in your life he'll show
[16:36] himself he'll vindicate himself by signs
[16:38] and wonders following things some
[16:41] Supernatural things happening in your
[16:42] life to change your life and to to bring
[16:45] the scripture to pass in your
[16:49] life be you followers of me as also I am
[16:52] of Christ and that's what a real leader
[16:53] is because you know brother R said and
[16:55] what went you out to see he said John
[16:57] preached the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[16:58] Spirit he never preached something that
[17:00] he didn't have he preached what he had
[17:02] received and Men of God that sent into
[17:05] the fields today has no right to preach
[17:07] the gospel without the baptism of the
[17:08] Holy Spirit that's the first
[17:10] qualification of a minister is to be
[17:13] filled with the Holy Ghost and I got the
[17:15] little illustration here first before
[17:17] you preach it's like somebody in an
[17:19] airplane that's
[17:20] crashing put the oxygen MTH mask on
[17:23] yourself and then you'll be equipped to
[17:27] help somebody sitting next to
[17:29] so you have no right to preach the
[17:31] gospel until you're
[17:33] equipped for people to follow your
[17:36] example how are you going to instruct
[17:38] somebody to overcome if you yourself
[17:42] haven't overcome to begin with be you
[17:45] followers of me also I am as I am of
[17:48] Christ so remember them that have the
[17:51] rule over you in 2 Timothy 4:12 Tim
[17:54] Paul's telling Timothy Lo let no man
[17:57] despise thy youth
[17:59] but be thou an example of the Believers
[18:02] in word in conversation in charity in
[18:06] spirit and faith and
[18:08] Purity a a a Christian preacher is
[18:11] supposed to be an example uh you think
[18:14] about how the church God set up church
[18:16] so that when we come to church we're
[18:18] looking at one another's lives and we're
[18:20] actually modeling Christianity you look
[18:22] at the older the young ones look at the
[18:23] older ones and they'll oh well that's
[18:26] that's how that's what I want to be
[18:28] that's how it's supposed to be you look
[18:30] at the older ones you I want that kind
[18:32] of Purity and Holiness in my life you
[18:35] maybe maybe you hear your mom or your
[18:37] dad praying in the night and that stir
[18:39] something up in a young person I want
[18:41] that kind of a close relationship with
[18:43] God and we're modeling Christianity to
[18:45] one another so that's why a preacher a
[18:48] preacher got to be the it's the highest
[18:51] requirement of all in the church because
[18:53] the whole church is looking at you to
[18:54] model Christianity and a holy life and
[18:58] and a positive outlook for the whole
[19:01] church be thou an example of the
[19:03] Believers in Philippians he said those
[19:05] things which you have both learned and
[19:07] received and heard and seen in me do do
[19:10] it and the God of Peace shall be with
[19:13] you in Matthew 5:116 let your light so
[19:16] shine before men that they may see your
[19:18] good works and glorify your father which
[19:20] is in
[19:21] heaven let everybody see Christ
[19:24] reflected in your life and in Titus he
[19:27] said and all things showing thyself a
[19:29] pattern of Good Works what does that
[19:31] mean like a p a pattern where somebody
[19:33] can look at your life and say well
[19:34] that's that's the kind of P that's what
[19:36] I want to be we look at Hatty right and
[19:38] say I want to have that same kind of
[19:40] confession be what be it unto me
[19:41] according to Thy word like like looking
[19:43] at Mary whatever you say it's that's
[19:45] nothing but the truth and Doctrine
[19:47] showing un corruptness gravity sincerity
[19:50] sound speech that cannot be condemned
[19:52] that he that is of the contrary part may
[19:54] be ashamed having no evil thing to say
[19:57] of you
[19:59] now that's seems like a tall order to
[20:01] live a kind of close one life Oneness
[20:04] life with Christ where nobody can say
[20:07] any evil thing about you but it's
[20:10] possible in First Peter feed the flock
[20:13] of God which is among you taking the
[20:15] oversight thereof not by constraint not
[20:18] by force but willingly not for filthy
[20:21] lucer but of a ready mind neither is
[20:24] being Lords over God's Heritage but
[20:27] being in examples to the flock being
[20:30] examples examples that somebody can look
[20:32] at you and say that's what a real
[20:34] Christian is that's what I that that
[20:37] that's what I want to be even look at
[20:39] what Proverbs says train up a child in
[20:42] the way that he should go let him let
[20:45] him see observe how how others are and
[20:48] then when he gets old he he's going to
[20:50] stick with that that same path that he's
[20:53] been set on now you really think about
[20:55] what that means train up a child when he
[20:56] sees when he's sees Mom and Daddy
[20:58] praying in the in the house he's sat on
[21:02] that course when you instruct him how to
[21:04] how to read his Bible and he's young or
[21:06] or her when they get older they're going
[21:09] to be set on that course and then when
[21:11] they get older you can look back on that
[21:13] promise and claim it how how can you
[21:15] claim that though if you don't train
[21:18] them up in the way that they should go
[21:20] that's that's where we kind of get off
[21:22] kilter sometimes we don't train them up
[21:24] and then when we get when they get older
[21:25] we look back well I'm I'm going to try
[21:27] to claim that scripture but you can't
[21:29] claim it if you didn't train them up in
[21:30] the way they should go to begin with and
[21:33] when he is old he will not depart from
[21:34] it beloved follow because we're all
[21:37] following something follow not that
[21:39] which is evil but that which is good he
[21:42] that doeth good is of God but he that
[21:45] doeth evil hath not seen God so remember
[21:49] them that have the rule over you not
[21:51] like a
[21:52] nickan
[21:54] right in Ezekiel chapter 34 son of man
[21:57] prophesy against the Shepherds of Israel
[21:59] prophesy and say unto them thus sayith
[22:00] the Lord God unto the Shepherds woe be
[22:03] to the Shepherds of Israel that do feed
[22:05] themselves should not the Shepherds feed
[22:07] the flocks you eat the fat and you
[22:10] clothe you with the wool you kill them
[22:12] that are fed but you feed not the flock
[22:14] the diseased have you not strengthened
[22:17] neither have you healed that which was
[22:18] sick neither have you bound up that
[22:20] which was broken neither have you
[22:22] brought again that which was driven away
[22:24] neither have you sought that which was
[22:26] lost but with force and with cruelty
[22:29] have you ruined them oh that's what the
[22:31] gospel is when it's really preached in
[22:33] power and demonstration of the spirit
[22:34] it's a positive gospel it help somebody
[22:36] that's diseased help somebody that's
[22:38] Afflicted help somebody that's lost
[22:40] their way to pull them back to the truth
[22:42] and he said and they were scattered
[22:44] because there is no Shepherd and they
[22:45] became meat to all the Beast of the
[22:47] field when they were
[22:49] scattered in Matthew Jesus said but
[22:52] Jesus called unto them and said ye know
[22:54] that the princes of the Gentiles
[22:56] exercise de dominion over them and they
[23:00] that are great exercise Authority upon
[23:02] them now remember what we're talking
[23:03] about remember them to have the rule
[23:05] over you we we want to get our minds
[23:07] aligned to what this is really
[23:09] representing not to have dominion over
[23:11] one another not to you know have our
[23:14] thumb on one another but to be examples
[23:17] to to rule with with with with that kind
[23:19] of Christian love where a a good godly
[23:21] man will will try to rule over his house
[23:23] and his wife but it shall not be so
[23:27] among you to have exercise dominion and
[23:30] authority and those kind of things it
[23:32] shall not be so among you but whosoever
[23:34] will be great among you let him be your
[23:36] minister and whosoever will be Chief
[23:38] among you let him be your servant even
[23:42] as the son of man came not to be
[23:44] ministered unto but to minister and to
[23:46] give his life a ransom for
[23:50] many and in 1 Peter 5:3 neither is being
[23:54] Lords over God's Heritage but being an
[23:57] example to the flock examples to lead to
[24:01] not to drive but to
[24:03] pull in uh in the Greek Lexicon that
[24:06] scripture says it the the the meaning of
[24:08] that word is to to lead to go before to
[24:11] be a leader to rule command to have
[24:13] authority over a prince leading as
[24:15] respects influence controlling and
[24:17] counsel overseers or leaders of the
[24:20] church to used of any kind of a leader
[24:23] so what's the scripture saying remember
[24:25] your leaders and the consequen of their
[24:28] faith in God and we're closing here in
[24:31] just a moment we go back to that
[24:34] scripture that quote that brother Ram
[24:35] said it is the word that rules us yes
[24:38] not men that's right now A man is a
[24:40] husband is head of the woman he rules
[24:42] her but the church is a woman too and
[24:45] her ruler is the word Jesus is the word
[24:49] if she rejects the word and takes any
[24:51] other headship she is an
[24:53] adulteress remember them which have the
[24:55] rule over you who have spoken unto you
[24:57] the word word of God whose Faith follow
[24:59] considering the end of their their
[25:00] conversation which is Jesus Christ the
[25:03] same yesterday today and forever and
[25:08] brother Brown would say that means he
[25:09] would act the
[25:11] same he would act the same as he did
[25:13] with those in the lives of those men
[25:15] that we're looking at if that is the
[25:17] same Spirit here as it was then it'll
[25:19] manifest the word like it did
[25:22] then there's no difference in him at all
[25:24] as a musician can go ahead and come
[25:26] forward there's no difference in him at
[25:28] all he lives in his church doing the
[25:31] same thing and he said if that is the
[25:33] same holy spirit that was in the
[25:35] wilderness with Israel and also was in
[25:38] Jesus Christ it's now in the church it
[25:42] does the same works because it's the
[25:45] same light it's the same Spirit if you
[25:49] could just believe that friend God bless
[25:52] you Saints we end on that
[25:54] [Applause]
[25:56] amen
[25:59] [Applause]
[26:12] [Music]
[26:26] okay
[26:32] oh
