TRANSCRIPT
========================================
could be in the house of the Lord we're on I know I took a step back and some of the scriptures we were almost to Hebrews 12 and I I backtracked just to kind of cover Perfection a little bit more and so we'll start reading from verse 39 and 40 this morning come on [Applause] well that's a nice surprise this morning let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we read our scripture Lord we're so grateful this morning to you for all your many blessings and and Lord we just ask for blessing as we study these things out this morning Lord certainly we know what we're relying on you for Spiritual Perfection Lord and to bring us to a place Lord we can have confidence in your word and I pray God as you're just blessed by the way that he's prepared and studying Lord bless our ears to hear Lord we ask in your name so in verse 39 it says and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise all the ones that um that that was very timely yesterday half that that sermon that brother Luke was preaching he's he's basically appreciating what we've been studying on it I was telling brother Wade yesterday pretty much everything he said was actually in my in my slides and so forth uh many of the main points that he covered so that's it's it's just amazing to see the spirit move and just line everything up just like that but we've been talking about the the cloud of witnesses in Hebrews 11 that that Paul mentions in Hebrews 12 a cloud of witnesses that we've got all these examples of our of of people that instead of looking at the circumstances they just looked straight at Christ but yet they never attained the promise that was promised to us the promise of a Holy Ghost Field of life and uh in Hebrews 12 you know Paul would go on to say we we've come to those things we've come to the to what they were just looking at and in verse 40 it says God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect and so just kind of meditate on that what is perfection and to think this morning that they're they're waiting on us that they're relying on us that they need us to come to a place of perfection and you know it where you how are you going to get perfect it's not by like brother Luke was even preaching last night where you we can't put Works before faith we put Faith before it works because it's not our works that brings Perfection but it's our faith in him the finished work in Jesus Christ that brings Perfection it's Christ it's all about Christ it's not what I am brother Brown would say in the unconditional Covenant that God made with the people it's not what I am who I am it's the Perfection of Jesus Christ and God that died in my place to make me what I am it isn't whether I can stand I can it's whether he stood in my place and he said that would make a Baptist out there's something about it that's real why is it something that's real because it's Christ that's doing the work it's Christ that uh as we were uh the last time I spoke uh just on a topic as we were studying things out that message that Intervale is Christ that takes you from a place of struggle to a place of rest because when you're resting in Christ it's him doing the work not you will say the law of having a shadow God requires perfection no one could ever come to Heaven outside of being perfect you must be perfect and yet the scripture says None is perfect so if you must be perfect to come to heaven then and the scripture says None is perfect and we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God how are we ever going to enter God's living place and Dwelling Place when he requires perfection Jesus said I believe in the sermon on the mountain he said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect think of the Perfection that God requires of the Perfection of the person of perfection and that's what Hebrews 11 verse 40 says that they without us should not be made perfect Hebrews 10 said for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers and they're into perfect so those Believers in that great cloud of witness Witnesses in Hebrews 11 they could never come to this Perfection the law could never bring you to a perfect what Perfection perfection in Christ where he's not looking at you anymore he's looking at himself he's looking at what he's done and you he's looking at his life he's looking at his blood he's looking at the the Perfection when God looks at himself how can you find like like Paul said how can you hold anything to the charge of God's elect if God has filled your heart with the Holy Ghost and God is residing there how can you how can you hold anything to the charge of somebody that's been made perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have no more conscience of sins that's what the Holy Ghost does it changes you changes the way that you think it changes the way you are to make you like Christ and the message identification it said his sinless nature expressed God's word and the only way that you will ever be able to express God's word that you believe it and watch it act behind you you will have to have that sinless nature that come from God before the foundation of the world you must recognized with him before the word can ever express itself through you it takes a sinless nature to do that what kind of what kind of nature the nature of Christ that God can give you his nature so that you're you become from somebody that wants to fight and stew and and rail to a meat little lamb nature and what in the message identification he said that don't mean perfection in yourself you can't be that but you see even our people are getting away from the practice of Holiness we begin to let down so many bars see we come to we got to come to that place of our profession he is our example and he is our sin Bearer and then if we profess that he is our Peacemaker he is our propitiation then if we profess that then that is supposed to reflect him back in US oh you see why the the word that you hear is actually accomplishing something in your life as you you're you're born by the word and that produces the Life of Christ in your soul but as you continue to eat the word it's like looking in a mirror until you become more and more and more like Christ and what is it doing it's not you it's not your Perfection it's Christ's Perfection the way you look in the mirror and and it's it's Christ's Perfection being reflected back because now where you used to act like the world you're behaving and thinking and walking like Christ it's Christ that's on this place so where is your Perfection come from Christ not from your own works not from the from the lies of the devil or the things of this world but from Christ the word is actually bringing you to a place of perfection and just some little thoughts that I just put some nuggets that I pulled out of different things that brother Ram said he said it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there and he said Perfection come by Jesus Christ and another place he said he has perfected forever those that are Sanctified or cleaned by the Holy Spirit then we are in Perfection now you can see from that previous slide that Perfection is tied to Holiness because somebody that's oh Jesus ain't going to have nothing to do with an Unholy life you've got to be Sanctified before just a little baby form Sanctified sanctification before God can even Tabernacle himself and your soul because God will not dwell in an unclean vessel so Perfection is tied to Holiness and that's what this statue of perfect man is about a holy godliness and brotherly kindness and these things are a holy life and you see even that that last slide if we go back to that real quick he said people people start getting they dropping the bar away from Holiness God has called us to a holy life a separated life a life that looks different from the world he is perfected forever those that are Sanctified are cleaned by the Holy Spirit then we are in Perfection God's Great Holy Spirit he said in another place moving in the hearts of the people bringing that Eve and Adam together again in their perfection God's holiness and God's Perfection bringing us back together again where we're not thinking different we're not walking different we're not living a different way than Christ would live and as we get through some of the slides here what we're seeing but what brother Rama is trying to express to us through the scriptures that Perfection is a Oneness where God where where you can look at the bride and see Christ manifested again not something different but Christ actually veiled into your flesh again he said and then you be therefore perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect how can you be when it's not my perfection it's not your Perfection it's his Perfection of his word that he chose you you never chose him and he brought you into Christ and you are secure with Christ and just as perfect as Christ was before God but you're not standing with your own you're standing in him with one thing I believe God it's his Perfection of his word and Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother random would say Hebrews 11 said they could not be perfect without us hands and feet cannot be perfect without the brains the knowledge the head and so forth see and we're all perfected in him like brother Luke was preaching last night by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body free from judgment it's his spirit it's his life it's the life that was in the blood that makes us perfect and I'll just read through some of these quotes pretty quickly Matthew 5 48 says be perfect therefore as your heavenly father is perfect in Philippians 3 12 it says not that I have already obtained this or have already arrived at my goal but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus Took hold of me and there's Paul talking again about that race we've got to go there's a finish line that we're racing to and what's what's the Finish Line Perfection Oneness with Christ where we've oh oh you you think about her brother man would Express that sin the things that people do are attributes of sin and the the re and the reason why you do things misbehave is because you you disbelieve God's word but think about the effect that could happen if you just believed all of God's word it will change your life it will change the way that you are that's what's happening as you as you Feast on the word it's making you like Christ in first Thessalonians 5 23 may your whole Spirit now this is we talk a lot about the scripture that that Martin Luther preached on the just shall live by faith this is the the scripture that John Wesley preached on May your whole Spirit soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ because what was John Wesley preaching on us we'll get to in just a moment he's preaching the statue of a perfect man that God can sanctify your spirit and make you holy make you make you live a life that's that's been purged by the word that is being cleaned up so that your thinking is different in Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 said therefore let us move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to maturity in first John 4 18 says there is no fear in love but perfect love drives out fear perfect love and Colossians 1 28 says he is the one we Proclaim admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ in Ephesians 4 13 that we all know till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of fullness of Christ and that word perfect means full-grown adult a full measure a full-age mature so brother Rama one place he said it's a living seed it's a word of God it'll grow to its perfection so when you hear when that word has been planted in your heart it will grow and grow and grow until finally you see the bark come on it you see the leaves come out you'll see the fruit it's bearing something and that's what we're doing now I want to take a just quick look at some what some of these denominations believed about produce what about uh about perfection because I think it'll it'll be helpful the reformed calvinist View believes that you you just can't come to Perfection that there's you just you're you're born again and and you can't come to it so I'm just going to summarize these notes now Martin Luther finished he just centered on Christ finished work on the cross and they don't view sanctification as a second work of Grace so he was just focused on you're just you're Justified you're you're I know what was Martin Luther preaching on the Born Again experience that we're not born again you're not justified by faith in what the Roman Catholic Church teaches or by by uh confessing your sins to a priest or things like that but he was preaching a new birth the right way to be born again rather than seeking to Achieve Personal Perfection lutherans rely on Christ's perfect righteousness and putative Believers through faith now John Wesley took it up a second stage he taught the doctrine of Christian perfection also known as entire sanctification and this view emphasizes a second work of Grace in other words after you're born again there's more to it there's more to it that that that God can clean up your life and and and change things I'm I'm not talking about clean up like dirty living I'm talking about cleaning up the way you think so that you can love your brother so that this these things so that you can live a clean holy life what what's Perfection again we're talking about we're talking about a whole holy living holy living toward one another well you can forgive one another and really love one another this view emphasizes the second work of Grace after conversion where Believers can attain a state of perfect love and purity enabling them to live a life free from willful sin now let's see what brother Brown taught about this he said who is this and who is this Melchizedek he said now we see here plainly the complete secret of our lives in Journey and death and where we go after we die also predestination is in Plainview here now listen as we teach this closely the stages of the Eternal purpose he had and his secret has now been revealed there is still three stages to perfection just like he redeems the world same way he redeems his church and and the reason let's not lose focus of what we're talking about we're talking about that they the Hebrews 11 folks are waiting on us and so it's prudent for us to understand these things because we've got to come to Perfection they are waiting on us to come to perfection there are still three stages to Perfection just like he redeems the world same way he redeems his church he redeems the people in three stages first is justification like Luther priest now it's helpful to us for us to understand what Luther was preaching when he preached justification he wasn't just preaching about a baby form of justification Luther was born again he was born again he was preaching the right way to be born again second sanctification like Wesley preached third baptism of the Holy Ghost then comes the rapture and the Third Exodus brother Brown would say God always goes in threes he's perfect in threes you all notice my preaching it's always Threes And Sevens threes is his perfection first second and third pull I know all everything see justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost now we've got three stages here now brother Brown when he preached um uh future home the future home message I've got kind of an outline of the three stages as we're just studying these things out so that we can try to be plain in the and the and the first quote I've got here he said now the first step of justification is repentance toward God and it goes on to explain you got your sins have been chopped off what you did that your past has been chopped off but you keep going up you keep going higher you're now the second stage you are completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning as though you never did it at the beginning this is a quote from the invisible Union and the third you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it now so this first this first quote here is from the message um future home of the Heavenly bride and the second and third quotes are from the invisible Union brother Rand was saying the gods provided place of worship he said this church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the Pentecostals and go right on into the Perfection of the son of man that when husband and wife will be not different but the same person God will be so manifested into his bride his church to they will both be the same they are one now you see where we're at that's why we keep going back to this chart that brother brother Wayne's been preaching on that I'll just touched on just for a moment and you can see those three stages of perfection and what what's bringing Perfection as you eat the word it's United like just looking in the mirror the mirror of God's word as Paul will say you're feasting on the word it's but you're coming more and more like Christ and the first stage will be your new birth that you're born again and the second stage will be God is sanctifying you as you move up the statue of perfect that's what the statue of perfect man is he's cleaning you up cleansing you until finally you come to adoption where you get to a place where God really the place where God really wanted you and that is what is necessary to bring the Saints from the ground he said three is perfection the ministry come to us Perfection when it reproduced Christ again in natural amongst human beings as was predicted as it was in the days of Allah and another quote he said in the seat is not air with the shook he said now we understand also that God is perfected in threes God is perfected in three grace is five seven is completion like The World God is perfected and father son Holy Ghost that's the Perfection of the godhead now there's also in in paragraph 49 there's also three in Perfection of the steps of Grace to the church justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost that consists of the new birth just like a natural birth is typed by it which a woman gets three three steps three steps to come into Perfection with Christ and that's why Paul was saying God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect and in Hebrews chapter 6 Paul said therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance not laying in this Foundation here at the bottom but let's keep going on to perfection in Christ and first Thessalonians that said for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that that we which alive and remain in the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them once you're asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the Archangel on with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and that ties back perfectly with what Paul is saying that we've got to be made perfect so the dead in Christ will come forth from the ground this is a promise that the Lord himself will come with a message to unite us with him so to bring the Dead from the ground that because they without us shall not be made shall not be made perfect brother I'm sitting in the Statue of a perfect man he said you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and they're under Souls under the altar waiting for this church to come to his Perfection that when Christ does come and this church you see is coming smaller smaller in the minority and he said let's get the message to the dying that's what he's waiting on us to do now you think does this really drive at home to make it personal you think about all your loved ones many of us are many of the ones sitting here have lost spouses or loved ones and and to think that they are actually waiting on you I think that's really maybe a lot of fire under us that if they're waiting on us then it's prudent on us to do these things that he's incurred like Paul Paul was so encouraging if you really read Hebrews 11 and 12 and Hebrews 12 he's telling you don't give up let's run this race with with everything that's in us because and and even brother Brown would say what are we what are we doing at church for we're here for a purpose to unite to unite with Christ to see his word made manifest in us and he was brother I want to see it and and the sudden secret going away of the church he said oh what we need today is a calling together a getting ready and not depending on the preacher but you as an individual before God make yourself ready for the coming of the Lord no matter what they call you and what action they take that doesn't change God one bit God will do it just the same he's depending and waiting on us oh if we can be like those Saints in Hebrews 11 and not look at circumstances not look at other people that are maybe preaching wrong or doing wrong or living wrong but just keep our eyes right on Christ because there's he is the goal Christ is the goal to bring us to Perfection to want to be one with him and the message I knoweth that not he said what are we coming here for what are we doing are we coming here playing a game are we coming here meeting as a largest Christ can't come until that church is perfectly right he's waiting on us what's he waiting on he's waiting on a church without a spot or a wrinkle he's coming back like that story that brother random told of a little girl that got married to the to the to the meat company man that when he comes she was already waiting for him with her wedding clothes on and that's how Christ is going to come he's going to come back for a bride that has been Sanctified and cleansed and made perfect that has gone through those three stages of perfection not not because somebody made her a coaster into it because individually individually you got yourself ready individually if you go back and study out that message and Oneness brother Ram said God wanted to deal with us each individually and would draw us back into Oneness with himself individually we all have our own individual walk that we're doing it's up to you and I individually and he said and not one word or one iota that will ever fail the church will be in that shape when Jesus comes now to think about that sometimes you look around and I I know ministers get discouraged sometimes you look around and see the shape that that seems like things are in like brother Luke was preaching people leaving it doesn't seem like they have a real stake in there they don't have a stake in the ground if they're leaving I I I I was telling brother Wade I just last Sunday I preached at a church that their Pastor just a year ago left the message and we come back and I stayed overnight in Kentucky with Monica's family and they were telling me another Pastor there that's 80 years old just left the message and what is it they they just they don't they don't have they're not rooted and grounded they're not they don't have a real experience in the world because if Christ comes into your heart oh no isn't that what brother Ram taught us in the interval justification you're living by your faith and that faith can Faith Can can go away you'll lose it Saints vacation you you might believe for a little bit but then you'll stop believing but now when he gives you his faith that's permanent and if he's really given you his faith you're not going to stop her and turn around his faith is permanent my brother Adam said in the Statue of a perfect man he said you get it these people who died in here are depending and waiting on us so this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection and they're under Souls under the altar waiting altar waiting for this church to come to his Perfection that when Christ does come oh I think that should be encouraging to us this morning as we're getting ready to close now if you just if you're if you're if you've just been born again you're wondering what comes next oh there's more there's plenty more oh you can you can even discern when you hear people preaching things oh God has called us not to just preach like a little baby form like just repentance and things there's so much more when you're born again oh it just opens up the whole world of things and that's that's why that's why one of the greatest evidences that you've been born again is do you see do you see what the message is really about maybe if you're questioning if you're born again this morning one of the greatest evidences that you're born again is that the spirit of truth will lead and guide you into all truth or look back in your life and see do you really see do you really see these things that seem complex and and difficult to understand are all you are you looking at like these people that are leaving the message all do you all you see is just whether or not brother Brandon said there were ten thousand people when he uh when the light came to him on on when he as he was baptizing on the Ohio River and just all the little the little little things that just a human is going to do is that all you see or do you see Christ because the revelation of Jesus Christ is the evidence of the new birth to you and we'll stop on that God bless you [Applause] the musicians
