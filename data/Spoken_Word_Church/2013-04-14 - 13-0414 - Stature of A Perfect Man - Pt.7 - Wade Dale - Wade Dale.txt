TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all right everybody keep brother Bob in the prayer if he's preaching for uh Matthew Brown today so yeah and Tracy Cash's father died this morning oh no he just called us yesterday he's giving us a report on Daddy that he hadn't he said they told him it'd be about two months she died today I mean they you know a lot of people going home real bad shape and then the next there or two they're gone they're homicidal just like I said remember brother Bob he's keeping his Bible close handy he said oh remember him in your prayers let's turn to Hebrews 11. verse one now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it what faith the elders obtained a good report now they've obtained a good report but they didn't obtain profession they just believed they have faith for their time you say did they have Holy Ghost Faith yeah but they didn't have a new birth face we're going to talk about that maybe a little bit he said oh what's different well Luther had Faith didn't he he had faith and follow us on Holy Ghost right he had faith for his time that's right he had faith for what he could see that's right he believed that the just shall live by faith and God stabbed it and said that's it right there that's the faith I need right there at this moment I did I don't need remember I don't need the faith of one God or that right now that's God winked at the ignorance of man and the ignorance of people in denominations and things like that he wainted that but he had Faith yes faith for the time all right so these people had faith for the time Abraham had so much Faith he just believed God but he didn't have New Birth Faith because New Birth face in this hour takes you to the pure word of God nobody got that because in stages I didn't have the word and have the word to go with it they had part of it but they didn't have all of it okay so you that's what brother Brown said the little woman at the well had faith for what the time now she wasn't born again Christian but she had faith for the time and the woman at the well had faith for the time that she needed it all right Bob said all is well so just keep praying for him but look look what Abraham did Batman and he didn't have that much word yeah zero word really I mean he just had the word of God telling him straight to go do something that's why I do Abraham's the father of our faith he's the one that we're supposed to look to and say regardless of any circumstance I believe because he he looked he had plenty of circumstances but he just said okay God you said you was going to do it the problem with us is we say Okay God you said you're going to do it but I'm going to help you that's right that's our problem amen we say God I just lay it in your arms but now I'm going to help you a little bit tomorrow no I'm gonna figure this thing out for you yeah Abraham just got up and did everything God said he didn't I'm sure he laughed at one time that was a human man Abraham laughing at at something that he looked and saw impossible maybe for a split second in his Humanity but down deep inside he believed that what God Said was going to come to pass and he just walked and one day he walked right into what he saw he walked right into that and like club now we're talking a couple days ago we're talking about Abraham and Melchizedek the reason he could call him my Lord had already met him he met him on the road for the slaughter of the king right all right so he he saw the man Melchizedek right right then when he saw the three men coming he said my lord well that was the same man that told him said your name is now Abraham not Abram so he had he believed because he saw what happened in his journey he saw what happened in his life he saw what happened in the time that he was living that God was leading it and he just you know what he done he understood that it was God leading him I believe that's what Abraham he just understood God picked him God's one is going to do this God said I was going to have a baby so I'm just gonna have a baby and I'm not gonna sit all day and worry about me getting older and I'm not going to worry about me and Sarah not having relations with each other because it got worse and worse didn't get better better it got worse and worse but remember when he met God that was that was what Claude and I were talking about when he met God he knew it and then you got to know that you meet God well then he's going to call your name or change your name to Christian or change your name to adopted there's a lot of different things that you got to look at here in this age that they didn't have to look at Abraham didn't have to worry about being an adopted son of God because remember Abraham didn't do any miracles did he he didn't do a miracle one John the Baptist didn't do a miracle one but John was the greatest of the prophets and Abraham was the greatest of our faith yet not one miracle was done now God did a miracle to Abraham but Abraham physically didn't I mean not physically but spiritually he didn't raise up Lot's wife remember she turned into pill of assault but he went and got a lot he was he was looking after his brother and brother-in-law or cousin whatever it was he was looking after him right that's right but he never done a miracle in other words there was nothing done through his life that he called a squirrel into existence or that he called this one into existence or that went into existence he didn't have any of that show me the mirror show me the miracle now God did a miracle to Abraham in his whole life and we look back at Abraham and we see that it's a miracle every day that he walked that's right but he didn't see it I don't believe until he come to a place to where he woke up that morning and his body was changed that was the realization that now I can produce that child physically I'm talking about physically spiritually he produced it brother Brown said he started buying the booties in the bird eye 25 years later earlier spiritually he was ready for it see that's the way when you and I spiritually we may be ready for something that's right but now this part right here works on you say physical yeah it works on the physical part again because it's your spirit in your in your body your soul should be renamed your soul should be put into place but if your spirit and your body is is what's controlling and it is sorry your spirit and your body controls your soul 90 of the time that's right laughs that's right it controls you 90 of the time because we live in this world that's right we're not all hey if all y'all are living in in some spiritual realm 90 of the time I want to walk with you just for about a day we'll find out whether you are or not whether you think that's what that is or not you understand what I'm saying so let's just be real that's right that 10 of the time we walk in a realm of God 90 we walk in the realm of spirit and body because the body really does nothing but what the spirit tells it to do right if motive it's the motivator to tell the body what to do all right so we're dealing with the soul of man now we come to a place where brother Ram said the soul is born again we know that because Peter says we are sitting in Heavenly places where the Bible does in Christ Jesus and then Peter tells us says having Divine this divine nature add to that right in other words add to your faith right so faith is a revelation it's a substance it's something that you have now that's not like what Abraham had in the degree you hear me in the degree it's the same Holy Ghost but Abraham was not a cleansed Son of God sorry his soul was still black if it wasn't black he was a born-again Son of God and though we there's none of those in the New Testament Jesus had all that with him when he came here that's right Old Testament because Jesus the death of the testator that's why I had to be a new testament he said a new testament in my blood because he held that Holy Ghost right that's what he said he was I and my father are going to come back the comforter so he knew he was the Holy Ghost but he had it all bottled up inside of it and then he had to release that life when he died that's why Christ had to come now when he come and released that life he brought Abraham in all those Old Testament Saints because they had faith good faith for their time because I want you to read now look at all these people that have just tremendous Faith all right but look over here go to the verse 38. this is explaining of whom the world was not even worthy for them to be here that's how great God thought of them what all these people in the Old Testament get in Barack it tells you all of them Isaacs Abraham Moses Joseph you hear me but now watch verse 39. and these all having obtained a good report to Faith a good report receive not the promise now in my Bible I put an arrow close to buy close by it and I wrote New Birth because that's what it is they did not receive the new birth they are not or ever will be sons of God as far as a lineage of God everybody understand that say amen amen if not say oh man right you don't know but do you understand that because they can't have the Holy Ghost in their soul there was nothing to burn it out they were still under bulls and goats which covered it it covered their sin until Christ come to not just cover it but do away with it but they were already dead you can't see see how Catholicism can work here even if you even in the message of the hour the people it's a lot of people in a message I've had discussions well argument discussion argument whatever they said that that the people in the Old Testament had a new birth just like we did no way people no way the Bible says no I say no because of my confession and the way I see it and God says no he said right here receive not the promise I ain't gonna go past that well so yeah and even brother Brandon well even the Bible calls Abraham a friend of God no son of God right that's right when you said that like like art never will be friends nope never will be they will never be Sons and Daughters of God they never will be brave find me one quote where brother random called Abraham a Son of God I don't think there's one find me one quote in the Bible where they said Abraham was a Son of God had not died so the people in the Old Testament could not have gotten the new birth or like like we did because Jesus hadn't died yet peace what peace what other words okay listen what happened was in the old in the in the Old Testament if you read back where it gives you the lineages it's in Luke or Matthew one of the two there was only one son of God in the Old Testament and that was hit Adam because Adam was imparted eternal life in the garden his soul was given eternal life in the Garden of Eden because you know why he was Christ right okay he was the one that was going to produce all the children down through time that were born the right way everybody understand that but what happened was Satan took the Beast saw the natural act could be produced so he just blocks it well from then on God cannot bring anything clean through something unclean so Eve's womb was polluted that's why the serpent sea is not just sex it's everything that is involved in this message absolutely he gave him that and Eve was inside of them so she got it too yeah okay so that was the only way that God was going to bring me and you Sons and Daughters of God kids lineage Offspring that's the way we were supposed to come but when Satan did what he did he didn't he didn't he didn't uh destroy the plan of God he just cut it off for a little while he just took where God couldn't go any further because remember God cursed the ground and that's where our bodies were God curse the ground so no further so what did he do he took that book The Prophet said he took the book what is the book the book of names of the Eternal not every name but the Eternal part of the book the Lamb's Book of Life Abraham I mean Adam was going to be able to produce that but when I stopped God took the book back titled D he took the book back so you and I couldn't be born that way and he held that book all the way till he was born a baby and who he was born a baby that Holy Ghost came in that baby called Jesus you didn't have to receive something to be God he was God that's right okay he wasn't he was another person I don't understand that but people in the message the same way they preach the same thing that Jesus was just a man until God indwelled him I don't know the Bible says he was born Emmanuel God With Us so I was born god with us so they're not a part of the adoption they're not going to be able to all of them live inside the city like daddy's been talking about you only got inside that City you got 144 000 units which is the 144 000 that's going to give their life when we leave right and the bride that's it Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph and all them may have a position somewhere because they're Patriarchs but the rest of these others even Moses gonna have to live outside the city he can't live inside that City because he's not family but the New Testament that's correct the New Testament you will but let's take in the Old Testament people in the Old Testament will not be living inside that City that future home is just for the bride and 144 000 period now they can come in but they got to go out they're gonna live outside the city and be eternal but when Moses died he did not have eternal life and his soul when Abraham died he did not have eternal life in his soul so that we're born again so to me that's very simple okay no you got the two cities right that's why I'm gonna do a I'm gonna do a thing and I'm gonna help they're going to help me do a PowerPoint presentation of what what's in the Millennium and what's in the future home because remember Daddy hit it kind of class he said there's certain things can be here that's not here well in the city down here in the Millennium yes the fifth seal Jew that's just going to be their natural City but now the future home is let me explain I can explain more yesterday the Millennium we're just there as bystanders just let's just do it humanly just plain you and I are going to the Ball Game and we're going to sit and stand spectacles the Millennium is only to the Jews it's promised to the Jews to have the son of David sent on the throne in a temple a city there's going to be a City built over there a physical City and somebody's going to build it everybody understand that yeah the Bible says they'll build houses and inhabit that's not future home totally separate John 14 is the future home Jesus said I'd go to prepare a place John didn't see the city coming down in people building it was already finished because that's where you and I are going to live see that's the difference no that fulfilled you from my understanding he's gonna have to live outside the city because he was given eternal life later on for something else to show the grace of God but but as far as I'm reading what brother Brown says 144 000 will be units to the bride servants attendance inside the city and you and I are the only people who's going to live in the city it was built the future home was built just for the bride that's what I was trying to say yesterday to brother Mark the the Millennium is not actually we have no connection to the Millennium at all we don't we come riding back in the millennium the Jews are building the Temple the Jews are doing the worship the Jews are doing this and somebody's going to live a thousand years we're already eternal we're not going to prove that the Thousand-Year curse is over we prove it here okay okay we prove it here because we are impart in eternal life in our soul part of God everybody got that everybody got that but they're not they have to be given eternal life as an impartation they're giving eternal life and they live in a millennium and there's going to be people living in a millennium that's not Eternal gotta be that Heathen that's raised up somehows gotta have the gospel preached to them somehow the even the Bible says the child will die 100 and you hear all that that's not future home that's a millennium because the future home when that thing's done is sealed it's finished when that City comes down see even in the Millennium you got the devil still around he's not up here where we are but he's around he's bounded he's bound but he's around he's alive his little imps or his little spirits are not going to affect us but they're going to be still alive because remember like Dan said it's doggie May dogs they're going to be raised up they're gonna make an army somehow and try to destroy it it's not going to happen right but in a future home you don't have none of that fighting and and building houses and no that's all done the future home then the future home turns and it's to the bride period and the 144 000 as the units to the city never understand that see so this really we have nothing to do with the Millennium we're just there as a spectator watching the ball game and The Spectator does not produce the outcome of the game we're just there to watch it we'll partake and enjoy though never mind yeah we're no we're gonna have some we're gonna have some things to to do but it's not going to be it's not going to be things pertaining to a thousand years because that's what millennium is is to prove that the sin curse is over so if somebody's got to live a thousand years well like I said before when me and you leave this earth when our bodies change and we're made Eternal here our thousand here is over we're in eternity if you'll go back and want and listen and or read the future home brother random explains it watch him see because the seventh day the seventh Church age goes all the way through the millennium now I know he said the church age is over but you watch him he said that seventh day day time goes all the way through the Millennium because we're still in time days and nights and days and nights and days and nights all over the world things are going to be growing there's going to be a lot of different stuff the wife said seven years absolutely but watch but they said well now brother around you run out of your tires remember when he was talking about the future home he said you run out of your times you only got seven sevens is 49. do you believe on a 50. he said no I have not and he went back to Leviticus 20 something I can't remember what it is now I've just read it just the other day somewhere in there remember it calls an eight day holy convocation on the eighth day which is not an eighth day of the week it's the first day so it's a big circle it's eternity seven days goes just like this but when you put the Eighth Day in it just keeps going like that there's not a night day of the week God always said you think brother Brown talked about the Beatles being spiritual what was one of their what was one of their songs back in the 60s eight days a week they picked up on that spirit and produced a song eight days a week now everybody will be singing it all day long Lord forgive us all but no you see that and just like Clark was talking about The Fifth Dimension singing The Age of Aquarius that's Spirit hey it's not just foreign they get a piece of it they don't get any of it as far as spirituality but what what did Satan do he just Twisted it just a little bit so the eighth day was the future home because when that City comes down and Revelation 21 that John saw everything's old remember brother Brown said Time and Eternity Blends together we're going to be in time right up till that future home comes down yeah it's gonna be in time just because we leave and go out here doesn't mean time no that's the old Sabbath day the Millennium is still in the seventh day when God rested that seventh day that's still seven days all the way to the white Throne judgment then when all the judgment is over then brother Brown said time will blend into eternity all right but see time Blends me into Eternity for us here right now you're living in the Eighth Day in your soul your body's still living in the seventh day is that too much for everybody but I mean it's simple for them for a lot that's been here forever Daddy's Chris on it for 30 years I just have one question about future home only the people who have received Christ the Messiah while they were living can that's correct cities but they accept the Messiah before they die that's correct but see they that these people in the Old Testament died they died with a good report see it said you know not changing the Bible said and these all haven't obtained a good report through faith so they had a good report when they died they believed in God and see they didn't get the seals and the plagues and the bowels and the okay what time for it right but what they believed what God said they believed it that's right you know it's like Trudy said what about Abraham Abraham didn't have a study book to go by and say okay like we're studying now how to live and how to do things right he didn't have one though he just lived his life he didn't have a library to go to or he couldn't press play and to be honest with you up until about 50 or 60 years ago nobody else did either I mean you had Bibles and study books but you didn't have the message or the hour to pull us in the right direction that's why then in verse 40 says God having provided some better thing for us what is that some better thing when you birth to be a son and daughter of God a total lineage of the Almighty when the Bible says follow me into regeneration what does regeneration mean you've heard me preach on it it's regening you you were gened by your parents you understand genetics you were gened by your parents I was Gene by Mom and Daddy this thing you see here but if I'm born again inside that was regime from above right that's why Jesus said you must be born from above right that's right what he was saying was he was saying you need to be redeemed because your genetics is going to kill you that's right your natural genetics we're going to the ground but if you've got spiritual genetics if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you what is that that's the genetics of the almighty that's the genetics of God that's not a like substance the new birth is not a life substance of God that's right it is the substance of God faith is the substance of things old for that's right that's why when you read second Peter you've got to have the new birth first that new birth changes your thinking it regenerates or regains you into a way where you can understand what your family is talking about because Dad's your family member Rodeo any preacher Any teacher any Minister that's your family member and they're telling you the part that you don't know about your family they are telling you the part that you don't know about your family everybody got that it's pretty simple but it's the truth that's what he's doing and look at the population uh just what sister um Braden was there a while ago um we have an advantage that they did not have because they came before us we had the advantage to learn what they knew remember what I read last Sunday about they were given to us for examples to whom the ends of the world's come upon see we can look back to them and and look at the trail that they Blaze and see that Abraham made mistakes and Isaac made mistakes and Jacob made mistakes and all these other people made mistakes they characterize that with our life examples yeah but now remember you've got to bring it up higher too that Esther wasn't exact was not an example she was the person right when we got to the end of that into the scripture reading she had all power and authority where was the king his name wasn't even mentioned in the last chapter it was Astra Mordecai Aston Mordecai extra Mordecai so where did all that come well that comes like sister um Regina said that comes with the adoption that comes with real quick before we go we're never gonna get into these virtual games but look if we build faith we will yes if we build faith in who we are we'll get to adding the virtues let's get let's get Faith of where we are now all right so let me get my thought back what were we talking about adoption adoption all right adoption means Authority right that means that God has said okay you can handle it just like we were talking about Jonas he can he has everything he needs to grab a car even the dirty riches he has everything he needs to drive a car but what does he have he's not responsible enough so we as adults we as the father got it I'm giving you a good example me as the father I say he can't drive the car because I can't if I give him that responsibility he can't handle it all right Abraham Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph now they were son now he's a son he's a Canada he's a Canada yeah right okay but I'm not going to give him my full Authority yet he's still a son so being a son in the in the New Testament being babies in Christ that's what God does and even in the Old Testament he said hey what he's saying in the Old Testament he's saying just like this right here they have all obtained a good report through faith all right so that's what God was looking at they believed in God and that was it now God could not listen to me God could not give them the keys to the car yes because they were not they were irresponsible look at all the irresponsibility in the Old Testament David a man after God's Own Heart but he murdered his best friend now with the new birth he'd never done that that's true he commanded adultery with his best friend's wife that he had killed right and there was a lot of things that David did that you can't understand but if he had a new birth he wouldn't have done that so I see in the Bible two examples one example the way we're supposed to live and another example of people that had had that had God but they were not responsible enough to do what he said right but now in the New Testament that's what these virtues and all are for is to bring a group of people that's all ready a little bit responsible because we are in the family of God and now God's ready to say hey you can take more because I'm going to give you more there's more availability for you to have so I'm going to give you more okay all right so let's go it's time to go we'll pick this up next Sunday thank you whoa
