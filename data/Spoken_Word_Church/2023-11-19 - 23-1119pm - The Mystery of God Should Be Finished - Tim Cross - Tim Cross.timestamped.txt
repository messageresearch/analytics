[1:45] Lord I'm so
[1:48] blessed amen amen this time we'll have
[1:51] Zack and L come up for their
[1:58] special
[2:28] for
[2:41] um brother Michael asked us to sing this
[2:44] today um and I know that I've probably
[2:49] saying this a billion times but um I
[2:53] personally feel like this song is almost
[2:56] like my personal
[2:57] testimony um
[3:00] because anytime I feel like my faith is
[3:03] really low or like I'm kind of stuck in
[3:06] a pit and I don't think I'm going to get
[3:08] out um This song reminds me
[3:11] that God tells me that if he
[3:16] can um if he can walk on the water when
[3:19] he was on Earth and speaking to the wind
[3:22] and it and it hushes and it obeys him
[3:25] then there isn't much you know anything
[3:27] too big that I that I can ask him that
[3:29] he won't be able to do
[3:31] um and just to share share a quick verse
[3:33] with you at the end of John
[3:36] 21 um it says that there's so many so
[3:39] many other things that Jesus did when he
[3:41] was on Earth that if each one were
[3:42] written down the world itself couldn't
[3:45] contain the books that that would have
[3:46] to be written so what's a what's a small
[3:50] request from us when our faith is low so
[3:53] I hope this song is a blessing to you
[3:55] like it is for
[3:58] me see now I need a

[15:26] and be glorified and honored in and all
[15:28] that is said and done we ask it in the
[15:31] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[15:33] Jesus Christ amen amen let's read Acts
[15:36] chapter 26 and beginning at verse number
[15:40] six I actually need to find it myself
[15:46] here acts 6 uh excuse me Acts 26
[15:51] beginning verse 6 and Paul I I re I
[15:53] realized looking through acts this
[15:55] afternoon there's three different
[15:57] accounts of Paul's conversion and this
[16:00] was probably the last time he shared it
[16:02] before King Agrippa and he he was saying
[16:05] here he said and now I stand and am
[16:07] judged for the hope of the promise made
[16:10] of God un to our fathers unto which
[16:12] promise our 12 tribes instantly serving
[16:15] God day and night hope to come for which
[16:19] Hope's sake King Agrippa I am accused of
[16:22] the Jews why should it be thought a
[16:25] thing incredible with you that God God
[16:28] should raise the dead I verily thought
[16:31] with myself that I ought to do many
[16:33] things contrary to the name of Jesus of
[16:36] Nazareth which thing I also did in
[16:39] Jerusalem and many of the Saints did I
[16:41] shut up in prison having received
[16:44] Authority from the chief priest and when
[16:46] they were put to death I gave my voice
[16:48] against them and I punished them of in
[16:51] every synagogue and compel them to
[16:53] blaspheme and being exceedingly mad
[16:56] against them I pers cuted them even unto
[17:00] strange cities whereupon as I went to
[17:02] Damascus with authority and commission
[17:05] from the chief priest at midday O King I
[17:09] saw in the way a light from above above
[17:13] the brightness of the sun shining round
[17:15] about me and them which journeyed with
[17:17] me and when we were all Fallen to the
[17:20] earth I heard a voice speaking unto me
[17:23] and saying in the Hebrew tongue Saul
[17:27] Saul why persecutest thou me it is hard
[17:32] for thee to kick against the Pricks and
[17:35] I said who art thou Lord and he said I
[17:39] am Jesus whom thou persecutest but rise
[17:43] and stand upon thy feet I remember there
[17:46] was an angel that met Daniel that
[17:48] changed his position amen amen and here
[17:52] is someone meeting Saul and striking him
[17:55] to the ground but then changing his
[17:58] position position again but rise stand
[18:01] upon thy feet for I have appeared unto
[18:05] thee for this purpose to make thee a
[18:08] minister and a witness both of both of
[18:12] these things which thou Hast seen and of
[18:15] the things in the which I will appear
[18:18] unto thee delivering thee from the
[18:20] people and from the Gentiles unto whom I
[18:24] unto whom now I send thee to open their
[18:27] eyes and to turn them from Darkness to
[18:30] light and from the power of Satan unto
[18:33] God that they may receive forgiveness of
[18:37] sins uh among forgiveness of sins and
[18:41] inheritance among them which are
[18:43] Sanctified by faith that is in
[18:47] me whereupon oh King agria I was not
[18:50] disobedient unto the heavenly vision but
[18:52] showed first unto them of Damascus and
[18:55] Jerusalem throughout all the coast of
[18:57] Judea and then to to the Gentiles that
[18:59] they should repent and turn to God and
[19:02] do Works meet for repentance for these
[19:05] causes the Jews caught me in the temple
[19:08] and went about to kill me having
[19:10] therefore obtained help of God I
[19:13] continue unto this day witnessing both
[19:16] to small and great saying none other
[19:18] things than those which the prophets and
[19:21] Christ did say should come that Christ
[19:23] should suffer and that he should be the
[19:25] first that should rise from the dead and
[19:28] should show light unto the people and to
[19:30] the Gentiles it's a lengthy reading but
[19:33] you can be seated this evening I want to
[19:36] I want to continue on the prevailing
[19:38] power of Revelation but I want to title
[19:42] uh tonight's message that uh the mystery
[19:47] of God should be finished remember uh
[19:52] Revelation is me is is it's from the
[19:55] Greek word
[19:57] apocalypse which which is the
[19:59] unveiling or is the revealing of
[20:02] something that was previously a mystery
[20:06] amen and so um I want to just go right
[20:09] in because I've got a number of things
[20:11] uh and I I read paraphrase this quote
[20:14] this morning but um the prophet of God
[20:18] says this or this is from the church
[20:20] ages book he says now remember this
[20:23] Christ in the true church is a
[20:26] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[20:30] Book of Revelation shows how that the
[20:32] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[20:34] church and defile it making it lukewarm
[20:38] formal and Powerless it exposes Satan
[20:42] revealing his works the attempted
[20:45] destruction of God's people and the
[20:48] discrediting of God's word right down to
[20:51] the time he is cast into the Lake of
[20:53] Fire he fights that he cannot stand it
[20:57] he know knows that if the people get the
[21:01] true revelation of the true church and
[21:03] what she is and what she uh excuse me
[21:07] what I lost my place here what she is
[21:09] what she stands for and that she can do
[21:12] the Greater Works she will be an
[21:16] invincible
[21:17] Army Satan knows this that's why he's
[21:20] trying so hard to block it but he can't
[21:24] amen if they get a revelation of the two
[21:27] Spirits with in the framework of the
[21:29] Christian Church you see that's that's
[21:31] the thing we're realizing it's not so
[21:33] much out
[21:34] there it's even here and it's trying to
[21:37] come in here right it's just trying to
[21:40] it's trying to uh to compromise each of
[21:44] us as individuals who make up that
[21:46] church by if they get a revelation of
[21:49] the two spirits and by God's spirit
[21:51] discer and with understand the
[21:52] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[21:54] powerless before he will be as
[21:56] definitely thwarted today day as when
[21:59] Christ withstood his every effort to
[22:01] gain power over him in the desert yes
[22:04] Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[22:08] with true Revelation in our lives you
[22:11] see it's not in our heads in our lives
[22:14] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[22:18] us but we will prevail over them amen
[22:23] now I was looking for I had
[22:26] um I had had the word immutable
[22:30] here
[22:33] um where was I seeing
[22:36] that we know God is
[22:38] immutable and it seemed like there was
[22:41] uh something here I was catching out of
[22:43] what brother bam said immutable so we
[22:47] let's just look because I looked up the
[22:49] definition of that i' never looked at it
[22:50] before it said immutable means not
[22:54] capable of or susceptible to
[22:58] change right amen and I thought brother
[23:02] boy I thought that's pretty
[23:04] good God is not capable of
[23:08] changing right nor is he
[23:12] susceptible to
[23:14] change now we live in a world that is
[23:17] constantly changing we live in
[23:19] circumstances and conditions that are
[23:22] constantly changing but God never
[23:24] changes right his word never changes so
[23:28] no matter what happens with the
[23:30] opposition or the adversary Amen to the
[23:33] word of God it doesn't change him at all
[23:37] because he is uh he is incapable of
[23:41] changing and he's not susceptible to any
[23:44] change amen so that shows you amen Jesus
[23:48] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[23:53] forever and so he built his church on an
[23:56] unmovable an unshakable Foundation amen
[24:00] and his church carries the same
[24:03] characteristics as
[24:05] himself amen they are
[24:08] omnipotent amen they are invincible
[24:11] because they are the reflection of his
[24:15] characteristics amen so when you when
[24:17] when that uh when that really anchors in
[24:20] your heart amen it will give us
[24:21] confidence in who we are and how he has
[24:25] placed us amen here at a part of his
[24:28] church or his Earthly body amen
[24:32] manifesting himself and so that's what
[24:34] that's what that's why I read you these
[24:36] scriptures here out of Acts 26 because
[24:39] Paul was simply trying to do God a
[24:41] service without it being his will and
[24:44] then one day he met the person of the
[24:47] Old Testament letter he he met the
[24:49] person of the word Christ in the form of
[24:52] the pillar of fire and then he realized
[24:53] what he had been persecuting was
[24:56] actually Christ's body here here on the
[24:58] earth and as I told you this morning
[25:00] Revelation doesn't just show you
[25:02] something it actually brings you into
[25:05] that very thing amen and incorporates
[25:08] you into it as a living part of it
[25:10] you've heard the expression if you can't
[25:11] beat them join them well that's what
[25:13] happened with Saul he was trying to beat
[25:16] the church and then he ended up just
[25:18] being brought right right into it amen
[25:20] and sent to the church and even the the
[25:23] the Apostle Peter had to acknowledge
[25:26] that Paul had the Revelation amen of the
[25:29] word of God and of the person of Christ
[25:31] the resurrected Christ amen which is
[25:34] actually what the preaching of a
[25:36] resurrected Christ is what brought Paul
[25:38] to a crucifixion himself preaching a
[25:42] living resurrected Christ present tense
[25:45] amen not even a historical figure that's
[25:48] what got Paul killed amen but it was a
[25:51] revelation to him and so it it couldn't
[25:52] be could not be extinguished so uh I
[25:55] want to again I kind of had to cut off
[25:57] just for the sake of time this morning
[25:59] but I was showing you how John saw his
[26:03] name in the Lamb's Book of Life there in
[26:06] Revelations chapter 5 and he realized
[26:09] when the lamb prevailed I prevailed he
[26:13] saw himself there represented in that
[26:16] lamb in that sacrifice and so it changed
[26:19] his worship even he went from weeping to
[26:21] worshiping everything in the earth in
[26:23] the heavens and everything beneath the
[26:25] Earth in the sea and all that was there
[26:27] in heard John rejoicing amen when he saw
[26:30] his name the prophet of God shares it in
[26:32] the seals John saw his name written in
[26:36] the Lamb's Book of Life and that
[26:38] Revelation amen enabled John to go back
[26:41] write the Book of Revelations and then
[26:43] live out the rest of his life as an
[26:45] overcomer as as a as a Victor there in
[26:48] the Ephesian age so but but that book is
[26:52] mentioned again a little later in the
[26:55] Book of Revelation and it has a great
[26:58] meaning to you and I here in the last of
[27:01] the ages amen you believe we're living
[27:03] in the last of the ages today amen so
[27:06] this this book amen has was was
[27:09] mentioned in Revelations 5 but it's
[27:11] picked up again in Revelations chapter
[27:14] 10 and again I know you are believers of
[27:16] the message and I'm I'm not reading you
[27:18] scriptures that you're not familiar with
[27:20] but I I I I just want to I'm hoping the
[27:23] Lord will help uh just anchor this in
[27:25] your heart and and illuminate it maybe
[27:27] in a even even greater way so he says
[27:31] here I'm reading from Revelations chap
[27:33] 10 beginning at verse number one he says
[27:37] I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[27:41] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[27:44] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[27:47] was as it were the Sun and his feet as
[27:50] pillars of fire and he had in his hand a
[27:55] little book open see there's the book
[27:58] again this is the same book that John
[28:01] saw in Revelations chap 5 closed waiting
[28:06] for one who was worthy to come and open
[28:08] the book now there was only one worthy
[28:12] and it was not John and it was no no
[28:15] mortal man but it was Christ himself he
[28:19] proceeded forth from the Throne of God
[28:22] as the Lamb of God God the king amen God
[28:26] the Father
[28:27] became the son or became the sacrifice
[28:31] became the lamb to to satisfy his own
[28:36] requirements for Redemption he became a
[28:39] kinsman redeemer God condescended became
[28:42] a blood cell in the womb of the Virgin
[28:45] Mary amen and was birthed here unto the
[28:48] Virgin Mary amen and was birthed here
[28:51] unto the Earth Amen to take Upon Us
[28:54] himself the sins of the world Amen and
[28:57] and and to to uh to redeem you and
[29:00] I from the fall from everything to undo
[29:04] the second Adam undid everything the
[29:06] first Adam
[29:08] did yes sir brother and sister
[29:10] everything that was forfeited there in
[29:12] Eden was restored by the second Adam
[29:16] amen uh right right after the garden of
[29:18] gsan so in the Garden of Eden it was
[29:21] lost in the Garden of Gethsemane he said
[29:24] not my will but thine be done and that
[29:27] brother said he was prevailing in
[29:30] Gethsemane he was prevailing on Calvary
[29:32] but that was the result of
[29:34] Gethsemane amen he was wrestling with
[29:37] even his own will as a mortal man not
[29:41] wanting to have to go to the cross and
[29:42] suffer and endure that but the will the
[29:45] Revelation
[29:47] prevailed his purpose prevailed the
[29:50] Reason God had sent him to the Earth the
[29:52] Reason God came to the Earth that
[29:54] Revelation prevailed it's beautiful I I
[29:57] I just I see I see it in so many things
[30:00] you see so here this now this book John
[30:03] saw it the lamb proceed forth in
[30:05] Revelation 5 take the book open it and
[30:07] they they it immediately changed their
[30:10] worship but then they they worshiped him
[30:12] as their redeemer and they were Kings
[30:15] and Priests they saw their position amen
[30:17] and um and and thou Hast redeemed us to
[30:21] God by thy blood out of every Kindred
[30:23] tongue and Nation so here it we're
[30:26] picking it up now and in Revelation chap
[30:28] 10 and this is part of the opening of
[30:31] the seals this is in the sequence or
[30:34] order of the seals being revealed amen
[30:38] and so he uh he's here verse uh verse
[30:42] two of chapter 10 and he had in his hand
[30:44] a little book open and he set his right
[30:47] foot upon the sea and his left foot upon
[30:49] the Earth and cried with a loud voice as
[30:52] when a lion roared now remember this is
[30:55] Christ right it it it's it can only be
[30:58] Christ because only he can open the book
[31:02] amen but there's something happening
[31:04] here there there's a if you will there's
[31:06] a transition of the book or there the
[31:08] book amen is is changing places in a
[31:12] sense he cried with a loud voice as went
[31:15] a lion Roth and when he had cried seven
[31:17] Thunders uttered their voices and when
[31:19] the seven Thunders had uttered their
[31:20] voices I was about to write as John
[31:23] speaking I was about to write and I
[31:25] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[31:27] seal up those things which the seven
[31:30] Thunders uttered and write them not this
[31:33] was on patmas 2,000 years ago John heard
[31:37] what was uttered but he was forbidden to
[31:40] write it because it was to be sealed for
[31:44] an appointed time amen I want to say
[31:47] this tonight with divine revelation
[31:50] comes a divinely appointed timing for
[31:54] the Revelation to be made known amen I
[31:56] was disc discussing this with a brother
[31:58] over lunch you can see a truth something
[32:00] can be revealed to you and you want so
[32:02] badly to show it to someone else but
[32:04] there's a divinely appointed time for
[32:07] that and your faith in the truth has to
[32:11] be there and hold consistant until God
[32:14] does if it's a lost loved one if it's a
[32:17] child if it's a parent doesn't matter
[32:19] amen you hold your faith right there
[32:22] believing until God's timing clicks into
[32:26] place and he does what you're believing
[32:28] for and don't you stop believing don't
[32:31] you stop praying your prayer may help
[32:34] what is going on in the Supernatural
[32:36] that is blocking that from taking place
[32:39] may help that Prevail amen you hold your
[32:42] faith steadfast and believe it until God
[32:44] opens the understanding Amen in the eyes
[32:47] of of of the other you see amen there
[32:51] and and see that knowing that will give
[32:53] you faith and will rest you you're not
[32:56] all upset about what's going on in the
[32:59] interim you're believing to an
[33:03] end you are believing to a
[33:06] result and you're not going to stop
[33:08] believing amen until you see it take
[33:11] place and you may go by the way of the
[33:13] Grave looking for that believing but God
[33:16] will perform according to your faith
[33:20] amen absolutely so never give up
[33:24] believing never give up believing
[33:27] amen praise
[33:30] God Lord help me to stay stay on track
[33:33] here so something was was uttered John
[33:36] heard it but it was sealed up
[33:40] um I can read verses five and six the
[33:42] angel which I saw stand upon the sea and
[33:45] upon the Earth lifted up his hand to
[33:46] heaven and swear by him that liveth
[33:48] forever and ever who created heaven and
[33:51] the things that therein are and the
[33:53] earth and the things that therein are
[33:55] and the Sea and the things which are
[33:56] therein that there should be time no
[33:59] longer now um I I want to read this and
[34:03] you got a good pastor here if I say
[34:05] anything wrong he'll uh he'll get it
[34:07] straightened out I'm sure of that but I
[34:10] I want to I want to read this out of
[34:13] another version of the Bible and I saw
[34:16] this many many years ago and you
[34:18] remember we used to carry uh back in the
[34:21] before the digital age we have the
[34:23] little blue Greek
[34:24] diglot if you some of you remember the
[34:27] Greek diaglot if you look at this in the
[34:29] Greek diaglot it phrases this just a
[34:32] little differently than it is phrased in
[34:35] the King James version but it is not a
[34:38] departure or a deviation from the actual
[34:41] context right it's actually showing you
[34:44] what is meant by this phrase that time
[34:47] should be that there should be time no
[34:50] longer here's what the Amplified says
[34:53] and swore an oath by the name of him who
[34:57] lives forever and ever who created
[34:58] heaven and the things in it and the
[35:00] earth and the things in it and the Sea
[35:02] and the things in it that there will be
[35:05] delay no
[35:07] longer
[35:10] right or that time should be
[35:14] delayed no more amen that's right now
[35:18] you remember the brother Bram when he
[35:19] taught on the seals he said that seventh
[35:22] Angel's message is to tie up those loose
[35:25] ends or think things that were held in
[35:29] reserve until the seventh Angel's
[35:32] message things that had Luther stayed
[35:36] with the Revelation to follow the pillar
[35:38] of fire he'd have worked right into it
[35:40] he'd have come right into it but he was
[35:41] cut off his life ended the the the the
[35:45] the the age ended but the Revelation
[35:48] progressed right there were things that
[35:51] were not revealed brother bam I'm
[35:53] paraphrasing it or putting into my own
[35:55] words but they were true truths that
[35:57] were too precious to be revealed
[36:00] prematurely because what did he say in
[36:02] the seal Satan would have done great
[36:04] damage had he seen this or had this been
[36:07] released prematurely but now in the time
[36:11] of the seventh Angel's message the time
[36:15] of the
[36:16] revealing should be delayed no more amen
[36:19] that's right there is a divinely
[36:22] appointed time for Revelation to proceed
[36:26] amen to produce a certain result a
[36:30] reaction or a product amen that is the
[36:33] actual Revelation
[36:35] itself
[36:37] manifesting oh brother and sister I hope
[36:40] you don't think I'm out on the lib
[36:42] because I'm not right but there are
[36:45] things that God has held and has masked
[36:51] that's right he's he's taught it in
[36:53] Parable he's given it in Shadow he's
[36:56] given it in typ of the r said the
[36:57] Rapture is typed all throughout the
[36:59] scriptures but it's a
[37:01] mystery amen it's it's it's it's it's
[37:03] held there for a divinely appointed time
[37:06] and one day it'll be quickened or it'll
[37:08] be released and then we'll we'll just
[37:10] vanish from from no one will even know
[37:14] what's happened we just have been called
[37:16] away in a moment in the twinkling of an
[37:18] eye amen so that there will be delay no
[37:22] longer now you understand I'm not trying
[37:24] to change the scripture but we think
[37:26] here you know if you just read this that
[37:27] time should be no more well hey time
[37:29] ends time stops there's no more time we
[37:32] go into eternity and all this happens at
[37:34] the same with angel's Ministry well you
[37:36] you've got to see that in a in a in a
[37:38] better
[37:39] context understand time is still going
[37:43] on but the time of this being delayed or
[37:47] this the time of this
[37:49] being held in the mystery form that time
[37:52] has come to an end amen right in the
[37:56] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[38:00] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[38:04] of God should be
[38:06] finished that's my title tonight the
[38:09] mystery of God should be finished as he
[38:13] hath declared to his servants the
[38:15] prophets you say brother Tim what
[38:18] mystery the mystery that opened when the
[38:24] Roman thrust his spear into to his side
[38:28] amen there was a
[38:30] mystery that was
[38:33] released just as Adam had a mystery
[38:36] released from his side in Eden and the
[38:40] Mystery was the feminine expression of
[38:44] himself the mystery was him in a
[38:49] her
[38:50] wow it's exactly right her name was Mrs
[38:55] Adam that's and did not become Eve until
[39:00] she fell in the
[39:01] transgression she had his name his
[39:05] identification his life but she had long
[39:09] hair she had the she was the feminine
[39:13] expression of him birthed here or or
[39:17] formed into a body to
[39:22] continue his life to be the beding
[39:27] by which his life could be reproduced
[39:30] here in the earth that is the bride she
[39:33] is the mystery of Christ
[39:39] revealed and that's what Paul met he met
[39:44] the form he met the pillar of fire and
[39:47] the pillar of fire said I am incarnated
[39:50] in this church in this people and in
[39:53] this body and it brought Paul into the
[39:57] mystery and then Paul begin to preach
[40:00] the mystery and say you know what these
[40:01] are Gentiles but they're saved by faith
[40:05] they're saved the gospel has opened now
[40:07] it's not restricted to Jews it's not
[40:10] restricted to uh to Hebrews it's not
[40:13] restricted to a bloodline or a lineage
[40:15] it's actually the faith of God Amen
[40:18] revealed now and it and again it tore
[40:21] down all those barriers and I don't have
[40:22] a lot of time to expound on it but you
[40:25] understand amen it was the mystery of
[40:27] God then at the church being revealed in
[40:30] its infancy from Pentecost in the
[40:33] Ephesian age down through the successive
[40:36] ages amen the church was being formed
[40:40] here through each age and a messenger
[40:42] would be sent with a message that would
[40:45] call the believer to their position and
[40:48] their placing in that portion or that
[40:52] segment of the Body for that period of
[40:55] time and you did not get into that body
[40:58] without hearing that
[41:00] messag you did not become incorporated
[41:03] into that or be birthed into that apart
[41:06] from the word of God which was an
[41:08] entrance the word of God is an entrance
[41:12] for you believing that word to be placed
[41:16] and positioned in the body of Jesus
[41:18] Christ and in each age he had a
[41:20] messenger which was a Vindicated
[41:23] messenger with a message to call a
[41:25] people of that age
[41:26] then they would be sealed away under
[41:29] that messenger's
[41:30] message and in the next AG would come
[41:33] and
[41:34] others oh my I I feel good here the
[41:39] mystery of God should be
[41:41] finished brought to
[41:43] completion the Bride made whole the last
[41:49] member brought in under the seventh
[41:53] Angel's
[41:55] message and when the last one comes in
[41:58] the book will be closed the gospel will
[42:00] turn back to the 144,000 the bride will
[42:03] be raptured the two prophets will go and
[42:06] and then we'll go into the the marriage
[42:09] supper and then return for a millennial
[42:11] Reign that's exactly right oh my the
[42:16] mystery of God should be finished and uh
[42:18] again this
[42:20] is is kind of tying into the the
[42:23] prevailing revelation
[42:27] see and it you can see it brings when
[42:30] truth is presented when truth is
[42:32] preached it starts a war when a trumpet
[42:35] sounds it starts a war so when when the
[42:38] ministry came to this earth in the
[42:40] seventh Angel's messenger it started a
[42:42] great stir oh yeah amen but it has
[42:44] produced a
[42:46] bride it has produced a a a a people the
[42:49] the body of Jesus Christ so um I want to
[42:52] move to uh brother if you got it there
[42:55] quote uh just called it quoted quote
[42:58] number two questions and answers on the
[43:01] seals here's the question is it true
[43:04] that every Jew born since Christ that
[43:07] came into the world is to be
[43:10] saved
[43:11] no nothing will be saved only those
[43:15] names which those names were put on the
[43:19] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[43:21] foundation of the world Jew or Gentile
[43:24] see that's it the book holds that
[43:29] mystery and I want you to see I'm just
[43:32] caught some things in here today that I
[43:34] had never stood out so vividly to me
[43:36] before the book holds that mystery and
[43:39] the book is only unfolding it now not
[43:44] each one's
[43:45] name but what the mystery of the book
[43:50] is while it's calling those
[43:55] names amen you see names are still being
[43:58] called didn't end when the prophet left
[44:01] the
[44:01] scene didn't end when the last message
[44:04] was preached in 1965 those names are
[44:06] still being
[44:07] called amen
[44:10] John had been filled with the Holy Ghost
[44:12] but then years later saw his name in the
[44:15] book amen and so brother bam says I and
[44:19] I just I wish I could remember now the
[44:21] message but if there is a a a gospel the
[44:25] go brother B said the preaching of the
[44:27] Gospel is the sounding of the Jubilee
[44:29] trumpet and so as long as the gospel is
[44:32] being preached and as long as there's a
[44:35] someone to
[44:36] respond Amen to that there's still
[44:40] Mercy there's still Grace if you're
[44:43] Desiring mercy and Grace there's more to
[44:46] be had the names are still being called
[44:49] but the book is now being
[44:53] revealed under the ministry and the
[44:55] message message of the seventh angel
[44:58] messenger amen and we're close to the
[45:00] end the last name could be called
[45:02] tonight the last one could be birthed
[45:04] into the body tonight I mean tomorrow we
[45:07] could be at the Merit supper of the lamb
[45:09] before tomorrow it wouldn't be too soon
[45:12] amen it could happen in the next few
[45:13] minutes amen but you you you see what's
[45:16] being here what he says here all right
[45:20] the book holds that mystery and the book
[45:21] is only unfolding it now not each one's
[45:24] name but what The Mystery of the book is
[45:28] I I just say this tonight any Ministry
[45:31] that turns the revelation of the word
[45:33] back into a mystery doesn't come from
[45:35] God right amen amen we are living in the
[45:39] hour when the Mysteries are have been
[45:42] revealed any Ministry that takes the
[45:45] Simplicity of the word as preached To Us
[45:49] by God's Prophet it he made it pretty
[45:51] simple if they make it complex and
[45:52] mysterious again I'd run from it if I
[45:55] were you that's right
[45:56] I really would because it it's it's
[46:01] simple God hides himself in Simplicity
[46:05] and reveals himself in the same all
[46:07] right you you understand that now see
[46:09] paragraph 115 the book doesn't say now
[46:13] Lil is to be saved in this time of this
[46:16] church age or Orman Neville or whoever
[46:19] know it don't say that it just shows the
[46:23] mystery unfolds the mystery of what the
[46:27] thing is but we ourselves by
[46:31] faith believe it amen see remember Jesus
[46:36] prayed for Peter that his faith fail not
[46:41] see Faith reaches out and
[46:44] latches onto the revealed word of the
[46:47] hour and draws it into the OR draws the
[46:51] person into it is that right someone
[46:54] said well there's no need needed me
[46:56] trying it brother brandham there's only
[46:59] one to be saved out of Jeffersonville
[47:02] see now see it's showing a parable that
[47:07] isn't it there might be thousands saved
[47:11] I don't know I hope every one of them is
[47:13] saved but I don't know but here is the
[47:17] way I want to believe it I'm that
[47:21] one amen see that's Faith here's the way
[47:25] I want to believe it I'm that one you
[47:28] believe the same for you if you don't
[47:31] then there's something wrong with your
[47:33] faith and you don't know what you're
[47:36] doing amen um I don't want to get too
[47:39] scattered here
[47:42] but again the Jubilee trumpet only had
[47:45] an
[47:47] appeal to an
[47:49] Israelite come on when that trumpet
[47:51] sounded there was all kinds of Nations
[47:53] and peoples and walk walks of life and
[47:56] you know they just heard a trumpet
[47:58] blow mean anything to them but to a Jew
[48:02] to an Israelite to a Hebrew he was
[48:04] listening for that trumpet because that
[48:07] trumpet opened up to him a law that
[48:11] enabl him to walk back to the Homeland
[48:15] be restored to his inheritance and his
[48:17] possession regardless of what anybody
[48:19] else thought about it or said about it
[48:22] that's what the message is to you and I
[48:25] is our Jubilee trumpet so it captures
[48:28] our attention amen he that hath an ear
[48:30] to hear Let Him hear what the spirit you
[48:32] didn't hear at Kentucky with the a
[48:33] school grade education you heard Christ
[48:37] you heard your name being called from
[48:41] the Lamb's Book of Life amen and you
[48:44] responded to that amen amen and that
[48:47] that that is uh that is
[48:50] Invincible oh my so I want to show you
[48:54] again I I feel like I'm kind of kind of
[48:55] in a teaching mode here but it's pretty
[48:58] good
[49:00] amen so this book here now in Revelation
[49:03] it's actually coming to the Earth but
[49:05] it's coming us through a certain Channel
[49:07] yes
[49:09] right me find it
[49:12] here the days of the voice of the
[49:14] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[49:16] sound the mystery of God should be
[49:18] finished as Heath declared to his
[49:20] servants the prophets and the voice now
[49:23] this is John speaking The Voice which I
[49:25] heard heard from Heaven spake unto me
[49:27] again and said go and take the little
[49:29] book which is open in the hand of the
[49:32] Angel which standeth upon the sea and
[49:34] upon the Earth so now it's time for John
[49:40] who represented us Amen to go and
[49:45] take this
[49:47] book right but I want to I want to
[49:49] interject this in here from 1963 the
[49:52] breach between the seven Church ages and
[49:55] the SE seals paragraph 299 talk about a
[49:59] jubilee talk about a time when that lamb
[50:02] walked forth see the book is even sealed
[50:06] in heaven the Mysteries are and you say
[50:09] is my name there I don't know I hope it
[50:12] is but if it was it was put on the book
[50:16] before the foundation of the world but
[50:19] the first thing that represented that
[50:22] Redemption come the lamb that had been
[50:25] slain
[50:26] from the foundation of the world and he
[50:28] took the
[50:29] book opened the book and tore off the
[50:34] seals see the seals is what bound the
[50:39] mystery the seals is what held something
[50:43] there it's almost like a uh you know if
[50:45] you've ever seen something with a great
[50:48] power a great potential it has to be
[50:50] bound by something to to to hold it
[50:53] until it's released right he opened the
[50:56] book and tore off the seals and sent it
[51:00] down to the Earth to the seventh
[51:03] angel to the seventh angel to reveal it
[51:07] to the people that's God's divine order
[51:10] surely the Lord will do nothing until he
[51:12] reveals it first to his his secrets to
[51:15] his servants the prophets so the seals
[51:19] only Christ could open them only Christ
[51:22] could reveal them but here on the earth
[51:24] in the seventhe age you have a prophet
[51:27] and you have the revealing of the son of
[51:30] man Christ operating in a prophetic
[51:35] office to reveal his word and to call
[51:40] his subjects yes to call his bride to
[51:43] call his church and to stand there and
[51:46] say come out of her my people sayeth the
[51:50] Lord and be ye not partakers of her sin
[51:54] be ye not identified you see you've got
[51:56] to lose that identity and gain his
[51:59] identity remember I told you this
[52:01] morning the same level of worthiness it
[52:03] took to open the book was required to
[52:06] look on
[52:07] it so for you to see your name on the
[52:11] Lamb's Book of Life means he has brought
[52:13] you he has elevated you to his level of
[52:18] worthiness absolutely that's absolutely
[52:21] right he has Justified you he has
[52:24] Sanctified you with his own blood he has
[52:27] removed anything that was attached to
[52:29] you to to to uh to defile you and he has
[52:33] lifted you up to see it shows you have
[52:36] been brought into the same level of
[52:39] worthiness as himself amen amen praise
[52:42] the lord the devil can't do nothing with
[52:44] you
[52:46] right but he sent it down to the Earth
[52:48] to a seventh angel to reveal it to his
[52:50] people there you are oh my what happened
[52:53] the screams the shouts that the
[52:55] Hallelujah the power the anointed the
[52:57] power the glory the manifestation if you
[52:59] ever hear this on the tape when brother
[53:01] B was preaching this in the breach that
[53:03] place was coming unglued oh yeah cuz
[53:06] they realized this is happening now the
[53:09] revelation of what has for thousands of
[53:13] years been a mystery is now being broken
[53:17] it's being released right here right now
[53:19] through those channels amen and and it's
[53:22] and and friends there was a day when it
[53:24] was released to me there was a it wasn't
[53:27] in ' 63 when I saw it but many years
[53:31] later Sister June and I heard my name
[53:33] called from that book and it became
[53:35] Quicken and real to me amen and I got
[53:38] the same Jubilee I had the same
[53:39] Pentecost amen oh my it's wonderful and
[53:42] and it will Happ you say but Tim this is
[53:44] all Greek to me well just hang on Amen
[53:46] there's a divinely appointed time just
[53:49] stay in that atmosphere stay in that
[53:51] environment stay under the preaching of
[53:52] the word keep seeking in prayer and
[53:54] fasting
[53:55] God will break it open one day brother
[53:57] and sister and then there'll be nothing
[53:59] the devil you he he he won't have enough
[54:02] demons in hell to stop youen amen okay
[54:06] so let me uh let me see if I can move
[54:09] along
[54:11] here oh yes well I just wanted to show
[54:15] and and I thought I'd say this too you
[54:17] know you get into some of these areas
[54:18] and people oh oh oh they get real
[54:21] uptight oh oh oh know there was a time
[54:24] but that's that's that's what the you
[54:27] know and I'm just use a few labels here
[54:29] that's oh that's what the Peruan
[54:31] movement or that's what the Thunders
[54:33] movement or that friends those are
[54:36] scarecrows amen those are scarecrows but
[54:39] have you ever seen a a farmer put a
[54:41] scarecrow on on a on a dung pile no
[54:45] no puts a scarecrow where the fattest
[54:48] strawberries
[54:50] are to an experienced bird the Scarecrow
[54:54] was the place to go
[54:56] yeah not there to eat the Scarecrow I'm
[54:58] there to eat the strawberries that the
[55:00] Scarecrow is trying to scare me away
[55:01] from so all of these things that have
[55:04] been taught down through the years and
[55:07] yes there may have been imbalance and
[55:08] there was uh there was you know a lot of
[55:10] times those movements were more about
[55:12] their leaders than they were about the
[55:15] actual message but that should not make
[55:19] a you know the brother M said the
[55:21] Catholics don't have the option on the
[55:23] cross just because they use a cross as
[55:26] their symbol doesn't mean we should quit
[55:28] having
[55:29] crosses amen see past the scarecro and
[55:33] realize there's a truth there that is so
[55:36] powerful that's why the devil did what
[55:39] he did with it to try to scare you away
[55:41] from it but it's yours it's your message
[55:45] it's your truth amen and when you digest
[55:48] it it'll produ it the very life of the
[55:51] message in you amen so I want I just say
[55:54] that say don't don't worry about the
[55:55] scarecrows and I and I I for sure am not
[55:59] here to try to point you to me or some
[56:01] Ministry I'm trying to bring you into
[56:03] not at all amen I'm I'm hoping you see
[56:05] Christ and him lifted up and glorified
[56:08] through the revealed word of the hour
[56:11] Amen in another place brother R says the
[56:14] bridegroom call will come right through
[56:16] this message you see in another place he
[56:18] says it's the that's that's the king
[56:21] calling for his Queen to come stand by
[56:23] his side oh you you're well taught here
[56:27] he's uh he's dealing in the first seal
[56:30] with the um when the the gospel goes
[56:33] back to the
[56:35] 144,000 and he'll say oh I got them in
[56:37] the house of my friends see one then
[56:40] they'll realize that they have killed
[56:42] the Messiah but what will he say the
[56:44] same as Joseph did you did it to serve
[56:47] life uh or save life don't be angry with
[56:50] yourself because that the Gentiles would
[56:52] not have been brought in if the Jews
[56:55] hadn't done that blindfolded trick so he
[56:58] saved the life of the church by the
[57:01] things that they done so there you are
[57:03] and that's the reason they can't
[57:06] understand
[57:07] this it isn't the
[57:11] hour that's something to think
[57:14] about 144,000 are gathering right there
[57:17] in Israel when God's Prophet was here on
[57:20] the Earth but it wasn't
[57:22] time there's a divinely appointed time
[57:26] verse two or paragraph 258 no more we
[57:30] could understand these things until the
[57:33] time comes for it to be understood oh my
[57:37] the seven thunders of Revelation may he
[57:40] show the bride how to prepare for the
[57:44] great translation Faith amen I I uh I
[57:49] know I sound like a broken
[57:51] record but in the little illustration
[57:54] Brother Brad him gave of the the armor
[57:56] meat packing man's son coming from was
[57:58] it Illinois and he went out west and he
[58:01] never found the the character he was
[58:03] looking for in a in a girl in Illinois
[58:06] so he thought you know I'll go west and
[58:07] they heard hey the the the man's coming
[58:10] this millionaire and he's going to going
[58:12] to have this big shind dig and he's
[58:14] going to you know he's looking for a
[58:15] wife and my they put on the big big
[58:18] shind dig and uh he danced and they did
[58:21] all thing you know they had their
[58:22] western wear their dresses and all the
[58:24] re and things on and and uh my he was
[58:27] just as disappointed there as he had
[58:29] been in in Chicago I guess it was and so
[58:32] he stepped out on the
[58:33] back the of the back porch to get a
[58:35] breath of fresh air and there he saw the
[58:37] little
[58:38] cousin she was related to all those
[58:40] girls inside but she was a servant girl
[58:44] not deemed you know fit or worthy to
[58:48] gotten dressed up and be a part of the
[58:49] ball and she's out there throwing out
[58:51] the dishwater and he he speaks to her
[58:54] and he says do you know why I'm
[58:57] here she says oh my she she didn't want
[59:00] to speak to him but see he was revealing
[59:02] to her his purpose for
[59:06] coming and she was having a very
[59:10] intimate conversation with him that none
[59:12] of the others were privy
[59:15] to and he's then he says I see in you
[59:18] and I'm paraphrasing I see in you the
[59:20] character that I'm looking for and
[59:23] longing for and what is absent from all
[59:26] of these others I'm here to find a wife
[59:30] and I want
[59:32] you to be my
[59:35] wife and she didn't even feel worthy but
[59:38] you know she
[59:40] accepted his proposal and he said now at
[59:44] an appointed time I'm going to return
[59:48] and I'm going to take you from this
[59:50] place to my home to my mansion and she
[59:54] went right back in there washing the
[59:56] dishes he no doubt went back in there
[59:58] and they finished the ball and the next
[1:00:00] day he got on his horse went back home
[1:00:04] now all those girls all those
[1:00:07] denominations that experienced his
[1:00:10] visitation went right on back to what
[1:00:12] they used to
[1:00:14] do and the only one whose behaviors
[1:00:18] changed was the one who received the
[1:00:22] essence of why he came amen amen and she
[1:00:26] started getting ready for his return she
[1:00:30] kept on washing dishes she kept on
[1:00:32] scrubbing floors as far as they were
[1:00:34] concerned nothing had changed in her
[1:00:37] value or worth but her conduct sure
[1:00:40] changed because late up in the night
[1:00:42] she'd be burning a candle getting that
[1:00:44] Treasure Chest packed up getting her
[1:00:46] wedding garments prepared and getting
[1:00:48] everything ready for his return now the
[1:00:51] world saw a prophet with signs and
[1:00:55] wonders the king of England was prayed
[1:00:57] for by him uh Congressman Upshaw was
[1:00:59] prayed the world testified God has
[1:01:02] visited this Earth in a great healing
[1:01:05] and signs and wonders Revival
[1:01:08] Ministry but there was another group
[1:01:11] that Heard a Voice they said I'm coming
[1:01:15] back and it has put her into a mode of
[1:01:19] preparation to ready her for the return
[1:01:22] of Christ she heard her name called by
[1:01:26] the message of the hour amen the the
[1:01:29] actual sounding of the trumpet the
[1:01:31] trumpet I'm I'm kind of moving into the
[1:01:33] Rapture here which begins with a shout
[1:01:35] which is a message to gather the people
[1:01:37] amen amen it's together I I
[1:01:40] I uh they've got something called
[1:01:43] sympathetic resonance where if a note is
[1:01:45] played and there's another like if if a
[1:01:48] if a if an e if the note of e is played
[1:01:51] on that piano any string here that's
[1:01:53] tuned to that same note will begin to
[1:01:55] sound amen amen right why because it's
[1:01:58] tuned to the same thing so when the
[1:01:59] message sounded it caught the attention
[1:02:02] and made others who were tuned to the
[1:02:05] same thing it begin to resonate with
[1:02:08] them it's the shout going to gather the
[1:02:12] bride amen or gather the attributes of
[1:02:15] Christ into him the prevailing
[1:02:17] revelation of who he is amen is about to
[1:02:21] bring her into
[1:02:22] translation into changing our literal
[1:02:25] atoms amen these bodies will be
[1:02:27] transformed in a moment in the twinkling
[1:02:30] of an eye and we're going to meet him in
[1:02:33] the air who sent this message to us Amen
[1:02:37] to ready us for his
[1:02:39] return hallelujah praise God praise God
[1:02:43] JN heard his name it called from the
[1:02:46] Lamb's Book of Life and then hear this
[1:02:49] this little book CU there's now only a
[1:02:51] few names remaining to be
[1:02:53] called now it's just a little book when
[1:02:56] John saw it in the Ephesian ages
[1:02:58] probably had millions of names
[1:03:01] perhaps now there's just a few left but
[1:03:04] this book and remember brother bam
[1:03:06] creates a distinction between the
[1:03:07] revealing of it and then the actual
[1:03:10] calling of the
[1:03:11] names but the message preached is
[1:03:14] calling the names of the
[1:03:17] elect and you're you're hearing your
[1:03:20] identification you're hearing you don't
[1:03:22] hear lee LEL or Aon Roberts or or June
[1:03:26] Dell you're you're hearing your
[1:03:30] identification Mrs Jesus Christ you're
[1:03:33] hearing who you were all
[1:03:35] along and you're saying that's who I am
[1:03:39] that word that is exact something is
[1:03:42] answering that and the Revelation is
[1:03:45] emerging and the other is fading away
[1:03:48] the other is drifting away everything
[1:03:50] that doesn't match that word is being
[1:03:52] honed away
[1:03:55] amen amen I uh I'm up against the clock
[1:03:59] again can we turn into Revelation
[1:04:03] chapter 21 and uh brother get that
[1:04:06] picture
[1:04:07] ready
[1:04:10] um I do work from from time to time
[1:04:15] since 2008 I believe 2007 I went to
[1:04:20] Romania 2008 I began to visit the Czech
[1:04:23] Republic and this year in uh October I
[1:04:26] visited the country of Hungary for the
[1:04:29] first time but in the city in Czech
[1:04:31] Republic there is a city there uh called
[1:04:34] harit clava and it's called the city of
[1:04:38] the king they have a lot of castles in
[1:04:41] that c in those countries in and in
[1:04:43] Czech Republic uh so this city of the
[1:04:47] King was where the King's throne was
[1:04:50] where he lived where he reigned where he
[1:04:53] conducted the business and the Affairs
[1:04:55] of the Kingdom were in and that that's
[1:04:59] that's not the picture that that I'm
[1:05:00] showing you right now but um in in in
[1:05:04] the city of the king is where the the
[1:05:08] the
[1:05:09] capital or the you know it was the
[1:05:12] center of his Dominion right was there
[1:05:15] in that City now that King who had CLA
[1:05:20] also built another city and I can't I
[1:05:22] don't remember the name of it but it was
[1:05:23] called the city of the
[1:05:25] queen he built her her own castle and
[1:05:30] her own City somewhere
[1:05:33] else and he and he put put a lot of
[1:05:35] distance there and they said because she
[1:05:38] had her own
[1:05:40] agenda she had her own Affairs right she
[1:05:44] had her own things going on that was a
[1:05:48] hindrance to him and what he was doing
[1:05:52] so he built his is Queen her own City
[1:05:57] somewhere off in the distance so she had
[1:06:00] a city called the city of the queen
[1:06:04] right now this picture I'm showing you
[1:06:07] is a picture of the Parliament building
[1:06:09] in Budapest Hungary which is the capital
[1:06:12] city of
[1:06:13] Hungary I only had a few hours there on
[1:06:16] a Sunday evening after the meetings
[1:06:18] wrapped up I had to fly out early Monday
[1:06:20] morning so they took me to this city uh
[1:06:22] at Budapest which is on a river at at at
[1:06:26] one time it was two countries and one
[1:06:27] side was buha and the other side was P
[1:06:30] now it's one city but this is the
[1:06:33] Parliament building at night and I took
[1:06:35] this photograph from my from my phone
[1:06:38] camera through the window of a car quite
[1:06:41] a building quite a picture right so John
[1:06:46] here in in Revelations chapter 21 says
[1:06:49] There came unto me I'm in verse nine
[1:06:51] there came unto me one of the seven
[1:06:53] angels which had the seven vials full of
[1:06:55] the last seven plagues and talked with
[1:06:57] me saying come hither I will show Thee
[1:07:01] the bride the Lamb's
[1:07:03] wife maybe I could say this I will show
[1:07:07] thee Christ The Mystery of God
[1:07:10] revealed in Bride
[1:07:12] form come and I will show Thee the bride
[1:07:16] the Lamb's wife and he carried me away
[1:07:19] into the spirit to a great and high
[1:07:21] mountain now one thing about these
[1:07:23] castles is they are often situated on an
[1:07:26] elevated place right they are often
[1:07:29] situated up on the Mountaintop for
[1:07:31] visibility and also for protection to
[1:07:35] come against them you got to climb and
[1:07:37] Scurry all the way up the side of this
[1:07:38] mountain and then you got to get over
[1:07:40] this great wall that they have built to
[1:07:42] fortify it but remember Jesus said a
[1:07:45] city that is set on a hill or a light
[1:07:47] that is set on cannot be hid the bride
[1:07:50] is the same way the castles are always
[1:07:54] situated in a place of
[1:07:56] prominence a place of high visibility
[1:08:00] and it's always where the real estate is
[1:08:03] worth the
[1:08:04] most amen that's right it's exactly
[1:08:07] right I've traveled I Liv for nine years
[1:08:10] in South Carolina it really it doesn't
[1:08:12] it's all throughout the the United
[1:08:13] States you go into a little town it' be
[1:08:16] flat as a flitter and it'll be one
[1:08:18] little Hill and on that Hill is the
[1:08:21] courthouse on that Hill is the most
[1:08:23] prominent place why it's it's it's if a
[1:08:25] flood happens it's the last place that's
[1:08:27] going to flood it's the most expensive
[1:08:29] real estate in the town oh my friend I'm
[1:08:32] trying to help you see who you are the
[1:08:35] bride the Lamb's wife is the most
[1:08:38] valuable she's so valuable he was
[1:08:40] willing to give his own life to redeem
[1:08:44] hers Hallelujah I will show Thee the
[1:08:47] bride the Lamb's wife and he carried me
[1:08:49] away in the spirit to a great and high
[1:08:51] mountain and showed me that great City
[1:08:54] the holy Jerusalem descending Out of
[1:08:57] Heaven from God having the glory of
[1:09:02] God and her light and I've got this
[1:09:07] reference to Isaiah 60 arise and shine
[1:09:10] for thy light is come and the glory of
[1:09:14] the Lord is risen upon thee if you
[1:09:16] looked at that building just a minute
[1:09:17] ago you notic it was
[1:09:18] illuminated it looked like it was
[1:09:21] glowing so is the BR
[1:09:25] praise the Lord her light was liken to a
[1:09:28] stone most precious even like a jasper
[1:09:30] stone clear as Chrystal now I showed you
[1:09:34] the Parliament building but let me tell
[1:09:36] you something about that building and
[1:09:39] the castle of the king and the castle of
[1:09:41] the queen in harit Kiva in Washington DC
[1:09:47] in wherever those will one day all be
[1:09:52] powder
[1:09:55] dust and

[1:10:12] that Jesus said there shall not be one
[1:10:14] stone left on another John saw these
[1:10:17] people right
[1:10:18] here that's the Bride of
[1:10:22] Hungary and if you want to see that City
