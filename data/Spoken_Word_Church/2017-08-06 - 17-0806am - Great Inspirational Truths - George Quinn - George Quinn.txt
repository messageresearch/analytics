little moment I don't not too long praise the Lord I could take a whole service talking about the missionary tour but we haven't come just for that we've come for the Word of God see and to honor the resurrection of Jesus Christ some of Sunday morning Sunday but last year we were in India and I don't know what but you know you ever get a feeling that the devil doesn't like yeah you know I really don't let you you know as well I don't like you either so I mean there's no love lost there and praise the Lord but any little chance he gets to command he'll take it and generally and you know I remember brother Wilson ham buried under used to say you know I don't want to harm the devil a stick because of you hand him the stick he'll beat you so don't get mistake kabhi do it you know so Prince the Lord but them over in India this year with a wonderful time and helping the brothers and helping the poor families like it was a real blessing to me - Bob we were in a little house you know the pastor and the the building was not too bad the little church building but then his house it was just bare just a table there are a few chairs and I'm looking ruin for things and they weren't there they're almost eaten on banana leaves you know I'm so I'm sitting there and I'm not seeing anything and watched it and he's a lovely lovely wee brother you know and I remember last year his wife I said the brother Freddie what can we do for this fella he said well you see his his wife's expectant you know I said I do see that and he said you know they haven't got the money to go to hospital for her to have that baby and I said well we'll do that so we left him the money and she went in the hospital and the baby was delivered safely and you know things like that that's you know I've never was never called to build well I've called the book churches unfortunately I wish it wasn't so because not surprised you know but you know I mean mostly not to print books and things like god I couldn't do that shed of my league but you know I can't help the poor amen and the funds that I've got over the years that's that's one of my things is of help the poor and and this year I'm looking around and I said oh brother Freddie what do you think he said whatever brother George I said well I'll tell you what we'll go in and we'll buy them a set of other plates and all that now you may be thinking oh yeah nice dolphin all that know the Indians like the stainless steel stainless steel plates stainless steel cops stainless steel things for the food and it's all stainless steel and so we went into the store and brother Freddie and his wife was there and they were putting all this here six of this six in that section and I'm looking at all this piling up nothing wow it's going to be expensive but you know then when the bill came true it wasn't I was wonderful and I've got I've got some of them photographs witness this tablet here you know I was able to present that to him you know and it's wonderful to help someone that that hasn't got it amen but anyway you know I was a saying there that the day we were having the meeting up there near the oceans beautiful place and it was too late they had the big camp top and along the side and it was too loud and it's been too loud for years amen are we okay yeah okay thank you and you know for the first time someone didn't like what they were hearing and said and you know so they phoned the police up I don't know what they said but the next morning the police came to the service I don't know how they got there but they came and brother Freddie came down to the side of the building just at the door like this and he said so I went over he said don't go up to the platform just stood at the front say nothing you know they want your passport I'm going home to get it no give me the keys and I give him the case to my keoson and they took the took all the photographs you know so um the boy funny enough he was a police officer and he was a Christian and he said he said to the Freddie said Freddie he said don't let him preach and don't let him baptized he said because he will be arrested he will be arrested so I said fine well that afternoon instead of baptizing the people had five people coming to being not interviewed but to be just are you ready for baptism woman was a taught in a university a lecturer they were very educated people yet they wanted to be baptized so we went through all the scriptures with them and then the next morning early the pastor went and baptized because he said you know these these police officers they will watch they'll be watching your every move you know so anyway um that was it and it wasn't they really didn't have very much on us you know it was soaking like a sieve for Matt I hadn't filled in a stick when you go to a hotel you fill in your name and you know all that so we left we left her that evening went up to the other pastor about two hours away and I told them said of the priests of the police asked you where I am just tell them about doctor that's today and tell them nothing else just tell them I don't know where he is he went up there if you want to you find him you know said I don't know where he is so we had the services up there 1,700 people 1,700 people come to that meeting amen on a Sunday morning you know the young the pastor said to me I started shaking hands with people pastor said to me brother George and yes yes yes if you want to stand here for another three hours shaking hands he said that's all right ha so I was wonderful amen and when we went back to a Hyderabad I want to show this if I may for a few moments but what are the joys of my life you know can you imagine I've dedicated many children I don't know I haven't even counted them I couldn't count them but I've dedicated a lot of children to Christ and this year in November I had the privilege of baptizing young men that I had dedicated as babies to Jesus Christ so what what an honor is that what a privilege is that hallelujah and praise the Lord Amen that that was wonderful to see that no I just had one very quickly in the Philippines I went there this this March amen and praise the Lord you know we have all the funds we got you know the police'll they'll ask me yeah you know for funds for something or other and I tried my best if I've got them to send them over and I did too to build the kitchen for their the anniversary services I preach think for anniversary services and I told the Philippine people I said I'm not coming back because I please for anniversary services you can imagine four or five churches coming together hundreds and hundreds of people and all pulling on the word then you go from there up to the next church to do that I'm the team you've done it a lot tell your tired if are tired so but Amen we did that and you know any funds we have there we certainly help over there amen and to help them build the churches and all these different things amen and one of the one of the meetings I could tell you many stories you know we were talking about that you know there when brother Branham spoke with squirrels and you know a no bellybutton and you know I shared that with the church in the very next day we were sitting outside in the afternoon and the brother said oh look there's a squirrel and the thing about it was to you and I you see squirrels all the time he said I've lived here for years and years you said I've never seen this girl here and you know then till the brother says I've never seen a squirrel not alone seen one here so so amen I said then it's just a confirmation isn't it that God wants you to see that what we said yesterday is the truth amen so at wonderful wonderful times and on I couldn't express when I was up and over in vain Durland and they're looking for a boat we had wonderful meetings up in North Carolina wonderful just wonderful meetings and one of the brothers is looking for a boat and I know I've been there because there's no roads and he said they gotta go up to coast like us so I hope that I hope he gets sad because he's a lovely lovely brother and would deserve it amen and he's got a little bit of land just enough to keep his family fed and he he actually goes down for pearls no money big hot Sun and the summertime and whatever not he works for somebody but I would love to see him getting that amen but when I stayed at his church brother Samuel here give him funds to build up the room when that's good and had a bed there the first thing I lay down in the bed it was hard and they called it a mattress and the first request I mean is could you get me a mattress and they said they said yeah show but 10 minutes later here the brothers coming in with another mattress I not really helped then when I get up in the morning and they had a little bathroom and that was good but all the water you had a choice cold or very cold what one do you want well I was trying to have a shot a little bit of a very cool bar and is that easy so an even-steven you know and I tell you it was it was it wasn't easy but I mean coming up at 7 o'clock with the breakfast knocked the door a nun came the table with the breakfast now SoLoMo bahamas get me the bed you know that's the way things go and of course he said when we bring you the flask we'll use some of that for Shivan so that's good I said have you got a mirror you would you have a mirror you know there's no pegs running to hang your clothes up you know there's yeah there's something else you know it was really something else praise the Lord yeah this was in the Philippines here you can see yeah it was and this is the church that we put in the phones to night he'd say that I would say that it still needs done but I'm hoping the funds will go to that to you and their realm at the top of that cable and join there let me tell you about that there ever mayne just recycle I better stop quickly because I was they had a peg and you'll see it on the wall and photographs I had a peg so they did it all up for the meetings you know and I was taking this stuff and putting up a plate and I said the pastor I shouldn't have said that I said him what's that and he said well that's the intestines and the heart and the liver of the pig you know and some kidneys you know I said don't tell me anymore I don't want to know you know I'm going to eat this little bit here that's all I want to know but actually the the cubes of a pig meat was you know cooked was quite nice but they eat the fat and everything but I couldn't do it but the meat was actually night but that that's why I'm mentioning that but because the Lord so it was wonderful and you know you may think oh that's hard brother Donny but you know something I've always burn it over the Lord we've got a great God we've got a great God you know and if he gives you a hard day you can be sure you'll get a busy day so when we left there went back went back to Manila you know we got everybody one o'clock and brother Boyet and his house a lovely home and I tell you what I went into this bedroom I saw this lovely mattes all my own mom in heaven I you know so that's how it works you know Paul said I know how they are bind and I know how to be a bit a man and God knows but it would wonder wonderful time you know and if I may say this just a prison Lord there's so many things you could say ah you know in India when the police came and they left I I just addressed the church for a couple of moments and I said to the people then I said you know once again just like Vietnam my head is in the lion's mouth but the audacity of it all I said to them no I said for you people I'm gonna challenge the devil toe-to-toe I'm going to challenge the devil and I said to him if you can close your mouth closure and I'm with go ahead and you know something but I discovered butter deck he couldn't close his mind he couldn't stop down in my head and kill me off and get me into prison or get deported out of the country he could not do it amen but unfortunately I can say this much that when I get back to the airport the guy said well that was a whatever was he had in his computer he said that's a that's a big problem a big felony or whatever you think I've murdered somebody you know and so I don't know when we come to do the he stopped my passport out so there's no deportation but if that said that if that's in their computer it was a at the airport if it's in the computer in Dublin I might have a bit of trouble this year getting getting the visa but God's will be gone that's all I can say and then of course women were in the Philippines could I just tell you one story about the Philippines because we went up and we were going to a certain place and I said you know brother meinem I said I remember that the weddin he said yeah he said can you remember that I said yeah I said Pat Russell Suzie can you remember there mims I said of course yeah I can and he said yeah they've had a born child under money two years and she's expecting another child so that was wonderful but I said but you remember that wedding that the brother carried in a sister at the very end you just to give their greetings to the married couple and on her dress there was bloodstains you know and I thought what nurse I you know and just as I could see the tears that come on down and she wasn't in know and so I'm standing there at the side and just as they can by me again I can a more or less you know stop them and and I said do you mind if I pray for you and they said yes it's fine you know we prayed so the festivities went on he carried her right and they just lived across their little house it's just a little lien from the church and that's where they lived but we were up in another place and about three hours later we're leaving the village and I I walk and I walk behind the pastor going up to where the car was his SUV and I seen her she was in her garden sitting on a bed with her back to the wall so I said pastor pastor called them back and we open a little gate and went then and I looked at her and I said my I said you're looking much better and I and she smiled so I said well god bless you shook her hand and we drove off and that was that for two years that was that until this year we're driving up talking about these things and I said tell me I said whatever but whatever became of that woman you know I didn't even know her name and he said oh brother she was healed and I said wow that's wonderful that's wonderful I didn't even know that what job he said I might be talking to someone this morning he said she has diabetes that's what it was so shown for him wherever the blood comes right I do I don't know folks but that's what he said and so I said wow that's really wonderful and I said tell me and I said I don't mind I mean after Lilly takes insulin and needs insulin I'd say Amen whatever you failed to do you know but I said does she take insulin he said no she doesn't need it amen so so you know that was wonderful and then of course of course that lady she put me on the spot because I didn't know it but in the meeting that night she asked God that I would pray for her son and I didn't know she was good that I would pray for her son but in the meeting when people came out and would meet at the front you know my I just felt to pray for this platform to pull over so I just excuse me and I wonder where I said son I want to pray for you you know and I prayed for him and that was her answer to her that was her boy you know so thank God for leadership of the Holy Ghost amen and I will say this much that we did help a few pastors there and the main posture don't a grip he's doing a great job and he said brother I needed the engine needs to be really overhauled it's leaking oil and all kinds of things night and he said if you can help and I asked him how much it would be it was 12 million rupiah amen I forget how many maybe 800 800 well close to $1,000 I suppose just about there so thank God we were able to do these things and we can only do it because God's people has helped us that's all so we're so thankful and and amen certainly I said if I go back to that area and Bangkok I'll go down it's only been an hour 15 minutes to fly to Indonesia so we'll do it but anyway I'll leave it there I'm anybody has any questions ask him and I'll give you an answer because there's far more than that but all I want to turn to the Word of God it's 10:00 to 11:00 o'clock and could we just turn to the scripture please amen and we're going to read in Matthew it should come up here and I think it'll be fly stopped for you but if you've got your Bible with you yeah it says just just for a text says that when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man um so he is the son of man and they said some say they were John the Baptist some Elias which is Elijah and some say Jeremiah's which is Jeremiah or one of the prophets and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am and that question console every one of us today it's not what the part is to you who do you say that he is see and so he says Pater and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ now that's revelation the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say auntie zhou art Peter and upon this rock amen I will build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it we'll take them down and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose shall be loosed on earth shall be loosed what you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven amen and just one word of Prayer praise the Lord Jesus amen gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you Lord all over the world this day the Lord's Day Lord father God amen as we call it the first day of the week when you're believing people come together Lord to honor your resurrection and Lord we just thank you for being here we thank you for your grace that has brought us this way again Lord how we love the fellowship of your people here and Lord we just last night our hearts were just burning Lord to talk about the things that were talked about and father God we do pray not Lord except you speak to us Lord except you build the house they liver and then that do it Lord but speak to us this morning you know every need Lord bless every one of us today and we ask it all and bless your holy word especially to us in Jesus name Amen god bless you you may be seated praise the Lord and I'll just get I feel more free if I have my jacket off praise the Lord Amen hallelujah you know the title I the brothers the brothers were asking me about the title and I just want to call it this morning praise the Lord great inspirational truths greetings personal truths 9 I just was thinking about doing this for the church for some time so IIIi did it amen excuse me I did it and put these things together I at the home church under abundance of them you'll see that at a moment when I show you what I'm going to do but breathe inspirational truths you know it seems for me but the Baptist's have got a language the Church of God of God language law got a language that they speak in you know but the bride of Jesus Christ has got a language to praise the Lord and and you know our language amen when we speak the same language as brother branham a spiritual language amen but when we're quoting brother branham it might be strange to a Baptist but it's not strange to you or me you understand because that's what language is it signed sine waves and the sine waves that it is you understand what's being said and so praise the Lord over the years the quotes of brother Branham have left an indelible mark on our life an indelible mark on our life amen the richness of the spiritual meaning is so marvelous so wonderful hallelujah and it is inspirational that's why I call it grit and sprinkle trees because that word has inspired us hallelujah it's inspired us to this very point in time amen the truth that has blessed our souls and enriched us hallelujah especially in this dark are that we're living today amen praise God and we hear all kinds of things going on and nothing nothing surprises you anymore amen I was told that the first gay marriages the first divorce has already happened in America since you know well I'll tell us all good happen folks amen and I think brother Tong put it quite well other words to three men turn in Columbia said get married Wow and you know what they're building on they're building on nothing their honor their own a bottomless pit and it's just falling falling falling amen but thank God for the word and thank God for where we are today because of the words and darkness but we are in Goshen we are in the inspirational light of the day and it will see us through and Botanica finished us I hope that God really blesses it to your heart amen you know that's what I want to do I wanted to put a few quotes together you will have your your own ones a little boy couldn't be any more about 13 he came to me when I spoke on this and he said there's something for you said I might not have got it right he said but ah brother Branham said something I guess he said the same faith that got you in a bed in the morning we'll see you in to the rapture so haha amen and that's not far away Amen praise God number way so hallelujah Amen under so many things you know I started off by just as they come into my mind and my heart and you know I'm not going to speak much on this but brother brother said I'd rather have the right spirit the right spirit and under on the wrong doctrine than have the wrong doctrine and the right spirit and that's truly man you can have the right spirit or the right doctrine but you have the wrong the wrong spirit you're not presented at the way that prophet presented it amen and so like you know and we may be touched later on we but have we made and so you know there's so many so many lovely quotes that we have you know when brother Branham said you know that not so types of spirit soul you need these things that we can relate to as I was telling the folks there this morning that it really told me where I was listening in the the car coming down yesterday when brother Branham testified it was over in California the first time he preached it in Jeffersonville but I meant today is this scripture fulfilled that he's just given a testimony and then that he said you know that he because he was on educated whatnot he had to go by types you know and he said it's like my hand you know I can go over here I'm putting my hand against the light there you'll see a shadow on the wall now if you could only see that shadow of my hand you would see five fingers so the shadow will tell you that I've got five fingers Amen you understand Masada will always tell you what's there amen the tape will always tell you what's there but that's the reality that's the hon that's only the shadow but it will tell you what is there it's not going to show up six fingers and learning show up five amen wonderful things 9 if I make one because the first real thing that that touched my heart was don't put a carnal interpretation on a spiritual revelation and you know what the world's filled of it today prison Lord men and women that used to walk in a message putting carnal interpretations their own thinking their own reasoning and blur bottom always said don't try to reason with the devil he'll reason you under the table amen Jesus never tried to reason with him you know no it seems reasonable it wouldn't do it praise God so hallelujah you don't put a carnal interpretation now you know when evil and the deaths there was no Bible in but my spirits are Revelation he seen it wasn't through its amen he's seen it was a life the separation of life so he went and got alarm and offered it amen by faith which which the bush the spiritual revelation of an amen see it was revealed to him that it wasn't an apple of woodland fruit see and this is all that this is all the course you'll find them if you look them up amen it was a separation of life he went and he got a life and offered it instead of fruits amen well it puts it lovely in the Hebrews in chapter 11 when verse 4 where it says by faith faith is a revelation amen it is a revelation and by faith Abel offered up a more excellent sacrifice hallelujah by which he obtained witness a holy ghost witness that he was righteous Amen then take a silver fella because I got too much here to dwell on it I just I'm gonna have two peaks amen that's the other fella he comes along and of course I here's key and he watched his nature I'm reading from brother Don of here and he comes along he's a shrewd businessman smart amen and challenge it were very religious yeah and watch this and so he comes along here in both the older because he knows God you need done over the worship God and he buzz at all and then he puts his fruit so that feel on it the officer to God and he says Lord I know we had apples and caused the fall and so here we are got my altar filled with the fruits and praise the Lord here he is you see and brother son and brother branham he says that this will bring atonement pretty good and under Buddhists believe that to the state that's what they offer I see it in Thailand all the time there's a revival of Buddhism in Thailand you know big huge statues of Buddha and people they're offering their little fruits you know well see but brother Branham says see what he was trying to do he was trying to put a carnal interpretation on a spiritual revelation and you you go up the wrong tree when you do that amen you see because by spiritual revelation Abel knew it was blood amen so when we come to that I'll come back a little bit later on interpretation if you don't mind but you know here was was was a Peter amen and who do you say that I am and you know the Catholic set was built on Peter the Protestant with building on Jesus amen and neither one Jesus didn't say he said blessed our diocese that that flesh and blood has not revealed it God Himself the father has revealed it on to you and he says on this I will build my church and of course amen he says that the gifts of gear hell will not prevail against it and so a spiritual revealed truth of Jesus being the Son of God that's what it was will not hit you that's what brought you to Christ when you realize that he is the Christ that you need him and that's what brought you the switch he's built a search on not not on tradition not on oh this is my grandson and he's saved not because I'm his grandfather or whatever can't say that every person has to find it themselves amen and so here was an ignorant Fisher man a man couldn't send his own name and press the Lord you know but please God without faith to make him Peter the little stone and he given the keys of the kingdom you see so it was on I it wasn't on the rock Peter say something on a second I want to get lastly but upon the spiritual revelation prison Lord this is what Jesus said amen and that's the rock the revelation and only God can give you that aim and you'll never get that in a book you'll never get it you'll get it when God shows you it I'm praise the Lord so amen here he was and that's what the Prophet said amen and you know he said the gifts of Hell will not prevail against I'm just going to read it another portion before I move on fastly but the gifts of Hell shall not prevail against it certainly they did not and they cannot hallelujah because he took captivity captive and he descended took the keys out of his hand amen so Prince the Lord he's disarmed him and he is Lord I so glad about that not just briefly they'll finish up in the session the Roman Catholics say the church is built upon Peter he said now doctors really carnal and it is folks and you know I don't know if you stream this or not but ER yeah but if you do and there's any Catholic people don't be offended because I'll tell you what amen I'm not preaching at you as a person but if you believe that that's really carnal to think that God would build his church on that system amen and I he said that is really because a man that was so unstable as Peter who denied the Lord and cursed him with those and cursing amen God can't build his church upon any man born in sin you see honest ASIMO's teaching that Mary is the mother of God that's very subtle you know certainly as Jesus amen was the Christ yes amen but my not the mother of God in other words he doesn't transcend him no sir she does not amen and another thing too that they just made a very a cool mediator with Christ so where does that get us hallelujah a cool mediator means that she's a high priestess well you might find that you may find out in Jezebel worship but you will not find it in the Bible because of that's in the Bible and that's in the Bible folks God has broke his own word there ain't no woman high priests in the Bible that's not a disrespect you there ain't no woman high priest in the Bible you've read it I read it it's not there not right so prison Lord it's just a carnal interpretation on a spiritual revelation but then you know a brother Branham says he says amen but he says it was a revelation read it the way it's written flesh and blood has not revealed it but my father is revealed it on upon this rock I will build my church amen the church is built on Revelation on thus saith the Lord hallelujah Amen well could I go on a little bit about that because you know with with Peter amen I hear he's standing there on the day of Pentecost and the Holy Ghost has fallen for the first time and Peters asked what can we do to be saved watch right now he's gonna stick one of the keys in the law hallelujah and I believe it with all my heart we've heard of this week as well but I believe it with all my heart and this light that you learn today there's a key to every situation you'll find yourself in there's a key I don't matter what hand opens the key prisons the key but there is a key and if you can find it you'll find the key to the door whatever situation you find yourself in I believe that with all my heart amen and thank you very much and so here he was praise the Lord no bourbon I'm said look ten days before that suede coat said he said hear he's listening to Jesus saying and blend all the world preach the gospel and whatever it was when the resurrection yes and he says preach and he said and baptize them in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost Peter heard that what is the layers so what's wrong here why is this man not going to baptize them in the name of the Father Son the Holy Ghost well the denominations can't understand that praise the Lord for they keep doing it you know they don't even have no spiritual revelation or not folks they don't amen because that's not an iam you know what I know what I'm not going to stay here that is titles what he said in the Miam and Peter had that spiritual revelation so they built all on carnal reveling a carnal knowledge of an amen they put a carnal interpretation on a spiritual evolution amen okay now I'm gonna close with us on this section now I'm gonna close my message you made me the thought of going the other not yet there you are spiritual revelation of the word about heart are you glad this morning you got spiritual revelation are you glad what you can see what you can see hallelujah that means God's revealed it to you and so Prince the Lord the spiritual revelation of the word of God those who are filled with the Holy Ghost heard the word they have the ears that him that has ears hear and they received it and they live by it those who did not have the spirit heard it only as a carnal man and I can go ended up in the Corinthians but I ain't got the time okay but you hear there's only is a carnal mind and what do you do you put a carnal interpretation on what you hear you think it all right it's all open your intellect oh yes and this is it but there is a way that seems right to a man but they ended up is the ways of death you got out with my revelation amen and when you do that as a carnal mind you will put a wrong interpretation on the Word of God and many are do or not they would step back from spiritual to carnal and they're going to come up with a carnal interpretation okay no could I move on praise the Lord you know this came to me just an order can I'm sure you've got your you know I know but I couldn't put all the the ones that I love I'm going to do more for the church whenever whenever the Holy Spirit moves me again I put another sexism together but these are the ones that came to me for this particular um these particular uh message here amen I do love that one that I love up with all my heart and a lotus in church kids Roberta Bonham says you know that the measure will do two things you have the spirit of Elijah amen and he will open the seals praise God and revealed the true that's mmm seems the seven thunders that send them and he says praise the Lord and he said when you believe that he said your heart has been literally turned back to the Pentecostal Father's will I'll tell you what we believe that did he don't think there's anybody here that doesn't believe that truth that's in themselves we believe it hallelujah and our hearts have been turned back it's okay no he said never major on a minor oh how many are doing that praise the Lord even some people I know in them they say they're in the message you know but actually they're they're kind of Pentecostals you know like brother brother said it's like a blackboard ping the south leg you know and you just you just you just watch them you just watch them on the fence you know and when he gets hungry and he thinks there's nobody looking he'll be darned on the old dead carcass you know okay but you never made you're on a miner you keep your balance in the scriptures and I'll tell you what brother Branham will keep your balance on the scriptures by what he said he'll do it folks amen you see look at baptism amen I remember my auntie told me there is no father or there is no Holy Ghost qingxue much since ah yeah why cuz she was oneness the Church of God there's Jesus only amen so then you go along and you're baptized in the name of Jesus only and that's not scriptural it's not scriptural it's the Lord Jesus Christ we know that that's the fool wonder in the original and in acts I'm so Prince the Lord then you've got your other denomination say father son Holy Ghost then you've got people wrong and too far with it and then and they haven't kept their balance and the scripture but God will always keep your balance in the scripture hallelujah amen and that's wonderful and you never made it on a minor you know the restoration of the gifts you know people when you spoke on tongues you've got it I often wondered about that you know means so it means that John Wesley don't think he ever spoken tongues didn't have the Holy Ghost I mean the messenger of me didn't have the Holy Ghost cuz he never spoke in tongues good old candy costal theology and it is hallelujah I know some of the churches got that on the front door you know and in the foyer says the initial evidence is the proof that you've got the Holy Ghost not speaking in tongues oh my my my you cannot major on a minor hallelujah praise the Lord that's a moose since he says and I believe in every one of them yet the Holy Ghost I watch this the Holy Ghost when you receive it as the person of Jesus Christ now we heard that mentioned yesterday I said this is what I quote this morning all right let me tell you this years ago I preached the message you in Christ and Christ in you now what is it you in Christ If any man be in Christ he is a new creation so how do you get into Christ well Jim brother Branham said it the Word of God says it because he's a word prophet he said by one spirit are you baptized in one body that's how you get into Christ by one spirit hallelujah amen then hardest Christ get into you well that all takes place amen but what Jesus said in revelation 3 he said if anyone hear my voice he said I will come in I will come in that is Christ in you the hope of glory so that's what the Holy Ghost is it's the person of Jesus Christ in here amen hallelujah so that is wonderful 9 amen ok you know we can speak in tongues he said I believe it I believe every bit of it praise the Lord sometimes I do it myself we went bird Charlie Spencer myself we went in to visit his brother and I is old man I in the home I'm that Charlie was praying for me started to speak in tongues I said that's nice amen but I wonder how much revelation of this message has they got you know that's just it and I wouldn't condemn it because I do it myself at times you know praise God but but you know something he said that's not it he said and we don't have the organizing the weapon amen the angel marking people you know weeping for the sins of the people amen he said and broke up he says God can never use just speaking in tongues you know like on prison Lord see you're majoring on a minor hallelujah he said we've left them in thing and gone secondary you see and you could never meet your no matter we knew that and and you can't make gifts you Rock salute who know you know look folks it's all on tape you know what happened what did Eliezer put on Rebecca he put the gifts on Rebecca she had them but she was more than the bridegroom that camel it wasn't a gift carrier it was a camel that shed watered and that's what brought her to Isaac and that's what her focus in her eyes was on her absolute the Word of God fulfilled amen so praise the Lord for that amen and I'm not I'm not tell you what don't you ever think I'd be against the gifts of God because I would never in a million years good because I know when I'm on that foreign country and not lying hallelujah I know I need the part of God sometimes I need a miracle sometimes I need a voice of prophecy whatever it may be amen a word of knowledge anything you're never going to say oh god I don't need that yes you do yes you do but everything in this place and a place for everything amen brother Branham said divine healing is not what we try to measure on the men healing that we're after is the soul Princeville he says the man are born again and how eternal life in shall never perish oh yes because there's the mindset you can get heals and get sick again where does that put you you can get healed and sick again after that amen but one day you will die if you live long enough in this earth you'll run it to your last day amen we all will see so he said don't don't make that a major don't major on a minor and he says that you know he said 86% of Jesus ministry was that but it was to catch the people's attention amen and so prison order you know I could tell you more about that trip to Indonesia you know but but you know through the brothers they had a going to shock you here to say this they had a prayer meeting at five o'clock in the morning yeah I don't know her brother Samuel cause you said look everybody lives in this area I want you Monday morning for the permit don't worry you'll have plenty of time to get the work because it's at five o'clock Wow and they do that I'm pure brothers common there they had a so many drill bit in front of even at that hour and they fell off their motorbike and and they couldn't get to the prayer meeting they couldn't get to the baptism because they they were what they would call a hospital and inverted commas probably a little shack somewhere with a Guyana old dilapidated wait coats you know I'm a doctor you know I know the the ankle of one of the brothers in the knee very bad and all's cotton skin you know but I tell you it was an opportunity to give them some some money to carry them over that time and to pray for them praise the Lord and God would touch them and did touch them amen and so we were thankful for them things but we're not gonna meet her or not prison Lord never amen and heaven said that see catching the people's attention and God does it and there are simple folks I never did tell you if you do see the photographs at the back you will see me up a mountain it was a steep as the good perimeter and we got up so far on a motorbike I was great and then I had to get off and he could go on up on his own but to couldn't because they tried it and one fell off you know so and I was there and I was walking up and I said to the pastor I am finished I am done I'm not going any further I can't go any better I don't look it up his big mind and I said I'm not going any further and he said all brother you can do it look at you you know you're fat you're healthy so how do you know you know you know I could fall over you know what you're going to do dig a hole zoom in pull my wife up there know so so they were good and I was going up there you know it was slippy to them they just grabbed me by the collar here and got me by the short and hauled me off the mountain yellow and I appreciated that you know I really did and but it wasn't too long and we got to the place where we were they had acted at the state of the mountain and they got their little house there that's where they cook and the water is coming down off the mountainside the children are running all around here and steepness anything and they grew their corn you look at this you look at a photograph and see right on where the corn grows you know oh my as marvelous and how did that dot but we had a wonderful time there and they've so simple for your folks you know they can are damage here in this little sea attack you know it's so hard to have simple faith just something like a childlike faith you know I mean if your chairs up on a wall and you say come on jump I just spring off right under your arms okay knows you're gonna catch you right you know but see if God says come on jump who don't know about that I don't know on you when you may drop me you know what are you gonna what's going to happen you drop me you know okay let's go on let's go on the stone praise the Lord so Amy and no gifts are not absolute yet divine healing is in the plan of salvation I'm reading it right what he said say for he was wounded hallelujah for that day when whip them whip them to a frazzle Amen but I'll tell you what thank God he whipped them for me and I claim not amen so pretty Lord we stand on the Word of God they are not are obsolete the gifts but we thank them for him and we're not going to major on them no I praise the Lord because with your get to know the one and then you'll see what I mean praise the Lord so you don't worry brother said the right mental attitude twenty divine promise will bring it to pass okay so he said that night let me just speak about the Holy Spirit for a while okay see the Holy Spirit I love this you know prophet of God when he makes a statement and sublime you know he said the Holy Ghost in you will feed on the Word of God and you how do you think butter what does that mean the Holy Ghost to me now first of all you see amen he will feed on the word that's in you that word got to be in you first amen when you accept the word hallelujah not word is in you I'll just give it to you in a moment but he will feed on you now have you going to the Song of Solomon you'll get a good idea what I mean the north but I'll blow in the sight when I blow in and the bride says come into my garden a taste of your fruits hallelujah and the male come into my life come into my garden gist of your fruits what you've done for me you feel or not hallelujah and it pleases the Lord when we can do that amen so imagine the Holy Ghost feeding on the word that's in you today prison Lord and you know not only that but he says here they've long forgot it because they've classified the gift of the Holy Spirit as initial evidence of speaking in tongues he said I heard devils and witches speak in tongues now this is that now what this is going to help somebody here this morning he said the Holy Ghost as the word of God and you write this is what he says the Holy Ghost is the Word of God in Jesus a treaty amen that identifies itself aren't you glad everything you want you want to know everything the identify yourself who are you you know you know even young young Samuel didn't know not who are you Lord you know and he said the next time he speaks let him speak you know and the old man knew not Eli and so the Holy Ghost is the Word of God in you that identifies himself by accepting the word hey man that's how I identified he will accept the word so you're saying Amen this morning because you've accepted the word I'm the Holy Ghost as had done to find himself with you hallelujah is not wonderful this morning prison Ord and he said the prophecy said amen she excited that he said and can't be the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost will never deny this word I don't care who it is he'll not break it he'll fulfill it the promises but he will not deny it praise the Lord and say brother grant him you know and I he say he goes right back you know you could say anything to him amen but when you get read back and you say to him and what about the Ohio River what happened there he would never deny that he not straight brother with he always said that happened in the Ohio River that voice spoke is John and he would never you could tell him anything but he said no I'll never deny that not to really hoping a new higher river and so thank God you know it's like the devil may come to you and say hey who do you think you are you think you're see if you think you're a Christian you know I was there the night that Christ came into my heart a man I don't need a devil to tell me hallelujah praise God hey man is this as Ronald said he never talked me into it and he won't talk me out of it amen so prison Lord young so that's wonderful and that's the evidence he said what are you believe it or not the evidence when the Holy Ghost identifies the Word of God and you into your heart you've got that witness of the Holy Spirit that's a glorious thing to hell you know I just say that's very briefly because I've got such a lot here you know when I was coming every time I go away I asked the Lord for a little promise you know I'm another promise that God give me it's find enough some under 1974 I got it about four three or four weeks before I came and I was thinking about it said they'll just come out of the page you know and then I forgot all about it so when I was coming away I began to think about it again I said how am I going to find that that I wrote a verse four weeks ago how am I going to find it I'm gonna tell you open the Bible there it was you know that's it and you know what it was it says they that fear thee yes feel the Lord will be glad when they see me because I have hoped the nigh word so I'm telling ya Hooper's a couple of glad people go to this building at the end of the service Amen that's the problem singing me amen see hallelujah okay amen no let me just see here amen yeah and isn't it wonderful you know if you go to journey as I getting older I always forget something you know I forget something but the thing is you know God don't forget nothing and when he was watching you for this life's journey every purpose in your life every purpose in your life he's already got it taken care of Amen why because the Holy Ghost is all you need for life's journey you know folks I tell you what we wouldn't into now and uh you know we've an airport and we went over to this old crop dirt van and we all get in and we're going to longer door dirt still goes round on we're buying some longer you know and I said to the brother and I listen to this I said you know brother a brother Sam Sammy I said if you brothers had faith God will give you a better vehicle and I meant that I just know if you have faith God will give you a better vehicle but you've got to come to the point when saying dear Lord you see it's to operate may we have another one where do you give us another one and you watch God move on the scene said what about the money but I don't care he will provide the money he'll provide a summer so many we touched something will happen and you'll get the new van but you've gotta have faith in God well move on made a mountain so that's it I know how I will change that that's exactly the winners so praise the Lord amen no I amen you've got everything you need for life's journey praise the Lord hallelujah I've often said myself that if I hadn't got a one dime in my pocket and I was over not far afield I'd put Hanan up the god and expect money to appear in my hand I really would I really would a men hallelujah okay amen yeah so he says he pred moo screeches God Eternal Father of our Lord Jesus Christ arisen upon the third day of the crucifixion for our justification has presented him to us in the form of the Holy Ghost that's Nikon's blessing our hearts and menacing to things to us that we have need of in this life's journey so I'm glad brother Terrence study everything we have need of he's ministering to us Alleluia praise the Lord amen even last night when your sentencing didn't slow you know I said well Burton weird maybe God wants you to just step in you know one get a better one you know yeah whatever needs you know if it's there maybe you think no this is okay for a while whatever but you know have faith in God have faith in God amen no could it just say this here prison Lord because I'm Irish you knew that and I can't help being Irish Chris the Lord my people were Irish and Scottish my mother said Scottish amen and and you can't help but you know brother Sam's quiet amen and we've got a little bit of the Irish temperament has the same you know when they had the big football finals over in Europe our government sent people over to France to talk to their government to say look when our people come here they're going to have a party but they're not going to break windows like the English they're not gonna fight they're just going to have a party said you let them do it and they'll tell you what it will be fine so the French took at the heart and the next thing is you see when the finals were on and the newspapers and there's the Irish dancing with this dancing with the police you know having a great ball that's the Irish they're like a party whether or not going to rack places and all that there's the English didn't part of them you know hard we're we're here to fight you know not the Irish do you know how many Irish people were arrested that that pulled Cup finals not one I'll tell you what I don't know how many English were arrested but those great a lot of cannons of water on them and all that but he said that government said just let them have their party enjoy it you enjoyed with them you know that's the Irish temperament you know but listen I love this because when let me put it this way here a man I've got it already don't Amen praise the Lord the anointing of God is supreme power under control hallelujah that's what he said amen no he was forfeit he had the full anointing of God hallelujah on him and here the spirit without measure is that right Houser the Bible says and I you would think if such an anointing was on him that's been prophesied 800 years before it would come and here it was with that type of anointing the full blessing and anointing of the Lord upon him we would want to run all over the building cuter marvels quarter or at the door in the door you know yeah what happened to them but you know something prison Lord that's what we had been doing but he just come in took the scroll opened it rare tonight this fruit of the Lord is upon me for he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor to open the prison to them that are in and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord what did he do that he hollered did he shout no he sat down amen praise God he didn't know about that I don't know yet can I just describe your purple or Igor oh no no he didn't he just said today as this scripture for filth hallelujah say what what he done was under the anointing amen praise God I love that because sometimes sometimes you're especially maybe were young ministers they think they have to show it because God's got a little but a hearing problem you know but I tell you I remember all Clarence Cleveland when he was up there and you know that the bricks was all leaking oil and they were pulling the oil to get them to Jeff wow what are we going to do and you know we got to get home and and then the sister got sick and not needing the restaurant after the beating brother branham come in and he spotted them and he went over he says you folks rot the meeting said yeah and he says well that's very fine god bless you enjoy the word yes sir it was wonderful yeah that's very firing god bless you and he said brother branham we just have a little problems and he said yes and he said Oh the oil and you know the bricks are just not working and you know an Assessor SEC here you know what do you think burger bottom said let us all pray on this restaurant and start to shout up to God you know what he did he taught them on the shoulder to God he said brother it's all right and the program of thinking it's all right you know what kind of a purpose you know no way but yet when they got into the the car and they're driving up the mind and he starts to use his brakes either working you know they're working hallelujah all the years later that he kept that car them bricks never needed one ounce of oil amen and then he turned around and he said Oh sister how are you feeling she said I've never felt better in my life hallelujah you know the supreme anointing don't you think that a quiet person as anymore oh no I want somebody to show it and pray over me you tell you what your postures been anointed and of God to do the office of hallelujah not fivefold ministry I tell you what you just believe it Amen praise God Amen so ok are just a supreme anointing under control amen you could take any of these and preach the whole message on it and you know the materialized body I love this because I want to get into other things too I mean you know this only reflects it then I get if I said earlier on it does there is a positive if there's a dead tree somewhere printer bottom said there has to be a light one summer Amen it's only the negative reflects the positive amen and the same thing or the translation of the bride will be the same thing the word that's Ain you now watch here not common right every so often the word to seeing you oh yes the words of my lord I don't let hallelujah the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word the same thing that happened to Sarah as brother bottom tells it in story you know wake up one morning can we ever hung there's a little bit of streak of black hair in your hair you know that's right that's right I knew you to Sarah I knew there was something beginning after they'd met up with with the son of mine there Amen prison Lord that came to them on the plains of Mamre the son of mine praise God the Lord he called him and bow down to him amen and you know that words began to materialize until they were turned back young then also for you and I see because he goes on to explain a little bit he said not when this old body you see the first body had to be changed in order to produce a son that body could not do it so this body cannot do it so it'll have to be teens this same way to receive the son so hard got going to change it amen the word and you will materialize it will be tangible hallelujah I learned the word and there will be a body change so praise the Lord I love that amen I'm not going to preach on this one I'm going to go over it very quickly because you know you might say have you got nothing to say to me personal well let me try to get that to praise the Lord you know the revelation of God will give you authority over the devil let me say this simply press the Lord if you know who you are praise God you know who's behind you all haven't we talked about angels yesterday you know I preached a message on angels hallelujah all the different all the different things and I'll tell them brother Richard you know I was in Edinburgh one time I go back yet again the brother twins take me back and there's a church there just it's on a hill and just as you would turn the corner there's two things about that church I ought to get there's a little stand of it that says with a little dog on the stand and it's called gray first Bobby and when its owner got took up - to be buried there that little dog never left his grave never left his crib to live died and people fear you know and it's called gray first of all before I tell you them little animals have more love than some some people praise God amen so here we were amen and so when we were there we're talking about angels and you know I was I went in to pay my respects because they had hanged them down here for the Covenant for they believe the word of God amen and not Catholicism and I was against them you know one money came up Brayden there and one of these Covenanters you said I see you have insurance you know are you going to change you're going to back to this he said no and his wife was stunning the kids polaris revolvers are not a revolver it was a pistol in them there's shot him he said what do you think of them 9 she says I think more of them than I've ever taught hey man them people were buried up there and one day I was there saw the monument I was getting a little bit grubby but I could still read it and you know and I just said at the end when I read it all I said sirs you know sisters whatever I salute you today and I heard someone say Amen and I turned round to look like this here there's a man standing there black hair you know all of skin Tauber lean coat kind of thing as much as I can remember and I said hey man and I turned back to think about this and I was only a couple of seconds so then I turned back to talk to him and he was gone could not find him don't know where he went he never went into Church I checked it it would have been he couldn't in the time that I did not he couldn't have walked away I don't know who it was what it was but I'll tell you what I know they caught that they look office I know they're here amen so praise the Lord amen okay you know on our you've got some beautiful scriptures right there on your walls and I always appreciate that for your song you know when you can read the Word of God and the one that we've got over our a church and really printed on them of the bridge was it or caught in simplicity where it says the beauty of the church is the character of its people we talked about it this morning you know over in Scotland or some yachak in the somnium Presbyterian churches Wow lovely big jaw organs big pipe organs you couldn't buy them today praise the Lord to be priceless I know all the lonely balconies and you know everything whoa beautiful what comes in on a Sunday morning what comes in earnest only morning short women hair and their treasures on their makeup on you know and here in a little sermon get a little inoculations oh my no no no no no the beauty of the church as the character of its people hallelujah and I was make that and bring it to my own people amen you see because everything is that's heart you know anything look at his character amen what it does it'll tell you what it is are you listening what you do I'll tell everybody what you are a man and you know the Pentecostal revival went all over the world the bride revival as went all over the world I know places where there is only bright no other denomination praise God yeah we were talking about the funerals yesterday I had a funeral one of our brothers died I had a funeral and of course the people in the town all Catholics and Protestants in using automated search and I had the grip because it asked you know the Burien Graham was in the church so he asked the pastor who happened to be a woman I could could I bury him from that church so she met me and I met her and she phoned the bishop and the bishop said well it's your house of you if you want a mineral so she said okay I think you could do that and so we had that we we had the funeral service and it was interesting to say the least a man tell you what those daggers and artis fly in my direction I just knocked them away and I said this is what he wanted me to say and I'm saying it I mean you've got to get up you believe but amen and then when we got to the word and I said to them I said if I was up like I was in my and Mar are way up in the mountains I miss little tribal chief we're in his house talking and what I say is going to determine what he letter a church he built in his village amen what are you going to tell him are you going to tell him what we stand up there a cardinal or we're going to stand up a priest sir are we going to stand up a Church of Ireland or a church of board or Church of anything about this there ain't no Baptist or Chuck's of ours there ain't no Anglicans there ain't no Catholics to send up so what do you tell them you tell them about the Word of God and you tell them at the revelation of this word hallelujah that's what you tell them praise God right through the whole plan of salvation that's what you tell them amen and you know it didn't go down too well but I tell you one thing one of my own people that was there I had come down with us for Roberts Funeral one of them people said you know there's someone behind find her and she said I heard them say for the first time today I found out what a Christian is so something good always comes to amen amen so the regular of the bride is what she is okay all right the can I carry on you know brother Tim wouldn't have that brother tell me carry on whether you liked it or not but I don't know no no no no no no a man of your old fall asleep I'm God quit him praise the Lord I'll fall asleep with you amen you know better but I'm said there's five musts he said there's five most I want you to remember these now no matter how sincere a man may be in doing it you and God a surface this these five musts must be there must be there soon you can't just take them and say well I want to believe in four of them are I only believe in three years I don't believe in nothing you got to take the five if you believe the message you'll take the five amen and brother Branham said he said the first the first one is it must be his time thank you breathe he said it must be his time to do it so no matter what's happened in history you know we can go back to John Wesley's day I can take you not more than three miles from where I live it was I found it by accident and you go down this little village and there's a gift there's a kind of a gateway you could do that get follow a little trail not more than 100 yards and you come to a river and right there there was a wooden building and that's where John Wesley preached the Word of God not more than three miles from where I live hallelujah so but I can't go back there hallelujah that was his day that was his hour see but it must be God's time it was God's time for that no it's God's time for us hallelujah okay the second one is amen it must be according to his word that has been spoken you know the continuity of Scripture is wonderful God always does things in continuity amen and it must be according to the word that has been spoken for is the Lord it has to be in the word that's why it was called a word prophet praise God that's why it says behold I send you elijah hallelujah you know and the mind that said mr. brannom was wrong because if you look at Luke chapter 1 chapter 2 John the Baptist is Elijah see carnal interpretation oh no spiritual revelation we know you know what the angel said to Zechariah until Elizabeth prison Lord that John would turn the hearts of the father's to the children he fulfilled not but I'll tell you what he didn't turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers did he say to the man's wisdom he's listed he absolutely missed it okay no it must be according to his word I would say more than the second all right and third it must be according to the person he has chosen I tell you what no don't matter the denomination may put up a great intellectual guy many of them have done it you know and not man had come up that day he was so smart so educated this winter like so and he'd be got to tell these people what he knew my my what he knew and he'd come up all puffed up and prayed and eight realized the people aren't getting this and so when he finished he was so down that he closed his Bible and he walked down the jacket and the man said the brother branham he said and I have hija de one don't like that he would have come during the way he went up and not right certainly as hallelujah it must be according to the person God has chosen a man not - chosen God has chosen hallelujah and I gotta give you more than I amen and 48 must first come to his prophets ever ain't in the Bible it's not God our whole message is in the Bible you read Genesis 18 and if you can't see yourself in jealousy sitting as the alaki Abraham you've missed it hallelujah there you are represented and who can't see you Amen Elohim the son of man and flesh pre-incarnate appearance of Christ honey tells them the secrets of his heart what more could we want amen and so it must come to the prophets force I'll give you a illustration illuminant and then the Prophet must be vindicated by the Word of God hallelujah many people stand up and say many things but a God don't vindicated they've mustered amen no you look at them things it must be his time you know brother bottom said Moses didn't try to to toe there the ark turn the River Nile amen he didn't do it wouldn't work amen you see but it was 400 years after Abraham had said God will visit you amen and you'll be with a mission did your language you don't even speak and God will bring you out amen that prophecy number 2 was given to Abraham number 3 it was given to the prophet Moses amen I'm number 4 amen it had come down the line right through to these men of God then spoke by Moses and it was vindicated praise the Lord that God said Amen you will worship here at this mountain and it was vindicated well you look at brother Branham look 17:30 Amen this time the same that time is a lot the time of Noah amen right here that would be the time when the son of mine well folks ain't never heard of the spies they never you know what's going on in our streets they were saying that 60% 60% of people in South Carolina don't attend church 40% in North Carolina don't attend any form of church worship at all where is this line going Amen I'll tell you where school is going to the line where when he looked round all he saw was critters you know you say Oh what about you well I'll tell you what the wave is coming to Ireland that prophet Columbus said Ireland will sink in the water brother Branham said God will sink that filthy place England I tell you soulless judgment but where will we be hallelujah we'll be in the glory amen that's where we'll be amen prison Lord must be according to the prophets all the scriptures like Genesis 18 amen speaking of a prophet like me the Lord will raise up that was Jesus Christ but compound that was our prophet a leader you are a leader before the people amen and so had to be fulfilled Elijah like a for revelation 10 you know I wish I could tell you about this because you know he said three nuts which don't misinterpret the word and one famous preacher Amen and not even tell you who it was and one day he get open his pulpit and he said revelation 10 7 is the trumpeting angel the trumpet an angel that is to Israel that is the trumpeting angel and I thought my oh my oh my how could a man say that when brother Branham preached his heart I'd showing us clearly that revelation 10 7 is the messenger of the hour hallelujah to this church siege and I went home and I told my people I said if not the trumpet in angel we are in the grip tribulation that's where it is because that's 17 Jalil is going to bring their day of atonement to them amen where they're gonna be sorry for the sins that they've done that they crucified Him and you know they wounded him my my my folks don't put a carnal interpretation on it and he did it because I remember I was pled to me amen I heard it plainly praise God I said I can't believe that but you see this is what's going to happen amen no I I'm so prison Lord a prophet like unto me he said that's happened with us and the message must be vindicated amen praise the Lord 9 I mean if you look at Jesus Christ you'll see that amen it must be the time to do it in the fullness of time it must be according to the word that has been spoken behold a virgin shall conceive a man and it must be given to the person of his chosen this is my beloved son here you have a man soul there and it must come first to the prophets you see the Lord will raise up a prophet like me as I said the Spirit of the Lord is upon me he saw his scripture John the Baptist saw his scripture and we see our scripture for the bride of Jesus Christ and the Prophet will be vindicated hallelujah amen all fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have said has all been fulfilled and you didn't see it shroo busy crying amen well praise the Lord even hope you got something that hey men so we're not going to misinterpret the word we're not going to just flow get the word it's not gonna you know like a engine you know I remember you could do I could do it I couldn't do it nigh on the modern cars but you know you could if you if you thought your engine just wasn't right you got a little light called a stroboscope and you turned on the engine and you'd made sure your fingers weren't anywhere near the fan belt and you send it on there and you could see because this late makes it as if it's not turning and those two little lights that right brother dick attitude lights and if you were right if you were not you see you could see the legs here when it should be here and that's true the school showed you that and so then you could adjust it until it was right and that means your pistons were all in perfect order you see so that's the way it has to be you don't want to dislocate it because it's not going to run right hey man praise the Lord you don't want to misplace it because you got to be right on the scripture for your day praise the Lord somebody says there's not going to be no rapture you say oh brother who's going to say that I know plenty people say that oh the church is going to go to the Great Tribulation well I'll tell you what enjoy it be my guest well we're not going to ever know Samuel no sir if you can understand that he has taken our judgment he has taken a we can be judged for nothing justifies us that we'd never done it okay please I just want as fast as I can amen see so you know when brother Branham talked about the per the program of God he said prayer is that key to get us back into the program of God he said you know I love this ayah but I look at all you know I would think you're all lovely people you know but you know maybe there's one or two of us here got a little bitterness in our heart you know brother Branham said prayer Oh take that better inside prayer we'll take that bitterness out of your heart amen and you know another little thing this is just older then you know he said the way up this time oh yes well that's not the way the world the way is up they could use everybody's head to get up hey man don't matter who you stand on or its users a letter just get up there you're the mind you know well I'll tell you we're not put us not with Jesus you know what he said the world you say what they say but I say unto you you watch each other's feet I'll give you the example the way up dine and he did it maybe this afternoon or maybe touching out a little bit but prison Lord amen and on your knees humble your pride and call on his name don't you know folks don't you know that the full head of wheat does what advanced advice not right okay praise the Lord no I just want to say this very quickly because I want to wind her down on a whirlwind err dine but you know before he reveals it on earth he shows it in the heavens so that's the first Bible press the Lord we know that we know that when Jesus was born them stars came into being amen and United and it says we've seen a star and we've come to worship Him amen so he does that and you know that's why I see the trade picture praise God you know people can say whatever they want you know brother Branham preached at and 1962 December and it was fulfilled hallelujah now I know he went up on March the 4th Prince the Lord years and years ago you know his sister Peggy was talking about when I first came over and all when I first went to Tucson Arizona I was only a boy 27 years of age and Peregrine

heard the prayer God did something for her hallelujah and so amen and he says don't get your line tangle up and times like these you know none of us here can explain everything never we couldn't do it
