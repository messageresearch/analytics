morning I got a brother at our church he always say I'd rather be in the house of the Lord than the best hospital it is and in the country so I kind of agree with him on that it's it's always good to be in the house of the Lord wherever I am you know I heard brother uh Dale talking about the different ones I I appreciate the mediums that we have today of uh Facebook and and all of these different uh Avenues to be able to especially as you get older and feeble in the body but it's just something about it brother Brandon say when a when a man get the baptism of the Holy Ghost he can't hardly wait till the church doors open and I'm that kind of person I I remember uh Contracting covet a couple of times and having the quarantine that was misery for me you know trying to trying to watch the service at home I ain't good at that you know one time I had a brother that was preaching at the church and man I was struggling bad for I noted I was up in the bed and all I could hear I was gone so I I appreciate the Lord this morning uh let's get our Bibles out we'll read a place in the scriptures good to be here um to be in fellowship with brother uh Dale and brother Samuel I met them some years ago at brother burley's camp I don't know if I met him before then but I know yeah and uh brother Dale got down and preached for us and it's been a long long time so I was surprised when my brother-in-law like Hey Brother Dale I want you to come up and and Minister I was like okay praise the Lord but over the years I had the privilege of uh being able to uh like I said I appreciate the internet and all I got a chance to actually hear some good preaching from Brother Dale it's it's not many people that I listen to uh but I I always used to find myself um listen to to the pastor there over the years just the Elder in the faith uh I still feel like you know I'm I ain't much of a Preacher but it's it's always good to be able to listen to people that you got confidence in you know somebody that's that's going to be in the straight narrow uh uh go go you know gonna cut you a little bit but it's gonna be right it's it's gonna it's gonna be right so I I salute him uh this morning and it's a privilege to be able to share uh the platform that he's built over 40 some years and that that's something that you know as a servant of God you don't you don't take for granted amen a man like brother Dale uh so we we like to read the scripture have a word of prayer and just see how the Lord will lead us all right amen uh Philippians chapter 4 verse one versus scripture uh uh no maybe we'll read from the 18th and the 19th when you have it saved man it says but I have all and abound I am full having received of uh that I'm not gonna try to mess that word up for you the things which were sent from you and older sweet smell a sacrifice accepted well pleasing to God but my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus uh let us have a word of prayer gracious Heavenly Father we just come this morning to give thanks and praise for allowing us this opportunity to be able to come and to be able to Fellowship around uh Eagles food we just thank you for the invite we pray that you anoint us are fresh anoint my body Lord in my in my thinking Lord the enemy been just kind of fight me since yesterday in the flesh but Lord I got the victory Lord and we just want to pray for the Saints back home and brother Jack and uh pray that you just continue to have your way we ask these in other present blessings in Jesus name reaction amen amen amen you may be seated this morning um we just like by the grace of God to use as a topic the purpose of the crushing and just a little subject that we approached at home uh during the Easter holiday pre-easter because brother Jack preached the East sermon and uh some things that we were just trying to um encourage the church by uh a lot of times I I realize in working with people I passed it a little bit about 23 years I don't anymore but uh we just kind of assist uh my brother-in-law brother Jack and and just working with the Saints there in West Palm Beach and just one of the things that I I've grown to realize uh and just talking with people and listening to people uh the purpose of things for a lot of people people uh they feel like well this is not necessary and and and that's not necessary uh the word purpose it means the reason for which something is done or created uh for which something exists and and when when we think about God uh just be when there was when there was nothing and nobody to uh consult in his mind God uh had purpose for just everything that was was done is that right how many could say Amen to that and and you know we we we're talking about a sovereign God is that right we were talking about infant knowledge right and and for me I don't I don't think that anything could supersede the knowledge of God the the principles of which God laid things out is that right and so for me now this is me I don't know about anybody else because you know everybody else got their own mindsets and and especially in a day of of of reasoning and and and and just false light and things of that nature we we find that when when people look at at scripture you know they pulling out this and they're pulling out that and this don't mean this don't mean that anymore and and we're living in a age of confusion is that right I think I heard somebody say it you know you you just don't hardly know what to call anybody anymore he she they them you know all these these plurals and and just so much so much nonsense that don't coincide with what God's purpose was I mean God in the beginning in his mind he he had family in his mind he purposed when he brought into existence Adam and so Adam you know was lonely he brought you know forth Eve from the side of Adam that was the purpose of God that that was to establish a man uh uh a picture and also to show what was in just God's mind because what was in God's what was in God was attributes and and so what we see in Genesis was the expression of the attributes of God Amen right I mean when when you go back to Genesis you see uh us a real standard you you see you see real family you see you see real order is that right is that right you see you see you see perfection in Genesis glory to God now now we working towards that we know by thought these things has been restored we thank God we've had a prophet you know we we're in a season now where where people are walking away from the word of God and things of that nature and and that's their choice because they're free more ages that's that's their choice to do that but but to me it shows that people have a lack of understanding amen that that they miss they they have missed the objective of of God sending us a a prophet and and what was his motives and what was his his his his intentions were were all about is that right and and for me it is to kind of show us what was in the mind of God see with without Genesis and Genesis being the seed chapter of the Bible we wouldn't have no picture right we we wouldn't have a picture we wouldn't have anything to look back at then how could you know preaching the scriptures speak of Redemption how could we actually uh use that type of terminology if we had nothing to look back to right and because we got something that we could look back to we could talk about Redemption right right we could we could we could talk about Redemption we could we could we could uh use this terminology purpose right when we see when we see the complete layout of God right oh I like like that we can look back and see a perfect Church Hallelujah that's that's wonderful right amen we we could look back and see things in order things and things in a Oneness right you could see you could see uh families and Oneness and in order and brother Brandon makes a statement and what does he say that's a that's a wonderful picture just to paraphrase it right that's a wonderful picture to see everything that that's that's in order right you know the wife with the husbands and husband with wives and them with children right so when I started to look at that man I appreciate God sent on a servant amen because we didn't even have a clue just just you know uh bits and pieces I was able to listen to the uh uh uh Sunday school lesson now who who was that can I can I see who that was amen I I really do appreciate that uh those those different principles because I wish I had those things when when I was a younger man you know uh growing up before I got married I would have understand you know I won't go into that boy because those things they close to my heart in this season uh because I'm you know you never too too old to learn and grow and and uh you you just got to be a student right at all times you you never no matter how old you are you never too old to be a student to be able to learn and and I think these things for a younger generation it's it's just so so important right right to really be able to comprehend all of these little principles let me get off of that because I'm starting to feel I'm starting to feel good on that those are the things I I it's just been close to my heart at home and just trying to make sure that uh this younger generation don't don't do like you know we did we didn't we had to reveal word but I just some some things was missing when I was coming up being a Christian 35 years it was a lot of doctrinal things and and trying to really establish this and then you know I come out of a certain uh view of the word and uh come into the knowledge of the truth and you just saw a Class of the Titans back then you know I mean and so it left us kind of uh lacking in certain areas in certain areas you know we were Christians but we we didn't have a full grasp on on you know our roles you know uh what my role would be as as a as a a Christian and as a husband as a father and and so on and so forth and my wife it's just so much that we didn't we didn't get so you we just kind of went in that blind man we went in blinded and so we we just kind of made a lot of mistakes you know we made a lot of mistakes that if if we educated ourselves uh from a from a younger age and uh not not that things would go smoothly because we we're in a contest this morning right we we are still fighting the Devil he's he's still a good adversary that's for sure he's he's still a good adversary but we will we would have known a little bit better how to combat right combating throw them out a lot of areas we wouldn't make the kind of mistakes that we made right glory to God so I mean even in this season those things are purpose purpose I don't think that was about mistake right see my brother had to be crushed a little bit you know so so that uh uh uh somebody else would benefit from his crushing but but like we say that's that's a purpose in in God always has been right always always has been a purpose of thought not just something that's random right right we're not dealing with just random things God's sending us a prophet it wasn't just random right it was scriptural yeah see when people look at us and they criticize and all those guys now this is not random we're not here randomly we we we're part of what God had in his mind what God purpose for for this hour in which we're living in like not just some random group of uh uh carnal-minded people that have come together and and gathered in them no we could look back to scripture and see where where God had foreordained God used the prophet to speak about another Prophet coming and and with his coming his coming had a purpose right amen and it is far beyond belt buckles and all right right it's it's so much deeper than than him and and all of those different things he his in his coming in the purpose of his coming it was to turn us back amen uh to an original yeah on an original phone an original program of God right not something that's man-made and man set up and you know hierarchy and all of those different things to turn us back to God himself turn us back to real worship of God glory to God Amen not the worship of humanity but real worship of God by the word I believe that was that was purposeful uh when it come to God but but when we look back to Genesis we we could see the purpose of God right we could see the expression of the attributes of God Amen is that right and and and we could look back and we get a real uh uh good view a good picture you know looking at the fall We Don't Preach apples and things of that nature we realize we realize what those things were right Eve opened up the wound of her mind and she accepted a wrong seat right right amen she she should have she should have kind of kept going but it just really shows you uh uh the the intellectual mind and reasoning you can't do that with the Devil and I think for a lot of people that have walked away and things of that nature it's the same spirit intellectual men and and trying to reason and instead instead of letting God reveal his plan and purpose to him they they want to kind of reason and just kind of make a lot of things personal yeah you know personal attacks and things of that nature but uh we we have something that's far greater than that right but but we we we look in Genesis and we find the fall right amen we we find Eve lusting for a PhD less than to Beast to be smart and I I'll just say this and I hope this be okay she broke protocol in doing that right she bypassed her head yeah right she she bypassed her head she bypassed order she broke protocol in in order to to accept something intellectually yeah right right because because if she would have went to her head initially I don't believe that she would have gotten in the in the position that she found herself in right and and she probably thought that she had a a greater understanding than than what Adam had given to her but then she found out oh my it was what I thought it was and and that's just like unbelief come on I believe really is not what it is cracked up to be yeah in the beginning stages it seemed like man this might not be so bad you know I don't know about y'all but I I didn't really grow up in the back seat of the church um I was kind of what they call the hootlum but it was by choice it was it was making a bad decisions I mean my mother took us to church we didn't I didn't grow up in the message but I kind of my mother was part Apostolic part Baptist sheet as a kid my grandmother was old-fashioned Pentecost amen and she died that way she didn't she didn't you know change when she died she still had a skirt on and her blouses you know and stuff like that she wasn't showing cleavage and and nah nah but that was just too strict for my mother so you know she went to the Baptist Church and uh that was a little bit more lenient and things of that nature so I had both you know things coming up but at a young age I made some bad decisions that that took me by the way of you know the streets and and drugs and and you can you won't be able to tell about looking at me now but if you just saw me in 1988 you know I was about this big and I was all messed up from cracking some everything else that I was on but but I but I thank God that that when I actually got converted I got converted in the message [Music] the the first day I was working on a church in West Palm Beach that you know uh I was a part of brother Westco uh they were building and I'm a drywall finisher by trade and I walked in there that day and I was leading God like you know I you never needed God before I just really without God I would have perished because I was kind of suicidal and everything but you know I'm grateful for God purposing yes yes right God God send me and know what age knowing what time knowing the season God ordering my steps uh we used to sing this song all of my steps in your word somebody know how to preach with me I like that uh God ordered my steps and I'm so glad that he did is that right amen he he brought me to he brought me to to truth amen is that right he brought forth for change in me amen right that I don't think that I would have gotten in any other uh denominational Church my brother Wade told me to I ain't got much time this morning so I I I'm slow and uh you know I I mean I have to tell him at church I'm not an old old man but I'm not a young young man anymore so I can't spin around and like that like little brother Andrew gloving them they kick a stomping he's probably been down the aisles by now yeah him and brother Solomon but I'm a little older now so I just don't move as much I just try to I just try to bring out things that you know because one of the things that I've learned over the years we've had a lot of excitement right we've had a lot of excitement and all of that but sometimes you have to look at where all of those people right right yeah we're we're all the peoples with the I'm quite sure what the amount of people that have come through those doors and if they would have stayed this place wouldn't even be big enough right amen so so you have to ask the question I'm I'm big on I'm big on asking the questions and it's and it's not it's not Ministry right now I could vouch for that and I ain't even a part of this local assembly it's not what's been preached but it's what's been quickened what what the move from here to here see that makes the difference it's got to move from here to here in order to bring the stability that's needed for for when you're challenged by the enemy up here right one thing I I can't reason enough I ain't that smart I don't have any diplomas or degrees or anything so I have to rely on what's been quickened to me by almighty God is that right so so we we see the Fallen Genesis is that right and and we we see initially you know Adam trying to do something with within himself that that was so contrary to uh scripture and what would be the purpose of God right amen and I often look at it from this standpoint because there's that that's that's protocol there's there's things that you know brother Brandon preached to message Christ being identified by his characteristics him being identified by his word is that right and so if if God would have uh justly uh allowed Adam to to uh uh adapt the Fig Leaf religion then that's what it would have been down through history right that that would have been the standard that would have been the program right right see Adam had no ability no ability to redeem right all right glory to God and I heard and I heard I heard this for the first time right here right uh uh where Adam took Eve he still couldn't redeem him [Applause] right he still couldn't because he didn't even know the program of God he still didn't know what was what was in in God's mind he couldn't he couldn't see how God was going to use blood down through scripture he couldn't see that so him so him taking Eve never really never redeemed right that was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world that was principles that were going to come into play amen after God comes on the scene and make the provision yeah see my God shall supply amen oh see man could not supply to me man could not meet the need for Redemption couldn't do it to intellect the man Adam and all of the work that he put in I guess when we go on the other side maybe we'll get a chance to see that I'm not you know I don't know but I'd like to just stand there and watch the work that he put in and what he done and then God comes down and say Adam where you at like this yeah yeah Adam you know just watching it play out Adam where are you right and then Adam realizes ah it's not working this is not working because I still kind of feel condemned I don't know about you but I'm going over here you know you can stay there but I'm going over here because it's not working something is wrong here hey yeah some something is wrong right and so when God comes down now now everything is broken yeah yes right the harmony like a man of the husband and wife broke it yes right right this Fellowship yeah yeah every everything is broken and Adam did not know how to fix it that's kind of like a lot of folk they lives are broken and they be trying to fix it yeah and they be trying to fix stuff and you can't fix it without God see people people wants to bypass the atonements and and the orders and the layouts and structures right and and try to do things with within themselves and and it don't work right you you can't fix yourself I couldn't fix myself is that right glory to God I couldn't I couldn't I didn't know how I didn't know where the starting point was right I I I I didn't really realize you know I always just thought church was for Old Folks well praise the Lord I you know ain't no different than most young people you know they I feel like church just for my mom and my dad and my Grandmama them no no that's just not it church is for you too cause you can't fix yourself you can't fix your disposition you can't fix your attitude you can't fix your mindset on your own like the brother we're talking about you know his spending habits what but where where did those habits formulate from from his background and the people that he walked I'm with you on that bro I'm with you on that you know and then you wake up and like oh yeah this ain't good oh yeah just as far as I am yeah now that should be way up the road somewhere you should be yeah right but you're not right because because of your mindset was was really carnal yes yes right right amen and you know I've been there done that you know we I first got mad man we were trying to get everything we saw back in the day when when we didn't have laptops back then desktops cost you 1500 yeah and printers cost you 300 500 stuff like we were trying to get everything not not realizing you know you just got to grow and build up to you can get to these things and not get yourself in the debt and stuff like that right but let's let's look at Genesis a little bit more you know Adam didn't know the program of God right yeah right so unfortunate it's it's a lot of Bible people today don't really know the program of God right it's it's still got to be blood see I appreciate the bleeding bloody word right sir you know we appreciate we appreciate Calvary listen let me tell you something God purpose that yeah see God knew that Calvary was necessary amen right right amen right and you can't it ain't something that you can bypass you can't shake enough hands right you can't shake enough hands to get in it put your name on enough books to get in the glory you got to come God's provided wait right God's provided way you you gotta follow the process that's that's been laid out right glory to God you know I come up a little about this I was baptized twice in the Baptist Church and I know what it's like the the the doors of the church open and to come up and shake the people hand right and get my name on the on the book right but it wasn't until I came to the message of the hour where I realized that there was a little scripture over there where Jesus was talking to Nicodemus and say buddy listen you must you must you must be born again why right yeah see it's it's vital it's something that you can't get around it's something that's required that you must be born again yeah yeah right right glory to God see you see uh well y'all still preaching that yes because they're still people trying to get in by a handshake or an association with you know brother Branham and his children and things of that nature or some great preacher being their friends or even now that's gonna disgusting just a little bit well I'm in the message right see you could you could be in something and not being something you can have an association see and that's what has happened to a lot of people they had an association and a mental conception but never really had a birth and the moment some real issues came right you know right the same idea with with Peter them they had an association oh yeah right with Christ there was a part of the church they they took part in Miracles and things of that nature right but when the shepherd was smitten then the Sheep kind of you know yeah he went and found Peter fishing and things of that nature right amen but when when Peter amen uh got a birth you never you never see a scripture where he backslid like that right amen and and so that's a part of what's what's been required uh in the evening time under under the light of the word right see people people think that brother banham came and did something that was outside of scripture his ministry was to turn us back to scripture Amen to show the fallacy and the things that people were doing that was so contrary to the scripture right right like like shaking hands right yeah and just being a part of of these systems and programs and things that were were set up amen correct right right amen this is not a denomination glory to God it's not amen see right this is a quickening this is turning our hearts this this is uh uh uh a work of Grace is that right this is this is real Fellowship under the bleeding bloody word yeah right so that's why when I see people doing what they're doing that's like they ain't got nothing to do with me come on y'all to preach with me somebody that that has nothing to do with me right because I appreciate what's what's been what's been uh quickened amen so so you know uh we we realize after the fall the fall the unbelief coming in it it brought it brought death it brought sin it brought this ideology that we see now all of this this this his and her and this and uh it it drives you crazy now right almost even on your job you just gotta be careful right you you used to stand up for what was right yeah yeah you you used to kind of stand up for real principles but but now the way that they got it they have more Authority uh uh than what the believer have and even brother banham told us back then in the 60s you know the inner workings of what was working in politics and the percentages of of these guys that had these different types of spirits on them working in politics and and now look at look at look at the the laws and the cancer Council cultures now and and the influence that these guys have right the influence it it takes something to stand for the word glory to God but but with with all of the unbelief that that kind of coming to existence you know uh God sent Christ on the scene and crushed him because it was necessary that's right right it was so a lot of times people people don't understand well why God had to do it that way and you know I'm reminded of a quote where brother Brown was talking about this smart guy or he couldn't understand how God uh uh you know this great God will allow these people to be put to death and to go through all of this trauma like that they went through not realizing he said you know uh uh it had to happen they had to you know see he had to fall into the ground and die it was it was necessary yeah for God's program see what people don't understand and we wouldn't either if we didn't have a prophet to open up our understanding so that we could see why under that day amen and its message back then these people had to be a man uh uh uh killed and martyred under the ox age right why why it was so necessary for the right because we we try to see God one way but God isn't God of Grace but God is also a god of judgment yeah right if if his father because most children want to uh the god their father to be the daddy of of just Grace you know and and smiles and and and just giving and buying and and but they don't want that Daddy with the Judgment rod see as as young adults you know my children still kind of looking looking at me like I was a tyrant foreign right but to me it was like you know I had multiple hats there was Grace there right because I wasn't a legalistic type person but but then you know there was times where you know brother Banner say you pay for neglect that I wouldn't neglect to use the rod the right the rod had its purpose The Rock was necessary because ain't none of them in jail see they may not be able to understand anything that I did but now some of like my oldest is you know uh shouldn't have his first be my first grandbaby and and all I always tell my children this I just pray to God that I'm around when y'all children start growing up thank you I just want to be a fly on all they walls so I could come back and critique huh I could critique but you didn't do that just did you yeah it was It was kind of the time when I think at the time I had three boys and uh you know it was coming up and I used to get on them and my wife used to say honey you you just too rough on them boys too rough I like really I say well listen they gonna whoop you they're not feeling whoop me unfortunately uh they're not gonna whoop me and and unless the next thing I know I see I got one by the ear walking through the hall real fast and angry looking I said honey you too rough on that boy she [Applause] she said she couldn't the next thing I know I hear kids getting whooped and I'm feeling sorry for them I'm like one time she was beating my second oldest and man on the cloud I'm like well what's going on in there man I went in there he's screaming and hollering and rolling out and kicking I'm like I felt sorry I wanted to grab the Bell honey take it no but I noticed you sped a ride you spoiled a child right so you get to the point where you know you you just have to stay biblical yeah right right amen but you don't you don't you don't just whooping anger you know I I never beat him while I was angry I always did things while I had a cool level head you know I'm one snatching them up because I'm a big dude yeah and uh I'm like I'm not going to jail for child abuse being this big Angry African-American guy just beat his little bitty no no I'm gonna be cool and calm you know my kids could tell you they've never heard me all yet they mother I've never raised my voice at them I feel like this is my house I don't have to be shouting and screaming but let me tell you something boy boy I will bust your head to the white meat really and you a Christian you busting the head too y'all know what I'm talking about to the white part show yeah man you need the ultimate you know but I discipline them but I discipline them with with a cool demeanor you know but they still say I was a tyrant because I beat him yeah yeah and I'll beat them again if I had to do it you know this is this is the weird thing if I had to raise my children all over again I raise them the same way you know pretty much with with I think with with more information maybe a little bit of things I might do a little bit differently but when I look at it holistically I can't see why I did anything outside of the world that was given to me by profit which was the mind of God right and how could I bypass that and say you know I could be an appropriate leader in my home trying to bypass the word and intellectualize it I I can't I couldn't do it so I I appreciate uh God sending us a prophet amen right amen amen to to just show me and teach me because I didn't have a dad you know if you got a dad I'm gonna tell you something you ought to appreciate well I'll put it to the light this way come on I had a dad but he wasn't much of a dad because he he would be in our lives periodically but you know he was you know he was he was what he was he drunk and that was his best friend yeah but I still love them to the day he died but I I I didn't gather the necessary knowledge that I needed to help me as a young man to navigate through Society I had to get my knowledge from society which was enmity to God right glory to God I had I had to throw all that that had to become dumb right so that so that you know there could be a transformation a renewing yes right right and I'm still renewing that that's still they're still right now and I'm 60 years old and that's still a constant renewing I passed it for 23 years but there's still a renewing right of of my mind glory to God what you better yes I'm not ashamed of that right I'm not I'm not ashamed of of growth right you know uh as I grow I want to live to be I heard some folk up in here like 90 something who wear the 90 year olds up in here it's like 94 right 96 and 90 something y'all help me I want to get their age and and you know here's the thing they walked in here better than me and they write right mind and all that I'm gonna I'm inspiring to that right but not if the Rapture taking place I'm going with the Reps amen I'm going with the rapture amen I I'm I'm a I'ma close out this morning uh because I have to right I have to I I've learned to be obedient brother brother Wade is my that's my pastor this morning so I've I've learned something I've learned to be obedient maybe y'all this that felt funny that just really felt funny when I said y'all didn't respond like I thought y'all would respond you know but I've learned that you know brother Jack brother Jack preached here right yeah brother Jack is my my my brother-in-law he's my pastor now uh I'm older than brother Jack by seven years I've pastored I've preached longer than brother Jack I passed it longer than brother Jack but he I'm up under him now so you know regardless of who I am and I don't know I ain't nobody but I submit myself to his his authority right right amen and he he's the pastor and I tell the church all the time do not come to me and ask me anything because I'm not your pastor he is right and so brother Dale is my pastor and I want to be obedient this morning and we'll pick up this afternoon by the grace of God and uh we'll preach in a little while yeah and when the time to cut off this afternoon I shut it all down cause I got a plane to catch tonight you know brother dad told me he said well I don't like y'all ministers just come in and fly out like that I didn't want to do it I was debating hard I wanted to kind of stay over maybe till tomorrow but I just thought well maybe I'll just do it the next time if there'll be a next time uh I'll I'll drive my car and uh I'll I'll stay because I like that guy right there I kind of like that guy amen because you know he makes you laugh and all of that he's not he's not one of these starchy preachers you know the because I don't like that I'm I'm a funny guy when I get out of the pulpit up here I'm really serious but when I get down let us have a word of prayer and I'll turn it over to let us stand uh brother Dale gracious father it's the musician let the musicians make their way uh we'll give them time appreciate the Lord let's give God a hand of Praise this morning amen all right gracious father we just thank you this morning for your Amazing Grace and goodness Lord um I just thank you for this opportunity and I pray that something was said this morning I know that I didn't really get to where I wanted to go trust that we could get there this afternoon but I I just appreciate I I learned brother Branham told us that the the gift is the ability to get yourself out of the way and I'm just used to getting out of the way and just letting you speak I don't think any words that a minister speaks that's just living is is in vain somebody needs something so we thank you and we praise you this morning for all things in Jesus name amen amen God bless you give my brother a big hands father I appreciate you oh I love you foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what do you do he leave me [Applause] inside me Holy Spirit you're a comfort to me heavenly father one more time you've heard a good message reap the benefits if you need it thank you Lauren oh heavenly father I appreciate you I love you and adore you before you heavenly father I appreciate you amen let's give our brother another good hand [Applause] and like I said we when we when I went down preached for him this is how long ago it's been um we were singing Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary every service that was what dad wanted to be sung to bring us out Bring Out them and we I went down to preach about willing his wife says I never heard a song like y'all sing now she said y'all singing so drawn out like you know and she started singing in that old southern draw and I you know the Lord prepare me you know to be a sanctuary so that's how long they've been watching in some of our services a long time ago so um and man the wisdom could you just not tell the wisdom the wisdom a man brings wisdom you don't you can't buy that you cannot buy it I wish some would but you can't buy it you have to develop it and we and our brother developed wisdom through yielding itself today and and being under head ship and being under uh brother Jack's a wonderful man and and yes sir I believe we'll have him back again if the Lord willing so we won't have to get him back so but we appreciate what he said we appreciate it there's and I and you see where he's going with it so we know being acknowledgeable that's why brother Jack said said y'all are a knowledgeable group you kind of know what's going on so we got to be crushed you gotta crush a rose before it really smells good you gotta crush a flower before you can really get the odor to it so that's what he's heading toward I'm sure is that we have to be crushed he had to get rid of his ideas I had to be crushed you had to be crushed you know sometimes we say you know something happens in our life we said boy that just crushes me now I don't crush you like the day you got born again I crushed that crusty old you right out of you hey man that just crushed us because he was crushed at Calvary that's what we give back to him as he gives us eternal life and then crushes that old nature out and puts his nature in remember service at two o'clock this afternoon and he does have to catch a plane at nine o'clock but I think we can get him down there he can preach as long as he wants to and I'll get him down there fast enough if we get on a plane so if he don't then he can just stay over tomorrow but we appreciate our brother coming we appreciate the Liberty that he was given and we appreciate the word of God that he that he brought to us so let's bow our hands we'll get ready to dismiss and go eat a natural meal be back at two o'clock and remember all these in prayer dear Lord thank you for today Lord we pray that you would just be with us Lord as we take a time to eat a natural meal Lord that that will chew on this spiritual food that we've we've just heard Lord and that it'll be Lord a part of us and and become us Lord and as our brother said Lord we've got to come to a place where there is judgment and there is Grace Lord I pray that you whatever's in our life Lord the judge it and get it out and May the grace of God cover each one of us father just be with us now take care of us as we come back bless our brother the Lord give him strength Lord in his body father we know that as we all getting older we got aches and pains and and can't do like what we used to do but Lord I praise you give him Supernatural strength this afternoon to give us your mind father we ask your blessings in
