[18:16] night but
[18:19] uh I just didn't feel that was the time
[18:24] to do it but I had it on my heart this
[18:26] morning I was like Lord if I get asked
[18:28] to sing
[18:29] I know brother Joe had asked about
[18:31] somebody singing this morning I was like
[18:32] well if nobody says anything nobody has
[18:35] is on the list then I'm going to sing
[18:37] this song and I come through the door
[18:40] downstairs and first thing when I sing
[18:42] brother Wade first thinging he said can
[18:43] you sing this
[18:44] morning and so he said sing Paul and
[18:47] Silas so I'm G to sing Paul and Silas
[18:49] but I want to sing this song first this
[18:51] has been on my heart and
[18:57] uh but uh this goes along with this song
[19:01] uh this man had a wrote it about a
[19:03] testimony that he had and it goes along
[19:05] with the with the message doors and
[19:07] doors and you know there's a lot of
[19:09] doors in our lives the Lord wants to
[19:12] open for us and that's what this that's
[19:15] what this song's
[19:18] about a heart is like a
[19:22] house one day I let the savior
[19:27] in there there are many
[19:31] rooms that we would visit now and
[19:35] then but then one day he saw that
[19:40] door I knew the day had come too
[19:44] soon I said Jesus I'm not
[19:49] ready for us to visit in that
[19:53] room go as the place in my heart
[19:59] where even I don't
[20:01] [Music]
[20:02] go I have some things hidden
[20:07] there I don't want no one to
[20:12] know but he handed me the
[20:16] king with tears of Love on his
[20:20] face he said I want to make you
[20:25] clean let me go in your secret place
[20:31] then I opened up the
[20:34] door and as the two of us walked
[20:39] in I was so
[20:43] ashamed as light revealed my hidden
[20:47] s but when I think about that room now
[20:53] I'm not afraid
[20:56] anymore because I know my my hidden
[21:00] sin no longer hides behind that
[21:05] door that was the place in my
[21:09] heart where even I wouldn't
[21:14] go I had some things hidden
[21:18] there I didn't want no one to
[21:23] know but he handed me the key

[21:32] face and he made me

[34:38] to be around you will laugh yourself to
[34:43] death but they they they threw sister
[34:46] Tabitha out when she was young when she
[34:48] accepted the message they threw her out
[34:50] of the house that's how much they
[34:51] they're Catholics but I think since they
[34:54] met some of us all through the past two
[34:56] three years they have softened up a
[34:59] little bit about that and they they have
[35:00] had lengthy discussions with some of
[35:02] your sisters and I I don't want us to
[35:05] put on the dog I want us to just be
[35:08] Christian I want us to greet them uh
[35:12] Sylvia um she's she I don't know what
[35:14] she's going to wear but I don't care I
[35:16] don't care they need to see
[35:20] Christians and uh and they're coming and
[35:23] that's a that's a miracle in itself that
[35:25] they're coming so they'll be here too
[35:26] also and like I said we'll all be
[35:29] staying at Mom and Dad's now um and
[35:31] they're leaving early Monday morning so
[35:33] we'll be able to Sunday when we're here
[35:34] next Sunday we're going to stay here
[35:37] instead of going somewhere to try to eat
[35:38] with all the people we're going to stay
[35:40] here and fix what we can we'll eat
[35:42] what's left over from the banquet we'll
[35:44] do something here so we can all
[35:46] Fellowship together cuz they want to
[35:47] come and fellowship and uh and they want
[35:50] to uh they want to be around us all they

[35:56] group and love them with a love of the
[35:59] Lord so now
[36:01] today we won't add any more for the
[36:03] banquet if you got somebody that's
[36:04] coming you need to call them today and
[36:06] if they say I don't know that's a no
[36:09] because we've got to get the caterer has
[36:11] got to know how many people to feed uh
[36:15] sister Anna and different ones that are
[36:16] doing we're doing games and prizes
[36:18] through the whole thing we're not going
[36:20] to do the um New LED game because we got
[36:23] so many people it'll take so long but
[36:25] we're going to add some extra games in
[36:26] that you'll really joy and also um for
[36:31] the sisters that are widows sisters that
[36:33] are widows are you with me that have
[36:36] husbands that are passed away or wives
[36:39] the church has got you a little
[36:40] something and it'll be a surprise and
[36:42] you're going to get it in the mail
[36:44] within the week so we decided to do
[36:46] something because U we sure I don't like
[36:50] to be left
[36:51] out yeah and it's Valentine's Day and
[36:54] some of you lost your Valentine and and
[36:57] I I ha that but God's the one that can
[36:59] comfort you I can't God's the one that
[37:01] can give you the greatest gift there is
[37:03] and that's his love his love you know
[37:06] Paul told us one time in the Bible he
[37:08] said it's better that you don't
[37:09] marry right didn't he say that he said
[37:11] it's better that you don't marry because
[37:13] when you marry you got to focus on this
[37:14] and that and the other well that's okay
[37:15] we all got married cuz obviously we all
[37:17] got married and obviously your Mom and
[37:19] Daddy got married and here you are so
[37:22] that's uh not something to be ashamed of
[37:25] but when you are single
[37:28] sometimes it's it's hard and we see it
[37:30] with with Mom with dad passing and we we
[37:34] sure do uh should do miss him and U but
[37:38] we appreciate God giving us a
[37:40] standard he give us the word of God if
[37:44] we have a problem go right straight to
[37:45] the word of God Amen so we're going to
[37:47] go there today and and today we're going
[37:49] to talk about a little bit about the
[37:51] unwritten word because the words here in
[37:54] your Bible the words been spoken by
[37:56] different people Luther Wesley all the
[37:59] way down we've got volumes that are
[38:01] spoken by Spurgeon and different ones
[38:04] but there was a time that
[38:07] God wrote his word in
[38:13] secret he give them the printed word but
[38:16] there's an Unwritten word it's not a
[38:18] different word it's the same word
[38:21] revealed or with a deeper understanding
[38:25] or a perfection because man today I said
[38:28] before man in in 13,000 different
[38:31] denominations most of them will open
[38:33] this same Bible and preach their
[38:34] Doctrine out of it okay but somebody's
[38:38] got to be right that's why God sent us a
[38:41] prophet he sent us a prophet to tell us
[38:43] this is the right thing and we got to
[38:45] believe that I believe that because it
[38:47] it it mirrors with Jesus Christ and what
[38:50] was in the Bible it doesn't mirror with
[38:52] his
[38:53] Humanity faults and failures we all got
[38:56] them amen
[38:57] but the word of God he spoke was the
[39:01] truth and we U appreciate God you know
[39:04] giving us the opportunity so let's go to
[39:05] First Corinthians and then we'll then
[39:07] we'll pray but as written iath Not Seen
[39:09] Nor Ear heard neither entered into the
[39:11] heart of man the things which God has
[39:13] prepared for them that love him but God
[39:16] hath revealed them unto us there's a
[39:19] promise by his spirit for the spirit
[39:22] searches all things y the Deep things of
[39:25] God for what man knoweth the things of a
[39:27] man save the spirit of the man which is
[39:29] in him even so the things of God knoweth
[39:31] no man but the spirit of God now we have
[39:34] received now here's the thing God told
[39:36] us you've received it what are you going
[39:38] to do with it now we have received not
[39:41] the spirit of the world but the spirit
[39:43] which is of god that we might know the
[39:45] things that are freely given to us of
[39:48] God Revelations 211 and I saw a new
[39:51] Heaven and a new Earth there was
[39:53] something revealed that previously was
[39:55] not
[39:58] we're going to live on this Earth that's
[40:00] a
[40:01] mystery a new Heaven and new earth for
[40:03] the first heaven and first Earth were
[40:04] passed away and there was no more
[40:08] sea sorry Louise got too fast and I John
[40:12] saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming
[40:14] down from God out of Heaven prepared
[40:16] what as a
[40:18] bride so he saw the
[40:21] bride the city was the bride the bride
[40:23] was the city and that's what was coming
[40:24] down was not building skyscrapers roads
[40:28] Gardens no it was people amen let's bow
[40:32] our heads dear heavenly father thank you
[40:33] for this day forgive us of our sins be
[40:36] with us and further in this service
[40:37] father thank you for for bringing us uh
[40:40] freedom of the spirit Lord today father
[40:42] I pray that that would be something that
[40:43] would that would not be strange anymore
[40:46] Lord that we would uh the spirit strikes
[40:48] and we just take off amen father I pray
[40:51] that you'd bless us now in Jesus name
[40:52] amen God bless you you can be seated but
[40:55] just remember next Sunday really uh need
[40:57] to make space for the people that are
[40:59] coming and uh we sure do appreciate each
[41:02] and every one of you
[41:04] amen Matthew 17:1 we're going to get to
[41:06] something here in just a second and
[41:08] Jesus answered and said unto them El
[41:09] lies truly shall first come and restore
[41:11] all things so you and I are today
[41:13] sitting in a restoration message we're
[41:17] not a Reformation message a Reformation
[41:20] message would be just to reform you and
[41:23] then all of a sudden you may become
[41:26] unreformed hello we've seen that many
[41:28] times with alcoholics and different
[41:29] things but if you get the new birth in
[41:32] your
[41:32] soul you won't ever do those things
[41:35] again right amen that will not come I
[41:37] mean hey the Temptation listen I I had a
[41:41] question here and I want to kind of
[41:42] touch on it just a second a a person
[41:45] wrote said there's a bunch of evidence
[41:47] to prove the message is right and
[41:49] ultimately because I have faith that God
[41:52] sent a prophet but sometimes I get these
[41:53] in intrusive thoughts of what if
[41:57] everybody raise your
[41:59] hand we all
[42:02] do we all do we all get those questions
[42:05] of what if what if this is not right
[42:09] what if this is this what if this is
[42:11] that what if we missed it and it's
[42:13] supposed to be for the Baptist
[42:16] right you got to take it back to the
[42:19] word of God do the Baptist believe in a
[42:23] trinity yes do you no does the Baptist
[42:27] believe in water baptism name father son
[42:29] Holy Ghost and they'll fight you for it
[42:31] yes do we believe in the name of the
[42:33] Lord Jesus Christ is the only correct
[42:35] baptism yes so guess what there's all
[42:38] the Whata ifs but here's your answer all
[42:42] right here's your answer is in the word
[42:43] of God the answer is that we have been
[42:45] restored back not reformed back but
[42:47] restored back to the faith of the
[42:49] fathers which was the original teaching
[42:52] of the disciples right after Jesus left
[42:55] so it was all real fresh in their heart
[42:57] I mean Jesus left and just a few days
[42:59] later the Holy Ghost came back on the
[43:00] day of Pentecost and boom there they are
[43:03] and they and then everything that was in
[43:05] their life was quickened everything that
[43:07] Jesus had said was quickened remember
[43:08] there was no Bible but there was some
[43:10] Mysteries remember Jesus and we'll not
[43:12] read it today but I got it for later
[43:14] Jesus said I'm speaking to you in
[43:17] Parables and they said we don't
[43:19] understand these things he said I don't
[43:21] want in other words it's just just 2025
[43:24] I don't want all them to understand it
[43:26] right I I want you to understand it I
[43:28] want my children to be able to
[43:30] understand it God's children to be able
[43:33] to understand what I'm talking about the
[43:36] Pharisees obviously didn't they killed
[43:37] him for what he said all right and all
[43:40] the disciples except for one got killed
[43:43] for what he said amen nobody survived
[43:46] except one John was the only one that
[43:48] survived every one of them was
[43:50] killed so if you got a mixed emotions
[43:53] it's the Devil he's a liar amen that's
[43:57] right and if you want to say you know
[43:59] what I'd say what if too I'd say what
[44:00] I'd say I'd ask
[44:02] him i' say devil what if it is
[44:07] righten that's I think the Bible will
[44:10] prove that uh you're not going to make
[44:13] it and the Bible proves that I'm going
[44:16] to make it there's no way for you to
[44:18] make it devil you've done so your soul
[44:22] you've done give everything away you had
[44:24] a position in a place but God's give us
[44:27] a position in a place so if that what if
[44:30] comes it comes to everybody we all do we
[44:32] all question
[44:35] things take it back to the word amen
[44:39] take it back to the word of God the word
[44:40] of God will always correct the error
[44:42] always all right everybody with me amen
[44:46] and then if you don't understand
[44:47] something just keep just keep plugging
[44:49] along keep plugging along it it's going
[44:53] to be that you know when I was 12 13 14
[44:55] years old and I I didn't have the the
[44:57] new birth but I understood a little bit
[44:58] of the Bible I understood I understood
[45:00] enough of the message of the hour to
[45:01] know that it was
[45:03] true but Paul said you can know all
[45:05] Mysteries and not have charity and be
[45:06] what a sounding brass and a tinkling
[45:08] symbol and you're going to go to hell if
[45:10] you're not born again you know so you
[45:12] can come up here and you can preach all
[45:13] the great Mysteries if you want to but
[45:15] there's a certain point that God's going
[45:17] to not let you go any
[45:19] further cuz the devil can go listen can
[45:22] he not quote the Bible can he not pass
[45:25] out spiritual gifts can he not
[45:29] preach but he can't reveal the word of
[45:32] God I'm saying listen he can't reveal
[45:34] the true word of God to us because
[45:38] everything he brings us has to be false
[45:41] now have some truth but somewhere it's
[45:44] got to be
[45:45] false I was listening yesterday at a
[45:48] commentator on radio he said U my kids
[45:52] always said I want to be free you know I
[45:54] want to get away I want to be free I
[45:55] want to get out of this message thing I
[45:58] want to get out of there I Want to Be
[46:00] Free he said well he said you know if
[46:02] you take a a
[46:04] locomotive several hundred th000 pounds
[46:06] full
[46:07] locomotive and you set it
[46:14] free take that big old train that comes
[46:17] down through here all the time and set
[46:18] it free no
[46:21] tracks what a disaster it would be there
[46:25] has to be some stability in life CA
[46:29] train tracks to keep you and you say
[46:32] well and the conductor is saying praise
[46:34] the lord it's there I don't want to be
[46:36] free to go through the woods or go
[46:38] through somebody's house or go through
[46:40] the I want to have some kind of
[46:41] structure so you and I must have some
[46:43] kind of structure that's why we need to
[46:46] teach our
[46:47] kids the
[46:49] truth show them the truth number one you
[46:52] don't have to teach it to them show it
[46:53] to them cuz they'll watch you they watch
[46:56] it all of
[46:57] us so let's continue on so we know that
[47:00] we're we're in a restoration
[47:03] message so let's go to First Corinthians
[47:05] 2:7 but we speak the wisdom of God in a
[47:08] mystery now this is Paul telling the
[47:10] Corinthians but we speak the wisdom of
[47:12] God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[47:15] now Paul calls it hidden
[47:17] wisdom
[47:20] knowledge which God ordained before the
[47:23] world unto our Glory yes sir he didn't
[47:27] say God's glory he said our Glory listen
[47:31] you and I are the glory of
[47:33] God brother Bown said you and I we're
[47:36] the victory Of God we're the we're the
[47:38] thing that God's looking for we're the
[47:41] thing that that Satan don't know
[47:42] anything about cuz he can't be us he can
[47:46] try but he can't be us
[47:48] right when the spirit of God fell a few
[47:51] minutes ago that wasn't a devil in that
[47:53] no no that was God that was God and and
[47:57] the devil you know what he done he I
[47:58] hope he got plastered up against that
[47:59] wall and sent out the
[48:01] door but he didn't you know what he done
[48:03] he come right back into to them but
[48:06] that's okay and that's where you get the
[48:08] what if it's okay it's okay to question
[48:12] but the answer is in the Bible the
[48:14] answer is the prophet message the answer
[48:16] is in the fivefold
[48:17] ministry cuz there the five-fold
[48:19] ministry is given to us to perfect us
[48:23] that are sitting here today yes sir from
[48:25] here back
[48:26] Matthew 13 said he answered and said
[48:28] unto them because it is given unto you
[48:31] now we're talking about the unwritten
[48:32] word because it is given unto you to
[48:35] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[48:37] heaven but to them it's not given so you
[48:41] and I have an unfold we have an
[48:43] Unwritten word like I said before the
[48:45] other day our conversation if we were to
[48:48] go sit down and sit down in front of a
[48:50] and have a we do we have Baptist friends
[48:52] we have Methodist friends it's not bad
[48:54] to have friends that are not in the
[48:55] message sometime excuse me that
[48:58] sometimes that kind of keeps you checked
[49:00] up and let you know what you really
[49:03] believe because they some of them know
[49:06] the scriptures pretty well but you
[49:07] better know them
[49:08] too but the problem is is they know
[49:11] their tradition they know their Dogma
[49:14] they know their Creed you and I know no
[49:17] Creed but Christen as brother Brown said
[49:20] no law but love no book but the
[49:23] Bible but you can sit and talk to them
[49:26] and we can me and brother Aaron can talk
[49:27] about the word of God what happened in
[49:29] the garden and different things people
[49:30] sit around you and they're
[49:32] like I don't understand that right now
[49:35] why don't
[49:37] they because of misinterpreted Theology
[49:39] of what they believe now I'm talking
[49:41] about Christian so nominal Christians
[49:43] and we all got the friends that are like
[49:45] that and most of the time that you'll
[49:47] start talking about something they'll
[49:49] go oh really it don't happen to you you
[49:52] give them something strong enough and
[49:53] they'll go or they won't go this they'll
[49:56] go I think I need
[49:59] to why because the two Spirits Clash not
[50:02] the person the person may love you and I
[50:05] I have some denominational people that I
[50:07] love them they're good to be around but
[50:09] when you start talking word to them
[50:11] that's where the two Spirits that's
[50:12] where there's an Unwritten word that
[50:14] they've never seen before you and I have
[50:16] seen exactly what we've seen exactly
[50:20] what's in God's mind nothing
[50:23] different exactly it come from God
[50:26] that's right
[50:27] that's our
[50:29] privilege he's only going to tell the
[50:31] secrets to his
[50:32] people Romans 16 verse 25 now the himym
[50:36] that is of power to establish you
[50:38] according to what my gospel Paul said
[50:42] and the preaching of Jesus Christ
[50:43] according to the revelation of the
[50:46] mystery which was Kept Secret since the
[50:50] world began
[50:53] amen but
[50:54] now but now
[50:57] is made manifest and by the scriptures
[51:00] of the prophets according to the
[51:02] Commandment of the Everlasting God made
[51:04] known to All Nations for The Obedience
[51:07] of faith we had a Prophet come in the
[51:09] end time why the prophet have to come
[51:11] because a prophet hears directly from
[51:14] God Amen he doesn't take anybody else's
[51:16] opinion he hears directly from God now
[51:18] listen let's just be frank brother ramam
[51:20] had his own
[51:21] opinion brother mam had his own opinion
[51:24] but God corrected it now I don't have it
[51:26] here I got it back there in the in the
[51:28] room where brother R was talking about
[51:29] these Hidden Mysteries I'm not bringing
[51:31] it today but he said these things were
[51:34] not
[51:35] right until the seals
[51:38] open that's the unwritten word that was
[51:40] part of God that now he's unfolded in
[51:43] the end time couldn't open the seals to
[51:44] nobody else but us right so the
[51:46] revelation of Jesus Christ now the Greek
[51:48] word for Revelation is apocalypse which
[51:51] means the unveiling so the Book of
[51:52] Revelations is what the unveiling of God
[51:55] but remember it's not also the unveiling
[51:57] of God is the unveiling of me and
[51:59] you what brother BR what brother brother
[52:02] brownan what brother Dale tell us that
[52:03] the re Book of Revelations it's the
[52:04] bride's
[52:06] book it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[52:08] and a group of people all
[52:12] right this unveiling is perfectly
[52:14] described in the example of a sculptor
[52:17] unveiling his work of stat of
[52:19] Statuary exposing it to the
[52:22] onlooker remember the statue was already
[52:24] there right the stat was always
[52:28] there but after the master sculptor got
[52:30] finished you know knocking all the the
[52:32] rough P pieces off of it and shining it
[52:34] up he hid
[52:36] it it's still there but it was hid from
[52:39] the world and then it was what it was
[52:41] unveiled it's an uncovering revealing
[52:44] what was previously hidden so that's
[52:47] what we're getting into that's why we're
[52:49] this transition to Perfection is is
[52:51] there's not any error in the true word
[52:54] of God so we've got to get all the error
[52:57] that we think thought was is might be
[53:03] out cuz remember I told you before Jesus
[53:05] never spoke false
[53:07] Doctrine
[53:09] ever he was the word yes you say oh well
[53:13] he did this and he did
[53:15] that he was the
[53:17] word when he drove those people out of
[53:19] the temple he was the word when he
[53:21] called them people Snakes in the Grass
[53:23] and Devils your father's different from
[53:25] mine that was God
[53:27] all right that wasn't now listen that
[53:29] wasn't Jesus's
[53:31] opinion right he was almighty
[53:34] God what his opinion him and the father
[53:37] never had a problem with each other now
[53:38] you and I we have a problem sometimes
[53:40] come on let one more time everybody
[53:42] raise hand the ones of you that didn't
[53:44] you L it's
[53:46] uncovering
[53:48] exposed it's an uncovering revealing
[53:51] what was previously hidden now the
[53:54] uncovering now watch the uncovering is
[53:56] not only the revelation of the person of
[54:00] Christ
[54:01] right but it's the revelation of his
[54:04] Future Works in the oncoming seven
[54:06] church now what is the seven Church ages
[54:08] his bride his people so they're going to
[54:11] unfold or manifest Jesus Christ through
[54:14] the church ages but here we're at the
[54:16] very end we got to manifest all of them
[54:18] we get all the good we get all the bad
[54:20] everything's piled up right here all
[54:22] right everybody with me so now
[54:24] listen brother M says
[54:27] look you shall recall I mentioned at the
[54:29] beginning of this message this book
[54:31] we're studying is the actual revelation
[54:32] of Jesus now remember in the church and
[54:35] his work in the future ages so the Book
[54:37] of Revelations John was able to see and
[54:40] write what he saw of everything has
[54:42] happened right up to today and then plus
[54:45] amen all right then I mentioned that it
[54:49] takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[54:50] Revelation or we will fail to get it you
[54:54] see I want you to understand something
[54:55] and we'll get into later on there's a
[54:59] transition God will
[55:01] allow false
[55:04] Doctrine for a
[55:07] time he did with Luther but Luther
[55:10] wasn't to come to
[55:11] Perfection right or his call wasn't to
[55:14] perfect a group of people Wesley's call
[55:17] was not to yeah it perfected them in
[55:18] their age but I'm talking about body
[55:20] change I'm talking about the unwritten
[55:22] word I'm talking about coming up where
[55:23] the seals are open they didn't have any
[55:26] of that
[55:26] they preached the best they could and it
[55:28] was by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[55:31] but yet the Holy Ghost was bound by
[55:33] their false tradition and listen the
[55:35] Holy Ghost is bound today by our false
[55:38] Traditions it's bound by our false
[55:41] thinking brother BR said he was bound at
[55:43] what the door of Creeds and dogmas well
[55:46] that a Creed and Dogma outside of the
[55:48] word is wrong and you become it if you
[55:52] believe
[55:53] it brother rown told us he said we
[55:55] become the word is what we receive the
[55:57] word yes amen so we got to receive it
[56:00] can't get it off somewhere now listen
[56:02] brother randam and Paul they could go to
[56:03] the back side of the desert because
[56:05] they're prophets and God can reveal
[56:07] things to them and they bring it out
[56:09] here you and I don't go out in the
[56:11] middle of the desert or the middle of
[56:12] the woods and sit there with a pen and a
[56:15] pencil right you'll be scribbling and
[56:17] falling
[56:18] asleep now God may give you something
[56:20] I'm not saying but I'm telling you a
[56:22] prophet is
[56:24] different a prophet is aone with God I
[56:27] don't want that
[56:30] office that's right brother R didn't
[56:32] want it all he wanted to remember what
[56:34] he wanted to do he wanted to go out
[56:35] there and and come back out here and go
[56:37] do different things and God said no you
[56:39] go stay with your people that's right
[56:41] cuz he was a prophet of the people he
[56:43] was a prophet of the Gentiles bringing
[56:46] these two thoughts together you will see
[56:47] that it won't take just ordinary study
[56:49] and thinking to make this book real it's
[56:51] going to take the operation of the Holy
[56:53] Ghost that means the book can't be
[56:55] revealed to any one but a special class
[56:58] of people you are that special class of
[57:04] people remember a prophet prophesies
[57:07] what he
[57:09] sees that's right A lot of people and
[57:13] it's it's not funny but it is you know
[57:15] brother rown said I went beyond the
[57:16] curtain of time and I saw all y'all
[57:18] there he didn't see them individually he
[57:21] saw his bride there he saw the people
[57:23] that were under his message there he
[57:25] didn't say I saw you Donny F Bush you
[57:27] know like can people get on to you and
[57:28] they go I I've never met you oh yeah we
[57:31] met before the foundation of world no
[57:32] that ain't
[57:33] right no we were nothing that's right
[57:36] only in the mind of God we had to come
[57:39] here to develop we come here developed
[57:41] and we can look at each other and say we
[57:43] both have the mind of God because we
[57:44] both are in agreement with the doctrines
[57:46] of the word of God but not that we met
[57:48] somewhere that's
[57:49] Mormon that's Mormon doctrine of
[57:51] pre-existence of souls they just don't
[57:53] know that Mormon Doctrine is we were all
[57:56] in heaven in spirit form right everybody
[57:59] with me amen I had two Mormons at work
[58:01] for me I know exactly they gave me all
[58:02] kind of stuff books and bibles and all
[58:05] that stuff and I'm sorry it just ain't
[58:08] right but we were all up there and we
[58:10] were all you know we were all wanting to
[58:11] glorify the father and we come up with
[58:13] this plan and the devil had his people
[58:15] and he come up with his plan and God
[58:17] said well I'm just going to send y'all
[58:18] down to earth and then you know we well
[58:20] I pick Jesus over the devil so I'm going
[58:22] to go down there and and die for you and
[58:24] then y'all going to just develop again
[58:31] right I'd rather just believe that I was
[58:33] in the mind of God locked up sealed knew
[58:39] what I was going to do knew I would love
[58:42] him when I got here knew I would accept
[58:44] this message and then as the Bible says
[58:47] in continuous were we fashioned one
[58:50] right after the other we came born in
[58:52] sin shapen in iniquity a spouse from our
[58:55] mother's womb a liar that's right doom
[58:58] and on our way to hell but praise God we
[59:02] heard from that
[59:05] representation and that representation
[59:07] call my name it called your name one day
[59:09] and said Come On Son come on daughter
[59:14] amen where were you when the sons of God
[59:18] shouted for joy in the mind of God
[59:21] absolutely but not a bunch of people
[59:22] running around listen you didn't
[59:24] pre-exist right only in the mind of God
[59:27] did you
[59:28] pre-exist remember he took the picture
[59:30] and he hung it up well where'd he hang
[59:31] it up he hung it up in his mind he
[59:34] didn't hanging up somewhere on a wall he
[59:36] hung it up in his
[59:39] mind and our very youthful best and then
[59:44] he come and let us develop all the way
[59:45] down here and guess what yes amen we're
[59:47] going right back to what that party
[59:49] thought right but we still got life down
[59:51] here folks and we got to struggle and
[59:54] get through this thing right you got to
[59:56] know one thing for sure that you have
[59:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your
[1:00:00] soul not an anointing in your soul if
[1:00:04] you got an anointing in your soul that
[1:00:06] is God that is the word and that cannot
[1:00:09] deny itself that's right amen that's why
[1:00:12] that's why that when brother Ram came to
[1:00:14] those seals he said now I see why I
[1:00:16] hated that denomination so much why it
[1:00:18] kept people from getting a new birth
[1:00:20] right cuz I'll say one more time if
[1:00:22] somebody gets a new birth you might get
[1:00:24] hatched under an egg some under a an egg
[1:00:26] under a
[1:00:27] dog right but you won't stay there once
[1:00:30] you hear that eagle cry once you hear
[1:00:33] one thing about this message you'll have
[1:00:36] to come to it you'll have to look and
[1:00:38] say that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:00:40] give me some
[1:00:42] more give me some more I've eat enough
[1:00:45] of this
[1:00:47] garbage I want some of that kind of
[1:00:49] food fresh meat yes sir oh praise the
[1:00:53] Lord what he's done for us folks good we
[1:00:56] can sit here and talk about Mysteries
[1:00:57] all he want to but let's talk about
[1:00:59] Salvation let's get saved let's get
[1:01:01] filled of the Holy Ghost and then God's
[1:01:03] going to give us understanding he
[1:01:05] promised he
[1:01:07] would that's why that that baptism is
[1:01:10] with
[1:01:11] promise that's right that baptism is
[1:01:14] with promise I'll give you the Holy
[1:01:16] Ghost you do these things repent number
[1:01:18] one and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:01:20] Christ for remission of your sins and
[1:01:22] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:01:24] Ghost for the promise Paul thank God for
[1:01:26] the promise I thank God for the promise
[1:01:28] every
[1:01:30] day I may not I may not look like it
[1:01:34] sometimes you may not look like it
[1:01:37] sometimes but God didn't
[1:01:40] say I'm going to look at your
[1:01:43] flesh thank
[1:01:45] God he hears our cry through the
[1:01:48] blood we still have to listen I told
[1:01:51] yall the other day brother Brown said we
[1:01:52] are the blood by the spirit that's
[1:01:53] exactly right but you better not get
[1:01:55] yourself out from under it you better
[1:01:58] stay under that thing remember brother
[1:02:00] brandom was under it remember he was
[1:02:01] going to condemn that old woman that was
[1:02:03] sitting in that restaurant he all God
[1:02:06] you to just wipe them off you know what
[1:02:07] you know what God did he
[1:02:10] went come over here and let's get behind
[1:02:13] this door a minute and I want you to
[1:02:14] show I want to show you her no he said I
[1:02:18] want to show you
[1:02:20] you well I'm a prophet of God bless God
[1:02:23] I've got all these signs and wonders and
[1:02:24] I got people following me
[1:02:26] no you know what he done he said I felt
[1:02:27] about like
[1:02:29] that he said every time my sins would
[1:02:31] whack Jesus in the head he said blood
[1:02:33] was flatter he said my
[1:02:35] sins so let's don't ever forget that we
[1:02:38] got to have the blood we've got to have
[1:02:41] that atonement to keep us keep us saved
[1:02:45] you can't get unsaved come on that's
[1:02:48] right once you're saved I believe in in

[1:03:01] hound dog
[1:03:03] life no you didn't get it in the first
[1:03:06] place amen it's going to take the
[1:03:09] operation of the Holy Ghost that means
[1:03:10] this book can't be revealed to anyone
[1:03:13] but a special class of people it will
[1:03:16] take one with prophetic
[1:03:20] Insight right it will require the
[1:03:23] ability to hear from God
[1:03:26] it will require
[1:03:27] Supernatural
[1:03:29] instruction I hope today we come to hear
[1:03:32] some Supernatural
[1:03:34] instruction cuz I'll promise you the
[1:03:36] door's open for it right now the door's
[1:03:39] open for it today to get what you've not

[1:03:44] revelation of Jesus Christ and what he's
[1:03:47] doing not to brother Aaron we saw what
[1:03:50] he's doing to him but to
[1:03:53] me now I'm not a selfish person y'all

[1:03:57] to that I want some of
[1:03:59] that I want some of that amen I want
[1:04:03] some of

[1:05:02] they all went I said I was out there
[1:05:06] too I tell you what God did HL at this
[1:05:10] church when it was a little church and
[1:05:13] it was this was closed off and this was
[1:05:15] the sanctuary right here that was all
[1:05:16] the people that was here we got more on
[1:05:18] the stage now than we had in the first
[1:05:19] service we had we got more playing
[1:05:22] instruments than that I had just bought
[1:05:24] me a new eight track tape player brother
[1:05:27] John new one put it in my 72
[1:05:31] Volkswagen hooked that baby under the
[1:05:34] bottom of it had me some that don't work
[1:05:37] some Ted
[1:05:39] n and some Linda
[1:05:43] ronat somebody stole it while we was at
[1:05:53] church I told Daddy I said somebody
[1:05:55] toldo my my tap player he said
[1:05:59] good cuz he knew what I was listening to
[1:06:02] so we've all had our conversation in
[1:06:03] times past of the lust of the flesh okay
[1:06:05] but now amen come on you can't help
[1:06:08] hearing
[1:06:10] it but let's dance to the word of God
[1:06:13] when that word comes out we need to have
[1:06:16] the same emotion but not with the
[1:06:18] vulgarity amen David danced to the
[1:06:22] Lord he danced
[1:06:27] remember brother R said one time he said
[1:06:29] I started dancing they started dancing
[1:06:31] and I started dancing with them I
[1:06:33] remember that time and I loved to been
[1:06:35] there when when brother brandham got the
[1:06:36] Revelation remember he got a revelation
[1:06:38] of something he said I run around around
[1:06:40] that tree now I feel like that
[1:06:42] sometimes just kind of head around that
[1:06:44] tree you know run around trying to try
[1:06:46] to run off a little energy maybe we'll
[1:06:47] lose some weight doing that but we take
[1:06:50] one with prophetic Insight it will
[1:06:53] require the ability to hear from God
[1:06:55] super natural instruction now we have
[1:06:57] had in this message we have had
[1:07:00] Supernatural
[1:07:02] instruction we had 1,00
[1:07:06] sermons that was our Supernatural
[1:07:09] instruction from god of what to
[1:07:13] do now some of it now look not not
[1:07:16] comparing verse with verse not just
[1:07:19] comparing though that is good but what a
[1:07:22] mystery requires the teaching of the
[1:07:24] spirit it never becomes clear we need
[1:07:26] the Love Letter the in
[1:07:28] between how many times brother R tells
[1:07:30] that like brother
[1:07:32] Ryan sometimes it makes me sick he gets
[1:07:35] just so loveby dby mushy stuff just run
[1:07:38] off the pull
[1:07:40] pit him and Gabby Gabby's
[1:07:44] like I love
[1:07:46] it you know why she's his bride she
[1:07:50] knows what he's talking about he knows
[1:07:53] what she's talking about pray come on
[1:07:55] somebody if we get that we get thr in
[1:07:57] love with God like that go ahead he
[1:08:00] knows what we want we know what he wants
[1:08:02] and we can sit on the front row and
[1:08:04] smile about
[1:08:06] it and feel good cuz you know Ryan gets
[1:08:08] up here and says that and I'm like
[1:08:10] [Laughter]
[1:08:12] again I'm just kidding youall know I'm
[1:08:15] kidding but that's a love that's the
[1:08:17] Love
[1:08:18] Letter that's what God see the I'm sorry
[1:08:21] the denominations read this sometimes
[1:08:23] they just read it to be reading it's
[1:08:25] just a a a a good book to
[1:08:27] read and the Ten Commandments have
[1:08:29] become 10 suggestions they haven't
[1:08:31] become C
[1:08:32] Commandments and it's something we might
[1:08:34] need to do unless we think different yes
[1:08:37] or unless somebody tells us we can do
[1:08:39] different misinterpreted
[1:08:42] theology but you and I we hear from our
[1:08:48] husband we hear and listen we know what
[1:08:51] he
[1:08:52] wants if you're the bride you know I
[1:08:55] mean sister Gabby come
[1:08:57] on she knew what Ron was talking
[1:09:01] about intimately she knew what brother
[1:09:04] Ryan was talking about right why cuz
[1:09:07] they're together they're
[1:09:11] married can't you read this the same
[1:09:14] way can't you read this the same way
[1:09:16] that God's not talking to Abraham or
[1:09:18] Isaac or anybody else he's talking to
[1:09:20] you yes sir he's bringing these promises
[1:09:22] to you yes he's bringing your children
[1:09:25] your husband your wife all these Wayward
[1:09:27] people because what cuz you know there's
[1:09:29] a promise there and you stand on that

[1:09:50] Christ di on the cross none of you
[1:09:52] sitting here saw him at the Resurrection
[1:09:55] Day

[1:10:01] depends on it and by Revelation though
[1:10:04] through the word I can see that it
[1:10:06] happened I can see why it happened when
[1:10:08] it happened and where it
[1:10:10] happened you don't have to convince me
[1:10:12] there was a Resurrection come on if
[1:10:14] you're born again today you are the
[1:10:16] resurrection that's where it's going to
[1:10:18] come from you and I
[1:10:20] amen praise
[1:10:23] God but a mystery requires the teaching
[1:10:25] of the spirit or it never becomes clear

[1:21:15] then the love of God the Holy Ghost
[1:21:17] Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:21] all right now this is not two different
[1:21:23] holy ghosts
[1:21:24] everybody with
[1:21:26] me he didn't write new birth right
[1:21:30] here he wrote Holy
[1:21:32] Spirit now God told him what to write
[1:21:35] right remember he was sitting there
[1:21:36] squirrel hunting he laid his gun down
[1:21:38] had a pencil and paper and he said this
[1:21:39] is where I got this from he may have had
[1:21:42] that time running around the running
[1:21:43] around a tree but down here is your new
[1:21:47] birth then you get a refilling of the
[1:21:49] holy spirit because listen when you come
[1:21:52] to that part of the pyramid that's where
[1:21:54] the faith of the fathers were Peter was
[1:21:56] at that point right here now not here
[1:21:59] but right here he was right there they
[1:22:00] had things working in their life they
[1:22:02] had their Doctrine straight amen amen
[1:22:05] that's what I've been preaching on we
[1:22:07] got to restore that trans that
[1:22:08] transition to Perfection is a transition
[1:22:11] from
[1:22:13] unper to Perfection or from partial
[1:22:16] understanding which they had to a
[1:22:18] perfect understanding you said I can't
[1:22:21] do it see you've already cut yourself
[1:22:23] off right there right brother amen if
[1:22:26] you say I
[1:22:28] can't you can't that's right didn't go
[1:22:32] didn't brother BR tell us didn't God say
[1:22:33] through brother brandham that he can
[1:22:35] only go by what you
[1:22:39] confess he's a high priest of you said
[1:22:42] brother that's healing no that's
[1:22:44] everything he's the high priest of your
[1:22:49] confession I can't do well you can't
[1:22:52] that's right
[1:22:56] who was it Paul said I can do some
[1:22:58] things oh whoa whoa whoa how much all
[1:23:02] means all I can do all things through
[1:23:04] Christ who strengthens me the problem is
[1:23:07] we got to get the strength of Christ by
[1:23:08] doing the things he tells us to
[1:23:13] do being holy people kick the stuff out
[1:23:16] that we don't need amen get rid of stuff
[1:23:19] that what what Paul said all that stuff
[1:23:22] that so easily easily easily besets
[1:23:26] us Paul said easily besets us and let's
[1:23:31] run with ra this patience let race with
[1:23:34] patience look into who the author and
[1:23:36] finisher of our faith sometimes if we
[1:23:38] just read the Bible sometime it will
[1:23:40] help us a lot amen the Holy Ghost Christ
[1:23:43] in the person of the Holy Ghost now
[1:23:45] watch comes upon you in the true baptism
[1:23:48] now what's he talking about it's not
[1:23:50] true versus you had a false baptism your
[1:23:53] new birth is is a true baptism of the
[1:23:55] Holy Ghost that's your new birth that's
[1:23:57] in
[1:23:58] you this is upon
[1:24:01] you remember I preached a long time ago
[1:24:03] about anointings there's different
[1:24:04] anointings for different things today we
[1:24:06] had an anointing we always when we pray
[1:24:08] I pray that God anoint the song leader
[1:24:11] God anoint the song God anoint the
[1:24:13] players God anoint the preacher and God
[1:24:17] anoint the people to come
[1:24:21] here and sometimes honestly
[1:24:24] you wonder are they getting it or you
[1:24:26] wonder if I'm getting
[1:24:28] it both way you don't have to say that
[1:24:31] 11 okay thank you you say Amen anyway
[1:24:34] okay but that's the truth sometimes you
[1:24:36] up here like you're fighting you
[1:24:37] fighting
[1:24:39] yourself you come in some days and
[1:24:41] you're like I should have took a
[1:24:45] vacation but every little
[1:24:48] thing every little thing of God means
[1:24:51] something every little purpose of God
[1:24:54] means something the songs we sang today
[1:24:57] I had it on my heart yesterday when when
[1:24:59] brother Joe sent out that uh email or
[1:25:01] sent out that WhatsApp if anybody had a
[1:25:04] special and I didn't I I was going to
[1:25:07] send there in a message but I thought
[1:25:08] I'll just tell him in the morning he's
[1:25:09] he's always ready to go he don't have to
[1:25:11] practice or or clear his throat he's
[1:25:14] ready to sing why cuz he loves to sing
[1:25:17] and God gave him a gift to sing but I
[1:25:19] want him to sing about Paul and Silas
[1:25:21] because I wanted to church to know that
[1:25:23] we're free
[1:25:26] the story about Paul and Silas they got
[1:25:30] free Moses people they got
[1:25:34] free Daniel in the lies
[1:25:36] Den I heard a preacher the other day
[1:25:38] said man said think about Daniel down in
[1:25:41] that lines Den with all those lines said
[1:25:43] he probably had the best sleep he had he
[1:25:45] just curled up against one of them lines
[1:25:46] and laid his head on their man and it's
[1:25:48] just as soft as everything he said he's
[1:25:49] just slept all night listen when you
[1:25:52] have confidence in God you can sleep in
[1:25:53] a lion day
[1:25:56] when you have confidence in God you can
[1:25:57] sleep anywhere you can sleep in a lion's
[1:25:59] den that doesn't bother you it didn't
[1:26:02] bother Daniel I don't believe he I don't
[1:26:04] believe it bothered him I believe he saw
[1:26:06] that he was going to make it through now
[1:26:08] you and I going to have to see the same
[1:26:09] thing that we make it
[1:26:10] through well I don't see there we go I I
[1:26:14] don't believe that I'm this and I'm that
[1:26:16] I'm too old I'm too this I'm too that
[1:26:18] God never said in here he never said
[1:26:20] anything about being old except that we'
[1:26:22] get gray hair and have
[1:26:26] wisdom he didn't saying I'm going to I'm
[1:26:28] going to deal with the young people and

[1:27:20] there ever was the darkest there ever

[1:27:34] people
[1:27:36] right we got to know where we stand amen
[1:27:40] all right you get all these virtues
[1:27:42] sealed in you then God lives in a
[1:27:44] tabernacle now it wasn't that he didn't
[1:27:46] live in
[1:27:47] before but he's being able now to fully
[1:27:50] Express himself yes right there because
[1:27:54] headstone we're going to get to all that
[1:27:55] The Headstone is love now we're going to
[1:27:57] read it here in just a few minutes I may
[1:27:58] be a little bit lengthy today but that's

[1:28:14] we had a room big enough to where you
[1:28:16] could run all the way around
[1:28:18] it if you do it in the Lord it it'll
[1:28:21] help somebody Maybe
[1:28:24] I want to be happy with what who we are

[1:28:38] that I got to do this got to do that I
[1:28:40] got to go to church no I want to go to
[1:28:44] church when a man possesses these kinds
[1:28:46] of things possesses now I want to be
[1:28:48] possessed by that devil I mean that that
[1:28:50] God not that devil see there when a man
[1:28:53] possesses these things then the Holy
[1:28:56] Ghost comes upon him no matter you might
[1:28:58] speak with tongues now watch you might
[1:29:00] impersonate any gift that God's Got You
[1:29:01] might do that but until these virtues
[1:29:05] here go into you you're still off the
[1:29:08] real true foundation of Faith but when
[1:29:10] these virtues grow in you and you added
[1:29:14] that to it then you are a living
[1:29:17] Monument you are a living moving
[1:29:22] Idol brother Brown 1962 now watch he
[1:29:26] beats every Creed every denomination
[1:29:28] every man made Dogma until he sees his
[1:29:30] own reflection on life reflecting in you
[1:29:33] if I do not the works of my father
[1:29:35] believe me not see if what is purposed
[1:29:37] to the church now watch if what is
[1:29:39] purpos to the church the life that was
[1:29:42] in Christ isn't reflecting in you don't
[1:29:45] you stand still if you haven't got
[1:29:48] patience virtue and all these things
[1:29:49] Temperance and all these things
[1:29:51] godliness brotherly kindness now watch
[1:29:53] and all these things that's
[1:29:55] required of
[1:29:58] you
[1:30:00] required Brother Richard
[1:30:02] Roberts uh he came down here to marry my
[1:30:07] sister he had
[1:30:10] intentions but when he came down here he
[1:30:12] told Dad he
[1:30:13] said I never was taught these virtues
[1:30:16] was required is that
[1:30:17] right he said I never thought nobody
[1:30:19] ever taught me now he's been the message
[1:30:21] since he was a kid
[1:30:24] I a lot of y'all shaking your head too
[1:30:26] they're required it's required teaching
[1:30:29] brother M didn't just waste his time on
[1:30:30] that great message the statue of perfect
[1:30:34] man that's required of you no matter
[1:30:37] what you've done no matter how much
[1:30:39] youve shouted how many churches you've
[1:30:40] joined and how many feathers youve
[1:30:42] pinned in yourself don't do it wait till
[1:30:45] genuinely from your heart you can
[1:30:49] forgive till in your heart you have
[1:30:51] brotherly kindness no matter if you pull
[1:30:53] a handful of beer from one side you turn
[1:30:55] the cheek with sweetness until these
[1:30:57] virtues no matter what they say to you
[1:30:59] remembering the Lord now watch if this
[1:31:02] is 1963 this is after he preach that if
[1:31:04] there anything lacking with us let's get
[1:31:07] back to
[1:31:08] it let's remember what he
[1:31:11] required not what we think we ought to
[1:31:17] haveen well I'm so spiritual I don't
[1:31:19] have to be here five minutes before the
[1:31:20] church opens well you got you got a
[1:31:23] spirit on you that's for sure amen let's
[1:31:26] remember what he required not what we
[1:31:29] think we ought to have but what he said
[1:31:33] we've got to have and look we got to
[1:31:36] have it that
[1:31:37] way well I want it my way well go ahead
[1:31:40] it won't be God's way that's right amen
[1:31:43] he remember he said my ways are not your
[1:31:45] ways my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:31:47] my thoughts are higher but I'm going to
[1:31:48] tell you something when you get in
[1:31:50] Christ your thoughts are going to be
[1:31:52] right there with his
[1:31:54] now remember now look Adam before the
[1:31:56] fall his thoughts were the thoughts of
[1:31:59] God come on somebody he named all the
[1:32:02] animals he had control of all the Earth
[1:32:03] and God never said no stop don't do that
[1:32:05] he said That's My Boy Adam keep going
[1:32:08] keep naming them animals that's exactly
[1:32:09] what was in my mind why because he had
[1:32:11] the mind of
[1:32:13] God you and I have to get back to that
[1:32:16] like Brother Richard Wilson said this
[1:32:17] message is going to take us back across
[1:32:19] the chasm of that fall that we're in and
[1:32:23] take us back to the Garden of Eden all
[1:32:26] God was he poured into Christ Christ he
[1:32:28] pour into church take her back to the
[1:32:31] Garden of Eden you said I don't know how
[1:32:33] that see there you go right I do know
[1:32:36] how right that Garden of Eden has got to
[1:32:39] start in you firsten you got to get your
[1:32:42] garden right first you got to get your
[1:32:44] soil right first once you get your soil
[1:32:47] right don't worry about mine you get
[1:32:50] yours right
[1:32:55] let's remember what he required not what
[1:32:58] we think we ought to
[1:33:01] have so Hebrews 6 say therefore leaving
[1:33:04] the principle the doctrine of Christ let
[1:33:06] us go into Perfection now boy you
[1:33:08] talking about somebody that that that
[1:33:09] had to depend on God because what he
[1:33:12] wrote in the this is Paul what he wrote
[1:33:14] in the New Testament think about this
[1:33:17] what he wrote in the New Testament was
[1:33:19] not written in the Old Testament
[1:33:25] or it wouldn't be a new testament he'd
[1:33:27] have just copied he'd just copied the
[1:33:29] Old Testament brought over here and said
[1:33:31] here no it was new amen but it came out
[1:33:35] of yes the written word that was already
[1:33:38] back there the Torah the prophets and
[1:33:41] all those different things so Paul knew
[1:33:43] that there was a principle that we need
[1:33:45] to live by but that we need to go on to
[1:33:48] that Unwritten part that the world can't
[1:33:51] see the world can't understand think
[1:33:53] we're crazy praise
[1:33:57] God if I'm going to lose my mind I want
[1:33:59] to lose it with God I don't want to lose
[1:34:01] it in the
[1:34:06] world we know
[1:34:08] we leaving means to go to another place
[1:34:11] it's not when we leave here and go home
[1:34:13] or go to this place doesn't dissolve
[1:34:15] right it's still here so we build on
[1:34:18] this and move on and the principles is
[1:34:21] everything that we all the principles
[1:34:22] just like I saying all the conduct order
[1:34:24] and Doctrine if we don't get those
[1:34:25] things right don't think you can
[1:34:27] understand everything else cuz you let
[1:34:29] me tell you why you know why cuz number
[1:34:32] one I'm GNA preach on it and remind you
[1:34:34] about it and number two the devil's
[1:34:37] going to remind you about it that's
[1:34:39] right God's going to remind you about
[1:34:42] it right am
[1:34:48] amen Aon you probably need to come up
[1:34:50] here and sing just one more
[1:34:52] time some have lost the
[1:35:01] spirit so the devil starts
[1:35:04] out remember in the O in the old ages in
[1:35:07] the in the time of the of the uh Nan
[1:35:13] Council they knew about the Old
[1:35:15] Testament they knew of Paul's writings
[1:35:17] and they probably had some of the
[1:35:18] writings cuz that's what they used I
[1:35:20] mean listen the Catholics the Catholics
[1:35:22] didn't even write their own Bible they
[1:35:24] just put it in Latin so nobody can
[1:35:25] understand it right they didn't deny the
[1:35:28] Bible but it wasn't put together to
[1:35:30] later but they had pieces of it remember
[1:35:31] the Latin Vulgate is the only way we got
[1:35:33] it to give it to King George I mean King
[1:35:37] James to write the Bible you're looking
[1:35:40] at now it came from the Roman Catholic
[1:35:42] church so they had all these writings
[1:35:44] but what did they do they put false
[1:35:45] teaching in it the devil come in and
[1:35:47] said okay no that's not right we need to
[1:35:49] what the Saints uh yeah you need to pray
[1:35:52] to them cuz they're wonderful Mary Mary
[1:35:56] uh um ascended you know resurrected with
[1:35:59] Jesus and she ascended and she's a
[1:36:00] mother of god well that all came from
[1:36:03] the Bible some piece of it did but not
[1:36:07] the truth of it amen listen they saw
[1:36:10] their Unwritten part but they didn't see
[1:36:13] our Unwritten part amen then that
[1:36:16] Doctrine become incarnate in a false
[1:36:18] prophet but now remember just as the
[1:36:21] devil does his deed saying deed
[1:36:26] Doctrine so do you and
[1:36:29] I when you come into justification you
[1:36:32] you've heard something maybe you hadn't
[1:36:34] heard before and something stirring in
[1:36:36] your heart it won't won makes you come
[1:36:38] back right amen am I speaking to
[1:36:41] somebody makes you come back there
[1:36:43] something is like cuz how many times
[1:36:44] have you told people about this
[1:36:47] message that's right and it's just like
[1:36:49] hitting the wall amen but sometimes
[1:36:52] though when somebody goes the L comes on
[1:36:55] and I'll promise you when they come back
[1:36:57] and say where'd you get that from or how
[1:36:59] did you see that they're at least
[1:37:01] wanting to know
[1:37:03] something so what are you going to do
[1:37:05] from a saying it becomes a deed
[1:37:08] something we do and then it becomes our
[1:37:10] Doctrine and that Doctrine is who you
[1:37:12] are
[1:37:13] today we either have the doctrine of
[1:37:15] Christ or the doctrine of the devil one
[1:37:17] of the two all
[1:37:19] right now he never went to Israel he
[1:37:21] went to Rome so listen to right
[1:37:24] here where' that first Doctrine come
[1:37:26] from outside the Bible it came from Rome
[1:37:28] it didn't come from Heaven didn't come
[1:37:30] from Jesus didn't come from the
[1:37:31] disciples it came from Rome it came from
[1:37:34] a
[1:37:35] pope they started
[1:37:37] accepting
[1:37:39] Dogma now second
[1:37:41] Peter listen to Just a second now we're
[1:37:44] coming to a new we have never seen this
[1:37:48] Earth just for a second we've never seen
[1:37:50] this Earth fully restored right
[1:37:54] right cuz I'm looking at your Earth not
[1:37:56] fully
[1:37:58] restored we're
[1:38:00] connected all right we're connected so
[1:38:03] when when Adam fell the animals fell the
[1:38:06] Earth fell right and it became
[1:38:09] chaos I mean cha you see it tornadoes
[1:38:13] where they never have been before
[1:38:14] somebody had a tornado the other day in
[1:38:16] January never had one before in their
[1:38:18] life and had one in
[1:38:19] January do you know there's a I think
[1:38:22] there's a website something about about
[1:38:23] earthquakes but there's like 7 or 800
[1:38:26] earthquakes a day happening around the
[1:38:28] world yes the one just happened the
[1:38:31] other day in along the Mississippi River
[1:38:33] you read about that it was pretty tough
[1:38:36] too I mean it shook a lot of
[1:38:37] stuff you know why because it's not in
[1:38:40] its right to be conditioned right amen
[1:38:42] if you'll read birth pains brother rme
[1:38:44] tells you the world is rocking and
[1:38:46] reeling yes you know why because we're
[1:38:48] not back to our right to be conditioned
[1:38:50] you and I are the one that's going to
[1:38:52] bring it back right
[1:38:53] the first Adam and the first Eve could
[1:38:55] not do it the second Adam and the second
[1:38:58] Eve is going to restore it
[1:39:00] back but
[1:39:04] tell them
[1:39:06] that walk up to somebody and
[1:39:08] say I am where God
[1:39:12] dwells at this moment yeah I'd laugh
[1:39:15] to I am where God dwells right I am a
[1:39:19] chosen of God I am Eternal in my soul
[1:39:24] I know what God Said from the beginning
[1:39:26] I have the mind of that God and if you
[1:39:29] make it that
[1:39:31] far they might listen but most time
[1:39:34] they've done called you a heretic and
[1:39:35] run off or either get some mad they want
[1:39:38] to fight you so you don't do it you do
[1:39:39] it kind of far away from when you tell
[1:39:41] them that oh yeah but honestly that's
[1:39:43] who we are right that's right what I
[1:39:45] just said that's exactly what we are we
[1:39:48] are the children of God we are the
[1:39:50] Perfection of God we are the final voice
[1:39:52] of the final age
[1:39:53] there is no other age there is no other
[1:39:56] voice it's in a bride so if you're a
[1:39:58] bride it's in you go tell the world
[1:40:01] that oh no it's said over here no it's
[1:40:04] over here no it's over here Jesus told
[1:40:06] us he said hey he said there'll come a
[1:40:08] time when they're false
[1:40:10] Christ not false Jesus is false Jesus
[1:40:14] told us this in Matthew 24 there'll come
[1:40:17] false Christ and say hey hey I'm uh
[1:40:20] Christ is over
[1:40:21] here he said don't go go he said oh
[1:40:24] Christ is over here he said don't go why
[1:40:27] you better know that Christ is in
[1:40:29] you to lead and guide you where he wants
[1:40:32] you to go not where man wants you to go
[1:40:35] see that's the unwritten part how many
[1:40:36] of you can understand that we are living
[1:40:40] totally Unwritten word of
[1:40:42] God we have listen we don't do away with
[1:40:45] this you can't you can't make it other
[1:40:47] stuff like polygamy and you
[1:40:49] sorry that's right the unwritten part
[1:40:52] those Thunders are not they're Unwritten
[1:40:53] but they John was going to write them
[1:40:55] down but they're hid in this right here
[1:40:57] but remember brother brandham said that
[1:41:00] the Thunder of God was me and
[1:41:02] you thousands of lived voices people
[1:41:07] have made it everything else amen but me
[1:41:10] and you right it's not going to be
[1:41:13] there's not going to be another Cloud
[1:41:15] that's right amen there's not going to
[1:41:17] be another Seven Peaks right there's not
[1:41:20] going to be another earthquake like it
[1:41:22] was in in
[1:41:24] Alaska right that's all
[1:41:28] done with
[1:41:30] me but we believe
[1:41:33] that and our foundational truths are
[1:41:36] proven by these signs in the
[1:41:38] heaven but if I don't have the new birth
[1:41:41] and I take that
[1:41:43] cloud that's why people can't understand
[1:41:46] it you can say all you want to about
[1:41:48] them people that went away from the
[1:41:49] message I'll tell you one more time they
[1:41:51] were not born again right
[1:41:59] amen listen I didn't need that cloud to
[1:42:02] get born
[1:42:03] again that's right but when I got born
[1:42:05] again I relate to that cuz that was
[1:42:09] Christ coming down to
[1:42:11] me me so brother BR said according to
[1:42:15] Malachi 4 and Revelations 107 The Mighty
[1:42:18] angel came down with a open book in his
[1:42:22] hand and gave it to me
[1:42:25] amen folks he never gave it to that
[1:42:28] seventh angel
[1:42:30] messenger he gave it to
[1:42:32] John now the seventh angel messenger
[1:42:35] told him what to do or the seventh angel
[1:42:37] messenger was there remember brother BR
[1:42:40] said while the seventh angel messenger
[1:42:42] is here on Earth at the time of his
[1:42:43] coming that coming absolutely amen but
[1:42:46] remember it was brother R didn't just
[1:42:47] take it with him
[1:42:50] right I'm going to skip something we'll
[1:42:52] get to that and then we'll close
[1:42:58] talking about a change in his ministry
[1:42:59] now brother R I'm talking about a change
[1:43:01] in his ministry and that's what we're
[1:43:02] going to get to just for a few minutes
[1:43:04] there was a change but now watch brother
[1:43:06] random and his Humanity you got to think
[1:43:09] that he had come from a healing campaign
[1:43:12] from
[1:43:12] 1947
[1:43:14] to 1958 11 years he'd been watching the
[1:43:19] sick healed he had watched coming from
[1:43:21] holding them by the hand to telling them
[1:43:24] the very secrets of their heart all
[1:43:26] right he said there's now going to be a
[1:43:28] change in my
[1:43:31] Ministry I would take left my left hand
[1:43:33] and lay it on the person right hand and
[1:43:36] not use my own voice and it would speak
[1:43:38] out and tell them what was wrong with
[1:43:40] him brother R says the holy spirit says
[1:43:43] then you if you be be sincere it'll come
[1:43:45] to a place where you'll know the very
[1:43:47] secrets of the heart how many of you
[1:43:49] that was in my first meetings heard me
[1:43:50] tell that before it ever come to pass if
[1:43:53] you'll continue on to be sincere it'll
[1:43:54] grow greater and greater now here's what
[1:43:57] we're going to have a little bit of
[1:43:58] maybe
[1:44:00] conflict brother Brandon was looking at
[1:44:02] his Healing Ministry getting
[1:44:04] stronger
[1:44:08] right but that was not it in his
[1:44:11] Humanity that's what he thought right
[1:44:15] because he keeps on saying he said I'll
[1:44:16] just speak
[1:44:19] it and it'll happen well that is what
[1:44:22] the third poll is
[1:44:23] but it's not in a prayer line it's in
[1:44:26] his people now watch it will be a new
[1:44:29] ministry this ministry will never cease
[1:44:31] he didn't quit praying for the
[1:44:33] sick it will continue on this first will
[1:44:36] continue on still just the same God
[1:44:39] gives gifts he never takes them away in
[1:44:40] other words he's not a Indian
[1:44:42] giver all right now watch he's always
[1:44:45] done it like Luther Wesley and on
[1:44:47] down now he tells in 1960 now he's
[1:44:50] coming from 1958 to 1960 still talking
[1:44:53] about a new ministry right he's waiting
[1:44:56] on something in a prayer line um view of
[1:45:00] things all right everybody with me cuz
[1:45:02] he saw the tent and he saw the people
[1:45:04] going into the tent and and getting
[1:45:08] healed but you got to remember you and I
[1:45:12] and any denomination that was during the
[1:45:14] time brother random was there their body
[1:45:17] was
[1:45:19] hurting they needed spiritual healing as
[1:45:22] much as they need a natural healing amen
[1:45:25] with me right be stick with me just for
[1:45:27] a minute all right we'll close right on
[1:45:29] this I won't go any further I'll get it
[1:45:31] to it next
[1:45:32] time now
[1:45:34] right it's not in discernment 1960 he
[1:45:38] talking about his new ministry I cut
[1:45:39] this short discernment I find them
[1:45:41] things out but this is not discernment
[1:45:44] I'm searching for a new ministry all of
[1:45:46] you understand well all right well they
[1:45:49] were looking for and we know he did
[1:45:51] speak the word to Sister media and
[1:45:52] different things like that but that
[1:45:54] wasn't the third
[1:45:57] Paul I'll read it to you in just a
[1:45:59] second real quick first
[1:46:01] poll Healing
[1:46:04] Ministry second poll
[1:46:07] prophecy amen third pull opening of the
[1:46:11] word all right so now we're going to get
[1:46:13] into the pull so don't lose me here it's
[1:46:15] God pulling you to a
[1:46:18] place God will never push you anywhere
[1:46:22] no right amen that's right he's a
[1:46:24] gentleman the Holy Ghost is a
[1:46:26] gentleman everybody with me so he's got
[1:46:28] to pull you into these things so the
[1:46:31] first pull was
[1:46:33] what CAU the little baby fish everybody
[1:46:36] looking oh brother Bram you're a good
[1:46:37] fisherman second pull and then remember
[1:46:39] he got all that tangled up but I'm not
[1:46:41] going to get into that cuz his ministry
[1:46:43] wasn't tangled up I think it was the
[1:46:45] people that was around him they got it
[1:46:47] all tangled up that's
[1:46:50] right so this time there's a new
[1:46:52] Ministry coming ahead now look this is
[1:46:54] 1960 later on in the year
[1:46:59] right now he was going to say I'm going
[1:47:01] to change it tonight see he keeps
[1:47:02] thinking this is something in a prayer
[1:47:05] line now listen that tent you can make
[1:47:09] it whatever you want to you can believe
[1:47:10] it's a natural tent if you want
[1:47:12] to I don't need it to get born
[1:47:15] again I'm born again here I don't need
[1:47:17] to I don't need to go through that
[1:47:18] little thing to make me born
[1:47:20] again maybe for the change of the body I
[1:47:23] don't know but I promise you one
[1:47:26] thing thus that the Lord Brother R ain't
[1:47:28] coming back and telling us something he
[1:47:29] didn't tell us
[1:47:30] already so if he does come back you
[1:47:33] better be ready you better know what
[1:47:35] he's already said and you better be
[1:47:37] identified with Christ and not with
[1:47:41] himly so if he wants to put up tent
[1:47:43] that's
[1:47:45] fine I've never like Dad said he's never
[1:47:48] one way or the other he can bring bring
[1:47:50] if he wants to but if we don't know what
[1:47:51] he said today
[1:47:53] if we don't know what brother brandham
[1:47:54] said today if we're not getting the
[1:47:56] unwritten part today you're not going to
[1:47:57] get it
[1:47:59] there you're going to do just like the
[1:48:01] Pharisees did you think you're you think
[1:48:04] you're so and so you think you're so and
[1:48:09] so so he said I better go back to the
[1:48:11] old ministry tonight because there was a
[1:48:13] lot of new people there and have the new
[1:48:15] ministry start tomorrow evening now it
[1:48:17] didn't but he was wanting it he was he
[1:48:20] was a man he wanted it to happen he fell
[1:48:22] the what he felt the pull of
[1:48:24] God in his ministry but he's he's back
[1:48:27] on the prayer line but remember in 1960
[1:48:31] when he preached the the U individual
[1:48:34] messages of the church
[1:48:37] ages then they compiled it together and
[1:48:40] he said all right this m of Malachi 4 is
[1:48:41] do two things we've read it aund times
[1:48:44] thousand times he found out then what
[1:48:47] his ministry was it
[1:48:50] separated this was getting everybody
[1:48:52] back this was Unwritten this was getting
[1:48:54] everybody back to the faith of fathers
[1:48:56] this was the unwritten part all right
[1:48:59] amen back in
[1:49:01] 1960 the new ministry is to curse the
[1:49:04] disease that's in there have you noticed
[1:49:07] what the holy spirit's done first thing
[1:49:09] when he told me was pray for the sick
[1:49:11] now I
[1:49:12] complained said they won't listen to me
[1:49:15] CU I'm not educated then he said I'll
[1:49:17] give you two gifts right remember of
[1:49:19] Moses he gave Moses two gifts he pulled
[1:49:21] his hand out right so you have to watch
[1:49:23] that I'm trying to hurry up I may have
[1:49:25] to back up later on that becomes
[1:49:28] entertainment that's right if you don't
[1:49:31] believe that then there'll be another
[1:49:32] sign which you was born with you'll see
[1:49:34] the Visions know what the people has
[1:49:36] done and all about them and so
[1:49:39] forth that's the second pull amen
[1:49:44] right then did I tell you that the Lord
[1:49:46] told me that there would be another
[1:49:47] Ministry you remember that which would
[1:49:49] be the Discerning of the thoughts he's
[1:49:51] back to the second one again
[1:49:53] well them Ministries has worked
[1:49:55] perfectly the world around one when its
[1:49:59] day the other one lived this day now a
[1:50:01] little later on if I get chance I want
[1:50:03] to tell you what happened just recently
[1:50:05] bringing in new ministry I'll just speak
[1:50:08] the word
[1:50:10] now prayer
[1:50:12] line you can say that if you want
[1:50:15] to but when he started speaking the word
[1:50:18] of God is when no seals open amen that's
[1:50:21] right most of you older ones agree 100%
[1:50:24] when the seals open that's when he
[1:50:26] started speaking the word and it became
[1:50:29] real to him and to us all right
[1:50:33] everybody okay with
[1:50:35] that cuz he was telling people what was
[1:50:37] wrong with him a long time ago I mean
[1:50:39] back in the 50s and 60 early 60s now
[1:50:42] look he said now the second Ministry is
[1:50:43] leaving the third is entering in I'm so
[1:50:47] glad about it standing in the Gap
[1:50:50] 1963 he never told you a wrong
[1:50:53] interpretation now watch here's a here's
[1:50:54] a
[1:50:56] dream remember Junior Jackson's dream
[1:50:58] we'll close right here he told me that
[1:51:00] he Dreamed a Dream Junior Jackson that
[1:51:03] up here somewhere like in Indiana there
[1:51:05] was a long great grassy Hill and the
[1:51:08] water had washed all the soil off the
[1:51:11] top and it became a rock like a ball top
[1:51:14] on the
[1:51:15] mountain and then in this rock there was
[1:51:18] funny
[1:51:20] riding and said I was stand in there
[1:51:23] with all the Brethren around the church
[1:51:25] here interpreting this writing all right
[1:51:28] hold on right this
[1:51:31] writing that they could
[1:51:33] see
[1:51:35] right then when it come time that I got
[1:51:39] all of it
[1:51:40] interpreted first part of his ministry
[1:51:43] when he got it all interpreted to those
[1:51:47] people then somehow or another if I
[1:51:51] understand the dream right got a hold of
[1:51:52] something like a crowbar or some kind of
[1:51:55] angle bar so what it was
[1:51:57] sealed oh come on
[1:51:59] somebody it was
[1:52:01] sealed you couldn't see what was inside
[1:52:03] there was a written part on the
[1:52:05] outside faith of the fathers was right
[1:52:08] here getting back to the word of God
[1:52:10] getting back to doing the things of God
[1:52:13] then he took a bar a pry bar and cut the
[1:52:18] top off of the mountain like this right
[1:52:20] here took the top off
[1:52:23] and what'd he
[1:52:24] do on the inside of it was White Rock
[1:52:29] something on the order of granite or
[1:52:31] something on that side some White Rock
[1:52:34] now watch that wasn't written
[1:52:39] on Watch and I said Brethren stay here
[1:52:43] and look in on this and while they were
[1:52:46] looking I slipped out from among them
[1:52:47] and started going west brother Jackson
[1:52:49] said he saw me going over one Hill and
[1:52:51] another Hill what he was going back West
[1:52:53] to do what why' he go back West to meet
[1:52:56] those
[1:52:58] angels but remember he had to come back
[1:53:00] to Jeffersonville to preach it but he
[1:53:01] met those angels out there in Arizona
[1:53:04] right he told what the interpretation
[1:53:07] was this was on the outside watch when
[1:53:11] the interpretation was given here at the
[1:53:13] church before it came to pass the time
[1:53:16] is now that I believe that the full
[1:53:18] Revelation through the age of Luther
[1:53:20] Wesley John Smith Alexander Campbell and
[1:53:22] different ones that's preached on the
[1:53:25] Bible and then we got over in the Bible
[1:53:27] and showed that there would be a seventh
[1:53:28] Angel's message and at the sounding of
[1:53:31] the seventh Angel's message all the
[1:53:33] mysteries of God will be made known then
[1:53:35] come seven mysterious Thunders we'll get
[1:53:37] into that later on now we find that in
[1:53:40] this I told you the interpretation on
[1:53:42] the Rock and what The Rock is
[1:53:44] Christ and that was in the brother's
[1:53:47] dream and that's the Bible and for all
[1:53:49] these years the Bible has been
[1:53:51] interpreted till we've absolutely given
[1:53:53] the ecclesiastical interpretation
[1:53:55] through in other words you're not all
[1:53:58] right and the last gift being added in
[1:54:01] the Le of age which is the seventh
[1:54:03] Angel's time to preach in the Le out of
[1:54:07] age at that time that there would be a
[1:54:09] lot of things that was misconstrued down
[1:54:12] Through the Ages Luther preaching
[1:54:14] justification but he let it run wild we
[1:54:16] know how that happened we going down and
[1:54:18] now after the Bible had been interpreted
[1:54:20] completely then you notice it opened up
[1:54:23] the Top of the
[1:54:24] Rock everybody with me we'll get back
[1:54:27] over this again I don't want to confuse
[1:54:28] you this is a dream Junior Jackson had
[1:54:31] brother RS interpreting the dream now
[1:54:33] after the Bible had been interpreted
[1:54:35] what the outside part that man could
[1:54:39] see was interpreted then you notice it
[1:54:42] opened up the top of the pyramid like
[1:54:45] Rock Amen not pyramid teaching the man
[1:54:48] who teaches that I guess they know what
[1:54:50] you're talking about I know nothing
[1:54:51] about it
[1:54:52] but it was the shape of the pyramid but
[1:54:54] the cap on the pyramid was never put on
[1:54:56] I've been in Egypt so watch in the
[1:54:59] church it was the Cornerstone what down
[1:55:01] here Amen in the full church it was a
[1:55:06] headstone right you and I are the full
[1:55:10] church it was a headstone so it never
[1:55:13] did come it was rejected Christ and it
[1:55:15] will come and I believe that when it's
[1:55:18] coming that the church WIll shape into a
[1:55:20] place from justification under Luther
[1:55:22] sanctification under Wesley the
[1:55:24] Pentecostal message will bring the
[1:55:25] church to such a what a
[1:55:28] minority
[1:55:30] amen and a ministry will be among those
[1:55:34] people not one person those people till
[1:55:38] it'll be exactly the same Ministry that
[1:55:40] Jesus Christ did that'll bring Jesus and
[1:55:43] catch the whole thing away
[1:55:47] amen one more time this is a different
[1:55:51] angle
[1:55:52] of the of the U dream brother R told it
[1:55:56] again in the seventh seal then we'll
[1:55:58] close right here and notice the next
[1:56:01] thing now I took some kind of a bar and
[1:56:03] cut it off now remember it was sealed
[1:56:06] right and on the inside was White Rock
[1:56:08] that had nothing wrote on
[1:56:11] it the unwritten
[1:56:13] part and at that time I started to the
[1:56:17] west and I told them all I said don't go
[1:56:20] out west in other words don't follow
[1:56:22] follow me there
[1:56:25] okay there was one dream where junior
[1:56:27] said he was up on like a saucer remember
[1:56:30] that and he said you can't come up here
[1:56:32] only the people that are in other words
[1:56:35] have the anointing can come up here to
[1:56:36] where he's
[1:56:37] at yeah and I think we are that people
[1:56:41] yeah he said I'll ride this Trail again
[1:56:42] well he is he's riding it in us he ain't
[1:56:44] going to come back ride a horse good
[1:56:48] grief shallow
[1:56:53] and I told them I said don't go out west
[1:56:55] stay here and look on this stay here and
[1:56:58] listen to what I'm saying take this
[1:57:01] foundation and and get it
[1:57:03] right stay right
[1:57:06] here he went West for the blast went
[1:57:10] West returned back to the east with the
[1:57:12] Holy Spirit
[1:57:14] interpreting this Unwritten
[1:57:18] word now if that isn't perfectly the God
[1:57:21] almighty I want you to know what it is
[1:57:23] what am I trying to say this for friends
[1:57:25] is to show you we're at the end
[1:57:28] time amen now brother R talks about the
[1:57:31] lure we'll get into that we'll talk
[1:57:33] about the first PLL second pull but I
[1:57:34] want to go down here and tell
[1:57:36] you now remember right here this
[1:57:38] anointing ones at the End Time come on
[1:57:41] musician brother bam is telling the
[1:57:43] dream about the third pole about the
[1:57:45] fish and we'll get into that we'll break
[1:57:46] all that down notice the very day when
[1:57:49] this messenger not when he starts on
[1:57:53] written part amen he didn't come to
[1:57:56] bring the written part He restored the
[1:57:58] written part and then brought the
[1:58:00] unwritten part everybody with me not
[1:58:04] when he starts on but when he begins
[1:58:06] declare his message see the first pull
[1:58:10] healing healing
[1:58:13] campaign second pull prophesying in
[1:58:16] other words telling the people the
[1:58:18] secrets of the heart today I am telling
[1:58:21] you the secret secr of your
[1:58:24] heart if you'll
[1:58:27] listen because what secret in your heart
[1:58:30] that you need I hope God's going to give
[1:58:31] you today question or whatever
[1:58:35] more the first poll healing second Paul
[1:58:39] prophesying what was he prophesying of a
[1:58:42] group of
[1:58:44] people and the third pole the opening of
[1:58:48] the word the Mysteries revealed no more
[1:58:52] there's no more higher order to reveal
[1:58:53] the word than prophets but the only way
[1:58:55] the prophet can be Vindicated is by the
[1:58:57] word and remember the third poll was the
[1:59:00] opening of The Seven Seals his ministry
[1:59:04] the one he'd been looking for since the
[1:59:06] 50s God showed him right there that was
[1:59:09] his last part the third part of his
[1:59:11] ministry was the opening of those seals
[1:59:13] not that he was going to have a greater
[1:59:16] healing campaign the greatest healing
[1:59:18] campaign was is when he preached to us
[1:59:21] let's stand amen when he preached this
[1:59:23] to us it
[1:59:25] caused a shock wave in
[1:59:28] heaven that opened up the way to have
[1:59:34] our body
[1:59:35] change it opened up a way to heal us
[1:59:39] from top of our head to the bottom of
[1:59:41] our feet and it be an eternal healing
[1:59:44] cuz listen you can get healed today and
[1:59:45] be sick tomorrow the way we're in the
[1:59:48] state we are
[1:59:49] now but you can't be healed in your your
[1:59:52] soul and be sick in your soul tomorrow
[1:59:54] yeah you can get things happen to you in
[1:59:55] your spirit
[1:59:57] realm but you can't get the only way the
[2:00:00] prophet can be Vindicated is by the word
[2:00:03] and remember the third pull now what' he
[2:00:04] say the third pull was or the third part
[2:00:07] of his ministry was what the opening of
[2:00:10] The Seven Seals reveal the unwritten
[2:00:13] part or the unwritten word that's been
[2:00:16] sealed in the Bible since the foundation
[2:00:20] of the world what a what a group of
[2:00:22] people we ought to be folks we ought to
[2:00:26] be just so happy Jesus's Ministry had
[2:00:30] three
[2:00:33] polls a lot of people had you and I have
[2:00:37] three polls in your journey you have
[2:00:39] justification you have sanctification
[2:00:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost first poll
[2:00:44] second PLL third pole oh that's just for
[2:00:46] the
[2:00:49] prophet sorry folks we are prophetic
[2:00:52] people he told us we were so whatever he
[2:00:54] said I'm going to believe it that what
[2:00:57] brother brandham got we get he said now
[2:01:00] these things I'll take to my grave and
[2:01:02] people have said all kind of garbage
[2:01:04] about that he might God may have told
[2:01:07] him some things that he did take to his
[2:01:08] grave but it was not for mine and your
[2:01:11] Perfection God's not going to send us
[2:01:13] somebody else to perfect us he gave us a
[2:01:17] message gave us the Holy Ghost and gave
[2:01:18] us a good fivefold Ministry to get us
[2:01:20] there we don't need nothing else
[2:01:25] I mean what else do you need you waiting
[2:01:27] for some great one to come show me that
[2:01:28] in the Bible there's only one great one
[2:01:31] and he already came the world missed
[2:01:34] him that's what he's going to tell the
[2:01:36] people he he's even going to tell the
[2:01:38] Jews you missed it you missed me in my
[2:01:42] first coming you missed me in my second
[2:01:45] coming but I've come back to get you
[2:01:47] because guess what I can't forget you
[2:01:50] cuz you were my first wife
[2:01:53] I can't for forget Israel cuz he said in
[2:01:55] the word he couldn't forget
[2:01:56] Israel you love the Lord he's good to us
[2:01:59] to give us these things he's good to us
[2:02:01] to let us know what is going to happen
[2:02:04] and what's happening right now and it's
[2:02:08] just listen the world's going to fall
[2:02:09] apart we know that yes but the bride's
[2:02:11] not going to fall
[2:02:14] apart God is never fell
[2:02:17] apart and he never will fall apart and
[2:02:20] if it's inside of you guess what you're
[2:02:22] not going to fall apart sure we're going
[2:02:23] to have ups and downs sure we're going
[2:02:24] to have trials and tribulations but God
[2:02:27] said he's going to have a bride yes sir
[2:02:30] that he's going to be able to trust with
[2:02:31] what he
[2:02:32] said and that's what brother Ram in that
[2:02:34] third Ministry he said I'll just speak
[2:02:36] the word well guess what that's what he
[2:02:37] did he spoke it and you and I came
[2:02:41] forth he spoke it and you and I have an
[2:02:43] ability to take a change of a body where
[2:02:46] no one else listen no one else will be
[2:02:49] able to and will ever
