[5:45] or he showed you your in a dream until
[5:48] we meet him in the air and it's good to
[5:51] be here today and uh I've uh I've
[5:55] struggled a lot because I've got a
[5:58] message I'm G to try to I want you to
[6:00] understand I want you to listen to what
[6:01] I'm saying I want you and don't try to
[6:04] get ahead of me and don't try to just
[6:07] listen to what I'm saying amen and God
[6:10] God will bless you with it I believe and
[6:12] uh if you'd uh you'd like to
[6:15] uh let's see if I won't lose my glasses
[6:18] again this
[6:19] time uh I'd like to uh uh read
[6:24] uh 1 Corinthians 14 these some of the
[6:28] same scriptures that I used the last
[6:30] time that I I spoke and uh I want you to
[6:34] you have to read between the lines you
[6:37] have to see between the lines right God
[6:40] spoke to me one time I was sitting in my
[6:42] living room and I was I was studying and
[6:45] I didn't I've told this many times uh I
[6:48] don't know how long I had been in what I
[6:51] was in I don't know if it was a vision I
[6:54] don't know I just know that it was as
[6:56] real as I'm looking at Brother Sam now
[7:00] and all at once he started speaking to
[7:02] me he said I know I listen I had Christ
[7:05] M God reveal land right there at at my
[7:07] foot right there just on my fireplace I
[7:10] so I know what the prophet of God said
[7:12] in the next to the last page of Christ
[7:13] Mr God reveal and I'm going to say but
[7:16] he was speaking to him and he's the only
[7:18] one that se what he saw right and but he
[7:21] has to speak to you glory this is what
[7:24] we're return back to the Eden condition
[7:27] again where he can speak with us and we
[7:29] speak back you know he did say in why
[7:32] Christ speak no church no matter how
[7:35] fundamental it is that church can't
[7:37] Thrive until the Supernatural is made
[7:39] known among us something that we can
[7:41] speak to that'll speak back and
[7:43] vindicate himself now if we if we're not
[7:46] don't find ourself doing these
[7:49] things God help us because God is doing
[7:53] things among us amen and and most time
[7:56] we don't even see it he said the angels
[8:00] of God encamps about those who fear and
[8:02] love the Lord that means that this room
[8:04] is full in all outside everywhere the
[8:07] angels of God is here why because God is
[8:11] in your soul he's on the throne of your
[8:14] life and the angels of God are in Camp
[8:17] about right him and you just happen to
[8:19] be added into it right but uh let me uh
[8:23] let me go ahead and start here let's
[8:24] pray before we start
[8:27] father Lord you know that I can't do
[8:30] anything father without you and Lord
[8:33] neither would I want to do anything
[8:35] without you but father help me to just
[8:38] yield and humble myself before you and
[8:40] surrender to you Lord that you can take
[8:42] these unworthy lips of clay and bring
[8:45] your word to the people and touch the
[8:47] people in a way tonight Lord that that
[8:50] will bring such sincere
[8:53] desperation to see you and to know you
[8:56] as brother Bob preached here the other
[8:58] week
[8:59] have you really we really heard the
[9:02] voice of God CU we know 2000 so years
[9:06] ago you was among the people God
[9:11] himself and they didn't recognize you
[9:13] and the few that did recognize you Lord
[9:16] they they seen it by Revelation and
[9:19] that's what we have to see and hear the
[9:21] voice by Revelation and God you want to
[9:24] speak to us so sincerely and and get us
[9:28] into the position
[9:29] and I believe you can and I believe you
[9:32] will bring us to Rapture and Faith
[9:35] father and bless us tonight Lord God as
[9:37] we Endeavor to to go on with this father
[9:39] and try to show the people something
[9:41] Lord God that you've shown us father in
[9:44] Jesus name amen now Paul Paul's speaking
[9:48] here and and You' think it was uh he was
[9:51] speaking about speaking in tongues you
[9:53] know interpretation but see you got to
[9:56] go a little deeper than that you got you
[9:58] got about to get spiritual like I I
[10:00] started to say a while ago he spoke to
[10:02] me and says being spiritual talking to
[10:06] me you you being spiritual you watch
[10:09] spiritual things right and I realized he
[10:11] was talking to me says if you turn and
[10:14] look at the clock it's a big clock wall
[10:16] clock behind me if you'll turn and look
[10:18] at the clock and it was you know every
[10:20] 15 minutes it it Chimes Chimes Chimes
[10:23] Chim he says it's a he said if you'll
[10:26] turn and look at the clock and it was
[10:27] doing that he said it's exactly 2:00 cuz
[10:31] he went he said the end of
[10:34] the second pull third pull is the hand
[10:36] and I ain't had nothing but troubl ever
[10:38] sense I don't know I I I I believe I
[10:41] know what it was but I tell you right
[10:43] now when Joshua took the people over
[10:46] Jordan and gave them the land they
[10:49] fought for every inch of ground they
[10:51] took now when we read this and and I
[10:55] I've got quite a bit to read tonight but
[10:57] when I read this I I want you to be
[10:59] spiritual
[11:01] now being spiritual and if you got the
[11:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost you can be
[11:06] spiritual and you ought to be spiritual
[11:09] exactly and watch spiritual things and
[11:11] you and you'll recognize that many times
[11:13] he walks right by and we don't recognize
[11:15] it is it is it our fault probably so cuz
[11:19] if one can cause the church to fail one
[11:22] can cause somebody to lose their healing
[11:24] that means it ought to be some sincere
[11:26] right
[11:27] amen
[11:29] praying and and and casting everything
[11:32] the cares of the world away from us cuz
[11:36] it's going to take this to make the
[11:37] Rapture amen and let's get
[11:39] started now Brethren I I if I come to
[11:42] you speaking with tongues what shall I
[11:45] profit you except I shall speak to you
[11:47] either by
[11:49] Revelation or by knowledge or by
[11:51] prophecy or by Doctrine so tongues
[11:54] tongues tongues is it's a gift of God
[11:57] and praise God I've done it I pre appre
[12:00] appreciate God for it I didn't ask for
[12:02] it he just come he just did it you know
[12:05] and that don't make me anything I mean I
[12:07] but but I appreciate him doing that
[12:10] right because he spoke to me in the
[12:11] first person after that and it was seven
[12:13] other people in the room he spoke to
[12:14] them too and now there's two what three
[12:17] three or four that follows what he told
[12:19] us to do so so anyway you can be see I
[12:24] want to continue on with
[12:25] that he says in 1 Corinthians 148
[12:29] 11 for if the trumpet the gospel trumpet
[12:33] if the and and God's got somebody
[12:35] designated to speak he said uh for if
[12:38] the trumpet give an uncertain sound who
[12:41] shall prepare himself to battle right
[12:43] now I'm not talking about going out here
[12:45] fighting Goliath so we got enough
[12:47] Goliath right here in your mind in your
[12:49] brain but see you've got to know the
[12:51] word you've got to you got to know the
[12:53] Mysteries because he said in Revelation
[12:56] 10:7 in the days of the voice of the
[12:58] seventh angel
[12:59] when he shall begin to sound all the
[13:01] Mysteries a l l all the Mysteries would
[13:04] be revealed as he had declared to his
[13:06] servants the prophets and we are we
[13:08] Church you and I this is what God has
[13:11] called us to do let me tell you little
[13:13] something that I sitting there brother
[13:15] there was preaching the other day the
[13:17] other week two or three weeks ago how it
[13:19] was and I and I was thinking
[13:22] about the prophet of God said though is
[13:25] revealed to you there's still a
[13:27] supernatural element not made known to
[13:29] you correct now see see if you can
[13:32] swallow this
[13:34] one Paul went into the into the desert
[13:39] for three and a half years or so studied
[13:41] the Old Testament strolls come out and
[13:44] preach and wrote 14 books under the
[13:46] inspiration of Holy Ghost right and do
[13:48] you know he's a pattern messenger amen
[13:51] he he brother brand used them as a
[13:53] pattern message All Through the Ages you
[13:55] know through the church ages but do you
[13:57] know there was a supernatural your
[13:58] ailment not made to Paul there was
[14:01] reserved for you and me and that's what
[14:03] you and I are called
[14:04] to exactly we're called to bring the
[14:08] Rapture into effect amen we're to be so
[14:12] one with God and the Mysteries so Made
[14:15] Alive to us that I mean the Revelation
[14:18] that it takes preeminence over anything
[14:21] in our lives right to bring us so close
[14:23] to God that one day that he'll speak
[14:26] through us and the dead in Christ rise
[14:28] first and come to us do you believe
[14:31] this I'm saying do you really believe
[14:34] this or are you believing unto
[14:36] it that's now you got to decide that
[14:39] right you got you you got to just like
[14:41] brother Bob was speaking what a message
[14:43] brother what a message for me that that
[14:46] I I enjoyed it say well it's simple it
[14:49] wasn't simple to me right because to
[14:51] hear the voice of God you got to hear
[14:53] him through the word I've been listen
[14:55] you can tell people about God's been
[14:57] speaking to me I mean I all night I was
[15:01] up all night night before last I'm
[15:02] speaking to God God speaking back you
[15:05] believe that amen no you don't have to
[15:08] but see that you know how you'll get to
[15:10] where you can believe that God doing the
[15:13] same thing to you right and if he does
[15:15] it to one he'll do it to the others
[15:17] that's why when somebody comes here with
[15:19] a testimony you ought to listen to it
[15:22] and don't just hear and clap your hands
[15:24] and praise God and walk out and forget
[15:26] it cuz God does something he something
[15:29] to put it up before the people that the
[15:32] people can see it and draw from
[15:35] it I got to go
[15:38] on let me continue here for if the
[15:43] trumpet give an uncertain sound so if
[15:44] the preacher we've heard a lot of
[15:47] preachers in our lifetime most of us
[15:50] here and and when something don't sound
[15:53] right it'll go bone yeah see so there
[15:58] was there an uncertain sound there there
[16:00] was a gospel trumpet you know that he
[16:02] said a trumpet would
[16:04] sound a seal would
[16:08] open a mystery would come forth there'd
[16:11] be one to pick it up and preach it y
[16:15] there would be a group of people that
[16:16] would receive it and be sealed away and
[16:19] it would be a group of people that said
[16:21] they did too yeah right and they were
[16:23] sealed away in another
[16:27] place
[16:29] so likewise except you hutter by the
[16:32] tongues words easy to be understood
[16:35] right now the preacher could get right
[16:38] here and uh brother Dale said something
[16:40] the last two or three times he's he's
[16:42] preaching on the Old Testament saints
[16:44] that I got a lot of notes here I'm gonna
[16:45] get on to get on if God give me Grace
[16:48] but he said something and I wonder if he
[16:50] caught
[16:51] it he said whatever they done whatever
[16:55] they done he said they achieved D what
[16:59] God called him
[17:00] to now what was that achieving why did
[17:03] they achieve it you have got to achieve
[17:07] what God called you for and put your
[17:09] name on the Lamb's Book of Life before
[17:11] the foundation of the world Brother
[17:13] Richard you've got to find that you are
[17:15] God's elected that's right exactly and
[17:18] you find it out because God is on the
[17:19] throne of your heart called for
[17:22] knowledge then he will show you right in
[17:24] that vessel where you live right where
[17:26] you stay he will begin to talk to you
[17:29] and take you back into the back part of
[17:31] his mind back before the beginning and
[17:33] said he said in adoption series that God
[17:36] put your name on his lamb book of life
[17:38] before the foundation world because he
[17:40] knew the deceitfulness of Satan and what
[17:43] he was going to do when you got here so
[17:45] he had you there and when you come in
[17:47] contact with that you going to know you
[17:49] ain't going to
[17:50] die amen and it it's going to take
[17:53] desperation he said we I don't see a lot
[17:56] of it myself you know and I'm not near
[17:58] desperate enough but he said be
[18:00] desperate to perish right okay so you
[18:04] got to have a Ministry and we got
[18:08] one and I'm not saying I'm not going to
[18:10] say anything contrary I'm just going to
[18:14] let br br speak for himself right so if
[18:17] we believe the prophet and everything
[18:20] the prophet preached we'll see
[18:23] tonight we'll see if you believe
[18:27] him I mean that that's Ser that's that's
[18:29] a hard statement but it's I've got some
[18:32] things right here that's part of the
[18:35] mystery if we don't see the first
[18:37] resurrection how are we going to see the
[18:39] second Resurrection which is
[18:44] us I ain't got to that
[18:47] yet there are there are the 10th verse
[18:51] of the first chapter 14 uh 8- 11 there
[18:55] are there are may be so many kinds of
[18:58] voices is in the world none of them is
[19:01] without signification I if I say a word
[19:04] right therefore if I know not the
[19:07] meaning of the voice I don't know what
[19:09] the preacher is saying I won't get
[19:12] desperate enough before God and ask God
[19:16] to explain that to me Lord right I want
[19:19] to run I want to do a confessional I
[19:21] want to do like the Roman Catholic
[19:23] Church does and go into a booth with
[19:25] somebody and have them tell me what I
[19:26] want to hear yeah
[19:29] yep that ain't it I shall be unto him
[19:33] that speaketh a barbarian in other words
[19:35] I'll have a revelation you want or
[19:36] you'll have a revelation I want right
[19:39] and he that speaketh shall be a
[19:41] barbarian to me right amen now this is

[23:13] them that was to come on a end time
[23:16] people that sitting here right I hope
[23:19] everybody that's right that we're to
[23:21] that we're to do Malachi 4 he preached
[23:24] in in uh uh 62 he said word p
[23:28] has struck the world but as of yet
[23:31] Malachi 4 ain't been fulfilled and it
[23:33] took the one year later the Thunders
[23:36] open and even there when it open that
[23:39] that was the son of man Ministry that me
[23:41] and you have that takes us to the change
[23:43] of the body and and that's the
[23:46] Fulfillment of Malachi 4 right that's
[23:48] the completeness of Malachi 4 do you see
[23:52] in
[23:53] yourself and this is part of my Ministry
[23:55] I look to you I said do you see it right
[23:58] I have a lot of people get mad I've had
[24:00] people walk off and never come back
[24:02] because I do that I can't help it the
[24:04] way I am you know but
[24:07] um vindicate Malachi 4 that means you
[24:10] got to vindicate Luke 17:30 right son of
[24:14] man Ministry exactly seven Thunders you
[24:17] got to vindicate it with your life amen
[24:20] your very life he got to show
[24:25] God Malachi 4 is a full work word and
[24:28] also constitutes and brings into play
[24:31] the church age book in 336 his these
[24:34] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[24:37] literally turns you back to the faith of
[24:38] the Father the same Ministry that John
[24:41] 14:12 he said the things that I do shall
[24:44] you do also there is people that this is
[24:47] happening to
[24:49] right already brother brother
[24:53] Marken brother said if somebody comes to
[24:56] the pull pit and pray for for and don't
[24:58] receive their healing it ought throw the
[25:00] whole church into desperation exactly do
[25:03] we see that or do we walk out and and uh
[25:06] we might say well praise help them Lord
[25:09] but do is there
[25:11] desperation I don't mean just in their
[25:14] physical body it could be in their
[25:18] mind I don't know how I'm doing all this
[25:21] but I don't mean I got to get off of
[25:23] this vindicate Luke
[25:25] 17:30 vindicate Hebrews 138 right
[25:29] exactly take 138 let me I I want to say
[25:32] this with Abraham and Sarah back in the
[25:36] 17th chapter 18th chapter of the Book of
[25:41] Genesis now why did Abraham fall down in
[25:46] life why did Sarah
[25:49] doubt how can this be how can this be
[25:52] why H what made them do that what made
[25:55] Abram give his wife away and Savor went
[25:59] with it because he said to what made
[26:02] that what made him come back is Abraham
[26:05] with a change body and do the same thing
[26:08] right right you got to watch your types
[26:12] now right I'll tell you what the truth
[26:14] was I'll tell you exactly what it was
[26:16] they did not have the baptism of the
[26:18] Holy Ghost Inside their soul if they had
[26:21] the Holy Ghost Inside their soul Abraham
[26:23] would have never gave his wife away and
[26:25] Sarah would have never went there right
[26:27] exactly amen exactly right am right
[26:30] never neither would would David have
[26:34] took bash Sheba and prator and sent her
[26:36] husband to be killed if he' had the Holy
[26:39] Ghost Inside his soul so we have the
[26:42] Holy Ghost he said with John the Baptist
[26:45] he said now there ain't never been one
[26:48] born of man greater than John but the
[26:51] least in the kingdom is greater than
[26:53] John then you don't have to do these
[26:54] things he died on the cross in flesh
[26:58] that you don't have to do it in the
[26:59] flesh
[27:00] right we are so concerned we think good
[27:03] works is going to do it good good works
[27:05] ain't going to get you one thing right
[27:08] right it ain't going to get you one
[27:09] thing right that's right and it it's
[27:11] good to do good
[27:13] works now we we we got
[27:17] a St John

[27:24] Revelation the 10th chapter of the
[27:25] opening of Seven Seals and the MS of God
[27:29] even to the serpent seed I remember when
[27:32] brother Dale preached on the serpent
[27:33] seed on first seal and brought that out
[27:36] perfectly it ain't went nowhere right he
[27:40] still around in the air am if if
[27:43] somebody wanted that would say we sing
[27:45] that song when he passes by well just
[27:48] reach up and get it right you can do it
[27:53] we I I look for The Impossible that's
[27:55] right amen I believe God can do anything
[27:58] just like he said right there when he
[28:00] said in in uh when Sarah did what she
[28:03] did how can this be I don't know about
[28:06] you but I took my life my life God took
[28:09] me and on that scripture where he said
[28:12] is anything too hard for the Lord I put
[28:14] myself right there Hebrews 138 he has
[28:18] never been too hard for him he wasn't
[28:20] too hard for him then and he and he knew
[28:22] a people was going to be here at the end
[28:24] time with the most deceiving the most
[28:27] evil thing has ever be and we was going
[28:29] to need to see that right there and hold
[28:31] to that right there and it followed me
[28:33] all the way to this this
[28:38] moment God help us all we can't do this
[28:43] brother said ain't it ain't me doing it
[28:45] it's him doing it in me we can't attain
[28:48] to to this right here but God can attain
[28:51] for us amen amen listen if he gave me a
[28:55] promise when he gave me that Revelation
[28:57] oh on Genesis
[29:00] 184 when he when I seen that right there
[29:02] he said is anything too hard for the
[29:04] Lord I seen Hebrews 13 raiseed up in me
[29:08] and I believe that God can do
[29:11] anything all I got to do is just yield
[29:13] to God and soak that word up and get
[29:16] closer I tell people all the time you
[29:18] ain't got no choice you better get
[29:19] closer to God right you better lay these
[29:22] things down cast down imagination all
[29:24] these things better go they better go
[29:26] you want to go in the rapt that's
[29:28] right you want to go in a Rapture don't
[29:31] get tied up with the world that's Satan
[29:33] that's Satan doing that he's trying to
[29:35] wrap you up in some little wave of his
[29:38] and hold you there right and the only
[29:41] way to break out is by hearing the
[29:43] correct word of God and obeying it and
[29:46] God will come to it right amen

[30:19] share it with you he said if you get in
[30:22] the same predicament or or or that with
[30:25] God or whatever it is he'll do the same
[30:28] for
[30:32] you have you really have you really

[31:23] which in his times Jesus he shall show
[31:27] who is the blessed and only potent at
[31:29] the King of Kings and the Lord of lords
[31:32] and the next verse now the next verse I
[31:34] won I want you to read this right here
[31:36] because this is as far as a lot of
[31:37] people goes yes now I want before I read

[31:43] perfect
[31:44] man here's somebody that had received
[31:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we said we

[38:01] communion he told them he he says I
[38:04] won't drink of the fruit of the vine
[38:07] until I drink it a new with you in my
[38:09] father's
[38:10] Kingdom and that means that Rapture
[38:13] marriage supper in a glorified body and
[38:15] that's why he couldn't go into the
[38:17] presence see he listen it's going to
[38:20] take that glorified
[38:22] body Spirit come back to the soul the
[38:25] theophany and come and pick up his spot
[38:27] in a glorified state to bring us into
[38:29] his presence right Glory that's correct

[38:53] yours listen if if uh well I'm going I
[38:58] want you to understand this right

[39:11] sir where we would be right and let me
[39:14] tell you let me let me make another
[39:15] little gesture if you don't mind the

[42:22] introduction revelation of Jesus Christ
[42:25] Church age book chapter one introduction
[42:28] I read this last time now I ask you to
[42:30] take this and bring it inside of you it
[42:33] it is so hard to preach to somebody that
[42:36] knows they know thinks they know
[42:38] everything you don't know everything cuz
[42:41] he doesn't said it's a supernal element
[42:42] not made known to you don't put no
[42:45] period behind and and think about what
[42:47] you know cuz you going to get yourself
[42:49] in trouble with God look at you zarra oh
[42:52] a Godly Man had Godly Parents he was the
[42:55] next thing to in wisdom to Solomon yeah
[43:00] pleased
[43:01] God I mean everything he done he got
[43:04] lifted up in his heart he knowed
[43:07] something he was going to go over and do
[43:09] the priest's job and they told him the
[43:12] PRI the ones that was anointed for that
[43:14] told him no don't come here you are a
[43:15] king stay in your position right he was
[43:18] going to do it anyway brother said he
[43:21] thought he could just do anything he
[43:22] want to go God loved him so
[43:24] much and he died in a leper house the
[43:27] time the moment that he stepped inside
[43:28] that Temple he was strugg with the last
[43:31] stages of Le I didn't say he was lost he
[43:33] wasn't
[43:34] lost but he paid the price and we can go
[43:36] through the Bible go through the look at
[43:38] the look at D the uh first king First
[43:42] Kings 13 the man of God we preach on
[43:44] many times with the word of God doing
[43:46] the works of God and did the works of
[43:48] God God said don't you go back like you
[43:50] come if anybody tries to stop you and
[43:52] talk with you try to talk you out of
[43:54] what you doing or or don't you drink
[43:56] don't do and the old Prophet come said
[43:58] Angel told him me and the Bible said he
[44:00] lied to him right see if God talked to
[44:02] him the first time he could talk to him
[44:04] the second time says now I change my
[44:06] mind like he did with uh uh U Hezekiah
[44:11] right no if God spoke to you and told
[44:14] you to do something you better know the
[44:16] voice right I don't think he going to
[44:19] send nobody else on something like that
[44:22] right well men these glasses get
[44:25] separated a lot of times
[44:27] through this volume we concern itself
[44:29] with various major doctrines now
[44:32] remember in 336 he said is these
[44:35] divinely reveal mrst truths of his
[44:38] coming and remember he said the bride
[44:41] was part of the mystery and must be
[44:43] revealed right that's right the same
[44:46] life the same word the same actions the
[44:51] same everything is what we're to be
[44:54] right to call forth the Dead amen do
[44:57] this this volume we concern said with
[44:59] various major doctr such as the godhead
[45:03] what a baptism you can take water
[45:05] baptism and go to head with it
[45:07] right can you right or or or or is it
[45:12] now listen you you're very fortunate
[45:15] that you got a Sunday school teacher
[45:16] like you got I think
[45:19] personally but but see you know that you
[45:22] can do all that and not even be a
[45:24] Christian right so it keeps him
[45:28] humble it keeps it keeps him laying
[45:31] before God to not to make a mistake
[45:34] that's right not to get exalted or
[45:36] lifted up of what I know what I've did
[45:39] what I do it's me me me no it ain't if
[45:43] you know anything is called God has
[45:45] moved in your life and did it it's him
[45:48] working and living through you that's
[45:49] right what a baptism found in Revelation
[45:52] chap 1 through three it's main thing and
[45:55] God Brother D has preached on this oh
[45:59] Lord I remember when we had it all over
[46:00] the walls
[46:02] yeah so I remember these things and and
[46:06] and remember don't get away from what I
[46:08] said to First what Brother D said he
[46:12] said talk about the Old Testament Saints
[46:14] whatever God ordained them to be he said
[46:17] they achieved that and they and they and
[46:20] we going to talk in just a minute if I
[46:21] can get to it and we going to talk over
[46:23] the rewards of of what they achieved we
[46:26] going to stop it just they can achieve
[46:28] or they're going to achieve he didn't
[46:30] either I'm
[46:31] just the main theme is setting forth of
[46:35] a detailed study of the seven Church
[46:37] ages now I'll say again can you take

[50:55] I'm I'm I'm figing get in
[50:58] gear first burst of a Roman Candle the
[51:00] church Ages come forth with a mighty
[51:02] initial illumination without which there
[51:05] could be no further light right but once
[51:08] the brance of the seven Church ages is
[51:10] given by divine revelation now

[51:51] right if I get run off and I told I

[52:24] jewel
[52:25] that's see did I yeah that's her but
[52:28] once the brance of the seven Church ages
[52:31] is given by divine revelation light upon
[52:34] light followers until the whole of the
[52:37] Revelation opens wide before our
[52:39] wondering eyes we edified and purified
[52:43] by his Spirit are made ready for his
[52:45] glorious appearing even our Lord and
[52:47] savior the one true God Jesus Christen I
[52:50] mean there it is exactly right
[52:54] okay

[53:05] to Brother Joseph I want to uh bring 10
[53:09] up I'm I just I've got these in uh thing
[53:13] but I've had to shuffle them around
[53:14] because the way I want to bring them and
[53:16] uh this is on the
[53:18] Rapture and I and I'm I'm talking about
[53:21] now I want you to what brother Dale has
[53:24] preached a couple of messes on and uh
[53:27] and I I just want to I know this ain't
[53:30] going to sound right I want to go deeper
[53:32] cuz he's got so much that he's got to
[53:35] carry and it it just and he's got
[53:38] there's
[53:39] Ministries that I got in trouble one
[53:42] time here years and years ago with God I
[53:45] said Lord this is when I was first
[53:47] hadn't been here long and I was
[53:49] preaching here and I said Lord maybe
[53:51] maybe now this ain't going to it
[53:52] probably won't sound right but I said
[53:54] Lord Maybe at least I can help brother
[53:56] Dale oh yeah you know and you know what
[53:59] boy when I went home I got a whooping
[54:02] God says he don't need your
[54:06] help he got me I'm I'm telling you but
[54:10] now it it was something about my
[54:12] attitude maybe I mean I don't know what
[54:14] it was but I tell you what I got a joke
[54:15] to and I said Lord just let me do what
[54:18] you want me to do let me let me just let
[54:21] me do what you want me to do I can say I
[54:23] can say a lot of things I've had people
[54:25] in this church say awful things to me
[54:28] right here right here in this church and
[54:30] all I do is love them amen I've always
[54:32] loved them when they were saying it to
[54:34] me that I loved them but if they ain't
[54:36] got them things out the way I mean if
[54:37] I've got if I've done something I need
[54:40] God you bring it to my attention and
[54:42] I'll get it
[54:43] straight God if it takes the hide off me
[54:46] I'll get it straight but there I'm
[54:48] telling you there's been people that
[54:49] said a lot of bad things to me sometimes
[54:52] when I was in the pull
[54:54] pit
[54:55] and I don't hold nothing against nobody
[54:57] but I do see them and I if I got time
[55:00] I'll tell you a
[55:03] vision it was it was as clear as I'm
[55:06] looking at Brother Sam now it might have
[55:07] been a dream but it was as clear but I
[55:11] mean if I do I I'll I'll I'll tell
[55:14] you this is a dangerous thing Church
[55:18] exactly true it's going to take a
[55:21] complete Revelation that's right the all
[55:24] the Mysteries made to you we don't need
[55:26] to take the Mysteries and and just just
[55:30] deal them out like a dick of cards we
[55:32] don't do that we need to lay before God
[55:34] and let God give us an answer right
[55:37] ain't nobody can do that they can talk
[55:39] to you until they turn perable in the
[55:41] face and if you don't get a revelation
[55:43] of it right you ain't going to see it
[55:46] exactly right so so that's ain't a thing
[55:48] in thew but Satan dealing with you a Son
[55:52] of God and trying to get you you
[55:56] thinking about and going to this one and
[55:57] going to that one and what don't do that
[56:01] go to God Amen okay this is in there
[56:04] this I want to read this now to start if
[56:05] God give me uh Grace here I want you to
[56:09] listen
[56:10] closely now in the Rapture message he
[56:13] said I'm I'm going to read it I'm going
[56:15] just say this he said there's three
[56:17] raptures in the Old Testament right and
[56:19] three raptures ending you exactly now we
[56:23] know that Jesus when he resurrected see
[56:25] he here come Mary Mary Magdalene he said
[56:28] touch me not I haven't yet ascended to
[56:31] my father a sin dead a sin dead to my
[56:34] father and to my God and your God right
[56:37] but when he ascended made the transition
[56:39] he come back say h me
[56:41] sure see but they had the promise this
[56:45] is the only thing I can see this right
[56:46] here they had the promise here here he
[56:49] hadn't come back he was still he he
[56:52] wasn't in the form that he' come in at
[56:54] pentec because which was the son of God
[56:57] but but they could see him they could
[56:59] handle him but once he made his
[57:02] Rapture and come down in in in the form
[57:05] of the Holy Spirit and fill them like I
[57:08] was talking about in Acts two there and
[57:10] filled them with his mortality there
[57:12] with his and his light and started and
[57:15] and start them on their journey and and
[57:19] we are are so fortunate that here we are
[57:21] at the last moments of time and we pick
[57:23] up the message from
[57:26] Pentecost I mean Calvary and we see that
[57:29] Calvary finished it
[57:31] all sir
[57:33] exactly God I wish I had more time but I
[57:36] just ain't now if you want to read in
[57:38] Matthew 18:16 it said there is three
[57:40] that bear record see God had Prophet oh
[57:44] Lord thank you Lord if people gets up
[57:48] there and they preach a whole message
[57:49] that we believe the message we believe
[57:52] the message we believe the message and
[57:54] don't tell you what to message is
[57:57] EXA I I I mean if if I'm obas y'all can
[58:00] tell me and it's good because I want him
[58:03] to believe message but that's like God
[58:05] calling a man to the ministry if he
[58:07] calls a brother to the ministry he gives
[58:09] him a message and it's an end time
[58:12] message right that's right we're waiting
[58:17] on the revelation of the Rapture so what
[58:20] message you re he give us brother B
[58:22] yeah of course we got to come back if
[58:25] there anybody that's that's left out and
[58:28] ain't come to the statute of the perfect
[58:29] man yet the faith of the Father which is
[58:31] a revelation of almighty God but he said
[58:34] there are the Christ the son of the
[58:35] Living God but he didn't say he didn't
[58:38] answer his question who the man say I
[58:40] the son of man him right I tell you it's
[58:43] hard to keep just jumping out there and
[58:45] staying right there
[58:47] but God promis me he he would help me
[58:50] now if you want to read Matthew 18:6
[58:52] there three that be record in in 1 John
[58:55] 5:7 so forth there is always a witness
[58:58] is that right right it's a ver
[59:00] verification something that's right
[59:02] three Witnesses bear in the mouth of two
[59:04] or three Witnesses let that word be
[59:05] established now now notice we've had
[59:09] three Witnesses three is a witness now
[59:11] we have already had three raptures in
[59:14] the Old Testament right exactly now now
[59:17] listen to this because it's something in
[59:19] here and I may have to get on over in
[59:22] here to get to to more what I'm talking
[59:24] about did you know that as a witness do
[59:28] you know that then if you know that by
[59:30] Revelation then you're a witness of it
[59:32] and part of it the substance is in you
[59:35] revealing it to you you're a part of
[59:38] that as a witness now watch Enoch Enoch
[59:42] was one in the Old Testament now Elijah
[59:45] was the other one see he in Jesus was
[59:49] the other one right Old Testament now
[59:52] now listen to me now people thinks that
[59:54] what Jesus was he he it was Enoch uh
[59:58] Elijah and Jesus but he was a he was he
[1:00:01] was the first one the what he said he's
[1:00:05] a keystone between the old and the new
[1:00:08] and he finished he was finishing up when
[1:00:10] he said it's finished that was finished
[1:00:12] all he had to do is go get them right
[1:00:14] all he had to do is go get them right
[1:00:17] okay and and this has got something it
[1:00:18] it types and it brings a perfect type
[1:00:21] see when they write they put in here the
[1:00:23] type in anti-type they put a anti why
[1:00:26] they do
[1:00:27] that that's opposite that's right a a n
[1:00:31] t that's it I
[1:00:34] mean no Revelation right
[1:00:39] am now notice we've had three Witnesses
[1:00:41] I seen them already three raps in the
[1:00:44] Old Testament now let me get Jesus with
[1:00:46] the other one Jesus being the Keystone
[1:00:49] and he be record he was a keystone
[1:00:52] between the Old and New Testament cuz he
[1:00:54] had to first die and then Rapture he
[1:00:57] died come to life and walked around here
[1:00:59] with us oh God something good coming and
[1:01:02] then was raptured up because he was a
[1:01:05] keystone remember he ascended up and
[1:01:07] made the transition but it wasn't a
[1:01:09] Rapture right right Rapture when the 500
[1:01:12] stood out there and watched him go
[1:01:15] up and he was a keystone that died the
[1:01:17] two together after his resurrection and
[1:01:20] Rapture look after he did that and
[1:01:23] proved that the old test
[1:01:25] there we all know Enoch was translated
[1:01:27] we know Elijah was taken out by our
[1:01:29] world wind that right and a chariot of
[1:01:31] fire and Jesus died buried Rose and
[1:01:34] lived here on Earth and then was
[1:01:35] raptured up the Keystone there's a three
[1:01:37] to be record of that now now there had
[1:01:41] been one raptured already passed
[1:01:45] right where's that what what is that now
[1:01:50] I want you to think what he said now
[1:01:53] listen there was Enoch
[1:01:56] Elijah Lord Jesus Christ and he says
[1:01:59] that this is a r this is this is the
[1:02:01] Lord rap He said but there's already
[1:02:03] been one of the New Testament right
[1:02:06] there not
[1:02:10] Jesus he raptured I got something for
[1:02:14] you
[1:02:14] here we all know Enoch was translated
[1:02:18] now there had been one Rapture already
[1:02:20] you know that and he goes to Matthew
[1:02:22] 27th chapter I'm I'm going just I I
[1:02:25] won't go no further than that right
[1:02:26] there on that one he goes to 27th
[1:02:28] chapter where many of the saints that
[1:02:30] slept in the ground their bodies come
[1:02:32] forth from the grave and come come forth
[1:02:34] and went into the city showing
[1:02:36] themselves all right this is uh page
[1:02:39] nine Brother Joseph now I'm I'm I I I
[1:02:42] chose that to say that to show you in
[1:02:45] the Rapture message read the whole
[1:02:47] message amen the whole message is a
[1:02:50] Rapture
[1:02:53] message you want want to know about the
[1:02:54] Rapture read he said in books and tapes
[1:02:57] Liv Rapture in faith cuz where you think
[1:03:00] the ministry is getting it right I just
[1:03:02] pulling it out of the
[1:03:04] sky is is God going to Rapture us and we
[1:03:07] going to be just walking go come like a
[1:03:08] thief in the night and we going to be
[1:03:10] walking along he snatch us up no it
[1:03:12] ain't going to be that way we going to
[1:03:14] come to a position right and God's going
[1:03:16] to ra go when I was talk about while ago
[1:03:19] he when he gave you the baptism of the
[1:03:21] Holy Ghost he took his whole armor is
[1:03:24] wrapped up in that new birth and he
[1:03:27] begins to spread it out and he and he
[1:03:29] spread it out and he's wrapping it
[1:03:31] tighter and buckling it tighter and
[1:03:33] taking he's he's taking the corruption
[1:03:35] out and putting Revelation in and and
[1:03:38] and taking uh Immortal Life out of you
[1:03:41] and putting mortality in you right
[1:03:44] getting you ready for the Rapture right
[1:03:47] can you believe it amen amen you can't
[1:03:50] do it he said you can't do it you can't
[1:03:53] attain to it but Jesus Christ is more
[1:03:56] than able GL we we have something that
[1:04:00] Sarah and Abraham didn't have they were
[1:04:02] the type right we are the antitype right
[1:04:06] we are the fullness of the type we have
[1:04:08] the entire Revelation from Calvary and
[1:04:11] not only that but we go back to where
[1:04:13] Paul got his 14 books from amen where
[1:04:16] Moses got his five books from we go back
[1:04:19] before the beginning and see where he
[1:04:21] put our name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:04:24] for the foundation of the world because
[1:04:26] he knew you and he didn't make you do
[1:04:28] anything every choice you ever made you
[1:04:30] made it for yourself and he seen that
[1:04:33] and he elected you right there and put
[1:04:37] your name on the land book of life
[1:04:38] because he know the deceitfulness of
[1:04:40] Satan what he was going to do down here
[1:04:43] in these last bones of time give me that
[1:04:46] Revelation uh Genesis
[1:04:48] 1814
[1:04:51] yeah why why did he say what listen
[1:04:54] listen why did the Bible
[1:04:56] say we know all that he gave his wife
[1:04:58] away we know all these things but why
[1:05:01] did he say blessed a man that God do
[1:05:03] impute
[1:05:04] sin because he knew they didn't have the
[1:05:08] Holy Spirit in their soul they knew that
[1:05:11] that that that he there was a process
[1:05:13] had to come through he had why did he
[1:05:15] let sah put it the same put in our heart
[1:05:19] to go to to to get Hagar and send him
[1:05:22] into right Abraham
[1:05:25] What If Abraham had had the Holy Ghost

[1:05:32] man if Sarah had had the holy ghost in
[1:05:35] her soul she' have never sent hagard in
[1:05:37] there but God had to let it by his
[1:05:39] permissive will had to let all these
[1:05:41] things happen to get everything set up

[1:14:25] amen that's right okay here we go uh
[1:14:29] this is on course 65 1204 170 130 ever
[1:14:33] what that means what in the Old
[1:14:35] Testament them Old Testament Saints
[1:14:36] there when this Rapture first taken
[1:14:39] place listen slow down if your guys are
[1:14:42] getting your eyes
[1:14:43] getting sleepy open them up
[1:14:47] yeah now the Old Testament says now when
[1:14:50] this Rapture first taken place notice
[1:14:52] verse 50 his loud voice awaken the Old
[1:14:55] Testament Saints exactly like the loud
[1:14:58] voice awaken Jesus or awaken Lazarus
[1:15:01] now the Lord himself shall descend with
[1:15:05] a shout right and he woke us up gospel
[1:15:08] shout I'm going I'm going to try to just
[1:15:12] read see the loud voice awaken and the
[1:15:15] second is fulfilled in 1 Thessalonians
[1:15:18] 4th chapter let's just take a read we
[1:15:20] just read it a few minutes ago see I
[1:15:22] would not have you ignorant brother
[1:15:23] concerning those that sleep that you s
[1:15:25] not that I that I that's 1 Thessalonians
[1:15:29] 4:128 that that will be the second
[1:15:32] Rapture yeah now one's done happen I
[1:15:36] ain't told you that one yet but I'm
[1:15:37] coming to it I ain't talk about the Lord
[1:15:39] Jesus Christ we know he raptured right
[1:15:42] the second Rapture will be a catching
[1:15:44] away of the Bride sure first
[1:15:46] Thessalonians the Old Testament Saints
[1:15:49] has gone into his presence now there was
[1:15:52] only one more way they could go into his
[1:15:54] presence because brother Brandon could
[1:15:56] not go into the almighty God the Lord
[1:15:59] Jesus Christ's presence because he was
[1:16:00] still in his theophany and the scri he
[1:16:02] would have broke the scriptures
[1:16:04] scripture said I won't eat I won't eat
[1:16:07] of or drink of the fruit of the vine and
[1:16:09] that was them sitting there I won't I
[1:16:11] won't do this until I do it with in my
[1:16:14] father's Kingdom and so he had to come
[1:16:18] he he he'll have to come by us reaching
[1:16:21] the place and God speaking the Rapture
[1:16:23] into existence and and and when he comes
[1:16:26] down here and takes up that glorified
[1:16:28] body he can go into the presence of God
[1:16:31] then and not till
[1:16:34] then see we are these bodies are still a
[1:16:37] prisoner of what Adam and Eve done right
[1:16:40] but what I've been talking about by the
[1:16:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost he's bringing
[1:16:44] in in sub submission and eradicating
[1:16:48] what she caused and somebody's coming
[1:16:51] back to the position because God himself
[1:16:55] promised
[1:16:57] it he said he could reveal how many
[1:16:59] times well I think this is what we need
[1:17:01] to hear no we need to search God and
[1:17:04] find out what God wants us to say up in
[1:17:07] this P
[1:17:08] pit i i f this I I didn't I wasn't going
[1:17:12] to do it but God God come to me and and
[1:17:15] here he was with
[1:17:18] Isel and he brought it to me he brought
[1:17:20] this to me he said watch
[1:17:24] what of the
[1:17:25] night he said if you don't tell them
[1:17:29] their blood's going to be on you but if
[1:17:31] you do tell them and they turn it down
[1:17:35] the blood's on them now that's for each
[1:17:38] one of you I'm not tell about own you
[1:17:40] and yet it is but see the holy spirit in
[1:17:43] you makes you a Watchman do you watch
[1:17:45] for your
[1:17:47] wife a wife do you watch for your
[1:17:49] husband are you out somewhere and
[1:17:51] somebody say something the Watchman
[1:17:53] comes forth which is the Holy Ghost and
[1:17:55] tell somebody why you got long hair why

[1:18:00] you're serving the god the way you are
[1:18:02] Watchman what of the night if you don't
[1:18:04] tell them pray pray right to God what
[1:18:09] would you have me say when you get up in

[1:18:19] brother Brown say that's oh Lord God oh
[1:18:23] my where does that put me I'm sorry I I
[1:18:26] got to the loud voice awaken is
[1:18:28] fulfilled in first Thessalonians the Old
[1:18:30] Testament Saints has gone into his
[1:18:32] presence Paradise done
[1:18:34] away and the Old Testament Saints
[1:18:36] ascended up at his loud voice when he
[1:18:39] screamed and give up the ghost because
[1:18:41] why the sacrifice their propitiation of
[1:18:43] their sins that they had waited on
[1:18:46] believing that perfect lamb was coming
[1:18:47] that offered the sacrifice of the lamb
[1:18:50] and when he died and yielded up the
[1:18:51] ghost he scream with a loud voice voice
[1:18:53] and the Old Testament Saints awoke once
[1:18:56] to shout and the voice over here the
[1:18:58] same thing the voice Bob the voice the
[1:19:01] voice that God had you to speak of it
[1:19:03] ain't just his natural voice though it
[1:19:05] was a voice of God but see you went
[1:19:08] deeper and you was talking about God
[1:19:11] speaking through you taking your vessel
[1:19:14] and living a life speaking through you
[1:19:16] right the same thing at his coming see
[1:19:20] yielded up The Ghost and when he did the
[1:19:22] sacrifice was perfect now listen and
[1:19:25] Paradise emptied out why because what
[1:19:27] you done watch and the Old Testament
[1:19:30] Saints came to the Earth again walked
[1:19:32] around on Earth and entered in with him
[1:19:34] at his
[1:19:35] Rapture David said over there lift up
[1:19:38] your evation Gates and be lifted up he
[1:19:40] led captivity captive and give gifts
[1:19:43] unto men now what does he mean by that
[1:19:46] he loose them from that prison that
[1:19:49] their bodies was in cuz they come up in
[1:19:52] in from the graves in their bodies so
[1:19:55] say the
[1:19:57] scriptures we going to argue with
[1:19:59] scripture I ain't I'm going to just say
[1:20:02] what what the Bible says what brother
[1:20:04] Brown said and we all learn we all have
[1:20:08] to stand
[1:20:10] correction especially
[1:20:14] me and remember this here and the Old
[1:20:16] Testament Saints has gone into his
[1:20:18] presence now that's got a real
[1:20:20] significance here believe in the perfect
[1:20:22] lamb was coming the old T he says and
[1:20:25] Par and when he did the sacrifice was
[1:20:28] perfect Paradise emptied out and the Old
[1:20:30] Testament Saints came to the Earth again
[1:20:31] and walked around at his Rapture okay
[1:20:33] the Lord Of Glory Mighty and host Mighty
[1:20:36] host and here they come in marching
[1:20:39] Jesus led captivity captive he he loosed
[1:20:42] their captivity and captivated them with
[1:20:46] himself if it Ain you somebody got
[1:20:48] another explanation of
[1:20:51] that I that's all all I can see and here
[1:20:54] he come with the Old Testament Saints
[1:20:56] and went into the new gates up there and
[1:20:59] said lift up ye Everlasting Gates and be
[1:21:01] ye lifted up and let the king of glory
[1:21:03] come in the voice coming from the inside
[1:21:05] say who is a king of glory the lord
[1:21:07] Mighty in battle the gates flew open and
[1:21:09] Jesus the Conqueror LED captive them
[1:21:13] that had believed on him and the word
[1:21:15] had come to them there the Old Testament
[1:21:17] Saints laying in their waiting he led
[1:21:19] captivity captive ascended on high took
[1:21:22] the old Testament Saints and went in
[1:21:24] there's a Rapture already
[1:21:26] passed first Rapture of the New
[1:21:32] Testament meditate on
[1:21:34] it CU we're tied
[1:21:37] together until like Brother D say he
[1:21:40] says they without us can't be made
[1:21:42] perfect so we we have to obtain this
[1:21:45] place to get to get to to the Rapture to
[1:21:50] come to bring it all but see they not
[1:21:53] made perfect until this I mean totally
[1:21:55] perfect now and and no neither nobody
[1:21:58] else until this thing is over because
[1:22:00] they still two witnesses has got to be
[1:22:02] raptured right and then and there's
[1:22:05] white thrown judgment the foolish virgin
[1:22:07] is going to be given eternal life and
[1:22:09] then we'll go to the well the
[1:22:10] millennium's over then we'll go to the
[1:22:12] new city and everybody's going to be in
[1:22:15] their positions perfect right there
[1:22:19] that's what we that's what we've done
[1:22:21] brother that's what we're do we they

[1:23:29] shed blood of the lamb but there was an
[1:23:31] elected group right now brother Brown I

[1:23:38] Believers unbelievers always would be
[1:23:40] that ought to make us desperate right
[1:23:41] there right that ought to make us
[1:23:44] desperate and that elected group as soon

[1:23:49] in it with sincerity now I'm coming to
[1:23:51] the word over overcome now hold that
[1:23:54] these that had really overcome sincerely

[1:23:59] this is talking about them but I'm
[1:24:00] talking about me and you right sincerely
[1:24:03] he's going to take sincerely desperation
[1:24:06] to bring us into this position that they
[1:24:08] was in for their group sincerely making
[1:24:11] the same offering that the rest of them
[1:24:13] made but in sincerity overcome the
[1:24:15] things of the world when the
[1:24:17] propitiation correctly was made for them
[1:24:19] they were in Paradise until that PL

[1:24:25] made they had overcome and was resting
[1:24:26] sleeping many B slept in the dust he
[1:24:29] slept now how can I overcome now if we
[1:24:32] had time we could go back and see Daniel
[1:24:35] when Daniel that that elected one that
[1:24:37] had overcome close up the book Daniel
[1:24:40] for you shall rest in thy lot now what
[1:24:42] does that lot mean yeah but when the
[1:24:45] prince shall come which shall stand for
[1:24:47] the people Thou shalt stand in that lot

[1:40:13] to the souls that are in prison taking
[1:40:15] the keys of death head away from devil
[1:40:16] now listen every the end of every man
[1:40:19] it's always been this way it's end of a
[1:40:21] Ministry you're preaching until the
[1:40:22] totally lost he said he said in his word
[1:40:25] he said in in quotes I my mind's on this
[1:40:28] right here now he said in the last days
[1:40:30] God would witht take his Spirit from the
[1:40:32] earth now we know he said he ain't going
[1:40:34] to leave you forsake you seemingly he
[1:40:37] said now the bride will stay while
[1:40:39] preaching to the totally
[1:40:40] lost he said cuz it must be it's end of
[1:40:43] every ministers that
[1:40:45] way I mean we don't want to think to
[1:40:48] that way because we we but we just do
[1:40:51] what we can do and be the lead of God
[1:40:53] see we need to be the lead of the Holy
[1:40:55] Spirit every time we walk in that door
[1:40:57] we ought to be prayed up and in
[1:40:59] desperation right and you don't believe
[1:41:01] it'll work let him get behind that pull
[1:41:03] pit and let and him come out and and win
[1:41:07] that and see and see what God will do
[1:41:09] for us try it one
[1:41:11] time just try it what you got to
[1:41:15] lose well I don't know I better not say
[1:41:17] that either cuz if if if you doubt it
[1:41:20] brother said if God spoke to you through
[1:41:23] somebody and says you heal right thus
[1:41:26] say the Lord you heal and you doubt it
[1:41:29] he said it's going to happen anyway but
[1:41:30] you going to answer for your
[1:41:32] unbelief now I mean he said it I'm
[1:41:35] telling you what he said
[1:41:39] now there they are the Old Testament
[1:41:41] Saints laying there waiting to be
[1:41:42] clothed upon in Paradise he opened up
[1:41:45] the door Abraham said are we going out
[1:41:48] it's almost daylight on Earth let's get
[1:41:49] ready to go Abraham said can we make a
[1:41:52] little wh stop he's talking about that
[1:41:54] Matthew 27 says and many of the bodies
[1:41:56] of the saints that slept in the dust of
[1:41:57] the earth Rose and came out of the city
[1:41:59] and appeared to many in the city I can
[1:42:02] see saor and Abraham coming down the
[1:42:04] street saying oh honey look there
[1:42:06] they've changed these things a little
[1:42:07] bit look around see here how this looks
[1:42:09] somebody said who is that couple there
[1:42:11] it seems like they're strangers they
[1:42:13] said we're recognized brother Brown
[1:42:15] snaps his finger vanished out of their
[1:42:17] sight like he went through the wall you
[1:42:19] know and they didn't even or see him
[1:42:21] come in went out they had glorified
[1:42:24] bodies I don't have no problem with that
[1:42:28] I don't have a bit of problem with that
[1:42:30] whatever they are God has made them and
[1:42:33] wherever they are God's got them in a ho
[1:42:36] because they
[1:42:37] resurrected I don't how he said well no
[1:42:40] nobody has reached immortality God has
[1:42:42] finished the work for these people he's
[1:42:45] finished for them all they got to do is
[1:42:47] come now they I know they don't have to
[1:42:49] be resurrected because you don't it but
[1:42:51] when see God don't resurrect theophanies
[1:42:54] theophanies don't die only bodies is
[1:42:56] resurrected so I'm not saying I don't uh
[1:43:00] I've got my thoughts on it but uh but I
[1:43:02] I'm I'm I want to say just what the
[1:43:06] prophet said and then we we need a
[1:43:08] revelation because he is a keystone
[1:43:11] between the old and the new they're part
[1:43:14] of us they come out of the same dirt
[1:43:16] that we did they was predestinated for a
[1:43:19] place we are predestinated for place and
[1:43:21] then when we finish our predestination
[1:43:23] here we going up and they coming forth
[1:43:26] that's what I'm looking
[1:43:27] at it don't make any difference if
[1:43:30] they're if they're what they're with God
[1:43:33] cuz I can show you right here he took
[1:43:35] them into the kingdom with
[1:43:39] him now what kind of I mean I don't know
[1:43:43] but uh but I know what I think but I I
[1:43:46] just I just I don't want to say what I
[1:43:48] think yeah I don't want to do that
[1:43:52] okay brother Brown snaps his fingers
[1:43:55] they had glorified bodies and they
[1:43:56] appeared back on Earth Hallelujah for a
[1:43:59] first fruits of the proof of God's power
[1:44:01] and the resurrection there they was
[1:44:04] robbed and stri Prince ales PR and took
[1:44:07] death and hell and smothered it up and
[1:44:10] Rose up on the Easter morning and
[1:44:12] entered into the kingdom with him no
[1:44:15] wonder they said bury me in Palestine
[1:44:17] they know that the resurrection was
[1:44:18] going to there now now
[1:44:21] remember what I first
[1:44:23] said what I said you remember what I
[1:44:26] first said when I first started about
[1:44:28] what brother Dale was
[1:44:31] preaching can anybody remember just hold
[1:44:34] you don't say nothing just hold your
[1:44:35] hand up if you remember what he said I
[1:44:36] said it I don't know how many
[1:44:37] times he says whatever God called them
[1:44:41] to they achieved it exactly and that's
[1:44:44] what I that's where I've been coming all
[1:44:46] day see people people everybody in here
[1:44:49] ought hold hands up
[1:44:51] everybody in here ought to hold hands or
[1:44:54] get to this Altar and pray to God show
[1:44:57] me Lord I've staggered around long
[1:45:00] enough not knowing right I listen to
[1:45:03] this one I listen to that one this one
[1:45:04] says this says that not knowing they may
[1:45:06] be saying the same thing yeah and and if
[1:45:09] you ain't careful you'll drive a wedge
[1:45:11] in between them don't do
[1:45:15] that it's God you talking about and he's
[1:45:19] not he's not
[1:45:21] he's not somebody you can play with you
[1:45:24] got to come according to the word right
[1:45:26] the word is a judge not me not brother
[1:45:28] de brother brother Wade brother Bob
[1:45:32] right we're not
[1:45:33] judges but the word that comes forth
[1:45:35] from us the word is the judge he goes
[1:45:38] out right there that if you receive it
[1:45:40] you can you can have it if you believe
[1:45:43] if you really truly believe in a prophet
[1:45:45] and everything he says you can have the
[1:45:47] reward of that prophet and the reward of
[1:45:50] that prophet is a full Revelation that
[1:45:52] he preached
[1:45:54] amen exactly y'all excuse me boy I get
[1:45:58] excited I mean it's it's it's just good
[1:46:00] always to the Bone to me I mean I've
[1:46:03] I've wrestled with this said God I've
[1:46:07] had God said me one time I got wrote I
[1:46:10] got wrote down hold your
[1:46:12] peace hold your
[1:46:14] peace I'll let you know
[1:46:17] when I can show it to you not not say
[1:46:20] somebody's wrong I ain't saying that but
[1:46:22] see it's time you have to wait on God
[1:46:27] right what you what do you think brother
[1:46:29] Dale does you think he don't wait on God
[1:46:32] that he don't talk to God every day and
[1:46:34] every night when he wakes up I know I
[1:46:38] do I'm not just exalting brother brother
[1:46:41] brother Sam I'm just telling you what we
[1:46:44] all ought to be we ought to all be so
[1:46:46] desperate to see the first resurrection
[1:46:49] cuz the first first part of the of
[1:46:53] the Old Testament was Enoch Elijah the
[1:46:57] Lord Jesus Christ and when Lord Jesus
[1:47:00] Christ went up in the Rapture the Old
[1:47:01] Testament Saints raptured with him that
[1:47:03] was the first of the New
[1:47:07] Testament If It Ain't So show
[1:47:09] me show me or either Jesus made two
[1:47:13] raptures and we know he didn't do it he
[1:47:17] didn't do it he was sended up and trans
[1:47:20] transformed himself or how you say that
[1:47:23] into where he come from and come back
[1:47:26] and allowed and allowed the people to
[1:47:28] touch him and to eat fish and all to
[1:47:31] show them what is going to be one of
[1:47:33] these
[1:47:34] days but when the baptism of the Holy
[1:47:37] Ghost come say one word against that he
[1:47:40] you know he said you you say word
[1:47:41] against me I forgive you but when he
[1:47:43] comes now he's here tonight right he's
[1:47:46] here the heir of all things is here in
[1:47:49] the form of the son of
[1:47:51] man in flesh that's the son of man is in
[1:47:55] flesh he was in flesh then s Susan he's
[1:47:59] in flesh now when he was the F the word
[1:48:01] was in his flesh and he was the flesh I
[1:48:03] mean the word was the flesh right there
[1:48:05] then when he comes in you then your
[1:48:07] flesh becomes the word right people
[1:48:10] don't believe that well I can't do that
[1:48:12] you no you're right but God
[1:48:16] can okay let's see
[1:48:19] then
[1:48:21] and he's talking about watch out Sarah
[1:48:22] we been noticed this Spirit like Christ
[1:48:24] did coming through the walls glorified
[1:48:30] body

[1:50:03] Angels was camped around him so he's not
[1:50:05] going to let Satan do and his Devils do

[1:51:05] man all these years can you imagine I
[1:51:09] wouldn't trade places with
[1:51:11] him unless I mean Lord I'd be like that
[1:51:14] song that they was going to send him to
[1:51:17] to Africa he said Lord don't send me to
[1:51:18] Africa he said they lions and tigers and

[1:51:39] when you coming forth that you are
[1:51:42] prevailing that in and God wants you to
[1:51:45] see that and somebody ought to tell you
[1:51:47] about it right you can preach a message
[1:51:51] and go out that door and nobody say
[1:51:53] nothing I remember when we was talking

[1:52:45] Persia
[1:52:46] withheld Gabriel from coming and Michael
[1:52:49] had had to come to loose him and say so
[1:52:52] Satan can't do nothing to you except God
