[0:00] Eyes of My Heart
[0:03] Open the Eyes
[0:19] of my heart
[0:30] I want to see you
[0:35] see
[0:40] climbing
[0:43] shining Glory
[0:45] Glory
[1:00] of your glory
[1:09] Glory Glory
[1:15] Glory over here
[1:26] amen amen amen
[1:34] thank you Lord amen
[1:37] so we just go straight to the reading of
[1:40] the word
[1:41] amen so let's just open our Bible
[1:45] in John chapter 10 another familiar
[1:49] scriptures
[1:52] amen we're so much familiar with the
[1:55] word
[1:56] because we have been part of this word
[1:59] Hallelujah let's start leading from
[2:02] verse 27
[2:05] it says here my ship
[2:08] hear my voice
[2:11] and I know them right
[2:15] those
[2:16] he did for no right
[2:19] he did predestination amen
[2:23] and they follow me
[2:25] and I give unto them
[2:28] eternal life
[2:30] and they shall never perish Hallelujah
[2:34] so how can something that has never
[2:38] begin
[2:39] and will never end perish Hallelujah so
[2:43] when I give unto them eternal life and
[2:44] they shall never perish neither shall
[2:48] any man pluck them out of my hand
[2:51] My Father which gave them me is greater
[2:55] than all
[2:57] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[3:01] my father's hand Hallelujah other people
[3:04] thought it's another hand
[3:06] amen so I don't believe the father has
[3:10] another hand from the Sun
[3:13] because it's the same hand all
[3:14] throughout hallelujah amen so when I
[3:18] give unto them eternal life and they
[3:19] shall never perish neither shall anyone
[3:21] pluck them out of my hand my Father
[3:23] which gave them me is greater than all
[3:26] and no man is able to pluck them out of
[3:29] my father's hand and he said I and my
[3:33] father are one amen hallelujah and
[3:36] that's what I believe because that's
[3:37] what the word said Hallelujah no matter
[3:39] how they try to justify three persons
[3:43] two persons amen I believe there is one
[3:45] God and there is only one personality of
[3:48] God Amen so uh and may God continue to
[3:53] add blessing to his word once again
[3:55] let's bore heads in prayer and that's
[3:57] his inspiration and Lord Jesus we thank
[4:00] you so much this afternoon
[4:03] We Believe Lord that you are the word
[4:06] and not only that Lord you are the
[4:09] author
[4:10] and that's why you are the one that we
[4:13] are approaching this afternoon
[4:15] with a humble Heart Lord and if there is
[4:19] anything wrong that you have found in US
[4:22] Lord Jesus you just
[4:25] Hallelujah through your blood by your
[4:28] blood Amen Let It Be Hallelujah
[4:33] annihilated from your mind and as you
[4:35] promised Lord you have thrown all this
[4:37] transgressions in your sea of
[4:40] forgetfulness oh God as we approach your
[4:43] word once again may you continue to
[4:46] bless us spiritually in Jesus Christ's
[4:48] name everybody say amen amen hallelujah
[4:52] and God bless you you may be seated
[4:55] amen
[4:57] so
[5:03] that's what we believe amen I uh he he
[5:07] is our cheap Shepherd
[5:10] and we are the ship
[5:13] and that's why we don't follow any other
[5:16] voice because we recognize his voice
[5:20] amen and uh that's why we have we have
[5:25] today the Fulfillment of Revelation
[5:27] chapter 10 verse 7 but in the days of
[5:30] The Voice
[5:31] Hallelujah so uh so with the simple
[5:35] thought this afternoon
[5:38] I want to speak about
[5:40] persistence
[5:42] so brother branham's uh brother Branham
[5:45] spoke one time or many times he he spoke
[5:49] about perseverance right so I believe
[5:53] it's also an attitude it's also a
[5:56] character of God by being perseverant
[6:00] amen he's he persevered in the with the
[6:04] same principle and with the same
[6:05] inspiration amen we should have that
[6:08] kind of uh
[6:11] attitude Hallelujah so
[6:16] in the message perseverance let me start
[6:18] with this
[6:20] statement
[6:22] in paragraph 24 but the Bannon defined
[6:27] perseverance he said I would like to
[6:29] take a text from this
[6:32] use one word and that word is
[6:34] perseverant
[6:36] and that was the title of that message
[6:38] and the word perseverance means to be
[6:41] persistent
[6:43] Webster says that it is persistent in
[6:46] making a goal
[6:48] trying to do something and being
[6:51] persistent about it
[6:53] you become perseverant
[6:56] Hallelujah so we we uh we serve a
[7:00] purpose
[7:01] and we know what the purpose of our
[7:05] existence is
[7:07] so men of all ages who has faith in what
[7:11] they are trying to achieve has been
[7:13] perseverant
[7:15] you must have faith in what you are
[7:18] doing amen so praise the Lord so uh
[7:23] brother random quoted this uh this
[7:26] statement when he preached about
[7:28] perseverance and uh
[7:31] he used the text in Matthew chapter 15
[7:34] we're not going to read that let me just
[7:36] uh
[7:37] rephrase it and it is it is about the
[7:41] woman which we who we made mention this
[7:44] morning you know that her daughter was
[7:47] hugely seriously vexed with a certain
[7:50] sickness and she was you know pleading
[7:54] for the Lord and uh
[7:57] he she addressed uh the Lord with a
[8:03] title that was not applicable in that
[8:06] day amen and she said uh son of David
[8:11] amen but somehow in the process because
[8:13] uh
[8:15] the woman had had a certain character
[8:18] and attitude a persevering uh attitude
[8:23] and so the Lord was so pleased amen and
[8:27] uh uh you know
[8:30] it takes a genuine character to be
[8:33] perseverant to be persistent in in what
[8:37] you do and and uh to be perseverant is
[8:41] uh not just trying to do something and
[8:45] uh be disappointed the first time the
[8:48] second time third time or even more amen
[8:51] so uh to to to apply the principle of of
[8:55] being perseverant is to you know
[8:59] probably be this up disappointed be
[9:02] upset somehow a number of times okay but
[9:05] you push through with it so that's like
[9:07] that's what brother Benham said men of
[9:09] all ages who has faith in what they're
[9:12] trying to achieve has been perseverance
[9:14] so I believe because amen because this
[9:17] woman amen this woman so loved her
[9:21] daughter and you know uh that kind of
[9:26] love put him in a desperate condition
[9:29] amen and that that is a a a a desperate
[9:33] and and it's Faith amen that she
[9:36] believed and that even in a certain you
[9:39] know even if she was given a little
[9:42] opportunity
[9:44] he's going to take that opportunity amen
[9:47] so you know uh uh she had no other
[9:51] option
[9:53] you know when she was rejected the very
[9:55] first time she had no other option you
[9:57] know she didn't have to go to another
[10:00] church another another Minister because
[10:03] she had no other option she believed
[10:06] that the the need she had at that very
[10:09] time only the Lord could give it
[10:12] and so she had no other option but the
[10:15] Lord Jesus cried and so she followed
[10:17] through amen and he said it's not meat
[10:19] you know to uh to to give the the
[10:23] children's bread to a dog
[10:27] amen and what an address you know and
[10:29] you know uh Gentiles at that time were
[10:31] considered as dogs
[10:33] they were nothing Hallelujah but somehow
[10:37] you know uh uh this woman said you know
[10:40] uh uh yep dogs even eat of the crumbs
[10:43] which fall from their master's table
[10:45] even he said she did not uh uh refuse to
[10:50] be called dog she did not reacted wildly
[10:53] being addressed with that kind of uh
[10:56] name you know and be considered a dog
[10:59] and she said truth Lord
[11:02] Hallelujah but even dogs amen even dogs
[11:07] and you know uh dogs actually don't eat
[11:10] crumbs
[11:12] it's the puppy
[11:16] so she was so little to be called dog
[11:21] but even then she made herself a little
[11:23] more
[11:24] amen and that really caught
[11:29] the Lord Jesus Christ amen and and and
[11:33] and and Jesus answered and said unto her
[11:36] oh woman
[11:37] great is thy faith Hallelujah great is
[11:42] thy faith Hallelujah and her daughter
[11:45] was made hul from that very hour
[11:48] Hallelujah so that that is some kind of
[11:51] a persevering character and that was
[11:54] attributed to that woman right but this
[11:57] afternoon I would like to uh to to to to
[12:00] approach perseverance from another angle
[12:03] and this is not the woman because the
[12:06] woman always typed the church right and
[12:09] uh we of course we have that kind of
[12:11] attitude but somehow uh we have to see
[12:14] here that in our need amen it is not
[12:18] only us who are so perseverant who are
[12:21] so persistent and so that's why I would
[12:24] like to talk about our persistent God
[12:27] this afternoon amen so it's not me it's
[12:30] not you but it is God who is persistent
[12:33] Hallelujah so this is about our
[12:36] persistent God so he said in in verse 27
[12:39] my sheep hear my voice and I know them
[12:42] and they follow me amen so you see the
[12:46] the
[12:47] uh the the the the point here the bottom
[12:50] line here is that he knows me
[12:54] he knows who I am Hallelujah and that is
[12:59] what really counts
[13:00] because he knew us not only the moment
[13:04] we baptized in the name of the Lord
[13:05] Jesus Christ not the moment we heard
[13:07] this message but even before
[13:10] Hallelujah the foundation of the world
[13:12] he knew me right right and because he
[13:16] knew me amen
[13:18] he knows what he's going to do amen uh
[13:23] that in that way you know I I will hear
[13:25] his voice I will hear his message and I
[13:28] will react unto them into it amen and I
[13:31] will follow his voice you know uh the
[13:35] Lord did not you know the lion did not
[13:37] come here to be the lamb and say uh
[13:40] brother Branham said oh maybe I have to
[13:42] die at the cross and probably they will
[13:44] pity me and they will believe me no he
[13:48] came down here
[13:50] amen for a purpose
[13:52] okay and just like that that parable of
[13:56] that the Good Samaritan you know there
[13:59] was a man who came down from Jerusalem
[14:02] to Jericho amen so this man he was
[14:05] robbed you know and and he was abused
[14:08] but this man was not born in Jericho
[14:11] right he came down from Jerusalem to
[14:14] Jericho amen and that Good Samaritan who
[14:17] came down also came where he was
[14:20] amen and so we came from we there's a
[14:24] coming New Jerusalem but actually that
[14:27] New Jerusalem is the same Jerusalem
[14:29] where we were amen and so by somebody
[14:32] who who come from that place amen I come
[14:36] from the father I go back to the father
[14:38] Hallelujah so if I did not come from
[14:40] that
[14:41] there's no way for me to go back
[14:44] Hallelujah anybody did not come from
[14:46] that place then there must be no reason
[14:49] for him to go down right amen and so all
[14:52] this thought we believe amen have been
[14:55] uh clarified
[14:58] to us through the message of the hour
[15:01] amen he said I give unto them eternal
[15:03] life and they shall never perish neither
[15:06] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[15:09] my Father which gave them me is greater
[15:11] than all and no man is able to plug them
[15:14] out of my father's hand I believe this
[15:16] is the same hand Hallelujah there is no
[15:18] other hand but it's the same hand
[15:20] Hallelujah so you see now uh that's why
[15:24] in the church ages we have you know the
[15:27] the the the son of man you know we know
[15:30] the Lord Jesus Christ amen he is walking
[15:33] in the midst of the seven golden
[15:34] candlesticks right and so in his right
[15:37] hand there are seven stars Hallelujah so
[15:41] in order to be in the hand of the Lord
[15:45] we must be identified with one of those
[15:48] Stars Hallelujah because uh these Seven
[15:52] stars are in his hand so if we are
[15:55] identified to any of those Seven Stars
[15:58] then we are
[16:00] in his hand right and because we are
[16:03] identified and I believe we're only
[16:05] fulfilling scriptures in this generation
[16:07] so I believe we are identified with that
[16:10] seven star
[16:12] Hallelujah the reason why I live in this
[16:15] generation the reason why we live in
[16:17] this generation is because we are
[16:19] identified with that seven star and so
[16:22] because we are in that right hand of the
[16:26] Lord amen so because we're being
[16:28] identified then there's no way
[16:30] nobody can pluck us out of his hand as
[16:35] long as we are identified with the
[16:37] message of the Seven Star Hallelujah
[16:40] Where We Belong amen so no one nobody
[16:44] can discredit you nobody can take you
[16:46] out Hallelujah nobody can disregard what
[16:49] you're doing for the glory of the Lord
[16:51] amen as long as we stand on the message
[16:53] as long as we believe and believe what
[16:56] this message is telling us hallelujah so
[16:59] we are being identified with that star
[17:02] amen that have been sent in this
[17:05] generation Hallelujah so in that way you
[17:07] know there's nothing we can do about it
[17:09] you know sometimes if we are the only
[17:11] one who's holding the hand of the Lord
[17:13] you know we get tired
[17:17] you know the depression the uh if you
[17:20] look at this what's happening to the
[17:22] message people who used to believe this
[17:24] message and now they disbelieve the
[17:26] message before they were promoting this
[17:29] cloud and they now they disbelieve the
[17:31] cloud amen you get tired
[17:34] amen so if you're the only one holding
[17:38] the hand of the Lord
[17:40] you can lose your grip amen
[17:44] so that's why he did not say whoever
[17:47] hold my hand
[17:50] he said amen neither shall any man pluck
[17:54] them out of my hand
[17:56] amen so if we are apart if we are
[18:00] predestinated if we were uh uh uh among
[18:04] those whom he did for new for new amen
[18:08] he did for no
[18:10] then there's no way we can get out of
[18:13] his hand
[18:14] I may lose grip I may have lose the grip
[18:17] or somebody may have lose the grip
[18:21] but he kept on holding me
[18:25] Hallelujah he kept on holding me
[18:27] Hallelujah so even if I lose the grip
[18:30] but he held my hand and nobody can take
[18:31] me out of his hand Hallelujah so that's
[18:34] why amen so I believe this is the same
[18:37] thing why you know I I remember when
[18:39] you know when he was in front of the
[18:41] tumoblazarus amen and uh you know a lot
[18:45] of a lot of things have happened you
[18:47] know he did not come while Lazarus had
[18:49] uh had had probably a fever
[18:53] and the the situation get worse and
[18:56] worse and worse and then he uh he died
[18:59] and he had they had their funeral and
[19:02] and and and and and and they passed you
[19:05] know probably Jesus was there just
[19:07] watching and they brought him to the
[19:09] cemetery
[19:11] amen and then later on Jesus came
[19:15] Hallelujah it was done for a purpose
[19:18] amen because something to take place
[19:21] that the Lord will be glorified
[19:23] Hallelujah and so when he you know when
[19:26] he when he asked where he's where is
[19:28] Lazarus and then he asked the the women
[19:30] to push the Rock
[19:32] and I could imagine some other people
[19:35] who were just watching and say look at
[19:37] this man you know there are many men
[19:39] here and how come he he asked the women
[19:41] to push the Rock
[19:44] they're weaker vessels he said and they
[19:46] and now there he is asking them to push
[19:49] the Rock Amen but somebody had to
[19:51] respond to the word right
[19:53] and these women you know they were in
[19:56] the right place at the right time amen
[19:59] and when they heard the voice
[20:03] amen they just obeyed the word amen
[20:05] because somebody must hurt hear and obey
[20:09] the word amen and it can in it and it is
[20:13] it is being done then something has to
[20:15] take place Hallelujah so uh the women
[20:19] posed The Rock
[20:20] amen and so the the cave opened up
[20:24] and then you know Jesus called the name
[20:27] of Lazarus
[20:29] and because he is the resurrection he
[20:31] had to be accurate he had to name
[20:33] Lazarus otherwise everybody brother
[20:35] Branham said everybody uh uh in that uh
[20:39] Sepulcher you know we will live again
[20:42] you know they will rise from the dead
[20:45] so he had to call Lazarus amen and so he
[20:48] said Lazarus he named the he named
[20:50] Lazarus amen come forth and that voice
[20:53] echoed you know everybody heard the
[20:55] voice amen and that sound that voice
[20:57] came into that cave and it kept on
[20:59] echoing amen and and and and and the
[21:02] word said God said my word will not
[21:05] return unto me void so if that voice
[21:08] called Lazarus amen that voice must
[21:11] reach Lazarus wherever he is amen so
[21:14] that the word will come back amen and it
[21:17] has amen it will not be in vain amen
[21:20] Lazarus must come amen and so you know
[21:24] uh that that boy is echoed in that cave
[21:27] you know and then but but the but the
[21:30] body was lifeless
[21:31] amen and that body which is which was
[21:34] lifeless you know but but the word will
[21:36] not come in Back to the Lord in vain and
[21:40] so when that voice amen kept on the
[21:43] echoing in this Dimension it had to go
[21:46] into another dimension Hallelujah it has
[21:48] to go into another dimension and I would
[21:50] imagine you know Allah has been
[21:53] comforted by Abraham in another
[21:56] dimension and then and you know they had
[21:58] good Fellowship he was being comforted
[22:01] amen but but suddenly there was a voice
[22:03] amen and Lazarus said I heard that voice
[22:07] and I recognized that voice that's the
[22:10] voice of my pastor Hallelujah
[22:14] Abraham I enjoyed the fellowship I'm
[22:16] fully fully much comforted but I had to
[22:20] say goodbye for a while because I need
[22:22] to obey The Voice Hallelujah he named me
[22:26] and I need to go back Hallelujah so he
[22:29] came back to this Dimension Hallelujah
[22:31] in Lazarus came back to life Hallelujah
[22:34] so the boys amen the word will not
[22:37] return unto him void so I believe the
[22:39] same thing today the message of the hour
[22:42] keep on echoing and occuring and echoing
[22:45] Hallelujah so that the seeds that have
[22:48] been predestinated but the Venom said
[22:50] when God created the seeds were already
[22:52] there
[22:53] amen the seats were already dead they
[22:56] have they they they only needed
[22:58] something amen that they must be called
[23:01] amen and then suddenly they they grow
[23:04] and mature and bear fruits and all this
[23:06] thing amen according to God's perfect
[23:08] time so that what have happened
[23:11] Amen to each and every one of us we came
[23:14] from different uh you know uh lodges
[23:20] various denominations
[23:22] amen various cemeteries
[23:26] amen
[23:30] but there's a message
[23:31] so I believe this message will keep on
[23:33] echoing
[23:35] amen until that last predestinated scene
[23:39] amen will go back into the glory
[23:42] amen I'm sorry so you see
[23:46] so the the uh my ship hear my voice and
[23:49] I know them amen and so you see uh so
[23:53] now in here we we have to identify
[23:57] Lazarus was dead he was in another
[23:59] dimension but that voice
[24:02] that word
[24:04] was perseverant right
[24:07] persistent
[24:09] amen enriching
[24:12] as far as going Beyond another dimension
[24:15] to bring Lazarus back to prove that his
[24:19] word
[24:20] has power
[24:21] amen so uh that's why I remember you
[24:26] know Edison you know brother Branham
[24:28] said man of all ages amen they're trying
[24:31] to achieve they have to be perseverance
[24:33] so one time Thomas Alba Edison you know
[24:35] here we have these lights amen but it
[24:38] that it didn't happen overnight right
[24:41] amen
[24:43] so when he was you know when he was a
[24:47] uh trying to do to achieve what he had
[24:50] in his mind in his thoughts
[24:52] we he know he it is real but he he was
[24:56] he he started to figure out and do
[24:59] something you know and so when when uh
[25:03] when he became successful
[25:06] and he was interviewed and one of the
[25:09] reporters asked him uh okay Mr Edison
[25:14] because they know he said how how does
[25:17] it feel
[25:19] to fail 1000 times before becoming
[25:24] successful
[25:25] how does it feel one of the reporters
[25:28] how does it feel to fail a thousand
[25:31] times
[25:32] before
[25:34] you became successful
[25:36] and you know Edison replied
[25:39] I did not fail 1000 times
[25:45] he said the light bulb in fact was an
[25:49] invention with a thousand steps
[25:56] so to other people they say he failed a
[26:00] thousand a thousand times but for him
[26:03] who's doing the job it only took him a
[26:06] thousand steps amen so because because
[26:10] of that positive attitude brought him
[26:13] into a persevering character to achieve
[26:15] something Hallelujah and you see that is
[26:18] on this natural side so how much more
[26:21] brothers and sisters that if we are
[26:24] doing something for the Lord
[26:26] Hallelujah and we are placed here and
[26:30] that we we know and we believe you know
[26:32] that that uh that God will fulfill his
[26:35] promises upon us so we we don't have to
[26:39] stop there's no way of backing out
[26:41] amen time is too short to go back
[26:44] time is too short to go back we just
[26:47] have to be you know to to take this
[26:49] character of the Lord and and keep on
[26:51] going and keep on going until you know
[26:54] we hit the road and we say goodbye to
[26:56] this earth Hallelujah and there's a body
[26:59] change now
[27:05] part of the scripture that for a while I
[27:08] was thinking how come you know Jesus
[27:11] said this statement
[27:13] and so I just followed through through
[27:16] and through and and I saw something and
[27:18] I I I I I pray that this will be a
[27:20] blessing to you in Mark chapter 14
[27:24] 27 to 30.
[27:27] this speaks about Peter's you know
[27:30] loyalty upon the Lord and then his
[27:33] denial and uh his justification
[27:37] amen and so in verse 27 Mark 14 and
[27:41] Jesus said unto them all ye shall be
[27:44] offended because of me this night for it
[27:48] is written I will Smite the shepherd and
[27:52] the ship shall be scattered
[27:55] but after that I am risen I will go
[27:59] before you into Galilee
[28:02] but Peter said unto him although all
[28:05] shall be offended yet will not I and
[28:09] Jesus said unto him verily I say unto
[28:12] thee that this day even in this night
[28:15] before the Cockroach twice Thou shalt
[28:19] deny me Thrice amen so what a word
[28:23] to be spoken by the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:26] amen to a man who has just declared his
[28:29] loyalty
[28:30] and and upon saying you know when he
[28:33] said the shepherd will be smitten and
[28:35] the Sheep shall be scattered so Peter
[28:38] knew that the Sheep was the Lord Jesus
[28:40] Christ and he was part of the shepherd
[28:42] and so he said Lord not me
[28:45] amen not me I'm not going to leave you
[28:49] I'm not going to forsake you
[28:52] amen but Jesus knew
[28:56] right amen
[28:57] because Jesus knew what will happen
[29:00] because he knew from the beginning to
[29:03] the end he is the Alpha and the Omega
[29:05] he's the author and the finisher
[29:08] amen so he knew that night Peter will
[29:12] deny him three times
[29:14] Hallelujah and even at that night Jesus
[29:17] said Peter
[29:18] when you are converted right
[29:21] right strengthen thy Brethren oh come to
[29:23] think of that three years and a half
[29:26] Peter was with the Lord and yet not
[29:29] converted right
[29:31] right amen that's why he could not
[29:32] strengthen his Brethren amen
[29:36] so you see
[29:38] at this time the word of the Lord had
[29:40] been proven although Peter was declaring
[29:44] I'm not going to leave you Lord amen uh
[29:49] everybody might be offended but not me
[29:52] Lord and Jesus looked at his eyes and
[29:55] said you know uh
[29:58] but after that I am risen I will go
[30:01] before you into Galilee but Peter said
[30:03] unto him although all shall be offended
[30:04] yet will not I and Jesus said unto him
[30:07] verily I say unto thee that this day
[30:09] even in this night before the Cockrell
[30:12] tries twice Thou shalt deny me Thrice
[30:15] amen so it only proved that Jesus knew
[30:19] what will take place
[30:21] amen but somehow
[30:23] he already said but
[30:26] after that I am risen
[30:29] I will go before you into Galilee so
[30:33] while I was reading this how come Jesus
[30:36] said you know Galilee has nothing to do
[30:39] with it it looks like why should Jesus
[30:41] say but after I'm risen I will go before
[30:44] you into Galilee amen and so I look at
[30:47] it once again and I followed three what
[30:49] have happened in the Sea of Galilee amen
[30:51] and if we're going to look back in
[30:53] Matthew chapter 4 Amen in chapter in
[30:57] chapter 4 of Matthew amen let's follow
[31:00] this in in verse 18 and 19.
[31:03] and Jesus walking
[31:06] by the Sea of Galilee
[31:09] sotu Brethren Simon called Peter and
[31:13] Andrew his brother casting a net into
[31:16] the sea for they were Fishers
[31:19] and he say it unto them
[31:22] follow me
[31:24] and I will make you Fishers of Men
[31:27] amen so now I I I I can't realize why
[31:32] Jesus said but after I am reason again
[31:35] amen you're going to deny me three times
[31:37] this night
[31:38] but after I am reason again I will go
[31:41] before you into Galilee amen now brother
[31:45] Branham said you know you may have a
[31:48] loose grip of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[31:50] but but by the time you recognize amen
[31:53] you go back where you love him and
[31:55] you're going to find him there waiting
[31:57] for you amen and so uh this is the time
[32:01] you know so now this gave me a clue why
[32:04] Jesus amen is going going before them
[32:08] into the Sea of Galilee because that was
[32:12] their first experience of their call
[32:16] amen so you see Jesus walking by the Sea
[32:19] of Galilee so two Brethren Simon called
[32:21] Peter and he was talking to Peter that
[32:24] night he was to be arrested and Andrew
[32:26] his brother casting a net into the sea
[32:28] for they were Fishers so now all through
[32:31] their life amen they just go out and
[32:35] they know that they live
[32:37] amen they fish in order to live amen
[32:41] that's their purpose but for them you
[32:43] know we have to live and so that's why
[32:44] we have to fish so they fish in order to
[32:47] live amen but when the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:50] met them amen God had to turn amen
[32:54] another another
[32:57] way of their life they have to meet the
[33:00] junction of their time amen another
[33:02] Direction in their life before they were
[33:04] fishing to live amen but Jesus now told
[33:07] them and he said unto them follow me and
[33:10] I will make you Fishers of Men
[33:11] Hallelujah in other words he's saying
[33:13] you you don't face to live but you live
[33:17] in order to fish amen and I'm going to
[33:21] make you Fishers of Men amen so since
[33:24] then you know they followed the Lord
[33:26] Jesus Christ Hallelujah and so if you
[33:29] remember you know it's very much
[33:31] important how we go back
[33:33] amen where we left him just like in the
[33:36] church ages they left their first love
[33:37] amen and goddess too has to send a
[33:40] message of restoration that's why this
[33:42] is not actually a new message this is a
[33:44] message of restoration Amen to bring us
[33:47] back Amen to to what they have left they
[33:50] per they left their first lap so the
[33:52] same thing with the disciples amen they
[33:54] have this experience before and they had
[33:57] that experience in the Sea of Galilee so
[34:00] now I have an idea that at that same
[34:02] evening where Jesus was about to be
[34:04] arrested he knew they he had he had a
[34:07] hard time in the Garden of Gethsemane
[34:10] amen he prayed alone and he was watching
[34:13] the disciples that could not even stay
[34:15] with him another hour to pray with him
[34:18] and while he was in The Garden of
[34:20] Gethsemane you know he was praying alone
[34:23] and the Bible said you know he had no
[34:25] more tears and blood came down came out
[34:28] of his eyes because you know and and he
[34:31] said father amen
[34:33] you know if this cup will pass from me
[34:37] amen so I believe amen at that point
[34:41] when when the Devils heard that you know
[34:44] all those trees in the Garden of
[34:46] Gethsemane amen there were demons
[34:49] Oh yeah and when Jesus was crying you
[34:53] know they they had their own revivals
[34:55] probably the demons were jumping from
[34:57] one branch to another he said look at
[34:59] them look at him he cannot make it much
[35:03] more when they said father amen if only
[35:06] if this cup passed from me Hallelujah
[35:09] but when he said amen when he said but
[35:13] not my will father but your will be done
[35:16] amen and so the demons say oh amen they
[35:20] got so disappointed Hallelujah because
[35:22] he said the right word amen and the
[35:26] Bible said the Angels Came the Angels
[35:28] Came Amen to strengthen him Hallelujah
[35:32] so you know it's the same thing you know
[35:34] when we encounter a lot of experiences
[35:36] struggles in life amen and then we come
[35:40] to recognize at a certain point Lord
[35:42] amen you have must have a reason amen
[35:45] why you put me in this situation and
[35:47] that's why I'm saying Lord not my will
[35:50] but your will be done and that time
[35:52] something will take place because why
[35:55] say an angel is being sent to us Amen to
[35:59] strengthen us hallelujah so he said you
[36:02] know while he was in The Garden of
[36:05] Gethsemane he had this before the
[36:08] physical torture happened to him there
[36:11] was a mental torture that was going on
[36:13] you know because demons have access in
[36:17] the our imagination you know and and in
[36:20] the spirit in that realm you know they
[36:22] could torment and torture the Lord Jesus
[36:24] Christ to for him to imagine what's
[36:27] going to to happen to him how many
[36:29] luscious how many you oh
[36:33] all these things
[36:35] but even then
[36:37] he was persistent not my will father
[36:41] but your will be done
[36:43] Hallelujah and something happened and so
[36:46] you see you know that's why you know
[36:49] when right now I fully understood why
[36:52] Jesus said
[36:53] after I'm risen again
[36:55] see you in Galilee Hallelujah and so in
[36:59] between from that night Amen in between
[37:02] a lot of things have happened you know
[37:04] if we follow uh these scriptures in John
[37:07] chapter 3 20 verses 16 and 17 you know
[37:11] when uh he he after his death burial and
[37:15] resurrection and on the third day you
[37:18] know in verse 16 in John chapter 20 it
[37:21] says Jesus said unto her
[37:23] Mary she turned herself in saith unto
[37:27] him rabboni which is to say master
[37:32] Jesus said unto her touch me not for I
[37:34] am not yet ascended to my father
[37:37] but go to my brethren and say unto them
[37:39] I Ascend unto my father and your father
[37:43] amen and to my God and your God so this
[37:47] was the same morning when when Mary was
[37:49] looking for the body of the Lord Jesus
[37:51] Christ and she didn't find it amen and
[37:54] suddenly you know he he even she even
[37:57] mistaken him to be the gardener
[38:00] amen and and and and but when Jesus
[38:04] mentioned his name
[38:07] amen it became familiar
[38:10] Mary
[38:11] and then when she turned herself and and
[38:14] then she recognized him and she
[38:17] addressed him raboni which is to say
[38:19] master yes and out of excitement out of
[38:23] joy
[38:24] Mary wanted to touch Jesus amen
[38:29] but Jesus said unto her
[38:31] touch me not
[38:33] amen
[38:35] for I am not yet ascended to my father
[38:39] Hallelujah and then if we continue down
[38:41] continue on in verse 19 uh he says then
[38:45] the same day at evening being the first
[38:47] day of the week when the doors were shot
[38:50] where the disciples were assembled for
[38:52] fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in
[38:56] the midst and say it unto them peace be
[39:00] unto you
[39:01] and when he had so said he should unto
[39:03] them his hands and his side then were
[39:06] the disciples glad when they saw the
[39:09] Lord
[39:09] then said Jesus to them again
[39:12] peace be unto you as my father had sent
[39:15] me even so send I you and when he had
[39:19] said this he breathered on them and say
[39:22] it unto them receive be the Holy Ghost
[39:25] whosoever since ye remit they are
[39:28] remitted unto them and whosoever since
[39:31] ye retain they are retained but
[39:35] one of them right did not attend the
[39:38] fellowship yeah
[39:41] yeah but Thomas one of the 12 called the
[39:43] demos was not with them when Jesus
[39:47] the other disciples that were said unto
[39:49] him we have seen the Lord but he said
[39:51] unto them except I shall see in his
[39:53] hands the print of the nails and put my
[39:57] finger into the print of the nails and
[39:59] trust my hand into his side I will not
[40:02] believe
[40:03] Hallelujah and you know sometimes it
[40:06] happens in the church you know people
[40:07] who you know oh
[40:11] the Lord blessed us last Sunday Last
[40:14] prayer meeting amen
[40:16] and people will just say oh
[40:19] no problem I was online
[40:22] yeah
[40:23] yeah amen
[40:28] my brother Branham said stay in the line
[40:31] he did not say stay online
[40:38] and so because you know people who
[40:41] attend the meeting regularly and they
[40:43] have the joy you know to travel and uh
[40:47] Rejoice with the other believers amen
[40:50] and then suddenly this one who who
[40:53] failed to uh to attend the prayer
[40:56] meeting probably
[40:58] you know people doing like that
[41:00] sometimes they justify you know and
[41:03] saying you know we also prayed in the
[41:05] house you know it's it's also scriptural
[41:07] to pray in the house and close your door
[41:09] closer close it and you just pray and
[41:11] you're you know you're going to
[41:13] experience amen but brother Branham said
[41:15] don't forget your prayer meetings amen
[41:18] where are those you know uh so you see
[41:21] here comes the demos
[41:23] and he was so proud to say oh except
[41:28] except I shall see in his hands and
[41:30] print of the nails and put my finger
[41:32] into the print of the nails and thrust
[41:34] my hand into his side I will not believe
[41:38] amen notice that the demos or Thomas was
[41:40] requiring something
[41:44] from the Lord
[41:45] that Jesus denied Mary
[41:49] amen Mary wanted to to touch him but
[41:54] Jesus said touch me now right right amen
[41:56] of course something happened in between
[41:58] and he had to go up to present uh uh the
[42:02] blood and all the sort and then in verse
[42:04] 26 and after eight days again
[42:07] his disciples were within and Thomas
[42:11] with them
[42:12] then came Jesus the doors being shot and
[42:15] stood in the midst and said Peace be
[42:17] unto you
[42:19] amen
[42:21] then he say it to Thomas now watch now
[42:25] there were many other people
[42:27] there were many other believers
[42:30] amen but because he knew what have
[42:32] happened eight days ago he knew what he
[42:35] what what Peter said
[42:37] so he came back eight days after
[42:41] for Thomas
[42:43] amen notice that eight days ago he
[42:46] denied Mary to touch him
[42:49] and then by uh uh by by knowing that
[42:53] Thomas made mention unless
[42:56] I put my finger
[42:58] in his wounds in his hands and in his
[43:01] sight I will not believe
[43:04] amen
[43:07] so Jesus has to go back
[43:10] after fulfilling something
[43:13] amen and he came back eight days after
[43:18] for Thomas he said Peace be unto you
[43:23] then came Jesus amen and and and and and
[43:26] and Thomas with them and then came Jesus
[43:29] the doors being shot and stood in the
[43:31] midst and said Peace be unto you then
[43:33] say it he to Thomas amen without further
[43:36] ado he approached Thomas and he said no
[43:40] Thomas
[43:42] amen if touching
[43:45] will cause you to believe
[43:48] Hallelujah I did not allow Mary to touch
[43:51] me eight days ago
[43:53] but I came back to you
[43:55] amen he said reach hide their thy finger
[43:58] and behold my hands and reach tighter
[44:02] thy hand and trust it into my side and
[44:06] be not faithless but believing and
[44:09] Thomas answered and said unto him my
[44:12] Lord and my God hallelujah now what I'm
[44:15] trying to say brothers and sisters is
[44:17] that you know after Jesus resurrection
[44:21] he had no time going back to Pilate
[44:26] to rebuke Pilate
[44:28] he did not go back to cayapas right
[44:31] Hallelujah
[44:32] when the the
[44:35] uh when the graves
[44:38] when the grave was opened when The Rock
[44:42] Amen that was the place in front of that
[44:45] cave
[44:46] when he broke it
[44:48] and then he came out Hallelujah
[44:52] he did not spend any time to the
[44:56] unbelievers
[44:58] he didn't spend no more time to the
[45:01] make-believers
[45:03] but he spent his time
[45:06] appearing
[45:08] amen
[45:10] to his disciples who are this the
[45:13] predestinated sons of God Daughters of
[45:17] God that's the same thing when the seals
[45:19] were opened it's no more a public show
[45:23] this is only for the bride
[45:26] after the opening of the seal the same
[45:28] thing as the opening of that grave for
[45:30] the Lord Jesus Christ he only appeared
[45:33] he only approached
[45:36] amen the Believers in that generation
[45:40] and to count everyone in no matter what
[45:45] kind of condition they wear
[45:47] Hallelujah the demos became you know he
[45:51] he doubted even the visitation of the
[45:54] Lord Jesus Christ eight days ago Peter
[45:57] denied him
[45:59] three times
[46:01] but even then you know he uh Jesus had
[46:04] already an answer
[46:06] you're going to deny me three times
[46:08] before the cockroach amen but even then
[46:13] I am going before you into Galilee so
[46:17] the answer is already there
[46:19] the solution was already there the
[46:23] problem wasn't done yet
[46:25] amen the unbelieving Peter was not able
[46:29] to do amen he didn't even know he was
[46:32] able to do that
[46:34] but Jesus had already a solution
[46:37] amen I'm going to go before you into the
[46:41] sea or into Galilee amen so now we know
[46:44] that Jesus had purpose amen and so if we
[46:47] move on Amen and let's go in John
[46:50] chapter 21 because this is all the
[46:52] scriptures after the resurrection of the
[46:55] Lord Jesus Christ amen so Peter of
[46:58] course uh they will already in that
[47:01] condition it looks like they were so
[47:03] helpless and in verse 1 he said after
[47:05] these things chapter 21 of John Jesus
[47:09] showed himself again to the Disciples of
[47:11] the Sea of Tiberius of course Tiberius
[47:13] and Galilee were the same place and on
[47:16] this why should he himself
[47:19] there were together Simon Peter and
[47:22] Thomas called the Demus and Nathaniel
[47:25] obana in Galilee and the sons of sebedee
[47:28] and two other obese disciples now notice
[47:30] Simon Peter said unto them after denying
[47:33] Jesus three times
[47:35] amen and now Simon Peter said unto them
[47:38] I go fishing
[47:42] amen
[47:43] I go fishing
[47:45] maybe some of his Nets when Jesus called
[47:48] him you know he just hide it in the
[47:52] and now amen he was in this bus leading
[47:56] condition
[47:57] he took his net once again and go back
[48:00] where what he was doing before God
[48:03] called him amen not even knowing
[48:07] amen that because Jesus our lord is
[48:11] always on top of the situation because
[48:13] he already made a declaration I'm going
[48:17] before you into Galilee amen so even in
[48:21] that box leading condition Peter was
[48:24] moving amen but he did not know he was
[48:27] already moving in order to fulfill the
[48:30] word of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah so he
[48:33] said no I'm I go fishing
[48:35] and you know because he was a leader you
[48:38] know God that don't don't take away the
[48:40] the gift into you amen so he already
[48:43] although he was backslidden but but the
[48:46] leadership was still there so when he
[48:48] said I go fishing his congregation said
[48:50] they say unto him we also go with thee
[48:55] they went forth and entered into a ship
[48:58] immediately and that night they caught
[49:01] nothing
[49:01] right amen so probably when so let's go
[49:04] fishing I go fishing we go we go with
[49:06] you amen and so when they pass through
[49:09] and probably they saw uh a certain man
[49:12] along the way and you know he he was uh
[49:16] you know doing something there's a
[49:18] little fire and a fish on top of it amen
[49:20] and he said come there's a there's a
[49:22] good catch probably look at that man
[49:25] yeah he got something and we're going to
[49:27] cut to catch a lot of fish tonight but
[49:30] when they when they throw the net
[49:32] nothing
[49:33] amen
[49:37] they caught nothing
[49:40] then
[49:43] but when the morning was now come Jesus
[49:46] stood on the shore
[49:47] but the disciples knew not that it was
[49:50] Jesus
[49:51] amen notice now Jesus said I shall go
[49:55] before you
[49:57] into Galilee
[49:58] so who came first
[50:03] then Jesus said unto them
[50:06] children heavy enemy
[50:09] amen so he he addressed them children
[50:14] have ye enemy
[50:17] they answered him no and he said unto
[50:19] them cast the net on the right side of
[50:22] the ship and ye shall find
[50:25] they cast therefore and now they were
[50:28] not able to draw it from the multitude
[50:30] of fishes now what's the difference
[50:33] overnight they were they were throwing
[50:35] the same net on the same spot
[50:40] but they were throwing the net on their
[50:42] own
[50:44] but this time they were throwing the net
[50:46] in obedience to the word hallelujah so
[50:51] you see that's why there is a difference
[50:53] you know when you do something
[50:56] but you're just obeying amen your
[50:59] opinion our our inspiration probably but
[51:03] when we do something in obedience to the
[51:06] word it will give us results Hallelujah
[51:09] so now they they they did the same thing
[51:12] they throw the same net into the same
[51:14] sea amen but the difference is that now
[51:17] they are obeying the word amen and so
[51:21] when they obeyed the word
[51:23] they could not draw it from the
[51:25] multitude of fishes therefore the
[51:27] disciple whom Jesus loved say it unto
[51:29] Peter it is the Lord so John amen he
[51:33] recognized who was speaking to them
[51:35] amen and he said come on be there
[51:38] that's the Lord
[51:40] amen
[51:42] no
[51:43] look how Bach's leading Peter was
[51:46] when Simon Peter heard that it was the
[51:49] Lord
[51:50] you know before he was preaching you
[51:52] know when he preached Holiness how how
[51:55] women should dress themselves how
[51:58] Brothers you know but this time look
[52:01] Peter heard that it was the Lord he got
[52:03] his Fisher's coat unto him for he was
[52:06] naked yeah
[52:08] and did cast himself into the sea
[52:11] and that's it
[52:13] in the Sea of Galilee
[52:15] and I would like to just put a little
[52:18] drama on this amen that when Peter
[52:20] jumped into the Sea of Galilee
[52:23] amen it was it was done with the purpose
[52:26] Jesus said after I am risen again I will
[52:30] go before you into Galilee
[52:33] amen so probably when he jumped into the
[52:35] Sea of Galilee and he tried probably to
[52:38] drown himself out of guilt
[52:40] Hallelujah he wanted to die
[52:44] and here comes the Lord after all these
[52:47] things I denied him three times
[52:49] amen and probably when he was already
[52:51] gasping for breath he had to go up and
[52:54] probably hid himself behind the boat
[52:56] amen and and and and and and and he
[52:59] could you know peep in suddenly and he
[53:02] could see amen along the coast and he
[53:05] could identify that same spot and and
[53:08] and and and and and it brought into his
[53:10] remembrance Hallelujah probably when he
[53:13] saw that portion of that Coast he said
[53:16] that that's the place where we first met
[53:18] the Lord Jesus that was the the first
[53:21] place amen where he called us to to
[53:24] become pictures of men so all these
[53:27] things came back into his mind
[53:29] Hallelujah so I believe you know that
[53:32] that was the purpose why Jesus had to
[53:34] bring them back to the Sea of Galilee
[53:36] Amen to restore them back to remove all
[53:40] their spiritual amnesia
[53:43] amen and you know when I look at the
[53:46] Greek Lexicon about the meaning of
[53:48] Galilee amen Galilee means circuit
[53:52] amen circuit
[53:55] so when you go into the circuit
[53:58] you will feel the power of it
[54:01] amen
[54:02] and so I believe amen it has spiritual
[54:05] connotation that when when he was just
[54:08] right there everything was brought into
[54:10] this remembrance
[54:12] amen and now he realized and and little
[54:16] by little but something I notice here
[54:18] brothers and sisters amen even in
[54:20] Matthew maybe allow me to read that book
[54:23] of Matthew
[54:26] I just see all these are disciples you
[54:28] know
[54:29] and Jesus commissioned in Matthew 28
[54:32] verse 16. then the 11 Disciples of
[54:35] course Judas was no longer there no
[54:38] unbeliever no make-believer
[54:41] then the 11 disciples went away into
[54:43] Galilee into a mountain where Jesus had
[54:46] appointed them
[54:47] and when they saw him
[54:50] they worshiped him
[54:53] but it didn't stop there but some
[54:56] doubted Hallelujah he rose from the dead
[55:02] prophecy being fulfilled before their
[55:04] eyes
[55:06] they worship Him and yet some still
[55:09] doubted him
[55:10] Hallelujah
[55:12] amen
[55:14] some doubted
[55:16] but I never noticed even when Jesus
[55:19] walked with those two disciples going to
[55:22] Emmaus
[55:24] amen
[55:25] he never rebuked them
[55:28] it was full of love and compassion amen
[55:31] Hallelujah
[55:33] just full of grace
[55:35] Hallelujah so you see that's why you
[55:39] know he he understood the condition of
[55:42] the disciples they were so broken they
[55:45] were so discouraged
[55:47] they were so
[55:48] doubting although the the scriptures
[55:51] have been fulfilled Before Their Eyes
[55:54] amen but Jesus
[55:57] never looked at their weaknesses
[56:01] Jesus was so persistent
[56:04] amen enriching their need
[56:07] Hallelujah no rebuke whatsoever but it
[56:11] is also full of love
[56:13] Hallelujah that's why you know
[56:16] uh brother Branham said uh uh when he
[56:20] spoke uh one time I just remembered this
[56:22] just came into my mind you know when
[56:24] when he was closing in prayer and then
[56:27] he rebuked Satan and he said you know
[56:29] Satan you you you you you took my son
[56:32] you took my daughter
[56:34] amen
[56:37] but I claimed them
[56:40] Hallelujah
[56:42] turn them loose I claim my children I
[56:45] claim my father I claim my mother I
[56:48] claim my brother I claim my sister
[56:50] Hallelujah
[56:52] turn them loose you take them you have
[56:55] taken them but Jesus said that brother
[56:57] Branham said Say Amen we have the token
[57:00] I claim them
[57:03] Hallelujah I claim them
[57:06] and we who have who have the word and we
[57:10] who have the authority we have the
[57:12] potential
[57:14] amen we can stand in the Gap and we can
[57:17] claim them while we are still here amen
[57:21] they they still have
[57:23] opportunity
[57:25] Hallelujah while we are standing on the
[57:27] word hallelujah those that we love
[57:32] amen and those also that loved us
[57:35] we can still do something if we could
[57:38] not if we cannot let them go
[57:41] amen I believe the purpose of that
[57:43] message is that to bring Grace so much
[57:46] in our hearts
[57:48] Hallelujah that we can Manifest this
[57:51] kind of opportunity this kind of love
[57:53] this kind of compassion Hallelujah now
[57:56] look at these disciples
[57:59] they were so discouraged and backslidden
[58:02] they were out in their position
[58:06] amen but Jesus was there
[58:09] being so persistent and perseverant amen
[58:13] he look at their needs rather than
[58:16] looking at their weaknesses
[58:18] Hallelujah he came down he came down he
[58:22] came back eight days after just for one
[58:24] man
[58:25] Thomas
[58:27] Hallelujah eight days before amen he
[58:30] said unless
[58:32] I touch his wounds unless I put my
[58:35] finger
[58:36] inside this wound at the side at his
[58:40] side I'm not going to believe it
[58:43] he required the Lord
[58:45] and the Lord met the requirement
[58:47] amen eight days ago he denied Mary to
[58:50] touch him but now he approached Thomas
[58:53] amen he went directly to Thomas and he
[58:57] said Thomas
[58:58] now here is my hand
[59:00] Hallelujah
[59:02] if that's one thing that will bring you
[59:04] back
[59:05] put your fingers
[59:07] amen so God you know Jesus had to change
[59:13] something but he had no dual statement
[59:17] whatsoever amen
[59:19] but he has a single purpose
[59:22] and that is to bring us back to him and
[59:25] that's why this morning we said they
[59:27] sang a new song why because he became a
[59:30] redeemer
[59:31] he opened us the word not only as the
[59:34] Creator but he became the Redeemer
[59:37] amen he became the revealer of his own
[59:39] word and it's being revealed to us
[59:42] hallelujah so he did everything
[59:45] Hallelujah just to prove that he is so
[59:48] persistent in reaching his hand to show
[59:51] that no one can pluck them out of his
[59:54] hand no one can pluck us out of his hand
[59:57] Hallelujah because he's the one reaching
[1:00:00] us
[1:00:01] he's the one doing the thing he's the
[1:00:04] one that is perseverant he's the one
[1:00:06] that is so persistent
[1:00:08] amen and so little by little you know
[1:00:10] all this is tough amen so he all these
[1:00:14] things have come back into the mind of
[1:00:16] Peter amen and so if he continues on
[1:00:19] reading the book and and he said in in
[1:00:22] John chapter 21 let's go back
[1:00:25] and the other disciples came in a little
[1:00:28] ship for they were not far from land but
[1:00:32] as it were 200 cubits dragging the net
[1:00:35] with fishes
[1:00:37] now another spot here he said they were
[1:00:40] dragging the net with fishes
[1:00:42] but in verse 9 as soon as they were come
[1:00:46] to land they saw a fire already
[1:00:49] amen the feast that they caught
[1:00:53] they were only pulling it they were just
[1:00:56] pulling it to bring to the ghost amen
[1:01:00] but as soon then as they were come to
[1:01:03] land they saw a fire of course there and
[1:01:06] freeze laid there on and bread
[1:01:09] amen
[1:01:11] so the man they passed by was the Lord
[1:01:13] himself
[1:01:15] and he was cooking the fish
[1:01:17] they were coals and the peace was there
[1:01:19] out of the spoken word amen not what
[1:01:23] they caught Hallelujah many people they
[1:01:25] tried to cut something in the message
[1:01:27] amen but why it's not what what what we
[1:01:30] catch amen but it is what the Lord Cuts
[1:01:33] in what the Lord cooked amen and that is
[1:01:36] something that we have to have partaking
[1:01:38] in communion with Hallelujah and so then
[1:01:41] they Cuts amen they caught fishes but
[1:01:44] the fish that they were they were about
[1:01:46] to partake on were already there as soon
[1:01:50] as then as they were come to land they
[1:01:51] saw a fire of course there and fish laid
[1:01:53] their own and bread there is a bonus of
[1:01:55] bread Jesus said unto them bring up the
[1:01:58] fish
[1:01:59] which ye have now caught
[1:02:02] Simon Peter went up and Drew the net to
[1:02:04] land full of great wishes and 150 and
[1:02:07] three and for all there were so many yet
[1:02:10] was not the net broken Jesus said unto
[1:02:13] them come and dine
[1:02:15] Hallelujah there was no sermon just come
[1:02:18] and die
[1:02:20] that's a fellowship
[1:02:22] Hallelujah because Jesus realized you
[1:02:25] know it is almost the end of the road
[1:02:27] for them they were so discouraged amen
[1:02:31] but let's come and dine and none of the
[1:02:34] disciples ask him who art thou knowing
[1:02:37] that it was the Lord Jesus then cometh
[1:02:40] and take it bread and giveth them
[1:02:42] and face like Christ Hallelujah so I
[1:02:46] believe we are in almost at the end of
[1:02:49] the road
[1:02:51] Hallelujah
[1:02:54] and it's not surprising
[1:02:58] that sometimes when there is a waiting
[1:03:00] time
[1:03:02] people get discouraged
[1:03:05] people lose hope
[1:03:08] some of them our loved ones some of them
[1:03:11] we saw how serious they were in serving
[1:03:14] the lord
[1:03:15] but right before the end of the road
[1:03:18] Hallelujah we will see some people
[1:03:21] throwing away from the truth
[1:03:23] some of them we love some of them are
[1:03:25] friends some of them we won
[1:03:28] at the feet of Jesus some of them are
[1:03:31] the ones
[1:03:32] who win who won US
[1:03:35] but they're no longer here
[1:03:38] but if we have such enough love in our
[1:03:42] hearts
[1:03:43] Hallelujah
[1:03:46] and that love that that kind of
[1:03:48] compassion
[1:03:50] and we we we draw
[1:03:53] we feed
[1:03:55] from that lamp
[1:03:57] we feed on the same land
[1:04:00] and that lamb is a priest
[1:04:03] that lamb is always standing in the gap
[1:04:06] Hallelujah weather our husband our wife
[1:04:12] it's not just a believer of this message
[1:04:14] but if we stay in the message and we are
[1:04:18] feeding on the lamp
[1:04:20] Hallelujah we can still stand in the Gap
[1:04:22] and reach out and live the way we should
[1:04:25] be
[1:04:26] sometimes it's not always quoting them
[1:04:28] the scriptures quoting them the
[1:04:30] statement of the Prophet because
[1:04:32] sometimes they they have gone so far
[1:04:34] away that they could not recognize the
[1:04:37] word anymore right amen
[1:04:40] but when we come to the spot where we
[1:04:43] live the life of Christ
[1:04:45] where we live the lamb amen the
[1:04:49] inspiration the life that is in it that
[1:04:51] is that that that lamb that we we fed so
[1:04:55] much on Hallelujah has brought us in the
[1:04:58] spot brother Branham said that we can
[1:05:00] love everybody
[1:05:02] we can pray for everybody
[1:05:05] we can be alarmed to them because why we
[1:05:08] become what we eat right and if we bid
[1:05:11] on the land
[1:05:12] Hallelujah it will produce the same lamb
[1:05:15] it will produce the same kind of life
[1:05:18] that is in the lamb Hallelujah and
[1:05:20] that's why we can say Satan turn them
[1:05:23] loose
[1:05:24] I claim my son I claim my daughter I
[1:05:28] claim my wife I claim my husband
[1:05:31] Hallelujah
[1:05:33] why because God will recognize your word
[1:05:36] God will recognize your appeal upon him
[1:05:41] because we are in such a position we are
[1:05:43] in the right position
[1:05:45] Hallelujah and so we can reach out
[1:05:48] amen
[1:05:49] and that's what I said it's not always
[1:05:52] quoting that's always sermon or
[1:05:55] preaching of some sort we need that
[1:05:57] but there are certain situations
[1:06:01] that life
[1:06:03] I would rather
[1:06:05] live the sermon then preach it
[1:06:09] Hallelujah
[1:06:11] you remember Stephen and Paul
[1:06:14] you know Stephen and Paul Stephen
[1:06:18] could not argue with Paul
[1:06:22] in terms of scriptures
[1:06:25] because Paul said among the Pharisees
[1:06:29] I am a Pharisee
[1:06:31] and a simple Deacon like Stephen
[1:06:35] could not beat him into pieces in terms
[1:06:38] of scriptures
[1:06:42] but Stephen had a testimony
[1:06:48] said if we have the spirit of Beethoven
[1:06:54] we can write songs
[1:06:57] if we have the spirit of Shakespeare we
[1:07:00] can write poems
[1:07:03] and what if we have the spirit of Christ
[1:07:05] in US
[1:07:07] and that same spirit
[1:07:09] that says when he was right there at the
[1:07:11] cross father forgive them
[1:07:13] for they know not what they do right
[1:07:16] Hallelujah
[1:07:17] The Same Spirit
[1:07:19] came into Stephen and when he was placed
[1:07:23] in the same spot in the same condition
[1:07:27] Stephen said Lord
[1:07:30] judge this now
[1:07:32] against them
[1:07:34] he never said a word against them right
[1:07:37] he took all the stones that were
[1:07:41] thrown
[1:07:43] upon him
[1:07:45] Hallelujah and he had enough Grace in
[1:07:48] his heart to say Lord church this not
[1:07:50] against them and when he looked up he
[1:07:53] stole the heavens open and he saw the
[1:07:55] Lord at the right hand
[1:07:57] of the father
[1:08:00] and Paul was there he was Soul right
[1:08:02] then
[1:08:06] consented those people he did not throw
[1:08:09] a single Stone I believe but he was
[1:08:11] right there
[1:08:12] he didn't say a word
[1:08:14] to stop them
[1:08:16] in fact he he he he he looked at those
[1:08:20] garments in front of him
[1:08:24] but he was watching the life I'm Stephen
[1:08:28] Stephen did not preach to Paul
[1:08:32] but Paul was there watching the life
[1:08:36] the life
[1:08:38] of a priesthood
[1:08:40] the life of the Lamb
[1:08:43] the same
[1:08:46] similar statement Jesus said at the
[1:08:49] cross forgive them for they know not
[1:08:52] what they do
[1:08:53] similar statement Stephen said
[1:08:57] church this not against them right right
[1:08:59] and he closed his eyes and he died
[1:09:02] and so wherever Paul go
[1:09:05] he always testify
[1:09:07] on that life that he saw
[1:09:09] even in front of a king and he said one
[1:09:12] day
[1:09:14] there was a man
[1:09:16] he he kept on testifying about Stephen
[1:09:19] that's why when when he met that Pillar
[1:09:22] of Fire and he said who art thou Lord
[1:09:25] and there was a voice and he said I am
[1:09:28] Jesus
[1:09:29] whom thou persecute us
[1:09:33] people and Jesus did not see each other
[1:09:38] Jesus did not Paul did not directly
[1:09:41] persecute Jesus
[1:09:44] but Jesus said
[1:09:47] I am Jesus whom thou persecutes right
[1:09:50] there and then Paul realized amen that
[1:09:54] the light where he was a witness to be
[1:09:58] persecuted the first martyr in the Bible
[1:10:01] he knew he persecuted the Lord because
[1:10:04] the same spirit that was upon Stephen
[1:10:08] Hallelujah and that made way for the
[1:10:11] conversion of Paul
[1:10:13] Hallelujah so it's the same thing
[1:10:15] brothers and sisters this message
[1:10:19] has so much grace in us that's why when
[1:10:22] The Headstone came down it spoke Grace
[1:10:28] double Grace
[1:10:30] judgment will come
[1:10:32] it's a promise
[1:10:34] Revelation chapter 3 it says to him that
[1:10:37] overcome will I give to sit with me in
[1:10:40] my throne
[1:10:41] rulership
[1:10:45] judgment
[1:10:47] it will just be an icing on the cake
[1:10:50] because Revelation 10 11 if I'm not
[1:10:53] mistaken it says
[1:10:55] or 10 it says
[1:10:58] we were made Kings and Priests
[1:11:02] and we shall reign right
[1:11:04] right Hallelujah but right now while we
[1:11:07] are still here we can still pray
[1:11:10] we can still Witness
[1:11:12] we can still live the life
[1:11:15] and many people can watch it
[1:11:17] and many people will be reading the
[1:11:20] scriptures because we are the written
[1:11:22] Epistles credible men
[1:11:25] Hallelujah glory to God do you love him
[1:11:28] amen I love him because he first loved
[1:11:32] me oh God hallelujah so brother Branham
[1:11:35] said the reason you know there are
[1:11:37] certain things because he has
[1:11:39] predestinated us and there's nothing he
[1:11:42] can do but to reach us back
[1:11:45] Amen to reach us amen and uh uh uh he
[1:11:49] said we can make it because we are
[1:11:52] predestinated to it and uh uh the reason
[1:11:56] we are uh we we're going to hear is
[1:11:59] voice is that you know in in paragraph
[1:12:02] 230.
[1:12:05] of the invisible Union of the bride of
[1:12:08] Christ
[1:12:09] let me read this and I'm closing with
[1:12:11] this
[1:12:12] in in paragraph 230 said you never did
[1:12:16] it
[1:12:17] right because that little germ that was
[1:12:19] in you was to be you
[1:12:22] before the foundation of the world God
[1:12:24] put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:12:28] it's not the religion it's not the
[1:12:31] church
[1:12:31] it's not us but it's him amen amen God
[1:12:36] put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:12:38] Hallelujah and let me continue on Amen
[1:12:41] and we're not tired of hearing reading
[1:12:43] this little Eagle story that brother
[1:12:45] Branham shared is that like my little
[1:12:48] Eagle story all of you has heard it a
[1:12:51] handhold farmer set a hand one time so
[1:12:53] he didn't have enough hands out eggs to
[1:12:56] go under the hand so then he found an
[1:12:58] eagle egg and they put it under him when
[1:13:00] the eagle was born it was the funniest
[1:13:03] looking chicken them chickens ever seen
[1:13:06] little old Eagle going along and the
[1:13:08] hand would go clock clock little Eagle
[1:13:11] said I don't know what the thing sounds
[1:13:12] like but I'm following her anyhow and
[1:13:15] they went out in the barnyard and began
[1:13:17] to scratch in manure piles and she clap
[1:13:19] clap clap this is good this is good you
[1:13:22] join ours and this is what that little
[1:13:24] old Eagle he couldn't eat that stop see
[1:13:27] he just went along with the chicken
[1:13:29] because he didn't know he didn't know
[1:13:31] what to do and then she went out there
[1:13:33] and she would get this or that the
[1:13:35] little Eagle he just had to stomach it
[1:13:38] he didn't know how to do it but he had
[1:13:40] seen all the chickens doing it but
[1:13:42] there's something different he didn't
[1:13:44] like that right so one day the mother
[1:13:47] knew that she had laid two eggs so she
[1:13:49] began to hunt for that other one flying
[1:13:52] around searching like the great Holy
[1:13:54] Spirit one day he flew over the Barnyard
[1:13:56] that denomination she looked down there
[1:13:58] and she seen her baby she screamed it
[1:14:02] was the voice of something that echoed
[1:14:04] from the inside of him that sounds right
[1:14:06] oh let a real predestinated born germ
[1:14:10] predestinated by God hear the word of
[1:14:12] God it's music to him he knows it's the
[1:14:16] truth he started that denominational
[1:14:18] stuff anyhow join us come go with us we
[1:14:21] got social party we got this we got it
[1:14:24] just didn't sound right to the little
[1:14:25] fellow she said Son you don't belong in
[1:14:28] that group anyhow you belong to me your
[1:14:30] mind he said Mama that sounds real how
[1:14:33] am I going to get out just make a jump
[1:14:35] I'll catch you that's all you have to do
[1:14:38] now
[1:14:39] the anointed word of God being
[1:14:43] Vindicated before any man that's born to
[1:14:46] be a Son of God With The predestinated
[1:14:49] Germ into him for this hour he'll see
[1:14:52] God's message as sure as there is God in
[1:14:56] heaven right right Martin Luther saw it
[1:14:58] for his Wesley saw it for his the
[1:15:01] Pentecostal sow it for his now what
[1:15:04] about you amen amen see they went into a
[1:15:07] denomination here is the word condemning
[1:15:09] it telling you what word to have today
[1:15:12] and just exactly Malachi for and all
[1:15:14] these other promises for the hour what
[1:15:16] do you see what are you looking at amen
[1:15:19] here we are the real genuine Eagles here
[1:15:22] my sheep know my voice
[1:15:24] The Stranger they will not follow why it
[1:15:28] was put in there by predestination you
[1:15:31] were for ordained to a Son of God you
[1:15:34] were in God before the foundation of the
[1:15:36] world your only manifested in this day
[1:15:41] for his honor and Glory
[1:15:43] how can you do it without honoring his
[1:15:46] word and stand with every word of God
[1:15:49] yes sir which you are a part of that
[1:15:52] word by predestination because look the
[1:15:56] God is the word you believe it and
[1:16:00] congregation says amen
[1:16:03] hallelujah amen so that's the very
[1:16:06] reason we accept it because
[1:16:09] we are predestinated to it
[1:16:11] right amen
[1:16:13] last verse I promise this is the last
[1:16:16] verse
[1:16:17] Jeremiah 29 11
[1:16:20] and let us close in this scripture
[1:16:26] he says for I know the thoughts that I
[1:16:29] think toward you
[1:16:31] saith the Lord
[1:16:33] thought so peace
[1:16:35] and not of evil
[1:16:37] to give you an expected end
[1:16:41] hallelujah what a God we serve What a
[1:16:43] Mighty God do we say when he thinks of
[1:16:46] us when he thinks of me he's not
[1:16:48] thinking anybody
[1:16:50] God has no bad memories
[1:16:54] upon each and every one of us
[1:16:56] he said the thoughts amen that I think
[1:17:00] towards you said the Lord thoughts on
[1:17:02] peace
[1:17:03] not of evil
[1:17:05] to give you an expected end
[1:17:08] hallelujah how can we question God
[1:17:12] no way
[1:17:14] so much grace
[1:17:16] and because of that so much grace we
[1:17:19] don't tend to abuse it
[1:17:21] the fact is we love him more
[1:17:24] because we have experienced so much
[1:17:26] grace that he was able to bring us back
[1:17:28] and I believe if we have a revelation
[1:17:31] how God became so persistent to us
[1:17:34] perseverant to bring us back we can have
[1:17:37] so much grace
[1:17:39] Hallelujah to pray
[1:17:41] and to reach out and stand for this
[1:17:44] message that other people may not have
[1:17:47] heard it probably
[1:17:48] we can still reach out for them and
[1:17:51] there are other people who have you know
[1:17:53] who have been here
[1:17:55] they have been part of us and yet we can
[1:17:58] still be alarmed to them and pray for
[1:18:00] them and one day soon

[1:18:06] because God promised it I believe it
