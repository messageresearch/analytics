[29:40] and we uh you know just we just
[29:42] appreciate it you know how they served
[29:44] and and just uh just what a blessing
[29:47] they were because we took a lot of young
[29:48] people to those meetings and many lives
[29:50] were really really transformed by you

[30:17] invited to they say how can I get there
[30:19] yeah
[30:21] because you know that the seed has
[30:24] already been sown and this is a church
[30:26] that uh you all sowed seeds for years
[30:28] you know so it's like how can I get
[30:30] there and do what I can for the cause of
[30:33] Christ so we're happy to be here amen my
[30:36] wife sister Erica is with me and uh also

[30:56] Tabernacle amen there in West Palm Beach
[30:59] Florida all right I won't um take too
[31:01] much of your time have you standing
[31:02] let's turn our Bibles really quickly to
[31:05] uh two passages of scripture uh one is
[31:08] Matthew 19.
[31:10] and uh being that we are directing
[31:13] service to the youth I will do all I can
[31:17] to make sure that we put cookies on the
[31:20] lower shelf so that the children can get
[31:22] to them
[31:24] amen praise the Lord
[31:27] amen and I and I will not try to choke
[31:30] the church in any way because I tell you
[31:33] what I've seen people do that and then
[31:34] they end up on the deep end somewhere so
[31:36] we just want to bring the gospel Lord
[31:39] Jesus uh Matthew Matthew 19 and uh verse
[31:43] 16
[31:46] um it says this
[31:48] and behold one came and said unto him
[31:52] good master
[31:53] uh what good thing shall I do that I may
[31:57] have eternal life
[31:59] and he said unto him why call us thou me
[32:02] good there is none good but one that is
[32:06] God but if thou will enter into life
[32:08] keep the Commandments saith unto him
[32:13] which Jesus said
[32:16] um uh Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt
[32:19] uh not commit adultery Thou shalt not
[32:22] steal Thou shalt not bear false witness
[32:24] honor thy father and thy mother and thou
[32:27] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the
[32:30] young man saith unto him all these
[32:33] things have I kept from my youth up what
[32:36] lack I yet
[32:38] uh Jesus said unto him if thou Wilt be
[32:43] perfect go and sell that thou Hast and
[32:46] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[32:49] treasure in heaven and come and follow
[32:51] me but when the young man heard that
[32:54] saying he went away sorrowful for he had
[32:57] great possessions then said Jesus unto
[33:00] unto his disciples verily I say unto you
[33:02] that a rich man shall hardly enter into
[33:05] the Kingdom of Heaven again I say unto
[33:07] you it is easier for a camel to go
[33:11] through the eye of a needle than for a
[33:12] rich man to enter into the kingdom of
[33:15] God and real quickly over in Deuteronomy
[33:17] chapter 30 we'll catch a a verse there
[33:20] as well
[33:22] amen
[33:24] Deuteronomy 30. I won't I gave the
[33:26] brothers a number of verses there but I
[33:28] only want to read one verse 19.
[33:32] in Deuteronomy 30.
[33:34] it says uh I call Heaven and Earth to
[33:38] record this day against you
[33:41] that I have set before your life and
[33:44] death blessing and cursing therefore
[33:47] choose life that both thou and thy seed
[33:51] may live amen the lord of the blessing
[33:54] to the reading of his word let's just
[33:56] Bound in a brief word of prayer amen
[33:58] father we thank you for the privilege
[34:00] and the opportunity we have to read the
[34:02] word of God but we know it takes the
[34:04] Holy Spirit to come and Quicken Lord
[34:07] what we've read that it would apply to
[34:09] us even right now so we ask that you
[34:11] administer to every heart those that are
[34:13] present those that are online we know
[34:15] that you have complete control over each
[34:17] and every person God so we ask that you
[34:19] would get all the glory all the honor
[34:21] and all the praise in Jesus name we pray
[34:23] amen amen God bless you you can be
[34:26] seated amen again so since we are
[34:29] talking primarily to the youth we have
[34:31] prepared in that fashion and we want to
[34:35] just use for a title uh today make the
[34:39] right choice make the right choice
[34:43] we
[34:45] want to just kind of start here by
[34:48] reading a few things from the prophet
[34:50] those that the brothers that have this
[34:52] in the back I'm actually starting at the
[34:54] second paragraph uh here and in this
[34:57] message thirsting for Life brother
[34:59] random uh makes a statement it says and
[35:02] if we have been brought to this place by
[35:05] the grace of God and we're free moral
[35:08] agents to make a choice and if the holy
[35:12] spirit that brought us from the uh from
[35:15] the earth and starts to brooding to our
[35:17] hearts and we accept him and brute back
[35:20] to him how much more is he able to raise
[35:23] us up in the last days when we got a
[35:26] chance to make a choice all right he
[35:29] says so it could only be through the
[35:31] brooding of the Holy Spirit that's how
[35:33] life comes is by the Holy Spirit
[35:36] therefore you can only have life by the
[35:40] Holy Spirit uh that's why Jesus said
[35:43] accept the man be born again he can in
[35:45] no wise see the kingdom of God and it
[35:49] goes on he says this uh and the psalmist
[35:52] saying thy love and kindness is better
[35:56] than life then I began to think what
[35:58] kind of life was he speaking of that the
[36:01] loving kindness of Father the love
[36:03] kindness of father was better than life
[36:06] then it come to my mind there is a way
[36:09] that seemeth like its life and and I
[36:12] love that statement here you know
[36:13] because um I'll go forward in this quote
[36:15] in a little bit but when we think about
[36:17] life as especially when it comes to
[36:19] young people uh the enemy or Satan loves
[36:22] to try to get to think that we're
[36:23] missing out on life when we're serving
[36:26] God right he tries to get us to think
[36:28] that you know there's so much more
[36:30] outside of serving God there you know
[36:32] and unfortunately there is a lot more
[36:35] out there but it's it's only produced in
[36:37] death amen I mean I was I was reading
[36:40] something a little earlier today just a
[36:41] little devotion and and brother Graham
[36:43] saying you're gonna hey it's a young man
[36:44] would get his check and he he wants to
[36:47] take this young girl out but when he
[36:48] goes out to take the take her to eat he
[36:51] has to pay if they want to go to a club
[36:52] he has to pay if they want to go here he
[36:54] has to pay it's going to cost you
[36:56] something to go out there and try to
[36:58] enjoy life but when you come to Christ
[37:00] you come without a price right it's
[37:03] without money and without it's without
[37:05] price and it's something that gives you
[37:07] eternal life
[37:09] hallelujah amen uh you you can never go
[37:12] wrong by serving God never ever go wrong
[37:15] and I love the way even what we read in
[37:17] scripture the things that you choose
[37:19] today will actually affect you and your
[37:21] seed right it's not just you but even as
[37:24] young people as you decide right now
[37:26] you're not even married some are not
[37:28] even married but if you decide right now
[37:29] I'm going to serve God that will affect
[37:31] your family in the future
[37:33] hallelujah amen it pays to serve God
[37:37] here he goes on in this quote and he
[37:39] says uh then I begin to think what kind
[37:42] of life was he speaking of that the love
[37:45] kindness of father was better than life
[37:48] then it came to my mind that there is a
[37:51] way that seemeth like its life it's a
[37:55] perverted life all right he says now the
[37:57] devil cannot create nothing God is the
[38:00] only Creator there is and what is
[38:02] unrighteousness it's righteousness
[38:04] perverted then we notice that there's a
[38:07] perversion of righteousness makes
[38:09] unrighteousness it's not original it's
[38:12] not right the original it is right it
[38:15] says therefore God had no beginning and
[38:17] he has no ending and if we become part
[38:19] of God we can no more die then God can
[38:23] die because we got his life in Us by the
[38:27] new birth and we're just as Eternal as
[38:29] God is eternal we cannot perish Jesus
[38:32] said he that heareth my words believe on
[38:34] him that sent me and hath eternal life
[38:37] shall never come into the Judgment but
[38:39] his past from Death to life now before I
[38:42] go forth further a man in in my quotes
[38:44] uh we're talking about making the right
[38:47] choice
[38:48] brother Branham you know make some some
[38:50] statements here you can just take that
[38:52] down for me because these are my my
[38:54] personal notes and I'll just give them
[38:55] only the quotes but where you see the
[38:57] little um uh bullets those are my
[39:00] personal notes but uh if um when we talk
[39:03] about Choice brother random made some
[39:04] comments about Choice he said choice is
[39:06] actually a great thing yeah yeah right
[39:08] so so yeah and no matter what age we are
[39:12] we all have to make choices right no
[39:15] matter what age we are we all we all are
[39:16] making choices you know and and I can I
[39:19] can I can tell you right now uh some of
[39:22] those choices uh that you make you know
[39:25] you get a chance to choose your friends
[39:27] young people you get a chance to choose
[39:29] your friends you you get a chance to
[39:31] choose who you're going to hang with you
[39:33] get a chance to you know and at a
[39:35] certain point in life maybe not right
[39:37] now but you get a chance to choose your
[39:39] church
[39:39] right you get a chance to choose what
[39:41] Pastor you're gonna sit under right what
[39:44] Pastor you raise your your kids under
[39:45] you get a chance to do that right you
[39:47] get a chance to choose your spouse when
[39:49] you're thinking about getting married it
[39:51] is your choice no one makes you marry
[39:53] that person it is your choice and when
[39:55] you make the choice you have to live
[39:58] with the choice right uh you get a
[40:01] chance to um uh for some of those that's
[40:03] probably not at the age of thing about
[40:05] marriage you get a chance to choose
[40:07] whether to lie or not lie
[40:10] amen everybody makes a choice when
[40:12] something happens in the house and you
[40:14] know and and I don't know about your
[40:16] parents but I've always had this this
[40:18] extra person living in my house and I I
[40:20] don't know uh how he how they got there
[40:23] whether it's a he I don't know he she I
[40:25] don't know what it is but I'd ask my
[40:27] kids who did this I don't know
[40:31] became a person that lived in my house
[40:33] and I could never find this person who
[40:36] is I don't know he he has to live here
[40:39] somewhere right I could never talk to I
[40:42] don't know right so so so so a child has
[40:45] the has the uh the opportunity to choose
[40:48] the line or not lie and there are
[40:51] results from lying and not lying
[40:55] you can you can choose to say yes or no
[40:59] to trouble
[41:00] you can choose to get involved and not
[41:02] get involved you you you get a chance to
[41:04] choose right you can choose to serve God
[41:07] or you can choose not to serve him right
[41:10] you can choose to follow God's word or
[41:13] you can choose not to right we all have
[41:16] a choice
[41:17] some of the things that you cannot
[41:19] choose that you can't choose the family
[41:21] you were born in
[41:22] you can't change that you can't choose
[41:25] the family that God God orchestrated God
[41:28] for ordained the family that you'll be
[41:30] born in you can't choose your your
[41:32] height
[41:33] you can't you can't you can't choose
[41:35] that God choose that your God you can't
[41:37] choose your eye well I shouldn't say
[41:39] that because nowadays people go and
[41:40] change their eye colors but but but your
[41:42] natural high color you can't you God is
[41:45] the one to ordained that
[41:46] Hallelujah right amen there there's a
[41:49] lot of things you can't you can't choose
[41:51] your genetic makeup God is the one that
[41:56] that we can put it that way God did that
[41:58] himself and the reason he did that is
[42:00] because you're fearful and wonderfully
[42:01] made
[42:02] he had a special design just for you and
[42:06] there's no one can take your place
[42:08] blessed be the name of the Lord but so
[42:10] there are things that we can choose and
[42:12] things that we can't choose choice is a
[42:14] great thing the prophet says he says
[42:16] there's an unwritten law Among Us of
[42:19] choosing and it says you have the right
[42:22] to choose you have the right to choose
[42:25] and you also have the right you also
[42:29] have uh you have the you have to live
[42:31] with the results of whatever choice or
[42:33] whatever decision you make
[42:36] here uh in the message leadership
[42:39] brother random says this he says the
[42:42] first is a mother's kindness
[42:44] then the father's word and after the
[42:47] mother gives you your first step then
[42:50] you look to your daddy all of us for
[42:52] wisdom because he is the head of the
[42:54] house and usually not not that he's any
[42:57] smarter but it's just made a leader of
[43:00] his family so we follow what our daddy
[43:03] says do when he says now son I would
[43:06] like for you to do a certain certain
[43:08] thing then we listen to him uh because
[43:11] it's wisdom but listen see he has
[43:13] learned a whole lot and we've got to ask
[43:16] him to see what he learned and then we
[43:19] can prop it by by
[43:21] um by what he has learned he tells us
[43:23] now don't go and do this because I did
[43:26] that my father told me not to do it but
[43:28] I did it and caused this to happen to me
[43:31] something bad so see then he daddy tells
[43:34] us how to do and what to do right
[43:37] goes on it says then after Mother leads
[43:40] us
[43:41] till the time we have to get a little
[43:43] wisdom to understand from Daddy and then
[43:46] we get another we get another leader and
[43:48] that's the teacher a good school teacher
[43:50] she tries to teach you and give you an
[43:53] education to to to fit you better in
[43:56] life place a position you can read uh
[43:59] your Bible and you can read the songs
[44:01] and you can learn of God and read
[44:03] yourself if you see and uh you know
[44:05] brother Branham you know had one of
[44:06] these teachers uh like that was kind of
[44:08] teaching him and he gave the he always
[44:10] talked about he had a really bad temper
[44:12] problem and this teacher what she would
[44:15] tell them to say now before you go out
[44:17] there and get in the fight I want you to
[44:19] take a string and I want you to tie so
[44:20] many knots in that string and uh and
[44:23] then by the time you get all those knots
[44:24] tied hopefully your temper calm down you
[44:26] won't even have to you won't need to
[44:27] fight well brother Brandon we're going
[44:29] to start tying that string and say he
[44:31] before he can get maybe one knot in it's
[44:34] just so out of control that he took off
[44:36] he's fighting anyway he just could not
[44:38] get that temper under control hallelujah
[44:41] amen but we realized what got the temper
[44:43] and the controllers when he come in
[44:45] contact with the Holy Ghost that's where
[44:47] God is Temple under control Hallelujah
[44:49] if we find I find ourselves in the place
[44:51] we have a temper problem we need to come
[44:53] in contact with the Holy Ghost he'll
[44:55] take care of that temporary issue
[44:57] Hallelujah glory to God so the prophet
[45:00] goes on to say this he says um you can
[45:03] you can read your Bible and you can read
[45:05] the songs and you can learn of God and
[45:07] read yourself you see and then another
[45:09] thing maybe you'd have business and
[45:11] somebody write your letter mama daddy
[45:14] somebody write your letter you couldn't
[45:16] read it see so the teacher she she had
[45:19] you then and she leads you to learn to
[45:21] write and to read and it's a good thing
[45:24] a good teacher to teach it right but now
[45:27] after you leave that you after you leave
[45:30] the teacher one teacher after the other
[45:32] one from a little primer a little first
[45:34] grade until you get out of high school
[45:36] or go to college then when you leave
[45:38] college and then the teacher is through
[45:40] leading you see he says now mama has
[45:43] taught you to walk see Papa has taught
[45:47] you how to be brilliant and a nice young
[45:49] man and how to take care of yourself and
[45:51] behave yourself the teacher has taught
[45:53] you an education how to read and write
[45:56] but now you're leaving you are leaving
[45:58] mama and you are leaving the teacher now
[46:01] somebody has to take you from here on
[46:04] now who do you want to take you from
[46:06] here on
[46:07] who do you want to take you from here on
[46:10] right we might have some young people
[46:13] that might be facing uh graduation at
[46:15] high school who do you want to take you
[46:17] from here on maybe even graduate from
[46:19] college who do you want to take you from
[46:21] here on right and and and here you know
[46:25] brother Brandon while he's sitting there
[46:26] and and giving his sermon of leadership
[46:29] there in Arizona one of the little kids
[46:31] just yes it says Jesus and brother
[46:34] Brandon said that's right that's right
[46:36] Jesus to take you from their own he said
[46:40] now that's a very good answer very fine
[46:43] jesus takes you from their own and
[46:46] that's exactly what we want you know you
[46:48] have to make the choice whether you're
[46:49] going to allow Jesus to take you from
[46:53] here on or you're going to allow
[46:54] yourself to lead you you have to make a
[46:56] choice amen you have to make a choice
[46:59] amen all right let's see here
[47:02] um
[47:03] let me uh just read this other one here
[47:06] as we just kind of go into something
[47:07] because you know we want to we want to
[47:09] just kind of show different ones in the
[47:10] Bible that make choices and how their
[47:12] choices worked out and other ones that
[47:15] didn't work out because they made the
[47:16] wrong choice we want to encourage you
[47:18] make make the right choice here in this
[47:21] sermon uh the conflict between God and
[47:23] Satan brother random says this Satan and
[47:26] Eden when he first come to those attack
[47:29] to attack a person knowing the children
[47:31] of God was fortified with his word Satan
[47:34] attacked the word
[47:36] amen I want you to think about that he
[47:39] didn't he you know he he attacked what
[47:41] they believed
[47:43] the word what they were standing on he
[47:46] attacked what they were believing amen
[47:48] and really that's that's how Satan he he
[47:50] does the same thing even right now some
[47:52] of the young people that struggled Satan
[47:54] begins to just get you to question your
[47:56] faith he attacks what you believe he's
[48:00] not attacking you directly he attacks
[48:02] what you believe and before you ignore
[48:04] it you allow those thoughts just to
[48:05] fester and and you you find you question
[48:09] this and you question that and you
[48:10] question all these things and next thing
[48:12] you know you're so far out you know
[48:14] don't know how you got there
[48:15] he he attacked the word look at this the
[48:18] prophet says knowing the children of God
[48:20] was fortified with his word Satan
[48:23] attacked the word he never attacked the
[48:25] being he attacked the word first look at
[48:28] that sneaker lizard what he does today
[48:30] the first thing he can't lay it on uh
[48:33] the first first uh first thing he can't
[48:35] lay it on say well that's not a good
[48:37] person that's a good person see but the
[48:40] only thing he tries to do no matter how
[48:42] good the person is is to get them to
[48:46] deny that word that's just the only
[48:49] thing he wants to do get you to deny
[48:52] that word so Satan tried to attack the
[48:54] word in the Garden of Eden so he had TR
[48:57] he had to say he uh so he had to say he
[49:00] had to have something now that he could
[49:02] use to the human being would look better
[49:04] than the word
[49:06] see had to have something that would
[49:08] look better to the human being than the
[49:10] word and and do you know what he used
[49:14] something that looked better than the
[49:15] word to the human being what Satan used
[49:18] was reasoning to have a reasoning just
[49:21] what he said common sense
[49:24] so that's what he used and he succeeded
[49:27] so that's what is used all alone
[49:31] brother Branham goes on says but God
[49:33] can't give us nothing else but his word
[49:35] because that's what he chose first and
[49:38] when God makes a decision even God made
[49:41] a choice
[49:42] God made a choice
[49:44] when God had to choose something to give
[49:47] his people to defeat Satan with and let
[49:50] me tell you something God God when God
[49:52] made a choice this was not something
[49:54] that would only defeat Satan 4 000 years
[49:57] ago or or 5 000 years ago when God makes
[50:01] a choice it's an eternal decision and
[50:04] God made a decision that he gives people
[50:05] something that would defeat Satan no
[50:07] matter what day and time that they were
[50:10] living in the Earth Hallelujah no matter
[50:12] what generation they were living in they
[50:14] would still be able to defeat Satan with
[50:16] the same weapon that everybody before
[50:19] them defeated him with
[50:21] Hallelujah and that weapon is the word
[50:23] of God we use the word of God to defeat
[50:26] the enemy with
[50:27] amen look at what he says here it says
[50:29] Satan said when God make God makes a
[50:31] decision God has to ever remain that way
[50:35] Satan took reasonings and took reasoning
[50:38] and attacked the word and shook Eve off
[50:40] the path that's right by reason it's
[50:42] human reasoning now the only way that um
[50:46] that she could have got uh the only way
[50:49] he should uh he she could have got to uh
[50:52] disbelieve God's word it had to be
[50:54] appealing and Satan knows how to make
[50:57] reasoning appealing it has to appeal to
[51:00] you and sin is very appealing
[51:02] he says and there's only one sin and
[51:04] that's unbelief so if it's really
[51:06] appealing Satan makes sin so appealing
[51:08] to you amen Satan used reasoning to
[51:12] attack the word but God gave you the
[51:15] word in order to overcome the enemy
[51:22] as we can see at the very beginning
[51:24] with Adam and Eve
[51:27] they had to make a choice amen
[51:29] amen and uh no matter who we are
[51:32] what what what what what what what what
[51:33] uh generation we live in we all come to
[51:37] a place of choice
[51:40] right Adam and Eve had to choose whether
[51:42] to eat of the Tree of Life
[51:44] or the tree of knowledge good and evil
[51:46] and we know according to scripture they
[51:49] they made the wrong choice amen they ate
[51:53] from the Tree of knowledge good and evil
[51:55] and it's created all the problems that
[51:56] we have in the world today we we
[51:58] understand that the attributes of God
[52:00] have still been expressed through it God
[52:02] has a way of making a man things work
[52:05] out to his perfect will no matter what
[52:07] it is but but nonetheless what what life
[52:09] have been like had they not made that
[52:12] choice
[52:13] Adam and Eve had to make a choice we can
[52:16] look back Amen in the days of Abraham
[52:19] Abraham had to choose to leave the land
[52:23] of herb and dwell in the plains of
[52:25] memory amen he had that he had to make
[52:28] that choice and once he made the choice
[52:31] he's God showed him how much he would be
[52:33] blessed by making that choice hallelujah
[52:36] amen and even when Abraham made the
[52:38] choice he also made another choice to
[52:41] bring lot along with him Hallelujah and
[52:44] when we look in the scripture they had
[52:46] to come to a spot where they had to make
[52:48] a choice of separating from one another
[52:50] and when they when when Abraham gave lot
[52:53] the opportunity to choose lot chose the
[52:56] best of the Lamb
[52:58] Abraham stayed in the place but lot did
[53:00] happen did not realize where he made the
[53:02] choice to live in Sodom and Gomorrah he
[53:04] did not realize one day that City would
[53:07] be destroyed by almighty God he made the
[53:10] wrong choice while he was down there
[53:12] inside him God came to him and visited
[53:14] with the two angels and gave him another
[53:16] opportunity make a choice to leave Sodom
[53:21] throughout life we'll go from situation
[53:23] to situation where we have to make
[53:25] choices my encouragement to you amen
[53:29] this afternoon make the right choice
[53:33] there's results from our choosing
[53:35] whether it's good or bad there's always
[53:37] results from our choosing make the right
[53:40] choice
[53:44] even in the days of Joshua Joshua
[53:47] brought the the people a man of Israel
[53:49] over into the promised land and and as
[53:51] they were conquering you know in the
[53:54] land and and claiming the land Joshua
[53:56] got them to the end and he began to
[53:58] remind them of all the things that God
[53:59] did and he set amen the word of God in
[54:02] front of the people says choose ye this
[54:04] day
[54:06] Susie this day whom you will serve right
[54:10] they had to make a choice the children
[54:13] of Israel had to make a choice even
[54:15] today we have to make a choice
[54:20] Elijah challenged the children of Israel
[54:22] to not remain haunted between two two
[54:26] opinions but to choose whether to serve
[54:28] God
[54:29] or to serve Baal
[54:32] we find ourselves generation after
[54:35] generation having to make a choice Ruth
[54:38] chose one day that she was going to go
[54:41] with Naomi she says your God will be my
[54:43] God your people will be my people where
[54:47] you die I will die Ruth made the right
[54:49] choice and we would follow her life she
[54:52] ended up marrying Boaz
[54:55] and and end up even being part of the
[54:58] lineage of the Lord Jesus Christ it
[55:01] because she made the right choice
[55:04] her sister-in-law had an opportunity to
[55:07] choose Oprah went back but Ruth went
[55:09] forth by faith
[55:11] and look at what her results were
[55:16] make the right choice
[55:19] I want to
[55:21] look at this Rich Young Ruler again
[55:25] because he he made a choice
[55:28] we read there a man in in Matthew
[55:32] about this young man and how he
[55:34] approached the Lord Jesus but you know I
[55:37] thank God for a prophet
[55:39] because this same story in Matthew is
[55:41] also told in the Book of Luke
[55:44] and um and you know when we when we go
[55:47] back and we look at the Book of Luke we
[55:49] we see things just say a rich man a rich
[55:51] man a rich man a rich man but a prophet
[55:54] was able to kind of tie this together
[55:56] and it tells us that this was the same
[55:58] rich man now here's the other thing
[56:01] about it is that when you when you look
[56:02] at Jesus telling the various Parables
[56:05] because
[56:06] um uh in Luke 12 in Luke 12 we see that
[56:11] this rich man uh he got he got rich and
[56:15] he had so many bar I mean he had so much
[56:17] stuff that uh he makes some choices in
[56:19] life where you know what he he got rich
[56:22] he got she got wealthy you know all for
[56:24] these choices that he made but uh but
[56:27] the problem is is that he didn't
[56:28] consider his soul
[56:31] he didn't consider his soul you know and
[56:33] oftentimes young people you have to be
[56:35] careful that sometimes we might make a
[56:37] choice in a career
[56:40] and that career could be very damaging
[56:42] Amen to our spiritual walk
[56:45] sometimes we have to choose to say no to
[56:48] a job
[56:49] and God will put it before you he'll set
[56:51] it for you to see which way you will
[56:54] choose sometimes we have to put God
[56:56] first and I love it because the Bible
[56:58] actually says seek ye first the kingdom
[57:01] of heaven and all of its righteousness
[57:04] and everything else will be added unto
[57:06] you I've had to say no to job sometimes
[57:09] that I knew would take me out of
[57:11] Fellowship
[57:12] but you know what I saw God blessed me
[57:14] more when I said no to that
[57:16] than what I would have had if I would
[57:18] have said yes to it no matter how much
[57:20] money they're offering
[57:23] you have to choose Christ
[57:26] he has to be first
[57:28] he owns it all anyway
[57:31] amen and there's a lot more where that
[57:33] come from if you just choose God
[57:36] here you know and and oftentimes we have
[57:39] that prayer uh Lord if it's not your
[57:42] will then God just somehow no no no no
[57:44] no he doesn't move like that all the
[57:46] time he wants to see what you're going
[57:48] to choose
[57:49] and my encouragement is make the right
[57:52] choice
[57:55] sometimes if you want mama daddy to give
[57:57] you the pastor to tell you no they want
[58:00] to see what you're going to choose make
[58:02] the right choice
[58:05] you know this this this Rich Young Ruler
[58:07] we found him in Luke 12 and and you know
[58:10] he got he got to a spot where he was he
[58:13] was just doing very very well for
[58:15] himself he said you know I got so much
[58:17] that I don't my barns can't contain it
[58:19] and he decided that he would have built
[58:22] greater Barnes you know than the ones
[58:24] that he had and and uh but the the sad
[58:27] part about you know where he found
[58:28] himself
[58:30] is that he had not made preparation
[58:33] for his eternal
[58:35] I shouldn't say Turner but his his
[58:38] resting place after after death because
[58:41] you can't go to hell and live eternally
[58:42] there's only one form of eternal life
[58:44] and that's what you receive through
[58:45] Christ
[58:46] amen if you reject Christ you cannot
[58:49] have eternal life just doesn't work that
[58:51] way right so so he he rejected a man cry
[58:55] and when we when we saw a story there in
[58:58] Luke 12
[58:59] um you know what what it is what I
[59:01] always felt is that Jesus was just
[59:03] really just giving prophecy about this
[59:05] young man he was just telling talking
[59:07] about him before they actually met him
[59:09] later on in Luke right but he's just
[59:12] telling stories about this this young
[59:13] man and here he got he got greater after
[59:16] he rejected Christ this young man got
[59:19] greater riches
[59:21] he was already a Rich Young Ruler but he
[59:24] got greater riches after he made the
[59:26] choice to reject Christ
[59:30] but also it tells us in Luke 16 that
[59:32] this same young man lifted up his eyes
[59:35] in hell
[59:37] he made the wrong choice
[59:40] and he might have got greater riches he
[59:42] might have did this he might in my his
[59:44] name might have made it into to to uh
[59:46] some great book or something like that
[59:48] but you know ultimately he he ended up
[59:51] losing his soul and the Bible says what
[59:54] does it profit a man to gain this world
[59:56] and then lose
[59:59] his soul
[1:00:01] this young man made the wrong
[1:00:05] choice
[1:00:09] Luke 18
[1:00:12] we see
[1:00:14] um another little apparel about this
[1:00:15] young man
[1:00:17] and and we can pull it up Luke 18 verse
[1:00:19] 18 through 23
[1:00:25] and this is the same story that we read
[1:00:27] of him that we read of him and and and
[1:00:29] and and Matthew
[1:00:32] says in a certain ruler acts I'm saying
[1:00:35] good Master what shall I do to inherit
[1:00:37] eternal life
[1:00:39] when Jesus said unto him and like I said
[1:00:41] it was it was prophecy when you look in
[1:00:43] Luke 12 and Luke 16 Jesus just really
[1:00:46] talking prophecy of this young man
[1:00:48] before he actually comes to him and
[1:00:50] meets him personally
[1:00:51] Jesus already told you now he's going to
[1:00:53] reject me and what is going to be his
[1:00:54] end result not only saw what his end
[1:00:56] result was going to be on Earth but his
[1:00:59] end result and what is going to happen
[1:01:00] after he left the Earth
[1:01:04] look at this
[1:01:06] in a certain rule asked him saying good
[1:01:08] Master what shall I do to inherit
[1:01:11] eternal life and Jesus said to him why
[1:01:12] color stop me good
[1:01:14] none is good safe one that is God thou
[1:01:17] knowest the Commandments do not commit
[1:01:19] adultery do not kill do not still do not
[1:01:21] bear false witness honor thy father not
[1:01:23] mother and he said all these I have kept
[1:01:26] from my youth up and I'm gonna tell you
[1:01:27] I really like that statement I've
[1:01:28] actually preached a sermon on that uh
[1:01:31] keep it from your youth up
[1:01:33] I want I mean it's I think it's good
[1:01:35] that this young man had a testimony
[1:01:37] actually the scripture tells us that
[1:01:39] Jesus loved him Jesus absolutely loved
[1:01:41] him he appreciated this young man and I
[1:01:44] Think Jesus would love anybody can say
[1:01:45] I've kept the word
[1:01:47] from my youth up
[1:01:49] I I I I'm in my 50s now but I've kept
[1:01:53] the word since a young man
[1:01:55] and I'm still keeping it today I think
[1:01:58] it's a wonderful Testament if you got
[1:02:00] young people that can raise up Amen in
[1:02:02] in the house of God say I've been
[1:02:04] keeping the word since my youth up
[1:02:06] what a testimony to whole
[1:02:10] he goes on to say this in verse 22 and
[1:02:12] now when Jesus heard these things he
[1:02:14] said in them yet lacketh thou one thing
[1:02:17] sell all that thou has distributed to
[1:02:20] the poor thou shall have treasure into
[1:02:22] heaven and come follow me
[1:02:24] when he heard this he was very sorrowful
[1:02:26] for he was very rich
[1:02:28] and when Jesus saw that he was very
[1:02:31] sorrowful he said how hardly
[1:02:33] so they that have riches enter into the
[1:02:35] kingdom of God for it is easier for a
[1:02:38] camera to go through a needle's eye than
[1:02:40] for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
[1:02:42] of God Amen this young man had a choice
[1:02:45] that he made that day
[1:02:48] his choice was to walk away from Christ
[1:02:52] he walked away from Christ and and like
[1:02:55] I said you go back and pick up a store
[1:02:57] in Luke 16 you'll find that in hell he
[1:02:59] lifted up his eyes he made the wrong
[1:03:02] choice
[1:03:04] brother random makes a statement here in
[1:03:06] the message Investments
[1:03:11] he says but this Rich Young Man
[1:03:13] now here's something for you businessman
[1:03:15] and I have to close
[1:03:17] notice now so you'll get this
[1:03:19] let this sink deep in your hearts by
[1:03:21] rejecting Jesus that never stopped his
[1:03:23] increase of goods
[1:03:26] right he continued on let's follow him a
[1:03:28] while down through the Bible his flow of
[1:03:31] goods got greater and because your
[1:03:33] business picks up a little bit don't you
[1:03:35] never think that all the time that's
[1:03:38] God's blessings
[1:03:41] the wicked prosper
[1:03:43] you know this man he got greater and he
[1:03:47] got to a place till he he was so great
[1:03:49] to all of his barns bursted almost he
[1:03:53] had to build new ones now he thought he
[1:03:55] had done the right thing by turning down
[1:03:57] Jesus and not making an investment in
[1:03:59] him he thought he he had done the right
[1:04:02] thing because in the worldly possessions
[1:04:04] if I'm gonna say something now he says
[1:04:07] I'm going to say something now in
[1:04:08] worldly possessions he thought he'd done
[1:04:10] the right thing because he had prospered
[1:04:12] and that's what our denominations think
[1:04:15] because they organize themselves and
[1:04:17] their groups become multi-millionaires
[1:04:19] Millionaires and billionaires they feel
[1:04:21] that they are it it says didn't the
[1:04:24] Bible say thou rich and increased in
[1:04:26] Goods to this age but don't know that
[1:04:29] you're naked miserable poor wretched
[1:04:31] blind and don't even know it what a
[1:04:33] miserable condition
[1:04:35] men and Brethren don't make an
[1:04:37] investment in something like that it's
[1:04:39] bound to perish why not make an
[1:04:42] investment in something that's proved
[1:04:44] that's proved down through the Bible as
[1:04:46] you know with the text I got written
[1:04:48] here we could be here tonight still on
[1:04:51] these texts proving Through the Bible
[1:04:53] those who made that and who turned it
[1:04:55] down I am showing you a real investment
[1:04:58] to make put your life your time your
[1:05:01] money your talent put everything you got
[1:05:04] in Christ God guaranteed it uh
[1:05:08] guaranteed it to us by raising them up
[1:05:10] again we'll rise in the last days he
[1:05:13] promised it what more could you look
[1:05:15] forward to tell me any investment you
[1:05:17] can make with payoff like that tell me
[1:05:20] where you can invest this morning and
[1:05:22] make 10 million dollars in tomorrow be a
[1:05:24] corpse what good would it do you what
[1:05:27] profit a man if he gain the whole world
[1:05:29] and loses Soul what if you're popular
[1:05:32] and cause so-and-so and Deacon
[1:05:34] Presbyterian Dr Bishop Elder Pope or
[1:05:37] whatever you might be called that's the
[1:05:40] Praises of men I'd rather be called a
[1:05:42] Holy Roller by the people and have been
[1:05:45] a Son of God in my heart with the new
[1:05:47] birth and the spirit of Christ dwelling
[1:05:49] in me
[1:05:50] and him proving it by the Vindication of
[1:05:52] his word and making me live the life
[1:05:55] that I once lived I don't live no more
[1:05:58] Paul said and yet he was a teacher and a
[1:06:01] scholar but he changed his life when he
[1:06:04] met Christ and made him and made and
[1:06:07] made his investment in Christ he was a
[1:06:10] different man from then on even Paul had
[1:06:12] to choose to follow Christ
[1:06:15] even Paul had to choose I mean brother
[1:06:18] Branham had to come to a spot one day
[1:06:19] where he chose to follow Christ
[1:06:22] amen your pastor amen any Minister
[1:06:24] that's standing up before the people
[1:06:26] they all had to come to a choice one day
[1:06:28] to follow Christ
[1:06:30] young people you're in the same spot you
[1:06:32] have to follow you have to choose to
[1:06:34] follow Christ Jesus is a gentleman he
[1:06:37] won't force himself on one of us but he
[1:06:40] wants us to open our hearts and receive
[1:06:41] him
[1:06:43] the Rich Young Ruler failed to make the
[1:06:46] right choice
[1:06:47] but we have another character in the
[1:06:49] scripture that we want to compare and
[1:06:50] that's with Moses because Moses chose
[1:06:52] the suffer the afflictions
[1:06:55] with the people of God he had it I mean
[1:06:58] he had it made Moses was you know you
[1:07:00] all know the story of Moses mother and
[1:07:03] his and he I mean think about the choice
[1:07:05] that his mother and the father had to
[1:07:06] make one day when they were there in the
[1:07:08] house and and and and and and and and
[1:07:10] and and all a pharaoh and all of his uh
[1:07:13] Army was going looking for all the
[1:07:15] babies to try to kill everybody two
[1:07:16] years old and under
[1:07:18] they had this they had this this law
[1:07:20] passed and they wanted them to kill all
[1:07:21] the little boy babies and and his mother
[1:07:24] and father made a choice that they were
[1:07:25] going to put Moses in a little basket
[1:07:27] and push him out into the Nile River
[1:07:30] never I mean and the choice was so um
[1:07:33] the choice was so that they they
[1:07:35] probably thought they'd never see their
[1:07:37] son again they'd never they would never
[1:07:39] know what happened to their son they're
[1:07:41] gonna just commit them to the Nile River
[1:07:43] oh Hallelujah the good thing about this
[1:07:45] story is that Miriam watched the baby
[1:07:48] just go down the Nile River and and and
[1:07:49] the baby ended up making it to Pharaoh's
[1:07:52] Court Pharaoh's daughter out there you
[1:07:54] know bathing in in in the river and and
[1:07:56] she sees this basket come up and she
[1:07:59] can't have children herself so she she
[1:08:00] takes to say I'm gonna make this baby my
[1:08:02] own right and when Miriam sees the sees
[1:08:05] the sees that she's she pipes up said
[1:08:07] would you like for me to get somebody to
[1:08:10] help raise the baby for you and and
[1:08:12] she's like yeah go find somebody real
[1:08:15] quick Miriam had the perfect person in
[1:08:17] mind so I'm gonna run back home and tell
[1:08:19] Mama
[1:08:21] they need a babysitter in Pharaoh's
[1:08:23] Court
[1:08:25] well who am I gonna babysit it's going
[1:08:27] to be your own baby mama can you believe
[1:08:29] this
[1:08:30] Moses mother made the choice to give up
[1:08:33] a baby to them now and now I've got
[1:08:35] rewards sir by letting her raise her own
[1:08:37] baby in Pharaoh's court and she got paid
[1:08:40] for it
[1:08:43] she made the right choice
[1:08:46] when Moses was there being raised and
[1:08:49] his mother is remember brother random
[1:08:51] said Mother's the first teacher
[1:08:53] and while he's being raised but the
[1:08:56] babysitter has an opportunity to sow
[1:08:58] some seeds in him to tell him you know
[1:09:01] this is what happened and that's what
[1:09:02] happened and God has called you to be
[1:09:04] the deliverer I mean you're the one
[1:09:06] you're a special child your proper child
[1:09:08] God has called you to be delivered Moses
[1:09:10] don't you get caught up in the things of
[1:09:12] Egypt I don't care what they offer you
[1:09:14] are a Hebrew and don't ever forget that
[1:09:18] and Moses had had the world in his hands
[1:09:23] but the Bible tells us that he he made a
[1:09:27] different choice let's pick it up in
[1:09:29] Hebrews chapter 11. verse 23-26 let's
[1:09:33] read what the Bible says about Moses how
[1:09:35] he made he made the right choice yeah
[1:09:39] Hebrews 11 verse 23 says by faith Moses
[1:09:42] when he was born was hit three months of
[1:09:44] his parents
[1:09:45] because they saw that he was a proper
[1:09:47] child and they were not afraid of the
[1:09:48] king's commandment
[1:09:50] by faith Moses see he had he had to come
[1:09:54] to this on his own by faith Moses when
[1:09:57] he was come to years not just because
[1:09:59] mama said it not because daddy said it
[1:10:02] no but but I came to this decision on my
[1:10:05] own when he when he was come to years
[1:10:07] refused
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:10] to be called the son of Pharaoh's
[1:10:12] daughter
[1:10:14] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[1:10:18] with the people of God he looked out the
[1:10:21] window and saw all the suffering he says
[1:10:24] but I belong to them I belong to be out
[1:10:26] there with them he chose choosing rather
[1:10:29] to rather than be in the palace
[1:10:32] I choose to suffer Affliction with the
[1:10:35] people of God than to enjoy the
[1:10:37] pleasures of sin for a season
[1:10:40] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[1:10:43] riches than the treasures in Egypt
[1:10:45] for he had respect them to the
[1:10:47] recompense of the war Moses did not
[1:10:49] realize that his choosing was going to
[1:10:51] be so great
[1:10:54] look at how God used him to open up a
[1:10:56] Red Sea
[1:10:58] to get them really close to going into
[1:11:00] the promised land he he had spies go
[1:11:02] over and spied all out
[1:11:04] I mean just just all the supernatural
[1:11:06] things that happened down in Egypt
[1:11:07] before they left I mean so many great
[1:11:10] things God used this man Moses but Moses
[1:11:12] Moses
[1:11:15] had to make a choice
[1:11:18] I encourage you make the right choice
[1:11:21] I don't I don't I don't know what God
[1:11:23] has for your future
[1:11:25] but I know if you make the right choice
[1:11:27] great things are in store
[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:37] there's a couple quotes that I want to
[1:11:39] read about Moses here and this was
[1:11:41] coming out of the message looking at the
[1:11:42] Unseen
[1:11:49] brother random says Moses when he had
[1:11:52] become 40 years old a young man and as
[1:11:55] far as sight was concerned Moses had the
[1:11:57] world in his hand
[1:11:58] he was the next pharaoh of Egypt and he
[1:12:00] had all the lands in the world riding
[1:12:03] right in his hand to be king over the
[1:12:05] entire Earth knowing of that day
[1:12:07] and yet he looked through the window
[1:12:09] that Pharaoh looked out of and he saw
[1:12:11] those Hebrews to pharaoh
[1:12:14] who looked upon them they were nothing
[1:12:15] but a bunch of mutt daubers down there
[1:12:17] in the mud making brick
[1:12:19] to the celebrity as past
[1:12:23] to the celebrity has passed by they were
[1:12:25] the same the well-dressed people that
[1:12:28] was a bunch of slaves nothing but mud
[1:12:30] wallers but when Moses looked out the
[1:12:33] same window he saw them different
[1:12:35] because he looked at the Unseen and know
[1:12:38] that God promised that he would deliver
[1:12:39] them out of the place out of that place
[1:12:42] and take them to the land of promise for
[1:12:45] he looked at the Unseen he saw the year
[1:12:48] that he saw the years that were coming
[1:12:50] ahead he saw Egypt destroyed yet
[1:12:54] uh yet she uh yet she was in her a
[1:12:58] blossoming time he saw Egypt as she is
[1:13:02] today and he saw Israel all comfortably
[1:13:04] seated around Abraham in glory and by
[1:13:07] faith he chose to take the worst of the
[1:13:09] real the worst the religion could give
[1:13:11] him and compared with the best the world
[1:13:13] could give him and he chose the suffer
[1:13:16] the approach of Christ and considered a
[1:13:17] great treasure then all Egypt could
[1:13:19] afford to give him because he endured as
[1:13:22] seeing him who is invisible
[1:13:28] I want to let's keep on reading it says
[1:13:30] here was Moses
[1:13:32] he had his one foot on the throne this
[1:13:35] is out of the message to Resurrection I
[1:13:37] believe uh I'm sorry the results of the
[1:13:40] decision uh he here was Moses he had his
[1:13:42] foot on the throne
[1:13:43] he could have had a great he could have
[1:13:45] turned uh turned on Egypt down there and
[1:13:47] maybe stayed there but God's promise was
[1:13:50] a journey through the Wilderness and go
[1:13:51] to the promised land go to get uh got to
[1:13:54] get in position first and Moses chose
[1:13:58] rather to suffer with the people than to
[1:13:59] set on the throne down there because it
[1:14:02] was revealed to him spiritually and here
[1:14:04] he was going and God was proving here's
[1:14:07] how you know whether you're in the right
[1:14:09] group or not God always vindicates his
[1:14:11] church with signs and wonders no matter
[1:14:13] how Orthodox you are it depends on
[1:14:16] whether God is accepting his sacrifice
[1:14:18] right and here's another that I just
[1:14:21] love out of this sermon by faith Moses
[1:14:23] brother random talks about Moses making
[1:14:25] that choice and and we all have to come
[1:14:27] to the spot where we make the right
[1:14:29] choice no matter who we are no matter
[1:14:31] what generation we live in we all have a
[1:14:34] uh we have to we have to choose from the
[1:14:36] days of Adam and Eve to our day
[1:14:39] we have to choose
[1:14:43] he said there's a chosen
[1:14:45] we choose for ourselves we choose
[1:14:48] something that's for our own good but
[1:14:50] Moses chose the afflictions and the
[1:14:52] disgrace that he might walk with the
[1:14:54] people of God think of it now listen to
[1:14:57] it choose the afflictions of the people
[1:14:58] of God and counter a greater treasure
[1:15:03] a greater treasure that's something I
[1:15:06] mean just in your mindset I think being
[1:15:09] in a church is greater than me being out
[1:15:11] there in the world and becoming a
[1:15:12] millionaire
[1:15:14] serving God that that's better that's a
[1:15:17] greater treasure it goes against common
[1:15:19] thinking but yet it's God's way
[1:15:23] look at this it says this
[1:15:27] that he might walk with the people of
[1:15:29] God think of it listen to it choose the
[1:15:30] Affliction of the people of God
[1:15:32] encounter the greater treasure for he
[1:15:34] endured seeing him who was invisibly now
[1:15:37] a lot one time had to make a choice and
[1:15:39] maybe this morning that there'll be men
[1:15:41] and women sitting here that'll make your
[1:15:42] final choice
[1:15:44] the prophet says you are today
[1:15:47] what you are
[1:15:49] because several years ago you chose to
[1:15:51] be what you are now
[1:15:55] he says what you choose now today what
[1:15:59] you choose now will determine what
[1:16:01] you'll be five years from today
[1:16:04] he says five years for today you may be
[1:16:06] a missionary
[1:16:07] five years from today you may be a
[1:16:10] renowned Christian
[1:16:11] or five years from today you may be in
[1:16:14] hell like the Rich Young Ruler was
[1:16:16] because you made the wrong decision
[1:16:20] it says five years from today you may be
[1:16:22] cleaning spit Tunes in a ballroom
[1:16:25] ashtrays right five years from today you
[1:16:28] may be a prostitute on the street or you
[1:16:31] may be a man or a woman that's a credit
[1:16:33] to any society because of your choice
[1:16:36] for Christ
[1:16:37] he says five years from day you may be
[1:16:39] in glory going in the Rapture because
[1:16:41] you made your choice today but you've
[1:16:44] got to choose
[1:16:47] and don't look at what you see
[1:16:50] choose what you see by faith
[1:16:53] that's the only thing that would count
[1:16:55] is what you choose by faith
[1:17:02] brother Branham
[1:17:05] had to make a choice one day and I'm
[1:17:08] going towards the end of this sermon I'm
[1:17:11] bringing it to a close
[1:17:14] um
[1:17:15] brother Branham had to make a choice one
[1:17:18] day he was there amongst the
[1:17:21] the Baptists
[1:17:23] he was an ordained minister there in the
[1:17:25] Baptist Church
[1:17:27] and they had a great pastor but you know
[1:17:30] he come to a spot where he knew God was
[1:17:32] calling him for more and they um they
[1:17:35] asked him to to or help ordain women
[1:17:37] preachers and brother random you know
[1:17:40] said no I'm sorry I can't do that that's
[1:17:42] against the word of God and and I can't
[1:17:44] go against the word of God you know I
[1:17:46] got to stay with the word no matter what
[1:17:47] what the church says I'm going to say
[1:17:49] what the word says and he uh and so his
[1:17:51] Pastor said you know what if you're not
[1:17:52] going to ordain women preachers then you
[1:17:54] know we're going to take your cart back
[1:17:55] and you're not going to be able to be a
[1:17:56] minister he said well that's fine you
[1:17:58] can take my card
[1:17:59] well he decided to leave the church
[1:18:02] and I told the pastor that God showed
[1:18:04] him in a vision that he prayed for kings
[1:18:06] and important people he would do all
[1:18:08] kind of things like are you a young man
[1:18:09] seventh grade education how are you
[1:18:11] going to do that he says I don't know
[1:18:12] how I'm going to do it but I know God
[1:18:14] told me that I would do it
[1:18:15] he says yo you have some really really
[1:18:17] bad dreams that's all you had you ate
[1:18:19] the wrong thing you have some bad news
[1:18:20] like well you can say whatever you want
[1:18:22] to say but I'm going to make my choice
[1:18:23] I'm going to stay with the word of God
[1:18:26] God gave him other pulpits to preaching
[1:18:29] and because of his choice his ministry
[1:18:32] has impacted the whole world around this
[1:18:35] message is going forth
[1:18:36] praise the Lord we thank God for him
[1:18:38] making a choice
[1:18:40] but one day brother Branham was at a
[1:18:41] meeting and and uh when he when he went
[1:18:43] to the meeting he preached the sermon
[1:18:46] and at the end of the sermon uh a
[1:18:48] brother walked up to him and just began
[1:18:50] to make comments you know about the
[1:18:52] sermon and uh and and before he knew it
[1:18:55] as the man was making the comments the
[1:18:56] man burst out and speaking in tongues
[1:18:59] and as he spoke in tongues he had never
[1:19:01] spoken tongues one day of his life but
[1:19:03] this young man burst down in tongues and
[1:19:05] and three people walked up and said you
[1:19:08] know what uh
[1:19:10] that that was perfect French that was
[1:19:13] not that we don't need an interpreter
[1:19:14] for that that was perfect Prince and and
[1:19:16] the three people that walked up one guy
[1:19:18] happened to be you know
[1:19:20] um I mean real real high up and I want
[1:19:22] to read what he said there but real high
[1:19:24] up in the government he's like I know
[1:19:26] I'm a French interpreter and I know that
[1:19:27] was just perfect French had three as a
[1:19:30] witness
[1:19:32] and this is what uh they said in the
[1:19:35] message standing in the gap
[1:19:38] it says listen to this I can
[1:19:40] if I can read it it says I Victor Ledoux
[1:19:43] am a full-blooded Frenchman born again

[1:20:17] and and this was the the interpretation
[1:20:19] of says because thou has chosen

[1:20:25] the Hardaway
[1:20:27] thou has walked
[1:20:29] in your own choosing you chose to do it
[1:20:31] the harder way you chose that and and
[1:20:34] look at this it says now I can I can see
[1:20:36] that Moses had to make his choice too
[1:20:38] see says thou has picked
[1:20:42] the precise and correct way he made the
[1:20:45] right choice thou has picked the precise
[1:20:48] and correct way correct decision and it
[1:20:52] is my way
[1:20:55] and I should have underlined it because
[1:20:56] it said underlined my way the holy
[1:20:59] spirit's speaking back
[1:21:00] right it says because of this momentous
[1:21:05] decision
[1:21:06] a huge portion of Heaven awaits you
[1:21:09] awaits thee what a glorious decision
[1:21:12] says now listen close it what a glorious
[1:21:15] decision thou has made this in itself
[1:21:19] is that which will make and come to pass
[1:21:23] the tremendous victory
[1:21:25] in the love divine amen
[1:21:28] my encouragement to every young person
[1:21:31] amen
[1:21:32] make the right choice
[1:21:35] choose to follow God
[1:21:37] choose to serve him with everything you
[1:21:39] got
[1:21:40] this world has nothing to offer
[1:21:42] nothing of Eternal value
[1:21:46] Deuteronomy 30 in 19
[1:21:52] I call Heaven and Earth
[1:21:55] to record this day against you
[1:21:59] but I have set before your life and
[1:22:01] death
[1:22:03] blessing and cursing
[1:22:06] therefore choose life
[1:22:09] that both thou
[1:22:11] and thy seed
[1:22:13] may live
[1:22:16] yeah let's pray
[1:22:23] father God
[1:22:27] we thank you for your word
[1:22:32] your word has the ability to penetrate
[1:22:34] Lord right where we are
[1:22:37] you know how to reach us
[1:22:39] you know how to speak to us God and I
[1:22:42] know Lord that you would have this
[1:22:44] sermon ministered here today because
[1:22:45] maybe somebody's at a point where they
[1:22:48] need to make a choice
[1:22:51] the encouragement from the Holy Spirit
[1:22:52] today is to make the right choice amen
[1:22:55] the examples have been sent a rich young
[1:22:58] ruler who who did not make the right
[1:23:00] choice
[1:23:03] Lord in the scripture clearly told us
[1:23:05] that he lifted his eyes and hail
[1:23:08] this Barnes got greater he was more
[1:23:11] wealthy and that's not a sign that it's
[1:23:14] God's blessing sometimes it's Satan
[1:23:16] that's behind all of that
[1:23:17] drawing us further and further away from
[1:23:20] from Christ
[1:23:22] I pray that you'd help us to discern it
[1:23:24] and to always keep the word first no
[1:23:27] matter what decisions we're making let
[1:23:28] us base our decisions on the word of God
[1:23:31] then we know that we're standing on the
[1:23:33] proper Foundation
[1:23:35] we also saw father Moses he made the
[1:23:39] right choice
[1:23:41] and God uh you you he had to come to a
[1:23:45] spot where you know I I I no longer want
[1:23:47] to be called the daughter of pharaoh and
[1:23:49] that's not my that's not who I am I am
[1:23:53] I'm a child of Israel and I I have to
[1:23:56] get out there and be with be with them
[1:23:57] I'm raised I was born to be to deliver
[1:24:01] and father he made the right choice to
[1:24:03] suffer the afflictions with the people
[1:24:05] of God
[1:24:06] rather than enjoy the the pleasures of
[1:24:08] sin
[1:24:09] so Lord uh how you raise them up and how
[1:24:11] you use them as a minor delivery even
[1:24:13] Moses was able to make the statement the
[1:24:16] Lord your God will raise a prophet like
[1:24:18] unto me what a what a statement knowing
[1:24:21] that Christ was coming
[1:24:23] Lord we thank you that he made the right
[1:24:25] choice that we can we can gain from
[1:24:27] these examples and even your Prophet
[1:24:28] Lord one day having to leave the Baptist
[1:24:30] Church and stay stand with the word of
[1:24:33] God
[1:24:35] my I think even is is his first
[1:24:37] mother-in-law uh called the the Holy
[1:24:40] Rollers the outcasts but it's I'm gonna
[1:24:42] make a a a a a choice to stay with them
[1:24:45] and how Lord in his ministry they're
[1:24:48] coming this man prophesies over him
[1:24:50] because you mate
[1:24:52] that decision that was the right
[1:24:55] decision it was correct decision not
[1:24:57] only that it is my way
[1:25:00] and this
[1:25:01] because you made this decision
[1:25:04] is going to make and bring the past the
[1:25:07] tremendous victory
[1:25:09] in the love divine
[1:25:11] I pray that you bring young people both
[1:25:13] those present and those streaming
[1:25:16] to a spot where they can make the right
[1:25:19] choice
[1:25:21] God is in Jesus name that we pray
[1:25:25] amen
[1:25:27] amen
[1:25:30] praise the Lord
[1:25:31] amen
[1:25:38] God bless you I'll turn the service back
[1:25:41] to your pastor at this time
[1:25:51] good job
[1:25:53] if anybody has a need
[1:25:56] they're getting ready with for the food
[1:25:57] downstairs
[1:26:01] this whole world is made out of choices
[1:26:06] and that's what's so Grand about free
[1:26:07] moral agency
[1:26:09] we're not robots we're not zombies we're
[1:26:11] not
[1:26:12] no we're not that we're human beings to
[1:26:14] make a choice
[1:26:16] he put us here to make a choice
[1:26:19] and that Rich Young Ruler he thought he
[1:26:21] had the world
[1:26:23] in the palm of his hand
[1:26:25] and he may have for a little while
[1:26:28] but why would we want to lose our soul
[1:26:31] just for a little bit of a little bit of
[1:26:34] a season as as I said about Moses he
[1:26:37] chose that he chose that and then we got
[1:26:40] a prophet in the end time he chose right
[1:26:43] he and and you know we could have said
[1:26:46] that bro Jack we could have said but God
[1:26:48] told him through interpretation yes God
[1:26:51] went ahead and put an exclamation point
[1:26:52] on it he said it's just not his opinion
[1:26:55] he said it's my opinion
[1:26:56] and he's a Mine He's Mine I I'm gonna
[1:26:59] say in tongues where just not everybody
[1:27:02] can understand it but a certain group of
[1:27:05] people aren't you glad that he spoke in
[1:27:07] tongues to me and you it might have been
[1:27:10] Kentucky English all right it might have
[1:27:12] been it might have been Hanks and totes
[1:27:14] and all those different things but God
[1:27:17] spoke to us through a prophet amen and
[1:27:20] we chose Amen to continue to listen
[1:27:22] there's a lot of people listen that's
[1:27:25] right but we continue to listen we
[1:27:27] continue to make that right choice amen
[1:27:31] brother Brown and preached doors and
[1:27:33] doors and we've been going through the
[1:27:34] statue of perfect man you know you get
[1:27:36] born again you let God in your house
[1:27:38] they still choices you got to make
[1:27:39] because God God you know I was telling
[1:27:42] bro Jack I said now if I was a Holy
[1:27:43] Ghost and you let me in your house and
[1:27:45] you had some doors shut I'd be in there
[1:27:47] kicking them doors down
[1:27:50] because I want to see what's in there
[1:27:51] but but thank God for a prophet that
[1:27:53] said said no the Holy Ghost is timid
[1:27:56] he's gonna wait on you to make a choice
[1:27:59] and whether you laid him in the door or
[1:28:01] not that's your choice I pray today that
[1:28:04] you laid him in your door Glory let him
