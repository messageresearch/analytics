[4:58] and
[5:00] we're going to see how this contraption

[5:08] i'm not too good about having
[5:09] microphones around my head
[5:12] i like him more in my hand
[5:14] but we're going to try and see
[5:16] so um i trust everyone's doing well
[5:18] let's turn to mark chapter 16.
[5:22] mark acts chapter 16. uh you notice that
[5:25] the scriptures i've just been reading
[5:27] it's been missionary
[5:30] minded scriptures and uh
[5:33] because
[5:35] the importance of mission work it
[5:38] wasn't just
[5:40] wasn't invented or
[5:42] just one of the disciples came up with
[5:44] it it was jesus's own words
[5:47] and uh we'll read a quote here in just a
[5:49] moment
[5:50] that where brother branham says
[5:52] something very interesting here but in
[5:53] mark chapter 16
[5:56] um
[5:57] let's just bow our heads before we read
[5:58] the word
[6:00] our heavenly father we thank you lord
[6:01] once again for the opportunity to serve
[6:03] you lord jesus and to open back the
[6:05] pages of your word father thank you for
[6:07] bringing us here lord
[6:09] and father god we just realized lord
[6:11] that we're insufficient without you lord
[6:13] jesus
[6:14] so we pray oh god that your father just
[6:16] come in our midst lord and have your way
[6:19] father here tonight lord speak to our
[6:21] hajj father god inspire us lord through
[6:24] your word and lord jesus that this last
[6:26] part father of the trip lord god that
[6:29] you you gave us and you directed us lord
[6:32] jesus may it be a blessing father god to
[6:34] those watching and even to those that
[6:37] will watch later lord jesus we just
[6:39] commit ourselves into your hands now and
[6:41] the requests everyone father god that
[6:44] was mentioned into your hands lord this
[6:46] evening we pray these things now in
[6:48] jesus christ's name amen
[6:51] amen mark chapter 16 verse 14 the bible
[6:54] says
[6:55] afterward he appeared unto the eleven
[6:58] as they sat at meat
[7:00] and abraded them with their unbelief
[7:03] and hardness of heart
[7:05] because they believed not them which had
[7:08] seen him after he was risen
[7:11] and he said unto them
[7:12] go ye into all the world
[7:15] and preach the gospel to every creature
[7:20] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[7:23] be saved
[7:24] but he that believeth not shall be
[7:27] damned
[7:29] and in order for them to be damned they
[7:31] would have to have disbelieved the word
[7:33] first
[7:34] so jesus has given here an opportunity
[7:37] for everyone to hear the gospel amen but
[7:40] in order for them to be damned they
[7:42] would have to reject the gospel
[7:44] right
[7:45] and these signs shall follow them that
[7:48] belief
[7:50] in my name shall they cast out devils
[7:53] they shall speak with new tongues
[7:55] they shall take up serpents and if they
[7:57] drink any deadly thing
[8:00] it shall not hurt them
[8:02] they shall lay hands on the sick
[8:05] and they shall recover
[8:07] notice how everything is so positive
[8:09] they shall
[8:11] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[8:13] them he was received up into heaven and
[8:16] sat on the right hand of god
[8:18] and they went forth
[8:20] and preached everywhere the lord working
[8:22] with them and confirming the word with
[8:25] signs following
[8:26] praise the lord you may be seated this
[8:29] afternoon this evening let's read this
[8:31] quote here
[8:35] brother branham says the following and
[8:36] the message end time
[8:38] evangelism he says
[8:42] he says here's some
[8:44] he says we know redemption is nigh
[8:46] amen
[8:48] see something's fixing to take place
[8:50] now the world doesn't see that
[8:53] they laugh at it because like they did
[8:55] in other days but we know that it's
[8:57] coming near
[8:59] man
[9:00] if you're if you don't live in this hour
[9:02] amen if you don't realize something is
[9:03] going on
[9:05] you're hiding in a rock
[9:08] you you're you're you you feel like you
[9:10] just want to stay here and and but i'm
[9:13] telling you what
[9:15] things are happening so fast around us
[9:18] and uh
[9:19] that it the only thing to do is nowadays
[9:21] saints is just grab on to him
[9:24] amen there's nothing though don't you
[9:25] have no hopes in banks accounts
[9:28] uh you have no hopes in in in the stock
[9:30] market you have no hope say amen only
[9:32] hope is in his word and what and what
[9:34] you what that what he showed you through
[9:37] his word amen this message that he's
[9:39] given us amen
[9:40] and that's the reason i chose this
[9:42] subject brother branham says for my last
[9:44] for a while for the tabernacle on the
[9:46] end time evangelism and when we are
[9:49] doing mission work or foreign mission
[9:52] with the word of god
[9:53] we know we're always in the will of god
[9:57] because jesus's first commission to his
[9:59] church was go out and preach the gospel
[10:02] that was his first commission to his
[10:03] church this last commission was to
[10:06] preach the gospel also
[10:08] the first time he ever ordained any
[10:10] persons to preach the word and go
[10:12] throughout the country he said heal the
[10:14] sick raise the dead cast out devils as
[10:17] freely as you have received freely give
[10:19] in saint matthew the 10th chapter
[10:21] sending out the 72 by two that was the
[10:25] first commission he gave to his church
[10:27] now the last commission he gave to his
[10:29] church just before he was received up
[10:30] into glory he said go ye into all the
[10:33] world amen so
[10:35] beginning and it ends the same way amen
[10:38] he had just risen from the dead amen
[10:41] so we're always whenever whenever we're
[10:44] in missions we're always in the will of
[10:46] god amen praise the lord jesus and
[10:49] you know uh
[10:50] this beautiful places and beautiful
[10:53] things
[10:54] to to see
[10:55] amen but uh when they when they put a a
[10:58] a
[11:00] a a schedule for you you really don't
[11:02] have time for that
[11:05] and so
[11:06] but um
[11:08] i really learned this and this in this
[11:10] trip that uh
[11:13] we should rest
[11:16] because uh
[11:17] really back to back working it really it
[11:20] really it hurts
[11:23] so
[11:24] as i mentioned sunday you know there
[11:26] were several days where it was just it's
[11:28] like five days straight and some of
[11:30] those days preaching two or three times
[11:31] in a day
[11:32] and it really it really catches on to
[11:34] you think oh i know y'all be fine though
[11:37] it really catches up to you
[11:39] but uh so it's just something that that
[11:41] i learned for next time
[11:43] because
[11:44] you also at the same time you don't want
[11:46] it to be a stumbling block to uh
[11:49] you know to your children as well
[11:52] uh you know they get tired too
[11:56] so they come a point there come a point
[11:58] uh where uh
[12:00] i think
[12:02] one of them
[12:03] zoe was saying we're gonna hear poppy
[12:05] again
[12:06] [Laughter]
[12:09] and then brother eric's little son you
[12:11] know he because brother eric was the one
[12:13] who was riding us around in honduras to
[12:15] the different churches and his little
[12:17] boy i think he's like three years old
[12:19] four years old yeah he's four years old
[12:21] he said
[12:22] we're going to hear brother luis again
[12:28] so
[12:29] yeah
[12:30] but thank god for their patience all
[12:32] right
[12:33] so
[12:34] last time we left we were down here in
[12:36] el banquito
[12:38] i'm sorry in in in choluteca chaluteca
[12:41] honduras this is the border right here
[12:44] of with nicaragua and honduras
[12:47] yeah right here
[12:49] and so
[12:50] that's where we left that so
[12:52] next
[12:55] all right so we were we were here in
[12:57] this area called el tambor and uh in el
[13:00] tambor
[13:01] is where brother eric's father-in-law
[13:03] who is the pastor there and and so we
[13:06] were he was before we had service with
[13:08] them that evening he wanted us to come
[13:10] and see if we could pray for these
[13:12] individuals this this little young
[13:14] brother right here he's uh
[13:16] [Music]
[13:17] he's uh
[13:20] what's the better he has a form of
[13:22] autism but he's he's like 40 something
[13:24] years old
[13:26] he's never been able to walk he's he's
[13:28] just been
[13:30] pretty much just bedridden and so his
[13:32] dad who who who you'll see in just a
[13:35] moment brother cornelio
[13:36] uh he asked that we pray for him and so
[13:39] so we went over to their house and
[13:41] prayed for them
[13:42] next
[13:45] now this is this is that that young
[13:47] man's uh
[13:49] that little brother's grand grandmother
[13:51] she's 94 years old
[13:54] and uh still has a sharp mind
[13:57] she's the honduran version of sister
[13:59] cleta
[14:06] and
[14:07] she remembers a lot of things she was
[14:09] talking to us like she was just a
[14:11] teenager
[14:13] so it's really good to meet her and this
[14:15] is brother robert this is brother eric's
[14:17] father-in-law who's a pastor there in
[14:18] that in that area
[14:20] next
[14:22] all right so this is uh this is brother
[14:24] cornelio this is on a phone call that i
[14:27] was with him about two weeks ago
[14:30] and
[14:31] i want to show you something here real
[14:32] quick the brother cornelio who he's the
[14:34] father of the young man that was in the
[14:36] hammock next
[14:38] now brother cornelio
[14:40] for several weeks before we came over
[14:42] there he was praying to the lord and he
[14:46] asked the lord um
[14:48] that when brother luis would come maybe
[14:50] i could make this request to him and
[14:53] well he this is his house right here
[14:55] and so he he has to take his son
[14:59] and pretty much almost try to carry him
[15:01] everywhere he goes to go use the
[15:02] bathroom everything and it's been like
[15:04] that for
[15:05] 40 something years
[15:07] and so brother cornelius now he's in his
[15:10] late 60s he's he's uh it's been very
[15:13] very tough for him so what they wanted
[15:15] to do is he was he he requested that if
[15:19] he could build a little room right next
[15:22] to his home right here in this area
[15:25] and uh where where there would be a
[15:27] bathroom right there everything needed
[15:29] for that young man to just not have to
[15:31] move him around to different places
[15:33] so um we just put it before the lord
[15:36] prayed for him and i really i really
[15:38] felt uh led up on upon my heart that
[15:41] part of the money that that that you all
[15:44] offered he needed i asked him i said how
[15:46] much do you need did you need for to to
[15:48] build a little room he said uh he told
[15:50] me the amount which would be which would
[15:52] equal to about three thousand dollars so
[15:55] we gave him 1600 uh right there on the
[15:59] spot
[16:00] and and he got to start it he got to
[16:02] working right away next
[16:08] so this is another
[16:11] a picture of that that area next
[16:15] and this is what they've built now
[16:17] within the last two week two or three
[16:19] weeks
[16:20] [Applause]
[16:25] so
[16:27] we gave him the 1600 and um
[16:30] we're probably maybe uh
[16:32] uh
[16:33] i'm trying to see if we could get the
[16:35] the other sixteen hundred to
[16:37] not sixteen hundred thirteen hundred
[16:39] something like that and the other
[16:40] thirteen hundred so that they could
[16:42] finish the roof to the to the to the
[16:45] place so you all pray about that if you
[16:47] wanna
[16:48] help help with that so that way we can
[16:50] finish this room for them but uh he was
[16:52] praying and he was just so thankful to
[16:54] the lord he wasn't expecting that and i
[16:56] said well brother cornelia i said listen
[16:59] you won't know unless you ask
[17:01] the bible says ask and you shall receive
[17:04] you see if you don't seek you won't find
[17:07] so
[17:07] he was just very humble and so
[17:10] that's what they've gotten done so far
[17:12] next
[17:14] and he's been
[17:16] deposited
[17:19] he's been just updating me with with
[17:21] what they've been doing and
[17:23] so
[17:24] really really wonderful
[17:26] all right so that night this is brother
[17:28] robert's church that the brother brother
[17:30] eric's father-in-law and we had service
[17:32] there that night
[17:34] and um
[17:35] and so this is just a little bit of
[17:39] turn it up a little bit
[17:42] so there was about maybe two or three
[17:44] churches that came to
[17:46] to the service as well
[17:47] for mother from other areas
[17:50] next
[17:51] [Music]
[17:52] all right next
[17:59] all right next
[18:02] next
[18:07] this is some of the chur one of the
[18:09] churches
[18:10] they're leaving
[18:12] and
[18:12] packing the truck
[18:21] the 11d
[18:23] god bless you that means god bless
[18:26] all right this is brother robert this is
[18:27] this is eric's little boy
[18:30] i just thought that picture was cute so
[18:32] i put him in there he's a he's a fine
[18:34] looking young boy next
[18:37] all right so from there we went the
[18:38] following day we went to uh el banquito
[18:42] uh which was about an hour or so away
[18:44] from from where we were at uh where the
[18:47] church you just now saw and
[18:49] this is this is brother emeterio brother
[18:52] hemeterio he's one of the oldest
[18:54] pastors there in in
[18:57] at the first church message church that
[18:59] was founded there in honduras
[19:02] and uh
[19:03] and so brother amethedio i believe he is
[19:05] he's in his 80s if i'm not mistaken
[19:08] mid mid 80s
[19:10] it doesn't look like it though
[19:12] and
[19:13] so we had service there he has a really
[19:15] nice church
[19:18] and
[19:20] so this
[19:20] in this area in el tambor it was where
[19:23] the message was first taken to honduras
[19:26] from this place it's been spread
[19:28] throughout throughout all a lot of
[19:30] places in honduras
[19:34] [Music]
[19:35] [Applause]
[19:37] and next is song service there that
[19:39] evening
[19:40] bella's playing the violin back there
[19:42] [Applause]
[19:45] okay next
[19:51] all right next
[19:53] okay so this is one of the little young
[19:55] sisters after the service
[19:58] next
[19:59] all right and then then one of the
[20:01] brothers they invited us to eat at their
[20:03] home
[20:04] so
[20:05] um we are that they're at their home
[20:08] here with this brother emitted and
[20:12] there's zoe
[20:14] with
[20:15] the little girl
[20:17] then afterwards this is at their home
[20:19] the brother they invited us is him right
[20:21] here and he asked if we could pray for
[20:24] his family and pray for his home and so
[20:28] this this area right here has a lot of
[20:30] people that that live here in the united
[20:32] states they got family relatives in
[20:34] florida virginia maryland tennessee as a
[20:38] matter of fact
[20:39] if some of you know who brother danny
[20:40] taurus is from tennessee
[20:43] uh this is
[20:44] this is brother danny
[20:46] brother emeterio the older brother the
[20:48] pastor that that's brother danny torres
[20:50] is a father-in-law
[20:52] so
[20:54] next now this is the brother and i
[20:57] really i could not remember his name but
[20:58] this is the brother that took the
[21:00] message
[21:01] to honduras now it went i believe it was
[21:05] in the is it was in the 60s if i'm not
[21:08] mistaken or 70 something like that
[21:10] but um
[21:14] actually it might have been earlier than
[21:15] that but it wasn't really it was he was
[21:17] it was transitioning he was a
[21:19] pentecostal but believed in brother
[21:21] branham and had heard brother branham
[21:24] and uh took took that uh baptism in the
[21:26] name of lord jesus christ to this area
[21:28] and from there others started going
[21:31] coming to the area and they
[21:33] they preached was preaching the message
[21:35] to them so
[21:37] all right and so here this is brother
[21:40] hob and the reason why i have him here
[21:42] he was taking the pictures but the hub
[21:44] is from another area in honduras and he
[21:46] wanted to go on this trip with us
[21:48] to the other side of honduras where we
[21:50] were at and and so the following day
[21:53] next
[21:55] he asked if we could go pre uh pray for
[21:58] his grandmother who was in the hospital
[22:00] sick in the in the local area so we we
[22:03] we went and prayed for her she's not
[22:04] she's not a believer
[22:06] from what i understand just a catholic
[22:08] lady but she was really really touched
[22:11] by the fact that some random person when
[22:14] wanted to go to the hospital and pray
[22:15] for us so
[22:17] so that's what we did and uh
[22:20] she was feeling much better by the by
[22:21] the when when we left there so
[22:24] thank
[22:24] god all right so
[22:27] uh that evening we uh
[22:30] we had service in another area
[22:32] uh called el triunfo and in el triunfo
[22:36] they planned for us to be there
[22:39] the whole place was packed out and there
[22:41] was about three more churches outside of
[22:43] the uh
[22:44] outside
[22:45] of the building so there was about maybe
[22:48] six churches all together and this and
[22:49] this
[22:50] so
[22:51] we really really had a good time there
[22:53] that that evening it was hot but
[22:57] we uh i really enjoyed myself preaching
[22:59] that that that evening
[23:01] there's bellins as christine singing a
[23:03] special
[23:05] let y'all watch this here for a moment
[23:27] me
[23:28] [Music]
[23:38] all right next
[23:39] [Music]
[23:41] okay next
[23:54] all right afterwards we had uh we had a
[23:56] prayer line
[23:58] and so
[23:59] everybody coming up coming up for prayer
[24:01] we also gave gave out the uh the
[24:04] handkerchiefs
[24:05] and uh
[24:08] there was something that here when we
[24:09] were giving out the handkerchiefs and
[24:11] and the brother
[24:13] the brother right here he's he's a young
[24:15] brother he's stepping in because the
[24:17] pastor of the church here he's
[24:19] he's uh he's very sick and he's he's got
[24:23] diabetes and i think i believe they cut
[24:25] some of his toes off
[24:27] and so he really can't
[24:29] stand and and minister so he's
[24:33] he's
[24:34] pretty much taken over right now and uh
[24:37] but when i when i told him about the the
[24:39] the the little handkerchiefs
[24:42] and it was like it was like all almost
[24:44] all of them just wanted to wanted just
[24:46] wanted one and so we we tried to give as
[24:49] many as we could and then we i just gave
[24:51] the rest to the brother and i said at
[24:52] another time just give it give it to him
[24:55] next
[24:58] and this is afterwards we had some
[24:59] fellowship outside
[25:01] next
[25:04] this is one of the buses that had come
[25:07] for the service that day that evening
[25:10] um
[25:12] i believe maybe there was maybe three
[25:14] churches in there
[25:18] all right
[25:19] and then this is the pastor there at the
[25:21] church
[25:22] and um
[25:24] he's he's
[25:26] he's a he he fellowships he's in his
[25:29] right mind and everything is just that
[25:31] he's
[25:32] he's gotten much older now and
[25:34] he's not really able to minister anymore
[25:36] next
[25:38] all right so that evening that was um
[25:41] that was on
[25:42] uh let's see when that was that was on
[25:44] the 30th right
[25:46] it was like january it was december 30th
[25:48] when we were there's uh
[25:50] so

[26:01] hours away about four almost five hours
[26:04] away that same evening we needed to be
[26:06] back uh there
[26:09] and uh so
[26:10] this is us just stopping and getting us
[26:12] getting us some snacks and it was
[26:14] probably what it was like one in the
[26:16] morning there
[26:17] next
[26:19] all right so the following day we um
[26:22] while we were there in choluteka where
[26:23] we were ministering to those churches we
[26:26] had bought brother eric's
[26:28] wife a a tin where she could have some

[26:57] wife and and and her mother-in-law they
[26:59] they sell tortillas in this place

[27:07] and they helped support themselves and
[27:10] so bella was there helping them they
[27:12] also they also

[28:26] had some fellowship afterwards
[28:29] next
[28:30] here's some of the young people from
[28:31] brother eric's church
[28:34] next
[28:35] all right this little girl right here um
[28:40] is her name when i was
[28:43] eating there at one of the tables she
[28:45] asked me she said
[28:49] she said how does it feel to have a dad
[28:53] and it was just a random question
[28:55] and i said
[28:57] well um
[28:58] you know it's a wonderful feeling to you
[29:00] know and i was just kind of talking to
[29:01] her
[29:02] and so she would she came to my wife and
[29:05] was asking her the same you know kind of
[29:06] the same things
[29:08] come to find out she told us the story
[29:10] she said that she had seen her dad
[29:13] uh when she was younger she's 10 11
[29:16] 9.
[29:18] when she was younger she saw her dad
[29:20] laying on the on the street he got shot
[29:23] he got killed
[29:25] and so he she didn't know what had
[29:26] happened to him
[29:28] and so she lost her her father at a very
[29:30] young age
[29:31] so she's she has this this uh i'd ask
[29:34] that you all pray for her because she
[29:35] has this thing that's really
[29:37] it's bothering her for her not to have a
[29:39] dad she's grown up without a dad
[29:42] and uh
[29:43] my wife was able to
[29:45] minister to her in the way because she's
[29:48] lost her father
[29:50] so
[29:51] and so they they uh
[29:53] my wife christine really connected with
[29:56] with her so
[29:57] just remember her and your prayers
[29:59] next
[30:01] all right so the following day after we
[30:03] had uh had that watch night service
[30:06] um
[30:07] we got to bed maybe a while two in the
[30:10] morning we only got maybe like one hour
[30:12] of sleep and uh had to leave out about
[30:15] three three thirty in the morning
[30:18] back to the other side of of of honduras
[30:21] where we were where we were preaching

[30:25] where the border
[30:26] to honduras and nicaragua uh the best
[30:29] place to to get

[30:47] out
[30:49] they they they're gonna try to take as
[30:50] much money from you as possible
[30:52] so
[30:53] next
[30:55] um
[30:56] just kind of pointing out where we were
[30:57] we were kind of around right here now
[31:00] next
[31:01] so
[31:03] it was that zoe yes with only less than
[31:06] maybe
[31:07] no sleep she had not gotten sleep that
[31:09] that that morning that's us trying to
[31:11] cross over next
[31:16] this is my face trying to deal with
[31:17] these guys
[31:18] [Laughter]
[31:22] and uh
[31:23] because they tell you one thing they say
[31:26] listen i'll take your things we'll cross
[31:28] over to the border to nicaragua and for
[31:31] a certain price and when you get there
[31:33] they start quoting you another price and
[31:36] i said wait a second no you told me this
[31:38] price
[31:40] and so
[31:41] and when you when you
[31:43] you know call them out they're like okay
[31:45] yeah yeah you're right
[31:47] next
[31:50] this is us
[31:52] this is me and bella
[31:56] and uh usually uh since this was january
[31:59] the first
[32:00] uh usually it's uh there's more traffic
[32:03] going on more going on but uh
[32:06] hardly anybody was was awake that that
[32:09] morning
[32:10] everybody had partied and drunk the the
[32:12] the night before so there was
[32:15] we easily got through it was just very
[32:17] hot this is right here at the border of
[32:19] honduras and nicaragua
[32:22] next
[32:24] i just wanted it was so laid back this
[32:26] is at the that the uh uh immigration in
[32:29] nicaragua that you know
[32:31] they
[32:32] they have you know don't use your cell
[32:34] phone they have you know
[32:37] things they don't use your cell phone
[32:38] and i was using my cell phone and
[32:40] it was before i had seen the sign
[32:43] christine pointed that out
[32:44] [Laughter]
[32:48] but they had they had told me they had
[32:50] told uh
[32:51] they had
[32:52] when we were here crossing the border
[32:54] they they were looking at me kind of
[32:57] strange because i was here i was walking
[32:59] with with
[33:00] three girls
[33:02] mine and they look like miners because
[33:04] christine you know looks just like she's
[33:06] my daughter
[33:07] so they're looking at me strange and
[33:09] they're asking me who are who is this i
[33:11] said that's my wife
[33:13] and then when they would see it in the
[33:14] passport okay
[33:16] they thought i was smuggling children
[33:18] over across the border
[33:23] but
[33:25] after all that we got through just fine
[33:27] brother neil's son um well you'll see
[33:29] here in a little bit brother nilsson and
[33:31] brother giovanni who's his brother he's
[33:33] the pastor but nielson is the pastor
[33:35] here in china
[33:37] nicaragua this is now nicaragua
[33:39] and this is the his church here so the
[33:42] following day after we crossed over we
[33:44] had service here next
[33:48] this is a
[33:50] song service
[33:53] my brother nielsen's church
[33:55] [Music]
[34:02] they have some excellent musicians here
[34:04] at this church next that's brother
[34:06] nielsen's wife by the way who was
[34:07] playing there with with with bella
[34:11] this is the church where my wife was
[34:13] saying that she testified last sunday
[34:15] where she
[34:16] had that heat stroke
[34:18] it doesn't look hot but it was hot
[34:21] and they told us that that day when i
[34:24] was preaching there and i wasn't feeling
[34:26] well i was already coming down with
[34:27] something because from here we were
[34:30] getting ready to go uh to the it was
[34:32] when we were going to go to the to the
[34:34] jungles
[34:35] uh about a day or two later but that got
[34:37] delayed and that that we didn't end up
[34:39] going to that because several people
[34:41] were sick including me
[34:42] and but i believe it was the will of the
[34:44] lord for us not to go but um
[34:48] they said that that day when we preached
[34:50] there it was the hottest that they had
[34:52] ever seen
[34:53] been in the church
[34:55] and i preached there several times but
[34:58] didn't see it any different from any
[34:59] other time but they said it was the
[35:01] hottest so so i guess it affected
[35:03] christine
[35:04] next
[35:07] [Music]
[35:12] all right this is
[35:14] just
[35:15] you could turn it up a little bit
[35:18] a little taste of
[35:20] some of the streets of chinandega
[35:22] nicaragua
[35:23] [Music]
[35:25] and the activity that goes on
[35:28] we're parked
[35:31] we're parked right here next to a car
[35:36] so we're like taking up a bunch of space
[35:40] we're creating traffic we're yeah we're
[35:41] creating tracks
[35:48] here comes a horse
[35:51] bicycles everything
[35:53] [Music]
[35:58] and no one's upset nobody's honking
[36:02] no life goes on
[36:04] next
[36:06] all right
[36:07] this is kind of good idea a little
[36:09] traffic chinondega is a very nice little
[36:11] little city kind of town town but it
[36:13] gets busy
[36:15] all right so so since we didn't end up
[36:17] this is brother nielsen by the way and
[36:19] since we didn't end up going to um
[36:24] which is on the west coast on the east
[36:26] coast of nicaragua
[36:31] we had to cancel that for several people
[36:33] were sick including the interpreter that
[36:35] was going to go over there to interpret
[36:37] because over there in that area they
[36:39] have their own dialect
[36:41] and so you have to have you can preach
[36:42] in spanish but you have to have uh
[36:45] somebody interpreting into their dialect
[36:47] and the interpreter was sick himself so
[36:49] we i told brother nilson i said bro
[36:51] nielsen it's probably not the will for
[36:53] us to go not the will of the lord for us
[36:55] to go so we didn't go
[36:57] but we ended up uh scheduling um setting
[37:00] up to visit other places that needed to
[37:03] be visited as well and when brother
[37:05] nielsen was setting up those places i
[37:07] mean they just they were just coming up
[37:09] like that you know like so we knew that
[37:12] it was this that's where the lord was
[37:13] leading us
[37:14] so this is us heading to one of the
[37:16] places right here this is we're heading
[37:17] to monchones nicaragua next and it's a
[37:20] mountainous area
[37:22] and um
[37:24] just beautiful next
[37:28] next
[37:30] all right so we visited bro uh
[37:32] brother um
[37:34] beset i forgot the brother's name now
[37:38] uh but this is his church
[37:40] and the brother he's an older brother he
[37:42] he uh
[37:44] he uh he's been
[37:45] he's the one who pretty much evangelized
[37:48] this whole area that whole mountain air
[37:50] plays there since the 70s when he came
[37:53] he came he heard the message in 1976 if
[37:56] i'm not mistaken
[37:57] next
[38:00] and this is his this is his little
[38:01] church right there
[38:03] and so we started having survey we had
[38:04] about three three day service there from
[38:07] uh friday saturday and sunday next
[38:12] this is some of the sisters from there
[38:14] in that
[38:15] area next
[38:17] this is the this is the pastor there
[38:19] brother
[38:20] the brother and uh
[38:22] he he had not spoken in a while but that
[38:24] evening he wanted to just kind of
[38:26] testify and give and and just let the
[38:29] congregation know and just we really
[38:32] enjoyed it
[38:33] next
[38:36] so afterwards we we had uh this is some
[38:39] of the church age books that some of the
[38:42] brethren uh
[38:43] brother george smith and them had
[38:44] provided uh to them and we had taken
[38:47] them over to them
[38:49] in this area and uh we gave we gave gave
[38:52] them out and uh
[38:54] so there was a picture of them receiving
[38:56] it next
[38:59] this is the pastor here and uh
[39:01] just it's real real wonderful to hear
[39:04] you know his testimony of how the lord
[39:06] dealt with him and
[39:07] you know by the lord dealing with him
[39:09] and and what he did you know there's a
[39:12] church and several churches in other
[39:13] places around the region as well next
[39:18] all right this is the this is the
[39:19] pastor's son
[39:21] and so we this is uh the day when we
[39:23] were heading back to another area called
[39:25] plan de grama which was about another
[39:28] about an hour and 20 minutes
[39:31] from from where we were at right here in
[39:32] monchones next
[39:37] and this is the church here in plan de
[39:38] grama
[39:39] this is the pastor there the grammar he
[39:41] prayed for the brother
[39:45] the brother he
[39:46] [Music]
[39:47] he he had a fall
[39:48] [Music]
[39:50] about a year or so ago
[39:54] also had coveted
[39:55] and something with that fall
[39:58] caused him
[39:59] uh to um
[40:02] it messed him and messed him up in in
[40:05] his head
[40:06] mentally uh he hit his he hit the side
[40:08] of his face and so whenever he would get
[40:12] up to preach to minister
[40:14] he would always just minister the same
[40:16] thing over and over and over and they
[40:18] knew something was something was wrong
[40:20] and so
[40:21] whenever you talk with him whenever he
[40:22] talks to you he always talks to you
[40:24] about the same subject
[40:26] and it's like he's never you know so
[40:28] y'all just remember the brother and
[40:30] prayer he knows something's wrong and
[40:32] and and so
[40:34] just difficult things that churches are
[40:36] going through as well you know
[40:39] amen uh this is a ministering there that
[40:42] one of those evenings and then this is
[40:44] some of the
[40:45] people there at
[40:47] the church next
[40:50] you turn it up a little bit we just got
[40:52] through service
[40:54] and getting ready to
[40:56] go to
[40:57] a little place called plantagramma
[40:59] brother you say yes you're next to me by
[41:01] the name son
[41:04] brother
[41:18] and his wife back there we got for the
[41:20] island
[41:22] back there
[41:30] i forget all these people's names
[41:33] i can't remember names
[41:36] i'll remember faces all day long but i
[41:38] just names i just they slipped me
[41:41] all right so after after we we just had
[41:44] wonderful services there that could tell
[41:46] you all different testimonies there when
[41:48] we were there in monchones plan de
[41:49] gramma
[41:52] and
[41:53] but afterwards uh this is uh back in in
[41:57] in
[41:58] in
[41:58] this area right here is
[42:01] is a uh
[42:03] is a piece of land that about two years
[42:05] ago i had requested uh if
[42:08] some of you brethren could help pay for
[42:10] the for actually no it was just recently
[42:12] this is the piece of land
[42:14] that we helped pay uh where they're

[52:29] um

[52:33] the island or we were getting ready to
[52:34] leave i can't remember exactly but we
[52:37] were we were heading back now next
[52:40] and that morning um is when we were
[52:43] gonna cross over
[52:45] into costa rica
[52:47] next
[52:49] and uh this is me taking a little nap
[52:52] on the ship on the boat because from the
[52:55] island to the mainland it was about an
[52:58] hour or hour or so and so
[53:01] this is me taking a little nap next
[53:04] all right so this is us here at the
[53:06] border of nicaragua and and and costa
[53:09] rica now we're getting ready to cross
[53:10] over
[53:11] next
[53:13] now this is us crossing over
[53:19] so now
[53:20] we are
[53:21] we are right here
[53:24] where we crossed over
[53:27] next
[53:29] all right and then we met up with
[53:30] brother eric check on
[53:32] brother eric chacon who's the pastor
[53:34] there who was going to receive us in
[53:35] grecia
[53:36] uh uh costa rica he picked us up met us
[53:39] there at the border from where he lives
[53:42] in grecia to the border there uh it's
[53:45] it's about
[53:47] four hours
[53:48] four hours so he picked us up and we
[53:50] went to go visit brother daniel vado who
[53:53] is one of the pastors there
[53:56] there in costa rica he's more closer to
[53:59] the coast there next
[54:01] this is uh us in that in that re region
[54:03] where brother daniel vado's church is in
[54:06] guanacaste costa rica
[54:08] next so that evening we had service here
[54:11] and this is brother daniel's uh uh
[54:14] church daniel vado i didn't have a
[54:16] picture here of him but he has a
[54:18] powerful testimony he the um
[54:22] he uh
[54:24] he was suffering with cancer if i'm not
[54:26] mistaken and the lord healed him from
[54:28] that i mean he was he was to the point
[54:30] of death and he tells us amazing
[54:32] testimony of things that he saw
[54:34] people coming in the room and and and
[54:37] just supernatural things that took place
[54:39] while he was the lord raised them up and
[54:41] he's he's pastoring the church
[54:43] and uh just a wonderful testimony that
[54:46] he had but that's just kind of it in a
[54:48] nutshell um
[54:50] that evening we we when we preached
[54:51] there there was two young men who were
[54:53] who were just recently coming to the
[54:55] church and you know as a minister
[54:57] sometimes you you don't know what you're
[54:59] going to preach and so you kind of turn
[55:01] back maybe to some previous notes that
[55:03] you've had and maybe the lord is leading
[55:05] you to them so i i did that and i i
[55:08] ministered that evening and i ministered
[55:11] on eating eating the lamb
[55:13] and uh
[55:14] and it really touched their hearts
[55:16] because they were they were on the fence
[55:18] about getting baptized
[55:20] and uh and about what the new birth was
[55:23] was was about and and you know and uh
[55:26] they told brother daniel bado the pastor
[55:28] there they text messaged him the the uh
[55:31] or that evening one of them said that
[55:33] they wanted to get baptized and that the
[55:35] next day
[55:36] and so um
[55:38] but they he could not get he didn't the
[55:40] next day when the next day rolled around
[55:42] he decided not to only because when he
[55:45] told his mother who was a staunch
[55:47] catholic who was a staunch catholic that
[55:49] he was going to go do that
[55:51] she really got upset with him so
[55:54] he he held off but was going to get
[55:58] baptized at a later time and i believe
[56:00] brother daniel he's sending me some
[56:02] pictures i believe he did get baptized
[56:05] and the other young man who
[56:07] who he got baptized as well
[56:09] so
[56:10] at least we planted the seed somebody
[56:12] else did the work amen but the seed was
[56:14] planted there and
[56:16] god does the increase amen
[56:18] next
[56:20] this is this is brother daniel the the
[56:22] pastor there this is at the church
[56:27] in costa rica they're very more strict
[56:29] in regards to to following the covet
[56:32] guidelines and so
[56:34] that's why you see a lot of the spacing
[56:36] and the masking
[56:38] next
[56:40] and this is
[56:42] one of the places there near the church
[56:45] they they're just right there right off
[56:46] the coast
[56:47] and um
[56:50] and i just couldn't help myself i i told
[56:52] my wife i said i'm just gonna just i'm
[56:54] just gonna dip my feet in the water and
[56:56] me and zoe
[56:58] you know because zoe
[56:59] wanted to get in the water and it ended
[57:02] up being
[57:04] everything was in the water after
[57:07] and then zoe was like
[57:09] zoey said
[57:10] papi are you really
[57:12] okay
[57:14] she got in it
[57:16] and so
[57:17] yeah next
[57:20] next
[57:22] all right so
[57:24] afterwards we uh after we visited
[57:26] brother daniel we drove for uh four
[57:29] hours back to gracia
[57:31] uh uh costa rica and this is where the
[57:34] eric chacon's church the brother that
[57:36] picked us up from the from the
[57:38] border and
[57:40] this is us having service
[57:43] sunday morning next
[57:49] so what they did is
[57:51] in order to keep the guidelines covered
[57:53] guidelines they they would just
[57:56] keep uh families together you know and
[57:59] and and
[58:02] so this is this is his church there next
[58:06] this is just right outside of his church

[58:26] the way
[58:28] i was like
[58:30] i was like yes

[1:00:08] i noticed
[1:00:09] the ground was moving
[1:00:12] and when we looked down it was just
[1:00:14] trails of ants
[1:00:16] everywhere and i'm talking about some
[1:00:18] big ants

[1:01:17] well we can turn on the lights
[1:01:20] [Applause]
[1:01:25] yeah
[1:01:28] there are so many details and things we
[1:01:30] could go through but would we we'd have
[1:01:32] two weeks worth of presentations i know
[1:01:35] maybe some of the young people some of
[1:01:37] the kids would like that but
[1:01:40] but uh yeah i appreciate each one of you
[1:01:43] and and uh
[1:01:44] i tell you what you know and i encourage
[1:01:46] you know our young people encourage
[1:01:48] anyone that you know
[1:01:50] if we ever make a trip out there and if
[1:01:52] you really feel pressed on your heart
[1:01:54] you know to
[1:01:55] to to come with us we we'd be more than
[1:01:57] glad to have you with us especially
[1:01:59] young or young people i think if you get
[1:02:02] an experience like that you know you
[1:02:04] come back appreciating what you have
[1:02:06] here more and appreciate things a little
[1:02:09] bit better and see things maybe in a
[1:02:11] different way and so um
[1:02:14] it was just it's just wonderful to be
[1:02:16] to see other people who are pressing on
[1:02:19] just like you are and i would always
[1:02:21] tell them listen we're battling over
[1:02:23] there in the states the same devil that
[1:02:25] you all are battling
[1:02:27] it's the same devil i mean they have
[1:02:28] difficulties but i tell them but the
[1:02:31] devil up there is the same devils
[1:02:33] they're just a little bit more
[1:02:34] sophisticated the ones we have we battle
[1:02:37] here
[1:02:38] they hide themselves a little bit better
[1:02:40] over there they're just plain you know
[1:02:44] yeah
[1:02:44] and so but you pray for those people
[1:02:46] there and pray that the lord would
[1:02:49] continue doing the works

[1:03:13] i'm gonna have the musicians come
[1:03:18] by the way do we have anything
[1:03:20] we need to mention
[1:03:22] just remember brother richard hi he'll

[1:03:33] the brothers down there they asked me
[1:03:34] when are you coming back i mean it's
[1:03:36] just like you just left even before you
[1:03:38] leave when are you coming back
[1:03:42] so you all pray for us we don't know we
[1:03:44] don't know
[1:03:45] what will happen from now until then but
[1:03:48] uh
[1:03:49] if the lord has us to be there again
[1:03:50] we'll we'll be there
[1:03:52] um maybe next time around we'll be able
[1:03:55] to visit those jungle areas where we
[1:03:57] didn't get to go last time who knows why
[1:03:59] we didn't get to go it was just very
[1:04:01] interesting that we had we had already
[1:04:03] planned for six months to go to that
[1:04:05] place
[1:04:07] and in in a day
[1:04:09] it was
[1:04:11] every i was sick
[1:04:12] brother nielsen was sick the interpreter
[1:04:14] brother was sick his brother nielsen's
[1:04:17] dad had gotten sick and had was taken to
[1:04:19] the hospital and so brother nielsen
[1:04:21] didn't want to be 12 hours away from
[1:04:24] where his his dad was at and his dad
[1:04:26] already worries when he goes to those
[1:04:28] places so it just really didn't pan out
[1:04:31] but
[1:04:31] but you see if if we had not if if if we
[1:04:35] had gone then that maybe that young
[1:04:36] sister who who accepted the lord would
[1:04:39] not have accepted the lord so it's just
[1:04:41] the lord does things and he understand
[1:04:43] we
[1:04:43] we don't know we don't know why but uh
[1:04:46] he has he knows all the details the ins
[1:04:49] and outs and we just want to obey
