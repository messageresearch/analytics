to they don't know they're getting ready to get married yet but maybe the Lord revealed to them that they're going to get married or that we'll talk about that t this afternoon on choosing a spouse and that's going to be a little a little awkward but still we got to realize that um the old saying is and it's just a good saying is if you don't plan then your plan will always fail yeah if you fail the plan your plan will always fail cuz you don't make a plan you're going to fail right you say well this is too much like like school well you know what the only way that God got to us was to send us prophets right teachers men to teach us what do you think they teaching us right they're teaching us the way the plan didn't is it called The Plan of Redemption amen amen called The Plan of Redemption so let's don't be so hard on say well we need to plan you need to plan everything right you know it's a lot better to plan things like we're planning all these things here that uh that Terence is is telling us it's a surprise if we don't plan but if we plan it's never a surprise right all right so let's go through the list here and while we're standing brother Dale's birthday we know after second service today he'll be 72 tomorrow so we're going to have a little cake and ice cream for him downstairs also remember that in May the fellowship meeting is brother is at brother pageant's Church on May the 19th I believe it is uh May the 12th and 13th June and I will be at Brother Richard Wilson May the 25th through the 28th we will be in Kansas now my plans have changed a little bit I all of you that want to go welcome to go but you're going to be driving back alone I'm going to be um speaking for brother Pinkston on Wednesday after the Memorial Day and then stay in the rest of the week brother Claude asked me to be with them that next weekend so we're just going to stay in Kansas for about a week but that's not going to change any plans of driving out and driving back we'll just fly back it's not a problem at all doesn't bother me we got a lot of free miles we got to use so we're going to use them maybe if the Lord's willing that's what we're going to do then in June 14 15 16 remember the Father's Day third annual camping trip you know how we really enjoy that just remember that and keep that in your mind amen all right announced last week this is tentative for those of you that want to have a financial peace class after the second service starting at about 5:00 it lasts for 2 hours maybe we will start on July the 15th and it'll go to September the 16th so if you're interested in that we will have at second service after downstairs we'll put up a screen and all that and do it down there we will not be doing it up here I like to keep the sanctuary for the services of the Lord amen and we need to talk about finances like I said about a plan everybody needs a plan you need a plan for your family you need a plan for your spouse you need a plan for your finances cuz if you don't old saying is a fool and his money is what soon departed all right so let's don't be foolish with our money if we do then it'll depart Genesis 1:26-27 let's bow our heads before we get started oh remember Jim we had a situation yesterday last night with Hannah so just remember her she'll be here in a little bit so no big deal just something we have to deal with and the family all right so that's where she is right now so let's bow our heads de Heavenly Father we pray Lord that you would just be with us we know Lord that you said you'd never leave us or forsake us that you'd always be there when we need you the father we pray Lord that you're not sitting out somewhere on a cloud or or off in the in the eternities but you're you're right here with us Lord You're an never presentent help in a time of trouble is brother collie was saying Lord with you stand there with your hand out stretched and sometimes we we don't take it but Lord I pray that we would all take that extended hand today Lord the extended hand of the mighty word of God that we're going to read Lord and go through and listen to what your Prophet had to say about planning for a family and having a family unit father the the very words in your Bible the very words in your Eternal thoughts were for us to be a family amen father we pray now that you just be with us and bless us keep us safe thank you for blessing the ones in Oklahoma and Kansas the Believers out there Lord that you you just move those storms out of the way Lord yes Lord you're just so good to us you're so good to us until we uh it'll take an eternity for us to thank you for all the things that you've done Lord I Thank you Lord for your blessings ask you just be with us today bless our pastors getting you're older Lord that you just keep him strong Lord just build him up in strength be with each one of us Lord sanctify us sanctify the word that we're going to read Lord to our hearts the word's already blessed and Sanctified but Lord may it be blessed and Sanctified and quickened to our hearts and our life father we pray that you would just be with us be with the sick that's among us and not with us you said you sent your word and healed the people and delivered them from their destruction father so as the word Goes Forth we pray that you would just manifest yourself Lord bless us today and be with us in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen Genesis 1:26 and 27 and God said let us make man in our image now see this is let us make man right go let us make man now my question is is why didn't God just keep creating from the dust like he did Adam he wouldn't have been a father he needed a family he wanted a family a family unit listen God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them amen now there's the there's the foundation for the family them right not God right them he gives them a charge right to multiply see and let them have dominion over the fish of the Sea and the foul of the air and over cattle and over all the earth look what he's given this unit over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created in him male and female cre created he them now I'm going to read 28 and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and it's not up there I forgot to put it on there and replenish the Earth amen multiply and replenish the Earth be fruitful so he's giving them a charge whoever they were in Genesis 1 he was giving them a charge to multiply and replenish the Earth subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the Sea and the foul of the air and every living creature and that moveth upon the earth now let's go to Genesis 9 verse 1 this is after the destruction the first thing God tells Noah when he comes out of the ark Noah Builds an ark sacrifices to the Lord told him that the imagination of men's Hearts was evil from his youth that's the ones that died in the flood and God blessed Noah his sons and said unto them be fruit and multiply and replenish the Earth you may be see it the Lord his Blessing now remember last Sunday we talked about the spiritual multiplication of a family how God was going to what he was going to create his own generation right all right because he was cut off from among the land of the living last Sunday right right from his generation he was going to be cut off his genealogy was going to be cut off but you and I are the ones that makes this generation continue on when we get the new birth and God bursts his own life in us we become children of the almighty amen all right we become children of God and today I want you to realize now that that was given the charge was given to you and I to multiply and replenish the Earth amen not God right he gave the charge to us amen he didn't say I'm going to multiply we know he is we know he's the author but he's G you and I something to do with he told them to multiply see therefore now he's G us something to do amen so now we got something to do with it he's not just the almighty sure he's the almighty God but he wanted a family he wanted children amen he wanted somebody to worship Him God's intentions were from the beginning to bring children into this world Amen spoken word not by saxs but spoken word and woman was created to bring forth those children amen she wasn't just to help me just to be there right right no that was a man with a womb Adam didn't have a womb right Eve had a womb when she come out from Adam she was woman all right and I like U brother Daniel and Brother Joseph I can't I think last Sunday got everybody to kind of thinking about things which is good cuz if you really pulled apart everything that happened in the Garden of Eden right there in the beginning of time in the Book of Genesis you spend an eternity talking about the the little details that happened during the during the time but but I I like what brother Daniel said and I kind of was thinking on the same thing that you said well why didn't Adam just have Eve destroyed and start over with what exactly right that's right the feminist part of he would have had to created another Adam to take a feminine Spirit out of but he didn't say that see that's part of what I was talking about last Sunday and then now God didn't do that that will be this complimentary to God having a family right he created out ad and said you do it right cuz when he gives us a new birth he says you do it amen I'm going to do it through you but you're going to do it you got something to do with that so he couldn't have took another Eve out of Adam he'd already took the woman the feminine Spirit out of out of Adam so there's no way that he could have got rid of Eve without God killing both of them right right so she was protected because of him right and then he protected his genealogy just like we said by doing what he did he finished you went on and did what he was doing and he knew what he was doing Adam was not dumb right Adam was a Son of God he was Christ on the earth he had the mind of Christ right he didn't have a a muddled up mind like me and you got cuz he wasn't born in sin shaping iniquity spous on our mother's womb he didn't have two persons or two or old Adam and new Adam in him he was just Adam but what he done was is to to protect his genealogy but also to make sure that Eve wasn't killed because he would had to took Moses yeah if he' to kill the children of Israel yeah right go back to our types Moses type Christ God couldn't kill Israel because of Moses right so God couldn't kill Eve because of Adam standing there he never took care of both of them and started all over again that's what not what he said he said you do it you multiply you replenish the Earth so now let's go to Genesis 2 brother Anderson's flying solo back there so brother Joe's up here in the front which is good I like that Genesis 2: 23-24 and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman not Eve woman why because she was going to reproduce Adam remember we read in Genesis 5 there where says that their name were Adam their name was Adam right she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife wife yeah like brother Dale was talking about not not mistress or shck up his wife all right and they shall be one flesh you can't truly be one flesh unless you're born again right we know that you cannot truly be born again and that's what we're going to talk about this afternoon excuse me with some of the the young uh gentlemen and ladies that are that are looking for a mate brother B says do not marry unbelievers cuz you'll always have problems right now let's go to Genesis 3 16 unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee now we already covered this in the woman part and in the double Covenant part this is where the double Covenant part comes in where she has to now be ruled over but he didn't do away with the having baby thing right you shall bring forth children in sorrow you'll bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and then the generations of of Adam begun and we see the same thing with you and I that when we to get married and have family we too should become one flesh and we should prepare ourselves for having a family now if you don't have children then I don't ask I don't know I don't know but I'm just telling you what the Bible said the Bible said that God made us to have family all right he made a woman to have a baby by all right so there's no way around that there's no way getting through it or about it sisters you're the only ones and I've always said us men if we ever were supposed to birth children we would have had just one we would have never had another one right so yall are designed to do that you're designed to to Bear children that's why God wanted spoken word children he wanted children to be born right but he wanted to be done by the spoken word but since Satan came in and did what he did caused Eve to do what she did that caused God to like I said last Sunday bring us down into permissive well God permitted now our bodies to come in by the way we we all come same way amen we all come same way everybody that's building come the same identical way all right so you know doesn't matter if if your Mom and Daddy weren't married it doesn't matter how you it doesn't matter you came the same way all right so you came the same way we all it's not a a mystery to to know that we were supposed to come this way because we did come this way and we all come the same way all right like brother Brown said it may be on a a park bench somewhere or in a flowery beautiful pink room a birth is a mess and that's the way it's supposed to come and that's the way you're going to come all right so but in preparing for a family and for a family unit listen to quote number one what brought you in the first place dust Thou Art sin crept in and we had to go we're still God will never be defeated see Satan thought he could stop a Son of God from being born he just prolonged it a little bit right all right he didn't stoping you're not going to stop God that's where the foolish part of of Satan is he thinks he can defeat God right and God's the one that made him so he's deceived and you know what he's doing he's trying to make you deceived God will never be defeated he expected this Earth to be inhabited in Isaiah about 40 or somewhere in there it says I made the Earth to be inhabited now that's the Eternal Word of God so it can't change so that's why that we had to have a Prophet come and tell us that we're not going to go live on some Cloud somewhere we're not going to go to some heaven to live God created this Earth to be inhabited Eternal so this is where we're going to live know right he expected this Earth to be inhabited so he just made woman to bring children he still pours the calcium and potach and elements into them and build them up we don't have anything to doing with building the body we just do the ACT that's right right and brother brandom said it's much more mysterious this kind of birth than it was the Immaculate Conception cuz it was one germ one EG one egg one germ one Christ us Millions thousands hundreds of thousands like I said last Sunday Generations back and forth I mean you know what I'm talking about right how'd you get here God you still didn't defeat God's purpose Satan didn't defeat he's not going to stop a Son of God from being born right Satan that is then he brings him to a place and lets you make a choice that's why you're here make a choice and if without a choice God made you one day a young man strong happy healthy the Holy Spirit not some C former theological theological SIM name Dogma but the Blessed Holy Spirit not the tree of knowledge but the Holy Spirit you see it's God's plan began to woo over you and make love to me and I accepted him now I accepted New Birth all right and then he came down into my heart and took his place that's what he wanted to start with right that's what he wanted to start with amen so God brings his plan right back to where it's supposed to be now we know he cursed this thing and didn't take the curse off right all right right actually the sin curse is not over until what totally until somebody lives a thousand years right in the Millennium okay but now we know it to us it's different we come before the Earth right all right so don't get don't you know don't bother me on that one I know we come this thing becomes Eternal before we leave here but I'm talking about everything until that future home hits its ground and Satan is totally destroyed that dude is still there he's trying his best to beat us but until the future home comes cuz he's going to be loose a little season there at the end of the Millennium like we talked about in the Bible study he's going to be Loos a little season to do what I don't know but there's one thing for sure you and I if we're bride we're going to be an eternal body right he could he could throw a a nuclear bomb down our throat and it's not going to bother us so don't worry about it don't worry about what's going to happen or what's going to take place just remember one thing if you're born again today free ride to glory amen all right all right let's go to number two wisdom versus Faith he said but listen my dear you love the little thing now this is Satan coming to eat see surely God Made You for a purpose and he did s's not lying amen you know that's right see you're a woman see he can show them the animals yeah you were made for this purpose you're a woman that's what it is you don't know it now but you were made for this purpose right oh you're a lovely little thing dear uhhuh look at those dainty little hands see why sure you will surely and he said but oh you you think that a good loving father God would do a thing like that no she said well if we do we'll die yeah what' she do she listened to reason took wisdom that's a tree Delight for one to be desired of and she fell for it now look at what underline now you see the seed that she was holding would have finally become a mother by the will of God through a spoken word amen she would have become our mother she would have finally become a mother but she couldn't wait and went into that and then what happened in the garden remember last Sunday that stopped her ability to bring me and you forth cuz her womb was polluted then and God had to do what he did and he did and we're here the way we are we can say what if if we want to but this is the way it happened right and this is the way God wanted to happen cuz God sitting there with all those attributes ready to be displayed and no way to display them right he had to let this happen all right now number three spoken words Original Seed now notice what happened to Eve's children the first one that was born now if God said multiply to his bride to Adam's bride and replenish multiply and replenish the Earth that was God's commission right and she would have done it and he would mixing themselves together by but what happened when Adam got ready to come to her she was already a mother right see what I mean same thing was Christ Church look at 79 when God give a commission which cannot perish God's word's Eternal in other words he said multiply and replenish the Earth right it cannot fail when he said multiply and replenish the Earth that was God's Eternal purpose you see that word Eternal purpose that was his eternal purpose to carry that out you cannot die because it's his word you have to live if that child had been brought forth right there had been no death but she couldn't wait right amen all right now look this this next now God's purpose for husband and wife to bring forth children we see that right I mean we' say well well we know that brother Wade well you know what I just want to make sure that the you knew the prophet knew that yeah and now you know it by his by the Bible and by the word of God we were supposed to be a family this is not just something that happened because God had to redo another plan exactly no we're going to read a little while in Christ mystery God revealed it brother Brown said this is his plan and his purpose amen this right here right this is exactly God purpos for husband and wife to bring forth children he was establishing the family cuz he told them to be fruitful multiply and replenisher so that they were what multiplying theel making a family unit amen the family is God's intended results of the marriage relationship that he established in Eden thank you Lord that's what the family is it's God's intended result of the marriage relationship that he established in Eden now let's go to number four but in Genesis 2 when he made man he said I am y a h u j u v u h Yahoo Jehovah what did it mean I am the all existing one who has created something off of myself right which is what Genesis 1 Adam put that in Adam right A Part something off of myself to be a son of mine yeah see Adam was a Son of God there was a family already right all right but Adam couldn't reproduce himself God was finished creating so he had to take a piece of Adam bring her woman or or Adam made flesh in another form right or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine Oh Glory why he gave man Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God and he made a man an amateur God right so he isn't self-existing anymore right excuse me he exists with his family amen Ella Ella Elohim now he is Jehovah Jehovah meaning the one who exists with his family so he's not going to lose that he's going to he's Jehovah he's Jehovah God all right now let's read down at the blue let's now God was made to be predominant over all the Earth he had dominion and the Earth was man's Dominion see there is that scripture that if that his domain he was God over the Earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this and it would be so there he is god Jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exists with his family and his little ones with him there you are there's no way to bring that back right see there's no way once I started having children that I it wouldn't be a family unit you say well they died off if they died if Josh and Hannah died I'm still a father I had children right God the same way he's going to always have children amen all right all right now let's go to the next one number five oness any man in his family a correct good Noble obedient family is one with another any family and if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family's broken somewhere they should all be one father with Mother Mother with father children with parent parent with children all in agreement and when you see that you'll see a lovely picture that's God's purpose you say boy my family is not that way well you know what mine's not either but I trust God enough to know that it will be in his time not my time everybody wants everything to be perfect right now but remember if it's God's purpose it'll happen right right that's God's purpose and his purpose as father Supreme was to be one with his family look Earthly family Adam and the only way they could be one with a family or with God was because God's nature was in them you both got to have the nature of God and have a real family all right amen that's what brother Brown saying which because God's nature was in them and so that made them with God's nature in them then with each other in God they became all one isn't that a beautiful picture God and his family father over all Supreme no death no sorrow no heart heartache no nothing just joy unspeakable never to be sick never to have a heartache just one with God what a picture because the very in nature of God was in these people and therefore what they did they followed just in line with God and God with them made them one now see that stopped when that happened in the garden that stopped to be fulfilled that wasn't fulfilled but it's being fulfilled now Glory God's coming right back into a group of people to fulfill every bit of that right right no death no sorrow no heart heartache no nothing never to be sick never have a headache what that's where we're going right amen that's where we're going to that's our that's our body that's our glorified body that's what we're going to but they had it in the Garden of Eden that's why I've always said this body I was thinking about it the other day um we were um went look at some hunting land and you know I had briers and all kind of stuff and I found them sticking all in me and Dad had some in him and found a tick on me too so be careful but you know this this body all the functions during that day I didn't have to stop and say feet move arm move breathe breathe breathe breathe heartbeat heartbeat no it just happened natural he's talking about when Adam and Eve were in the garden before the fall they were in a perfect condition right that they were not they were not in a fallen condition they were not eating food and doing the waste business you got it you understand what I'm saying they were perfect cuz their body absorbed their the nutrients and there was nothing left over that's our problem now we got so much perverted food got a lot of stuff left over but we're going back to where we can eat and do the same thing so see it just this just stopped a little bit of time in here like I said remember last Sunday this just broke a little bit of Eternity into time for us to do what reflect Our Father amen reflect our father that's what we're here to do right we're to reflect the family that we came from we're going to talk about it this afternoon where brother Brown said if you're searching for a wife look at her family right you know somebody told me one time said if you want to look at your look at your mother-in-law and look at your wife but you look at your mother-in-law and that's what your your wife's going to look like when she gets that age yeah so thank about it I'll read it where brother Bandon will tell you he'll say check out the family not just the girl check out the family nothing wrong with that checking out the family but God told us let's get back to him God told us to multiply and if we do we got to have mother-in-law so praise God for it right amen am we got to have them praise God we don't have to have a thousand of them like problem did all right let's go to let's go to the uh number six now listen God told to multiply and replenish the Earth he didn't want to just have a bunch of people and not be able to communicate with them a family unit is someone is a part of your family that you ought to be able to communicate above anything else you ought to be able to communicate with your with your parents you ought to be able to communicate with your children I know that's hard sometimes but that's not that's what God wanted he wanted Fellowship right and fellowship is just not one way fellowships both ways all right them fellowshipping with you and you fellowshipping with them now look his heart is greater for Fellowship than ours are and the reason he makes us that way is because we're offspring of his that's what makes us long for Fellowship long to to get together with our family that's what makes a mother would die for her baby why that's what makes a father would give his life for his wife a husband a true husband would give his life for his wife why because Christ give his life for the church there's your tipe his wife it's a strain in you listen to this it's a strain in you it's something woven into your very being right right and it made a mother Dash to a burning fire not thinking about her own self and her hair on fire and her clothes on fire to grab her baby and run out with why it's love of a parent and God is the first and Original Parent amen so he ought to know how to raise a family if he's the first in the original and he's Eternal he ought to know how to raise a family what we got to do is we just got to listen right and there's where that strain comes from what God Amen even in Natural Life the strain of family comes that a husband will give his life for his wife whether he's a Christian or not all right and there's where the strain comes through because the woman gave birth to the child so it goes down through the generations that's what he's saying all right let's go to the next one number seven and I think it's when we can get together with this type of Fellowship it does something to us that draws us closer to each other and as we get closer to each other we get closer to God right can I read that again and when we get closer to each other we get closer to God or Jesus said in so much as you have done to the least of these my little ones you have done it to me amen I've got a little boy in here somewhere I suppose Joseph I got Billy sitting here two daughters sitting back there and a wife now if any body had something that was you wanted to do real nice I would much rather you do it to my children than for me now that would be everybody's life amen all right I would do it do it to my to my children give it to my children than it would me see and I feel maybe as a parent and he's the source of Parenthood I think that that's the way God feels if we we should if we should we serve him as we serve each other that's how we serve God all right now think about that you know we're talking about natural family we're going to get into a few details here in a little bit but also remember in the back of your mind how we treat our spiritual family right our spiritual family like brother Donnie and I were talking yesterday he went down to see his family the other Saturday and he just felt like he was not part of them right that's right he was out of place yeah in his natural family cuz there was no what there was no Fellowship that's you can't be unequally Yol and have Fellowship right you can't do that I'm sorry and you said well but now look Jesus said if you can't forsake father mother sister brother children he said you can't enter the kingdom you got to forsake them you can't do it go you don't have to be mean to them you don't have to do away with them no they're there right they're they're they're there you cannot just say God wipe them off no that's where you come from that's your natural family you just better thank God that if your natural family is born again and you can fellowship with them be just you just ought to feel like you Amen on top of the world because it's it would be hard and I can't I can't say that because all of my family is serving the lord and we Fellowship together but I would it'd be something in my mind I couldn't realize for me to be the only person in my whole family to serve the Lord right I had be lonely amen right yeah I guess you just have to fellowship with God the best you could and and just keep praying because God you know what God said he'd give you the desires of your heart he give you some family he'll give you family don't you worry about it right let's go to number eight now God here it is Christ The Mystery of God revealed now look this is some great we we quote this and this some mysterious do you know what he's talking about a plan and a family plan and a family that's what he's talking about right now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and going going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it right remember always check your motive and objective right his motive and objective to in order to let him to be expressed was to let us out let me finish the let me I'm not misquoting brother brandham but I'm telling you that's what he's saying in order to let himself be expressed he had to have a motive to do it he had to have a p a n right he had a plan but he exactly wasn't God at that time let's go back up let's read it the way he read I don't want to misquote the prophet he was trying and was going to achieve and had a motive in doing it in order to let him be himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon a star atom molecule or anything he was God but he exactly wasn't God at that time cuz God is an object of worship there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love and him was to be first thing what father right he wanted a family amen and him wants to be Son part of the family glory and him wants to be savior of the family and him Wants To Be A Healer of the family and in all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were look and all these great attributes that we see already expressed right they were in God this is the expression of God's mind amen right here that's right in this Fallen condition and what whatever you want to say God had God had no different thought than when he had that one in his mind to right now he's not one Split Second older either right that's why I've always said did he did he sit here and think of this and then it happened that make him be time right he thought of this and it happens yeah we're part of God's mind we're actually walking in God's mind if you'll believe that we're walking in the very Mind Of God cuz he can't see see we sat down see uh we sit down and U make a plan and then we go execute it now God's Eternal he can't sit down and make a plan and then execute it as he's making a plan it's being executed cuz he's not one second older he's not waiting on yeah he's waiting on me and you sure down here in time but in eternity this thing's already done am it's already done I telling brother Donnie we got to realize that Holy Ghost Inside of us is in another Dimension amen that's right it's not in this Dimension right the Holy Ghost you have Come From Another Dimension that's right into you put this what you prove it preacher we're sitting together in what Heavenly places in Christ this new birth that we have is in another dimension than what this outside guy's in right amen that's why it's hard for us to contact that guy he's in another dimension right but every once in a while remember the filters that's our problem it's not the Holy Ghost is our problem we're our problem the the flu amen what do you do when you unstop something you turn around blow it out right right it's flowing in this direction you turn around and they call it a back flow you back flow it back out what you let this that comes piled in this way Brother Richard you let this push it out that way that's right you let you let it push it back out let this push it out all right don't keep packing it in let him push it out and let him live amen but remember that you are truly living in two Dimension amen the Holy Ghost you have never lied never cheated never stole never went to Walmart amen never had to go to Walmart he hates to go Walmart he hates for you to go to Walmart but remember that man inside of us is eternal he's almighty God he's that Genesis 1:26 this is the family of God we're in another dimension but we're in but brother Brandon like he said he put us all these attributes had to come into this dimension for us to do what reflect the image of God cuz we are born in in this is the image of God in the image of God that's why I love Genesis 126 cuz it's the whole Bible it's a whole Bible it's all of God's plan in two or three little verses there's everything God wanted Glory he wanted family he wanted us or he wanted us to create us want to multiply and replenish the Earth and us live and subdue the Earth right be a king on the earth be a god of the earth that's what he wanted all right all in Genesis right there right and that Genesis 126 just dropped over it's called Christ right he was born Lord Lord the Christ that's what he come with he come with that in him all right that's why a can say the son of man which is in heaven he was standing on earth right this was in another dimension amen his soul was in another dimension right PL could do things but see he didn't have the flu stopped up like you and I do he wasn't born in sin he didn't have to go over there and ask forgiveness he was the forgiver amen cuz he had the mind of God he didn't have a strain of humanity like you and I now he did have a strain of humanity but not like me and you he didn't have an Earthly father to look back to he didn't have an Earthly mother to look back to remember his father was always he said his father which is in heaven amen Hallowed be thy name all right number nine see this is so hard to stay natural because you the family of God is just interwoven in us so much in the spiritual form all right but we got to keep it natural because we got to use like I said before this holy ghost that we do have we only use it a little bit of a time we only use it a little bit of the time right let's don't think we're so super spiritual that we can't live that we don't live on this Earth in common as common people we do we do we we live a lot more in the natural than we do in the Supernatural all right but I was reading this morning where brother Rand said he said it's going to take I reading about persecution he said it's going to take persecution to turn us what to turn us back too right yes realizing that we are Eternal people trapped in a trapped in a in a flesh body or in a in a not Eternal Body all right when we do that though that's going to let that Outside Inside Man come out right we just let him out every once in a while that's not good but that God knew that he's not having a crisis meeting when we all get in trouble sometimes and we don't talk to him every day he knew that was going to happen right sometimes he just kind of TAPS you on the head and say hey I'm here right so God knew that we would be here but then he put us in flesh so we could be contacted amen see Satan thought he could cut that off at the Garden of Eden so God couldn't contact man he said hey don't worry about it I got blood I'm going to kill the lamb and then I'm going to die I'm going to take care of this Satan don't you worry about it all right but he put us in flesh so we could be contacted in order he could contact he became one of us when he became Jesus Christ the son of God himself the fullness of the manifestation of God see that was the fullness of the manifestation of God that's what God wanted to live in human flesh to be with his people but what a great problem that Jesus had on Earth his family was inside of him not expressed yet right that's why he had to go to Calvary to get us out Glory just like this right here look when I was in my father I knew nothing about it you didn't know you were in your daddy and your great-grandfather there was no place you you saw yourself moving and you know no forget it people until I was 5 or six years old I didn't know nothing it's getting worse when I was when I was in my father I knew nothing about it yeah but when I became his son and was born of him I was an attribute a part of my father right and you're a part of your father he's talking about natural now he's saying and as children of God we are part of God's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have Fellowship one with the other huh as a family of God upon where the Earth right and that was God's purpose at the beginning yes sir that's what God wanted at the beginning excuse me he had everything under control and he turned man over into the Garden on free moral agency and said son it's yours what a beautiful place that's what he done he turned it right over over to us and said here right but this family unit is not we we come here on the earth and we we live and we have children and and we grow up and our parents pass away and a lot of your parents are are gone on to be with the Lord and and that's good because they're in a better place than you are oh yeah if they're born again child of God so don't worry about them let's worry about us now remember what David did this is a wonderful thing in the scripture where David mourn for his child remember the first child that was born between him and B Sheba God said that baby's not going to live but David was so mourned for that child he sackcloth and Ashes and and wouldn't eat and fasted and laid out and prayed and all those things but when the men came and told him said Your son's dead the Bible said he immediately gets up goes in takes a shower let's put it up in 2000 uh 12 words he comes in takes a shower put his clothes on sits down starts eating and the men are scratching their head looking around you know his kind of his little scribes you know and they walk in and they say David you were mourning before and seems like nothing's happened in other words David's great words he said there's nothing I can do about it now the only thing I can do is make sure I right go where he is Sir just make sure I if you got family that's this passed on to be with the Lord or or or friends or anything that are that are born again just say look God I want to see them again I want to see them again my purpose is to see that person again in the like was when right when they got ready to close the casket on brother Tom I said Donnie that will'll never see that man right there again that's right that man like this and walking on a can coming through the door we'll never see that man again right right will see him in the prime of his life and the that ought to just that to me if there's nothing else God does for me nothing else God does for me if my parents pass on and I know they're born again parents and I get to see them young kids cuz see I never got to see them as young kids you didn't either you can't unless you were born when your mom and dad was 12 you can't remember him being young they always been old whole bunch of people my kids I mean my parents have been old but we're going to see them young just like us that's my goal I hate to see an old person hurting bent over just the Pains of Life what a relief what a relief with brother Tommy was just hurting all over but it's gone now that's that will never come back that is a consolation that'll never come back that'll never come back that way that'll come back the way it should have been through Adam and Eve had they not been a there's what God's purpose is as children of God we are part of God's attribute that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have Fellowship one with the other as a family of God upon the Earth and that was God's purpose at the beginning yes sir that's what God wanted to beginning and we think we got problems but listen to this next quote Yeah number 10 Mother's Day then we shall see him then we shall be like him then we shall worship him then we shall see mother as God wants her amen mother would not be complete there without her family amen cuz the greatest time of all her life is to see the children around the table right all of them healthy and happy amen and to see her pour the coffee or whatever she does and fixes supper and her and Dad sit down well that's the happiest time in Mama's life see her kitties all all at home now this this is part of the quote is the quote I want you to see but don't miss don't be missing that day right that let the great chain of your family be hooked together link by link let every spoke be in the wheel and then when we sit down with our families and groups across the canopies of Eternity what a day that will be then we'll understand across the canopies of Eternity amen like number 11 I think of something how mothers will refuse to raise children bring up children and young women practice birth control buy a little dog and lead them around and you only realize lady that just about 20 years of your life that you have that God's lotted to you that you're going to be able to do this great Duty for God yeah yeah now we're going to talk a few minutes on birth control but just hang on a minute do you know your child might be a modern fny or something like that do you realize just about 20 years of your life is as long as you'll be able to raise children and all through the the eternities I love that word Brother Gary that's strike that's a bell that you say eternity eternity that strikes a bell in my heart that strikes something in my heart because God's the only one that's Eternal so if you're hooked into that that makes you Eternal and through the eternities you'll enjoy the blessings of God if you bring a child in this world and raise it right that star that shining Yonder in glory you will be associated with it sisters you don't think you're very important do you see and then to refuse to raise the little fellas because you'd rather take your running around and carrying on that's ridiculous you shouldn't do that and now don't do it no sir don't you do it be a happy person amen mothers of old they love to raise children but all this modern American day that we're living in I tell you our nation is simply polluted there's not a hope left to this nation as I see only an oldfashioned Revival and according to the scripture it'll never be Nationwide so it's not going to be a nationwide Revival but all through eternities you'll enjoy the blessings of God glory now I don't know if it's this quote of the next one scroll on down is that that all that one brother Anderson must be yeah that's okay because somewhere in here brother R speaks of you remember the uh John and Charles Wesley's mother yeah Sarah I think her name is Sarah Wesley she had 17 kids right she sat down every day for 2 hours brother BR said she didn't have a washing machine she didn't have an oven like we do she didn't have microwav let's get on up here in end time she didn't have delivery service she took 17 kids in a Charles Wesley wrote some of the greatest amen hymns ever known to man right and John Wesley we know what he was he was a prophet to that age right he took millions of souls into eternity just because she sat down and read the Bible to them but look mothers of old they love to raise their children now let's just for a second let's go to the next one invisible Union speak of the day that when women wouldn't be no more wouldn't wouldn't no more want children they want a dog or a cat or something like that but she don't want children anymore why she is old mother hovered if she has a child see she don't want that's the remarks of Hollywood it don't want this woman to be an old mother hover so she'll he'll have some operation performed on himself or her one they'll keep them from having children they don't want no children Jesus spoke of it and what did he say at that time they'll begin to cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall on them she'll practice birth control so she can go to parties she can't be bothered with a baby nursing her it'll disform her when she's pregnated it'll be it'll disform her she won't look like she used to now what's brother Brown saying you were put here on Earth sisters to bring forth children now we're not going to talk about birth control that's up to you and your husband you talk to the husband if you have a situation you need to talk to there's the pastor on the front row I love it this time there's the pastor sitting right there you can talk to him but I'm going to tell you something you're never going to stop a baby to being born if God wants it to be born I don't care you can say well I don't practice I don't take a birth control pill I don't do this but we do this well that's birth control anything you do to control the birth is birth control right amen so just have fun yeah Jesus spoke of and he said when they are doing this at that time they'll oh I'm sorry she pra she'll practice birth control now look I think what brother brand saying he sees the attitude behind this I don't know I think in certain cases he might have said birth control was okay for hurting the woman or anything like that right all right but look at his look at what he's talking about a woman can take birth control now and go to a party and not have to worry about getting pregnant let's just be real cuz she can take birth control so she can go out and have fun with anybody she wants to oh yeah see but if if you if you practice birth control you don't have to worry about those things so she can go go to a party she can't be bothered with a baby nursing it'll deform her when she's pregnated it'll deform her she won't look like she used to and her husband ignorant enough to let her go that way she won't give him a Child Jesus spoke of and he said when they were doing this at that time they'll go to crying then for the rocks to fall on them it's the coming of the Lord so we see that in the end time with abortions and all that stuff they pay great sums of money for cats dogs to mother that's right she must mother something because it's a god-given nature to her and we see that happening all over the country and I'm not condemning any of you or saying what it's up to you and your husband that's what I believe I I I don't think we ought to get in your bedroom yeah but but I do think that brother Brandon is being clear about a woman is put here to have children right all right and to bring forth children now things you have to do if you're if you can't then then you know that's maybe you know God's give you something to do besides having children sisters he give you something to do in in uh in life than not to have children I I don't understand that but I'm just trying to tell you that that's what you were put on the earth to do you're put on the earth to bring children and not just bring them just bring children but bring children on the earth and raise them right so now that's puts us to the next page here preparing for children now look look what Psalms and I'm not going to get into the beat the child and all this stuff that's your business you you ought to know how to correct your children I shouldn't have to tell you that that's what I'm going to get to in just a minute cuz this a lot of you have put the responsibility on us to raise your kids yeah it's not my responsibility to raise your kids it's not my responsibility tell your son get a haircut it's not my responsibility to tell your daughter that she's wearing immoral clothes yeah you're the parent right it's not my fault it's yours so don't put it all on me well brother D Don't Preach on it you ought to preach on it at home right problem is the woman the mother looks like the daughter and the daughter looks like the other daughter brother Brown say you went from a flapper to prostitute right sorry that's what he said no that's not my word that's his all right preparing for children low children are inheritage of the Lord so they're not a burden children should not be a burden I just appreciate she's sitting right here on the front PE I appreciate sister mil and I told somebody I think brother D and I were talking about I appreciate sister Mila she's trying her best to raise his children she's not letting somebody else raise him right she's trying to raise his children Glory she's doing the right thing I and I not because yeah give her a hand because not sit on front a lot of you that have single single mothers or or single fathers I I admire somebody but the ones I don't admire is the ones that that go where's my kids where's my kids are they on the top of the church where's my kids yeah they're part of you not me they're part of you you go find out where they're at L children are Heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb see that'll show you what in the garden amen God said don't eat of the what fruit in the midst of the garden everybody understand what I'm talking about cuz you are the fruit of your mother you come from your mother and the fruit of the womb is his reward amen as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth so children are as bad as sometimes we think they are yeah they're a Heritage of the Lord and they're actually your heritage all right Proverbs excuse me 17:6 children's children are the crown of old men grandkids yeah and the glory of children are their fathers right all right so what we're supposed to glorify Our Father amen and we should do things that did not make our Earthly father ashamed of us right right if we do that then we got a problem all right let's go to Joel one this is important cuz remember visited iniquity was passed down through the generation right but do you remember the quote I gave you the other day a few weeks ago where brother brand said the reason God gave Abraham the commission was that he knew Abraham was going to tell it to his children and then tell it to his children and tell it to his right all right so right here is Joel 1:3 tell your children of it and let your children tell them their children what testimony right and your children tell their children and their children another generation going down through time you got to pass things on remember we've only begun in probably the what the 1500s maybe who's a history major um Janet I know you you studied history a lot 1500s they created a printing press or somewhere in there so from 1500 to 2012 we've only had written words down copies so people can read where did it come from God told him in Deuteronomy we'll read it in a little bit Deuteronomy 6 6-9 we'll read it in just a minute he told them to write it down and recite it to their children right so that they wouldn't forget it cuz you had to remember you had to remember what went on you couldn't you couldn't there was even this kind of book I'm holding in my hand you couldn't write it down where it was written on the tabl of the kid's heart all right now let's go to Matthew 18 and said verily I say unto you except you be converted and become as a little child you shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven who so therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven and who so shall receive one listen who so shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me all right so you receive I know sometimes we got kids that that we don't think but that they should be doing this but a child really should carry on the family name that's what that is exactly that's what Jesus is telling them spiritually but he's also making a natural point that whosoever shall receive one child in my name receives me okay the glory of the father down to the children like we read before all right now let's go to Ephesians 6 here's where we're going to talk a few minutes about raising children and then we will start this afternoon on preparing for a spouse right and you fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord have you ever looked that word up nurture the word nurture I wrote up here for you means to cultivate yeah when we cultivate a crop we are constantly doing what needs to be done to see that that crop reaches maturity you know what we're doing with our kids our kids are our crop right reaches M maturity and not just reach maturity but produces what it should right it requires constant awareness of what's happening to the crop dad planted a crop not too long ago now he's not going to take a 3mon vacation and come back and and and and everything's going to be in Rose there's not going to be any weeds bugs are not going to be eating anything he's going to have just wonderful fruit in about 3 months I don't think so I don't think so he'd be he'd be happy to have anything besides weed and bugs no what do you do it requires constant awareness of what's happening to the crop no rain plenty of rain bugs no bugs it requires that one doing the cultivating not the neighbor if the if you plant a garden you don't depend on your neighbor to raise your garden right same way with your children and it requires that the one doing the cultivating is involved daily with that crop amen the crop must have the right environment soil water Etc you see what we're doing in the natural also pulling of the weeds and getting rid of the bugs that could harm the crop right so what does nurture he's talk he says to nurture now look here's what I had to say about it right here turn to the next one go to home is where we nurture our children yeah you say oh no no no we didn't bring to hang on a minute I'll let the prophet tell you brother the scriptures all here let's just obey it that's all as many as I love I rebuke that's this age right so then the Bible said also in Hebrews the 12 8 verse if they cannot stand and won't take rebuking they're illegitimate not sons of God a man blows up hm a woman oh I ain't going to listen to that anymore I don't have all right now go ahead illegitimate that's exactly but a real child of God will take his correction saying yes Father it's your word I've got to straighten up now I've got to do what's right am right well then the altar should have been full the other day when Brother D preached what he preached we got a lot of confession to do that we ain't doing I think we ped the point where we don't need a confess our sins anymore yeah you know that's truth isn't it an illegitimate is the one that's always backs off and flying the soup yeah to just kind of upset something like I told you you got that stubborn stinking spirit in this church yeah nothing but a fly ointment but the real child of God admires to be rebuked and straightened up admires I know my old father never wh me one time but what I bless every lick he hit me to make me what right if I wouldn't have been for that well I'd probably been a renegade myself so I that's what the matter with too many little Ricky and so forth today you let them run out here and throw around and stomp their foot and little Mary says I just won't do that she ought have had my mother that's right yes sir we got too much of now just letting the kids no wonder we got juvenile delinquency you know what caused it parent delinquency right and that's the truth people right from right here back yeah that's the truth we've let our kids get by with too much stuff that's what started it yes sir you don't keep your children around you there's the key you don't keep your children around you let them out in these places and carry on like that and endorsing it no wonder we're in such an age as we are now amen so let's go to number 14 seal of the Antichrist we have time for everything else now look this is not 1955 we have time for everything else no time for prayer meetings same thing with a lot of you you won't come to Bible study cuz you got something to do that night well what is it better than coming to bible study yeah sorry people if the word of God's not going to be first in your life then God's not first in your life right all right the homes all butchered up and the girls and boys are out going around lking around the country and mothers and fathers unconcerned and yet Pentecostal see that's where a lot of mothers and fathers have transferred that concern to the pastors and the deacons and yeah you we'll read it in just a minute what we need tonight is a home altar in the house house house a place where God where the Bible's read and children are taught the word of the Living God Amen yes sir now look let's go to the next one children obviously we're not supposed to be be them all the time unless they need it but they're supposed to be love and this is me talking to you we invest our time in a lot of things but have we invested our time in our children right amen invest a period of time Miss Wesley invested two hours of her day every day and sat down with her 17 kids they had to be a dirty diaper in there somewhere they had to be one that was tired and had to be one that was hungry yeah but she took 2 hours out of her day sat down and talked to those 17 children about God I'd say 15 of them were pretty good too but she raised two that were Mighty Men of God right all right and she did it never said much about her daddy I mean their dad but their mother did the rais it y all right but children need to be loved we need to take the time and invest invest this was right here Susanna Wesley all right let's read it I'll tell you I think today we have such a juvenile crime wave Across the Nation but really I think it started in the church oh it didn't say that oh it says in the home I think the the parents began to let go and if the child had been raised up in a good oldfashioned Godly home I don't say it would be all over certainly not but it would certainly give that child the right kind of influence right I think many times that homes that children has been brought up Wrong Turn loose on the street and just live from themselves while the mother stay in a barroom or the father and so forth they don't take care of this kid another thing they don't love it and give it the affection remember brother Brown told us said if you don't love them somebody else will why because they're like a sponge all right so invest time in your children they don't love it and give it the affections to take it up it's young you got to teach it to love and respect you got to teach it that teach it to love you can't respect is just not in built in a person you got to teach them how to love and how to respect and to read the Bible I think of Susanna Wesley I think she had 17 children I think that's right but she found 2 hours or more every day to pray down at the end of her dress where the little boy's nailed around out of there produced a John and Charles that changed the course of the world saved the world in that day she didn't have a washing machine and a dryer as we have the day in the dishwasher and so forth are aade the thing that she did it all herself but yet she could find time because she was putting an influence to some children that finally changed the course of the world I think that's the oldfashioned mother the oldfashioned home with prayer and the understanding of the Bible amen so we need to nurture cultivate what did she do she cultivated those children she took them out she saw maybe Charles and them were were a little bit special but I don't think she set them aside but she knew in her mind that those two guys were special amen now look that's number 15 number 16 let's talk about the home environment the home environment just for a minute cuz this is where it starts we only got two or three hours here people on Satur on Sunday and hour and a half or two hours on Wednesday where do they spend most of their time at home or should be at home you know what I think everybody has their own opinion but one of the greatest to my opinion the greatest presidents ever had in this nation was Abraham Lincoln now not because he was a republican because he was what he was a godly man and he was raised he and he to serve God he said if there's anything that I want to give praise to he said or my life was influenced by was a Godly mother who taught me to pray and know Jesus as my savior oh your family is what you are right amen you rais your child in a certain environment it's got a 99% better chance to go right than it has if you bring it up in the wrong way bring up a child in the way it should go when it's old it will not depart from you be brought up right teach your children to do right be honest be square and fair right even when they're in school all right let's go to the next one questions and answers brother Brown what achievement should we let our pre-teen children participate in I beg your pardon what activities should our pre pre-teen children anticipate uh participate in also how should we go about helping them select their Associates keep them in Christian company as long as you possibly can keep them with if it's a girl keep her with Christian girls now let me give you a point there he said Christian he didn't say people believe the message there's a difference the difference is what gets us in trouble yeah if it's a girl keeper with Christian girls Christian boys vice versa if she's old enough to go with a boy see that she keeps with the right kind of boy see that she keeps with the right kind of boy right discourage her discourage her to any boy otherwise or boy to a girl if she's going with an unbeliever try to encourage her to go with a Believer and vice versa here's the point make your home nice cuz we're going to talk about applying a token right here at the end make your home nice make your home a place where your daughter or son will not be ashamed to bring their company before their father and mother and into their house and make home so happy that they'll be pleased in their home to stay there oh my he's talking about here seven in a row he's talking about the U questions to go all right so now the next one that was nurturing the next one we're going to talk about is admonition what is the word admonition to teach and correct right now look remember the schools youth camps and churches are not to take the place of what God has ordained the family to do not to take the place this doesn't take the place what you do at home right you're supposed to raise them at home right what I said children does not bother me during a service crying or moving around or anything like that it's the unconcerned adults yeah that bothers me right and you can be sitting in your seat and never go to bed B three or four times the kid go to the bathroom two or three times they don't bother me they're kids that's what I told them the other day we were talking about kids I said from 0er to 5 we're wanting them to say everything say this say this word do this do this little funny thing do this little funny and didn't your mama do that and then from age 6 to 18 we're trying to get them to shut up sit down don't do that be quiet right and we expect to bring them to church after all week we said oh do this little cute thing you know well they come in church they got people around them they going to do that little cute thing thing that's okay that don't bother me does it bother you it doesn't bother a preacher I hardly ever hear a baby cry right cuz it really doesn't matter to me other things that bothered me yeah it makes me cry but look don't let the church this is my point don't let the church don't let brother Dale don't let brother Wade don't let the deacons be your crutch right right right they're your kids you raise them first y then if you can't raise them then that's when we're supposed to take over all right you understand what I mean so it's a it's a slap to you if you have to tell me about your children right exactly right then right amen it's a father and a mother's responsibility to raise your own kids amen if they keep getting out of line we're not going to go to the kid we're going to go to the parent and if the parent has a wrong attitude then we're going to go to brother Dale find out and see what going on right CU they a spirit in there somewhere but admonition raise them up in the nurture and admonition to teach and to correct so that's your job to teach and to correct let's go to Deuteronomy 6 this what I was talking about a few minutes ago and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart what God's talking to them and thou shalt teach them diligently that word diligently means forcefully I mean just every day diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sest in thine house and when thou west by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes that's right here and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house and on thy Gates what the Commandments that God's given he's giv them the Commandments that's what he's telling them to do put them there all right let's go to number 18 talk about wealth in the church while there never has been such a show of wealth the beautiful sanctuaries are multiplied in numbers as never before the bearish groups VI with each other to see who can build the biggest and the loveliest and they build Education Centers worth unestimated millions and those buildings are used only an hour or two a week now that would not be such a terrible thing but they expect this little this is Brother Brown talking but they expect this little time spent by the children in the education plant to take the place of the hours of training supposed to be given in the home in the home amen that's your Prophet number 19 Third Exodus now we got a little bit longer about 25 minutes if you don't mind conre says amen I want to continue this tape just a minute he's taping it notice the king that new king that raised up that didn't know Joseph what was his first scheme to destroy the power of Israel was with their children right Satan has always remember he tried he killed Abel he went in and he tried to kill the children of Israel or the yeah the children of Israel the little babies to try to get Moses right same way with Jesus when he Herod heard he was 2 years old and Below he had all them babies killed so God starts with destroying children I mean sorry Satan starts with destroy ding children okay look what was the first scheme to D destroy the power of Israel was with their children remember the sons of God saw the daughters of men back before that what brought them together started having children that's right congregation said that man he tried to destroy their children now listen close that same Devil in a different form of a kingship tried to destroy God's only son remember in in herod's time the Devil is a real smart shrewd bird he knows how to hit the thing before it gets started he knows it see and the only thing now here's what you do the only thing you ever do to beat him is rely on Christ and humble yourself and let him lead you see you'll never do it any other way your intellectual Powers will never do it right now listen to this you got to believe it just rely on him he is the shepherd it ain't the Sheep's business to keep the wolf away right right it's the shepherd's business our father right amen amen Pastor for you father for the family all right it's your business to keep the wolf away but the Sheep must stay with the shepherd Amen in order to stay safe that's my safety zone is in Christ and Christ is the word that's the safety zone right so it is not the sole responsibility for the pastor the Deacon to teach and correct your children and I wrote on here we've always had more trouble with parents and children anyway children are just children you you've never seen brother Dale go in in in an office and talk to three or four kids no it's adults that get took into the office and talk to right or they need to be all right now let's be serious right here just for a minute we got about 10 minutes this is where the key is to everything that we do in a family right here yeah apply the token to your home amen that's right that's where you're going to be that's where you're going to live be sure that your homes and this is me now this is not brother rown this is mine but I'm going to read you some quotes from him to back it up apply the token to your home be sure that your homes and your lives have the token not just applied but working amen working that's right plan you can't apply the token and do contrary to it yourself amen and expect it to have any effect I've always said if we were supposed to have some visitors this morning but since they're not

she didn't know anything about smoking a cigarette he was doing what Mom and Daddy does so let's don't be surprised let's don't be surprised if our children don't come to church because y'all don't come to church all the time let's don't be little like our kids if you don't get to church on time let's don't be little our kids if you don't come but once on Sunday and and what don't don't be

live an Exemplar life but we do make our mistakes you don't hold us up God will do that but this is the only thing you need to listen to amen if it's right you listen to what I'm saying all right that's what brother Brown said one time he said something about a situation he said they believe me when I'm in the pull pit but they don't blame me when I'm not you know like that brother that I told you about the finances he had a a a interview with brother Brown brother Brown said look brother you can't handle your finances let your wife do it didn't pay attention to that I've always said these people that want brother Brown to come back if he come back and was contrary to what they thought they wouldn't listen to him CU they said well you're not you're not really brother brandham brother brandham would come the way we wanted him to come a't that cus same devil in cus that said he's if he's not a man of God he would have come to me see I'm talking about Jesus so it's the same devil it's got different name but when the token which is what the Holy Ghost is truly applied to a home it will create the right at atmosphere to grow your crop right or to nurture your children exactly I'm telling you I'm honest with you my children's greatest problem was me I didn't raise them right I didn't listen I wasn't a Christian I'm trying now you're trying now yeah a lot of things we can't

it now this is the evening time now you've been listening a long time now this is the evening time it's applying time now right the Wrath will strike one of these days it might be too late then apply the token and I like what he said with confidence right all right now let me a few things right here note this is my this is is me apply the token with confidence that's what brother R said fathers be the leader remember what we were talking about fathers you have to be the leader or the initiator so the father is the head of the household you the one that goes first Mothers follow right in behind with what support and love now according to the word right he lets all this other stuff happen or she lets uhuh according to the word amen that's when you back each other up now listen this is one right here that I try not to do didn't try to do around my family I Josh may know that I did it maybe a time or two but I even as a siner I don't try to have an argument in front of my kids they may know that we argue they may see the pans flying but they're in another room but listen if you disagree on an issue that comes up about anything especially the children don't do it in front of the children right amen but come to a sound biblical based decision together amen together don't fuss in front of the kids that cuz it just creates another What atmosphere for them to be nurtured in their wrong way right you're going to have disagreements I said I didn't say I should have said when when you disagree on an issue that comes up about anything don't do it in front of the kids right just don't do it in front of the kids keep their little mind pure and holy they know when things are wrong don't you tell me tell me one thing your kidss know when something's wrong right that's right they know they're the first ones so they got that real sweet Spirit about them and they know when something's wrong between Mom and Daddy or between family they're the first one to know it but they don't have to be caught in the middle of it come to a sound biblical based decision together plan we're going to talk about that tonight we're going to talk this afternoon about planning for the future planning for the future now I haven't said anything about discipline you discipline your child the Bible says raise up a child way and the way it go and then when it departs it'll come back to you all right it also says spare the rods full the child um I believe in spanking children but I don't believe in spanking them with an open hand or something real cuz you can really get in trouble um their bones are real fragile but like Dy said I know some people on the internet doesn't know what a keen Hickory but the word Keen is is is real kind real thin yeah it's real thin that hurts but it amen that hurts but it's not going to kill them right just get a little a little all you know what the Lord grows them all during the springtime he just makes them things grow out about this long and just puts them there for Mom and Daddy to get and don't take them one about that long you better go down about where the Roots come out of the ground cuz if you don't they going to go out there and get to a three but kids remember one thing I know listen to me kids your mom and daddies love you yeah if they're trying to raise you in the admonition and and the nurturing of the Lord You're a blessed child cuz you look at what goes on out here in the world with mixed marriages and mixed families and all this stuff and and uh most people out in the world consider their child a burden not a blessing yeah right they're considered a burden not a blessing if your mom and dad require you to go to church and sit in church and listen to some old boring guy that's okay you'll not forget it your mom and dad is the greatest thing you got outside of your salvation kids right right and kids God has purpose that we do raise kids that we this not a surprise not something God's not got already ready for us yeah he got everything we we need like I said make a sound biblical based decision on anything you do right don't whip them in haste right stop it's kind of like crossing the road stop look look and listen yeah both ways listen to them then do like Daddy did he talked to you about 10 or 15 minutes and then he whip you the whipping didn't hurt so bad it was the talking to cuz I knew I was going to get it at the end of the talking all right let's stand you love the Lord amen not a surprise that we have a family right and we still got to live in this world right as a family and you know the world had come to an end yet so we got a generation that's coming up we got a generation that's now facing challenges that you and I didn't have to face right but God didn't leave them alone right amen I you know I wish that we would have when we first started that we' have had enough Youth and all time to to to nurture us when we were going to church but that didn't happen I that's okay that it didn't happen but now you don't have an excuse parents we got an information we got the message all of it we got the whole 1100 something sermon you can put it in your computer if you need to know something about how to handle a situation sure it's fine to call Brother Dale or you can call me it doesn't matter to me that's okay amen but your responsibility is to raise your children and men I've always already told you don't be blind to these things look over at your wife if she ain't got on the right clothes tell her she ain't got on the right clothes amen kids look over at the kids can it go on the right cloth it's your responsibility it's a reflection on you as a parent right amen when that happens as long as they're here in church you know as long as they're under your leadership and now if they go out somewhere and come back you can't control what they wear and what they do if they come back to church on Easter and Christmas like most of them do and I did the same thing for years all right but remember one thing got to keep Church clean remember one thing it's your responsibility cuz God give to you to raise brother D's not going to be responsible for the raising of your children he's responsible for the raising of you and you got to listen or you're that kind of child that's U born out of wedlock right right let's sing a song it's 12: oh about about if aren't you
