[3:57] some
[3:58] sweet days
[4:00] amen and amen and amen
[4:02] amen see you in the rapture
[4:05] we were supposed to take up an offering
[4:07] for the uh
[4:08] brother in the philippines but what
[4:10] happened
[4:11] uh brother al called me and then they
[4:13] got on the internet system
[4:15] that they would not let him leave the
[4:17] hospital
[4:18] unless that they had
[4:20] the money for you know payment or
[4:22] something
[4:23] so what we done is we went ahead and
[4:26] sent the money
[4:27] to them earlier this past week
[4:30] you know that way we could get it to
[4:32] them where they could help them so we
[4:34] sent two thousand dollars to the two
[4:36] brother siriano there and
[4:39] you know the family whatever they could
[4:41] get him out of the hospital because they
[4:42] said he let him out of the hospital
[4:44] and all but they weren't going to let
[4:46] him out till he paid the bills
[4:49] so they would let him out and then i
[4:50] think now that they said there was going
[4:52] to be about three months six months or
[4:54] something he would have to go back and
[4:56] have uh bypass surgery or something to
[5:00] be done but we went ahead and sent that
[5:02] now so we didn't take it up today but if
[5:04] you want to put any in just put it in
[5:07] the offering plate you know because it
[5:09] all goes and just lay at an offering
[5:11] plate and just say well that's that was
[5:13] for that and it all goes together anyway
[5:15] so just remember that amen and they
[5:18] mentioned terrence did about the the
[5:20] philippines but the narcissist called
[5:21] the other day
[5:22] and was asking us to pray for him during
[5:24] the time of that
[5:27] typhoon or whatever going through and i
[5:29] don't know how everything's turned out
[5:31] what it's doing but
[5:33] just keep praying for those people over
[5:35] there that
[5:36] uh you know wind up
[5:38] uh losing everything in the world
[5:40] and all like that just keep them in your
[5:43] prayers
[5:44] but how
[6:02] so just remember all of these keep them
[6:04] in your prayer amen you enjoy the
[6:05] message this morning looking forward
[6:07] this afternoon to the word of the lord
[6:10] so
[6:11] let's just sing and
[6:14] ask god to come and speak to us because
[6:16] that's what we believe will happen today
[6:18] right
[6:19] he speaks to his ministry so remember
[6:21] that okay
[6:22] open the eyes of my heart
[6:27] open the eyes of my heart
[6:30] i want to see
[6:33] do you
[6:35] i would
[6:37] then listen to the word
[6:41] open the eyes of my heart
[6:45] open the eyes
[6:54] remember now the watch night service
[6:56] that brother timothy burdette will be
[6:58] preaching to watch night service here
[6:59] for us you remember that remember the
[7:02] other announcements that are made
[7:21] shining in the light of your morning
[7:30] oh
[7:54] hey man that's wonderful i love that
[7:56] song
[7:58] you guys
[7:59] i wish you could uh come back with me
[8:01] for a couple weeks in oklahoma we have
[8:03] about 35 in our congregation
[8:05] i have a man who leads songs for me but
[8:08] he's not really a song leader
[8:10] you guys have three of them here you
[8:11] guys i
[8:12] you guys oughta you got to realize how
[8:14] blessed you are
[8:16] i don't even have somebody in my church
[8:17] that's qualified to be a deacon
[8:20] and that's something i mean you guys
[8:22] i'm telling you you here ought to really
[8:25] thank god
[8:27] i think you take it for granted what you
[8:29] got here really
[8:30] and uh
[8:31] it's just
[8:32] it's a privilege to come here and i'm a
[8:34] little envious when i come
[8:36] i see all these people he says there's
[8:38] new people coming in oklahoma it's just
[8:40] a prairie out there it just
[8:43] there's 83 churches in bartlesville it's
[8:45] 38 000 people
[8:46] and it's it's the most burnt off place
[8:48] you'll ever see and it just
[8:50] we just don't get many we'll get a
[8:52] visitor here and then and boy they don't
[8:53] usually show up much maybe it's a
[8:55] preacher i don't know but
[8:57] uh but it's tough you know it really is
[8:59] but
[9:00] uh
[9:02] and i tell the church even at our church
[9:04] i don't really think
[9:05] we have the full essence of what we
[9:07] really have as a group of people
[9:10] uh
[9:11] we we just don't understand what what
[9:13] what how god has been so gracious to us
[9:16] in this hour
[9:17] i mean all the sages and all the
[9:19] prophets wanted to live in this hour did
[9:21] you know that right if you would ask
[9:23] paul or any of the great prophets of old
[9:26] where they wanted to live they just said
[9:28] lula georgia
[9:30] did you know that they wanted to sit
[9:32] right here with you
[9:33] in this hour because there's something
[9:36] really great that's happening and
[9:37] sometimes i think we take these things
[9:39] for granted
[9:40] as people and it just
[9:43] like i told the words in the church i
[9:45] can't put into english words
[9:47] what he's done for me i can't explain it
[9:51] can anybody explain it
[9:54] i just can't explain it i just i know it
[9:56] by experience i know what he's done for
[9:58] me
[9:59] and i just someday i hope to have the
[10:00] words where i could utter it you know
[10:03] to show him how much i appreciate we'll
[10:05] go to the scriptures now and we'll go to
[10:06] revelation 10 we all know these
[10:08] scriptures we quote them uh we probably
[10:10] know most of these by heart don't we but
[10:13] we're going to go through it again and
[10:14] just and let me read it for you and i
[10:16] saw another mighty angel does everybody
[10:18] understand brother graham said an angel
[10:20] is a ministering spirit
[10:22] right so we understand that this mighty
[10:24] angel come down brother branson said
[10:25] only christ it could be amen what is
[10:28] that it was a a spirit a ministering
[10:30] spirit to come to the earth
[10:32] and this ministering spirit that came to
[10:34] the earth did and it was christ
[10:36] so everybody i hope understands that
[10:38] brother ham said it was christ brother
[10:39] ram told us who it was and he came as a
[10:41] ministering spirit okay
[10:44] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[10:46] from heaven
[10:47] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[10:49] upon his head and his face was as it
[10:51] were the sun and his feet as pillars of
[10:53] fire and he had in his hand a little
[10:56] book open
[10:57] that right
[10:59] like i told the church a little book few
[11:01] there be that find it it's not a this is
[11:02] not a great big book
[11:04] right few there be that find this one a
[11:07] little book open and he set his right
[11:09] foot upon a sea and his left foot up on
[11:11] the earth he cried with a loud voice as
[11:13] one of ryan lyon roarth and when he had
[11:16] cried seven thunders
[11:18] uttered their voices
[11:20] and when he had be and when the seven
[11:22] thunders
[11:23] and do you realize this is the only
[11:25] place thunders is mentioned right here
[11:26] right there so the thunders the seven
[11:28] thunders are associated with this
[11:30] seventh church age messenger
[11:32] you go out there's not one one
[11:36] luther
[11:37] none of them preached on the thunders
[11:39] you can't find any preacher ever
[11:42] that have preached on the thunders okay
[11:44] can i tell you that find it i'll
[11:47] challenge you i went out the internet i
[11:49] did thunders i looked through you can't
[11:50] find it
[11:51] because thunders is associated with this
[11:53] seventh church the mighty angel and the
[11:56] seven church age messengers does
[11:57] everybody agree with that
[11:59] okay
[12:00] so you won't find it nowhere in history
[12:02] before this will you find
[12:04] where it's mentioned okay
[12:06] you just won't
[12:08] and when the seventh others had uttered
[12:09] their voices i was about to write and i
[12:11] heard a voice from heaven saying unto me
[12:13] seal up those things which the seven
[12:16] thunders uttered now he could write what
[12:18] he seen
[12:19] but he couldn't write what he heard
[12:22] is that brother brown made that plain to
[12:23] us he couldn't write what those voices
[12:25] uttered but he did write what he seen
[12:28] right and he wrote it in symbol form
[12:31] okay so when he wrote in symbol form
[12:33] it's still a mystery we have it written
[12:35] in the bible but it hasn't been revealed
[12:37] as of yet
[12:38] and write them not
[12:40] and the angel which i shall stand upon a
[12:42] sea and upon the earth
[12:44] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[12:46] by him that liveth forever and ever who
[12:48] created heaven and the things that
[12:50] therein are in the earth and the things
[12:52] that they're in and the sea and the
[12:54] things which are therein that there
[12:55] should be time no longer
[12:58] right can i can i tell you the mysteries
[13:01] are through
[13:02] when this mighty angel comes down the
[13:04] earthly angel seventh angel was on earth
[13:06] at that time there's no more time
[13:09] there's no more revelation
[13:11] does everybody understand that the
[13:13] mysteries are finished so it's up to us
[13:15] to pick up these mysteries and get out
[13:17] of here
[13:18] okay there's not another day to come
[13:21] there's you know there's not something
[13:23] another message to come it's finished
[13:26] exactly time's up you what you get out
[13:28] of this 17 earth church age messenger
[13:30] the seventh angel it's finished with him
[13:33] okay
[13:34] but in the days of the voice of the
[13:36] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[13:37] sound not when he starts his ministry
[13:40] but when he begins to sound the mystery
[13:42] of god i'm going to say the mystery of
[13:44] the word is everybody okay with that
[13:47] should be finished it's over right
[13:49] there's nothing else to follow this
[13:52] as he hath declared made known to his
[13:55] servants the prophets let's bow our
[13:56] heads dear heavenly father we thank you
[13:58] for the reading of the word we pray that
[14:00] you'll be with us as we minister here
[14:02] tonight lord and may you help me move
[14:04] through it and keep the people's
[14:05] attention lord i know they're tired and
[14:08] i just pray lord you'll give him
[14:09] strength in this hour in jesus christ's
[14:11] name we ask it amen
[14:14] you can be seated
[14:19] what i want to do is continue on with
[14:20] the book of redemption it's like i told
[14:23] you
[14:24] in each time
[14:26] every time that you have an exodus
[14:28] prophet
[14:29] there's one theme that really sticks out
[14:30] and it's redemption
[14:32] there's a big there's redemption he's
[14:34] bringing you out of something into
[14:35] something right i told you i'm going to
[14:37] kind of go back just for a second but
[14:39] under the children of israel they knew
[14:41] him as jehovah
[14:43] before that that name jehovah was never
[14:45] known
[14:46] that's what it says go read in in i
[14:48] think six three of exodus
[14:50] exodus chapter six three it'll say he
[14:52] was my name is jehovah he was never
[14:55] known as jehovah before
[14:56] he was known as god almighty elohim
[14:59] jehovah's existing with his people is
[15:01] that right so the children of israel
[15:03] received something in that hours the
[15:05] fullness
[15:06] of the redemptive names of jehovah of
[15:08] the old testament okay when jesus came
[15:11] another exodus brought of it what did he
[15:13] reveal to the people the fullness of the
[15:16] godhead bodily
[15:18] so every time it talks about redemption
[15:20] there's a fullness that comes to the
[15:21] earth at that time in this hour what
[15:24] we've had is the mystery of god's
[15:26] finished
[15:27] does everybody understand that the
[15:29] fullness of the word has come
[15:31] you can't add to it you can't take away
[15:33] i can't add to it i can't take away
[15:36] it's the fullest the word has been given
[15:38] i can't i can't do it any better than
[15:41] brother branham did it what he does is
[15:43] like me you come back through it and
[15:44] break it all down into parts and at the
[15:46] end of your 28 you'll probably do a
[15:48] summary won't you
[15:50] most of the time you do usually at the
[15:51] last one you spread it out there and the
[15:53] last one i go down and try to bring it
[15:55] all together so that people will see all
[15:57] the parts of it
[15:59] see a lot of times redemption there's
[16:00] parts to it does everybody understand
[16:03] the third pool there's parts to it
[16:07] if i say that are you okay with that
[16:08] there's parts to it
[16:10] and so in this hour what i want what i
[16:12] wanted you to get we understand we're in
[16:14] an exodus we've had an exodus prophet
[16:16] we've had the fullness of the word the
[16:18] mystery of god's finished right
[16:21] but there's parts to that
[16:23] that what you're doing is you're
[16:24] breaking the parts down for them
[16:27] to where we can get a revelation from
[16:29] god right now does everybody understand
[16:31] that i hope i want to i want to show you
[16:33] something here when i say i preached on
[16:35] the book of life if i do something
[16:36] that's different to you you can go back
[16:38] and fix it won't you
[16:39] i know see this man what i like about
[16:41] him and i'm the same way i'm not afraid
[16:43] somebody will preach something wrong in
[16:44] my church
[16:45] now i don't bring somebody in that i
[16:46] know has false doctrine but if somebody
[16:49] comes and preached something wrong in my
[16:50] church i have taught my people well
[16:51] enough they'll catch it
[16:56] i have that kind of confidence
[16:58] right
[16:59] he has confidence if i say something
[17:00] wrong he'll fix it when i leave
[17:03] you might tell me at home now i hope he
[17:04] does
[17:05] because you know what if i'm wrong i
[17:06] want to be right is everybody that way
[17:09] am i heady and high minded brother bram
[17:10] said hitting highmind is know it all he
[17:12] said when you think you know it all
[17:14] you're wrong start over
[17:16] i don't know at all i only know what
[17:18] what's been given in this hour what god
[17:20] has revealed to me personally now do i
[17:22] think i'm going way up where this guy is
[17:24] not really
[17:25] i feel like a gnat compared to him
[17:28] i'll guarantee you i wish i'd been in it
[17:30] as long as you have preaching as long
[17:31] i'd be good at it
[17:34] i'm still practicing okay i'm going to
[17:35] be honest with you okay
[17:37] but i want to show you this is the book
[17:39] here okay
[17:41] oops you at least you could've gave me
[17:43] one at work
[17:48] okay i'm not a you can tell i'm not an
[17:50] artist either huh
[17:52] that's terrible don't you think
[17:55] i'm gonna put over here book of life
[17:58] i'm gonna put lamb's book of life on
[18:00] this side is that okay
[18:08] yeah give me a sharpie
[18:10] but does everybody understand it brother
[18:12] brandon when he talked about the and we
[18:14] call this this whole thing we'll either
[18:16] call it the lamb's book of life which is
[18:17] inclusive of all of it sometimes brother
[18:19] graham says book of life and he's
[18:20] inclusive of all of it right but when
[18:22] brother really gets the detail and
[18:24] breaks the parts down
[18:26] we understand that there's two parts to
[18:28] the book of life or vlan's book alive
[18:30] whichever way you want to say it that
[18:31] don't matter to me okay but i'm going to
[18:33] tell you the book of life
[18:35] over here you have people that are
[18:36] justified
[18:38] because over on the book of life
[18:39] remember in revelations it says that the
[18:42] book of life were opened and they were
[18:44] judged from the works that they did
[18:46] does everybody understand justification
[18:47] is a work
[18:49] of the holy ghost but it's works right
[18:51] right so people who are in this side of
[18:54] the book alive they're going to if
[18:55] they're just justified
[18:57] that they're going to be justified be
[18:59] judged by the works of justification
[19:01] do you agree you say yes you agree
[19:04] another one is sanctification
[19:06] sanctification is a work of grace does
[19:09] everybody agree with that
[19:11] now there's another group that you know
[19:13] what they're good to the bride and they
[19:15] got good works right
[19:17] because it says i'm going to say good to
[19:19] the bride
[19:21] then at the white throne the book of
[19:22] life is open does everybody understand
[19:24] what i'm saying now i'm going to tell
[19:26] you something the lamb's book of life
[19:27] it's done at the white throne it's over
[19:30] right do you agree
[19:32] and i'm going to tell you the difference
[19:33] between the book of life and the lamb's
[19:35] book of life the lamb's book of life is
[19:37] that people receive the fullness of the
[19:38] word in their hour
[19:41] luther received the fullness of the word
[19:43] in his hour
[19:45] the people that didn't receive that full
[19:47] message it was given in luther's day
[19:48] were on the book of life
[19:50] do you agree
[19:52] for good works they're going to be there
[19:54] brother and said at the white throne
[19:55] judgment multitudes will make it there
[19:58] that's why i told you this morning when
[19:59] you understand the book of life you'll
[20:00] have a different approach to people
[20:03] i don't know about you but i do
[20:05] because i'll be quite i don't know where
[20:07] your name is on there i know where my
[20:09] name is it's been revealed to me
[20:11] in chapter five john knew where his name
[20:13] was right that's why he was he knew the
[20:15] redeemer he knew where his name was i'm
[20:17] gonna be honest with you people sitting
[20:19] right here you know if you're just
[20:20] justified
[20:22] amen
[20:25] some of you know if you're not if you
[20:27] haven't come through sanctification yet
[20:28] right
[20:29] you know
[20:30] sure you know
[20:32] you know exactly where you're at right
[20:34] you're the only one who really does
[20:37] i don't know where my wife is to be
[20:39] honest as far as her spiritual part of
[20:40] it
[20:41] i believe she's on the lamb's book of
[20:43] life i believe that's all my heart i
[20:45] believe i got the right one you know who
[20:46] my right one is the one that's got the
[20:48] same revelation i do
[20:50] brother said don't marry an unbeliever
[20:52] under no circumstance he said if they
[20:54] don't if you're going to marry somebody
[20:56] they don't believe like you do don't
[20:57] marry them
[20:59] is that so hard for a message believer
[21:01] to believe that right
[21:03] geez
[21:04] the girls in our church man we got girls
[21:06] been married they're husbands we're a
[21:08] hooligan
[21:09] i mean
[21:11] you know you know what most women in the
[21:13] message think this is the only guy we're
[21:14] going to get it's the last chance right
[21:16] here
[21:17] no it's not
[21:19] god will bring you the right one through
[21:21] if you'll wait on him
[21:23] if israel would have waited they'd have
[21:24] got the right king they wouldn't have
[21:26] voted in saul
[21:28] just wait that's the hardest thing for
[21:29] christians to do wait
[21:31] so the book of life is those are
[21:32] justified sanctified and been good to
[21:34] the bride everybody agree with that
[21:37] and these over here they're the ones
[21:38] that received like i said i know i'm
[21:40] repeating myself
[21:41] fullness
[21:43] the word for their hour i'm going to put
[21:45] it that way so you'll understand
[21:48] is that right
[21:49] now brother branham said this he said
[21:51] adam does everybody understand adam had
[21:53] the book of life
[21:55] he said book of life didn't he
[21:57] when adam fell the book of life went
[21:59] back to the father exactly
[22:02] right amen and now i can it don't say it
[22:05] there but i can say it now
[22:07] that book was sealed with seven seals
[22:09] can i say that you're okay sure amen
[22:12] does everybody agree the book of life
[22:14] was sealed with seven seals
[22:17] right
[22:18] now i told you this morning what we call
[22:20] the book of redemption is not even
[22:21] mentioned in the bible so it's a mystery
[22:24] okay
[22:25] so what sealed this book up here
[22:28] can i say it is the book of redemption
[22:30] the mystery of redemption the plan of
[22:32] redemptions the way brother branham
[22:33] brought it right is everybody okay with
[22:35] that
[22:36] the plan of redemption for the hour
[22:38] luther was justification he seen the
[22:40] fullness of the word it proved he was
[22:42] here did everybody understand
[22:44] but the mystery of it hasn't been made
[22:45] known till this hour
[22:47] the thunders are the mysteries that was
[22:49] contained are the seals
[22:51] and the mystery look luther preached
[22:53] does everybody agree luther preached
[22:55] justification
[22:56] amen
[22:57] as if you've never done it i don't know
[22:59] about you guys but like brother i'm
[23:01] saying visible union greater portion
[23:03] justification under luther is as if
[23:05] you've never done it the mysterious part
[23:07] of it is i never did it
[23:10] so we go way beyond forgiving
[23:13] we never did it right brother said
[23:15] luther what he did he said well we're
[23:17] forgiven in other words we we remember
[23:20] what we did we're guilty of what we did
[23:22] but the justification in this hour the
[23:24] mysterious part of it
[23:26] the plan of redemption that's been
[23:27] opened in this hour of justification is
[23:30] it's a far greater portion than what
[23:32] luther had
[23:33] is that right we never did it
[23:36] the real you never ever did it
[23:41] right
[23:43] so what wraps this book up is seven
[23:45] seals
[23:46] what wrapped that thing up was the plan
[23:48] of redemption
[23:49] there was a fall in the garden he had
[23:51] the book but god had to come up with a
[23:53] plan
[23:54] so he sealed the book up with a plan
[23:57] if people met
[23:58] the plan in that hour then their name
[24:01] was on this side of the book right sure
[24:04] if they didn't know if they had good
[24:06] works you look loose
[24:08] judas had his name taken out of the book
[24:10] because why
[24:11] he rejected the word for his hour
[24:15] that right if the fullness of the word
[24:17] exists here in the church and you stay
[24:18] at justification
[24:21] now if you're truly justified and you
[24:22] just god don't give you the revelation
[24:24] of it you can make it there
[24:26] you can make it under brother man said
[24:28] also he said you can fall off at
[24:29] justification you can fall off in
[24:31] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[24:33] ghost you can't fall off there
[24:35] if your name's over here whatever age
[24:37] you were in you will receive the
[24:38] fullness of the word
[24:40] and i've told you redemption is the
[24:42] fullness of something it was the
[24:44] fullness of jehovah it was that name was
[24:46] revealed in jesus hour it was the
[24:48] fullness of the godhead bodily that was
[24:51] revealed to those people in that hour in
[24:54] this hour there's a fullness of the word
[24:56] that's come which is the mystery of
[24:58] redemption which is the planner
[25:00] redemption which is the book of
[25:02] redemption
[25:04] is everybody okay if i say it that way
[25:07] because like i say when i was looking at
[25:08] it i thought what is the book of
[25:09] redemption it's a mysterious book
[25:12] remember i told you that
[25:14] let me read the quote where brother
[25:15] brown said it that wasn't my quote it's
[25:17] his quote
[25:19] if i can find it amongst all this
[25:22] the reach between the seven church ages
[25:25] and the seven seals i don't know if he's
[25:26] got it i got
[25:28] i gave it to him at the last minute
[25:30] let me read it
[25:31] now but
[25:32] it is a book a mysterious book
[25:36] it's a book of redemption
[25:39] we'll get into that in a little while
[25:41] and now we know that this book of
[25:42] redemption will not be thoroughly
[25:44] understood
[25:46] thoroughly understood
[25:49] it's probed at through the six church
[25:51] ages does everybody agree with that
[25:53] luther probed at it
[25:54] but it was all god gave him in that hour
[25:56] was justification as if he never died
[25:59] if he never did it
[26:01] brother ram said if luther would have
[26:02] lived on he'd have been right here with
[26:04] us
[26:05] like i told you this morning if luther
[26:07] and wesley would have lived on they'd
[26:08] have been sitting right here in lulu
[26:09] georgia
[26:11] or a message church just like
[26:13] does everybody agree with that
[26:15] because their name was on the lamb's
[26:17] book of life they will come to the
[26:19] fullness of the word
[26:21] i hope everybody understands what i'm
[26:22] saying
[26:24] it's probed that through six church ages
[26:26] but at the end when the seventh angel
[26:28] begins to sound his mystery he winds up
[26:30] all
[26:31] of the loose ends that though these
[26:33] fellows probed at
[26:36] and the mysteries come down from god as
[26:39] the word of god
[26:41] is everybody okay with that exactly and
[26:44] reveals the entire the entire
[26:47] revelation of god right the mystery of
[26:50] god the entire fullest of the word will
[26:52] be made known in this hour right
[26:55] all the mysteries serpent seed and
[26:57] whatever more is to be revealed
[27:00] brother brown when he opened the seals
[27:02] he said now we know the truth of serpent
[27:04] seed
[27:06] and i thought
[27:09] what was the mystery still around
[27:10] serpent seed does that make he preached
[27:13] in 59 did we understand serpent seed we
[27:16] thought we did
[27:18] well yeah i hear you we'll forgive you
[27:21] for that brother
[27:23] my daughter used to call him pedestrians
[27:25] instead of presbyterian
[27:27] she couldn't get that big word out
[27:30] so so i hope you understand this serpent
[27:33] seed whatever more will be revealed
[27:35] even brother branham when he preached
[27:37] serpent seat in 59 there's still some
[27:38] loose ends to it
[27:40] right because why the mystery of
[27:42] redemption the book of redemption was
[27:45] not totally open yet in its entirety
[27:48] does everybody agree with that now
[27:50] brother branham could absolutely explain
[27:52] the book of life the lamb's book of life
[27:54] fullness of the word all these things
[27:56] now he can explain them now that's
[27:58] exactly right
[27:59] right it could become a revelation to us
[28:01] because why the entire book was open
[28:04] it was the fullness of the word
[28:07] so like i say now that we understand
[28:08] there's a fullness you you you know
[28:10] there's an exodus
[28:12] but you ought to be the thing that's
[28:13] going to get you out of here is the
[28:14] fullness of the word
[28:16] the mysteries is what it is going to get
[28:18] you out of here
[28:19] and if you say mystery around some
[28:21] churches they don't want you to preach
[28:22] it here
[28:23] message churches are that way you go to
[28:26] them you know what they want they want
[28:27] you to hug them and tell them how much
[28:28] you love them
[28:30] and i believe you all love them
[28:33] but the truth is what's going to set you
[28:34] free
[28:36] these mysteries made known as the
[28:38] fullness that's what redemption is all
[28:39] about
[28:41] that's what's going to take you in is
[28:42] these mysteries
[28:44] but you know they i i
[28:46] just oh
[28:47] preachers i'm like moses i'm like jesus
[28:50] when it comes to preachers i practically
[28:52] lose my mind thinking about it
[28:54] don't you
[28:56] don't it don't it what what's your
[28:58] biggest problem preachers
[29:00] what's my biggest problem preachers
[29:03] it's the truth preachers that's my big
[29:05] problem
[29:08] okay
[29:09] better get off that i'll preach a whole
[29:12] message on preachers
[29:14] i preached it one time i put i put the
[29:16] title preachers and a question mark
[29:17] behind it
[29:19] is that a fair message
[29:21] i question a lot of them
[29:25] okay
[29:27] so we and another thing that when i
[29:28] started doing this book of redemption
[29:31] all the pieces started getting together
[29:33] on me
[29:34] the third pull the thunders the seals
[29:37] all these things started coming together
[29:39] and i thought wow
[29:40] i never realized how really connected
[29:43] everything is
[29:44] and there's different parts to it can i
[29:46] say it that way i want to read something
[29:48] brother brown said
[29:51] let's see here
[29:54] i got two of them how did i get two of
[29:56] them
[29:57] anyway let me read it anointed one's at
[29:59] the end time notice the very day with
[30:01] this messenger now not when he starts
[30:05] but when he begins to declare his
[30:07] message the first pool healing second
[30:09] full prophecy remember i told you what
[30:11] that was
[30:12] there's a voice in those two don't you
[30:14] ever forget it they speak amen right
[30:19] third pool the opening of the word right
[30:22] so brother branham is identifying what
[30:24] the third pool is
[30:26] he said the third pull
[30:28] is the opening of the word
[30:31] does everybody agree with that
[30:32] it's pretty easy when you read uh
[30:35] revelation 10 7 it says in the days of
[30:38] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[30:40] shall begin to sound the mystery of god
[30:43] well the mystery of some is unknown
[30:45] if god's going to declare something and
[30:47] give a revelation it's the opening of
[30:49] the word right so i can without a shadow
[30:52] of a doubt i can take revelation 10 7 to
[30:55] declare to you that's the third pool
[30:58] is that okay
[30:59] it's the opening of the word
[31:02] is that right
[31:04] mysteries revealed
[31:07] but the only way the prophet can be
[31:09] vindicated is by the word that's why i
[31:11] went to malachi 4 today
[31:13] the only way he can prove to you that
[31:16] brother branham is a prophet is by the
[31:17] word amen the word we use is this one
[31:20] that i read to you revelation 10 7 is a
[31:23] vindication of william branham
[31:26] does everybody understand that brother
[31:28] branham was vindicated in the word
[31:30] another one i can use this revel or
[31:33] saint luke 17 30.
[31:35] right the revealing of the son of man
[31:38] what is son of man it's a prophet amen
[31:41] what was revealing a prophet has been
[31:43] revealed in this generation
[31:46] as it was in the days of noah as it was
[31:49] in the days of sodom
[31:52] is that what the scripture says
[31:54] remember what happened in sodom there
[31:55] was a discernment given what happened in
[31:58] this hour that discernment shows you
[31:59] we're in the days of sodom
[32:02] we're at the end of the gentile
[32:03] dispensation is what it's telling you by
[32:06] the word
[32:07] there's a revealing of the son of man in
[32:09] this hour
[32:11] god has thoroughly revealed this prophet
[32:13] and this hour had vindicated him in the
[32:14] word
[32:15] that's why i wanted to read to you
[32:17] malachi 4.
[32:18] these guys that go off on the internet
[32:20] you've been in a message 30 years and go
[32:21] off what they look at is brother branham
[32:23] the natural part of him
[32:25] and that's why i told you look the
[32:27] natural part of brother man was a
[32:29] failure
[32:30] the natural part of moses of failure but
[32:32] you show me thus saith the lord the word
[32:34] where he was off
[32:35] they won't come to that
[32:37] they nitpick this little thing this
[32:39] little thing but they can't nitpick thus
[32:41] saith the lord
[32:43] can they
[32:45] look my face rhino final resting place
[32:47] is in the word
[32:48] i see william branham not the name
[32:52] but i see the by the revelation i see
[32:54] brother brandon was the fulfillment of
[32:55] malachi 4.
[32:57] i see brother man it was the fulfillment
[32:59] of revelation 10 7.
[33:01] i see 10 1-6 was the mighty angel that
[33:04] come down
[33:06] a cloud a rainbow what come down in 1963
[33:09] on sunset mountain a cloud
[33:11] is that right what is it what is a
[33:14] rainbow it's a covenant
[33:16] he said he was going to open it in the
[33:18] end time and he's done it
[33:20] god confirmed his word to us that's what
[33:22] that rainbow is it's a covenant
[33:25] that god made a promise that he's here
[33:27] to keep the promise
[33:30] right
[33:31] amen
[33:33] so brother branham was absolutely
[33:34] vindicated in the word okay
[33:37] so we understand the third pool is the
[33:38] opening of the word
[33:40] now that's what i was telling you about
[33:41] the three exodus prophets they all had a
[33:43] third pool the third poll was always the
[33:45] voice of the sign right
[33:48] right
[33:49] it was it was the voice is what it was
[33:52] right what is a voice it's a thunder all
[33:54] right did brother rem say it thunder's
[33:55] the voice of god
[33:57] amen
[33:58] so we've had the thunders in this hour
[33:59] did everybody understand that amen
[34:02] we've had the mysteries it's been
[34:03] revealed to a group of people okay
[34:09] i don't know why i got two of them
[34:13] i want to read something to you
[34:15] this will kind of blow your mind maybe
[34:16] not this guy preaches it so
[34:20] in the ephesian church that's what as
[34:21] daniel heard the seven thunders right
[34:25] we read that we read john heard them
[34:27] didn't write them
[34:28] you know daniel did what did daniel
[34:30] write what the sixth full purpose of
[34:32] daniel
[34:34] he heard the same thing right
[34:36] you mean he heard the same thunders he's
[34:38] heard the same redemptive plan of god
[34:41] yes
[34:42] that's why people they're not willing to
[34:44] take daniel's 70 week all it is is
[34:46] redemption to the jews that's right
[34:47] that's right that's what i was telling
[34:49] you this morning brother branham states
[34:50] that daniel heard the thunders amen so
[34:53] when daniel wrote the sixth full purpose
[34:55] of
[34:56] right right of gabriel right
[34:59] or sixth full purpose again whatever
[35:01] says it i'm so messed up but anyway does
[35:03] everybody understand that right well
[35:05] what is it it's redemption it's all it
[35:06] is it's thunders what is it's the
[35:08] mysteries
[35:10] he heard them daniel but he had to seal
[35:12] him up just like john did
[35:14] does anybody know daniel means judge
[35:18] you know he came on sunset mountain as a
[35:19] white wigged one do you know who wears a
[35:21] white wig a judge
[35:24] right what did he come as in this hour
[35:26] judge
[35:28] he's here right now the judge is here
[35:33] as daniel heard the seven thunders and
[35:35] forbidden and john heard the voices and
[35:37] this book was sealed and the back of the
[35:39] book was sealed with seven
[35:41] seals but in the days of these seals to
[35:42] be opened the mystery of god would be
[35:45] finished in other words god would be
[35:46] known to his church
[35:48] not in three people but as one person
[35:52] the mystery of god would be revealed and
[35:54] when that was completely revealed
[35:56] then the seven mysteries would open to
[35:59] the church
[36:01] is that what i said this morning in
[36:02] revelation chapter four there was one on
[36:04] the throne
[36:05] there was one door open once we got that
[36:08] then we got to go to chapter five the
[36:10] book of redemption does everybody
[36:11] understand that the open book right so
[36:14] once he thoroughly had vindicated and
[36:17] opened that up who jesus was
[36:19] now we could move to the mysteries right
[36:22] christ the mystery of god revealed
[36:26] it's like somebody told me the other day
[36:27] i said you know what happened in the
[36:28] third pool of jesus
[36:30] ministry he went down and preached to
[36:32] the lost souls right you know what he
[36:34] did he said i'm christ the mystery of
[36:36] god revealed sure
[36:38] that's what he preached didn't he he
[36:40] said i'm the one that abraham talked
[36:42] about
[36:43] i'm the one that noah talked about and
[36:45] you rejected it you were the lost souls
[36:47] that didn't take the word in your hour
[36:50] so he went right down there and preached
[36:51] christ the mystery of god revealed
[36:54] right
[36:55] that's exactly what he did
[36:58] okay
[36:59] let me see the next quote here
[37:03] uh in his presence 620909
[37:06] i'm gonna start down or i'm never gonna
[37:10] well maybe and i hate to cut and paste
[37:12] quotes
[37:14] you know you get a quote i only need a
[37:15] little bit and i still can't do that
[37:17] it just drives me nuts
[37:20] and now we now we will just as soon as i
[37:23] can i will announce when we are going to
[37:25] start let me go down now i think if the
[37:27] lord willing i want to take the next
[37:29] time that we start on the seven seals of
[37:31] revelations and the seven natural seals
[37:34] and then if we got through it in time
[37:36] take the seven seals on the back of the
[37:38] book
[37:39] see now that may take a little time
[37:41] there's seven seals that's open there's
[37:44] seven plagues seven trumpets all those
[37:46] sevens and them seals we could take
[37:48] first but then on the back of the book
[37:50] is sealed with seven seals daniel heard
[37:52] the voice as the thunders
[37:56] voice of god thunder
[37:57] and was forbidden to write it god john
[37:59] was forbidden to write it but it was
[38:01] sealed on the back side of the book that
[38:03] is after all the mysteries of the book
[38:06] has been given out and revealed
[38:08] so i'm going to just sum this up if i
[38:10] can can i sum this up over here on the
[38:12] board to kind of get where i really want
[38:14] to go
[38:15] the book of redemption sealed this thing
[38:17] up does everybody understand
[38:19] it was the plan of redemption is what
[38:20] seals that thing up
[38:23] everybody agree with that that's what
[38:25] the book of redemption is it's the plan
[38:27] of redemption and the plan of redemption
[38:29] sealed all those names up
[38:33] that's what the book of redemption is
[38:35] okay
[38:36] we think of it as like a physical book
[38:38] that's not what he's talking about it's
[38:40] a mysterious book
[38:42] it's mysteries it's the plan redemption
[38:45] is what it is
[38:46] that's what sealed the book of life up
[38:49] okay
[38:50] so what happened was what was that he
[38:52] was going to open the book the plan of
[38:54] redemption to a group of people on the
[38:56] earth
[38:57] at the time of the seventh angel
[39:00] now look at it the first seal what did
[39:02] the first seal cover
[39:04] first two church ages
[39:07] didn't it
[39:08] so the
[39:10] the book of revelations we said was the
[39:12] book of redemption is that's one right
[39:14] the first thing brother man said first
[39:16] that has to be revealed is jesus christ
[39:19] the first chapter what does it do
[39:21] it reveals the deity of jesus christ
[39:24] the first thing you've got to see in
[39:25] this redemption that we're at now is who
[39:27] jesus is right
[39:31] go read it revelation 1 go read it see
[39:33] if it don't it's seven-fold personage of
[39:35] jesus christ amen
[39:37] doesn't it it reveals the fullness of
[39:39] jesus christ amen it tells you the
[39:41] redeemer
[39:42] okay
[39:43] the second one is the church ages
[39:46] the first four seals are for what the
[39:48] church ages
[39:50] so we know the mystery
[39:52] of how god's going to redeem people
[39:54] through the church ages
[39:56] the book of redemption was the plan how
[39:58] god was going to redeem him in the
[40:00] ephesian age the smyrna age all the way
[40:03] to laodicean age does everybody agree
[40:05] with that the first four seals apply to
[40:08] what the church ages
[40:11] the fifth seal applies to the jews
[40:14] who were blinded by the father does
[40:16] everybody agree with that
[40:18] the jews were blinded in part till the
[40:20] fullness of the gentile dispensation
[40:22] come in does everybody agree with that
[40:25] statement
[40:26] so the jews were blinded
[40:29] the only thing they could see the father
[40:31] so when the jews died from the time of
[40:33] calvary
[40:35] right
[40:36] until god goes back to the jews they're
[40:38] under the
[40:39] father's altar
[40:41] right
[40:42] for those first four seals
[40:44] now that fifth seal
[40:46] jesus christ comes to those that are
[40:48] under that altar the martyr seal
[40:50] remember i told you this last time i was
[40:51] here
[40:53] what does jesus do
[40:55] he gives them a garment
[40:57] now i don't know about you in your bible
[40:58] but the garments the holy ghost
[41:01] i don't believe those guys are going to
[41:02] the white throne either no
[41:04] if you got the holy ghost why would you
[41:06] ever go to the white throne
[41:09] now i don't have brother brahm saying
[41:11] that but i can read between the lines
[41:13] i've got 101 quotes where brother graham
[41:15] said if you're in love with him
[41:17] my wife's here i can write a letter and
[41:19] give it to sister june and she'd read it
[41:20] and go okay be like reading the
[41:22] newspaper wouldn't it yeah
[41:24] huh
[41:26] if i gave my
[41:27] love letter that i wrote to my wife to
[41:28] you women you'd go okay
[41:30] but my wife can read between the lines
[41:32] she knows me
[41:33] can i say it different she loves me
[41:36] when you love each other you read
[41:37] between the lines
[41:38] how many of you in a marriage your wife
[41:40] will say something you know really what
[41:41] she's saying
[41:43] i've been around my wife long enough i
[41:44] can tell you exactly if she's mad at me
[41:46] or not
[41:49] here the other day i said are you mad at
[41:50] me no i'm not mad at you
[41:53] finally two hours later i got to admit
[41:54] she was mad at me
[41:57] now you wouldn't know that you say okay
[41:59] she's not mad she said she's not mad i
[42:00] knew better yeah
[42:02] i know her i love her i can read between
[42:05] the lines
[42:06] right aren't you that way
[42:08] so this love letter the bible that we
[42:10] got we read between the lines
[42:14] yeah i want to tell you we do we read
[42:16] look when brother branham said that
[42:18] jesus christ went down to the lower
[42:20] regions kicked the devil in the seat of
[42:22] the pants and took the keys where are
[42:23] you getting that in the bible
[42:25] can you read that in the bible where he
[42:26] kicked me to see the bands took the keys
[42:30] did jesus read between the lines
[42:33] did brother adam read between the lines
[42:34] amen
[42:36] huh
[42:37] then we get mad at preachers and i'm
[42:38] going to tell you this this is what you
[42:40] got to be preachers if you oh you know
[42:42] what you're not saying what's said on
[42:43] tape brother claude because you don't
[42:45] say it exactly like brother branham
[42:47] jesus jesus
[42:51] nicodemus iii
[42:52] he told nicodemus or no i'm sorry i said
[42:55] that the other day at church too saint
[42:56] john
[42:57] 3. i said that in church the other day
[43:02] you tell i'm not god i make mistakes see
[43:06] but
[43:07] saint john 3 quit it st
[43:09] saint john 3 nicodemus
[43:12] jesus told nicodemus you must be born
[43:14] again show me that verbatim quote in the
[43:17] bible
[43:19] he told nicodemus he said nicodemus
[43:21] you're a leader you're a ruler you ought
[43:23] to know these things
[43:25] you ought to have a revelation of what
[43:27] i'm telling you about
[43:29] and this guy comes and said can i crawl
[43:30] back into my mother's womb boy that's a
[43:32] revelation isn't it really
[43:35] not right
[43:36] so i'm going to tell you where
[43:38] jesus said you ought to know it it means
[43:40] it's already wrote in the word right
[43:42] exactly so where did he go you got to go
[43:44] to ezekiel 36 to get this one he said
[43:46] you'll receive a new heart a spirit a
[43:47] new heart there's the new birth
[43:50] why didn't nicodemus because he
[43:51] paraphrased it and they were so stuck on
[43:55] running a pen through a word you had to
[43:57] say verbatim the word that's the problem
[44:00] with some preachers in this message you
[44:01] can't read between the lines you can't
[44:03] paraphrase i tell the church if you read
[44:06] between the lines and you paraphrase and
[44:07] you keep the continuity of the message
[44:08] in the word i'll amen you all the way
[44:11] cause i got the holy ghost and knows if
[44:13] you're saying the truth or not exactly
[44:15] we're like a bunch of programmed monkeys
[44:17] and rats in the message
[44:19] boy i mean come on people get a
[44:21] revelation amen that's right
[44:27] brother madam said if you're not in the
[44:28] quotes if you're not in a message you're
[44:30] not in your bible you'll miss it right
[44:32] this guy ain't going to do all your
[44:34] studying for you ain't going to do all
[44:35] your praying either he's not a pope
[44:38] that's what a pope does he don't want
[44:40] you to read your bible he don't want you
[44:41] to study he'll do all that for you
[44:44] all he wants you to do is a bunch of
[44:45] hail mary's yeah well that goes a long
[44:47] way he's doing it geez but that's the
[44:50] truth
[44:52] come on people you got the holy ghost
[44:54] one of the nine spirits is discernment
[44:56] you know what discernment is you're
[44:57] supposed to be able to judge if it's
[44:58] right or not
[45:00] when a preacher comes up here you're
[45:01] supposed to have enough discernment in
[45:03] your life
[45:04] that you ought to know if he's telling
[45:06] has anybody ever sat there and heard a
[45:07] preacher or something inside he go ding
[45:08] ding ding ding ding
[45:09] am i the only one that's ever
[45:10] experienced that you know what that is
[45:12] discernment
[45:14] god has put alarm in you do you know
[45:16] where that guy ain't preaching you the
[45:17] truth
[45:19] it's the truth we we got the gifts
[45:21] working people are looking for gifts
[45:23] they're here
[45:24] we got discernment we can judge judge
[45:27] yourselves lest you be judged we got
[45:29] wisdom we got understanding what you've
[45:31] been talking about we got a revelation
[45:34] that's faith by the way that's one of
[45:36] the gifts did you know that amen you got
[45:38] the gifts working here
[45:40] but what we want to do is we want to do
[45:42] the lesser gifts speaking in tongues
[45:45] right
[45:47] that's what most people want
[45:50] that look i want the greater gifts
[45:53] that's what honestly that's what i want
[45:56] now i'm not going to do anybody with
[45:58] tongues and stuff like somebody speaking
[45:59] fine but you better do it in order
[46:01] we got quotes on that
[46:03] right that's right
[46:05] okay
[46:07] it's the truth
[46:09] so what i what i what i can do is by the
[46:12] book of redemption i can tie
[46:14] the book of redemption is the opening of
[46:16] the word that's what it is
[46:19] it's the book of redemption being opened
[46:21] to a people and the book of it is the
[46:23] complete
[46:24] full
[46:25] fullness of the word that's given in
[46:27] this hour
[46:28] i don't guess i don't probe anymore
[46:32] like i told him the other day i was
[46:34] preaching this let me you want to hear
[46:36] my song i know i know i know i know i
[46:38] know i know i know i know i know i know
[46:41] i know i know i know
[46:43] amen don't you
[46:46] don't you know what the book of
[46:47] revelation is
[46:49] don't you know what the mysteries are
[46:50] haven't it been taught here
[46:52] isn't this a preacher that's been
[46:54] preaching you the mysteries the book of
[46:55] redemption the fullness of the word
[46:58] so a preacher and a message i had a
[47:00] preacher i'm oh this makes me sick i
[47:02] could jump out a window i had a preacher
[47:05] come to my church one time we were
[47:06] eating pizza together he said i don't
[47:08] preach the mysteries at my church
[47:11] i like to gagged on the pizza i just
[47:13] stared at him i thought
[47:17] you don't preach the mysteries
[47:21] he's not preaching rapturing faith
[47:23] he's not punching the bishop preaching
[47:26] the book of redemption that allows the
[47:27] people to see their names on the book
[47:31] does everybody got what i'm saying there
[47:34] would you do me a favor brother joseph
[47:36] go to that quote in 63 and question
[47:38] answers on the seals
[47:42] 63.
[47:44] he's awake back here isn't he
[47:49] i know i'm
[47:50] teasing i'm not known for my patience
[47:53] but i'm not going to ask god for it
[47:55] tribulation worketh patience
[47:58] if i pray for patience i always say god
[47:59] i want patience right now
[48:02] because whatever you say it'll be that
[48:03] way so if you ever pray for patience you
[48:05] better be careful
[48:07] okay let's see 3.95
[48:12] is that the one i wanted
[48:15] uh i don't think that's the one i wanted
[48:22] no that's not the one i want the ones
[48:24] that's questioned answers on the seals
[48:27] well thank you
[48:38] yeah move it up to 8a
[48:41] and brother
[48:42] is it true that every jew born since
[48:44] christ that came in the world to be
[48:46] saved
[48:47] no nothing will be saved only those
[48:49] names who were put on the lamb's book of
[48:51] life
[48:54] before the foundation of the world jew
[48:56] or gentile see
[48:58] that's all the book holds that mystery
[49:03] and the book is only unfolding it now
[49:05] amen
[49:06] the book he's talking about the book of
[49:08] redemption that's what's unfolding to
[49:10] the people now look
[49:12] and the book is only unfolding now not
[49:14] each one's name but what the mystery of
[49:17] the book is exactly what it is the book
[49:20] of redemption is giving you the the
[49:23] the revelation of what the plan of
[49:25] redemption is and you've you can see
[49:28] your name on the book of life
[49:31] if you don't get the plan how are you
[49:33] going to get your name there
[49:34] has anybody ever worked in a project at
[49:36] work do they ever put you on a project
[49:39] that you're not a part of the plan
[49:43] right if you've got jet a and jet b and
[49:45] you're going to assemble jet a they
[49:46] don't give you the directions to plan
[49:48] for jet b
[49:50] right
[49:51] so god has given you the book of
[49:52] redemption which is the plan the mystery
[49:55] of redemption because why your name's on
[49:57] the book of life
[49:59] the la i'm gonna go the book of life
[50:01] you're the one that's gonna receive the
[50:03] fullness of this hour and because you've
[50:05] got the mystery of it that calls your
[50:08] name you know your name's in the book of
[50:10] life
[50:11] look in chapter 5 what was it that john
[50:14] got
[50:15] he says he looked around he said all was
[50:18] lost
[50:19] no one was worthy what did he get a
[50:22] revelation a mystery was revealed to him
[50:25] right
[50:26] and the elder said behold the lamb of
[50:29] god did take away the
[50:33] huh the sin of the word no does that be
[50:35] it but he turned around he seen a lamb
[50:38] the flesh of god that's what he said
[50:40] that god had come from the flesh and
[50:42] died for us
[50:44] he got the mystery of the redemption
[50:47] that's what was open and because that
[50:49] book of redemption was open he could see
[50:51] his name on the book
[50:54] if the mystery is not made known to you
[50:56] you don't the mystery that your name is
[50:58] there's not been revealed to you
[51:01] that's the whole purpose of the book of
[51:03] redemption being revealed in this hour
[51:05] because we're at the end of it and
[51:06] there's a people that needs to get the
[51:08] revelation sure
[51:10] right
[51:11] and we're the people that gets that
[51:13] we got the whole plan or we know the
[51:15] whole plan of redemption does everybody
[51:18] understand the first seal
[51:20] that was the redemptive plan for the
[51:22] ephesus and smyrna age do you agree
[51:27] right
[51:28] we understand how the holy spirit and
[51:30] the antichrist worked in that hour
[51:33] the people that were under the second
[51:34] they got the revelation of what that
[51:36] seal was
[51:38] even even paul said there's ana there's
[51:41] people here there's there's people
[51:43] working in your midst now who's not
[51:44] saying what i said
[51:46] brother bam said in the days of paul
[51:48] they put their finger on said you're not
[51:49] saying what paul said
[51:51] is that what he said
[51:53] you're not saying if an angel
[51:56] right
[51:59] or a preacher him it says him not her
[52:01] that's why we don't believe in preachers
[52:02] by the way
[52:04] he said if they preach any of the gospel
[52:06] and i preach you let them be accursed
[52:08] because paul knew he had the right
[52:09] revelation for that hour and you
[52:10] couldn't add to that revelation you
[52:12] couldn't take away from it
[52:13] and we've had the right revelation given
[52:16] this hour and i can't add to what
[52:17] brother bam said and i can't take away
[52:18] from it
[52:20] if i do then my name's not here folks
[52:24] everybody here this that book of
[52:25] redemption calls
[52:27] my name the mystery of it and it tells
[52:30] me what that my name is right where it's
[52:31] at
[52:35] it's the truth
[52:37] if you ain't lining up with the message
[52:38] it tells you exactly where you're at
[52:40] right
[52:41] come on you know where you're at you
[52:43] know
[52:44] nobody has to tell you where you're at
[52:46] you don't have to tell them where
[52:47] they're at they know where you're at
[52:49] right you know if you got the baptism
[52:51] oligos you got the fullness the person
[52:53] right
[52:54] see we don't have a temporal gift here
[52:55] we got a person in the holy ghost living
[52:57] in us
[52:58] is that right
[53:00] the person's living in you now
[53:02] exactly
[53:04] does everybody the person is the
[53:05] fullness of the word amen
[53:08] it's the fullness the word that's living
[53:10] in you now that's what's going to take
[53:11] you out justification ain't going to get
[53:13] you in the rapture
[53:14] sanctification ain't gonna get you in
[53:16] the rapture
[53:17] but the person
[53:19] the temporal gift of the baptism holy
[53:20] ghost thing will get you in the rapture
[53:23] the person is what's gonna get you in a
[53:24] rapture
[53:26] somebody told me one day i said there's
[53:27] only one going to make it in the rapture
[53:29] they said what are you talking about
[53:32] right
[53:33] there's only eight that got raptured one
[53:36] it's those that are baptized into the
[53:38] body of jesus christ it's the ones that
[53:39] have the person of jesus christ that's
[53:41] the one going in the rapture
[53:43] that's who the rapture is for does
[53:45] everybody understand that
[53:46] but the one that's a rapture for is the
[53:48] ones that the book and i keep saying
[53:50] over and over i want you to catch what
[53:51] i'm saying
[53:53] it's the ones who had to have had the
[53:55] plan of redemption
[53:56] and that book of redemption was sealed
[53:58] with seven seals
[54:00] everybody agree with that seven seals is
[54:02] what it was what it was sealed with
[54:06] okay we know what the first four are
[54:08] through the church ages fifth seal
[54:10] facile jew right
[54:12] ones that were blinded god's gonna give
[54:13] him god's gonna give him a garment
[54:15] if you tell me they're going to the
[54:17] white throne i don't get it something's
[54:19] wrong with my thinking
[54:21] the 144 000 are they gonna go to the
[54:23] white they're gonna be in the millennium
[54:24] right right right
[54:26] aren't they
[54:27] sure they ain't gonna go to the white
[54:28] throne
[54:29] why they're gonna get same baptism
[54:31] oligos you got right
[54:33] they're gonna receive the fullness of
[54:34] the word like you got glory they're
[54:35] gonna get daniel 70 weeks
[54:38] they're going to get the six-fold
[54:39] purpose of daniel's and it's going to
[54:41] open up that they're the ones that are
[54:42] part of it
[54:44] just like the six seals where what six
[54:46] is redemption it's told you that your
[54:48] name's under there that you're a part of
[54:50] that plan
[54:52] come on that's what reveals a name to
[54:54] you the book of redemption amen glory
[54:57] right
[54:58] amen
[54:59] so we understand we understand what sin
[55:01] seal is coming of the lord right is that
[55:03] what brotherhood said
[55:04] the end of all things another thing he
[55:06] said with it don't have a problem with
[55:07] that
[55:08] sixth seal
[55:10] look under the sixth seal the hundred
[55:11] forty four thousand will be redeemed
[55:13] right
[55:14] you agree all right
[55:16] what's going to happen the the the
[55:18] foolish virgins the ones that are
[55:20] justified and you know they're not going
[55:22] to take a rapture the foolish virgins
[55:24] they're virgins but they didn't go all
[55:26] the way they didn't get their lamps full
[55:27] of oil
[55:28] right so they could be in a justified
[55:30] sanctified state and miss the rapture
[55:32] does it mean they're lost no
[55:35] they'll be getting granted eternal life
[55:36] at the white throne because why their
[55:38] name's not taken off the book alive you
[55:40] reject any part of this plan you are
[55:42] right yes sir
[55:45] they only seen it so far you agree
[55:48] brother bam said you reject this message
[55:49] you die and go on to hell exactly amen
[55:52] that's what he said that ain't what i
[55:53] you know that's not me that's him
[55:55] does everybody understand that
[55:59] okay
[56:00] i know it may be a little different or
[56:02] maybe it didn't i'm sure he's preached
[56:03] it before
[56:05] okay amen
[56:09] let's go back to the third i'm gonna go
[56:10] to the third pool a little bit and then
[56:11] i'll finish it what time do i have
[56:13] brother wade 3 30
[56:15] 5 minutes
[56:17] this is this is his standard deal
[56:21] wow
[56:22] but does everybody understand the third
[56:24] pool is the opening of the word right
[56:27] to save time and not have to read and
[56:29] you put it up there
[56:30] put it up
[56:31] where the third pull
[56:33] is three parts in the seventh seal
[56:35] you've got that quote brother joseph i
[56:36] think
[56:38] right
[56:43] third pull the seven seal quote that i
[56:45] gave you
[56:46] where the third pull is three parts
[56:52] he's asleep at the wheel again
[56:55] oh i'm giving him a hard time okay
[56:58] the first i'm gonna go down a little bit
[57:00] first full healing second pull
[57:01] prophesying third pull
[57:03] the opening of the word the mysteries
[57:04] revealed everybody understand
[57:07] the book
[57:08] no more there's no more higher order
[57:09] reveal the word than prophets but the
[57:11] only way
[57:12] the prophet can be vindicated by the
[57:14] word and remember the third pool was the
[57:16] opening of them seven seals
[57:19] so i can now point the third pool to
[57:22] revelation 10 beyond a shadow without
[57:24] okay that's right to reveal the hidden
[57:27] truth it's been sealed in the word do
[57:28] you see it
[57:30] is that the last one where's it says
[57:32] three yeah here
[57:35] where's the three things where did i
[57:37] miss it
[57:38] now there's three things we're going to
[57:40] say and i don't know if that's what i
[57:41] want either
[57:42] talking about three parts you know that
[57:44] one
[57:46] oh here hold on i got it i kind of gave
[57:48] them to him at the last hour so don't
[57:50] blame him
[57:54] let me read let me just quote it you
[57:56] guys know what you've been taught here
[57:57] sorry internet people
[58:01] what
[58:06] no
[58:07] no that's not the one i want
[58:10] when brother am talks there's three
[58:11] parts one of them happened yesterday
[58:13] yeah everybody know that one
[58:16] what happened yesterday was the sixth
[58:18] seal what was open redemption
[58:20] so what is the third pull it's the book
[58:23] of redemption open
[58:25] and that exactly points to revelation 10
[58:28] 7. does everybody agree with that
[58:30] the second part of the third pull is the
[58:33] coming of the lord
[58:36] the third part is it's unknown
[58:39] right
[58:42] okay
[58:44] this is there's three great things that
[58:45] goes with it and one unfolded today
[58:48] brother man is preaching the seventh
[58:49] seal so the one that unfolded it was the
[58:52] coming of the lord does everybody agree
[58:53] with that
[58:55] or yesterday the other one unfolded so
[58:57] yesterday what happened it was the look
[58:59] he finished the book of redemption does
[59:01] everybody understand that exactly
[59:03] and the only way you're going to see the
[59:04] book of redemption is if you see the
[59:05] redeemer right right
[59:07] come on that
[59:08] that's exactly what happened in chapter
[59:10] five
[59:11] when he seen the lion of the tribe and
[59:12] he said the bloody lamb
[59:15] he quit crying why did he quit crying
[59:17] not just because he's seen the redeemer
[59:20] but he got to see his name on the book
[59:22] so guess what the book of redemption was
[59:24] open to him where it was unsealed
[59:26] brother he could see his name there does
[59:28] everybody understand
[59:30] john's seen the whole plan
[59:34] he's seen it he heard it but he couldn't
[59:36] write it right
[59:37] okay
[59:38] it's the truth
[59:42] this is the third pool
[59:43] one unfolded today or yesterday the one
[59:45] unfold today and there's one thing that
[59:47] i cannot interpret because it's an
[59:48] unknown tongue you know why i can't
[59:50] interpret it it'll happen when it
[59:51] happens
[59:53] you speak the word and i'll perform it
[59:55] right now i want to explain something to
[59:56] you i want to get into the third pool
[59:57] and i'm going to finish it's going to be
[59:59] a little 20 minutes or so i'm going to
[1:00:01] hurry
[1:00:02] forgive me
[1:00:04] hey
[1:00:05] time should be no more how many believe
[1:00:06] that
[1:00:08] okay no more mysteries it's really what
[1:00:10] it is you get the
[1:00:12] real so let's talk about the third pool
[1:00:15] okay
[1:00:17] where was i at i lost myself when i made
[1:00:19] that statement
[1:00:21] unknown language thank you
[1:00:23] so does everybody understand that
[1:00:25] brother branham in 1956
[1:00:28] when he had the vision the tent vision
[1:00:30] i've got the notes but brother i got 40
[1:00:32] pages now i'm just going to get it out
[1:00:35] when he seen the vision the last thing
[1:00:36] the angel lord told him
[1:00:38] he said it won't be a public show
[1:00:42] and jesus and brother man said i don't
[1:00:44] understand why
[1:00:46] did you know he said that didn't he the
[1:00:48] angel lord said you remember this
[1:00:49] scripture
[1:00:50] in matthew 6 you go into your closet
[1:00:53] it'll be a secret thing right if you
[1:00:55] pray in secret i'll reward you openly is
[1:00:58] that what it says
[1:00:59] i tell people in our church if you want
[1:01:01] to know the third pool read matthew the
[1:01:03] whole chapter of six right
[1:01:05] did you know that
[1:01:07] let me show you
[1:01:09] it says in that chapter ask what you
[1:01:10] will it'll be given to you
[1:01:13] did you know that
[1:01:15] it tells you to go in your prayer closet
[1:01:17] and pray god will reward you openly
[1:01:20] it's humility
[1:01:21] right right the third pull that's still
[1:01:24] elijah that still small voice that's
[1:01:25] still there if you look at it's humble
[1:01:28] this is humble what we got does
[1:01:29] everybody you're not boastful with it
[1:01:32] you're not like the guy i told you and i
[1:01:33] want to go back to that that says i'm
[1:01:35] going to create me
[1:01:36] a a number six spicy chicken sandwich
[1:01:41] that is carnal folks you better you
[1:01:43] better
[1:01:45] you better get with a plan on that one
[1:01:47] you understand
[1:01:49] i mean people have almost taken the
[1:01:50] third pool and turned it into a fairy
[1:01:52] tale
[1:01:54] we tell our kids well it's the squirrels
[1:01:56] it's the little fishy
[1:01:59] but have we added the scripture to it
[1:02:02] your children's faith's final resting
[1:02:04] place is in the word
[1:02:06] you can talk about the squirrels
[1:02:09] you can talk about little fishy you can
[1:02:12] talk about sister hattie wright but have
[1:02:13] you put it back in the word right
[1:02:18] i know that sounds it sounds weird the
[1:02:20] way i'm saying it now i'm gonna go read
[1:02:21] it brother branham said there was five
[1:02:23] signs that thoroughly vindicated the
[1:02:25] third pool
[1:02:27] is that what he said you're amen in it
[1:02:28] he said it
[1:02:30] there's five signs
[1:02:33] so i'm gonna read some quotes and i'm
[1:02:34] gonna move on the first one was a little
[1:02:36] fishy does everybody agree with that
[1:02:40] now if you're here and you've never
[1:02:41] heard the message of how little say
[1:02:42] little fishy what's that do for you yeah
[1:02:45] yeah
[1:02:47] i'm true
[1:02:48] right
[1:02:49] what does that do for you if i say
[1:02:51] squirrels you'll think we fell off a
[1:02:53] rock
[1:02:55] what would you do if you weren't a
[1:02:57] message somebody said oh yeah brother
[1:02:58] brandon spoke a little fish he gave him
[1:03:00] back his life
[1:03:01] and he did
[1:03:03] but why can't you put the scripture with
[1:03:04] that right
[1:03:07] do you think they're gonna you tell them
[1:03:09] little fishies and they're gonna call
[1:03:10] the white wagon for you with a white
[1:03:12] jacket
[1:03:14] what we've done in the message we talk
[1:03:15] about the little fishy we talk about the
[1:03:17] squirrels we talk about hattie wright we
[1:03:19] talk about sister meaty we talk about
[1:03:21] those five signs that we're giving to
[1:03:23] thoroughly venice but we never put the
[1:03:24] word with it
[1:03:27] isn't it right we've been talking about
[1:03:28] that the last days a lot
[1:03:30] they'll take the quotes they never put
[1:03:31] it in the word
[1:03:33] that's what me and him as a preacher
[1:03:35] we're obligated to put them quotes and
[1:03:37] put them back into the word
[1:03:38] right i pro i told brother uh wade one
[1:03:41] time it always baffled me where brother
[1:03:43] brahm said you could have the baptism of
[1:03:45] the holy ghost on your spirit realm and
[1:03:46] die and go to hell every day of your
[1:03:48] life you could have it die and go to
[1:03:49] hell
[1:03:50] then brother branham i read a quote one
[1:03:52] day
[1:03:53] brother brahm said the children of
[1:03:54] israel ate manna that fell from heaven
[1:03:56] every day he said that manna was a type
[1:03:58] of the baptismal holy ghost
[1:04:01] and they everyone died
[1:04:04] you ever thought when you eat you know
[1:04:06] what eating does it the natural eating
[1:04:09] does nothing for your soul
[1:04:11] but you know what it does it helps your
[1:04:12] flesh it makes your spirit feel better
[1:04:16] his spirit feeling
[1:04:18] when you eat them four tacos for lunch
[1:04:20] tomorrow
[1:04:21] it'll make you feel so good
[1:04:25] so those people that ate that men are
[1:04:26] from heaven they had it all the way to a
[1:04:29] good feeling but they never went over
[1:04:31] and possessed the land and they died
[1:04:34] come on it's the truth people i'm
[1:04:35] telling you the truth so that's where
[1:04:37] brother brahm said you can have the
[1:04:39] baptism every day of your life on the
[1:04:41] spirit realm and die and go to hell
[1:04:43] right right you could come in here and
[1:04:46] hear this message every day of your life
[1:04:48] and die and go to hell
[1:04:49] if you don't get it down in that third
[1:04:51] area where that third pool operates then
[1:04:54] you can die and go to hell there you
[1:04:56] better get this thing all the way down
[1:04:57] to the third round
[1:05:00] okay
[1:05:02] let's talk about a little fishy first
[1:05:04] okay
[1:05:06] i want to read a quote here brother adam
[1:05:07] said
[1:05:09] brother man has talked about all these
[1:05:10] five signs in my new ministry okay
[1:05:14] but i told you you see how the third
[1:05:15] pool connects with the opening of the
[1:05:17] word right
[1:05:18] so these little stories that we've heard
[1:05:20] and we tell them to our kids
[1:05:22] do you not realize that these five
[1:05:24] things are the opening of the word to
[1:05:26] brother branham
[1:05:29] right
[1:05:30] so after this rather random down the
[1:05:31] line and anointed ones that he can say
[1:05:33] it's the opening of the word
[1:05:35] brother brandon finally got a revelation
[1:05:36] of what it was all about
[1:05:39] i told the church you know jesus he was
[1:05:41] sitting there and he said don't go to
[1:05:42] the gentiles
[1:05:44] go to the lost sheep of the house israel
[1:05:46] does everybody agree with that
[1:05:48] now matthew 16 he says go into all the
[1:05:50] world what change a dispensational
[1:05:52] change
[1:05:54] what happened in 1963 a dispensational
[1:05:57] change
[1:05:58] i want you guys know it something
[1:05:59] happened
[1:06:01] a dispensational change where brother
[1:06:03] and before they said you won't know it
[1:06:04] i'll leave take it to my grave then he
[1:06:06] turns around after 66 it's totally been
[1:06:07] vindicated we all know what it is now
[1:06:10] you see what i'm saying you say well
[1:06:12] brother bram said this over here will
[1:06:13] never will he'll leave here with it
[1:06:15] we'll never know what the third pool is
[1:06:17] how many heard preachers say that
[1:06:19] message preachers
[1:06:21] then he turns around after 63 the
[1:06:23] dispensational change and he says we
[1:06:25] know what it is it's been thoroughly
[1:06:27] vindicated there's been fine signs given
[1:06:29] us to know it right come on is that what
[1:06:31] he said you that know the message is
[1:06:33] exactly what he said
[1:06:35] it's a little fishy
[1:06:37] brother branham was sitting here waiting
[1:06:38] to pray for 300 children
[1:06:41] brother brahma was worried what am i
[1:06:43] going to do
[1:06:44] remember i read to you in the redemptive
[1:06:46] and it's not what you do it's what god's
[1:06:48] going to do for you
[1:06:50] quit thinking about you all the time
[1:06:53] all you got to do is get a revelation
[1:06:55] get this message packed into the third
[1:06:57] realm of you
[1:06:59] that's what you're responsible for god's
[1:07:01] gonna do the rest
[1:07:02] okay
[1:07:05] so brother bran was in the boat
[1:07:07] holy spirit moved down and said stand up
[1:07:10] said speak to that little fishy and
[1:07:11] she'll have its life again
[1:07:13] he'd been laying there dead for a half
[1:07:15] an hour right
[1:07:16] i'm going to go on here
[1:07:19] and brother man's talking about the
[1:07:20] little fishy now i want you to hear what
[1:07:22] he says and that stuck with me
[1:07:25] hard that i could hardly rest day and
[1:07:27] night this is 59 he did that spoke to
[1:07:29] the little fishing 57
[1:07:30] that's been two years ago and constantly
[1:07:32] has haunted at me
[1:07:34] and i say oh i can't say nothing about
[1:07:36] it remember the angel lord said don't
[1:07:38] say nothing about it don't explain this
[1:07:39] third pool
[1:07:41] okay so he didn't he didn't he didn't
[1:07:43] say anything
[1:07:45] oh i just couldn't say nothing about it
[1:07:46] for i can't place it in the atonement
[1:07:49] but listen
[1:07:51] now brother branham in 59 he's starting
[1:07:53] to explain it
[1:07:55] okay look what he says
[1:07:57] he said i couldn't explain it in
[1:07:59] atonement now go to your bible saint
[1:08:01] john 15 7.
[1:08:05] saint john 15 7.
[1:08:10] and i'm going to paraphrase what he
[1:08:11] probably didn't say it exactly verbatim
[1:08:13] but i want you to see it's in the word
[1:08:16] so brother i'm saying i couldn't explain
[1:08:18] it i couldn't put it in the atonement
[1:08:19] that little fish he's speaking it right
[1:08:21] but listen to what he says whatsoever
[1:08:23] you say it shall come to pass you can
[1:08:26] have what you say and i've stood here at
[1:08:28] this same pulpit and tried and run on
[1:08:30] the scripture and refrained from it
[1:08:32] and go back because i was afraid to use
[1:08:35] it
[1:08:36] you know why brother braham didn't use
[1:08:37] this scripture
[1:08:38] saint john 15 7 whatsoever you say it
[1:08:41] shall come to pass it's because he
[1:08:43] didn't see it in the atonement
[1:08:46] it wasn't open to him yet
[1:08:49] the word had not been opened to brother
[1:08:51] branham on that particular scripture
[1:08:53] does everybody understand that
[1:08:55] so until it's opened to him brother
[1:08:57] branham couldn't talk about it
[1:08:59] once it was opened to him he could he
[1:09:01] you know brother he said brother you
[1:09:03] always try to explain yourself right he
[1:09:06] said you can't teach pentecostal babies
[1:09:08] spiritual things right
[1:09:11] you cannot have faith
[1:09:14] you cannot have faith unless you know
[1:09:17] what you are doing
[1:09:19] brother brahm didn't have a revelation
[1:09:21] of that scripture he had tiptoed around
[1:09:23] it wouldn't even hardly mention it in
[1:09:24] the pulpit right right
[1:09:26] but when he did a little fishy it says
[1:09:28] the scripture says ask what you will in
[1:09:30] my name and i'll be it'll give me given
[1:09:32] to you brother branham that day stood up
[1:09:34] sat there and watched that little
[1:09:36] fishing for 30 minutes dead and he stood
[1:09:38] up and said little fishy i give your
[1:09:40] life in the name of jesus christ
[1:09:43] that scripture had been revealed to him
[1:09:46] had been opened the third pool is the
[1:09:49] opening of the word
[1:09:50] amen
[1:09:51] does everybody understand it's the
[1:09:53] opening of the word
[1:09:55] so the little fishy opened that word is
[1:09:57] that right brother
[1:09:59] now the squirrels
[1:10:01] brother brandon was sitting there and
[1:10:02] i'm going to read all the quote if you
[1:10:04] want to go look at him it's my new
[1:10:05] ministry e33
[1:10:07] but brother branham was sitting there
[1:10:10] and he went squirrel hunting
[1:10:12] it was so dry when he walked on the
[1:10:13] leaves the squirrels seen you heard you
[1:10:15] coming for a mile
[1:10:17] they were plowing the field next to it
[1:10:19] so he knew there wouldn't be no squirrel
[1:10:20] there right
[1:10:21] so brother branham sat out on a log and
[1:10:23] he said i've been wondering about a
[1:10:26] scripture right the scripture was
[1:10:28] whatsoever you say to this mountain to
[1:10:30] be moved from here to yonder
[1:10:33] if you believe it if you have faith in
[1:10:35] it it'll be moved where you say
[1:10:37] and only to say that is that if you move
[1:10:38] it from here cast into the ocean
[1:10:40] so that scripture gave a very specific
[1:10:43] location that that mountain was coming
[1:10:45] from this place to that place
[1:10:47] brother branham was meditating on that
[1:10:49] he said i don't understand that
[1:10:51] scripture
[1:10:52] it's always befuddled me it's always
[1:10:54] been a mystery to me
[1:10:56] well this one the lord said all of a
[1:10:57] sudden a voice come to him said what are
[1:10:59] you doing he said well i'm hunting
[1:11:01] squirrel he said well how many do you
[1:11:03] want he said three right he said where
[1:11:06] do you want him
[1:11:09] everybody get what i'm saying where do
[1:11:11] you want them i want them in a white
[1:11:13] poplar tree a red squirrel and a white
[1:11:15] tree boy that ain't going to happen if
[1:11:17] you hunt a squirrel that don't happen a
[1:11:19] red squirrel ain't going to get a white
[1:11:20] tree
[1:11:21] i could shoot them and i'm not nearly a
[1:11:23] good shot like brother branham
[1:11:25] they don't do it so he actually spoke
[1:11:28] the word and that squirrel was right
[1:11:30] where he said it would be and that say
[1:11:32] unto this mountain to be moved from
[1:11:33] yonder to there and it'll be moved
[1:11:35] what was god doing he was opening the
[1:11:37] word to your prophet he used the little
[1:11:40] squirrels to do it
[1:11:42] brother man didn't understand that word
[1:11:44] what was god doing opening the word to
[1:11:47] your prophet
[1:11:48] what is the third pull it's the opening
[1:11:51] of the word
[1:11:54] so we take these things we tell oh we
[1:11:55] talk about the little but we never tell
[1:11:57] them the scripture that's been opened
[1:11:58] with it
[1:11:59] it wasn't just speaking squirrels to be
[1:12:01] speaking it wasn't a frivolous windy
[1:12:04] sandwich it's god opening his word to
[1:12:06] his bride that's what it's the third
[1:12:09] pull is going to be all about opening
[1:12:11] the word to you to where ask what you
[1:12:13] will and it'll be given to you
[1:12:15] if you ask in the name of jesus christ
[1:12:17] for your children you can have them to a
[1:12:20] gentile you speak the word and he'll do
[1:12:22] it
[1:12:23] brother beat him in a church age book
[1:12:25] finally speak the word and i will
[1:12:26] perform it does anybody see any doubt in
[1:12:29] that
[1:12:30] don't look at the circumstances speak
[1:12:32] the word gentile man glory it doesn't
[1:12:35] say pray under the mind said speak to
[1:12:38] the mountain
[1:12:40] that's the third pull
[1:12:41] it's the opening of the word we'll ask
[1:12:43] what you will and i'll give it to you
[1:12:45] amen amen
[1:12:56] if you say to this mountain be plucked
[1:12:58] up and cast in the sea and shall not
[1:13:00] doubt in your heart
[1:13:01] this is by the way matthew if you want
[1:13:03] to write it down 17 20 21 21 and mark 11
[1:13:07] 23
[1:13:08] god was opening those scriptures to your
[1:13:10] problems
[1:13:11] amen he didn't understand it right
[1:13:14] and because his name was here
[1:13:17] has anybody got what i'm saying
[1:13:19] god was going to reveal the book to him
[1:13:23] how many of you people have looked at
[1:13:25] the scriptures i don't understand it
[1:13:26] this man preaches a week later right
[1:13:29] god's obligated to use bride
[1:13:32] the third pool is now working among you
[1:13:35] has thoroughly been made manifest
[1:13:37] the third pull to you is the opening of
[1:13:39] the word right
[1:13:41] all you got to do is say god i don't
[1:13:43] understand what brother samuel said and
[1:13:44] god's going to get it to you if your
[1:13:46] bride if your name's on the book he's
[1:13:48] obligated to you glory he's going to get
[1:13:50] it to you
[1:13:52] you know why he's going to do it it's
[1:13:54] not because i'm just some big shot he
[1:13:55] knew i would receive it if he gave it to
[1:13:57] me
[1:13:58] he knew if god would reveal it he knew i
[1:14:01] would take the whole thing
[1:14:06] i began to think of it about what he did
[1:14:08] with the prophets
[1:14:10] after i was speaking there for a while
[1:14:11] inside myself just thinking
[1:14:13] until i became so conscious of something
[1:14:15] near until i was talking to someone and
[1:14:17] something said to me
[1:14:19] that's any atonement for if a man or
[1:14:21] woman is so consecrated and surrendered
[1:14:23] to god you think the third pool's going
[1:14:25] to work with some of you guys
[1:14:27] you better get yourself consecrated
[1:14:28] close to god right because when this
[1:14:31] third pool brother man said what you've
[1:14:33] seen in part right it's going to lay
[1:14:35] dormant for a season but when the
[1:14:37] pressure comes down you'll see it in its
[1:14:39] fullness
[1:14:40] so if you don't get consecrated and
[1:14:41] close to god now when that third when
[1:14:43] that pressure comes down you're cooked
[1:14:46] right that's right you're in the gravy
[1:14:48] then you're in trouble
[1:14:50] you better i'm gonna tell you something
[1:14:52] i told my church now you mind if i tell
[1:14:53] them
[1:14:56] word tabernacle or whatever spoken word
[1:14:58] church
[1:14:58] you better get close to god where we're
[1:15:01] at now this thing's fixing to grind down
[1:15:04] and it's going to come so close if
[1:15:06] you're not close to him now you're no
[1:15:07] you're going to miss it right the third
[1:15:09] pool ain't going to work for you if
[1:15:10] you're not consecrated
[1:15:14] and something said to me that's in the
[1:15:15] atonement for if a man or woman is so
[1:15:17] consecrating surrender to god that god
[1:15:19] just moves in and uses their voice
[1:15:23] huh
[1:15:25] and isn't the man speaking
[1:15:27] it's god that's in him speaking
[1:15:30] i thought that's right right so the
[1:15:33] whole point brother branham even after
[1:15:34] god did it the first time remember
[1:15:35] there's six squirrels
[1:15:38] brother branham was still
[1:15:39] had a question in his mind about saying
[1:15:41] to this mountain right
[1:15:43] the first time he said okay i want you
[1:15:45] in this tree i want you that tree i want
[1:15:47] you in this tree
[1:15:48] and they were right
[1:15:50] the next time he did it which was on
[1:15:52] november the 7th i got the date on it
[1:15:54] and my new ministry gives the day
[1:15:56] brother madam said this it got so
[1:15:58] precise with the scripture saying to
[1:16:00] this mountain to be moved from here to
[1:16:01] there
[1:16:01] he said okay you want three squirrels
[1:16:03] where are they going to be one will come
[1:16:06] from the north one will come from this
[1:16:07] direction want to come did he give the
[1:16:09] direction
[1:16:10] precisely with that scripture a location
[1:16:13] you see right say this mountain will be
[1:16:15] moved from here to here that's a
[1:16:16] location
[1:16:18] brother baby said i want it in the north
[1:16:20] i want this one in the south i want this
[1:16:21] one over here right brother brown shot
[1:16:23] the first two right
[1:16:25] he then it got was getting so dark
[1:16:27] brother man couldn't see and he shot
[1:16:29] another a knot hole on a tree he thought
[1:16:32] well it was a squirrel
[1:16:33] remember it went around fell down
[1:16:35] brother man went to find it he couldn't
[1:16:37] find it brother battle said well i got
[1:16:38] to get back two's enough witness where
[1:16:40] the brahms spoke three right right yeah
[1:16:42] and not only did he speak three he spoke
[1:16:44] what direction they'd come from
[1:16:46] so he goes away brother brown's walking
[1:16:48] back the squirrel comes from the south
[1:16:50] he says it brother brown heaved up his
[1:16:51] gun was going to shoot it he said
[1:16:53] there's the third one the lord said
[1:16:54] didn't you say the third one will come
[1:16:56] from the north yeah he's going to shoot
[1:16:57] the ones in the south see how precise
[1:16:59] the scripture is
[1:17:00] it was going to be just the way brother
[1:17:02] random said it it was going to be
[1:17:03] exactly where he said it would be it's
[1:17:05] going to be
[1:17:06] god was precisely revealing to him that
[1:17:09] one scripture that he wondered about
[1:17:10] right
[1:17:12] it was the opening of the word
[1:17:14] everybody get what i'm saying
[1:17:16] so when we talk about the squirrels
[1:17:18] people it's the scripture if you say
[1:17:20] this mountain to be moved here to there
[1:17:22] but what we do is we say oh yeah the
[1:17:23] squirrels oh yeah we make it sound like
[1:17:25] super rangers or my grandsons power
[1:17:28] heroes and all that but the message
[1:17:30] we've got to where we don't really tie
[1:17:32] the word in with it
[1:17:33] what is your absolute the word
[1:17:36] if you're going to talk about the
[1:17:37] squirrels show them the scripture where
[1:17:38] it's that way
[1:17:40] that's where your faith rests in the
[1:17:41] word
[1:17:43] if you don't you're just making it a
[1:17:44] fable
[1:17:46] even though it happens you've got to
[1:17:47] prove in the word glory
[1:17:49] that's what we've been talking about
[1:17:50] right
[1:17:52] thank you lord so you everybody
[1:17:54] understand that
[1:17:55] he told an exact precise well i just was
[1:17:58] amazed at it
[1:17:59] i got a bunch of quotes on the squirrels
[1:18:02] well i went with my church i read every
[1:18:03] third pool quote and
[1:18:05] ran it down for them
[1:18:07] but i had time like you did three
[1:18:08] destiny i'm not in a hurry are you
[1:18:10] are you in a hurry no you preach you
[1:18:13] preach until we get a little rapture
[1:18:14] right
[1:18:15] god puts it on your heart i don't get in
[1:18:17] a hurry
[1:18:18] sister had he right
[1:18:21] brother man said
[1:18:22] the same jehovah joy trying to get his
[1:18:24] promise over to me and my thickness
[1:18:26] and dumbness of mine
[1:18:28] right
[1:18:29] see god's revealing something to your
[1:18:30] prophet
[1:18:31] he could he could speak my need and
[1:18:33] existed the same as he could speak
[1:18:34] abraham's needing to exist
[1:18:38] and that super anointing swept over me
[1:18:40] tell hattie that she's found grace in
[1:18:43] the sight of god who would have thought
[1:18:45] said tell her to ask whatsoever she will
[1:18:48] then you speak it by this gift into
[1:18:50] existence whatsoever she
[1:18:52] asketh exactly speak it into predict
[1:18:55] into existence see brother bram didn't
[1:18:56] have time to pray you better get your
[1:18:58] praying up done now gentiles exactly
[1:19:00] because when that third when that
[1:19:01] pressure comes down you're going to be
[1:19:03] you better be speaking this message
[1:19:04] right you better be speaking the word
[1:19:06] and he'll perform it is that what he
[1:19:08] said amen
[1:19:11] i looked at cedar city
[1:19:13] sister hattie the first time it was ever
[1:19:15] performed on a human being i said sister
[1:19:18] addy ask what you will god's going to
[1:19:20] give it to you everybody agree with that
[1:19:24] seven times he is converted by animal
[1:19:26] seven is god's completeness here's the
[1:19:28] first time on a human being a poor
[1:19:30] little widow woman that could hardly
[1:19:31] write her name
[1:19:32] god knows what he's doing he said ask
[1:19:34] what you will had he said to me brother
[1:19:37] branham what do you what do you mean
[1:19:40] of course i'm gonna i'm kind of cut i'm
[1:19:42] trying to hurry okay and she said
[1:19:44] brother bill my greatest desire
[1:19:47] my greatest desire see god will give you
[1:19:51] the desire of your heart
[1:19:53] right opening of the words what it
[1:19:55] always is glory
[1:19:56] for the salvation of my two boys it
[1:19:59] wasn't a minute later those two boys
[1:20:00] were on her knees right crying out to
[1:20:03] god and brother ham said they were saved
[1:20:04] and they're coming to church they're
[1:20:05] filled with the holy ghost amen now you
[1:20:07] argue where they're at today with him i
[1:20:09] don't know
[1:20:10] but i know it happened just like he said
[1:20:12] it happened
[1:20:14] okay
[1:20:15] okay
[1:20:18] i had some scripture wrote down
[1:20:20] somewhere for it i was going to read
[1:20:21] everybody remember the canaanite woman
[1:20:25] remember that canaanite woman
[1:20:28] and she came to jesus said i got a sick
[1:20:29] daughter
[1:20:30] right you know what she did she spoke
[1:20:33] the right things
[1:20:35] the canaanite woman was just exactly
[1:20:37] like sister hattie wright
[1:20:39] exactly
[1:20:40] he she said she said son of david
[1:20:43] right my child my daughter's sick
[1:20:45] grievously sick would you heal her he
[1:20:47] didn't pay attention to it but when she
[1:20:49] said lord he's lord of all when she
[1:20:52] spoke the right thing what did sister
[1:20:54] hattie right do she spoke the right
[1:20:55] thing exactly
[1:20:57] she spoke the right thing
[1:20:59] and when she did she got the desire of
[1:21:01] her heart when that little canaanite
[1:21:02] woman spoke the right thing
[1:21:05] is that right
[1:21:07] jesus said what do you want or jesus
[1:21:09] said well no i've come to the lost sheep
[1:21:11] of the house of israel
[1:21:12] she said even the dogs get the crumbs
[1:21:15] she kept saying the right thing is what
[1:21:17] she did
[1:21:19] is that right
[1:21:20] and what did she do she said you know
[1:21:22] what
[1:21:23] what do you want my desire my will it
[1:21:25] says in the scripture which is your
[1:21:26] desire it's for my daughter to be healed
[1:21:29] he said go your daughter's healed
[1:21:32] the canaanite woman what was it it was
[1:21:34] the opening of that word right there
[1:21:36] sister hattie wright was no different
[1:21:38] than that canaanite woman
[1:21:40] so the third pool is the opening of the
[1:21:42] word does everybody understand that so
[1:21:44] when brother braham said that it wasn't
[1:21:46] just it's that's what it is
[1:21:49] what is the third going to be pool be
[1:21:50] for you it's the opening of the word
[1:21:52] right
[1:21:53] it's going to be where if the hour that
[1:21:55] you have a desire or a will and you're
[1:21:58] so consecrated with god
[1:22:00] god's going to go to the and it's not
[1:22:01] you you're just not going to sit there
[1:22:02] one day and say well i want that it's
[1:22:04] not going to be haphazard every time
[1:22:06] the voice spoke to him and said do this
[1:22:09] tell sister hattie wright what are you
[1:22:11] hunting for squirrels right
[1:22:13] what did he say he said stand up speak
[1:22:15] to the little fishy
[1:22:17] is everybody he was so consequent the
[1:22:19] third pool worked in the third round
[1:22:21] where he said you look what are you
[1:22:23] doing speak the word does everybody
[1:22:25] understand it wasn't just some haphazard
[1:22:27] thing that you do
[1:22:29] you're not going to get this if god
[1:22:30] ain't communicating with you now
[1:22:34] people think oh yeah i'm going to speak
[1:22:36] of wendy's really
[1:22:38] you're so consecrated to god you can't
[1:22:40] come to church
[1:22:42] half the time like i said you better get
[1:22:44] consecrated
[1:22:45] there's a life that comes with this
[1:22:47] message
[1:22:51] so you understand sister hattie i'm i'm
[1:22:53] about done sorry i know who you ain't
[1:22:58] remember brother branham in the storm
[1:23:00] he said that was the fourth sign
[1:23:06] excuse me
[1:23:08] remember jesus was on the boat that time
[1:23:11] and it said it the the waves were so bad
[1:23:13] the storm was so tumultu they're bad i
[1:23:16] can't say that word with my voice right
[1:23:18] now
[1:23:20] that the boat was full of water
[1:23:22] i told the people at church i said not
[1:23:24] only did jesus walk on water he slept on
[1:23:25] it
[1:23:27] it said the boat was full of water he
[1:23:29] says he was in the back of boat asleep
[1:23:31] so he must have been sleeping on the
[1:23:32] water too because it didn't wake him one
[1:23:34] bit
[1:23:35] and one of the disciples run said don't
[1:23:37] you care that we perish
[1:23:39] don't you care
[1:23:41] and jesus wasn't worried one bit he goes
[1:23:43] what's wrong with you man
[1:23:45] so jesus went up there brother baby said
[1:23:46] he put his foot on the bow of the boat
[1:23:49] and he spoke to the storm
[1:23:51] now look it was during a pressure time
[1:23:54] that he did that
[1:23:55] does everybody see the picture
[1:23:57] the boat was full of water it did not
[1:23:59] look good
[1:24:00] right
[1:24:01] it the boat was full of water things
[1:24:03] were not going well at that point
[1:24:06] right right
[1:24:07] so jesus went up there and he spoke to
[1:24:09] the storm and it stopped does everybody
[1:24:11] agree with that it's like i told the
[1:24:13] church no wonder the third pool when the
[1:24:15] pressure comes
[1:24:16] your boat may be full of water right
[1:24:19] just speak the word
[1:24:21] is that right that's why he wasn't
[1:24:22] excited he said why don't you speak the
[1:24:24] word what he could have said right
[1:24:26] just speak the word that's what the
[1:24:28] third pull is all is
[1:24:29] in the fullness it's going to operate
[1:24:31] when the pressure comes down
[1:24:34] i'm going to tell you there's three
[1:24:35] quotes about pressure you better get
[1:24:36] ready for the pressure people
[1:24:38] you think this thing's going to be just
[1:24:40] a
[1:24:42] you better get ready i've been studying
[1:24:44] some things about the natural jew
[1:24:46] brother baby said that's true
[1:24:47] pre-tribulation
[1:24:48] does everybody understand that right
[1:24:51] there are some things that's already
[1:24:52] happening and i i don't think we see
[1:24:54] that
[1:24:55] i'll let you read part of it today
[1:24:57] i might mention that so you understand
[1:24:59] speak into the storm brother branham was
[1:25:01] told those hunters if you don't get off
[1:25:03] that field in 10 or 20 minutes you're
[1:25:04] going to die
[1:25:06] it's going to rain it's going to snow
[1:25:08] it's going to drop 20 foot and you'll be
[1:25:09] dead in 30 minutes
[1:25:11] well brother branham told him that he
[1:25:12] had to believe what he said
[1:25:14] he's going down the mountain the lord
[1:25:15] said
[1:25:17] go back up where you come from he said
[1:25:19] well i'll perish it verbatim what it
[1:25:21] says in that scripture
[1:25:23] right it looked bad
[1:25:25] you talk about some pressure he said go
[1:25:27] back up there he went back up there and
[1:25:29] he said speak to the storm it'll be
[1:25:30] exactly like you say it was it right
[1:25:33] same thing that it was with jesus right
[1:25:36] what is it
[1:25:37] the third pull was
[1:25:38] to for brother brandon when we get to
[1:25:40] see it was the opening of the word
[1:25:41] that's what it's for you
[1:25:43] it's going to be these little scriptures
[1:25:44] that you've got that you've had in your
[1:25:46] heart
[1:25:47] that you may say i don't understand it's
[1:25:49] going to he said in the day you're taken
[1:25:51] before the council don't even give it
[1:25:52] any thought
[1:25:54] i'll speak for you exactly amen right
[1:25:57] when i chapter 4 remember i told you in
[1:25:59] exodus it told moses i'll speak for you
[1:26:02] the third poll is i'll speak for you
[1:26:06] it's not you speaking it's him speaking
[1:26:08] through you
[1:26:09] that's what the third pull is not this
[1:26:11] premeditated stuff these people think
[1:26:13] boy life's going to be peachy keen
[1:26:17] no he'll speak it through you when you
[1:26:19] need it it'll be there
[1:26:21] now can i explain that part of it the
[1:26:23] third part that's unknown tongue that i
[1:26:25] can't explain i can't explain i don't
[1:26:27] know what'll exactly happen but i do
[1:26:29] know when a pressure comes down whatever
[1:26:31] i have need of in that hour he'll be
[1:26:33] given unto me i'm going to make a
[1:26:35] rapture
[1:26:36] they ain't going to kill me
[1:26:38] there ain't nothing they can do to keep
[1:26:40] me out of the rap out of the body change
[1:26:43] i'm going to be changed amen so i'm not
[1:26:46] worried about this oh hide you're
[1:26:47] looking up here i quit worrying about it
[1:26:50] all i'm worried about is getting all the
[1:26:51] word in me i can i want the third pull
[1:26:54] manifest in me
[1:26:57] okay
[1:26:59] the last one was sister meaty
[1:27:01] right
[1:27:03] remember brother madam said he said
[1:27:05] whatever you say brother man was praying
[1:27:07] right
[1:27:08] and he said boy you know brother brandon
[1:27:09] said boy i lost one wife i don't want to
[1:27:12] lose another and the lord come to him
[1:27:14] and said you know what
[1:27:15] speak it it'll be the way you say it is
[1:27:18] that what he said
[1:27:19] he said before the scalpel touches her
[1:27:22] that growth will disappear is that right
[1:27:24] did it happen
[1:27:26] that's exactly like the roman centurion
[1:27:29] he come to jesus he said well you don't
[1:27:31] have to go to my house just speak the
[1:27:32] word
[1:27:33] is that what brother branham did he
[1:27:34] spoke the word
[1:27:36] he wasn't even present when it happened
[1:27:38] does everybody understand
[1:27:40] and the roman centurion you know he told
[1:27:42] him he said you don't have to go
[1:27:43] and so jesus said
[1:27:45] be it according to your word be it so
[1:27:47] so coming back at the end it says
[1:27:49] remember this brother said it don't say
[1:27:51] in the scripture but it does say it if
[1:27:52] you read between the lines
[1:27:55] but he says in the same hour that jesus
[1:27:57] said he was well when his century was
[1:27:59] going back to a sick servant he met
[1:28:02] somebody a long way and said don't worry
[1:28:03] about jesus coming he's well
[1:28:06] brother man said he asked what hour it
[1:28:07] was the same hour that it was exactly
[1:28:09] like he spoken
[1:28:11] god was revealing to him that word
[1:28:13] there's certain things that brother man
[1:28:14] might have preached for 30 years
[1:28:17] but he didn't have the fullness of it
[1:28:18] yet
[1:28:20] and god was opening the word to him okay
[1:28:23] now remember the third pull
[1:28:25] which is the opening of the word the
[1:28:27] fullest that
[1:28:29] will work when the pressure comes down
[1:28:31] amen
[1:28:32] i was reading the brother rather uh wait
[1:28:34] i was looking something up i like to
[1:28:36] read about i'm a history buff i guess
[1:28:38] you called me but
[1:28:40] israel israel in the second world war
[1:28:43] i've got clippings do you know israel
[1:28:44] declared war on germany before germany
[1:28:46] declared war on judea
[1:28:49] you've seen it didn't you so say it i've
[1:28:51] got it i can show it to you my notes
[1:28:54] in 1933 the jews worldwide
[1:28:57] put a boycott on germany
[1:29:01] the reason they put a boycott on it some
[1:29:02] of them read his book
[1:29:04] his book pretty well told what he was
[1:29:06] going to do to the jews right
[1:29:07] now we got a book that pretty well tells
[1:29:09] us what's going down don't we this has
[1:29:11] been revealed to me
[1:29:14] and brother branham turn around preach
[1:29:15] why i'm against denominationalism
[1:29:17] why do you think that they're going to
[1:29:19] come down on us because we've already
[1:29:20] boycotted them right
[1:29:22] our boycott comes long before theirs
[1:29:24] comes
[1:29:25] brother branham constantly when he talks
[1:29:27] about the pressure he talks about a
[1:29:28] boycott does everybody know that
[1:29:30] how many here have boycotted
[1:29:32] denominationalism right amen i have
[1:29:36] brother bram said why i'm against it
[1:29:38] he says in 1804 come out of her my
[1:29:41] people
[1:29:42] see
[1:29:43] the jews that are they knew what hitler
[1:29:45] was up to
[1:29:46] they boycotted him
[1:29:48] a lot of you don't realize that i can
[1:29:49] show it to you or they absolutely showed
[1:29:52] judea declares war on germany
[1:29:55] and the pressure that come back on the
[1:29:56] jews was or on the jews because they
[1:29:58] already started a boycott against them
[1:30:01] what do you think the reason the
[1:30:03] pressure is going to come on you because
[1:30:05] you've already boycotted them
[1:30:07] it's pre-tribulation it's showing you
[1:30:09] the same thing how much of that pressure
[1:30:11] let me show you something the jews
[1:30:14] there were jews that stayed in europe
[1:30:16] and and most of them died did you know
[1:30:18] that
[1:30:19] some of them escaped to france some of
[1:30:21] them escaped to belgium
[1:30:24] they didn't go far enough
[1:30:26] you know brother and there's a quote
[1:30:27] where he talks about europe how he
[1:30:28] jumped across the pond to
[1:30:30] wesley did it's a type justification
[1:30:32] sanctification went over to america
[1:30:34] which is a type of the baptismal doctor
[1:30:36] quote there's a quote for that
[1:30:38] you know the jews that stayed in europe
[1:30:40] under justification
[1:30:42] died
[1:30:44] if you can fall off at jessica you're in
[1:30:45] trouble if you stay there people
[1:30:47] if you're on that part you're going to
[1:30:49] bust tribulations they're going to come
[1:30:50] after you
[1:30:52] sanctification if you went to england
[1:30:54] they can still drop bombs on you there's
[1:30:56] a lot of jews died in london that got
[1:30:57] bombs dropped on them
[1:30:59] so you still fall off there
[1:31:01] but the ones who went to america when
[1:31:03] one bomb wasn't one jew killed
[1:31:05] a type of the baptism holy ghost amen
[1:31:08] right that's what you have to do that
[1:31:09] was a natural type showing you that it
[1:31:12] ain't good enough justification in this
[1:31:14] hour
[1:31:16] it's not exactly right sanctification is
[1:31:19] not good enough in this hour the devil
[1:31:20] can still drop stuff on you there
[1:31:23] right
[1:31:25] but you got the baptism the holy ghost
[1:31:26] the devil sealed out and god sealed in
[1:31:28] the devil cannot handle you then
[1:31:31] there ain't one thing can harm you when
[1:31:33] you got that right
[1:31:35] and that's what we got to come to
[1:31:37] we got to come the fullest the word the
[1:31:38] baptism holy ghost
[1:31:40] we got to understand what these things
[1:31:42] we got to have faith what they had in
[1:31:44] the first exit you're going to know it
[1:31:46] you need to thank god for a preacher
[1:31:48] that's preaching the mysteries
[1:31:51] this preacher here preaches the book of
[1:31:53] redemption
[1:31:55] and that book of redemption is what's
[1:31:56] going to call your name
[1:31:58] the mysteries is what's going to call
[1:32:00] your name and you're going to see right
[1:32:01] where you're at
[1:32:03] that's what does it does everybody
[1:32:05] understand that
[1:32:06] so that's what the book of redemption is
[1:32:08] it's just the plan of redemption the
[1:32:09] mysteries of it
[1:32:21] honestly guys why are you worried
[1:32:23] why are you fearing are you a gentile
[1:32:25] like the canaanite woman
[1:32:27] like the centurion
[1:32:29] why don't you just speak the word and
[1:32:31] let god perform it amen why don't you
[1:32:33] just believe what god gave you in this
[1:32:35] third pool the opening of the word
[1:32:38] like i said this morning i thought it
[1:32:39] was funny that i'm preaching this if
[1:32:41] this is the 50th
[1:32:43] year that i think it's odd that i'd be
[1:32:45] preaching on the third pool
[1:32:47] i think god's trying to get to us now
[1:32:49] it's time that we start speaking it
[1:32:51] it's time that we understand what the
[1:32:53] third pool is
[1:32:54] and the third pool starts working in the
[1:32:56] car and it is
[1:32:57] by the opening of the word
[1:33:00] okay
[1:33:02] so
[1:33:03] i hope i didn't lose anybody i'm sorry
[1:33:05] to keep you so long
[1:33:06] it took me seven services back home to
[1:33:08] just preach the third pool and i
[1:33:10] preached in two 20 parts
[1:33:12] but it's easy to preach here because you
[1:33:14] he's taught you the mysteries
[1:33:17] so we've been just kind of reminiscing
[1:33:18] over them today is what we've been doing
[1:33:22] that's why i told you i just don't think
[1:33:23] we're getting what god's done for us
[1:33:29] you know brother samuel
[1:33:33] me and you he put us down here to
[1:33:35] minister at the best time on the face of
[1:33:37] the earth
[1:33:38] amen
[1:33:39] and i just i i
[1:33:42] we don't do god of service
[1:33:44] right
[1:33:44] we this is no wonder john was worshiping
[1:33:47] and thanking god and falling down on his
[1:33:49] knees that's what we ought to do
[1:33:52] that same book of redemption has been
[1:33:53] open to us we get to see our name
[1:33:56] and you know what people we need to be a
[1:33:58] happy people amen
[1:34:00] it's like i've told you here if you
[1:34:01] don't have joy now the anointing in the
[1:34:03] millennium's joy
[1:34:04] what makes you think you're going to be
[1:34:05] in the millennium if you don't have it
[1:34:06] here
[1:34:07] brother said what you are here is what
[1:34:09] you are there
[1:34:13] god's good to us
[1:34:14] don't you thank him for this
[1:34:20] i can't explain it there's an unknown
[1:34:22] part i can't explain
[1:34:24] right the third pull is just going to
[1:34:26] happen for us when that pressure comes
[1:34:27] down
[1:34:28] because you're going to be so one with
[1:34:30] the word and he's going to say
[1:34:32] brother samuel what do you want right
[1:34:36] and you're going to say
[1:34:38] it's going to be there yeah exactly
[1:34:41] it's just going to be there how do you
[1:34:42] explain that how are you going to
[1:34:43] explain to him what's going to happen
[1:34:45] four or ten exactly that's the part i
[1:34:47] can't explain
[1:34:48] when i know the day that i need it it'll
[1:34:50] be there amen amen and he's gonna take
[1:34:52] care of me
[1:34:54] i thank god he's taking care of me
[1:34:56] because i ain't gonna done a good job of
[1:34:57] taking care of
[1:34:58] me but he's taking care of me in this
[1:35:01] journey
[1:35:02] it's a wonderful time
[1:35:04] god bless your brother saying the lord
[1:35:05] amen
[1:35:07] time's up
[1:35:09] lord bless you sorry thank you
[1:35:11] sorry i took so long i apologize to you
[1:35:13] okay

[1:35:34] what is the
[1:35:36] the third pool
[1:35:37] the opening of the word

[1:35:46] we say well the first pull is taken by
[1:35:49] the hand
[1:35:51] you know divine healing
[1:35:53] and we say second pull was discernment
[1:35:55] something
[1:35:58] but what did the prophet say was
[1:36:01] it's the opening of the word
[1:36:03] first pool was opening of the word
[1:36:07] the second pool was opening of the
[1:36:09] entire bible sure
[1:36:11] because that's prophecy prophecy is a
[1:36:14] setting in order of scripture
[1:36:16] all right

[1:36:19] that's
[1:36:20] spoken
[1:36:22] yeah but i mean i've read that scripture
[1:36:23] everybody but you know if if you say
[1:36:26] yeah brother branham had two yeah
[1:36:28] but it didn't come to pass until god
[1:36:32] come down and quicken that scripture to
[1:36:34] it
[1:36:35] then

[1:41:42] gonna get paid for going nursing home
[1:41:44] uh
[1:41:48] i have a burden for them people so my
[1:41:50] mission is to
[1:41:52] not to think of myself just to think of
[1:41:54] them actually when i called he said how
[1:41:56] much do you guys charge and say we have
[1:41:57] never charged a penny
[1:41:59] so i'm sorry if i said something wrong

[1:42:09] the right for one to want your heart to
[1:42:11] be right amen you enjoy the message
[1:42:14] enjoy the messages today let's give our
[1:42:16] brother
[1:42:19] i like his way of doing
[1:42:21] put it in the word
[1:42:24] i mean you can give me the quotes for
[1:42:25] something
[1:42:28] but put it in the word
[1:42:30] let me read it in the scriptures that's
[1:42:32] right because that quote has got to find
[1:42:35] you it's got to be
[1:42:38] if it's right and we believe it to be
[1:42:40] right
[1:42:41] then it's got to be in the word
[1:42:43] because he was a word prophet
[1:42:46] it doesn't say the quotes come to the
[1:42:48] prophet
[1:42:49] he said the word come to the prophet
[1:42:51] right
[1:42:52] and all brother was trying to do was
[1:42:54] just bring that word down to you and i
[1:42:58] that we could see the god that he saw
[1:43:03] that's all any minister is doing trying
[1:43:05] to get you to see the word
[1:43:07] that has come forth
[1:43:09] but see we always want to come up with
[1:43:10] something though because there's the
[1:43:12] devil as quick as you do the devil will
[1:43:14] desire to pound yeah but if
[1:43:16] if we had the word we'd have signs and
[1:43:18] wonders
[1:43:19] i believe we are
[1:43:22] i believe we are having signs
[1:43:26] right
[1:43:27] man told me one time he's talking about
[1:43:29] it he said something about not stealing
[1:43:31] him i was healed and he said
[1:43:32] i said well just remember one thing i
[1:43:34] ain't dead yet
[1:43:36] you know i was standing there talking to
[1:43:38] him you know when i was telling him i
[1:43:40] was healed
[1:43:42] because that's the way it is
[1:43:44] but we want we want our way
[1:43:48] is that what we've been talking about
[1:43:49] cain
[1:43:50] cain wanted his way of doing it
[1:43:52] if god come cain's way cain was happy
[1:43:55] right
[1:43:58] but yet because god didn't come that way
[1:44:01] what about a man it took all of those
[1:44:02] years
[1:44:04] to bring him to a place and i'm talking
[1:44:05] about brother branham and his ministry
[1:44:07] to where he would finally come to
[1:44:09] speak in the word yep exactly
[1:44:13] now don't you think that he wanted to
[1:44:14] speak that word about his wife don't you
[1:44:16] think that he prayed for her constantly
[1:44:21] and wondered and was burdened to why
[1:44:22] that wouldn't go away
[1:44:26] but what was the difference from the
[1:44:27] next day or nothing it was just
[1:44:29] something that god came on the
[1:44:32] scene and said
[1:44:34] you say it
[1:44:36] and that's the way it'll be
[1:44:40] it's not that always through this bible
[1:44:44] we want it being you and i
[1:44:48] when we have a need god will be there
[1:44:52] you can't question that when
[1:44:54] when you see what it is
[1:44:56] and it's not you
[1:45:01] it's him speaking through you
[1:45:05] what an opportunity
[1:45:07] but brother i always thought the third
[1:45:09] pool was when i would say it
