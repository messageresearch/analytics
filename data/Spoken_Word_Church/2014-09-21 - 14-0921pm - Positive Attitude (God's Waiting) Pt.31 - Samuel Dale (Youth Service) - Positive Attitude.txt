amen to see you high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory loving pour out your power and love as we shining in the light of your glory out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy holy holy i want to see amen and amen i believe we've seen him in the children don't you amen let's give them a good hand basically that part about jonas it's saying god is strong some of you in the back might not have been able to see him but he had that arm up he was strong so he believed it amen but we appreciate the kids appreciate you doing you know if you like turning your scriptures turned in genesis 3. we finally get now the book of hebrews not out of the thought but out of the book of hebrews we're going to genesis i mean excuse me uh exodus i'm getting in bad shape i got so much in genesis wrote down i got four three three things in genesis wrote down but we want to go to exodus but you know we have announcements now remember the lord willing brother gibby be preaching verse is coming wednesday uh brother reid will be here with us for the weekend ministering uh on this coming weekend sunday and then the lord willing on october the 1st which will be the next wednesday we're going to get brother luis into the ranks and let him be in preaching he said he didn't know anything about it i said you don't know nothing about it you know how to do with it we just tell him what to do just kidding uh then then the lord willing brother forney will be with us on the 25th and brother ernie villanueva will be with us on the second day of november so that's getting these brothers announced and getting that part out of the way but we appreciate these brothers and appreciate the ministry the lord has allowed us to be able to hear because i truly believe faith comes by hearing i've never said faith comes by preaching it doesn't say that it says faith comes by hearing now somebody's got to preach but that's a different point right so we'll do that okay exodus 3 we'll get into a little talk this afternoon father we thank you for your loving your grace and unto us and we thank you for all things and we pray that you would bless us and understanding because that's our desires and lord that you would truly come and open the eyes of our hearts that we may see you and want to walk into your loving grace father these old bodies we know are deteriorating away because of the age factor that's dwelling upon all of us but we know and surely know for truth that as the end time is coming upon us then we look up for our redemption draw at night lord we love you and we thank you and we commit everything to you now you come and speak to our hearts thank you for the children and they're dedicated of their lives to get up and sing and worship and all lord and to praise you we pray that you would accept that from the hearts of these little kids out of love for you lord we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen odd scripture maybe to start off with but we generally have odd ways right exodus 3 now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mount of god even to horeb and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold a bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said now i want you to watch between moses and god in in relationship i want you to watch that little word i because it means a personal contact the so watch it moses it says about him i even said about god and it's a it's a personal con now what have we been saying that everybody in the bible ever mounted anything had a personal experience with god and so that's what we need right and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight while the bush is not burned and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see now you know you think lord didn't know he was going to do it but you know he was waiting on him all right long time we'll get to it in a minute and the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place we're in thou standeth is holy ground moreover he said i am the lord of thy father and the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god and the lord said i have surely seen the afflictions of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry for a reason of their taskmasters for i know their sorrows and i am come down to deliver thee out of the hand delivered them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey under the place of the canaanites the hittites the amorites purge the sites the highways the jebusites now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is coming to me and i have also seen the oppression we're with the egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou must bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word and i said i want you to notice the personal things that you know you know it's been said and it's a good point that when he went down to at this point you're going down to verse 12 or 13 14 there it talks about i am that i am when they went down moses went down to egypt and over pharaoh said who's going to take him out he said i am i got pretty personal you know because that was the way that i want you to think about it i want you to think about you know still keeping the positive attitude and that a personal contact with almighty god to where that you know uh you can realize that uh somebody else is in command it's not you because that's the first thing we should recognize is it's not us but you know it's what he's doing and he's the one that's promised it and uh just a little background material of it uh you know it was told to abraham over in genesis 15 in the uh commissioning and the sending forth of abraham and the time as he was going through the visions and the different things it was told him that the children of israel would be down in egypt for 400 years now remember one thing you've got to have either you're talking about two things or either to me i believe it's just the one but uh the children of israel were never sent to egypt as captivity they became in bondage after they were in egypt they were actually sent dire in a way to be conquerors you know because you know the pharaoh just gave them everything and you take the best you know and all of that but then they rose up one that didn't know joseph well then from that time on then the children of israel begin to be afflicted so it's not really a record i'm not trying to do nothing but just make a point that it's not that they were sent to egypt as slaves they went down there themselves but yet when they got down there now i hope you follow my point when they got down there maybe they become too much egyptian you know because they kind of lost their um personality uh whatever you want to call it and we say well there was a you know one raised up that didn't know joseph well that's fine because that was part of the doings but my point of what i'm saying is that had they not become so settled down in where they were and things happening that when they first started being persecuted they could have probably rose up and whipped the egyptians you know because that was the problem the egyptians had they were afraid of them well you know there was no there was no bondage thing that they were under then they slowly gradually began to put them under bondage to uh you know to this new pharaoh that didn't know joseph well to me it's kind of like us sometimes that you know remember a lot it vexed his righteous soul the things that went on in sodom but yet he was sitting in the door and wouldn't do anything about it he kind of sat there and just kind of let it go you know and maybe that's the way we do and my point is that the reason now god had already in the calling of abraham had already told him that in genesis that they would be down there 400 years all right and see then that was looking forward to knowing that something's going to take place well what took place was that they got out of contact with god because if they'd have seen what was going on you know and why didn't they just jump up right then and say wait a minute you know because they were really a powerful nation the pharaoh got tired or i mean got obscured over him so he he began to put taskmasters over them but they still just kind of went along with it they went into slavery are you following me they went into slavery a lot on their own well don't you think that's the way mankind has always been that instead of god making us go into slavery see we think that they come over here and our ideas was they come over here and they've done something wrong in this drove down here well they was that away a lot of times and that was true a lot of times that they went through those things but this time is not that way this time they be gradually were brought into slavery all right and being brought into slavery then it was so easily going along until until things had to start really happening and even after it started happening they still didn't fight back against it you know they kind of just relaxed and you know even after they get over into the wilderness i never did understand that one but they said oh if we just stayed down there where we had the garlics and the cucumbers now you know garlic is okay as long as you stay away from me when you eat it and cucumbers is only one good thing about them they make you burp so then i i just don't see any great value of wanting to go back to garlics and cucumbers you know i mean i'd rather eat the dirt off the ground but but my point is just to lay a little thought in your mind for what we want to say because see they had kind of got over there and got in and maybe you know i'm on their side maybe that's why they didn't understand because my point is of this way why didn't israel begin to go back into what they had of the word the scrolls of things and why didn't they figure out by the scrolls that they wouldn't go be down there no more than 400 years because god had done told abraham now remember there were there 430 but you know the scripture said it'd be like 400 years all right but there were the 30 years because of the rejecting or even after moses came on the scene but why didn't they rally behind moses and why didn't some of them figure out like who was we talking about jeremiah one of them that said it'd be down there for 70 years and and daniel said we've been here 68 years see he got in there he knew something was going to take place well my point is why didn't israel had they become so uh for lack of revelation or lack of understanding or or lack of knowing that god was on their side had they become to a point that they just didn't really know what's going on why didn't they read the scrolls check the time whatever you want to do they had ways they kept up with all the things and why didn't they say well we know we're going out here pretty quick we might not be able to set the date because of the bondage and the parts and the things but we were supposed to be here 400 years and then at about time we started getting out of here because i believe if they had have understood where they were at they would not have rejected moses right especially it's not in the writings but we know he did surely moses and those people remember was raised up with moses all right they knew the story of moses they knew the deliverance of somebody was supposed to come all right you know they knew there was going to be a strong hand because it said it over here in genesis you know there'd be a deliverance all right and why couldn't they get the picture together of what was going on and be able to kind of look in the scrolls in the word and i don't believe they would have rejected moses because they would have been after anything that would have been um try to bring a deliverance and we're rallied around him because naturally moses probably told him you know there when the first little incidents happened and the first thing going on moses would talk so don't you remember the story my mother told me i was to be a deliverer right surely you know some things went on to explain that he was to be the deliverer and they turned it down you know my point is to you and i do we want to deliver would we accept a deliverer i want to get out of here don't you ain't you kind of interested in getting out of this world i mean age is taking over the biggest portion of us and the ones that are younger you're getting older faster and we got older you know because you're wearing out quicker than we wore out but instead of repenting for anything that they would think and i'm trying to get that story behind it because for you to think about it it's not that the children of israel would be repenting because they was not really thinking about their sin it put them there because their sin did not put them there that's right right i mean they went there as victorious not as sin but see after a while their sin the problem with their sin the way i look at it was they become at ease in zion as the bible says or better to say ease in egypt you know they got settled down you know but see there was other things that god had told abraham and how they would go on and be a great nation a great people there was their unbelief that's what i'm trying to get to you first couple of messages is our biggest unbelief is to doubt what god has said and spoken of you and i not the great sin of of of drinking gambling smoking you know we went through two services trying to express that to you all right but our what is our greatest sin to not believe who we are do you think they would have wanted to stay in egypt if they could have realized who they were and realized that abraham had already prophesied spoke that god had showed him that they would go to a land that would be flowing with milk and honey read your bible and just sit down and think about it and think about it then in relation to you and i you know our time no that's what we're supposed to do so they wasn't slaves but they became slaves because they would not raise up and take their position all right now see you and i can easily become slaves to ladies easy to do all right because of the age and the time and the relationship and everything you know to worry that you know what's going on today and instead of looking into we say this in our wesley instead of them looking into the word to see how long they was to be there because they would be able to calculate a little bit and to look in there and to see if there was anything wrong you know try to find their sin because surely for 400 years wherever how many years it was there at the bondage they would think about well why is god putting this on us now according to the prophet that's why i said i got the thought and i ain't even got any notes or nothing but according to the prophet of god in this last days the children of israel in this last days was forced back to the homeland right i mean they were literally forced back persecution of people under eichmann and hitler mussolini and those people force the jews to want to go home all right look like they're in they're doing that you know they would have said hey back then see we're the children of god we're not supposed to be in bondage you know let's raise up and get out of here but instead of checking out to see the problem you know and why they were there and how long they were going to be there they just relaxed a little more because when moses said i mean surely come on think sensibly moses didn't walk out there and just kill that egyptian and say um i will take over they said okay take over the army you're in charge right because he was right he was capable of taking an insurrection against the government and had all the military behind him all right but instead of doing that here he goes you get scared well then again they lose it one little ray of hope that that rose up as moses to explaining to them you know that he was to be the leader sparked a little ray of hope within their hearts and lives and as it did they maybe rallied around him for a while don't you think that's what happened in the last days when brother branham came on the scene and began to talk about these things and who the people were the people kind of rallied around that for a while right and they could have went with it but then once he was removed from the scene as moses was sent into the desert they lost what little bit of a rally they had you know now you see the people of the world and what is it even the people of the message is now trying to prove the message wrong the prophet wrong the things don't you see the same situation sitting that instead of israel thinking they were victorious and rose up with a little ray of hope through moses oh who do you think you are are you going to kill us like you killed that egyptian and you know we we look at movies and we see things that pharaoh rose up and and he drove moses out well you know you read your bible and you don't see that right so we're going to take the movie you know the director's way of thinking are we going to take the bible to me if you read it correctly sure pharaoh got riled up but you know what moses got scared he thought they would rally around him and to me now i don't see pharaoh as it's in the movie you know takes moses out and gives him one bottle of water and sends him into the desert because he didn't want to kill him because he was afraid of the military that moses was head of you know they make a beautiful picture the beautiful pictures are not always right to me it looks like moses got us scared and moses grabbed him half a gallon of water and he took off to the desert right when you read your bible all right but see instead of the people then seeing it they see their uh potential savior as leaving the scene all right instead of checking out their time that said they would be there instead of checking out their sin in their life of unbelief they just poured it more back on god and complained more to god right and then they complain to moses and moses when he comes back over to the liver they really got laid on them didn't they 40 years later and it really got laid on them all right but i hope you follow my point i think it's about time to realize that obamacare is not going to help us and oh hillary care is not going to help us if she becomes president or who becomes president is not going to help us we're a doomed bunch of people and are we going to just sit down haphazardly and well we just don't know where's anything going on now or not maybe something will happen one day somebody will raise up and that's what you see you see the young men that's come along in this message some of them or some people come along they grab a doctor and they run and everybody runs with it and after a while they just start dwindling away from it why because it's not producing but have we forgotten are we like israel that had forgotten that there was a deliverer to be sent a promise to abraham that his seed would go down there and journey and all these things but yet they would come out with a mighty hand after all that you and i have seen in this day god's sending a prophet to to show these things and being done and yet the people are just dying away oh they still flare up groups and you know where i stand i've told you where i stand there's flare-up groups that are brother randoms coming back this has got to happen that's got to happen okay all right but what's that got to do with you and i what are we dealing with what's your idea of what will bring a rapture to pass i mean you've got one you've got a brain you got some concept some thought and what is it but instead of checking our unbelief we just go further into unbelief well we don't see nothing going on oh yeah 40 years ago 50 something you know we saw great moves and we saw great things and but we've come down to a rapture and like i said when moses went back to egypt you think they wanted him as a deliverer you better read your bible they said moses since you got back here we have doubled our own works we are now having to go out and get her own straw you have laid labor up on top of labor you have brought shame upon us at least we could deal with the egyptians we had a few garlics and cucumbers but now you want us to go out into the wilderness it took god to come on the scene to totally well what is the bible says about it said i'm my raised raised r-a-g-e-d is what i said i think raised egypt which means every how you spell it it it means they literally moses literally by his word wiped egypt out raised he literally wiped egypt out by his word and you think that was ready to go probably the biggest force in them wanted to get out of there because they was afraid of what not what the next plague would be then they get out just a little while and they start murmuring and complaining israel was told what would take place but they didn't believe it brother adam has told us what will happen here in the end time and how it will be but are we checking up ourselves and not necessarily calculating time but you know time is a factor but checking up to see if there's any sin that's causing us to be here i believe israel finally maybe begin to realize a little bit about their mistakes and you get on over about joshua and they begin to go into the land and you know by then probably some of them begin to realize that they were the problem we want to blame everybody else don't we we want a woman in the white house we want a russia coming after oil we want to pope out of the united states instead of thinking about us you know what's wrong with little church me but you know what if i sitting out there in the pew i'd say you know what's wrong with lula church me we all should think about we're the problem is it my unbelief yeah but i don't have any i believe everything the prophet said like i said i bring out some things a lot of times that i hope shows you you don't fully have an understanding of what's going on and you know why i do that dory you wake up and get away from we're in the message when i preached two services brother gary came out the other day and he said brother dale he said you preached on this a long time it said you finally brought it to a level or a thoughts of understanding of what sin is and how that the greatest sin of all is the unbelief of you and i the reason we're here today is because of you and now all right now here we get into the thought look what brother random says about the children of israel from spoken words original seed go at number one and he's talking about moses and the time that's more original seed paragraph 4 24. moses never stayed in egypt and argued his scriptural points with them he never flushed with the priest but he went to the wilderness and waited on the lord until the until the people were ready to receive him now i've laid it down to a point deliberately that when he came back the people wasn't thinking like brother branham is saying that they were ready but we'll get to that in a second what it was they did at least by then begin to cry out for a deliverer right now he had come to testify of them but they would not receive him god called his prophet to the wilderness god had testified he had chosen him but the waiting was not by moses but for the people to get ready to receive moses moses thought the children would understand that he was sent he said i never wrote that so now we get down to the thought finally after israel is going through so much trouble and seeing that moses as i said sparked a little ray of light in them but then he went out in the desert was gone the taskmasters got worse and worse and the children of israel began to cry for a deliverer they might not have first believed it that's the whole layout to what i brought they did rally enough to get up and leave with him you might not have understood that's okay god don't bother about that that don't worry him or you and i not to understand but get up move so what does he do they begin to cry for a deliverer probably might have been a bunch of old hard heads among them like brother dale is again and to begin to tell them they're wrong and the reason they was dire in you know you know but look at the next one which is faith is a substance by and by they're raised up or a pharaoh who did not know joseph and then the people got in bondage and they had to make straw houses and bricks and things out of straw and stuff and when they began to cry to guard for a deliverer is that right and they cried and cried and god foreordained to deliver her is that right but i still want you to think why did they not read the word to find how long they would be surely somebody's own record was made by then i know where moses comes in the writings and all that okay i know he wrote the books but by then a lot of people remembered some things and some promises abraham why didn't they rally around that no so they begin to cry out to god for a deliverer right and you know god sent moses right back to the people but remember they had to be crying out israel had to be calling out to god before he sent to deliver but now the difference in them and us is as we'd say maybe they had scrolls maybe they had a few things from a lot his memory was handed down you know one to the other because they had people back then that kept up with things you know and you go to some of these countries now and there's people that'll sit down there with you and they can tell you every who's who's who's who's ken and what's what because it by memory they take it down all right and they could remember a lot of things but they never begin to think about their own selves they never begin to think about their own unbelief and if i'd have been moses i'd have walked right in i'd have got them all together and i said boys you didn't believe me the first time are you going to believe me now that's probably the way i would have been of course the bible says moses was a meek man so i guess the poor took all of that out of him and my wife ain't got it all out of me yet i'm still arrogant and hateful and blunt but my point is god did fulfill his word but you know it was not because of israel it was because of his promise all right the part they had to be was the group of people that cried like i said with the they finally because it says they cried the problem they cried and they cried well you know right after moses went out there's crying for a delivery god you said you give us a deliver three years later you know he said you give us a delivery somebody said well i guess we missed it moses lord i guess we missed it moses but we got to have a deliverer for 40 years they cried for god to deliver them a lot of prayers in 40 years god doesn't say much about it except what we read he said i've heard the cries of my people and i've seen the afflictions that's been put on them he remembered every one of them down through there that they prayed but there was finally a group of people are you listening now finally a group of people who got in contact with god they prayed to write prayer right and god says okay your word that you're supposed to be now i'll send moses and that's what he done right you've now reached a place some of you have got to the point that you realize times the whole background of what i said you got to the place to realize the sin you've committed and you're trying to repent i've come down now well we've been 40-something years and that's the basis that a lot of people have for the return ministries and things like that that's nothing to me because i don't have no problems i've told you where i stand not against anybody or any thoughts but i just stand with me it's always been the pattern with god we'll get to it in the ages that he hears the prayers of the people but somebody now please heaven help me get this point somebody comes to a place that god really hears them it's been that never age it's been that all the times all right now if you don't get the rest of the message get this point i don't think there's a whole lot of time to raise up another group to start praying and i don't think that you'd be able to get to them what you need to get to them i think it's now something personal we are the end-time people he said well you said that 40 years ago you know what i was trying to do get somebody to believe with me trying to get somebody to believe with me well because you can't deny that i've ain't been preaching it for 40 something years you got to admit it well i had something in mind but they begin to cry and they begin to cry until finally somebody touched god and watch it in the ages that great flare-ups we'll say down through the ages there was a lot of people protested the catholic church right it had a little effect kept some controls and started with the white cliffs and the difference of printings and the and the things of getting the bibles and things down and they were well and good little sparks of hope and ray that come in that would be necessary but one day there was a man called martin luther martin luther something struck him you know what he got in touch with god god revealed to him that it was a just shall live by faith because he got himself out of the way think about that through each age as we try to cover it somebody brought god on the scene the children of israel had to be crying for a deliverer before god's going to deliver you and i are going to have to be crying out for a deliverer before there's going to be a rapture of things because remember the rapture is not the next thing the resurrection comes before the rapture so we better be concerned about trying to get the dead out of the grave how do we do that oh we'll get us some shovels and we'll just go in you want me to tell you what's going to bring the resurrection i've told you for 40 something years i don't know where you've listened to it or not you know when we contact that faith that those before us had it will bring those out of the grave when you and i come to a place of faith revelation they without us cannot be made perfect so we're going to have to come to a place but we don't deny we believe what luther talked right we believe what wesley taught well see as i said the catholic church wasn't concerned about luther but when the people begin to rally around because there was something called luther to step up now that's what we're going to cover for a second okay let's read this one go ahead number three be certain of god this i think is the little weird woman with a dead child i'm not certain i'll get to it a minute she was somewhat like abraham was called to give everything she had laying down the sticks you know and the thing that's who this really was then laying it on the altar of sacrifice maybe you've called maybe your call like that this morning give up your ways give up your unbelief give up everything you got and then take the oil and the word and mix it together and put it on the altar of self-sacrifice you'll find out it'll call god on the scene as certain as i'm standing in this pulpit what's going to call god on the scene get rid of our sin get straightened up and get our unbelief out of the way and take to all the holy spirit and the word and put it together by revelation and realize where we're at all right now let's read this one because this is the thought go ahead to to invisible union i would invite you to read listen or read to the whole message of invisible union and especially if you would like to title some messages and listen was uh go awake jesus uh calling jesus on the scene there's many titles of sermons if you'd listen to them it would really help you you know all right well watch what he starts paragraph 52 but then watch again to the spiritual church how that group of people called out the elected through every revival in martin luther it happened the same way in the reformation it happened the same thing in the time of john wesley it happened the same thing when the pentecostals first started they dropped them women right back in line with the word and then they drift away and she goes right back over into chaos so you see that messenger comes line up for a while then they go into chaos what but then the time that the prophet then the time that the people are ready to line up there's a message comes forth and they line up with it see take each age and bring it down but we just stay over going run quicker through luther wesley see the people in the age before begin to get away from who would columba yeah all right in his message in the doings and people started crying for a deliverer and god answered that with martin luther when the people began to cry all right luther was a messenger one day of justification the church lined right with it some of them the rest of them continued on wesley come with sanctification the church lined right with it pentecost come with the restoration of the gifts the church ran right with it the elected of that day and they faded then faded away went right back off in denominationalisms and went right on out with the rest of them all of them right down along the line now but did you notice but now but you notice when the people begin to try to line up with the word there comes a fresh message from the word of god write straight to the people and they catch that message and line up every time it's just in god so that's where it's at when they begin to try to line up to the message when azusa street people begin to fade away the people begin to cry out and as they cried out god answered that with a man named william branham to bring a message but as every age went so did it go that the people begin to just fall away oh yeah they still got the books the tapes and still go to church and still do everything but i've watched this for 40 something years and i've watched churches just literally do this just falling downward downward downward you know and and just doing that lula too okay but you see that doesn't have anything to do with it and let me make you understand one thing plain okay plain you wait this is plain we're not looking for another messenger to come like the brother said wednesday there's no place to put an eighth church age messenger in this church ages the eighth you can't do that all right but it didn't end when the prophet was here the reason you know it didn't end is because instead of the rapture coming dire the people have dwindled away from the real truth now they're trying to straighten out the prophet we don't have to look for another messenger we've already got the message this prophet brought the life's message but he spoke of things that was not fulfilled how did a group of people would become the word made flesh and withstand satan and become an invincible army that he couldn't do anything with because it's to end up all things not somebody else jump up not brother dale to jump up and take over and straighten everybody out i found out a long time ago i have trouble keeping me straight what everybody else is doing that's their business i'm just trying to keep this old boy in line and to try to preach and to help you to see what the truth is for the hour that we're living but i know and realized too that it's not done by one person it has to be done by the bride the prophet brought the message as it said martin luther god answered the call with a man named martin luther and he brought the message of the just shall live by faith when that began to dwindle down we just read it god saw the cries of the people that those methodists i mean those uh lutherans began to cry out other little off today and god sent john wesley when they begin to dry up and denominate he's in azusa street with the restoration of the gifts when that began to dry up he sent a prophet to bring us the message now that's drying up around the world right go over season they have great effects why because they're not so down in unbelief they're sincere people that can if they can see anything they'll believe it right but here i don't know there could be anointed ones sure they talk about the dead right the secret but that could be anointed once we just don't see it where's the cry you understand what i'm getting at i'm getting at lula georgia where's the cry in the hearts of the people when the bible said they would sign cry for the abomination done in the city i don't throw off on these brothers it's gone off on wrong doctrines come on they got their own reward but they're human beings and i told you little wildfires better no fire at all at least they tried instead of oh we're just waiting we don't know what to wait on but we're gonna wait what about the signing crying let them do their own signing and crying i have enough problems keeping myself we're praying have you ever tried to pray for somebody that was against you you know it's kind of hard to do you say oh no well then you lied it's hard to sign crying this day but you know that was the ones that they put the mark on in the scripture was them that sighed and cried for the abominations done in the city they received a mark which was the baptism of the holy ghost we are expecting an outpouring from heaven as to be the final anointing of the baptism of the holy ghost in such a high form until god and man is to become one amen but do we sign and cry brother bran i'm going to resume with the ages he's talking about the ages coming down he's talking about pentecost and he said we know that there must be a necessity of necessity be a great be a return of dynamic power and watch the believers sense this in their spirit and begin to cry to god for an outpouring such as it was in the first century he's talking about the outpouring what seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the spirit it was then believed that this indeed was a long-awaited restoration he told me azusa street it was not for the latter rain can only come after the former rain which is a spring or teaching rain see they thought azusa street was the great outpouring to take us in it was a great outpouring but yet it wasn't what was going to have amen look right above there on number five brothers pull it up whatever particularly in mind is this about the turn of the century the hunger for god was generated in the philadelphian age brought a cry for the spirit of god and when the cry was answered by god sending forth manifestations in tongues interpretation prophecy a group immediately and most contrary to the word grew up a doctrine that tom's was the evidence and then get being baptized with the holy ghost instead of going on with what they were calling for they denominated brother branham in the steel book said it like that he said the people were cabbage down it didn't say they'd leave the message and go away and do this other they'd cabbage down that's what you see most people are doing now that's the thing i fought for 40 something years is for this church to become so relaxed until we think that we're the only group that's got it and we think that we are ready you know i think god has been among us and done marvelous things i agree with that i believe it i believe hebrews 13 8. but what i believe is that ought to start a cry into our hearts for god to move on the scene in our lives lord if you'd ever get old brother sister so-and-so straightened up boy we'd be ready to go oh yeah we'd be ready to go well you know what that's the biggest unbeliever in the crowd but get the point now and i'll finish the people had to be calling out in the days of moses for god to send a deliverer he just answered the cry when the right group of people got the right agreement together a connection then god brought the man on the scene it wasn't he wasn't listening to those others no he hears all prayers but somebody touched him somebody got to a place that they called him on the scene well you know that's what i tried to explain about martin luther somebody contacted god the people were crying out for a deliverer and god sent martin luther with the message of the just shall live by faith the lutherans died away and got denominating up and doing the people begin to cry he sent john wesley all right they begin to drop and die he's in azusa street they begin to denominate and drive you know there's just a street with trinitarians the oneness doctrine never come to about 1912. and see brother around him didn't come along to straighten up the thoughts about the oneness and the trinity we see people begin to cry and god sent them signs and wonders in the zeus street and they begin to cry out for deliverance and he sent them people oral robbers the shulers the swaggers that's why i said don't throw off on them people god used them they were in a lot of respects the answer to the prayers of the people because they didn't know how to pray but somebody must have touched god about the promises he made that in the last days the word would be restored back to its fullness that dwelt in the book of acts and dwelt into the lord jesus christ people begin to cry out for that who was it ff bosworth prayed and prayed he saw brother branham one day and saw the sign he said that's what i prayed for he said son as he was dying listen the other day to him he said son take this message to the foreign fields he said before these others get there and mess it up to take it to the people he said i believe you're a prophet there was a lot of good people down through there that god heard their prayers and he sent brother random on the scene all right but now where are we at right amen where are we at folks it has started going down what's going to happen somebody's got to cry out for a deliverance but just remember not looking for another messenger not looking for another man not looking at that because he's already told us what would take place do you understand me he told abraham they will be down there 400 years i'll bring them out with a strong hand and he did he said there would be a prophet come in the last days and declare the word of god and he did amen that's right but like he said to abraham go out with a strong hand though jonas said power strong right what are you looking for brother dale i'm looking for somebody to just agree with me and of all these years i've tried to preach about what i believe would take place and you say it's exalted but no it's truth 1969 i preached one's first sermon in this message was it the bride would be the son of man of course 73 4 5 certain brothers come along and started talking about son of man and the people rallied around that well that's fine because i'm not claiming seniority i'm just i just never was trying to get what they was trying to get right because i never wanted it to get to where you looking at me because you do something's going to happen and you're going to have a problem remember a few weeks ago a while back i was talking about how it if you don't honor the messenger the prophet said he'd take him off the scene that's what he said he said the church age messengers would happen he said and the pastors so if you don't honor the pastor correctly he will take him off the scene that's why i have whistled here twice that some of you were saying that i was a prophet and i said no i do not have the ministry of a prophet i'm not catholic i ain't you know set for that leave me alone it wouldn't do no good for you to believe that i am that or i would be that wouldn't make no that's difference leave me the word that i am that i can preach teach the people guide the people into the revealed word of the hour that has already been brought to you and i and to create a desire in your heart to cry and pray for this message to be made alive in our lives to search our lives for sin and then to move on with it god's waiting on you and i yes adoption time when he can pour in his fullness what is that what was the holy ghost given for number seven waiting on you and i the church is waiting on you and me and you adoption time when god can pour into it to us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church in christ becomes so close together until christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go in the rapture so the visibility of christ among us is going to raise the dead the faith that's connected to each one of those ages is going to bring them out god's waiting as the ego stirreth his nest to get his church in order he's waiting on you and me may he grant the blessings that's for the elect's sake he says it's overlapped it's lapped over time for the elect's sake like it was in the days of noah god's waiting for your reply conference number nine what is your reply i'll serve you lord i want the holy ghost or i don't want it i won't have it i'll take it away i believe you heal me god's waiting to hear what your decision is you're the one who has to make it he's done his he's proved that he made his now you've got to make yours waiting on you and i be certain of god god's waiting he's been if you've been anointed and prayed watch about healings and things god's waiting to see what you'll believe about it not run up next sunday and run the next day and until the next healer comes through the city he's waiting to see your reaction on your faith not walk back next day and say well i feel so bad i don't guess i got healed you're not fit for the prayer line in the first place right every present water from the rock this great pentecostal move today god is waiting for you to call him on the scene you're not watch you're not out of speaking distance with him you're not out of speaking distance with him though we've done wrong and sinned and turned our backs on him and done things we ought not to do but yet he's with us christ said he'd be with us god's waiting a true sign overlooked it's some part you have to do god's waiting for his church to call him he's always did it god's waiting today for the people to call his servant into action and the servant can't get into action till the people prays i've seen that for 40 something years folks and wondered why and cried and prayed that i couldn't get nobody to believe what i was talking about did i believe the prophet talked about it or what we would be well i guess in a way no look what he says on the message and thy seed shall possess the gates of the enemy if you'll stay with the word then god's seeing if you abide in me and my word in you his he cannot deny is his word then there'll be a time sometime when you'll be taken out and set aside and be given something that's genuine hallelujah power of the almighty god which god is waiting for his children but they just won't line up when they come to that testing time will you accept it well the church will put me out all right there you are then go that's not abraham's seed something like that lifting him out of history that's why i said there's a lot of these messages he's talking about healings and things it's the same today he's waiting anxiously for his people to call him on the scene to action you need healing today god's waiting on you to call him on the scene well now lord when you get around to it you can heal me if you don't just let it go like that fella said you know lord if you can't do it then just we'll just go ahead and do it then no you know what he meant he was saying if lord if you don't want to heal me right now just zap me is that what we're saying we can't wait patiently for healing and things and i never thought i'm honest i never thought the older you get the less sickness you got i thought that was kind of reverse well the older i get the more sickness i get doesn't mean i'm more sinful we're back to this morning's message oh right you don't expect these kids to be eat up with arthritis but after a while you kind of begin to realize that you know that old stuff's getting me a kid sister gene and i asked her when i see her i shake her hand i said how's arthur doing she said he's pretty rough sometimes yeah well she knows what i'm doing about it i'm talking about arthritis i ain't talking about some guy i'm talking about this old age now that doesn't mean i've got to lay down my wife will say to me honey you're hurting you say you don't know what hurting his brother damn no you don't know what it is i stood here today holding this pulpit i can't turn it loose that's how old i'm getting because i'm afraid my legs grabbing under me right well why don't you sit down and take it easy no way he gets this boy he's gonna fight a battle he's gonna struggle to get me that's why i say how you doing wonderful why don't you tell somebody you're sick does that help does it ever help anybody tell them you're sick no but listen look what he says here about a few things call him on the scene watch him go up in to move us watch him do the supreme watch him do things that man will wonder and scratch their heads and don't understand he's the historical god and a present day god he's waiting to be called out of history some of you have backslid and done with that which is wrong and you lost your joy and your water is dried up he's still in speaking distance he follows you he knows every move you make and everything you do he's longing to hear you call him on the scene you know what he's doing he's here tonight waiting to be proved you know what you ought to do we're to do like they wake jesus that's in us how many do you need of that wake jesus in us oh no if we get it everybody else you know oh we're doing great wake jesus in us lord come on the scene amen move among us and i listen folks i'm not one that prays for god to send signs and wonders among us i pray for god to come among us now if god comes among us there's always going to be signs and wonders where god's at so you pray for the signs and wonders you pray for the dew and this i pray for the presence of god amen that's right you pray for the speaking in tongues or shouting the crying the good feelings i pray for the word to be opened and then i've got what i asked for you mean you don't want to see signs and wonders brother that walk come on they want the word first then signs and wonders followers the word as brother harris used to say it he said well believers don't follow signs signs follow believers because that's true you get a believer here god's going to be here like i said about your brother wednesday night i you know me and him sat down tall we'd probably differ he might have said some things you didn't agree with him nobody but there's one thing about it he had a good goal a good thought in mind all right now that's what i'm looking for somebody with a positive attitude well i don't know maybe one of these days just remember we don't have a lot of days but we got a great god let's stand come on brothers we've got a great god god's waiting on you and i to call him on the scene you need healing call him on the scene you know how you call him on the scene remind him of what he said i mean if i told you i'd be down at your house this evening at five o'clock and i didn't go you know what you'd say you said she was you lied did you mean it to start with well why not call god on the scene and say lord you promised amen you know what i remind him every day he told me years ago that you'll be here you'll be there with your offspring you give me other scriptures to fit in with it and time you know what i do when i pray i said lord remember your promise are you trying to make god do it no no i got enough sense to know better now i'm just reminding him what he's saying right i mean i tell one of my kids i said look i'll give you so and so you know what well no problem for them to come along and say daddy when you're going to give it to me well see i might tell them like god tells us i'll give it to you when i want to because that's what he does sometimes right but you know what ain't going to keep him doing and you know what one i like the most where the little boy wanted to bicycle you know the story he come to his dad and he kept saying daddy are you going to get me a bicycle and the daddy says no son it's too expensive costs too much money i'm not gonna get you the bicycle yeah but daddy you told me i said son i told you i'd get you a bicycle but said they are very expensive and we don't have any money something to that degree so when christmas time come there set the bicycle under the tree he said but daddy you said you couldn't get he said no i didn't say i couldn't get it he said i just told you i wasn't gonna get it he said cause i already had it when you asked me well you know god's already got it just remind him amen i quote that scripture almost every service right he sent his word and healed us and delivered us from destruction that's just reminding him you think he gets mad because i remind him no he gets mad when i won't remind him because he begins to wonder you mean you don't believe me come on kids come on folks we're adults your kids begin to doubt whether you'll do something or not maybe maybe in one respect you got a lot to write down but i'm talking about really the right pla you know and the kids begin to doubt you're doing something when you've never broke your word before god wants somebody to call him on the scene because he said it lord you said you'd be with me and then be with me we pray before we go somewhere right in the car or something right and we pray lord take care of us turn back don't just pray for thyre because you've got to die in the back kids will be going somewhere something said daddy we're going to be gone three or four days i don't pray well lord take care of them getting there i said lord take care of getting there and bring him back home because that's the other side of the journey what do we got boys i believe go ahead i believe god i believe god you believe him he's waiting on you and i to call him say lord i love you do you ever tell him that sometimes i walk through the house you know just and they say lord i love you i'm gonna love you well the prairie green said run around and told him one day he said brother perry said when you feeling close to you he said tell him that brother branham loves him i believe you love god don't you but why can't we love it you know what to a lot of people they'd rather give you a gift card from walmart for a hundred dollars than to say i love you we went to churches we've been places that people just didn't say i love you wade said told me a certain church we went he said daddy don't hug him people and tell him you love hey brother good to see you i love you he said they'll think wrong about you let them take what they want to you know what you go to that church now you walk among them people and everybody just love you brother love your sister you know you don't think sometimes you're catching how many told your wife you love her i really like the german was wednesday you know that old staunch german guy you know his wife said well honey because you don't tell me you love him no more he said i told you 20 years ago when i married you and if i change my mind i'll let you know well that's good but you know it's really nice to hear somebody say i love you right this is how i love you what about it do you love him tell him every day brother dale you've told us you're not a prayer warrior no sir i'm not one that just gets down and pray but i believe i fit in the category the bible says pray without ceasing because you can't get down and pray without ceasing and live as a human life but you pray without ceasing is just when you think about it you say lord i love you lord help the people be with the people bless the people be with us i never let a service come that ever who's coming to do i pray for him that week lord now you be with brother gibby wednesday night because that's the way you're going to be here to speak to us you know what he can come if you believe it if you don't believe it it won't work one more let's go what do we got go ahead pick it up i will bless his name okay what if i told you that means i love you and when i raise my hands i want god to know that i love him that's what i'm talking about there i shake your hand and tell you i love you but i want him to know that i love you one more time he is i will bless his name again he is here listen closely hear him calling out your name he is here you call him on the scene sing it unto him as you're leaving and sing it to one another he is here you're dismissed hallelujah he is here
