the directions we want to make sure everybody understand that where they won't be running to the Memorial Park they had water damage in the building and cannot have it there so remember that we really appreciate uh the opportunity to known brother George a long time you know really it was an odd thing brother Joe gave me a a paper written where that they were playing the uh just playing music continually of brother Bram singing you know in the worship services and uh that was sometime in the afternoon on Friday that brother random comes down and he says this says there's a he's singing uh in the suite by and by and he says there's a land amen that is and it says just worship him just worship Him him Faith Can can Faith I can see by faith I make my choice there Waits I see all the Lord over there George an odd you know an odd coincidence and he said brother George and he called a brother Steward Steward Seward you know and brother Joe and him running it back and and listen to it I believe he's in that land so you know he's mate his part now we've got to do our part amen because he's waiting on us to to be able to pull him out of the Grave all right so remember that remember the uh I said now this afternoon from 5: to 9: and then Monday will be the funeral at 4:00 and uh now remember the Lord willing brother Aaron will be preaching this afternoon all right then the fellowship meeting will be this coming Saturday at brother Coran's we'll be leaving about 10:00 so if you want to ride with us or go along make sure to let us know and everything and going there uh we made up an offering the other day for brother Ernie villan NOA which has been having a lot of problems with his feet not able to work he called me yesterday and said to make sure and thank all of the people for the love offering that you know they we had sent unto him uh brother Bill Y is still not doing too good so remember him and pray that the Lord would be with him brother longor I didn't know this till the other day brother longor has been real sick had pneumonia had an asthma attack and different things I talked with him uh Friday I guess somewhere in there and anyhow he's doing better but he said keep praying for him that the Lord would touch him so remember remember them any other announcements I generally forget something amen so let's pray father we thank you for this day and we ask you now that you would just guide us as we try to speak about you and just come Among Us Lord and manifest yourself because you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction and we thank you and we commit everything into your hands now remember these that are sick Lord and for Brother Bill yonstar Lord and for brother Lor and for brother Ernie Lord and all of these and just remember especially today the the Canada family as in the loss of their loved one and we pray that you would just touch each one have your way in our hearts and lies today in the service forgive our sins lead us all in Jesus name amen Romans we just want to skip over and just take a little thought today and to uh speak something that you know we've been looking at and then knowing we'd come back to it eventually Romans 8:1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the to see the weakness of the law was not in the flesh there is no way anybody in the flesh can keep the law that's right so it's not meaning the law is weak the law is spiritual but we're carnal but see there is no way that a man in the flesh can keep the law so then all it does it just keeps condemning you we've been over that and over it uh the law just puts you in jail all right for that the law for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteous of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be SP spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if soey that's the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but it's the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit work mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debors now what not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh he shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live you may be seated to the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I don't know what we will be speaking on next I'm not concerned I just wait for him and I'll take the messages as they come and uh you know we can speak every what he gives us but I just kind of concluded there the other day the thought that we've been on on marriage and divorce and trying to bring it to a conclusion and coming down to the things we were speaking of of the law and how that it was uh spiritual but we were carnal the law is right but man can't keep the law there's no way see the only person that can keep the law is a born again believer I hope you follow that see those under the law back there they couldn't keep it it was just a it kept overbearing on them so hard until there was no way but the born again Christian can keep the law but he can't keep it still by his flesh that's right he must mortify the Deeds of the flesh you know to be able to do that but I hope you you enjoyed the series I made on that and and all and I you know I tried to make the point and you'll see what I'm meaning in a minute because of coming to this scripture CU what did we cover first that this is a point to come up to here we covered that in the New Birth your old husband must be dead not just divorce not just run around with him you know and see him today and flirt around with him tomorrow and and all that old husband supposed to be dead the world because our old husband was our natural adamic nature that came by the Fall that's why we needed to be born again all right see then God let it die we went through that over and over because there's no way you and I can be saved salvation Jonah 2:9 is of the Lord Lord so then the only thing could be happened is we could just yield ourselves all in the world we could do was do as the man that was to be shot you know if he' had just accepted the pardon and walked out everything would be all right because that's all we can do we can just accept what he does that's right for us because it all is totally of him you say but I sought god well the Bible says no man sought God at any time I like the scriptures don't you the Bible said the goodness of God leadth us to repentance you said you ever you don't believe in crying and praying for the Lord yes that's fine right but that's just getting you out of the way I believe in fasting but you know what fasting is far it's just to get you out of the way that's all it is it's to it's just to get to where the body doesn't control right in the inward parts of you can come out and work because it's just you know but as far as fasting you can fast every day day life and still die and go to hell that wouldn't have anything to do with it whether you're born again or not and the only way to be born again is by the revealed word amen right how can they hear without a preacher and how can he preach unless he be sin all right so we went through that as a new birth and seeing that God you know is the one who came on the scene to let that old life and things die then we went into the marriage and divorce of the marital situations and the the grace of God to be given to the Bride In the End Time amen but that's only to the bride that can receive it right it is not for everybody because the new birth is not for everybody the new birth is for only those that can receive it all right everybody won't receive it that's where the trouble's that all right so we went through that to see that God let that die in his sea of forgetfulness that he could put a p our past apart from us amen yet everybody body else can remember it I I said if I ever get enough gumption to bring it I want to preach on a god with amnesia you know where he he he can forget not only that he totally forgives that's right and it's totally out of existence as far as he's concerned amen but we can still remember it but he can't remember it amen you know and they made a song years ago that you know that was about it said what sins are you talking about well that's true if it's under the blood we'll get to that in a minute all right but then we ended up with the fact of seeing that our old denominational husband because the prophet of God said it like this he said we're free from our sins by accepting Jesus Christ but he said we're still Bound by our Creeds and dogmas he said well I don't have any Creeds and dogmas well praise God pray for me right because those things are Creeds and dogmas are your ideas that are contrary to the word amen that's right you think you need to do this to do that to do this to do that to be saved that's a Creed and a Dogma that is not the word of God and I gave you the quote from the prophet the other day where he said they asked the people there you know what must we do to be saved and said we would tell them what to quit doing and what to go do he said but they didn't ask that question they wanted to know what to do but there was nothing to do except believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and th sh be saved then your life follows after what your confession is right right see that that's why we're against the world and the things because you go out and see people living like the world doing like the world dressing like the world but yet claim to be Christians well that doesn't fit too good in the in the category but I hope you understand what I'm saying see that old husband the Bible tells us we must be Washed by the Water of the word all right or washing by the water of the word if you want to be technical all right now in doing that what did we find the only way that old husband could die of organized religion is for God to reveal the word to us all right we read our last the other day where what that the prophet of God said on Feast of the trumpets that the Holy Ghost had been bound for 2,000 years at the door of Creeds and dogas but would be loosed by the end time message it didn't say it would be loosed by the end time messenger no right all right but the bride must become one with the message which is the revealed word and by becoming one with the message then our old husband will die that's right and get R of him sure we still have trouble he tries to come back up but we keep pushing him down so that's what we want to talk about now here in our scripture today because we want to look at it in the correct way to understand so we read it says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus amen all right right now see taking it to try to see the revealed word is what is the New Birth the revealed word is what tells you the truth of marriage and divorce the revealed word is letting our old denominational husband die our understanding our beliefs our thoughts right yeah but I I'm out of organized religion that's good did you but has God got that out of you you know see what what's the difference in moving coats and hats you know what I mean one place to another amen if you don't intend to go on with God what they need a moveing that's right amen why don't we just go down and get us some crackers and start Wafers and start being Catholic if we don't intend to go on we just go back to them and sit down and wait all right not sarcastic just being truthful I'm speaking of where we should be and what we should be doing and doing it but now see we look at the scriptures and we'll read that part and we say I'm a born again Christian so there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus then we like to read the psalmist where he says you know Paul in Romans but quoting back from and it actually is not in the Psalms and the and that David didn't say the blessed is a man to whom God will not impute sin like we think we'll get to that if we have time but it Paul when Paul read it he said what was being said all right now but does it give us a license to steal to be wrong or what because we're a Christian you know is it okay to just live any life you want to as taught by organized religion and and don't organize religions in this message that are worse than the ones that are out dire right I mean is it all right is it okay for us to do it because we say well I believe in Jesus Christ you know I mean we are we so blind until we can't see the truth and then you know is it that we believe well you know the Bible says I'll get to it in a minute if our heart condemn us not but we leave off the next few words because it goes on to say that God is greater than our heart am why would it say that right we say yeah but I just won't let my heart condemn me I'll accuse that of being the devil amen you know I I'll say the devil's one trying to Dem me well I don't have much problems I don't know about you but I don't have much problems with the point of whether or not I'm guilty do you I mean I I can remember and I can you know realize my state I'm in but yet see we can say well I just won't let my heart condemn me I I'll say that's the devil condemning me I ain't going back to that church no more cuz they preached about me well did they tell the truth I mean no problem Oh Brother uh years ago he was sitting on the platform this willing back and I won't call his name but he had on two tone shoes you know well that back in the days of coming through Pentecost and things and the preacher was Raising Cane about things and he looked around and then the boy jumped on them two-tone shoes well the brother I guess he was trying to you know get his shoes up under him or do something but it was two-tone shoes you know that's what he's beaten on well but you know what the man did have on two-tone shoes yeah I mean and I've told my people about years ago we used to talk about what to do and and everything when certain brothers would come around you know we we were told to not wear certain clothes cuz they going to preach on it you know I mean that's no joke that's going back but knowing the preacher preach on it not meaning ungodly clothes I'm talking about just certain ones and this one old brother he he used to come around and he used to preach about a entt dress well I'm just so carnal I don't know anything anyway and I didn't know what a entt dress was so you know we'd heard so many sermons about it I went to my wife and I said honey what is a entt dress and the way she described it you know was where that it kind of goes out but then it was kind of tucked in some way up here you know not all together than knowing even yet what it is but some way it was done like that was kind of tucked in and and hung out a lot and it's called a tent dress and I said well I still don't know what a ENT dress is I said would you mind pointing out one you know because I I I don't go around see my wife will say what did Brother so and so have on today cloth you see I I wanted to know what a tent dress was I said Point some out honey and she said well that's them sisters right over there well you know where them sisters right over there was they come from from where the brother was the pastor they were talking about the tent dressing I said what don't he pick on these people said they're picking on everybody you know but we come or should be able to come through those things but still my point is if our heart condemn us not well I just won't let it condemn me but see the rest of the scriptures you need to read all of it he said God knows the heart right you know you're not pulling nothing over on anybody but your own self that's right you know people look got you in life and you're trying to convince them or something you ever noticed that you ever notice people trying to convince you of something it's okay to do this okay to do that isn't it they're trying to convince you of what they think all right but you see God knows the heart all right now a simple I mean maybe an odd way of approaching things but there is no condemnation the scripture says to those that are in Christ Jesus but now Paul never stopped there right he continued by saying who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit right now he didn't leave it as a loophole and well Paul said see we can quote Romans and we can say blessed is a man to whom God will not impute sin well I can just do anything I want to then well go ahead I think you ought to do what you want to that's right I do I mean I try to do what I want to don't you I thought a Christian was supposed to be in that category to let it be Christ Living in us so there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh that's right if we walk after the flesh the holy spirit will automatically condemn us true right I mean somebody have to come along tell you that's wrong if it is you have seared your conscience that's right you have got to word that you're not listening to what anything can tell you amen right well it don't bother me to wear these clothes well you know maybe you need to get born again might change things and Heaven help you if you dress here one way and dress another way out in the world Amen you know now that would be a hypocrite that's right that's the best way to say it that's why I've always said to a lot of times the people here don't go out and tell people where you go to church if you're going to dress outd like you do here you know in act don't don't don't tell them where you go oh that's a lamb basting on me you know that's where people don't understand me they say but brother Dale brother so and so preached a message one day on there is therefore now no condemnation them that are in Christ Jesus and and I felt so wonderful and so sweet and I just had no guilt yeah I I wish I could preach that away but you know I found out a long time ago like I said about the scripture where he said if our heart condemn us not I found out to keep reading it says for God is greater than my heart and you know what according to 1 Corinthians 11 which is the communion scriptures that I love the Bible says there if we judge ourselves will not be judged so we don't judge ourselves else you know what we're going to do we're going to be judged there's no such thing as a Christian now being judged of whether or not they're going to heaven now forget that now cuz there's two judgments in the Bible one of them is a white Throne judgment which means the people stand there will be judged whether or not they receive eternal life the other one is the Judgment of the Deeds that we do in the body that we're going to have to give an account for if we don't repent amen right I'm a firm believer in one thing getting things straight while we're here amen oh all I want to do just get there well you're more you're bordering on the basis that you don't give a hoot right about salvation right why wouldn't you want to live right why wouldn't a Christian want to do right and live right when you're a living example before your families your friends your loved ones why wouldn't you want to live right well I stand before my God the Bible says if a man looks on a woman to lust after he's committed adultery with her in his heart right and an explanation comes from the prophet like what you present yourself wrong and they do that you're guilty a woman can't help being a woman right I mean we're not old timey but you can't help being what you are you can't help being built the way you are but you can help you know from being the point of trying to make people lust after that you know what you're doing when you put on tight clothes right you know what you're doing you're trying to show your form you're trying to live in a byone days of 16 year old you know right hey I get up look in a mirror too just like you do like I've always said there's been more muscles torn by weightlifters in front of mirrors than they have on a bench press CU you get in front of the mirror it I wish I had brother forny I could really do a good job and you know I do I get up a morning I look in the mirror I looked pretty good then I turn to walk out and that old belly go as long as I can walk straight all the time I wouldn't look too bad come on do a little comical to make you think though but you see we say that would my heart don't condemn me the prophet say like this he said you got no more conscious than the snakes got hips well that's pretty good point is it but you see it doesn't leave the Bible that's what I love about it it doesn't leave loopholes you show me loopholes in the Bible it's not there if our heart condemn us not well I just won't let it condemn me and God said but God is greater than your heart in other words you'll automatically know you're doing wrong or should then we read that there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus but we fail to read to those who walk walk not after the flesh right but after the spirit Paul then goes on to say we walk after the flesh we are ruled by the flesh that's right but if we walk after the spirit then we're ruled by the Holy Spirit that's right then is it saying about David that Romans would say and Paul saying that blessed is a man to whom God will not impute sin was it David was a certain kind of a person that uh so you know God loved him so much it didn't matter what David done I will remind you as I said the Bible doesn't have loophole that we can follow into or C try to crawl into the same Bible that speaks of David it blessed is a man to whom God will not impute sin the same Bible said David you will not build me a house am I right that Solomon will build a house because there's too many problems in David's life for David to do it the same God that we talk about blessed Is He To whom God will not impute sin the same God took a child that was born out of wedlock from David and took the life of the child you see there's not any loopholes in the Bible to try to crawl into or find something you know it's straight so then we should never have the idea or thought well I won't let my heart condemn me I'll just believe what I believe and then I'll turn around and justify Myself by saying well you know I don't live much worse than that other person so if they going to make it yeah maybe I can right the Bible says always judging ourselves comparing ourselves with one another and never gets us anywhere it right what was the difference in David and anybody else I've preached to you before all of these things right what was the great thing about Abraham that God would choose him was he a special guy you and why would it speak of David to say he's a man after my own heart was it something special of course now we get into the message of the hour of the people of the message of the hour and they make David some great big seed right seed s e e d seed and then they'll say well now wait a minute then that blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin is that seed what is the seed of God we say well the seed of God's his word that's right amen well did David have something special no he had a lot of flaws but the one thing David had that God loved was an honest and a contrite heart right the one thing about Abraham was what not a special guy or some seed relationship but he believed God how many people in the days that have always Illustrated of Abraham did God speak to maybe a lot of them but none of them wouldn't do what Abraham done and God knew that by his forn knowledge so what is the seed of God that we talk about all of this message people seed seed seed I thought we believed in God by his for knowledge knew what we would do and wouldn't do I thought that was the Simplicity of it was God's forn knowledge allowed him to be able to look down and see that Jacob would cherish the birth right do everything he could get conniving stealing to get the bird right and that Esau would just so what I care about the birth R I'm hungry see did God for orain all of this to be or is it that he know it would be which one is it I have no problem with predestination for knowledge right come in here with a seed in you I have no problem with that that's the words the prophet said I have problems with our interpretation amen upon those things right see then you find the people a lot of times that are preaching those doctrines um their lives are not too good then they go off into polygam and everything in the world cuz why because if you ever get to the bases you think well it don't condemn me to do wrong you know that that is Catholicism you know that in Catholicism you are allowed the fact of paying a Penance price to forgive your sins before you do them that's Catholicism to pay for the pay to be forgiven before you even do it I'm I'm sorry I'm I'm a little bit dumb I guess I don't mind admitting that stupid got a different point on that but I just can't believe stuff like that you know and mean you come up and you tell me say well brother Dale it's okay let's just all go get drunk and grows do everything want to go we're born again we're going to heaven anyway I'm too old I'm sorry maybe that but you know I didn't believe that when I was 20 years old I didn't believe that for coming to message I told you about them coming to me trying to get me to come to church when I was young kid you know a boy I told him I said well I live a better life than your Deacon board and they didn't want to argue with me about it see I mean it then I mean it now there's no loopholes in the Bible there's no places to try to slide through the best thing to me as I see is stand up and face God straight ahead and take what he says you have many in instances in the Bible now if I get them wrong making the ones but you know sometimes it would offer to the children of Israel you can do this you can do this you remember that in the Old Testament you can you can fight the enemy you can do this you can do things or said you can be in the hand of God immediately they chose the correct thing and they said we'll be in the hand of God you remember that in the scripture get back in the Old Testament and read a little because see I'd rather be in the hand of God than be in the hand of my enemy yeah but God's going to he's going to do this he's going to do that but what's your enemy going to do see my whole point I wish I could change it to a a great thing I've got a title no condemnation I wish I could come out and preach you know so beautiful a sermon that that everybody hear it say I don't feel condemned and the only way you can ever come to that is the truth to be made known to you I don't believe in once saved always saved no didn't believe that in the Baptist I believe truly born again you are born again that's right and that you will not want to do the things of the world that's right I didn't say you wouldn't do things wrong that's right I didn't say that see I believe in God he has so made a way for you and I to take care of our problems that's right the first thing is to repent amen right yes and David an honest and a contrite heart David was quick and we life about it but he was quick to give an honest judgment yes when the prophet said this man had these sheep this man his neighbor had one he went over and took the one David was quick to give his judgment kill the man bring him here he said David th art the man changed the whole scene didn't it but did David start running around well okay but I'm I'm I'm just telling you I didn't do that he surely wouldn't have told the prophet that would he that's right you've heard all these lies about me now Prophet no he didn't do that he fell on his face before the prophet and began to cry out the prophet said but David you won't die why he said because I prayed for you y and we talk about the grace of marriage and divorce and the grace of Salvation the there's a lot of Grace in The Bible yes it amen you realize it didn't matter where he was king or what he was he was to have been killed for what he done it wasn't because he was King that he was fired many kings died but it was because the prophet received the Revelation from God and prayed for the man and went down and said you won't die because I have prayed for you amen right you realize what he was doing was it Nathan Nathan had interceded with God Amen for David amen Nathan knew the laws the strictness of God the condemnation and he knew David was dead and he knew that probably he would be the one to have to kill him right cuz nobody else wouldn't have tried it David was King but a prophet couldn't fear nothing you know I love it to look at the word and see those things I know you see things from movies but yet still truth is truth you read your Bible that when the prophet went before Saul all Saul had to do or David had to do is just go whack your old boy's head off right you never even thought about Moses going down to Egypt before the Pharaoh why didn't the Pharaoh said hey cut his throat shut him up he's afraid of him see those kings Saul even inquired and said what has God told you he said God has told me your kingdom will be rent from you so reads your Bible didn't rent and RAV and scream and holler he humbly bowed himself to the prophet to accept what had been done because he knew from his heart that he was guilty that's what I mean by when I started off with it if our heart condemn us not see Saul knew the God was right David knew that God was right being a Christian don't give you a license to steal as we call it like brother Mo used to make a little comment about it you know you say well the Bible says Thou shalt not steal he said but it don't say not steal chickens ain't no scripture says don't steal chickens but are you listening to what I'm talking about are we trying to find loopholes to be able to slide through instead of taking it standing up face value I know I offended some of you what I spoke on marriage and divorce and I've always spoke because you know it and I said some people would not be able to get their marital situation straight and thereby you would have to die and go by the grave I know that's offensive but it's a truth amen if I had a marital situation I would stand before the church and say I'm guilty and I'm not trying to find a loophole but pray that God will speak to me and have a Grace and I wouldn't blame you for it being brought up come on a great man one day rle with an angel all night the next day he wouldn't let let him go right he said I won't let you go until you bless me that's right but what was the blessing he got a limp y right right didn't the man ever complain about the limp is any record he ever gried about it right he knew that that limp was a blessing right right I remember preaching a message many many years ago how many of you remember the bless the blessings of a blemish a blessings of a blemish you got a whole field full of sheep yeah and you go out there and you look around you're looking for one to make a sacrifice right and you look down and you look at them and you say well this one has a blemish you can't use it this one has a blemish you can't use it they got to live because of their blemish that's right right the blessings of a blemish but see the main thought I had then and the main one I have now is there is a way to get rid of a blemish right right instead of making a blemish a curse he got a name change to Israel that went with his blemish right the chosen of God David you're not going to die you got a blemish but I've prayed for you to try to cover your blemish that was the only way it could be covered if you understand what I mean it didn't matter if you were king or what you done in God's word death to do these things he said you won't die but you got to blemish the rest of your life and you will not be able to build me a house can you see David God let me build my house oh I'm so pitiful I'm talking about me and you amen right we say yeah I know I've done wrong in my life but there's no need of people keep bringing it up you done it right why you stand up with enough gut sometimes to just say hey I've done these things I'm guilty and God forgive me you know that way God can forgive you that's I'll clap to that in myself that way God can forgive you right you said well brother D you telling me I can't make the change I didn't say you couldn't go to heaven you see no loopholes in the Bible or to change the title I guess to that no loopholes those that amounted anything in the Bible had many flaws yes but yet they believed in a savior amen they believed in an atonement yes was job arguing with those three that he was so perfect have you read the book of job lately did he argue with him I haven't done what you said I've done you don't find job doing that job said I made the atonement that God said for me to make and said I made it not only for me I made it for my family you know and God honored that atonement why do you think a Christian needs an advocate is that the Bible the Bible said we have an advocate with the father Jesus J Christ the righteous what do you need an advocate for if you're not guilty that's right see then it was Romans Paul talking about what David was saying in the Psalms and bringing it down to blessed is a man to whom God will not impute sin David was looking at back there and I mean Paul was looking back there and seeing that God never made a record because right David repented David repented for what he done he didn't run around and try to justify it you don't understand it's her fault I just followed the L to the flesh it's her fault he said yeah and you had 500 lust if you wanted it at home right do you understand what I'm trying to get at folks right do we use the Bible and the things to try to justify our our ways of doing or do we look at it straight and say God forgive me right which one is it you can only prop up so long you know cuz somebody's going to come by and expose you right you can say so long I'm not guilty but you know what I love about it I love it when God says I'm not guilty right then I don't care what anybody else says about how guilty I am right sister Gil it's when he says I'm not guilty David's sin was imputed to him but not the fact of losing his soul our sins are recorded unto us unless we repent we had a sister here played the piano with us for years and this is what we were T we were preaching about and she said I got to the place I wondered who do I repent to she said then if I'm who you say I am that I'm God in flesh I have nobody to repent to I said there's where you messed up that's right cuz that was what not that was not what was being taught when I'm talking about that you're God in flesh I'm talking about in that Soul by the new birth is the only Godly partner is to any of us right amen there is nothing in these flesh and spirit Realms of you and I that are worth anything oh but I remember so so done this look what they done look what he trying to do go back to works why not look straight into God's face and say I'm sorry because remember how I preach it some of you could take the thought right now and continue it right what brother collie does something to me I I do something to him you know I need to get rid of it the Bible says immediately said Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath right amen right CU if not what am I going to do the next day well you know I'm not I'm not quite as guilty as I thought I was you know about two days later you know he's guilty and I'm not I've come out of beautiful you it was his fault it wasn't my fault cuz I run into the back of that car the car ought not have been there that's right right see we wind up justifying ourselves condemning everything around us that's not what's in the Bible amen if our heart condemn us not we have confidence with God yes right how is it that it can be that my heart won't condemn me when I'm not guilty right right you don't bother me it wouldn't bother me for you to put my name in the in the newspaper Wall Street Journal or whatever you want to put it and say that I robbed a bank that's right say well I ain't guilty but you know what the problem is is when I'm guilty you put my name in there you would not have put my name in there you could have made at least Samuel sobody right and we've trying to find loopholes to get out of something instead of repenting that's right amen it's very easy to say I'm sorry right cheap words all right but now listen to this it's hard to say I'm sorry when I mean it that's right now wait a minute you're shaking your head don't don't don't misunderstand what I'm saying I said it the way I wanted to for me to say I'm sorry it's cheap word words that's right 15 c words that's right but me to say I'm sorry when I know I'm guilty it's hard to do right I want you to be guilty too and then we're all guilty together and who's going to condemn who you see what I'm talking yes David didn't try to find a loophole well was her fault Saul didn't say now you know Lord we needed some sheep you remember the prophet when he told him he said wi's a blat to the Sheep when he said he done took care of everything oh you now Lord you know we needed some sheep to eat that kind of that doesn't work with human being let alone God but an honest and a contrite heart which is the greatest the one who simply says I'm sorry or the one who means I'm sorry see then there it comes to a place somewhere in God through the reveal word that we realize it hey wait a minute this thing don't give me a license to steal but it does show me that I'm not going to hell I'm beginning to realize as David that that somebody's taking my place or doing something I'm beginning to realize that hey wait a minute I've done that I know I've done it I'm guilty but yet God says he don't remember it you see what I meant all of that time of trying to preach about God let it die cuz that old husband can only be dead if God lets it die not you trying to kill it right you can try all you want to you won't kill it that's right you won't kill that old damic nature that's right it'll keep coming up that's right you won't kill that marital situation it'll keep coming up right you won't kill that old organized religious system that's trying to rule us it'll keep coming up that's right so I'm dependent upon God letting it die I said is the Bible said if we judge ourselves we'll not be judged but that ain't all of it right that ain't all that scripture right what's the rest of it but if we are judged amen thank God for judgment amen if we are judged we'll get rid of it you can hide all you want to to whatever doing but you're not going to hide it from God cuz he's greater than the heart right you can pretend to be right all you want to and it won't work that's right right but if we judge ourselves he's righteous and will not condemn us with the world there's the truth of there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus why because are not going to walk after the flesh sure we have trouble with the flesh we live in the flesh Amen brother brandham said what they said brother Rand do you sin he said every day he didn't try to be no holy P self-righteous hypocrite I never will forget the time time that he was talking that man was was rashing him lambasting him about his doctor or something he said him mother's want he said I wanted it myself I just look at him I not meaning that he didn't mad and mean and hateful he just said I want that old boy I'm going to handle this he's human right he was a human being exactly but he was real quick to say I'm sorry when one time they come you know about to tax case and was trying to aggravate him so much and all he told his wife and they called him on the phone the phone rang she said it's them lawyers and things he said tell them I'm not in here and he walked out the door you know he was right he wasn't in there right right he went out the door he wasn't in there right he wife said somebody said well honey I wasn't in there he said Bill and why it got a way of getting at you you know I mean you can say all you want to but a while they'll say sam but he went out to pray for a little child we don't finish that story he goes out to pray for a little child and he starts to lay his hands on him Holy Spirit speaks and said take your dirty hands off now he hadn't lied right he wasn't in the house but he was deceiving with it because is there when the phone rang and who it was on the phone that's right holy spirit said take your dirty hands off he went and called that lawyer and said listen I was in the house and I'm sorry and even the lawyer said I got more confidence in you now than ever had would you be honest enough but then he went back over there and he said bring me that child yes and God healed a child right there we think well it don't matter what I do it's just little simple stuff you remember the Bible says the little foxes is what spoils the Vine I didn't even know brother ROM knew what we call those old things but L you old on don't even know nothing about it there's a little old grape thing grows out in the woods and it's bitters qu ey we used to to eat them they call Fox grapes they claim a fox what eats them so they call them Fox grapes listen to one other day and he said something about Fox grapes you see Church it don't do no good to hide try to cover up W do you a bit of good your sins the Bible says going to find you out so the best thing to do is just say I'm sorry forgive me let's move on you see that's what we can do with one another that's right you simply just say I'm sorry that's right and just move on then of course you can do like a man did work down there one day he said something about me I said you ought not to be saying that now you you apologize to me he said all right all right I apologize I'm going to say it to you I'm sorry that you're sorry see we want always to have an out that's right there something way to handle something instead of just saying I'm sorry let's stand there no loopholes in the Bible no places for us to crawl through but if we will yield ourselves to God and confess our faults the Bible said he's just and will forgive us then when he forgives us what is it come on what is it we've been through justification what is it we say I'm sorry he said you never done it why because they had an advocate you remember bam trying to go down and curse Israel or B one of the two there you know and you know he was telling God now God you know what they're doing he said I don't see it I I don't see it what about a God that could tell the devil and the devil tell him you know they done it here's where they done it I'll show you the picture of it right and he says they never done it said because you don't see the blood that I'm looking through I had a lot of quotes in here and all but you ought to know it there's no sin to a Christian why because we're going to repent it's not that we don't do wrong it's that we disbelieve that we can ask God to forgive us and he will forgive us praise God so I'd rather believe in the atonement than to believe how righteous I am but I find out there's none of my righteousness any good brother R said on the token message he said he cannot impute sin over that token the tokens of baptism of the Holy Ghost if you have that baptism of the Holy Ghost you're not going to die and go to hell it wouldn't matter how bad you sined you could never sin enough his brother Mo used to make the statement you can't sin enough to be lost if you're saved but if you're saved you do not want to sin and then truly you don't want to try to justify it and cover it up or blame somebody else we done what we done we ask God to forgive us what we done I don't have to ask God to forgive me what you done you you don't have to ask God to forgive you or what I done is what we do think on these things go number 47 in the spiral book number 47 anybody have a need I know not why God's wonderous Grace to me he has made anybody have a name oh why unworthy Christ in love redeemed me his but I know it's morning so let's believe that God will provide away and he has through the blood of Jesus Christ and our he is based upon what we can believe right we have condemnation I didn't finish the message brother Mo years ago I wrote it in my Bible an order if you go to be prayed for first thing repent no no I want to be healed first thing repentance you know why cuz then you can never come to the basis if you don't repent your heart will automatically condemn you but if you repent then you can say I repented but your heart will automatically condemn you but God is greater than that heart so it turn around and convict us and we'll ask for forgiveness you know the prophet preached a whole message on it to be healed confess your sins our little buddy doesn't have that kind of problem he just a little fell I'm talking about you and I the confidence we can have in God if our heart don't condemn us we've got confidence the Bible says well I want God to cleanse me right now that I have no condemnation so that I can pray for him right our first thing is God forgive me cleanse me you make me worthy that I can pray Lord Jesus we believe even though we could be guilty of all kind of sins a moment ago we ask to be forgiven and we believe that if we're honest and confess our faults that you'll forgive us now we come before our little buddy bringing him before thy Throne this old Heche this that's hurting the body this tempure body's running we condemn it under the blood of Jesus
