[2:05] ear is your weekend oh the week yes but
[2:07] we don't know the better out okay
[2:10] alright so if you scared you need to go
[2:12] the altar like bottom good about to
[2:14] blend I'm you're scared about these days
[2:16] you didn't go Albert yes right do you
[2:19] want to stay here longer than that
[2:20] go-ahead home got here I'm good that's a
[2:25] good dog late you have a choice yeah you
[2:27] got cause the issue was given on the
[2:30] four think they have marched bc 4 45
[2:33] thats when to build rebuild the temple
[2:37] remember Ezra gotta edit from one of
[2:40] them remember Israel was in captivity
[2:42] right I'm just refresh your memory room
[2:46] was in captivity they couldn't do
[2:48] anything in their own country unless a
[2:51] king told him they could so Ezra went to
[2:55] whoever it was Cyrus or 10 you uncle in
[2:57] and put the names in but he went to one
[2:59] of the Kings and they said okay go ahead
[3:01] well as we went down there started
[3:03] building the city and stop the devil did
[3:08] just what he did before he started he
[3:10] sent people from other nations down in
[3:12] there started getting them getting their
[3:14] mind off what they were doing so they
[3:16] quit for so many years all right then
[3:20] another one goes back and gets them edit
[3:22] an addy is a contract saying you can go
[3:24] build your your city pertinent per man
[3:27] right it was a permit because if not a
[3:30] king that was closer to Israel could say
[3:32] hey you can't be able to have no
[3:33] destroyed but if Cyrus would you love me
[3:36] Persian and all that Darius and although
[3:39] if they say that they need to say hey
[3:41] they told us we can build it through
[3:42] they were safe to degree all right so
[3:45] then we come down to the very end of it
[3:47] the Bible says that the walls were built
[3:50] even in trouble its times dad was 445 be
[3:55] seen near my in your Bible tells you
[3:58] that they built the wall the wall was
[4:00] finished in 52 days 52 days they
[4:05] finished that wall right and that was in
[4:08] bc 4 45 remember the dates from bc goes
[4:11] small
[4:12] as it gets closer to us right goodbye
[4:14] okay 55 something bc is not five hundred
[4:18] more years no it's fine really 4 45 b c
[4:21] is less years to pc or 81 there's no bc
[4:26] zero and go from bc 1 281 wait why
[4:30] Christ could be born in AV and beaten
[4:32] for and crucify maybe 30 MB 34 year ago
[4:35] all right did you think you'd be 34 but
[4:38] you don't need to take that year out
[4:40] that 0 a year now all right bc 4 45 they
[4:43] will issue a fourth to rebuild the
[4:44] temple all right the 49 years we read
[4:48] all that anybody remember that we read
[4:51] all that okay because the fair season is
[4:53] 46 years it took 46 years but it took
[4:57] 49-year years for the inside at 49 years
[5:01] to build that to build a temple all
[5:03] right everybody got that it would be
[5:05] built in trouble sometimes so now the

[13:19] return of Jesus now to us this is
[13:21] happening but to the Jews that has not
[13:25] happened yet okay please fulfilled all
[13:29] these so this is going to be important
[13:31] when we get back to this week right here
[13:33] where he's cut off it worth it the
[13:36] sacrifice an oblation will cease in the
[13:39] middle of the month of the middle middle
[13:40] of the week you're going to find out
[13:42] where these dates go forward and
[13:43] backward and when you find the month

[14:09] not from cell of course it was for us
[14:11] and the people of the press that shall
[14:13] come shall destroy the city now that was
[14:15] ties right cuz remember Daniel 70 weeks
[14:19] covers the people and the city kite has
[14:24] had it
[14:25] Troy that city and take that temple
[14:27] worship away because remember they were
[14:28] still doing temple worship after Jesus
[14:30] died bed resurrecting this ended they
[14:34] were still doing sacrificing right
[14:36] remember they sowed they saw the curtain
[14:39] by God right so you know they were they
[14:43] were literally making stuff you know
[14:45] still thinking that no Messiah's coming
[14:46] but in 87 he's when Tyler's destroyed
[14:49] the whole thing got rid of it there's
[14:51] been no temple worship sure they've been
[14:52] pieces hearing pieces there and they're
[14:54] trying to now but it's going to come
[14:56] together we're reading the damn seven
[14:58] weeks book it's going to come together
[15:00] they're going to be able to go by it
[15:01] doing temple worship that's worth that
[15:07] treaty is going to be signed right here
[15:10] for seven years to let them do their
[15:13] sacrifices let them be Israel legal
[15:15] alone but in the middle of that week
[15:18] he's going to step in that temple who
[15:20] the Antichrist and don't step in that
[15:21] temple and say look I've had enough of
[15:23] this I'm going that's going to make a
[15:26] man but watch after pitchfork a week and
[15:29] Tyson come up and help him sell the
[15:31] people trench to come shall destroy seen
[15:32] sanctuary and the end thereof shall be
[15:34] able to play and to the end of the war
[15:36] desolations of return and he shall
[15:38] confirm the covenant with many for one
[15:40] we know up that has nothing to do with
[15:43] this that's the time of the Gentiles got
[15:45] it we've been over this but I just want
[15:47] to know you know mark it down so we can
[15:49] we can really see what's going on time
[15:51] of the Gentiles now got this little mark
[15:52] right here and just leave it alone for a
[15:54] minute see this little hard for him
[15:55] leave it alone for a minute okay just
[15:59] leave her alone all right so now and he
[16:03] shall confirm the covenant with many for
[16:05] how long one week there's 483 years
[16:10] already finished so there's one week
[16:12] left to the Jews and to get us into
[16:15] millennium and them into the Millennium
[16:16] building of the temple after the rapture
[16:18] takes a lot longer loaning in seven
[16:20] years that the people in the message say
[16:23] that there's only three and a half you
[16:24] left and that's not true according to
[16:26] the Bible toward the prophets message
[16:28] guidance miss 483 years already finished
[16:31] there's exactly seven years left now
[16:34] that's how much that's 2520 days you
[16:36] need to keep that in mind okay that's 25
[16:39] 120 days not 365 and a fourth day that's
[16:42] 360 days to the Year seven years equals
[16:47] 2520 so now look with Nathan one week
[16:53] and in the midst of the week what's in
[16:55] the master middle right here Grand Ave
[16:58] what's up there that little bead mark I
[16:59] put their last year that's when he's
[17:01] gonna cut the Covenant off in the middle
[17:03] the wait right here that will mark my
[17:05] thing he shall confirm to go to me for
[17:09] one way right hook you going to convert
[17:11] a covenant with many for one week now
[17:15] we're in this week that's correct well
[17:19] no that's the government to clean that
[17:21] line and that line really is a seven
[17:23] year it's a seven-year covenant he shall
[17:26] confirm the covenant million for one
[17:27] week he's going to make a seven-year
[17:29] deal with Israel but and in the midst of
[17:33] the week 3 after three and a half years
[17:35] why does that coincide that's gonna
[17:37] coincide with the 1260 days at the
[17:40] prophets prophesied to get out to get
[17:44] out the 144,000 all right he shall cause
[17:50] the sacrifice and the oblation decision
[17:51] for the overspreading of abominations he
[17:53] shall make it desolate even until the
[17:55] consummation that's what brother Brennan
[17:57] saying he said we plane so we find out
[17:59] when that consummation is he said we'll
[18:02] know because you know what the bride
[18:04] knows that when they can find that
[18:06] consummation oh you got a difficult back
[18:08] seven years are 2520 now Pete when the
[18:13] message can't fit that in there because
[18:15] they said they saying that the 70 weeks
[18:18] today will end right here
[18:21] it in there okay sorry cam ok now let's
[18:28] go if you want to you got a t30 you got
[18:33] time of the hen house you got your 1260
[18:35] days 1260 days you got your seven-year
[18:37] coming up right here at the end right
[18:38] which is this week this is what this is
[18:41] the last week got it right now let's go
[18:45] one more to 1977 run around any time to
[18:57] use in 1977 okay now the first one he
[19:00] predicts is in 1960 all right then in
[19:08] nineteen sixty again in conferences the
[19:12] week after I predict these things will
[19:14] take place honey Ephesian Church age
[19:17] don't know when a city and I don't know
[19:20] when it will end but I'll predict it'll
[19:22] be done by 1977 all right I predict not
[19:25] the Lord told me but I protected
[19:27] according to vision right so now the
[19:33] Laodicean Church age he's talking about
[19:35] it ending by 1977 and the church will
[19:39] completely go into pasta since you'll be
[19:40] after that the mouth of God I think
[19:43] that's always been happening all right
[19:44] but what he comes in the 70th week of
[19:47] Daniel we just read it Amanda gonna
[19:49] watch now counting the time this is what
[19:52] we read last last week we find that we
[19:54] have exactly 17 years left we have the
[19:57] same span of time given to us as gone
[19:59] dealing with us in the power of the Holy
[20:01] Spirit sensei d30 don't get confused for
[20:06] 1977 all right now mark down in your
[20:11] book a little scripture here Leviticus
[20:13] 25 8 now take that little piece right
[20:16] there that you see inside the Gentile
[20:18] age and put 1977 so that is a benchmark
[20:21] to me that's to be I think that's what
[20:23] he's telling us why would he bring it up
[20:25] and down 72 h 1 2 3 4 4
[20:31] if it was okay so put 1977 in that world
[20:37] marker wizard Gentile eggs that's 1977
[20:40] so put that down because it's important
[20:41] all right now now mark down your book
[20:46] this is what we was that last week now
[20:48] maybe I lost somebody but we're going to
[20:50] do it again mark down in your book a
[20:51] little scripture Leviticus 25 8 now we
[20:55] went to leviticus twenty five eight one
[20:59] does Leviticus 25 08 say number the
[21:02] Sabbath of days seven sabbaths Sabbath
[21:09] happens over seven years a sabbatical
[21:11] for the resting of the land seven times
[21:15] seven is what now remember the Jubilee
[21:22] is on the 50th year if I got there the
[21:28] Jubilee is on the 50th year or the first
[21:34] year of the next 49 year cycle there is
[21:38] no 50 year than one when they come up to
[21:42] the 49-year the priest said this is the
[21:44] Jubilee the next year is the Jubilee
[21:47] here it's the first year of the next 49
[21:50] dives your overlap all right now here's
[21:54] what brother L said God called the
[21:58] Jubilee every 49 years the fiftieth year
[22:03] was the Jubilee okay the fiftieth year
[22:08] was the Jubilee we know that we
[22:12] understand that from the first jubilee

[22:19] 70th jibley what seventy times seven 490
[22:27] he's telling us something that we really
[22:29] just didn't understand making exactly

[22:35] do you believe that going up to release
[22:36] all right did you get that from kitchen
[22:40] says day man God is dealt with less
[22:42] exact
[22:43] the same amount of time they dealt with
[22:44] the juice don't tell once they went went
[22:48] Leviticus 25 8 he goes way back little
[22:51] bit at this 25 8 10 8 30 a 33-30 dirty
[22:57] right here is 1954 year and now I can
[23:02] fit four years from here to the 1977
[23:04] square he's getting his number okay all
[23:09] right we have about 1937 years we got 17
[23:13] years left of 77 will be the 70th
[23:15] Jubilee since the beginning of you
[23:17] believe now Daniel 70 weeks we have our
[23:23] Jubilee now if you're born again you're
[23:25] in your Jubilee year right we understand
[23:26] them but remember Israel is little
[23:29] Israel it literally is in a jubilate
[23:31] they have a jubilee right the Jubilee to
[23:33] Israel is what the millennium now all
[23:39] right so now this isn't this is 11 you
[23:41] to see from last week if you take all
[23:48] right now you take 1977 is the 70s you
[23:55] believe now that cannot be a 71st
[23:58] Jubilee KBS 71st 1977 was our Jubilee of
[24:06] the message of the hour coming into
[24:08] clarity and the old Pentecostal aids
[24:11] going out twombly Brown shawl that he
[24:14] saw ad he saw in 1977 that something was
[24:18] going out and something was coming in
[24:21] the going out to the Gentile Church and
[24:24] return of Christ of the Jews will
[24:26] reinvent when they go out of bondage
[24:27] well then I'm gonna buy the bondage
[24:28] until they start preaching this message
[24:30] over there I decide when guys started
[24:33] revealing
[24:34] The ministers in the message Greg that's
[24:36] when they got out of that old well and I
[24:38] think 77 all the old ones that felt 77
[24:41] was going to be the Raptor they left got
[24:46] rid of them telling them old father's
[24:48] brother ground safely in the wilderness
[24:49] God had to wait till all those old
[24:51] people that came out of Egypt died in a
[24:55] new generation spring up to go over in
[24:57] the from fling same way today so this is
[25:03] the promised land to Israel remember we
[25:05] read it well you should read Ezekiel 45
[25:10] to 48 it tells about their millennium
[25:12] right huh oh well we may old in in
[25:22] Revelation we rolled in Revelation okay
[25:27] cuz he think what 77 was it now lick
[25:30] don't hear ya think yeah yeah those the
[25:35] ones that came up the word line
[25:36] believers and they died all right hello
[25:38] oh brother watch close now I don't miss
[25:41] it it will be the Jubilee of the going
[25:43] up of the Gentile bride and the return
[25:46] of Christ to the Jew he didn't stop
[25:48] there common when they go out of bondage
[25:52] he said go over together gay he talks
[25:54] about all the time they saw what they
[25:58] saw my brother branham spoke about it in
[26:06] look the tape still playing brother
[26:09] going to look takes to a plan I don't
[26:11] want anyone who misunderstand don't
[26:12] misunderstand now saying brother Monson
[26:14] Jesus will come in 1977 I never said
[26:16] such thing Jesus make hell today but I
[26:18] predicted that between 980 30 but now
[26:21] watch then I remember he had his vision
[26:24] in 1933 right the seven visions came in
[26:30] 1933 so he stands between 33 and 77
[26:33] something would take place and it did
[26:36] okay but watch now if the 70 in 1977 was
[26:42] the 70th Jubilee all right
[26:46] if you count now look he said according
[26:49] to Leviticus 25 8 so at 1977 and 49 it's
[26:58] already a twenty20 26 write that on your
[27:02] chart very laughs mark on the chart very
[27:05] last mark on your chart okay 2026 why
[27:09] because in 22 if we go to 20 27
[27:12] now look I mean I'm not predicting or
[27:15] profit sighing I'm just telling you the
[27:17] dates fit and we may be off a few months
[27:20] or a few weeks or even maybe you got
[27:22] remember if you say you know brother i
[27:24] was killed in 1965 but it was in
[27:27] December he lived a whole year of 1965
[27:30] before he was killed and you'll watch
[27:33] and see when we get into this that one
[27:36] of the Jubilees happens at the end of
[27:38] our year and that is hanukkah around
[27:44] Christmastime around December feast of
[27:46] dedication all right not our faith not
[27:49] our pagan face that we have over here no
[27:52] all right so you take 1977 and act 49
[27:58] years because if we go to 20 27 or
[28:00] beyond I believe we're breaking
[28:03] scripture because that makes you the
[28:04] 71st Jubilee all right that makes it a
[28:09] 71 there's this no 71 Jubilee but gosh
[28:14] way go on this long to get rid of the
[28:18] check you know shape the old people out
[28:20] and get rid of the ones that don't
[28:21] believe that's what happened in Israel I
[28:23] mean really by the way and then yep
[28:25] there is no 71 do with it because from
[28:28] the time that Israel from 445 to Christ
[28:32] that was less rice I've certain a 70
[28:35] people to release their no no 70 70
[28:39] Jubilees okay from the whole from the
[28:42] whole thing yeah back a little bit of
[28:44] his 25 8 all right guys all right so now
[28:47] no it could be 1954 years from 445 a
[28:51] seat across collects four and A three
[28:53] years but you gotta go back to Leviticus
[28:55] and a real good that's my life Schofield
[28:58] because
[28:59] outfits a couple of days he tells you
[29:00] about what time that riddle sit in
[29:03] Daniels time bc 538 it will tell you but
[29:07] so if you go back to leviticus bc 14 9
[29:14] you're going to have a lap back up
[29:16] together 499 54 years all right now
[29:21] we're one 1977 plus 49 is 2026 so the
[29:27] year 20 27 or 28 whatever you want to
[29:31] save doesn't matter to me if we go past
[29:34] that then we're in our 71st you believe
[29:37] there is no safety first qubit there's
[29:39] only one 490 years seventy times seven
[29:42] so if we know though now if we know what
[29:46] time then it ends remember I said we
[29:50] could the consummation this is the
[29:52] consummation everything is destroyed the
[29:56] cities built we come back right in the
[29:58] Millennium these days are going on sure
[30:03] time continues but right here is the
[30:05] consummation that that Daniels talking
[30:09] about it Daniel 9 27 all right right
[30:12] here even until the consummation okay
[30:16] all right the reason you're saying 20-26
[30:21] is because our 490 years is run average
[30:25] that's great you're 490 years of Daniel
[30:28] Stephanie week we're run out in 20 26
[30:31] are some wear their clothes and I'm
[30:33] saying some wear their clothes all right
[30:35] got it but there was 490 years from the
[30:39] time to the tenth the temple started
[30:41] being built to cry that's great from the
[30:43] town yeah it's not on here it's on your
[30:45] on your chart from right here see
[30:47] because look this whole thing of Daniel
[30:49] 70 week can only be four hundred and
[30:54] ninety years now take this out look you
[30:57] got to take Gentile lay down but brother
[31:00] branham the prophet of the hour left us
[31:02] a mark so this is the conservation and
[31:08] if we see according and will show it
[31:12] later on but the reason that that struck
[31:14] me is you know Roosevelt 1974 he showed
[31:17] that we could go to your 20 26 and not
[31:19] break my brother upset well that number
[31:21] 20.6 kept coming up even in people of
[31:24] denominational ideas and views that
[31:28] number keeps coming up and there's two
[31:31] years told you there's two years and
[31:34] we'll look at it next Sunday two years
[31:37] that match remember you gotta have so
[31:41] many moon cycles eighty five or six or
[31:43] something like that twenty-five hundred
[31:45] twenty days x 30 it only happens in two
[31:50] in three years it was not it was a 2014
[31:54] we know obviously that didn't happen
[31:55] it's this year 2016 and 2019 well 20
[32:02] this one won't fit here because that's
[32:04] nine years or ten years basically that
[32:11] one don't fit the Lord offense that one
[32:15] is he got good seven years 1260 plus 11
[32:21] safety 25
[32:22] in 20 days so that's where we got that
[32:26] number by later other way uh-huh you go
[32:33] back to 445 subtract for a 3 comes up to
[32:38] 38 maybe shouldn't be a t-34 45pc to a
[32:45] t-34 anything here well it's not
[32:51] remember we look back over and you got
[32:53] it that's the same thing you got to
[32:54] watch were you year ends in fall and
[32:56] remember he was changed the calendar was
[33:00] changed that's one God hit all this what
[33:02] I'm say it is is we got close as we
[33:04] could get all right we got close as we
[33:08] could get all right but I believe when
[33:11] you come over here and now we've had a
[33:12] profit come on the scene look back and
[33:14] see that time period and he used for 45
[33:17] Big C so I'm going to have to make it
[33:18] fit that's what he said right we've read
[33:20] that ok 44 45 283 alright so now you got
[33:26] to remember though he was crucified um
[33:29] April though they put forth was on
[33:35] Tuesday 5671 crews five and eight 17 30
[33:38] 30 hey now that 445 bc i don't know what
[33:44] time of the year the tech was finished
[33:46] are done you got to remember watch like
[33:48] sent my brother around he got killed
[33:50] 1965 well if he was killing game where
[33:51] the first 1965 that was a whole year
[33:54] short but he died in december 26 and
[33:59] that's a whole nother year where you
[34:00] still not in 1965 you see how much time
[34:03] we got to look at in them there's a lot
[34:05] of time that's what i'm saying it it's
[34:07] not exactly that's close we're going to
[34:10] get real close in here I believe real
[34:13] close cousin one brother Brown said so
[34:16] let's nobody is you believe if I
[34:17] understand that 27 if you believe since
[34:21] the beginning of do you believe with in
[34:24] 1977 so there's a mark we have to go by
[34:26] that nineteen seventy seven is a mark
[34:28] that we have
[34:29] go by alright we go by that mark and if
[34:34] we're right here 1977 was about a run
[34:37] over in there right in the seventh
[34:41] church a all right so now if we put 49
[34:46] years own to that we get 20 26 ad if I
[34:51] got 10 but we got that 1977 plus 49 if
[34:55] you go to 50 that's another new delay
[34:59] you can't help saying first you believe
[35:01] so that would be 71 x 7 and that's not
[35:05] for her name 480 is seventy times seven
[35:09] if I got that there many times that one
[35:13] you've only got that's why I said about
[35:14] that i'm saving the week we know one
[35:16] thing's for sure God is going to deal
[35:18] with em just like 144,000 they know it
[35:20] will be hundred forty-four thousand now
[35:21] there's nobody hundred forty-four
[35:22] thousand into but that's the two
[35:25] prophets calling out 144,000 is gonna be
[35:27] twelve thousand from this tribe don't
[35:29] tell me how God knows that but I know I
[35:31] know that cuz he knows everything
[35:32] there's 12,000 exactly from this tribe
[35:35] in twelve thousand exactly from this
[35:37] traveling 12,000 exactly from this tribe
[35:39] okay now the question came up one time
[35:44] was what about the women and the
[35:46] children diagnosed it four thousand of a
[35:52] tribe of twelve tribes is going to be
[35:54] better if they got cheering that's under
[35:57] eight of them cheering going with it
[35:58] okay guarding only belong to me that's
[36:04] too specific it's really nothing to us
[36:08] but that's how we got our numbers all
[36:11] right so you got your chart look back on
[36:13] a chart look at the numbers that's where
[36:15] we got our numbers then if you take 20
[36:17] 26 and back it up seven years when you
[36:20] go to have a seven years left out for
[36:22] the Raptor to finish up all this this
[36:24] gotta happen to Israel you got 20 19 and
[36:28] we're going to look and see that if he
[36:31] breaks the coated in the midst of the
[36:32] week let's say it was Passover
[36:35] go back three and a half years you got
[36:37] October so we're honing in on a loner on
[36:42] a month now okay what if we don't have
[36:46] enjoy nothing oh I'll still come yeah
[36:51] okay yeah whooping because remember we
[36:55] all here time really do the gym is one
[36:57] gets the time but that last week's got
[36:59] start somewhere it starts when we leave
[37:03] so we can't start until we're gone we're
[37:08] holding up this whole one week demq
[37:10] profits can't prophesied listen let me
[37:14] be real specific if them two prophets
[37:16] have the Holy Ghost when we go in the
[37:19] rapture they might go in rapture somehow
[37:23] they don't have to get to all those
[37:26] after we leave cuz they got the Holy
[37:31] Ghost Eric brother Brown said all holy
[37:33] those believers go interactor now he may
[37:36] make an exception for two prophets but
[37:38] there's somewhere right after we leave
[37:40] they're going to get the Holy Ghost cuz
[37:41] God is going to withdraw from the
[37:43] Gentiles and go over there the Jews
[37:45] they're going to hear a message just
[37:47] like to know that pen cops they're gonna
[37:49] hear a message could be brother branham
[37:50] could be brother Dale could be brother
[37:52] Bob brother Louie weeks any of here a

[38:10] studying how to save it yes how that can
[38:13] travel life stuff and get active lately
[38:16] right right right again let's go what
[38:19] about when they come back come on
[38:22] do I know then the strings they don't
