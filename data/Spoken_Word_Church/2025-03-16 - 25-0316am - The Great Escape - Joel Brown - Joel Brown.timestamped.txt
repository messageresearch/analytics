[4:34] Praise God.
[4:37] Thank for this opportunity give us come
[4:40] together
[4:42] to worship again.
[4:44] I was thinking when brother said that he
[4:47] could remember me by always losing
[4:52] something. I thought long as I don't
[4:55] lose my soul, the rest of that could be
[4:56] replaced. So, but I'm thankful
[5:00] for amen.
[5:04] Well, thank God for us all being here
[5:07] together, you know,
[5:10] and just seek to find God and hold fast
[5:14] to him cuz he won't leave us if we don't
[5:17] leave him. That's right. Amen. We're
[5:19] going to read this morning from Thank
[5:21] you. 1 Corinthians verses 1-13.
[5:26] Amen.
[5:28] Let's
[5:30] pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for
[5:34] this day, you have given us to come
[5:36] together to worship. Father, we pray
[5:38] that all things that we may have in our
[5:40] life that shouldn't be, God, that you
[5:42] would take them away. Lord, let us seek
[5:45] you, Father, and ask you to guide and
[5:48] lead us. Father, let our souls be
[5:50] resting in your word, Father, and let us
[5:53] hold fast unto that, God. For you, you
[5:56] promised that you would give us if we
[5:59] would accept you. You said you would
[6:02] that that all men would be saved. And
[6:05] that's what Lord, we are seeking today.
[6:07] Father, whatever we do, God, we love you
[6:10] and pray God, please forgive us and
[6:13] bless us. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[6:17] Amen.
[6:20] 1
[6:21] Corinthians 13:es
[6:25] 1-13. Though I speak with the tongues of
[6:28] men and of angels and have not charity,
[6:32] I am become a
[6:34] sounding brass or a tinken symbol.
[6:40] I have the gift of prophecy and
[6:42] understand all mysteries and all
[6:45] knowledge. And though I have all faith
[6:48] so that I could remove mountains and
[6:50] have not charity, I am nothing.
[6:54] And though I bestow all my goods to feed
[6:57] the poor, and though I give my body to
[7:00] be burned, and have not charity, it
[7:03] profited me nothing.
[7:06] Charity suffers long and is kind.
[7:09] Charity hideth not. Charity long not
[7:13] itself is not
[7:17] doth
[7:19] not believe itself seemingly seeketh not
[7:24] her own is not easily provoked nor
[7:27] thinkketh no evil
[7:31] not in iniquity but rejoices in truth
[7:38] and beareth all things and believeth all
[7:41] Hope all things endureth all things.
[7:46] Charity never faileth. But
[7:49] wheecies, they shall fail. Where there
[7:52] be tongues, they shall cease.
[7:55] Whe it shall vanish away.
[7:59] For we know in part, and we prophesy in
[8:04] part.
[8:05] But when that which is perfect is come
[8:08] that in part shall be perfect. When I
[8:12] was a child, I spoke as a child. I
[8:15] understood as a child. I thought as a
[8:17] child. But when I become a man, I put
[8:21] away childish things.
[8:27] Face to face. Now I know in
[8:32] part as also I am known. And now I
[8:37] faith, hope, charity. These three are
[8:41] the greatest. These is charity. Amen.
[8:45] Amen. God bless. You may be seated.
[8:56] Amen.
[9:00] You know, the Bible is
[9:03] a love letter to us and it's full of
[9:06] love. Sometimes there's those chapters
[9:09] you go to like 1 Corinthians 13 to kind
[9:12] of line things back up of what love is
[9:15] and we appreciate that about God is so
[9:17] mindful to know those things. Does
[9:20] anyone have a special song this morning?
[9:22] You know, sometimes we try to let people
[9:24] know, but if you have one on your heart,
[9:26] just let me know. And um but we'll
[9:28] continue singing and then we may uh ask
[9:31] a little later.
[9:33] Amen. Let's
[9:35] um let's sing that
[9:37] um let's sing that chorus in moments
[9:40] like these in the key of
[9:43] C. Oh, in

[11:00] [Music]

[11:04] moment like

[11:12] song. Yes, I sing
[11:14] out a love song to
[11:19] Jes. Oh, he loves you this morning. In
[11:23] moments like
[11:26] these, oh, I lift
[11:29] up my
[11:31] hands. I lift up my hands to you,
[11:39] Lord. I'm
[11:41] singing.

[12:08] you,
[12:10] Lord.
[12:12] I

[12:16] you." Hallelujah.
[12:19] Amen. So now for these next two songs, I
[12:22] want everybody to stand up. If you're
[12:24] not awake this morning, we're fing to
[12:26] get you awake. Amen.
[12:29] How many want to lift Jesus higher? We
[12:31] hadn't sung this song in a while. And
[12:33] there's some hand motions that go with
[12:35] it, too. So the hand motions is higher,

[19:05] had a good time yesterday. Thank all
[19:06] y'all for coming. Uh we we had a lot of
[19:09] people here. A lot of y'all weren't
[19:10] here, but uh we had a good time in the
[19:12] Lord. And uh we're going to have the
[19:14] next fellowship meeting at brother Tony
[19:16] Yuboas in June down at his place at Six
[19:19] Flags. And um today uh well, let's next
[19:24] Sunday. Uh, the reason we're going to
[19:26] change up and not go down to my house
[19:28] and shoot up my house, as brother Ryan
[19:30] said, we're going to have a baby
[19:33] dedication next Sunday, which will be
[19:37] uh, Brother Zach and Sister Anna's baby
[19:40] Emerson. And then we're going to have a
[19:42] baptism service. Amen.
[19:46] Sister Zoe Ureo.
[19:51] So, we're going to heat the pool up. So,
[19:53] if anybody else, if you've been waiting
[19:54] and waiting, you want to be baptized,
[19:57] that pool will be warm and ready to go.
[19:59] Won't matter what the temperature is
[20:00] outside, it'll be warm and ready to go.
[20:03] And we'll baptize you in the name of the
[20:04] Lord Jesus. It doesn't matter if the
[20:06] pool's not working. We'll find a way to
[20:09] do it. So, um, just remember that.
[20:11] That'll be next Sunday. Also, remember
[20:14] today we're going to afterwards the
[20:16] service we're going to go downstairs and
[20:17] eat. Uh, there should be enough for
[20:19] everybody. I know some of you brought
[20:21] stuff. That's okay. But the sisters were
[20:23] so gracious to make enough for us to eat
[20:26] yesterday and today and then we will
[20:29] make it to the park. Uh the address was
[20:32] up on the screen. If you need another
[20:34] address, um we'll give it to you. But
[20:37] it's down at the park where we're going
[20:39] to have the uh spring festival in April
[20:43] and it will be at
[20:46] 3:00. 3:00. Now there's some of you that
[20:48] signed up downstairs. If you have
[20:50] children, this is not
[20:53] playtime. Is everybody with me? Your
[20:56] kids are not going to run around. I'm
[20:58] telling you, you kids are not going to
[20:59] run around. I'll be the daddy cuz it's
[21:02] serious. But y'all wanted to I want us
[21:04] everybody to understand that we're doing
[21:06] this to help you for your protection and
[21:09] not hurt yourself if some something
[21:11] arises. But it's not for kids to run
[21:13] around and grab things. If you got a kid
[21:15] below 16 years old, you sit beside
[21:18] them. All right. You sit with them and
[21:22] you make sure you keep them under
[21:24] control. That's why also next Sunday
[21:26] we're not going to I talked to the
[21:28] instructor and when we go down to my
[21:30] house and shoot my house
[21:32] up. We're only going to take so many at
[21:35] a time because then that's going to be
[21:36] live ammunition. So, we can't have 30
[21:39] people running around. We're only going
[21:41] to take like 10 at a time or eight at a
[21:43] time. And then we'll do it every
[21:44] Saturday or Sunday until we get till we
[21:47] get finished. But that's the that's the
[21:50] part that's really
[21:52] um I'm telling you when that dad always
[21:55] told us he said when that bullet goes
[21:56] out of that barrel at 3500 to 4,000 ft
[22:00] per second it can't come back. That's
[22:02] right. That's right. Exactly. It goes to
[22:04] where it's pointed. Right. It don't go
[22:06] back. So we going to but we I don't
[22:10] we've handled them all of our life. Um
[22:13] if you're scared of them that's okay.
[22:16] That's all right. But this is just
[22:17] voluntary. If you don't want to come,
[22:18] that's okay. But we're going to eat
[22:20] downstairs and then be at the park at
[22:22] 3:00, which means we'll need to leave
[22:23] here at least by 2ish 2:30 to get down
[22:27] there in time. All right. Is everybody
[22:28] all minds clear? Ready to hear the word
[22:31] of God? Brother Joel did a wonderful job
[22:33] yesterday and we are expecting another
[22:36] good sermon today and we're expecting
[22:39] the Lord to meet us here. All right. You
[22:42] brought a little piece of him with you,
[22:44] but we are now joined together. Amen.
[22:47] And we're going to stomp that devil all
[22:49] over. All over. You know, brother,
[22:52] brother Duck Scott made a statement one
[22:54] time. His dad died of cancer.
[22:57] And he said, "When we get there to that
[22:59] judgment part," he said, "I want to
[23:00] stomp that cancer devil myself."
[23:06] That's how much he hated that devil of
[23:08] cancer. And we don't we don't like
[23:10] devils.
[23:12] We like Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. because
[23:15] he's the number one theme of our life
[23:18] should be centered around. Yes. As as
[23:21] brother Bob was talking about in the
[23:22] different ones talking about um uh in
[23:24] your home being uh taking Christ not out
[23:29] of the home but take him out of the home
[23:31] with you and come to church but you got
[23:32] to take him right back down to to the
[23:34] house. And that's where you live where
[23:35] the rubber meets the road as they always
[23:36] say. And that's where the that's where
[23:39] the real witnessing is. So God bless you
[23:42] again. Love you. downstairs. We'll eat
[23:44] and then we'll take off at 3:00 down
[23:46] there at City Park. So, let's sing word
[23:49] of God ever true as brother Joel Brown
[23:50] comes from brother Donnie Reagan's
[23:52] church up in Johnson City and bring a
[23:54] message to
[23:55] us. Holy
[23:58] words long
[24:01] reserved for our
[24:03] wall in this
[24:06] world. They
[24:08] resound with God's own heart. Oh, let
[24:12] the word of God
[24:16] impart. Words of
[24:18] life, words of hope. It gives us
[24:23] strength and helps us
[24:25] home in this world. Wherever we roll,
[24:30] what's going to happen? The word of God
[24:32] will guide us home.

[25:59] in order that his people can become who

[26:11] Amen.
[26:13] Hallelujah.
[26:16] My goodness, God is good to us, saints.
[26:18] You may be seated just a moment. Just uh
[26:24] you just don't understand the the
[26:26] position a a minister gets into
[26:28] sometimes. I just and if such as myself,
[26:31] I I'll just say this in humility and
[26:33] it's just who I am, but I don't consider
[26:35] myself a singer. I'm just somebody who
[26:37] sings and and when it comes time to
[26:40] sing, all these songs just float through
[26:42] my head and I'm trying to catch one as
[26:43] they come and then I forget the words
[26:45] and all that. But um just want to say I
[26:48] love you in the Lord and it's good to be
[26:50] here. Good to to have the invitation to
[26:52] come and to speak the words of life that
[26:55] we were just um um uh singing about. And
[26:58] I am nothing within myself but simply
[27:00] who I am. Yes. And I pray that uh words
[27:03] can be spoken today that would be an
[27:05] encouragement to you. Thanks to brother
[27:06] Dale for the invitation to come and the
[27:09] the um the first lady of not only the
[27:12] church but of

[27:23] into it, I'm sure.

[27:30] Amen. God's glory. Amen. But it truly is
[27:34] good to be here and I once again give
[27:35] you greetings from brother Donnie and

[27:53] weekend is her time to prepare for the
[27:54] following week and and I'll be out of
[27:57] town. We'll be traveling uh next week to
[27:59] South Carolina. Sister June has already
[28:01] told me that their time, your all's time

[28:12] And it's I will say this, too. It's an
[28:14] honor to have two of my sons with me as
[28:16] well, traveling with me. That truly has
[28:18] always been a dream of mine. and just to
[28:20] to to have my children to come with me
[28:22] when they got old enough to take care of
[28:24] themselves and I wouldn't have to worry
[28:26] well you wouldn't have to worry about
[28:27] them you know while they're while I'm
[28:29] not around and and mom there to corral
[28:32] them or something but they're they're
[28:33] and my oldest one uh stayed back he just
[28:36] started school and he's busy and trying

[32:43] name,

[32:51] praise. Worthy is your name.
[32:57] Amen. He's worthy. Amen. He's worthy. If
[33:00] you have your Bibles, I want to read
[33:02] from uh three scriptures. I want to read
[33:05] from First Corinthians. I thought my
[33:07] brother was going to take my text this
[33:08] morning uh there a moment ago, but uh
[33:11] even if he had, it would have been
[33:13] great. Um 1
[33:16] Corinthians, it's not up.
[33:20] Gotcha. Okay. Great. Thank you. It's
[33:22] good. Okay. 1 Corinthians 10, then James
[33:26] 1, and then Psalms 107. So 1 Corinthians
[33:32] 10 verse
[33:35] 13, there hath no temptation taken you,
[33:39] but such as is common to man.
[33:43] But God is faithful. Who will not suffer
[33:47] you to be tempted above that ye are
[33:49] able, but will with the temptation,
[33:52] watch, watch the mercy, the grace, the
[33:55] providence, the love, the tenderness of
[33:57] God, but will with the
[33:59] temptation make also a way to escape
[34:04] that we may be able to bear it. Amen.
[34:06] Let's read that again. There hath no
[34:08] temptation taken you, but such as is
[34:11] common to man. But God is faithful, who
[34:13] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[34:15] that ye are able, but will with the
[34:17] temptation also make a way to escape,
[34:20] that ye may be able to bear it. James 1
[34:25] verse 12. James 1 verse
[34:28] 12. Blessed is the man that endureth
[34:31] temptation.
[34:34] So you going to be tried.
[34:36] You will be tempted. Amen. Tempted by
[34:40] what? I have no clue. That's right. But
[34:42] the Bible says in all points.
[34:45] For when he is tried, he shall receive
[34:48] the crown of life, a gift from God
[34:51] during the time of temptation. That's a
[34:53] mighty tender thing. Amen. Which the
[34:56] Lord hath promised to them that love
[34:58] him. James 1:21. Wherefore lay apart all
[35:01] filthiness and superfluity of
[35:04] naughtiness, and receive with meekness
[35:06] the engrafted word which is able to save
[35:09] your
[35:10] souls. Psalms 107 verse 19 and
[35:15] 20. Then they cry unto the Lord in their
[35:18] trouble, and he saveth them out of their
[35:21] distresses. Wow.
[35:24] He sent his word and healed them and
[35:27] delivered them from their destructions.
[35:31] My goodness. Praise the Lord. Let's bow
[35:34] our heads. Heavenly Father, we truly
[35:38] count it an honor to be able to stand
[35:40] before your purchased ones today. And
[35:44] we know that they here at Spoken Word
[35:46] Tabernacle, the spoken word church here,
[35:49] they're not the only ones, but they're a
[35:52] part of a many membered body that's
[35:54] scattered, littered around the entire
[35:56] world.
[35:57] And all of us together, Father, we're
[35:59] longing for your return. And until that
[36:02] time, we gather in places like this. We
[36:05] come to houses of worship. We come to
[36:07] these tabernacles, these churches, these
[36:10] these places of worship where we can, as
[36:13] I was saying just last night, to bring
[36:15] our licks of fire. And Lord, our fire is
[36:19] still burning when we're out in the
[36:20] world. But it seemingly, Lord, it's a
[36:23] little more of a test, Lord, to to to to
[36:26] refuel at times because, as we were just
[36:29] saying, we're we're tempted and we we're
[36:31] distressed and but Lord, we still have
[36:33] that fire, but you've given us a place
[36:36] that we can come and assemble together
[36:39] to gain strength to even let off the
[36:41] pressures the prophet has told us. And
[36:43] so Lord, we want to do that today that
[36:45] that you've already initiated or
[36:48] orchestrated or purposed for us to do.
[36:51] If there would be some here today,
[36:53] someone Lord that's longing for more of
[36:55] you. Maybe someone that doesn't know you
[36:57] in that free pardon of sin. I pray that
[37:00] you would just find a place on the pew
[37:02] beside them and just settle up close to
[37:04] them and just gently let your presence,
[37:07] oh God, envelop them. Oh God, may you
[37:09] fill this room today by your presence.
[37:12] We love you. We honor you. We adore you.
[37:14] And it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[37:17] Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. And
[37:20] I want to be conscious of your time
[37:22] today. Um I know you all have some
[37:25] things to do and I've got a few miles to
[37:27] get behind me to get back home and got
[37:30] to get up early for work in the morning
[37:31] about 4:30 or so, you know. So, um but
[37:35] here we have no continuing city, but
[37:38] we're seeking one to come.
[37:39] I I want to just um take your thoughts
[37:42] and and if I can just borrow in the time
[37:44] that I have of yours to just a little
[37:46] thought the Lord dropped in my heart
[37:48] some time ago. The great escape.
[37:52] The great escape. We were just talking
[37:53] about how there's uh times of uh
[37:56] distress and temptations and and and
[37:58] things that are upon us
[38:01] and and many times when we get in a
[38:04] tight when we get in a situation we
[38:06] think there's no way I can get out of
[38:07] this. That's right.
[38:09] you know, and we think, "What am I going
[38:12] to do?" But the Bible has promised us
[38:14] that when we are tempted, there there
[38:16] isn't a temptation that you haven't ex
[38:20] that you're not experiencing, that
[38:21] someone else hasn't experienced before.
[38:23] But in that time, the Bible's promised
[38:25] us that he would make a way for us to
[38:27] escape. Now, the thing is, we have to
[38:29] have a desire to get out of that
[38:31] situation. Amen. We can stay where we
[38:34] are and and be comfortable where we are
[38:35] or even fight what we're fighting. But
[38:37] the Bible, the word of God has promised
[38:39] us that he would give us a way of escape
[38:41] even in those times that we have created
[38:44] something that's caused distress and
[38:47] chaos and and craziness in our life. And
[38:50] as brother Juel for so often says, we
[38:53] get the wy wowy woos and it ain't no
[38:56] one's fault but yours.
[38:58] You're the one to blame. You can't blame
[38:59] it on mama. Can't blame it on the
[39:01] pastor. It's your fault. But but but the
[39:05] Bible says that there will be a way of
[39:08] escape.
[39:10] And James 1:21, I I love that word
[39:13] superfluity. I'm a word guy. I like
[39:16] words. I majored in English in college.
[39:19] And I will say this while I mention
[39:21] that, my school loans have been paid
[39:23] off. So I feel no more justification to
[39:25] try to justify my degree. You know, I
[39:27] work at a factory. I'm an old factory
[39:29] worker, you know. Uh but I I did have a
[39:31] desire to to go into education and and
[39:33] to to get into administration and all
[39:35] that. But my my my my course shifted
[39:37] when I met Jesus Christ. I was in
[39:39] college at the time when I met the Lord.
[39:41] I was up in Virginia. In fact, brother
[39:43] Homer Frasier uh there, Brother Ronh
[39:46] Spencer's father-in-law, I was the the
[39:48] college was there in the nearby town and
[39:49] and that's where I was in church. Well,
[39:51] of course, I grew up in church with uh
[39:53] some of the old-timers may remember
[39:55] brother Kyle Kzer, Brother Sam Kzer.
[39:57] That's where I grew up in in a place
[39:59] called Gayax and in the Blue Ridge
[40:00] Mountains of Virginia. Uh but when I was
[40:03] about 12 years old, I got a little
[40:04] knuckle in my neck and I didn't want to
[40:06] go to church anymore, you know, and and
[40:08] just, you know, and and you know, just
[40:10] just going through life, just my
[40:12] testimony, a little bit of my testimony,
[40:14] but when I was in college and and to me,
[40:17] it's probably one of the most trying and
[40:20] worsted places to give your life to the
[40:22] Lord at. That's right. Amen. Because
[40:23] you're in an environment, I'm going be
[40:25] talking about environments in a moment,
[40:26] but you you're in an environment where
[40:28] the mom and daddy's not there. You're
[40:30] free to do whatever you want to do, but
[40:32] the Lord got a hold of me first. Amen.
[40:35] In my pack of friends, the fellas as
[40:36] we're known. And and we we're still
[40:38] tight. That's been 30 years ago now. And
[40:40] and we're we're still, you know,
[40:42] friends, but I was the oldest of the
[40:44] crew. And and and so I it was in um uh
[40:48] January before my my 21st birthday. So,
[40:52] I was the the one getting ready to
[40:53] approach that magical hour. Now, y'all
[40:55] look at here me. Look at me like you
[40:56] cute if you want to, but I was turning
[40:58] 21 and I was ahead of the pack. So, I
[41:02] was going to be able to They were
[41:03] saying, "Go, Joel. Go get there. Hurry
[41:06] up." But God got to me in January. My
[41:09] birthday is in April. God to me in
[41:12] January before it. He stopped that
[41:13] development. And I say, "Praise God."
[41:16] Praise the Lord. Cuz who knows where
[41:19] where would I be? what what what would I
[41:22] you know and and and so I I praise God
[41:24] for that for that very thing but but I
[41:26] like words but that word superfluity I'm
[41:29] not sure if you've uh looked at it
[41:30] looked at it before to to understand
[41:32] what the meaning would be but it simply
[41:34] means wherefore lay apart all filthiness
[41:37] and superfluity of naughtiness and
[41:40] receive with meekness the engrafted word
[41:43] so it it it it's always amazing to me
[41:45] that the the the the image that people
[41:48] when they give their life to the Lord
[41:50] and they become come Christians the
[41:51] image that they they or the the uh again
[41:54] I'm a word person I'm always trying to
[41:56] grasp words but the the the position
[41:58] they try to project and and what they
[42:00] want to portray to people that that
[42:02] they're fancy and they're wonderful and
[42:04] they're above sin bless
[42:07] but the Bible right here says filthiness
[42:10] and
[42:11] superfluity that word superfluity means
[42:14] residue the remains listen the
[42:17] wickedness remaining over in a
[42:20] Christian from his state prior to
[42:24] conversion.
[42:25] So, there's some stuff that's still
[42:27] hanging on even when you become a
[42:30] Christian. And there are things that
[42:31] continue to dangle on your life, you
[42:34] cute folk, you don't want to admit it,
[42:36] but it's there. Until this thing is
[42:39] changed, we're going to have trouble.
[42:42] Huh?
[42:45] Until this thing is changed, we're going
[42:46] to have trouble. But the Bible says we
[42:49] have been made away and given away to
[42:52] escape. But the wickedness remaining
[42:54] over in a Christian from his prior state
[42:57] to conversion.
[42:59] But my thought again was the great
[43:03] escape. So we find within the message uh
[43:07] the invasion of the USA, the prophet
[43:09] places it this way. He says whatever an
[43:11] environment you live in, that's what you
[43:13] are. Yes.
[43:16] Now the spirit of an environment is what
[43:19] attaches itself and captivates our
[43:22] attention, right? The spirit of an
[43:24] environment, you know, and and we may be
[43:27] um uh uh just maybe like it was with
[43:29] Lot, you know, the environment that he
[43:31] was in, the Bible says it vexed his
[43:33] righteous soul. It vexed him daily. And
[43:36] I often wondered why in the world he
[43:38] stayed there.
[43:40] It vexed him daily. The Bible says in in
[43:42] 2 Peter uh 2 and8 it says that and for
[43:46] that righteous man dwelling among them
[43:48] in in in seeing and hearing vexed his
[43:52] righteous soul from day to day with
[43:54] their unlawful deeds. So day in and day
[43:57] out he was vexed by the things his
[43:59] environment.
[44:01] Why didn't he just leave? He got
[44:03] comfortable with his job. Yeah. Come on.
[44:06] He didn't want to go where God was
[44:07] leading him to go. Huh? I'm comfortable
[44:09] here, Lord. I don't want to move from
[44:10] Lula.
[44:12] I want to stay in Georgia. I don't want
[44:14] to go.
[44:16] The Lord knoweth how to deliver the
[44:18] godly out of temptations.
[44:20] That's what Peter goes on to say. But
[44:22] it's the the it's the spirit of an
[44:24] environment that captivates the
[44:26] individual. Now, the thing is in order
[44:29] for for you, for me, for a person to be
[44:31] affected by the environment that we are
[44:34] in, and I'm just building a foundation,
[44:35] and I promise I won't be long. I'm just
[44:37] going to just try to encourage you here
[44:38] today. They must come under the
[44:40] influence of a spirit that they they
[44:43] they have to come you and I have to come
[44:45] under a spirit of that environment that
[44:48] influence that gives life to that
[44:51] particular environment. Right? And you
[44:54] know we we know the prophet talked about
[44:55] different countries have different
[44:57] spirits and and different different uh
[44:58] nations have different spirits.
[45:00] Different churches have different
[45:01] spirits. Homes have different spirits.
[45:03] You as an individual have a different
[45:04] spirit. Right? Mhm. And that that makes
[45:07] you particular, right? So the the the
[45:10] prophet said everything is governed by a
[45:12] spirit.
[45:14] So in in the message what the Holy Ghost
[45:16] was given for each person sitting here
[45:18] is filled with something. You're filled
[45:21] with something. You can't sit there
[45:23] without being full of something. Full
[45:26] full of something. You've got a life in
[45:30] you. That life governs you. And that
[45:33] life is governed by a spirit. Yeah.
[45:35] Right. Amen. A spirit. Now before
[45:38] destruction could come to the
[45:40] antid-dolivian world, the antidolivian
[45:42] world had to be in the spirit of
[45:44] destruction. Amen. Before war can come,
[45:47] there has to be a spirit of war. Huh?
[45:50] Before Christ will come, there has to be
[45:53] the spirit of Christ. So if you want the
[45:56] word, if you want the fullness, if you
[45:58] want God to come to you, you have to get
[46:00] in the spirit of God. Amen.
[46:03] Now, a person may hate and and despise
[46:07] the very environment that they're in.
[46:11] But the spirit of that environment is
[46:13] what attaches itself to that person.
[46:16] Amen. Because you could be in a
[46:18] situation right now and hate it. But if
[46:20] you camp out too long, you're going to
[46:22] find yourself you becoming uh the
[46:24] embodiment
[46:26] the necess the necess the the necessary
[46:30] thing that that spirit needs to function
[46:32] in that environment. You understand what
[46:35] I'm saying? If if if you camp out long
[46:37] enough like we was talking about Brand
[46:39] Brother Brandham called her the dance
[46:40] queen, Nelly Sanders and and she found
[46:42] herself out on the dance floor in the
[46:44] arms of that man but she'd given her
[46:45] life to the Lord. What happened? She
[46:47] stayed in that environment too long and
[46:50] she become captivated by the anointing
[46:52] that was in that environment
[46:55] because we're in this world but we're
[46:57] not of this world.
[47:01] It influences their course of life. That
[47:03] spirit and whether or not that person
[47:06] stays. Whether or not you or me stay on
[47:08] that course will depend upon if we
[47:11] encounter another environment more
[47:14] powerful than the one currently holding
[47:17] us captive. Amen.
[47:20] That word environment means the
[47:22] circumstances, the objects or conditions
[47:24] by which one is surrounded. What are you
[47:28] surrounded by today?
[47:30] What's giving you uncction? What's
[47:33] influencing you?
[47:35] I pray it's the spirit of God.
[47:38] So when we read I I I just want to just
[47:40] for a moment when we read in the
[47:42] scriptures just think about this that
[47:43] that I think that it's important for us
[47:46] to to to look at the context in which
[47:50] the scene is set in that particular
[47:52] scripture. And then when we when we see
[47:55] that scene and and look at that context,
[47:57] we are able to draw a parallel to our
[48:00] own life. Right. Right. That's that's
[48:03] how we can able to take and read this
[48:05] word and put oursel in the word because
[48:08] we see the context of what's going on.
[48:09] And what do we do? We we we I want to
[48:11] encourage you to do that. Just put
[48:13] yourself in the context of that
[48:15] scripture and run that parallel
[48:19] as a body of believers. I think that's
[48:21] essential. And with this this context,
[48:24] many times we find that we we we come to
[48:27] call or find rather our quote favorite
[48:30] scripture. Yeah, that's my favorite
[48:32] scripture. What have you done? You put
[48:34] yourself within the context of that
[48:36] particular scripture, right? And that
[48:38] scripture might be something that will
[48:40] give you encouragement when you when
[48:41] you're down and weary. Or it might bring
[48:44] inspiration to you to get you through a
[48:46] difficult situation and give you
[48:48] courage. Or it might be a scripture that
[48:51] will cause to you to remember who you
[48:53] were before you became who you are now.
[48:58] Right? Good. Galatians 2:18 says, "For
[49:01] if I build again the things which I
[49:03] destroyed, I make myself a
[49:05] transgressor." So something that you
[49:08] through the power of God, the anointing
[49:10] drops down on you and you take that word
[49:12] and you say, "Amen." And immediately
[49:15] that thing that was holding you captive
[49:17] was gone, was obliterated. But the Bible
[49:19] says, "If I build again, the thing which
[49:23] I destroyed," right? Huh? You can't
[49:26] point your finger at God and say, "God,
[49:28] you did this." No, you built it back up.
[49:31] You let that little lady back in your
[49:33] life. You let that little wiggly guy
[49:35] come back in your life, have that
[49:36] influence on you. Hear me? Amen. Huh?
[49:39] Amen. Amen. Right. It's just a gentle
[49:43] reminder that this old flesh cannot be
[49:45] trusted.
[49:46] So, with this contextual perspective in
[49:49] mind, I want us to use, if I can, the
[49:52] story of the children of Israel for a
[49:54] moment. Amen.
[49:56] the nation of Israel, God's people. They
[49:58] were chosen among all the people upon
[50:01] the face of the earth. They had become
[50:04] sold into bondage in the land of Egypt.
[50:06] Amen. God's people
[50:09] in that condition. Sold into
[50:13] bondage. So they couldn't help being
[50:16] there because the predestinated plan of
[50:19] God had sent them there. The tender hand
[50:21] of Jehovah. Amen.
[50:24] The ways of God can never fully be
[50:25] understood. That's why we just simply
[50:28] say yes sir and amen. Amen. Simply take
[50:31] God at his word and just go on because
[50:33] sometimes we we we're not called to
[50:35] understand it. Quite frankly, I don't
[50:37] want to fulfill every this all of this
[50:39] word is not for me. That's right.
[50:42] All of it's not for me. I don't want to
[50:44] fulfill everything in here. But guess
[50:45] what? Everything that I am supposed to
[50:48] that's exactly what I want to do.
[50:50] I want to find everything in this word
[50:52] that's that I'm called to fulfill and I
[50:54] want to live under that uncction and
[50:56] under that purpose
[50:58] because God told Abram Abram that they
[51:00] would sojourn in a strange land for 400
[51:04] years
[51:06] in an environment. The words were spoken
[51:09] time marched on and the word became
[51:11] manifest and we find God's people
[51:14] enslaved. Watch this. In the message
[51:16] Jehovah Gyra in in in 1962, if the
[51:20] Egyptian men wanted to ravage the young
[51:22] Hebrew girls, nothing could be said. If
[51:25] they wanted to kill the young men, they
[51:27] killed them. Nothing could be said. They
[51:29] were slaves.
[51:31] They throw them out by their out their
[51:34] moldy bread and they eat it or do
[51:36] without. Complain, killed. What a place
[51:40] for the people of God. Amen. What a
[51:43] place, brother Wayade, that many times
[51:45] Christians, believers, followers of this
[51:48] message, what a place they get
[51:50] themselves into, being led around by the
[51:53] devil. Amen.
[51:55] Amen. Where he says go, you go. What he
[51:59] says do, you do. That's right. And still
[52:01] the identity of a Christian, of a
[52:04] believer,
[52:05] right? Still being led because why? They
[52:08] are under the influence of an
[52:09] environment of a spirit that's over that
[52:12] particular environment. So we find God's
[52:15] people in this environment called Egypt.
[52:18] Egypt sights, Egypt sounds, Egypt food,
[52:24] Egypt customs, Egypt music, Egypt
[52:27] fashions. Leona, here we are.
[52:31] Huh?
[52:33] It's not so much that you like your name
[52:35] brand stuff. There's a spirit behind
[52:37] that thing. Amen. Come on, brother. I
[52:40] challenge you. Whatever you like,
[52:42] whatever your brand is, whatever it may
[52:44] be, search the history on it. Find out
[52:48] where it originated. Come on, brother.
[52:49] And then if you can still wear it, I
[52:51] would question your walk. Come on,
[52:53] brother. You said, "Brother Jo, what we
[52:56] going to wear?" Find you something else
[52:57] to wear. Yeah. Huh?
[53:01] I know. I know. Y'all got to look cute
[53:03] and all that stuff. Yeah. get dressed up
[53:06] and looks look look fine and whatever
[53:09] the kids say today. I don't even know. I
[53:11] can't keep up with it.
[53:14] And they living in my house. I still
[53:16] can't keep up with it.
[53:19] So for 400 years, every every look and
[53:22] at every turn there was Egypt, right?
[53:24] Everywhere. Smells the smells of Egypt,
[53:26] the sights, the images, everything,
[53:28] everywhere. For 400 years, the devil was
[53:31] around. Amen. But God says, "I will make
[53:35] a way of escape."
[53:37] Remember, whatever an environment you
[53:39] live in, that's what you are. Amen.
[53:42] Whether you think that you're not, that
[53:44] whatever, that's what the prophet says.
[53:45] Whatever environment you're in, that's
[53:47] what you are. Amen.
[53:50] Romans 7:21 says, "I find in a law that
[53:53] when I would do good, what evil, evil is
[53:56] present." So, we're not going to we're
[53:59] not going to get away from evil until we
[54:01] get out of here. Amen. But you have to
[54:03] determine while we are here, this evil
[54:05] is not going to captivate me. This evil
[54:08] is not going to catch me. Amen. So Egypt
[54:12] in type is sin. So God's people had
[54:14] become sin. The environment that they
[54:17] were in caused them to be sin. But they
[54:21] could not stay in that condition. Amen.
[54:23] They couldn't remain under the in
[54:25] effects of this environment. So God came
[54:28] down to deliver his people from their
[54:30] what? from their sins. Amen. Amen.
[54:35] Exodus 3. And the Lord said, I have
[54:36] surely seen the affliction of my people
[54:38] which are in Egypt, and I've heard their
[54:40] cry by reason of their taskmasters, for
[54:43] I know their sorrows, and I am come down
[54:46] to deliver them out of the hand of the
[54:48] Egyptians, to deliver them out of the
[54:50] hand of the devil.
[54:53] God has come down today, this day, the
[54:55] 16th of March, I believe it is. God has
[54:57] come down to deliver you out of your
[55:00] condition. and whatever is holding you
[55:02] and preventing you from living the way
[55:04] you know that you're supposed to live
[55:06] the way that mom and dad has told you
[55:08] the the foundation that they have
[55:10] established in their home. God is
[55:12] calling you today. You can live that
[55:14] life.
[55:18] Amen. And I've come down to deliver them
[55:20] out of the hand of the Egyptians, to
[55:21] bring them up out of that land unto a
[55:24] good land and a large unto a land
[55:26] flowing milk and honey, unto the place
[55:27] of the Canaanites, and the Hittites and
[55:29] the Amorites and the Parizzites and the
[55:30] Hivites and the Jebusites. So God came
[55:33] down, but he sent a man. Yes, he did.
[55:38] Wow. Sent Moses.
[55:41] You said, "Well, Brother Joel, you just
[55:42] told me that that I can be delivered out
[55:45] of and God will take me out of the
[55:47] condition that I'm in." He has sent a
[55:49] man called Joel Brown. To let you know
[55:52] today that there is a way to get out of
[55:54] that condition that you're in. You don't
[55:56] have to live that way. You don't have to
[55:59] be under that bondage. Huh? Amen.
[56:04] You don't have to fall under the
[56:05] influence of that little girl. Why do I
[56:08] keep coming? My goodness. You don't have
[56:10] to fall under the influence of her.
[56:13] Amen.
[56:15] If you are not looking for character,
[56:17] I'm a great brother.
[56:20] Right. Amen. I know she may be a pretty
[56:23] little thing. Come on, brother. She
[56:26] might be. Yeah. And that's all well and
[56:28] good, but that beauty will fade.
[56:31] You better make sure that little girl
[56:33] has character.
[56:36] Young men, if you're here today and
[56:37] you're looking for a wife, I'm here to
[56:39] let you know you're not going to find
[56:40] Miss Perfect, Miss Queen, cuz I got her
[56:42] already.
[56:44] She's in my house.
[56:48] Yes, sir. I believe that. But get away
[56:52] from that thing.
[56:55] It's It's Oh, Lord. Brother Wade. I'm
[56:56] going to get in trouble. My goodness.
[56:58] It's appealing to the flesh. Yes. It
[57:00] Yes. But get away from it. It's going to
[57:02] take you straight to hell.
[57:06] Amen.
[57:08] So, God came down, but he sent a man,
[57:10] Moses. This was a precursor to the day
[57:12] when it would be fulfilled what had been
[57:14] told to Joseph. Matthew 1:21 says, "And
[57:17] she shall bring forth a son, and thou
[57:19] shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall
[57:21] save his people from their sins."
[57:25] So since the fall in the garden, man has
[57:27] been separated from God. Watch this in
[57:29] the message warnings. And I I'm going to
[57:31] be reading a lot of quotes today. Just I
[57:32] just want to kind of sort of just settle
[57:34] in and just just to encourage you a
[57:35] little bit to let you know that that
[57:36] that God is still mindful of where you
[57:39] are and he still loves you and he wants
[57:40] you back. He wants you in position. Now,
[57:43] when Adam and Eve listened to the lie of
[57:45] the devil, how many's listened to the
[57:47] lie of the devil before? I'm going to be
[57:49] quiet for a minute. How many listened to
[57:50] a lie of the devil before?
[57:53] It's a good place to take a drink of
[57:54] water. Come on, brother. I didn't even
[57:56] look at you because I don't want you. I
[57:58] just wanted to hear you. I didn't want
[57:59] to see you. Amen.
[58:01] When they listen to the lie of the
[58:03] devil, the holy image of God left them.
[58:09] So, what happens when we listen to the
[58:11] lies of the devil? That image of God,
[58:13] that holy image of God leaves us. Leaves
[58:17] me by the way it leaves you. Amen. It
[58:20] left the prophet of God. Amen. I can
[58:23] remember one time just now when I'm
[58:24] saying this, I remember one time I think
[58:26] it was was uh little Rebecca. She was
[58:28] sick and they were they were in the car
[58:29] going somewhere. I'm just trying to
[58:30] recall it from memory. But but she she
[58:32] was sick and she was throwing up and and
[58:34] he mentioned Pepto-Bismol. So maybe you
[58:35] can find I don't remember where it is,
[58:37] but just just search Pepto or something.
[58:39] I think he says it that way. but she's
[58:41] sick. And he he pulls the car off to to
[58:44] sure where she can uh get a little air
[58:45] and all that. And he walks off off off
[58:47] to the side of the road and he begins to
[58:49] pray and and he he talked about how the
[58:51] spirit of God just begin to come down on
[58:53] him and he says, "Oh, I wish I felt that
[58:55] all the time.
[58:58] All the time." So, contrary to what many
[59:01] would try to get you to believe, the
[59:03] prophet did not live under that
[59:04] anointing all the time. Right, brother.
[59:06] Amen. That's just tuck tuck that in your
[59:08] pocket and just use it for later. So
[59:11] their fellowship of oneness with God was
[59:13] broken. The very minute they listen to
[59:15] the lie of the devil, that broke their
[59:17] fellowship. Right. Right. And the very
[59:20] minute that you listen to the lie of the
[59:22] devil, it'll break your fellowship.
[59:24] That's the very minute that you go out
[59:27] from the presence of God like she did is
[59:29] when you fail to take God's word just as
[59:33] it is. Amen. So when God says tada tada
[59:37] tada, then what do we need to be saying?
[59:40] Tada tada tada but no no there is no but
[59:43] we to say tada tada. Let's get in the
[59:46] rhythm that God has already established.
[59:50] And just simply march to that. So sin
[59:52] separated them from God. This is just
[59:54] simple little thought. But and from that
[59:56] time from that time from when when Adam
[59:59] and Eve did what they did all of
[1:00:01] humanity has felt the pain of this
[1:00:04] separation. Amen. And has stumbled
[1:00:07] through as as Romans says the motions of
[1:00:10] sin. Romans 7 and5 says for when we were
[1:00:14] in the flesh this for when we were in
[1:00:17] the flesh the motions of sins. So while
[1:00:20] we're in this flesh there's going to be
[1:00:22] sin.
[1:00:26] While we're here, there's still going to
[1:00:27] be things that we're going to struggle
[1:00:29] with, brother.
[1:00:31] Which were by the law did work in our
[1:00:34] members to bring forth fruit unto death.
[1:00:37] Right? That's what the devil is after is
[1:00:40] to kill you, to take you down. Amen.
[1:00:44] Through the motions of sin. Sin means to
[1:00:47] simply miss the mark. Sin also means to
[1:00:51] wander from the path of uprightness and
[1:00:53] honor. to wander from the path of God.
[1:00:58] That's what sin means. You're walking on
[1:01:00] a straight and narrow path and you just
[1:01:01] begin to w I wonder what's over there.
[1:01:05] And God is calling us back straight
[1:01:07] ahead.
[1:01:08] So, it's time to get your senses about
[1:01:10] you today and get back on the path. Stop
[1:01:14] your wandering. Even stop your
[1:01:16] wondering. Come on, brother. Because
[1:01:19] it's leading us further into the grip of
[1:01:22] death. Amen. And when this happened, it
[1:01:24] started a war. But with that original
[1:01:27] thought, as he said, the holy image of
[1:01:29] God left them. But with that original
[1:01:31] thought, there's always something
[1:01:33] compelling them to do right. There's
[1:01:36] something on the end. You know as well
[1:01:38] as I do, there was something that's
[1:01:40] that's compelling you to you you to to
[1:01:42] to do what's right. I should not be
[1:01:45] doing this. I should not be looking at
[1:01:47] this. That's the spirit of God. Amen.
[1:01:51] Amen. H, brother. But this this is all
[1:01:54] we know, brother Wade, as far as
[1:01:56] knowing. Huh? This this this this this
[1:02:00] realm of time is all that we know. But
[1:02:02] we're being called. There's something on
[1:02:04] the inside of us telling us there's
[1:02:06] more. Amen. I think of the the the
[1:02:08] little story brother told about the
[1:02:10] little kite. I love to tell it, but he
[1:02:11] he came up on them the the little boy.
[1:02:13] The man came up on the little boy that
[1:02:14] was that was flying the kite. It was way
[1:02:16] off up in the sky beyond the clouds. He
[1:02:18] couldn't even see it. And he asked the
[1:02:19] little boy, "How do you know it's up
[1:02:21] there?" He says, "Every now and again, I
[1:02:23] feel a little tug.
[1:02:25] I feel a little something tugging and I
[1:02:27] know it's still up there. I know it's
[1:02:29] there." So something that little thing
[1:02:30] that's nudging you to do what's right.
[1:02:32] That's the spirit of God.
[1:02:36] Don't look at it the the the age that
[1:02:38] we're living in now will try to tell you
[1:02:39] that it's just coincidence or it's just
[1:02:41] science. And you know, the Bible says,
[1:02:43] "Search the scriptures. Search the
[1:02:46] scriptures. Don't search Google. That's
[1:02:48] right. Google's not your path to life.
[1:02:51] Wikipedia is not your path to life.
[1:02:55] Anybody can get on Wikipedia and make a
[1:02:57] statement.
[1:02:59] Huh? That's right. Started a war leading
[1:03:04] us back to that was right. So if there
[1:03:06] was a holy image of God that was a part
[1:03:08] of Adam and Eve, that image had to come
[1:03:11] from God. Yeah.
[1:03:14] And once that holy image left, then
[1:03:16] began the strain in all of humanity to
[1:03:19] begin trying to make the way back to
[1:03:21] that image. Eternal life. That's what
[1:03:24] I'm struggling. That's what I'm That's
[1:03:25] what I'm searching for. That's what I'm
[1:03:27] struggling to get to is eternal life.
[1:03:30] So we find ourselves even here in this
[1:03:32] day trapped in this horrible place
[1:03:35] surrounded by horrible conditions. Egypt
[1:03:37] everywhere we look. Leosa Leosa sites.
[1:03:40] Leodysian images. Leysian food. lay out
[1:03:43] of the sea and smells.
[1:03:45] All of these things are around us
[1:03:47] because of the environment that we're
[1:03:49] in. Horrible conditions.
[1:03:52] But the way back will not be without a
[1:03:55] fight. Amen. You will have to fight for
[1:03:58] every square inch. Amen. Every bit of
[1:04:01] territory that belongs to you as a
[1:04:03] believer, you going to have to fight for
[1:04:04] it.
[1:04:07] They became trapped. They were a
[1:04:09] prisoner. And once you realize who you
[1:04:11] are, nothing will stop you from trying
[1:04:13] to break free.
[1:04:16] Amen. Do you know who you are today?
[1:04:19] There should be nothing that will stand
[1:04:20] in your way. Sure, it's going to be
[1:04:21] tough. Sure, it's rough. Sure, you may
[1:04:23] face that thing again. But your
[1:04:25] objective, your goal, your
[1:04:27] determination. I've got to make it in.
[1:04:29] Amen.
[1:04:31] I've got to make it to heaven somehow.
[1:04:33] Yeah. Also, we see him revealed in Ruth
[1:04:36] and Boaz as a kinsman redeemer. How he
[1:04:39] had to come to be flesh. Who is this
[1:04:42] Melzdc? Now, we see the attribute sons
[1:04:45] of his spirit. I won't have time to
[1:04:47] really break into this, but this I just
[1:04:48] want to read it just to just to
[1:04:49] encourage you today. That's why I'm
[1:04:51] here. What I want to do today. We see
[1:04:52] the attribute sons of the spirit have
[1:04:54] not yet entered into the word form body,
[1:04:57] but a theophony. Yeah, the body is
[1:05:00] subject to the word and earnestly is
[1:05:03] waiting for the earnest change of the
[1:05:05] body. Now the difference between him and
[1:05:08] you as a son. See, he was at the
[1:05:11] beginning the word. He was at the
[1:05:13] beginning a word. That's the difference,
[1:05:14] the main difference between us and him.
[1:05:16] He was at the beginning of the word. And
[1:05:18] in more faith today, he came in and
[1:05:20] lived in that person of Melzdc. He said,
[1:05:23] "I want to go see how my children are
[1:05:26] doing." Amen. He just creates a body and
[1:05:28] steps into that body and comes into
[1:05:30] time.
[1:05:32] You can look upon him. We we saw him. We
[1:05:34] heard what he said when he was there
[1:05:35] with Abraham. Then later we never heard
[1:05:37] no more of Melzdc because he became
[1:05:39] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:05:42] Melazdc was the priest but he became
[1:05:44] Jesus Christ. Now you bypass that. Yes,
[1:05:48] sir. We bypass that
[1:05:51] h my because in that form he knowed all
[1:05:55] things and you have never been able to
[1:05:57] know that yet. You come like Adam like
[1:05:59] me. You became from you came from the
[1:06:01] attribute to the flesh to be tempted.
[1:06:04] Amen brother.
[1:06:06] So these temptations that that's not
[1:06:08] uncommon. You came here to be tempted,
[1:06:10] to show to the world, those around you,
[1:06:13] the environment that you're in, the
[1:06:14] people that are in that environment with
[1:06:16] you, that you can and that not only you,
[1:06:18] but they also, if they get the spirit of
[1:06:21] Christ in them, can overcome these
[1:06:23] temptations. Amen. But when this life is
[1:06:26] finished here, if this earthly
[1:06:27] tabernacle be dissolved, we have one
[1:06:29] already waiting. That's where we go.
[1:06:32] That is the word. That's why this word
[1:06:35] is so important because this is what we
[1:06:37] are becoming. This is what we're coming
[1:06:39] back to. Amen. This revelation and the
[1:06:43] prophet says revelation can never to a
[1:06:45] true believer, revelation can never be
[1:06:48] overemphasized. So we have to have
[1:06:51] revelation. Not just reading a dead
[1:06:53] letter, but have revelation. If you
[1:06:55] don't understand it, God, help me to
[1:06:57] understand this because there's
[1:06:58] something in here that's telling me that
[1:07:00] I have an identity in this book.
[1:07:05] Amen.
[1:07:07] And I want to take on that image fully
[1:07:09] because I have a hell to fight.
[1:07:13] I have a God to glorify.
[1:07:16] I have a devil to look at in the face
[1:07:18] and says, "No, not today." Amen.
[1:07:23] My my my You think it was fun being on a
[1:07:28] college campus?
[1:07:30] Come on, brother.
[1:07:32] Come on. All those pretty Come on now.
[1:07:34] All those pretty little
[1:07:36] girls. But guess what? I had a big word
[1:07:39] that I like to use and it was called N
[1:07:41] O.
[1:07:44] How'd you like that? You thought I was
[1:07:45] going to say something profound, didn't
[1:07:47] you? It's just that simple. No. Right.
[1:07:51] Even I wrote a little song one time.
[1:07:52] People just nosy. Why don't you wear
[1:07:54] shorts? Why don't you do this?
[1:07:58] But it goes just people ask me when I
[1:08:00] when I uh let's see if I can pick it up.
[1:08:02] My goodness. I I may come up to it
[1:08:04] later, but but um just I've got God in
[1:08:06] my life and I got to let him show.
[1:08:09] That's why I don't let my legs show.
[1:08:14] People ask me when the summer rolls
[1:08:15] around, why don't you let your legs
[1:08:17] show? My goodness. But you it it it it
[1:08:20] was a it was a test. It was a trying
[1:08:22] time as a young man. The verility of
[1:08:25] life of youth. Huh? And the society, the
[1:08:29] world, the age of saying, "Sow your
[1:08:31] oats."
[1:08:33] Huh? You don't have any oats to sew.
[1:08:37] You're supposed to be sewing word. Word
[1:08:39] word.
[1:08:40] [Music]
[1:08:42] Because guess what? If you're sewing
[1:08:44] your oats, guess what's going to come
[1:08:46] up? Your crop that you planted. That's
[1:08:47] right. That's right. And then you going
[1:08:49] to be wanting the preacher lands on me.
[1:08:51] I did this. I You shouldn't have did it
[1:08:53] from the day forth. You should stop.
[1:08:57] Amen.
[1:08:59] Tuck it in your pocket. Take it for
[1:09:00] later. I tell my boys all the time, this
[1:09:02] is not so much for the here, but later.
[1:09:06] Hear me now, believe me later.
[1:09:09] Then we can look back and see what we
[1:09:11] done. I got to hurry now. We don't
[1:09:12] understand it. We have never become the
[1:09:14] word. We've just become the flesh man,
[1:09:17] not the word. And look clearly makes it
[1:09:19] clear. You will never be the word unless
[1:09:22] you was a thought at the beginning. That
[1:09:25] proves the predestination of God. See,
[1:09:28] you can't be the word unless you're a
[1:09:30] thought. Amen.
[1:09:32] Amen. You take it up with the prophet.
[1:09:34] I'm just reading what he said. You had
[1:09:36] to be in the thinking first. But you
[1:09:38] see, in order to stand temptation, you
[1:09:41] had to bypass the theophony.
[1:09:44] Right. H sure if I was in my theophony I
[1:09:47] wouldn't mind battling the devil. Yeah.
[1:09:49] I would man I wouldn't mind walking
[1:09:51] through Leosa.
[1:09:53] But here I bypass my theophony in order
[1:09:55] that I can stand. Amen. Amen. That I can
[1:10:00] stand in that life that God has called
[1:10:02] me into. You had to come down here in
[1:10:05] flesh to be tempted by sin. All the
[1:10:09] father given me will come to me and I'll
[1:10:11] raise them up at the last day. See, you
[1:10:12] had to be first. And then you see he
[1:10:15] come right down the regular line from
[1:10:17] attribute to before the foundation of
[1:10:19] the world. His name's put on the lamb's
[1:10:21] book of life. Then from that he became
[1:10:23] the word the theophony that could appear
[1:10:25] disappear and then he become flesh and
[1:10:27] return back again. I wish I had more
[1:10:28] time to break. Maybe brother way you can
[1:10:29] pick it up later. But resurrected the
[1:10:31] same body in a glorified condition. But
[1:10:33] you bypass the theophony and become
[1:10:35] flesh man to be tempted by sin. Amen.
[1:10:38] That's why you're here. Don't so much
[1:10:40] struggle God. Why are you letting me go
[1:10:43] through this? Because he wants you to
[1:10:45] see that in your flesh, in your body,
[1:10:47] you can, as he did, stand and look at
[1:10:50] that thing and overcome it.
[1:10:54] I'm talking about the simplicity of this
[1:10:56] gospel. I'm talking about the power of
[1:10:58] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:11:02] I wonder what the church next door is
[1:11:04] preaching about today.
[1:11:06] I wonder what the other churches around
[1:11:08] here are preaching about. They're
[1:11:09] probably getting prepared for Easter.
[1:11:11] Talking about how they're going to
[1:11:11] decorate and do all of these things.
[1:11:14] Go on, have your way, Cain. But look,
[1:11:18] when this body receives the spirit of
[1:11:19] God, this body receives the spirit of
[1:11:22] God. The immortal life inside of you, it
[1:11:26] throws this body in subjection to God.
[1:11:29] Amen. That's why it's so important to
[1:11:31] receive the spirit of God because this
[1:11:33] body will receive the the the spirit of
[1:11:36] God. And this immortal body possessing
[1:11:39] deity will be able to take that body and
[1:11:42] throw it into subjection to God. You
[1:11:45] said, "And you can't. You there's no way
[1:11:47] that you can." Yes, you're right. I
[1:11:49] can't live this life. You are exactly
[1:11:50] right. But the spirit that's in you,
[1:11:53] that immortal part that's in you, that
[1:11:56] is what can live this life. Amen. We are
[1:11:58] not in the word in its full form which
[1:12:02] is what we long for. Only death will
[1:12:04] bring us to that. We are on our way
[1:12:07] because we are becoming the word. Amen.
[1:12:13] And how are words
[1:12:14] built? One letter at a time.
[1:12:18] Y'all learn that putting the letters
[1:12:20] together. Amen. Think about it. When a
[1:12:22] when when a little child is learning to
[1:12:24] read, the anticipation of mom and dad
[1:12:26] and and and they'll be like, "Yeah,
[1:12:28] sound it out. Ah, say they're so excited
[1:12:32] because my baby's learning to talk." If
[1:12:35] we could just we could just view God
[1:12:37] today. Maybe somebody here is picking
[1:12:39] this up and he said, "Yes, you you're
[1:12:41] you're getting it. You're getting it.
[1:12:42] Come on. Come up but ju Jesus."
[1:12:46] Get all these words out. because he's
[1:12:48] wanting to hear the and see the evidence
[1:12:50] of what he's put inside of you. He knows
[1:12:54] it's in you. The power to live right is
[1:12:56] in you. And God himself knows it. You
[1:12:58] may not know it,
[1:13:00] but God himself knows it. Why? Because
[1:13:03] he put that life in you. Amen.
[1:13:07] The great
[1:13:09] escape, a resurrection only comes after
[1:13:12] there has been a death. You have to die
[1:13:15] out to who you think you are.
[1:13:18] who you are has to die. We talk about a
[1:13:20] resurrection. The only way a
[1:13:22] resurrection can take place is if there
[1:13:24] is a death. That's the only way.
[1:13:27] And the more we bring this body subject
[1:13:29] to the word, the closer we are coming to
[1:13:31] the fullness of the word. Amen. Being
[1:13:34] expressed in us, the word being
[1:13:36] expressed in us, through us, around us,
[1:13:38] because of us.
[1:13:42] Only then can we proclaim it is already
[1:13:44] started. The resurrection has already
[1:13:46] begun. Brother, the resurrection has
[1:13:48] already begun in you, sis. Why? Because
[1:13:50] you are proclaiming it with evidence
[1:13:54] following invisible union of the bride.
[1:13:56] How did you come to do this? You were
[1:13:58] deceived into it by your first marriage
[1:14:01] to your adulterous parent, Eve. It's no
[1:14:04] fault of your own. By your natural
[1:14:05] birth, you come after Eve who committed
[1:14:07] adultery. That's the reason you was born
[1:14:09] an adulteress. You were a sinner to
[1:14:11] begin with. Bless God, brother Joel. You
[1:14:14] don't know.
[1:14:16] my experience with the Lord. You come by
[1:14:18] way of Eve.
[1:14:21] See, you one of those cute folk. I just
[1:14:23] love
[1:14:27] He says, "No, it ain't your fault. You
[1:14:29] never did it." Because listen to this. I
[1:14:31] love This is one of my favorite quotes.
[1:14:32] And there's so many, but this is one of
[1:14:34] them. That little germ that was in you,
[1:14:37] listen, that little germ that was in you
[1:14:40] was to be you before the foundation of
[1:14:43] the world. Amen. That little tug that
[1:14:46] you feel every now and again, it's it's
[1:14:48] it's it's that part of eternity that's
[1:14:50] trying to declare itself in your life
[1:14:53] here in 2025.
[1:14:58] That little germ that was in you was to
[1:15:00] be you before the foundation of the
[1:15:02] world. You may have heard me say this
[1:15:04] before, but there was one Wednesday
[1:15:06] evening back at the old church many a
[1:15:08] few years ago. I was sitting just
[1:15:09] praying, meditating before service. The
[1:15:11] spirit of the Lord came in and spoke to
[1:15:13] me and said this. The you that was you
[1:15:15] before there was you. That's you.
[1:15:20] Because sometimes we get stuck on
[1:15:22] stupid.
[1:15:24] Because of what this did, what this does
[1:15:26] and what this is going to do. We'll get
[1:15:28] stuck on that. Why? Because the devil
[1:15:30] has set the needle on the record of our
[1:15:31] life. Some of you old folk, y'all know
[1:15:34] what I'm talking about. that needle when
[1:15:35] it get to the end of that record it
[1:15:36] would just go
[1:15:40] I'm talking about a old record player
[1:15:41] some of y'all don't know what I'm
[1:15:42] talking about you young folk
[1:15:44] but it make that noise and that's what
[1:15:46] the devil the devil wants us to get
[1:15:48] stuck on that over and over and over and
[1:15:50] over and over but God told me the you
[1:15:53] that is really you the real you Joel
[1:15:57] that's not that that's what I'm after we
[1:15:59] sing that song to be like Jesus Amen
[1:16:03] want to surrender all to him. He's not
[1:16:05] so much talking about this. He's after
[1:16:07] that part of himself that he put in
[1:16:10] before the foundation of the world. The
[1:16:12] germ that was in you was to be you
[1:16:14] before the foundation of the world. God
[1:16:16] put your name in the lamb's book of
[1:16:17] life. So we are being changed from glory
[1:16:20] to glory. That word glory means from
[1:16:22] majesty. That word also means a most
[1:16:24] glorious condition. So we're being
[1:16:27] changed from majesty to majesty. From
[1:16:29] one glorious condition to another
[1:16:31] glorious condition. That's why don't
[1:16:33] find yourself at home on Wednesday
[1:16:35] night. Don't find yourself on home on
[1:16:37] next Sunday because there's a little bit
[1:16:38] of more majesty that God wants to give
[1:16:41] to you. There's a little more glory
[1:16:42] because we're being changed from here to
[1:16:45] there.
[1:16:46] From one one experience with the Lord to
[1:16:49] the next. We're not be we're being
[1:16:51] changed from glory to glory. Not from
[1:16:53] circumstance to circumstance. Not from
[1:16:55] occurrence to occurrence. Not from trial
[1:16:58] to trial. That's what the devil wants
[1:17:00] you to believe. We're being changed from
[1:17:02] one glorious condition to another
[1:17:04] glorious condition until eventually we
[1:17:06] will be in glory. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:17:11] We've been taken away from Satan. His
[1:17:14] grip has been loosened. That's what
[1:17:16] redemption means is to be loosed. Amen.
[1:17:20] Amen. The law within you, saints,
[1:17:23] brothers, sisters, the law that's within
[1:17:25] you will not allow you to stay in that
[1:17:28] condition. Amen.
[1:17:30] You may not ever hear it again, but you
[1:17:32] will hear it today. The law, the life of
[1:17:34] God that's in you, even though it's all
[1:17:36] smutted up with sin, and the devil's
[1:17:38] trying to tell you that you can't. The
[1:17:41] law that's within you will not allow you
[1:17:43] to stay in that condition. Amen. You
[1:17:46] don't get a lot of sleep at night.
[1:17:47] You're having trouble sleeping. That's
[1:17:48] why there's a law that's trying to
[1:17:50] declare itself. Amen. And God, the
[1:17:53] spirit of God is wanting you to rise up
[1:17:55] in the life that you already have in
[1:17:57] you. Amen. and stand and look that devil
[1:17:59] in his face.
[1:18:02] I don't know of anybody, Brother Bob, I
[1:18:04] don't know of anybody on this earth that
[1:18:07] I want to stand in my way that I would
[1:18:10] give myself more to than my savior.
[1:18:15] Cuz quite frankly, if we have a view of
[1:18:17] Calvary, and we we better. Amen. But if
[1:18:19] there's anything obstructing that view,
[1:18:21] that is your God. Amen. We're supposed
[1:18:24] to keep our eyes on Jesus. If anything
[1:18:27] is blocking your view of Calvary, get it
[1:18:30] out of the way. Whatever you have to do,
[1:18:32] knock it down. Destroy it. Oh my
[1:18:35] goodness.
[1:18:39] He's supposed to be the supreme one in
[1:18:40] our lives. Amen. The law within you will
[1:18:44] not allow you to stay in that condition.
[1:18:46] Even in a fallen condition, a true child
[1:18:49] of God is made in the image of the
[1:18:51] creator. Amen. Even in a fallen
[1:18:53] condition, they possess the attribute of
[1:18:56] get backupism.
[1:18:58] Every believer has that get back up in
[1:19:01] them. I remember as a child there was a
[1:19:02] little Bobo the clown, a little bop toy.
[1:19:05] How many remember that little thing?
[1:19:07] Little blow up thing. It had sand in the
[1:19:09] bottom of it.
[1:19:10] You and it pop back up. You punch it
[1:19:13] again, it fall down. There's a little
[1:19:15] head or boom and it pop back up. That's
[1:19:17] what every believer has in them. And
[1:19:19] there's something on the inside of every
[1:19:22] believer that caused you to get back up.
[1:19:25] The devil may have run you around and
[1:19:28] around and around. You're ragged. You're
[1:19:29] tired. You You don't know if you have
[1:19:31] any more strength to go on, but the
[1:19:33] there's something on the inside
[1:19:36] that keeps working on the outside. Oh
[1:19:39] my.
[1:19:41] I hope I stir you up today. Amen.
[1:19:44] Something on the inside, even in that
[1:19:47] fallen condition, something on the
[1:19:49] inside tells him tells the the the
[1:19:52] believer that he came from another
[1:19:53] place. And that is where he must get
[1:19:56] back to, no matter the cost. No matter
[1:19:59] what I have to do, no matter what I have
[1:20:01] to give up, no matter how many friends I
[1:20:03] have to dismiss and set aside, I have to
[1:20:05] make it to heaven.
[1:20:09] My my my. No matter the cost, sorrow,
[1:20:12] sickness, death, disappointments,
[1:20:15] heartaches are all around and are are
[1:20:17] are all common. This can't be it. No. My
[1:20:22] precious mom, 91 years old back two
[1:20:24] years ago, going on three now. She lay
[1:20:26] dying at home and and she she was she
[1:20:29] was just a saint. Not because she was
[1:20:32] was my mama, but because she was my
[1:20:34] sister in Christ. And I watched her just
[1:20:38] on on the day that she was dying. The
[1:20:40] the chaplain came in and you know, he
[1:20:42] thought he was going to give him another
[1:20:43] little mark. Another one's done come to
[1:20:44] glory. We got another one. Praise God,
[1:20:46] they're dying. And they gave her their
[1:20:47] life. They made a commitment of faith.
[1:20:50] Little did he know who she he was
[1:20:52] talking to.
[1:20:54] She began to witness to him about how
[1:20:56] when when she was out in that world in a
[1:20:59] condition, lost, a sinner, that she
[1:21:02] began to have a desire. I don't want to
[1:21:04] live this way anymore. Right? I don't
[1:21:06] want to live like this. I don't care
[1:21:07] what everybody around me is doing. And
[1:21:09] she give her life to the Lord. She was
[1:21:10] there witness to the chaplain. And my
[1:21:12] son Josiah who's sitting here with me,
[1:21:13] he stepped in the room there and and
[1:21:15] again this she was dying. She was
[1:21:17] leaving and and and she her voice and
[1:21:19] all the if you've been around someone
[1:21:20] who's dying, you know what I'm talking
[1:21:21] about. She just began to fade. She
[1:21:23] wasn't talking as much and she wasn't
[1:21:25] connecting with this realm because she
[1:21:26] was on her way to another land. But when
[1:21:29] he walked into the room, he said he saw
[1:21:31] her. She had her hands up and she would
[1:21:32] whatever she was seeing, whatever she
[1:21:34] saw, whatever she was looking at, she
[1:21:36] wasn't saying, "Oh no, oh no. Oh no, I'm
[1:21:39] dying." She was saying, "Oh wow.
[1:21:42] Oh wow." So there was something that she
[1:21:46] was living for that she was about to
[1:21:49] step into.
[1:21:51] And she was being loosed from the moors
[1:21:53] of time. And as we on this side were
[1:21:56] saying, "Bye mama. Goodbye sis. We love
[1:21:58] you." There was a host on another side
[1:22:01] that was saying, "Hey, we've been
[1:22:02] waiting for you. Hello, sis. Come on."
[1:22:08] Oh my. Oh, wow. My goodness. Sorrows,
[1:22:12] sickness, death, disappointments. This
[1:22:14] can't be all that there is to it. Many
[1:22:16] people running around saying that we're
[1:22:18] in the millennium. I say hogwash. That's
[1:22:20] a lie. The devil himself and you're
[1:22:23] speaking the devil's language. We're not
[1:22:24] in no millennium. right of the prodigal
[1:22:28] son. The Bible says, "And when he came
[1:22:30] to himself," right? Now, my question is,
[1:22:33] "What self?" Yeah. How in the world did
[1:22:35] he know that he had something else to
[1:22:38] be? Yeah. Huh? Because he had come from
[1:22:41] a land that told him what he was. But
[1:22:44] what did he want to do? I want what's
[1:22:45] mine. Give me my inheritance. I want to
[1:22:47] go out and sow my oath. What did daddy
[1:22:50] do? Go on.
[1:22:52] Go on. Amen. So it can't when he when he
[1:22:56] said he come to himself and the question
[1:22:58] becomes what self because it can't be
[1:23:00] the flesh man part because it was the
[1:23:02] flesh that got him in trouble. It was
[1:23:04] the flesh that kept him eating the husk
[1:23:06] from the hog. What young man in what you
[1:23:09] young brothers, you young guys looking
[1:23:11] at me now, who in their right mind would
[1:23:13] go hang out with the hogs and eat their
[1:23:15] slop? Come on, brother. How many would
[1:23:17] do that? Raise your hand.
[1:23:19] See, so what caught It was a demon. It
[1:23:22] was a spirit. It was a devil. Right. And
[1:23:24] we're no match for him without the
[1:23:26] spirit of God. Amen.
[1:23:28] The flesh part of him is what led him
[1:23:30] into that condition. But the word man,
[1:23:32] yes, the word man, listen, the word man,
[1:23:35] the word man part of that young boy
[1:23:37] caused him to remember from where he
[1:23:39] came. Yes. Right. Amen. Is that right?
[1:23:42] And in that condition, something inside
[1:23:44] of him raised him up and led him back
[1:23:46] home. Amen. Luke 15:18 says, "I will
[1:23:50] arise."
[1:23:51] That's what came out of his mouth.
[1:23:54] That's what he said. I will arise. That
[1:23:56] word arise means to raise up. To raise
[1:23:58] up again. To raise up from the dead.
[1:24:02] Caused to be born. Amen. So here he was
[1:24:06] dead in his sin.
[1:24:08] If you're not living in your proper
[1:24:10] position, you are dead while you are yet
[1:24:13] alive.
[1:24:16] Amen. What was it? He received a
[1:24:18] resurrection. Remember we were saying
[1:24:20] the only way a resurrection can come is
[1:24:22] when there is a death. So he received
[1:24:25] his resurrection, watch this, by his own
[1:24:28] obedience to the power that already was
[1:24:31] within him.
[1:24:36] So you you you you want that power to
[1:24:38] live, right? It's in you, brother. Amen.
[1:24:40] It's in you, sis. It's already in you.
[1:24:44] Call it on the scene. Call Jesus on the
[1:24:48] scene. Amen. He's not as far away as you
[1:24:50] think. So he went back home and when he
[1:24:53] arrived, Luke 15:22 says the the father
[1:24:55] says, "Bring forth the best robe and put
[1:24:58] it on him and put a ring on his hand and
[1:25:00] shoes on his feet." So he makes it back
[1:25:03] home and he gets a new robe. He gets a
[1:25:05] he he gets a new identity. And the thing
[1:25:07] of it was is that it was always there.
[1:25:10] He didn't have to leave. He didn't have
[1:25:13] to go. No.
[1:25:15] But that daddy's heart, brother, that
[1:25:17] daddy's heart was watching for him. The
[1:25:19] Bible says when he saw him from afar.
[1:25:22] So he wasn't somewhere to well, forget
[1:25:24] him, just ride him off, dismiss him, he
[1:25:26] was looking for him. Why? Because of L O
[1:25:28] V E that day in the garden that when
[1:25:30] Adam and Eve was walking out, the the
[1:25:32] prophet talked about how he saw like a
[1:25:34] funnel begin to come down and the words
[1:25:36] begin to form Lo V. I will make a way
[1:25:39] for you to get back.
[1:25:42] He loves you, saints. Young man, young
[1:25:44] girl, he loves you.
[1:25:47] Jesus loves you. This you already know.
[1:25:50] For the Bible tells you so.
[1:25:53] You remember that song? When you growing
[1:25:56] up, it's still real. In fact, it's more
[1:25:59] real now for you than it was then. Queen
[1:26:02] of the South, in a great hour that we're
[1:26:03] living. Amen. I'm just gonna have to
[1:26:06] shut up. My goodness. That we're living
[1:26:08] a great day that we're living in. God
[1:26:09] has sent his son as a propitiation for
[1:26:11] our sins. He died in ourstead. He was
[1:26:13] the innocent one that became guilty that
[1:26:15] we guilty might be innocent. This the
[1:26:17] story is this. Think of it as as you
[1:26:19] measure your own corruptible life in his
[1:26:22] wow. As you measure your own corruptible
[1:26:24] life in his presence, he's still
[1:26:26] allowing you to come up into his
[1:26:28] presence in your corruption. Why?
[1:26:29] Because he loves you. And he wants you
[1:26:31] to know that there there there is more
[1:26:33] in you than you realize. Yes, sir. So
[1:26:36] come so come bring your corruptible
[1:26:39] life. Jesus became you that you through
[1:26:41] his grace might become him. Yes. You and
[1:26:45] your corruption. Me and my corruption.
[1:26:47] He's allowing us to take on deity. Yes.
[1:26:54] You who are going to hell, he took your
[1:26:56] place that you might set in heaven with
[1:26:58] him at his place. You who were a son of
[1:27:00] the devil by nature.
[1:27:03] He took the nature or the sin of your
[1:27:05] nature that you might become a son of
[1:27:07] God and set in the heavenlies with him.
[1:27:09] Amen. He was that lamb redeemer, a
[1:27:11] bloody bleeding lamb. At the first of
[1:27:14] the book in the Bible, in the Garden of
[1:27:15] Eden, what was it? It was a lamb
[1:27:17] redeemer. In the middle of the book at
[1:27:20] Calvary, what was it? It was a lamb
[1:27:22] redeemer. At the end of the book in
[1:27:24] Revelations, the closing out of the
[1:27:25] scriptures, when John turns, he sees a
[1:27:28] what? A lamb redeemer. A bleeding bloody
[1:27:31] lamb. A bleeding bloody lamb in the
[1:27:34] middle of the book. A bleeding bloody
[1:27:35] lamb at the beginning of the book. This
[1:27:36] book is filled with blood. You cannot
[1:27:38] get away from the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:27:41] You cannot live a life without the blood
[1:27:43] of Christ.
[1:27:45] You can't take the beliefs and doctrines
[1:27:47] and things and and and the the things
[1:27:48] that the prophet has said and hold that
[1:27:50] up for God. You have to have a bleeding
[1:27:53] bloody word.
[1:27:57] And if you bring that message, I'll say
[1:27:59] it that way. If you bring that message,
[1:28:01] it better be dripping with blood,
[1:28:02] brother.
[1:28:03] Don't pick out your little favorite
[1:28:04] quotes that will allow you to live the
[1:28:06] way you want to live and allow you to
[1:28:07] treat people the way you think you can
[1:28:09] treat them. There's still a way to love,
[1:28:12] Brother Wade.
[1:28:14] You can have all your quotes that you
[1:28:15] want to. You can draw all the lines that
[1:28:18] you want. Well, they crossed the line.
[1:28:19] Bless God. The prophet talked about
[1:28:22] drawing a circle.
[1:28:24] So, if you if you're drawing lines,
[1:28:26] you're not even in the message. Amen. I
[1:28:29] said it. You drawing lines you ain't in.
[1:28:32] You don't even believe the message.
[1:28:35] I'll take it up with you after church,
[1:28:37] too, if you if we need to.
[1:28:40] Huh? We're to be drawing circles, a
[1:28:42] circle of love to encompass everybody.
[1:28:46] Not just a lamb, but a bleeding bloody
[1:28:47] lamb. Death. Speaking of death, eternal
[1:28:50] life. We don't just get eternal life.
[1:28:52] Eternal life is already in us. Amen.
[1:28:56] Think about that, saint. Did you hear
[1:28:57] what I just said? We don't get eternal
[1:28:59] life. Eternal life is already in us. We
[1:29:02] are already eternal. We are on our way
[1:29:04] to the fullness of that. My goodness. We
[1:29:08] always had eternal life. There's only
[1:29:09] one form of eternal life and that is
[1:29:11] God. But God told AMC, "Restore the man
[1:29:15] his wife." Is that right? I'm just a
[1:29:18] passing through. Amen. We are able to
[1:29:21] make this very confession right in the
[1:29:23] face of the devil himself.
[1:29:27] Amen. Our God is tremendous. His
[1:29:30] strength never failth. He goes through
[1:29:32] the fire just he goes through the fire
[1:29:34] just to save a sinner. Huh? So I love
[1:29:37] the line in that song that says, "Stand
[1:29:39] in your position and watch the
[1:29:42] miraculous come into action. Just stand.
[1:29:45] Don't move. Don't say a word. Don't
[1:29:47] don't don't do an eye. Don't cross a
[1:29:49] tea." Cuz they're already dotting.
[1:29:51] They're already cross. You stand in your
[1:29:53] position and watch what God will do.
[1:29:55] Amen.
[1:29:57] Cuz sometimes God's saying to you
[1:29:59] clearly and loudly and you've heard him
[1:30:00] say it, but you're not listening. So I'm
[1:30:02] here to remind you again. Shut up.
[1:30:07] Just shut up. Hallelujah. You done
[1:30:09] confused enough people already. Just
[1:30:11] shut up and let God do what he's going
[1:30:13] to do anyway. Cuz quite frankly, the
[1:30:16] people have heard you chatter chatter
[1:30:17] chatter like that old chipmunk enough.
[1:30:19] So when they see you and not hear you,
[1:30:21] then they will know, ah, something
[1:30:24] mighty is happening. Let me be still a
[1:30:27] moment. Amen. Amen. I'm g have to find
[1:30:28] my hiding place and preach. My So
[1:30:32] looking the devil right in the face and
[1:30:34] making that confession cuz the
[1:30:35] conditions or the circumstances can no
[1:30:37] longer stand because why? It possesses
[1:30:40] no life. That's right. There's no life
[1:30:42] in the devil. He's just a bluff. Right.
[1:30:45] And and and one of my most powerful
[1:30:47] quotes and that I love within the
[1:30:49] message, I said there's a lot, but one
[1:30:51] of the the the smallest most powerful uh
[1:30:53] quotes or or words even in the messages,
[1:30:55] the word, it's just a threeletter word
[1:30:58] is boo.
[1:31:00] That's all we got to say. We don't need
[1:31:01] to sit down and and write out a big long
[1:31:03] dissertation for the devil. Listen here,
[1:31:05] got this point. The prophet said here
[1:31:06] and my pastor said this and here's this
[1:31:08] scripture and that scripture and here's
[1:31:09] this quote. Putting all this stuff
[1:31:11] together, you bring it before the devil
[1:31:12] and he just looks at it and said,
[1:31:15] Okay. Amen.
[1:31:17] He'll say amen to what you bring him.
[1:31:19] But when you say that word boo, the
[1:31:22] prophet says he just begins to get
[1:31:23] smaller and smaller and smaller because
[1:31:26] why he's saying boo to you. You say boo
[1:31:28] back.
[1:31:30] But you have a bigger boo than the devil
[1:31:33] has.
[1:31:36] Tuck that one in your pocket. 1
[1:31:38] Corinthians 10:13. As the musicians
[1:31:40] would come, I'm just going to have to
[1:31:41] quit. There hath no temptation taken
[1:31:43] you, but such as is common to man.
[1:31:46] That's right. Common after the manner of
[1:31:50] man, applied to things belonging to men.
[1:31:54] So, there are just some things in our
[1:31:57] humanity that we're just going to have
[1:31:58] to all experience. That's right. Huh?
[1:32:02] How many's ever been frustrated? I broke
[1:32:04] that thing again. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:10] Tearing stuff up. I was told to make
[1:32:12] myself at home.
[1:32:17] So after matter, man, these things are
[1:32:19] common because temptation belongs to
[1:32:21] humanity, not to God.
[1:32:24] There will be rough spots. Listen, there
[1:32:28] will be things to arise and come up that
[1:32:29] will knock the very wind from you and
[1:32:31] leave you devastated. Absolutely. Joel,
[1:32:35] you're not telling me anything I don't
[1:32:36] already know. I know, but I'm just
[1:32:38] reminding you. I'm trying to stir up
[1:32:40] your gift by way of remembrance.
[1:32:43] I'm just trying to obey the word. That's
[1:32:45] life. Cuz we're living in a finite
[1:32:48] realm. The body will suffer attack. This
[1:32:51] spirit will be attacked. Your very soul
[1:32:54] will be targeted for destruction.
[1:32:57] Listen to me, you cute folk.
[1:33:00] But because temptation possesses only
[1:33:03] mortal strength,
[1:33:06] that lets us know that it can't last
[1:33:08] forever.
[1:33:10] There is a land I'm homesick for. I've
[1:33:13] never seen it before. 1 Corinthians
[1:33:16] 15:54. So when this corruptible shall
[1:33:18] have put on incorruption, and this
[1:33:20] mortal shall have put on immortality,
[1:33:22] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:33:24] that is written, "Death is swallowed up
[1:33:27] in victory." Amen. Absolutely. Amen.
[1:33:30] There's one quote I wanted to get to.
[1:33:32] The arrow of God's deliverance. Amen.
[1:33:34] What's the matter? That's why they're
[1:33:37] staying at home stuck their head in a
[1:33:40] television instead of the Bible. Got
[1:33:43] nothing against the television if it's
[1:33:44] used for God's program. All right. It
[1:33:46] was God's way in the first way. Who made
[1:33:49] the airwaves and so forth? It was God.
[1:33:52] But the devil just took it and perverted
[1:33:54] it is all it was. Hollywood got a hold.
[1:33:56] Anything they get a hold of is rotten
[1:33:57] cuz they can't come from nothing else. I
[1:34:00] read in a crime magazine where those
[1:34:02] most famous women out on the street of
[1:34:04] prostitution at $50 a night living with
[1:34:07] men and things all up and down the coast
[1:34:09] and then run out there and some other
[1:34:11] four or five husbands and you little
[1:34:14] girls want to pattern yourselves after
[1:34:15] that. Yes. When the man out there that's
[1:34:18] supposed to be such a move movie actor
[1:34:20] and so forth when they live with women
[1:34:22] so much till the natural course of life
[1:34:24] is changing and they become perverted.
[1:34:27] Now this was back in 1956 and saying you
[1:34:30] want to pattern yourself after that
[1:34:32] losing the natural course of life. So a
[1:34:35] man's now saying that he wants to be a
[1:34:37] woman and they're trying to tell me that
[1:34:39] a man can have a baby.
[1:34:42] They trying to tell me that all they
[1:34:43] want to. Amen. I'm going to say no, you
[1:34:46] can't. That's right. Huh? You're still a
[1:34:48] man. I'm going still say yes, sir. No,
[1:34:51] sir. No, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. If it
[1:34:52] offends, I I'll call it as I see it.
[1:34:56] Amen. If you got a Adam's apple, hello.
[1:35:02] Look yonder at Calvary where a man hung
[1:35:04] on the cross and died. The only real
[1:35:06] example that was ever put in the world
[1:35:08] for human beings to live by is the man
[1:35:12] Christ Jesus.
[1:35:15] And we've never seen an age where what
[1:35:17] do we have these shows called? American
[1:35:19] Idol and and and and and all of these
[1:35:21] programs and things and and all of these
[1:35:23] sports stars and and pattern the the
[1:35:26] kids patterning themselves after them
[1:35:27] and all of these idols and all of these
[1:35:29] figures that it's never been as prolific
[1:35:32] as it is now. But he says, "Look yonder
[1:35:34] at Calvary where a man hung on a cross
[1:35:37] and died. There's not one sports star
[1:35:39] that died for you. There's not one movie
[1:35:42] star that would give their life for
[1:35:43] you."
[1:35:44] They may play the part of Jesus and and
[1:35:47] in a movie, but they would never give
[1:35:48] their life for you. They may be even
[1:35:50] moved by that experience and and and
[1:35:52] things, but they would never give their
[1:35:54] life for you. The only real example that
[1:35:56] was ever put in the world for human
[1:35:58] beings to live by is the man Christ
[1:36:00] Jesus. Amen. That's right. Then we call
[1:36:02] ourselves Christians and harmonize our
[1:36:04] souls with such as that. No wonder the
[1:36:06] world leaks in. No wonder something's
[1:36:09] happening. No wonder you can't have
[1:36:10] souls stirring.
[1:36:13] We need our souls stirred today. Amen.
[1:36:16] Let's bow our heads. The great
[1:36:19] escape. Father God, we love you. We
[1:36:22] honor you. We love you. We adore you. We
[1:36:25] give you all glory and praise. Oh God,
[1:36:28] every fiber of my being, I want to be
[1:36:30] submitted to you. But here in this place
[1:36:33] called time, we have the trappings of
[1:36:35] time sometimes. And it makes it hard for
[1:36:37] us to lift up our hands. It makes it
[1:36:40] hard for us to say amen because we feel
[1:36:42] that little pang of of of of regret and
[1:36:45] and the devil putting that that we did
[1:36:47] last night even or the night before or
[1:36:49] yesterday and all these things. He's
[1:36:51] always putting that before us. And we
[1:36:52] say, "I don't want to be a hypocrite."
[1:36:55] But Lord, there's a life inside of us
[1:36:58] that cries out greater than any voice
[1:37:00] that the devil could bring our way. We
[1:37:02] don't want to talk the devil's language.
[1:37:04] We want to talk your language. So
[1:37:06] forgive us when we have it. Forgive us
[1:37:08] when we don't. Forgive us when we won't
[1:37:10] because we know that you will, you can,
[1:37:13] and you have. So may we attach ourselves
[1:37:16] to that. We love you. We honor you. We
[1:37:18] adore you. Thank you for this time, this
[1:37:20] place. And it's in Jesus name we pray.
[1:37:23] Amen. If anyone would need prayer, we'll
[1:37:25] be more than glad to
[1:37:29] to do that with you.
[1:37:32] It's just a wonderful thing to know the
[1:37:33] Lord.
[1:37:35] Stand with me if you would. Bright
[1:37:37] morning star,

[1:58:24] Didn't say pick up the phone and call
[1:58:26] the pastor.
[1:58:30] I said just call on his name.
[1:58:34] He'll be the one that'll take care of
[1:58:36] you. He's the sustainer.
[1:58:39] He's the one that'll absolutely never
[1:58:41] fail you. Never has God failed a person.
[1:58:46] And we have to put our dependency on
[1:58:47] that. Sometimes we don't understand what
[1:58:49] God does. But I think he already he
[1:58:51] prepared us when he said your ways are
[1:58:53] not my ways. Right? We don't think the
[1:58:56] same way he said. He said just trust in
[1:58:59] me. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. God's
[1:59:03] with us today. Amen. God's here to take
[1:59:06] care of everything you need. If you have
[1:59:08] an issue in your life, God's right now
[1:59:11] able to take care of it.
[1:59:14] He's able
[1:59:15] to let something happen that you haven't
[1:59:19] wanted to happen in a long time. It's
[1:59:21] open up
[1:59:23] and let God do the work. Let God in. You
[1:59:27] know, he said, "Put your cares on
[1:59:31] me." He said, "Don't trust in this.
[1:59:33] Don't trust in man. Don't trust in
[1:59:36] government." He said, "Trust in me."
[1:59:38] Right? He said, "Cast all your cares on
[1:59:40] me." Oh, I got too many cares. No.
[1:59:44] 8 billion people could cast their cares
[1:59:46] on Jesus and it wouldn't bother him one
[1:59:49] bit. He could take care of every one of
[1:59:51] them. What a mighty God we serve. You
[1:59:55] love the Lord. Today's been wonderful.
[1:59:57] This weekend's been a good time. Wish
[2:00:00] you to appreciate all you coming and
[2:00:02] what you do. Give brother uh brother
[2:00:05] Joel a big big
[2:00:09] ma'am.
[2:00:20] Who?
[2:00:23] Oh, yeah. James Wilson. Yeah. Okay.
[2:00:25] Absolutely. Absolutely. We've seen God
[2:00:28] intervene
[2:00:31] and we'll see him intervene on this one.
[2:00:33] We sure we sure love that's my second
[2:00:36] mom. So, uh, we sure are. Keep in touch
[2:00:39] with them and and we will, uh, uh, give
[2:00:42] you the report, Lord, as soon as we can
[2:00:44] get it. But the Lord's able. The Lord
[2:00:46] can do what he wants to do. Like I said
[2:00:48] before, his ways are not ours.
[2:00:50] And he expl he told us that. So, it's
[2:00:53] not a surprise. He already told us in
[2:00:54] the Bible that we don't think alike,
[2:00:57] but we're supposed to have the mind of
[2:00:59] Christ. So, we need to start
[2:01:00] understanding a little bit of how he
[2:01:03] thinks, right? Because remember, his
[2:01:05] thoughts are perfect. We you've changed
[2:01:07] your thought a hundred times sitting
[2:01:08] here today. But
[2:01:12] like when's brother Joel going to
[2:01:13] finish? When's he going to start? What's
[2:01:15] happening here? Why is he talking about
[2:01:17] me? Yes, sir. He wasn't talking about
[2:01:21] you. God was.
[2:01:23] God was speaking to your heart. He We've
[2:01:26] got to start believing that God's going
[2:01:28] to use a five-fold ministry. And when he
[2:01:30] does, he that don't mean we use him.
[2:01:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He uses us.
[2:01:36] He uses the five-fold ministry to take
[2:01:38] care of the things that need to be taken
[2:01:39] care of. And I hope today we've had
[2:01:41] things taken care of. I hope we can
[2:01:43] leave this place and be happy, be
[2:01:48] free. And I like that threeletter word.
[2:01:51] Boo.
[2:01:54] How powerful is that? Boo devil. Amen.
[2:01:58] The Bible says, "Resist the devil and
[2:01:59] he'll flee from you." Well, that's where
[2:02:00] the scripture come from, I believe,
[2:02:01] where brother random said, "Boo." He was
[2:02:03] thinking of that. He said, "Man," he
[2:02:05] said, "All you got to do is say boo." He
[2:02:06] said, "Yeah, just say boo back." Yes,
[2:02:08] sir. So, resist the devil and he'll flee
[2:02:10] from you. You love the Lord. Thank you
[2:02:13] all for coming. We have food downstairs
[2:02:15] if you want to stay and eat, but we've
[2:02:17] got to get uh we're still we got good
[2:02:19] time and it's just 1:00. Uh thank you
[2:02:22] all sisters and brothers for everything

[2:02:26] absolute wonderful time. has been
[2:02:28] flawless and run well and we've got um
[2:02:31] people that are working and we
[2:02:33] appreciate all of you that um I I told
[2:02:37] myself years and years ago I said we we
[2:02:40] need to
[2:02:41] fellowship but it's going to be that
[2:02:43] we're going to have to put a little bit
[2:02:44] more effort forth than we usually have
[2:02:46] because it takes people
[2:02:49] to put the food together to to serve the
[2:02:52] people. But I'd rather serve the family
[2:02:54] of God. Amen. Than to serve the world.
[2:02:56] Right. I'd rather if I was going to have
[2:02:58] a job, I'd have a job serving the people
[2:03:00] of God than serving the people of the
[2:03:03] world. And we appreciate what all you've
[2:03:05] done, sisters and brothers, this
[2:03:07] weekend. Brother Joel pouring his heart
[2:03:08] out. We appreciate him. And if you go
[2:03:10] with us in July to brother Andre, you're
[2:03:13] going to hear him again. Praise the
[2:03:14] Lord. Cuz he'll be doing the Saturday
[2:03:15] youth service just like he always has
[2:03:17] the past two years. So, um, we sure
[2:03:20] appreciate him and love him with the
[2:03:21] love of the Lord. He's got a good
[2:03:23] ministry and we appreciate him. got a
[2:03:25] good spirit about him and uh thanks for
[2:03:27] for bringing the young adult children of
[2:03:31] yours with you and uh we appreciate them
[2:03:34] and God bless you. That's uh all mine's
[2:03:37] clear. Uh remember if you don't know
[2:03:39] where you're going just ask somebody the
[2:03:41] address. It's down there where we always
[2:03:43] have the not always but we have had our
[2:03:46] park place where we have our um spring
[2:03:49] flings and all the eastern all that
[2:03:51] stuff. So, um it'll be down there at
[2:03:54] 3:00. Uh and he's he'll start promptly
[2:03:57] at 3:00. So, we need to be there by
[2:03:59] then. So, let's bow our heads and we'll
[2:04:01] um uh bless the food and then we will be
[2:04:04] dismissed. Heavenly
[2:04:05] Father, thank you, Lord, for our brother
[2:04:08] pouring his heart out, Lord.
[2:04:10] And we now, Lord, see the the strain of
[2:04:13] of the praying, Lord. It's it's weakened
[2:04:15] him a little, Father. And I pray that
[2:04:17] you'd give him supernatural strength so
[2:04:18] he can drive back home, Father. Lord, he
[2:04:21] poured his heart out to the people,
[2:04:22] Lord. And I pray that you'll pour your
[2:04:24] heart out to him, Lord, and give him
[2:04:26] strength as he continues back home,
[2:04:27] Lord. Be with him and bless him, Lord,
[2:04:29] as he goes to his job, his his family,
[2:04:32] his children, all the different things,
[2:04:34] Lord. That you'll bless our brother's
[2:04:35] life, Father. Be with each one that's
[2:04:37] here, Lord. I pray that we've all been
[2:04:39] touched by you today, Father. And Lord,
[2:04:41] that we'll give you honor and praise and
[2:04:43] glory as the as the words say there,
[2:04:45] Lord. And we'll give it to you, Lord,
[2:04:47] because we know who you are. You're our
[2:04:50] father. You're our bridegroom. You're
[2:04:53] our husband. All those different titles.
[2:04:55] You've said that to your bride and the
[2:04:58] children of God. Father, just be with
[2:05:00] each one. Bless us as we continue down,
[2:05:03] Lord, and go and see a little bit of the
[2:05:06] natural things of life, Lord, and keep
[2:05:08] us safe and protect us, Lord, as we as
[2:05:11] we do, Lord. Go and and u handle some of
[2:05:14] those uh things, Lord, that you'll keep
[2:05:16] us safe and protect us, Father. Just
[2:05:18] bless this day. Give us this daily
[2:05:20] bread. Bless the food downstairs, Lord.
[2:05:22] It'll sanctify it to our bodies and
[2:05:25] Lord, us into your kingdom. In Jesus
[2:05:26] name we pray. Amen. God bless you.
[2:05:29] You're dismissed.
[2:05:32] Or drop your spirit in the
[2:05:37] ground. Mount up with wings.
[2:05:42] Little
[2:05:44] eagle and
[2:05:47] fly.
[2:05:48] So spread to our wings.
