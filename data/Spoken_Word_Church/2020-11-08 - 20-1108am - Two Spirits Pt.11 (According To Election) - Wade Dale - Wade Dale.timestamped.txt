[13:49] asked to pray for brother
[13:51] brother uh ryan's family also with the
[13:54] loss of the dad
[13:56] and uh god knows everything
[14:02] he knows what he's doing and we don't
[14:04] question
[14:05] hey man i think many times we
[14:09] we do question and that's okay it's all
[14:11] right
[14:12] but uh even with um
[14:16] sister alicia's mom and the different
[14:17] ones that have passed on
[14:20] you know you this is the way i see it i
[14:23] i
[14:23] you may not see it this way but being a
[14:26] minister of the gospel
[14:27] i see that it's the providence of god
[14:31] to take if they're not going to be
[14:35] taken up in a rapture
[14:38] they'll be resurrected and taken up in a
[14:40] rapture but if they don't
[14:41] they don't have to go through the
[14:42] tribulation period
[14:44] god will preserve them and then right
[14:46] there to white throne judgment let's see
[14:48] what god can do for them
[14:49] amen don't let them go through this
[14:51] horrible thing you know
[14:53] and and we don't pray that god will take
[14:55] them but you know that's the providence
[14:56] of god
[14:57] the providence of god is is he's if he
[14:59] knows he's going to give him eternal
[15:00] life down
[15:01] at the end why let him go through the
[15:03] tribulation just go ahead and take them
[15:04] on now preserve them i've always said
[15:06] preserve he preserved them
[15:08] he takes them and preserves them
[15:12] until the time appointed and to me
[15:14] that's the providence of god and i thank
[15:15] god for that
[15:16] we don't like the separation but we do
[15:19] say thank you lord that
[15:20] that they won't have to go through this
[15:21] awfulness that the world's fixing to
[15:23] have to go through so
[15:24] we just that's just the way i think and
[15:26] and i think god is uh
[15:29] he's a good god he's not a mean god he's
[15:32] a good god
[15:33] he knows what he's doing i was just
[15:35] reading brother brown said he god knows
[15:36] what he's doing
[15:38] so we just need to depend on that god
[15:40] knows what he's doing he
[15:42] knew before the foundation of the world
[15:44] and today we're gonna it's kind of
[15:45] strange
[15:47] uh well it's really not but we're on two
[15:49] spirits and then uh back
[15:51] right after wednesday night i thought
[15:52] well lord what are we going to
[15:54] what are we going to speak on and and i
[15:56] read the scripture on
[15:58] in romans where god talks about
[16:00] according to election
[16:02] well we just had an election so
[16:06] we're going to speak on according to
[16:07] election but it's not going to be of
[16:08] that election that went on out there
[16:10] it's going to be an election that comes
[16:12] on in here in a christian life
[16:14] amen so let's let's read first john 4
[16:17] verse 1.
[16:18] we're still on two spirits we still want
[16:21] to
[16:22] see that how god is a good god
[16:25] like i said before he's gracious he
[16:27] showed us in the end time where we
[16:29] were at and before the foundation of the
[16:32] world
[16:33] what we're going to do here everything
[16:35] he's given us already and where we're
[16:37] going
[16:38] thank god for that good to have our
[16:39] brother with us today i don't know if
[16:41] he's ever been here before you
[16:42] never been here before well god bless
[16:43] you good to have you in the house with
[16:45] lord
[16:46] you got some pretty good company over
[16:47] there with sister um kathy and
[16:51] brother ray but good to have you with us
[16:53] brother and you just make yourself at
[16:54] home and
[16:55] you're part of the family of god so we
[16:58] don't have to
[16:59] you don't have to join nothing just come
[17:00] on man just be part of the family
[17:03] the next time you come you won't be
[17:05] introduced because you'll just be part
[17:06] of the family
[17:08] first john 4 verse 1 let's bow our heads
[17:11] lord thank you today that we can stand
[17:15] in this end time of chaos and
[17:18] and everything falling apart and lord we
[17:21] just had a
[17:23] a pop-up there on my phone from the
[17:26] weather channel that a
[17:27] 4.0 earthquake just hit massachusetts
[17:30] in rhode island lord that's on the other
[17:33] side
[17:35] that's over here toward us and the bible
[17:36] said there would be
[17:38] earthquakes and divers or many places
[17:41] lord we're expecting lord you to as
[17:45] brother joe and i were
[17:46] speaking this morning anything that
[17:48] happens in this world
[17:49] it happens because the bride has come to
[17:52] serm some sort of place
[17:54] good or bad amen bad
[17:57] and that we need to be scolded
[18:00] are good and that we've come into the
[18:03] word more we're seeing more the
[18:05] revelation is coming more deep
[18:07] it's becoming more intimate with us lord
[18:10] and then we're just going to slide right
[18:12] out of here and let the world have it
[18:14] father give us this day our daily bread
[18:16] forgive us of our sins be with the ones
[18:17] that are sick
[18:18] thank you for bringing all the ones
[18:20] through it lord and i pray lord the ones
[18:21] that are going through
[18:23] they're so virus and all the different
[18:24] things anything lord is going
[18:26] in the body lord we pray that you would
[18:28] eliminate that lord
[18:30] because you are the healer father we
[18:32] give you all the praise and honor and
[18:33] glory and
[18:34] we give you the service in jesus name
[18:36] amen
[18:38] first john 4 verse 1 says beloved
[18:39] believe not every spirit but try the
[18:41] spirits whether they are of god
[18:43] because many false prophets are going
[18:45] out into the world hereby know you the
[18:47] spirit of god
[18:48] every spirit that confesses that jesus
[18:50] christ come in flesh
[18:52] is of god now like i said before you can
[18:54] ask a drunk on the street if jesus
[18:55] christ came in flesh and he says yes
[18:57] that doesn't make him a son of god
[18:59] he's got to believe and keep on
[19:02] believing and he's got to show the
[19:03] attribute of that believing
[19:05] by doing what the word said and every
[19:07] spirit that confesses not that jesus
[19:09] christ has come in the flesh is not of
[19:10] god
[19:11] and this is the spirit of antichrist
[19:13] antichrist that's what we're talking
[19:14] about today two spirits this
[19:15] been this is part 11 we've been on the
[19:18] two spirits from the foundation of the
[19:20] world
[19:21] when lucifer fought with michael those
[19:24] two lines
[19:25] started and they came to earth and they
[19:28] went all the way through as we were
[19:29] talking wednesday night
[19:31] and rode right on through there in the
[19:33] garden of eden
[19:35] in a situation of cain and abel there
[19:38] and i want you to understand i didn't
[19:39] bring out winning tonight but before i
[19:40] forget it
[19:43] you read the commentary about the
[19:44] denominational world and they talk about
[19:46] the four horse riders
[19:47] and they say that's four different
[19:49] people
[19:51] it's not thank god for a prophet
[19:55] that told us that he got off that horse
[19:58] got on the black
[19:59] horse got off that red horse got off
[20:01] that horse got on the
[20:03] uh black horse got off that horse and
[20:06] now he's riding in the pale horse
[20:08] so it's the same brother brown said
[20:09] satan's superman
[20:11] all right so we know it so then there's
[20:12] that two spirits you got the spirit of
[20:14] god and spirit of the devil
[20:16] right and that's what that horse rider
[20:18] was there's
[20:19] there's combat beasts that are of god
[20:21] there's those four horse riders
[20:24] are therion beasts that are that are
[20:27] not good and every spirit that confesses
[20:29] not that jesus is coming flesh is not of
[20:30] god
[20:31] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[20:34] wherever you have heard that it should
[20:35] come and even now
[20:36] already is in the world this is a.d 60
[20:38] or 70 something
[20:40] or 90 80 90. you are of god little
[20:43] children and have overcome them
[20:44] because greater jesus in you than he
[20:46] that's in the world they are
[20:48] of the world therefore speak they of the
[20:49] world and the world heareth them
[20:51] we are of god he that knoweth god
[20:53] heareth us
[20:54] he that is not of god heareth not us
[20:57] hereby know we the spirit of truth
[20:59] and the spirit of error you may be
[21:01] seated and the lord adds blessing
[21:03] to the reading of the word let's go
[21:05] through these quotes try not to be very
[21:08] lengthy today but just kind of give you
[21:11] an overview of what we were talking
[21:12] about wednesday night
[21:14] for those of you that weren't here but
[21:15] let's read the first quote that we've
[21:17] been
[21:18] that we've been reading every time now
[21:20] remember this christ in the true church
[21:22] now
[21:22] listen there's a true church in the
[21:24] false church all right always has been
[21:26] always will be a church we're not
[21:29] talking about drunks and hordes and all
[21:31] that we're talking about two spirits
[21:33] in a church okay in the framework of the
[21:36] church
[21:37] all right we're not talking about
[21:39] baptist methodist pentecostal whatever
[21:41] background you come from
[21:43] remember we're not talking about people
[21:45] it's spirits that we're worried with
[21:47] it's spirits that anoints each and every
[21:49] one of us it's spirits that motivate us
[21:52] to do what we do but now remember when
[21:54] we get to the end of this you're going
[21:55] to see this
[21:56] according to election though is you got
[21:58] to one day
[22:00] make a stand and say yes or no
[22:03] no dilly dallying around there's a day
[22:06] that you got to come to and say
[22:08] this is it all right christ in the two
[22:11] church
[22:12] is a continuation of the book of acts
[22:14] but the book of revelation shows how
[22:15] that the antichrist spirit would come
[22:17] into the church
[22:18] and defile it making it lukewarm formal
[22:20] and powerless you look in the book of
[22:22] revelations and you see that
[22:23] it exposes satan revealing his works the
[22:26] attempted destruction of god's people
[22:28] and the discrediting now remember i said
[22:30] before
[22:31] satan in the beast in the garden of eden
[22:34] did not
[22:34] say there was not a god he did not say
[22:38] what god said was wrong he just added
[22:41] that one word
[22:42] he said you'll not surely die
[22:45] so he discredited the word of god he
[22:48] didn't do away with it satan
[22:49] satan's too smart to do away with the
[22:51] word of god
[22:53] because when the two spirits start
[22:54] battling it was lucifer and
[22:56] and michael and it was the two heads it
[23:00] was the two
[23:01] top guys that were fighting all right so
[23:03] don't you think that they're not very
[23:05] deceptive
[23:06] because they fought and then satan comes
[23:09] down here
[23:10] and god comes down and then he anoints
[23:12] us and we'll get into that election part
[23:15] in just a little bit right down to the
[23:16] time that he is cast into the lake of
[23:18] fire he fights that he cannot stand it
[23:20] he knows that if the people get the true
[23:22] revelation
[23:23] of the true church all right and what
[23:26] she
[23:27] is and what she stands for and that she
[23:30] can do the greater work she will be an
[23:32] invincible army i like invincible if
[23:35] they get a true revelation of the two
[23:37] spirits within the framework
[23:39] of the christian church
[23:42] in the book of luke and there it says
[23:44] they come to me in
[23:45] in the at the judgment bar in other
[23:48] words they said have i not
[23:50] cast out devils have i not spoken have i
[23:52] not judas is going to do that
[23:54] judas did the same he preached the
[23:56] gospel he cast out devils
[23:57] that's how close it is it's not that
[24:00] it's not that the drunk's going to walk
[24:01] up and say have i not get no
[24:03] it's the religious person that's going
[24:05] to come up and say
[24:06] have i not done these mighty things in
[24:08] your name and jesus is going to say
[24:10] depart from me i never knew you in other
[24:12] words i never had an intimate
[24:14] relationship
[24:15] you never said yes when i came to you to
[24:18] give you the baptism of the holy ghost
[24:20] you turned it down wow
[24:23] because they're going to be surprised
[24:25] remember the old saying that we're going
[24:26] to be really surprised who makes it and
[24:28] who don't
[24:29] right because you know what it's god
[24:31] looking at it not us looking at a
[24:32] laundry list of what we need to do do's
[24:34] and don'ts and all these things
[24:36] it's the heart that god looks at if you
[24:38] get a true revelation of the true spirit
[24:40] within the framework of the christian
[24:42] church and by god's spirit discern and
[24:43] withstand the anachronic spirit
[24:45] so you got to have god's spirit first to
[24:48] discern the other spirit
[24:50] all right if not listen if you don't
[24:51] have the spirit of god in your soul
[24:52] today you are that other spirit
[24:54] whether you like it or not amen you're
[24:57] sitting there with
[24:58] satan will be powerless before her
[25:00] you're sitting there
[25:01] and the bible calls it the seed of satan
[25:03] now we know the seed of satan is going
[25:05] to be out there
[25:06] in the beast when we leave here but the
[25:09] seed of satan
[25:10] is the soul of man if you're not born
[25:12] again
[25:13] that's what he wants uh sure he wants to
[25:15] build a kingdom but how is he building
[25:17] that kingdom through men
[25:18] that's right satan's building the
[25:20] kingdom through men all right
[25:22] what's god doing god's building the
[25:24] kingdom through men
[25:25] and man you see how close it's going to
[25:27] be all right
[25:29] so number two this is still in the
[25:32] exposition of the church ages did you
[25:33] get it now
[25:35] these are those twins again now we're
[25:37] going to talk about them today
[25:39] again and go through the bible just for
[25:41] a minute
[25:42] because remember the bible says
[25:44] according to election
[25:47] god cannot choose one over the other
[25:51] and be just he cannot say
[25:54] i'm just going to choose robert doherty
[25:58] and no one else nope
[26:03] we proved it last wednesday kane has the
[26:06] same opportunity you did
[26:10] same opportunity god said if you do well
[26:13] everybody's going oh cain's just the
[26:14] other devil and he's this
[26:16] no he had an opportunity
[26:20] by election to choose what god said
[26:23] and what do you do he voted some other
[26:25] way so that's where you get election
[26:27] from just like esau and jacob
[26:29] but you got to get into predestination
[26:31] with that which we will for just a
[26:32] minute i know we all
[26:34] know predestination here in this church
[26:36] has been preached
[26:38] correctly and the right way so we we
[26:40] should know that by foreknowledge
[26:42] god predestinates not that he'll put you
[26:44] in a tube and pull you through and say
[26:46] this is exactly the way you're going to
[26:47] be
[26:48] no god knew that's the way you'd be
[26:51] there are two
[26:51] trees again growing side by side in the
[26:54] same earth partaking of the same
[26:55] nourishment drinking in the same rain
[26:57] what is rain washing of the water of the
[26:58] word you can sit here today
[27:00] be just as lost as lost can be and still
[27:02] rejoice anybody can raise their hands
[27:06] anybody can think thank god for what
[27:08] they've done
[27:09] we hear presidents and vice presidents
[27:11] and we hear these
[27:12] people and and you know last night the
[27:14] other one
[27:15] made his speech and he brought god into
[27:17] it and they ain't a god none of them
[27:21] zero they're all of the devil
[27:24] amen i didn't get many amens on that
[27:28] amen they're both of the devil it's all
[27:31] of the devil
[27:32] if they're not born again they're lost
[27:36] and they're being influenced by that
[27:38] other spirit
[27:41] listen the spirit of god is not in the
[27:43] white house
[27:47] but see that you can quote god and
[27:49] everybody thinks oh
[27:51] he's a christian but they come from
[27:53] different seeds
[27:55] one tree is for the word of god exactly
[27:58] as god give it
[27:59] and loves and obeys it the other tree is
[28:02] from the seed that is anti the word
[28:05] of god and changes it now it doesn't do
[28:07] away with it
[28:08] he changes it remember what i said that
[28:11] what they did in isaiah they didn't do
[28:13] away with the word of god at the 300
[28:15] council at nicaea or at the 600 council
[28:17] of nicea they didn't
[28:19] throw the bible out but they brought in
[28:22] an
[28:22] idea from the other guy
[28:26] they were anointed by the other spirit
[28:29] to bring this false baptism of
[28:30] fatherless unholy ghost nowhere in the
[28:32] bible
[28:32] come from the pits of hell amen
[28:36] so there's your anti-word but you know
[28:39] what though
[28:39] they instituted it into the religions of
[28:43] the
[28:44] world and they live by it and god
[28:47] winked at their ignorance for a time
[28:50] but now's not the time we've been told
[28:53] right
[28:55] amen i don't want to be baptized in the
[28:57] name of father's own holy ghost that's
[28:58] titles
[29:03] thank god a prophet came by and said
[29:05] look even demons travel
[29:07] in the name of father son holy ghost oh
[29:09] my that hurts sometimes when you've been
[29:11] raised a different
[29:12] way but when you come into the family of
[29:14] god what is the name of the family of
[29:16] god
[29:17] jesus christ that's why peter on the day
[29:20] of pentecost said repent
[29:22] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[29:25] christ for the remission of your sins
[29:26] and you shall receive the gift of the
[29:28] holy ghost
[29:28] amen so they changed the word of god
[29:31] didn't do away with it
[29:32] satan smarter than that he knows not to
[29:35] do away with it
[29:36] he knows to just change it and twist it
[29:38] just a little bit all that's got to be
[29:40] in eternal hell because
[29:41] now how in the world can you have an
[29:43] eternal hell there's only one eternal
[29:44] life and that puts god in hell
[29:47] no hell is not eternal there's an
[29:49] eternal judgment
[29:51] that's where election comes from there's
[29:53] an eternal judgment
[29:55] but there's not an eternal hell
[29:59] change it where it wants to it
[30:01] substitutes its own creeds now he's
[30:03] talking about the creeds of the
[30:05] denominational world and even the creeds
[30:07] in this church if we have one anti-word
[30:11] it substitutes its own creation dogma
[30:12] for the living true word exactly as did
[30:15] cain who ended up killing abel but fear
[30:18] not little flock
[30:20] stay with the word keep that word
[30:22] between you and the devil eve did not do
[30:24] that and she failed
[30:26] and when the church lets down on the
[30:27] word she goes into the depths
[30:30] of the darkness of satan and remember we
[30:33] we read the scripture there in matthew
[30:35] we'll read it in a minute where
[30:36] jesus said if that light and you be
[30:38] darkness how great is your darkness
[30:40] so we looked at the law of reproduction
[30:42] we're just kind of skimmed through this
[30:43] the law of reproduction
[30:45] just for the for the new ones or
[30:47] somebody didn't listen to wednesday
[30:48] night the law we produce reproduction
[30:50] is what every seed will bring forth of
[30:53] its kind whatever seed is planted
[30:55] that's what it's going to bring i did
[30:57] not expect to plant tomato seed and get
[31:00] carrots no that seed will bring forth
[31:04] of the life that's in itself same way
[31:06] with you and i
[31:07] same way with satan he looked at what
[31:10] god said in the beginning because satan
[31:11] was there
[31:12] yes satan was right there in the
[31:14] beginning and god said let every seed
[31:15] bring forth of its kind satan said okay
[31:18] i can work with that because i'm going
[31:20] to cause this to happen with this and
[31:22] we're going to have god's going to have
[31:23] to give it life
[31:25] that's how satan injected himself into
[31:27] the human race
[31:28] through the beast and having an affair
[31:30] with eve and planting a natural seed but
[31:32] he had to plant a
[31:34] seed up here first a seed of doubt
[31:37] before the other seed could take a hold
[31:39] because look eve was deceived and not
[31:41] adam what is the
[31:42] word deceived means to cause to accept
[31:45] as true or valid what is false or
[31:47] invalid
[31:48] that's deception deception today
[31:52] is is believing you're right and you're
[31:55] wrong
[31:57] but that's what the devil wants you to
[31:58] do amen because matthew 6
[32:01] 22 says the light of the body is the eye
[32:03] if therefore thy eye be single thy whole
[32:05] body shall be full of light that's
[32:07] wonderful
[32:08] but if thine i be evil thy whole body
[32:11] shall be full of darkness
[32:13] if therefore the light that is in thee
[32:15] be darkness
[32:16] how great is that darkness because you
[32:18] are deceived into thinking that the
[32:20] light that you have
[32:22] is light but it's not
[32:25] that's why god had to send us a prophet
[32:27] in the end time
[32:28] to turn us back not to a different bible
[32:31] not to another god
[32:33] but back to the one true and living god
[32:36] back to the
[32:37] beginning where there was not a
[32:38] denomination there was not a
[32:40] an idea sure there was the antichrist
[32:42] spirit was there in paul's time grievous
[32:44] wolves he talks about john here in first
[32:45] john
[32:46] says there would be the spirit of
[32:48] antichrist would creep into the church
[32:51] but now we see that was in baby form and
[32:53] now we see it in
[32:54] what we see it in full grown form amen
[32:57] because this is the end time this is the
[32:59] last church age
[33:00] that we're dealing with and brother
[33:03] branham said this whole
[33:04] this whole place is was all dark and he
[33:07] said i added a little bit of light when
[33:09] uh when the
[33:10] angel drew the church ages across the
[33:12] across the wall in the back of the
[33:14] tabernacle he said i added a little bit
[33:15] of light why because that's me and you
[33:18] amen isn't that wonderful though that
[33:21] we had a prophet to do that he was
[33:23] pronouncing judgment on the world but he
[33:25] was pronouncing that me and you had a
[33:27] chance
[33:28] amen you and i have a chance to get out
[33:30] of here
[33:31] all right other than that we don't
[33:34] there's no denomination going to take us
[33:36] in a rapture
[33:39] what does it take to make a christian
[33:41] life number three we'll get right down
[33:42] here in just a second
[33:44] and start on the election what does it
[33:46] take to make a christian life
[33:48] now women must bring forth his germ of
[33:50] life her and man together by connection
[33:52] we won't go into that because you
[33:53] certainly disagree with me he's talking
[33:54] about what happened in the garden of
[33:55] eden it was not apples in the garden of
[33:57] eden we know that for a fact
[33:59] if you're a grown individual today if
[34:01] you don't know what's going on and
[34:02] what's
[34:02] your problem and my problem is then you
[34:04] got a problem you're deceived
[34:08] because i ate a couple of apples
[34:09] yesterday on my route and
[34:11] i'm fine i mean really that's silly you
[34:14] look
[34:14] the world goes no it was an apricot no
[34:16] it was
[34:18] creeds creeds
[34:21] they're dying by creeds
[34:25] she didn't eat an apple or a pomegranate
[34:30] she per took of what satan gave her
[34:33] and had a sexual affair with him with
[34:35] satan in the form of the beast
[34:37] and had a child cocaine the woman was
[34:39] actually the woman was actually deceived
[34:40] adam was not deceived he knowed what he
[34:42] was doing
[34:43] eve actually thought she was right she
[34:45] was getting some new light now that's
[34:46] what happened when we talked about nazi
[34:48] aroma
[34:49] when i see rome had their council they
[34:51] thought we don't want any more of that
[34:53] 300 year stuff that jesus taught and the
[34:56] disciples taught and most of them was
[34:58] already dead because it was 300 years
[35:00] after
[35:00] but they had there was the pr there was
[35:03] prophets and true people irenaeus
[35:05] martin you had all those that came up in
[35:07] that time that were true prophets of god
[35:09] that had the true word of god
[35:12] right but at nicaea satan walked in and
[35:14] says
[35:15] we're going to change things and that's
[35:18] what happened but see
[35:20] she the church thought she was getting
[35:22] some new light
[35:24] when the true light was already there
[35:27] and irenaeus and martin and the
[35:28] different ones
[35:30] the church age messengers of the day but
[35:33] look what the bible says he still
[35:35] or brother brown said he's still giving
[35:37] her new light
[35:40] stay with the bible that's it number
[35:42] four oneness
[35:43] see she was all ready to be mother and
[35:45] that never only what it did was clear up
[35:47] the thing of the serpent seed
[35:48] the seed that's in you now is by
[35:50] conception your unlawful act against my
[35:53] word
[35:54] because remember it wasn't supposed to
[35:55] be by sex it was supposed to be by
[35:56] spoken word of god amen
[35:59] the seed that's in you why you know why
[36:01] we know that
[36:03] go the book of luke go to book of
[36:06] matthew
[36:08] immaculate conception which is spoken
[36:12] word
[36:12] watch this the seed is in you now by
[36:14] conception your unawful act against my
[36:16] word
[36:17] with this thing here talking about the
[36:19] beast and you are now got the serpent
[36:21] seed but i'll give you a seed by
[36:23] immaculate conception
[36:24] and his seed shall bruise the serpent's
[36:26] head and his head shall bruise your heel
[36:28] the heel amen
[36:29] just let god have it if it's his word
[36:31] he'll bring it to pass
[36:33] just let him have it so now we come to
[36:35] genesis 4 1 and we're just going to
[36:37] shoot through it real quick
[36:39] and start here with with election i just
[36:42] left it blank because
[36:44] we're going to uh read just a minute in
[36:46] chapter
[36:47] four we know that the prophet of god
[36:51] that the lord sent us in the end time
[36:53] that the book
[36:55] according to the bible in revelations 5
[36:58] that book that was handed to the one on
[37:00] the throne
[37:01] was closed
[37:06] and and then there came a cry thou art
[37:09] worthy
[37:10] to open the book
[37:14] because in revelations 10 1 through 7
[37:17] you see a mighty angel coming down from
[37:19] heaven now something happened from
[37:20] revelation
[37:21] 5 to revelations 10 now this mighty
[37:24] angel comes down and the book is open
[37:27] amen and then john being top of the
[37:30] bride he says give me that book which
[37:32] that book was open
[37:34] so you and i are living now under an
[37:36] open book we're not living under a creed
[37:38] or a denominational book
[37:41] or any kind of eyes of that i was
[37:43] thinking yesterday
[37:47] sometimes that gets me in trouble but
[37:50] yesterday i was thinking i thought lord
[37:52] i was reading paul where paul would
[37:54] stand up and paul
[37:56] and even stephen man if you read that
[37:59] sermon stephen preaches to him
[38:01] and makes them so mad they stone him and
[38:03] kill him but he took them all the way
[38:06] from the foundation of the world he took
[38:07] them from abraham
[38:09] amen told them exactly what the torah
[38:12] said
[38:12] exactly what moses did exactly how many
[38:15] years they had been kept
[38:17] he preached them a perfect word
[38:21] right down to jesus he's but see that's
[38:23] the problem
[38:24] that's when he got personal that's when
[38:25] i believe he pointed to him sanhedrin he
[38:27] said
[38:28] that jesus whom you crucified but see
[38:31] that
[38:32] was a true message there was no faults
[38:34] in it at all
[38:36] listen don't worry folks if you got the
[38:39] word of god and it's a true word of god
[38:42] that's what i say about you say well
[38:44] y'all think y'all true and
[38:46] somebody's got to be true
[38:49] there's got to be a holy ghost that got
[38:52] into stephen the bible said full of the
[38:54] holy ghost
[38:55] and he preached that sermon all the way
[38:59] they killed him for it then you got paul
[39:02] paul
[39:03] gets up to agrippa he starts over there
[39:05] at the
[39:06] road to damascus and agrippa remember i
[39:09] think he's part jew
[39:10] right remember he's kind of got a little
[39:12] dealings with the jew so he's listening
[39:14] to what paul said
[39:15] he knows paul at one time hated the
[39:18] christians
[39:18] and now he's preaching him a sermon
[39:20] walks him right down through his life
[39:24] and he comes to jesus christ and he does
[39:26] the same thing and you know what what
[39:27] did agrippa say he said oh paul
[39:29] he said man that's the best sermon i've
[39:31] heard in a long time he said you almost
[39:33] make me want to be converted
[39:37] but that's a true you got to know
[39:40] whether it's true or not you got to know
[39:42] whether what you're listening to is true
[39:44] that's right that's just my thought i'm
[39:47] telling you there's
[39:48] there's there's if stephen can keep it
[39:50] in line
[39:51] by the holy ghost paul can keep it in
[39:53] line by the holy ghost
[39:54] listen paul was so anointed to we quote
[39:57] him as being what god said
[40:02] eighty percent of the new testament was
[40:03] written by the apostle paul
[40:05] and god thought so much of it it was so
[40:07] perfect because remember what this word
[40:08] is perfect
[40:10] so what he done and what he wrote and
[40:12] what luke wrote and what
[40:14] peter wrote what john wrote
[40:17] was perfect because they were led by the
[40:20] holy ghost
[40:21] if we're led by the holy ghost and
[40:22] that's exactly the same result you and i
[40:25] are going to get
[40:26] amen so genesis 4 we see that
[40:29] now we look under this open book and we
[40:31] see that the seals are open we can see
[40:34] that god in verse 5 it says
[40:37] cain his offering was not respected in
[40:39] other words god said
[40:41] cain why are you wroth and why is your
[40:42] countenance falling if thou do us well
[40:45] i knew they'd probably pick it up if
[40:47] thou do us well
[40:49] come on out right down here genesis 4 7.
[40:52] if thou doest well there's grace
[40:55] god extended grace and said cain
[40:59] wade
[41:02] put your name in there if you do well
[41:07] yes you can receive eternal life
[41:10] not talking to me now not him talking to
[41:13] me you can receive eternal life
[41:15] if thou doest well shalt thou not be
[41:17] accepted accepted by who
[41:19] god not by the world that's right
[41:23] not by your neighbor but by god
[41:27] direct he's talking straight to god
[41:31] amen if thou doest not well
[41:34] here's the election send lives at the
[41:37] door
[41:40] look and in other words watch it it's
[41:42] going to consume you
[41:44] cain unto thee shall be his desire what
[41:47] who sin
[41:48] and thou shalt rule over him in other
[41:49] words sin will take you
[41:51] over but now watch cain rejected that
[41:57] we know that because he didn't do any
[42:00] different
[42:01] that's right kept going with the way he
[42:03] was going
[42:04] and cain talked with abel his brother
[42:05] and it came to pass that they were in
[42:06] the field cain rose up and
[42:09] killed abel why did he kill abel not
[42:11] because he didn't like him not because
[42:12] he killed him because of what he said he
[42:14] killed him because he was jealous just
[42:16] like satan was jealous of lucifer
[42:19] and got all mad and ill and said all
[42:21] right i'm going to earth and i'm going
[42:23] to just
[42:24] mess this whole thing up watch what he
[42:26] did he came down got into kane got into
[42:28] all these different ones
[42:29] but now remember truly remember this
[42:32] we are not talking about two natural
[42:35] seed lines because
[42:36] abel was just as messed up as cain
[42:40] oh by the way yeah why do you need a
[42:43] sacrifice
[42:45] that's right why'd abel need a sacrifice
[42:47] if he was so and we know the bible says
[42:49] righteous abel
[42:50] why because god saw his righteousness
[42:52] because he didn't make a sacrifice
[42:54] amen cain would have been righteous it
[42:56] would have it would have recorded that
[42:58] but remember by election by
[43:00] foreknowledge god knew cain could live
[43:03] for a million years and still never come
[43:05] to the same place abel came
[43:07] with that revelation that's right this
[43:09] is the way we got to see election
[43:10] or you or you'll go wrong every time
[43:13] so in other words he killed him for his
[43:15] doctrine well there's your we were
[43:16] talking about the four horse riders
[43:18] which is what
[43:19] the first one is what white righteous
[43:21] church cain thought he's right
[43:22] the righteous indignation cain had was
[43:25] as he thought god should have accepted
[43:26] his sacrifice
[43:28] god should have accepted his sermon god
[43:30] should have accepted his denomination
[43:33] god should have accepted his idea
[43:36] amen but he didn't
[43:42] and then what happened he was cursed
[43:46] but just go through it real quick that
[43:48] white righteous church was the same
[43:50] thing
[43:51] in the beginning see that white
[43:52] righteous church thought it was right
[43:54] there was this white righteous church on
[43:56] the earth
[43:58] but there was also a false that came in
[44:01] into nicaea and what under the
[44:05] umbrella of religion
[44:08] not under the umbrella of something else
[44:10] it was an umbrella of religion they came
[44:12] together
[44:14] so there's your white horse
[44:17] then the red horse what do you do he got
[44:19] on his red horse and what'd the red do
[44:21] he killed abel because of his doctrine
[44:24] that's what they did in the
[44:26] in the middle ages they killed c right
[44:28] here if you see the pattern
[44:29] first three ages is the first horse
[44:31] rider second horse rider
[44:33] third horse rider fourth horse rider
[44:34] everybody got that you've been through
[44:36] this a hundred times you ought to say
[44:37] amen
[44:38] those of you that are awake you're going
[44:41] to nod in a minute
[44:42] and we're going to get cain into nods
[44:43] though all right so you got the
[44:46] but also you got the line ops man and
[44:48] eagle so you got
[44:50] the white horse rider now what was a red
[44:52] horse rider right here they killed 68
[44:54] million
[44:55] they killed 68 million protestants
[44:58] because of their religions that sound
[45:00] familiar
[45:01] that's what came to table
[45:05] and then you see the black horse rider
[45:07] which what comes to a place that black
[45:10] horse rider
[45:11] it's the what intelligence of man are
[45:14] lutheran wesley's age
[45:16] ages and same way with
[45:21] with cain he's like my punishment is
[45:23] greater than i can bear
[45:24] a ah thou has driven me out i'll be a
[45:28] fugitive oh woe is me
[45:32] lord said now ar thou curse from the
[45:34] earth
[45:36] black horse and then what happened
[45:37] remember at the very end let's look at
[45:39] verse 16.
[45:42] this is where cain didn't naturally die
[45:44] cain spiritually died
[45:45] cain that's where you come to that place
[45:48] to where you pull that ballot box
[45:51] and you've marked which one you want to
[45:53] go and you mark it
[45:56] can't take it back anymore cain went out
[46:00] from the presence of the lord
[46:04] and we see what happened from then on
[46:08] he had a he did have a natural line
[46:11] have y'all noticed though that in the
[46:12] bible just for a little just for a
[46:14] little tidbit
[46:16] have you read in the bible how that cain
[46:20] had this had these children
[46:23] and then seth comes up and seth has
[46:25] children and they basically name them
[46:27] the same
[46:31] oh look kane and she conceived and bear
[46:35] enoch that ain't enoch
[46:38] that lived and got carried up in a you
[46:41] know in a rapture
[46:43] that's another enoch you see how close
[46:45] satan is he
[46:46] you watch it and i'm not going to read
[46:48] it but you keep going down through there
[46:50] and you'll see that satan names his
[46:53] group
[46:53] the same as god names his group almost
[46:56] you know why cuz so close
[46:59] so close it deceived the very elect if
[47:01] it were possible
[47:02] the very elect if it were possible and
[47:06] that's what we're going to talk about
[47:07] here in just a second
[47:08] all right so now let us go
[47:12] so we know that the four horse riders
[47:15] rode through there in genesis
[47:17] showing them cain and abel and then they
[47:19] didn't quit
[47:21] they just kept on going listen
[47:25] ishmael thought he was right
[47:29] balaam thought he was right
[47:33] aham thought he was right they all
[47:36] thought they were right they never got
[47:37] up one morning and said i'm wrong
[47:40] but now you know a true believer can do
[47:42] that though a true believer can get up
[47:44] and
[47:45] and and be presented with the truth and
[47:47] say i'm wrong
[47:49] but see the devil will never do that
[47:51] they will never do that all right so you
[47:53] ready let's go now look
[47:55] talk about election election
[48:00] is what let's read
[48:04] romans 9 verse 10 we won't be very long
[48:07] told you romans 9 verse 10. now remember
[48:12] we see that god by foreknowledge knew
[48:15] all this was going to happen
[48:18] he knew who would choose and who would
[48:21] not choose not that he chose
[48:25] god said i wish did everybody be saved
[48:28] right
[48:28] that was his desire as a god as a good
[48:30] god he wants everybody to be saved
[48:35] he's not a sadist or or anything like
[48:37] that he's
[48:38] he wants and you know what he's a liar
[48:41] if he didn't
[48:43] take god at his word folks he said
[48:47] i would that all be saved so god would
[48:49] that
[48:50] everybody be saved but listen according
[48:52] to for knowledge
[48:53] he knew they would not that's right all
[48:55] right and so that election might
[48:58] stand let's talk about that for a minute
[49:01] not only this
[49:03] but when rebecca also had conceived by
[49:05] one even by our father
[49:07] isaac now we're going to talk about this
[49:10] just for a second and then i'm going to
[49:11] swap back to something we're going to
[49:13] we're going to look at the seed lines
[49:14] and then go back to where we were all
[49:16] right
[49:17] because remember since cain and abel
[49:21] came on this earth they came by sexual
[49:23] desire
[49:25] no one else except jesus christ has come
[49:28] any other way
[49:29] no one prophet priest king you
[49:32] me william branham doesn't matter all
[49:35] but jesus christ he had to come
[49:37] immaculate conception to prove
[49:40] that that was what was supposed to
[49:41] happen in the garden amen
[49:44] he came by immaculate conception to
[49:47] clean the womb of the mind and then
[49:49] clean the natural womb and he had to
[49:52] come as a baby because he had to come
[49:54] like me and you
[49:55] he couldn't come like adam adam became a
[49:56] full-grown man
[49:58] but you and i have never been come out
[50:00] of a womb full-grown person
[50:02] some of you kids may think you are
[50:05] surprised
[50:09] and not only this but when rebecca also
[50:11] had conceived by one even by her father
[50:13] isaac
[50:15] for the child being not yet born look
[50:19] neither have i done any good listen
[50:20] before there was ever a conception
[50:26] listen folks before there was ever one
[50:29] literal
[50:30] conception which would be satan and eve
[50:34] god knew what was going to happen and he
[50:36] knew as much then as he knows now
[50:39] and he knew where you would come from
[50:41] and where all of us would come from
[50:43] so no surprises to god amen no surprises
[50:46] to god
[50:46] for the chil but listen by for knowledge
[50:49] he knew what you'd do when you got here
[50:53] and not that he would make you do
[50:55] something
[50:57] for the child being not yet born neither
[50:58] having done any good or evil
[51:01] now if you look at this and you let that
[51:05] stand alone
[51:07] you can see where that there is a
[51:09] predestination
[51:11] doctrine that is predetermined it
[51:13] doesn't matter
[51:14] it's stamped and you can't do anything
[51:17] different
[51:18] if you look at this because you would
[51:20] see that god always
[51:21] already got this thing fixed up for us
[51:23] but no he don't have this thing fixed
[51:26] by predestination he has it fixed up by
[51:28] four knowledge
[51:29] knowing what you would do knowledge
[51:31] beforehand that means
[51:33] that would be for all right
[51:38] because remember predestined
[51:41] predetermined
[51:43] means there is a predetermined destiny
[51:47] and it is a string because god knows
[51:49] what you're going to do before you get
[51:50] here
[51:52] but he only knows that by foreign
[51:53] knowledge
[51:55] in other words his plan and purpose is
[51:56] not just that this is the way it's going
[51:58] to be
[51:59] no we saw that's the way it was going to
[52:00] be well it's just to me
[52:03] it's the simplest thing but can be so
[52:06] convoluted until people say well i i'm
[52:10] just
[52:10] if my kids are predestinated they're
[52:13] just if they're
[52:14] if they're going to be um christians
[52:17] they'll be christians if they're gonna
[52:18] be lost they're gonna be lost you know
[52:19] what
[52:20] only god knows that
[52:24] and you know what i don't know enough
[52:27] and i'm just dumb enough to believe
[52:31] that my kids are going to get saved yes
[52:34] and that god saw that but now what did
[52:36] god do he saw
[52:37] some old grandma brother branham said
[52:40] four generations you never knew got down
[52:43] on her hands and knees and said god
[52:46] save my family
[52:49] there's election she voted for you
[52:52] before you even got here
[52:55] but what was that she was crying out to
[52:57] god and she believed that god would do
[52:59] that
[53:00] yes same way with you and i don't ever
[53:03] quit believing
[53:05] you say oh no see here you go my works
[53:11] look not of works
[53:17] of works
[53:20] but you show your faith
[53:25] by your work can't do away with works
[53:29] can't do away with works but works is
[53:32] not just
[53:32] it because remember those that come to
[53:34] jesus at the end time at the white
[53:36] throne judgment are going to say have i
[53:38] not work work work work
[53:42] work myself to death for you lord he
[53:43] said depart from me i never knew you
[53:46] you never had me inside your soul you
[53:48] never let me in the womb of your mind
[53:50] that let it drop down to the womb of
[53:52] your soul
[53:54] i'm not gonna hit you i know you're
[53:56] sitting there
[53:57] you're just kind of tall i usually can
[53:59] reach over
[54:00] you're taller than most sitting down
[54:04] for the children being not yet born
[54:06] neither having done any good or evil let
[54:08] the purpose of god look according to
[54:10] election now what is the election we
[54:14] just went through one
[54:15] it's a vote that's right
[54:20] to me it's as simple as an election is a
[54:23] vote
[54:24] yes according to election might what
[54:29] stand not of works
[54:33] but look but of him that calleth so
[54:35] that's what he's calling
[54:37] right coming to me all year labor and
[54:40] heavy laden
[54:41] i don't care if you were drunk i don't
[54:42] care if you were prostitute i don't care
[54:44] if you
[54:44] i don't god doesn't care about those
[54:46] things
[54:50] look at rahab look at all the people
[54:52] look at all the
[54:54] ones that we think there's no way if we
[54:57] you know i'm
[54:58] somebody said one time said if i was god
[54:59] i wouldn't put up with that well i thank
[55:01] god you're not god
[55:04] because he put up with that all the way
[55:05] down through there and by election and
[55:08] by foreknowledge and by the
[55:09] predestination of god
[55:11] he saw a rahab he saw this one he saw
[55:13] that one and right out of rahab
[55:15] comes david wow
[55:19] so don't talk to me about no natural
[55:22] seed line that's good
[55:25] and a seed line that's bad and there's
[55:28] no way to cross them
[55:31] come on i'm gonna read you right here in
[55:33] just a minute what happened
[55:36] now we know listen we know for a fact
[55:39] standing in the garden of eden
[55:40] there was only four people at the time
[55:44] adam eve cain abel all right
[55:48] and cain was the seed of the
[55:51] beast seed of the so he had a natural
[55:53] seed line
[55:54] he had a dna that was like his father
[55:58] the beast and then when adam and eve got
[56:00] together and had
[56:02] abel there's your twins again got had
[56:05] abel
[56:06] that was adam's natural seed and he
[56:07] looked like adam
[56:10] so now when you start at the beginning
[56:11] there is two natural
[56:13] seed lines but you got to look at those
[56:16] and see though that
[56:17] cain and abel abel wasn't righteous
[56:20] because he was on this side
[56:24] and cain wasn't doomed because he was on
[56:26] this side
[56:27] i just showed you god came to this side
[56:31] and said if you'll do as well as this
[56:33] one does
[56:35] and he's not talking about abel he said
[56:37] if thou do us well
[56:39] well means if you'll do what i said then
[56:42] what
[56:43] then you can come over here yes
[56:46] but there was true a natural seed line
[56:48] but i'm gonna tell you we're gonna get
[56:49] down here in just a few minutes
[56:51] and you can't find that thing
[56:55] you can't find the natural seed line
[56:57] you're going to have to look at the
[56:58] spiritual seed line
[57:01] because when cain turned god down and
[57:02] went out of the presence of god that did
[57:04] create
[57:05] also a seed in the womb of
[57:08] cain's mind because watch his people his
[57:11] people were
[57:12] um they built cities see the attitudes
[57:16] and all they had
[57:16] and then able side with seth were sheep
[57:18] herders and all these different things
[57:20] we'll read it just a second
[57:21] but according to election not of works
[57:23] but of him that calleth
[57:24] it was said unto her the elder shall
[57:26] serve the younger as
[57:27] it is written jacob have i loved
[57:32] but esau have i hated now
[57:35] if he hated esau
[57:38] just by purely hating
[57:41] hating him he's wrong
[57:44] he cannot be a righteous judge if he
[57:46] hates somebody before he gives them a
[57:48] chance to even breathe
[57:50] so we must go back to foreknowledge for
[57:54] knowing that
[57:54] jacob would love the birthright and that
[57:57] esau would not
[58:01] there's where it split there's your
[58:04] split jacob have i loved and he saw have
[58:05] i hated
[58:06] all right now romans 8 verse 30.
[58:10] that's where we get in for whom he did
[58:12] for no
[58:13] he also did predestinate what is first
[58:17] for knowledge then at for
[58:20] knowledge you can predetermine
[58:24] by your free moral agency
[58:28] you will determine god's just going to
[58:30] let you go
[58:32] sure now god influences we know god will
[58:34] nudge you over this way or nudge you
[58:35] over this way but so will the devil
[58:38] amen you got two shoulders right one for
[58:41] the devil and one for god
[58:43] and your brain's right in the middle
[58:46] right
[58:46] but remember what satan does is right
[58:48] here if you're born again he can't get
[58:50] right here amen this has to come up
[58:53] and you know what god knows that so by
[58:55] foreign knowledge he knew you would
[58:57] accept him and he knew exactly what you
[58:58] would need
[58:59] to bring that thing up called the holy
[59:02] ghost the guide
[59:03] called the one that when you have this
[59:05] little check in your heart
[59:07] right i didn't have that when i was a
[59:10] center i never was checked nothing i
[59:11] just went and did what i wanted to
[59:14] can i get some one person or two to
[59:15] raise their hand i did what i wanted to
[59:20] i did what i wanted to but when god came
[59:23] knocking up here
[59:24] he said boy
[59:28] you need to stop what you're doing
[59:32] and i said father god right here save my
[59:34] soul
[59:36] forgive me of what i've done yes
[59:39] and you know what that laundry list that
[59:41] i had sure satan keeps pulling it up in
[59:43] my mind
[59:44] amen every day and reminds me of what i
[59:47] used to be
[59:49] god don't know that because by foreign
[59:51] knowledge
[59:54] by foreknowledge he has wiped his mind
[59:58] of what you did because he can't
[1:00:01] predetermine
[1:00:03] by your sin
[1:00:07] that's fresh i didn't even think of that
[1:00:10] but he can't predetermined by your sin
[1:00:12] if you're a child of god
[1:00:13] if he saw you come to being a child a
[1:00:16] son and daughter of god
[1:00:17] he came predetermined by the laundry
[1:00:19] list
[1:00:20] that i keep talking about you know well
[1:00:23] i it's like daddy said daddy never drank
[1:00:25] he never smoked you never cussed
[1:00:28] but he was lost yes
[1:00:32] but you and i go well i drank i smoked i
[1:00:35] run around i did all that i did i did i
[1:00:37] but boy i'm a better christian than he
[1:00:39] is no
[1:00:40] using worse shape than he was because he
[1:00:42] thought he's right
[1:00:46] better than most because i don't do
[1:00:49] those things
[1:00:51] no you were born in sin
[1:00:55] shaping iniquity come to this world
[1:00:58] lost doomed and on your way to hell your
[1:01:02] soul is as black as night
[1:01:04] sorry everybody even the prophet of god
[1:01:09] had to come to a day to ask
[1:01:10] god to forgive him don't you remember
[1:01:12] the time that brother brown said i used
[1:01:14] to wash my car on sunday and watch
[1:01:15] people go to church
[1:01:20] that's right because you didn't have god
[1:01:22] in here but once he had that experience
[1:01:24] it took that same person and he
[1:01:26] put him in church for whom he did for no
[1:01:29] he did also predestinate
[1:01:31] to be what conformed to the image of his
[1:01:33] son
[1:01:34] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:01:36] many brethren
[1:01:38] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:01:40] he also
[1:01:41] called now he called everybody
[1:01:48] there listen god can't be a just god and
[1:01:50] one person of the
[1:01:52] billions it's been since the beginning
[1:01:53] of time of the billions
[1:01:55] can walk up one day and say god you
[1:01:57] never gave me a chance
[1:01:59] then he's gonna have to just wipe the
[1:02:01] whole thing out and give everybody
[1:02:03] eternal life but you know what he's
[1:02:04] gonna do he's gonna say okay buddy
[1:02:06] on december the 15th at four o'clock in
[1:02:08] the afternoon i came to you three times
[1:02:10] and you turned me down all three times
[1:02:12] you know what that person's gonna do
[1:02:14] in their mind they're gonna go yep
[1:02:21] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:02:22] he also calls so he calls everybody
[1:02:25] but he only predetermines he
[1:02:27] predetermines by what his foreknowledge
[1:02:29] so he knew what you would do when you at
[1:02:31] when
[1:02:31] when he called you he knew what you
[1:02:33] would respond
[1:02:35] because in whom he called then he also
[1:02:38] justified
[1:02:39] now look without foreknowledge he cannot
[1:02:42] do this last part of this
[1:02:44] of this uh quote or last part of the
[1:02:46] scripture
[1:02:48] without foreknowledge because look
[1:02:50] there's a lot of people have come to
[1:02:51] justification
[1:02:53] that will not come to glorification
[1:02:56] bible says believe on the lord jesus
[1:02:57] christ and thou shalt be saved he'll
[1:02:58] forgive you your sins that justifies you
[1:03:00] but it don't take it don't take the
[1:03:02] unclean spirit out
[1:03:04] he's still in there and you'll go on and
[1:03:06] continue to keep doing that until god
[1:03:08] flushes that thing out oh yeah right and
[1:03:11] whom he justified
[1:03:12] them he also glorified so there is a
[1:03:15] group of people that looks like on this
[1:03:17] side
[1:03:18] that there's a seed line that just
[1:03:21] there's no way you cannot make it
[1:03:24] and there is if he saw
[1:03:27] you before the foundation of the world
[1:03:29] want it more than life itself
[1:03:32] he gave you like i said before that's
[1:03:34] what i'm coming to he gave you a paul
[1:03:36] he gave you a john he gave you a
[1:03:39] irenaeus mart he gave you william
[1:03:41] branham he gave you samuel dale he gave
[1:03:43] you luis urego he gave you aaron roberts
[1:03:45] he gave you all these different brothers
[1:03:47] a priest by black he gave you that
[1:03:49] yes right amen to bring you to
[1:03:51] perfection
[1:03:55] because he's not gonna lose a one he
[1:03:57] said not one
[1:03:59] why because of foreign knowledge he knew
[1:04:01] you would want it more in life itself
[1:04:03] or that you wouldn't both ways
[1:04:07] or that you would not
[1:04:11] but now let's not think we're so
[1:04:13] righteous
[1:04:16] that we're on this side over here
[1:04:19] and we can't be moved
[1:04:23] now let's let god handle that
[1:04:26] it's god's grace folks because sometimes
[1:04:29] we might lean a little bit over here on
[1:04:31] this side
[1:04:31] you heard what i said we fall we stumble
[1:04:35] we make mistakes
[1:04:38] but god give us what a type host right
[1:04:40] here
[1:04:42] to say god forgive me lord forgive me of
[1:04:45] what i've done
[1:04:46] why because we still are human but let's
[1:04:48] go to genesis 6 verse 1. let's
[1:04:50] let we do there is no doubt
[1:04:53] a line that's called bride
[1:04:57] but it is never a natural line
[1:05:01] it is a spiritual line because when
[1:05:04] jesus came to nicodemus and said you
[1:05:06] must be born again nicodemus he went
[1:05:08] back to the natural line
[1:05:10] he said i got to go back and get in my
[1:05:11] mother's womb in other words have
[1:05:13] another conception
[1:05:15] from my mom and my daddy so that i could
[1:05:18] be right jesus said no you've got to be
[1:05:19] born from above
[1:05:22] this down here is what's killing you
[1:05:26] so let's look and see just for a minute
[1:05:30] genesis 6 verse 1. now remember there
[1:05:32] was two natural lines of cain and abel
[1:05:35] well not sorry cain is seth abel didn't
[1:05:38] have a line
[1:05:39] abel died before he had children so it
[1:05:41] had to be seth
[1:05:42] everybody got that say amen all right
[1:05:45] not able but seth
[1:05:46] because remember seth was raised up by
[1:05:49] still a conception between
[1:05:50] adam and eve after all that they had
[1:05:53] another kid
[1:05:55] but then they started calling on the
[1:05:57] name of the lord and there was a natural
[1:05:58] for a little while
[1:06:00] but in genesis 6 verse 1 and it came to
[1:06:02] pass when men
[1:06:03] began to multiply on the face of the
[1:06:05] earth and daughters were born unto them
[1:06:07] that the sons of god saw the daughters
[1:06:09] of men that they were
[1:06:10] fair and they took them wives now watch
[1:06:13] of
[1:06:14] all which they chose
[1:06:17] which they chose so there's your
[1:06:19] intermingling of the seed natural
[1:06:22] seed so there's no way from this point
[1:06:28] from this point on you're gonna have a
[1:06:30] hard time finding the natural
[1:06:32] seed line and it's gonna get even worse
[1:06:34] when we read the next scripture
[1:06:36] when noah gets out of the ark
[1:06:40] and the lord said my spirit shall not
[1:06:43] always strive with men
[1:06:44] for he is also flesh yet his days shall
[1:06:47] be 120 years
[1:06:48] there were giants in the earth in those
[1:06:49] days now we know that came from cain we
[1:06:51] know that
[1:06:52] and also after that when the sons of god
[1:06:54] came in and to the daughters of men
[1:06:56] all of them mingled and they bare white
[1:06:59] children to them there's your next
[1:07:01] generation of children
[1:07:03] natural the same became mighty men which
[1:07:07] were of old
[1:07:09] men of renown and you see all this
[1:07:13] nimrod and you see all these dif
[1:07:14] you see everything mingling back in
[1:07:17] together so forget about
[1:07:19] if you're on the cane lynn is your oak
[1:07:20] your serpent's saying if you're on
[1:07:23] able or south side you're you're fine no
[1:07:26] because remember we've got to go back to
[1:07:28] election the bible says according to
[1:07:30] election
[1:07:31] yes we'll look at that in just a second
[1:07:34] so now let's go to genesis 9 verse 1.
[1:07:38] they've got out of the ark now there's
[1:07:41] only noah
[1:07:43] his wife the three boys and the three
[1:07:46] girls
[1:07:47] which was the wives of of the the boys
[1:07:50] right they're about ham sham and j-path
[1:07:51] they did have all wives
[1:07:53] and god told them be fruitful and
[1:07:54] multiply and replenish the earth well
[1:07:56] here they go again
[1:07:57] and they're marrying intermingly
[1:07:59] marrying with their family
[1:08:04] where's the seedline at
[1:08:08] it becomes spiritual now because watch
[1:08:11] we know one thing's for sure ham
[1:08:15] did wrong whatever he did we've heard
[1:08:18] different stories on that but he just
[1:08:20] he just turned god down while the other
[1:08:24] ones
[1:08:24] went on the sons of noah that went forth
[1:08:26] of the ark were sham
[1:08:28] ham and japath and ham as the father of
[1:08:30] canaan see that's what gets me is ham as
[1:08:32] the father of canaan and canaan is the
[1:08:34] promised land
[1:08:36] you see how god is just when he wrote
[1:08:38] the bible he just throwed it in there to
[1:08:39] where
[1:08:40] you can't figure out without the holy
[1:08:42] ghost you can't figure out what god's
[1:08:43] doing
[1:08:45] these are the three sons of noah and of
[1:08:47] them was the whole
[1:08:49] earth over spread so out of three sons
[1:08:52] and three daughter-in-laws no one ever
[1:08:54] had any more kids out of three sons and
[1:08:56] three daughter-in-laws
[1:08:57] they repopulated what you see today so
[1:09:00] there's no way god hid that thing
[1:09:02] so deep now we know that brother brown
[1:09:05] they asked him a question about the
[1:09:06] serpent seed
[1:09:07] well we know what happened with the
[1:09:08] serpent seed it came over in the ark in
[1:09:10] the men and the women because they went
[1:09:11] back to doing what happened before
[1:09:14] they went back multiplying and
[1:09:15] replenishing and intermarrying and
[1:09:18] intermingling
[1:09:20] amen kind of simple
[1:09:25] let's look at this right here let's look
[1:09:28] at the countdown
[1:09:31] let's see how simple brother brown makes
[1:09:33] this
[1:09:35] now we're talking about the election
[1:09:39] how would god act when he come into
[1:09:41] human flesh look and he
[1:09:43] what he was when he was in human flesh
[1:09:45] what did he brag about being it no sir
[1:09:48] he said i do nothing until my i see my
[1:09:50] father show it to me first
[1:09:53] look how he proved himself how his a
[1:09:57] vindication of being the messiah
[1:09:59] he was a prophet he knew he could tell
[1:10:01] the people he perceived their thoughts
[1:10:03] he knowed their hearts
[1:10:04] he knowed all about you he knows
[1:10:08] what you've done and he knows what you
[1:10:11] need
[1:10:12] he can speak to you through your
[1:10:14] conscience tell you
[1:10:16] try to show it to you now look the devil
[1:10:19] will sit on the other shoulder and say
[1:10:21] look the other way
[1:10:22] depends on which way you want to look
[1:10:25] now
[1:10:26] throws it every bit back to you that's
[1:10:29] all
[1:10:30] look they said in the election god voted
[1:10:33] for you
[1:10:34] and the devil voted against you now
[1:10:37] that's 1-1
[1:10:39] god voted for you the devil voted
[1:10:41] against you
[1:10:42] now there's a vote swinger in there
[1:10:44] somewhere it's got to be two to one one
[1:10:46] side or the other
[1:10:48] and who swings the vote now where you
[1:10:51] cast your vote is going to determine
[1:10:54] where you're going
[1:10:56] that's right you've got to take christ
[1:10:58] you've got to take his word
[1:11:01] you've got to believe him and the bible
[1:11:03] said he was the same yesterday and then
[1:11:05] forever then he's got to be the same
[1:11:06] exactly
[1:11:08] now do you believe that raise up your
[1:11:10] hand because we're going to vote
[1:11:11] today raise up your hand how many would
[1:11:15] want to be an astronaut of god he's
[1:11:17] talking about countdown
[1:11:18] they said i can stay away from
[1:11:19] organizations and believe in christ now
[1:11:22] let's go to
[1:11:23] a trumpet gives an uncertain sound 1963.
[1:11:26] someone said to me the other day
[1:11:27] are you going to vote this election he
[1:11:29] said i done voted
[1:11:32] oh in this election i said i voted for
[1:11:35] jesus
[1:11:36] i said i'll tell you there was two
[1:11:37] people voting for me
[1:11:39] i said god voted for me the devil voted
[1:11:41] against me
[1:11:42] and i voted for god so i got my vote
[1:11:45] right
[1:11:47] depends on where you cast your vote how
[1:11:50] are you going to come out
[1:11:52] now by foreknowledge he knew that
[1:11:55] not by predetermining by foreknowledge
[1:11:58] he knew
[1:11:59] that you would want it more than life
[1:12:01] itself
[1:12:02] amen then we took them then he talked
[1:12:05] about the national
[1:12:06] natural election which we just went
[1:12:08] through and it happened the same way you
[1:12:10] you get to so many votes over here and
[1:12:12] you get so many votes over here of
[1:12:13] course we got electoral college where
[1:12:14] you got all that stuff
[1:12:15] and yada yada but listen i only care
[1:12:18] about what god voted
[1:12:21] for me and satan voted against me
[1:12:25] there's your two seed lines but you got
[1:12:28] to decide whether you want to be part of
[1:12:30] this one
[1:12:31] or you want to stay by your natural seed
[1:12:34] and stay over here on this one with
[1:12:36] satan amen
[1:12:38] you determine everything you do
[1:12:42] even in life
[1:12:45] even in little simple life but do we ask
[1:12:48] god
[1:12:50] to help us with that all right let's go
[1:12:54] to galatians 3 16 because we've we've
[1:12:57] we want to see just a few of these
[1:12:58] people here and then we'll then we'll
[1:13:00] quit
[1:13:01] now to abraham and his seed were the
[1:13:02] promises made seed
[1:13:05] because remember abraham had ishmael
[1:13:11] natural seed and he had natural seed
[1:13:14] isaac
[1:13:16] and then sarah died
[1:13:19] he married keturah and had seven more
[1:13:21] natural children
[1:13:23] right nobody got that so god wasn't
[1:13:26] coming to abraham and saying
[1:13:28] all these seeds well no he's talking
[1:13:30] about one
[1:13:32] that's the only seed i'm worried about
[1:13:34] the only seed that i want representing
[1:13:36] me and to be inside of me is this one
[1:13:38] right here
[1:13:39] and to see he saith not into seeds as of
[1:13:43] many
[1:13:45] because these are examples
[1:13:49] it's not a see i switch this one up
[1:13:52] so it'll confuse you because i put all
[1:13:54] the good people on this side and all the
[1:13:55] bad people on that side
[1:13:57] see what i mean it's not that it could
[1:13:59] have went either way
[1:14:01] because of election god voted and i saw
[1:14:04] what isaac would do and what ishmael
[1:14:05] would do he saw what jacob was doing
[1:14:07] what he saw and do he saw what moses and
[1:14:08] balaam would do
[1:14:09] he saw what elijah and ahab would do
[1:14:12] because he's talking about the twins
[1:14:13] showing up at every revival
[1:14:15] right and he says as not to cease as of
[1:14:17] many
[1:14:18] but as a one now remember
[1:14:22] christ never had natural
[1:14:25] children jesus christ never had a
[1:14:29] natural child
[1:14:30] so he come knowing that he could though
[1:14:33] he was a human mortal man from top of
[1:14:35] his head to the bottom of his feet
[1:14:38] but he didn't come to bring natural
[1:14:40] children into the world
[1:14:42] he came to bring spiritual children into
[1:14:44] the world
[1:14:45] so that we would have a vote
[1:14:50] amen we could have a chance
[1:14:54] a vote
[1:14:58] amen sister i say thank you jesus myself
[1:15:01] and to thy seed which is
[1:15:02] christ christ came to bring us a
[1:15:05] spiritual seed
[1:15:06] he did not come to bring us a natural
[1:15:08] seed natural seed is what's killing us
[1:15:12] so you see this line real quick here's
[1:15:14] kane
[1:15:15] and abel we saw how that got convoluted
[1:15:18] and there's no way there can be a cane
[1:15:20] line
[1:15:21] and an able line or a seth line no
[1:15:25] okay
[1:15:28] now pay attention these two here
[1:15:33] came from the same daddy
[1:15:38] so it couldn't be seedline
[1:15:42] amen they both came from abraham
[1:15:45] now we know this one came from the beast
[1:15:48] and this one came from adam but when you
[1:15:51] get right here
[1:15:52] when you get right here no this is not
[1:15:54] but when you get right here where
[1:15:55] god said jacob have i love and he saw
[1:15:57] how i hated they came out of the same
[1:15:59] womb
[1:16:00] they had same natural daddies same
[1:16:03] natural dna
[1:16:05] but what happened afterwards election
[1:16:08] by election jacob wanted that birthright
[1:16:12] more than esau so that put him
[1:16:14] in a line of election
[1:16:20] god voted for him satan voted against
[1:16:22] him
[1:16:24] moses moses and balaam look balaam was
[1:16:28] close
[1:16:30] balaam was a prophet of god amen
[1:16:34] anointed prophet of god but what did he
[1:16:38] do
[1:16:39] he got israel he couldn't curse him but
[1:16:41] he was smart enough
[1:16:42] through what but through the
[1:16:45] intelligence of
[1:16:46] satan he yielded toward that
[1:16:50] by election he chose satan and said
[1:16:53] i can't curse you but i sure can make
[1:16:57] you marry the wrong people
[1:16:59] i sure can put you the sons of god and
[1:17:01] the daughters of men again i can put you
[1:17:03] down here
[1:17:03] and remember god told them he said do
[1:17:06] not mingle with the world
[1:17:08] that's right you marry
[1:17:11] your own your own line your own kind you
[1:17:14] marry you're through
[1:17:15] in your 12 tribes and balaam is going
[1:17:17] hmm
[1:17:18] see the strewness of satan balaam tried
[1:17:21] three or four times to curse israel
[1:17:24] being a prophet of god he could not
[1:17:26] because remember he kept going back to
[1:17:28] baylock he said i can't do it
[1:17:30] god won't allow me to do it but what
[1:17:33] kept what
[1:17:33] balaam kept going and yielded to who
[1:17:37] the devil and the devil said
[1:17:40] just have them intermingle in mass that
[1:17:42] god will be mad at him
[1:17:44] and that's what happened he said have a
[1:17:46] marry
[1:17:47] bring these real pretty and
[1:17:49] these real pretty sodomites and he's
[1:17:51] real pretty
[1:17:52] bring them up there and let them
[1:17:53] intermingle and what happened was
[1:17:56] god had to curse israel because of what
[1:17:59] happened
[1:18:01] elijah and ahab but look it's not
[1:18:04] natural seed lines though it's what they
[1:18:06] did with the word they were given
[1:18:09] that's my bottom line that's my bottom
[1:18:11] statement it's what each one of these
[1:18:13] did with the word of god
[1:18:15] right it's what each one of these
[1:18:18] did right here first this womb was
[1:18:21] messed up on every one of them except
[1:18:23] this one
[1:18:24] first but then what they did with it
[1:18:28] put them over on one side or the other
[1:18:30] side amen
[1:18:32] pretty simple in it but that's the whole
[1:18:34] thing
[1:18:36] with election according to election
[1:18:39] you say brother wade i don't have a
[1:18:40] chance who told you that
[1:18:43] let's stand our feet musicians come who
[1:18:45] told you that
[1:18:47] did god tell you that can you find it in
[1:18:48] the word of god finding the word of god
[1:18:50] somewhere where god said you ain't got a
[1:18:52] chance
[1:18:56] i think he said come to me all you the
[1:18:57] labor and heavy laden and i'll give you
[1:18:58] rest
[1:19:00] he didn't take away and he didn't say
[1:19:01] well now if you're of this line you
[1:19:03] can't of this line you can't of this
[1:19:04] line you can
[1:19:06] i just want to be part of the line of
[1:19:08] the tribe of judah
[1:19:10] that lie that's the line i want to be uh
[1:19:12] associated with
[1:19:14] let me read this quote real quick that
[1:19:16] brother uh joe sent me and
[1:19:18] and um brother durrett was quoting
[1:19:22] from from this from that time because
[1:19:23] we've come to a place
[1:19:26] that we did have an election the other
[1:19:27] day
[1:19:30] 1960 brother brown said i don't have
[1:19:32] time in this meeting to tell you
[1:19:34] in 1933 this is a woman's nation
[1:19:37] it's the number 13. it appears in the
[1:19:40] 13th chapter of revelations 13 stars 13
[1:19:43] stripes
[1:19:44] everything's 13 everything is a woman
[1:19:47] and remember
[1:19:48] thus saith the lord there will be a
[1:19:50] woman ruled before the end time
[1:19:53] she will either be president vice
[1:19:55] president or it will be the catholic
[1:19:57] church
[1:19:58] as a woman i've seen her a great woman
[1:20:00] the nation
[1:20:01] bowed to her it'll be one
[1:20:05] before the end time thus saith the lord
[1:20:08] write it down and find out you young
[1:20:09] people
[1:20:10] see if it happens if it isn't i'm a
[1:20:13] false prophet
[1:20:16] well we just elected
[1:20:19] a woman vice president of color
[1:20:23] which is fine i don't bother me a bit
[1:20:26] but it fulfills exactly
[1:20:28] and now you know biden's a catholic and
[1:20:30] we know all that's
[1:20:32] and and and i'm not worried like brother
[1:20:33] brown said he said i'm and i'm not
[1:20:35] democrat or republican but you do look
[1:20:37] at things
[1:20:38] as human beings and as people that have
[1:20:40] to live in the united states of america
[1:20:42] but the united states the other day
[1:20:46] there was an election and they chose
[1:20:50] what they chose and now you got to live
[1:20:53] with it
[1:20:55] now let's go in the spiritual
[1:20:58] you're going to have to make a choice
[1:21:01] there's an election in your life and
[1:21:02] it's not every four years
[1:21:04] it's every day of your life
[1:21:08] god voted for you the devil voted
[1:21:11] against you
[1:21:12] you swing that bow
[1:21:15] let's sing a song it's that simple you
[1:21:18] don't have a laundry lid you don't have
[1:21:19] to stand on your head you don't have to
[1:21:20] go to
[1:21:21] do novenia's and do it you don't no
[1:21:23] believe what god said
[1:21:26] and we believe a prophet came in the end
[1:21:28] time to give us clarity
[1:21:30] to know what was coming this world don't
[1:21:31] know what's coming we know what's coming

[1:26:12] the lord amen you love the lord
[1:26:16] [Music]
[1:26:17] election you got everything to do with
[1:26:21] it
[1:26:24] but it's not by works it's by living the
[1:26:28] word of god
[1:26:30] have you tried your best
[1:26:33] i've never tried my best i'm human i
[1:26:36] have all these different things that go
[1:26:38] on in
[1:26:38] in life and all that you know but i
[1:26:42] still got an anchor that says
[1:26:44] if you'll do what i say come back and do
[1:26:47] what i say
[1:26:49] then he'll do what he said because he
[1:26:52] promised he would
[1:26:56] god voted for you satan's going to
[1:26:59] always vote against you
[1:27:01] you swing the vote you know i was
[1:27:03] reading the other day
[1:27:06] you take this great prophet brother
[1:27:09] durant that saw i don't say he saw
[1:27:13] thousands i say it's almost millions of
[1:27:14] healings
[1:27:16] brother brown saw millions of healings
[1:27:18] in his in his campaign 250 000 in one
[1:27:21] service
[1:27:24] and he's standing there under the
[1:27:25] anointing of god and he says
[1:27:27] [Music]
[1:27:29] basically a positive mental attitude
[1:27:35] toward any promise of god
[1:27:38] you don't gotta jump through a hoop
[1:27:40] young guy saying no venus you don't have
[1:27:42] to pay the preacher
[1:27:44] he said a positive attitude
[1:27:48] toward any promise of god
[1:27:50] [Music]
[1:27:51] will bring it to pass and we say oh we
[1:27:55] gotta build it
[1:27:56] amen a positive mental attitude
[1:28:01] toward any promise of god now listen
[1:28:05] we're not preaching mind over matter but
[1:28:06] i'm telling you something
[1:28:08] it has been proven even by scientists
[1:28:11] that
[1:28:11] what happens up here has a lot to do
[1:28:13] with your body
[1:28:14] [Music]
[1:28:15] so if you'll let the holy ghost put that
[1:28:17] together amen
[1:28:20] supposed to have the mind of christ
[1:28:21] right and then you just start confessing
[1:28:24] it
[1:28:25] just start saying it don't worry about
[1:28:28] what happens
[1:28:30] if you can't see tomorrow don't worry
[1:28:31] about tomorrow
[1:28:34] you got another day
[1:28:38] fear brings torment don't fear
[1:28:42] positive mental attitude toward any
[1:28:45] promise of god
[1:28:46] will bring it to pass that's so simple
[1:28:49] it goes right over the top of most
[1:28:50] people
[1:28:52] it just goes right over and nobody
[1:28:57] nobody can stand against it
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:02] after i guess after the service okay
[1:29:05] all right you wanna do it now sis sure
[1:29:08] come on
[1:29:10] come on yes ma'am come right here
[1:29:15] thank the lord jesus it's so good to be
[1:29:18] here with y'all y'all have no idea
[1:29:20] um i want to give a testimony um
[1:29:24] i want to give my life testimony but
[1:29:25] it's not going to be today it's for
[1:29:27] something else
[1:29:28] that life testimony has to be kind of
[1:29:30] put some note down and so i can make it
[1:29:32] come out clear
[1:29:33] but first of all i just want to
[1:29:34] introduce the lord jesus christ because
[1:29:36] he did something for me the other day
[1:29:39] and um what you just was speaking about
[1:29:40] just pump me up just come up here
[1:29:42] and um something happened
[1:29:45] um the other day
[1:29:48] with me and my son and um
[1:29:52] he was at school and
[1:29:57] one of his math teachers called me
[1:30:01] and stated that you know isaac was
[1:30:03] having a little trouble in class
[1:30:05] so y'all can sit down if you want it
[1:30:07] might take a minute i won't take too
[1:30:09] long cause i know y'all got cake and ice
[1:30:10] cream
[1:30:12] anyway um his math teacher called me
[1:30:16] and said you know isaac's having a
[1:30:17] little trouble in class and
[1:30:20] he wanted me to speak with isaac when he
[1:30:22] gets home so that things can get
[1:30:24] resolved so isaac can um
[1:30:25] move forward so i said okay i'll talk to
[1:30:29] him
[1:30:30] and isaac came home and of course you
[1:30:32] know as a mother you talking to him and
[1:30:34] kind of scolding him and trying to get
[1:30:37] him to start making the right choices
[1:30:40] um and i'm not gonna lie i'm gonna keep
[1:30:42] it real
[1:30:44] sometime for me when things get
[1:30:48] frustrating i'll handle it kind of like
[1:30:50] how i normally would
[1:30:52] would be maybe fuss you know you got to
[1:30:53] get together your future and
[1:30:55] and this you know and you you got to get
[1:30:56] together my mind goes all into the
[1:30:58] future of what's going to happen if you
[1:30:59] fail
[1:31:00] and fear takes over next thing you know
[1:31:01] i'm yelling i'm kind of scolding i'm
[1:31:04] fearful i'm looking into the future so
[1:31:06] i'm taking it out on him in that kind of
[1:31:08] way like you can't keep doing this and
[1:31:10] you know whatever so anyway um
[1:31:14] the math teacher called me i think
[1:31:17] maybe maybe a week or two later or
[1:31:19] something i might be getting my dates
[1:31:20] mixed up so forgive me
[1:31:22] call me maybe a week or two later um
[1:31:24] isaac's still getting a little trouble
[1:31:25] this is a good testimony so i hope i get
[1:31:27] embarrassed but um
[1:31:30] calls me again and says you know yeah
[1:31:32] you know i've been talking to isaac i
[1:31:33] really want the best for isaac
[1:31:35] and you know but i can't keep
[1:31:39] dealing with this you know
[1:31:40] disruptiveness so i'm like okay
[1:31:43] i'm embarrassed i'm like what else to do
[1:31:46] you know i'm tired of talking i'm tired
[1:31:47] of um
[1:31:48] i'm just tired you know um it's just me
[1:31:51] and isaac
[1:31:52] his dad is in africa so it's kind of
[1:31:53] just been me raising him so you know
[1:31:55] it's
[1:31:55] when everything's on you you kind of
[1:31:57] like woof you know
[1:31:58] um so
[1:32:02] i'm like you know okay all right i i'll
[1:32:04] talk to isaac again
[1:32:06] so this time i kind of
[1:32:10] gave up a little bit in a way i said
[1:32:12] isaac look
[1:32:13] if you keep acting up you're gonna have
[1:32:15] to get the consequences to go with that
[1:32:17] you already know what what they say will
[1:32:18] happen so if you go in there make the
[1:32:20] wrong choice again
[1:32:21] that's what's gonna happen i can't keep
[1:32:23] babying you i can't keep talking to you
[1:32:25] it's not making any difference so
[1:32:26] you're going to have to know when you
[1:32:27] make a choice it's going to be a
[1:32:28] consequence after that
[1:32:30] so this time um oh
[1:32:34] i think i told him this too i said you
[1:32:35] know what this time i'm just going to
[1:32:36] give it to god whatever you do you're
[1:32:37] going to have to pay for that
[1:32:38] consequence
[1:32:39] that's real life lesson so um
[1:32:43] i think uh the teacher something
[1:32:46] happened i think they called me again
[1:32:47] and this time i said you know what don't
[1:32:50] talk to isaac anymore
[1:32:51] if he does something matter of fact
[1:32:52] don't even give them strike two send
[1:32:54] them out send them where you gotta go
[1:32:55] because you warned them i warned them
[1:32:56] nobody has to keep talking you shouldn't
[1:32:58] have to keep talking
[1:33:00] so um he said okay
[1:33:05] i told isaac i said isaac whatever
[1:33:08] happens i'm putting this in god hand now
[1:33:10] and i told god god you got to be right
[1:33:12] you got to help me i don't know how to
[1:33:13] be
[1:33:14] the right parent i don't know what else
[1:33:15] to do to get the right results i don't
[1:33:17] know
[1:33:18] i just got to give this over to you take
[1:33:20] it next thing i know
[1:33:22] i really felt myself giving it to god
[1:33:24] like whatever happens maybe he has to go
[1:33:26] through things where he can learn hey
[1:33:27] it's a consequence
[1:33:28] maybe too much forgiveness might not be
[1:33:30] good for him maybe he need to really
[1:33:32] suffer and go through things so he can
[1:33:33] realize hey whatever i do i gotta pay
[1:33:35] for that in some kind of way that might
[1:33:36] be the best lesson for him
[1:33:38] so um next thing i know
[1:33:42] that same day the teacher calls me
[1:33:46] and says a different situation happened
[1:33:48] as it got into
[1:33:49] a fight the same day now and i'm like
[1:33:51] okay what in the world
[1:33:54] isaac gets in their fight and they say
[1:33:55] they're going to suspend him three days
[1:33:58] but this time i was calm because i
[1:33:59] already gave it over to god
[1:34:01] i said okay that's that's what got to
[1:34:03] happen let it happen
[1:34:04] um that's fine normally i would have
[1:34:08] been kind of embarrassed not sure what
[1:34:10] to say kind of like boy i
[1:34:12] don't know what to tell this you know i
[1:34:13] taught him when he get home you know
[1:34:14] normally you nervous you feel
[1:34:16] embarrassed and
[1:34:16] but this time i said okay just just let
[1:34:18] it happen and somehow i felt god was
[1:34:21] into this
[1:34:21] somehow i felt something was going to
[1:34:23] come out of this
[1:34:24] so i'm sitting at a table
[1:34:28] uh i think when i got home and forgive
[1:34:30] me i might be getting mixed up i'm just
[1:34:32] trying to remember to the best of my
[1:34:33] knowledge i think when i got home i was
[1:34:34] sitting at a table
[1:34:36] and i was thinking i was somehow you
[1:34:37] know i got to speak to you and he's not
[1:34:39] talking but he's speaking to your mind
[1:34:41] and he starts saying you know
[1:34:44] just think about how i how i parent you
[1:34:47] when you're doing something wrong
[1:34:48] or if you make a choice i don't force
[1:34:50] you i go ahead and let you do what you
[1:34:51] want to do matter of fact he just took
[1:34:53] me out of the world
[1:34:54] he just took me out of a backslidden
[1:34:55] position straight up a very
[1:34:58] he let go and let that devil have his
[1:34:59] way with me too it was tormenting
[1:35:01] and he had to let me go through that
[1:35:03] sure you know what i'm saying so he can
[1:35:04] get me back thank
[1:35:05] god so um he just started speaking to me
[1:35:08] and said
[1:35:09] when you made your choice you knew there
[1:35:12] was going to be consequences but i just
[1:35:13] let you go because i'm not going to
[1:35:15] force you to do anything
[1:35:16] i can tell you i can warn you but i'll
[1:35:19] let you go
[1:35:20] i still love you so that's what i want
[1:35:22] you to do with isaac
[1:35:23] when he comes home don't fuss at him be

[1:36:28] wondering why he's so quiet why are you

[1:36:30] humble and and he's looking at me
[1:36:32] thinking i'm gonna just snap and you

[1:36:38] weird i'm like what you want to eat you
[1:36:39] know what you want and
[1:36:41] uh he started picking up his own laundry
[1:36:43] putting it in the machine and everything
[1:36:44] i'm like man that's all it took you know
[1:36:45] like walk like this
[1:36:48] oh my god
[1:36:53] um he started picking up his laundry and
[1:36:56] just putting in the machine and just
[1:36:57] doing things i'm like oh my god
[1:36:58] that's all it took just so anyway i
[1:37:00] asked him what he want to eat i didn't
[1:37:02] say
[1:37:02] anything i didn't say nothing and it
[1:37:04] gets better um
[1:37:06] it was so peaceful not to say nothing it
[1:37:09] was so peaceful just to see what god is
[1:37:11] doing
[1:37:12] we end up ending that night like that um
[1:37:15] the next morning
[1:37:16] we didn't have internet access and he
[1:37:18] needed that to do his school work
[1:37:20] um one of the parents that he know
[1:37:23] have a child at home school she invited
[1:37:24] isaac over to do his work there that was
[1:37:26] a blessing
[1:37:27] because i didn't have any internet or
[1:37:28] anything but here's the best part
[1:37:31] two days later two days later
[1:37:35] one of the uh coaches called me and left
[1:37:38] a message and said hey
[1:37:39] call me back i really need to tell you
[1:37:41] something isaac did and it's a life
[1:37:43] lesson for all of us
[1:37:44] so in my mind i'm like what in the world
[1:37:46] could that be right so um
[1:37:48] i call back and he says um
[1:37:52] isaac did something and i just got to
[1:37:55] bring it to your attention because this
[1:37:57] is something we all can learn from
[1:37:59] so i'm like what in the world you know
[1:38:00] what is it he says uh
[1:38:02] when isaac first came to that school now
[1:38:04] isaac when we left from baltimore
[1:38:06] um not too long ago isaac didn't want to
[1:38:08] go it was one of those situations
[1:38:09] it was the right season the right time
[1:38:11] and i had to make a choice to god or
[1:38:12] whatever i'm going to however i'm going
[1:38:14] to live or god so it's one of those
[1:38:16] things you got to just let go of
[1:38:17] everything and just go
[1:38:19] and uh so isaac you know it was hard for
[1:38:21] him because he
[1:38:22] you know he don't he didn't understand
[1:38:23] everything but anyway um
[1:38:25] that that coach said when isaac got to
[1:38:27] that school
[1:38:28] you know um isaac was sitting in the
[1:38:31] cafeteria
[1:38:33] and he ended up sitting at the wrong
[1:38:35] table the wrong area
[1:38:36] and uh he said one of the teachers came
[1:38:38] up to him and kind of was
[1:38:40] scolding him in a certain kind of a way
[1:38:42] and asking him you know why are you
[1:38:43] sitting here you're not supposed to sit
[1:38:44] here or something like that
[1:38:46] so he said he never seen a child or even
[1:38:48] adult so
[1:38:49] calm the way that teacher came at him
[1:38:51] isaac was like you know oh i apologize i
[1:38:53] didn't know i couldn't sit here this is
[1:38:54] my first day
[1:38:55] you know or something like that i
[1:38:56] apologize but the way he expressed it
[1:38:58] was like i never seen nobody handle
[1:38:59] herself so
[1:39:00] you know um in control like that you
[1:39:03] know i just need to bring that to your
[1:39:04] attention
[1:39:04] he said in the second thing when isaac
[1:39:06] got into that fight
[1:39:07] i was the one that broke the fight up he
[1:39:09] said but here's the thing that got me
[1:39:12] he said um isaac was telling me you know
[1:39:14] that the guy kept
[1:39:15] picking at him or something so you know
[1:39:16] they end up getting to a fight he said
[1:39:18] but here's the thing
[1:39:20] when i broke them up there was you know
[1:39:23] it was it was
[1:39:24] you know when you get to fight you your
[1:39:25] attitude is like here he said
[1:39:28] most of the time it takes a child or
[1:39:30] even an adult to
[1:39:31] come down a little bit you can't just go
[1:39:33] from 100 to zero right
[1:39:34] right away he said but when i talked to
[1:39:36] isaac isaac came down like from
[1:39:39] a hundred to zero like in no time and he
[1:39:42] said i've never seen that before and he
[1:39:43] was so amazing
[1:39:45] and like i i've never seen anything like
[1:39:46] that that's that's a lesson for
[1:39:48] i mean he was just i never heard anybody
[1:39:50] call and express it the way it touched
[1:39:51] him so in my mind i'm like wow
[1:39:53] but here's the point two days prior like
[1:39:56] what i was saying if i would have gotten
[1:39:57] upset without it there you go
[1:39:59] and handle things differently i wouldn't
[1:40:02] have seen what god wanted to receive two
[1:40:03] days later god is gonna take care of
[1:40:05] your children
[1:40:06] if you give it to him whatever it is
[1:40:08] just like you were saying you know what
[1:40:09] i'm saying give it to god and let go let
[1:40:10] him drop in your mind what to do it
[1:40:12] might you know
[1:40:14] sometimes it take time for it to get to
[1:40:15] that place what i'm saying is
[1:40:17] let go when you get to that point where
[1:40:19] you can't do it no more and sometimes
[1:40:21] that's the best one you can't do it no
[1:40:22] more
[1:40:23] let god drop to you what to do and it
[1:40:26] works better that way
[1:40:27] as a matter of fact you'd be like why
[1:40:29] didn't i know this sooner
[1:40:30] but oh my god i just want to give the
[1:40:32] god the glory i never had a phone call
[1:40:34] since after that
[1:40:35] i mean it's been it's been a blessing
[1:40:37] it's been thank you jesus
[1:40:41] praise the lord amen
[1:40:42] [Applause]
[1:40:45] amen we mess up
[1:40:49] when we mess up when we go when we try
[1:40:53] to do how many times have we tried to do
[1:40:54] it ourself
[1:40:56] so it's just human sister we just try to
[1:40:58] do it ourselves let's stand our feet
[1:41:00] praise the lord give god the glory amen
[1:41:04] let go and let god amen i've seen that
[1:41:08] before let go and let god
[1:41:09] thank you jesus i promise you one thing
[1:41:11] you can't save them
[1:41:14] you can't make them change god's gonna
[1:41:16] have to do it
[1:41:18] he changed me my mama tried to save me
[1:41:21] for 20 years
[1:41:23] didn't happen for a second but when god
[1:41:25] got a hold of me
[1:41:27] he saved my soul amen that's right
[1:41:29] brother your mama needs to pray for you
[1:41:30] that's for sure
[1:41:32] but god's one that does a saving but he
[1:41:34] knows your mom and dad is praying for
[1:41:35] you there you go back to the election
[1:41:37] and you go back to foreign knowledge
[1:41:39] see because if we think it predetermined
[1:41:41] we just go well it's going to happen
[1:41:42] it's just the way it is
[1:41:43] it's just the way that that's why i
[1:41:44] don't like that it is what it is
[1:41:46] i don't like that anyway what if god
[1:41:48] would have said that
[1:41:50] it is what it is take it or leave it no
[1:41:51] that's what cain told god
[1:41:54] this is all i got take it or leave it
[1:41:56] well he left it
[1:41:57] but when you go to god and say god i
[1:41:59] ain't got no more
[1:42:01] you gonna have to change it because i
[1:42:02] can't change you you're gonna have to do
[1:42:05] it cause there's no way i can do it
[1:42:08] man has never saved a person oh you
[1:42:12] might have physically saved somebody's
[1:42:13] life but you can't give them eternal
[1:42:15] life only
[1:42:15] god can give eternal life amen so let's
