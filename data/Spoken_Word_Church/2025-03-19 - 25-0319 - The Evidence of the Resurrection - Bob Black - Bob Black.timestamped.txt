[4:09] We have come with open hearts. Oh, let
[4:14] the word of God.
[4:17] [Music]
[4:19] Amen. Let's bow our heads in our hearts.
[4:22] Well, God, we're so grateful to be able
[4:24] to gather around your word tonight, Lord
[4:25] Jesus. Lord, we got the words laying on
[4:28] the page, Lord Jesus. The words that I
[4:29] could read from my notes, Lord, but what
[4:31] good would it do if your spirit doesn't
[4:33] come and quicken it to us? That's right.
[4:35] You told the woman at the well that the
[4:38] true worshiper must worship in spirit
[4:40] and truth. I pray God that your spirit
[4:42] will be with us tonight, Lord God, to
[4:43] give meaning and give us allow us to
[4:46] read between the lines and to give us
[4:47] the true essence of what your words say.
[4:50] God be with us, Lord, to give us
[4:51] encouragement. We pray and Lord bless
[4:53] the service tonight. Bless your people,
[4:55] Lord Jesus. Bless my lips, Lord, that
[4:57] you'll order my words exactly where they
[4:59] need to go, Lord. I pray, Lord, that
[5:01] you'll be with us. We ask you in your
[5:02] name.
[5:04] Amen. Let's turn to Numbers chapter 21
[5:08] and we'll just take just a I don't want
[5:10] to tend to take the bone
[5:13] tonight scripture talk about the
[5:16] evidence of the resurrection.
[5:19] It's maybe strange to read the evidence
[5:21] of the resurrection over in Numbers, but
[5:24] you know the whole uh the whole
[5:26] scripture speaks of uh the Old Testament
[5:29] lays the foundation of of all the things
[5:31] that we read about in the New Testament
[5:33] that uh so we'll we'll just read this
[5:36] scripture here in uh Numbers 21
[5:40] 5-10 and it
[5:43] says and the people spake against
[5:47] God and against Moses
[5:50] Wherefore have you brought us up out of
[5:52] Egypt to die in the
[5:54] wilderness? For there is no bread,
[5:56] neither is there any water, and our soul
[5:59] loa this like bread. And the Lord sent
[6:02] fiery serpents among the people, and
[6:04] they bit the people, and much people of
[6:06] Israel died. Therefore the people came
[6:09] to Moses and said, We have sinned, for
[6:12] we have spoken against the Lord and
[6:13] against thee. Pray unto the Lord that he
[6:15] may take away the serpents from us. And
[6:18] Moses prayed for the
[6:20] people. And the Lord said unto Moses,
[6:22] "Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it
[6:24] upon a pole, and it shall come to pass
[6:27] that everyone that is bitten, when he
[6:30] lookketh upon it, shall live." And Moses
[6:33] made a serpent of brass, and put it upon
[6:35] a pole. And it came to pass that if a
[6:38] serpent had bitten any man, when he
[6:41] beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
[6:45] And the children of Israel set forward
[6:46] and pitched in Noboth. You may be
[6:48] seated. The Lord add his blessing to the
[6:50] reading of the
[6:52] word. Now what what a scene this paints
[6:55] for us that the children of Israel as
[6:58] they were leading leaving all of the the
[7:00] the bondage and slavery that they had
[7:02] been in that uh they got to thinking
[7:05] about where they had come from and
[7:07] wishing that they were were back where
[7:08] where they got to kind of upset and
[7:10] griping about the predicament that they
[7:13] were in. And God just allowed uh
[7:16] serpents to come among them. And and now
[7:19] you think what a scene that would be to
[7:21] unfold is a bunch of snakes among the
[7:24] people biting them. And you know, maybe
[7:28] maybe today that there's not serpents
[7:31] biting people, but this this uh the
[7:33] effects of what the serpent did in the
[7:36] Garden of Eden is now still uh you know,
[7:40] plaguing many people with anxieties and
[7:43] depressions and and all kinds of things
[7:46] that, you know, they they you know, you
[7:48] people will say, "Well, I how do I get
[7:49] rid of this thing that I've been
[7:51] battling? How do I overcome this uh this
[7:54] this thing that that really came about
[7:57] because of the fall that you look at you
[7:59] look at your flesh and you were born the
[8:01] wrong way. And uh you know every one of
[8:04] us when we were born you know you watch
[8:06] your children being born and you think
[8:07] what a what a horrible world almost to
[8:09] be to be born into to know that
[8:12] everything the world is so greedy and
[8:15] and and and sinbased and everything's
[8:18] every everything is is offkilter because
[8:22] really it comes down to because one of
[8:25] of of taking one word off. Amen. and and
[8:27] and now you know all these people are
[8:30] being beset on every side by serpents
[8:33] biting them and afflicting them and and
[8:35] and killing them and taking their lives
[8:37] and and and this scene is unfolding and
[8:40] then Moses comes and and under the
[8:42] direction of God and takes a a a staff
[8:44] and puts a brazen serpent on it and
[8:47] lifts it up so that uh and to think what
[8:50] a promise that all you got to do it to
[8:53] be free of your affliction all you got
[8:56] to do is just look at the that brazen
[8:58] serpent and and really to think now that
[9:01] to just like today maybe it really we
[9:06] can be sure that there were at least a
[9:08] few that were so stubborn in their
[9:10] hearts that they would resist and just
[9:12] would not even look at the atonement
[9:15] that God had made for them. Amen. And
[9:18] and brother Brandon would lay this out.
[9:19] They said when there was a trouble and
[9:22] now you think about they had a trouble
[9:23] that they were afflicted on every hand
[9:25] by the serpents. Uh now what about us in
[9:28] this day? Amen. When there's a trouble
[9:30] it doesn't matter what the trouble is.
[9:33] God has always been the God to meet the
[9:36] need. Amen. When there is a need for his
[9:38] people. Amen. So this afternoon, no
[9:41] matter what your need is, if you're
[9:43] beset by the serpent, the fiery serpent,
[9:46] you can have confidence that there is a
[9:49] God that is that will meet that need.
[9:51] You know, every time on the street when
[9:53] you would down in Atlanta, you know, the
[9:55] ambulance would come by or the fire
[9:57] trucks would come by and and they
[9:59] actually would testify, the hospital,
[10:01] the Emory Hospital would testify of this
[10:04] story because they've got the staff and
[10:06] they've got the serpent twisting its way
[10:07] around the staff as a reminder to us
[10:11] that there is an atonement here in the
[10:13] Bible that God as Jesus promised that if
[10:16] I be lifted up, I'll draw all men into
[10:18] me. Well, he would he was lifted up as a
[10:21] symbol that he had taken on himself. All
[10:24] of the all of the curse, all of the the
[10:27] attribute, all of the things that that
[10:29] serpent symbolized, and he took all that
[10:31] on himself so that you and I would not
[10:34] be judged. Amen. And all we have to do
[10:36] to escape everything that the fiery
[10:39] serpent does is just look uh look with
[10:41] faith, believing on what Christ has
[10:43] already done. Amen. Now he said they had
[10:46] did wrong and they had sinned and done
[10:48] things that was wrong yet when they had
[10:50] need of healing. God made an atonement
[10:52] for healing when there was no atonement
[10:54] yet. But what a thing to think about
[10:57] tonight that despite all of our
[10:59] problems, despite all of our mistakes,
[11:02] despite all of our failings, you can
[11:05] look maybe maybe sit there in your seat
[11:06] tonight and think about all the things
[11:08] that we've done wrong. all the places
[11:10] where we fallen up short and all those
[11:12] places where they had fallen up short.
[11:15] But none of that mattered. All they had
[11:17] to do was look to the atonement that
[11:19] Christ had made. And you you think what
[11:21] that means is that God paid the price.
[11:24] He paid the price for your healing. He
[11:27] paid the price for your salvation. He
[11:29] paid the price. He He paid the price for
[11:31] every debt that was owed. And he what he
[11:34] did was he gave you the checkbook and
[11:35] said if you'll just I my name's already
[11:38] there signed in blood Jesus Christ. All
[11:41] you got to do is put your name next to
[11:43] mine and say I accept it and whatever
[11:45] you need tonight the price is already
[11:47] paid. Now that means you know you you
[11:50] grow as you grow up and go through life
[11:53] you start you start hearing bad reports
[11:55] from the doctrine. you st start hearing
[11:57] bad reports from your family members and
[12:00] for your father and your mother and
[12:02] different ones, the doctor will say this
[12:03] and the doctor will say, "Well, I don't
[12:05] know. It's past is past our
[12:07] understanding." But I I thank God that
[12:09] we've got this kind of a promise that we
[12:11] can look and it don't matter of our our
[12:13] own abilities, our own afflictions, our
[12:15] own self. It does none of that matters.
[12:18] But we've got a God who paid the price
[12:21] and and when he paid it, we can have
[12:23] confidence. We can have trust that he is
[12:26] worthy to to remit to us everything that
[12:29] he bought for us. Amen. Now, you think
[12:32] that in the face of every difficult, God
[12:34] will make a way of escape. Amen. He will
[12:37] do it if you'll just have faith and
[12:39] believe him is what brother Ram said.
[12:42] Now, in 1 Corinthians 10:13, there's a
[12:44] scripture that we read often. It says,
[12:47] "There hath no
[12:48] temptation taken you, but such as is
[12:52] common to man, but God is faithful, who
[12:55] will not suffer you to be tempted, above
[12:58] that you are able, right? But will with
[13:01] the temptation also make a way to
[13:03] escape, that you may be able to bear
[13:06] it." Now, you know, I I thank God that
[13:08] we've got we've got we we've been taught
[13:10] well and we have all the background of
[13:12] this. Thank God that we can look at this
[13:13] scripture and we know we can correctly
[13:15] place it that this is not saying that
[13:17] that that through life you're never
[13:19] going to have a job experience where
[13:21] maybe like Job that he lost all of his
[13:23] family and looked around he lost
[13:24] everything he lost all his barns lost
[13:26] all of this lo and and the the the
[13:28] crushing weight of that situation would
[13:31] truly be too much to bear to to get to a
[13:33] place where I I've got I I need I got to
[13:35] turn to God. I can't I can't do it on my
[13:37] own. Maybe you the crushing weight of of
[13:39] that doctor report where maybe you've
[13:42] only been given a few months to live or
[13:44] a few hours, a few days or whatever. The
[13:46] crushing weight. But now, so God allows
[13:49] sometimes you to you for you to go
[13:51] through situations that just squeeze out
[13:54] life, squeeze out the goodness from you
[13:56] like like grapes being squeezed out. So
[13:59] this ain't saying you ain't going to go
[14:01] through some bad times. bad times that
[14:03] are too much for you to endure almost
[14:05] too much for you to go through without
[14:07] God. But what it is saying is that
[14:10] through life, all the things that this
[14:12] that the that serpent in the garden has
[14:14] put on you, all those things that maybe
[14:17] you the genetic problems that you
[14:19] inherited from your mother and father
[14:20] and maybe all the burdens of debt that
[14:22] you inherited and all those thing all
[14:24] the temptations of trying to get away
[14:26] from pornography and trying to get away
[14:28] from all those bind battles that there's
[14:31] no way
[14:34] that God will make a God will make a way
[14:37] of escape. There's no no temptation too
[14:40] great that God will leave you without a
[14:43] way of escape.
[14:47] Brother Brown will say sickness is a
[14:49] direct or indirect cause by sin. Before
[14:52] we had any sin, we had no sickness. So
[14:55] first sickness is an attribute of sin.
[14:57] Maybe not what you've done, but what you
[14:59] inherited because God promised that it
[15:01] would go even to the third and fourth
[15:03] generations that he would visit sickness
[15:06] because of the parents disobedience to
[15:08] him. Now, you think about that this
[15:10] morning. There's a lot of problems that
[15:12] we we it ain't our fault. That's right.
[15:14] There's a lot of problems in our
[15:16] genetics. You know, I my mom had this
[15:19] sweaty hands and I got sweaty hands and
[15:22] I I'm like, how why do I why am I cursed
[15:25] with sweaty hands? I got this sweaty
[15:28] hand genetic and and you might have you
[15:31] might have genetic problems your in your
[15:33] own life. But you know, no matter
[15:36] whether it's heart problems or kidney
[15:38] disease or whatever it is, whatever the
[15:41] problem is that God has made a way of
[15:44] escape. Now, if we can really, brother
[15:46] Rand would say, if we can really get get
[15:48] our our our faith in alignment where the
[15:50] inside man is thinking like the outside
[15:53] man, that our spirit and our soul are
[15:55] lined up and we're really believing from
[15:58] the inside and out that something is
[16:00] going to happen. And you know, that
[16:02] actually is happening, that's taking
[16:03] place as we hear the word. as you hear
[16:06] the word and your confidence is built up
[16:08] that you can trust God and you begin to
[16:10] believe that all things really are
[16:12] possible to believe that things begin to
[16:14] change things begin to take place and
[16:17] you know God God is going to change our
[16:19] genetics he's going to change this
[16:22] mortal body to immortality he's actually
[16:24] going to transform the atoms the
[16:27] molecular structure of our body and oh
[16:29] that we've got to come to a place where
[16:31] we truly believe it and it's happening
[16:33] right now as we hear the word to think
[16:36] that to think that everything that the
[16:38] devil did everything everything he
[16:39] accomplished there in the Garden of Eden
[16:41] that there on the cross that Christ put
[16:43] the serpent's head under his foot and
[16:46] and stepped on his foot so that you and
[16:48] I can also now we can step on our on on
[16:50] the devil's head just like the the the
[16:52] the uh Israelite general there that in
[16:55] the Old Testament, right? I'm trying
[16:58] trying to think of the story where they
[16:59] when they conquer those generals, they
[17:01] they called them out and put their feet
[17:03] on their head to symbolize that now they
[17:05] had possession over the enemy. You think
[17:09] a mother and a father and a grandfather,
[17:11] their their their genes pass on down,
[17:14] pass on down. In Numbers 14, it said,
[17:15] "The Lord is long-suffering
[17:18] and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity
[17:20] and transgression and by no means
[17:22] clearing the guilty, visiting the
[17:24] iniquity of the fathers upon the gen
[17:26] children unto the third and fourth
[17:27] generation."
[17:29] What that means, patterns of behavior?
[17:32] Why? Why do I act the way that I do? And
[17:34] in your naturalb born life, you look
[17:36] back and you'll find out that you act
[17:38] the way that you do because you
[17:39] inherited some genetic trait. And like
[17:42] that German boy that brother Random
[17:43] always talks about that could he just
[17:45] was so stubborn that he just could not
[17:47] ask for forgiveness. Oh, but the Holy
[17:49] Ghost can take that out and change it.
[17:52] Change the nature that you are. So that
[17:55] once where you were stubborn and you
[17:57] were unwilling to go to somebody and ask
[17:59] for forgiveness, that God will change
[18:01] that to make you act like Christ. Amen.
[18:04] All these inherited weaknesses, physical
[18:07] and emotional conditions, like you know,
[18:09] sometimes children are in they they
[18:11] inherit an addiction that their parents
[18:13] had or they'll be predisposed to have
[18:16] some kind of an addiction problem and
[18:17] they'll get caught up in that and
[18:19] they'll swept along with an addiction
[18:20] and before you know that it's it's
[18:22] overtaken them. Amen. Or or or disease
[18:24] and a divorce and relationship patterns
[18:27] where you'll see the the mother and
[18:28] their father. Maybe they have problems
[18:30] just really sticking with somebody and
[18:33] and and and it and it just propagates on
[18:35] down to the children. Well, that maybe
[18:37] they'll have that same problem or abuse
[18:39] and trauma and criminal behavior. You
[18:41] know, a child raised up in a in a
[18:43] criminal household, they'll develop
[18:44] those same criminal tendencies where
[18:47] they see their mama shoplifting and now
[18:49] it's just gone right on down to them.
[18:51] And they've seen that it's it's been
[18:52] normalized that mama takes a stick of
[18:54] butter in the supermarket. Well, it's
[18:56] fine for me to take a stick of butter or
[18:58] or that toy that I really like and and
[19:01] it just trickles right on down. And you
[19:03] know, you know, the gospel is to was
[19:06] given to us to break those kind of
[19:07] cycles so that you could to get away
[19:10] from those those those things that we
[19:12] inherited, those things that we grew up
[19:14] with that were normalized in our homes,
[19:17] those tendencies in our homes to not
[19:19] seek forgiveness, that the gospel comes
[19:21] and changes everything. Aren't you glad
[19:23] for a gospel that can change everything?
[19:25] that can change situations, that can
[19:27] change people, that can cause addictions
[19:30] to drop away. Now, we've seen it. We've
[19:32] seen it right here in this church that
[19:34] addict somebody will be addicted of
[19:36] cigarettes or alcohol or what and they
[19:38] just can't get away from it. But then
[19:40] then you let God begin to woo over that
[19:42] person's heart and it's the word. It's
[19:44] not a minister beating them or a deacon
[19:46] beating them or something, but it's God
[19:47] getting a hold to him and he begins to
[19:50] change them and draw him to himself. And
[19:52] what they once thought was impossible,
[19:55] God can make impossible. Aren't you glad
[19:58] that we serve a God where the the God of
[20:01] miracles? You want you want to look for
[20:02] miracles? Somebody was asking me the
[20:04] other day, where are all the miracles?
[20:06] Well, you can look around this building
[20:07] and see all the miracles. All the ones
[20:09] that have been caught up from the things
[20:11] that they were in the world and their
[20:13] life has been changed. That's a miracle.
[20:15] Hallelujah. Amen. And that brazen
[20:18] serpent, what's that represent? It
[20:19] represents that God created a situation.
[20:22] He created a situation back then. He
[20:25] created a situation there on the cross
[20:27] where he can move past all the
[20:30] traditions and all the dogmas and all
[20:33] the theology and do what he wants with
[20:37] your life. Amen. Now, that's what the
[20:39] gospel message is about. That God can do
[20:42] whatever he wants with your life. Amen.
[20:45] You know, a good doctor is going to
[20:46] diagnose the case till he finds just
[20:49] exactly where the cause is. You know, as
[20:52] you get older, isn't it one of the most
[20:53] frustrating things to go to the doctor
[20:55] and they say, "I don't know." Y you It's
[20:58] like if you took take your car to the
[21:00] mechanic and and there it's making this
[21:03] weird noise. Something's wrong with the
[21:05] tire or something. I don't know. and you
[21:08] take your body to the to the doctor and
[21:11] they look and they examine and spend
[21:13] hundreds, thousands of dollars putting
[21:15] you in all the machines and they come
[21:17] back and they say, "I don't know." And
[21:18] many times they just give up on you.
[21:21] Now, aren't you glad though that that
[21:22] for a God that will actually that will
[21:25] send five ministry to actually preach a
[21:28] go a word that can discern out the root
[21:32] cause, that can work out the problems in
[21:35] our lives. Oh, that's why we should be
[21:37] so grateful for the true genuine
[21:39] preaching of the word that it's not just
[21:41] to just to beat on us and and and harp
[21:44] on our little faults and things, but
[21:45] it's to root out the cause so that God
[21:48] can can get down in our life and begin
[21:51] to get down and work in us and change
[21:53] us. You you got to identify the root
[21:56] cause before you can get anywhere. And
[21:58] brother Baron would say if a doctor, you
[22:00] know, you sometimes you have these
[22:02] doctors that are quote practicing
[22:03] medicine and maybe there'd be one that
[22:05] say, "Well, perhaps you got
[22:07] appendicitis." But what if it's not and
[22:10] then they put you on the operating
[22:11] table, then they go to operate and they
[22:13] pull out your appendix and that's not
[22:15] really the problem. Then they got to go
[22:16] cut something else out. And of course,
[22:19] we've heard so many stories of here in
[22:21] the United States and overseas and
[22:22] different places where people go to
[22:24] cutting and removing things that they
[22:25] shouldn't and then the person dies and
[22:27] it it actually kills them. Well, see,
[22:29] without diagnosing the case, brother,
[22:31] I'm reading quotes that brother Braman
[22:33] said that would still be unethical. He's
[22:35] got to first find the cause. And now the
[22:38] reason brother Brandham said the reason
[22:40] that I go slow with the patients is the
[22:43] first
[22:44] thing there's something caused that
[22:48] sickness you you think about all the
[22:51] times all the people that come would
[22:52] come up in the prayer lines and brother
[22:55] Ram would just take his time with each
[22:57] individual case so that he could speak
[22:59] to them in a way that would build their
[23:01] faith and identify the things the
[23:03] situations in their life that they had
[23:05] gone through and and discern to them.
[23:07] Now, now that that's brother Brandham
[23:08] with his special gift, but what I'm
[23:10] trying to bring it down to right now is
[23:12] that the word is still a discerner of
[23:14] the thoughts and intents of the heart.
[23:16] And the word can still speak to your
[23:18] need. I I I I've heard so many young
[23:20] people that would say they they said in
[23:22] special meetings and things where where
[23:24] I was talking to Zach just the other day
[23:26] talking about how that the the word is
[23:28] still a discerner that that that that
[23:30] that there's a still a gift that's
[23:32] working in the body that'll be able to
[23:34] speak directly to your need. If you've
[23:36] got a question, there's a God that's
[23:38] still able to answer that question.
[23:40] There's a God that's still able to un to
[23:42] root out what the problem is in our
[23:45] lives. And he said, "You who attend the
[23:47] meetings understand how the Holy Spirit
[23:49] will will reveal to the people hidden
[23:51] sin and so forth that they've done a
[23:54] long years ago or maybe something that
[23:57] they ought not have done or something
[23:58] they ought to have done and did not do
[24:02] and you watch it on the
[24:05] platform, you think, I want maybe just
[24:07] take a moment to just think about what a
[24:10] message that we have heard." Yes, sir.
[24:12] Yes, sir. right? That man was all uh
[24:15] cabaged down and and and bound by all
[24:18] these denominational systems and we
[24:21] didn't know which way to go. And then
[24:22] God sent a message to close up all the
[24:25] loose ends to fill in all the gaps to
[24:28] give us a complete understanding of
[24:30] Jesus Christ. Amen. such that the world,
[24:33] all these worldly ministers, the the
[24:35] denominational
[24:37] ministers have to actually testify that
[24:40] this this is a a greater supernatural
[24:43] outpouring of the Holy Ghost that had
[24:45] ever than had ever been seen almost in
[24:48] the history of mankind. And I want to
[24:50] just read for you some of the things
[24:52] that these these great men of faith had
[24:54] said. TL Osborne said, "God has visited
[24:57] his people for a great prophet has risen
[25:00] up among us." Amen. Amen. William
[25:02] Brandham stood as a prophet of God in
[25:04] our generation. God used him to restore
[25:07] supernatural faith to the church. He
[25:09] introduced the modern era of
[25:11] supernatural ministry. And without him,
[25:13] many of us would never have discovered
[25:15] our own ministries. And and it was Tio
[25:18] Osborne, I believe, that that saw such a
[25:20] great supernatural outpouring in Brother
[25:21] Brandon's life that he he said, "Well, I
[25:23] want that for my own self." And he
[25:25] prayed that God would give him a similar
[25:26] gift. And God did. and and he would he
[25:29] he he had a great healing ministry that
[25:32] when he would go overseas and different
[25:33] places, he would have prayer lines and
[25:35] and because he asked God in faith, God
[25:38] gave him the same the thing that he
[25:40] desired because he saw it in William
[25:42] Brandham's life. And Gordon Lindsay said
[25:45] all look all these critics that that
[25:46] could not help but say something about
[25:49] the supernatural outpouring. Gordon Lind
[25:51] Lindsay said, "Never since the days of
[25:53] the apostles has the supernatural been
[25:55] so evident. The blind received their
[25:58] sight. Cripples threw away crutches. And
[26:00] the deaf heard. Truly, God visited his
[26:03] people through Brother Brandham. FF
[26:05] Bosworth said, "I've traveled and
[26:07] preached divine healing for over 40
[26:09] years, but I have never witnessed
[26:10] anything like what God does through
[26:12] brother Brandham." Amen. It is the most
[26:14] remarkable manifestation of supernatural
[26:17] healing gifts I've ever seen. Tommy, he
[26:19] except no one who witnessed brother
[26:21] Brandham a minister could deny the
[26:23] supernatural power and presence of God.
[26:26] He ministered under an anointing that
[26:28] defied natural explanation. His gift was
[26:31] genuinely apostolic and prophetic. Benny
[26:35] Hinn said, "Thank you, Jesus, for
[26:38] William Brandham.
[26:40] Thank you for Holy Spirit TV and other
[26:43] outlets that we can still view and hear
[26:46] the messages of all your great servants.
[26:50] to think that Benny Hinn is saying thank
[26:52] you God that we can still hear the
[26:55] messages of these people like brother
[26:58] Brandham Marilyn Hickey said yeah he was
[27:01] definitely a prophet he had the most
[27:03] unusual gifting I have ever seen of a
[27:06] knowing like a word of knowledge or a
[27:08] word of wisdom we had my aunt and uncle
[27:11] come up from Dowart Texas to his meeting
[27:13] in Denver because they had a
[27:15] granddaughter who had never walked and
[27:17] they said she never would they came to
[27:18] the meeting and 5,000 thousand people
[27:20] are there. He comes out. He's just a
[27:23] little small man, not very pretentious.
[27:26] And he stands there and he said, "The
[27:28] angel of the Lord will come." I'm
[27:30] thinking, "Oh, sure." I'm just being
[27:32] doubtful. But you could feel it when the
[27:35] angel came. And and this Marilyn Hickey
[27:38] is actually talking to um uh what's the
[27:42] minister's name? Kenneth Kenneth
[27:44] Copelan. I think that's who he was
[27:46] talking to.
[27:47] uh with and all all these all these uh
[27:52] what kind of mental gymnastics that we
[27:54] would have to go through to say that
[27:57] this man's ministry like uh I think it
[28:00] was John MacArthur said was heretical.
[28:03] What kind of mental gymnastics you would
[28:05] have to jump jump through to say that a
[28:08] man where all these people were
[28:10] testifying that this man this man had
[28:13] something supernatural that God was
[28:15] doing in his life. What kind of mental
[28:16] gymnastics you would have to do to say,
[28:18] "Well, the all I'm going to take the
[28:20] word of all these other people and
[28:22] ignore that don't have these kind of
[28:23] signs and wonders in their life and
[28:25] ignore everything that God is doing."
[28:27] And this man you you know you to get to
[28:29] heaven to we've never seen heaven. We
[28:32] don't know what heaven is like. To get
[28:33] to heaven, you're going to have to trust
[28:35] somebody. And I I believe that we can
[28:37] you got to trust Jesus Christ. You got
[28:39] to tr I believe we can trust that Jesus
[28:41] Christ rose from the dead. And you've
[28:43] got to trust a a five-fold ministry to
[28:46] prove to you that Jesus Christ is real.
[28:48] I I want to ask, we got that question
[28:50] laid out in front of us. Who is
[28:52] trustworthy? All these men that said,
[28:54] "Well, he had great signs and wonders,
[28:56] but then at the end of the day, I I I
[28:58] don't maybe his message was heretical.
[29:01] You're going to have to trust somebody.
[29:03] You're going to have to trust Jesus, and
[29:05] you're going to have to trust his
[29:06] messengers." And brother said that that
[29:08] that the things that were in his life,
[29:11] all the things that you could see up
[29:13] there on the platform, the things that
[29:15] are being me witnessed now by by a
[29:18] five-fold ministry, that is God sending
[29:21] his spirit down to reveal the secrets of
[29:24] the hearts of people. To reveal the
[29:27] secrets of the hearts of the people.
[29:28] What purpose does God have for revealing
[29:30] the secrets of the hearts of people? Not
[29:33] to put his thumb on your life. Not to
[29:35] give some man control over you, but for
[29:37] God to be able to break into that sail
[29:40] of life, into that red blood cell, and
[29:42] and change the life that's down there on
[29:45] the inside. To change you, to change you
[29:49] to be like him. Amen.
[29:51] Jesus, when he was on earth, that's how
[29:54] he approached things. That's how he
[29:56] approached situations. He would talk to
[29:58] people and reveal reveal what the root
[30:00] cause was and then begin to deal with
[30:03] them. Right. Right.
[30:05] To think that Jesus would we would meet
[30:07] people in their broken state just like
[30:10] all those people all the children of
[30:12] Israel in the wilderness getting bit by
[30:14] serpents that God would come down and
[30:16] meet them in their broken state and
[30:18] their messed up miserable condition just
[30:21] like our messed up miserable condition
[30:23] where we don't have nothing to offer him
[30:25] but he had come down and he had
[30:27] discerned the root causes of their
[30:29] struggles. Amen. Hebrews 4 4:12 said,
[30:32] "The word of God is quick and powerful
[30:36] and a deser is a discerner of the
[30:38] thoughts and intents of the heart." And
[30:40] I believe that he's still the same
[30:41] yesterday, today, and forever. I believe
[30:43] God is still able to discern our heart
[30:46] if we'll let him. If we won't be
[30:48] resistant, if we won't if we won't
[30:49] respond with stubborn. Well, he better
[30:51] not open up my door of pride. He better
[30:53] not get into my the door of all the
[30:55] things that I'm doing in my home, in my
[30:57] private life. don't open up that door in
[30:59] my private life. But if we'll just let
[31:01] God just roam freely through our life
[31:03] like that sermon brother Aaron was
[31:05] preaching. I want him to be not my
[31:07] savior but my lord. I want him to be
[31:08] everything my all and all. I want him to
[31:10] come in my house and poke through every
[31:12] cupboard, every drawer, every every
[31:14] place in my life, every every everywhere
[31:16] I can go like he did with the woman at
[31:19] the well when he come and he began to
[31:20] have a conversation with her. That's
[31:22] right. He said when Jesus Christ was
[31:24] here, that was his ministry. That was
[31:27] his ministry when he found the woman who
[31:29] was really thirsting for the water of
[31:31] life. That little woman, that little
[31:33] Samaritan woman that was all broken up
[31:35] that she her marriage situation. You
[31:37] talk about a marriage or divorce
[31:39] situation. She didn't even know what it
[31:40] what was up and what was down by the
[31:42] time she come to talk to Jesus. And
[31:44] everybody, nobody even wanted to
[31:45] fellowship with her. A little Samaritan
[31:47] that the Jews, boy, they were so
[31:49] uppidity. We ain't going to fellowship
[31:50] with no Samaritan. The Assyrians bred
[31:52] with the with married off the some of
[31:55] the Jews up there in the north country
[31:56] year thousands of years ago, hundreds
[31:58] and thousands. And ever since then, we
[32:00] ain't we don't even dip our water pot in
[32:02] the well of a Samaritan. Old nasty dirty
[32:05] Samaritan. But here comes Jesus to talk
[32:07] to a little dirty Samaritan. You why did
[32:09] Jesus always talk use the Samaritans? He
[32:11] used a Samaritan for the little the good
[32:14] Samaritan. a good Samaritan that was
[32:16] better than a Pharisee, better than a
[32:18] priest, a little old dirty Samaritan
[32:20] that God could use as an example of what
[32:22] a real genuine Christian should be. A
[32:25] little old a little old ranked
[32:26] Samaritan. And he told this little woman
[32:28] at the well, "Bring me a drink of
[32:30] water." And she said, "Why? It ain't it
[32:33] ain't what going on here? It ain't it
[32:35] ain't customary for somebody like you to
[32:38] associate with somebody like me. If we
[32:40] could, if we could respond to the gospel
[32:42] like that, what are you doing talking to
[32:45] somebody broke and miserable like me? If
[32:48] we'd respond like that instead of bowing
[32:51] up at a preacher trying to preach the
[32:53] truth, and we'd respond like that
[32:55] instead of getting all riled up and all
[32:57] all envious and things in our spirit,
[32:59] then God can do something with us. It's
[33:02] not customary for you to ask such such
[33:04] as that. You're a Jew and I'm a
[33:06] Samaritan. He said, 'Well, if you knew
[33:08] who you were talking to. Now, that's the
[33:10] problem that we've all got, isn't it?
[33:11] When a preacher's preaching the gospel,
[33:13] we fail to realize who it is talking to
[33:15] us. It's many times it ain't the man
[33:17] that studied but labored behind the
[33:18] pulpit, but it's the voice of God
[33:20] speaking to you to unveil the secrets in
[33:23] your life and reveal something that you
[33:25] need that you have need of to give you
[33:27] quickening power. He said, "If you knew
[33:29] who you were talking to, then you'd ask
[33:32] me for a drink." Yes. And now quick to
[33:35] quickly something changed. Now she's
[33:38] interested. Now she wants what he's
[33:40] talking about. You know, the Jews the
[33:43] Jews the the Samaritans were a bunch of
[33:46] nobodies. Like like I was saying, the
[33:48] Samaritans were just a bunch of nobodies
[33:50] just like you and I. But God can take a
[33:52] bunch of nobodies and give them his
[33:56] identity, give them his character, give
[33:59] them his nature. Yeah. You know that's
[34:01] what Acts chapter 15 is talking about
[34:03] when it said after they held their
[34:05] peace, James answered, saying, "Men and
[34:06] brethren, hearken unto me, Simeon hath
[34:08] declared how God at the first did visit
[34:10] the Gentiles to take out of them a
[34:14] people for his name." Amen. Another way,
[34:16] you know, when when you give somebody
[34:18] your name, when Christ gives his name,
[34:20] it's it's his identity. Amen. We don't
[34:23] have an identity, but God gives us his
[34:26] identity. Amen. And you know, you can go
[34:28] all the way back through the Bible and
[34:29] find that same pattern. It's it's like
[34:31] you go back and read these Old Testament
[34:33] stories and it's like God tearing off a
[34:35] seal and saying, "Let let me show you
[34:37] what I was thinking. I was thinking
[34:39] about you hundreds and thousands of
[34:41] years ago." And this is the proof. You
[34:43] can go back in Hosea and read that where
[34:45] where God told Hosea. He said, "Call his
[34:48] name Loami, as a little child that was
[34:50] born, for ye are not my people, and I
[34:53] will not be your God. Yet the number of
[34:55] the children of Israel shall be as the
[34:57] sand of the sea, which cannot be
[34:59] measured nor numbered. And it shall come
[35:01] to pass that in the place where it was
[35:02] said unto them, "You are not my people."
[35:04] There it shall be said unto them, "Ye
[35:06] are the sons of the living God." Oh,
[35:09] tell me that's not talking about us.
[35:11] Tell me that's not talking about a
[35:12] people that you you're not God's people.
[35:14] You had nothing to boast of. You had no
[35:16] genealogy. You had nothing. But God took
[35:19] you and made you his made you his
[35:21] people. That's what in Romans Paul's
[35:23] talking about when he said, "As he saith
[35:25] also in Oz, I will call them my people,
[35:28] which were not my people, and her
[35:30] beloved which was not beloved." And it
[35:32] shall come to pass that in the place
[35:34] where it was said unto them, "Ye are not
[35:36] my people. There shall they be called
[35:38] the children of the living God." And
[35:40] first Peter says, "But ye are chosen
[35:42] generation, a royal priesthood and holy
[35:45] nation, a peculiar people, that you
[35:47] should show forth the praises of him who
[35:49] have called you out of darkness into his
[35:50] marvelous light, which in time past were
[35:53] not a people, but are now the people of
[35:56] God, which have not obtained mercy, but
[35:58] of now have obtained mercy." Now, that's
[36:00] the scene that's unplay that's playing
[36:02] out there at the well is this little
[36:04] Samaritan that ain't nothing. She ain't
[36:06] nobody, but God thought about her before
[36:09] the foundation of the world. And you
[36:11] meant nobody this morning, but God
[36:13] thought about you before the foundation
[36:14] of the world. And it's written about you
[36:16] there in OC Hosea that he thought the
[36:19] people that were not my people, they're
[36:20] going to be my people. I'm going to
[36:22] claim them. I'm going to they're going
[36:24] to look at like that brazen serpent.
[36:26] They're going to look at the sacrifice
[36:27] that I made and I will give them my
[36:30] identity. I will give them my name.
[36:32] They'll be called Christians. I'll give
[36:34] them I'll give them my character. I'll
[36:37] give them my characteristics. You want
[36:39] to know what the evidence of the new
[36:40] birth is? There it is. That you're like
[36:43] Christ. You walk like Christ. You've got
[36:45] his name. You've got his nature. You got
[36:47] his everything. All these st stories are
[36:49] to prove that God had you on his mind
[36:52] before the foundation of the world. And
[36:54] God had the woman at the well and the
[36:57] Samaritans on his mind. Go get your
[37:00] husband. I see what he did. The first
[37:04] thing he went right straight to the
[37:06] reason that she couldn't drink the
[37:09] water.
[37:10] She got thirsty when he said, "If you
[37:13] knew who I was, who I was, you'd be
[37:15] asking me for water. Now she's thirsty,
[37:17] but she can't drink the water. And go
[37:20] get your husband." Before she could have
[37:23] this water, there was a reason here.
[37:27] You you know Jesus talked to that woman
[37:29] at the well and when she became
[37:30] convinced and she everything was worked
[37:33] out then she went and told down to the
[37:34] Samaritans. She told all the Samaritans
[37:37] and that little woman at the well was
[37:39] laying the the groundwork for Jesus.
[37:42] When Jesus went to the Samaritans and he
[37:43] he he the Bible said he never did any
[37:46] miracles. That they believe they
[37:48] believed him without any miracles, any
[37:50] signs and wonders. All he did was preach
[37:53] the word to him. And one day in Acts
[37:55] chapter 8, Philip wound up in Samaria
[37:58] and and all that groundwork had been
[38:00] laid. All the ground had been toiled up
[38:02] and they received the word that Philip
[38:05] preached and they were filled with the
[38:06] Holy Ghost. Oh, you see how God works
[38:09] through thing. He works it out maybe
[38:11] slowly over time talking to the little
[38:13] woman at the well. The woman at the well
[38:14] goes down and witnesses tell everybody
[38:16] come see a man that told me everything
[38:18] that I did. The groundwork's being laid
[38:20] and the groundwork's being laid and you
[38:21] and I like all the years of preparation
[38:24] until one day something could strike in
[38:27] a moment in a twinkling something can be
[38:29] fulfilled in the word of God. And
[38:31] brother said see how God worked the
[38:32] thing he diagnoses the case gets rid of
[38:36] everything and then comes right down and
[38:39] lives into man himself. And he said now
[38:42] that's what God wants to do here
[38:44] tonight.
[38:45] He wants to get rid of all the sin
[38:49] that's in this group. If there's sin in
[38:53] here now you think about what a promise
[38:58] God wants to get rid of all of our sin.
[39:01] And one place brother Ram said that we
[39:02] should be a we should desire to live a
[39:04] life such that nobody can point a finger
[39:08] at our life. You think other place he
[39:11] said that you can live so close to God
[39:12] the devil can't do nothing with you.
[39:14] Right. And that that's what the seals
[39:17] are about. The seals reveal that there's
[39:19] iniquity in you and that God can by the
[39:22] word can dispel it out of your soul. And
[39:25] then but there's still iniquity
[39:26] remaining in the rest of your members.
[39:28] And God slowly begins to work that
[39:30] process out. And by that process, as the
[39:33] seals are revealed, as they're open, now
[39:35] you can tell the difference between the
[39:37] true and the false. where before maybe
[39:40] when you were a little baby you kind of
[39:41] stumble at things and you weren't quite
[39:43] able to tell the difference between the
[39:45] two natures. But now when the tr when
[39:47] the church begins to be able to discern
[39:49] the two spirits working in the framework
[39:51] of the church then you will be an
[39:54] invincible army and the revelation of
[39:56] the seven seals reveals gives that
[39:58] understanding to the church where you
[40:00] can see where you come from and you can
[40:02] see what God has done in your life and
[40:04] how he has changed you and how he's
[40:06] purged the sin in your life. the
[40:08] iniquity in your life and now you have a
[40:11] a greater a higher understanding a
[40:13] supernatural understanding of how these
[40:16] things work. And brother said there's no
[40:18] other sin but unbelief. It's not a sin
[40:21] to do things like drinking and smoking
[40:22] and gambling and prostitution. Now, now
[40:24] see this these things were given to us
[40:26] to help us. Yes, because if there's
[40:28] something that you're struggling with
[40:30] it, it's not the thing that you're
[40:32] struggling with that you that you really
[40:34] it it's it's it's something else, right?
[40:37] Something deeper. And the something
[40:39] deeper when that is resolved, it will
[40:42] take care of everything else. Well, I
[40:44] can't get rid of the alcohol. I can't
[40:46] get rid of the smoking. I can't get rid
[40:48] of looking at things online that I
[40:49] shouldn't. I can't get rid of I can't I
[40:51] can't get rid of my stubbornness. Well,
[40:54] if you let the life of God come into
[40:56] your heart, begin to change you, then
[40:58] everything will work itself out.
[41:01] He said there's no other sin but
[41:03] unbelief. All those things, that's not
[41:05] sin. That's the result of sin. That the
[41:07] reason you do that is because you are an
[41:09] unbeliever.
[41:11] Smoking cigarettes and using tobaca.
[41:15] I I'm reading through all this list and
[41:16] I'm thinking and as I'm reading them of
[41:18] somebody I know that God delivered from
[41:21] these things that they thought it was
[41:23] impossible and then one day just a
[41:26] moment the the the desire to smoke that
[41:28] vape left them the desire to smoke that
[41:31] alcohol and they just couldn't get away
[41:32] from it left them gambling committing
[41:35] adultery engaging in sexual sexual
[41:37] immorality fornication stealing or theft
[41:41] cursing swearing using abusive language
[41:44] or lying or telling falsehoods. Look
[41:47] what brother Ram said. All all these
[41:48] things they're they're fruits that down
[41:51] on the inside there's there's a nature
[41:54] that's making you act this that way and
[41:57] it manifests as a fruit. He said you
[42:00] can't make a wheat stalk become a
[42:01] cocker, could you? No. So there's no way
[42:03] of doing it. It's just the life in it is
[42:05] wheat. So it produces wheat. And if
[42:09] you're born of the spirit of
[42:11] God, if you're born of the spirit of
[42:13] God, you're a Christian. And you can't
[42:16] do nothing but bear Christian fruits.
[42:19] Amen. That's all. That's just the whole
[42:23] thing. If you're a Christian, you can't
[42:26] do nothing but bear Christian fruits.
[42:28] Amen. Now, now you we know we know it
[42:31] takes it takes time for it to come to
[42:32] mature. That's this whole the whole
[42:34] sermon of the restoration of the bride.
[42:36] the doctrine, the bark is restored, the
[42:38] leaves are restored all the way up until
[42:41] now you got the fruit being restored.
[42:43] It's kind of hard to tell there's fruit
[42:44] in a little baby crying like you know we
[42:47] just had our little grandbaby and she
[42:49] don't know what's you know she can't
[42:50] talk you know it's kind of hard to see
[42:53] it would be kind of hard to see fruits
[42:54] manifested in her life but let her grow
[42:57] up let her get born again let let God
[42:59] begin to work in her life and you'll see
[43:01] the same fruits the same fruits that
[43:03] brother Ram talked about and the stature
[43:04] of perfect man will God will give a
[43:06] little nudge and and and you'll go I I
[43:08] was talking to Zach the other day about
[43:10] how God was dealing with him to talk to
[43:12] homeless people and and he'll get a
[43:14] little nudge and I hope y'all don't draw
[43:17] up on me about he'll get a little nudge.
[43:19] You're somebody's fixing to ask you for
[43:21] money and when they do pray for them and
[43:24] he'll get out of his truck and there's
[43:25] somebody right there. I want some money
[43:27] and he'll sit there and talk to him for
[43:28] 10 or 15 minutes and and by the end of
[43:30] the thing they they they realize that
[43:33] that that God's thinking about them and
[43:35] he's telling them what God told him to
[43:37] tell told him to tell them. And see see
[43:39] that's that's fruit. That's proof. And
[43:41] and see, that's why it ain't it ain't
[43:43] just learning and doctrine and theology
[43:45] and things, but it's a living a living
[43:47] reality where God wants to come and
[43:49] claim us and do something with our lives
[43:52] so that we're not just just going
[43:54] through the motions, but that God can
[43:55] use our actually use our feet and use
[43:58] our lips and use our our our words to be
[44:01] a testimony to others. Amen. And you
[44:04] think you think one of these one of
[44:05] these fruits that I just want to
[44:07] meditate on for a moment or or or one of
[44:09] these because there's fake fruits and
[44:10] there's real fruits. One of these fakes
[44:13] is is is lying or telling falsehood. You
[44:16] know the the serpents that we're talking
[44:18] about, they typify the lie that was told
[44:20] in the garden. And and the devil the
[44:23] devil when he when he's working in
[44:25] somebody, he'll get them off kilter and
[44:27] before long they're telling the lie.
[44:29] It's it's it's like a it's a natural a
[44:31] natural followup to doing wrong. You do
[44:33] wrong and and before long now you got to
[44:36] tell your mama and daddy, "No, I I
[44:38] didn't drive over to that city. No, I
[44:41] didn't go down to Atlanta. No, I didn't
[44:44] do that." Or or or or a man or a woman
[44:46] that's that's cheating on their spouse.
[44:48] They go out and do something and they
[44:50] come back home and now they got to now
[44:52] they got to come up with a lie. And see,
[44:54] a lie, a lie, brother, brother would
[44:56] say, even a little white lie, a little
[44:59] white lie is something that is not of
[45:02] God. We we think just a little white
[45:05] lies or something that we can just get
[45:06] away with and well, it don't matter.
[45:09] But you
[45:11] know, a little lie can actually start
[45:15] start you down the path, the wrong path
[45:18] that will take you somewhere like like
[45:20] this story brother Am told. He said he
[45:22] was he was with another minister and he
[45:24] was in this city and he went over to
[45:25] this homeless man on the on the road and
[45:28] and this man was laying there in the
[45:29] street with his one one foot on the
[45:31] bumper of a car and his his head was out
[45:33] on the pavement just just laying there.
[45:35] He said, "I went over to this man and he
[45:38] said it turns out he he was trying to
[45:41] figure out what the root cause was. Why
[45:44] are you like this?" He he talked to him
[45:46] for a while and he could be, you know,
[45:47] he's the one that he could point over to
[45:48] the across the street and say, "I used
[45:50] to be the president of that bank over
[45:51] there, right?" Well, what's what's
[45:54] happened? What's the root cause of your
[45:56] life? And he said, "The liar." You might
[45:58] take one, as I said to a man one day
[46:00] that I thought was telling jokes and
[46:02] come to find out that he told so many
[46:03] lies till he really believed himself.
[46:06] And and I said, "What makes you do
[46:07] that?" And I sat down to talk with him.
[46:09] I said, "I want to ask you, those
[46:11] stories are too wild for people to
[46:13] believe." He said the first one I can
[46:16] ever remember telling he said I was a
[46:17] little boy that was raised in a good
[46:19] home and he said I went out and smoked
[46:20] corn silk cigarettes just to be smart
[46:23] and I'd eat some coffee to take it off
[46:25] of my breath. And he said I'd done it
[46:26] back behind the old chimney behind the
[46:28] house. And he said I'll never forget
[46:30] when mama called me up and said to me,
[46:32] "Sunny, let me smell your breath." And I
[46:34] blowed my breath into her face and she
[46:36] said, "You've eat coffee to take
[46:38] something off your breath. What have you
[46:39] been doing? Have you been smoking
[46:41] cigarettes?" And he said, "Something
[46:43] told me to tell her the
[46:46] truth." He said, "But I said, "No, mama.
[46:48] I crossed my heart. I ain't been smoking
[46:51] cigarettes." And he said, "And from that
[46:54] time, that started it." A lie is a lie.
[46:57] Whe whether you think it it's done for
[46:59] good or will cause events to unfold in a
[47:02] way that you prefer, it's still a lie is
[47:04] a lie. And you you know, Brother R would
[47:07] even say you were designed not to lie.
[47:09] Yeah. That's why a lie will cause so
[47:12] spiritual turmoil. If there's a lie in
[47:14] the home, then it just causes everything
[47:16] to get so out of whack. So much that you
[47:18] can put you can hook yourself up to a
[47:20] lie detector and they can tell whether
[47:22] you're lying or not because because it
[47:24] that you you weren't made to lie. So
[47:27] much that if you're if you're telling a
[47:29] lie, your body will vibrate or something
[47:32] will give it off that something
[47:33] something's wrong. And a cop sitting
[47:35] there can say, "Well, you ain't telling
[47:37] the truth. Right? If you're telling a
[47:40] lie, they can put you before a lie
[47:41] detector and your nerves will react. And
[47:44] you think now that a seemingly innocent
[47:46] lie told in childhood can beame this
[47:49] become the starting point of a
[47:51] destructive pattern that changes one's
[47:53] life. And just little lies will just a
[47:56] lie between a a husband and a wife will
[47:58] start to erode their trust between one
[48:00] another. Oh, that's why it's so
[48:02] important. I I remember years ago where
[48:03] brother when we dedicate our children,
[48:06] brother Dale would pray that prayer, you
[48:07] know, that that the whole church is
[48:09] dedicated along with this child to raise
[48:11] it up. Why? Because they're the little
[48:13] child as it grows up in the church,
[48:15] they're actually watching the other
[48:17] people in the church to see what that
[48:20] all these fruits to see if they're going
[48:21] to be truthful, to see how they'll act
[48:24] toward one another, to see if they'll be
[48:26] honest, that they'll behave with
[48:27] integrity because you know lying disrupt
[48:30] it disrupts the whole thing. And in the
[48:32] Old Testament, a liar was not even
[48:34] allowed to live. And a lying spirit, a
[48:37] lying spirit that gets on somebody like
[48:38] these these these serpents, a lying
[48:40] spirit is a real serious matter. It's a
[48:45] real serious
[48:46] matter. I I believe uh uh I I was
[48:49] listening, we were listening to Andrew
[48:50] Glover, and if you had any questions
[48:53] about this, next time he comes, you can
[48:54] ask him about it. But he was telling a
[48:56] story about a friend that he knew that
[48:58] in their house they went into one of
[49:00] their ch we're talking about lying
[49:01] spirits. He went into his his his
[49:04] child's room and there in the room was
[49:07] this big old demon and it was slobbering
[49:10] and drooling just standing there. He now
[49:14] what would you and I do if we went into
[49:16] into a room in our house and he began to
[49:19] what is going on? He he called his he
[49:22] called his father, I think, and and they
[49:24] began to talk. How what his father was
[49:26] asking him have did you let anything in
[49:29] the house and he said, "Well, the only
[49:31] thing that I can think of is I got
[49:35] curious about believe the
[49:37] sign." And I got to looking at the
[49:40] things that they had to say because I
[49:42] was curious what they were talking
[49:44] about. Now, you talking about a lying
[49:47] spirit now. Amen. You open, you crack
[49:50] open the door to a lion spirit and here
[49:53] it comes to try to mess with your kids
[49:56] to try to mess with your family. Amen.
[49:58] To try to break apart to to cause doubt
[50:01] to cause to cause you start because you
[50:03] start meditating on those things. And he
[50:06] said he said I I wanted my child to have
[50:09] understanding of what was going on. So I
[50:11] started saying to this this all this
[50:13] time the spirit standing there in the
[50:14] room all this time and he said he said I
[50:18] I started saying well in the name of
[50:20] William Brandom leave this house and
[50:23] that thing just standing there heaving
[50:24] and panting or whatever till finally he
[50:27] said I rebuke you in the name of Jesus
[50:29] Christ and boom it was gone. Now, you
[50:32] see, we're we're not playing with just
[50:34] flesh and blood, but we're fighting
[50:37] spirits, princip powers, and
[50:38] principalities that that when you open
[50:41] up the door, when you open up the door
[50:42] to the word in your home, the word will
[50:45] begin to have an influence in your home,
[50:46] and it will begin to change things. But
[50:48] you begin to o you open up the door to
[50:50] to other things and and it it will also
[50:54] have an influence in your home. And
[50:56] listen, lying spirits are real. Lying
[50:59] spirits are real. the influences,
[51:02] they're so real that that in this case,
[51:05] the brother was actually standing there
[51:07] looking at it. Lying is actually
[51:09] fundamentally opposed to the nature of
[51:12] God and is a manifestation of an
[51:14] unbelieving, corrupted heart.
[51:16] You know, you think about all those that
[51:18] that scene that we're preaching about
[51:19] that all those serpents there that Satan
[51:22] wants to bring disorder and chaos and
[51:24] and cause disorder and chaos in your
[51:26] life with anxiousness and and worry and
[51:28] all these things. But all it takes is
[51:31] one look at the atonement. One look to
[51:33] bring clarity and identity and a sound
[51:37] mind and peace in the middle of the
[51:39] night amidst all the chaos. Amidst all
[51:42] the everything that devil the devil's
[51:45] throwing at you, brother R would say, if
[51:48] if I put wheat in that field and I go
[51:49] out there and don't see any fruit of
[51:51] wheat, well, I kind of doubt you a
[51:53] little bit. What's he talking about? If
[51:56] he sees somebody that's claiming to be a
[51:57] Christian and and they're telling lies
[52:00] and and they have problems with
[52:02] immorality, they have problems with all
[52:04] these different things and it might be
[52:07] secret might be secret on that something
[52:10] that only you know about it cast doubt
[52:12] on the person's confession. Why? Because
[52:14] the fruit of it proves that what that's
[52:16] what you got in the field. A person to
[52:19] think that a person's true nature or
[52:21] authenticity is revealed by what they
[52:24] produce in their life, their actions,
[52:26] their character, and their overall
[52:28] behavior as opposed to just outward
[52:31] claims or appearances. The fruit is
[52:34] produced because of what you believe,
[52:36] the doctrine that you've taken in. And
[52:38] unbelief is the only thing that can keep
[52:40] you from the kingdom of God. Brother
[52:41] Brand will say, that's right. And the
[52:43] only thing that is sin is unbelief.
[52:46] You say, "Brother Brandham, I quit
[52:47] drinking and I quit doing these things
[52:49] in my evil ways." Well, you did that for
[52:51] one purpose. See, the only thing that
[52:54] calls you to do that is because you
[52:57] become a believer.
[52:59] Oh, tonight, if there's something some
[53:01] kind of a sinful life besetting us, if
[53:04] there's something that those serpents
[53:06] biting at our heels, if we'll just
[53:09] believe God's word, Amen. Look to that
[53:12] look to that brazen serpent because
[53:14] genuine faith will produce genuine
[53:16] fruit.
[53:18] He say now you can say, "Well, I'm not a
[53:20] believer, but I just quit that." Then
[53:22] you're not a Christian. So, you're not a
[53:23] Christian. It don't matter how moral you
[53:25] are. You might to keep all the ten
[53:26] commandments. You might be a good
[53:27] legalist, keeping every rule, but you're
[53:30] still dead. He'd say it like this. Don't
[53:32] turn a new page, but get a new book.
[53:36] Change books, and then God will take
[53:39] care of you from then on. Amen. And then
[53:41] his holy spirit will come into us and we
[53:43] then are his representatives. Then we
[53:45] cannot bear nothing but the Christian
[53:47] fruit if we're dominated by the
[53:48] Christian spirit. What is it? It's
[53:51] life. We're not just preaching something
[53:53] to learn, but we're preaching life. It's
[53:56] blood. That's why this gospel is
[53:58] dripping with blood because it's life.
[54:00] The gospel is dripping with good blood
[54:02] because God gave his life there on the
[54:04] cross so that we would look and live and
[54:06] say, "I believe what you did for me to
[54:09] pave the way." So that that life, that
[54:11] same life could come back into the
[54:12] believer's heart. That he said that
[54:14] Jehovah God that created all those
[54:16] things brought himself down to live in
[54:19] the heart of you and I. Before he did,
[54:21] he had to clean his road. He had to show
[54:23] them law and commandment. Then he had to
[54:25] come down and show them love and then
[54:27] break his way right in the heart of man.
[54:30] And now God is in us. Oh, to think this
[54:33] morning, this afternoon, tonight that
[54:35] God made a way to break into your blood
[54:37] cell. That's right. And change the
[54:39] makeup of your nature.
[54:42] That's what he was talking about there
[54:43] in Ezekiel 36. I'll give you a new
[54:45] heart. I'll take that stony heart and
[54:48] I'll make it a heart of flesh and I'll
[54:50] put my spirit in you and cause you to
[54:52] walk in my statutes. Oh, we're not
[54:55] following a rule book. Like I was
[54:57] telling somebody recently, we're not
[54:58] following a rule book. Well, we got a
[55:00] rule book that tells the women how to
[55:01] dress. a rule book that tells you how to
[55:03] dye your hair or whether or not to dye
[55:05] your hair. A rule book for all the No,
[55:07] it's a heart change. It's a nature
[55:10] change. And that's why second
[55:12] Corinthians said, "As much as you are
[55:13] manifestally declared to be the epistle
[55:15] of Christ ministered by us, written not
[55:18] with ink, but with the spirit of the
[55:20] living God, not in tables of stone, but
[55:22] in fleshy tables of the heart." Amen.
[55:24] Oh, that's why it's not doctrines of
[55:26] theologies because you could sit there
[55:27] like Moses all day long and and read and
[55:30] write on tables of stone and it won't
[55:33] change you. But if you take that gospel
[55:36] and put it into a believer's heart, then
[55:38] it will change them so that now the word
[55:41] is alive in them and it's living out in
[55:43] them. like like like for example with
[55:45] Zach going around to the homeless people
[55:48] like for example all the all the
[55:49] different others that are are are
[55:51] fulfilling the word of God in their own
[55:53] different ways. And look, brother Ram
[55:55] was he used the example of like a bird
[55:57] making his nest. I'm about to close here
[55:59] in just a moment. A bird making its
[56:01] nest. A bird will make his nest and
[56:03] they'll get all its little eggs under
[56:04] it. Like we we go out there and we've
[56:07] got chickens and we'll we'll look at the
[56:09] the chickens will gather all the little
[56:10] eggs up under them. But you know what?
[56:14] It it don't do any good to have a bunch
[56:16] of eggs under a chicken if there ain't a
[56:19] rooster. If the chicken has not been
[56:22] with the male, that egg ain't never
[56:25] going to hatch. That's right. Now,
[56:27] that's the same way with you and I in
[56:28] the gospel. The gospel is not just words
[56:31] and and things to learn, but the gospel
[56:33] is the power and demonstration. It's not
[56:36] just charts and and things to put on a
[56:38] whiteboard and things, but it's actually
[56:40] it's got you got if you're not with the
[56:42] mail, if you're never with the mail,
[56:44] it's never going to come to life. And
[56:46] all you will have is a nest full of
[56:49] eggs. A nest full of eggs that you can
[56:51] point to and say, like last time I was
[56:53] preaching on a pile of sticks, ow, look
[56:55] at all the eggs that I've got. And we've
[56:57] got a lot of chickens in our yard that
[56:59] will they'll they'll lay eggs in the
[57:01] woods and they'll have a great big pile
[57:02] of 50 eggs. And you don't know nothing
[57:05] about it till you stumble on it. And
[57:07] wow, look at all those eggs. But if the
[57:09] chicken ain't ever been with the male,
[57:11] not one of those eggs is going to hatch.
[57:13] You've got to be with the male. In other
[57:15] words, it's got to be a personal
[57:18] transformative experience. Maybe not
[57:20] with sensation, maybe not with emotion,
[57:23] but it's got to be something where you
[57:24] yourself have come in contact with the
[57:27] living God. like Moses at the burning
[57:29] bush, like Paul on the road to Damascus,
[57:31] like all all the others that had their
[57:33] own personal experience because
[57:35] otherwise it's just a cold formal
[57:38] knowledge where you're just going to
[57:39] church, going through the ritual, going
[57:41] through the motions, and you're you're
[57:43] just sitting on your pile of eggs and
[57:45] you never come to life where God comes
[57:48] and brings life and changes it. You can
[57:50] learn and learn and ever learning and
[57:52] never coming to the knowledge of the
[57:54] truth. I I think that's one time maybe
[57:56] one time Um, one of the reasons why
[57:58] sometimes ministers, it seems like
[58:00] they're almost wrestling with the air
[58:02] trying to get people to a place where
[58:04] they can see because you'll never be
[58:06] able to see if you're not born again. If
[58:09] you're not, if you've never been with
[58:11] the male, it doesn't matter how many
[58:13] years you've been in church. It doesn't
[58:15] matter how many doctrines and theo
[58:17] theological understandings you've
[58:19] amassed under your belly. It doesn't
[58:21] matter if you've never been with the
[58:23] male. Brother said, "What you got? You
[58:25] make deacons out of them." bishops and
[58:27] everything else, but you got nothing but
[58:29] a bunch of rotten eggs. The only thing
[58:31] to do is clean out the nest and start
[58:33] over again, right? It'll never be able
[58:35] to do it until we get started. He said,
[58:36] "You want a paradox? You want a paradox?
[58:40] You want life? You have to bring life
[58:43] into it. It takes life to take a dead
[58:46] cold formal believer and make make just
[58:49] a dead cold formal church goer and make
[58:52] them a real alive living Christian. It
[58:56] it took life there when Jesus's body was
[58:58] laid in the grave. Life had to come
[59:00] forth into it for him to come forth out
[59:02] of the grave. Brother Am say we could
[59:04] take the sail and break the sail to one
[59:06] to all the way down and all the way down
[59:09] past all the chemicals and everything.
[59:11] Go further further further down and
[59:13] you're going to come to life. And when
[59:16] God's life comes into you, it changes
[59:18] that thing that you can't even see way
[59:20] down at the bottom of your blood cells,
[59:22] all of your all your mitochondria, all
[59:25] those things, everything that's powering
[59:27] the life then is changed into God's
[59:30] life. You're a time being when you're a
[59:34] time being until you're born again. Then
[59:36] you're eternal being. And the only way
[59:38] you can get it is have part of God in
[59:39] you being eternal life. He that has an
[59:42] ear, let him hear what the spirit saith
[59:44] unto the churches. Uh you know back in
[59:46] there in the garden of Eden when those
[59:47] cherubams they Adam and Eve were driven
[59:49] out and the cherubams actually there was
[59:52] a flaming sword which turned every way
[59:54] to keep the way of the tree of life. And
[59:58] Jesus said I am the way, the truth and
[1:00:01] the life. And so now those same
[1:00:02] cherubams are driving us back to the way
[1:00:06] because the way is Christ. He is the He
[1:00:08] is the way and he is the life. And the
[1:00:11] life is the gospel. Amen. And I'll be
[1:00:14] closing on this. He said, "Now we are
[1:00:16] his hands on earth. We are his eyes on
[1:00:18] earth. We are his gospel on earth." And
[1:00:20] the gospel is not altogether by the
[1:00:22] word. The word made manifest is the
[1:00:24] gospel. Amen. The gospel come not in
[1:00:27] word only, but through power and
[1:00:29] demonstration of the Holy Spirit. Go ye
[1:00:31] into all the world and demonstrate the
[1:00:33] power of the Holy Spirit to all the
[1:00:34] nations. Now, instead of that, what do
[1:00:36] we do? He said, we begin to teach
[1:00:38] theology. In Matthew 24 said, "This
[1:00:41] gospel of the kingdom shall be preached
[1:00:42] in all the world for a witness unto all
[1:00:45] nations and then shall the end come." He
[1:00:48] said that first church, my how they tore
[1:00:50] the world up. The world was almost
[1:00:53] Christianized in one decade. One round
[1:00:57] of disciples. Then they all left it. The
[1:01:00] next round began to organize. The third
[1:01:02] round round about the dark age. Then the
[1:01:04] Catholic Church was formed. And then
[1:01:06] from there they begin theology and out
[1:01:09] come Martin Luther, John Wesley and
[1:01:10] Calvin Knox and I'll come out and
[1:01:12] everything had been based solely upon
[1:01:15] theology. That's right. And they failed
[1:01:18] to get back there. The very thing that
[1:01:20] God told them not to do, they're doing
[1:01:23] it in the name of Jesus Christ. Not
[1:01:25] educate the world, but preach the gospel
[1:01:28] and demonstrate the power of God. Now,
[1:01:31] now that's what what I'm getting to is
[1:01:33] here at the end as I'm about to close.
[1:01:37] He said that man, Dr. Reedhead that
[1:01:40] received the he Dr. Reed Head actually
[1:01:42] wrote a book, How do you get the Holy
[1:01:43] Ghost? And he came to Brother Brandham
[1:01:45] and said, he said he stood in his house
[1:01:48] and he said, "Brother Brandham, he had
[1:01:50] degree after degree after degree, but
[1:01:53] has the teachers been wrong?" He said,
[1:01:55] 'Ive been in and seen them throw the
[1:01:57] furniture and so forth and all this in
[1:01:59] the meetings, what they call the holy
[1:02:01] rollers and so forth, but what I'm
[1:02:03] trying to think of all of this that I've
[1:02:04] seen and all the degrees I've got, he
[1:02:06] said, "My heart's hungering for God."
[1:02:08] There you are in the highest ranks and
[1:02:10] fundamentalism. Now, my heart's hungry
[1:02:13] for God. He said, "Is there such a thing
[1:02:15] as receiving the Holy Ghost after you
[1:02:18] believe?" I think that's one of the
[1:02:20] hardest things for message believers to
[1:02:22] get away from that Baptist idea that as
[1:02:25] soon as you come and sit down in a
[1:02:26] church, you've got the Holy Ghost. But
[1:02:29] Paul said to the Ephesians, have you
[1:02:31] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:02:32] believed? You don't you ain't there
[1:02:35] right when you sit down and warm the
[1:02:36] pew. But it takes it take what what is
[1:02:39] it? It's God cracking open them blood
[1:02:41] cells. Cracking open through
[1:02:44] justification, sanctification, a a
[1:02:46] process so that he can get in there and
[1:02:49] have dominion over your life and fill
[1:02:51] you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:53] Now, that's the question. When Dr.
[1:02:54] Reedhead went over to the to the to over
[1:02:56] overseas and was confronted with the
[1:02:58] Muhamadans, the Muhamadan said, "We we
[1:03:00] got all the the we got the same theology
[1:03:02] you got." He said, "We we've got a
[1:03:05] consolation. You've got a consolation.
[1:03:07] We got joy and happiness. You got joy
[1:03:09] and happiness. We're looking for our
[1:03:11] prophet to come back. You're looking for
[1:03:12] our prophet to come back. We got all the
[1:03:14] same thing. But he said, he said, "Let
[1:03:16] me see your God produce." Now, there's
[1:03:20] the question of the ages. If this is a
[1:03:23] living gospel, we could say the same
[1:03:24] thing like Elijah Elisha did when he
[1:03:26] come to the River Jordan and he took off
[1:03:28] the mantel that Elijah had given. He
[1:03:30] said, "Where is the God of Elijah?"
[1:03:33] Amen. Because if the God of Elijah,
[1:03:35] Elijah might be gone, but if the God of
[1:03:37] Elijah is still here, then the same God
[1:03:39] is able to do the same miracles. The
[1:03:42] same God is able to do the same signs
[1:03:44] and wonders. The same God is able to
[1:03:46] heal you if you're sitting there in your
[1:03:48] sick bed. The same God is able to make
[1:03:51] you make you rise up like the man there
[1:03:54] at the the the pool of Bethesda. the
[1:03:56] same God is able to make you right. I I
[1:03:59] think tonight that we've got the same
[1:04:00] testimony as Peter and John there at the
[1:04:02] gate beautiful when they said look on us
[1:04:05] silver and gold. I ain't got no silver
[1:04:07] and gold but what I do have I give to
[1:04:08] you. And the same thing that they have
[1:04:10] we can give to you tonight because we're
[1:04:12] standing on the resting upon the same
[1:04:14] rock of revelation that'll do the same
[1:04:17] thing that it did back then. Oh, it'll
[1:04:19] produce. I believe that's what my
[1:04:21] testimony is tonight. it'll still
[1:04:23] produce the same way that it always did
[1:04:26] forever. So if you're looking for a
[1:04:27] miracle, look no further because this is
[1:04:29] a miracle working God that we're serving
[1:04:31] as a business that's come forward.
[1:04:33] Whatever you have need of, let your
[1:04:35] faith rise to the place that you can
[1:04:37] accept it because we're not serving a
[1:04:38] dead God that's in the grave in
[1:04:40] Jeffersonville. We're not serving a dead
[1:04:42] God that's in the grave over there in
[1:04:43] Israel, but we're serving a God that's
[1:04:45] alive and well. He's alive and well to
[1:04:47] still perform works. All we have to do,
[1:04:49] what do we have to do? You don't have to
[1:04:51] do nothing but look look and live. Look
[1:04:54] at the atonement. Look at the atoning
[1:04:56] sacrifice. It ain't in your education.
[1:04:59] It's not in your thought theology. It's
[1:05:01] not in your creed. But it's in Jesus
[1:05:03] Christ. Everything we have need of. It's
[1:05:06] in Jesus Christ. Let's stand to our feet
[1:05:09] and worship him a little bit.
[1:05:13] [Music]
[1:05:18] Thank you, Lord.
[1:05:22] If you have a need, we'll be glad to
[1:05:23] pray with you.
[1:05:26] We'll meet you right where your need is.
[1:05:28] I'm pressing
[1:05:30] on the upward
[1:05:33] way. New heights I'm
[1:05:37] ging every
[1:05:40] day. Still
[1:05:44] praying up
[1:05:47] onward. Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:05:53] ground. Lord, lift me
[1:05:56] up and let me
[1:05:59] stand by faith on
[1:06:03] heaven unstable
[1:06:06] land. A higher
[1:06:09] place that I have
[1:06:13] found. Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:06:18] ground. My heart has
[1:06:22] no desire to stay.
[1:06:26] Where doubts
[1:06:28] arise and fears
[1:06:32] dismay. Though some may
[1:06:35] dwell where these
[1:06:38] abound, my prayer, my aim is higher
[1:06:43] ground.
[1:06:45] Lord, lift me
[1:06:47] up and let me
[1:06:51] stand by faith on
[1:06:54] earth's table
[1:06:57] and a higher
[1:07:00] plane that I have
[1:07:03] found. Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:07:08] ground.
[1:07:10] I want to
[1:07:12] scale the utmost
[1:07:15] high and catch a
[1:07:19] gleam of glory
[1:07:22] bright. But still I'll
[1:07:25] pray till heaven I
[1:07:28] found. Lord lead me on to higher ground.
[1:07:35] Lord, lift me
[1:07:37] up and let me
[1:07:40] stand by faith on
[1:07:44] heaven's table
[1:07:47] land a higher
[1:07:50] plane that I have
[1:07:53] found. Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:07:57] ground.
[1:07:59] Lord, lift me
[1:08:02] up and let me
[1:08:05] stand my faith on
[1:08:08] air. Bun's table
[1:08:11] land a higher
[1:08:14] plain that I have
[1:08:17] found. Lord, plant my feet on high your
[1:08:24] ground. Amen.
[1:08:27] Amen. enjoyed that tonight. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:31] All hearts and minds clear tonight.
[1:08:33] Thank you, Lord. Amen. Well, just
[1:08:36] remember each other in prayer and
[1:08:39] looking forward to Sunday. Amen. And
[1:08:42] continue to remember those that are that
[1:08:44] are not with us and ones that are sick.
[1:08:48] And uh pray for us. We'll be traveling.
[1:08:51] We're going
[1:08:52] to brother
[1:08:54] Richie's mom's funeral Friday and the
[1:08:57] different ones be traveling and all
[1:08:59] that. But uh love each one of you. Let's
[1:09:02] just all bow our heads be dismissed in
[1:09:05] word of
[1:09:05] prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[1:09:08] for this time Lord together Lord. This
[1:09:11] word that we've heard tonight Lord Jesus

[1:09:15] we thank you for our brother coming and
[1:09:16] pouring his heart out to us tonight Lord
[1:09:18] Jesus.
[1:09:20] Lord, if we just have faith, Lord,
[1:09:23] Father, just to believe that simple
[1:09:26] childlike faith to believe what you've
[1:09:27] given us, Lord, we can receive it, Lord,
[1:09:31] because it's your desire to give it to
[1:09:33] us. It's it's our bread, Lord. We just
[1:09:35] receive it. And Lord, we just pray that
[1:09:38] you have your your will and way with us
[1:09:40] in everything that we do. Watch over the
[1:09:42] ones as we travel. And father, as they
[1:09:44] go home and we just prepare ourselves

[1:09:55] us. And Lord, let's just be receptive to
[1:09:58] the word, Lord. Lord, in everything that
[1:10:00] we do, Lord, let us be pleasing unto you
[1:10:03] in everything that we say and do. And
[1:10:05] Father, we can show the world Jesus
[1:10:07] Christ, not our not ourselves, Lord, but
[1:10:10] we show the you, Lord. Lord, we just
[1:10:13] want to be a shining light, an example
[1:10:15] in a lost and dying world. Lord, we
[1:10:18] commit ourselves into your hands. In the
[1:10:20] name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. God
[1:10:23] bless you. You're
[1:10:25] dismissed.
[1:10:27] Found
[1:10:28] Lord on high.
