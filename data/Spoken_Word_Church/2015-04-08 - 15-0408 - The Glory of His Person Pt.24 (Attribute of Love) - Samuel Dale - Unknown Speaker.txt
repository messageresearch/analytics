of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to Revelations 1 where we've been reading and then we'll go to John 3 to pick up our thought Aaron told me that little Adam had something in his eye and it's all swelled up and everything so let's just remember especially him when we become to pray about it that it'll be all right amen uh remember now the announcements remember the eastern time Easter time together here on or down at the uh Park in Gillsville they're on the 18th so remember that starting it 1:00 and then you know having to eat we'll be eating about 5: probably in the afternoon fellowshipping together all right then remember on the 4th of July weekend we will be having a cookout here at the church and we'll be having the Lord willing brother Vernon from the Philippines will be with us for the weekend so remember remember that we'll be having uh we may change I was thinking today so we may change we'll see what we'll do wouldn't matter we'll still be having service but we may have a special service on that Saturday instead of it being Bible study we may just go ahead and by Brother Vernon being here we may have a a special service on the Friday and S on excuse me on the Saturday and the Sunday of that that week okay so we will announce that for sure later but is that all the announcements we've got basically the made okay uh Revelations 1 and John 3 remember little Adam and his ey this as we pray father we come to you with a heart of love and understanding for little children Lord and we just ask you that you'd reach down and touch little Adam there Lord take away that problem in his eye we believe you and we thank you we just ask you to manifest yourself in the way to whatever it would be thank you for being with each and every one of us we know that we pray for each one here Lord for the sickness Among Us of the physical needs of our bodies and we know that that we're all wearing out and getting older but we know also every day we're getting closer to thy return so we ask you to just help us and guide each and every one of us be with us tonight as we speak you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction you've been with many who were away and have been Lord to different places and coming back home they're here tonight others will be coming in the rest of the week so we ask you to just bless each one and give a safe journey and keep us all Lord in your grace in Jesus name amen John I mean excuse me Revelations 1 and I turned to see the voice that spake with with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothe with a garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle all right let's go to John this is a very familiar scripture with us but our thought will be taken on this point John 3:16 for God so Lov the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I want to make sure and clear up something to because you may have misunderstood me in what I was saying Sunday I believe I said it correctly but I don't want you to misunderstand me uh there's two comings of the Lord in the Bible the first coming and the second coming but now in the bride part there is actually three parts and I think I said that to making it to where that he come one time to redeem his bride he comes the second time you know to get his bride and he comes the third time with his bride in the millennial Reign you know coming back to be with him and that way then and it would be uh to Israel you only dealing with basically two comings because you know he come back to redeemed now he's going to come and meet them in the Millennium so that would be the basis and I I was hoping you understanding that and I believe I said it but I thought well I'll just have to make sure uh because the prophet would say everything would travel in threes the voice of the sign say first coming of Christ to redeem the bride second coming of Christ to receive his bride third coming of Christ with his bride to rule in the millennial Reign all right so then I was trying to bring that mainly that point to you to uh make sure you know I didn't want you to misunderstand me and say well I I heard him say there's three comings well there there's only two comings it's just the the Life part is a two-part doings because he comes once he comes there to you know pick up his bride and take her in the Rapture all right and then he would come then to deal with Israel and their doings but then he would come with the bride into the millennial Reign so I wanted to make sure and not let that go as something that you'd say well I've heard him say three comments but see there's really only two comings first coming Second Coming the second coming is just in two parts to the bride because it is a part that he becomes so visible Among Us right and he said in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church he becomes so visible Among Us he'll raise the dead and go into Rapture but that's still not Corporal all right so we meet him in the air and then Corporal body though will come in the millennial rain and we will come with him in Corporal bodies like unto his all right make sure that you know that I don't leave you dangling I know that I spend a lot of time uh saying a lot of things trying to get you to a point of thinking about it but I don't want you to misunderstand me all right then what you believe is is left up to you uh you know it's not uh not to me to reveal cuz I can't all right but I want to make sure now too uh I've thought over all of this week long about what I was trying to bring on the services Sunday and and I don't want you to misunderstand uh you know something that would hinder you in a a way of of following on later into the message and uh you know in doing that uh I hope you understand the point that we've tried to bring uh do you understand if you don't just raise your hand and ask a question about do you understand the anointing how that you can actually be Anointed with the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit and still be lost now do you understand that's that's what brother brandham said that's that's not me when none of us was smart enough to even say any of those things but you know to to just to make sure that you you understand those those points and and get it lined up because you know we see we we have been so uh dwelling on the uh Pentecostal people do on the anointing until you know it gets into a point that the prophet had to make a lot of emphasis about it and he believed in the anointing he he was the one that taught us about the anointing he he believed in those things and he expressed it and all like that but then his point was what the anointing can't save you it takes the person of Jesus Christ to come and live in you in the New Birth amen all right see then that anointing throughout the Old Testament as they were back there that anointing would anoint the people and great things would take place but you know it didn't save any of them now it it did in the point that it made a form of salvation but what we mean by when we emphasized it and the prophet would say you would be could do that and be lost he's he's trying to emphasize the point of where you're anointed at and remember in the Old Testament as it says in the scripture there that you know uh the Holy Ghost had not been given because Jesus had not been glorified we see there was no way for those Old Testament Saints to come to that position Adam and Eve started off wonderful with eternal life in their soul but everybody after then no matter if it was Abel or Seth or who you know coming on down after then they would come into the Satan's domain and they would not have eternal life and they'd be no way to get that eternal life into them because it would take the death of the Lord Jesus Christ the releasing of the soul of almighty God to where that it could come back in the form the prophet said of the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost all right now does everybody follow that you're you're you know because that will would help us to understand that you got the difference in the dispensations of the Old Testament and the dispens pensation of the new all right now a lot of people say I don't believe in dispensation well the Bible says calls it dispensations all right and brother brandom certainly believed in dispensation all right so then we're we're going to stay with that and believe it I don't care who the the big name people would be I heard a man say one time I don't believe in dispensations well I didn't ask him what he meant but I just took what he meant as being that he didn't believe in dispensation you know I mean that was the best way I could understand it and uh I thought well surely he's read a little bit you know he's heard a little bit even reading in the Bible it talks about the dispensation all right and see as a Baptist we understood the dispensations you know I mean you know we taught those things back in the Baptist Church and all of the the dispensation of the Old Testament and dispensation of the new and see then that dispensation of the Old Testament they could not be anywhere there that the life of Jesus Christ could come back that's why you had the animal atonement all right now when Jesus Christ came now come on when he came died released his life made a way it ended the killing of the animals right see there wouldn't have been any killing of the animals see had it been that they could had eternal life without the death you know I mean with the way they were going they couldn't even be protected it couldn't be covered they couldn't they didn't even have a sacrifice without that lamb in the Old Testament but they was no soul in that lamb so all that could do it could anoint him and they done great things I was listening today to where brother randam was talking about in the Hebrew Book that they back there you know shter suer and this that and the other and he said it'll be a shame for us one of these days when we stand before those people so you think about it they without it brother who what did he say he said uh get it right which one wasn't job was it Daniel one of them where brother B said there he he kept the victory without the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right and that would see that that go to show so I hope you understand that part because it makes it to where we can follow it and we can we can follow then the point of where sin entered the picture through the point of the spirit real and not through the soul all right but it made once when mankind now that was with Adam and Eve see when the sin happened it was in their Spirit realm all right see then when it would come in the New Testament it could enter into that phase again to seal away the soul away from Satan but until that time would be it would have to remain as to that he could anoint and that's what I I spent one message the morning service explaining the anointing that would be upon your spirit real you know and and that would do great things that I said but it did didn't save anybody back there it didn't take away the desire of David to sin that's right even though he would cry out in his and and he'd say about his soul you know he he longing for God to restore unto him the salvation and the thing but it couldn't get into him enough to be able to change his nature and his ways right even though he could be anointed to all those things and great things would take place but it could not bring them into the kingdom and that's where I was bringing it down to where that we think about see like uh John the Baptist where the Bible said and the prophet emphasizes it that he received the Holy Ghost in his mother's wound well we believe that but the Bible says the least in the kingdom is greater than John well all right now that scripture is telling you something was wrong there that he could be anointed and to be all of those things and could have the baptism of the Holy Ghost from the mother's womb but we'd fail to go on and read the others where it says Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost we see and that puts us in a position then to to where we've got to think over some things and and get them laid in the line to where we can understand and the prophet said you remember if you don't see in every verse he said go back and read it again he said because you missed it but he didn't say if you didn't see Jesus because that wouldn't work because he wasn't back there that way all right and that brought that down to where our understanding would be then of the anointing now this is very valuable for probably Sunday afternoon that the anointing would come upon their spirit and great things would take place but it would still not put them in the kingdom it still wouldn't give them the new birth because Jesus Christ had not died to release that life all right it would take then the Soul of almighty God to be taken from from Christ to be able to come back on you and I you know upon the people to give eternal life but does everybody follow that where he said like on leadership and I I brought these in case we needed them where brother Brown talks about on leadership and he says many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven he said that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven well brother Dale I thought all I needed was the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's true we do need it we've got to have it but you can have the baptism where on your Spirit see now if he hadn't said those other things that went with it look where you and I would have been and in the old days we didn't have the ability to uh search out to find other things and I well remember in the days when we come into the message long in there in the and you know in ' 67 that that was a big topic back then and there was very few people that you know would even discuss it because they they didn't understand it right then as the time went on and we begin to get more tapes and doing things then it began to come out you know I'm like brother Mo was he said that that they heard a take from Brother brandham one day that that Adam and Eve walked out of the garden and said look like there's lost well until brother brandham said something again they had a problem he said then we got a tape where run around and said yeah but how God put the atonement for him well see that's that's where we were all were back there in the understanding so he says you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so that's taken from leadership then he goes on thinking man's filter he says you see that anointing upon the spirit not upon the soul but now you know where the anointing is falling at and then he goes on to and north at not and says they can absolutely have the real spirit of God anointed on that Spirit but still be lost in just as devil possessed as they can be with that Spirit now that's strong isn't it that's right he said that's why you can't tell that woman that it's wrong for her to cut her high and wear pants and the things like that he said because they're anointed well that's what I've said here in the end time you know you can't tell people today because they're anointed you know so they're not going to listen but look what he says about it you know and I remember I think I gave this in Sunday but he says on the Rapture talking about uh not false Jesus is now false Christ anointed ones falsely anointed to the word falsely anointed to the word cuz that's the only way you'll know whether a person's anointed one or not and see then you know as far as what it is I hope we're not Baptist you know we good old Baptist I don't throw anything stones with just what we talked about the way we done you know we talked about that the Holy Ghost come on the day of Pentecost I know I got it I got it because it come on day of Pentecost well now that's that's a lot isn't it that would mean everybody got it well and I'm not you know I'm not throwing stones but I'm telling you that was the truth we got it because it come on the day of Pentecost well is that the way it is now we got it because brother brandom had it I mean is that the way we go with it are we are we going with that see but to be falsely anointed to the word cuz there's nothing wrong with the anointed that's why he calls it the anointed ones at the end time I remember and I'm sure that some of the others sitting here can remember when they used to talk about false anointed ones that was the way everybody done it back in the 60s that it was talk about false anointed ones well then we found out brother Rand said the anointing was not false the person was false right he said balam cus prophesied it was balum that was falsely anointed to the word there was nothing wrong with the anointing it told the truth balam wrote scripture Kus prophesied that Jesus Must Die under that anointing all right but see then it comes down to where he says it like this on the Rapture he's talking about Kus and all had it he said balam had it but that don't have nothing to do with this Insight all right now what's he talking about so he goes to trying to do God a service without his will without being God's will it is possible a man or woman with all sincerity yeah sincerity trying their best to do God a service and stirred it in the wrong wayen right with a genuine anointing of the Holy Spirit upon them but Stir It contrary to God's plan for the age now sincere people well all we got to do is be sincere you know that's why I if it don't do anything in the world I wish it would warn you amen we believe in the anointings there's nobody in this building believes in the anointing of the holy spirit anymore than than I do I've told you about the things that I've seen and what he has done and how he'd stop me and tell me and direct me and Lead Me into things I believe in it but you can do every bit of that and be lost why because you're no more than the Old Testament yeah but brother Dale see that's what people say but but we're not in the Old Testament we're in the New Testament now according to Paul you can't be in the New Testament without the death of the testator is that scripture all right see we knew those things in the Baptist Church all right it wasn't something when I come into the message the problem was was was thinking about the way he was explaining the things but to think about that those Old Testament Saints didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a new birth as a personal experience with Jesus Christ we understood that but we just didn't know see our point was but them poor old people back there they just didn't know how to believe you know all he had to do is believe sincerity he says but you see you say well brother Dale it's just sincerity you can be sincerely lost Eve was deceived what about you and I you remember we're ready to turn the Rapture I put it in twice Brother Anderson looked at me across the thing I said yeah I got it in there twice he said maybe he was going to emphasize it well I didn't mean that much I just put it in but he saids that don't have nothing to do with this inside now when we get down to the real New Birth you'll see how valuable this is because to most people the new birth is just a form called a baptism of the Holy Spirit Well I got the quotes from The Prophet well amen in but like I said if we hadn't found these other quotes that where it speaks of that anointing where would we be well as the prophet said scriptures teaches the anointing you realize what he's saying Kus prophesied balum prophesied David done great things but all that anointing could not get that nature off of David right see then that lets you know where we're headed amen but then he gets on another quote off of the leadership and he's talking about he said but they are false at the bottom of it false at the bottom in other words the center of anything the real doings what about loving God serving God all of your life going to church all of your life praying fasting and be lost now that wasn't what I T that's the teaching of your Prophet so you got to make up your mind to do something but you said but what can I depend on a't but one thing and that's the word right amen all right you can be anointed to all kind of things now he ain't talking about one quote I got in here where he says a denominational anointing all right we can understand that we can understand a false part of a denominational anointing you know it would be contrary to the word but what about a genuine person that loves the Lord serves the Lord all their life and still be lost that's hard to consider isn't it especially when you deal with it's just sincerity I love the Lord oh now come on what did Brother around say you don't love with your body you display it you don't love with your soul it is either love or not you love with your spirit right all right well brother Dale you just make it like that that we don't have nothing if I can do that with you you know what if I can make you think you don't have nothing you know what you don't have nothing uh I remember one time a man on the radio he said nothing from nothing leaves nothing and I thought that's pretty smart if nothing from nothing leaves nothing then you got nothing all right but what about it anointed where he gets on anointed ones at the end time he's talking about the Commandments of God and he met another Prophet Moses another anointed one that had a genuine anointing of the same holy spirit that was upon Moses that's right he was a prophet the Holy Spirit was upon this man his name was balum but see maybe we need to stay on that a while and talk about about it as far as understanding because you say well what can we put it on oh that's what it is brother Dale was a Baptist and and he's not an emotional person so he's putting his evidence on just oh believe it go ahead and think what you want to but remember this man has has taught you from the beginning that I didn't claim when I came into this message I saw immediately I did not have the new birth and for two years I studied and prayed and fasted and cried for God to give me something that I would have an answer to Satan brother Mo said one day he said I don't know what you're seeking I said' I'm not seeking anything you ought to know me he said we just quit doing anything like that and said start confessing because what's the difference your question you you I ain't going to confess that I ain't got it now that's contrary to the Bible and the prophet right because the only way you want me to get it the only way you can be saved is to First confess you're saved the only way you can be healed is first confess you're healed I don't want to lie well you born one what's that got to do with it but you see then that anointing it's D but it cannot save you right right well brother Dale I shouted I spoke in tongues I cried I amen you can do every bit of that and still be lost well what can I put it on then you tell me and I'll put it on and here's what people do with me brother Dale you tell me what to do and I'll do it I'm not going to tell you nothing you know the way I am I'm sorry I've had people to come to me and tell me say I'm going to do so and so what do you think about it so well praise the Lord it don't matter where it's right or wrong because you told me you was going to do it you didn't ask me what I thought about it you told me what you was going to do well just go ahead and do it cuz you're not wanting an answer you're wanting me to agree with you right I ain't going to agree with you it won't work but you see church we think that well we're in the message we've like I told you two years I studied this message almost forsook my family to the point that I just all I done was read I have read six books in one day and listen to two tapes one to work and one coming home well brother Dale then what wound up being your experience the opening of the word please open to me immediately now that was the one that that's the one I get kind of uh a little upset about okay we'll call it that now brother colie come along and he said brother Dale first thing you told me when you said water baptism I seen I'm going to look at him and say you lied because I was there when he seen it it wasn't the first time he read it right it may have been but now I may have to use somebody else because if it was but he's saying okay you see I've been with a lot of you a long time and I've had people to come to me I saw it immediately as quick as quick as I read the prophet I saw it sister Gail shaking her head she knows better than that I remember her statement don't tell me I won't be responsible okay sorry I have too good a memory but listen church that anointing will not save you I hope you're understanding me it never saved them in the Old Testament now come on let's be sensible be right and don't go away saying brother Dale is saying that they was lost I never said that now that you lie if you say I said they was lost that anointing upon them would lead them to the best part that it could lead them but the sincerity in their heart was what God was looking at you want the Bible fart he said your sacrifice and offerings has become a stink in my nostrils but said an honest and a contrite heart is what he was looking for I never taught none of those people was lost Those Old Testament people were sealed Away by their own testimonies right they made it to Paradise by their testimonies and their lives and their doings it's why the prophet said look at them and then look at us Abraham had nothing to put it on but the fact that he heard God say get up and get out of this country amen he got up and took off and I thought we were the children of Abraham a man that believed god without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you didn't know the baptism of the Holy Ghost to teach him he could have the anointing to teach him yes because that deals in it come on when I said maybe we need to stay on anointings for a long time because that anointing on him could teach him great things that's he wrote six books or is it five five books or six books he wrote Genesis Exodus Leviticus number Deuteronomy wrote of his own death before he died evidently did CU he told about it but do you understand we you say it's an anointing it's just a you know what they're say now in the message that the new birth is just the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's been about 10 years Doctrine going if you hadn't run into it well you mean you still in that old stuff wanting to believe in justification s CH baptism and the old ghost I am right there still in the middle of every been that and you say brother Dale what do you think it takes to be born again justification by Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ sanctification of the unclean Spirit going out of you and trying to follow the word and the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the person of Jesus Christ to come and live in you that's right which would be the soul of God coming back on the individual right got remember the animal Soul couldn't save you so it's going to have to be dealing with the human soul all right what are you with me well brother Dale you just don't understand my God my God wouldn't do those things my God is loveing and everything and and he wouldn't do those things the prophet said the bride would be Tried by every word do you need that that's right the Bible says he'll try you brother randam said he I got him lay on my desk if you want him at home he said he'll try you to see whether you'll stay with the word or not try you to see what kind of an attitude you'll have he let something come your way to try you right was that what we gave there the other day on the God of this evil age where he said she'll be Tried by his word the bride see as Adam bride was Tried by the word and Adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but conf confused on one po promise that he's the same yesterday day and forever but failed on one promise I can just see those old human minds and people to why Hebrews 13 ain't wouldn't even back there how could Eve fell on Hebrews 13:8 you failed On Believing him to be the same that he do the same and he keep his word we're going to be Tried by every word and it's not the denomination that's going to try me and you uh-uh folks come on we already have got rid of that a long time ago it's going to take the preachers in this message to try amen right why do all these doctrines went around to try you I was asked that question the other day in the Bible study brother Dale how come you stayed with it well I can throw a lot of stones but I didn't throw one I could say I had it and they didn't but I didn't throw nothing I told him the God's on his truth that's right I told him I said when I met God as a little boy there was nothing to Satisfy My Soul but that God that I met and I've always depended upon him and even when I was in the Baptist Church I depended upon him I had experiences back there of seeing Skies split up in a square and me looking up and seeing things I can spend a lot of time talking about things that happened to smell the presence of the Lord to see an angel in my home three different times I can talk a lot but where is that going to do you any good but if I can preach the gospel to you it can get dwelling enough into your soul to where you can get born again but did you understand let's take that part see but did you understand let me just read it brother randam says on message called Fellowship 62 we're all tried every Christian every son every child that comes to God is Tried by the word see if you'll be loyal to it when The Showdown comes what decision are you going to make that's it and he that cannot stand chastisement goes on with the world he is an ill legitimate child and not a son or daughter of God is that scripture right right you see you can have ever bit of that and not be right you remember there in the Kings Brother Dean used to preach on this one back in the Kings where the King I mean the the the prophet was told don't you go you go down and you deliver your message and don't you eat with them or sleep with them or stay there you get out he goes down he delivers his message but an older Prophet a real older a real Prophet goes and tells him well the Lord told me after he told you now that's where we need to put a little damper on that ain't it if the Lord told me water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right don't tell me he told you father son Holy Ghost is right now don't don't just just don't talk okay that old Prophet said you told me said it but scripture said but he lied to him you know what happened a man went back ate with him and right while he was eating the Spirit came on the old Prophet that had lied to him come on if you want to read it I've got it right here if you'd like to read it off the screen First Kings 13: 6 16 and stting read it down through there and what did he wind up doing the old Prophet said you went wrong boy but don't you think that that man looked at him but said but you told me God told you now I pick on brother colie tonight he comes and tells me the Lord told him to tell me Well now okay if it's right but now what if it's wrong right right now what am I supposed to do well a senior Prophet you know an old a prophet and the Bible he was a prophet of God come and said the Lord told me to tell you I remember a time happening when brother brandom I if I misquote this now you just put it in the right times or the dates or he told that lady she's going to die what it 3:00 I think well Billy Paul went to to a meeting they had or was somewhere or something he come back and he said Daddy it was the Holy Spirit see they told brother brandom said she's not going to die he said okay it's up to you said but God ain't spoke to me that's right that's what the young man should have said the young Prophet should have said hold it old boy God ain't spoke to me well you just stubborn amen what are you but what happened the old Prophet said you've messed up and said you will never go to the suppl of your parents something to that degree you know what he done he left you know what killed him a line right you know what was amazing thing when the old Prophet heard about it he got there and there stood a line and there stood the donkey that the old that the young Prophet had been riding on and the donkey was not hurt the line didn't hurt the donkey he just killed the prophet I thought we believe the line was the word he went against the word and he lost it because of that didn't he all right what do we think about it I've had a lot of people tell me so well brother D you're just so stubborn you won't accept what we say I said the Lord ain't told me I said when he tells me I I'll agree with you if he tells me you're right I'll agree with you then everything will be all right but until then I got to be myself amen me well you just won't accept correction Try Me Try in let's see but you see my point was Sunday and I'm getting is and then we'll just I'll just leave this as the message for tonight my point was one thing right morning service the anointing was wonderful it was right and it was of God and all of that and great wonderful things happened back there but that anointing never saved one person if it did why did Jesus have to come and die right right and as I said while ago you know okay I know what people in their minds run you mean all people got lost I didn't say that that's your own thinking they were saved for the time they were under the atonement was made for them at the time but it never brought them to eternal life in their soul it never brought a new birth all right then we were talking about that you can follow the Christ throughout the word but how many of you was listening over what I was saying could you see something else going on at the same time same time Christ was there the very person of God was in that Old Testament in many forms many times that he appeared to Mel as mesic right as to many things it was not the atonement that made the first I mean not the anointing that made the first atonement it was the love of God that made that see we can look at the anointing but do we see the person can you go back in the Old Testament and read it and see that God was manifesting himself in such a mighty way but it was a hidden Mystery that they couldn't follow they couldn't see see there's some of you that that wouldn't hear then I invite you to go back and listen to the message I tried to bring there Sunday because it would be greater I'm not I'm not trying to repr preach it I'm trying to make sure you understand then you can listen to it if you don't care about listening to it you don't care anyway so okie dokie forget it I'm blunt that's no problem but listen what about the very great attribute of love that God himself and all of those attributes that hung on to him can you look back in the Old Testament and see a person as he's revealing himself the Fourth Man In The Fire wasn't not an anointing amen right it was one like unto the Son of God that's right who was it in all of those things that was leading Moses oh yeah we're good to quote Moses you know about brother Brown saying Moses that it was Christ in Moses amen but you think about what he's saying was the anointing was what made Moses say Lord if you're going to kill them kill me first was it the anointing that done that or was it the person that was leading him there's a lot more to the angel of the Covenant than to just think about a pillar of fire leading the children of Israel Joshua found him standing on the shores over there and he said are you with us or are you against us he said neither one I come take over see we want to put the anointing we can see the anointing that was my whole point we can see the anointing but can we see Jesus Christ coming down through the Old Testament as he's making himself known as almighty God that would appear and disappear would take a form and appear to Abraham and eat a c the attribute of Love is what caused him to sacrifice the first animals the attribute of love was what caused him to do those things back there in the Old Testament that we see those people do cure the anointing of on Moses was a wonderful thing but remember with his anointing are you with me he smoked a rock the second time come on he got water you better think but he done it wrong because that was not the Lord telling him that it was the anointing on the man you remember a man that was Elijah or Elisha and the 42 children that were killed and the prophet said that was not God that's right but he said it was the power the man had in other words the anointing that he could call those shears down and kill them you see you're looking at things like that and destroying things and killing people and doing it because of the great anointing that Samson could kill a thousand Philistines but you're not looking at him as the what he really wound up being when he said Lord restore to me not my eyesight he wouldn't praying for that he said Lord get me back where I'm supposed to be and he pulled that building down on the top of him we don't see the Christ I mean we see the Christ but do we see the person you see I can follow the lord Jesus Christ all the way through the Old Testament and see him in all of those things where he was sparing the people when he would make the atonement that Moses would tell Aaron run among the people that was more than just a Christ the Bible says about him it says to the prophets he said I speak to them but he said not so with Moses he said I speak to him I'm paraphrasing it but you know it's the Bible he said I speak to Moses lip to ear let around said face to face that's the best way of doing it when he saw that theophany that as Abraham saw it he wanted to know more about it when Moses saw it he wanted to know more about it and even though he'd been in the presence of God to do all the things that had happened in his life he still wanted to see him he said okay you can't see my face CU right there end it wasn't time right he said just go stand in the Rock and where was The Rock I I believe it was the same Rock he stood in when he smoted it right that's a good place for him to go go back to the rock that you smok and stand the Rock and I'll go past you and you'll see the back part what do you see the back part of a man something real not just an anointing I know that message come on folks I know what brother Brandon we use the word anointing as the person of Christ come on I'm not dumb on that line I know that because I wouldn't have be where I'm at if I hadn't studied it out that way but I look at the person of God to be revealed in the Bible and one day he walked out there and a man says behold God has come down the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world not an anointing sure the anointing was on on John to bring him to the place to see it when others couldn't see the the dove the lamb the things that he saw that's why he introduced the Messiah but the Messiah is not an anointing right anointing won't save you right matter of fact it's it's one of the ways God does to confuse a lot of people he anoints them I gave you these quotes just reading on with brother Brandon was talking about he's talking about and how that it moved on down the flopping against the lags you know what he talking about Adam and and Eve he said he couldn't stand it and moving down or it moved it down to the very Heart Of God spelled l o v e God so loved he just couldn't see them go he called them back said I'm going to put enmity between your seed and Satan's seed that wasn't anointing the seed of the woman is not anointing it is the very Christ himself the very God he comes on down into a message show us the father I used to think that God was mad at me that Jesus but Jesus loved me but I come to find out that Jesus was the very Heart Of God manifesting his father's love to the people right right amen he comes on down to where he's speaking on spirit spiritual adoption he says now the father today has put the right kind of a tutor over his sons you and I a select none other than the very heart and soul of the Lord Jesus you know what the new birth is the very heart and soul believe of the Lord Jesus coming in you and I now I've got something on that but I can't release it right now I'm sorry Hallelujah I've got to keep going until I get the right thing amen but I know right where I'm standing right there and if you don't think I do when it comes out then you'll know I said it this night all right that tutor is the holy spirit that's not just an anointing that new birth is not just an anointing that's right it is the person of Jesus Christ to come and live in you amen can you look back there now and see what I'm try tried to bring out Sunday that that anointing it couldn't save them it was wonderful but then at the same time that was happening God was revealing himself down through those prophets in the word they were bringing is it right that brother randam said Master peace Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph built the foundation he said but the prophets built the body the body's not done anointing it was a body brought out of the Old Testament according to Hebrews 10:5 they said a body thou Hast prepared me God was building that all the way down through there through those prophets the word they were bringing not just an anointing it finally brought almighty God into a human vessel that's right right but see everybody wants to go on the anointings and thing that's just like you're so suckered in by excuse me for those terminology that's why people follow L of these doctrines that are now that Jesus wasn't god Till The River Jordan but he become anointed on the River Jordan I believe that because that was the anointing that came on him on the River Jordan but that anointing didn't make him God he was born the Bible said Lord the Christ brother Brandon will say Jehovah crying in a cradle he said Jehovah with no teeth you don't listen to them but you see all he want is anointing oh if I just anointed it you know I thought that when the man that said that according to fulfilling Isaiah 61 I think that's right is it Isaiah 61 where the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel brother brandham emphatically they don't want to state that one too much but he emphatically stated the anointing left Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane be glad to give you all of these quotes I think that just rising in the Sun but he said that anointing is to come back in the end time so I want anointing I believe in anointing you know if you're not anointed you won't follow this message I want to be anointed to the word don't you I want the word to open to me that I can see Christ in the word but I can also see God's plan of love from the beginning that he came all the way down through That Old Testament just letting out slowly but nobody catching it cuz they're looking at the anointed they're blinded by it the people of this message are blinded by the anointing well I brother he's got great signs and W and old brother Dale just as Carl and and and it's all right doesn't bother me hope it don't bother you we just keep right on going down the road and when the question was asked me about what kep me I said because of my love for that God that I saw and I always wanted to see more has guided me and kept me all of these years that love that he had for me that I have for him it doesn't make no difference whether it's my family agrees with me or not I must walk alone with God a brother told me one day very wonderful brother that left us he said brother Dale I wanted to be close to you I said you can't do that brother I said I can't be that to you I said I can't be that to my own son not what you're talking about I said can't do it I said I got to walk alone brother I said one of these days you'll realize what I'm talking about you think I wouldn't want to be close to my own kids my own son a minister in the gospel I am in the right way of the ministering thing but the brother wanted to be close in a different way he wanted to be my right-hand man ain't nobody can be my right-hand man God is my right-hand man I got to depend on him if I talk that away in front of my own family then you know the honesty and sincerity of my heart that all I desire is one thing and that's to serve him to walk in the light of the love that he he's given unto me and then to try to get you to see that love that he's offering to you through the opening of the word that's the man that I'm talking about that's the man Christ Jesus the revealed word come on Brothers the revealed word what did we read falsely anointed to the word in other words they can't take the word they can't stay with you say the word says it well I I I I need some other way I I I've got to check it out we'll check it out with the word well you going to check it out with I wouldn't there no Pentecost days but I I understood enough people and I listened to them you know a lot of people think they go look and they get they look right in your eye right oh I'm I'm Discerning your spirit I'm not Discerning your spirit I'm smelling your breath I don't mean that silly I mean it to God's Hest truth you can't look somebody in the eye and discern Spirits they ain't but one way you can discern a Spirit come on the word of God is the the only way you can tell what a spirit is right that's right brother brandham says give them the word test you'll find out whether or not they've got the Holy Spirit by giving them the word test right go ahead what do we got brother 341 red book anybody have a need let's Stand Together greater is he that is in me is he that is in

you got to run in the hospital room and wake up everybody that's in that whole Hospital screaming and hollering about the Lord Jesus has healed you I never did see brother brandham do it that way right I never did see the Lord Jesus in the Bible do it that way that's right I thought that was the way we were supposed to be I didn't think we were were uh Jews having to do this out or the other I thought we were Gentiles that just says you know okay Lord I'm a man over Authority and I'm miss that and the other and you just speak the word I thought we believed cuz what is the anointing you know the definition the prophet gave of anointing most of you read it probably hundreds of times Well supreme power in control amen he never said anointing he said all of that anointing God he been running

build told him to lay hands on brother dick or just or is it possible that I could just walk over and lay my hands on okay that's right right the Lord take care of things because he didn't say how to do it he just said do it see I'm talking about that person that was there in the Old Testament that's right why the anointing was so outstanding But Here Comes the person of God walking through that Old Testament right on out until he walked into human flesh and the prophet says he's still here now am so that we believe it Lord Jesus we thank you we just ask you Lord that you would just reach
