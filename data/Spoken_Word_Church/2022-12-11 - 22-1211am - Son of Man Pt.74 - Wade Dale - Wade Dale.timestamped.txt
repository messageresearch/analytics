[15:34] and the Caterers and uh and all the ones
[15:38] that had anything to do with
[15:40] the uh
[15:42] to get together I don't like to say
[15:43] party get together
[15:45] all right so remember now
[15:48] as they're getting ready
[15:50] brother Aaron will be preaching
[15:51] Wednesday night okay
[15:54] all right and then there will be no
[15:56] service on the 25th that will be
[15:59] Christmas Day
[16:01] um December the 28th brother Daniel
[16:04] Martinez will be with us that's uh

[16:13] then on December the 30th oh I want to
[16:16] thank everybody last night for coming to
[16:18] the prayer meeting we had a good little
[16:19] crowd we appreciate it it's it's a time
[16:22] to it's like brother Bob was talking
[16:24] about you know you
[16:26] um
[16:27] you can come to church if you want to we
[16:29] can't make you come to church and we
[16:30] can't make you come to the prayer
[16:32] meeting but it sure does help it helps
[16:34] me to come I don't know whether it helps
[16:36] you it helps me to come
[16:37] so you know it's it's a timer you say
[16:40] well I can pray at home well yeah you
[16:42] can but this is an effort
[16:45] and God sees that effort and when he
[16:46] sees that effort then he'll reward that
[16:48] effort you come to church he'll reward
[16:51] you you don't come to church and guess
[16:52] what that's why a lot of y'all have a
[16:53] lot of problems you do have because you
[16:55] don't come to church
[16:58] if them quotes wasn't enough
[17:00] okay right brother right everybody
[17:03] believe brother Brown was a prophet
[17:04] right there was four screens up here
[17:07] that had had those quotes on it about
[17:09] coming to church
[17:11] so a real true solid Christian will come
[17:14] to church
[17:15] all right
[17:16] and you'll get more solid as you keep
[17:18] coming because God promised he'd do it
[17:20] just like paying tithes if you know
[17:22] someone said one time well I can't
[17:24] afford to pay tithes well yeah I can't
[17:25] afford not to
[17:27] I can't afford not to that comes out
[17:29] first you know you you give the give it
[17:31] to the Lord first
[17:34] okay all right let me make a couple more
[17:36] announcements then you can sit down
[17:38] um December the 30th because of the
[17:40] prayer meeting last night I usually try
[17:43] to have it before we have a meeting and
[17:45] our meeting is going to be on December
[17:46] the 30th on Friday night at seven
[17:48] o'clock
[17:49] that will be December the 30th at seven
[17:52] o'clock brother Wayne Lawson to be with
[17:54] us spoke to him the other day and he's
[17:55] really excited about coming and then on
[17:58] December the 31st we'll have a normal
[18:01] uh watch Night Service so get your songs
[18:03] ready get your testimonies ready uh
[18:06] whatever you want to do brother Wayne
[18:08] will be preaching from probably about 8
[18:10] 30 to whenever and then we will continue
[18:12] to midnight and take communion just like
[18:14] we always do and
[18:17] um y'all need to bring some finger food
[18:18] something small don't bring fried
[18:21] chicken and and and you know turkey and
[18:24] dressing I've had enough of that never
[18:25] mind
[18:27] um just bring some finger foods all of
[18:29] y'all that's been here before you know
[18:30] what to bring so just bring it on
[18:33] December 31st that'll be eight o'clock
[18:34] till 12 o'clock midnight we'll take
[18:36] communion at 12 o'clock
[18:38] and then we will not have a service on
[18:40] January the 1st I'm having an issue with
[18:43] that because they say that what you do
[18:44] on the first day of the year is what you
[18:45] do the rest of the year so they'll
[18:47] brother Bob all them quotes she's
[18:48] talking about about not coming to church
[18:50] but people will be tired uh we'll be
[18:53] here until probably two o'clock in the
[18:55] morning uh fellowshipping so we just
[18:58] won't have church on January the 1st all
[19:00] right
[19:01] also oh brother Trevor Even's called a
[19:04] few minutes ago and he said just tell
[19:05] everybody hello and also one more thing
[19:08] before we get started
[19:10] on February the 11th we were talking
[19:12] about the Valentine's banquet and uh
[19:15] opening it up to bring somebody like
[19:18] brother Donnie said he'd bring his son
[19:20] and his wife uh the reason we're doing
[19:22] that is because of Outreach we're doing
[19:24] this so that people can see the love and
[19:26] see the see the joy that we have
[19:29] um you know the Christmas thing is
[19:31] intimate it's for the tithe parents it's
[19:33] for the people that come to church but
[19:35] the Valentine's banquet it is for child
[19:37] payers and you don't have to pay for
[19:38] anything but if you bring a guest you
[19:41] need to pay the church or bring give it
[19:43] to Terrence or at least that's 30
[19:44] dollars all right that will cover the
[19:46] price pretty close to the price of the
[19:49] caterer all right so you can do that uh
[19:52] bring whoever you want to as long as
[19:54] their husband and wife not wife and wife
[19:56] or husband and husband you have to you
[19:58] have to cover these things you know all
[20:00] right so just whoever you want to bring
[20:03] and then we're going to have uh call
[20:05] Brother Dutch Scott yesterday and he's
[20:07] going to be with us
[20:09] the whole weekend him and sister April
[20:12] are coming and he's going to speak for
[20:13] us for about 20 minutes
[20:15] um on that night of February the 11th so
[20:19] we're going to change it up just a
[20:20] little bit I ask that you do one thing
[20:22] that you help because usually there's
[20:24] only been about 20 couples and that's
[20:26] about 40 people now we figure that we're
[20:29] going to double that probably so we'll
[20:31] need a little more help as far as tables
[20:34] and setting up and getting everything
[20:35] ready I know Anna mama and Lisa and Jim
[20:37] and all the different ones they try to
[20:39] help to get that thing together to put
[20:41] it on it is a it is an event it's not
[20:44] just a gathering it's an event and we
[20:46] appreciate everybody helping and then
[20:48] like I said if you want to bring
[20:49] somebody with you if you're a child bear
[20:51] payer here at church you do not have to
[20:53] pay but if you bring somebody with you a
[20:56] gift a couple then they you need to pay
[20:59] thirty dollars for their meal all right
[21:03] thereby okay with that amen I just think
[21:06] that we can if bring somebody bring your
[21:07] neighbor bring somebody you know that
[21:09] that that don't they even don't know the
[21:11] Lord because we'll have a little
[21:12] ceremony there and then we'll do our
[21:14] games and our prizes and our and our
[21:17] Newlywed Game you all need to start
[21:18] figuring out what color your walls are
[21:20] and what color your sheets are and what
[21:21] color your boy your man your man's shoe
[21:23] size is
[21:27] those questions will not be on that
[21:30] just because I said that right that's
[21:32] right
[21:33] all right well we're getting ready for
[21:35] the play We Like I said before we
[21:36] appreciate
[21:37] all these uh brother Boyd and Sister
[21:39] Janet and the different ones are putting
[21:41] the play on for us today so you may be
[21:43] seated and you need lights off or on
[21:54] oh yes brother and sister Dale last
[21:56] night or yesterday or day before
[21:58] yesterday got their uh their lift chairs
[22:01] and they're probably sitting in them
[22:02] right now watching the service so uh I
[22:06] got in it last night and it's pretty
[22:08] neat I think maybe when I get older I

[22:16] kind of gets you really easy lifts you

[38:37] them strength and being able to marry
[38:39] good Christian men and women and having
[38:42] children and bringing them up in the

[38:45] Bob said we take them to church don't
[38:48] send them take them to church
[38:51] amen so I pray Lord that you just be
[38:53] with us now in the further with this

[39:02] just touched their touch their body Lord
[39:04] and give them something from you father
[39:06] we ask these things in Jesus name
[39:08] amen
[39:10] I was just looking
[39:11] a few minutes ago I told Brother
[39:14] Joe Canada we were right there praying
[39:17] you know we look at um
[39:20] at time
[39:21] the time that we have to do things you
[39:24] know brother Brown always talks about
[39:25] the history talks about how that how the
[39:27] John Wesley's wife had ever had many
[39:30] kids 12 14 15 kids read Bible to them
[39:33] all the time didn't have a didn't have a
[39:35] Singer sewing machine didn't have a
[39:37] Maytag washing machine but she found
[39:41] time and I was looking online I was
[39:43] listening to the sister Astra Playa a
[39:46] Christmas song and do you know that
[39:48] Charles Wesley his brother
[39:50] we say a lot about John because he was
[39:52] the prophet of the day but Charles wrote
[39:54] 6500
[39:57] hymns
[40:02] 6500 and he didn't have Xerox machine
[40:05] either he didn't have a computer that he
[40:07] could look up things he pinned his own
[40:10] notes he pinned his own I'm talking
[40:12] about notes for the piano and the
[40:14] different things he he pinned all that
[40:16] on his own by the inspiration of God and
[40:19] then I thought well Lord you know there
[40:21] was uh I went down a little bit further
[40:23] and said well who's the most famous
[40:25] songwriter I thought Charles Wesley was
[40:27] nope Fanny Crosby
[40:31] blind
[40:33] blind Fanny Crosby wrote 8 000. hymnals
[40:39] and poems
[40:40] to the Lord
[40:42] blind
[40:43] married a husband that was blind they
[40:46] had several children and she
[40:49] attended church
[40:52] they said she attended all the time
[40:54] that's where she got a lot of her
[40:55] inspiration maybe we get some
[40:57] inspiration here today but think about
[40:58] those ones that you'll meet on the other
[41:00] side you know they say Well they're not
[41:02] bride well you don't know that I do
[41:04] believe they were for their time
[41:06] for somebody to write that much
[41:07] inspiration and and and something that
[41:10] we now still sing
[41:12] uh and Fanny Crosby is one of the
[41:14] greatest I mean she wrote all those
[41:15] wonderful uh Blessed assurance and all
[41:18] the different ones and she knows one I
[41:20] know one thing for sure she's not blind
[41:22] today
[41:23] she's not blind today
[41:25] she is not blind she's looking around
[41:27] going man this is what I wrote about
[41:31] it but we'll see her just as sure as
[41:34] you'll see your wife or husband or
[41:35] whoever it is in a few minutes outside
[41:37] you'll see those two and they will be
[41:40] given crowns for writing that for having
[41:43] the inspiration to write these songs
[41:44] that you and I still enjoy today and
[41:47] Charles Wesley wrote a lot of Christmas
[41:49] songs too so he was uh he was a powerful
[41:52] man and his brother was also I'm just
[41:54] giving him a little time for them to all
[41:55] get back in here
[41:57] so we're gonna kind of shorten the title
[41:59] down to son of man because we're still
[42:01] on who is this son of man and we're
[42:02] going to get to that a little bit later
[42:04] but this would be part we'll still
[42:05] continue with part 74. in the beginning
[42:08] was the word the word was with God and
[42:10] the Word was God and the Word was made
[42:12] flesh and walked Among Us
[42:13] we behold his glory the glory the only
[42:15] begotten of the father
[42:16] full of grace and what truth remember we
[42:19] preached on that last Sunday or last
[42:21] time we spoke on truth now let's look at
[42:24] Luke 6 verse 19 we're going to try to
[42:26] get into The Virtue today not to birth
[42:28] Jews all but the one virtue and the
[42:30] whole multitude sought to touch him for
[42:32] there went virtue out of him and he
[42:34] healed
[42:35] them all you may be seated in the Lord
[42:37] has blessing to the reading of the word
[42:39] thanks again for all of you that that
[42:41] had a part in it we appreciate it we
[42:44] thank you so very much I know they're
[42:45] putting stuff together downstairs
[42:47] uh just be patient with them as they
[42:49] come in and out but uh I sure enjoyed
[42:52] that that was good that was good it was
[42:54] a uh a time of reflection that we can
[42:57] reflect back on that
[42:58] God did send us
[43:01] a message from one man that one first
[43:03] first one that came up here and then
[43:06] after then all that
[43:08] I was thinking too do you know hit the
[43:10] the one standing right here in front
[43:13] wrote the Bible
[43:15] wrote the Ten Commandments
[43:17] picked the disciples
[43:19] created the world he did every bit of
[43:22] that
[43:23] all that whole 12 times God had
[43:27] something to do with it
[43:28] Jesus picked the tribes of Israel oh
[43:30] yeah you say no Jesus yeah Jehovah
[43:32] brother Brown said Jehovah the oldest
[43:34] what Jesus of the new we believe in one
[43:36] true and living God right so he he was
[43:40] the one that created all that that you
[43:41] see
[43:42] he was the Creator God
[43:44] and Jesus is his name so let's go now
[43:46] and continue on beloved when I give all
[43:48] diligence to writing to you the common
[43:50] salvation it was needful for me to write
[43:52] unto you and exhort you as brother Bob
[43:54] was talking about exhort we want to we
[43:57] want to we want to persuade you or or
[44:00] try to get you to see the word of God
[44:02] and here we want to see the word of God
[44:05] that you should earnestly contend for
[44:06] what that faith that was once delivered
[44:09] unto the Saints in other words the truth
[44:11] not a truth not a part true but the
[44:14] truth for there are certain men and
[44:16] unawares which we were talking about
[44:17] preachers
[44:19] um you know being an error and dragging
[44:22] you away from God who are before of old
[44:24] ordained to this condemnation ungodly
[44:26] men turn the grace of our God into
[44:28] lasciviousness and denying the only Lord
[44:30] God and our Lord Jesus Christ you know
[44:32] it's not going to be
[44:34] I say this with with with a heavy heart
[44:37] it's not going to be a today of judgment
[44:38] the the drunk that's going to be so
[44:40] surprised
[44:42] he lived that life
[44:45] he knew he didn't know the Lord
[44:47] but what about these people that profess
[44:49] to be Christians
[44:51] and the Bible says the love of God is
[44:53] not in them
[44:54] what about Caiaphas and all the
[44:56] different ones that approach to Jesus
[44:57] and Jesus said you're of your father the
[44:59] devil well where are they going they're
[45:00] not going to heaven
[45:01] right so there is a dividing time and we
[45:04] see the dividing time coming up now and
[45:06] I want to read you this right here I
[45:07] haven't read it before but it's very
[45:09] familiar for all of us so now this
[45:11] messenger of Malachi 4
[45:13] Revelation 10 7 we know who that was
[45:15] it's going to do two things one
[45:18] according to Malachi 4 turn of the
[45:20] hearts of the children to the father so
[45:21] he as we were explaining before we have
[45:24] these great mystery truths that we're in
[45:26] the first church age the second Church
[45:28] age and maybe close to the Third Church
[45:29] age and then what happened man got
[45:32] involved and eroded the truth deluded
[45:34] the truth and I say man Satan through
[45:36] man did that to dilute the truth and
[45:40] make it to where you can do whatever you
[45:41] want to
[45:43] I mean my word come on people there's
[45:45] got to be some kind of Holiness for us
[45:47] to live by if we're going to be holy
[45:49] ghost-filled people all right
[45:51] something's got to be holy that works
[45:53] outward that gives us what Revelation to
[45:57] see what's right and see what's wrong
[45:59] like I said before you look at Pilot
[46:02] pilot pilate said what is truth
[46:05] you've got these they're one to they
[46:08] want to take a murderer
[46:10] Barabbas and let him out of prison
[46:14] and then they want to take supposedly
[46:16] their leader or the people that you know
[46:18] the some of the people enjoyed and they
[46:21] want to kill him and so Paul says what
[46:23] is truth he just didn't have enough
[46:25] information you and I cannot say that
[46:27] today that's right
[46:29] you got to know what's true and Truth
[46:31] has been presented when the when the
[46:33] Seal's broken we'll look at this
[46:35] afternoon I want to bring the seals in
[46:38] with the uh with the uh seven ads
[46:40] remember there's only seven ads facing
[46:42] on an ad it says add to your faith so
[46:46] we're going to start really with virtue
[46:47] is the first virtue because brother
[46:49] Brown said have faith and be born again
[46:51] all right so what's going to happen now
[46:54] what are we under what is our mandate in
[46:56] the end time it's not to just be
[46:57] somebody that's like today's school
[46:59] somebody just you do what you want to
[47:01] and act the way you want to no we have a
[47:03] commission that we're supposed to what
[47:04] go back to the faith of the fathers go
[47:07] back to one true and living God go back
[47:09] to that that's the only reason we want
[47:11] to go back anywhere we want to go get
[47:13] that faith and we kind of profit in the
[47:15] end time go get that faith and he
[47:18] brought that Faith back to me and you so
[47:19] that you and I can have faith
[47:21] all right because it's the face that was
[47:23] once delivered to the Saints in the
[47:25] first churches has now been delivered to
[47:27] the Saints in the end time in this
[47:30] seventh Church age everybody with me
[47:32] two Lord turn the hearts of the children
[47:34] to the fathers
[47:36] he will reveal the Mysteries number two
[47:38] of the seven thunders in Revelation 10
[47:40] don't let that trip you up we're not
[47:41] going to talk about that today but you
[47:43] have to include it in here which are the
[47:45] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[47:47] look it will be these divinely revealed
[47:50] divinely reveal mystery truths not just
[47:53] somebody that just wrote something in a
[47:54] book not Charles Dobson not not yet Max
[47:57] Lucado and all these different ones
[47:59] they're good they're nice they're okay
[48:01] but uh they don't have all the truth
[48:05] they don't have the truth
[48:08] he said it will be these divinely
[48:10] revealed look mystery truths not just a
[48:12] truth a mystery truth
[48:14] that literally turns our hearts back in
[48:17] other words it's going to literally
[48:18] change your body
[48:20] amen this may change your attitude to
[48:22] have you turn back to the faith of the
[48:23] father that may change the way you live
[48:25] the way you act the way you are a
[48:27] Christian in the end time but this right
[48:29] here the opening of those seals are
[48:31] going to what they're going to turn us
[48:32] back to young men and women
[48:35] everybody with me that ought to make you
[48:37] a little bit more happy the older ones
[48:39] are okay about but the young guys are
[48:40] still like man I don't know what you're
[48:42] talking about
[48:43] when you get older right bro Kylie
[48:45] broccoli Smiley amen
[48:48] it'd be these divinely revealed mystery
[48:51] troops that literally turn the hearts of
[48:53] the children to the Pentecostal fathers
[48:55] exactly so and just for a moment we we
[48:58] looked at the word truth
[48:59] and I got some really good comments
[49:02] about this because it's something that
[49:04] one word that you look at and it's so
[49:05] convoluted it's so well as as pilate
[49:09] said what is truth
[49:10] the the Pentecostals are going to church
[49:12] today saying This is truth
[49:15] the methodists are going to church today
[49:17] saying this is true
[49:19] the Baptists are going to church and say
[49:21] this is truth well I'm kind of like
[49:24] pilate what is truth if this is truth
[49:27] and we sprinkle
[49:29] are we Baptist and we baptize or we
[49:33] believe in one or three or two or six or
[49:36] ten or whatever how many gods there's
[49:38] got to be one truth and Jesus said I am
[49:40] the way the truth and the life
[49:42] everything has to what come out of that
[49:44] that's why we're talking about these son
[49:46] of man because that's who that was
[49:47] standing here the son of man went to
[49:49] Calgary
[49:50] God in human flesh went to Calvary and
[49:54] you and I as being what recipients of
[49:56] that we can become part of that son of
[49:58] man
[49:59] in the beginning was the word
[50:01] where was with God the Word was God and
[50:04] that word was made flesh
[50:06] but truth means firmness faithfulness
[50:09] sureness reliability stability
[50:10] continuance faithfulness reliableness as
[50:14] I was listening to Bob this morning
[50:15] reading those quotes see I rest my soul
[50:21] on this word of God
[50:24] I rest my soul that brother Brown was a
[50:26] true prophet
[50:28] not just my body
[50:29] flesh I rest my soul because my
[50:36] my just real easy to walk into Baptist
[50:39] Church with your hair cut and I've seen
[50:42] him walk in you know with girls with
[50:43] shorts on and all this stuff on
[50:45] Wednesday nights and different things
[50:46] they just don't honor they just don't
[50:48] honor the word of God anymore they don't
[50:50] honor that we're going to a place of
[50:52] reverence to what to meet God now they
[50:53] just do like brother Brown said it's
[50:55] just a lodge yes they pay their you know
[50:58] Elks Club fee I hope nobody's in the
[51:00] Elks Club Elk Club face they pay their
[51:02] Elks Club fee they pay their good fellow
[51:04] fee and they're going to go to church
[51:07] come on somebody
[51:09] and they say that's truth
[51:11] but when the Bible is totally against
[51:13] all that so we have to read the bible
[51:15] let the Bible be what our standard
[51:18] yes all right but the hour cometh and
[51:20] now is when the true worshiper
[51:24] true worshiper shall worship the father
[51:27] and what not just spirit because you can
[51:30] have the spirit and not have truth come
[51:32] on
[51:33] Satan has the spirit but not the truth
[51:37] Satan is a spirit you know
[51:39] and he's a worshiper
[51:42] but if you get spirit and Truth together
[51:44] because brother Brown said one time he
[51:45] said Satan cannot stand the truth
[51:48] he hates it that's why he hates us he
[51:50] doesn't hate the world the world's
[51:52] already gone he hates us because what we
[51:54] come to a place that we stand and we
[51:56] stand in a place like brother Bob was
[51:57] talking about we believe
[51:59] Satan if we come to church we're going
[52:02] to make you so mad
[52:04] we're gonna make you so mad but you know
[52:06] what we're going to come back the next
[52:07] day
[52:09] we're going to come back the next
[52:10] Wednesday we're going to come back the
[52:12] next Sunday we're going to we're going
[52:14] to defeat him he's defeated already he
[52:16] just don't know it
[52:18] but we worship in spirit and in truth
[52:20] and God is a spirit and they that
[52:21] worship Him must worship Him in what
[52:23] spirit and truth so we got to worship
[52:25] him the same way that he is
[52:28] and then Jesus says look you shall know
[52:31] the truth
[52:32] so it's not a mystery that that some men
[52:35] say well well I don't really know what
[52:36] truth is or all right you know sitting
[52:38] back over here when he went to Nicene
[52:40] Council I'm sure there was a lot of
[52:41] people had a lot of different ideas but
[52:44] they had to hone it down to one idea
[52:46] right they agreed on though but they
[52:49] agreed oh they agreed on a Creed
[52:53] they took the Bible and said well we
[52:55] don't think we don't know if that's the
[52:57] truth or not all the truth but we'll
[52:59] take this part all right and you shall
[53:01] know the truth and the truth shall what
[53:04] bind you
[53:05] know to make you free
[53:08] people think we're and I still I still I
[53:10] get it but I don't how did people think
[53:12] well y'all just bless y'all poor old
[53:15] June and her family you know she's so
[53:17] bound she's so she's so in prison and
[53:19] well praise God
[53:21] Powell was a prisoner of Christ I want
[53:23] to be a prisoner of Christ I absolutely
[53:26] want to be somebody that God can use and
[53:30] use right in the same way with sister
[53:31] June but the but the world looks at you
[53:34] and says oh you've got to do this and
[53:36] you've got to do that as brother random
[53:39] was saying something say well you don't
[53:40] have to come to church
[53:42] and you think that's out there that's in
[53:44] the message
[53:46] don't have to go to church you can just
[53:48] sit and listen to or watch
[53:50] that's not the way God set it up and you
[53:52] know what when God wrote that that Bob
[53:54] read today he re he wrote that before
[53:57] the foundation of the world brother John
[53:59] knowing that we would have the internet
[54:01] knowing we would have people sit at home
[54:04] trying to get it for theirself
[54:07] I was looking at YouTube yesterday and a
[54:10] thing popped up says
[54:12] um listen to this and it was a tape
[54:14] church and it said tape Church
[54:16] somewhere in Africa and I said no I
[54:18] don't think I listened to that
[54:20] why would I listen to something I can
[54:22] listen to when I want to listen to it
[54:24] not on Sunday and Wednesday or whenever
[54:26] they do it so but anyway
[54:28] but look they have been blinded
[54:32] by the God of this evil age
[54:34] amen and it's not the evil yeah we see
[54:37] evil like the different things that are
[54:38] going on out in the world but the evil
[54:40] the greatest evil is is for us to sit in
[54:43] a
[54:44] sit in a Pew and die
[54:47] that's the greatest evil there is it's a
[54:49] set in the Pew and just die
[54:53] John 14 verse 16 said I will pray the
[54:55] father and he shall give you another
[54:56] comforter that he may abide with you
[54:58] forever what is it the spirit of truth
[55:01] that's why we've been harping every
[55:04] Minister and The Minister's out on the
[55:05] internet and the different ones I've
[55:07] been talking to we have been harping on
[55:09] getting back to the basic getting back
[55:11] to coming to church reading your Bible
[55:13] studying praying because if you can't do
[55:16] the small things you can forget algebra
[55:19] if you can't put one plus one together
[55:21] and get to church on Sunday
[55:27] we're gonna find out our greatest enemy
[55:30] is not the devil
[55:34] it's me
[55:37] my worst enemy I'll listen to me way too
[55:40] much come on somebody I listen to me way
[55:43] too much well let's listen to God every
[55:45] once in a while because he's the truth a
[55:48] minute
[55:50] and I will pray the father and he look
[55:52] God knew every bit of this
[55:55] yes so he put that provision in here
[55:57] that he would come to the Earth and say
[56:00] I'll pray the father
[56:02] and he'll give you another comforter
[56:04] that may abide with you forever what is
[56:06] it the spirit of Truth
[56:08] don't tell me the Holy Ghost has got
[56:10] error in it
[56:13] that same Holy Ghost is the one that
[56:15] said I am the way the truth and the life
[56:17] amen and then when he comes inside of
[56:19] you
[56:20] now listen we still have trouble we
[56:23] still got the spirit realm that we got
[56:24] to deal with but inside of your soul if
[56:27] you're born again today you're just as
[56:29] Eternal as God is you agree with every
[56:30] word that God said because you are God
[56:36] even the spirit of Truth whom the world
[56:38] cannot receive
[56:40] that's why folks I'm telling you don't
[56:43] try to be odd you're just going to be
[56:45] odd
[56:45] the world's not going to understand us
[56:47] the world can't understand how that we
[56:49] strive to do the right thing to to to to
[56:52] speak I was at work the other day
[56:56] we were talking about something
[56:58] they were talking about cursing and and
[57:00] saying bad words and stuff of course
[57:02] they're all Baptists and and nothing so
[57:05] they're they're like well well I can't
[57:07] help it
[57:12] I
[57:14] is the first word they said
[57:16] I can't help it I said well neither can
[57:20] I
[57:21] and they said
[57:23] what
[57:24] I said I can't help it but there's one
[57:29] inside of me that's greater than the eye
[57:32] that shuts my mouth when he wants to say
[57:35] something don't tell me you ain't had an
[57:36] evil thought
[57:37] come on people and you really want to
[57:40] say it to somebody too
[57:45] ouch
[57:46] but that's true but you know what we've
[57:48] got that typos
[57:50] we've got that thing inside of us that
[57:52] spiritual Rudder that says don't do that
[57:54] don't do that
[57:56] and even when we do do something wrong
[57:58] it checks us up right then wait it says
[58:02] no right there
[58:03] take care of that right now and you know
[58:06] what we do we do like brother Dale says
[58:07] oh we sit there and we mulling around in
[58:09] our spirit realm memory region
[58:11] contraceptive imagination
[58:13] imagination
[58:15] and we say no I believe it was that
[58:18] person's fault because I really don't
[58:21] like them
[58:22] and you know what they probably don't
[58:23] like me that's why they said what they
[58:24] did that's why I said what I did that's
[58:26] why we said what each other did we start
[58:27] slinging mud at each other
[58:29] we'll get that in brotherly kind of so
[58:31] don't worry about that but we got to get
[58:32] the spirit of truth but Spirit of truth
[58:34] comes inside because the world will not
[58:35] receive you because it seeth him not see
[58:38] if who he doesn't see the spirit of
[58:39] Truth it sees you
[58:41] and you're supposed to be that born in
[58:43] the same person you're supposed to be
[58:44] that guy that can't you know help it
[58:46] when one little
[58:48] slips out my little XYZ slips out
[58:52] no
[58:55] not if you don't have that in you
[58:56] anymore
[58:58] so I said the unclean Spirit goes out
[59:01] out
[59:03] and we let him back in
[59:06] but you know him for he dwelleth with
[59:08] you
[59:09] and shall be inside of you
[59:11] John 15 26 says but when the comforter
[59:14] has come whom I will send unto you from
[59:16] the father even the spirit of Truth
[59:19] which proceedeth forth from the father
[59:20] look he shall testify of me that's why
[59:23] your life is a testimony
[59:26] your life brother Brown says speaks
[59:28] louder than your words
[59:31] John 17 17 says sanctify them through
[59:34] thy truth Thy word is truth not mine his
[59:39] as thou has sent me into the world even
[59:41] so I have looked sent them into the
[59:43] world Listen Saint John 17 is The Lord's
[59:46] Prayer
[59:48] we can say Psalms is The Lord's Prayer
[59:49] that's okay but Psalm 17 verse 17 that
[59:53] hold John 17 is the Lord praying for me
[59:56] and you knowing that we would be just
[59:58] like
[59:59] Peter Peter I know Satan is going to
[1:00:02] sift you like sand he said but I prayed
[1:00:04] for you
[1:00:06] actress like David being an adulterer
[1:00:08] murderer premeditated murder
[1:00:12] and Nathan says David you're that man
[1:00:15] but what did he say but I have prayed
[1:00:18] for you
[1:00:20] we have Prophet pray for us
[1:00:23] that said that we would make it he
[1:00:25] showed us how to make it that's why God
[1:00:26] had to send us the prophet that shows
[1:00:28] how to make it because we don't know if
[1:00:30] we're making it over here we'll make it
[1:00:31] over here but we know that this message
[1:00:33] is true
[1:00:35] John 17 says sanctify them the only way
[1:00:37] you're going to get Sanctified is
[1:00:38] through the truth
[1:00:39] Thy word is truth as thou has sent me
[1:00:42] into the world even so I have also sent
[1:00:44] them
[1:00:45] so in other words we can't put ourselves
[1:00:47] in the bubble and say
[1:00:49] well I'm a Christian I'm just going to
[1:00:50] go sit in a cave
[1:00:54] Jesus said he sent us into the world
[1:00:59] he sent it why did he send us into the
[1:01:01] world
[1:01:02] why
[1:01:04] to show him
[1:01:06] look
[1:01:08] even so I have also sent them as you
[1:01:10] have sent me into the world what to
[1:01:12] Proclaim who God is I'm going to send my
[1:01:14] friend my people to Proclaim who God is
[1:01:16] and for their sake I sanctify myself
[1:01:19] that they also might be Sanctified
[1:01:22] through some truth
[1:01:24] that's not what it says
[1:01:26] truth be truth
[1:01:29] be true so there is a truth and there is
[1:01:33] the truth
[1:01:35] the truth is what we've been presented
[1:01:37] in the end time because God has given us
[1:01:39] a mandate to get out of here and we
[1:01:41] can't get out here on false Doctrine all
[1:01:43] right
[1:01:44] so third John 1 3 says fire Rejoice
[1:01:48] greatly when the Brethren came and
[1:01:50] testified of the truth that is in thee
[1:01:52] even so thou walketh because look I was
[1:01:55] thinking about this you take brother
[1:01:56] Brown back in the 60s and 50s and I was
[1:01:59] reading some of the
[1:02:00] um I was looking at the word medicine
[1:02:01] and I wrote way back in the 50s and he
[1:02:03] was talking about medicine and for
[1:02:06] another sermon sometime but look I
[1:02:09] Rejoice greatly when the Brethren came
[1:02:11] and testified of the truth now this is
[1:02:12] John
[1:02:13] John goes to Patmos and then he leaves
[1:02:16] Patmos and comes back to the what
[1:02:18] Believers of the church age brother
[1:02:20] Brown said he was the pastor of the
[1:02:22] first church age remember Paul was the
[1:02:23] prophet
[1:02:24] then he died and then John comes back
[1:02:27] from Patmos and lives to be about 96
[1:02:28] years old and he becomes the pastor of
[1:02:31] that Ephesian Church everybody with me
[1:02:33] that's what the prophet of God said
[1:02:35] so that's what he done he come back and
[1:02:37] he's he's just Overjoyed that they're
[1:02:39] walking in truth
[1:02:41] if brother random could look over the
[1:02:43] portal of time today he might not have
[1:02:46] thought so much when he was in and he
[1:02:48] saw a lot of Pentecost he saw a lot of
[1:02:50] confusion but he knew there'd be a truth
[1:02:52] be true and that's who you and I this is
[1:02:55] the product of that
[1:02:57] and I pray that he's smiling today
[1:03:00] that he knows that his children
[1:03:03] and his Brethren are walking in truth
[1:03:05] I have no Greater Joy than to hear that
[1:03:08] my children walk in truth it would be no
[1:03:12] Greater Joy brother John for All My
[1:03:13] Children natural to be walking in truth
[1:03:16] amen so there's no Greater Joy for the
[1:03:18] natural or the spiritual to be walking
[1:03:20] in truth all right
[1:03:22] 1964 the token brother Brown said look
[1:03:24] do you believe that Jesus lives and
[1:03:25] Reigns today congregation says amen do
[1:03:28] you believe what I've told you is the
[1:03:30] truth amen
[1:03:31] it's the token the requirement I only
[1:03:34] can speak what is truth wow
[1:03:37] wow I only speak what I see what I hear
[1:03:41] what's revealed to me watch and why I
[1:03:44] say this of the tens of thousands and
[1:03:46] tens of thousands of times not one time
[1:03:48] has it ever failed to be true how in the
[1:03:51] world could we not could we deny that we
[1:03:54] had a prophet Among Us when Millions
[1:03:56] upon millions of times he used
[1:03:58] discernment to discern and it was not
[1:04:00] wrong one time I don't care if the 12
[1:04:03] people didn't fall off the bridge I
[1:04:05] don't care if they said he was over here
[1:04:07] when he should have been over there
[1:04:08] listen to those tapes
[1:04:11] you listen to those tapes that is God
[1:04:14] Discerning the hearts of the people and
[1:04:17] that can't be error
[1:04:19] that's got to be the truth look he's in
[1:04:21] other words he said God if I told the
[1:04:23] truth you got to come on the same you
[1:04:25] got to come and help us and I'm saying
[1:04:27] today if we have God Among Us and we
[1:04:29] call out for God he's got to come on the
[1:04:31] same he's got to come and reveal his
[1:04:33] word to us he's got to come and give you
[1:04:35] whatever you want
[1:04:37] not one time has it ever fail listen
[1:04:39] I've never seen the word of God fail
[1:04:41] I've seen us fail I've seen me fail but
[1:04:44] I've never seen the word of God fail and
[1:04:46] that's why brother Brown says don't look
[1:04:47] at me I'm a man
[1:04:49] but that was God in a man
[1:04:52] that's like there's God in Me and You
[1:04:54] and he's going to use us
[1:04:56] he said now that has to be God
[1:04:58] that has to be God well would God give
[1:05:00] him Ministry now look at this would God
[1:05:02] give a Ministry like that to somebody
[1:05:03] that didn't know what they were talking
[1:05:05] about
[1:05:07] I don't think so either brother
[1:05:09] power without characters what
[1:05:11] satanic but Power with character
[1:05:14] if it's rule
[1:05:16] and when those people walked up in front
[1:05:18] of him and he'd give him that
[1:05:19] discernment that wasn't brother Adam
[1:05:21] how was God doing
[1:05:22] that was God speaking to us we truly
[1:05:25] have had the voice of God speak to us in
[1:05:27] the end time amen through a man
[1:05:29] and now he's speaking through men and
[1:05:31] women sisters brothers all of us as we
[1:05:34] proclaim the word of God not some Mis
[1:05:36] not some mystery not some some mythical
[1:05:39] something that we might believe one day
[1:05:41] and then it's going to fall tomorrow and
[1:05:43] you got to you know you got these that
[1:05:44] are elevated and then all wants to get
[1:05:46] the swaggers and all them they get
[1:05:47] elevated and all of a sudden you find
[1:05:49] out they ain't what they're supposed to
[1:05:51] be
[1:05:51] it's like everybody same way
[1:05:54] why would God give a Ministry like that
[1:05:56] to somebody that didn't know what they
[1:05:58] were talking about no congregation says
[1:06:01] would he identify himself
[1:06:04] as that Seer there and then turn around
[1:06:06] and give him a mixed up word he's
[1:06:08] telling the people I'm here to tell you
[1:06:10] the truth
[1:06:12] the guy that denies it is the one that's
[1:06:14] mixed up
[1:06:16] all these people is denying the message
[1:06:18] of the hour they're mixed up yes I'm not
[1:06:21] saying they're not born again I'm saying
[1:06:22] they're mixed up
[1:06:24] they've had their Eagle Eye filmed over
[1:06:27] but if it stays filmed over long enough
[1:06:29] they weren't Eagles to begin with
[1:06:31] amen it's the one that's mixed up and
[1:06:34] God ain't mixed up God is his own
[1:06:36] interpreter
[1:06:39] that's my brother Brown would stand on
[1:06:40] the platform he said if God don't come
[1:06:43] in other words I'm gonna make a mistake
[1:06:46] but if God comes
[1:06:49] he can't make a mistake so he could he
[1:06:51] could literally turn his body over to
[1:06:53] God and say all right I don't know what
[1:06:55] I said but it had to be the truth
[1:06:56] because it was him and they tell them
[1:06:58] the house number what color shoes they
[1:07:00] had on the day before where they were a
[1:07:02] week before this the doctor that looked
[1:07:04] at them the doctor had on glasses he had
[1:07:05] on a blue coat they got on a white coat
[1:07:07] I mean it's so detailed because he was
[1:07:09] looking at it because you know what God
[1:07:10] was there
[1:07:12] um
[1:07:13] let's listen
[1:07:15] that part of truth I hope we know what
[1:07:18] truth is I hope we're we're at least at
[1:07:21] least trying to understand what truth is
[1:07:22] and and know that the truth well what
[1:07:25] sets you free not behind you if you're
[1:07:27] bound today you don't have the truth
[1:07:29] if you're bound today you don't have all
[1:07:32] the truth everybody with me all right
[1:07:34] now there's some of us that are bound
[1:07:36] different ways you know I I'm I'm taking
[1:07:38] heart medicine I'm taking you know you
[1:07:39] look at that but now truth I'm not
[1:07:42] bounding the truth is truth that set me
[1:07:45] free
[1:07:46] and if I can just get into that it'll
[1:07:49] heal my diseases that's what the Bible
[1:07:51] says
[1:07:52] so the outside man is a physical being
[1:07:54] which is controlled by six senses or
[1:07:56] five rather the Inside Man is a spirit
[1:07:59] man which is controlled by five senses
[1:08:00] conscious love and so forth in other
[1:08:02] words memory reason Consciousness
[1:08:04] affects imagination then this outside
[1:08:05] guys see tastes feel smelling here but
[1:08:07] the inside of that spirit is a soul
[1:08:10] and that's controlled by one thing your
[1:08:12] free will yes your free will
[1:08:15] you can accept what the devil says or
[1:08:17] accept What God Says and that'll
[1:08:19] determine what spirit is in there wow if
[1:08:23] it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the
[1:08:25] things of God
[1:08:27] if it and it won't feed on anything of
[1:08:30] the world as brother Bob was talking
[1:08:31] about this morning how we we prepare we
[1:08:34] prepare ourselves you know they prepare
[1:08:35] themselves they're getting ready to play
[1:08:37] these big football games and all
[1:08:39] different things they're preparing
[1:08:40] yourself they're getting ready
[1:08:41] they're getting everything they need you
[1:08:43] know and all especially the ones that's
[1:08:44] going to be in the stands you know
[1:08:45] they're going to get their face paint
[1:08:46] out and they're going to get their raw
[1:08:48] raw pom-poms and all that stuff they go
[1:08:50] get all that ready
[1:08:53] did you read your Bible before you came
[1:08:55] to church this morning
[1:08:57] don't raise your hand make him better
[1:08:59] did you pray before you came to church
[1:09:00] did you pray to have a good service
[1:09:01] today
[1:09:03] no some of you didn't because the way
[1:09:05] you're looking at me
[1:09:09] listen
[1:09:11] it is a struggle to get to church
[1:09:14] especially if you got kids
[1:09:17] I'm talking about in the natural part
[1:09:18] it's just a struggle but
[1:09:22] aren't we supposed to be Overcomers
[1:09:25] aren't we supposed to be overcome that's
[1:09:26] what that's where we get our joy and
[1:09:28] that's where we get our peace and that's
[1:09:29] where we get our uh something from God
[1:09:31] when we've what when we've turned it
[1:09:33] over to him
[1:09:34] and let him take care of what's going on
[1:09:36] let him
[1:09:38] remind us to put gas in the car the day
[1:09:42] before
[1:09:43] and not have to stop and put gas and be
[1:09:45] late
[1:09:46] that will do that you know but you know
[1:09:49] what most times you because you forgot
[1:09:51] to do it like I said before you have
[1:09:53] some big operation or something the next
[1:09:55] day I'll guarantee you you're gonna go
[1:09:57] out to the car you're going to turn on
[1:09:58] you're gonna say I got enough gas or I
[1:10:00] don't run the convenience store
[1:10:03] all right so let's let's pray and read
[1:10:05] our Bible before we come to church
[1:10:08] let's prepare ourselves not like his
[1:10:10] brother Bob says it's just place to come
[1:10:12] it's just not just a place to come if
[1:10:15] you don't show up somebody's going to
[1:10:16] say anything about listen you know if
[1:10:17] you're living right or not so
[1:10:20] okay
[1:10:21] so memory reason conscious facts and
[1:10:23] Imagination that's what we're dealing
[1:10:25] with when we start in these virtues with
[1:10:27] faith virtue knowledge temporations
[1:10:28] Godless brotherly kindness
[1:10:30] and love which is not that affection
[1:10:34] we're looking at right there all right
[1:10:36] that affection is as we read before
[1:10:38] that's the affection you have for your
[1:10:39] children you have for your wife it's
[1:10:41] called filial love not agape love all
[1:10:44] right the agape love is agape love it's
[1:10:47] God's love all right everybody with me
[1:10:50] on that and that's what the Capstone is
[1:10:51] that's the love of God and you don't
[1:10:53] wait till you get up there when you get
[1:10:54] born again you have the love of God in
[1:10:56] your soul the only problem is it's kind
[1:10:59] of like getting married you learn to
[1:11:01] love each other
[1:11:02] you don't fall in love and you don't you
[1:11:04] know some of my people How You Gonna
[1:11:06] Take One Life and another life and
[1:11:08] hopefully you've stayed separate until
[1:11:09] you get married but then you've got
[1:11:11] these surprises
[1:11:13] because you've never lived Bob hush
[1:11:16] you've never you've never lived together
[1:11:18] I mean well if you live single
[1:11:21] even even if if somebody something was
[1:11:23] to happen to June or not or maybe vice
[1:11:26] versa and we live you know 20 years
[1:11:29] without a spouse then all of a sudden
[1:11:31] somebody comes up in your life and
[1:11:33] you're like
[1:11:35] no I don't do that
[1:11:38] for 20 years I've got up when I wanted
[1:11:40] to put on what I wanted to
[1:11:42] you want to do what
[1:11:45] see what but you got to learn to love
[1:11:47] all over again that's and that's natural
[1:11:49] down here but now with God's love if you
[1:11:52] really get the love of God you don't
[1:11:54] lose it you build on it
[1:11:57] you build on it you don't lose it you
[1:11:59] don't lose that and then down here we
[1:12:01] know that we lose some of that love and
[1:12:03] even now remember now what happened in
[1:12:05] the first church
[1:12:07] in the Book of Revelations it says you
[1:12:09] what lost your first love
[1:12:11] that was the love that what was put in
[1:12:14] the word of God by John and Peter and
[1:12:16] Paul the different ones the disciples
[1:12:19] they had lost that love that first love
[1:12:21] and it became what
[1:12:24] it became affection
[1:12:27] because I'm gonna tell you something
[1:12:29] a false Doctrine is not agape love
[1:12:34] because some people love their Doctrine
[1:12:36] I do I love mine
[1:12:39] I love my Doctrine
[1:12:41] but I believe it's the truth
[1:12:43] and they love theirs and believe it's
[1:12:45] the truth but when truth was presented
[1:12:47] to us what did we do with it
[1:12:49] did we kick it out or do we say well
[1:12:51] this is the truth amen something
[1:12:53] something's good about this all right
[1:12:55] we'll get to that a little bit more in
[1:12:59] um
[1:13:00] knowledge
[1:13:02] because you got to know for right for
[1:13:03] wrong you got to know whether the word's
[1:13:05] right you got to know whether I'm
[1:13:06] preaching to you just write today or
[1:13:08] preaching wrong or what Bob said today
[1:13:09] was right or wrong you you got to
[1:13:11] discern that all right
[1:13:13] and these virtues are exactly where
[1:13:15] they're supposed to be is everybody okay
[1:13:18] we're going to read this and then we'll
[1:13:19] probably not going to get diversity
[1:13:20] we'll get to it maybe this afternoon
[1:13:21] it's 11 43 now now inside of that is a
[1:13:24] spirit which you become when you're born
[1:13:25] in the earth and the Breath of Life is
[1:13:28] breathed into him that spirit is what of
[1:13:30] a worldly nature
[1:13:32] so there's nothing about you Godly when
[1:13:34] you're born now listen for those of you
[1:13:36] that don't understand if a baby dies it
[1:13:39] goes to heaven why because there's
[1:13:40] nothing to count against it because it
[1:13:43] don't it can't make a choice
[1:13:46] thank God
[1:13:49] I was reading yesterday
[1:13:52] um where the
[1:13:54] um whooping cough
[1:13:56] we talk about the Spanish Flu whooping
[1:13:57] cough and all that that was in the 19
[1:13:59] early 1920s 1900s it killed millions of
[1:14:02] kids
[1:14:04] and even dad's first four uh sisters I
[1:14:07] believe they didn't live past two or
[1:14:09] three months or a year or two because
[1:14:10] they got some kind of something that
[1:14:12] they're secure for now but and they died
[1:14:14] all of them are going to be in heaven
[1:14:17] we can't fathom that but but brother
[1:14:20] Brandon walks up and when he kind of
[1:14:22] goes across the curtain of time or has
[1:14:23] that dream and he says I see this pretty
[1:14:25] young ladies that young lady standing
[1:14:27] there
[1:14:29] and she says daddy don't you know who I
[1:14:31] am
[1:14:32] in other words it was Sharon Rose he
[1:14:33] only shot she died at six months old so
[1:14:35] she never but look in God's mind that
[1:14:37] woman developed to that age that's what
[1:14:40] she would have developed to because that
[1:14:42] was in the mind of God that's what she
[1:14:43] would have developed to if she'd lived
[1:14:45] him at 18 20 years old so thank God
[1:14:48] there's gonna be a lot of people in
[1:14:50] heaven
[1:14:51] there's gonna be a lot of people in
[1:14:53] heaven and how they all gonna fit ain't
[1:14:54] my business
[1:14:56] that's God's business not mine I just
[1:14:59] want to fit in that 1500 Mile Square
[1:15:02] City that's the only one I want to fit
[1:15:04] in that's my home that's my future home
[1:15:06] that's where I'm going to live not come
[1:15:08] in and out that's where I'm going to
[1:15:09] live because every born-again Christian
[1:15:11] is going to live in that City and you
[1:15:13] know what it's not 1600 it's 1500. he
[1:15:17] made it exactly the amount we needed to
[1:15:19] get the people in there he gave Noah the
[1:15:23] exact dimensions to put eight people and
[1:15:26] several animals in that art and no more
[1:15:28] right so God knows best
[1:15:30] the spirit of awareness of a worldly
[1:15:32] nature because what it was not given
[1:15:34] from God but it was permitted by God
[1:15:38] because God's the only one can give you
[1:15:40] breath he's the only one can give it to
[1:15:42] you and he's the only one who can take
[1:15:43] it away from you all right so that
[1:15:44] spirit is of a worldly nature because it
[1:15:46] was not given from God it was permitted
[1:15:48] by God
[1:15:50] and then that permission lasts until the
[1:15:53] age of accountability
[1:15:54] you guys
[1:15:55] when you have free will 12 13 14
[1:15:58] whatever and that's up to the person
[1:16:00] brother Brown says when the person knows
[1:16:02] right from wrong well now we know that
[1:16:04] as a little kid too but when you get up
[1:16:05] to a place where you really that's why
[1:16:08] even even man has set forth rules you
[1:16:11] know you can only drive when you're 16.
[1:16:13] it should be 20.
[1:16:15] and the older one says amen
[1:16:19] but now let me get the older people
[1:16:20] there's a time when y'all don't be
[1:16:21] driving either
[1:16:23] oh hello somebody huh I got everybody
[1:16:28] learn that
[1:16:31] but the law sets that you can that you
[1:16:34] can vote at this certain age because you
[1:16:36] can make a rational decision
[1:16:37] you know you got to be whatever it is 20
[1:16:39] or 21 to drink so you make the right
[1:16:41] you're not an adult you can't make a
[1:16:43] rational decision until this age well
[1:16:45] God's the same way he knows you can't
[1:16:48] make a rational decision until you get
[1:16:49] to this age then you what discern right
[1:16:52] from wrong and then what
[1:16:54] you got a choice you got to make
[1:16:56] amen now you get that for every child
[1:16:58] that's born in the world is born in sin
[1:17:00] shaping liquid come to the world
[1:17:01] speaking lies that's right so that
[1:17:03] person inside there is a center to begin
[1:17:06] with
[1:17:08] now it's got five inlets and those five
[1:17:10] inlets we know whether I can call them
[1:17:11] or not and this memory reason conscious
[1:17:13] facts and Imagination there's five
[1:17:15] elements to the spirit you can't think
[1:17:16] with your body
[1:17:18] you have to think with your spirit
[1:17:21] you can't have conscience in your body
[1:17:24] it has no mental faculty at all this
[1:17:27] thing
[1:17:29] it's all from it all it all just does it
[1:17:31] emulates from the inside what the inside
[1:17:33] says do I move my hands all right
[1:17:36] your body doesn't so you have to think
[1:17:40] with your spirit wow you have to think
[1:17:44] with your spirit
[1:17:47] wow
[1:17:50] you have to reason
[1:17:53] you can't reason with your physical
[1:17:54] being
[1:17:56] because reasoning don't see taste feel
[1:17:58] smelling here reason is what you make up
[1:18:00] in your mind
[1:18:02] so we got a reason today whether the
[1:18:04] word the Bible tells us to come and
[1:18:05] reason together but then the Bible says
[1:18:07] cast down reasoning so we have to
[1:18:08] understand what they're saying come let
[1:18:10] us reason together is to come and talk
[1:18:12] about truth David all right talk about
[1:18:15] truth
[1:18:16] but you have to reason you can't reason
[1:18:18] with your physical body or your physical
[1:18:20] being because reason doesn't see taste
[1:18:22] feel smelling here reason is what you
[1:18:24] can make you make in your mind if you're
[1:18:26] a sleeper you're not your body is lying
[1:18:28] there dead but your spirit can still
[1:18:30] reason and five senses that controls
[1:18:32] that man now the last man that's what I
[1:18:35] want to talk about before we close the
[1:18:36] last man which is the soul there's only
[1:18:38] one sense
[1:18:39] faith it out that's it
[1:18:42] Factor it out
[1:18:43] free moral agency will choose are to
[1:18:47] reject it all right everybody with me on
[1:18:50] that let's read this real quick
[1:18:52] he's talking about the brass serpent it
[1:18:54] wasn't in the brass serpent it wasn't in
[1:18:56] the material that made the brass Circle
[1:18:59] wasn't in the material
[1:19:01] this is material
[1:19:03] that holds you together
[1:19:04] all right though though no thou knowest
[1:19:07] there's no virtue in any man
[1:19:10] we'll talk about in a minute but that
[1:19:12] virtue has to your the man has to give
[1:19:14] it an outlet it has to have an outlet to
[1:19:16] go out of like Jesus was standing on the
[1:19:18] earth and uh the Centurion said I know
[1:19:22] you're a man of of great Authority all
[1:19:24] right same way with Peter Peter said
[1:19:26] look on us Silver and Gold Have I None
[1:19:28] what that was virtue inside of them but
[1:19:30] it what he he calls it in the name of
[1:19:33] Jesus Christ rise up and walk
[1:19:35] not in the name of Peter
[1:19:37] or Paul or William Branham
[1:19:41] there's no virtue in the serpent nor in
[1:19:43] the brass that was made out of or the
[1:19:45] pole The Virtue was doing what God Said
[1:19:49] do
[1:19:50] as Bob said come to church would be the
[1:19:53] first thing for you to start on
[1:20:01] that's all you look at Bob sometimes and
[1:20:04] Bob knows it's it's beating up against
[1:20:07] some people and you look in his eyes
[1:20:10] bless him
[1:20:11] [Laughter]
[1:20:12] because he can say I know you could
[1:20:15] people are just not their head and
[1:20:17] praise the Lord and don't come to church
[1:20:18] for three weeks
[1:20:20] some people touch the Garment of Jesus
[1:20:22] that's the ones that do this all the
[1:20:23] time you know some people touch the
[1:20:25] Garment of Jesus and was made well
[1:20:27] others smacked him in the face and hit
[1:20:29] him in the head look it's the approach
[1:20:31] it's the approach that you make
[1:20:34] when I approached this Pulpit I don't
[1:20:36] approach it as just whatever
[1:20:41] this is the place
[1:20:43] that God is supposed to meet all of us
[1:20:46] not just one person
[1:20:49] and it's correction
[1:20:50] and it's a place to get help
[1:20:53] it's a place to get nourishment if you
[1:20:55] believe it
[1:20:57] if you believe it if thou cans believe
[1:20:59] brother Brown says all things are
[1:21:01] possible all right hit him in the head
[1:21:03] some people hit him in the head with
[1:21:04] sticks and spit in his face he never
[1:21:06] felt any virtue at all
[1:21:09] they were beaten up the Lord Jesus
[1:21:11] that was the most virtuous person that
[1:21:13] lived on the face of the Earth
[1:21:15] and they couldn't feel nothing but
[1:21:17] hatred
[1:21:18] because of what was inside of them they
[1:21:20] felt hatred same thing with me and you
[1:21:22] folks I'm telling you when it comes down
[1:21:24] to the squeeze people are going to hate
[1:21:25] you
[1:21:26] thinking they're doing God a service
[1:21:28] they're going to beat you maybe even try
[1:21:30] to kill you thinking they're doing God
[1:21:32] that's in the Bible
[1:21:34] thinking they're doing God a service not
[1:21:36] thinking they're just drunk they're
[1:21:37] going to run you off the road and kill
[1:21:38] you no no they think they're doing the
[1:21:40] right thing look 68 million Christians
[1:21:42] were killed in the Dark Ages by who
[1:21:44] Christians
[1:21:46] suppose
[1:21:48] what killed by the world it was Crusades
[1:21:51] of Christians so-called men
[1:21:54] dirty people
[1:21:56] it was their attitude of approach we'll
[1:21:58] stop right here magicians get ready to
[1:22:00] come it depends on what attitude you
[1:22:02] come in
[1:22:04] if you come believing that you're coming
[1:22:06] to get help
[1:22:08] and you're confident that you're coming
[1:22:10] to the right person Jesus Christ and
[1:22:12] you're coming his provided way of
[1:22:14] approach you're going to receive
[1:22:16] something if you come reverently
[1:22:21] that's why I mean you may think it's
[1:22:23] silly or not but when we prayed last
[1:22:25] night I didn't want nothing going on
[1:22:26] downstairs I didn't want nothing going
[1:22:28] on in the sanctuary I didn't want to
[1:22:30] stand around hollering and talking
[1:22:32] that's not what it was for last night
[1:22:34] last night was for you to talk to God
[1:22:36] in the quietness of this whole building
[1:22:38] everything quiet all right
[1:22:42] well I'll touch and see if you come say
[1:22:44] well I'll go touch him and see if it
[1:22:46] helps me
[1:22:48] see if it helps me that won't do any
[1:22:51] good
[1:22:52] it's your approach to God's Divine
[1:22:54] article is what does it just like the
[1:22:57] brass serpent musicians come on just
[1:22:59] like the brown serpent the serpent
[1:23:01] didn't have any virtue it was a piece of
[1:23:03] brass look this is a piece of Flesh you
[1:23:07] live in a piece of Flesh brother Branham
[1:23:09] was a piece of Flesh
[1:23:11] everybody with me but God told us
[1:23:15] he was going to use those pieces of
[1:23:17] Flesh to defeat the Devil with
[1:23:23] neither did Paul have any virtue in it
[1:23:26] not a bit
[1:23:27] but it was obeying what God Said do
[1:23:31] yes what brought the power
[1:23:34] what brought the virtue
[1:23:36] is obedience to the word of God
[1:23:41] obedience
[1:23:43] to the word of God let me read this real
[1:23:45] quick everybody stand we'll start
[1:23:47] reading out of the Statue of perfect man
[1:23:48] this afternoon brother Brown said look
[1:23:51] we're not building an organization
[1:23:53] we're not building a Branham
[1:23:55] organization or or or putting him as the
[1:23:58] head Christ is our head
[1:24:00] peace part of it
[1:24:02] I'm not here this morning to build an
[1:24:04] organization
[1:24:05] Christ never sent me to build an
[1:24:08] organization
[1:24:09] Christ sent me to build what individuals
[1:24:12] individuals to the what stature of Jesus
[1:24:16] Christ that they might be
[1:24:19] come on somebody that power has now been
[1:24:21] transferred that they might be the
[1:24:24] PowerHouse and Dwelling Place of the
[1:24:26] Spirit by his work by his words he built
[1:24:28] up the individual to that place now
[1:24:30] build an organization to a greater

[1:26:09] foreign
[1:26:17] goes to a out in the woods and he
[1:26:20] finds this little stream coming there's
[1:26:23] one on my route and I think about it all
[1:26:25] the time it's right on side of the road
[1:26:26] on my on my mail route and it's just
[1:26:28] water coming up out of the ground
[1:26:30] there's a little bitty like a Ledge
[1:26:34] and boy when it rains
[1:26:36] it's like a river
[1:26:38] but when it doesn't rain and it hasn't
[1:26:39] rained for months there's still a little
[1:26:42] trickle coming out and it makes a little
[1:26:44] stream about that wine so it doesn't
[1:26:46] ever stop but I thought brother round
[1:26:49] said
[1:26:50] well said spring if you could talk
[1:26:54] so you come out of that ground for the
[1:26:56] deer
[1:26:57] no even though the deer do get
[1:27:00] nourishment out of my water
[1:27:02] so while you come out of the ground
[1:27:04] because of the squirrels or the rabbits
[1:27:06] or whatever you know he said no that's
[1:27:08] not it
[1:27:10] brother mom said I'd say well well
[1:27:12] spring why
[1:27:14] why are you why is that are you coming
[1:27:16] out of the ground in an odd way because
[1:27:19] Springs are kind of odd they come out of
[1:27:21] the ground where you don't see a river
[1:27:23] running you know it just comes up out of
[1:27:24] the ground
[1:27:25] he said if that spring could talk
[1:27:29] it says there's something inside of me
[1:27:35] the only way that spring can come out of
[1:27:37] that ground because what what is a
[1:27:39] spring is
[1:27:40] utter this down in down in ground
[1:27:42] you hadn't dig a whale you hadn't dug a
[1:27:44] well so it can come up through so you
[1:27:46] can get your water no it's pressure
[1:27:50] and it's found a little crack
[1:27:52] it's found a little bit of something and
[1:27:55] it just keeps pushing and all of a
[1:27:56] sudden it breaks out
[1:27:58] and it starts running
[1:28:00] [Music]
[1:28:02] what is it it's something inside
[1:28:07] it's the pressure from the inside it's
[1:28:11] what pushes that spring out and then the
[1:28:14] deer can drink and then the rabbits can
[1:28:16] drink and then the men can drink oh
[1:28:20] there's a River of Life flowing out from
[1:28:24] me
[1:28:26] [Music]
[1:28:32] doors
[1:28:35] [Music]
[1:28:46] [Music]
[1:28:53] and give to me
[1:28:57] that life
[1:29:17] is
[1:29:36] [Music]
[1:29:38] [Applause]
[1:29:43] [Music]
