[16:20] psalms 1 through 24.
[16:22] i read this the other day
[16:25] this lord put me on it after
[16:27] wade got through speaking the other
[16:29] night i was very touched with what he
[16:31] said and i think it's time for all of us
[16:33] to really step back and we need to look
[16:35] in the mirror and check ourselves out i
[16:37] know i do i can't speak for y'all but
[16:41] my greatest joy is being able to pray
[16:42] for you amen and just being able to
[16:45] speak to the lord about it and i know i
[16:47] have an angel that takes that prayer up
[16:48] there and gets it right because i know
[16:50] i'll get it wrong
[16:51] but he'll get it right and that's what
[16:53] we have to put our faith in and we have
[16:54] to hang on and our faith has really got
[16:56] to grow and it only grows one way is by
[16:58] the taking of the word amen hearing it
[17:01] reading it and becoming a word
[17:03] before we go to the author this morning
[17:05] we'll just say a little word of prayer

[29:16] revelations 3 14
[29:18] this is to this age
[29:20] and the time so
[29:23] and unto the angel of the church of the
[29:25] ladies write
[29:27] these things saith the amen the faithful
[29:30] and true witness the beginning of the
[29:32] creation
[29:34] of god all right let's go to
[29:37] matthew
[29:39] we'll start reading in verse 13.
[29:43] when jesus came into the coast of
[29:45] caesarea philippi he asked his disciples
[29:47] saying
[29:48] whom do men say that i the son of man am
[29:53] and they said
[29:55] some say thou art john the baptist some
[29:58] elias and others jeremiah's
[30:00] are one of the prophets he saith unto
[30:02] them
[30:03] but whom say ye that i am
[30:06] and simon's peter answered and
[30:09] said thou art the christ
[30:11] the son of the living god
[30:14] and jesus answered and said unto him
[30:17] blessed art thou
[30:20] has not revealed this revealed it unto
[30:23] thee
[30:24] but my father which is in heaven
[30:27] and i say unto thee
[30:29] that thou art peter and upon this rock i
[30:32] will build my church
[30:34] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[30:37] against it
[30:39] and i will give unto thee the keys of
[30:41] the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever
[30:43] thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
[30:45] in heaven whatsoever
[30:47] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[30:50] loosed in heaven
[30:51] then charged he his disciples that they
[30:54] should tell no man that he was jesus the
[30:58] christ amen you may be seated the lord
[31:00] had blessing to the reading of the word
[31:03] in summing up all of his uh
[31:06] things about the church
[31:09] and how she's built on the revelation of
[31:11] jesus christ then he ends up telling
[31:13] them says now don't don't tell nobody
[31:15] about the christ
[31:16] uh you know because he knew they would
[31:19] understand
[31:21] that's been the most mysterious part of
[31:23] all is how that god could be
[31:26] made manifest
[31:28] upon the earth
[31:30] in the way that he has
[31:32] and to be able to show himself reveal
[31:35] himself make himself known
[31:38] and starting with that with the christ
[31:40] or last sunday we spent our time trying
[31:43] to speak about
[31:44] the christ and we went through a lot of
[31:47] the scriptures and things you know that
[31:49] thou art the christ the son of the
[31:50] living god
[31:51] and that was who he
[31:53] jesus was declaring himself to be
[31:56] while he was here upon the earth
[31:58] was that christ in you know in doing
[32:02] that then
[32:03] that would be a great mystery
[32:06] in the understanding of the godhead all
[32:08] right what have we been doing on the
[32:10] point are the beginning of creation
[32:13] as we've been back and forth back and
[32:15] forth and we'll keep doing it to make
[32:17] sure you follow the thought pattern
[32:20] that i'm trying to lay down to you
[32:22] and remember what we were dealing with
[32:25] that
[32:26] god's first creation was himself
[32:30] not that he created himself now that's
[32:33] see that's our point of our thinking
[32:35] and we think well god just created
[32:37] himself or god created another person or
[32:40] another doing and and i've been over
[32:42] that and over that with you enough to
[32:44] where you know now
[32:46] that what i'm talking about at the
[32:48] beginning is that when
[32:50] god came down and just stepped over into
[32:53] another form
[32:56] another manifestation
[32:58] another uh point but not another being
[33:03] not another personality or something you
[33:06] know not not making more persons out of
[33:08] it but making it to be the point that
[33:12] that
[33:12] it was god himself
[33:15] moving over into another form
[33:18] and see that way that that does away
[33:20] with what we think about beginning
[33:22] because we look at beginning and then we
[33:24] think well then if you're looking at
[33:25] beginning like this stop and start and
[33:27] etc then
[33:29] your mind will go back
[33:31] to
[33:32] the point that you're uh
[33:36] you'll try to figure out where god is
[33:37] and what he's doing when the best thing
[33:39] to do is just think about what he's
[33:41] saying that's right
[33:43] he just stepped down in another form
[33:46] he just moved into another form he just
[33:48] became into not another being not
[33:50] another person the same god just move
[33:52] into another form
[33:54] well see that way then the godhead will
[33:56] become clearer
[33:58] as we go along to understand you know
[34:02] and then we can get into i'm a father
[34:04] i'm a son i'm a human and i'm you know
[34:07] and all like that
[34:08] as the prophet would be doing it to
[34:11] express the the godhead and and give a
[34:14] great understanding unto us all right
[34:17] but in doing that see he's the beginning
[34:20] of the creation
[34:24] not that they was
[34:26] that he had to create
[34:28] we think create means to take something
[34:30] and make it
[34:32] create you know but not in god it's just
[34:36] uh he doesn't he he can go
[34:38] and the world can come into existence he
[34:40] can he can do anything it's not in that
[34:42] form it's in the form of showing what
[34:44] he's doing for the time
[34:47] and he's always revealed himself and
[34:49] that's why that we kept on emphasizing
[34:51] emphasizing that uh
[34:53] the the father
[34:56] came to
[34:58] uh
[34:59] into being
[35:01] but the way he did was because
[35:03] that he stepped into another form called
[35:06] a son
[35:07] and see we look and i said i keep
[35:10] emphasizing this one to where you can
[35:12] think about it when you think of son of
[35:14] god you'll think about two thousand
[35:15] years ago
[35:17] i mean that's where your mind locks into
[35:19] two thousand years ago son of god
[35:21] when that's not it see the son of god
[35:23] was the first
[35:25] uh
[35:26] creation
[35:29] to come into being
[35:30] or god stepping into another form
[35:33] and he simply just moved from being
[35:35] father
[35:37] no
[35:38] to coming down to being the logos the
[35:41] theophany the word
[35:43] the son of god
[35:45] amen and that can be back before the
[35:47] world never begun
[35:50] see we want to bring it down and put it
[35:51] in a 2000 year bracket to word that we
[35:54] can kind of
[35:55] try to comprehend but we can't do that
[35:58] we got to leave it in the basis of of
[36:00] the understanding of to that point all
[36:03] right and see then
[36:05] as we were bringing those out let's
[36:07] let's get a couple of these and just
[36:08] let's read over this i
[36:10] i know that you you don't like for me to
[36:12] keep reading the same thing but
[36:15] i like to read so go ahead with number
[36:16] one
[36:17] and uh let's just take this part
[36:21] and uh
[36:23] get to that that we can
[36:24] see uh
[36:26] okay
[36:28] now if god created man in his own image
[36:30] and his own likeness what kind of a man
[36:32] did he create
[36:34] a spirit man now if you'll notice after
[36:37] he had made all the creatures creation
[36:40] and created a spirit
[36:41] man
[36:42] the close reading and all
[36:44] i wanted to ask the question god given
[36:46] dominion of the cattle and the fishes
[36:48] and everything to the man all right now
[36:51] naturally that was dire
[36:54] when he made man
[36:56] he naturally gave him the dominion of
[36:59] the animals and the thing but the main
[37:02] way that he gave it to him was through
[37:04] the spiritual creation
[37:06] not the natural it wouldn't the natural
[37:08] man stand out there with a wheel get
[37:10] over there get over there you know no
[37:12] it it was the spirit man
[37:14] that controlled them by love by like the
[37:17] baptism of the holy ghost as he said
[37:18] here
[37:19] all right
[37:20] see the own image to the cattle lead the
[37:23] beasts of the field just like the holy
[37:24] spirit leads the believer today he was
[37:27] in other words adam the first man in the
[37:30] lower creations of god
[37:32] now what in the lower creations
[37:35] of god
[37:37] all right
[37:38] in other words he was the first man
[37:43] earthly speaking
[37:46] see we're going to try to tie two things
[37:48] together today from the spirit man to
[37:50] the natural man
[37:52] all right so then that'll that'll do it
[37:54] we're going from genesis 1 to genesis 2
[37:57] and try to get that in point but look so
[37:59] in other words adam the first man
[38:02] in the lower creations in other words
[38:04] the animals he's explaining the animals
[38:06] and the things that have happened now
[38:09] he's explaining what that adam comes
[38:11] into being
[38:12] that he's the the the first man in the
[38:16] lower or the first of that being
[38:20] now we've got to take two things today
[38:22] and then we'll bring it into the third
[38:24] stage because
[38:26] naturally adam was made physically
[38:29] right
[38:30] all right then but he was made
[38:33] spiritually before then
[38:36] then he was made naturally
[38:38] all right and that'll tie it all
[38:40] together see the first creation was god
[38:42] himself then out of god came the logos
[38:45] which was the son of god
[38:47] all right
[38:48] see god just stepped over in another
[38:50] form
[38:53] like we were talking about we have to
[38:55] kind of do it in a reverse order we were
[38:56] talking about it with brother ray there
[38:58] you know that here he goes through these
[39:00] stages
[39:02] and he comes to a stage that he was a
[39:04] father
[39:06] then he comes to a stage that
[39:08] he's a grandfather
[39:10] all right that doesn't change him
[39:13] it doesn't make any difference in that
[39:15] it's the it's what you're talking about
[39:19] forgive me for coughing
[39:21] all right
[39:22] which was the son of god then out of the
[39:24] logos which was the word
[39:26] so now out of what now the son of god
[39:31] is the word in the beginning was the
[39:34] word and the word with god and the word
[39:35] was
[39:36] the
[39:37] word was with god and the word was god
[39:40] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[39:42] among us
[39:43] out of the logos came forth the man all
[39:45] right the creator
[39:48] he's emphasizing how that man comes into
[39:50] being how did man come into being
[39:55] see jesus we'll get to it in just a
[39:57] minute he's the only begotten
[40:01] all right
[40:02] but adam was the first creation
[40:07] god
[40:08] so you got to keep that straight
[40:10] he was adam was the first creation first
[40:13] one created first human being
[40:16] created made as he was made and we call
[40:20] him in genesis 2
[40:22] that he's the the flesh man
[40:25] all right right and see then when it
[40:27] comes forth it comes forth into showing
[40:30] that he's expressing
[40:32] what it is so then we go on let's go on
[40:35] to number two
[40:36] i want to get these like these first
[40:38] three and keep repeating these where we
[40:40] can can stay on it all right
[40:43] now no man has seen the father at any
[40:45] time no man can see god in the bodily
[40:47] form form because god is not in bodily
[40:51] form
[40:53] all right now whatever you you've got to
[40:56] keep one thing in mind
[41:01] listen no man
[41:03] has seen god at any time all right
[41:07] seen him seeing god in the bodily form
[41:10] because see it was two thousand years
[41:12] ago when the bodily form
[41:16] came into being now melchizedek yes
[41:19] but melchizedek was one thing he was a
[41:22] man being and all but he couldn't die
[41:24] for our sins
[41:25] see it had to be the the special one
[41:28] we'll get to that uh maybe next week
[41:30] because we're going to get to the point
[41:31] of seeing that he was the first of this
[41:34] new race
[41:36] all right
[41:37] he's the beginning of the creation of
[41:39] god he's the first of a new race all
[41:41] right adam
[41:43] was the beginning of the natural
[41:46] creation of mankind
[41:49] right
[41:51] adam was created
[41:53] wasn't just born like the uh or you know
[41:56] he was created
[41:59] whereas jesus had to be born
[42:03] because if he created adam adam couldn't
[42:06] die for our sins
[42:09] because it was a creator or a creation
[42:12] but see jesus christ was god almighty
[42:14] who stepped into another form
[42:17] he just moved from one form to another i
[42:19] hope you keep looking at that and
[42:20] thinking it in your mind to keep that
[42:22] form in mind and you'll see it see no
[42:25] man can see god in the bodily form
[42:27] because
[42:28] god is not in bodily form
[42:31] now it doesn't mean that he didn't look
[42:33] like us
[42:35] get all that so you try to figure that
[42:37] out well what did he look like
[42:39] well i guess he was a glob what was that
[42:41] one uh kid somebody helped me one of the
[42:43] kids the guy with the brain you remember
[42:45] and he was standing out there and they
[42:46] had the big old belly and the cartoon
[42:48] things and that big old belly and here
[42:50] was the brain you know
[42:52] and
[42:52] one of the cartoon characters
[42:55] see
[42:59] but see
[43:00] it's not that away
[43:02] you got to get your mind into the line
[43:05] of what your thinking is
[43:08] in what he's doing
[43:10] all right adam was the first of the
[43:13] natural
[43:14] creation of mankind
[43:18] all right
[43:19] because he was the first of that type of
[43:21] being
[43:23] so he came that way even before jesus
[43:25] came
[43:27] okay
[43:28] but it doesn't see don't try to put and
[43:31] figure out well what did god look like i
[43:33] don't understand what he looked like did
[43:35] he have well
[43:36] if he made man in the spiritual we know
[43:39] what that looks like
[43:42] right
[43:44] and he made the animals he made adam in
[43:46] the line of the animals
[43:48] all right we know what that looks like
[43:52] right
[43:53] see then we don't have to worry about
[43:54] what he's trying to figure out what did
[43:56] god look like back there
[43:58] well i guess he had to well did he have
[44:01] four toes and and three eyes and
[44:03] see
[44:04] no what do we look like
[44:11] see when he brought it down he brought
[44:13] down the creation and he started
[44:15] creating naturally that's what i've been
[44:17] trying to do with he created the
[44:18] spiritual sense coming down then he
[44:20] creates adam in a spiritual sense
[44:24] so theophany
[44:26] all right then he puts him into human
[44:28] flesh
[44:30] all right that's the first of that race
[44:34] all right you know where i'm headed
[44:35] because you know in the church age book
[44:37] where he said this is a new race
[44:40] that's right but that's going to be
[44:41] where we come down to where we're at all
[44:43] right we'll get to that later see all
[44:45] right what did he say
[44:47] he said god's not in a bodily form god
[44:49] is a spirit
[44:50] all right now there's the point see no
[44:52] man has seen the father but the only
[44:54] begotten of the father had declared him
[44:57] all right god is a spirit
[45:00] but remember he's not just a spirit
[45:02] floating around just there's something
[45:05] floating around no form to it no the
[45:08] prophet said he's a being amen
[45:13] he would be more real than we would be
[45:16] you could think how real adam would come
[45:18] out to be then think of a god that could
[45:20] create that
[45:22] and you think about what your body is
[45:26] you realize there's things in your body
[45:28] that it's just minut little things but
[45:32] yet your body is run by that
[45:36] things are done by those uh
[45:38] things going backwards and forth
[45:40] and you just think of all the things
[45:43] and you see even like the prophet said
[45:45] you can take the the uh certain things
[45:47] out of the the animal race put it into
[45:50] the human race it'll go right straight
[45:52] to that
[45:53] part
[45:55] like it's made from all right because
[45:57] the animals the prophet said what he was
[46:00] the first creation was what he was an
[46:03] animal
[46:05] but that animal was a man
[46:07] all right he was the first of a new race
[46:11] god came over from being
[46:15] self-existing
[46:16] and all that and then he steps over into
[46:19] another form and begins to create but
[46:22] his first part he steps into has to be
[46:24] the word
[46:28] so he steps into the word form
[46:31] and begins to create
[46:33] all right see then that would put the
[46:35] son of god the creator and that's why
[46:38] that they they the scripture would say
[46:40] and we emphasize it thou art the christ
[46:43] the son of the living god
[46:45] in other words you are god made manifest
[46:49] in flesh that's why they try they killed
[46:51] him
[46:53] they killed him because he was god made
[46:54] flesh
[46:57] all right
[46:57] because that's what he was just saying
[47:00] see the heart the christ the son of the
[47:01] living god okay all right then in doing
[47:04] that
[47:05] then he comes forth and you see what it
[47:07] comes to that he tries to together this
[47:11] natural man and and coming i mean coming
[47:14] from a spiritual condition to a natural
[47:16] man
[47:18] all right and makes a new race
[47:22] all right then jesus didn't come with
[47:24] four legs and two arms and a head
[47:27] messed up no
[47:28] no how did he come like us
[47:32] well evidently that's what god was back
[47:34] there
[47:38] right
[47:39] evidently god looked like this
[47:46] maybe he didn't look as fat as some of
[47:48] us
[47:49] or you know different things but he
[47:52] still looked like us
[47:54] all right
[47:55] but what was the form what was he made
[47:57] out of well what are we worried about
[47:59] what are you concerned with what he was
[48:01] made out of
[48:03] the point is he got here and that's my
[48:06] point it wasn't then he didn't send a
[48:09] son he came himself he just stepped over
[48:12] in another form
[48:13] and there's the word
[48:15] then he began to say let there be
[48:18] all right and he created the animals and
[48:20] created all of the things then he comes
[48:22] down and he creates the the flesh man in
[48:25] adam
[48:27] all right
[48:28] and when he does he comes forth and you
[48:31] can see what god has
[48:33] got in his mind
[48:34] a human being
[48:36] now the trick to catch is what we're
[48:38] going to get over to where a new
[48:39] creation
[48:41] you're going to have to wind up and come
[48:43] with one more creation
[48:46] now i know the quote so don't worry
[48:48] about it brother said he was
[48:50] he was a finished physical creation
[48:52] that's right
[48:55] he come down and he stopped creating
[48:57] but you know what on the day of
[48:59] pentecost he started creating again
[49:03] a new race
[49:05] didn't change the man don't change us
[49:07] out the new birth don't make you any
[49:09] different
[49:12] it just makes you to be what you should
[49:14] have been to start with
[49:17] you say should have been yeah we should
[49:19] have been that way we should have come
[49:20] that away
[49:22] adam was the beginning of that
[49:28] all right
[49:29] you know how i've always preached it
[49:30] whatever happened in adam they could
[49:32] have come together
[49:34] and god brought all of us into being and
[49:36] we'd all went to the tree of life
[49:39] and our bodies would have been made turn
[49:41] eternal
[49:42] because the soul would have been eternal
[49:44] coming from god
[49:46] all right see then that way we can we
[49:48] can see that god had in his mind all the
[49:51] way back what he was going to do but
[49:53] we'll see how that he does it in stages
[49:56] to bring it down all right then he's
[49:57] bringing it but then there's a great
[49:59] supernatural being jehovah god who
[50:02] covered all space and all pro what
[50:06] here he was in this
[50:08] form
[50:10] he steps over in another form
[50:14] which is the word
[50:17] you say yeah but he's he's not oh come
[50:19] on then brother and i'll take you back
[50:21] with that he said uh you say but he
[50:24] never come in flesh before he said well
[50:26] yes he did
[50:28] he said he come in flesh
[50:32] in melchizedek
[50:35] they come in flesh in
[50:37] that melchizedek theophany formed to
[50:39] moses
[50:40] that could see him
[50:42] all right
[50:44] see then you see what he was planning on
[50:46] doing
[50:47] what do you think god would look like i
[50:48] think that's what he'd look like
[50:51] i believe i'm as serious as i can be
[50:54] he's seen the back part of a man he
[50:56] wasn't able to see the front part right
[50:58] because no man could see god and live so
[51:00] he wasn't able to do that he had to wait
[51:02] until that come into flesh all right but
[51:04] when that would come into flesh what are
[51:05] you gonna make it look like
[51:10] did he come out to me and looking like
[51:11] some kind of a weird creature
[51:14] no
[51:17] they come into being what
[51:19] we're doing come on i'm just trying to
[51:20] make a natural point for you to keep it
[51:24] in mind to where when the spiritual
[51:26] comes into being that we get over to
[51:28] that that you'll see what we're trying
[51:29] to say all right then what happens
[51:32] the natural
[51:34] has got to become from it'll become from
[51:37] spiritual creation to natural creation
[51:41] all right
[51:42] so then get that point now look go ahead
[51:44] number three
[51:50] now no one has seen god
[51:54] and now the next thing we begin to see
[51:56] by eyes of supernatural
[51:58] looking we see a little white lie
[52:01] forming out there what is that that was
[52:03] called by bible readers logos
[52:06] or anointed or the anointing or as i was
[52:10] as i was going to say that the part of
[52:13] god began to develop into something
[52:16] or something so human beings could have
[52:19] some
[52:20] type of an idea
[52:22] what it wasn't see it was a little uh a
[52:25] little light moving and that that was
[52:28] the word of god now watch him
[52:31] now god gave himself birth to this son
[52:35] which was before there was even an atom
[52:41] no so when did the son of god come into
[52:43] being
[52:45] are you reading
[52:47] before there was even an atom
[52:49] before there was anything the son of god
[52:52] was already into being.
[52:55] no no that was 2 000 years ago when see
[52:58] that's where your mind is locked on that
[53:00] thought and it won't won't work
[53:03] see you've got to get it in the right
[53:05] line
[53:07] all right so you get him to what is the
[53:09] son of god
[53:10] god in another
[53:12] form what did he do he just stepped into
[53:15] another form
[53:20] now in listen if you caught that little
[53:22] point i laid down a there a while ago
[53:26] melchizedek
[53:29] ate the calf
[53:35] moses saw the back part of a man
[53:41] so what would god look like
[53:47] what was the form or
[53:49] looking that you're trying to look at
[53:50] what god is you know
[53:53] what was he he was a man
[53:57] but theophany was a man
[54:02] all right
[54:03] see you say well well i don't know
[54:05] theophany is all right that theology
[54:07] ties into a greater being as we get on
[54:09] down to the new birth
[54:10] but the point of what i'm getting at
[54:13] moses saw a man
[54:16] so what did god look like before he came
[54:18] over
[54:19] to where we're at
[54:24] look like a man
[54:26] melchizedek was a man
[54:28] all right so then that way we can see
[54:31] that that it wouldn't be something
[54:33] different
[54:34] but it's a different race
[54:39] in other words back before this world
[54:41] they would have been god
[54:44] self-existing
[54:46] on it but then when he would start
[54:47] coming this away he would start
[54:49] unveiling himself for what he would look
[54:51] like
[54:53] and what he would be and how he would
[54:55] would manifest himself in and all right
[55:01] okay
[55:02] see then think about it
[55:06] god is
[55:08] wait let's let's just read this one go
[55:10] ahead and number
[55:11] well i'm on the backside
[55:14] go ahead with number
[55:16] three
[55:20] did we done we redid that one
[55:23] he gave himself birth which was before
[55:25] there was even us adam or anything
[55:28] he gave himself birth to this son now
[55:31] when we read it over here in a minute
[55:33] get your mind clearer because what we're
[55:35] going to read is is we're brought around
[55:38] and says
[55:38] adam was god's first created son
[55:45] he said but jesus was his first begotten
[55:49] son
[55:52] and he was begotten through the wound of
[55:54] a
[55:56] woman see adam wasn't begotten like that
[55:59] adam was created straight from god's
[56:02] speech
[56:03] the word created him
[56:04] all right
[56:06] see this
[56:07] if you get these things straight you'll
[56:08] see how things fit together i was
[56:10] sitting there there there
[56:12] wednesday night when wade was bringing
[56:13] that out i thought come on come on come
[56:15] on come on come on
[56:16] you know
[56:18] oh okay
[56:22] what you see
[56:25] who was michael
[56:31] it was michael
[56:34] you say well
[56:36] god's first creation was angels
[56:40] all right then he'll turn in another
[56:42] lineup of bringing it down that god's
[56:44] first creation was this way or that way
[56:47] just think about it who was michael
[56:52] michael wasn't an angel
[56:54] he was an archangel
[56:58] the highest form
[57:02] that's why brother brown says michael
[57:04] was christ
[57:06] now who's christ god in another form
[57:11] remember that from last week
[57:13] god in another form you remember what he
[57:15] was bringing out about michael
[57:17] see michael was god in another form
[57:22] that's where satan could never figure
[57:23] that out because how did that guy get
[57:25] next to him
[57:26] when he first was created
[57:28] he knew he was created for a purpose to
[57:31] be god's right-hand man
[57:34] right
[57:36] but then when it all becomes to get into
[57:38] view and satan begin to play around a
[57:42] little bit
[57:44] michael just steps on the scene
[57:50] michael's not just an
[57:53] michael was god
[57:55] in another form
[57:58] called the christ
[58:00] keep that in your mind and your thinking
[58:02] about it and it'll keep a wonderful
[58:04] story because you'll see then here was
[58:06] god
[58:09] he steps over here in another form
[58:11] now listen
[58:12] which is the word
[58:14] right
[58:18] and then that word begins to say let
[58:20] there be what word michael
[58:24] that's where satan got all upset he
[58:25] couldn't understand i'm supposed to be
[58:28] his right-hand man
[58:31] i'm supposed to be there
[58:32] well what would be the right-hand man of
[58:34] god
[58:36] well now he he picked out this special
[58:37] angel he seemed down through there all
[58:39] up and he looked over and he seen
[58:40] michael and he goes
[58:41] puts them here no
[58:45] michael was god in another form
[58:49] that's why it winds up starts in michael
[58:53] not mentioned much back that way but
[58:55] michael drove here in the book of
[58:56] revelations when it all ends up
[58:59] because he fights with satan all right
[59:01] but just keep that little thing see
[59:03] you'll see what we're hitting things and
[59:05] i back away just a little bit when i see
[59:07] him moving or these brothers moving into
[59:10] it because i want them to minister
[59:13] i don't want them to just be repeaters
[59:16] that's fine
[59:17] that's great
[59:19] i want them to preach in their manner or
[59:21] their style of their doing
[59:23] because if you don't then they'll wind
[59:25] up trying to be copycats
[59:28] and that don't work okay just just
[59:30] forgive me all right
[59:32] go ahead to number
[59:34] number four
[59:41] okay
[59:42] show us the
[59:44] father and there he come out there was
[59:48] nothing
[59:49] and then here come the logos that looked
[59:51] like a halo
[59:53] hanging under no man has seen god at any
[59:56] time now eye to eye
[59:58] and here's
[59:59] the logos look like a supernatural being
[1:00:02] it's a halo that's the son of god
[1:00:05] now look he said i don't believe in
[1:00:07] eternal sonship
[1:00:11] all right
[1:00:12] but you know that brother brown and
[1:00:13] believed in eternal godship amen
[1:00:17] i got to quote here in a minute i'll
[1:00:18] read it to you
[1:00:20] you can have an eternal godhead
[1:00:24] because you can't have an eternal
[1:00:25] sonship because sons have beginnings
[1:00:30] but see jesus never had a beginning like
[1:00:32] we he was the first of a new race
[1:00:35] we'll get back to that okay go ahead go
[1:00:37] ahead to number
[1:00:40] number five let's get these because i
[1:00:42] want you to get the point now what we're
[1:00:44] talking about but now in the beginning
[1:00:46] of jesus's ministry he's such a great
[1:00:49] person that never know was ever on the
[1:00:51] earth like him and there never will be
[1:00:54] anyone like him he was he was the only
[1:00:56] begotten son of god
[1:00:59] son of
[1:01:00] almighty god we are sons by adoption
[1:01:04] through him
[1:01:06] but he is god's only begotten
[1:01:09] son
[1:01:12] now begotten son
[1:01:14] adam was god's son
[1:01:16] do you believe that
[1:01:19] but he was god's creative son
[1:01:24] jesus was not god's create native son
[1:01:28] adam was god's creative son jesus was
[1:01:31] god's
[1:01:33] begotten
[1:01:34] see
[1:01:35] god begotten his son okay go ahead
[1:01:39] go to number
[1:01:40] six let's get these fires now
[1:01:43] i'll go up to the point so how many
[1:01:45] knows that god is like then when god
[1:01:47] became the flesh and dwell in the body
[1:01:48] that he created which was his only
[1:01:50] begotten son adam was his son
[1:01:53] a creative son but jesus was his
[1:01:56] begotten son
[1:01:58] and god was in jesus reconciling the
[1:02:01] world to himself
[1:02:03] now keep in mind god you know keep in
[1:02:07] mind what we was reading a minute ago
[1:02:10] his first creative son
[1:02:13] he gave birth
[1:02:16] you remember
[1:02:17] he gave birth
[1:02:19] what was it
[1:02:22] you remember that a minute ago where he
[1:02:23] said he gave birth to his son
[1:02:26] what's giving birth to
[1:02:30] adam was created
[1:02:33] made created
[1:02:35] jesus wasn't made
[1:02:38] he was begotten
[1:02:41] he had to come into a human body to be
[1:02:44] able to be a savior
[1:02:47] adam could not fulfill that
[1:02:50] he could not be our savior
[1:02:53] but jesus christ could be our savior but
[1:02:55] he would have to come first to prove
[1:02:57] what he's doing he would have to come as
[1:02:59] a spiritual being
[1:03:03] so that would be god's first creation
[1:03:05] would be a spiritual being him stepping
[1:03:07] over in another form
[1:03:10] called the word logos theophany
[1:03:12] all right
[1:03:14] and see from there then you see coming
[1:03:16] into view michael's stepping on the
[1:03:18] scene
[1:03:24] because michael was christ
[1:03:26] not christ of the anointing
[1:03:29] he was the christ
[1:03:32] thou art the christ the son of the
[1:03:33] living god who was michael he was jesus
[1:03:36] christ
[1:03:37] before he became jesus christ that's
[1:03:40] right
[1:03:41] arne with me
[1:03:44] he was jesus christ
[1:03:46] almighty god
[1:03:47] come on we're getting onto something on
[1:03:48] the god head now let's go ahead and roll
[1:03:50] it up now he
[1:03:52] jesus the son of god had the spirit
[1:03:54] without measure is that right but we
[1:03:56] have it by measure see he had it the
[1:03:58] jesus son of god had the spirit without
[1:04:00] me that was the fullness of the godhead
[1:04:02] bodily
[1:04:06] come into human flesh
[1:04:09] sure
[1:04:11] i've explained it to you when he was a
[1:04:12] baby he couldn't die for our sins
[1:04:15] when he was 13 years old he couldn't pay
[1:04:17] the price for our sins no huh no he
[1:04:19] couldn't do that
[1:04:21] so he had to wait to a time till he
[1:04:22] become 29 going under 30 to be able to
[1:04:26] enter the ministry
[1:04:28] becoming 30 the bible says
[1:04:31] all right to enter the ministry to pay
[1:04:33] the price
[1:04:35] he could start preaching but then he
[1:04:37] still had to preach the message that
[1:04:39] would crucify him
[1:04:43] right
[1:04:44] so he was jesus the son of god
[1:04:47] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:04:52] so then why not go back and think about
[1:04:54] what the prophet is saying a lot of
[1:04:56] times
[1:04:57] just think simple
[1:05:00] in god
[1:05:03] he was a man
[1:05:04] i mean in god he was he was
[1:05:07] a spirit man
[1:05:10] but in body
[1:05:11] he was a man
[1:05:14] the bible says god was in christ
[1:05:16] reconciling the world and to himself
[1:05:23] god and man become one
[1:05:27] sister said out there the other night
[1:05:28] said are you going down to where uh
[1:05:32] in the scriptures where it speaks of
[1:05:34] heaven and earth kissing each other
[1:05:37] i said you've been reading the seals
[1:05:39] hadn't he she had she copied them off
[1:05:41] remember to put them down
[1:05:44] what
[1:05:46] god and man become
[1:05:48] one when jesus christ stepped on this
[1:05:51] earth god and man become one
[1:05:58] you don't have to play around and try to
[1:06:00] figure well what was this or what did he
[1:06:02] look like
[1:06:04] why
[1:06:06] what are you worried about it for that's
[1:06:07] right but just remember he looked like
[1:06:10] us
[1:06:12] because that's who we are
[1:06:15] he's not going to change us into a nut
[1:06:17] the the uh change of the body is not
[1:06:19] going to change us into another uh
[1:06:21] creature looking something
[1:06:27] just make this new
[1:06:33] so then what's he doing go ahead number
[1:06:34] six like let's see well number five or
[1:06:36] number six
[1:06:38] seven go ahead now this great creator
[1:06:41] had placed his created son
[1:06:45] now adam was his first created son
[1:06:48] jesus was his only begotten see he was
[1:06:52] begotten by a woman
[1:06:55] but adam was straight right straight
[1:06:58] from the hand of god in the creation
[1:07:03] jesus never come that away
[1:07:07] he had to come through the wound of a
[1:07:08] woman
[1:07:11] that would make him the begotten the
[1:07:14] only begotten
[1:07:15] that's why the scripture emphasizes it
[1:07:17] only begotten only begotten one because
[1:07:20] there'll never be another one like that
[1:07:26] because you'd have another god if you
[1:07:27] did
[1:07:29] no see that won't work go ahead to the
[1:07:30] next one
[1:07:31] number eight
[1:07:35] see the holy blood that was created by
[1:07:38] god the blood the life the creation of
[1:07:40] god jesus was the beginning of the
[1:07:42] creation of god oh you see it god made
[1:07:45] in creation
[1:07:48] he was spirit the bible said
[1:07:50] he is the beginning of the creation of
[1:07:52] god
[1:07:53] how did he begin in the wounds of a
[1:07:55] woman which is what
[1:07:57] the woman is not he goes on to talk
[1:08:00] about the chain but remember one thing
[1:08:05] he had to become
[1:08:07] what did it uh
[1:08:09] come on brian uh
[1:08:12] genesis 3 15.
[1:08:15] thy seed
[1:08:18] thy siege which was christ
[1:08:20] all right come on then let's go to the
[1:08:22] next one i want to get these here
[1:08:24] because i want you to get this point to
[1:08:26] where we can preach on it later god is
[1:08:28] the creator and how was he ever created
[1:08:32] but this is the beginning of the
[1:08:34] creation of god
[1:08:35] when god the spirit was created in the
[1:08:37] form of a man
[1:08:38] see come on down to man
[1:08:40] he started his journey as to being and
[1:08:43] he comes through the the creation acts
[1:08:45] and he come down to be a man god the
[1:08:48] creator himself becoming a
[1:08:50] creation god who made the dirt made the
[1:08:53] council made the
[1:08:55] polish
[1:08:57] cosmic light petroleums
[1:09:00] took the
[1:09:01] thing together and created himself in
[1:09:03] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:09:08] how was it no man has seen god at any
[1:09:11] time but the only begotten of the father
[1:09:13] has declared him
[1:09:16] i wish we'd get that point in our mind
[1:09:18] of how that he declared him he brought
[1:09:21] him out in the open
[1:09:23] he brought him out where he could be
[1:09:24] seen
[1:09:27] jesus was god made manifest in human
[1:09:30] flesh right
[1:09:33] walking up on this earth a man that was
[1:09:36] god
[1:09:38] huh
[1:09:40] that god
[1:09:41] had to pay the price of death
[1:09:44] for you and me
[1:09:46] but he's the beginning of the creation
[1:09:49] right
[1:09:50] he was a new race
[1:09:53] i want to get to that and then we'll try
[1:09:54] to get our point okay
[1:09:56] go ahead i think the next one yeah
[1:10:00] um number 10. yeah
[1:10:04] he had started a new creation
[1:10:09] now watch him
[1:10:11] what was it
[1:10:12] a creation of himself
[1:10:16] god was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:10:21] i see he had to then come through the
[1:10:22] wound of the woman
[1:10:24] to be able to come to that position he
[1:10:26] could not be spoken into existence
[1:10:31] so adam was his created son
[1:10:35] jesus was his begotten son
[1:10:38] where he could come into being
[1:10:40] now watch
[1:10:42] god was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:10:44] that's the bible said in the beginning
[1:10:46] of the creation of god god was created
[1:10:48] in human form
[1:10:49] in jesus
[1:10:51] christ his son god dwelt he built his
[1:10:54] tabernacle of flesh and bones and lived
[1:10:57] in that tabernacle
[1:10:59] god emmanuel god with us he built
[1:11:02] himself a house to live in it so he
[1:11:04] could reflect his word to his subjects
[1:11:08] through that you know what god is when
[1:11:11] you see jesus
[1:11:13] okay right go ahead to the next one
[1:11:20] this is revelation
[1:11:22] then when was god created
[1:11:26] is the beginning of the creation of god
[1:11:29] and god is eternal is that right
[1:11:32] but when god was created well
[1:11:35] in other words when god was created now
[1:11:37] he stopped makes his point
[1:11:39] when a little baby that was conceived in
[1:11:41] the wound of a mother
[1:11:43] in a virgin
[1:11:46] and she began to develop these cells
[1:11:49] within her bod her to bring forth this
[1:11:52] little baby
[1:11:53] that was the beginning of god's creation
[1:12:00] he's a new creation
[1:12:02] he's a new race
[1:12:04] okay all right
[1:12:07] go ahead number
[1:12:09] 12.
[1:12:12] how could god be created if he's a
[1:12:15] spirit
[1:12:16] how could he
[1:12:17] how could he be he's eternal
[1:12:20] he never was created
[1:12:23] he never will be created now look at
[1:12:26] he's been talking about him being
[1:12:27] created now he's saying he never was
[1:12:28] created
[1:12:31] what like we think
[1:12:33] the way we think of created god was
[1:12:36] never created that away adam was created
[1:12:38] that way
[1:12:41] that's why i'm reading the point over
[1:12:43] and over and over adam was
[1:12:45] that
[1:12:46] jesus was not there jesus was god made
[1:12:49] manifest in human flesh
[1:12:52] right
[1:12:53] he was god in the beginning but he is
[1:12:56] that the beginning of the creation of
[1:12:58] god was jesus when
[1:13:00] he
[1:13:01] went was
[1:13:02] the beginning of the creation of god was
[1:13:04] jesus christ when he was made manifest
[1:13:06] when god lived in him
[1:13:09] he is god's creation almighty the first
[1:13:12] and the last the amen the beginning of
[1:13:13] the creation of god when god created
[1:13:15] himself a body he come down and lived in
[1:13:19] it that's the beginning of the creation
[1:13:21] of god oh my isn't he wonderful
[1:13:23] what about it
[1:13:25] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:13:30] god created a body
[1:13:33] but not created it like adam
[1:13:36] get that see adam was created right
[1:13:40] all right
[1:13:42] jesus christ wasn't created he was
[1:13:44] birthed
[1:13:49] he was the word he was birthed
[1:13:52] in the beginning was the word word with
[1:13:53] god and the word was god and the word
[1:13:55] was made flesh and dwelt among us all
[1:13:56] right
[1:13:57] he gave birth god gave birth to his own
[1:14:00] self
[1:14:01] in the basis that he just stepped into
[1:14:03] another form
[1:14:06] that was god in human flesh
[1:14:09] all he done when he come to this earth
[1:14:10] was took on a human flesh
[1:14:13] a body
[1:14:14] thou hast hebrews 10 5 thou has prepared
[1:14:16] me he took upon that body so he could
[1:14:19] pay the price for our sins
[1:14:24] see then he was the only begotten
[1:14:28] but that started a new race
[1:14:31] i don't want to say too much on that
[1:14:32] because i want to get the whole thing as
[1:14:34] we can into this
[1:14:36] all right
[1:14:39] we'll hit a
[1:14:40] number
[1:14:42] what do we got we got two more
[1:14:47] go ahead number 14.
[1:14:50] i believe that jesus is the son of god
[1:14:52] i believe that in his body he was a man
[1:14:55] he was born of a woman just like i was
[1:14:58] but his blood was not of a woman
[1:15:01] it was of god and jehovah god the logos
[1:15:03] who brooded over the earth and all right
[1:15:06] he was
[1:15:08] he's just like me and you he's he he
[1:15:10] could god
[1:15:11] jesus christ could give you a blood
[1:15:12] transfusion
[1:15:14] do you believe it that way i do
[1:15:16] i believe that he was so much human he
[1:15:18] could give you a blood transfusion right
[1:15:20] well that would be nice if we could get
[1:15:22] it but i thought we did get it in the
[1:15:24] new birth
[1:15:27] i thought we did get a new creation in
[1:15:29] the new birth
[1:15:31] that's where we'll get to the message
[1:15:32] next see and and keep running over that
[1:15:35] all right
[1:15:40] all right go ahead number 15.
[1:15:43] this is the one i like the logos that
[1:15:45] went out of god no regard to you
[1:15:47] catholic people he's talking about the
[1:15:48] facts of the faith and all and they talk
[1:15:50] about eternal uh
[1:15:52] sonship that don't work see
[1:15:55] roll it on up eternity
[1:15:59] which had no beginning or has no end and
[1:16:01] sun means had a beginning
[1:16:04] so how could it it could it could be a
[1:16:07] eternal
[1:16:08] god ship
[1:16:12] now who would have ever thought of that
[1:16:16] we was arguing over the godhead and he's
[1:16:18] talking about the godship
[1:16:21] he brings it eternal an eternal godship
[1:16:25] why because that's what i've been
[1:16:26] explaining all the way down has been god
[1:16:29] in this form moved over to this form and
[1:16:32] manifest himself as the word the creator
[1:16:35] moves from that form over into the next
[1:16:37] form and finally comes into human flesh
[1:16:42] then he has to give his life and that's
[1:16:44] where we're going to next where he has
[1:16:45] to give his life releasing that that was
[1:16:48] within him so he could start the new
[1:16:50] creation that he always wanted
[1:16:54] which is a new birth
[1:16:56] in you
[1:17:03] it could be an eternal godhead a never
[1:17:05] eternal sonship a son is one that was
[1:17:07] begotten so it has to begin and the
[1:17:09] logos which was the son of god went out
[1:17:12] created by these great fountains of
[1:17:14] purity god as those spirits went out and
[1:17:17] it created the logos all right so you
[1:17:20] think about it let's get let's get to
[1:17:22] the last one and then we'll
[1:17:26] god came down in a blood cell not
[1:17:28] through a man but by the holy spirit and
[1:17:30] in that virgin wound a tabernacle for
[1:17:33] the purpose of death was built
[1:17:35] the seed of the woman came in order that
[1:17:38] he be bruised to bring us our salvation
[1:17:42] when the holy ghost came upon mary he
[1:17:45] created within her wound the cell that
[1:17:47] would
[1:17:48] multiply and become the body of our lord
[1:17:51] that cell was created it was the
[1:17:53] beginning of the creation of god
[1:17:57] that that is who jesus is and that holy
[1:18:00] one was filled with holy blood even the
[1:18:03] blood of god that tabernacle came in and
[1:18:06] came to birth he grew to be a man he
[1:18:08] went to jordan and there was sacrifice
[1:18:11] was washed to john and all the river
[1:18:14] think about it
[1:18:16] think about it church
[1:18:21] a simple little
[1:18:23] story or illustrations
[1:18:26] that the prophet would bring
[1:18:28] for us to understand
[1:18:32] you're a father
[1:18:34] your son you're a human being
[1:18:36] but you're only one person
[1:18:39] well that makes the godhead
[1:18:40] understanding
[1:18:42] great to you and i because
[1:18:44] we see father son and holy ghost it's
[1:18:46] not three gods
[1:18:49] it's god manifested in many ways
[1:18:54] coming out to be
[1:18:55] the eternal god
[1:18:57] dwelling in a human being
[1:19:00] making way for a new creation
[1:19:03] then the revelations you will get it
[1:19:05] over into the next message or so where
[1:19:08] it says in the beginning of the creation
[1:19:09] of god he said this is
[1:19:12] another creation
[1:19:15] he's not dealing by ways of the old way
[1:19:19] this is a new creation
[1:19:21] you that have a new birth
[1:19:25] you have eternal life in you
[1:19:29] right
[1:19:30] by having eternal life
[1:19:33] in a new birth
[1:19:35] you're a beginning of a creation
[1:19:39] that creation started back there on the
[1:19:41] day of pentecost
[1:19:43] a new creation
[1:19:45] you're trying to figure out and i know
[1:19:47] what our thoughts are trying to figure
[1:19:48] out what was god before this what was
[1:19:50] god for i'm looking at what god is now
[1:19:55] he's now
[1:19:56] getting
[1:19:58] in finality
[1:20:01] what he always wanted
[1:20:06] but we've always understood the new
[1:20:07] birth we wondered well okay
[1:20:11] but just remember
[1:20:13] the new birth
[1:20:14] came in a mighty way
[1:20:16] because you know what your prophet said
[1:20:20] he said adam and eve
[1:20:23] could have made god a creator
[1:20:25] but that wasn't what he wanted
[1:20:29] or a father
[1:20:30] but he wouldn't want it that way
[1:20:33] he said the son of man
[1:20:36] was the way
[1:20:40] who is the son of man
[1:20:46] he was almighty god in human flesh
[1:20:50] and he spoke the word
[1:20:52] you realize he spoke you into existence
[1:20:57] as part of a new race
[1:21:01] not trying to take us away from the
[1:21:02] human race and throw us out into some
[1:21:04] other form no
[1:21:06] no
[1:21:08] but to bring forth what he always wanted
[1:21:11] his people
[1:21:13] into manifestation
[1:21:16] he was lonely
[1:21:18] is that the thing the prophet emphasized
[1:21:20] of god before the foundation of the
[1:21:21] world and all of that he was lonely
[1:21:25] he said he made adam
[1:21:27] he said he looked and
[1:21:28] adam was lonely
[1:21:31] so he made him a help meet
[1:21:35] and then through her she brought forth
[1:21:37] the manifestation of what it would be
[1:21:40] through her wound
[1:21:42] would finally come the seed of the woman
[1:21:47] that would make way for the new birth
[1:21:50] to be able to come
[1:21:53] and to be christ in you the hope of
[1:21:55] glory
[1:21:57] think on these things
[1:22:01] he's the beginning of the creation of
[1:22:03] god but around says we're the
[1:22:04] continuation
[1:22:08] he was the beginning or the first one of
[1:22:11] this new race
[1:22:14] right
[1:22:16] first one of this new race
[1:22:22] but we're the rest of that we're the
[1:22:23] finishing up
[1:22:25] and i thought we always believed in the
[1:22:27] alpha and omega form
[1:22:29] of how he started would wind up the way
[1:22:31] he you know how he ends it would be the
[1:22:34] way he would want it to be
[1:22:35] he always wanted it to come to that
[1:22:37] place
[1:22:40] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[1:22:43] the new birth
[1:22:46] but brother dale you mean the new birth
[1:22:48] is is you know you remember
[1:22:51] you think that this thing is ending up
[1:22:53] just on us in the new birth
[1:22:56] well
[1:22:58] you tell me where it ends at
[1:23:00] you tell me what it comes out to be
[1:23:04] because
[1:23:05] i'm sorry to say it but that's the way
[1:23:06] i've always studied it
[1:23:09] to try to see christ
[1:23:12] i remember back there when we were
[1:23:15] talking about god and things
[1:23:18] and he said you know you just couldn't
[1:23:20] get it clear
[1:23:22] but each day it becomes more clearer
[1:23:24] more clearer opening up
[1:23:26] to where we can see god
[1:23:29] see that's why he could walk right in
[1:23:30] here right now
[1:23:34] but you wouldn't know he was god
[1:23:38] because he wouldn't understand it to be
[1:23:40] that away
[1:23:41] so he won't walk in that way
[1:23:44] we beat him in the air
[1:23:46] but he's here anyway
[1:23:51] he's here every time he gives a new
[1:23:52] birth
[1:23:55] every time he makes a a child of god or
[1:23:57] brings it into the
[1:23:58] that's part of that original creation
[1:24:00] was back there
[1:24:04] adam and eve
[1:24:07] was an original creation
[1:24:11] spiritually speaking
[1:24:14] then they become into a physical
[1:24:16] creation
[1:24:17] which would make them first of all that
[1:24:19] type of a race or a people
[1:24:21] so what would god be like
[1:24:24] i mean he wanted if he wanted fellowship
[1:24:26] with with uh his creation you think he'd
[1:24:30] make us a bunch of monkeys and and
[1:24:32] elephants and bears and things you know
[1:24:36] no
[1:24:38] he made us like himself
[1:24:42] that's well i've always said we know for
[1:24:44] sure
[1:24:46] the way jesus is supposed to look like
[1:24:50] because the prophet said he saw him two
[1:24:51] or three times
[1:24:55] do you think he said well no he saw it
[1:24:57] two or three times
[1:25:00] did he look like hoffman's
[1:25:03] we know what he looks like
[1:25:07] if a man come in here that looked like
[1:25:09] hoffman
[1:25:10] we begin to think wouldn't it
[1:25:13] but we know that he ain't supposed to be
[1:25:14] here
[1:25:19] we wouldn't be deceived
[1:25:22] we know he's not supposed to be here
[1:25:23] we're supposed to meet him in the air
[1:25:24] but now if i met one in the air i'd want
[1:25:26] him to look like hoffman
[1:25:28] right
[1:25:29] you understand
[1:25:31] i want to reverse it i want him to look
[1:25:33] like that if i meet him in the air
[1:25:37] because that's what he's supposed to
[1:25:38] look like
[1:25:42] see we've learned a lot of things over a
[1:25:44] lot of the years
[1:25:47] now waiting to see a lot of that made
[1:25:49] manifest
[1:25:53] hope time don't run out for me but
[1:25:56] if it does i ain't gonna be worried
[1:25:57] about it
[1:25:58] i just get to beat you up get up before
[1:26:00] you do
[1:26:01] you know
[1:26:02] i'll meet you somewhere
[1:26:06] but you see
[1:26:08] if you can catch the godhead correctly
[1:26:12] you get away from trying to figure out
[1:26:14] what he looked like
[1:26:18] back there
[1:26:20] to see what he looks like now
[1:26:23] and to think about that what he looks
[1:26:25] like now was what he would look like
[1:26:27] back there amen
[1:26:28] right
[1:26:30] come on you following me
[1:26:31] you want to know what god looked like
[1:26:33] before the foundation of the world
[1:26:35] look at him now where's he at he's in
[1:26:37] his people
[1:26:39] he's in his remembered body
[1:26:42] wherever one his children
[1:26:44] were his offspring
[1:26:46] i like the way the prophet will get into
[1:26:48] that when we get to it
[1:26:50] now that he was that we're adopted
[1:26:57] we're adopted into this
[1:27:00] brought to that position
[1:27:03] let's come on musician
[1:27:05] think on these things
[1:27:08] see what we've done we've went now from
[1:27:10] god
[1:27:12] back before the world
[1:27:14] bringing down what he looks like and
[1:27:16] what he's doing how he just changes his
[1:27:18] form from one step to another
[1:27:21] and then we've come up to seeing him
[1:27:23] change his form from being that to the
[1:27:26] word
[1:27:27] not to just the word that you look
[1:27:29] across
[1:27:30] because there's the catch to what the
[1:27:32] prophet was saying
[1:27:33] i mean he said word he calls it the word
[1:27:36] he calls it the logos he calls it the
[1:27:38] theophany
[1:27:41] he calls it the anointing well what is
[1:27:44] it it's all of that together
[1:27:49] you understand he's all of that
[1:27:52] he is the word
[1:27:54] but he's not just letters on a page
[1:27:57] not a word like that
[1:27:59] he was the word that stood back there
[1:28:01] and said let there be
[1:28:05] and everything came into being
[1:28:09] he's still creating
[1:28:12] he's creating his bride
[1:28:14] amen
[1:28:16] each day
[1:28:17] that little bride gets more and more
[1:28:20] every day we get closer to god let's
[1:28:23] stand together
[1:28:24] think on these things
[1:28:26] you can follow it see we went from that
[1:28:28] we're going to this now next we'll be
[1:28:30] going
[1:28:31] because we're holding it right now
[1:28:32] because when he walked the shores of
[1:28:33] galilee
[1:28:35] that was almighty god
[1:28:39] walking on this earth
[1:28:42] he wasn't the second person or a third
[1:28:44] person
[1:28:46] he was the person of almighty god
[1:28:50] walking on the shores of galilee
[1:28:54] go ahead while we go 239 he became
[1:29:04] [Music]
[1:29:09] by grace
[1:29:14] he
[1:29:15] became me
[1:29:18] that i
[1:29:20] might become him
[1:29:23] [Music]
[1:29:36] what about
[1:29:38] [Music]
[1:29:41] oh he
[1:29:44] became several
[1:29:46] [Music]
[1:29:47] [Laughter]
[1:29:49] [Music]
[1:29:51] by times
[1:29:56] he
[1:29:59] [Music]
[1:30:04] became father
[1:30:07] in the name of our lord and savior jesus
[1:30:09] christ
[1:30:10] we lay our hands upon our sister
[1:30:12] it says by your stripes
[1:30:14] she is here so touch your eyes let
[1:30:16] everything be normal
[1:30:18] bring it back to the right we love you
[1:30:20] in jesus name amen
[1:30:24] he
[1:30:25] took my place
[1:30:28] [Music]
[1:30:35] [Music]
[1:30:46] you know what our life's going through
[1:30:48] and tormenting the heartaches and

[1:31:50] that i might become him
[1:31:53] there was no way for us to ever be
