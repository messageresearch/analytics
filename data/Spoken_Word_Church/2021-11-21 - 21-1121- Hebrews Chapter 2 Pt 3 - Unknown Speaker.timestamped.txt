[0:00] studying through the book of hebrews and
[0:01] we've made it to hebrews chapter 2 verse
[0:03] 8. so the brothers could go ahead and
[0:05] pull that up
[0:06] and we'll just keep continuing on as we
[0:09] meditate on the things that paul talked
[0:11] about in hebrews
[0:15] just to kind of
[0:16] uh
[0:18] set set a background again for for what
[0:20] we've been studying on paul paul in the
[0:21] book of hebrews is right and if you go
[0:23] if you skip over to the book uh or that
[0:28] the audio's not working
[0:30] it's good all right
[0:32] and hebrews hebrews chapter 10 paul kind
[0:35] of uh
[0:36] he mentions that the people that he's
[0:38] writing to are people that have been
[0:40] through a lot of afflictions and been
[0:42] through been through some struggles and
[0:43] so
[0:44] a lot of the things that he's writing
[0:45] about are to encourage them in their
[0:47] faith and in hebrews chapter 10 he tells
[0:49] them
[0:50] that
[0:52] don't don't give up don't
[0:54] with all the many things that we've
[0:56] heard and seen
[0:57] we've got a reason to believe
[0:59] and he lays out that case through
[1:01] throughout the book of hebrews um
[1:04] for why we believe in jesus as he's
[1:06] elevating elevating jesus and and why
[1:09] why we have can have confidence
[1:12] those in the very first church age why
[1:14] why they could have confidence and and
[1:16] believing on him and i think it's in
[1:19] um
[1:20] in first corinthians that paul laid out
[1:22] that we've there's been five there were
[1:24] 500 witnesses that that saw him alive
[1:26] after after you raised from the dead and
[1:28] paul lays out all these cases for
[1:32] for why we should believe in jesus and
[1:34] so let's let's continue on in hebrews
[1:36] chapter 2 verse 8 he says thou hast thou
[1:38] has put all things into in subjection
[1:40] under his feet under the feet of christ
[1:43] everything's under his feet friend that
[1:44] he put all in subjection under him he
[1:46] left nothing that is not put under him
[1:49] but now we see not yet all things put
[1:51] under him so we see a lot of things
[1:54] now now this kind of leads into the next
[1:56] verse
[1:57] we don't we don't see yet all things put
[1:59] under him but we do see jesus
[2:01] and and so we don't see all things put
[2:03] under him meaning there's a lot of
[2:04] things that you know we've got a lot of
[2:06] afflictions in life we've got a lot of
[2:08] struggles in life we don't we don't see
[2:10] yet people are you can look around and
[2:11] see people dying we don't see yet
[2:14] uh death uh
[2:16] we don't see yet
[2:17] death under his people are still dying
[2:19] so we still see death so we see all of
[2:21] those things we don't see yet all things
[2:23] put under him but going on to hebrews
[2:25] chapter 2 verse 9 on the next slide
[2:28] but we see jesus
[2:30] who was made a little lower than the
[2:31] angels for the suffering of death
[2:33] crowned with glory and honor that he by
[2:34] the grace of god should take death for
[2:36] every man
[2:38] now there's a lot of packed into that
[2:40] statement so let's just sit on that for
[2:41] a little bit longer and see what we can
[2:43] unpack
[2:44] because you know during that first
[2:46] church age
[2:48] there were people like i mentioned in
[2:49] first corinthians that paul mentioned
[2:51] that 500 people that he he mentioned
[2:53] that had actually seen jesus after he
[2:54] had raised from the dead and and there
[2:56] were a lot of people that had seen jesus
[2:58] walking around and seen the effect of
[3:00] his of his ministry and seen
[3:03] after the day of pentecost they had seen
[3:04] the life of christ actually lived out in
[3:07] people and peter and john saying look on
[3:09] us and telling the man of the gay
[3:11] beautiful or
[3:12] i don't have any silver and gold but
[3:14] what i've got i'll give to you and they
[3:16] could actually see the life of christ
[3:18] and these people
[3:19] but i i think really it goes deeper than
[3:21] that that that to see jesus and brother
[3:24] brown would outline as he was preaching
[3:26] hebrews chapter two that here you know
[3:29] there's a lot of people in the world
[3:30] today that cannot see jesus even though
[3:32] their eyes or their physical eyes are
[3:34] open
[3:35] that we can we can actually see jesus we
[3:38] can actually see jesus now by revelation
[3:41] now see brother am in hebrews chapter
[3:43] two he said the people were blind they
[3:45] didn't know him and he's talking he's
[3:46] talking about when when jesus was going
[3:48] down the uh carrying that cross on his
[3:50] back and they they didn't recognize who
[3:52] he was he said they didn't know him they
[3:54] didn't recognize him you say
[3:56] blind could they have their sight
[3:58] you can still have your sight
[4:00] and be blind now isn't that like a
[4:02] paradox that you could be maybe even
[4:04] sitting here in the in the building this
[4:06] morning and and and have your physical
[4:08] eyesight but yet be blind to who jesus
[4:10] is and not understand who jesus is now
[4:14] it was what a strange thing almost that
[4:16] in this day by by the preaching of the
[4:19] gospel by the message that we've heard
[4:21] that we can see jesus that we've got the
[4:23] power that god has given us the ability
[4:26] to see jesus even though physically he
[4:29] might not walk down the aisles of the
[4:30] church we don't physically see him out
[4:32] on the street or or doing things like
[4:34] they did walking on the shores of
[4:36] galilee back then but we can see jesus
[4:40] by the revealing of his word
[4:42] so if we go to the next slide
[4:46] now now jesus this this is that famous
[4:48] parable where jesus said let them alone
[4:50] they be blind leaders of the blind now
[4:52] now the reason brother the reason jesus
[4:54] said this
[4:56] uh called calling the pharisees the
[4:58] blind leaders of the blind because jesus
[5:00] he began to say strange things and he
[5:02] told them they were all worried about
[5:04] the the kind of food that they were what
[5:05] they would put in their mouth and he
[5:07] said it's not what in your what you put
[5:09] in your mouth that defiles you but it's
[5:10] what comes out of your mouth that
[5:11] defiles you it's what it's with the
[5:13] things that you say it's that what what
[5:15] comes out of your mouth that is is what
[5:17] defiles you and they they the bible says
[5:20] that they they got offended noah then
[5:22] came his disciples and sent under him
[5:24] know us now that the pharisees were
[5:25] offended after they heard this say and
[5:28] why were they offended because they
[5:29] couldn't see what he was talking about
[5:31] they were blind they couldn't understand
[5:34] what he was talking about
[5:35] now
[5:36] isn't that just a true example of the
[5:38] church today how many how so many people
[5:40] have become offended by the message
[5:42] because they don't understand what it is
[5:45] they don't understand that that they're
[5:48] not they don't realize that they're
[5:49] blind and so many people
[5:51] that remember that's the that's the
[5:52] forgotten be attribute beatitude blessed
[5:54] are they they're not offended in me
[5:56] jesus preached that sermon so many
[5:58] people get offended at what what they
[6:00] don't really under they think the
[6:02] message is about uh
[6:03] bopping women on the head and and
[6:05] treating or treating uh just just
[6:08] maybe hard to understand things just
[6:10] like the pharisees couldn't understand
[6:11] what jesus was saying so they they got
[6:13] offended at him
[6:15] and jesus said he answered and said
[6:16] every plan
[6:18] which my fatherly heavenly father hath
[6:20] not planted shall be rooted up
[6:22] let them alone they be blind leaders of
[6:25] the blind and if the blind lead the
[6:27] blind both shall fall into the ditch
[6:30] now he he's telling them
[6:32] they're blind he's telling us his
[6:33] disciples these people are blind
[6:36] and they they can't see
[6:38] now again think think what a i'm leading
[6:41] up to something i think it's profound
[6:43] how how simple how simple the evidence
[6:46] of the new birth is how simple the
[6:48] gospel really is as you hear the word
[6:51] the word begins to open up to you and
[6:52] you begin to see what the message is you
[6:55] begin to have an understanding of what
[6:57] the message is really about what the
[6:59] gospel is really about
[7:01] that's why if we go to the next slide in
[7:02] isaiah 42
[7:04] 16-18 it says and i will bring
[7:06] the blind you talk about a prophecy
[7:09] i will bring the blind by a way that
[7:12] they knew not now that's speaking of
[7:14] jesus christ because he said i am the
[7:16] way the truth the life
[7:18] i am the way and the blind when he came
[7:21] people people were blind they didn't
[7:22] understand how to get to god how they
[7:25] didn't understand the approach to god
[7:28] but when jesus came he opened up their
[7:30] eyes so that they could see so that they
[7:32] could have an understanding and you see
[7:34] that's why that's the whole purpose of
[7:36] the gospel is to give you an
[7:37] understanding to make you understand
[7:41] that that you were predestinated
[7:42] eternally that the the the scripture is
[7:45] actually speaking of you in malachi 4 5
[7:47] 6 that your heart is going to be turned
[7:49] it's talking about you it's talking
[7:51] about you in revelation 10 that when
[7:53] john typed you it's speaking of you that
[7:55] he took the book and ate it and you got
[7:57] to take the book and ate it and your
[7:59] eyes began to be opened up to these
[8:00] things god the word is actually giving
[8:03] you understanding
[8:04] and it says i will lead them in paths
[8:06] that they have not known
[8:08] i will make darkness light before them
[8:11] and crooked things straight these things
[8:13] will i do unto them and not forsake them
[8:15] they shall be turned back they shall be
[8:17] greatly ashamed that trust engraven
[8:19] images that say to the molten images you
[8:21] are our gods
[8:22] hear
[8:23] hear ye deaf
[8:25] and look ye blind
[8:27] that ye may see
[8:29] so that's what paul is talking about
[8:31] when he says but we see jesus that our
[8:34] eyes were blinded but now by the
[8:37] preaching of the gospel our eyes our
[8:39] spiritual eyesight has become open and
[8:42] we can see
[8:43] because seeing is an understanding
[8:46] seeing is revelation a revelation of his
[8:49] word and what it what it really is
[8:50] revelation
[8:51] when you read the bible and you've got
[8:53] all these little facts and things that
[8:55] you've got you you read and you read
[8:56] about daniel 70 weeks and you read about
[8:58] the statue of perfect man and you read
[9:00] about the capstone and adoption and it
[9:02] seems like little facts that you're just
[9:04] you're just learning but when god
[9:06] reveals it to you he puts all the pieces
[9:09] together so that you can see a picture
[9:11] and when the pieces come together the
[9:13] clouds not up in the in the cloud the
[9:15] cows not up in the clouds up in the sky
[9:18] the clouds aren't down on the ground the
[9:20] picture is a picture a complete picture
[9:22] that's perfect that you can understand a
[9:25] picture that's painted and what what is
[9:27] the picture the picture is jesus that's
[9:31] why paul said we see jesus
[9:33] but we see jesus
[9:35] and that's why uh i put down at the
[9:37] bottom the scripture in revelation 3 18
[9:39] i counsel thee to buy me gold tried in
[9:41] the fire that the word to the layout i
[9:43] see in church age that thou mayest be
[9:44] rich and white raiment that thou mayest
[9:46] be clothed and that the shame of thy
[9:48] nakedness did not appear and anoint
[9:50] thine eyes with i salve
[9:52] that thou mayest see
[9:53] that's why brother branham i think he
[9:55] made a lot many times he would tell that
[9:56] story of his mama rubbing the
[9:58] grease on his eyes because the
[10:00] grease would open up his eyes in the
[10:02] natural but he gave us a message god get
[10:05] sent a message through that little man
[10:06] to open up our eyes so that we could
[10:08] actually see
[10:10] now if we go to the next slide in the
[10:12] sardisian church age brotherhood said so
[10:13] when
[10:14] when we receive eternal life
[10:17] we're receiving part of that cosmic
[10:19] light that was back yonder before there
[10:22] was ever a molecule
[10:24] uh-huh
[10:26] that light
[10:27] of god
[10:29] comes into our heart
[10:31] that lightens us
[10:32] that we see jesus
[10:35] now now you see you begin to wonder how
[10:37] do i know if i got the new birth
[10:40] the light of god in your heart
[10:43] reveals jesus to you the bible said we
[10:46] don't see all things but we see jesus
[10:50] because as you're hearing the word
[10:52] that it's actually it actually opens up
[10:54] to you so that you see the picture
[10:57] now see how jesus was talking to the
[10:59] pharisees and he was he was telling them
[11:01] they're blind they don't see and you
[11:03] know a lot of times you can you try to
[11:05] explain to a blind person what you
[11:07] should be seeing
[11:08] and you but you you won't ever really
[11:10] understand until you see it for yourself
[11:14] you tell a blind person when you need to
[11:15] be seeing this or you need to
[11:17] look if i maybe if i was trying to
[11:19] explain to a blind person what i'm
[11:21] looking at right now i would say that
[11:22] well there's all these people looking at
[11:24] me and there's a i'm i'm standing up
[11:26] behind the podium up in the front of the
[11:28] room and there's all these things uh you
[11:30] know there's
[11:31] musical instruments behind me and i
[11:33] could try to explain it but when you see
[11:35] it for yourself
[11:37] then you know what it is
[11:39] when you see it for yourself and that's
[11:42] what revelation is when you see for
[11:44] yourself
[11:45] what the bible is talking about
[11:48] that's how you know something's happened
[11:50] when it's revealed to you
[11:52] now if we go to the next slide
[11:55] and again we're talking about paul
[11:57] saying but we see jesus
[11:59] now the the the that's that great story
[12:02] of when the the disciples were walking
[12:04] on the road to emmaus that brother brown
[12:05] a lot of times he would use as an
[12:06] illustration they were walking along and
[12:08] they didn't recognize who jesus was but
[12:10] then he went in and they went in and he
[12:12] shut the door they shut the door and
[12:14] they went into a place and he began to
[12:16] do something like he had done before
[12:18] he began to break that bread and he
[12:20] began to share things to him and their
[12:21] eyes became open and they were wrecking
[12:24] the bible says and their eyes were
[12:25] opened and they knew him they knew him
[12:28] in other words they had an understanding
[12:30] and he vanished out of their sight
[12:32] that's when you know something's
[12:34] happened is when you see
[12:36] when you see jesus when you understand
[12:39] him
[12:40] if we go to the next slide and brother
[12:42] and and and then jesus came and called
[12:44] he said
[12:45] he was that truly he was that plus god
[12:48] see
[12:48] he was the manifestation
[12:52] jesus is the body the boy the man
[12:56] god was what dwelt in him
[12:58] god was in him he was a god man
[13:01] he was a man
[13:03] yet he was god manifested in flesh and
[13:06] flesh so
[13:08] when we see jesus
[13:10] we see god
[13:12] now see how am i supposed to see jesus
[13:14] if he's not here in the flesh
[13:16] if he's not sitting in the pew in this
[13:18] building we see jesus
[13:21] by revelation
[13:23] that's what he said when you see the
[13:24] father see me you see the father
[13:27] we see jesus by the revelation of his
[13:30] word then we see him by the the effects
[13:33] of that revelation in our lives him
[13:36] moving in the church him in changing
[13:39] your life him actually healing people
[13:42] the effects of that life and his power
[13:44] is how we see jesus
[13:47] we know that he's done something for us
[13:49] because we see him
[13:50] and the effect of that of that
[13:52] revelation the effect that it has in our
[13:54] life
[13:56] so on the next slide brother ram said in
[13:57] the message look he said what are you
[13:59] looking at
[14:01] what are you seeing
[14:03] we must see jesus
[14:06] and the only way we see jesus
[14:08] is see the word
[14:11] this is now listen how profound this is
[14:14] we know that jesus is the word in the
[14:16] beginning was the word and the word was
[14:18] god and the word was with god and and
[14:20] those things he's he was the actual
[14:21] expression of god so he's the word but
[14:24] we have a symbol of that word here which
[14:26] is what brother roman said this is the
[14:28] natural symbol of the spirit
[14:31] so when we look he said it is the letter
[14:33] that's the spirit quickens so when i'm
[14:36] reading this word
[14:38] when i'm reading the word the spirit the
[14:40] word the actual word wants to quicken
[14:43] what i have received in my heart
[14:46] he wants to quicken that and make it
[14:48] come alive
[14:49] now what's the only thing that's
[14:50] preventing him from quickening it and
[14:53] brother said he wants to give you the
[14:55] holy ghost more than you want it
[14:57] but why does he what what's preventing
[14:59] it
[15:00] it's my doubt
[15:02] my doubt
[15:04] keeps the spirit from quickening the
[15:06] word
[15:07] my doubt and so that's why we come to
[15:10] church the more word we hear
[15:13] is actually purifying us
[15:15] it's building up within us
[15:17] until we come to a place until we can
[15:20] accept
[15:21] what god said
[15:23] that's why this is the natural symbol of
[15:26] the spirit this is the natural symbol
[15:29] the letters on the page that i can read
[15:32] that is a symbol
[15:34] of the word of god that will quicken
[15:36] this and make it come alive he said you
[15:37] know what i mean
[15:39] it is the letter that the spirit
[15:42] quickens
[15:43] now now you see why the new birth has
[15:45] been taught wrong so many times is
[15:47] because the new birth has been preached
[15:49] that you go to a camp meeting for
[15:50] example and you feel something
[15:52] and there you go you got the new birth
[15:55] but have you received the word
[15:57] have you heard the word without the word
[16:00] without the letter
[16:02] the spirit cannot quicken anything
[16:05] many times people go to it they'll go
[16:06] through a prayer line and they'll
[16:08] they'll get prayed on and they'll think
[16:09] they've got something they'll go away
[16:10] and they and then they'll go back to
[16:12] another prayer line after they after
[16:13] they they they realize well i i went
[16:16] through the prayer line but i still
[16:18] can't get rid of all i still can't get
[16:20] delivered i can't overcome the alcohol
[16:22] the depression the the pornography that
[16:24] all the things i can't overcome because
[16:27] they they didn't get that word
[16:29] the word down in their heart the word is
[16:33] the thing that actually makes a way for
[16:36] the spirit to quicken it the word is the
[16:39] thing that that allows
[16:41] it gives you something to believe
[16:43] it's a natural symbol of the spirit it
[16:46] is the letter that the spirit quickens
[16:48] see that that is the letter that and the
[16:51] spirit quickens this letter
[16:54] and makes it a reality the spirit
[16:57] quickens the letter and makes it a
[17:00] reality
[17:03] so
[17:04] let's let's keep going on there's a lot
[17:05] to be said about that
[17:07] brother ram said on the next slide he
[17:08] said in god's provided place of worship
[17:10] but lord it does delight our hearts when
[17:12] we see jesus glorified among us
[17:16] when we see him glorified
[17:19] when we see
[17:21] his word
[17:23] which he is the word
[17:26] when we see
[17:27] we can read it here in the bible
[17:30] where he promised he would do it
[17:32] then see him
[17:34] work it right in us
[17:36] then we're doing like paul said in
[17:38] hebrews 2 9 but we see jesus
[17:42] we see him in his word we see him
[17:44] performing his word we see him changing
[17:46] our lives we see the effect of his word
[17:49] and we see the word opening up so that
[17:51] when we read our bible it's not a
[17:53] mystery anymore because we see jesus we
[17:56] look into our bible and we see it
[17:59] then in christ the mystery of god
[18:01] revealed now listen to this he said look
[18:04] christ in you
[18:06] makes him the center of life of the
[18:07] revelation
[18:09] see christ's life in you makes him the
[18:11] center of the revelation christ in the
[18:13] bible makes the bible the complete
[18:15] revelation of christ
[18:16] christ in you makes the complete
[18:18] revelation of the whole thing see what
[18:20] croc what god is trying to do
[18:22] what is
[18:23] the new birth then
[18:26] what's the new birth
[18:28] you say well brother brown what is the
[18:30] new birth
[18:31] it is the revelation
[18:33] of jesus christ
[18:35] personally
[18:36] to you
[18:38] the revelation of jesus christ
[18:39] personally to you
[18:41] now now see
[18:44] you say well i well how do i i was
[18:47] talking to one of the one of the young
[18:48] people a while ago and they went to a
[18:50] camp meeting and they went through the
[18:51] prayer line and they were they were they
[18:52] were seeking to know whether they had
[18:54] the new birth or not
[18:56] see see why jesus said he told peter
[18:58] flesh and blood is revealed flesh and
[19:00] blood didn't tell you this but my father
[19:02] which is in heaven it's got to be a
[19:04] revelation
[19:05] and and and one of the young people went
[19:07] through the prayer line and they were
[19:08] wondering whether they had the new birth
[19:09] or not and the preacher told them well i
[19:11] think you yeah i think you got it
[19:13] but see that's flesh and blood
[19:16] flesh and blood cannot tell you it's got
[19:19] to be my father in heaven which reveals
[19:21] you and and i'll be honest that that
[19:24] kind of
[19:26] raised my heckles a little bit because
[19:27] that's great if somebody tells you you
[19:29] got you got the new birth but it how
[19:32] much greater what more sure water
[19:34] prophecy if the father god if your
[19:37] father tells you whether you've got the
[19:39] new birth or not and how he's how is he
[19:42] going to tell you he's going to reveal
[19:44] it to you as you eat the word as you eat
[19:46] now now you might so you might be like
[19:48] sister shepherd laying on there on her
[19:50] couch when she fell asleep and she had a
[19:53] dream about the statue let me not move
[19:55] away too from the microphone she had a
[19:57] dream about the statue of a perfect man
[19:59] and brother brandon preached that sermon
[20:00] about the statue of perfect man she was
[20:02] wondering if she had the new birth and
[20:04] she was born again brother branham said
[20:06] she was
[20:07] and she was wondering if she had the new
[20:08] birth
[20:09] but see
[20:11] as you get built up as you get built up
[20:14] it's beginning to unfold to you until a
[20:16] place till you come to a place where you
[20:17] begin to realize there's been a change
[20:20] in my life
[20:21] something has happened and the opening
[20:24] of the word begins to build confidence
[20:26] in you that something has taken place in
[20:28] my life it's the revelation of the word
[20:31] the revelation of the word that is the
[20:33] main thing what is the new birth it's
[20:35] the revelation of jesus christ
[20:37] personally to you
[20:39] you see how revel when you see jesus
[20:41] that that trumps everything because
[20:43] you're going to have bad days you're
[20:44] going to have good days when you don't
[20:46] feel you don't feel things you don't
[20:48] feel uh i
[20:50] we were actually
[20:51] listening to
[20:53] to marcus becker on the way to church
[20:55] this morning and he was preaching up
[20:56] there in ohio and he was talking about
[20:58] how when you have sisters going through
[21:00] menopause you don't feel too great
[21:03] someday you don't feel too too it's up
[21:05] and down and just anything in life
[21:08] and so you can't base it on how you feel
[21:11] but you can base it on a revelation
[21:13] if god has opened your eyes to the truth
[21:16] and and revealed it to you then you you
[21:19] know that's the rock of revelation that
[21:21] you can base everything on
[21:24] not on how you feel not on whether you
[21:26] went to a camp meeting and felt
[21:28] something or went through a prayer line
[21:30] and somebody laid their hands on you and
[21:31] you and you had confidence in that
[21:33] minister or had had had conf or or felt
[21:36] a little emotion or something but the
[21:39] revelation of his word to you the
[21:42] revelation is something that nobody can
[21:43] take away from you the devil can't take
[21:46] it away from you
[21:48] you can't impersonate a revelation he
[21:50] said the devil can impersonate
[21:52] everything else but he can't bring the
[21:55] word by word he can impersonate feelings
[21:58] he can impersonate lights he can
[21:59] impersonate
[22:01] dreams he can impersonate everything
[22:04] else but he can't impersonate the word
[22:07] the revelation of the word
[22:12] and we got five more minutes let's go on
[22:14] to the next one
[22:17] we see jesus who was made a little lower
[22:19] than the angels for the suffering of
[22:21] death
[22:21] crowned with glory and honor
[22:24] that he by the grace of god
[22:26] should taste death
[22:28] for every man
[22:30] now don't you just love the imagery that
[22:33] paul evokes tasting death like like
[22:36] he
[22:37] almost like he savored it like he he sat
[22:40] down at the table and and tasted it
[22:43] so and he tasted it so that you wouldn't
[22:45] have to
[22:46] now now you you think about jesus
[22:49] how how horrible that was
[22:52] all of that agony and and
[22:55] and and uh being whipped and and and
[22:58] going through the experience of of
[22:59] carrying his cross and
[23:01] and and the fatigue and not being able
[23:03] to get up there and
[23:04] hardly and
[23:06] all that all that he did for you and i
[23:09] and he did it because our sin needed an
[23:12] atonement
[23:16] think about the wrath of god was poured
[23:18] out on that man
[23:19] you know many times we'll come to church
[23:21] and we'll get to thinking well i wonder
[23:23] if god if god hates me i wonder if he
[23:25] even loves me
[23:26] but all of god's wrath was poured on
[23:28] that on that man
[23:30] so that it wouldn't be poured out on you
[23:32] and that proves that god loves you he
[23:33] proves it proves he cares for you
[23:35] because all of that all of that that
[23:37] that man went through all of that that
[23:39] he sacrificed and endured
[23:42] so that you could be saved
[23:44] now if we go to the next slide
[23:47] that he by the grace of god should taste
[23:49] death for every man so he did it for
[23:52] every man for anybody that we believe
[23:56] and not everybody will believe
[23:58] but he did it
[24:00] the way is open the way is made open
[24:03] and that's why in 1st john chapter 2
[24:04] verse 2 it says he is the propitiation
[24:06] for our sins
[24:08] and not for ours only
[24:10] but also for the sins of the whole world
[24:13] whosoever will let him come
[24:15] that's why in john 3 16 that the
[24:17] scripture we all know and we love to
[24:19] quote for god so loved the world that he
[24:21] gave his only begotten son that
[24:23] whosoever believeth in him should not
[24:25] perish
[24:26] but have everlasting life
[24:29] and that's why the bible says in
[24:30] revelation 22 17 whosoever will let him
[24:33] take the water of life freely whosoever
[24:36] will the way is open
[24:38] see many times we get in our head that
[24:40] that if if we want the new birth if we
[24:42] want to come to jesus that we might have
[24:44] to wait 10 or 20 years or so it could be
[24:48] far off because you get in you begin to
[24:50] get in your head that maybe god doesn't
[24:53] love you or you don't understand the way
[24:55] the way to approach him but you don't
[24:57] have to wait
[24:58] you can accept him right now
[25:00] all you got to do the only thing that's
[25:03] keeping the spirit from quickening that
[25:04] word in your life is your doubt so all
[25:07] you've got to do is believe
[25:09] all you've got to do is say
[25:12] and i i can testify of this i can
[25:14] testify my own mind battles of things
[25:17] growing up in the message you know uh i
[25:19] i remember sitting there in my office at
[25:21] work one day just battling something out
[25:23] and i began to think
[25:25] you know i i i believe
[25:27] i believe that what that minister is
[25:29] saying is is true
[25:32] i believe that what he's saying is true
[25:34] after i battled it out and battled it
[25:36] out
[25:36] and it was like it was like heaven just
[25:39] dumped out on me right there in that
[25:40] moment
[25:41] why because in that moment i believed
[25:44] all you've got to do is believe
[25:46] that's what the word is for is to open
[25:48] up a channel to give you something in
[25:51] your heart to so that you can you know
[25:53] what to believe
[25:54] and you know that god loves you and you
[25:57] know that he's there for you and just
[25:59] believe him just take him at his word
[26:04] and john 11 26 says and whosoever liveth
[26:06] and believeth in me shall never die
[26:09] believeth thou this
[26:11] then jesus can go ahead and come forward
[26:13] and we'll
[26:14] we'll close on that
[26:16] believe us thou this
[26:18] all you have to do is believe
[26:20] how simple the gospel is escapes us so
[26:22] many times because we want to make it
[26:24] complicated we want to make it something
[26:26] that's mysterious but it's as simple as
[26:29] can you believe it you love the lord
[26:30] this morning amen
[26:32] god bless you as we turn over the
[26:33] service to the musicians
[26:41] you
