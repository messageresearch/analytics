Brother Richard Wilson I talked to him this morning and he has a real been having problems with the kidney stones and things so just remember that and keep him in your prayers he was in the hospital or at the emergency room Friday night and Saturday night because of the pain and the things and remember Sister Janice too she's having a lot of trouble with arthritis just keep remembering my wife because she's having a lot of problems with her her legs and her hips and her back and everything so just pray if the Lord would reach down I still believe that he said he sent his word and healed us I still say that we're healed we just say that what we are hurting and we're doing and we we need help but we are doing that so remember that amen Romans 8 28 and in Romans 8 14. any other announcements I generally Miss something okay Heavenly Father we thank you for this day in the hour that we have upon the Earth and time to live here Lord into Fellowship together around your word and we pray that you would just bless us now as we read your word because your word is eternal and all we got to do is get into the channel to work that it can come from a head knowledge down into our hearts and be revealed to us and then we'll see how Eternal truly Thy word is we love you and we thank you just have your way bless the sick among us remember Brother Richard our Lord about the kidney stones and things and then the attacks have been bothering him just delivering that all things be made well and Lord we love you and we thank you just touch here Lord send forth your word and heal each one have your way and guide each one in Jesus name amen Romans 8. 28 we all know and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are decalled according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called them he also Justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things what could we say to all that amen right if God be for us who can be against us now drop over to verse 14 the 8th chapter and we'll read just a couple of three verses therefore for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry our thy father and the spirit it says breath witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children now look at it then what is what does we turn out to be if we're children and if children then heirs that's who we are Heirs of what Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if pro-be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the suffering at this present time we're not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we're going to set in things because we're going to put Wade as to be in the Sunday School Superintendent because sometimes people leave and and they don't give don't get nobody to do your job so we're going to set it to a person now that we're you know always said you contact somebody to take your position your your class that day you know but then when it winds up and we get here and nobody don't know who's supposed to be in charge of that class then we you know we have trouble so you know contact somebody and make sure that they will take your class and do it and then contact Wade to make sure you know that everything's doing it when you're going to be missing because you know it's we need to get somebody in in those classes to cover that and we we certainly appreciate all of the ones who teach your classes and things but we want it to be in order too to where that we'll know everything being taken care of instead of coming up and nobody for that class that day so make sure you cover that and cover it with weight because he will be the Sunday School Superintendent to take care of that in all the things all right now we've been speaking for some time now about how does God predestinate how does God predestinate all right we found that he predestinates by his foreknowledge all right and by predestinating by his foreknowledge that's the way the prophet explains it then it does away with all of the thoughts and ideas of mankind of organized religion and then the ones in the message who who have all of these predetermined situations because you know I I I've got a quote where brother or brother random said it you know he said I'm not doing this to to start a doctor and I'm doing this to straighten it out we'll read that in a little while in the message but we found out then that what is the prophet of God say he says predestination looks back to foreknowledge so why would you want predestinate why would you want to predestinate something why would you want to have a consideration of something being predetermined which is what predestination means it means a destiny set beforehand well see God sets his Destiny by his foreknowledge and that way he's not a respecter of persons he knows what we will do he knew what Jacob would do he knew what Esau would do so he could go ahead and say Jacob I love and he saw I hate even before they were born because he's the infinite God all right and see then that way he predestinates he said it five times and the message there of that predestination looks back to foreknowledge then foreknowledge comes back see and then you're looking back the other way and you can see what is Destiny or time and as I've asked you did God set back before the world and think about what we're doing today or is this what we're doing see which one is it which would be the greater you mean you're going to put God to put him back there somewhere why not let him be what he is he's infinite all right see then if he predestinates by his foreknowledge then he's not putting you as the prophet said in a pipe and pushing you through the other end and calling it predestination see if we'd ever thought of that and didn't organize religion you wouldn't have had to split in a Baptist Church split over predestination uh way back 100 years ago or so and uh if you hadn't had that see you know the thoughts and here comes the Presbyterians they came in with the predestination thoughts but everybody's running it into predetermining or said a thing you know that's where it's going to be so if I could be saved I'll be saved if not I won't and there was an old Doctrine back there in the the independent kind of form of of Baptists that even had a doctrine that they didn't want to take their kids to the to a Revival because it might get saved and God wouldn't want them to be and you say well that's great that's a Doctrine that's not my idea you just check it out all right so you find out all these doctrines come down through time and come out into the message of the hour of the people and their doings but yet we see that God he doesn't predestinate by his desires because he desired everybody to be saved if he predestinated by his desire see he'd pick this one he picked this one he'd pick that one he picked that one that would be but he really he predestinates by your desire amen he before the world could write your name in the land's Book of Life or leave it out because of knowing what you would do or I would do when we got here all right so then he's not stamping it we're the ones that stamping it we're the ones that are are making our own predestination we're living our own predestination as to what we do and and the way we live all right see then going back then into the to the the thoughts of what we've been on about the mind of God and see everybody said if I was in the mind of God I I I'm I'm all right well Judas is Garrett was in the mind of God come on his name was written in the Book of Life right not the loud book of life now see his name was written in heaven he remember his disciples sitting there and Jesus said to Rejoice not at the devil's are subject but Rejoice because your names are written in heaven and judas's name was written in heaven but taken out when he rejected Jesus Christ all right so then why would we want to get into a problem of saying or a thought that we would be saying well if I was just in his mind when everybody was in his mind by foreknowledge everybody would ever come into the world was in the mind of God now then what would it be see there's a great difference I tried to get this point across there the other day and I want you to see it there's a great difference in being in the mind or the thinking of God and actually being a part of that God that does the thinking there's a vast difference in it because he could think of everybody in the world and you know the biggest portion of the people of the world are going to die and go to hell one day right because of their choosing not because of what he made them be but by their choosing well he could go ahead and set that and that could be in his thinking all right but yet I'd rather be a part that's what I've always tried to tell you for 40 years now I'd rather be a part of the one that's doing the thinking if I'm a part of the one doing the thinking there's a vast difference between is the thoughts as I said the other day you have thoughts right or all your thoughts part of you or does Satan give you thoughts go on there's a lot of thoughts I get I don't want to be a part of me I have to repent of it I repent for thinking it right do you right well that's not part of me if it was I'd go on with it but it's not part of me but what about an infinite God that the prophet said he cannot have one thought and then have another he said cause his thoughts eternal so then you're servant and eternal God that would know every Nat never flee and whatever it be in the world that's infinite see we're not playing anything over on him by trying to be so smart ethically about what we think intellectually or or uh you know in understanding of scriptures or whatever we should sit down and just say thank you Lord for allowing me to see the truth all right and just forget it and say I don't understand all of it but I certainly believe it all right see because I believe that God before the world according to the scriptures according to the prophet he foreknew everything that would ever transpire if he didn't he's not God that's a simple point but knowing everything then he could go ahead and write the your name in heaven or leave it out because of what you right you desire to me that's simple and and see it doesn't give you eternal life try to read my own notes and sometimes I Mark two of them can't even read them but see it does not give us eternal life to be in his thinking right are you listening it doesn't give you eternal life to be in the thinking of God because Judas was in his thinking so was Adolf Hitler whatever you want to go or who would you want to put there but if we're a part of the one who done the thinking then we have eternal life so the main thing is to see in whether or not we have eternal life not to try to figure out what I was before the world because the prophet says we want nothing we was only in his thinking see we want to get into all of those little doctrinal ideas and bring in a Mormon doctrine of pre-existence and have everybody up in heaven that's people the prophet said we wasn't there see that's the main thing that I've tried to get you to look at in the past few messages is to be able to look back and see God and how great he could be but yet us not being there as people I don't believe that we were up in heaven as people that's pre-existence I believe that you and I were in God's thinking amen of what we would be when we got here all right now in doing that sure then he could see who would accept him and who would not if we just go back to that simple point of him in his mind and look at it as the point of saying it's not that I just want to be in God's mind I want to be a child of God I want to be his offspring see then we know that that way we didn't come into the world with eternal life he said well I've got a quote well okay we got a lot of message too so we're not fighting quotes we're talking about understanding in a simple point to me is very simple if we come into the world with eternal life then Jesus Christ never had to die so we're going to have to back up our predestination you know we're already here we know that they would have to back it up and we would get out to get down there with Nicodemus Nicodemus had a pretty good understanding and what we'd be saying is Nicodemus you don't need a new birth you need to you just need to get your thinking straightened out you need to realize you always was that was his Doctrine that was the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees that they were the children of God they laid on circumcision as to cleanse in the flesh and their belief was that they had eternal life eternal life was not a a new doctrine when Jesus began to speak of it because see they believed they were Eternal children of God but now if Jesus Christ didn't die we can't have eternal life because there's no way to impart it I know I've tried for 40 something years to get to people the message to see the one thing nobody had eternal life as a possession a new birth whatever until Jesus Christ came and died to give his life all right even the disciples as I was saying the other day where it says to them in Jesus actually breathed on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost I mean if I was a person trying to prove a point that'd be the scripture I'd go to I said look at her he said receive it let's see thank God for a prophet that told us that that was a promise it didn't take place until the day of Pentecost but yet everybody thinks well you know eternal life is just a thought eternal life is a person right it's a person it's not a thought or an idea a concept or a Doctrine or something that you have it's a person of Jesus Christ Living inside of you by the new birth all right and by doing that then see we come to a wonderful position and we read our enrollments about the children of God and if we're children of God then we are joint heirs with Jesus Christ that is what we just read out of scripture we're Heirs of God now there was no way the human body human body are you understanding me there was no way that human body they lived on the earth years ago called Jesus Christ there was no way he could give you eternal life now I know what the Bible says come on don't get me messed up that the son had within him to be right he had within him the ability to bring eternal life into existence but it would have to wait until Calvary that was when it would come into existence not right then right see people who lay on with a little woman at the well you know she said we know that Dr Messiah Jesus brother random will say see there said that word was quickened right there sure it was it was quick unto her who was standing there and that quickening was eternal because it was a revelation but it didn't give the woman eternal life she had to go to Calvary you know what I mean she had to go to the upper room to receive the new birth see we just keep that in line I was talking another day waiting that was right now hunting him another random said in the seal book it's either in the right at the end of the six the old questions and answers or the seventh one of the right in there but around said go on with the same simple message he said because if you don't said you'll work yourself away from it now what is the same simple message one God what a baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ no Eternal Hells serpent seed the truth of that godhead and how it is the new birth and how did its justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost not just because you say you believe the message the devil does too so you're going to give him the Holy Ghost but you see the same simple message then then no matter where you go in the message and how deep you preach it you have something to be anchored to but if you get this fancy Doctrine the always was eternal I don't need eternal life I always was eternal I had eternal life when I come into the world well you've annihilated all of the doctrine of the Lord Jesus which was his first doctor and when he said you must be born again you've annihilated all of that you destroyed all of the Bible well yet that's not going to convert anybody but it may keep you and I from getting messed up with it you know that's why you say well brother there you sure are Stern and hard here's one thing about it you know what I believe amen you don't have to worry about what brother Dale believes you just sit down and listen you find out what he believes but I don't play around with the word amen I tell you what I believe right or wrong I'm going to tell you because if I'm wrong and you help me I'm I can be made right all right but are you listening and see what I'm saying then see then it's very easy to by way of the Prophet messenger and you see my background I've done been through this the message on Christ I miss your God reveal he said God had a plan and a purpose he had a motive then right doing it he was going to see his word achieved he was going to bring forth all of his attributes and things all right so he's going to do that but how could he do that and there's nobody lost he could be a father because he created us Adam Eve made him father the Angels made him God when they were created first you know object of worship when he was a Healer and a savior how could that be done so he could not make I gave you the quotes in the prophet he could not make you lost and die then die for your sins you're getting it wrong he can't make you lost where would you get that out of God working evil and I know even the Bible says I know good and evil I create evil Maybe but how can God create evil where did he get it from your God is an evil God no you look up and you see that he's saying I permit these things to come into being I allow these things to transpire to fulfill my word so he knew the prophet said if he created us with a free moral agency that's what he said we were right he said that even made us equal with him when he gave us free moral agency not equal as a God not being that way he gave us a choice we're predetermining wouldn't give you a choice predetermining that's it you can't go no other way but when he gave you a choice you could decide whether you wanted to be saved or not then he could look down and the prophet said it like this he knew people would be lost and would want to be saved so he made a way for them to be saved all right see in that way he could predetermine the fact that he would have to come and die so he could write it in the last book of life before the foundation of the world and be standing as the lamb slain but yet if he hadn't to come into the World 2000 years ago and fulfill that it would have made the Bible false prophecy so look what you're doing you might think that you don't need salvation and the people of this message May preach to their people that they don't need salvation they just need to believe that's a good old Baptist Doctrine I had enough of that one for another for about 10 years what you see to look at it and see that you must be born again it's not a choice or a thought it's a fact you must be born again of course if you're not born again you're lost yeah but but what about all these quotes well what about all of them keep reading read backwards and forth around that quote and see if this statement is not there the prophet said if you have eternal life you always was eternal that new birth gives you eternal life that eternal life is just as Eternal as God because it is God's life then giving you eternal life makes you a part of God not just something's thinking about so you can be in his thinking and still be lost but if you're a part of God you can never be lost you see the only way to have eternal life is to have his life come on how many years did it take to get it out of us that we believe that hell is eternal because we've been taught that all of her life you know the prophet said there's no such thing as an eternal hell because you'd have to have eternal life to live in hell amen and that would make hell Eternal because a place where you'd be at would be you know and you'd be burning for eternity but see that's a good old Baptist spiritum tactic you know scare people into being saved by threatening them with hell being Eternal and you're going to burn that one of these days for eternity but it ain't even in the scripture because if you have an eternal hell then you're going to have to put God in hell all right but you see as I said I don't want to be something God thought of because that leaves me still in a position that I must do something about it I must receive eternal life and that's what we're going to talk about today see I want to be a part of God now brother Dale that's just a little bit too far well now you tell me what eternal life is I ended up Wednesday talking about that you explained to me what eternal life is eternal life is the life of God there's only one eternal life that's Zoe God's own life all right now then I want to be what the scripture says I am that we read that we were his children the spirit Itself by our witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children in heirs watch him Heirs of God okay and join ours with Christ amen that's what we just read in Romans all right but see if we're a part of God and we can only be a part of God by the new birth there's no way us human Mortals could be part of God without God's Life coming in US that should be sensible yes what brother Dale you just you just don't understand the great revelation yeah I know it because your great Revelation is destroying the Bible and destroying the prophet's message by quoting him to death yes but he says I always was eternal read and see what he's talking about he said if you have eternal life you always was eternal he said if you don't have eternal life you're lost all right so what would it be then see I want to be a part of God well no no brother then what I want to do is be a son of God I'll get to it this afternoon we don't believe in Eternal sonship so now where are you going right right you want to be an eternal Son of God I wanted a Bible for it I want the prophets words for it a Son of God can't be eternal okay that's why Jesus had a beginning God never had a beginning now who are you talking about so you know what are you talking about that's just annihilated the understanding if you understand what I'm saying the word right around him would say Jesus had a beginning but God never had one he said that's the difference in Jesus and God he said God had eternal life Jesus he had a beginning now what's he talking about you don't realize that's just annihilated everything you could accomprehend or try to comprehend what part of Jesus was not eternal the body right so Jesus the body had a beginning but the God that was inside of there never had a beginning so it's whether or not we understand one God see that's the key to the whole thing the key to understanding how you can be part of God is to realize that that man that stood on the shores of God only two thousand years ago was a human body created that body was made Eternal in the resurrection in it and going up right now but yet while he was on Earth that body had to eat that body had to sleep that body was sick why because it had a beginning and it had to be made eternal and he did in his resurrection and Ascension see if you understand one God you don't have no problem see the one God then is not the father Son and Holy Ghost Blessed Trinity you know co-equal and co-eternal none of that sitting in scripture at all see Jesus the man that walked on the shores of Galilee the Bible said in him dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily that's why he could stand there and say when they said show us the father he said look if you've seen me you've seen the father why because God was inside that man that's where when that body dropped forth from Mary which is just an incubator to carry it but drop forth from Mary then God's own life came into that body all right in God's own life living in that body would be spirit and soul of God amen living in a mortal body and would take that mortal body to Eternity amen now what's the difference in you and what you're doing that's right amen we come into the world lost we know that or should do omed in on their way to hell the prophet said even him bastard born they don't want to quote brother Branham illegitimate child all of us are by the Fall right don't you talk about my my folks boy I'll tell you what well your folks are just like my folks nothing but that's why I said you black people you at least got something you can look back to you can run your roots to Africa we can't run Our Roots nowhere they call us a Caucasian I give my own term of that 40 years ago we ain't nothing but a concoction we're just a mixed up breed we can't run it back yeah you're thrown off of my parents no I'm not you got any sense at all you are all right but listen we know we're lost now how can I then in this life become a part of God it would have to mean that he would have to impart that eternal life that's why the prophet will say it like this a good point would you send a child to die in your place or would you go yourself he said God never sent a son to die that he came himself that's why he's called son we'll get more this evening why because he's in flesh labeling its son that's why he's called a son but show me the Bible where he's an eternal son you can't find it all right but to be a part of God then I must receive eternal life and I received that by the new birth now then that life that's within me is God's own life give an eternal life to me all right now what am I doing as I said I want to go about Jesus let eternal life that was in him took that flesh to a change that's what the new birth is to do to you and I take us to a change to where the rest of us can be made eternal that's why this message had to come right you had eternal life down through time in the ages by the new birth but none of those ages could deal with a Redemption of a body that's why this message had to come to be the entire Bible but see to make then us to be part of God by the new birth not just make us a son of God see because the sun has a beginning you better start thinking about what the real truth of the word is are we a Son of God or are we God made manifest in flesh called a son now which one's correct if we're a Son of God that's eternal sonship come on but if we can receive the new birth and that Soul be made eternal then I have no problems with all the quotes I always was eternal what was always eternal the life of God simple so when the prophet says we always was eternal I say Amen because he's not talking about what you're looking at right he's talking about what's inside the person of eternal life they never forget that just because we have taken it now back up in the message part of talking about in the mind of God to get back into the mind of God that the prophet said in the back part of God's mind never forget where you come from don't ever forget the point that we must be born again because if you always was eternal you don't need to be born again and if people don't even realize that two Soul Doctrine is still here because that's what I told them then two Soul Doctrine was if you was like Judas he only had one soul that come from the Devil if you could be born again you had two Souls one from the devil and one from God that made Satan a Creator so yeah the message and now the Bible okay but I told him I said all right let's go along with it if you say all you had to do was kill that old soul I'll just get me a gun and the old Soul's gone you automatically in heaven people don't like my ideas me and I don't like my ideas and that's the word surely don't you take a man out here and he's raping a raped a child and molested or something else put him in jail you don't have to kill him put him in jail the rest of his life but castrate him before you send him there then you ain't got no worries about him the rest of his life people don't like my ideas but if you had those type of ideas you'd sure do it away with a lot of that garbage can call the laws of the land but get the point in God's thinking right in God's thinking he had a family sure amen hey come on this is kind of a little bit ahead but we'll back up to it later he had a family he had offspring well you said well how in the world can you prove that because we are now right come on are you thinking we are now the children of God we just read it and we are his offspring and we're Heirs of God which means whatever God's God I've got right and join The Heirs with Jesus Christ to make sure that this anchors down real good amen to show you where it come from because if he hadn't to give that life that was in him you and I wouldn't have eternal life he had to release that life that was in him to go out so there's your one God body of man spirit and soul Eternal God he had to down Calvary release that Soul then he could come back not just the spirit because the spirit is already anointing Spirit at that time was anointing people like Caiaphas they would even prophesy of the coming of the Lord and what had to be done Balaam could even prophesy but yet he couldn't dig down in far enough to see the truth of the Soul Jesus was a very Body Spirit and soul of almighty God and that's not one that's Doctrine number one he is is not one that's Doctrine because there was a time that he was dealing with Father the time dealing with son and time dealing with the Holy Ghost that's good but you know what the rest of it is he the one that's doctrines one like your finger Jesus in the Old Testament Jesus living back here and Jesus now that's a Oneness Doctrine we don't believe in that right you know why I don't believe in it because I believe your God made manifest that's the reason I don't believe in Oneness I don't believe right around him was the teaching and Oneness why because he taught me just what I believe I'm looking at children of God Sons and Daughters of a living God who have received the new birth making their soul Eternal amen no wonder Paul could say we are his offspring they're in the book of Acts because that's who we are but you know what he was quoting from if you think I wouldn't write while I go into thinking the Pharisees and Sadducees and the different ones that people didn't believe in eternal life back there what was Paul talking about get into accident where he's talking he said some of your poets talking about what they believe some of your poets have said we are his offspring see they believed it why do you want to believe any Doctrine if there's no connection to eternal life you know oh I swear I never could understand the Sadducees I still don't understand them how they couldn't believe in the resurrection I still have my own thoughts on that but that's my own thoughts my own thoughts is that that they believed in the final day Resurrection but not a resurrection in any other way the Pharisees took a resurrection because they could do with Enoch and a Elijah and the different ones who were translated and things that happened would you tell me them sad you see said we're going to die and just become non-existent I've never believed that was a Sadducees Doctrine maybe now I said that's me because it's what we've always said Pharisees believed in the resurrection Sadducees don't believe in the resurrection now what do they believe well probably I mean they had to go somewhere where'd he go we don't know where he goes God he don't go nowhere see we get something in their mind that's been handed down and we just take it for being a thought instead of studying it out to see what's going on well I I just brought it down I don't want to get confused don't worry about you already are you're already confused don't worry about it we've been confused all of our life we're getting out of the confusion by the revealed word and that's the only way it will get out of confusions by the review word but you see Church being a part of God I don't know where you think about that like I do see if you ask most people how they got their self well I'm a son of Jesus it was a son of God Jesus the flesh never gave you eternal life he could not give eternal life even when he said the son had power to give life he's not talking about the flesh he's talking about the one that was in him ask anything ask the father anything well he said because it's a father asking not you asking I remember about 40 years ago my wife said well that's simple to understand it's not you asking it's the Holy Ghost asking his father this one's asking Jesus said I do nothing until my father shows me that was the outside connected with the inside but he was a part of God he was a fullness you and I are apart that can make the fullness you know what brother Brown said you know that the godhead is not complete without you I get time that's in here somewhere the God he is not complete without you if you have eternal life today God is not complete without you you see why you're going to go in a Rapture you're going to go on a change and I don't mean this wrong and don't think it stupidly but you can't sin enough to be lost if you're already born again but don't worry about it you won't want to but it'd be impossible to be able to do it well he could give me the Holy Ghost and take it away he can give and take away that's good Methodist as Indian giver probably said we don't believe in that when you see what I'm getting at the eternal life that you and I have by the new birth and that's the only way to get it now even the foolish virgins they don't get eternal life here right right they have to go to the watch on judgment to be given eternal life they don't have it here but yet they're Justified and sanctified good believers but they don't get eternal life until they go to the whites on judgment but you see the Bride of Jesus Christ receives eternal life here by going through justification sanctification of baptism with all the ghost and receiving the life of God we have the new birth then that new birth is a part of God making us a child of God now watch that one this evening because I know your mind will hook onto a thought see then you'd say a child of God is the son of God that's what I'm trying to get out of the way this morning where that won't go into your mind this evening he said well the child of God is the Son of God now what are you talking about he Sons you talking about sonship or what are you talking about we don't believe in eternal sonship and the children of God are eternal but the brown said Jesus was God made manifest in flesh called a son because what else you're going to call him it was it when they throwed the Hebrew children into the fiery furnace I always said that man had a pretty good who wouldn't Nebuchadnezzar he didn't we throw in threes and now there's four and he's like the son of God in other words if there's anything he's seen it had a son effect and anything that could keep them others from being killed and he could stand it too it had to be God so he had a good understanding but you see we get our thoughts into our mind and we we have trouble comprehending that we are The Offspring of God we're his children and his children existed with him now here we're going his children existed with him when he was self-existing all right see that's what I've been aiming at now listen if you don't agree with me office will be open see the children of God or God made manifest his attributes he said well that's making us back there you're not listening what if I said was the only thing that was with God in the beginning God when he dwelled alone he was self-existing but he had attributes he had his thinking his children was in his mind in his thinking the prophet said that gives an eternal quality to the elect I believe in eternal life and made the drawing to show you when it comes up to the mind and then going on back into the back part of God's mind and when you do you look back and you get there and you see Jesus Christ but not as a person he didn't stand back there that's eternal sonship you see Jesus Christ which was almighty God that's what I was trying to get across our lives with our lives this past Wednesday Jesus was the only name God ever had you want to know the name of God his name's Jesus simple he said I come to my father's name simple Jesus Christ he's the Eternal God amen Jesus the flesh at a beginning Jesus the Christ the Christ that went out of God was the logos that begin to create the speech the flesh wasn't back there well now if his flesh wasn't back there why do we want to be back there I told you is that still that old thing that bothers mankind called an ego we just want something special about this thing it's just got to be you know hey don't you think I'm pretty the only thing I want to know about it is tell me about my father and if Jesus is not a second person then why do you want to be a second person great but around said he's not a second person he's not even the first person because you see if you say he's the first person that means it's something different he said he is the person well see why Can't We Believe by the new birth that we are the children of God that we're his offspring and that eternal life that we have is the eternal life God had before the world ever begun so he had his children with him but not back there as we look at it when we say he was there with his children with his offspring we look around one two three four five get out behind a tree 11 12 13 14 feet the prophet of God said we weren't Spirits we were nothing he said we was any thinking what was in his thinking his offspring his children be careful now that's predestination they got a couple of messages later get on to it we'll mark here and start here and go that way but what does it mean to be a part of God amen the first part it means is we're not all right because I can't be all by myself brother Mo years ago helped me to understand that he said we think about cutting up God like an apple you know parts and we give away the Apple and we're out of parts it's no such thing with God the more he gives away the greater he becomes if you'd ever get that into your mind you'd want to try to find out what you are and what you're here for the prophet of God said whenever I'd realize who she is and what she's here for we're here to strip Satan from his doing the people's mind and get it out of our minds the things that we've been taught you see then to be that it wasn't you and I backed our as people he was self-existing now come on he existed alone well you just said he existed with his family that's exactly what I said because when I look at it I'm looking at a family as to being part of God I'm not looking at as a god having a family that's what you're thinking you're thinking that I'm saying God is here and he's got a family that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about God with his children his offspring that's a part of him remember sons are not eternal they have a beginning there's no such thing as eternal sonship we'll go to this evening to know what the prophet said there's an eternal godship there's an eternal godhead but think about it this whole thing is to me is it like a person with a it's a carnal comparison with a person with their family and like I told you we can take the DNA and you can run a take a man especially and run it because they can run to women the same way because they have the DNA and they transmit it and you can run back with it with Eve to the Garden this as well as you can run back with Adam to the garden you get into science and study it a little we got nurses that can tell you a little bit about it but listen that Eternal God had within him the attributes and those attributes is what you and I are it's like I said it's carnal comparison though because see you can take you can say well there was a day that that Wade and Terence and Anna was in me because you're coming down to a germ form but that's not a way to see God because the prophet of God covered it back to a a germ and a gene you see my kids could be in me in a germ form but they can't be you know I didn't have them my my daddy didn't have my kids in him as a germ for him are you listening my daddy didn't have weighed in me you know and that way coming that way my daddy had a gene a DNA makeup that could be transmitted down to me and then through wedlock a germ could come into being to produce a child are you with me so then even in the natural you can't run it back when the prophet says we were in our great great great grandfather you know you wasn't back there as a germ some kind of a sperm he was there only in his at a gene form that has to be transmitted down to become a germ see God we were part of God to eternal life that we have not the people that we're looking at right not Body Spirit and soul of a human mortal being but that eternal life that was in God in the beginning is the eternal life that's in You Now by the new birth right and that new verse coming in you giving you eternal life that makes you a child of God it doesn't make you a child of Jesus it was a child of God you're getting into your natural genomic genealogies that fleshed man had to be made eternal this flesh man has to be made eternal to really be the children we want him to be why does it say now I'm going to get this point and not as quick as I forget the notes why does it say that we will be as I read there when does it say we are the children of God and if we're the children of God then we're heirs of God right then why does it turn around and say and join ours with Jesus Christ come on you got your scripture where is it Romans 8 16 and the spirit itself birth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs means hold it just a minute now and think about what you're saying ain't no English major but that does mean what it's saying right stop don't period it and start another thing stop and think about what you're saying and his children than heirs Heirs of God and as a conjunction if you want to translate it even that's fine and join ours with Christ now what does that mean and he didn't say now so follow me he didn't say join ours with Jesus because that connects to the flesh all right have a priest enough of it you understand me he didn't say John Ayers with Jesus said John Arthur Christ is the anointing the logos the theophany etc etc that come out of God the Son of God that came out of God in the beginning he said let there be but wanted to say Heirs of God if it's Heirs of God that's eternal life what a wonderful thing to think about but then join ours with Christ you see because if Christ had not come into the being in a flesh man you and I could not be Heirs of God he made the way that we could be The Heirs of God and we're joint heirs but around said whatever was lost in the garden he said Jesus Christ brought back he says then watch it and there's a quote laying in here he said then he's not waiting on him said he's waiting on you you realize it God is waiting on you and I to realize Who We Are well I'm a Child of God yeah but how do you believe that look how easy it is to be you're a child of Jesus it was a child of God now you're a grandchild so you don't have errors with your father see The Heirs of the father come first read it Heirs of God and Joint heirs see bringing it down to where that that's the only way you and I can have eternal life is for God to become flesh and dwell Among Us live in a human body and on Calvary release that soul out of that body the word could go up and then come back the prophet said he sent back on the day of Pentecost it is soul in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said after it's given out here and giving out here and giving out it'll all come together see the eternal life that we have is what was in God before the world not you and I as peoples and I hope you're listening to Jesus the flesh was not in God in the beginning you know what I mean because that would have put somebody standing there but Jesus is not a a second or third person he is the person that's the only way you and I can get eternal life that's what he was trying to tell Nicodemus that you must be born again I've got to go what was he explaining to him that's why Nicodemus he said if I can't tell you these things I'll even talk to you he was finally telling him I've got to go to Calvary I've got to release a life that's within me or you cannot be born again come on wouldn't that what he was telling me there's the only way it could be done the only way you can be saved today is for Jesus Christ come and live in you then that Christ that come and live in you and I always was eternal I can rejoice and take I don't have to deny anything the prophet says I can take all he says and it'll come together and if you have eternal life today that eternal life in you always was eternal you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what is brother random what is we ask the prophet to answer questions right around him what is the gift of God he said it's eternal life through Jesus Christ right see we've got somebody we can go ask the questions too of course that's the way people think those are he's not here to answer well he's already answered it what is it Christ the mystery God's revealed where he said brother random said what is the new birth or the baptism what is a new birth thing he said he says it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ coming living in you all you got to do is just say sit down in front of your computer and do me a favor in case I don't get back to preaching on this month you that look on your computer Line run in part of God just run in that lock it in run it in part of God and see that if ever quote of that I forgot how many there is way up the high number because I looked at him what is it being a part of God every one of those quotes you'll see him relating that we must be born again go through it when you go it'll really give you something to do I like to sign homework go home and run it in your computer go and run in in his thinking run in attributes of God and be ready to read for an hour well because sometimes it'll be 50 70 500 300. but if you're really going to do it when I run those things in I read them because I do not want to leave one of them out to where that it would seem contrary I want to read what he says if we're a part of God then God is now being made manifest in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was might flesh and dwelt Among Us well don't you believe that's for you and I like I was saying the other night about the name and his word being the same then you ought to be able to read Revelations 19 of their words coming on that white horse and it said he had a name written and no man you and it's called the word of God people going haywire trying to figure that out it's very simple his name is his word his word is his name his name is Jesus oh what brother Dale you don't understand the Bible says ask your father anything in my name that's two people Jesus said he had a father amen he did have a father brother Branham says it there in Hebrews 10 5 where it says the body that he said the father provided the body he did he couldn't provide his own body you see it's coming down to if we don't leave and let me say that again see the prophet said stay with a sign simple message well if you stay with the same simple message then everything else is going to fit into that but if not you're going to go that away and you're just going to get your ideas and your thoughts come on brother you get your ideas your thoughts your opinions and then you'll come up well we don't need salvation we just we just needed this message to tell us we're eternal read that part of God just do that do me that much of a favor and look of how many times that he's talking about you must receive the new birth you must be born again think on these things let's Stand Together what about it are you a part of God or what is it has God imparted his own life into you making him in you together as one see I do believe then before the foundation of the world that God dwelt Alone with his attributes you know what those attributes were his children but he was self-existing now I'm going to State this one more time because I've done it for 40 years see if you're going to make it predetermined predestinated predestinated predestinated I'm a predestinated seat he predestinated predestinated now when you go back to self-existing you just predestinated yourself out of existence you think that don't mean nothing one of these days it'll click what I'm talking about you just want to make yourself I just feel like I was back there he predestinated me well we just backed up into God's mind a little father and you're out that away and his children is back here are you listening his children are back here in his mind and you just predestinated yourself out of existence you become non-existent because you can't go any further than a predestinated stamp of what you think that you see when we get back to it when the morning star sign together and the sons of God shouted for Joy you can see how it can come all the way down those children will be made flesh but that's not eternal sonship it's the eternal godship he doesn't predestinate by his desires he said well you just said he had children did he desire to be made manifest right but he didn't make them to do that right they're part of him go ahead what do we got 272 272 let's sing and anybody have a need the owners open anybody have a knee foreign just feed me Lord Jesus we asked him down anybody else sing that to one another if you're leaving you're dismissed oh yeah Bread of Heaven foreign
