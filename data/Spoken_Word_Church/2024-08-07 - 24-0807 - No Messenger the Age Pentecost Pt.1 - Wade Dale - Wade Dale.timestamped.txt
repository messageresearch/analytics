[0:52] bigger getting there how about that that
[0:55] better okay all

[1:00] a couple of announcements um number one
[1:03] pray for brother Aaron bless his heart
[1:05] he just called he's got U his either his
[1:08] basement or his house is flooded with
[1:10] water the electric
[1:14] heater I ain't going to make us a
[1:16] Doctrine but if you'll get you a gas
[1:17] heater that won't
[1:18] happen I have never had electric water
[1:21] yeah water heater I think we had one one
[1:22] time in the trailer we lived in and it
[1:25] did the same thing so get you a gas
[1:28] one exactly
[1:30] so but pray for him he's uh he's
[1:33] battling that tonight so just uh pray
[1:36] for him that he will get that thing
[1:38] fixed also uh brother George Quinn is as
[1:41] brother Ryan announced will be here this
[1:43] weekend with us we're going to Ruth
[1:45] tomorrow um mom and sister Jo and myself
[1:49] and jun's going and coming back on um
[1:54] Friday afternoon so just keep us in
[1:56] prayer uh brother George Quinn did a
[1:58] little uh did a memorial for uh for dad
[2:02] today and didn't know brother George
[2:04] could play the guitar but brother George
[2:06] since we saw him online playing the
[2:08] guitar guess what brother George is
[2:09] going to do when he gets here Sunday he
[2:12] may not know it yet but I'll let him
[2:14] know
[2:15] Saturday that he's going to play the
[2:17] guitar
[2:19] so
[2:21] H am I good what's wrong is it me or
[2:26] y'all I'm fading in and out I'm not
[2:29] fading in and out my voice might be but
[2:31] I'm not I hope I'm doing all right so
[2:34] anyway brother George will be here um
[2:37] the 18th which will be the next Sunday
[2:40] after I'll be at Brother Richard Wilson
[2:42] brother Aaron and brother um Bob will be
[2:46] taking the service we'll be at Brother
[2:49] Richard Wilson's for that
[2:51] weekend uh also this coming Sunday the
[2:53] Lord willing uh we're going to have a
[2:56] ordination service we have a new Deacon
[2:59] um brother Brother Anderson marunga is
[3:01] going to be a a deacon in our church and
[3:04] we're going to
[3:06] uh um do a Serv ordination service and
[3:10] also brother Danny Fountain going to be
[3:12] a new trustee so we are uh happy that uh
[3:17] that we are uh adding some too and
[3:21] people are growing and and they're uh
[3:24] surely qualified to do the job and also
[3:28] some of the things that we discussed
[3:30] reason I'm going to tell you now is
[3:32] because there's going to be a few
[3:33] changes and like brother Keith said a
[3:35] lot of people online this is going to
[3:37] affect them more than it is you at right
[3:39] now but we're going to start doing um
[3:44] now you continue to pay your tithe and
[3:45] offering the same way you're doing it
[3:48] but we will have an option on our
[3:50] website to donate money or pay TI or to
[3:56] uh contribute to the building fund all
[3:59] right so we're going to do that online
[4:02] brother Joe and brother Lise and sister
[4:04] Lisa is going to get together and we
[4:05] will have that option you don't have to
[4:07] do it but it's just an option um we've
[4:11] had a sister in Canada that's been
[4:12] watching since about January and she's
[4:14] been trying to pay her ties so we're
[4:16] going to make it where they can do it a
[4:17] little bit better and U and a little bit
[4:22] more smooth uh we do it all the time
[4:25] let's don't get all let's don't get all
[4:27] giddy about it as more money probably
[4:29] goes through through electronic now than
[4:30] it does in the hands of the people right
[4:33] brother John yeah so that's just the way
[4:35] it is and we hope and we there's filters
[4:38] and there's prayer amen that we can make
[4:41] sure this thing goes right also now
[4:45] starting on the 8th of
[4:49] September all right actually it starts
[4:52] the 1st of September but that's uh
[4:55] communion Sunday but on the 8th of
[4:57] September we will be doing away with our
[5:00] second service all right couple of
[5:04] reasons for that couple of things have
[5:07] come up that we have I've been praying
[5:10] about it for about two months and we
[5:14] won't have a second service per
[5:17] se as usual all right we're going to
[5:21] start about 10 we'll start at 10: in the
[5:22] morning and we'll continue our service
[5:25] reason being number one
[5:29] we have the word established in our
[5:32] heart I hope now some of you young ones
[5:33] may not but you're getting
[5:37] there everybody with
[5:39] me but there's got to be some Dynamics
[5:43] on that mechanics right everybody with
[5:46] me amen there's got to be worship Sunday
[5:49] was a prime example brother Keith he he
[5:52] went a little long that's okay but about
[5:55] 10 minutes till 12 everybody in the
[5:57] building pretty much starts looking at
[5:59] the wife and getting nervous about
[6:01] coming up to 12:00 I got to cook my food
[6:03] I got to do this I got to do that and
[6:06] then we wanted to worship there was some
[6:07] of you worshiping with your hands up and
[6:09] and um and weeping but we had to cut the
[6:12] service short because we had to stop
[6:15] yeah we we could have continued on but
[6:17] that would have squeezed everything
[6:19] together and made us all
[6:20] nervous so what we're going to do is try
[6:22] to have now
[6:25] one Quality Service instead of two
[6:28] quantity services
[6:31] now and the service will run we'll do
[6:33] just about the same format but we'll be
[6:35] able to worship more free after the
[6:40] service is over we want to worship I
[6:42] Believe In Worship I believe in the word
[6:45] but
[6:46] remember in the
[6:49] Bible the children of Israel set what
[6:51] first the singers the singers went
[6:55] first and the singers is what helped in
[6:58] the battle
[7:00] because they got the mood set right
[7:02] right so we're going to try this until
[7:04] the end of the year there's 16 Sundays
[7:07] left and a couple of them we weren't
[7:08] going to have second service
[7:10] anyway but we're going to try that but
[7:12] also the first Sunday of every month
[7:15] that's why I'm going to announce this
[7:16] the whole month the first Sunday of
[7:17] every month we will have communion so we
[7:20] will excuse me we will have a second
[7:22] service the first Sunday of every month
[7:24] all right because we will do our
[7:26] communion service then also we have
[7:28] option to do uh now we can do bible
[7:31] study on Sunday afternoon instead of
[7:34] coming all back up here on
[7:37] Saturday we can have it on Sunday
[7:39] afternoon we can have our questions and
[7:41] answers brother Dell had questions and
[7:42] answers remember and he'd take a whole
[7:44] second service and do questions and
[7:45] answers so we're not doing away and
[7:47] we're not shunning our
[7:49] responsibilities we're just going to
[7:51] shift it around a little bit to where I
[7:52] think we can be a little more efficient
[7:54] in our worship service where we don't
[7:56] have to keep looking at our watch and
[7:59] and cut off then maybe the spirit of the
[8:01] Lord wants to move a little bit more and
[8:05] we are on time restraints and we're not
[8:07] going to do that anymore so we're going
[8:09] to try it just pray about it um I got a
[8:13] couple of good text messages a little
[8:14] bit ago in uh in a email from somebody
[8:18] that said they really think it'll work
[8:21] if we'll let it work it'll work we can
[8:24] also have a youth service in the
[8:26] afternoon some Sunday afternoon if we
[8:28] want to some us stay over uh like
[8:31] brother Joe if we're going to do we're
[8:33] going to do the worship service still
[8:35] like we did once every other month and
[8:36] then brother John will be able to we
[8:37] weave all that in to let him do his
[8:39] financial peace um service there if if
[8:43] need
[8:44] be and then we will have um time to have
[8:49] our worship song service and uh and
[8:53] brother joke and we're going to get a
[8:54] schedule together like I said before
[8:56] we're not just going to end it and cut
[8:58] out of here and and shun our
[9:00] responsibilities no probably 90% of the
[9:02] time I'll be here and like brother Joe
[9:05] suggested too that if you want to come
[9:06] and stay in Fellowship what do we do
[9:08] outside when we get done we stand out
[9:10] there for two hours in Fellowship okay
[9:13] so let's just bring a meal we Fellowship
[9:14] downstairs and if there's any questions
[9:16] if anybody the kids want to practice or
[9:18] we can there's a lot of options by
[9:21] having one good quality service and and
[9:25] I'm sorry but if you're if you're one of
[9:27] these then I'm talking to you 20% of the
[9:30] people don't come back to second service
[9:31] no way so you've already decided to have
[9:34] just one service a
[9:36] Sunday
[9:38] amen and it takes away from being the
[9:40] sleepy and all that stuff and Sunday
[9:42] afternoon we all get that way but like
[9:45] brother Louise said he said uh now what
[9:47] about eating I said well you better eat
[9:49] about
[9:51] 915 if y'all don't eat breakfast you
[9:53] better learn to eat breakfast it's the
[9:54] most important meal of the day y'all
[9:56] don't read
[9:57] that because we you may not getting
[10:00] finished till
[10:00] 1:00 on a on a service but listen you
[10:04] sleep with a full
[10:06] stomach you stay awake when your
[10:08] stomach's growling cuz you want to get
[10:10] to that next meal boy aren't we a
[10:12] creature is a
[10:14] habit but we're going to try that we'll
[10:16] have a lot of more options we will have
[10:20] um a schedule set starting in September
[10:23] but remember the first Sunday in
[10:24] September is the first and we will have
[10:27] communion so it will stay the way it is
[10:29] first Sunday the second starting on on
[10:32] 98 there'll be
[10:34] no scheduled structured second service
[10:38] all right and the first service could
[10:41] go as long as we want to
[10:44] worship I I just believe in worship I
[10:47] believe we've got the word but we've got
[10:49] to have some some Dynamics to go on that
[10:51] mechanics mechanics is not only going to
[10:54] get us out of here it's going to take
[10:56] the spirit inside of usly worshiping
[11:01] God to get us to the next level I
[11:04] believe so um I appreciate everybody uh
[11:09] paying attention and listening but I
[11:11] will make this announcement every Sunday
[11:14] um until we come up to that to that time
[11:17] so let's stand to our feet and we're
[11:19] going to we're going to jump into uh
[11:22] we're going to background just a little
[11:24] bit but we're going to start into the
[11:25] age of Pentecost
[11:30] Daniel defo said the soul is placed in
[11:33] the body like a rough
[11:34] diamond and must be polished or the
[11:38] luster of it will never
[11:42] appear the soul is placed in the body
[11:44] like a rough diamond and must be
[11:46] polished or the luster of it will never
[11:50] appear I think that's wonderful let's
[11:52] bow our heads thear heavenly father
[11:53] thank you for this evening Lord the
[11:55] middle of the week where we can serve
[11:57] you Lord I pray that you be with us now
[11:59] in this service Lord open our eyes that
[12:01] we may see and our ears that we may hear
[12:02] you Lord and what you're saying in this
[12:05] age and in the end time lord as Brother
[12:07] Richard Wilson said several times it's a
[12:09] new season it's a new time it's a it's a
[12:12] new era that we're working in now that
[12:14] Lord we're taking this Lord and and we
[12:16] pray that it'll be pleasing in your eyes
[12:19] Lord as we come together we don't want
[12:21] to be just here as as as having a
[12:24] service here and a service there but
[12:26] Lord let our service be a continual
[12:28] service Lord let us commune with you
[12:30] every day father and it makes it much
[12:32] easier when you come into the house of
[12:34] God for you to speak to us Lord now you
[12:36] said where two or three are gathered in
[12:38] your name you'd be in the midst so
[12:39] tonight Lord there's more than that and
[12:41] Lord if there be any needs if there be
[12:43] anything Lord that is troubling someone
[12:45] in their life Lord I pray that you'd
[12:47] speak to them tonight and Lord that
[12:49] you'll be with the ones that are sick
[12:50] sister Johnny and the different ones
[12:52] Lord and be brother Aaron Lord and give
[12:54] him wisdom on that on that um
[12:57] um thing that he's working on and and
[13:01] the hot water heater
[13:02] and Lord we got a we got an air
[13:06] conditioner unit that's on one leg so we
[13:08] pray Lord that you'd help that thing too
[13:10] Lord I pray that you'd touch everything
[13:12] in this building the people especially
[13:15] Lord be with each one father and just
[13:17] bless us now in Jesus name
[13:21] amen son of man this will be we will
[13:24] start we're going to background for a
[13:26] minute
[13:27] but if you'll remember
[13:30] the scripture says Alpha and Omega so
[13:32] the alpha bride and Omega bride has to
[13:35] be the same but they have to have a
[13:38] foundation just the
[13:40] same that's right everybody with me you
[13:43] come from the Old Testament the Old
[13:45] Testament comes in they had a day of
[13:48] Pentecost we'll talk about that here in
[13:50] just a little bit then you had Paul
[13:52] coming at the end of that Pentecostal
[13:55] age to bring his message number one the
[13:57] message one first church age now you
[13:59] we're over here now we've almost
[14:01] finished with six all right and we're
[14:04] getting into the last or the Omega
[14:06] message or the last message of the end
[14:08] time and to get to that last message CU
[14:10] remember look Paul was a prophet right
[14:14] all these others were yeah they were
[14:15] considered prophets but not Major
[14:17] Prophets Paul was a major prophet all
[14:20] right brother Brandon was a major
[14:22] prophet so you had your two book ends
[14:24] but they had to have a foundation of
[14:27] Pentecost now not Pentecostal
[14:30] denomination Pentecost by
[14:32] experience so there had to be then now
[14:34] at the end time between the sixth and
[14:36] seventh Church age there had to be an
[14:38] age of Pentecost right all right we'll
[14:41] get into that now that age of Pentecost
[14:43] is going to be as we were talking about
[14:45] the outer Court inner Court holy of
[14:47] holies we're getting ready to enter into
[14:49] the holy of holies amen all right if
[14:51] you've not entered into the holy of
[14:53] holies if you don't have the new birth
[14:55] just listen for a little while maybe God
[14:57] will strike your heart and give you
[14:59] Clarity on what the new birth is all
[15:01] right cuz it's very important if it
[15:03] started the church
[15:05] ages and it started it right it's got to
[15:09] end to church age right amen CU you got
[15:11] your Alpha and Omega all right so
[15:13] Revelations 1 said I was in the spirit
[15:15] on the Lord's day and I heard behind me
[15:17] a great voice as of a trumpet saying I
[15:19] am Alpha and Omega the first and the
[15:22] last he made sure he was going to start
[15:24] it right he made sure he was going to
[15:26] end it right right cuz it's all anyway
[15:29] it's not us it's him right but it's his
[15:32] plan it's a master plan it's a plan that
[15:34] won't fail listen it's a plan he's
[15:37] already been through
[15:39] right it's ain't new to God tomorrow's
[15:42] new to us brother John but not to God
[15:45] the whole end of this thing is not new
[15:46] to God so he orchestrated the whole
[15:48] thing and he did it as the Bible says
[15:51] for his own
[15:53] will but he had you in mind or he would
[15:56] have never had an alpha bride
[15:59] a church a bride and then an Omega bride
[16:02] to end this thing up he' have never had
[16:04] that he didn't need us but he wanted to
[16:07] he wanted to be father he wanted to be
[16:10] husband amen I am Alpha and Omega the
[16:13] first and the last and what thou see us
[16:14] right in a book and send it to the seven
[16:17] churches which are in Asia there's your
[16:19] seven Church ages Leota being the end
[16:21] now see it doesn't announce anywhere in
[16:24] here that there's a Pentecostal age but
[16:27] if the alpha bride has to be like the
[16:30] Omega bride how it started the way this
[16:32] one's got to start right and even
[16:34] brother random tells us I'll read you
[16:36] the quote right the very end brother R
[16:38] said no Messenger to that age because
[16:41] the Holy Ghost came himself but what
[16:42] happened on the day of Pentecost no
[16:44] Messenger to that age right Peter was
[16:48] the
[16:49] spokesperson not the
[16:51] messenger uh the oneeyed black men daddy
[16:54] Seymour uh param they were Messengers
[16:57] they were SP spokesman but then Here
[17:00] Comes brother brandom stepping right out
[17:02] of that Pentecostal age right into the
[17:06] bride age are the layout of seeing age
[17:08] and then we're called out of it and I
[17:10] turned to see the voice of SP and being
[17:11] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[17:13] and in the midst of those seven candles
[17:15] sticks one likened to the son of man
[17:17] cloth with the Garment down to the foot
[17:18] and G about the PS with the golden
[17:19] girdle you may be seated the Lord has
[17:22] blessings remember the second stage we
[17:24] were looking at the other day you
[17:26] there's where the candlesticks show up
[17:28] it is an AR arcial light now listen
[17:30] there's nothing artificial in God no all
[17:32] right but as a type sanctification you
[17:37] can put those lights
[17:38] out hello it's say you can be Sanctified
[17:42] and go to
[17:44] hell that's right hello sure you can be
[17:47] just Sanctified and die and go to hell
[17:49] it's required that you go into that holy
[17:51] of holies where it was not man's light
[17:54] it was God's light amen God met you in
[17:57] there a priest didn't meet you in there
[17:59] God met you in there right now priest
[18:01] had to go in in the Old Testament but
[18:03] that types me and you going
[18:05] in to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[18:08] amen and we'll read that here in just a
[18:09] little bit so Acts 2 verse1 says when
[18:12] the day of Pentecost now I know
[18:14] everybody that's been here a long time
[18:16] you know what Penta means Pentecost 50
[18:20] on the day of Pentecost it actually
[18:22] happened on the very day that it was
[18:24] supposed to happen on praise God God
[18:27] perfect it was the day of Pentecost the
[18:30] 50th Jubilee or the 50th day after what
[18:34] the killing of the Lamb all right they
[18:36] were all in with one Accord in one place
[18:40] and suddenly there came a sound from
[18:41] Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and
[18:43] it filled all the house where they were
[18:45] sitting there appeared under them clo
[18:47] and tongues like as of
[18:49] fire and it sat upon each one of them
[18:52] and they were all filled with the Holy
[18:54] Ghost 120 people men and women were
[18:57] filled with the Holy Ghost and one time
[19:00] because God promised them he said if
[19:02] you'll go up there you'll be endued with
[19:03] power from on high right amen and they
[19:05] were all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[19:07] began to speak with tongues or other
[19:08] tongues as the spirit gave them
[19:11] utterance so now if you'll see
[19:14] here I don't know if you can see that or
[19:16] not but you got the first part over
[19:18] there says
[19:20] Pentecost that's where we're at right
[19:22] now right in the book of Acts all right
[19:26] then remember we come back over here now
[19:28] we see the open door the overlap we see
[19:31] that there's another Pentecostal age
[19:33] right here to usher in the age of Le if
[19:37] Alpha has got to be the same as Omega
[19:39] it's got to be pictures it's got to be
[19:41] mirror images of what happened in one's
[19:43] going to happen in the other that's why
[19:45] the full word of God was in those first
[19:48] three ages the the am I just not on here
[19:51] at all
[19:59] how about
[20:00] now it helped to turn the thing
[20:03] on praise the Lord I'll be 65 in a few
[20:08] months I
[20:10] think is that
[20:13] better Richard I had it it was off I
[20:15] thought it had it on but it's
[20:16] off
[20:19] huh thank
[20:21] you so can I go back over here now okay
[20:24] all
[20:26] right so you you got book
[20:29] ends Pentecostal age is just the one we
[20:32] just talked about there's another one
[20:34] coming right here that's going to what
[20:37] restore back the gifts but remember it's
[20:39] not going to restore back the word
[20:43] yet that's what the prophet was sent to
[20:46] do all right now look they had the word
[20:49] listen this acts two this acts that we
[20:52] just read which is Acts 2 ver1 that fell
[20:57] on sons of God that had been tutored by
[20:59] the Lord Jesus himself not a second
[21:02] person not a third person God tutored
[21:04] them for three and A2 years right and he
[21:07] packed in them all he could pack in them
[21:10] but they had no power they lied they cut
[21:13] people's ear off they ran they
[21:16] cursed that sound like a good Holy Ghost
[21:18] group of people right didn't think
[21:21] so but when they but Jesus told him and
[21:23] I'll read it in a minute he said go to
[21:26] Jerusalem and you'll be in Ed with power
[21:30] from on high so what happened was they
[21:33] had that word in their heart and the
[21:35] Holy Ghost fell on that part of the word
[21:37] that there to fulfill which was the full
[21:39] word it was the word himself the only
[21:42] problem was there was no headstone there
[21:44] Christ wasn't there anymore in physical
[21:47] form everybody with me the son of man
[21:49] had left this is not the son of man
[21:52] coming in Acts two it's the Son of God
[21:55] it's the Holy Ghost all right a
[22:00] ghost we know he's the person of Jesus
[22:02] Christ but it wasn't the man standing
[22:04] there so they got that Son of God
[22:07] Revelation carried it all the way
[22:09] through and then man as we've been
[22:11] through it before listen man has tore
[22:14] this relig this Bible to pieces with
[22:16] religion they tore the word of God to
[22:20] Pieces brother Brown said what bound at
[22:24] the river Euphrates by what
[22:25] denominational Creeds right that's
[22:28] that's why God can't work in his church
[22:30] when you and I have Creeds and you and I
[22:32] have thoughts that are not according to
[22:34] God we have bound the Holy Ghost yes you
[22:38] can yes I can yes we do yes we do okay
[22:41] so that don't exclude anybody let's just
[22:44] include everybody
[22:47] am Hey listen brother randam the Holy
[22:49] Ghost told him said don't you pray for
[22:51] that baby you going to make that right
[22:52] you
[22:53] lied old people hate for you to say
[22:55] something about a prophet but he was a
[22:58] human
[22:59] he went through things he listen all
[23:01] these people in the Old and New
[23:03] Testament went through things look at
[23:04] Paul Paul actually was having those
[23:07] Christians put into the prison and they
[23:09] were being killed Paul well
[23:12] Saul
[23:13] right so God used his flaws praise God
[23:17] brother BR said that's what made the
[23:18] Masterpiece perfect is the flaw
[23:22] right that's what Satan is not he's he's
[23:25] looking at us and he's going man I that
[23:27] I'm just making them I'm getting in
[23:29] their mind and I'm making them think
[23:31] these thoughts and some people are
[23:34] making them manifest I'm not talking
[23:36] about us I'm talking about ones in the
[23:38] world because listen these doctrines
[23:40] that come up that are false didn't come
[23:43] from God it can't come from God it had
[23:48] to come from a false teaching as brother
[23:50] R said misinterpreted theology from the
[23:53] pull pit sir that's why we have to be so
[23:57] careful here because that Spirit was not
[24:01] so much there in the first age there
[24:02] wasn't a denominational Spirit yeah
[24:05] there was a a saying there were some
[24:07] people that were saying things but now
[24:10] it wasn't a church on every corner that
[24:12] said Baptist I was reading the other day
[24:14] in the
[24:15] history I think brother ol gave me to it
[24:17] the history of the church first few
[24:19] hundred years of the
[24:20] church all churches until
[24:24] Constantine came in were churches
[24:29] that were of the that were of the day of
[24:31] Pentecost they believed in one God they
[24:34] believe water baptism name the Lord
[24:35] Jesus Christ they did the things they
[24:37] were supposed to do that was the
[24:39] churches that dominated that age but
[24:42] when Constantine come in and put Church
[24:44] in state together he started erecting
[24:46] bigger
[24:49] churches big old churches on each Corner
[24:52] big big old ideas that feels a lot
[24:54] better well we you know well yeah you
[24:56] ain't got to do this anymore this is a
[24:58] new way of doing
[24:59] it all right so the day of Pentecost on
[25:03] that group of people put them right
[25:06] there where it says brotherly kindness
[25:08] they had those virtues put inside of
[25:10] them by the Lord Jesus himself the three
[25:13] and a half years he preached to them and
[25:15] then what did they do they turned around
[25:17] and manifested it because what did Peter
[25:19] do Peter said add to your faith Right
[25:23] add to your faith virtue knowledge
[25:24] Temperance all the
[25:26] way but that wasn't never taught
[25:30] if you'll listen to brother Keith I
[25:31] don't know if he covered it all Sunday
[25:34] but no he didn't cuz we were sitting
[25:35] around a table me and him he said
[25:37] brother way you wouldn't believe the
[25:39] people that he is in contact with in
[25:43] these foreign countries where we've been
[25:44] for years ministering to them they don't
[25:47] even know what statute of perfect man is
[25:49] they think they got it all when they
[25:50] believed and they don't need
[25:52] that you know what they prove it that's
[25:55] right you will prove what you got or
[25:58] don't
[25:59] got but thank God that we've got
[26:01] somebody like brother Keith and
[26:03] different ones that can go over there
[26:04] and can sit down and have a minister
[26:06] meeting and and lay it all out and show
[26:08] them how the the seals is not just the
[26:10] white horse riders the
[26:12] Antichrist those seals are Jesus Christ
[26:15] and when that opens you see him and when
[26:18] that opens and you see him that's when
[26:20] the devil goes away from you right he
[26:23] can't stand
[26:25] truth he can't stand it he hates it just
[26:28] like God hates eror he hates truth God
[26:31] hates yeah I read you many times where
[26:33] God hates God hates that nickan Spirit
[26:36] he hates for a congregation to be
[26:39] conquered by a
[26:40] person God forbid that we ever do
[26:43] that have freedom to
[26:45] worship under the message of the hour
[26:49] all right everybody with me so that day
[26:52] of Pentecost was somewhat different from
[26:54] this one because this day of Pentecost
[26:56] fell on heart word because it wasn't
[27:00] time for it those people on the day of
[27:03] Pentecost isusa Street 1906 were
[27:06] trinitarians so you know God wasn't in
[27:08] that trinitarian
[27:09] Doctrine God wasn't in that water
[27:12] baptism in the name of Father Son and
[27:13] Holy Ghost all right but he was in the
[27:16] time that was allotted was the gifts the
[27:20] healing the speaking in tongues the
[27:22] shouting the screaming the
[27:25] prophesying but praise God that's what
[27:27] brother r came through and he stepped
[27:29] out of that with a healing campaign
[27:32] speaking in
[27:34] tongues but remember what he said he
[27:36] said you stayed right here he said God
[27:38] moved on right all
[27:40] right you ever stop you're behind cuz
[27:45] God never
[27:46] stops so everybody with me so far so
[27:48] that day of Pentecost now was a little
[27:50] different because it fell on sons of God
[27:53] that were tutored by Jesus himself this
[27:56] Holy Ghost fell on sons of God that had
[27:58] been tutored sometimes by false
[28:00] teaching hello that's just the way it is
[28:04] Luther had false teach if that's the
[28:06] word wetley had the same thing and so
[28:08] did param and and daddy Seymour but they
[28:12] had what they needed for the time the
[28:15] gifts had to come back into the church
[28:17] this this is part of the growing of the
[28:20] of the Corn and the shoot and the stalk
[28:23] and the
[28:25] tassel and remember now Pentecost was
[28:28] was the shook it looked like the grain
[28:31] but it was protecting it that's what it
[28:33] was doing it was protecting it from the
[28:35] devil hello somebody it was protecting
[28:38] it from the devil so that the grain
[28:40] which is me and
[28:42] you can come out
[28:46] again and then we're supposed to what
[28:48] lay in the presence of the Sun get rid
[28:50] of the
[28:51] shook hello get rid of the Shu get rid
[28:55] of that Pentecostal idea that they had
[28:59] that you got to speak in tongues and you
[29:00] got to
[29:01] shout and you're now full seed again and
[29:04] brother R says laying in the presence of
[29:06] the son s o n to ripen that's why the
[29:10] son of man was put in the grave here all
[29:14] right that's God in human flesh when I
[29:16] say son of man that's God walking around
[29:18] in human flesh all
[29:20] right that about with me word made flesh
[29:23] right well that's what's got to happen
[29:25] over here cuz that seed over here went
[29:27] in the ground it was Jesus Christ
[29:29] himself but he promised he promised he'd
[29:33] come back brother John he promised
[29:35] according to all Luke 17:30 and all the
[29:37] different ones that the son of man will
[29:38] be revealed again in human flesh but now
[29:42] a many membered body not just one right
[29:46] all members in particular all of us are
[29:49] part of that son of man Ministry now
[29:51] that's right amen all
[29:55] right I hope you see that it's not a
[29:58] different God it's a different
[30:01] dispensation it's a different attribute
[30:04] it's a different inm
[30:07] morphe he decided to in morphe in a
[30:10] bride and hide himself remember he said
[30:12] the world will see me no more but you
[30:15] who is you you is his bride not every
[30:19] Church on the corner his bride you his
[30:21] bride will be the son of man in the end
[30:24] time I'm coming with you and in you amen
[30:29] till the end of the world we ain't got
[30:30] to it yet but we're about that far from
[30:32] it all
[30:34] right everybody okay sir and it worked
[30:37] out with all the dominating female
[30:39] churches and that's what it is it's a
[30:41] domination I was looking the other
[30:44] day and I
[30:47] guess preaching on sin is
[30:51] costly must
[30:52] be cuz remember Joel ol said he didn't
[30:55] preach on sin that's right he makes 50
[30:57] $4 million a year that's his salary that
[31:00] he set
[31:01] himself his salary $54 million a year
[31:04] lives in a 17,000 foot
[31:08] mansion and he's not the richest one
[31:10] Kenne Copeland is the richest
[31:13] one how they don't preach on sin I'll
[31:18] guarantee you if Joel Olstein tomorrow
[31:20] or Sunday got in the pull pit and said
[31:21] now I've heard from this man William
[31:24] brandham and you'd see that place
[31:25] scattered he wouldn't make 54 million he
[31:27] wouldn't make
[31:29] $54 his next check it ain't about money
[31:32] but you you see what that is he said I
[31:35] don't preach on sin what does he do he
[31:37] preaches on Sunshine and Roses this is
[31:40] not all sunshine and Roses I'll promise
[31:42] you
[31:44] that but the end result is what we're
[31:47] looking at and you got to be able to see
[31:51] it before you see
[31:53] it you got to believe to see remember
[31:56] instead of seeing to believe well if I
[31:58] could get just see a piece of that
[31:59] promised land no we've been told about
[32:02] it it's been sung about brother brandom
[32:06] went into it and come back and told us
[32:07] about it we've had others have
[32:10] experiences that maybe went in and told
[32:11] us come back and told about it we don't
[32:14] have to guess
[32:16] anymore like Brother Richard said about
[32:18] Dad he said he knew where to go when he
[32:20] broke from this Veil into the next one
[32:23] he wasn't lost that's why you call it
[32:26] lost right if you're lost L tonight and
[32:28] you die you don't know where you're
[32:30] going that's
[32:31] right you're a wering
[32:35] soul sorry but it's
[32:38] true we have an assurity that we know
[32:41] where to go that we're going when we
[32:42] have the new
[32:44] birth and have never been there before
[32:46] in our life but praise God he's let us
[32:49] see a little bit of it in our life
[32:51] through healings through our loved ones
[32:53] getting healed our loved ones getting
[32:54] saved our loved ones starting to come to
[32:56] church and different things I'm still
[32:58] praying for that all of us amen you got
[33:05] to well when they come in and they start
[33:07] sitting down I'll start believing well
[33:09] you're lost that's right cuz you don't
[33:12] know how to pray exactly but you pray as
[33:16] if they're sitting there that's right
[33:19] remember Abraham acted 25 years like he
[33:23] already had the baby remember brother
[33:24] rown said honey go get go buy the
[33:26] diapers go get the go get the uh the
[33:30] bird eyes and booty they don't know what
[33:32] that is but you know the little uh pins
[33:35] and the cloth diapers y'all don't know
[33:36] what that is some of y'all ain't never
[33:38] had any on but let's don't go there the
[33:42] opening of the first three
[33:43] seals oh hush well yours was paper I'm
[33:46] sure 70 years old opening of the first
[33:49] Hill it Loos a Ministry so that's what
[33:52] happened on the day of Pentecost what
[33:54] did Peter do on the day of Pentecost
[33:55] scared to death right but when he got
[33:58] the Holy Ghost something sparked inside
[34:01] of him and he stood he didn't he throw
[34:03] the doors open they weren't running out
[34:05] in the street like as drunk people they
[34:08] was they was drunk on the Holy Ghost
[34:11] maybe we ought to do that sometime if
[34:13] the Holy Ghost falls and gets inside of
[34:15] us it ought to anyway
[34:17] amen so it Loos the ministry and what
[34:20] first thing Peter said he started
[34:22] preaching he started preaching and then
[34:25] they said oh men and brotherr what wants
[34:26] me do he said repent and be baptized in
[34:29] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[34:30] remission of your sins what loose the
[34:33] ministry to start and and it
[34:36] died come on it died in the church ages
[34:40] just like we were talking about it died
[34:42] in the Dark Ages you can't kill God but
[34:44] it had to go on the ground and die right
[34:48] to come back up to today you and I can
[34:53] we can look at the Shu we can look at
[34:55] the different things but we're grain
[34:58] amen we got to act different look
[35:00] different be
[35:02] different cuz
[35:04] remember the shuck does not go into the
[35:08] Garner the stock does not go into the
[35:13] Garner only the seed only the wheat seed
[35:19] the plant doesn't go in the wheat goes
[35:21] in the wheat's the most important thing
[35:24] now we are wheat plants amen that's
[35:28] right and praise God it loosed a
[35:30] Ministry and we're listening to it now
[35:33] we're listening where it was all shut up
[35:34] and then brother V comes and he says oh
[35:36] we got to get these seals open and then
[35:38] he preaches marriage and divorce he says
[35:40] oh thank God for the opening of these
[35:42] seals then he preaches serpent seed
[35:44] thank God for the opening of seals he
[35:46] was thanking God for what one thing
[35:48] opening the book up to where everybody
[35:50] could see what was going on he had to be
[35:52] able to partake of it first though but
[35:54] he could give it out to me and you and
[35:56] then here we are 60 something years
[35:57] later and that's what we're trying to do
[35:59] we're trying to get this message out the
[36:01] pure message out to the Believers so
[36:03] that you can believe amen
[36:08] right
[36:10] try try to
[36:12] believe try to believe that you're the
[36:14] bride even though you may be heading
[36:16] toward it you may be
[36:20] Sanctified but I'm
[36:22] bride I'm bride I'm bride read about it
[36:27] in the
[36:29] book He's our
[36:35] Lover he created all this just for
[36:40] us just for us he created everybody this
[36:43] just for us this whole world that I was
[36:46] looking yesterday and you look out over
[36:48] the horizon and and this Earth is so
[36:52] awesome now let's get started on this
[36:55] Earth but that ball we're on is so
[36:57] awesome brother John it takes 24 hours
[37:00] for it to turn around according to Time
[37:03] 24 hours to turn around and you know
[37:05] what it goes an hour and the sun's about
[37:08] right here and you go about another hour
[37:09] and the sun's about right here but that
[37:11] thing they say spending just like this
[37:14] to keep us on the earth and it's stuck
[37:17] stuck out in the middle of space there's
[37:18] nobody holding it
[37:20] up the word of God supp holding it
[37:23] up so if we can serve a God that can do
[37:26] that we can serve a God that can do a
[37:28] lot more for
[37:30] us so the first three ages a pure word
[37:33] of God the fourth age went in the ground
[37:35] just background already spoke on this so
[37:38] the son of man should be glorified now
[37:39] how is the son of man
[37:41] glorified in his people that's right
[37:45] father glorify
[37:48] us with the same Glory that we were
[37:50] glorified together before the foundation
[37:52] of the
[37:53] world except the corn of wheat fall on
[37:55] the ground and die to bide us alone but
[37:56] if it die bring forth
[37:58] much fruit till the fifth age we've been
[38:02] talking about it that's the age of
[38:05] justification justification I want to
[38:07] show you something here in just a
[38:09] minute it eradicates by faith in what
[38:11] Christ did at the cross the sins of your
[38:13] past nature all right is everybody with
[38:15] me on that you still are lost but your
[38:20] sins are gone your past sins that even
[38:25] right now Satan is like throwing them up
[38:27] like this he's a
[38:30] liar if you're if you're
[38:33] truly
[38:34] repentant God don't even see them have
[38:38] we got do we got yeah we got to believe
[38:40] that we got to believe past what our own
[38:43] mortal mind
[38:44] thinks cuz we can still remember but God
[38:49] can't I'll show you something just a
[38:51] minute and typ will prove
[38:55] that so being justified freely by by his
[38:57] grace through the Redemption in Christ
[38:59] Jesus to declare his righteousness for
[39:01] remissions of sins that are ped through
[39:05] the forbearance of God not through
[39:06] forbearance of us therefore we conclude
[39:09] that a man is justified by faith without
[39:11] the Deeds of the law there was no law in
[39:14] the Old Testament that could justify
[39:18] you cuz it was still
[39:20] there your sins were only pushed toward
[39:23] Calvary if you were in the Old Testament
[39:24] they were pushed to Calvary and of
[39:26] course Calvary took care of of it but
[39:28] you were just
[39:30] covered it wasn't eradicated today when
[39:32] you get on your knees and say God
[39:35] forgive me of what I done he's just and
[39:39] the justifier he's the only one that can
[39:42] do it you can't do it yourself he's the
[39:46] only one trust in him when he said it's
[39:49] finished that finish your
[39:52] sin thank you
[39:55] Jesus there's only one sin you can be
[39:57] forgiven of and that's blasphemy and if
[39:59] you're still striving for God you
[40:01] haven't blasphemed if you blasphemed God
[40:04] it's like that girl said I can watch my
[40:06] mama's soul fry in hell and laugh at it
[40:10] that was crossing the line right that
[40:14] woman could never get back cuz remember
[40:16] she told Brother Brown that she wouldn't
[40:18] have her she wouldn't give her that
[40:19] religion to her dog or a cow or
[40:20] something
[40:22] right but you got a chance if you're
[40:25] still
[40:25] alive if you're still still striving for
[40:28] God still strive for God still say God
[40:32] forgive me we have to every day if you
[40:35] don't ask God to forgive you every day
[40:37] your sins is piling
[40:41] up and they
[40:43] stink they're really piling
[40:46] up I ask God to forgive me all the time
[40:49] I'm
[40:50] sorry I pray for me and
[40:54] sister pray for me she's like me too me
[40:58] too sister Alicia I do the same thing
[41:02] done dear I do the same thing I do it
[41:04] coming in that door and I do it coming
[41:06] in that coming out that
[41:08] door listen if you put it under the
[41:11] blood God don't see
[41:14] it you know what the prophet said even
[41:17] in discernment he couldn't discern it
[41:19] why cuz it's
[41:20] gone so you know what it's not in it's
[41:23] not in the mind of God anymore oh boy I
[41:26] just got that
[41:28] that's why he can't see it cuz listen it
[41:30] was the mind of God he was working
[41:32] through how can somebody know the doctor
[41:34] you saw had glasses in a blue coat on
[41:36] four days ago and that you were going to
[41:38] have a redheaded baby two years from now
[41:40] that wasn't a devil that was God and if
[41:43] God couldn't see it the the prophet
[41:46] couldn't see it just start believing
[41:49] that it's
[41:51] gone but the outer court is that
[41:55] justification but the outer Court
[41:58] look it's big it's a big place it's all
[42:00] in that outside but you did have to go
[42:03] to the laby you did have to kill the
[42:05] lamb everything was done out here God
[42:08] forgive me of my sins so I can go into
[42:11] the holy place not the holy of holies
[42:14] yet but the holy place I'll get back to
[42:16] a scene here in a
[42:19] minute but I just love the
[42:22] way that the church ages turns into
[42:24] Redemption cuz it's all Redemption every
[42:27] everything we preach of is in Redemption
[42:29] and actually everything we preach in is
[42:31] in
[42:33] threes three stages three PS three
[42:37] stages justification sanctification
[42:40] baptism Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost
[42:42] right God's perfected in threes so guess
[42:44] what if God perfected in in threes so
[42:46] are you that's right all right everybody
[42:49] with me so now here's the picture of the
[42:51] outer Court this is the world nobody the
[42:54] these people out here do not care what's
[42:56] going on in here right unless they're
[42:59] coming in here to give a sacrifice they
[43:02] don't even care that's the
[43:03] world that's the 8 billion people that
[43:06] live out in the world but when you come
[43:08] through here and say God forgive me
[43:10] forgive me of
[43:12] this he's just to forgive you right
[43:16] there then he's got to clean you up keep
[43:18] cleaning you up to get you here remember
[43:20] justification is one act sanctification
[43:23] is the
[43:24] process right
[43:27] so the Philadelphian age was age of
[43:30] sanctification love of the Brethren it
[43:32] was also an age of what it had a little
[43:34] strength but it was also an unfulfilled
[43:36] age and he opened the door what he
[43:39] opened to the door to the great
[43:40] missionary age we'll skip through that
[43:42] we already been through it they opened
[43:43] up many doors the door of the Gospel the
[43:45] door of the mission field the door back
[43:47] to
[43:48] Christ and everything was opened up
[43:51] during that age but now remember there
[43:54] was a lap over of each age there was a
[43:56] lap over so the lap over of John Wesley
[43:59] went over into Pentecost that's why that
[44:01] param and them could look back and still
[44:04] believe in a father son Holy Ghost
[44:06] baptism and all the different fallacies
[44:08] that were there from from the reformers
[44:11] not a prophet that's why if they had had
[44:13] I don't say this lightly if they had any
[44:15] sense turn and look at the prophet look
[44:18] what God sent him he sent brother random
[44:20] just like just like brother Keith said
[44:22] God sent brother random in your
[44:25] language in your
[44:31] country there some of them people over
[44:33] there that it's a lot of what brother
[44:35] rown said is lost in
[44:39] interpretation but you got it right
[44:41] there where you need it that's why
[44:43] America is going to be burnt the first
[44:46] cuz we turned down a prophet the
[44:48] Pentecostals was looking right straight
[44:50] at their way out and they turned around
[44:52] in went in another direction right sorry
[44:55] but they did
[45:01] so sanctification is a cleaning up
[45:03] process and a set aside for use or
[45:05] purpose remember the glass process but
[45:08] as a process sanctification means
[45:09] becoming more holy Through Time John
[45:12] Wesley didn't just come on the scene and
[45:14] say clean up right now I'll be back next
[45:17] week no he preached 4,800
[45:22] sermons that's right forever how many
[45:24] years he was alive just to get the
[45:27] people to see to be
[45:30] Sanctified so it's the process it's
[45:33] still he's still working on me Paul said
[45:35] I Die
[45:36] daily but Jesus said sanctify them
[45:38] through thy truth Thy word is truth the
[45:40] only way you can be Sanctified brother
[45:42] Ram tells us I didn't bring this quote
[45:44] but he tells us he says sanctification
[45:46] puts you in a religious order
[45:48] sanctification tells you you need to
[45:50] come to
[45:51] church sanctification needs you tell you
[45:54] to quit reading this and start reading
[45:55] this quit listen to this and start
[45:58] listening to that what that's shedding
[46:00] off the old
[46:01] you now even though you're born again
[46:04] let's go to the Statue of perfect man
[46:05] you're still shedding off the old you
[46:08] you got that Spirit realm that those
[46:10] demons are still scratching at the
[46:13] door everybody with me you're begotten
[46:17] of the spirit at sanctification look but
[46:19] you're never born of the spirit so when
[46:22] you enter into that second Veil you got
[46:24] an artificial light which is the
[46:26] candlesticks they have to keep lit so
[46:28] you have to listen to a Minister preach
[46:30] to
[46:31] you they make the shoe
[46:34] bread and they put the spices in the
[46:36] bowl they who the
[46:38] preachers but now remember when you go
[46:40] back in that holy of
[46:42] holies there's no moving
[46:45] Parts it's the ark with all that in it
[46:48] and you and God that's it amen so you're
[46:51] begotten of the spirit of sanctification
[46:52] but never born of the spirit until the
[46:54] Holy Ghost comes in now look a b got
[46:57] life in the
[46:58] womb little muscles are quivering it's a
[47:00] life but listen to what listen to the
[47:02] master
[47:04] physician but it's a different life when
[47:06] it breathes the Breath of Life in its
[47:08] nostrils it's different it becomes a
[47:11] living Soul it becomes a
[47:15] person my dear Methodist Brethren
[47:18] Pilgrim Holiness what what's he telling
[47:20] these
[47:21] people you're
[47:23] Sanctified you're living a good clean
[47:25] life listen they're the ones that wear
[47:27] the always wear the short I mean the
[47:29] long sleeves and no jewelry and and try
[47:32] to live the best they can under that
[47:34] under that age but God called us out of
[47:36] that age not to not to reverse and start
[47:39] doing the other but that plus that
[47:45] plus sanctification is the cleansing
[47:47] which is the preparation of
[47:50] life but when the Holy Ghost comes it is
[47:53] life preparation is cleaning the vessel
[47:57] today tomorrow yesterday two weeks ago
[48:01] two Sundays ago 14 Sundays ago God's
[48:04] trying to clean us up are we listening
[48:07] or we just sitting there looking like we
[48:09] don't know what we're
[48:11] doing we got to
[48:15] move but when the Holy Ghost comes his
[48:17] life preparation is cleaning the vessel
[48:19] the Holy Ghost is filling the vessel
[48:21] sanctification means clean and set aside
[48:23] for service the holy spirit is put in
[48:25] service you are the vessel that God's
[48:28] cleaned up you believe that amen now
[48:33] we'll notice when the unclean spirit is
[48:34] gone from a man's The Book of Luke he
[48:36] walks in dry places that's exactly what
[48:38] the church has done Baptist Methodist
[48:42] those who believed in sanctification
[48:44] then Jesus said the unclean spirit that
[48:46] went out returns back to his church
[48:52] body and finds the house garnished swept
[48:54] clean living Pure Clean lives
[48:58] all right but then if that house isn't
[49:00] filled or occupied then he comes in with
[49:04] seven other evil demons worse than he
[49:06] was and the last stage of this place is
[49:09] seven times worse than it was at the
[49:10] first place they had been better to stay
[49:13] Lutheran and it would to be received
[49:15] that light and failed to follow
[49:18] it so will the Pentecostal see you know
[49:20] what I mean the house is garnished what
[49:22] happened then when the enemy that went
[49:24] out under sanctification he they were
[49:27] washed out they returned back and found
[49:30] the house not filled with the Holy
[49:32] Spirit now the state of the church is
[49:34] joined with the league of churches the
[49:36] World Council of churches listen they
[49:38] all think they're
[49:39] right surprised no you shouldn't be they
[49:42] all think they're right why do they go
[49:43] to Baptist Church they think they're
[49:45] right why do you go to message church
[49:47] because we believe it's right but
[49:49] everybody's but everybody can't be
[49:51] right there's got to be a truth the
[49:53] truth not a
[49:55] Truth Listen
[49:57] Baptists have a
[49:59] truth methodists have a truth there's
[50:02] some of them that Liv way better lives
[50:03] than we do say to say but they don't
[50:07] have the Holy Ghost right to keep them
[50:11] cuz when something happens something
[50:12] blows up they go right back out in the
[50:15] world you see that happening in the
[50:17] church now in the message church now if
[50:19] you don't have the Holy Ghost you will
[50:21] leave
[50:23] here you can't stay here that's right
[50:26] you can't stay here under the power of
[50:28] the Holy Ghost and be Sanctified and
[50:31] just continue that for 20 years and not
[50:34] get filled with the Holy Ghost that's
[50:35] the foolish virgin y'all not know that a
[50:38] foolish virgin didn't get the Holy Ghost
[50:40] they got Justified and they got
[50:42] Sanctified but they got right here right
[50:44] to the
[50:45] curtain and something turned them back
[50:48] they turned their yourself back God
[50:52] didn't now remember we were talking
[50:54] about Christianity is not based on what
[50:56] people do do to you it's not based on
[50:58] conditions now this is sanctification
[50:59] that we need to start
[51:01] living well they it ain't concerned
[51:07] they now if Jesus was hanging on the
[51:10] cross what would he say brother John now
[51:13] they he said father forgive them for
[51:16] they know not what they're doing be
[51:19] honest be kind love your enemies bless
[51:21] them that curse you can we do
[51:24] that somebody flips you off going to
[51:26] down the road you say well Lord please
[51:28] just bless them they probably having a
[51:30] bad day no you get all riled up anyway
[51:33] we need
[51:34] work I am preaching preaching the front
[51:36] row BL nobody on the front row love your
[51:41] love your enemies bless them that curse
[51:43] you do good to them that hate
[51:48] you well they here we go again will they
[51:52] no it ain't
[51:55] they pray pray for them which
[51:57] despitefully use you and persecute you
[52:01] that you may be the children of your
[52:02] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[52:05] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[52:08] good and sendeth rain on the just and
[52:11] the unjust for if you love them that
[52:12] love you what reward have you now this
[52:15] is Jesus
[52:16] talking do not even the publicans do the
[52:19] same thing in other words people in the
[52:20] world there are people in the world that
[52:22] just are loving and they're good and
[52:23] they're kind but they're very few
[52:27] and if you salute your brethren
[52:29] only oh I like him because I like him
[52:32] and I that no under just I don't like
[52:34] him cuz they here we go again well
[52:38] they well they don't see it my
[52:40] way Jesus didn't say that Jesus said
[52:43] love them
[52:44] all be therefore perfect even as your
[52:46] father in Heaven which is imperfect now
[52:48] remember that word love is not filal
[52:50] love that is a gape God
[52:54] love because you can't fio love
[52:57] everybody in this
[52:59] world can't do it you humanly cannot do
[53:02] it somebody goingon to make you
[53:04] mad yep I just did
[53:09] so as I was speaking last night he's
[53:12] coming into the inner Court the veil is
[53:13] dropped he's heading heading into
[53:15] sanctification now the veil is dropped
[53:17] he lives daily for God meet him anywhere
[53:20] anytime he still got that testimony on
[53:23] his heart in any trial he still holds
[53:26] good it works friends I know by
[53:30] experience do you know by
[53:35] experience they both had the same Pastor
[53:37] they both read the same Bible now this's
[53:39] is talking about the people in the
[53:40] wilderness want you to listen to
[53:41] something right here real quick if you
[53:44] want to type this we're into
[53:46] sanctification but listen the children
[53:49] of Israel were what they were the people
[53:52] of
[53:53] God everybody with me that that was
[53:55] God's bride first that's righten loved
[54:00] them fell in love with
[54:03] them you can see right there
[54:06] Grace cuz they didn't like
[54:08] him complained all the
[54:11] time but remember what happened in their
[54:14] Journey they left Egypt the
[54:18] world Egypt's type of the world right so
[54:21] they left Egypt and the first thing they
[54:24] did they come up to the water
[54:27] and all the great one of the greatest
[54:30] quotes ever in the Bible besides it is
[54:33] finished and father forgive them is this
[54:35] quote right here in Exodus
[54:40] 14:13 Moses looks at his
[54:43] people they're scared to death here
[54:45] comes a Here Comes Pharaoh coming down
[54:48] the same same line I mean God kept the
[54:53] water back right till all the Army got
[54:56] in there but Moses turned around and he
[54:58] said
[55:01] look oh if we could just say this and
[55:03] get a
[55:04] revelation the enemy you see
[55:08] today you will see no more forever amen
[55:13] the enemy you see today you will never
[55:17] ever see that again that's why I said
[55:20] about
[55:21] justification that sin will never be
[55:23] brought up against you only God can do
[55:26] that he killed every Egyptian that was
[55:29] in that
[55:31] water and Israel's over there and
[55:33] marryam is having a Pentecostal Revival
[55:35] she's scouting and speaking in tongues
[55:37] and Moses sings about a two verse I mean
[55:40] a two chapter song read your Bible
[55:43] wouldn't that make you
[55:44] happy that for
[55:47] 400 years not 40 for 400 years those
[55:51] people coming down that
[55:54] aisle are coming down that place where
[55:56] God had pushed it they had beat them
[55:59] people for 400 years right and now God
[56:03] said that's enough I'm going to destroy
[56:06] is I'm going to destroy Egypt and then
[56:08] y'all going to go to the promised land
[56:10] what is our Promised Land the baptism of
[56:12] the Holy Ghost
[56:14] right so every Egyptian that beat them
[56:17] all the task Masters Masters all the
[56:20] ones that had that
[56:22] had I mean they beat them they whipped
[56:26] them
[56:26] made them work made them work double
[56:29] when they got mad everybody with me but
[56:32] Moses turned and he said that
[56:36] enemy that's been bothering you for 400
[56:40] years now listen that didn't stop their
[56:43] enemy on this side right come on you had
[56:47] daythan cor you still had them standing
[56:50] in that congregation but that enemy that
[56:53] had been bothering you all your life
[56:56] it's gone and the Bible says you will
[56:58] not see them
[57:01] forever amen oh praise the Lord boy get
[57:05] a revelation from that and you might
[57:06] start shouting a little
[57:07] bit but what happened during the what
[57:10] happened now that was a event one day
[57:13] well actually happened two days one
[57:15] night the wind
[57:16] blew listen if you ever put your feet in
[57:19] a muddy in a in in a body of water I
[57:24] know y'all doing when y'all people like
[57:25] to go to the beach
[57:29] even the muddy late ler all that's mud
[57:32] right they mud this deep yeah that Red
[57:35] Sea was all underneath that was just
[57:37] this much mud never seen daylight
[57:41] ever and God in one night blew an East
[57:44] Wind in and made it where two million
[57:47] people plus Chariot plus their carts
[57:50] could go across that dry bed amen and
[57:54] never sink down one bit amen amen what a
[57:57] mighty God we serve and then he allowed
[58:00] your enemy to follow you through the
[58:03] same
[58:04] place thinking that they're going to
[58:07] kill you at the end of it and then all
[58:10] of a sudden Moses just holds his hand up
[58:13] with the rod he says that enemy you're
[58:16] not going to ever see him again and and
[58:18] then all of them were killed praise God
[58:22] all them demons that's been bothering us
[58:24] let's get rid of them
[58:26] let's not see them anymore oh they're
[58:27] going to try to see you oh yeah but
[58:30] remember that was an event that was
[58:31] justification but what happened is they
[58:33] were so full of their self they were so
[58:37] uh they were
[58:38] Jews you know two days later into the
[58:41] journey they're wanting to go
[58:43] back after they seen a nation destroyed
[58:46] after they seen their enemy destroyed a
[58:48] just like
[58:49] us two days later Well we'd rather go
[58:52] back up if we're going to die we'd
[58:54] rather die in Egypt than to Dr out here
[58:56] die here cuz they was doing without a
[58:58] little bit of water and then God gave
[59:00] them water then God gave them Mana what
[59:03] sanctification what happened during the
[59:05] 40-year
[59:06] journey the old demons died everybody
[59:10] with me right the old demons died the
[59:13] old Fighters all those old people died
[59:15] in the wilderness right remember brother
[59:18] brandham said Jesus said and they're
[59:20] everyone dead and that's interpreted
[59:22] eternally
[59:23] dead they didn't get to the promised
[59:25] land but they there was a new group come
[59:27] up that 40-year group of people got up

[59:33] brink and
[59:35] Joshua type of the Holy Ghost what did
[59:37] he do he took them
[59:39] over he took them over Moses didn't take
[59:43] him over right Moses stayed in
[59:48] sanctification come on somebody Joshua
[59:51] was the type of the Holy Ghost Moses
[59:52] wasn't Moses was the type of the
[59:53] believer that brought you up to it but
[59:56] there had to be somebody take you into
[59:57] the promised land there has to be
[1:00:00] somebody in this end time preach the new
[1:00:02] birth right preach that you must be
[1:00:04] justified you must be Sanctified you

[1:00:51] didn't curse Moses but she said you're
[1:00:54] not who you think you are what' God do
[1:00:56] he struck her with Leprosy and she died
[1:00:59] in the wilderness Aaron died in the
[1:01:01] wilderness
[1:01:06] that's I've seen both men and women do
[1:01:08] that seen men and women dance in the
[1:01:09] spirit speak with tongu shout had a
[1:01:11] temper like I don't know what there's
[1:01:13] something
[1:01:15] wrong there's something
[1:01:18] wrong if you can't hold the blessings of
[1:01:22] God doesn't matter what happens doesn't
[1:01:24] matter what goes on if you you can lift
[1:01:26] your hands and say God you're in control
[1:01:29] yes amen God is in control we we want to
[1:01:33] control things ourself hello somebody
[1:01:36] Moses got they Aaron got in trouble
[1:01:39] trying to control things
[1:01:40] itself remember when Moses was gone
[1:01:43] Aaron just gets this Revelation that he
[1:01:45] can take a calf and then lie to
[1:01:49] Moses and say that thing just jumped out
[1:01:52] of the fire Moses brother brother I mean
[1:01:54] that just that thing just
[1:01:56] jumped right out of the
[1:01:58] fire what' Moses do Moses had a little
[1:02:01] bit of a temper Moses said cook that
[1:02:04] thing down to ashes put it in your water
[1:02:07] and you're going to drink it hello put
[1:02:10] in that water and you going to drink
[1:02:12] that thing it jumped out of there and
[1:02:13] you started worshiping
[1:02:15] it our God's a good God but he's a god
[1:02:18] with a
[1:02:20] line when he draws a line there's no
[1:02:22] going AC cross it
[1:02:26] we already talked about
[1:02:27] sanctification so the Tabernacle and the
[1:02:30] shoe bread and the candlesticks is all
[1:02:32] in sanctification all right everybody
[1:02:34] with me and then remember the Israelites
[1:02:37] made that they made the shoe bread
[1:02:40] listen nobody made the Mana what's a
[1:02:42] Mana a Mana is a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:45] right nobody made that I was looking at
[1:02:48] a watching a commentary today there was
[1:02:50] some people some Jewish people were
[1:02:52] trying to find out the components of
[1:02:55] that Mana
[1:02:57] it was so good they didn't even need
[1:02:59] water they didn't need anything but that
[1:03:01] one little thing what about a vitamin I
[1:03:03] take a I take a handful they won't even
[1:03:05] fit in that cup a day to try to keep
[1:03:07] myself a little bit healthy it ain't
[1:03:10] working much but praise the Lord I don't
[1:03:14] know that it wouldn't if I don't take
[1:03:17] them but they pick that man up every day
[1:03:20] that fell from heaven there was nothing
[1:03:22] cooked they didn't cook it the priest
[1:03:25] didn't cook cook it Moses didn't cook it
[1:03:27] listen Moses didn't even say God we need
[1:03:30] Mana God just said here's
[1:03:33] Mana but now remember when the people
[1:03:37] get this when the people asked for
[1:03:42] something when they started loathing
[1:03:45] that Holy Ghost that was falling on
[1:03:48] them God sent them
[1:03:51] Quail but while the meat was in their
[1:03:53] teeth he sent serpents to kill them
[1:03:58] all stick with
[1:04:00] Mana that's right stick with Mana folks
[1:04:04] stick with the Holy Ghost amen stick
[1:04:06] with what God give
[1:04:09] us the Israelites made it in the form of
[1:04:11] an obong cake thick as your thumb large
[1:04:14] as a plate but it was consecrated to the
[1:04:16] Lord at the Lord's table so man made
[1:04:18] that and then man made it man had to
[1:04:21] deliver
[1:04:22] it that's why we need a five-fold
[1:04:24] Ministry we need a five-fold Ministry to
[1:04:27] get us into the holy of holies everybody
[1:04:29] with me that's why that second that's
[1:04:31] why that veil was there to keep us
[1:04:35] separated all right let's continue on
[1:04:37] let's get to something we'll quit right
[1:04:40] here we know what the shoe bread was we
[1:04:42] know what everybody knows what the
[1:04:43] Tabernacle was the type of it's type of
[1:04:45] me and you the outer Court like I said
[1:04:47] before the outer art there was a whole
[1:04:49] bunch of
[1:04:50] people there's a lot of people going to
[1:04:53] be justified cuz all you got to do is
[1:04:55] ask God truly ask God to forgive you of
[1:04:57] your past and he'll forgive
[1:05:03] you Millions upon millions of people
[1:05:05] would do
[1:05:08] that but the next part gets a little
[1:05:12] more tough right not as many people gets
[1:05:16] to go back there because you got to
[1:05:18] clean your life up before you
[1:05:20] go then when you go into the holy of
[1:05:22] holies it really sheds them off only one
[1:05:25] person goes
[1:05:26] in that's you and
[1:05:30] God for there was a tabernacle made the
[1:05:32] first wherein was the Candlestick the
[1:05:34] table the shoe bread which is called the
[1:05:36] sanctuary and after the second Veil The
[1:05:39] Tabernacle which is called the holiest
[1:05:41] of all that's what we're getting to the
[1:05:44] holiest of all which will be the baptism
[1:05:47] of the Holy Ghost which had the golden
[1:05:49] censor Ark of the Covenant overlaid with
[1:05:51] gold was the pot that had Mana in it
[1:05:54] that God made and it never got bad wow
[1:05:57] how about that and then Aaron's Rod that
[1:06:01] budded and the two tables the word of
[1:06:05] God that come from the mountain were SL
[1:06:08] were set in slots inside of
[1:06:10] that one little box if you want to see
[1:06:14] what's in it we got one right over there
[1:06:15] in the study that's a small miniature
[1:06:17] version of it and Aaron's Rod that
[1:06:20] budded and produced almonds in just a
[1:06:22] record number of time and it wasn't even
[1:06:24] put in the ground
[1:06:28] so let's look at this just for a second
[1:06:30] we'll close Luke 24: 49 said behold I
[1:06:34] send the promise of my father upon you
[1:06:36] but tar ye in the city of Jerusalem
[1:06:39] until you be endued that word ude me
[1:06:42] sunk into that Pillar of Fire didn't
[1:06:44] stay on top of their head it went down
[1:06:46] into them amen all right you can have
[1:06:49] the pillar of fire on top of your head
[1:06:50] every day of your life and die and go to
[1:06:51] hell hello andin know what the prophet
[1:06:54] of God said
[1:06:56] but once it gets in you and burns that
[1:06:58] old you up that old nature not your soul
[1:07:02] he God don't kill your soul CU he'd be
[1:07:05] killing you but the nature that's
[1:07:07] attached to that he kills he's the only
[1:07:10] one that can do it amen you can't do it
[1:07:14] right but until you be endued with power
[1:07:18] from on high Mark 15:37 Jesus cried with
[1:07:22] a loud voice and gave up The Ghost and
[1:07:24] the veil of the temple was rent and
[1:07:25] Twain From the top to the
[1:07:28] bottom they don't know what to do with
[1:07:31] you when you get born
[1:07:34] again cuz God rined the veil and exposes
[1:07:39] it you to the
[1:07:40] world and it was God because that
[1:07:42] thing's 20 or 30 something feet tall it
[1:07:45] started at the top and was rent from the
[1:07:48] top to the bottom only God could do
[1:07:52] that and I promise you they were some
[1:07:54] clamoring around you're not supposed to
[1:07:56] be able to see the
[1:07:58] thing they were trying to close it
[1:08:00] backwards probably cuz if you looked at
[1:08:03] it you died right but if they' have
[1:08:05] looked out the window like brother R
[1:08:07] said if they' looked out the window at
[1:08:08] Calvary they'd see that that veil was
[1:08:10] rent there right proven that that veil
[1:08:13] was no that Tabernacle was no more the
[1:08:16] holy of holies it was in a group of
[1:08:20] people God tore us apart I like that
[1:08:23] song you wash my eyes with tears I hope
[1:08:25] uh
[1:08:26] sister Anna mcfar used to sing that and
[1:08:28] it brought tears to my eyes he washed my
[1:08:30] eyes with tears that I might see the
[1:08:33] beauty of himself what revealed in
[1:08:36] me he tore it all
[1:08:39] apart and looked
[1:08:42] inside and saw
[1:08:44] somebody with a lot of Foolish Pride I
[1:08:47] love that song acts Tuesday when the day
[1:08:50] of Pentecost was fully come so now we're
[1:08:51] going to get into the that was that was
[1:08:54] that old Pentecost we're going to get in
[1:08:55] the new Pentecost just for a second then
[1:08:57] we'll close and suddenly there came a
[1:08:59] sound from Heaven as
[1:09:00] a as a as of a rushing Mighty Wind it
[1:09:05] filled all the house where they were
[1:09:06] sitting there appeared on them clothing
[1:09:08] tongues like as fire and it sat upon
[1:09:10] each one of them and they were all
[1:09:12] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[1:09:13] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[1:09:15] gave them utterance now the spokesman
[1:09:18] for Pentecost was Peter not the
[1:09:23] messenger everybody with me Peter was
[1:09:25] not a prophet Peter was a messenger a
[1:09:28] spokesperson all right he wasn't the
[1:09:30] messenger spokesperson all right Bishop
[1:09:32] param was over here cuz watch what
[1:09:34] brother R says questions and answers on
[1:09:35] the seals you see each one of these ages
[1:09:38] only took a dip into the Holy Spirit now
[1:09:40] listen that didn't mean they didn't get
[1:09:42] it they got the Holy Spirit right every
[1:09:46] age had bride and bride Somebody went in
[1:09:49] the holy of holies that was bride in
[1:09:51] those ages with the word that they had
[1:09:54] that's right that with me but remember
[1:09:56] it was a portion it was a dip it was a
[1:09:59] piece it was reforming people
[1:10:03] justification is a work of the Holy
[1:10:05] Spirit sanctification is a work of the
[1:10:07] Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy
[1:10:10] spirit that's the reason it took a
[1:10:13] prophetic Prophet to come down he's
[1:10:15] talking about
[1:10:17] himself then he says no messenger what
[1:10:19] to the age of
[1:10:21] Pentecost everybody with
[1:10:23] Meen no Messenger to the age what a
[1:10:27] spokesperson a spokes people param uh
[1:10:31] daddy Seymour read about isusa Street
[1:10:33] powerful group of people and they were
[1:10:35] they were
[1:10:36] black just tore the place
[1:10:41] apart no mess to the age because the
[1:10:44] Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness
[1:10:46] of the baptism so on the isusa street in
[1:10:49] 1906 if you'll see they were building up
[1:10:52] and it's kind of like that I want us to
[1:10:53] see here too I was talking to brother
[1:10:56] Keith this past weekend there's
[1:10:58] something there's not something holding
[1:11:00] this church back but there's something
[1:11:02] that we're going to have to step up
[1:11:04] too we got the
[1:11:06] word the word in tape and book form
[1:11:10] brother Dale was preached it for 50
[1:11:12] Years everybody with me I can't preach
[1:11:14] it no
[1:11:16] different we just got to get it living
[1:11:18] inside of
[1:11:19] us living moving breathing
[1:11:22] instrumentality of God to where we can
[1:11:24] worship the way we need to worship and
[1:11:26] supposed to worship and there's no
[1:11:28] restrictions on worship there's no time
[1:11:31] restraint on
[1:11:36] worship I'm not saying there's nothing
[1:11:38] wrong I'm just saying if if this is a
[1:11:40] new season and this is a new time then
[1:11:42] we need to not have a new mentality we
[1:11:44] just have to have a spark of what we
[1:11:48] already
[1:11:49] have listen folks we're not going we
[1:11:51] can't go out there and get something
[1:11:53] else if you if you find it let's go get
[1:11:56] it everybody with me if you if you can
[1:11:59] find it we'll go get it it's been
[1:12:01] preached here we just got to live it
[1:12:03] amen and then what we got to do we got
[1:12:05] to live it then what we got to do we got
[1:12:08] to show
[1:12:10] it amen and it's
[1:12:13] happening okay is everybody with me no
[1:12:16] Messengers to the age because the Holy
[1:12:18] Ghost came himself in other
[1:12:20] words
[1:12:23] Peter with a spokesperson
[1:12:27] cuz they asked him said men and Brethren
[1:12:28] what must we do he said repent be
[1:12:31] baptized all
[1:12:32] right but now later on here comes
[1:12:36] Paul Paul gets converted he meets Peter
[1:12:39] they're preaching the same
[1:12:40] thing and they hadn't seen each other
[1:12:42] for years they're preaching the same
[1:12:45] thing now how can that be they both had
[1:12:47] his holy ghost the same Holy Ghost now
[1:12:50] why can't we get together in the end
[1:12:52] time I'm fixing to say something here
[1:12:54] why can't we get together in theend time
[1:12:55] and have the same have the same not
[1:12:58] views like brother Dell always said
[1:13:00] what's your input no they should be able
[1:13:03] to get together just like I have never
[1:13:05] you know like brother George Quinn if I
[1:13:06] never met him and he comes here and sits
[1:13:08] down and we talk we'll be able to talk
[1:13:10] about the same
[1:13:13] thing we're going to have a Minister's
[1:13:15] meet here in September we ain't had one
[1:13:17] in several years pray for
[1:13:20] us 20 people 20
[1:13:23] ideas which shouldn't be that way
[1:13:26] we should be in
[1:13:28] unity but what do we do we let emotion
[1:13:31] and
[1:13:34] feelings we let our own emotions and
[1:13:37] feelings get
[1:13:40] involved and there's one thing brother
[1:13:43] Dell told us to do with those
[1:13:45] right P them up put them in your back
[1:13:48] pocket and sit down on
[1:13:50] them what what you say am and how much
[1:13:54] we do that no we don't we change a
[1:13:56] little something or something happens
[1:13:57] and we're like I don't like that but
[1:13:59] they no I'm just
[1:14:02] kidding but at the end of the age now
[1:14:04] watch as it always ends up upon the
[1:14:10] other yeah we find there see the
[1:14:12] messenger sent param was not the
[1:14:15] messenger to that age he was a
[1:14:18] spokesperson cuz brother R says
[1:14:20] specifically the Holy Ghost came
[1:14:23] himself and pour out the holy ghost on a
[1:14:26] group of people in isua California from
[1:14:29] A to Z in the USA that's what isua
[1:14:32] means and then it what it spread all
[1:14:35] over the United States and then it went
[1:14:37] across the the over into the other
[1:14:40] countries so it was the Holy Ghost
[1:14:42] working in a group of people but what
[1:14:44] were they doing they were still working
[1:14:46] in that come on
[1:14:49] bondage they were working in
[1:14:52] bondage but when brother brandham come
[1:14:54] they should have come out of those
[1:14:55] shackles and come out of that bondage
[1:14:57] but they stayed right in there and said
[1:14:59] no this is
[1:15:01] it right brother Brown said you think
[1:15:04] you got it all you ain't got started yet
[1:15:06] I bet they loved him saying
[1:15:09] that but remember but the End of the Age
[1:15:11] so at the end of the Pentecostal age
[1:15:13] here comes the prophet the messenger the
[1:15:17] person the number seven the messenger
[1:15:20] there's no eight Messengers it's eight
[1:15:22] manifestations of the Holy Ghost but
[1:15:23] only seven Messengers cuz that's what
[1:15:25] the Bible says but at the end of the age
[1:15:29] as it always ends up on the other we
[1:15:31] find then the messenger sent look
[1:15:33] because he identifies and all these
[1:15:35] Scruples are to be placed in their
[1:15:37] places that didn't happen at
[1:15:39] Pentecost they just got the gifts they
[1:15:42] were stored the gifts they still had
[1:15:45] what loose sins brother R said they
[1:15:47] still had baptism wrong they still had
[1:15:50] trinitarian ideas so brother randam had
[1:15:53] to come the messenger come at the end of
[1:15:54] the what Pentecostal age and all these
[1:15:57] Scruples and things are to be placed in
[1:15:59] their places like that then the Rapture
[1:16:03] comes for the
[1:16:08] church but as many is allotted all these
[1:16:11] different things the sun turned to
[1:16:13] Darkness to Moon they put that way back
[1:16:15] there in the Christian age they just
[1:16:17] fail to see them three questions was
[1:16:19] asked of Our Lord when he answered them
[1:16:21] he was talking about it's coming true
[1:16:24] right then
[1:16:26] cuz remember the three questions they
[1:16:27] asked him was right before the
[1:16:29] seals in Matthew
[1:16:31] 24 Jesus preached the seals brother R
[1:16:34] didn't preach the seals first man don't
[1:16:36] do things first God does things
[1:16:39] first Jesus preached the seals in
[1:16:42] Matthew
[1:16:42] 24 preached six seals and he was the
[1:16:45] seventh standing right
[1:16:47] there so brother brandom had to come and
[1:16:50] preach those seals Christ preached them
[1:16:52] through
[1:16:53] him that's why the Mighty angel had to
[1:16:55] come down and then he had to speak but
[1:16:58] in the days of the voice so who gets it
[1:17:00] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:17:01] angel when he begins to sound the
[1:17:04] mystery let's stand our feet the
[1:17:07] mystery you're the mystery the mystery
[1:17:10] of God should be
[1:17:12] finished the Alpha and Omega has come
[1:17:16] together we've made it we're
[1:17:19] here we're at the
[1:17:23] end we're going to start talking talking
[1:17:25] about some of the major
[1:17:27] doctrines cuz
[1:17:29] remember we're going to spend a little
[1:17:31] bit of
[1:17:33] time on the first part of brother
[1:17:36] Brown's Ministry which was
[1:17:38] what tying up the Loose
[1:17:40] Ends starting a healing campaign the
[1:17:44] healing campaign was what the bait on
[1:17:47] the hook it was not the hook it was the
[1:17:50] bait on the hook right brother John it
[1:17:52] was the bait on the hook wasn't wasn't
[1:17:54] the bait's what the bait is what
[1:17:55] attracts the fish but what catches the
[1:17:57] fish is the hook you put bait on the end
[1:18:00] of a stick and throw it out there end of
[1:18:02] a rope and they'll just eat didn't go on
[1:18:04] but you put a good hook inside that they
[1:18:06] ain't going nowhere so what' he do he
[1:18:08] hooked me and you he caught where those
[1:18:11] fish that he caught
[1:18:13] people in the vision of the third pole
[1:18:15] where the
[1:18:17] fish where the fish that he caught amen
[1:18:20] right because of the healing
[1:18:23] campaign the the word
[1:18:25] comes in manifestation and in power and
[1:18:29] puts it all back together again and
[1:18:31] that's where we stand today God bless
[1:18:34] you let's sing a
[1:18:37] song at night I lay in bed and I begin
[1:18:43] to
[1:18:46] cry and my mind just fail to know
[1:18:53] exactly why
[1:18:58] I can
[1:18:59] explain with tongue
[1:19:02] or the spirit
[1:19:05] gring deep
[1:19:08] within it must be gone here in my soul
[1:19:14] cuz I feel the
[1:19:16] PO we ought to be able to feel it I feel
[1:19:20] cuz that's what we that's what we're
