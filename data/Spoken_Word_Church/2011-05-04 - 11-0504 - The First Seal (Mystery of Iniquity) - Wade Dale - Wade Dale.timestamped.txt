[11:15] I can see you as a person but I want to
[11:18] understand who you are I want to
[11:20] understand who this man is and we're
[11:23] talking about this man in Christ Jesus
[11:25] there's been a lot of people seen him
[11:27] with their natural lives and didn't
[11:29] believe him but those that understood
[11:31] him knows that understood him they
[11:35] actually saw him Gloria and the way he

[11:43] amen just be breathing in this day and
[11:45] age works
[11:47] that's right so it is good to be in the
[11:51] house of the Lord it's good to be uh
[11:53] Good to Be Alive good to be in this end
[11:55] time this day and age that uh
[11:58] we need to get some more prayer claws we
[12:01] gotta get some more prayer cloths up
[12:03] here we need some
[12:04] we'll get some but it's good to be with
[12:07] each and every one of you if you got
[12:08] your Bibles let's go ahead and turn the
[12:09] Revelations chapter six
[12:12] and uh
[12:15] kind of continue a thought that we're
[12:17] doing in Sunday school class
[12:20] on the first seal
[12:23] in the Book of Revelations
[12:26] and try to
[12:29] maybe take it at a little different
[12:30] angle than maybe you've heard it before
[12:32] so we'll
[12:34] we'll see because remember
[12:37] when God starts
[12:39] he does something the same way all the
[12:41] time but when Satan starts brother Brown
[12:44] said he changes his tactics but if you
[12:47] can't get you one way he'll try to go
[12:49] around and get you another way but God
[12:51] is one way he doesn't change he doesn't
[12:53] go oops I made a mistake but Satan does
[12:56] Satan tries to get at you from several
[12:58] different ways so I know all of us we
[13:01] already raised our hand but if you got a
[13:03] request on your heart just lift your
[13:05] hand up to the Lord and say Lord I I
[13:07] need something from you tonight let's
[13:09] bow our heads dear heavenly father we
[13:10] pray tonight Lord that you would just
[13:12] touch us
[13:13] be with each one Lord in presence that
[13:16] you would just touch each one in the
[13:17] building finally we all defied the law
[13:20] of gravity by raising our hand Lord and
[13:22] you know the desires of our heart
[13:24] I pray that you'd come Among Us in a
[13:26] special way Lord not to be someone just
[13:28] to sit on the Queue but Lord be an
[13:30] active participant you take over lord
[13:32] not just not just speak the words but
[13:35] Lord actually take the words and make
[13:36] them alive take the words and Quicken
[13:39] them to our heart the Lord that we can
[13:41] take it brother but I don't see we could
[13:43] take that sword and put it right to the
[13:44] heart of the enemy Lord we pray now
[13:47] father that you would just bless the
[13:48] ones that are not here Lord touch them
[13:50] be with them heal them forgive them of
[13:52] their sins Lord the ones that are
[13:54] sending sick and back sled Lord we pray
[13:56] that you will just bring them into the
[13:57] foal fighter this is the late hour that
[14:00] we should not be playing Lord we should
[14:02] be Lord as as we put our heads and our
[14:06] hearts and our feet and our hands to the
[14:08] grinding stone and press toward the mark
[14:10] of the High Calling father we pray that
[14:12] you had just touched the missionaries
[14:14] and we were the bride around the world
[14:15] all the ones that are fighting this
[14:17] fight of Faith Lord the ones that are
[14:19] that Lord that are sick that's called in
[14:23] Lord and around the country father we
[14:25] pray that you just heal each one be with
[14:27] us Lord
[14:29] forgive us of our sins truly Lord we
[14:31] have many but you said you would forgive
[14:34] everyone Lord if we would ask we ask you
[14:36] tonight Lord that you clean our hearts
[14:38] clean our mind clean our ears and take
[14:41] the eyes out of the Holy Spirit and
[14:43] clean our eyes Lord so that we truly can
[14:45] see or understand what you're doing in
[14:48] this end time father just bless us and
[14:50] be with us take care of us in Jesus amen
[14:54] you got your Bibles that turned to
[14:56] Revelations chapter six
[14:57] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[15:00] the seals and I heard as it were the
[15:01] noise of Thunder one of the four beasts
[15:04] saying
[15:05] come and see and I saw him Behold a
[15:08] white horse
[15:09] and he had settled him at a bowl and a
[15:12] crown was given unto him and he went
[15:14] forth conquering and to conquer all
[15:18] right now while you're standing let's
[15:19] turn to Revelations one just flip back
[15:21] over there
[15:23] because I believe in the end time we can
[15:25] look back into the ages
[15:27] and watch what Jesus says to John
[15:29] because remember what is John John is a
[15:32] type of the Bride right right all right
[15:34] because in verse 9 he says I John
[15:37] I'm also your brother
[15:39] now look down verse 10 I was in the
[15:41] spirit on the Lord's Day
[15:43] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[15:46] a trumpet
[15:48] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[15:51] and the last
[15:53] what thou seeest write in the book and
[15:55] send it into the seven Church ages and
[15:57] we know which ones they are let's go
[15:59] over to
[16:01] verse 19 he tells John to write the
[16:04] things which thou has seen and the
[16:06] things which are and the things which
[16:08] shall be
[16:10] Hereafter verse 17. fear not John I am
[16:14] the first
[16:15] and the last all right you may be seated
[16:18] in the Lord has blessing to the reading
[16:19] of the word if you don't mind flipping
[16:21] back to Revelation 6
[16:23] that we were starting in the study in
[16:25] the Bible study of course it takes a
[16:26] little bit of time and it's kind of like
[16:27] being a pastor downstairs you can take
[16:29] one Sunday and then another Sunday and
[16:32] another Sunday and another Sunday and
[16:33] you really don't have to to push
[16:35] yourself like we're gonna have to push
[16:37] ourselves tonight I can uh you know
[16:40] relate brother Jim Pinkston you know
[16:41] taking 20 services and put it in one
[16:43] well that's what we're going to try to
[16:44] do we're going to take about four or
[16:46] five of these and put them together and
[16:48] that should be about two and a half
[16:49] hours but I told Brother boy just he
[16:51] said how much time do you need I said
[16:52] just get up and start singing Open the
[16:54] Eyes of My Heart Lord and we'll get
[16:56] started but we have to have the worship
[16:58] service to get us all in mind we know
[17:00] that we have to have it it's not a it's
[17:02] not a option it's a have to we have to
[17:05] have the the service the preliminary
[17:07] service to get our minds clear if not
[17:11] um it'd be a fight in both of our
[17:13] directions mine and yours but remember
[17:16] John types the bride and John was
[17:18] looking here in Revelations 1 and Jesus
[17:21] was telling him said I am the first and
[17:22] I am the last so whatever Jesus was at
[17:24] first Jesus was going to be at the last
[17:25] all right exactly so now and keeping
[17:29] your mind we're not going to try to
[17:30] change anything but listen
[17:33] we know as we've been taught in this
[17:35] church that the seal one seal just one
[17:38] can tie the entire Bible together man
[17:41] right one seal
[17:43] you say well how can I do that well
[17:45] let's see if we can help you understand
[17:46] one of them anyway all right because
[17:49] excuse me
[17:51] in Revelation 6 we start and we see
[17:54] symbols when we see a uh something uh
[17:59] one of the four beasts saying come and
[18:01] see right now we know what beach that
[18:03] was that was a lion man all right now
[18:06] it's kind of strange that when John
[18:07] looked in Revelation 5 he looked for a
[18:09] lamb and he saw a line right so this
[18:12] line just stepped right over and starts
[18:13] opening the seals that's somebody that's
[18:15] already conquered that lion is is the
[18:17] one that done all the that that was
[18:20] there that that just took over brother
[18:22] round said he was bold right even in the
[18:24] first three ages we see that that God
[18:26] took that first three ages and put that
[18:29] lion l-i-o-n not lying lying spirit in
[18:33] those people and they had the pure word
[18:35] of God and they acted on what the word
[18:38] said right all right so guess what if he
[18:41] was Alpha and Omega guess what same
[18:42] thing's got to happen to you and I right
[18:44] man all right now let's understand one
[18:46] thing for sure let's don't do away with
[18:48] all the other seals but you can take
[18:49] this one seal here and take it all the
[18:51] way to the
[18:55] because when this man gets on this horse
[18:58] the prophet said he rides on it rides
[19:00] right into eternity all he done was got
[19:02] off of one horse and changed
[19:05] got on another horse but that white
[19:07] horse just kept riding on exactly
[19:10] because in the fourth seal you're gonna
[19:11] see what is pale it's white red black
[19:16] right right all mixed together so
[19:19] there's white in that pail amen hey man
[19:22] is that okay there's wild in that pail
[19:24] that's what makes that pale right it's
[19:27] white red and black everybody understand
[19:29] so far say amen amen all right so
[19:32] there's one we don't do away with that
[19:33] white horse oh
[19:36] it goes off to sit out of the scene but
[19:39] brother Ryan says underneath right he
[19:42] says inside all that that thing's still
[19:45] working so keep that in your head
[19:47] because remember this is John on the
[19:50] Isle of Palace in 1896 but actually in
[19:53] 80 33 we see this Antichrist Spirit
[19:56] begin to work in the people just as soon
[19:59] as the Holy Ghost fell and made those
[20:01] people on the day of Pentecost a white
[20:03] righteous Church
[20:05] hey man
[20:06] Satan brought his white righteous Church
[20:08] in all right so now
[20:11] let's turn over to
[20:13] Acts 20.
[20:17] to get the character and then we're
[20:19] gonna then we're gonna work our way back
[20:22] because even in Acts 20
[20:26] Paul is speaking
[20:29] in 80 60. so from 80 33 the Holy Ghost
[20:33] fell then now you've got ad60
[20:37] you have got this going on watch what he
[20:40] says
[20:41] verse 27.
[20:46] for I have not shown to declare to
[20:48] declare unto you all the counsel of God
[20:50] take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[20:53] to all the flock over the which the Holy
[20:56] Ghost have made you overseers now he
[20:58] didn't say me he said youth right all
[21:00] right
[21:06] made you overseers to feed the Church of
[21:09] God which he had purchased with his own
[21:12] blood amen for I know this
[21:16] that after-minded parting shall Grievous
[21:18] wolves enter in among you not sparing
[21:22] the Flop now Paul didn't stop there
[21:25] he said Grievous rules will enter in
[21:29] right in other words right into your
[21:32] congregation but Paul didn't stop there
[21:34] right Paul gets just a little bit
[21:36] personal and says also of your own
[21:40] ourselves
[21:42] shall men
[21:44] arise
[21:46] right out of your own congregation
[21:51] he's bringing it home so you can say oh
[21:54] it's easy to say well we see all this
[21:55] this church coming in and this Catholic
[21:58] church and them trying to think no Paul
[22:00] said that's going to happen but he says
[22:01] also of your own selves exactly shall
[22:04] men arise speak in perverse things to
[22:07] draw away disciples
[22:09] after
[22:10] them right all right so we know that
[22:13] it's not out there it's in here right
[22:16] right all right
[22:17] and actually
[22:19] it's working in people right even
[22:23] brother Branham said then Katie and
[22:25] Katie's Barney we're going to read it in
[22:27] a minute Israel in case born in 1956. he
[22:30] said it was a problem was immense
[22:32] multitude right right that was the
[22:35] problem with the mixed multitude but we
[22:36] get in just a minute let's go to first
[22:37] John 2.
[22:40] get some of these scriptures here
[22:43] but remember
[22:46] Paul didn't know what to name this right
[22:50] but now watch
[22:51] a man that had already went to Patmos
[22:54] and come back
[22:56] here's John the Revelator and the Little
[22:59] John
[23:01] 120 it says in first John 2
[23:04] 18.
[23:07] little children it is the last time
[23:09] right and as you have heard that
[23:12] Antichrist shall come
[23:14] even now
[23:16] are they many antichrists right plural
[23:20] whereby we know that is the last time
[23:24] they went out from us but they but they
[23:26] were not of us or if they had been of us
[23:29] they wouldn't have no doubt have
[23:30] continued with us but they went out that
[23:33] they might be made manifest that they
[23:35] were not us all right now go to second
[23:38] John and what did what did he call it he
[23:40] called it Antichrist amen because he had
[23:43] confronted this thing on the Alabama
[23:46] second John 7
[23:51] I'm sorry second John verse
[23:54] salmon there's only one chapter in the
[23:56] second John second John
[23:58] 7th verse through the tenth for many
[24:02] deceivers are entered into the world who
[24:04] confess not that Jesus Christ Has Come
[24:06] In the Flesh this is a deceiver and an
[24:08] antichrist right
[24:10] Antichrist look to yourselves that we
[24:12] lose not those things which we have
[24:14] wrought
[24:15] but that we will receive a full reward
[24:18] we don't have to read that all right
[24:20] there but we see we see that there's
[24:22] something set here
[24:24] and we see that God is working on his
[24:27] end and Satan is working on his end all
[24:30] right now let's go back to the Book of
[24:32] Revelations to chapter six
[24:34] and I know you've already went through
[24:36] these symbols but guess what we're going
[24:38] to go through them again because we're
[24:40] going to set something here and see
[24:43] what God
[24:45] has forced but give me just a second I
[24:47] want to look at something
[24:48] and then we want
[24:53] to go back through I wanted to read
[24:55] something I think I skipped it that's
[24:57] okay I'm trying to go too fast I guess
[25:02] okay that's all right
[25:04] now go back to Revelation six now we see
[25:08] in Revelation 6 back to the symbol so
[25:10] we're gonna go looking into the symbols
[25:13] and remember one thing
[25:16] power was given
[25:18] to whoever this right guy was this fella
[25:22] power was given to this person he didn't
[25:25] have any power amen so the power was
[25:28] given to him all right and I want you to
[25:30] keep one word in the back of your mind
[25:31] choice
[25:34] choice
[25:36] c-h-o-i-c-e choice that means you're a
[25:40] free moral agent you can make a choice
[25:41] that's right all right okay
[25:45] that's why we're going to see that that
[25:47] and we're just sitting in the back and I
[25:49] kind of didn't know uh brother Dale some
[25:52] of them may know how you started
[25:53] thinking you start at the first
[25:54] sometimes and then you get the ending of
[25:56] it and you don't have nothing in the
[25:57] middle right you know how you're going
[25:59] to start you know how you want to end
[26:00] but Lord has to fill it up so he just
[26:03] did here because I can see now where
[26:06] this first seal started back before time
[26:07] even began
[26:10] see it started way back when Satan made
[26:13] choice right all right but now let's go
[26:16] back and see so that just kind of give
[26:18] you a little something to get bored in
[26:19] between you know what we're heading to
[26:21] all right but back to the symbols the
[26:24] white
[26:25] horse I saw him Behold a white horse now
[26:28] who is talking one of the four beasts
[26:31] which is the lion
[26:32] the lion says come and see
[26:34] all right in other words he's saying
[26:35] enter into this vision
[26:37] and I strongly Behold a white horse now
[26:40] what does that represent a white horse
[26:42] represents a white pure righteous church
[26:45] or a power a horse is a power right
[26:48] that's why they call it horsepower right
[26:50] okay so it's a power and he that sat on
[26:54] him had a boat all right now this bowl
[26:58] we understand did not have any arrows so
[27:01] you can just kind of make a little Mark
[27:02] there
[27:03] Bluff right all right so we understand
[27:06] that but I'm trying to I'm going to make
[27:07] something a little bit later
[27:09] because I want to see I wanted to show
[27:12] and that's what we're going to get to in
[27:13] a Sunday school class
[27:15] that even this first seal we see it
[27:18] produce itself in the end time right we
[27:21] said all that open well
[27:23] the real opening is not going to happen
[27:25] till we get out of here the real man of
[27:27] sin but that Revelations chapter 6 verse
[27:31] 1 starts with the first seal and brother
[27:33] Brown typed him with the first three
[27:34] ages all right
[27:36] so there's your Alpha then you got Omega
[27:39] which is us so you got to bring it where
[27:41] it'll go here and go here I know for a
[27:43] fact that the four seal types the
[27:45] seventh Church age I know that for a
[27:47] fact but I thought we're supposed to be
[27:49] caught out of the ages right bride
[27:51] wasn't in an age exactly all right so we
[27:55] can
[27:56] we cannot parallel this but we can
[27:59] compare right
[28:01] because you know one seal is not the
[28:03] first church age the second Seal's not
[28:04] the second church right all right the
[28:06] first deal and for those of you that
[28:08] that have not been here for a while the
[28:10] first deal you it encompasses the first
[28:12] three ages you listen to brother Brown
[28:15] what you want about the fifth seal he'll
[28:16] go back and start telling you where all
[28:18] these things are you got the first one
[28:19] then you got the the fourth Church age
[28:22] which is your plant Morris then your red
[28:25] horse remember that was the Dark Ages
[28:27] when all the killings were happening
[28:28] then you got the fifth and sixth Church
[28:31] age which was the lion the ox the man
[28:34] which was Lutheran Wesley which was dark
[28:36] which was death which was you know it
[28:39] was something that that uh you had the
[28:41] black you think well boy the the the
[28:43] middle age there when they killed all
[28:46] the Christians would have been that no
[28:48] this one's even worse right
[28:50] because they started making
[28:52] denominations exactly and dying right
[28:55] the fourth age was physically dying
[28:57] right that red was physically it was
[29:00] um blood right but in that fifth and
[29:03] sixth Church age you see that this Rider
[29:06] had come on and made and called himself
[29:08] death now because what happened
[29:12] they started taking denominational ideas
[29:14] and brother Brown said they died by the
[29:17] billion spiritually which is worse than
[29:19] what happened in the fourth age and in
[29:21] the last age which is the eagle age
[29:23] which is your seventh Church age so
[29:25] maybe that kind of gives you a little
[29:26] little uh part of what we're doing but
[29:30] what
[29:31] a bow
[29:33] and a crown was given right so in other
[29:37] words he didn't have one
[29:39] huh
[29:41] if I give brother Donnie my knife he
[29:44] didn't have it previously but now I give
[29:46] it to him right all right so I give it
[29:47] to him
[29:49] you gave it to me to start with so
[29:52] I'm just giving it back to him I want
[29:55] him back after service
[29:57] now what he's got something to work with
[30:00] right
[30:01] before he didn't
[30:04] so now he's
[30:05] so now you got the white righteous
[30:07] church that starts out in the first
[30:08] church age you've got a man sitting on a
[30:10] horse with a bow a symbol of power I
[30:14] said a symbol of power it's not power
[30:15] but a symbol of power
[30:18] now we don't go hunting with just a bowl
[30:21] we have Arrows with it right and I know
[30:24] you know brother Gary's not here tonight
[30:25] but uh he always makes mention that that
[30:28] this man sitting on here has a bow and
[30:30] we give him all the arrows to shoot at
[30:32] us which is exactly the truth because he
[30:36] has no power
[30:37] but Power was given read all those seals
[30:40] I I have circled each one down here in
[30:43] chapter six power was given
[30:46] to this person to do something right he
[30:49] didn't have the power to start with
[30:50] right that's why we're going to parallel
[30:52] you say well well where did all this
[30:54] start it started before the time began
[30:56] we just said but now there's something
[30:58] else that this person does
[31:02] he says a crown was given unto him and
[31:04] he went forth conquering right which was
[31:08] right then right
[31:10] and two conquer right later on so he
[31:13] didn't stop in that first church age
[31:15] conquering he conquered the people in
[31:18] the church age and he continued
[31:20] Conquering the people right all right to
[31:22] come conquering and to conquer in other
[31:25] words he furthered his Doctrine he went
[31:27] on Through the Ages on that same White
[31:30] Horse right all right now
[31:33] all right so the word conquering means
[31:36] to overcome
[31:38] look how shrewd Satan is because see you
[31:41] can take all these symbols yeah and you
[31:44] see that we are a white righteous church
[31:46] we are the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[31:49] white righteous church amen they're the
[31:51] real white righteous Church all right
[31:53] but we're given a sword which is the
[31:55] word of God and we're given Crown but
[31:57] it's a crown of of eternal life right
[32:00] and we do go forth conquering that's my
[32:02] brother around this was so close that
[32:04] that Prophet preached in 1957 he
[32:06] preached the mighty conqueror and he
[32:08] read Revelation 6 verse 1 and 2. all
[32:12] right as being the holy ghost riding out
[32:15] right conquering and con to conquer the
[32:18] people
[32:18] not knowing that underneath there Satan
[32:23] was working his little deal all right
[32:25] but see when you get to the true opening
[32:27] of the seal when you open a seal that
[32:29] means that when you open a seal in a
[32:31] truck when we have a uh a truck come in
[32:33] we have to make sure that seal is the is
[32:35] correct on the bill of lading and if
[32:38] it's the correct seal which has a number
[32:39] on it then we break it and guess what
[32:41] happens
[32:42] we see what's inside
[32:44] all right so when that seal breaks you
[32:46] can see what's inside all right so
[32:48] that's what was happening is when when
[32:50] this these sealed were being opened
[32:51] brother Brandon God allowed him to open
[32:54] that seal and look inside and see what
[32:56] man had not looked on remember he he
[32:58] told us the vision of the pyramid right
[33:01] when he whipped that top off what did he
[33:03] do he said I saw words that man had
[33:05] never seen before
[33:07] in other words they were there the whole
[33:09] time
[33:10] but man had never seen it right but when
[33:12] he whipped that top off he was able to
[33:14] see that all right so Satan has been
[33:17] working since the beginning of time amen
[33:19] and and God's been working since the
[33:21] beginning of time
[33:23] but we get the real part and he has the
[33:26] perverty part right all right so now
[33:28] remember this power was given
[33:31] all right
[33:33] the word conquering means to overcome or
[33:35] to subdue
[33:36] listen to this
[33:38] think of what happened in those first
[33:41] few ages because remember the third age
[33:43] ended at 606. it's kind of strange and
[33:45] ended it and I said yeah the third age
[33:48] ended at 606 when when I see it that
[33:51] last Nicene Council come into being
[33:53] that's when the last age stopped and we
[33:55] know there's an overlap there but if you
[33:57] look in your church age book I looked it
[33:59] up and that's when it ended but listen
[34:00] to this opposition or resistance of the
[34:03] will
[34:04] what is a whale yeah choice right
[34:07] opposition or resistance of the will by
[34:11] moral Force
[34:13] it's better to serve God they said oh
[34:16] yeah
[34:17] he's trying to kiss that cross Bears
[34:19] serve God better to kill him
[34:21] than to let them die you know Infidel
[34:23] that's what the Catholic Church said
[34:25] listen to this overcome by argument what
[34:28] they do it and I said they argue brother
[34:30] Brown said they should have never went
[34:31] to not seeing and argued right right all
[34:34] right
[34:35] persuasion overcome by argument
[34:37] persuasion or other influences all right
[34:41] now remember
[34:43] to me that all sums up into a choice
[34:47] there was a choice being made
[34:49] right or wrong but the choice looked
[34:52] right
[34:54] oh yeah the choice looked right sure to
[34:57] the ones that chose this white righteous
[34:59] church with a pope and give him a crown
[35:01] and give him power and all the things
[35:03] like that they thought they'd made the
[35:05] right choice so now this is kind of
[35:08] where I kind of got bogged down a little
[35:09] bit but uh instead of sitting back there
[35:12] studying a little bit ago and the Lord
[35:14] just brought it back to my memory that
[35:16] this seal began in heaven
[35:18] it began in heaven it didn't begin down
[35:21] here in in 1896 it didn't begin in 80
[35:24] 33.
[35:26] he began in heaven before the foundation
[35:28] of the world right
[35:30] right because you had a
[35:32] white angel Satan's not red with all
[35:36] right we had the uh horns and a tail and
[35:39] he doesn't wear a red jumpsuit
[35:41] this guy is a white righteous Angel
[35:45] right that can imitate anything God has
[35:49] except one thing Satan cannot duplicate
[35:52] himself or create right all right he
[35:55] only perverts so keep that in your mind
[35:57] because this we're bringing it right
[35:59] down all right but this seal began in
[36:01] heaven and this seal I believe this seal
[36:04] ties in the entire Bible together
[36:06] because it it shows the choice of man
[36:10] because the the denominations didn't
[36:13] cease they're going to go all the way
[36:16] through to the white Throne judgment
[36:18] that denominational idea not a Methodist
[36:20] Baptist Pentecostal prison I'm talking
[36:21] about denominational ideas because you
[36:23] don't understand one thing I'm not
[36:25] putting those in there Methodist I'm
[36:28] just saying denominational idea it's
[36:29] going to go right into the lights on
[36:31] judgment because what it's going to do
[36:32] is is the foolish version
[36:35] anyone's giving eternal life
[36:39] are going to be called in that group
[36:40] right all right so now this one seal
[36:43] pies the entire Bible together what
[36:46] happened when God
[36:48] brought a white righteous
[36:52] Adam and Eve
[36:54] to the Garden of Eden
[36:57] Satan comes right now oh yeah
[37:01] and what does he do
[37:04] he conquered Eve right
[37:07] right
[37:08] by bluffing her
[37:11] into believing he had the right idea
[37:13] sure because remember a bow with no
[37:17] arrows
[37:19] Satan has no power
[37:22] unless you give it to him amen now
[37:26] he bluffed her into believing
[37:30] he so bluffed her into believing that
[37:33] this Beast
[37:35] was going to produce what God yeah
[37:38] wanted her to produce oh yeah I'm
[37:42] talking about a natural Beast standing
[37:44] right here in the Garden of Eden because
[37:46] remember it starts with a beast in the
[37:47] garden and it ends with a beast in the
[37:49] end time right all right Satan Superman
[37:52] well
[37:53] the only part with this man is is this
[37:55] this Beast here didn't have this Beast
[37:57] didn't have a soul
[37:58] right all right this speaks over here is
[38:00] going to have us all right all right see
[38:03] how he's progressed but should I stay
[38:05] back into the end of the first seal
[38:06] though
[38:07] but he conquered Eve by bluffing her
[38:09] into believing that he could reproduce
[38:11] himself oh yeah
[38:14] thinking she's reproducing God
[38:17] but she's reproducing Satan right
[38:24] Satan had no power
[38:26] he had a bowl right
[38:28] he had a beast
[38:30] but he had no seeds right Satan had no
[38:33] literal seed
[38:35] it's not Satan seed it's the serpent
[38:38] seed that did the act the actual C you
[38:40] understand what I'm saying amen yeah so
[38:43] he perverted
[38:44] what God had shown to be true with all
[38:48] the animals Satan just perverted what he
[38:50] had right there's that first seal that
[38:52] white righteous man standing in that
[38:54] garden with the true white righteous
[38:57] church that first church age wasn't
[38:59] fault
[39:00] Paul Peter James John
[39:04] uh all the ones in the old in the New
[39:07] Testament in the book of Acts that was a
[39:09] white righteous church that was God's
[39:11] church that was the church he wanted
[39:13] right he wanted Adam and Eve in the
[39:15] Garden of Eden Pure white people sure
[39:18] now I'm not meaning why and why I'm
[39:20] talking about white isn't pure right all
[39:22] right
[39:23] pure people
[39:26] but Satan comes in
[39:30] and he starts bluffing Eve oh yeah
[39:33] you'll not surely die
[39:36] surely die you're not say Satan is a
[39:40] smart guy
[39:41] but now watch as it comes down a little
[39:43] bit further
[39:46] so he comes in as as a pure
[39:49] White
[39:51] He's Just Gonna Save the whole world
[39:54] he's going to talk even to doing this
[39:56] thing that's so hideous but he's
[39:59] believing it all right
[40:02] we know what happened I mean she had a
[40:06] relation with a part animal yeah
[40:09] all right
[40:11] think about that right
[40:13] but then
[40:15] what was Satan's crowning moment
[40:19] when that Beast did what he did it
[40:21] produced a child but
[40:25] that Crown Satan that put him down on
[40:27] the Earth where he could do something
[40:29] he got into Cain and he started working
[40:33] he got it see how that seal it doesn't
[40:35] matter better you can run this thing all
[40:36] the way through look at nimrod Nimrod
[40:40] was a Big King
[40:42] he was a hunter
[40:44] sure he got him a bow and some arrows
[40:46] yeah
[40:48] he started preaching that we're gonna
[40:50] make our way to Heaven by building the
[40:52] building yeah
[40:54] right you see how Satan is we're gonna
[40:56] go right back up to heaven he got cast
[40:58] out so he's wanting to go back
[41:00] pretty good cast out he got cast out
[41:02] down here
[41:04] and then all that ends up into a pope in
[41:07] the end time
[41:08] same seal
[41:10] same devil
[41:11] same white righteous church right all
[41:14] right then what was Judas
[41:16] Judas didn't was not
[41:19] in the pub
[41:22] he was in church
[41:23] white righteous Church
[41:26] the only church there was
[41:28] Judas was a part of it
[41:30] right Keith it was going to church Jesus
[41:33] walked in the Church of the day and said
[41:35] hypocrite
[41:37] yeah child of the devil
[41:40] he was Torn to Pieces so he was the only
[41:43] original Church there was and here's the
[41:45] 12 following it and there was Satan's
[41:47] standing right there in that white
[41:48] righteous Church right
[41:53] but Judas
[41:55] fit the match perfectly
[41:59] he blessed them people into believing
[42:03] that he was a part of that white racist
[42:06] Church
[42:07] so there's the same characteristics
[42:09] right he was a bluff brother then he
[42:10] bluffed it all 11 during the time of the
[42:15] of the Lord's Supper is it me is it me
[42:18] is it me is it me brother Brown said
[42:20] they thought Judas was just going to go
[42:21] out and pay the bill pay the grocery
[42:23] bill
[42:23] he had blessed them so much
[42:26] Satan was so close to that white
[42:29] righteous Church even in that day of the
[42:31] man himself Jesus standing there
[42:33] he had got himself so close
[42:36] and the Bible said Daddy read it this uh
[42:39] Sunday Satan entered in
[42:42] to the heart of Judas yeah and he went
[42:44] and done what he done that was Satan's
[42:46] crowning moment all right so now we're
[42:48] gonna go back and look and I want you to
[42:50] see now that we have the pattern we have
[42:52] a white righteous Church
[42:54] true and false
[42:56] all right Satan's trying to Bluff us we
[42:59] have the sword the word of God but he
[43:01] has a bowl with no arrows right he's
[43:04] blessing he's been a bluff the whole
[43:05] time amen if we understand that we'll
[43:08] understand how to get out of here right
[43:09] all right but when I get into that now
[43:13] and then also there was a crown given a
[43:17] crown means Authority and we always
[43:18] think of a crown and I thought about
[43:20] this and I looked it up and it's true we
[43:23] think of a crown as some big golden
[43:26] extravagant crown
[43:29] you know what a crown really is
[43:32] a crown could be
[43:36] just a wreath
[43:39] placed over your head
[43:41] that's a crown
[43:43] so it doesn't have to be something
[43:44] that's extravagant because you and I are
[43:47] going to be crowned and I looked it up
[43:48] in a strong concordance and when you and
[43:50] I are crowned Kings and Priests
[43:53] that's what it is it's not an extra
[43:54] extrapolate that clown it's a wreath and
[43:57] what does a reef represent peace peace
[44:01] that's what you and I are going to be
[44:03] crowning we're going to be crowned with
[44:04] peace and joy and all those things of
[44:07] God not crowned like this Satan is going
[44:10] to be crowned his Superman is going to
[44:11] be crowned in this end time and he's
[44:13] going to exalt himself exactly
[44:16] he's going to exalt himself above God he
[44:19] said all right so let's go to Second
[44:20] Thessalonians because that's where this
[44:22] man can be
[44:27] described enough that we can
[44:30] at least get a glimpse of what we're
[44:32] dealing with right and I believe you
[44:35] know the Bible
[44:37] the Bible proves it true second
[44:40] Thessalonians 2.
[44:42] that
[44:45] you and I are not going to be exempt
[44:49] from Satan's bluffing or whatever you
[44:52] want to call it but we'll know how to
[44:54] overcome it right amen because you know
[44:56] what even going out conquer and
[44:58] conquering
[45:00] gunkering you and I
[45:01] that's why brother Brandon could preach
[45:03] the mighty conqueror and he could weave
[45:05] that thing right in there where you and
[45:06] I come in and God conquers our our fears
[45:09] and he conquers our our you know like
[45:11] brother Jim paint someone's talking
[45:13] about fear you know that's something we
[45:14] need to conquer and human beings can't
[45:17] conquer fear right
[45:19] it's just imbred in us that we fear
[45:22] all right so who has to do it God has to
[45:24] break that fear God God said I'm not
[45:27] giving you the spirit of fear understand
[45:29] mine remember like like brother Jim was
[45:31] preaching but in second Thessalonians 2
[45:35] verse one now we beseech you Brethren by
[45:37] the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[45:39] by our gathering together unto him
[45:41] remember we sing that song
[45:44] we're gathering together into him that
[45:46] you be not soon shaken in mind now
[45:49] what's Paul doing Paul is telling the
[45:51] people hang on
[45:53] a medicine to shake you
[45:55] because he says that ye be not soon
[45:58] shaken in mine
[46:01] not in body but in mine that you be not
[46:04] shaken
[46:06] or be troubled
[46:08] or can I say fear
[46:12] neither my spirit
[46:14] right nor by word
[46:18] nor by letter exactly
[46:21] as from us as that the day of Christ is
[46:25] at hand
[46:27] let an old man deceive you by any means
[46:31] for that day shall not come
[46:34] what the day of Christ
[46:38] the day of Christ shall not come that's
[46:40] the day that's the only day you and I
[46:41] need to worry about anyway right for
[46:43] that day shall not come except there
[46:45] come a falling away first
[46:48] and that man of sin m-a-n not Spirit man
[46:54] right be revealed
[46:57] are made known
[47:00] the son of perdition
[47:02] oh yeah now there's only one time that
[47:05] this is going to happen in its fullness
[47:10] that's today
[47:11] this is the day of Christ the day of
[47:13] Christ has been since the day of
[47:14] Pentecost right in 1833 but this is the
[47:17] day that in Matthew 24 and about uh up
[47:22] there in the first part of it about four
[47:24] or five Matthew 24 5 he says beware of
[47:27] false Christ
[47:28] right beware they're coming beware if
[47:31] somebody tells you say look beware
[47:33] there's a curvy Road what's she he's
[47:35] telling you it's there right
[47:37] all right so now
[47:39] let's read the rest of this who opposed
[47:41] it and exalt this himself above all that
[47:45] is called God
[47:47] you know I was thinking the other day
[47:50] there's a scripture and that's what I
[47:51] was looking for there's a scripture in
[47:53] here somewhere we may get to it in just
[47:54] a minute we may not I may not be able to
[47:57] find it in my ignorance I probably
[47:58] didn't even write it down
[48:00] but remember the Bible talks about the
[48:02] Holy One of Israel yeah it doesn't say
[48:04] the holy tube Israel the Holy three of
[48:06] the Israel or the holy third person of
[48:08] Israel it says the Holy One right so
[48:11] there's only one guy the Holy One of
[48:13] Israel right so there's only one God but
[48:16] there's somebody that's real close
[48:19] this man right here who opposes an
[48:21] exaltive right himself above above
[48:26] all that's called God right now let's
[48:28] just for an example brother Alice God's
[48:30] right here
[48:31] he wants to be above God
[48:34] you and I want to be God made manifest
[48:36] we don't want to be above God right you
[48:39] see where he wants to be right above all
[48:42] that is called God
[48:45] or
[48:46] that is worshiped right he had to have
[48:49] that in there because he's the worship
[48:50] angel
[48:51] all right
[48:53] so that he has done
[48:56] it in the temple of God there's only one
[49:00] Temple that God ever cared about and
[49:03] that's your heart that's right that's
[49:04] right right not a Stone Temple he told
[49:07] them remember Brenda Claus was preaching
[49:09] they brought him up to this great big
[49:10] Temple and they said oh my
[49:13] oh you're gonna walk in this Temple and
[49:15] you're going to anoint it like it days
[49:16] of Solomon and we're just going to have
[49:18] a big time and he'll turn around and
[49:19] look and he said they want one stone be
[49:21] left on another guy in other words this
[49:23] thing's going to be obliterated and they
[49:25] built it and built the walls and tore
[49:27] them down built the wall that's not even
[49:28] what he's talking about
[49:31] right well Tim God don't want to be in
[49:33] your house
[49:34] physical he wants to be in your house
[49:36] spiritually wants to be in your heart
[49:37] okay so when he says he wants to be in
[49:40] the temple of God that's where he wanted
[49:42] to be
[49:43] with Adam and Eve he wanted to get
[49:45] inside them but he couldn't do it
[49:49] but he got the outside he made it fall
[49:51] he made the outside person fall
[49:54] okay the fall of Man was not in the soul
[49:56] of man Adam and Eve Soul didn't fall
[49:59] but the ability for them to be God on on
[50:03] the face of this Earth was done away
[50:06] with amen or hidden until this end time
[50:08] all right now but now remember it wasn't
[50:11] done away with I'm sorry it was hidden
[50:13] but you can't do away with anything that
[50:14] God says because you and I are going to
[50:16] inherit this Earth in flesh
[50:18] eternally all right so you can't stop
[50:20] that that's going to happen
[50:22] who opposes himself and steps in both
[50:24] anything that's called God or that is
[50:26] worship so that he asked God sits in the
[50:28] temple of God and he doesn't just sit
[50:31] there he's showing himself amen
[50:33] right in other words Brother Anderson
[50:35] he's active
[50:37] he's showing himself
[50:40] foreign
[50:47] not like him
[50:50] he is God in other words he's saying I'm
[50:53] the one you need to worship right
[50:55] Now isn't that what he told Eve
[50:58] if you can't produce this that your God
[51:02] is telling you I'm going to show you how
[51:04] to produce this over here
[51:07] that I'll be the one that tells you
[51:09] remember he's exalting himself above
[51:11] everything exactly all right think about
[51:13] this this is right here people I'm gonna
[51:15] read something Israel Katie's Barnett
[51:17] it's gonna probably shake his shoes off
[51:18] so you might as well go ahead and take
[51:20] him off now remember you're not
[51:31] pause it and now you know right what
[51:34] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[51:37] his time because that falling away is
[51:39] not going to be and let me let me be
[51:40] real plain
[51:42] I know this goes out on the internet but
[51:44] Jesus said fear not little flock right
[51:47] message churches are getting so full
[51:50] they're having to build these great big
[51:52] buildings
[51:53] right
[51:55] that's the falling away that Paul is
[51:58] telling the people to watch out for
[52:01] didn't he tell
[52:04] the women in the scripture that if they
[52:06] commit adultery that they are dead while
[52:09] they are living
[52:14] setting in a message Pew believing the
[52:17] message
[52:18] but have no clue about Christ right no
[52:22] clue about what's going on
[52:24] and not just a message of the hour you
[52:26] know let's think about this this morning
[52:32] tried to say it the right way
[52:35] Christianity
[52:36] actually what I was doing I was reading
[52:38] this book
[52:39] and brother Branham I think it may be
[52:41] either Israel or Cadence Barney or
[52:43] another one I was reading
[52:44] but this morning I was sitting at work
[52:46] and reading about the shunamite woman
[52:48] and then brother Bradham said remember
[52:50] the old black the black girl black lady
[52:52] now brother Brown said she knew God she
[52:56] was a Christian woman
[52:57] and she was just connected to God
[53:00] brother Brown just talked about her and
[53:02] talked about remember the black woman
[53:03] that met him said God where's my Elijah
[53:06] you gave me a child now he's dying to
[53:08] work my Lodge remember God grounded that
[53:10] airplane
[53:12] here's what struck me in this is this is
[53:14] so simple
[53:15] brother Brown said lady have you ever
[53:17] heard of me
[53:18] I'm Reverend William Branham she said no
[53:20] Parson I ain't never heard anything
[53:22] right
[53:24] yeah she was a Christian yeah and she's
[53:28] never heard of brother Brown
[53:31] I think what we've done
[53:34] is we put the message in Christianity
[53:37] they figure in the message you're a
[53:39] Christian
[53:41] I think we need to become a Christian
[53:43] first and then getting a message
[53:45] the problem is we've become message
[53:48] Believers and it's covered all this
[53:50] other stuff right because brother Brown
[53:52] said the problem and this first seal the
[53:54] problem is that mystery of iniquity
[53:59] we're going to read it in just a minute
[54:01] all that underlying sin and brother
[54:03] round just like brother Dale said last
[54:05] Sunday that underlying sin is not I hope
[54:08] we're away from smoking and drinking and
[54:09] cussing and running around if you're
[54:11] still doing that you're lost let me just
[54:12] look at you and tell you if you keep
[54:14] doing that you're lost right right you
[54:17] smoke you drink you curse you run around
[54:19] you do the things that you used to do
[54:21] you're lost right right you don't come
[54:23] to church like you should you're lost
[54:24] right anybody understand that amen
[54:27] you're lost
[54:30] you just lost I wish somebody could say
[54:33] you know told me one day said look
[54:35] you're lost
[54:38] but I came in my time I should have come
[54:40] right that's why that uh
[54:43] I know sometimes mom gets on to me for
[54:46] not
[54:47] being a little hard trying to get my
[54:49] kids but you know what it didn't help me
[54:51] a bit either mom
[54:52] she talked to me about the Lord you know
[54:54] all the time and Dad just sat there you
[54:55] know and he's shaking his head knowing
[54:57] that I was coming but you know still you
[54:59] had to have that little motivator in
[55:00] there you know and and I just kind of
[55:03] I can't save them I can't save my kid
[55:06] you can't save your kids but you can
[55:09] pray for him all right you can do like
[55:11] rather brand upstairs if you enter in he
[55:14] said that's high that people get healed
[55:16] I enter into what they're he said
[55:18] they're humans remember he told about
[55:20] talked about the man that that said I'm
[55:22] gonna kill you remember the big guy
[55:23] that's going to kill him in Oregon big
[55:25] tall guy he said he could do it
[55:28] he said but I love that man so much he
[55:30] said God that man's got a family
[55:32] that man's got children and if he wasn't
[55:34] possessed he would be fine and when that
[55:37] love projected
[55:39] Grace took over and that man fell in his
[55:42] feet so maybe what we need to do is is
[55:45] when all of our family is all riled up
[55:47] just do the same thing say God if it
[55:50] wasn't the only difference in you in the
[55:52] center is is you got God in your life
[55:53] right
[55:55] that's the only difference right that's
[55:57] what I'm saying about this right here
[55:58] the only difference between God and the
[56:00] devil is that God can get in your soul
[56:02] and change you and Satan perverts you he
[56:06] can't make your soul God makes your soul
[56:10] but Satan perverts your soul right it
[56:12] lays right in there so close but the
[56:14] choice is yours to get that thing off of
[56:16] you or leave it on you right throughout
[56:18] the day of judgment God's going to say I
[56:20] created you perfect
[56:24] I created you perfectly man exactly
[56:27] Judas
[56:29] I created you perfect Adolf Hitler right
[56:32] but you let Satan
[56:34] pervert right what I gave you
[56:39] kind of simple to me right
[56:42] getting off the subject a little bit
[56:44] second Thessalonians let's get back
[56:46] remember you now that when I was yet
[56:48] with you I told you these things and now
[56:50] you know what would hold it what is it
[56:57] what's withholding right it's got to be
[56:59] a fallen away first
[57:01] not falling away of people leaving the
[57:03] church and that's going to happen when
[57:05] that mixed multitude went to Cadence
[57:07] barnia many of the separation
[57:10] dogs that separate yourselves right you
[57:13] all gonna go through the Wilderness you
[57:15] all gonna die but Joshua and Caleb were
[57:17] still in that group right and those
[57:19] young boys and all girls that were born
[57:21] during that time were still in that
[57:22] group right and God said you're going to
[57:24] make it but you're not right it was a
[57:26] dividing time brother Graham said they
[57:27] made their choice that Katie's burned in
[57:29] all right
[57:31] same way with you and I the dog's gonna
[57:33] let us go on and on and on and on and on
[57:35] they sin ten times we send probably 10
[57:38] 000 but one day he's going to say all
[57:39] right that's enough you even make the
[57:41] choice today right
[57:43] are you your plate will be sealed all
[57:45] right listen
[57:46] and now you know what withhold is that
[57:48] he might be revealed in his time
[57:51] for the mystery of iniquity does already
[57:53] work
[57:55] only he who now let us will let until he
[57:59] be taken out of the way
[58:01] now to save time I don't want to be too
[58:04] long tonight we're going to if you'll go
[58:06] to page 116 of the seal book
[58:09] I told him down to Sunday school class I
[58:11] said only a prophet
[58:13] right could interpret that scripture
[58:16] right there amen that had to be God
[58:19] interpreting that scripture let's read
[58:21] it let's read it like a that's really
[58:23] not me and you would read it yeah but
[58:24] the mystery of iniquity is always
[58:25] already worked only he who this man of
[58:28] sin
[58:29] we'll let it now let it will land until
[58:33] he be taken out of the way he he who do
[58:35] you want to dismantle sin he's probably
[58:36] talking about he's talking about this
[58:37] man I'm saying amen
[58:39] but a prophet comes along and gives us
[58:42] the mystery
[58:44] the mystery is that only he God
[58:49] this is your Prophet we must believe
[58:51] what he said amen because that he is not
[58:53] capital
[58:55] his head right it's even hidden remember
[58:59] what you preached about the he the the
[59:01] capitals and all God even hid that from
[59:04] the scholars right
[59:06] so that it can be revealed in the end
[59:08] time by a little Prophet do only he
[59:12] god brother Brown said who now let it
[59:14] will let in other words God is going to
[59:16] let this thing why didn't God just when
[59:18] when Satan did what he did before the
[59:21] before he even creating anything why
[59:23] didn't God just say
[59:26] Satan don't do away with it destroy him
[59:29] he spoke him into his Essence he surely
[59:31] can speak him out right but I told the
[59:34] Sunday school class
[59:36] you ever thought about this
[59:38] God
[59:40] there's a gentleman oh yeah
[59:43] brother Brown said the Holy Ghost was a
[59:44] timid person right
[59:48] and you go back to the law of God and
[59:50] the law of God is in a mouth of two or
[59:52] three Witnesses let everything he didn't
[59:55] say he didn't make stipulation he said
[59:57] let everything be established in the
[1:00:00] mouth of two or three Witnesses isn't
[1:00:03] that correct right that's what the Bible
[1:00:04] says
[1:00:06] God allowed this to happen
[1:00:11] to prove to Satan
[1:00:13] that he could do what he said he was
[1:00:15] going to do
[1:00:17] between me and you that
[1:00:21] ought to make us so humble right
[1:00:23] glorious so
[1:00:25] because here you've got the two most
[1:00:27] powerful people in the world
[1:00:29] that's ever been God
[1:00:32] and the devil
[1:00:34] and to God's look and God's looking at
[1:00:36] Satan and going
[1:00:39] to see them
[1:00:41] you did what you were going to do
[1:00:45] you perverted what I built
[1:00:48] but look at them
[1:00:50] in the mouth of two or three Witnesses
[1:00:53] God
[1:00:55] and us that's two are going to witness
[1:00:58] against that one man Satan
[1:01:01] that he can do what he said he was going
[1:01:03] to do because it said right there it
[1:01:04] said he who let it will let
[1:01:07] until he
[1:01:09] brother Brown said he he said Christ
[1:01:13] the bride amen be taken out of the way
[1:01:17] now we're always taught that the Bride
[1:01:20] is a sheep
[1:01:22] but then we had a little Prophet putting
[1:01:24] quotes together here we have a little
[1:01:25] Prophet that says now she is him
[1:01:33] how God put that mystery right there
[1:01:36] that one script that ought to make us
[1:01:38] just
[1:01:40] blow Fusion
[1:01:43] for the mystery of iniquity does already
[1:01:46] work
[1:01:48] Paul said this is what's going to happen
[1:01:50] what's this
[1:01:52] only he who now let us will let
[1:01:56] God is letting this thing run out for us
[1:01:59] until you and I be taken out of the way
[1:02:02] all right
[1:02:03] and then
[1:02:05] shall that Wicked be revealed
[1:02:08] whom the Lord shall consume with the
[1:02:11] spirit of his mouth
[1:02:13] who are we we're the final voice
[1:02:16] to the final age he's going to do it
[1:02:18] through you and I this is how he's going
[1:02:19] to do it exactly this is how he's going
[1:02:21] to do it he's laying the whole plan
[1:02:24] right here and he's telling us how to do
[1:02:25] it
[1:02:26] right and then shall that Wicked be
[1:02:29] revealed now if somebody asked a
[1:02:31] question downstairs why is that Wicked
[1:02:33] capital on that one well that's not a
[1:02:35] mystery anymore we know who that one is
[1:02:37] all right it's the wicked one all right
[1:02:41] that's how God writes his word we just
[1:02:44] have to go by it Glory we could be
[1:02:46] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[1:02:48] with the spirit of his mouth and shall
[1:02:50] destroy with the brightness of his
[1:02:52] coming amen now if you'll go over to
[1:02:55] about Isaiah 30
[1:02:58] we know that in the end time that the
[1:03:00] light of the Moon the light of the Sun
[1:03:02] is going to be seven times brighter in
[1:03:04] the end time and the moon's going to be
[1:03:05] the same light as the sun remember when
[1:03:07] the scripture we're about where the
[1:03:08] towers fall but in the end time let's
[1:03:11] read it I know somebody look at me like
[1:03:12] I'm crazy but let's read it let's just
[1:03:15] settle it
[1:03:17] Isaiah 30.
[1:03:20] I believe it is yes Isaiah 30 right and
[1:03:24] 25. listen to this and there shall be
[1:03:26] upon every high mountain and upon every
[1:03:28] High Hill rivers and streams of water
[1:03:30] and the day of the great Slaughter when
[1:03:33] the towers fall right 9 11. all right
[1:03:37] moreover the light of the moon shall be
[1:03:40] as the light of the Sun
[1:03:43] and the light of the sun shall be
[1:03:45] Sevenfold amen
[1:03:47] as the light of seven days
[1:03:50] in the day that the Lord bindeth up the
[1:03:52] breach
[1:03:54] where we've been hearing about a breach
[1:03:56] I've been away since five
[1:03:57] he's going to bind up the breach of his
[1:04:00] people and heal the stroke of their
[1:04:02] wound that only one wound people and
[1:04:04] that's death
[1:04:07] you say oh cancer no what does it take
[1:04:10] you to
[1:04:11] if it continues in its track it takes
[1:04:13] you to death
[1:04:14] there's only one thing to be destroyed
[1:04:16] and that's death not cancer not stroke
[1:04:18] not heart attacks is on one thing to be
[1:04:20] destroyed that's death amen all right
[1:04:22] healed and a stroke of their womb so you
[1:04:25] see now that the light of the moon now
[1:04:28] the Moon is a type of who the bride
[1:04:29] right the light of the moon shall be as
[1:04:32] the light of the sun and the light of
[1:04:33] the Sun is going to be seven times
[1:04:34] brighter amen so we're going to destroy
[1:04:37] him with seven times the brightness of
[1:04:39] his coming because who is his coming you
[1:04:41] and I are is coming all right the coming
[1:04:43] of the Lord is right here there's not a
[1:04:45] physical coming of the Lord to you and
[1:04:48] me
[1:04:49] physical body
[1:04:52] man standing here he's going to be
[1:04:54] inside of you and me right yeah
[1:04:57] and shall destroy with the brightness of
[1:04:59] his coming even him whose coming is
[1:05:01] after the working of Satan and that s is
[1:05:04] capital two there with all power and
[1:05:07] signs away wonders and with all
[1:05:09] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[1:05:12] them that perish because they received
[1:05:14] not now listen I'm reading this to the
[1:05:16] people downstairs and some of them some
[1:05:18] of them caught this right
[1:05:20] because they didn't let me read it like
[1:05:23] this let's just bring it up today
[1:05:25] because they received
[1:05:28] the message
[1:05:31] but not the love of the message
[1:05:34] the Bible says because they receive not
[1:05:36] he didn't say they didn't receive the
[1:05:38] truth
[1:05:40] read it look down and win your own eyes
[1:05:42] and look at it they didn't receive it
[1:05:45] says because they received not the love
[1:05:49] of the truth right he didn't say they
[1:05:52] didn't receive the truth they got the
[1:05:53] truth but they didn't receive the love
[1:05:56] of the truth
[1:05:57] that they might be saved because if you
[1:06:00] receive the love of the truth you will
[1:06:01] be saved right that is the love of God
[1:06:03] and for this cause God shall send them
[1:06:07] the church
[1:06:08] strong delusion that they should believe
[1:06:10] a lie now you know the prophet said that
[1:06:12] should be the light right the one he
[1:06:14] told Eve now he'll go right back to the
[1:06:16] Garden that they all might be down who
[1:06:18] believed not the truth but had pleasure
[1:06:23] in unrighteousness now look
[1:06:27] we won't read the sailboat just for time
[1:06:28] will
[1:06:31] kind of wind us down this is I'm going
[1:06:33] to bring it all together now second
[1:06:36] Thessalonians Paul is prophesying he
[1:06:38] sees the starting of this in his age
[1:06:40] right
[1:06:42] because what this is was is that day of
[1:06:44] Christ when he starts talking about the
[1:06:46] day of Christ I can see Paul just
[1:06:47] preaching about the day of crisis at
[1:06:49] hand because that's what he says in
[1:06:50] verse two as that the day of Christ is
[1:06:52] at hand
[1:06:54] and everybody like brothers did
[1:06:55] everybody thought well the Lord's coming
[1:06:58] in Paul's age
[1:06:59] but Paul said no let no man deceive you
[1:07:01] by any means for that day shall not come
[1:07:03] until there be a falling away first in
[1:07:05] other words it's not going to happen in
[1:07:06] my age exactly there's going to be a
[1:07:08] great Falling Away not not the fourth
[1:07:10] age when they got killed that's not a
[1:07:11] falling away the great falling away is
[1:07:13] when you're setting a message to you and
[1:07:15] dry up and blow away all right
[1:07:18] that man of sin be revealed
[1:07:21] a son of perdition and I wrote in my
[1:07:23] Bible the only way you can be revealed
[1:07:25] is by the message of the hour right
[1:07:27] that's the only way he'll be revealed by
[1:07:29] the message of the hour all right
[1:07:30] because now look
[1:07:32] now we're going to finish up
[1:07:35] them the same way that we began
[1:07:38] because the way we began was what white
[1:07:42] a bluff White Horse white righteous
[1:07:45] Church a bluff meant a bowl with no
[1:07:47] error
[1:07:49] and a crown was given all right so now
[1:07:53] that was what started it
[1:07:56] and what's going to end up we know it's
[1:07:58] a Pale Horse but like I said before
[1:08:00] inside that Pale Horse it's still that
[1:08:03] white guy in that white horse
[1:08:04] and why horses riding all right brother
[1:08:07] Ramsey he said he just gets off that
[1:08:09] horse and gets on another horse but the
[1:08:11] horse just keeps going what there's the
[1:08:13] power and that power got in the people
[1:08:15] and the power got into people they
[1:08:17] didn't get out of them it stayed in them
[1:08:19] right all right unless they did what
[1:08:22] confess their sin right
[1:08:24] and become filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:08:26] right that's the only way that you drive
[1:08:28] that white
[1:08:29] that white horse away from me it's like
[1:08:32] what brother Brown you know like like he
[1:08:33] would say here stands a lamb well
[1:08:35] brothers and sisters the lamb is the
[1:08:37] Holy Ghost remember he said the lamb
[1:08:38] Christ and the Holy Ghost is a
[1:08:40] self-saint person so there stood the
[1:08:42] lamb Christ the Holy Ghost there was no
[1:08:44] way for that white righteous looking
[1:08:47] horse to ride into that profit it had to
[1:08:51] right away from me all right
[1:08:54] now you say oh that's good for a prophet
[1:08:56] what about me and you
[1:08:59] what about me and you people
[1:09:01] because the seals are for Redemption of
[1:09:03] the body
[1:09:04] right
[1:09:06] we've got to see that that man of sin
[1:09:10] doesn't have his greasy fingers on it
[1:09:12] right that's right okay
[1:09:15] because as long as he lets you yeah I
[1:09:17] think lydie's got a whole
[1:09:19] guess where it starts right here all
[1:09:22] right look Satan changes from white to
[1:09:25] Red to Black to pale but God never
[1:09:27] changes he started as a white church
[1:09:30] he's going to end as a white church he
[1:09:32] started on a wild horse he's going to
[1:09:33] end in on a lot more he's gonna have his
[1:09:36] subjects with him but God never changes
[1:09:39] he's going to have a church but tonight
[1:09:41] guess what's happening tonight
[1:09:45] two hundred thousand thousand demons
[1:09:49] are riding on those horses
[1:09:51] exactly right through this building
[1:09:53] tonight right
[1:09:54] right through this building sure because
[1:09:56] they're not out there riding they're not
[1:09:59] out there in Buicks and Cadillacs
[1:10:00] they're in they're right where the bride
[1:10:02] is riding right along beside of them
[1:10:05] right right here with us all right I'll
[1:10:09] read you something in just a minute
[1:10:12] but remember this mystery of iniquity
[1:10:16] is not remember iniquity is a hideous
[1:10:20] sin but it's not what you think it is
[1:10:22] it's not being a pervert or something
[1:10:24] like that that's not a hideous sin to
[1:10:26] God
[1:10:27] I want to read to you in Israel that
[1:10:28] Katie sparnia
[1:10:33] on page 11 paragraph 54. do you see it
[1:10:36] what am I trying to get it that get at
[1:10:39] is get at is this
[1:10:42] the greatest sin I find in the church
[1:10:44] today is unbelief right that's the only
[1:10:47] sin there is there's no other sin
[1:10:50] but unbelief he said
[1:10:52] how much of that is not out there how
[1:10:54] much is dark you couldn't say this much
[1:10:56] is dark right from my hands it's all
[1:10:59] dark
[1:11:00] now there's only one way to designate
[1:11:02] and determine sin it isn't whether you
[1:11:03] drink or whether you smoke or gamble
[1:11:05] it's it's designated this way because
[1:11:08] you're an unbeliever
[1:11:10] is because you do that all right listen
[1:11:19] now this is your profit page 13
[1:11:21] paragraph 64.
[1:11:23] now I want you to know that when the
[1:11:25] phenomenon was done Miracles were before
[1:11:27] signing wonders and when they went out
[1:11:30] it's multitude one out a mixed group of
[1:11:33] people
[1:11:34] play a horse next
[1:11:36] Pale Horse is a mixed group okay and
[1:11:40] some white some red some black
[1:11:44] they make a pale
[1:11:46] some of them Believers some pretending
[1:11:48] to believe the great Miracles had been
[1:11:50] done people went out and they thought
[1:11:51] about israelit case fournette people
[1:11:53] went out as professed Believers and they
[1:11:55] were not Believers and that's where a
[1:11:57] great bunch of our trouble lays today we
[1:12:00] could put our finger on it
[1:12:03] is men and women who come into church
[1:12:05] and prevent profess to be Believers and
[1:12:07] they're not Believers I found it in the
[1:12:10] pulpit
[1:12:11] so we're not exempt
[1:12:14] I found it in the prayer line
[1:12:16] I found it everywhere where men come in
[1:12:18] and women and say I am a believer and
[1:12:20] profess to be a believer oh yeah and
[1:12:23] they're not right amen
[1:12:26] paragraph 70. you who profess
[1:12:28] Christianity you who live in your
[1:12:30] churches you have no memory we have no
[1:12:32] members here you just come here you
[1:12:34] belong to all different churches are you
[1:12:36] people who profess to be Christians and
[1:12:37] then live something else like that
[1:12:39] you're not you're a detriment to the
[1:12:41] Society of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:12:44] you who profess profess to be Christians
[1:12:46] and are ashamed to take him at his word
[1:12:48] or testify to his power and Glory many
[1:12:50] times you're a detriment to the name of
[1:12:52] the Lord Jesus Christ amen that's true
[1:12:55] that's right stand to the word sink her
[1:12:57] down stand on his word right he was
[1:13:01] actually preaching this in
[1:13:02] Jeffersonville
[1:13:04] he wasn't preaching this somewhere else
[1:13:05] he was preaching to his own people all
[1:13:07] right
[1:13:09] one more I think nope and that one's it
[1:13:11] no I got one more
[1:13:15] Negative they begin to murmur and
[1:13:17] complain and finally they brought to
[1:13:19] kadish and when they come to cadish this
[1:13:21] judgment seat now all the whole thing
[1:13:23] was gathered together and some glorious
[1:13:25] day and I believe that day is at hand
[1:13:27] right now when there will be a
[1:13:29] separation between the right
[1:13:32] and Rome amen what's going to happen is
[1:13:36] you got that white righteous church
[1:13:38] still riding
[1:13:41] white pure righteous right all right
[1:13:46] then you've got the true
[1:13:50] there always is the truth okay right
[1:13:53] okay and then they copy after them all
[1:13:56] right
[1:13:57] well watch
[1:13:59] it started with the white righteous
[1:14:01] church it's going to end with a real
[1:14:03] righteous Church
[1:14:05] don't be don't be fooled by this this
[1:14:08] you say well this seal is is telling us
[1:14:10] who's the Antichrist is no I believe
[1:14:13] it's telling us who we are glory and
[1:14:15] it's showing us that the opposition is
[1:14:18] exposing who he is it's telling us hey
[1:14:21] I've got problems in my life I'm not
[1:14:24] living the way I ought to live because
[1:14:25] that white righteous church is not out
[1:14:27] there it's right here
[1:14:29] it's close
[1:14:32] it's not out there
[1:14:38] and when you hear a false Doctrine
[1:14:40] what does that do right that bless you
[1:14:43] Satan is bluffing you into believing
[1:14:46] that that has power in it
[1:14:49] look at all these people going around
[1:14:50] the country preaching these false
[1:14:52] doctrines look at the power behind them
[1:14:54] people just Revel in it they just love
[1:14:56] the inmates it just be uh I mean my Lord
[1:14:59] somebody come out and preach that that
[1:15:01] polygamy was the seventh seal and and
[1:15:04] all these things that they're preaching
[1:15:06] I promise you one thing they're blessing
[1:15:08] something somebody's following it
[1:15:10] they're bluffing some sister at them
[1:15:12] because I'm just contending with one and
[1:15:14] that's about it
[1:15:16] one wife I mean
[1:15:21] not two or three that'd have to be a
[1:15:23] real Revelation yeah but I needed two or
[1:15:26] three no but you see that you see now
[1:15:28] how Satan know it's come right into the
[1:15:30] church and just Twisted just a little
[1:15:32] bit of it
[1:15:33] and put the put that thought and
[1:15:35] bluffing them people into believing that
[1:15:37] that he said believe a lie
[1:15:39] and be down by it you remember what we
[1:15:41] just read believe alike that's where
[1:15:43] that man of sin is setting people he's
[1:15:45] not setting in a denominational church
[1:15:47] right he's sitting in the church right
[1:15:49] here our church this church this
[1:15:52] building this temple of God right he's
[1:15:54] so close
[1:15:56] he said it would even try to deceive the
[1:15:58] very elect it would be so close right
[1:15:59] all right
[1:16:01] but we're starting here
[1:16:04] and we watch this Pope
[1:16:08] come over here and become incarnate
[1:16:10] Satan
[1:16:11] right after
[1:16:14] we become incarnate God right
[1:16:17] because Satan that's that see let me
[1:16:20] tell you something let me just give you
[1:16:21] a little something to go on this
[1:16:22] afternoon this evening
[1:16:24] Satan is watching me and you oh yeah
[1:16:28] right
[1:16:30] he knows for a fact
[1:16:33] that he can't get into God's mind
[1:16:36] but he didn't get into yours
[1:16:39] you can't get into that Mind Of God he
[1:16:41] cannot do that it's good to be born
[1:16:43] again he can understand all the mystery
[1:16:46] but he's watching and remember he's
[1:16:48] copying behind everything that that have
[1:16:50] that God does he's copying right behind
[1:16:52] it
[1:16:54] and he's watching me and you he does not
[1:16:56] know how to Incarnate human flesh
[1:16:59] yet
[1:17:01] but when God comes down and incarnates
[1:17:04] me and you and we take a body change and
[1:17:06] get out of here and say brother Brown
[1:17:08] said we go up Satan comes down right why
[1:17:10] does he come down because he can't stand
[1:17:12] being up there anymore he's going to
[1:17:13] come down here
[1:17:15] because he's working right in here on us
[1:17:17] right now but when we take a body change
[1:17:18] don't you think when we take a body
[1:17:20] chain we're gonna have a problem with
[1:17:21] this guy because this is going to be
[1:17:23] Pauline said let us have a mind of
[1:17:24] Christ now
[1:17:26] what about having a mind of Christ when
[1:17:27] we take a body chain because we'll have
[1:17:29] a body like into his glorious body it's
[1:17:31] not going to be that I'm gonna have a
[1:17:32] brain that thinks bad thoughts no we're
[1:17:35] going to be incarnate God right Satan's
[1:17:38] going to come down and be incarnate
[1:17:39] Satan showing himself that he is gone
[1:17:42] having signs and wonders just think
[1:17:44] about what's going to happen when that
[1:17:46] Pope is just totally incarnate when you
[1:17:49] get a man look what he does to a man now
[1:17:51] that he just anoints yeah look what he
[1:17:54] does to people that he just anoints the
[1:17:56] Hideous things that they do think about
[1:17:58] what he's going to do when he has
[1:17:59] complete control man right
[1:18:01] over a human man
[1:18:03] that thinks that he's still religious
[1:18:07] Apex
[1:18:09] and he's going to just rule the whole
[1:18:11] world yeah
[1:18:13] but you know what
[1:18:15] that baby form of that man is working on
[1:18:17] me and you right now right
[1:18:20] that baby form he always starts as a
[1:18:23] baby and he's working on us telling us
[1:18:26] things telling us all these things that
[1:18:27] we should do and shouldn't do
[1:18:29] all right
[1:18:30] so now
[1:18:32] in the end the only way that man of sin
[1:18:35] is to be revealed brother Mark is for
[1:18:37] him to be out there right
[1:18:40] just like we said right here he's
[1:18:42] showing himself to be asked God sitting
[1:18:43] in a temple of God showing himself
[1:18:45] sitting in the temple of God
[1:18:48] but brother Lord when that when that
[1:18:49] when that man of sin goes out
[1:18:54] he can be revealed or shown oh yeah and
[1:18:58] then we can understand and that's what's
[1:18:59] happening now with the message I believe
[1:19:00] now we're understanding more
[1:19:03] not more of
[1:19:05] of the devil
[1:19:07] but once we know more of God right it
[1:19:11] exposes the vice versa of what of what
[1:19:14] the devil is
[1:19:16] it because I know one thing's for sure
[1:19:17] if the Bible tells us that we need to be
[1:19:19] in church every service when the door is
[1:19:21] open and I do the vice versa you know
[1:19:23] what I'm listening to
[1:19:26] and more so the Bible says you need to
[1:19:28] be here that's what they approaches
[1:19:31] okay
[1:19:34] same way with the word of God
[1:19:36] should we be doing this over here
[1:19:39] if it's contrary to what the word says
[1:19:43] you want to know one thing's for sure
[1:19:44] that's that's why that that I don't
[1:19:47] believe in sinless Perfection but I
[1:19:48] believe one thing's for sure
[1:19:50] if you sin you know it real quick right
[1:19:53] that's right amen and you you ask
[1:19:56] forgiveness
[1:19:57] but see when you were a sinner what did
[1:20:00] you do you just sinned
[1:20:01] you just did it wow because it was a
[1:20:04] part of the nature that you had there
[1:20:06] was no yeah sure you had a convention
[1:20:08] but you just kind of passed it off
[1:20:10] but now if your sin is a Christian you
[1:20:12] want to get that thing out quick amen
[1:20:15] well you want that thing to ride away
[1:20:16] from you why because something's been
[1:20:18] made known to you this word of God has
[1:20:19] made something known to you clicking
[1:20:21] something in your heart every Sunday we
[1:20:23] sit here listen we ought to know that
[1:20:24] something's quicker than something man
[1:20:26] boiling up inside of our heart
[1:20:29] and not sat there and say well I've
[1:20:31] heard that 25 times
[1:20:33] it should not be that way people
[1:20:36] right right
[1:20:39] so the Alpha and Omega
[1:20:42] that first seal
[1:20:43] we know it shows one trillion Living God
[1:20:45] we know that man we're going to try to
[1:20:46] just stay on this one the the mystery of
[1:20:48] iniquity the mystery that man of sin
[1:20:51] knowing that he's going to do this he's
[1:20:54] going to start right here
[1:20:55] and he's going to end right here right
[1:20:57] but God started right here with the
[1:20:59] church on the day of Pentecost and he's
[1:21:00] going to end right here with the church
[1:21:02] just like the one on the death Pentecost
[1:21:03] but this church right here
[1:21:06] let me just be honest this church right
[1:21:09] here didn't have that mystery
[1:21:11] of iniquity right
[1:21:14] and be able to name that man out of the
[1:21:16] word of God like you are glory in time
[1:21:19] that's right everybody understand that's
[1:21:21] the difference that's why they didn't
[1:21:22] take a body change right
[1:21:24] call that land of sin was not revealed
[1:21:26] to them right he was still working in
[1:21:29] what in these people
[1:21:33] Paul
[1:21:34] Lord he comes up to a church and and the
[1:21:37] church has got a a man living with his
[1:21:40] mother-in-law and
[1:21:41] and in the book of Corinthians and they
[1:21:43] all messed up what Satan got in there
[1:21:46] and just started weaving his web right
[1:21:48] right in amongst the Christian people
[1:21:49] right okay the Christian people this
[1:21:52] book is written to Christian people man
[1:21:54] right all right this book this book is
[1:21:55] written to Christian people they're not
[1:21:57] written to unbelievers it's written to
[1:21:58] True Believer and the things they didn't
[1:22:00] hear you sometimes you scratch your head
[1:22:02] and wonder how it happened but
[1:22:04] that's what the grace of God takes over
[1:22:06] but that's where that God knew that this
[1:22:09] out
[1:22:09] bride
[1:22:11] the only problem they had was is they
[1:22:14] fell away from their first love remember
[1:22:15] that's what he says in the scripture
[1:22:17] these fell away from their first love if
[1:22:19] you and I fall away from this love on
[1:22:20] this side there's no other age there's
[1:22:23] nothing else to pick you up people right
[1:22:26] there was an age over here that started
[1:22:28] in Paul Grievous wolves came in then
[1:22:31] ireneas came in and picked that word up
[1:22:33] and challenged the people to believe
[1:22:35] again what something picked back up
[1:22:37] right that's the way it happened
[1:22:38] remember in the church ages they come
[1:22:40] when brother Brown said when when the
[1:22:42] age would start going toward the end
[1:22:43] they start falling down God had raised
[1:22:45] up a quarter a man to stand in between
[1:22:47] and say hey you've Fallen away from your
[1:22:49] first love get back in line right
[1:22:53] there's no other age
[1:22:56] there's no other time
[1:22:59] this is the day of Christ people it says
[1:23:03] here the day of Christ is at hand
[1:23:05] we're not changing this scripture but
[1:23:07] I'm telling you the day of Christ is
[1:23:08] here amen during this time of Paul's
[1:23:11] time yes it's absolutely was at hand it
[1:23:13] was coming right
[1:23:15] right Paul was prophesying of a day
[1:23:17] coming that you and I
[1:23:19] would be sitting here it's like I said
[1:23:22] musicians come so like I said when we
[1:23:24] were reading
[1:23:25] a little bit through the seal book
[1:23:28] brother Branham gets over to the
[1:23:31] um
[1:23:32] questions and answers
[1:23:34] and he tells him he said this is all
[1:23:36] gone from you I was hoping you'd catch
[1:23:37] something all during the week right he
[1:23:39] said this is all gone from you he said
[1:23:41] in other words he said well he did say
[1:23:43] it in his words he said it's going from
[1:23:45] you and there's no way for you to get it
[1:23:47] right
[1:23:48] now I told him in the same school class
[1:23:50] I said God was speaking through brother
[1:23:52] Branham
[1:23:53] telling those people what did he tell
[1:23:56] him he didn't say hey you're all lost
[1:23:57] you're going to hell no he said live a
[1:24:00] good simple Christian Life
[1:24:02] he said go on as you you know in other
[1:24:04] words he was telling him about like he
[1:24:05] did marriage and divorce go on as you
[1:24:06] are live a good simple Christian Life
[1:24:09] God's Made A Way
[1:24:11] well the way for those people was a
[1:24:13] grave because they didn't catch what was
[1:24:15] going on brother Brown said I wished you
[1:24:17] were those hope someone would raise up
[1:24:19] and say I see what was going on but
[1:24:21] nobody did right so he said hey
[1:24:24] in other words he said this is for
[1:24:27] another group of people right
[1:24:29] and then he went into the talking about
[1:24:32] radio and in the old cars now they have
[1:24:35] transitioned I mean they have the
[1:24:37] motherboards and computers and all that
[1:24:39] back when brother Brandon was alive in
[1:24:40] the 60s
[1:24:42] the old radio dials there was actually a
[1:24:45] diamond crystal inside that radio
[1:24:48] and when that signal would come in it
[1:24:50] had to be cut a certain way it was a
[1:24:52] little tiny but there was that's why you
[1:24:53] had megahertz and things like that that
[1:24:56] radio wave would come into that radio
[1:24:58] and when you turn that down what you
[1:25:00] were doing you were turning the dial the
[1:25:03] transistor you were turning the dial I
[1:25:05] wish Aaron well here he could tell you
[1:25:06] what was going but you turn that dial
[1:25:08] over to this diamond and that's where
[1:25:10] you picked up 55.5 which is a station
[1:25:13] here in town then you'd roll that down a
[1:25:16] little bit further well there was
[1:25:17] another Crystal over here on this side
[1:25:19] that was cut a little different way
[1:25:21] and you can pick up am 600 or 650 or 660
[1:25:26] or 1200. never understand that's how the
[1:25:28] old radio used to be right now you got
[1:25:30] all these you know that wouldn't be a
[1:25:32] type but brother Brown was saying look
[1:25:34] he said there's radio waves going
[1:25:36] through this room right
[1:25:38] yeah and he said if you have the right
[1:25:41] receptor
[1:25:43] in other words if you can get it to the
[1:25:44] right Channel
[1:25:46] am 55 will drop right down on that radio
[1:25:48] and start playing the music or if you
[1:25:51] turned it out a little bit further to
[1:25:53] 660 that's a sports channel now you get
[1:25:55] Sports
[1:25:56] everybody understand what I'm saying
[1:25:58] brother Brown was telling those people
[1:26:02] he said the right Diamond's not here yet
[1:26:03] yeah
[1:26:05] in other words the right station
[1:26:07] God's got you dialed in you're a
[1:26:09] Christian you're born again you're going
[1:26:11] to make it to Heaven Brother Gary
[1:26:12] everything's all right he said but what
[1:26:14] I'm preaching to you
[1:26:17] is not on your radio dial it's not on
[1:26:20] your frequency but there's got to be a
[1:26:23] but for him to be able to speak it God
[1:26:25] said I'll throw it out there and it will
[1:26:27] not return void
[1:26:29] God just went right on in about 40
[1:26:32] something years later he just turned it
[1:26:33] down
[1:26:34] and he found the right diamond right me
[1:26:37] and you last night
[1:26:44] amen yeah
[1:27:22] get Matthew
[1:27:56] the radio away
[1:27:59] wave getting it it's going from you
[1:28:01] there's no way in the world
[1:28:03] Bible in front of my head I know what it
[1:28:05] is it's been told you before right so
[1:28:07] just don't try to put any interpretation
[1:28:09] but just believe me as your brother
[1:28:11] we're living in a great hour we're
[1:28:13] living in a Time now you just be real
[1:28:15] humble be a Christian and try to try to
[1:28:17] find
[1:28:20] you then he goes on and he explains
[1:28:25] I'm not ready
[1:28:27] why would you explain to my radio yeah
[1:28:29] why don't you explain about things going
[1:28:31] through right going through the
[1:28:33] Tabernacle
[1:28:34] what was going through the Tabernacle
[1:28:36] the word of God was going into
[1:28:37] Tabernacle he just wasn't falling on
[1:28:39] them yet amen but it did return void it
[1:28:43] accomplished one day a group of people
[1:28:46] right stay standing here in in this
[1:28:48] church in this time and this day of the
[1:28:51] Lord
[1:28:55] now it's gonna flip over one day and
[1:28:58] you're gonna catch right you're apart
[1:29:01] because we're all diamonds right but
[1:29:04] we're all cut just a little bit
[1:29:05] different way
[1:29:06] but when that radio wave comes down
[1:29:10] you know what you're going to say one
[1:29:11] day I see it amen nobody in that church
[1:29:14] could stand up and say I see it right
[1:29:18] man hey you and I can stand up and say I
[1:29:21] see it amen I see
[1:29:24] the end of all things exactly because
[1:29:27] the seventh seal that's what it is and
[1:29:29] that's what takes that first seal and
[1:29:31] shows the first seal that first seal you
[1:29:33] just like I said you can take that first
[1:29:34] seal and none of the other ones
[1:29:36] and prove that God
[1:29:39] is going to do what he said he's going
[1:29:41] to do amen because if that man of sin is
[1:29:43] revealed that means he has gone away
[1:29:46] from you
[1:29:47] and you can take a body change Glory
[1:29:50] that's why that Seal's important people
[1:29:52] that first seal is important we're going
[1:29:54] to spend a lot of time downstairs we
[1:29:56] haven't got into all that we need to get
[1:29:57] into we didn't tonight I just want you
[1:29:59] to to kind of understand that that let's
[1:30:01] just don't say well here's seal number
[1:30:03] one and throw it way over here now let's
[1:30:05] go to seal number two now seal number
[1:30:07] one
[1:30:09] I believe I thought God was eternal
[1:30:11] right I thought what God Said was
[1:30:14] eternal I thought the word of God was
[1:30:15] eternal right so that seal didn't stop
[1:30:17] over here it wasn't just for the first
[1:30:19] three ages well Mark that seal when it
[1:30:22] opened
[1:30:23] if that white horse rode out into
[1:30:25] eternity guess what's going right out of
[1:30:27] the end of Eternity the word of God is
[1:30:29] what we went riding out into eternity
[1:30:30] all right let's sing one more song
[1:31:31] foreign
[1:32:58] foreign
[1:33:47] years ago in Louisiana
[1:33:50] brother Danny stayman was preaching and
[1:33:53] there were 600 kids sitting in the in
[1:33:56] the auditorium
[1:33:58] brother Danny's good you know with the
[1:34:00] kids
[1:34:02] he was talking about
[1:34:04] how that Satan wouldn't come and you
[1:34:08] know talk to him
[1:34:10] and how nobody was immune
[1:34:14] and it made a great example and it stuck
[1:34:16] with a lot of the kids even to this day
[1:34:19] he said preachers
[1:34:22] he said stand up all the preachers in
[1:34:24] the building stood up myself and several
[1:34:26] others today
[1:34:28] it was probably about 25 others
[1:34:29] scattered out in the congregation
[1:34:31] another Danny said all right I want you
[1:34:33] to sit down
[1:34:34] I want you to sit down if you've never
[1:34:37] had a bad thought
[1:34:42] he said I want you to sit down
[1:34:44] if you've never if you if you've been
[1:34:46] praying for somebody
[1:34:48] to receive the holy ghost or to receive
[1:34:50] their healing and had a dirty thought I
[1:34:52] want you to sit down if you've never had
[1:34:54] that I want you to sit down
[1:34:56] all 20 still stood
[1:34:59] at that time all the kids are going like
[1:35:01] this
[1:35:04] and the disbelief in their in their eyes
[1:35:09] that we were not immune yeah
[1:35:13] to the devil
[1:35:16] he said all right he said I want you to
[1:35:18] all he said I want all you preachers to
[1:35:20] sit down that's
[1:35:22] never had a bad thought run through your
[1:35:24] mind while you were preaching the pure
[1:35:25] word of God yeah all 20 States standing
[1:35:28] up
[1:35:29] the kids are really getting excited now
[1:35:33] he said see there he said even the ones
[1:35:37] that you thought never had any problems
[1:35:41] I have a problem
[1:35:44] and don't think
[1:35:46] that you're alone
[1:35:49] brother random how do I keep these bad
[1:35:52] thoughts from going through my head
[1:35:54] he said you can't right he said but he
[1:35:57] made the example he said you can't hurt
[1:35:59] you can't help the birds flying over
[1:36:01] your head but you can help
[1:36:04] that they don't make a mess in it in
[1:36:06] other words that they don't stay there
[1:36:07] long enough to make something to
[1:36:09] motivate you people Satan is going if he
[1:36:13] can destroy us
[1:36:16] he's got he has destroyed God
[1:36:22] if he's destroyed us
[1:36:24] he's destroyed God because if he can get
[1:36:27] us
[1:36:28] he can still keep bluffing right and
[1:36:31] still keep blessing and still keep
[1:36:34] blessing so it's do you think you got
[1:36:36] you don't have any problems up here and
[1:36:39] he's already got you right right you're
[1:36:41] his child
[1:36:42] and I'm gonna tell you something
[1:36:46] you ought to be praying for somebody
[1:36:48] and the violent thought in your mind
[1:36:50] that come right through your head while
[1:36:52] you're praying for somebody
[1:36:55] while you're preaching the gospel right
[1:36:58] a thought that never would have come
[1:37:00] from way pints left they only come from
[1:37:03] way over you know in another Auditorium
[1:37:06] somewhere
[1:37:07] right out of the clear blue here it
[1:37:10] comes right
[1:37:11] what do you do you say
[1:37:13] Lord forgive me right and just keep
[1:37:15] right on going that's what you and I
[1:37:17] have to do we're not immune I didn't
[1:37:20] tell you we were immune from this man of
[1:37:22] sin
[1:37:24] but we can be immune from the effects he
[1:37:27] has on us
[1:37:29] by taking the word of God I told Brother
[1:37:31] Tyler take the word of God Amen don't
[1:37:34] worry about what Satan is telling you
[1:37:36] right
[1:37:37] if you don't get nothing from tonight
[1:37:38] remember one thing if the devil talks to
[1:37:41] you he's lying right
[1:37:43] he may even tell you the truth but he's
[1:37:45] lying
[1:37:48] you won't surely die
[1:37:50] God won't kill you
[1:37:53] you're all right yeah just go to church
[1:37:55] whenever you want to just do whatever
[1:37:57] you want to do
[1:37:59] it come on people we're not immune to
[1:38:03] his the Bible says to his devices but we
[1:38:05] can understand what his device is right
[1:38:08] that's what these seals are doing people
[1:38:09] that seal is revealing to me and you
[1:38:12] that that man of sin is not here anymore
[1:38:13] right
[1:38:15] that man of sin Glory he may want to
[1:38:18] just he may pound you to death
[1:38:20] but he can't get his fingers in The
[1:38:22] Bride right
[1:38:24] he's he's he's just
[1:38:26] he's trying his best yeah he can't get a
[1:38:28] hold right right
[1:38:31] that's what we got to say though death
[1:38:34] destroy this body
[1:38:36] in my flesh right I don't see God Amen
[1:38:40] and then if you look down to Sunday
[1:38:42] school class now there's a group of
[1:38:44] people that needs that's just like Joe
[1:38:46] but this is the way they say it in my
[1:38:48] flesh I shall see God
[1:38:50] without death right
[1:38:53] somebody's going to stand on this Earth
[1:38:55] amen and say in my flesh right and this
[1:39:00] flesh right here
[1:39:01] I shall see God Amen without death job
[1:39:05] didn't have that Revelation but you and
[1:39:08] I have that Revelation right and the
[1:39:10] problem is we don't believe it because
[1:39:12] we're still getting older we have
[1:39:14] problems we have headaches and
[1:39:16] heartaches and trouble
[1:39:18] people if Abraham would have looked at
[1:39:20] every one of his circumstances he would
[1:39:22] have never ever had that child right
[1:39:25] he would have never had
[1:39:27] it but like I've always
[1:39:30] there's the end result
[1:39:32] we know God's going to have a bride we
[1:39:34] saw in Revelations 1 God had a bride
[1:39:37] Revelations 1 there was a man standing
[1:39:39] in the golden candlesticks in dressed as
[1:39:42] a bride
[1:39:44] we're standing here
[1:39:47] this is just a journey in between
[1:39:51] well Danny we gotta look at that prize
[1:39:53] Paul's didn't say he's sitting Paul did
[1:39:56] not say I've run well but I've had
[1:39:59] problems and no he said I've run this
[1:40:01] race right and I've read it well man and
[1:40:04] there's a prize there's a Crown of Glory
[1:40:06] waiting on me on the other side right
[1:40:09] doesn't matter what it goes through here
[1:40:12] coach Satan
[1:40:14] is out to get us right that's true but
[1:40:17] if you stand behind this word of God he
[1:40:20] can't have you amen God promised he'd
[1:40:22] have a people right you're part of the
[1:40:23] promise it didn't say promise Richard
[1:40:26] Marlow but if Richard Marlow accepted
[1:40:27] then that's his promise right exactly a
[1:40:30] pardon is not a problem a pardon unless
[1:40:32] it's received by that person right
[1:40:36] God pardon everybody at Calvary every
[1:40:40] person that's right he could call every
[1:40:42] person all the billions of people that
[1:40:44] ever lived and they were pardoned but
[1:40:46] once
[1:40:47] you reach and get it it becomes yours
[1:40:50] amen some are not ever going to do that
[1:40:52] okay so we're never going to reach and
[1:40:54] get that part and the national name of
[1:40:55] the book
[1:40:56] 95 Bush one day reaching got that pardon
[1:40:58] and said hey I accept what that man
[1:41:01] wrote down about me right yeah I Abraham

[1:41:17] let's take a little bit higher then
[1:41:19] we'll go home
[1:41:21] we're not just pardoned
[1:41:25] people that walk off these Earth and the
[1:41:27] body change right will believe that they
[1:41:29] never were put into prison
[1:41:32] exactly because the physical story was
[1:41:34] the man was put into prison for killing
[1:41:36] somebody you know
[1:41:37] you and I put Jesus Christ on Calvary
[1:41:39] right you and I killed the god killed

[1:42:05] whacked him right there in the nose why
[1:42:08] it wasn't revealed to him he was just
[1:42:09] saying what somebody else said
[1:42:12] he was just saying what the prophet said
[1:42:14] right come on people right these are
[1:42:18] quotes these quotes will kill you right
