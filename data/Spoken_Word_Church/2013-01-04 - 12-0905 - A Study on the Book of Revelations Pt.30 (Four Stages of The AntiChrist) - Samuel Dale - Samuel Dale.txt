Revelations 1 and then we've been at it and then today we're going to drop First Peter 1 and we're going over to Revelation 6 uh 1 and 2 but we'll read Revelations 1 1 through3 to begin with so let's pray father we thank you for your love and your grace we thank you for the day and the hour that we're living and truly father we believe that you are our father you're our God you're our all and all

we love you and we thank you as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts forgive our sins because we want to be cleansed and stand in your blood complete we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 1-3 and then we'll go over to Revelation 6 don't forget first Peter now there we're talking about at the revelation of Jesus Christ all right keep that in your mind so what Revelations 1:1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave un to him to show sh unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand and all right now Revelations 6 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast saying now as it were a was a were the voice of Thunder what he heard so he was what one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer you may be seated the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word now I know tonight's going to be almost a uh complete repeat of Sunday Services the afternoon and I I regret that uh Paul said it was needful sometimes to say things again and I I must believe that but I regret that uh you know I I well forget it cuz I'm going to do it anyway I'm going to go back over it again amen so apologize I won't do no good but uh I'm not going to do I'm going to try to settle down and more less Sunday I was just preached the cross and didn't use my notes I never did turn a page and I just kind of run through a line of what I wanted you to see and then tonight we'll just back up and you know put everything slow and gradual and you know bringing forth the the things that we believe about these things all right now we've been quite while speaking about in in the study of the Book of Revelations uh this is message number 30 and what I want you to think of tonight is so now you're going to have to bear with me then and even the quote you read bear with me when the prophet will say three stages and you'll go through it Antichrist Prophet you know and then he'll go to Beast all right but then no you got to have the number four for the Antichrist and we'll get through that at the light of the message so now I want to us to go through it and I want you to think about it and we will read that after a while let see you got four stages this uh one that we're talking about here the what we read in the Revelation 61 you see a white horse and he right that set on him y all right now that's he is a person all right amen but what we've got to do is to see how it can come out to be that person all right and and then that way you'll catch on to why we're talking about four stages because then you'll see that it starts out uh Antichrist Spirit the among the church we'll cover that and then it'll come into the next stage see which was the first one with a white horse White Horse the next one is a red horse and you'll see that it turns out to be a pope y you know but yet he's not in the stage of Pope yet he will begin as a prophet a false prophet to a false system right and then he'll become incarnate in the prophet and come out to be one man which will be a pope then all right then see that Pope is still not the quote man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God as we'll read because that will wind up to be the Beast right amen all right so you got a white horse and you're going to have the second seal will be a red horse third seal will be a black horse fourth seal he be a Pale Horse amen it's the same horse just different colors different stages of his journey amen and it's the same Rider on each horse all right he just gets off one and goes on and on and on just keeps going but there's four stages of him and that way it'll fit them to understand why there has to be four combat Beast the lion the ox the man the eagle to combat the an to Christ you know but now I don't know where if youve thought about it in that form or not see when brother Rand said in the the seal book he said you want me to tell you who this is no matter what I was right he said it's the Antichrist well you just look out and say Antichrist well John said the Antichrist was already with you right now but what was John looking at a man or a spirit right amen and that's why Paul if it had been a man standing there Crown you know a crown was given unto him later see if it had been that then Paul easily would have known what the Antichrist was and he would have called it that see cuz he would have seen a man but instead he saw a spirit among the people and and he began to tell you know about the things that that Spirit Among Us would lead us away from the word you know and the things and and carry it in and then he would speak of the man of sin amen that would be sitting in the temple of God in Thessalonians there show himself to be as God see that's when he would become the Beast right Satan incarnate in the false prophet right that had wound up to be Pope y that it started as an antichrist Spirit right so now we're going to get to that in the message in a little bit but I I kept saying some things and I have for years and and I come back to it all the time so if it's for me okay you bear with me till I get it off of my heart and I surely haveen had it on my heart for 40 years to try to look at the Bible and see that this message Mage doesn't reveal the devil right right this enti message that we claim it doesn't reveal the devil that's right it reveals Jesus Christ amen the Bible doesn't reveal the devil right there is no devil to be I mean there there's nothing about him you got to have something for it to be reveal you know he will be annihilated one day well what about your Revelation right amen that's right you agree that's right the Beast to FAL Prophet Etc will be cast into the Lake of Fire and totally annihilated right amen all right now it can't be a revelation M cuz Revelation can never be annihilated right you know true Revelation right man now if it's a part Revelation or just thoughts it ain't got no Foundation to it anyway that's why hell is hell has no Foundation that's right amen see it was was created for the devil and his angels right but one day death and hell will be cast into the Lake of Fire right and totally annihilated that's right right see because it has no Foundation amen all right see in that way that's why we don't believe in the eternal hell right because if hell is eternal You' have to have eternal life right that's easy to take isn't it amen you'd have to have eternal life well that would be God's own life living in hell but see we've been taught that all our life right and like I tell you it it ain't going to change nobody's thinking for me to say that right right I don't know how many is listening tonight around the world even live or will be listening to Tes but you know I know and realize that I can't reveal anything to you that's right and I know and realize that brother random cannot reveal anything to you even the Lord Jesus said my own life did not reveal that he said it takes a Holy Spirit to reveal but if God don't reveal to you the things I'm talking about you don't know what I'm talking about amen right it's words right but it's not a revelation then it's revealed right you follow what I'm saying amen so Satan can't be the Revelation that the Bible is talking about he is not the first seal the holy spirit is the Seal of God according to Ephesians 4:30 right and the Holy Spirit is the only one that can break the seal right amen see that's what I've tried for all of the 40 years or more now to get you to see the seals is they don't reveal the Antichrist am the things they reveal Jesus Christ all right then the opposition is seen right on the other side to amen and brother was making a statement one day I looked for it there's a word also when I couldn't find it maybe you can one day but maybe way can remember it but brother Brown said we've talked enough about him yeah that's right he was talking about the devil and his ways he said we've talked enough about him right amen that's true he said we'll get on to the revelation of Jesus Christ in other words so I gave you a lot of the quotes back that I had given you Sunday for the purpose of you following it with me and then we'll get down to the real part of the message you know and I don't bother me to continue it that's right next Wednesday CU brother brother prash his son Samuel will be with us this coming weekend the Lord willing to preach for us and just pray that the Lord would bless him amen bless us as we travel and go and come back all right now the revelation of Jesus Christ we read that in Revelations 1 we read it we've read it we read it we read it right right ever service for 29 this is number 30 and it starts off the revelation of Jesus Christ amen all right now we've been into Peter using at the revelation of Jesus Christ brother brandom used the the quote revelation of Jesus Christ 10 57 times 85 of those times were used before the seals broke up to that period and 72 times in the seal book and coming thereafter so you know for certain that he believed in the revelation of Jesus Christ right amen and that's what I want us to do now tonight is just read and then we'll get through this part and if we don't cover it we'll get back to it later it's all right I want to make make sure you you get it then you say to most people you know watch the first seal by horse rider yeah no the first seal is a revelation of Jesus Christ amen right amen the white horse rider is going the other way I ask you to read the seal book I don't want to raise a hands of how many did you know the what the first seal right but notice what he'll say about that fellow right that guy that person riding off and if you got two people in the Bible standing there yeah you certainly don't have a revelation of God right one of them is God and the other the devil or both of them is a devil you know cuz God can't be divided up no all right now but let's read a few quotes and we'll just go quote quote quote quote quote I'll give them and the brothers can pull them as fast as they can and we'll read them off to you so go ahead and start with number one brother says the evening me messenger 63 11:16 you and always that every time that a messenger comes it's always a call back to the word y never fails remember this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ there cannot be nothing added to it or taken from it it's the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and the only way that we can ever be sure if anything Rises Among Us that's contrary to this Revelation then it's wrong see it's the back of the word and always calling it's back to the word always calling back right awaking Jesus paragraph 4763 117 it's the word God's program the complete revelation of what he was what he is and what he will be it's a continual revelation of Jesus Jesus Christ and a complete revelation of Jesus Christ is the Bible anything contrary to him we going to get rid of it right all right number three paragraph 16 of the breach 63 317 evening and this book let's turn now to the fifth chapter of the book which is called the revelation of Jesus Christ first seal paragraph 12 6338 18 and as we study this chapter we're referring to referring different places even to Old and New Testament alike what's Old and New Testament because the entire Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ see that's all together the revelation of of the the Lord Jesus the revelation of Jesus Christ is God revealing himself in the book revealing himself through Christ in the book and Christ is the revelation of God he come to reveal God God because he and God were the same so was in God was in Christ same God was in Christ reconcil in the world to himself in other words you never know what God was until he revealed himself through Christ then you can see now where are you find in the Antichrist as being anything yet see if he can be destroyed he is not nothing right amen because if we're not born again we can be destroyed right right so you know what we're nothing first SE 63 318 paragraph 45 but it's a mystery but yet we probed on it probed in it excuse me but remember the book is sealed the book is a book of is book is a book of mystery of Revelation it's the revelation of Jesus Christ see a book of Revelation now you know down through the age man has probed and tried to get into that y for seal paragraph 42 that's the way the church ages and the seals and all the rest of it and any onebody tells you that he know he has those seven Thunders if it don't compare with the rest of the word there's something wrong here it's got to come thus sayeth the Lord for this is the book this is the revelation of Jesus Christ in its enti now time Church age is sealed with it right world falling world is against falling apart paragraph 47 the word Messiah means the anointed one something Anointed God this is the revelation of Jesus Christ the whole book was sealed with Seven Seals of the revelation of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was in Genesis Jesus Christ was in the middle of the book Jesus Christ was in in The Exodus and Genesis and he was in the middle of the book and he was in the New Testament and in the Revelation from to the end the same yesterday today and forever now notice he says Jesus Christ am he doesn't say Jesus we know Jesus the flesh was not back dark right right amen right right he talking about Jesus Christ the anointed right all right see revealing what's in the book Feast of the trumpets not uh paragraph 42 64719 the morning therefore where the angel Lord met us in the Bible becoming you Bible then it opened up and revealed all the things that the reformers and things had left out it was the complete revelation of Jesus Christ allog together new to us but perfectly exactly with the scriptures now it didn't become a different book it became it was the same book it's the same Revelation like I've always said to you why did brother brandham had had always preached one God right but after the seals broke he preached Christ as the mystery of God revealed why because he saw more of God mhm and he began to preach it that's what the seals brought out same message Feast to the pret paragraph 134 this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ brother brand P's Bible the editor and the Seven Seals had the mystery head of what it all was and it's supposed to O to open it in the last days to the ladies in age at the ending all right no number 10 it is the rising of the Sun 65418 the morning service paragraph 308 right he is the one who opened those seals he is those seals for the word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was open what is the opening of the of seals then revealing Christ amen all right it's not revealing the Antichrist y the Antichrist is shown in opposition y mhm yep The Ten Commandments didn't come to reveal the devil amen right that's right what is the first one that's right don't it say something about that there's just one God you know all right and his name is just one amen well see we look at the Bible and then I mean the the message then we reading brother said see how this Antichrist is being revealed to was tonight well see that brother he said it was a revelation it's a revelation to me and you who he is yeah he's not a revelation of himself no it's a revelation to you and me who the Antichrist is he has no revelation of his own right hell comes out of a bottomless pit your Prophet said no anchor to it there's nowh to put it right see it has no place none whatso ever all right but it's the Antichrist that the first seal is dealing with and we'll get to it it's bringing forth the understanding of what God said he was against right thou hatest Revelation about two there one of the church ages thou hatest the Deeds of the nickan he said I hate him too so it wasn't revealing the Deeds of the nians it's revealing Jesus Christ amen amen then we see the things right so you got a revelation of Jesus Christ you don't have to worry about a person right right right no right now come on you know the way I've always been with every one of you and you're setting there our set brother he can get up and say I talked to him for quite a while before I said anything about seals or anything like that or even about brother rown being a prophet or or anything y I talked to him about the revelation of one God right yep and he can well remember especially brother collie about a bunch of brothers that I introduced to the message that one of them was even trying to get his whole church out of the Methodist conference to take the building away from them all kind of things but you know what all of those got a revelation they got a revelation that organized religion was wrong right amen they govern got a revelation of Jesus Christ that's right they got a revelation of organized religion being wrong if that's all you get you'll come out of the church but you'll go right back into some hin somewhere right amen because that's all you can do that's right that's right all right but when you get the revelation of Jesus Christ amen yes sir amen man ain't going to argue about that no you mean they can take a trinity Doctrine and deprogram you that's the big word of today right deprogram you yeah I mean after all of the years that you've talked about the Lord Jesus Christ right one true and living God then they can take a trinity and deprogram you something's wrong amen it ain't a revelation that's right it ain't a revelation right there's no way it's not a revelation you get a revelation it'll hold you amen amen yes sir but just believeing brother R was a prophet and won't hold you living organized religion was wrong won't hold you right believeing the seals reveals the Antichrist they W hold you but to believe that the seals reveal Jesus Christ that's right and then you can see the Antichrist and what he's doing MH no tell them all about it brother D what that Devil's out there doing I ain't concerned with what that Devil's out there doing right that's why I Don't Preach like other preachers you know women's dress hire clothes and everything every sermon and 40 years later you still preaching the same thing CU that's the way these preachers are most of them that's true I'm trying my best to get you to see Jesus Christ that'll take care of the hire the dress the clothes the men the the the shorts and the hire the Long hire andever it'll take care of everything if you get a revelation but if you don't get a revel you're going to arue you're going to be like I said there Sunday and you're going to go outside after the service I think brother Dale missed it right here you're not going to see that I'm trying my best to get you Jesus Christ amen that's right well don't you think brother D you to make it more simple what oh my come on folks I'm as open as can be right but how do I to know what is more simple than to preach 40 something years on one God right right M amen now is there any way to get it more simple no a no way get no more simple that's what Paul now come on folks brother Bram was preaching to a world right when he had to preach hiring clothes and dress in every service he was trying to get people converted right that thought they were converted yeah that's right right that's right and you know that's the hardest person to talk to yep absolutely correct you get somebody says I ain't wrong you ain't going to do anything you want to you ain't going to convince them right that's right the person said I ain't wrong with you W shut up forget it y right they're not going to listen to you right like the old saying is about an alcoholic is what you got to First admit you one then you can be helped MH you go down to the inum and they ask you a question they said do you think you're crazy and you no I ain't no I ain't crazy lock him up over there you say well I probably am cuz sometimes I act like I am they say put them over this side and we help that fell that's just about a truth of it right right but listen Church the seals then don't reveal the Antichrist amen right and the actual opening of that seal then is not until we get out of here right and we'll be to Israel when that man of sin when we get to him after a while if we don't we'll take it later when he stands in that temple of God showing himself to be as God as the Beast right then there is your first seal completely made known right he said what what the prophet preached the seals to us yeah he preached one God he preached what a baptism he preached no eternal hell he preached a lot of things to us didn't he right yep and he preached what the seals really are amen it's a revelation of Jesus Christ that's right it's not revealing the Antichrist I certainly don't want to be there when that for seal opens at Armageddon do you right how about the fifth one right you want to be a Jew and be over there right now being slaughtered like crazy and I believe those Jews are still being killed and placed under the altar right until we get out of here sure you want to be here when the SE six seal breaks that's the tribulation period And in the seventh when it'll finally become the end of all things y see we get to Revelation Church amen right right we're his wife right then he shows us like we're going to try to do tonight he shows us and says this is the the Antichrist well if it's a spirit it can't be all of Revelations 1 I mean 61 and 2 right go it there's a man there right sitting on a horse right it's only a spirit to start with right M you can't Crown a spirit he had to become a false prophet right he didn't Crown the false prophet when he first come out cuz there were many false prophets right it's like John says we're going to read over again the Antichrist is with us he said mhm you see they couldn't you couldn't Crown it till he become a pope right that was his crown that was when he was crowned when he become a pop and then he'll be the beast when we leave out of here that's the Antichrist right he's in four stages right that's what we must understand those stages all right we the bride of Christ can see what begins right and what ends right you remember Sunday when I was trying to make the point just preaching on it the brother around and said ever Spirit ever Doctrine started in Genesis absolutely amen right right amen amen all right then we got to go back there and find it but by being the bride of Christ we can see the beginning and the ending of all things amen we already know how the Millennium is going to be right amen and who it's going to be to right to the Jews we already know about the white Throne judgment and how that we sit on that throne with him amen we already know how the future home is going to be amen MH we certainly not there yet but see it's made known to us right and that is what I just quoted all these qu that is the revelation of Jesus Christ as we read that said the old as well as the new right he said if you can't see Christ in every verse of the Bible go back and read it again amen said you missed something he Hebrews 13:8 that didn't start on the day of Pentecost you know or starting the life of of Jesus Christ that started at the foundation of the world right amen that's right Hebrews 13:8 same yesterday today and forever was it not that that brother randam said eve failed on right right do you need that quote Eve failed on Hebrews 138 well what do you mean Jesus wouldn't e back her no but Christ would amen right amen and that's why brother R didn't say Jesus the same yesterday today and forever the Bible don't say it it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and amen amen see so we got it in the right order all right amen but just think of these things all now go ahead and pull up we're going to pull up a quote that I used our Sunday but it be later on over in your quote so this one going to be 15a P that one up and then we'll read the scriptures you got it on your notes s but look what he to say and I just pull this in to where we get it this is taken from the first seal U paragraph 293 and white horse rider went out who is he he's Mighty in his conquering power it is a great fellow in his conquering power you want me to tell you who he is he's the Antichrist that's exactly who he is now because you see if an antichrist Jesus said that the two would be so close together until it would deceive the very elected the Bible if it were possible Antichrist it's the Antichrist Spirit right all right now so he didn't start out back there he didn't start out back there if I missed something Reading go ahead you got 15a on here 10 a on that one 15 a what they're looking for well that's 10 A's I told him to pull up after 10 okay keep my numbers right they right there running there 108 we just changed that while go you want to see us what was in there go our life like everything Richard had Joe and him doing one thing Wade had him doing another thing and I had him doing another thing and they was going all the same time they did it all he's really got a good mind I have to admit that that's right you know him and brother Anderson trying to hold us together see all right but go ahead now pull the scripture so let's read them again now who is this who is this white horse rider he's the Antichrist amen now we the bride not the world we the bride are going to see him as he starts as a spirit and then he becomes a prophet to that system and preaches his Doctrine and then he becomes an incarnate false prophet which is the pope and then he becomes the Beast which is a man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God then you better remember what the first seal says it says that he that set there on a man right second Thessalonians says the man of sin didn't say the baby of sin right the man of sin and they asked brother random we got it in here did that fulfill the first ceiling he says yes listen we see all of this by Revelation right in other wonderful thing Amen to be able to see the end and all things and can know all that's going to take place who would want to be anything else right it'd be a slanderous thing to go try to get me to run for president of the United States that's right you think I'd give up my office right here to be a president of this garbage Camp that's right well you could get up there and teach them the seals come on I can't even give them to the people of this message amen they don't want to hear them right of what they really are right and bring it down to where you sit your own life right now remember your Prophet said there a minute ago he said it would deceive the very elect if it was possible you want this quote he say as a matter of fact it would get them Tangled Up and he'd have to cut the work short you want that quote Oh no brother Dale I've got the quote where the Prophet said we can't be deceived I didn't say we'd be deceived I said he said we get tangled up right what he said you need to quote we can find it n brother Joe probably run off while I'm preaching bring out here listen John as I said Sunday was chosen to go to patas mhm M now Paul wasn't chosen right right you don't think like Paul was a prophet right right but you know he wasn't chosen to go right man well no he no come on if you got any sense at all go back and look up the ages and the times and the people Paul was already dead right before John went to patas right y he was the first church age started about ad 53 I think it is John went to patas on ad 9596 or somewhere along in there 93 95 or something Paul had done come and brought his message and been killed why wouldn't Paul chosen to go amen right he's part of the bride and was part of that beast but John represented the life Beast right remember brother said Matthew Mark Luke John Matthew he said was the line Ox was Mark Luke was the man John was the eagle as great as Paul was he was not chosen for that place because John represented the prophetic part and would tie together because it would have to been said then Matthew Mark Luke and Paul that's s run around would have had to explain it and he wouldn't have had his gospels correct right come on folks that's good is it time to wake up that's good so John was chosen y why because Jesus said there one of these standing here yep Paul was that's right so it couldn't been him but he said one of you standing here not going to die do you see me returning yep right yeah John was taken to patmas to see that a Sayan went out that John wouldn't going to die read that in the Bible a Sayan Went Out Among the apostles you think we get confused and get it all twisted up it went out there before Jesus ever left yeah that's right MH see John a't going to die y he said how about how be it he didn't say that y right but you see church that Antichrist Spirit has got us deceived right he said no don't me but bless God I'm in the truth well what are you blessing God and throw your shoulders back for yeah right you're sure there's something wrong with you right amen you said brother brand said brother brand that Antichrist Spirit got you to exce he'd say yes it's your and I'm trying my best to get rid of it get of it amen that's right but you see we think we struck we we know all about it ain't no Antichrist going to deceive me no it ain't going to deceive it's already got you brother R said it was so close yeah right remember you say it's anointings in time remember brother brand said Lucifer was the anointed sh that Stood Beside the Lord and the Bible says it Y and brother R said that even Lucifer could pass out Supernatural gifts absolutely absolutely you need that quote he could pass out Supernatural gifts sure you can there's only one way you can tell which one's right and which one's wrong and that's by the word that's right you can't tell it by your feelings that's right that's right so you take gifts and you their gifts will get in your way god-given gifts will get in your way you know why because you'll lean to them all the time instead of depending upon the word and letting the gift operate right right and then thank God for the gift you'll start trying to use the gift to interpret the word yeah and it won't work nope the devil's got you in his trap that's right would you see church that's why I'm not popular I believe in gifts I believe in in the workings of the Holy Spirit am it but I believe in the word right being revealed and then I can know whether it's the right Spirit or not right right oh the the it was so sweet and humble it come to me do you think the devil's going to come to you like a roaring line and say I'm the devil no he's going to be soft and smooth smothing smoothing but you know what God sometimes you know what he does he said sit down shut up and goes Pap out slaps us a few times amen try to get her attention right amen all right is that true and we thank all that that sweet humble Holy Spirit and Devil he's sweet and humble too he can talk sweet talk too sure he slick tongue Eve in the garden yes amen come on amen you think you're not going to be deceived you already are that's right right but you see Church see some of you sitting here think I'm talking out tired the internet and those on the internet they talk I'm talking to people here no I'm talking to all of them I'm talking about how deceiving that devil can be amen yes sir you know that he took the first church to Rome yep oh oh now you got all this explanations I've heard it even here people telling it I've heard explanations the real bride didn't go to NAA you better go read your prophet's message okay and the best you can get out of reading it is that they went down there found out it was wrong in left but brother R said they brought back doctrines with them sure because their seed was planted y you better read the whole message y amen that's right well we can't be dece no you already are are right okay see because if it's not if it don't tie said if man thinks he has Old St it don't compare with revelation of Jesus Christ is what you got that's right there people in this message got Thunders and virt and and all kind of things and they're the great prophet of this that was sold over here and they're all kind of doing polygamy all kind of doing young kids running men with young girls yeah in this message yeah right sometimes I'm embarrassed to be a part of it amen but I know that if I'm going to try to stand for the truth I got to be a part of it cuz this message was the truth that's right it didn't bring none of them some of us were talking the other day about I think it was brother Samson when we was talking he made a good point he said a good denominational Church ain't going to fall for what the people of this message fall for you can't get that in a Baptist Church yeah and preach what's in this message they'll throw you out of it that's right even as bad as they've got yeah that's true when when I was there it was pretty tough you didn't have no double married preachers right in the Baptist Church when I was there that's right they wouldn't let him preach That's How Strong they were come on church right but listen so when brother ROM is saying that this is the oh you want me to know who tell you who it is he said it's the Antichrist yeah then he proceeds starts out trying to tell you and I you know how that it starts is a spirit right a saying a little thought and like I told you Sunday what killed Abel because can Doctrine yep we get on to the second sea over that in the Red Sea the doctrine killed him amen Cain got to the point that you've heard brother Brown say it he said God this is my offering you take it or leave it yeah and brother Brown said how could anybody under any anointing stand in the presence of God and talk like them things right amen that was how deceiving it was Amen brother R say this under and we'll get in a minute the symbol of under a symbol of a white righteous church right yes sir feeding the the world taking the word the world of the the gospel going to the heathens and right where are we right but keep in mind with what I'm trying to say and then we'll just start on I don't mind quitting taking it sunay I mean next week no problem to me but remember we got to see him first as an antichrist Spirit that's right not as a man absolutely amen that's right so then listen so then you see when the seal actually broke it'll break to Israel he'll be a man absolutely now if that don't solve the problem with you that you can't see what I've tried to convince you for 40 years you got a problem when we get out of here and he goes as a man of sin he'll be a man right yes sir but he started off as a spirit MH and even when it becomes a false prophet you say it's a false prophet it's a man you don't crown him you can't crown him until it gets over far enough that he becomes a pope the pro false prophet wasn't crowned the pope is the one that's crowned amen that's right amen you know one of the guys out of all of the false prophets walks up and says hey I'm the PO come on then the Beast is when he'll really be a man because even the pope listen the pope of Rome is not at this time incarnate Satan he's incarnate false prophet with an antichrist system right amen yes yes he is not a man the the man of sin no right we see it as it works up toward land amen right it comes into being go ahead and now pull the scriptures up and let's read these CU John when he comes back from patmas yeah now he can remember some things some things was taken from him cuz he couldn't ride them and not being able to ride them brother R said he actually heard the Thunders yep but he couldn't write what it was right it was removed from him you say well how could that be all right what if you was taken up we set you over here in a room and we feed you a lot of information and you walk out of that room unless you got a photographic memory you're going to lose about 98% of what was taught you in that room right right that right that's why nonon would see chariots josling in the streets he saw Buicks and old mobiles running up down the highway because they had headlights on running like lightning the scripture says but he couldn't call them Buicks and no mobiles he didn't know the word no right he didn't know automobile so when he come back out he said what' you see I saw Chariot mhm and they were just running like lightning cuz they had big old lanterns hanging on boy they would r on you see what talking about John left patmas and come back you could have said John will you tell me what those Thunders are he said nope I heard them but it's gone from me y that y right yep sure come on right it was cuz when he was told to seal up things he couldn't say nothing but he did remember and John was the only one in the Bible that called it an antichrist right yes sir Paul called it Grievous wolves and stuff like that but John when he come back he wrote to Little John's there 1 2 and 3 I coming back from pmas he gets over there in Little John's you know what he said he just gets down he says little children love one another y brother Brown said when he got so old he couldn't do nothing else said he just sat around and told him said little children love one another you know why he had seen love yeah absolutely amen he had seen love in it total Apex of any height amen right and he might not have been able to tell us a lot of things but he could remember some of it right so John says it's an antichrist so by the time John got around to preaching maybe some of the others had talked about it and used the word Antichrist cuz they could comprehend what the word would be anti is against right all right and in Christ being the word so John writes his little John's and this is what he says right y 1 John 2:18 little children it is the last time as you have heard that Antichrist shall come even now are there many Antichrist whereby we know that is the last time and you read all around what he's saying on here but I'm just giving you the scripture 1 John 2 and22 who is a liow but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ he is Antichrist that denieth the father and the sun I told you Sunday they use that scripture see to say you know that you you don't want to deny the father but let me use it if you don't believe in the father Son and Holy Ghost three manifestations of the same God you are a liar a deceiver and an antichrist brother brother brother R never done away with the teaching about a father a son and a holy ghost right that's right amen right I still have something to preach on that and ain't got back to it yet what 40 years yeah ain't no problem right I just keep studying and I'll finally get it but listen If you deny the father you're a Oneness right so you're an antichrist yep yes sir simple yep Jesus had a father well how could he be his own father he wasn't his own father right he had a father right and he had a mother but he wouldn't married his mother was a word amen his father was a word y amen that's what Hebrew uh what is it Hebrews 105 a body thou father has prepared me see the truth of one God doesn't do away with understanding of Father Son and Holy Ghost that's right it places it in order that we can understand the scriptures amen all right right 1 John 4 and3 and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God Y and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world what the spirit of the Antichrist the man of sin sitting in the temple of God wouldn't I right the prophet wasn't there the Pope wasn't there was only Antichrist then John and them would pick up later in their D especially Paul and talk about false prophets because he could see a little bit about it 2 John 1:7 For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist right right it was a spirit back there we'll read it in a minute I've got it in here we pick up these symbols first and I've got it in here when you quote that when Jesus went was taken up lifted up Judas was went out and hung himself when the Holy Spirit came back he said the Antichrist come back okay yep yep there that spirit all right but look John was shown these things John saw that white horse rider right and a horse and later on he admired the church that he saw right right that's right because it was beautiful amen yep absolutely now I've been over there and I'm not throwing off on they're doing I've been to these foreign countries a few of them and I'm not throwing off on their living in their houses and sometimes but you know this old building here ain't in too good a shape but it sure does look better than what you see over there and the fanciest ones you see right cuz you see on Theo lowers a hard tile and the walls are concrete with some kind of tiles or whatever is on them and yep me you and mold is everywhere if they don't take care of a lot of it yep and you look on the floor and you see a lot of them little little bitty bugs crawling around that you can't even hardly see that's right absolutely and you think I'm laying down in the East tonight you lay down in bed in about the middle of the night you wake up and they do something crawling all over you you want to get up and go take a bath and it in nice homes yeah that's a good one come on folks nice hes yeah but what can they do about it now I said that to say this so if John admired the church he saw a beautiful Church sister today that's right yes he did you say the temple that was built back there was beautiful I agree with you wonderful beautiful architect but now if you if you gave me an opportunity to receive an exact replica of the temple in the time of the Lord Jesus are some of these churches that are built in the last days I'd take the churches in the last days over there now where whether you would or not I don't know I think brother Gary would because he likes our condition yeah so at least he'd say our condition that do you get my point John admired it sure did amen it's beautiful to him almost deceived him right and you know it was so beautiful now swallow real good it was so beautiful until it deceived brother brandham until the seals broke right amen you say brother Dale be careful I'm very very careful I'm quoting behind him that church system had brother brandham de see he was going to preach that the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost right then you first seal and read that's what he was going to preach that was how deceiving it is and see we call it going right but listen John then what was a seal when it was broke the lamb had to break the seal couldn't be the devil doing it right so when the lamb broke the seal it showed that white horse rider and the only thing that was missing from him was two things when he first started a crown was missing right yep but the other thing was that he had no arrows right for his Bowen he had a bow with no arrows right that's right but the rest of the things he read right he was riding on a white horse brother brandom says now watch him he didn't say was a type of Christ he said he typed after Christ not a type of Christ he tyed after Christ why Jesus Christ come right in in on a donkey White Donkey right right Satan went out riding on the White Horse y don't you think he know that one day that we'll come riding back out of Heaven on white horses right right amen see he's copying after amen that's what I'm telling you about this Beast I've said this to you for 40 years he cannot be the Beast he cannot be the man of sin sitting in the temple of God to Israel to show himself to be as God until we get out of here that's right and the reason he can't he don't know how to do it right n amen yes sir that's it he don't know how to become the Beast until the bride becomes amen the Incarnate God right amen that's right correct not a son of God not a second person right incarnate God Amen how long have I been preaching on to you about it that we are the children of God we are the all spring of God but where God made manifest in another form called a rde right right so he can't be the Beast right you don't know how right God came back in a holy spirit on the dead Pentecost Satan copied it y with the Antichrist Spirit right amen God started using a fivefold Ministry to bring his word Satan pulled up his false prophets Y and God could become incarnate in his bride in the last days amen Satan he become incarnate in one man called the pope and then they've had many of them yeah you know how many gods are the got yeah but he can't be the Beast till we get out of here amen he's in the states right now of Incarnate false prophet through the pope that's where it's Advanced to now but he's still not called a man right he ain't called a man to sin until we get out of here right why because the opening of the first seal you saw a man riding on a horse yep right he that set there on yep M see so you start off by the prophet with the great wonderful understanding that started as an antichrist amen then it becomes a prophet to that Antichrist system amen then he becomes an incarnate false prophet as the pope and then he'll be be the beast when we get out of here right Church how long do we have to wait to get into this message right amen it's like I told him about the the minister brother we we go into the ministers meeting up there and I'm sorry I'm hateful I know but if there's 20 30 there there'll be four or five at least out of the crowd and Ain even never read a Daniel 70 week book don't even have one of them but they'll tell you all about Daniel 70 weeks and that's the hardest person to talk to amen is someone that ain't got enough sense to know when they're defeated by the word right amen well why did he say it that's the way people are and it ain't going to be nothing but just that point but if God can conin that's one person amen it'll be worth it all it's up to him to reveal not up to me that's right so listen it was first sent in the symbol so let's start on that go ahead brother number 11 I'm going to read a few of these and put it in and then we may have to stop on the last part the part I wanted to get to look what he says this is paragraph 146 of the first seal then when the lamb took the book and broke that first seal God spoke from his eternal Throne to say what that seal was to be revealed but when it's placed before John it was in a symbol a white horse a rider a bow in his hand no arrows and the crown was given him how simple when John saw it it was still a mystery one it wasn't even revealed right then it cannot be revealed until what he said here at the end time but it come in a symbol next that's part 11 paragraph 148 it thundered as soon as the lamb struck back the seal and what it reveal not all of itself first it was God he speaking tell them what it is next it's a symble then it's revealed three things see it's coming forth from the throne first it can't be seen heard or nothing it's sealed up the Lamb's blood paid the price it thundered out when he spoke out and when he did white horse rider started out and it still was a symol y you see one right around we call it a Antichrist paragraph 150 and watch he said it would be known in the last days but it's come but it comes forth in a church symbol do you understand it Church it comes forth in a symbol of a church that they know there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a white horse riter it's only and it's only to be revealed at the last days when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to Christ right but to the church breaking to you and I a church symbol all right a church symbol and why would it be a church symbol so evidently the Antichrist has been having a pretty good running sway as you can call it or running a pretty good route through the church right right right and you know it was the church as I quoted one ago if you want this you can have them I'm get them it was the bride the church that went to NAA sure they seen it was wrong and left right but that seed had done been planted what seed you remember what I told you the other day go read it and don't argue with me about it I don't believe that well go read it and call me up and tell me I'm wrong the first night see in counsil was not an argument over one God or three gods that's right right it was over whether Jesus was the substance or a like substance it was two men one of them is Aras and I can't remember the other naus or something I can't remember but it was two men and their argument was over until even the prophet said in the church age book that the world was divided over a vowel or something a mark over a word and you think that deceiving is not deceiving see the Antichrist is the spir the spirit of antichrist is the spirit of the devil okay mhm everybody got that right Spirit of the Antichrist is Spirit of the devil right all right now let me quote some from brother brandom he says in the church AG book talking about how they were arguing over these words and different things and he made an outstanding statement he said let me finalize this with one thing he said you mean those people back there knew exactly the letter of the Greek but he said why did they miss Jesus Christ standing there right now you know they knew the Greek right those religious leaders knew the Greek right what did they miss Jesus Christ when he came the exact way that the Bible said he would come you know why cuz they was deceived by the Antichrist right there's an outstanding quote I hope I have time when I get to it at the ministers meeting about the Daniel 70 weeks he brother around him in covering dates and times he's covering 69 weeks of Messiah and all once he makes a statement it's in the seal book and he said see he's cut off 62 weeks he said that's how many he's cut off out of the 70 he said m going just when they finished the temple in 49 years God was put out of Israel right and proving that they had went after the Antichrist and his Doctrine right was they took yep barabus instead of Jesus that's right that Antichrist Spirit was so strong it had already deceived those Jews absolutely and God was cut off 62 weeks out of the 70 y because they crucified him at the end of 69 weeks seven weeks was building the Temple he was with them sure he come down and anointed the temple d but you think they had anything else to do with God for the next 62 weeks no the Antichrist had already sealed understanding and when they seen him coming in exactly the way the Bible said he would come they were already deceived by the Antichrist so John's right there's many Antichrist anybody denies that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh amen is an antichrist amen don't you see them Jews standing there saying oh yeah we believe you're Prophet oh yeah we believe Messiah we Rec the signs but we got it figured out we who right the Antichrist had already deceived them so much that they could couldn't understand amen that's right and kill their very God Y in that deception right those people when they got down there who was it pilot who say I can't kill him there's no no nothing wrong with him he said you ain't a friend of Caesars if you do that he said I wash my hands with their blood you know what they said let his blood be on us and our children and look at them ever since then they've been hated and chased around the world right and killed on every hand right because of that statement that their leaders made that's right and their leaders were deceived by the devil y there's your Antichrist spirit all the way through the Old Testament folks y absolutely amen it didn't come down to a church symbol how much more deceiving is a church than a beer joint yeah right amen come on deceived let's read these facts all right go to number 12 Brother Anderson the Seal of the Antichrist 1955 paragraph E21 and about the time that the Holy Spirit came back upon the church to pull out of people for the bride the Antichrist came back also Now read it in 1 John 4 and3 and he that said and he said little children every spirit that confesses that Jesus has not come look how he puts it has not come in the flesh is not the spirit of God and this is the spirit of antichrist that should come into the world and already and already in the world working in the children of Disobedience see Jesus knew who he was facing right Satan that's right that's why he told in leaders he said you of your father the devil y let me paraphrase that he said you're so Anointed with the spirit of antichrist that you can't see that I am the Christ amen right did that change anything right was not that what was said to him amen foreal paragraph 194 rides a pale horse as he appears on his ride this lice ride now that's a four seal coming Armageddon coming down he's on his life now and now that is not in our day that will be on down it's the seal for told that's right so when the Antichrist went out on the first the white horse rider it was the seals for told right y of what it would be made known to them cuz see the church has done gone up when this happens right on down reading when Christ appears here on Earth as as this fell appears and becomes completely completely the devil from Antichrist all the way down to false prophet then into the Beast the devil himself and he's riding on a pale horse that's the number four horse right colored all mixed up with all kind of colors to make him pale and deadly but when our Lord appears here on Earth he will be riding on a Snow White Horse amen and he will be completely fully the Emmanuel the word of God incarnate in a man you see how much difference there is in them that's the difference though yeah questions and answers on the seals brother ROM does the first paragraph 199 brother does the first horse rider first seal fulfill second Thessalonians the revelation of the man of sin yes that's right that does that easy that does that's the man of sin this same man just keeps in stages riding on until he gets on a pil horse that's called Death Christ comes on down through justification sanctification to the White Horse and that's to get life next amen first seal paragraph 295 remember in the church ages when we open the first church age back there we found out that the Holy Spirit was against a certain thing go to your church age book now go to reading your church ages that got started in that church and that was called the Deeds of the nicians you remember it niiko means to conquer Ley means the church the leoty nians to conquer the leoty take the Holy Spirit out of the church and give it all to one holy man let him be the boss of all of it you went through it the nickan notice nickan as a saying then in one Church they become a Doctrine in the next Church age and the third church it was a forcement and they had the Nan Council and it was then it was then made a Doctrine and a church that's right all right paragraph 297 the first seal look he starts out to conquer notice he has no crown the white horse rider I'm speaking of here see a bow and a crown was given him afterwards and he had no Crown to start with him really under your SE it says a crown was given it he said in a bat cuz you going to get the next seal he going to start killing right but a crown was given him notice later he was given a crown yay three of them three on one that was 300 years years later at the Nan Council when he started out a spirit of Nici to form an organization among the people and then it kept on going going on kept on going on going on it become a saying then it become a Doctrine I on reading 298 you remember Christ speaking back to the church said thou hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I hate too trying to conquer take the Holy Spirit just on one holy man he can forgive all sins and everything have we just read it here Paul spoke of it that thing was said in the last days and he couldn't be revealed till the last days that's right and he that led us will take the spirit of God out of there and then he'll reveal himself today he's under disguised of a white horse watch how he changes from that white horse in a few minutes he don't only become a white horse he becomes a beast with many heads and horns see the the White Horse he's a deceiver now and that's the reason the people hasn't known it all this time they thought it but here it is now it's going to be revealed by the scripture paragraph 301 the first seal notice when nickan Antichrist is finally he's incarnate in a man then he's crowned when he starts off as a nielan spirit in the church he's a spirit you can't Crown a spirit but 300 years later he become a pope and then they crowned him he had no Crown to start with but he got a crown later yeah and when that Spirit become incarnate see he become a man nickan Doctrine become a man then they could crown it they couldn't do it because he was just a Doctrine now get what I was saying you say he becomes incarnate in man y but remember that's not the Beast right so the pope is not incarnate Satan he's incarnate false prophet he's not incarnate God I'm incarnate Satan right he's a good guy sure have a lot of people one of them got shot how many of us been shot for what we believe right paragraph 367 368 of the first seal now remember the Antichrist and the Beast is the same self Spirit there's the Trinity yes sir it's three stages of the same devil power remember Nica see it had to be incarnate before it could be crowned see now watch this three stages first he's called Antichrist second stage he's called the false prophet third stage he's called the beast notice nicet the Antichrist teaching that started in the days of Paul against God's word Antichrist and then he's called again the false prophet which when the teaching become a man he was a prophet to the teaching of the hierarchy or the hierarchy of the Catholic Church the pope was a prophet to the false word and that made him a false prophet Propet the third stage is a beast a man that's crowned in the last days with every Power that Rome ever had paragraph 184 the second seal Satan's Trinity same person coming just incarnate from one to the other that's the way them bugs did you remember the bugs he talking about restoration of the Bride tree four bugs at it down four restoration comes in four coming back to to do it right that's the way them bugs did them worms one to the other exactly nicolan spiritual Antichrist po false prophet Beast now did you get to four there spiritual Antichrist poke false prophet Beast 1 2 3 4 sure now don't look at it and say I got it I'll figured out the pope didn't come first the Prophet come first now you miss the whole thing what I'm even talking about right he puts four stages right there Antichrist Pope false prophet Beast who's the Beast the Devil Himself incarnate then he say he can't do it he can't do it back there all right the room presuming the church ages are 378 of the church age book see how that Judah spirit that Judah Spirit came back as a rider on a white horse it was white so close to the real just as Judas was so close to Jesus a crown was given to him what or rer how that Spirit was now in the leader of the nickan system and he was a triple crown Pope who said as God in his Temple calling himself the Vier of Christ and Vier means instead of Christ or in place of or on behal of God then the pope was calling himself the Holy Ghost are disposing the holy ghost acting for him that was the Judah spirit in him doing that see how he conquered going forth conquering and Conquer Christ did not do that the only ones that come to him were already predestinated by the father and so on and on went that spirit and one day it will become truly incarnate in a man who will head up the World Council of churches control the whole world and the Antichrist system will own everything and try to control everybody Jesus will come back and Destroy them with the brightness of his coming and their end will be the Lake of Fire amen paragraph 190 Second seal then he become an antichrist now he couldn't be anti Christ only in spirit then he become an antichrist and that Spirit took a man that taught the same thing that that Antichrist Spirit was doing and then he become a false prophet that the Antichrist Spirit now what about a man in an organization suits yourself that's pretty good point right I don't know what you think about it but all right now finally he become a beast and wait we'll get in that in after a while all right now if say 's Trinity L lays like that Satan all the time Satan Antichrist Spirit the Antichrist Spirit incarnate false prophet then becomes the Beast see when not a demon that was in that Antichrist but when Satan himself is CED out he comes down and takes over the place where the demon was the devil then then the devil is carnate in is Incarnate in a man it's just just repeating itself now he's cast out as we go up right I ain't got time to explain it right that's right when we go up Satan's cast outen he can't be up there when we're up there he's up there right now accusing us right but he can't be there when we get there he's cast out so he becomes incarnate Amen in the Beast he becomes a man of sin right paragraph 160 the four seal I want you to notice the four of them notice the off Mark of four of the spiritual mathematics God is streets this is four he's in four here first Antichrist white Now read it look at it first Antichrist white that's the White Horse second false prophet red that's your second s third vior of heavens and earth and purgatory black now I got my numbers wrong with the red the white is the first seal right red is the second seal the black is the third seal right and the fourth is the Beast Pale Horse Satan being kicked out of heaven you want to read that Revelation 1213 Satan being kicked out of heaven then in Revelations 13:1 he is Incarnate in the person of the Beast he's the Antichrist just a teaching called niol then he comes from that to a false prophet if he's an antichrist Antichrist is against anything that's against God's word is against God because the word is God okay amen there the reason he didn't receive a just a crown with Bo and no ARS right now this is a repeat of 301 I want to read 301 and 303 this is a repeat so it's on your things double repeat paragraph 301 through 303 of the first seal notice when nicadan spirit is finally he's incarnate in a man then he's crowned then he starts off as a nicadan spirit in the church he's a spirit you can't Crown the spirit but 300 years later be he become a pop and then they crowned him he had no Crown to start with but he got a crown later see when that Spirit became incarnate see that's in the PO now that's not the Incarnate Beast right listen and he a man ni and Doctrine become a man then they could crown it they couldn't do it because he was just a Doctrine notice when this holy spirit that we have becomes incarnate in us the one that's in our midst now the form of the Holy Ghost becomes incarnate in Us in the person of Jesus Christ we'll crown him King of Kings that's the way Satan learned that to be the beast when God becomes incarnate in you and I Satan will know how to do it so he just comes right to that false prophet deal right and that Pope becomes Satan incarnate now remember about the time Christ come on the throne the Antichrist come on the throne Judas about the time Christ went off the Earth Judas went off the Earth just about the time the Holy Spirit Come Back the Antichrist come back you see John said over here little children I would not have you ignorant you know about the Antichrist which is already come and working in the children of Disobedience the Antichrist then there he was began to form in there the nickan spirit to make an organization no wonder I hated that thing now listen to your Prophet see there you are it wasn't me and see people thinks he hates organized religion churches you he doesn't hate that he hates organized religion right right no wonder I hated that thing see there you are it wasn't me it was something in here there's the thing it's come out you see it I was all around the side of it I couldn't see it till now are you read MH is what your Prophet said I know it now there it is that nickan Spirit God hated and now that Spirit become incarnate they crown it and here it right here in the Bible did they do with it perfect even he didn't see it amen right he couldn't understand why he was seemingly against NOP organized religion so much right when the seals broke they showed him that's right sure did I hope you understand what I mean what I'm trying to say that's right you think I can't be deceived by an antichrist Spirit we already was yes amen the prophet had problems with it he said I didn't know it till just now right he said I'd have made a horrible mistake right if the Lord hadn't to come down and corrected me on what I fixing to R cuz he's going to preach the white horse rider right as a holy ghost no that's what he already sa now maybe a time like in Daniel said weeks he mentions about the Antichrist and the being the I think it's in that one there's one back there I know that he mentions that like the white horse rider would be the the Antichrist but see he didn't see it until it opened in the seals do you understand right right what he say what you understand the four stages man see it's Antichrist prophet incarnate false prophet What Spirit incarnate in a man make him a pope but that Pope still is not the man of sin right he's not dead until we get out of here right now you caught what I'm saying the first seal says that there was a man on that horse right right a rider on the horse y right a man right mhm that's second th Ians yeah that's the Antichrist in its fullness right amen we see where it come from that's right yes sir the man of sin sitting in the temple of God is not a baby Doctrine what is that Paul said in the children of Disobedience and some way let's see what brother around say I'm trying to paraphrase it he said if you think that this deceiving in the children he said what about when it becomes an adult if it started out deceiving what do you think it is now man that's right yes sir now you see all of these doctrines of the people in this message y out of one message thousands of doctrines ain't that mixed up in a good Baptist Church right who was it now they said Paul Harvey did I don't know said he said one day he said them brand Ms are not a cult cuz they don't follower their leader yeah exactly right that's right listen Church don't think you're ever a match for the devil no sir amen I don't care who you are or who I am brother brandham was not a match for the devil that's right amen amen it takes the Holy Spirit to be a match for the day amen even as we're showing in Daniel 70 weeks even the great Gabriel that brought the message to Mary of the birth of Jesus Christ was not able to handle right Satan yep Christ had to come to his rescue amen that's right now I don't think they got out there know good crate kid you know if you want to get in trouble in a lot of places look people dead in the eye you better be ready to back up what you're doing but if you really got the goods you back him you just stand look him straight in the eye right y if you know what you're doing in this message I don't mind looking anybody straight in ey right amen you'll see them start turning their head yeah why because they can't stand it it's not a pressured fight it's not kicking pops and you know boxing and stuff even Satan and Gabriel wasn't doing that is just he was holding him Michael just walked in yep you didn't have to hit nobody no that's right he just walked in his presence came in right brother Brown says if you want his presence I reading it yesterday he said just start talking about him he said you start talking about him said he'll come amen right why do you think brother Dale stood 40 something years and preached with a challenge if I'm wrong come and show me right you know there ain't none of these other preachers that you know of is going to do it because I might be the one that goes to see them if they put out that not trying to prove nothing but one thing a man's got the goods he ain't no problem with him being tested right right right because you see my points always been what if I'm right I'm right if I'm wrong and got the right Spirit then I can be corrected amen and I will be helped so then what do you think about the Antichrist you realize the first time we read the seal book now I know one brother he said I seen myself as that white horse rider riding on that white horse and then it went to the red and I went through my life and I I just couldn't stand it I got it behind him I said listen according to the prophet that white horse rider Antichrist thing is a Theon beast that's untameable y That's the words of your Prophet that Theon Beast can't be converted cannot that Antichrist Spirit can't be converted that person that's a false prophet to an antichrist system won't be converted nen that incarnate false prophet to the pope you think you got much hopes of getting him converted what about when he becomes the man of sin a man walks into the temple over there where Israel has done started back with their Temple worship done build a temple and he walks into the temple declaring himself to be absolutely God then they'll see that they failed and when they do you beave around the world absolutely I try let's stand I hope you catch the four stages amen Antichrist oh Antichrist Prophet incarnate false prophet is a f and in the Beast you said well I can't be deceived brother Dale you know a lot of people can't be helped but that don't mean we stop that's right amen that means we keep preaching until Christ comes and we keep trying to show Christ in our lives where they can see Jesus Christ right what do we what do we got 596 in the spal book
