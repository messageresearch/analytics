[0:04] put it in
[0:18] Pocket now young Dr Wade
[0:23] Dale well you got both barrels now you
[0:26] get the half pound
[0:28] so or bless each and every one of you
[0:31] thank you for being attentative we
[0:35] are lucky and privileged to be living in
[0:37] this end
[0:38] time that where God can show us things
[0:41] and he can reveal to us the
[0:45] secrets the in between the
[0:48] lines the things that he he he wants to
[0:50] tell us and I think that's what these 70
[0:53] weeks are all
[0:55] about Dad
[0:57] covered the Daniel 70 weeks chart
[1:00] which I have the letter from Brother
[1:01] George Smith I'll go ahead and call his
[1:03] name brother George Smith's wife is the
[1:05] one who drew this for brother Bram you
[1:07] know that amen all
[1:09] right not this one but the one dad
[1:11] showed but I'm going to use this one
[1:12] it's exactly the same way we're just
[1:14] putting little emphasis points in there
[1:17] okay is that all right go this the same
[1:21] all
[1:21] right brother George Smith said it is
[1:24] accurate she just added a few little
[1:26] things which was the cross was not
[1:28] connected it was setting up in the air
[1:30] and she connected it just some little
[1:32] things she did not change anything that
[1:36] that brother brandham preached on during
[1:38] the 70 weeks so I hope you understand it
[1:40] what the two things we were trying to do
[1:42] what D did is he was showing you that
[1:45] the chart the Bible and the quotes from
[1:48] The Daniel 70 weeks book are correct
[1:51] they
[1:52] fit what you believe it or not they fit
[1:55] amen he showed it to you from the Bible
[1:57] and prophet's message and the chart that
[1:59] they fit now what I'm going to do is I'm
[2:02] going to show you that I'm going to show
[2:04] you the parable the underlying meaning
[2:07] or redemption in the 70 weeks because if
[2:10] you can't see redemption in everything
[2:12] that we do if you can't see
[2:15] Redemption then you're still lost amen
[2:18] but if you see Redemption that means
[2:19] you're redeemable right you can be
[2:22] redeemed So Daniel 9:24 70 weeks are
[2:25] determined upon thy people now
[2:28] look we're going to C
[2:30] something that maybe you've never heard
[2:32] before and that's okay cuz remember I'm
[2:36] his son so I've heard it as long as he's
[2:38] been preaching
[2:39] it but we're going to look and break it
[2:42] down into three different groups and
[2:43] we'll show you in just a minute but I
[2:44] want you to look at this I've never
[2:46] heard anyone number one preach on Daniel
[2:48] 7 weeks except dad and brother Claude
[2:50] wer out in Oklahoma and
[2:53] myself just not been around maybe but
[2:57] look what it says 70 weeks are
[2:58] determined upon thy people and upon thy
[3:01] holy city right there's a Redemption to
[3:05] the city amen as well as the people
[3:09] exactly all right to finish to do what
[3:13] six things to finish the transgression
[3:14] making of sin reconciliation for
[3:16] iniquity bringing Everlasting
[3:17] righteousness seal up the vision
[3:19] prophecy and anoint the most holy and
[3:20] I'm going to ask you right now cuz I'm
[3:22] going to throw some points in here and
[3:23] I'm going to I'm going to go a little
[3:24] bit faster probably than that is
[3:27] did but do we all
[3:30] agree that the six-fold purpose happens
[3:33] in the 70 weeks of Daniel
[3:36] Amen oh yeah
[3:40] right agree or disagree it's the Bible
[3:42] amen it's the Bible Bible says 70 weeks
[3:45] are determined upon thy people who the
[3:47] Jews the Holy City Jerusalem to do what
[3:50] six things keep this in mind six seals
[3:54] finishes our Redemption sixfold purpose
[3:56] finishes their Redemption amen amen all
[3:59] right and we'll parallel that in just a
[4:01] few minutes so scrolling them up to a
[4:03] parable we're going to read this again
[4:04] but we're going to read one that Dad
[4:05] didn't read it's a metaphor it's a
[4:07] metaphor or metaphorically is a
[4:09] comparing or comparison of one thing
[4:11] with another likeness or similitude an
[4:13] example of by which a
[4:16] Doctrine or precept is Illustrated right
[4:19] all right so now let's go to the first
[4:22] quote and read just in the
[4:25] highlighted areas now I don't have this
[4:28] I don't have the quotes for you to have
[4:29] I've got some but but we're taping this
[4:31] and you're welcome to have it it is
[4:34] public
[4:35] domain you don't have to call us and ask
[4:38] for a
[4:39] copyright that was a
[4:41] joke God wrote it in
[4:44] riddles okay I guess we're supposed to
[4:46] be real serious today yes I don't have
[4:50] many serious bones in my body God's
[4:52] wrote it in riddles and Parable so that
[4:54] he could hide it from the eyes of the
[4:56] wise and prudent and reveal it to babies
[4:58] such as will learn all right that's go
[5:00] number three in the 70 weeks of Daniel
[5:03] now we know the scripture cannot lie now
[5:04] some of these Dad read but we're going
[5:05] to read them over again you know what it
[5:07] takes 17 times before you can remember
[5:08] something right right we got you twice
[5:11] 15 more times and we'll get you yeah so
[5:14] now but see also though if you look at
[5:17] it visually you you can reduce that okay
[5:21] now we know the scriptures cannot lie
[5:23] they have to be truth and if this Angel
[5:25] Gabriel came and told Daniel that
[5:26] there's only 70 weeks left for the Jews
[5:29] now we would apply that to 6 days or 7
[5:31] Day weeks but in Prophecy it's always
[5:34] given in Parables now I want to go to
[5:37] one Parable and we if we have time at
[5:39] the end this really excuse me my voice
[5:42] is going out somebody get me some
[5:46] water watch this in Genesis here is your
[5:50] parallel this is a very wonderful
[5:54] Parable and Jacob loved
[5:57] Rachel and said I will serve the seven
[6:00] years for Rachel thy younger
[6:04] daughter what does 27 say fulfill her
[6:08] week right brother br's not the only one
[6:10] that come up with one week equal 7 years
[6:13] it's in the Bible people it's in the
[6:15] Bible brother R can't get anything
[6:17] outside of the Bible amen fulfill her
[6:20] week amen thank you Bab appreciate that
[6:24] fulfill her week what seven years and we
[6:27] will give thee this also for the service
[6:29] which now sh sered with me yet seven
[6:31] other
[6:33] years we'll get to the rest of the story
[6:35] in just a minute but if you'll
[6:38] remember he got the older one right Leah
[6:43] amen the older one yeah Rachel was the
[6:46] one he already had his eye on he was
[6:48] already looking at Rachel he was wanting
[6:50] Rachel he was wanting the bride he was
[6:51] wanting the Gentile bride but he got
[6:54] Israel first right right think about
[6:58] this now until until we get finished
[7:00] Rachel had two children
[7:03] yes
[7:05] Joseph and
[7:08] who
[7:11] represent Parable wow all right let's
[7:16] go so now we're going to look at
[7:18] Redemption of three groups of people
[7:19] number one is going to be the Gentiles
[7:21] that's us two we're going to see Israel
[7:24] which make that plain 144,000 and thy
[7:28] holy C cuz didn't it say that didn't it
[7:30] say thy holy city 70 weeks are
[7:33] determined upon the people and the
[7:36] city because Jerusalem has been
[7:40] destroyed some 17 times even since since
[7:44] Jesus's time so since Titus destroyed it
[7:46] they just destroy that place and and
[7:48] just keep destroying it all right let's
[7:49] go so we're going to keep that in your
[7:51] mind cuz watch and I saw when for all
[7:54] the cause whereby backsliding Israel
[7:56] committed adultery I had put her away
[7:59] and give her a bill of divorce yet her
[8:01] treacherous sister Judah fear not but
[8:03] went and play the Harlot also return ye
[8:05] back sliden children that's Jeremiah
[8:07] 3:22 and I will heal your backsliding
[8:10] behold we come unto thee for thou art
[8:13] the Lord Our God all right I'm starting
[8:14] with Israel Israel backslid committed
[8:18] adultery and what did he do he gave her
[8:20] a bill of divorcement and what put her
[8:22] away right but he says I cannot forget
[8:24] her he's not going to forget her it's
[8:28] like Dad said if that if it were true
[8:30] this line would go over here and you and
[8:32] I wouldn't be in the picture exactly but
[8:34] he wanted a gentile bride so he had to
[8:36] that's the engrafting folks of the of
[8:38] the branch right the engrafting of the
[8:41] Gentiles all right so Redemption three
[8:44] people Gentiles
[8:47] 144,000 and we must bring the city into
[8:50] view all right let's go number four now
[8:54] now that let's outline Daniel 70 of week
[8:56] now I might repeat here again Ministers
[8:58] of the Gospel if you disagree with this
[9:00] all right they are divided into three
[9:03] periods now does everybody SE three
[9:05] periods on the board yes a 7 a 62 and a
[9:08] seven right now that's
[9:11] Bible That's Bible yeah right amen
[9:17] that's the prophet's message and that's
[9:19] that chart amen that first the seven we
[9:23] period Then a three score and twoe which
[9:25] is 62 and then a onee period they're
[9:27] divided into three different periods now
[9:28] I've got it divided here on the board
[9:31] the first period second period and to my
[9:35] understanding by the gospel by the holy
[9:38] spirit that the end time God returns
[9:40] again to the Jews now you can say what
[9:43] you want to I think he's pointing to
[9:45] that last week that's what he's pointing
[9:47] at amen what else would he be pointing
[9:49] at that's when he returns to the Jews
[9:51] he's not right it's not right here it's
[9:53] right here right God returned again the
[9:56] Jews now we know all about the gospel
[9:57] that Paul taught and others that God
[9:59] return again to the Jew well then if
[10:01] he's going to return again to the Jew
[10:02] how can we apply it back in Daniel's
[10:05] time we've got to apply it in this last
[10:09] age amen and it's after the Gentile
[10:12] church has been gone cuz he deals with
[10:15] Israel as a nation we as an individual
[10:17] all right number five now here we go
[10:20] again now this I'm going to go over it
[10:23] just real briefly
[10:24] because Dad went over it real well and
[10:27] and I hope you get it
[10:29] because it's very very important now
[10:31] Jesus Messiah wrote Into the City of
[10:32] Jerusalem Triumph on the back of a white
[10:34] mu on Palm Sunday April the 2nd ad30
[10:38] Jesus rode in Jerusalem on Palm Sunday
[10:40] ad30 and now from BC 445 to ad30 is
[10:44] exactly 475 years now we've he he's
[10:47] already covered that April the 2nd we
[10:50] prove
[10:52] 830 is on also here right that's where
[10:56] brother Brown Put 8030 right he didn't
[10:59] put
[11:00] 33 he put 830 and a cross right yes
[11:05] that's where Jesus died on the cross in
[11:09] ad30 all
[11:11] right
[11:13] now let's go to the next
[11:16] one now but remember this then Pro then
[11:19] prophets will prophesy 1,23 score days
[11:23] which is in the midst of the last week
[11:26] of the Jews now I want to bring this to
[11:28] a point right
[11:29] here you're going to see something that
[11:32] maybe you've never seen before inside
[11:35] here
[11:36] is a
[11:38] meaning that maybe you've not looked at
[11:41] before cuz if you read the book it is
[11:43] confusing but I'm going to prove by the
[11:44] sixfold purpose that that last week has
[11:47] to happen but see brother R in the
[11:50] Daniel 70 weeks book says week of the
[11:53] Jews he even calls it the Jewish week
[11:56] right he never called it a messiah week
[11:59] right he called it a Jewish week a
[12:01] Jewish week a week of the Jews everybody
[12:05] got it so far amen all right then
[12:07] they're cut
[12:09] off now look after three that's where
[12:12] they prophesy right there right yeah
[12:14] then they're cut
[12:15] off and then what did he say and the
[12:18] Armageddon sits in all right so now
[12:20] let's go to the next one now someone
[12:24] brought this to my attention the other
[12:27] day watch
[12:30] if you want to get technical about
[12:32] it and after three score in two weeks
[12:36] shall Messiah be cut off after 62 weeks
[12:39] right there right shall Messiah be cut
[12:42] off and the people of the prince shall
[12:44] come and destroy the city in sanctuary
[12:47] all right and then thereof the flood and
[12:49] end War
[12:50] desolation someone said well after means
[12:54] that's where you get your people say
[12:55] that 830 is when he started his ministry
[12:57] and after pre St in two weeks so you got
[13:00] three and a half brother R never
[13:01] preached that it's not in the Bible and
[13:03] you don't have a quote for it right so
[13:06] it's ning
[13:08] void after if I'm going we're going to
[13:10] eat after this is over that's only an
[13:12] hour from now on March the 14th is when
[13:16] the edct went forth to rebuild right 445
[13:20] BC March the
[13:22] 14th Jesus was crucified on April the
[13:26] 7th according to what the prophet said
[13:30] April the 2nd was Palm Sunday he was
[13:32] dead on Friday right right right five
[13:36] more days this is Elementary all right
[13:40] so there's no time after he died April
[13:43] 7th
[13:44] ad30 uh you know I'm like d said I've
[13:47] got stacks of papers where where 830 is
[13:50] used many many times and we saw in that
[13:54] uh where he put it on there 803 excuse
[13:56] me 833 is used because is using another
[13:59] calendar but to make the 483 years you
[14:03] got to stop at 8030 you can't have 3 and
[14:05] 1/2 more years right are the Bible's
[14:08] wrong the prophets wrong and the quotes
[14:11] are wrong all right so three is a
[14:13] witness so now if we see this and we're
[14:18] going to assume that after three score
[14:22] and two weeks so after March the 14th if
[14:24] you carried all the 62 weeks after March
[14:27] the 14th in ad30 he was crucified April
[14:31] the 2 well that was after March the 14th
[14:34] right so after 62 weeks could have just
[14:36] been one day after 62 weeks the
[14:39] messiah's cut off all right now here is
[14:43] where you're just going to have to go
[14:45] with me for a minute Jesus started his
[14:49] ministry we proved there a few minutes
[14:53] ago on the River Jordan when he was
[14:56] becoming 30 years old is that correct
[14:59] right 29 and a half now he was 33 years
[15:03] old when he died right the chart Pro
[15:06] that BC 4 4 BC even Usher in your Bible
[15:10] Usher and several other commentaries
[15:13] prove that because of Herod being Ding
[15:16] and all that that Jesus was born 4 BC so
[15:19] 4 BC to 8030 is exactly 33 years so he
[15:22] was 33 years old when he died so he
[15:25] started his ministry three and A2 years
[15:28] before that right amen simple prise the
[15:33] Lord River
[15:35] Jordan 3 and 1/2 years
[15:38] later so you would say
[15:40] October probably
[15:42] ad26 he started his ministry preached
[15:45] three and A2 three preached three and
[15:47] 1/2 years died at 33 years old in April
[15:51] there is your
[15:56] first three and A2 years
[15:59] of Messiah Ministry amen I want you to
[16:02] listen to my words Messiah ministry
[16:06] right I didn't say Jewish I said Messiah
[16:09] Ministry amen not after the cross he
[16:12] can't preach while he's
[16:14] dead because roll
[16:18] it because look even this proves
[16:23] it then Peter call said Lord how off
[16:26] shall we daddy read this but I'm going
[16:27] to read it again I say
[16:29] how how many forgive forgiveness is
[16:31] redemption right right if you're
[16:33] forgiven you're redeemed right amen
[16:36] right
[16:38] Peter then how can I forgive him till
[16:41] seven times Jesus said no 70 * 7 which
[16:46] is 490 if there's 483 years to right
[16:50] here gentlemen there's one week left
[16:53] that's seven years to finish the 490
[16:57] years correct
[16:59] right this means yes yes sir amen okay
[17:02] you can nod a little louder if you want
[17:03] to and I can hear you so he was cut off
[17:06] April the 7th
[17:09] ad30 Isaiah
[17:11] 53 proves all that also we don't have
[17:14] time to get into it uh the sixfold
[17:16] purpose um man you can lay those right
[17:19] in with the seals but we'll try to do
[17:20] something with them in just a few
[17:22] minutes that maybe it will help you all
[17:25] right so now let's look at Redemption
[17:28] we've come up to this point because
[17:30] Redemption didn't start we know
[17:32] Redemption was over before the
[17:33] foundation of the world okay but it had
[17:35] to be applied at Calvary amen had to be
[17:39] applied at Calvary amen it wasn't
[17:42] received it was applied pardon is not a
[17:45] pardon unless it's accepted as a pardon
[17:48] all right so
[17:50] now now remember he was cut off the side
[17:54] Jew God ceed to deal with them they did
[17:57] not go any farther then they were
[18:00] scattered by the Roman Empire and have
[18:02] you noticed on my chart here that says
[18:05] what ad 70 I want you to get this now
[18:08] and draw it you notice here where I got
[18:11] the
[18:13] cross that's where they rejected but the
[18:16] time extended out just a little bit
[18:18] further on that see why 30 40 50 60 70
[18:26] he didn't start at 3 and 1/2 and go 26
[18:29] and a
[18:31] half he's going whole years 30 years 40
[18:36] 50 60 70 40 years later Titus the Roman
[18:41] general destroyed Israel Jerusalem and
[18:42] Scattered the people all over the world
[18:44] you see tius 40 years
[18:47] later that can't be
[18:49] 833 as far as what the prophet is
[18:52] telling us right by this chart and by
[18:54] the calendar it had to be 830 because
[18:57] you've messed up to
[18:59] ad70 you're you don't have 40 years into
[19:02] the into Titus destroying Rome you see
[19:05] Titus I mean destroying Jerusalem Titus
[19:07] 40 years later so actually the Jewish
[19:09] time extended till the complete God
[19:12] wasn't dealing with them he only dealt
[19:14] with them until they rejected Christ
[19:16] then they crucified Christ they said let
[19:18] his blood be on us and our children
[19:22] that's what their problem's been the
[19:23] whole time all right we'll get into that
[19:25] on sixfold purpose because he's got to
[19:27] redeem that back yes he's got to redeem
[19:31] that group back
[19:32] right let his blood be on us and our
[19:35] children and it's been ever since but
[19:37] before they got scattered listen old
[19:39] brother before they got all scattered to
[19:41] all the world it took God about 40 years
[19:43] to tear up the
[19:46] temple that's where the holy City's got
[19:48] to come from sure they're going to
[19:49] establish Temple worship here on Earth
[19:52] but Jesus well God in the scripture says
[19:55] sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest
[19:57] not but a body these offerings have
[20:00] become a stink in my nostril God is not
[20:02] going to bless natural Israel over there
[20:05] right now trying to do Temple worship
[20:07] cuz God's not there God's not there
[20:11] they're going to establish Temple
[20:12] worship they're going to kill the goat
[20:14] they're just waiting on the red heer
[20:16] right now and from and from what we're
[20:18] reading on the internet they're within
[20:20] just a few hairs of getting that red
[20:21] heer genetically and you know where
[20:24] they're raising them United States
[20:27] yeah
[20:30] we anyway you can go any way with that
[20:33] if you want to but they're going to
[20:35] they're going to try to establish Temple
[20:37] worship and they will brother Rand I'll
[20:38] read you a quote right here they're
[20:39] going to when we're out of here they're
[20:41] going to establish Temple
[20:42] worship but now they're not going to the
[20:45] 144,000 is not going to amen that's
[20:48] what's going to get the 144,000 killed
[20:51] right the Jews have spent all these
[20:54] 2,000 years trying to get everything
[20:56] together and they're going to start
[20:57] making sacrifices and there's going to
[20:58] be a group of people a bunch of nuts are
[21:00] going to walk in the temple and go
[21:02] hey God's not there anymore he's right
[21:06] here he's right here yes and they're
[21:09] going to hate them 144,000 the Jews are
[21:11] going to kill them the people United
[21:14] States is not going to kill them their
[21:15] own people's going to kill them right
[21:18] old brother Butz they got all scattered
[21:20] it take God 40 years to tear up the
[21:22] temple and scatter them out to all the
[21:23] world but now
[21:25] remember if this is not true God Waits
[21:28] four script four chapters in The Bible
[21:30] in Ezekiel 40-44 brother said that was
[21:32] the Millennium temple being
[21:35] built not to make sacrifices anymore
[21:38] right but remember the Millennium is for
[21:39] the Jews right we're there in a
[21:42] honeymoon we don't go down there and
[21:43] build anything all right but we'll get
[21:45] into that in a minute but God failed to
[21:47] deal with them anymore God failed to
[21:48] deal with them anymore he went dealing
[21:51] with us right you know that understand
[21:55] it now now here we start in the church
[21:56] AG is the Gentile time God away from the
[22:00] Jews now there's your seven Church ages
[22:02] we don't need to go into that
[22:05] because you and I are a part of that
[22:07] amen all right let's go to the next
[22:09] one in the 70 weeks God showed John
[22:12] exactly what would take place during the
[22:14] Gentile Reign now we haven't got any
[22:17] time limited time like the Jews but we
[22:21] got a sign right we got a sign post what
[22:24] God did with the Jews that's exactly
[22:26] what he said he would do in them six 69
[22:28] years are 483 years but 69 weeks and one
[22:33] week left one week's yet determined to
[22:37] the Jews right exactly now we cannot
[22:40] apply it in here I believe he's poting
[22:43] right here cuz this is
[22:46] Gentile right all right so the whole
[22:48] week's got to be after we're gone that's
[22:50] right dealing with the Jews GL not the
[22:54] Messiah we you there's going to be a
[22:56] difference and I'll show it to you in
[22:57] just a second
[22:59] now this is Revelations beginning with
[23:00] the first chapter to the third chapter
[23:03] takes us over what to lay a all right
[23:06] let's go right I'm not going to I'm not
[23:09] going to use any of my notes Here I had
[23:10] some notes to read off but I'm not going
[23:12] to read them off I'm just going to keep
[23:13] doing this okay now what happened look
[23:16] over the top of this last Church age see
[23:18] this little extension I want you to
[23:19] remember here is another key if you want
[23:21] to write this down key number one was
[23:23] thy city right key number two is lap
[23:27] over amen MH how many times you're
[23:30] ministers you're not lady you're
[23:32] ministers amen how many times did
[23:34] Brother Brown say lap over yes sir many
[23:38] how do you build a step you got to lap
[23:41] it over the first one to get to the next
[23:43] one right so lap over lap over we're
[23:47] going to see like the battle of
[23:48] Armageddon folks the battle of
[23:49] Armageddon is not going to be a one day
[23:51] battle right amen that's an atomic
[23:53] battle that's going to last for a for a
[23:55] length of time that's right all right
[23:58] that's where all this is going to come
[23:59] in right here but we'll look at it this
[24:02] thing now what's happened look up over
[24:04] the top of this last Church J see this
[24:05] extension the Gentile days are finished
[24:07] and for the last 40 years the Jews has
[24:10] been returning now that little lap over
[24:12] is right there got it the Jews have been
[24:14] returning to Jerusalem going back to the
[24:16] Homeland see where we're at it took 40
[24:18] years from the cutting off of the
[24:19] Messiah to Titus destroyed the temple
[24:21] and Scattered the Jews then it spend
[24:23] another 40 now to get the Jews back
[24:26] together all right let's go to the next
[24:27] one
[24:29] now our Kinsman is handed the seven seal
[24:32] book of redemption right kind of funny
[24:34] he's talking about Redemption and it's
[24:36] talking about Gabriel's instruction to
[24:38] Daniel he's showing us a parable here
[24:41] and the lamb came and took the book out
[24:42] of the right hand and sent up upon the
[24:44] throne who was the lamb the Redeemer our
[24:46] kinsman redeemer the Kinsmen to the
[24:48] church who come and redeemed Israel yes
[24:52] now we're going to get into that this
[24:54] morning Israel was redeemed but it was
[24:56] not applied to them cuz they rejected
[24:59] him but the church received their
[25:00] Redemption amen we received that 3 and
[25:03] 1/2 year Ministry amen right amen they
[25:06] were blinded from that 3 and 1/2 year
[25:08] Ministry we received that 3 and 1/2 year
[25:10] Ministry and if I have enough time I'm
[25:12] going to show you that it parallels with
[25:14] the last part of brother Brown's
[25:18] Ministry the Revelation exactly see that
[25:22] really there's only 3 and 1/2 years that
[25:23] Jesus preached he didn't preach 7 years
[25:25] that's right he only preached 3 and 1/2
[25:26] years okay
[25:28] sir but but like with Rachel and Leah he
[25:31] worked seven years so you got to have
[25:33] seven years here you got to have seven
[25:34] years here uhhuh for Redemption of us
[25:38] and for Redemption of Israel all right
[25:41] so we'll show that just a second as the
[25:42] Lord will it Israel was redeemed but it
[25:44] was not applied to them because they
[25:46] rejected him but the church received
[25:47] their Redemption and he is our kinsman
[25:50] redeemer as Boaz had to redeem Naomi in
[25:52] order to get Ruth the moabit is an alien
[25:55] Gentile so Christ redeemed Israel
[25:57] applied to rede Redemption and was
[25:59] rejected amen and Jesus redeemed Israel
[26:01] in Calvary but it was not a pardon to
[26:04] them because they did not receive it as
[26:06] the pardon but in our lesson now on
[26:08] these 70 weeks we find they come back
[26:11] and receive their pardon yeah but he
[26:13] redeemed the church when we are pardoned
[26:15] because we have received the blood of
[26:16] Jesus Christ as our pardon everybody
[26:19] okay with that amen okay this all should
[26:23] be old hat but it's kind of tying
[26:24] everything together showing you
[26:25] Redemption through the 7 weeks of Daniel
[26:28] now Pentecostal Brethren how can we
[26:30] apply it all over here in the last
[26:32] Church
[26:33] age that's us they're sleeping through
[26:36] every one of these ages waiting and we
[26:37] which you're alive the little remaining
[26:39] Bunch remain alive until the coming of
[26:40] the Lord will not hinder those which are
[26:42] asleep for the trumpet of God shall
[26:44] sound the dead in Christ shall rise
[26:45] first and we should be caught up
[26:47] together with them amen with them here
[26:48] we are meeting right here to go to meet
[26:50] the Lord in the air what's he saying
[26:52] right here right rapturing Saints right
[26:54] all this right here amen and there you
[26:57] are where we at right here where did the
[27:01] Messiah get cut off exactly where the
[27:03] word said right here right where will
[27:06] that 70th Week
[27:10] begin exactly after this church is cut
[27:15] off
[27:16] right then God returns to the Jews amen
[27:20] the next thing in order is the coming of
[27:22] the kingdom of God you remember as soon
[27:23] as the church age goes and the Jews take
[27:25] hold they come in but first and thing in
[27:27] order is not a mighty nation or a
[27:29] national Revival the next thing in order
[27:31] for us is the coming of the kingdom of
[27:34] God the coming of Christ amen all right
[27:37] I want you to look at Point number two
[27:39] before we go to the next
[27:41] step we receive somebody said and
[27:44] brother Bill and I were sitting in a
[27:45] meeting last weekend and a brother a
[27:47] well-known brother made a comment that I
[27:50] don't know why everybody's making such a
[27:51] big deal about the 70 weeks of Danel
[27:53] because it's to the Jews well let's
[27:55] forget about the themselves too yeah
[27:57] right let's throw our seal book Away
[28:01] uhuh seals are not to us
[28:04] right from Revelations 4:1 to 19 is not
[28:09] to us amen all right but we get the
[28:13] spiritual application to get us out of
[28:16] here that's it if we don't take it and
[28:19] put it all together there's a gap and
[28:21] when there's a gap there's fear when
[28:24] there's fear there's doubt when there's
[28:26] doubt there's no body change right we
[28:30] got to be standing with perfect Faith
[28:32] glory to take a body change the next
[28:34] thing in orderers to come into kingdom
[28:35] of God the coming of Christ all right
[28:37] let's go to the next
[28:38] one now when when's God going to start
[28:41] their last week when it may be today it
[28:46] may be before the sun sets in sets
[28:48] tonight God will declare it and when it
[28:51] is I don't know right all right go to
[28:55] the next
[28:56] one now let's
[28:59] read and in the middle of this week now
[29:01] here's the 70 now this exactly with
[29:03] seven years each one of the
[29:05] weeks and we've already had 69 weeks not
[29:09] 69 and a half
[29:11] right we've already had 69 weeks then we
[29:15] have the Gentile age he said 69 weeks
[29:17] Gentile age then there's one more week
[29:21] left for the Jew right amen all right
[29:26] right I hope you're seeing this it's a
[29:29] beautiful picture if you can see it
[29:30] right
[29:32] amen is that right and that's exactly
[29:36] how long not 3 and 1/2 years 7 years
[29:39] right all right if this was 7 years
[29:42] that's 7 years cuz he said there's 70
[29:44] weeks determined upon thy people so we
[29:47] know we got seven years for the
[29:50] Jews is that true now look at it if
[29:53] there's a question I want to know it and
[29:55] we'll probably get a bunch after lunch
[29:57] right now in the middle of the week in
[30:00] the middle of this Jewish exactly
[30:05] week everybody read that amen he didn't
[30:08] say Messiah week he didn't say the
[30:10] ministry of Jesus Christ right he said
[30:13] in the middle of this Jewish week
[30:15] amen that's three and A2 years the
[30:18] Antichrist the prince a prince that is
[30:20] to come and remember he comes out of
[30:22] Rome the prince that is to come what is
[30:24] he a pope a prince among the people
[30:26] that's true they up a pharaoh who
[30:28] doesn't know Joseph now what is he
[30:29] talking about he's talking about after
[30:31] the two prophets prophesy 1260 days
[30:34] right amen which is 3 and 1/2 years by
[30:37] the prophetic cant at the end of that
[30:40] the Antichrist breaks that Covenant
[30:43] right says no more Temple worship you
[30:45] can't do this you can't do that I'm
[30:46] taking over that's right the man of sin
[30:50] right the man of sin right all right so
[30:52] that's what he's saying but where is it
[30:53] in the middle of this Jewish weat right
[30:56] in there all
[30:59] right
[31:01] next what's these two prophets going to
[31:03] do when they come this Beast this Prince
[31:05] that shall scatter the power of the Holy
[31:07] people what will he do he'll break his
[31:09] Covenant with them after see they've got
[31:11] it highlighted right here we're talking
[31:12] about this last week all right right
[31:15] he'll break his Covenant with them after
[31:17] 3 and one2 years right he'll out them
[31:21] now people thinks that's communism
[31:23] that's just cuz you have the spirit of
[31:24] God hasn't dealt with you yet it's not
[31:26] communism
[31:27] it's
[31:29] religion religious demons it's not going
[31:32] to be uh Americans against notes and no
[31:36] it's going to be Protestants and
[31:38] Catholics now these two prophets what
[31:40] will they do it's Moses and Elijah

[31:44] those Jews they're mistak and out of
[31:46] that Jewish Bunch that's there now to be

[32:38] remember after Dan and Ephraim did what
[32:39] they did Joseph was put in so he's not

[33:01] picture we won't have time to do it but
[33:02] but go back and read Jacob and Rachel
[33:04] and Le just let God deal with you and
[33:06] buty you'll see this down 70 weeks open
[33:09] it's perfect cuz it's Redemption folks
[33:11] it's not all dates and times and season
[33:13] but you got to get your days right or
[33:15] you going to have a gap right here like
[33:17] a lot of people do they got a gap right
[33:18] here all right and he'll preach that
[33:21] they he'll preach the same message of
[33:23] Pentecost to those Jews that they
[33:24] rejected the Messiah man you see it
[33:27] it'll be the same Pentecostal message
[33:28] that these Jews will preach right over
[33:30] to them and they'll hate those Jews so
[33:32] bad till they'll kill them and they were
[33:34] hated by all nations in the midst of the
[33:37] week right oh yeah
[33:39] exactly right there midst of the week
[33:42] right in there remember there's lifeover
[33:44] time it's not that battle of Armageddon
[33:46] it's just like the church it's like the
[33:47] U um virtu it's not faith in a straight
[33:52] line and virtue in another straight line
[33:54] knowledge in a straight line all that
[33:56] those l lines are for reference amen you
[33:59] get Faith all through there you get

[34:08] on shelf no you just keep growing in
[34:09] Grace and knowledge same thing with this
[34:11] that line is just a reference line
[34:12] because that's the middle of the last
[34:14] week right all right and they were hated
[34:17] by all nations in the midst of the week
[34:19] because that they had raised up a great
[34:20] power for 144,000 they had the Holy
[34:23] Ghost and brother you talking about
[34:24] doing Miracles see that's when the six

[34:39] brings him back to earth right yeah
[34:41] seven seal the end of all things and we
[34:43] get the we get the spiritual Revelation
[34:46] so that ends for us the Gentiles but
[34:48] he's got to go to the Jews and get them

[34:53] going to open naturally to them they're
[34:56] going to get a sixfold purpose which
[34:57] finishes their Redemption amen and the
[34:59] city that's right and brings Christ back
[35:02] to Earth in Revelations 19 not by
[35:05] himself with us amen cuz he's not going
[35:08] to be seen without us anymore after we
[35:11] go with him right and they were hated by
[35:13] All Nations they had the Holy Ghost and
[35:15] brother you talking about doing Miracles
[35:16] they did they stopped heavens and didn't
[35:18] rain in the days of their prophecy smoke
[35:19] the Earth with plagues L as they wanted
[35:21] to they gave plages and everything else
[35:23] they'll give them Romans a hard way to
[35:25] go amen praise the Lord finally right
[35:29] but finally they'll be killed right what
[35:31] after they prophesy for three and a half
[35:34] years correct all
[35:37] right that's where we seen her coming

[35:57] going on for us amen all right now
[36:00] notice that's where we seen her coming
[36:02] back to the Millennium Temple over here
[36:04] at the end I'm going to prove it just a
[36:07] minute of the Jewish age Glory he didn't
[36:11] say Messi we he's talking about the
[36:13] natural Jews right
[36:15] right or the 144,000 to be correct the
[36:19] anointed here he comes riding on a white
[36:21] horse now when is that Revelations 19
[36:24] right right the those followed him on
[36:27] white horses who are you and I dressed
[36:30] in white blood are V in blood ruing him
[36:32] the word of God he cometh the mighty
[36:34] conqueror to set up the Millennium
[36:36] coming to the temple amen amen that
[36:40] Temple God's not going to come to
[36:43] you and dwell in an unclean vessel right
[36:46] so he's not going to go to that Temple
[36:47] unless it's built right the right way
[36:50] according to Ezekiel
[36:52] 40-44 right and I just believe 144,000
[36:56] is going to come back here and build it
[36:57] right we're not going to build it we're
[36:59] here on a honeymoon you you take your
[37:00] wife on a honeymoon build make her build
[37:02] a
[37:05] house you went there as a feast as a
[37:08] wedding as a as a happy time for you and
[37:10] your and your new and your new spouse
[37:13] we're not going to go back and and do
[37:15] that stuff they're going to build it
[37:17] we'll prove it in a second Glory there
[37:19] he meets that see coming to the temple
[37:22] there he meets that 144,000 they're
[37:24] already here right revelation 19 we come
[37:27] cuz remember the Millennium is to the
[37:29] Jews not to us but somebody's got to
[37:32] live a th years to do away with a sin
[37:33] curs now you and I are glorified bodies
[37:36] right we're in eternity we can't live A
[37:38] Thousand Years we're already Eternal
[37:40] right so somebody's got to live that
[37:42] Thousand Years somebody's got to prove
[37:44] that sin curse is over so it really
[37:46] doesn't matter when we come riding back
[37:47] in we're going right to that Temple amen
[37:50] after the 144,000 building we're going
[37:52] right to it right all right everybody
[37:54] understand that kind of sort of
[37:57] amen if some of you moved I think your
[37:59] faceing
[38:01] crack we ought to be happy about this
[38:03] people

[38:06] wrong or not you ought to be rejoicing
[38:08] if you're right you ought to be
[38:09] rejoicing amen amen
[38:12] exactly it's I get a little bit from him
[38:15] you know blame him I got his get at
[38:18] right all right let's go to the next
[38:20] one and I really appreciate them matter
[38:24] of
[38:25] fact now listen to this just this is
[38:28] just a point because remember I heard
[38:30] the man clothed in linen Daniel 12: 7-9
[38:32] which was upon the Water of the river
[38:34] and when he held up his right hand and
[38:35] his left hand under heaven and swear by
[38:37] him that liveth forever you ever heard
[38:38] that before yes sir Revelations 10 right
[38:42] right but now remember the guy in
[38:44] Revelations 10 is time shall be no
[38:48] longer right that's to me and you right
[38:51] because we don't have times exactly but
[38:53] right here it shows for a Time
[38:58] times and a dividing of time three and a
[39:02] half years amen right everybody
[39:05] understand that is that okay and then he
[39:08] shall have accomplished to scatter the
[39:10] power of the Holy people after that

[41:15] time brother Claude wer brought this to
[41:18] my attention and he's a real good
[41:19] brother of mine very good friend I want
[41:21] you to
[41:22] listen now in when did brother R
[41:26] preached the S 63 March of 63 right
[41:31] March of 63 this may not mean one thing
[41:33] to you but it helps me all right it's
[41:36] not on there I'm going to read it off
[41:38] here so it's not on there they don't
[41:39] have it I know if I get
[41:42] to okay listen on communion if you want
[41:45] to write this down
[41:48] 19622 04 on the message communion
[41:52] right
[41:54] February 196 62 right brother BR priest
[41:58] in Jeffersonville we see that the
[42:00] astronomers are predicting sometime in
[42:02] this early part of the first part of the
[42:05] month beginning on the 2D or the 5th or
[42:07] somewhere along this month the Indian
[42:09] astronomers predict the worlds to blow
[42:11] to pieces and the American newspapers
[42:14] make fun of it I do not believe the
[42:16] world's going to blow into pieces but I
[42:18] do say it's wrong to make fun of it
[42:20] right because something's fixing to
[42:23] happen one of these days something
[42:25] similar to do that right when the five
[42:28] planets Mars Jupiter and Venus and so
[42:30] forth come into their there they never
[42:33] have did it oh they say 25,000 years ago
[42:36] it happened but who was back there to
[42:37] know it yeah that's a
[42:41] haha okay brother R said that who was
[42:44] there who was back there to know it but
[42:47] listen that was paragraph 74 paragraph
[42:49] 75 I pred I predict that this has a
[42:53] spiritual application Glory
[42:57] I believe it's the coming in of the
[42:58] issue of God
[43:02] right that the great revelation of the
[43:04] word will be open during this time right
[43:07] this is
[43:09] 1962
[43:11] February the great revelation of the
[43:13] word will be open during this time
[43:15] remember they claim it was three stars
[43:16] came in or when Jesus was born this is
[43:18] five five is the grave three is the
[43:20] number of perfection five is the number
[43:22] of Grace and so forth number of Grace if
[43:24] God ever sends his power of the church
[43:26] it's by his grace right God sends
[43:30] anything to us it'll be his grace not
[43:32] our Merit so so it may mean something I
[43:35] predict that there'll be a change I
[43:36] don't know what it'll be now this is
[43:39] 1962 we're right on the eve of it now
[43:42] Glory all right next message he preached
[43:45] was the end time seed sign 1962
[43:50] 319 just a
[43:52] 19 a month and a half later all right
[43:57] now what happened we see a roar in the
[43:59] paper across the
[44:00] television out across the Nations where
[44:03] five stars just fell in line with the
[44:05] world what's five the number of Grace
[44:07] every time those stars come then
[44:09] something happens on Earth what's taking
[44:11] place five stars fell in what was it an
[44:17] introducing of what right beginning of
[44:22] Sorrows earthquakes picked up everywhere
[44:26] what's happened an infant church
[44:30] amen hallelujah Glory a bride right
[44:34] infancy that the power of God has beg to
[44:37] fall yes sir on her right right that's
[44:40] right there your three and 1 half years
[44:42] right cuz he's Pro he's telling us she's
[44:46] taking form of Bride for this bridegroom
[44:51] right it's the Church of the Living God
[44:54] coming together under the word of God
[44:56] and the Astron astronomic Heaven is
[44:59] announcing her approach amen uhhuh glory
[45:03] might not believe that but it's the word
[45:05] just the same yes sir that was that was
[45:08] paragraph 78 so if you don't believe
[45:11] something
[45:13] happened listen to you Prophet that was
[45:16] in March of
[45:19] 62 March of 63 preached the Cs two 2
[45:23] years and 8 months later he died he buil
[45:27] God's got a lap over people right he's
[45:29] got a lap over that's right his message
[45:32] did start in the seals but there was
[45:34] platforms that he built foken word's
[45:36] Original Seed all these things statue of
[45:38] a perfect man what's he doing he was
[45:40] getting ready and then when that thing
[45:42] came out he said my
[45:45] gosh a baby Church's bar that's right
[45:48] out of that constellation shown in the
[45:51] heavens You and I by the word that he
[45:54] preached not saying that the word was
[45:55] was any less relevant before then not at
[45:59] all because that's your background
[46:01] that's your platform that's what you
[46:03] stand on to understand these other
[46:06] things all right it's time we start
[46:07] eating some meat quit drinking so much
[46:09] milk I like milk when but when I go to a
[46:11] state place I don't order just milk
[46:13] right I order a state I might have some
[46:17] milk but if it's a state there I'm Le
[46:20] Stak all right so you're going to give
[46:22] power to two prophets and they should
[46:23] prophesy a,3 2003 score days cloth and
[46:27] sackcloth
[46:29] so that's what they get right they get
[46:33] that three and a half year Ministry of
[46:34] Jesus Christ correct Messiah the sign of
[46:37] the Messiah the sign of the Messiah here
[46:39] I'm going to walk over and do this
[46:40] anyway the sign of the Messiah here the
[46:43] sign of the Messiah here brings Rachel
[46:45] together the sign of the Messiah the
[46:47] sign of the Messiah brings Leah together
[46:52] amen
[46:54] okay that's just my thought all right
[46:56] I'm reading between the lines today okay
[46:59] it's not your it's not if that love
[47:00] letter is not to you then you either got
[47:03] another lover you just ain't fell in
[47:05] love with mine yet so I don't know all
[47:07] right let's keep
[47:08] going Revelations 11: 9-12 and they of
[47:12] the people in Kindred and tongue and
[47:13] Nation shall see their dead bodies three
[47:15] days and a half kind of funny that they
[47:17] lay in the street for three and A2 days
[47:20] right it's not funny at all it means
[47:22] something but we can't get into that and
[47:23] shall not suffer their dead bodies be
[47:25] put in and they that dwell on the Earth
[47:26] shall rejoice am man they going to send
[47:28] each other gifts they going to send Bowl
[47:30] tickets and all kind of stuff to people
[47:32] uhhuh they going to send gifts to one
[47:34] another because these two prophets
[47:35] tormented them that dwelt on the earth
[47:36] and after 3 days and a half there's that
[47:39] word after again is it one day after two
[47:41] days after 10 years after it's after I
[47:44] say it's just going to be after the 3
[47:46] and 1/2 days the spirit of life from God
[47:49] entered into them they stood on their
[47:50] feet and great fear fell upon them which
[47:53] saw them right seeing in Fox News uhhuh
[47:58] that's the only time that can be made
[48:00] known nobody else can see that except in
[48:02] the end time exactly right see them yes
[48:05] see them all right and they heard a
[48:07] great voice from Heaven saying unto
[48:09] them didn't that happen in Revelations
[48:12] 4:1 didn't he say come up here uh that's
[48:15] right well he's telling them the same
[48:16] thing Glory so what puts us in a Rapture
[48:19] is going to put them in the Rapture all
[48:21] right and they heard a great voice from
[48:23] Heaven saying unto them come up hither
[48:25] and they ascended up to heaven in a
[48:27] cloud and their enemies beheld them and
[48:29] that was right there because what's
[48:32] going to happen after that I have quotes
[48:35] here the battle of Armageddon begins
[48:37] immediately after that right that's what
[48:39] it happens all right and the battle of
[48:42] Armageddon is not going to be a one- day
[48:44] battle that's right it's man's fire we
[48:47] walk out on the ashes of the wicked that
[48:49] doesn't happen in the future home right
[48:52] amen remember the city sits down on a
[48:54] redeemed entire Earth in the future home
[48:57] the Millennium we walk out in the ashes
[48:59] ashes means something burned up you say
[49:02] oh what about radiation you with a
[49:04] glorified body you already took a
[49:05] resurrection you already took a Rapture
[49:07] and you're worried about radiation I
[49:08] don't think so we're going to be
[49:10] brighter than any radiation will ever
[49:12] make amen yes we'll have it from the
[49:15] inside out not from the outside in
[49:17] that's right cuz see the Battle of our
[49:19] begin is going to be where man is going
[49:20] to be standing there alive and the flesh
[49:22] is going to fall off their body the
[49:24] scripture right that's right that's your
[49:25] battle Mar again that's not going to
[49:27] happen go and Magog that's totally
[49:28] different that's God's fire that's where
[49:30] you kill Souls that's right all right
[49:33] this one just kills the battle of
[49:34] Armageddon brother R said man's fire
[49:36] kills man's always destroyed the Earth
[49:38] right so now here's here's a couple of
[49:40] things just this is my quote six seals
[49:42] finishes our Redemption the seventh seal
[49:44] brings Christ back to the Earth to get
[49:46] us right not in the physical form but
[49:48] brother R said he'd be so visible Among
[49:49] Us raise the dead and join the Rapture
[49:51] that's quote right the sixfold purpose
[49:54] finishes 144 his Redemption and brings
[49:57] Christ back to the earth now he doesn't
[49:58] come back right here right right they're
[50:01] not bride that's
[50:03] right right they're not incarnate God
[50:06] like we
[50:08] are come on people they lost their right
[50:12] of being a wife I read you that when he
[50:16] divorc sir they're servants now all
[50:19] right so they're going to get the Holy
[50:20] Ghost and they're going to take a
[50:21] Rapture but they're not bright amen
[50:24] right that's right so where is he going
[50:26] to come
[50:27] back I'll show you in a minute all right
[50:30] let's go notice now exactly the
[50:32] continuity of the scripture exactly the
[50:34] same under the seventh trumpet see
[50:36] everybody's wondering about trumpets
[50:38] well the seventh trumpet is to Israel
[50:40] the same as the seventh seal was to the
[50:41] church amen which is what Revelations
[50:44] 11:15 and the seventh angel sounded and
[50:46] there were great voices in heaven saying
[50:48] the kingdoms of this
[50:49] world that's what we're going to say
[50:51] when we leave out of here Glory the
[50:53] kingdoms of this world right here
[50:56] yes have become the kingdoms of of our
[50:59] Lord and of his Christ and he shall
[51:01] reign forever and ever and that's
[51:04] exactly what he's going to do with the
[51:05] Jews so the seventh trumpet does what
[51:09] calls Israel back to the atonement not
[51:11] to kill another beast that's right to
[51:14] realize they missed him the first time
[51:16] that's and they'll say where did you get
[51:19] those scars he become so visible among
[51:22] them so they put sackcloth and Ashes
[51:25] they get out of that Temple they say hey
[51:27] them sacrifices are stening my nostrils
[51:29] right God's now dwelling here and
[51:32] they're going to be killed because of
[51:34] that so we can parallel and see that
[51:36] Redemption because the seven trumpet
[51:38] does what the seventh trumpet to the
[51:39] Jews draws them where to the atonement
[51:42] right right what is atonement Redemption
[51:45] right without an atonement you can't be
[51:48] redeemed all right everybody okay with
[51:51] that all right go to
[51:54] 15 theing end time ending of the Gentile
[51:58] dispensation he will
[52:01] prophesy in the 70th week which is three
[52:04] and 1/2 years and in the midst of it he
[52:06] shall be cut off which is 7 years 70
[52:09] weeks is determined for thy people 7
[52:11] years approximately to the Jews amen yes
[52:17] to the Jews right going keep going we
[52:19] got to get in a hurry here the Lamb of
[52:21] the Messiah the prince shall come and
[52:23] should be for 70 weeks that's 7 years
[52:25] that's what dad's trying to show you
[52:27] when brother
[52:28] brandom gets out of that Daniel 70 weeks
[52:31] book it's kind of like the Feast of the
[52:33] trumpets it's important but he never
[52:35] preached them again right he preached
[52:38] Daniel 7 weeks never preached them again
[52:39] hey those to the Jews right all right
[52:43] but he makes references to it but what
[52:44] he can't deny though that there's a
[52:47] messiah Weeden absolutely amen there's a
[52:51] messiah weat that's different from that
[52:53] Jewish wheat right that's right sir it's
[52:56] hidden inside there Glory right that's
[52:58] right right there
[53:01] right all right go with me just a second
[53:05] because see we're going to we're going
[53:07] to come outside the book Dad read a few
[53:10] of them see that's where everybody gets
[53:12] all confused brother said no no no n n n
[53:15] only three and a half what you talking
[53:17] about that right there the Messiah we
[53:19] he's in Redemption now Glory he's
[53:21] talking about Redemption that's the only
[53:23] Redemption that whole 7 weeks can be
[53:26] compressed into those that seven years
[53:30] yes sir three and 1/2 here that we get
[53:32] three and a half here that they get
[53:35] that's where you bring that mysterious
[53:37] weat that most people don't realize is
[53:41] there is everybody okay with that amen I
[53:45] don't have a quote for
[53:46] that but I read between the lines here
[53:50] because it's going to make all these
[53:52] quotes that everybody gets so so bump
[53:55] puzzled about it's going to make them
[53:57] come right into view because look for
[53:59] the 70 weeks that's 7 years so brother
[54:01] Randon is there one week left for the
[54:03] Jews no but there's seven
[54:06] quotes in the Daniel 70 weeks book that
[54:08] there's one week left after the Rapture
[54:10] right yeah right yeah amen you can't
[54:13] erase it right it's written can't erase
[54:16] it amen but you going to see where he
[54:19] says no no n n n n he said I didn't say
[54:21] that they asked him they said you said
[54:23] there was 7 years left after the Rapture
[54:24] brother R's mind is not talking about a
[54:26] Jewish week right he's talking about
[54:29] that Messiah week cuz he has he has he
[54:31] has pulled out of the Danel 70 weeks and
[54:34] now he's looking at Redemption cuz he's
[54:35] trying to get a bride ready if he
[54:37] doesn't get a bride ready the Jews don't
[54:39] get ready that's right right we got to
[54:41] get out of here the reason he's not
[54:43] going out there brother Frank to the
[54:45] Jews is cuz you're sitting in that seat
[54:47] and I'm standing up here that's right
[54:50] and and and Bill
[54:54] y
[54:58] Pastor for the record we are in his
[55:01] church oh yes the the prince should come
[55:05] and be for 70 weeks that's seven years
[55:08] he's compressing it all down right he's
[55:11] not doing away with that Jewish week or
[55:13] that last seven years because I'm going
[55:15] to prove to you if you'll just go read
[55:17] the sixfold purpose that's
[55:19] right if you'll read the sixfold purpose
[55:22] amen it'll prove to you there's one week
[55:24] left after the rap just read we're going
[55:26] to read it just a minute all right go to
[55:27] the next one six seal Dad read it we're
[55:30] going to read it again kingom of God in
[55:32] Hand kingom of Heavens to be set up the
[55:33] time last 3 and 1/2
[55:38] years right there am I okay yeah of
[55:42] Daniel's 70th week promised to the Jews
[55:47] right his
[55:49] people remember now that to prove that
[55:52] that this is Daniel's last part of the s
[55:55] week he's running it all into that one
[55:56] week right there right he's saying the
[55:59] last part right there not over here
[56:02] that's a Jewish week now 70 weeks was
[56:05] promised which was 7 years
[56:08] amen 70 490 years is Promised right
[56:12] uhhuh but for Redemption purposes only
[56:16] seven years are promised right yeah that
[56:19] okay we all right all some of you still
[56:22] are out in la la land somewhere that's
[56:24] okay it took me a little while but when
[56:26] I when I read when dad told me he said
[56:28] write he told me two things he said
[56:30] write Parable on top of every page when
[56:32] you read Daniel 7 weeks right this is
[56:34] their Parable this is their Parable this
[56:36] is their Parable and then he said go
[56:38] read the sixfold purpose and put it in
[56:40] line right so now let's go to the next
[56:44] one he said the Messiah shall come he
[56:46] will prophesy in the 70th week which is
[56:49] 3 and 1/2 years in the midst of it he'll
[56:51] be cut off which is 7 years 70 weeks is
[56:53] determined for thy people people 7even
[56:55] years approximately to the Jews he said
[56:57] to Messiah the prince shall come and
[56:59] prophesy in the midst of the seven weeks
[57:00] 7even days will be cut off now what's he
[57:02] talking about right
[57:05] there
[57:06] right remember that that said that had a
[57:09] twofold meaning and he shall confirm the
[57:12] Covenant with many for a week there is
[57:14] not a scripture in the Bible that says
[57:15] the messiah's going to be cut off in the
[57:16] midst of the week
[57:18] right find it right find it it doesn't
[57:23] say it it says after 62 weeks right
[57:26] Messiah will be cut off right it doesn't
[57:28] say ever find it if you can find it it
[57:31] does not say after 3 and a half years
[57:33] the Messiah will be cut off right it
[57:35] says after 62 weeks right but brother
[57:37] randam is condensing that down to that
[57:39] Messiah week brothers that's your key
[57:42] amen and if you don't get it your
[57:44] people's not going to get
[57:47] it sorry I still get a little mean from
[57:50] him but your people are under you if you
[57:54] you don't get it your people's not going
[57:56] to get it right it's true now when
[57:58] Messiah comes Jesus he preached exactly
[58:00] three and a half Messiah read how many
[58:03] times in these quotes he's going to say
[58:04] Messiah he's never going to say a Jewish
[58:06] week he's going to say messiah messiah
[58:08] messiah now when Messiah come Jesus he
[58:10] preached exactly 3 and 1/2 years and was
[58:12] cut off for a
[58:14] sacrifice but at the end of the Gentiles
[58:16] there would still be 3 and 1/2 Years yet
[58:19] to the Jews amen Messiah week yes
[58:23] Messiah week
[58:25] I hope you getting all right let's go
[58:27] keep
[58:29] going and if that was the sign of the
[58:31] Messiah yesterday it's the same today or
[58:33] he did the wrong sign now this is we
[58:35] would see Jesus this is outside the
[58:37] Daniel 7 weeks book and then Israel was
[58:39] right and justified by killing him
[58:41] denying him to be the Messiah CU he'd be
[58:43] an impostor but they killed him because
[58:45] that he proved that he was Messiah there
[58:47] wasn't a rock to be overturned as we get
[58:49] to further and we now you see he is the
[58:52] Messiah see how many times he say a
[58:54] messiah
[58:55] messiah messiah keep
[58:57] going evening evening messenger notice
[59:00] if the Gentile church has to be taken
[59:02] away first for the Jews then the end of
[59:05] the 70 weeks of Daniel takes
[59:08] place not here here in the middle of the
[59:13] 70th week he's bringing it all down to
[59:15] right here and then there's three and
[59:18] 1/2 weeks left yet and we find out two
[59:20] prophets of Revelations he never changes
[59:22] his code again of Revelation 11 comes
[59:25] down and prophesies to the Jew now the
[59:27] church will be taken away at that time
[59:29] just keep rolling
[59:31] through now here's a little thing we're
[59:33] going to reverse back aand this on the
[59:34] first SE I think Dad read this we the 3
[59:36] and 1/2 years of Daniel 70 weeks the
[59:38] last half of Daniel 70 weeks which is
[59:41] three and 1/2 years right there right
[59:43] there not this Jewish week right there's
[59:46] one week left to finish the 490 years he
[59:48] ain't completed the 4 he got 483 he's
[59:50] got to complete 483 he's got to change
[59:53] it to 490 so it's got to be 7 years left
[59:55] so when he says 3 and 1/2 then forget
[59:57] about forget about seven he's not
[59:59] talking about seven he's talking about 3
[1:00:00] and 1/2 all right just keep going cuz we
[1:00:03] we're going to get behind now just 70
[1:00:05] weeks was deter determined perfectly as
[1:00:07] Daniel said that Messiah would come and
[1:00:08] would be cut off in the midst of the
[1:00:10] week there is no scripture for that he's
[1:00:13] cut off after 62 weeks yeah all right
[1:00:16] but brother randam is telling you right
[1:00:18] what the scripture is saying amen you do
[1:00:21] my
[1:00:23] water and Jesus prophesied 3 and 1/2
[1:00:26] years now in the middle of this three
[1:00:27] and 1/2 years of Daniel in the middle of
[1:00:30] it he was cut off
[1:00:33] yeah now the last part is the
[1:00:35] Tribulation period where the Gentile
[1:00:36] church is oh this is great the bride
[1:00:38] goes in with the groom then after the
[1:00:40] Millennium walks out upon the ashes of
[1:00:42] the wicked keep that in mind keep going
[1:00:45] these two witnesses prophesy in the time
[1:00:46] of Daniel second half of the 70 weeks
[1:00:49] not this one that's where everybody goes
[1:00:52] bunkers it's the last half of the m week
[1:00:55] right remember how he takes the Daniel
[1:00:57] 70 weeks I said we would need him when
[1:00:58] we get in there I don't know why but
[1:01:01] something told me we need
[1:01:04] it amen and here we
[1:01:07] are can we say here we are amen whether
[1:01:11] you like it or not here we are now
[1:01:14] remember Daniel was told that the
[1:01:15] Messiah would come the prince the
[1:01:17] Messiah rather and would prophesy Israel
[1:01:19] still had 70 weeks left and in the midst
[1:01:22] of the 70 weeks that's right in the
[1:01:26] midst of the 70 weeks is 35 and A2 uhhuh
[1:01:29] that don't even calculate so he's
[1:01:31] talking about that Messiah week in the
[1:01:33] midst of the 70 week the Messiah look
[1:01:36] how many times he says Messiah would be
[1:01:38] cut off and the daily sacrifice taken
[1:01:39] away but there was still 3 and 1/2 Weeks
[1:01:42] toer which is right there fifth seal now
[1:01:45] these Jews I have to do this in order
[1:01:47] now to see the revelation of this
[1:01:50] seal in order to see the revelation of
[1:01:52] this seal right see what it is these
[1:01:55] Souls Under The Altar and who they are
[1:01:57] now notice in the time of Daniel now the
[1:01:59] second half of the 70th week right here
[1:02:01] not this one this one now remember
[1:02:04] Messiah was to be cut off in the midst
[1:02:06] that's the middle that's where he was
[1:02:07] cut off people he was cut off to get me
[1:02:10] and you amen right let his blood be on
[1:02:12] us and our children that's when he was
[1:02:14] cut off he'd already preached three and
[1:02:16] 1/2 years so in the midst of that
[1:02:17] Messiah week he was cut off amen okay
[1:02:22] everybody all right with that that's the
[1:02:23] middle what's half of seven three and A2
[1:02:27] Prophet going make it simple for you how
[1:02:29] long did Christ preach the church
[1:02:31] answers three and A2 that's right now
[1:02:34] but there's determined yet to the people
[1:02:36] what another 3 and 1/2 years right there
[1:02:39] all right keep
[1:02:41] going all right notice these Messengers

[1:02:45] these two prophets they're going to
[1:02:47] preach the kingdom is at hand that's the
[1:02:48] first thing Jesus preached right King Of
[1:02:50] Heaven is the hand y remember now to
[1:02:53] prove that this is Daniel's last part of
[1:02:54] the 70th
[1:02:56] week right here I got a question on that
[1:02:58] for tomorrow now let's skip through that
[1:03:01] cuz we're going to have to hurry up I
[1:03:02] don't want to I know you want to eat
[1:03:04] probably more than you want to hear me
[1:03:05] but this is important last part of the 7
[1:03:08] week do I need to keep these quotes
[1:03:10] that's what makes everybody bers they go
[1:03:13] how this the last half and this and
[1:03:14] nothing over here that's Daniel 70th
[1:03:17] 70th part last part of the 70th week

[1:03:22] the Messiah week yeah Redemption I'm
[1:03:25] talking about Redemption all right so go
[1:03:28] to the next
[1:03:30] quot that's one Dad read because he said

[1:03:38] taken in Rapture he did right seven
[1:03:42] times yeah

[1:03:54] what they were asking right amen 7 years
[1:03:56] of ministry left brother Rand no no no n
[1:03:59] n n you got that wrong right not the
[1:04:02] full seven weeks the week started when
[1:04:04] Jesus came on Earth with his ministry
[1:04:07] right here and then he'll be cut off and
[1:04:09] Jesus preached exactly 3 and 1/2 years
[1:04:11] which is half of the 70 weeks right yes
[1:04:14] he keep saying 70 weeks right half of
[1:04:17] the 70 weeks is 35 years so we must be
[1:04:20] condensing it down to that Messiah week

[1:11:03] then is on that's when the Millennium
[1:11:06] when the city is to be built fourth I
[1:11:08] had about six more scriptures let's keep
[1:11:09] going number five to seal up the vision
[1:11:12] and prophecy what's he talking about he
[1:11:13] talking about sealing up in the people
[1:11:16] what in the end time us a revelation
[1:11:18] we're going to carry a revelation with
[1:11:20] us people that's right all right let's
[1:11:21] keep going come on
[1:11:24] now you watch when we get into D in 7
[1:11:25] weeks how that comes out that's when the
[1:11:27] Myster is going to be revealed that's
[1:11:28] when he breaks his Covenant in the
[1:11:29] middle of the week he's talking about
[1:11:30] times and half times all right
[1:11:32] now have we got time for this last one
[1:11:34] thank you now six anoint the most holy
[1:11:37] oh my here's the one the last thing he
[1:11:39] was to do was what now just go back over
[1:11:42] Daniel find out what he's doing now if
[1:11:43] you'll read that it'll put you right
[1:11:47] there right
[1:11:50] okay that's the sixfold reason of his
[1:11:53] coming now what to anoint the most holy
[1:11:54] now this may be a little bit strange for
[1:11:56] just a minute to many of you teachers
[1:11:58] but just hold it just a minute now let's
[1:12:00] see how it comes out this is the
[1:12:02] anointing not of a man right Jesus is
[1:12:04] already anointed is that right the book
[1:12:06] of Acts said that God anointed Jesus
[1:12:08] with the Holy Ghost and went around
[1:12:09] doing good he is the messiah messiah
[1:12:11] means the anointed one is that right but
[1:12:13] here at the end time he's the anoint to
[1:12:15] anoint the most holy what is the most
[1:12:18] holy to my way of seeing it which I
[1:12:19] believe I can prove it by the scripture
[1:12:21] is to anoint the most holy which will be
[1:12:23] the Tabernacle that will be used during
[1:12:26] the Millennium right hey amen
[1:12:31] amen the six F
[1:12:33] purpose that six laps right over into
[1:12:36] that Millennium

[1:12:40] right and buddy we're having a good time
[1:12:43] amen
[1:12:45] amen there is the 70 weeks of that right
[1:12:49] we got another
[1:12:50] one that's all oh go go to the last
[1:12:54] one cuz you see the description of the
[1:12:56] temple Ezekiel 40:44 keep going all the
[1:12:59] way to the
[1:13:00] end so what have we done cuz you going
[1:13:03] to keep reading the anointing actually
[1:13:04] the anointing to the temples me and you
[1:13:06] amen when we come back in Revelations
[1:13:08] 19 this right here let's read this let
[1:13:11] me read this right here a confederation
[1:13:13] of church WIll consolidate them together
[1:13:14] and bring the Jews into this
[1:13:15] confederation and bring them back to
[1:13:17] their own Temple worship again and the
[1:13:19] thus sayth the Lord out of the Bible
[1:13:20] they will have their own church what
[1:13:22] they are now I just caught it fresh they
[1:13:25] are now a nation recognized is that
[1:13:27] right but they have not their Temple
[1:13:29] worship yet and when they establish the
[1:13:31] temple worship he's talking about down
[1:13:33] here amen the church will be gone God
[1:13:36] will be dealing with the Jews as a
[1:13:37] nation and then when they are brought
[1:13:39] into this confederation Rome will break
[1:13:40] it in the middle of the 70th year right
[1:13:44] that's right right there exactly all
[1:13:46] right because look desolation spread to
[1:13:49] the consummation what's the consummation
[1:13:51] really po people the battle of
[1:13:53] Armageddon is not going to be a one-day
[1:13:55] battle it's going to carry over into
[1:13:56] maybe a year who knows but we're going
[1:13:58] to walk out on the ashes of all this
[1:14:00] stuff it's not going to consume
[1:14:01] everything that's right it's not God's
[1:14:03] consuming fire it's man's fire atomic
[1:14:05] fire I can prove that by the prophet's
[1:14:07] message but we don't have time but now
[1:14:09] at the very end this is what we've done
[1:14:12] we took the three people that needed
[1:14:13] redemption or the three things that
[1:14:15] needed Redemption and now pull it

[1:14:22] city restored yes sir the end of 70
[1:14:25] weeks Glory thank you sir amen that's
[1:14:34] it let's see one question before we
[1:14:38] go any of you Brothers have a need for
[1:14:42] any of this to be displayed
[1:14:44] after when we come back for
[1:14:49] discussion reason being these brothers
[1:14:52] are not ministering
[1:14:54] so according to how we've set up our
[1:14:56] rules they can't be in here during the
[1:14:59] discussion so they're going to take all
[1:15:01] this equipment and put it out in the van
[1:15:03] and wait on us to get finished with our
[1:15:05] discussion it won't be taped anymore it
[1:15:07] won't be videoed anymore we'll go back
[1:15:09] to what we were doing in the past where
[1:15:12] we just have a discussion we're going to
[1:15:14] fight in the
[1:15:16] backyard our among ourself but don't
[1:15:19] fight my brother in the front yard right
[1:15:22] no I hope it it's not going to be
[1:15:23] just kidding but that's that's what I'm
[1:15:24] saying about the two brothers the three
[1:15:26] brothers are not ministers so if you
[1:15:28] want any of this left up here you're
[1:15:30] going to have to say so now cuz if not
[1:15:32] every bit of that's going to be gone now
[1:15:34] you've got these papers and you've got
[1:15:36] charts and I've got a chart of the
[1:15:38] PowerPoint if you want to keep it and
[1:15:40] look at it when we're finished for your
[1:15:42] discussion but other than that when we
[1:15:44] come back from eating they're not going
[1:15:45] to be in here so that's why he was
[1:15:46] asking that
[1:15:49] question speak up now or forever hold
[1:15:51] your peace
[1:15:54] okay brother
[1:15:59] okay
[1:16:02] sorry I was kind of worried because they
[1:16:05] going to close the rest here in a
[1:16:08] minute been waiting on us for a long
[1:16:10] time we got a lot of good food out there
[1:16:12] and we sure don't want to throw it away
[1:16:14] right so I trust you all will enjoy the
[1:16:17] things that we have tried to prepare for
[1:16:19] you it's kind of like a buffet very
[1:16:23] don't like it all just mix it all
[1:16:24] together and
[1:16:26] make had a good time so far sir don't do
[1:16:30] like some have done in the past they
[1:16:31] thought when we got to hear the meeting
[1:16:32] was over and they left and went home so
[1:16:34] it just really begins when we get back
[1:16:37] everybody gets involved right so uh
