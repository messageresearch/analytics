[6:21] of the body of Christ and we're just you
[6:23] know serve trying to serve the Lord and
[6:26] doing the best we can all right in your
[6:28] scripture Romans 8 and then we'll go to
[6:32] Genesis 1 right Romans 8 verse 28 it be
[6:38] on the board for
[6:42] you and we know that all things work
[6:44] together for good to them that love God
[6:47] to them who are the called according to
[6:50] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[6:53] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[6:55] the image of his son that he might be
[6:57] the firstborn among many brethren amen
[7:00] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[7:02] he also called and whom he called them
[7:05] he also Justified and whom he
[7:08] justified them he also glorified what
[7:11] shall we then say to these things if God
[7:14] be for us who can be against us that's a
[7:17] good point isn't it all right let's go
[7:19] back where we've been in
[7:21] Genesis 1 and uh just read our scripture
[7:25] from there and we'll pick up our
[7:28] thought Genesis
[7:30] 1:26 and God said let us make man in our
[7:34] image after our likeness and let them
[7:37] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[7:39] and over the fowl of the A and over the
[7:41] cattle and over all the Earth and over
[7:43] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[7:45] the Earth so God created man in his own
[7:49] image in the image of God created he him
[7:52] male and female created he them and God
[7:55] said unto them now what and God blessed
[7:59] them and God said unto them be fruitful
[8:01] and multiply and replenish the Earth and
[8:04] subdue it and have dominion over the
[8:06] fish of the sea and over the foul of the
[8:07] air and over every living thing that
[8:10] moveth upon the Earth you may be seated
[8:14] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[8:17] of the
[8:18] word now we've been studying for quite a
[8:23] while and talking about this why we read
[8:26] there in
[8:27] Romans uh you know
[8:30] about predestination for
[8:33] knowledge the Bible says those who he
[8:36] for know for new you know for no he did
[8:40] predestinate amen all right then we we
[8:44] know and realize that God predestines by
[8:47] forn knowledge amen it's not a thought
[8:50] that we used to have of one Church would
[8:52] believe it this way and one Church
[8:54] believes it that way and you have a lot
[8:56] of of uh different uh denominational
[9:00] churches and things that follow
[9:03] different routes of predestination and
[9:05] and all like that and you got what you
[9:08] call the calvinistic form of
[9:10] predestination which means god stamped
[9:13] it that's it you can't do anything about
[9:15] it's all done you just sit back and
[9:17] relax and try to enjoy what you can if
[9:20] you're a good person if you're supposed
[9:22] to be saved you will be saved if you're
[9:23] not you won't that's that's really
[9:26] what's taught to people all right then
[9:28] you got the Armenian form that would
[9:31] carry it over to a lot of works you know
[9:35] and and connecting in that but I I like
[9:39] to put them both together the best that
[9:41] I can and to understand that you know
[9:44] God predestines we've read there in the
[9:46] scripture by his forn knowledge amen
[9:49] those who he forew amen he did
[9:53] predestinate all right then that's a
[9:55] simple matter if we believe in God in
[9:57] the correct way
[10:00] if we believe in an eternal God that uh
[10:05] is
[10:06] infinite in his
[10:08] thinking that he knows everything before
[10:11] it ever
[10:12] happens and if we don't believe in that
[10:15] kind of a god what kind of a god do we
[10:16] believe in you know what what are we
[10:18] talking about uh is God just like we are
[10:21] that he changes his mind every other day
[10:24] and you know he likes this today and
[10:26] tomorrow he don't like that and he goes
[10:28] to something else
[10:29] and see we couldn't have any confidence
[10:31] in God in that way because he might
[10:35] change his mind the next day all right
[10:38] he might predestinate you one day and
[10:40] the next day he might forget about you
[10:43] because that's the way we think about in
[10:45] life you know of doing but see to
[10:49] believe that he's infinite
[10:52] Amen to believe that he knew ever that
[10:55] as the prophet of God that we follow
[10:57] after was teaching us that every n that
[11:01] would ever be in the
[11:03] world now this is the kind of God I
[11:05] believe in or and that he knew every
[11:10] time that natat would bat its
[11:13] eye right
[11:14] amen now that's that's a whole lot isn't
[11:19] it I mean I I don't like naps and you
[11:22] they just you know they're just billions
[11:23] and billions of them around all the time
[11:25] you know and you just think that God
[11:27] knew every move that that would ever
[11:30] make amen now if he didn't he's not God
[11:33] right you understand we can't pull
[11:36] anything over on him it's not something
[11:38] that we we we are smarter than he is cuz
[11:42] he made us remember we didn't make him
[11:44] that's all right and then in believing
[11:47] it then God predestines because
[11:49] predestinate means Destiny set before
[11:53] right or predetermined whatever you want
[11:55] to use the the term
[11:57] for so then we we read in the scripture
[11:59] where he said that Jacob have I
[12:03] loved and Esau have I
[12:05] hated maybe you've thought about that a
[12:07] lot you know and wondering why would it
[12:09] be that it was and says even before they
[12:11] were
[12:13] born and then he tell like uh who was it
[12:17] Jeremiah one of the prophets there he
[12:19] said I knew you and ordained you to be a
[12:23] prophet before the world y well then
[12:29] we ought to understand that these things
[12:32] are not
[12:33] haphazardly
[12:35] happening I I what I said I don't go
[12:37] with the with the form of predetermined
[12:40] all doing because that will run out
[12:42] right right because God would that all
[12:45] be saved There's 7 billion people close
[12:49] in the world today you know what he
[12:51] would that everybody be saved he woulded
[12:54] every person that has ever been in the
[12:56] world to be saved cuz he's God right
[12:59] all right being that then why is it that
[13:04] some people are lost and some are
[13:07] saved it would have to be on the basis
[13:10] that you would be he would be dealing
[13:12] with for knowledge amen sure for
[13:17] knowledge is a great understanding
[13:18] because you go back into the mind of God
[13:20] is as we talk about Paul said you know
[13:23] Bringing Down the great things to the
[13:24] church one day and he said I have the
[13:26] mind of Christ all right now that was
[13:29] not meaning a transplant of the mind it
[13:33] was meaning by the new birth that Paul
[13:36] had within
[13:37] him that that was the mind of Christ
[13:40] that was being brought to him by that
[13:43] new birth amen right and that's way he
[13:45] the prophets could prophesy that's why
[13:48] they could uh speak before the world and
[13:50] tell things I mean speak when their time
[13:52] until what would happen even before the
[13:55] world and what would happen after the
[13:57] world Moses could write uh the first
[14:00] five books there of the Bible and tell
[14:04] what happened in the
[14:06] garden why because God had taken him
[14:09] into his for knowledge amen it opened
[14:13] Paul's understanding to where that he
[14:16] would would come forth with a knowledge
[14:18] of what would take place now remember
[14:22] for knowledge is knowledge
[14:25] before of what will be amen so you got
[14:28] to go to knowledge first if if the
[14:30] people had went to that first you
[14:32] wouldn't have had all of the splits in
[14:34] the churches cuz the Baptist Church
[14:36] actually split one time over the word
[14:38] over the predestination Doctrine and you
[14:41] know and then your your Presbyterian
[14:44] come along with it and some of your
[14:46] older form of independent Baptists got
[14:50] to the bases that they were more
[14:52] Armenian style I mean a calvinist style
[14:55] and they were say well we don't need to
[14:58] have a Revival
[15:00] yeah because God's going to save them
[15:03] anyway well what I always wondered if
[15:06] you going to do that why even go to
[15:07] church at all right I mean if you're
[15:10] going to believe it like that if you're
[15:11] going to believe well well God's going
[15:12] to save me he's going to save me well
[15:14] then why do anything right yeah eat
[15:17] drink and be married cuz tomorrow you
[15:18] die you know it's a hard way of saying
[15:22] it but it's
[15:23] truth and that's that's what people
[15:25] don't understand with me there one thing
[15:27] about it you don't have to worry about I
[15:29] what I believe cuz I tell you what I
[15:31] believe I don't have no secret code
[15:34] words you know I just tell it to way I
[15:37] believe it
[15:38] amen but see predestination is Destiny
[15:44] set but if you make God do it as picking
[15:48] one and not picking the other one right
[15:51] look what you've done if he picked Jacob
[15:55] and rejected
[15:57] Esau look What's happen happen right you
[16:00] make him a respector persons you make
[16:02] him to where that he wouldn't be giving
[16:04] everybody an
[16:06] opportunity but yet he does he gives
[16:08] everybody because you know God would
[16:12] that all as I said would be saved right
[16:15] sure but he knew who would and who
[16:17] wouldn't right if you're going to
[16:20] believe in him being God Amen if not
[16:22] then just take H Hazard L and forget
[16:26] it but you'll wind up against the wall
[16:28] one these days and you'll be wondering
[16:30] whether that God is real or not because
[16:32] that's the one thing I believe in I
[16:34] believe in a real God I don't believe in
[16:36] just an imagination or a thought or a
[16:39] concept amen I I believe God is real
[16:44] amen I don't believe that he ever had to
[16:46] come into existence right because he is
[16:50] existence he is what has brought
[16:52] everything into existence he is the
[16:54] Eternal amen all right and if we have
[16:57] eternal life today
[16:59] and the only way to have that is to be
[17:00] born again amen if you have eternal life
[17:04] you have the life of
[17:06] God living within you you said well
[17:09] that's hard to understand I agree that's
[17:12] why Nicodemus couldn't get it amen when
[17:15] he told him said you must be born again
[17:17] yep he said well wait a minute you mean
[17:19] I've got to go back into my mother and I
[17:22] got to come out
[17:24] again and Jesus said if I tell you
[17:28] Earthly things and you can't understand
[17:30] them in other words if I tell you the
[17:33] lower form of what you need to know
[17:36] right there's no need of talking of
[17:39] great things right amen but see Jesus
[17:41] when he said you must be born again look
[17:43] that up in the original it says You must
[17:46] be born from above amen amen cuz he said
[17:52] my kingdom is not of this world Amen
[17:56] right see the kingdom of God is not to
[17:59] meat and drink and and things like that
[18:01] the scripture says amen the kingdom of
[18:03] God is righteousness and peace and joy
[18:06] in the Holy Ghost amen right but see
[18:09] what we need then is a new
[18:12] birth to be able to receive
[18:16] because the scripture says no man can
[18:19] call and I'm paraphrasing it no man can
[18:22] call Jesus the
[18:23] Christ what except he be born again amen
[18:29] why because you're trying to take the
[18:31] carnal
[18:32] mind and try to understand the
[18:36] spiritual God Amen see then that won't
[18:40] work so then what we need is the new
[18:43] birth to come and within
[18:46] us and then we've got the inside teacher
[18:50] right then the Bible would say you have
[18:53] no need that anybody teach you that's
[18:56] scripture sure come because the Holy
[18:58] Ghost inside of you will teach but now
[19:00] then he turns right around he said he
[19:02] puts teachers and Etc right in the body
[19:06] right God's not confused
[19:09] right see we need the inside teacher
[19:12] right to teach us what the outside
[19:15] teacher tells us the outside teacher is
[19:18] a five full ministry you know Apostles
[19:21] prophets evangelist pastors teachers
[19:23] right all right then in that if we get
[19:27] the new birth we have an inside
[19:30] teacher that's what's wrong with the
[19:32] natural world out here see as you you
[19:34] you got uh doctors I was looking the
[19:37] other day in a in a a thing
[19:41] that and it was telling about that I
[19:44] mean this is
[19:46] back two 2,000 3,000 years ago or
[19:50] so they were already studying
[19:53] back well on back about people that had
[19:56] migraines and you know bad headaches and
[19:59] you know what they would
[20:03] do and they actually had little things
[20:05] that they put on their head they bore a
[20:08] hole in
[20:10] their in their Scout Bo right
[20:15] in I mean this is 3,000 years ago this
[20:19] is not just 100 years ago or some idea
[20:22] this is way back but see they knew that
[20:25] there was something and they they said
[20:27] the demons was was in there and if I
[20:31] could get a hole in there you know they
[20:33] could get them demons out of you yeah
[20:35] and because they'd call everything a
[20:37] demon headaches and all kind of things
[20:39] well that's not
[20:41] demons that's a part of the human body
[20:45] that you know something's wrong with may
[20:47] be caused by a demon that has caused us
[20:50] but
[20:52] still but my
[20:54] point if those people back then already
[20:58] were studying about the human
[21:02] brain you know 3 4 5,000 years
[21:07] ago studying about the human
[21:11] brain then it must be right in the in
[21:14] the scripture there where it says the
[21:16] the imagination of man's heart mind is
[21:18] continually evil but then it says
[21:20] there's nothing to be able to refrain
[21:22] from his thinking
[21:25] right and you just think about a human
[21:27] being
[21:30] a human being and think about God
[21:32] because the Bible says that even the
[21:34] Eternal godhead can be understood by the
[21:37] things that are
[21:38] seen I'm a father I'm a son I'm a
[21:42] human but how many people am I I'm just
[21:46] one person with many manifestations
[21:50] amen all
[21:52] right see then your your sisters you're
[21:55] are a wife but you you're then you
[21:58] become a mother then you become a
[22:00] grandmother a great
[22:03] grandmother what is
[22:05] that that's you in many
[22:10] manifestations amen and that's what we
[22:12] believe about almighty God Amen
[22:15] right that God has many manifestations
[22:18] about him right to manifest himself
[22:22] right but that doesn't make it sful Gods
[22:25] right
[22:26] man because see that wouldn't fit his
[22:29] scripture
[22:31] right I if if there three or four God
[22:33] you going to have to have three or four
[22:35] Bibles that that should be sensible you
[22:38] know and and then you could be arguing
[22:40] of whether or not and I've always said
[22:43] that that and I'm just honest in the way
[22:45] I talk I'm sorry but old country boy
[22:48] that uh I kind of wish sometimes it was
[22:52] four or five Gods
[22:53] yeah because the things I do in my
[22:56] repentance might be able to
[22:58] filter through the chain you know
[23:01] getting up to him that may sound silly
[23:03] but you know I don't believe it that way
[23:06] I believe there's one true and living
[23:08] God but with many
[23:10] manifestations of that God that's right
[23:13] all right then that God that we're
[23:15] talking about is the one that had the
[23:16] forn knowledge
[23:19] amen those prophets never
[23:22] knew why was it just one man that knew
[23:25] what happened in
[23:26] Genesis right cuz it was only one man
[23:29] that God revealed himself to right all
[23:33] right then in revealing himself to Moses
[23:36] he could write what
[23:39] happened some almost 2,000 years before
[23:44] right see that's the forn knowledge of
[23:47] God
[23:49] Amen you look at in the Bible and think
[23:52] about it the Bible says that and to see
[23:56] the for knowledge of God and how that
[23:58] he's so
[23:59] infinite the Bible says that that one
[24:03] time they found a
[24:05] scroll and they stood before the water
[24:09] gate go look that up in your scripture
[24:11] sometime they stood before the
[24:14] Watergate and he read that
[24:17] scroll wasn't it odd that all of this
[24:19] come out with our president back there
[24:22] that had a thing called
[24:24] Watergate but at the same time that was
[24:27] taking place
[24:29] God was revealing his word to his bride
[24:33] through the prophet in the end
[24:35] time and you read there where it says
[24:38] and when the towers
[24:42] fall that the understanding of man would
[24:46] be what seven times greater
[24:50] right look at the opening of the word in
[24:52] the last days even all around the world
[24:55] more Bibles more uh doings than ever
[24:58] before
[25:00] right but it's in the scripture amen he
[25:03] would speak that down to the end the
[25:05] Bible tells you about the future home
[25:07] that we're going to tells you about the
[25:09] Millennium it tells you about the white
[25:11] Throne judgment it tells you all the
[25:13] things that's God's for knowledge am all
[25:16] right so then he could set that that
[25:19] would take
[25:20] place and those things would be right
[25:23] see then there's no way to change God's
[25:25] forn knowledge amen right no there's no
[25:29] need of you trying to fool with that
[25:32] right just believe it and accept it and
[25:35] say all
[25:37] right but you see I I want to believe it
[25:40] this way if I have a desire to be
[25:45] saved I believe God works on our desires
[25:49] you know what we desire if I desire to
[25:52] be saved he make a way right he make a
[25:56] way for me to be saved
[25:58] because I desire but that's the way it
[26:00] is with Jacob and Esau see Jacob had the
[26:02] desire in his heart for the birthright
[26:05] Esau didn't think anything about the
[26:08] birthright all right so then we can see
[26:11] that God could look down and see what
[26:14] Jacob and Esau would do amen and he
[26:17] could speak of it before the world
[26:20] right he says in Revelations uh what 138
[26:24] there where it talks about uh the names
[26:26] written in the Book of Life
[26:28] of the lamb slain before the foundation
[26:30] of the
[26:31] world you know God could write their
[26:33] names down before the world ever begun
[26:35] right why because of his forn
[26:38] knowledge right see not because he
[26:41] predestinated us right uhuh it goes on
[26:44] the wrong wrong scale see God would that
[26:48] all be saved that's right but he knew
[26:51] some would be and some
[26:53] wouldn't that's that infinite God that I
[26:56] speaking of a moment ago
[26:59] because that God then after he brought
[27:03] everything into
[27:07] being after he had created the uh the
[27:10] the world Genesis
[27:14] 1 and you'll find that though that word
[27:17] God in the original there is where it's
[27:19] used 33 times I think in Genesis
[27:23] 1 but each time that word is
[27:26] Elohim
[27:29] which means self-existing
[27:31] amen he dwelt alone
[27:35] amen even though he would create the
[27:37] animals he had nothing like him in
[27:42] existence all right even though he could
[27:45] do those
[27:47] things but yet when he gets
[27:50] over there then to to Genesis
[27:54] 1:26 he says let us make man amen he
[27:58] said well look that word
[28:01] us they must have been two or three of
[28:04] them you know but see that's what we
[28:07] think
[28:08] about that's why we got it so massively
[28:11] confused right like John one in the
[28:14] beginning was a word and the Word was
[28:16] With
[28:18] God all right we stopped
[28:21] there and we say with though it must
[28:24] have been two or three of them you
[28:26] know
[28:28] but you don't read the rest of it and
[28:30] the Word was
[28:32] God all right so it solves a problem
[28:35] there's one true and living God Amen all
[28:37] right so then that's based upon the
[28:40] Bible then as we read of Genesis here of
[28:44] the creation of
[28:47] mankind all the animals all of the
[28:50] things that he could
[28:52] create but think about it a minute there
[28:55] was nothing like him right
[28:58] he's Eternal
[29:00] God he was still self-existing
[29:06] in other words he had nothing to exist
[29:11] with him like him you understand what it
[29:14] means the word self-existing means he
[29:16] existed alone all right meaning that
[29:19] there was nothing like him he could
[29:22] create the world he could create the
[29:24] animals the moon the stars the all of
[29:27] the things
[29:30] think and he still be the same
[29:33] word god read it in your Bible
[29:36] right then in Genesis
[29:39] 2 as he begins to create the natural man
[29:42] of
[29:45] Adam he says Lord
[29:49] God Lord
[29:51] God read your Bible just just I like for
[29:54] people to read their own Bible right it
[29:56] says Lord God right right the meaning
[29:59] something
[30:01] happened all
[30:04] right meaning that by this
[30:07] time God is no longer self-existing
[30:11] right it means the self-existing
[30:14] one is now revealing himself
[30:19] right what to his creation
[30:23] right all right so then when you do you
[30:27] pick up Genesis 1:26 there and it says
[30:30] let us make
[30:32] man as I said on John when it says with
[30:36] him it doesn't mean somebody beside the
[30:38] other
[30:41] one it means he is revealing himself
[30:46] right that's why I try to emphasize
[30:49] Genesis 1 you read it yourself it
[30:51] doesn't say Lord God in Genesis 1 that's
[30:54] right it says God Amen then in Genesis 2
[30:57] it says Lord God Amen all right then in
[31:01] the writers that picked it up you can
[31:04] read scoffield footnotes and a lot of
[31:05] them are real
[31:08] good some of them I don't agree with but
[31:11] that's all
[31:12] right but see Lord God means he's not
[31:16] existing alone anymore he's going to
[31:18] reveal himself what to his
[31:22] creation amen all right now if we're
[31:25] going to take the word God to be what it
[31:27] is then the word god means object of
[31:32] worship because you can make a God out
[31:34] of platform piano cars people women they
[31:38] make Gods out of women today you know
[31:41] and and
[31:44] uh it just means object of
[31:47] worship
[31:49] amen but see this object of
[31:53] worship had no one to worship
[31:56] Him the animals couldn't worship
[32:00] him so he had to start doing something
[32:04] else so we know that in the Bible term
[32:06] and just giving you a long run in a
[32:12] hurry God said I'm not going to dwell
[32:16] alone
[32:19] amen I'm going to make
[32:22] man and I'm going to make him in my
[32:24] image right right amen all right now
[32:27] this is not the image of God as we look
[32:30] at it this is the image of the
[32:33] animals he gave us a foot like a bar a
[32:35] hand like a monkey all kind of things he
[32:38] made us to look like the animals called
[32:39] We're the top of the animal creation
[32:42] amen right that's why Darwin could
[32:44] follow the chain backward of the
[32:49] evolution we don't believe in in
[32:51] evolution I believe in Creative
[32:52] Evolution God created the animals amen
[32:56] all right
[32:57] he created the monkey he created the dog
[32:59] he created him higher higher higher
[33:01] higher higher the last one was
[33:04] man and he gave him a two-fold part as
[33:08] we'll try to
[33:10] cover you go to the Natural creation of
[33:13] man that natural creation of man you'll
[33:15] find out is just one
[33:18] man
[33:20] right and at that time when he created
[33:23] him Eve was still in Adam remember she
[33:25] had to be taken from Adam
[33:28] right he took a rib you know and made
[33:31] made Eve all right but that's not the
[33:34] creation that we want to look at this
[33:36] morning that's not the the creation of
[33:38] God that we want to look at we want to
[33:41] look at
[33:44] man and see that
[33:46] man is made in the image of God
[33:51] Amen and you think about it is I talking
[33:54] about the smartness of God the the the
[33:57] great understanding that he
[33:59] has now you look at
[34:03] mankind just look around
[34:06] you I said take a little old bitty thing
[34:09] in there cell phone down in the car cuz
[34:13] I always try to tell you you don't bring
[34:14] them up here they'll go off you know
[34:16] yeah and
[34:18] uh I can dial and I can talk
[34:21] to 12 hours on the other side of the
[34:24] Earth right mhm
[34:27] and I could just speak to them and they
[34:29] can talk to me as long as we understand
[34:32] each other in English you
[34:34] know and uh if that don't work they got
[34:38] another little device that you can take
[34:40] and and you can just type in what you
[34:43] want to say to
[34:44] somebody and overseas they just read it
[34:48] in Spanish or India you know what all of
[34:51] those languages Africa whatever it can
[34:54] go around the world in all kind of
[34:55] languages but go instantly now how can
[34:59] you explain
[35:01] that I mean we used to think about we
[35:03] had to had the wire run across you know
[35:05] I say the other day you know there wire
[35:07] run all the way across the ocean well
[35:09] that's what we started
[35:10] with now it shot off the satellites and
[35:13] back and all kind of things and and what
[35:15] they're letting us
[35:18] see is is just minute
[35:24] things I read one time that they had
[35:26] watch is back in 1900 when we was
[35:29] thinking about the old you know get
[35:30] under this thing and the thing Blaze off
[35:33] you know they had watches in
[35:36] 1900 that had cameras in them get smart
[35:40] wouldn't the first guy that come up with
[35:42] them things you know you remember that
[35:44] off of
[35:45] TV he was just showing what was doing he
[35:48] had telephone in his boots you know shoe
[35:50] all kind of thing to watch he could take
[35:52] pictures see they've had these things a
[35:54] long time why because
[35:57] God has allowed mankind to be able to
[36:00] break into his
[36:02] intelligence right all
[36:05] right brother mod at the end of the war
[36:08] there 42 or 3 44 somewhere in there when
[36:11] he got out they were going to school in
[36:13] and they were already talking about in
[36:15] 44 being able to decompose a human being
[36:18] and send it to California and put it
[36:20] back
[36:22] together they said they could send him
[36:24] and all that but they just couldn't get
[36:25] him back together all right now I wonder
[36:28] what they're doing right what I'm
[36:30] getting at the great intelligence of
[36:33] this last days shows the very infinite
[36:37] God in his intelligence because that's
[36:40] where they're getting it from you
[36:42] following me all right that great
[36:45] intelligence is more Superior than
[36:47] anything we could think of Amen right
[36:50] would you take a man you take this to a
[36:52] human being you just think about
[36:55] it
[36:57] I mean I'm 73 years old in my lifetime
[37:00] we came from an old t-
[37:05] model you
[37:09] know you had the brakes on it with with
[37:12] a leather straps around the drive shaft
[37:15] to stop
[37:17] it and most of the time you had to get
[37:20] out in front and hand crank it and break
[37:22] your arm by kicking
[37:24] and but you know what we had a car we
[37:27] was
[37:30] moving and those are beautiful Donny
[37:33] likes
[37:34] his but don't pick me up K to California
[37:37] in the sucker I don't want
[37:39] to bring me something with a air
[37:42] conditioner in it yeah all right
[37:44] something rides better yeah but my point
[37:47] is just to look at what we've come
[37:48] through In Our Lifetime right
[37:51] man and then you go back and you explain
[37:54] to human
[37:55] being
[37:59] that in that human
[38:02] being I don't have to tell my hands to
[38:05] move
[38:07] right
[38:09] right if he did i' had say fer move move
[38:13] hand
[38:15] move and I have to say to my feet move
[38:18] pick up
[38:19] move you don't have to do all that do
[38:22] you you say oh that's just an automatic
[38:25] process my point is trying to get you to
[38:28] see is that God could make a natural man
[38:31] in such a wonderful
[38:33] condition of what we
[38:35] are and you know that it says there as
[38:38] we said that let them multiply and
[38:40] replenish the Earth and have dominion
[38:43] amen that's right over the animals why
[38:45] is the animals afraid of
[38:49] us why is a great big Grizzly beer sniff
[38:53] in the wind smells a human runs the
[38:55] other way why
[39:00] cuz there still something in all of that
[39:02] that's leaderships and things that come
[39:05] down from the garden right right big old
[39:09] elephant unless something happens that
[39:11] you turn Rogue or whatever they call it
[39:13] they'll run from a human being
[39:16] right cuz that's still something the way
[39:19] that we even physically were
[39:24] made but mainly it's because of the way
[39:27] we were made spiritually that's
[39:31] right because we know the Bible and what
[39:34] did it John 5:24 God is a spirit they
[39:38] that worship Him must Worship in his
[39:39] spirit and Truth All right so if a Man
[39:42] was created according to Genesis 1 in
[39:45] the image of God he would first be
[39:47] created in the spiritual image right
[39:51] amen and that image would be in the
[39:54] image of an
[39:55] eternal
[40:01] God then no wonder we could
[40:04] be you could even create a world if it
[40:08] wasn't for God withholding you from it
[40:10] right
[40:11] amen why because there's nothing
[40:16] withholding from
[40:18] mankind what he can think of he can
[40:22] do why because he was created higher
[40:25] than the animals amen the animal deals
[40:28] with a little bit of knowledge a little
[40:30] bit of understanding he has a little bit
[40:33] of
[40:34] ability he can be
[40:36] trained right but he doesn't have a soul
[40:40] within him
[40:44] right see that animal doesn't have a
[40:46] soul that's why that the animal
[40:48] sacrifice was not it was enough to cover
[40:51] back there
[40:53] right right all the sins
[40:56] were pushed forward to Calvary right
[40:58] you've heard
[40:59] that he pushed up to where Jesus Christ
[41:02] could die once for all amen that would
[41:06] be the Old Testament people paying for
[41:08] their price and the New Testament paying
[41:10] for us right all right and in doing
[41:15] that that animal they could kill the
[41:18] animal and God ordained that to be
[41:22] sure he he he accepted that for the time
[41:25] amen but there was nothing in that
[41:27] animal could come back upon the the
[41:29] believer
[41:31] right because the animal didn't have a
[41:33] soul
[41:34] right the soul of man is a marvelous
[41:37] thing Soul means person being whatever
[41:41] you
[41:44] know all right in that then that man
[41:46] that would be created in the image of
[41:51] God it wouldn't be a physical man
[41:55] right
[41:57] it would be the image of God Amen H as
[42:00] we covered in the last message
[42:02] then this thinking about God now you say
[42:07] well we don't know whether you're right
[42:08] or not well you might not but you don't
[42:12] know whether I'm wrong either because
[42:15] you you don't have any way to prove it
[42:18] you just think
[42:19] about God coming down toward man that
[42:23] man could understand him right that's it
[42:27] amen would that not be the purpose right
[42:30] if we are his children right you know do
[42:34] we believe we're the children of God by
[42:35] the new birth right amen well don't you
[42:38] want your children to know about you
[42:42] amen I mean you see a kid and he's you
[42:45] see a daddy and he's walking and he you
[42:47] know like brother Mo used to say he can
[42:50] see me coming before he ever seen
[42:51] anything else CU my feet was always out
[42:54] you know I walk kind of
[42:56] duck walk I guess you call it and I
[42:59] can't run too fast cuz pigeon toed
[43:01] people their toes are turned in you can
[43:03] dig in run fter I didn't know where you
[43:05] knew that or not but that's that's
[43:07] science too
[43:10] but you see my kids come along and I see
[43:13] one of them every once a while and
[43:14] they're they're
[43:16] walking
[43:17] okay you know we talk about well they
[43:19] just like Daddy they look like Daddy
[43:21] they act like
[43:23] Daddy right right why
[43:28] you know they've got a personality of
[43:29] their own they have a soul of their own
[43:33] they have the beings of their own they
[43:34] have all of their senses of their own
[43:37] but they want to be like Mom and
[43:40] Daddy all children want to be like their
[43:44] parents and that's why we need to live a
[43:47] life before the because if we live a
[43:49] wrong life before them they're going to
[43:50] live like Mom and Daddy too they're not
[43:53] just going to walk like us they're going
[43:54] to drink like us and cuss like us and
[43:56] act like us and all those things right
[43:59] yeah exactly so that's why we need to be
[44:02] real careful the way we walk and talk
[44:04] and do but you understand what I'm
[44:06] getting
[44:07] at God wants his children to be like him
[44:13] amen Paul called us his offspring you
[44:17] remember at Mars Hill right when they
[44:19] had a little cubicle left and they said
[44:21] the unknown God you know because they
[44:23] had many gods and they said well you
[44:25] know just in in case we forgot one we'll
[44:26] leave a little hole over here and we'll
[44:28] say to the unknown God Paul said that's
[44:31] the one I want to talk to you about one
[44:32] you don't know anything about it but he
[44:34] said now you know yourself that you
[44:36] believe it we believe it that we're The
[44:38] Offspring of
[44:41] God now physically
[44:44] speaking phys just physically speaking
[44:47] and physically doing
[44:49] being you just think about
[44:53] Mankind you can take the dust of of the
[44:56] earth and make an automobile right y
[44:59] right and drive down the road at 100
[45:03] mph he can take the dust and he can make
[45:05] an airplane and fly 2,000 M hour
[45:09] right why
[45:12] because some Factor about him that's
[45:15] yielding to that inward part of him
[45:20] right and even though he's not a child
[45:22] of
[45:24] God right it's still amazing what
[45:27] mankind can do right
[45:32] amen but you think about what about one
[45:35] that's in the image of
[45:37] God and then we know that God is a
[45:39] spirit but now let's don't lay too much
[45:42] on
[45:43] that because that has deceived us
[45:48] right we think about God just be in the
[45:52] spirit well he's just floating
[45:54] around you
[45:57] know well that's why in Africa they have
[46:00] the word I believe it's aoya I'm not
[46:02] certain right but they believe that the
[46:05] soul of man is the breath of man that's
[46:09] a Jehovah Witness and that's come from
[46:11] the Africa
[46:13] too in other words I breathe out you
[46:16] breathe in my soul goes to you your soul
[46:18] comes to me that's the way mankind
[46:20] believes a soul to
[46:23] be well you know that would be I'd be me
[46:26] one time Mark the next time sister Gail
[46:27] the next
[46:29] time we don't believe it that way right
[46:33] cuz that's just a breath right that you
[46:35] breathe that's an hour you breathe right
[46:38] but the soul of man is in the image of
[46:40] God
[46:43] Amen you know God had an image he walked
[46:46] on the earth one day sure sure Jesus
[46:50] said if you seen me you've seen the
[46:52] father amen that's right yes sir right
[46:55] amen see see we don't deal with this him
[46:57] being a
[46:58] spirit
[47:00] right we deal with him being a spiritual
[47:04] being that's a better way of saying it
[47:06] see you don't have to change the
[47:08] scripture cuz it's not you don't have to
[47:10] do that cuz he is a spirit he can he can
[47:12] be anywhere he wants to be he doesn't
[47:15] have to be on the moon today cuz a't
[47:17] nobody up there he don't have to be up
[47:19] there but if there's anybody up there he
[47:22] has to be there as a
[47:23] witness right God is a being amen he's
[47:27] real that's right Jesus said if you seen
[47:32] me he wasn't talking about this outward
[47:34] part right CU that outward part had a
[47:37] birth had a beginning but he said if
[47:39] You' seen
[47:40] me he said you've seen the father
[47:44] right when we get into Glory all of this
[47:46] is over with what do you think it's
[47:48] going to be a little Halo up here to
[47:50] represent the Holy Ghost and little
[47:52] something over here to represent the
[47:53] Father and Jesus standing down here
[47:56] represent a
[47:58] son no we'll be able to do as he said he
[48:01] said if youve seen me you've seen the
[48:03] father amen we look at him and know who
[48:06] he
[48:07] is cuz he's real that's the point I'm
[48:09] trying to get you to think about is a
[48:11] real God not just a thought of your mind
[48:15] there's people that thinks the good
[48:16] thoughts of your mind is God the bad
[48:18] thoughts is the
[48:20] devil well I don't get to fool with God
[48:22] being too much around me it's always a
[48:24] devil I don't know what you do right I
[48:26] have more bad thoughts than I have good
[48:29] ones you do we need to pray for you
[48:32] brother Dev I hope you do but you need
[48:34] to be honest and admit you got the
[48:36] problem
[48:37] too
[48:38] right I wish it was that it was all
[48:42] good but see what is the image of
[48:50] God to look back as I said through
[48:53] understanding and by way of the end time
[48:55] message were able to follow a lot of
[48:57] things that a lot of the people couldn't
[48:59] follow but yet you can still follow them
[49:01] through through the Greek and the
[49:03] Hebrews and the
[49:06] things and we were saying what would you
[49:08] use for God the only words they can come
[49:10] up with is Elohim which would be
[49:13] self-existing that's the earliest words
[49:16] they could use see because that that
[49:18] simply means the great Eternal exist but
[49:22] he exists alone right all right that's
[49:25] the word Elohim see and then when you
[49:29] get over in John 1 you go back and check
[49:31] your original we read it in the
[49:33] beginning was the word word was with God
[49:35] and the Word was God the original said
[49:37] in the beginning was Elohim Elohim was
[49:38] with God and Elohim was
[49:41] God self-existing Amen
[49:44] see right one true and living God
[49:47] Amen he has many
[49:50] manifestations right
[49:53] right and there's no problem with being
[49:55] there on the River Jordan when you see
[49:58] Jesus standing here and a dove coming
[50:02] down and a voice speaking and saying
[50:04] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[50:06] pleased to dwell that's no problem amen
[50:09] right that's not three
[50:11] people that's three manifestation
[50:15] right that's more sure of proving one
[50:17] God than it is but we want to use it
[50:19] that's trying to prove that there's got
[50:21] to be three of
[50:23] them and then we come up with the good
[50:26] old Baptist understanding we old good
[50:29] old Baptist I was there Deacon for the
[50:32] Baptist Church and all this that and the
[50:33] other so I know the
[50:35] doctrine we believed in one true and
[50:38] living God that's the way we'd say
[50:41] it but you say well explain that that's
[50:44] what brother Mo said to me that
[50:47] time and I said it's God in three
[50:51] persons he said now you got a little
[50:53] intelligence man of a person is a
[50:56] personality the personality is an
[50:57] individual individual's a person now
[51:00] there's something wrong with what you're
[51:03] saying we're going on to read the rest
[51:05] of that that we quote God in three
[51:08] persons Blessed
[51:10] Trinity and there's no word in the Bible
[51:13] Trinity but then go on with what we was
[51:15] going to say co-equal and co-eternal
[51:19] now go back and read your
[51:22] Creeds co-equal and co-eternal Y how can
[51:25] son be
[51:29] Eternal there's no such thing as an
[51:31] eternal
[51:33] son you can't have
[51:36] that see there's no such thing in the
[51:38] Bible about God the Father you know
[51:41] being Eternal God the son being Eternal
[51:45] God the Holy Ghost being Eternal in the
[51:47] basis of what we think because we're
[51:48] trying to make it as three
[51:52] persons but when we look and see
[51:54] Almighty
[51:56] God and see that he is the Eternal
[52:02] God there is no two or three different
[52:04] Eternal lives
[52:06] right so the sunship see the Catholic
[52:10] Church come of it and so does your
[52:11] Protestants and they call it Eternal
[52:15] sunship now how can you have eternal
[52:17] sunship not any sensible words you don't
[52:21] need an education right right Eternal
[52:24] sunship you
[52:27] brother West are you mean your boy same
[52:29] age you are that don't work out too
[52:34] good and if he lives to be 100 years old
[52:36] he'll never be as old as you
[52:38] are he can't be
[52:41] see all right see then there can't be an
[52:45] eternal
[52:46] sunship but there can be an eternal
[52:48] godship amen right right hallu God was
[52:53] made manifest in flesh
[52:57] God was seen of Angels the scripture
[52:59] says right God was in this world that's
[53:03] right Immortal
[53:07] Eternal all wise God as we're quoting
[53:11] scriptures and that's his
[53:13] image that's what I was trying to get
[53:15] across Wednesday and trying to get to
[53:18] you the image of God right look and see
[53:21] how God came down right I know what do
[53:24] you mean right well listen I got a
[53:26] little sense and I hope that you're
[53:28] awake enough to understand
[53:31] it cuz that's what we do sometimes we
[53:33] sleep and then we don't understand what
[53:35] somebody says we miss it all
[53:38] right but you see we've got to admit now
[53:42] I was thinking about this the other day
[53:43] and I was thinking some way to try to
[53:45] explain you know what I try to
[53:48] say I'm talking about the revealing of
[53:52] God or God being made known amen
[53:55] to you and I right the making known he
[53:59] made known to Moses he wrote five books
[54:02] amen right he made known to Isaiah and
[54:05] Isaiah wrote a complete Bible in itself
[54:08] as far as the the beginning the middle
[54:10] of the ending
[54:11] and he made known his mind to those
[54:14] people to be able to
[54:16] write well that's what I'm depending
[54:18] upon him to do to make known to you and
[54:20] I the word that we can see him right and
[54:24] understand him
[54:26] then we'll see what kind of an image he
[54:27] was so you got to say whatever you want
[54:30] to say whatever words you want to use
[54:33] you've got to say that God had to be
[54:35] able to condescend
[54:38] downward for you and I to understand it
[54:41] right right amen now the wordings you
[54:44] use coming down is terminologies of
[54:46] Greek Hebrew
[54:48] Etc but you got to admit that if you
[54:52] just take a a
[54:54] person you know you take somebody born
[54:57] in
[54:59] Africa and they're they're raised there
[55:03] you know say they're raised back and
[55:05] they've never seen nothing and you bring
[55:06] them to you know time Squire and set
[55:10] them
[55:12] out yeah it'd be Haywire wouldn't it
[55:15] amen they never seen a car they never
[55:18] seen a light they never seen that'd be
[55:21] Haywire see that's the way our doctrines
[55:23] do a lot of times to us
[55:25] they go
[55:27] Haywire God we we think we got it
[55:29] figured
[55:30] out but all I'm saying if God if he says
[55:34] let us make man in our image then every
[55:37] how God came
[55:39] down you know to reveal
[55:43] himself then look at us the same
[55:47] way right and you'll see why we're like
[55:49] we are right amen not this physical part
[55:52] the inward part of us right
[55:55] so then God began to
[55:59] condescend the prophet of God we use
[56:02] that Wednesday you know CU we believe
[56:04] God sent a prophet in the last days am
[56:07] to bring the word of unto us but we
[56:09] don't make him God cuz he's not that
[56:11] there is a lot of people in the message
[56:13] that do make him God you go home click
[56:15] it in your computer run in William
[56:16] brandom and you're going to
[56:17] automatically find out a great big
[56:19] garbage can up front right but just
[56:21] remember the garbage can's always a
[56:23] scarecrow so go and read a little bit
[56:26] more all right but what I'm getting
[56:30] at whatever you want to use the
[56:33] terminologies you got to use something
[56:35] to bring it down to where this mind can
[56:37] see it right so the great Eternal God
[56:40] existing with
[56:42] nothing no Ires no molecules no atoms no
[56:46] no
[56:47] nothing he was self- existing it wasn't
[56:50] any Angels it wasn't any animals it
[56:52] wasn't any
[56:53] things
[56:56] and he begins to want to reveal
[57:02] himself he wants a family
[57:05] right you say well how do you know that
[57:07] brother cuz I'm looking at it now I'm
[57:09] looking at what his predestination has
[57:11] brought his family into being so I don't
[57:14] have any problems with the and you may
[57:16] have trouble with the wording but no
[57:18] problems with the understanding right I
[57:20] can see what he's wanted in his
[57:22] beginning he's now doing that among
[57:24] mankind
[57:25] righten he's revealing
[57:30] himself as he did the first that comes
[57:32] out we'll call it a little Halo of light
[57:35] whatever you want
[57:38] call that was God in another form not
[57:42] another God
[57:44] right right God in another form right I
[57:49] hope you were listening a moment ago
[57:50] when I said there on the River Jordan
[57:52] you got the son here the father over
[57:54] here and seem like the voice here that's
[57:57] not three
[57:59] Gods that's God in another form right
[58:05] right Jesus was standing there one
[58:09] day and they spoke something about
[58:11] Abraham to him and you know what he
[58:16] said he said before Abraham was I am
[58:21] amen
[58:23] amen they said
[58:25] you're a man not even 5050 and say you
[58:28] knew Abraham wasn't what he was saying
[58:30] was it he was simply saying that he was
[58:33] the one that spoke from the burning bush
[58:35] to Moses amen go back and run that I am
[58:39] right go back there to Moses burning
[58:41] bush why did I tell them who sent me
[58:43] said tell them I am sent
[58:45] you Jesus come along and say I am that I
[58:48] am the same as it did back there to
[58:50] Moses cuz it's the same
[58:53] God but not the flesh man that's where
[58:55] we get to
[58:58] trouble see the flesh man come into
[59:00] being about 2,000 years ago Hebrews 105
[59:03] a body thou H has prepared
[59:05] me but it was that same
[59:10] God that created the world
[59:13] Amen yes sir now we're back to where
[59:16] that we were talking about
[59:19] Wednesday that the first part that we
[59:22] could look at and see of God is like a
[59:24] Halo light or whatever you want to call
[59:25] it they use the word
[59:29] theophany they use the word
[59:33] logos and those are simple terminologies
[59:36] of what we we use I mean I'm reading I'm
[59:38] coming out of the the footnotes of
[59:41] Scofield if you want to read
[59:43] them a theop is a body of God that's
[59:46] what it's called
[59:48] amen it a simple word for theophany it
[59:52] means a body of God
[59:55] all right now we as Sinners we had a
[59:59] God
[1:00:01] Amen y right right you know who he was
[1:00:06] amen the guy with the
[1:00:09] horns that we called a booger man
[1:00:12] you so we was a body for God to inhabit
[1:00:16] the devil right you might not like that
[1:00:20] but that's what we are right you look
[1:00:23] down at that little child and it's
[1:00:25] wonderful and sweet and I love him and
[1:00:26] you know
[1:00:29] that brother Wes a little boy the other
[1:00:31] day and set him up on the bar there
[1:00:32] where they could take a picture of him I
[1:00:34] love little kids but you just remember
[1:00:36] what PA what
[1:00:38] um Solomon said about him or David he
[1:00:41] said they're born in sin shapen in
[1:00:43] iniquity spouse my mother's wound a
[1:00:46] liar it's bad to look at a newborn baby
[1:00:49] and say there's a
[1:00:51] liar you don't have to worry about it M
[1:00:55] you just wait till it gets to work and
[1:00:58] talk mama don't lie daddy don't lie oh
[1:01:02] my little baby 2 years old cookie in his
[1:01:05] hand cookie all over his face did you
[1:01:06] get that cookie
[1:01:10] M you don't have to learn to
[1:01:13] lie cuz he's born in this domain right
[1:01:17] and you don't like to call him little
[1:01:18] devil that's that's not good
[1:01:21] words they're are children right CU if
[1:01:25] you going to call them Little Devils
[1:01:26] you're just calling us big Devils right
[1:01:28] cuz they're Offspring all right but you
[1:01:31] get what I'm talking
[1:01:36] about that the great Eternal
[1:01:39] God as he begin to come downward to
[1:01:42] reveal
[1:01:45] himself then you're coming to where it
[1:01:47] says in Genesis you know God created the
[1:01:51] heavens and the Earth amen well now
[1:01:54] course according to the Bible that's why
[1:01:55] we believe in one true and living God
[1:01:58] Amen Jesus Christ according to John 1
[1:02:01] now what's the wording I use I said
[1:02:03] Jesus Christ I didn't say Jesus Jesus
[1:02:05] the flesh I've established that that was
[1:02:07] 2,000 years ago Jesus the Christ
[1:02:10] according to it's Ephesians 3 and9 I
[1:02:13] think it is but Hebrews 1 John
[1:02:17] 1 Colossians 1 all
[1:02:21] says that Jesus Christ created all time
[1:02:28] so he must have been the Christ that was
[1:02:30] back there so Peter was right when Peter
[1:02:32] said now who do you say that I
[1:02:36] am Peter said Thou Art the Christ the
[1:02:39] son of the Living God
[1:02:44] right Jesus said Flesh and Blood didn't
[1:02:46] reveal that unto thee Peter but my
[1:02:48] Father which is in heaven I'll be my
[1:02:50] church on that
[1:02:51] right the Christ the
[1:02:55] Creator so when it says God created all
[1:02:58] things it wasn't Jesus the flesh
[1:03:00] standing there no no get away from that
[1:03:03] see it was the one that was inside of
[1:03:07] him the soul of that man amen that we
[1:03:11] call Jesus
[1:03:12] right the inward part of him was
[1:03:15] almighty God Amen are he was the biggest
[1:03:18] deceiver the world's ever seen and I
[1:03:21] don't believe
[1:03:23] that see then he could say Let There Be
[1:03:27] you're in Genesis 1 right let there be
[1:03:30] let there be let there be all right
[1:03:34] creating all the beautiful things that
[1:03:36] he made there through Genesis
[1:03:40] 1 and that word there in the Greek is
[1:03:44] logos speech right speech see
[1:03:49] logos all right I'm not a Greek scholar
[1:03:52] and I don't but I do like I said I like
[1:03:54] to
[1:03:55] read and that being that you see there
[1:03:58] that was doing the creating was the
[1:04:00] theophany which means a body of
[1:04:04] God we saw a thing down in Atlanta one
[1:04:07] time and they were never allowed to use
[1:04:08] it again at the Passion Play because
[1:04:10] they were uh it was
[1:04:13] copyrighted and it was
[1:04:16] beautiful they saw the world without
[1:04:19] form and void you remember Genesis 1 you
[1:04:22] know and then
[1:04:25] all at once the clouds rolled away and
[1:04:27] here stood this
[1:04:29] man well then that man said let there be
[1:04:34] and they begin to come into being these
[1:04:36] things I'm just telling you they had a
[1:04:38] good point of what they were
[1:04:40] doing we see the scene changed from the
[1:04:43] creation then to a baby crying in a
[1:04:45] cradle
[1:04:48] amen that was that same man that was
[1:04:50] here down in the Cradle which was Jesus
[1:04:52] Christ sir amen but one day on the earth
[1:04:56] on the River Jordan stood the same man
[1:04:59] amen that was standing back there there
[1:05:01] was a good point it was a good
[1:05:03] understanding for us carnal Minds that
[1:05:05] we have CU we believe in one true and
[1:05:08] living God Amen Moses standing there one
[1:05:11] day and what about a man that had talked
[1:05:13] to God lip to ear Etc read it amen but
[1:05:17] one day he said Lord I'd like to see
[1:05:20] you he said I'd just like to see you
[1:05:25] he said look you can't see me
[1:05:28] now you can't do it there's not
[1:05:34] time but he said Moses I tell you what
[1:05:36] you do said you remember that rock that
[1:05:39] you smoked that the water came out that
[1:05:41] watered all of the animals and the thing
[1:05:44] the Bible says go back and read it there
[1:05:47] so go stand in the cliff to the
[1:05:50] Rock cuz that's where he made the cliff
[1:05:52] where could water come out the go stand
[1:05:54] in
[1:05:55] that and he did said you I'll put my
[1:05:58] hand there now I'm just paraphrasing
[1:06:00] scripture but you read it and said when
[1:06:03] he walked by he saw the back part of a
[1:06:04] man
[1:06:06] amen yes that was the word theoy the
[1:06:10] body of God Amen right right you know
[1:06:13] what that same back part of a man one
[1:06:16] day got stripes for you and
[1:06:18] I right or you going to try to get
[1:06:20] another God that's
[1:06:22] right but see he begins to condescend
[1:06:26] downward to be able to let us know what
[1:06:30] he's like amen that's right and then he
[1:06:33] says let us make
[1:06:35] man he said why does it say
[1:06:39] us
[1:06:40] well that's God's way of doing it but
[1:06:43] how else could you say
[1:06:46] it if God has many forms to
[1:06:50] him many ways of making himself manifest
[1:06:55] would there be any problem with coming
[1:06:57] to Jesus walking upon the
[1:07:01] Earth you said well the father was
[1:07:03] inside of him that's right but he prayed
[1:07:07] outwardly
[1:07:10] right he prayed
[1:07:12] outwardly
[1:07:14] why
[1:07:17] because even though God was dwelling in
[1:07:20] that man why do you pray
[1:07:22] outwardly
[1:07:24] come
[1:07:25] on you got the new
[1:07:28] birth is God dwelling in you why do you
[1:07:31] pray out
[1:07:33] loud and why would Jesus say ask the
[1:07:35] father anything in my
[1:07:37] name and he would pray the father
[1:07:42] right that's not two Gods
[1:07:48] no that's God speaking to that greater
[1:07:52] part of him right
[1:07:54] the form that he was the Loos the
[1:07:57] theophany coming out from God is Not
[1:07:59] Another God it's God in another form
[1:08:02] right he just was simply here as I UST
[1:08:05] strating Wednesday and he just stepped
[1:08:07] out right but is he begin to step
[1:08:11] out the human mind is gaining the ground
[1:08:14] to understand God right and like I love
[1:08:18] to say
[1:08:20] it see the terminology is used by the
[1:08:23] scholars is Son of
[1:08:25] God the logos the theophany is called a
[1:08:28] Son of God what I love about it is be
[1:08:31] able to put that in scripture like I was
[1:08:33] telling you when a man there in
[1:08:35] Nebuchadnezzar you remember drove the
[1:08:37] three Hebrew children in the FY
[1:08:41] furnace come on it got so hot he killed
[1:08:43] the ones that told the men you remember
[1:08:44] the Bible right right next morning there
[1:08:48] when it cool down a little bit old
[1:08:49] Nebuchadnezzar goes over and looks down
[1:08:51] in there and he
[1:08:52] says when 1 2
[1:08:56] 3 they didn't burn
[1:08:59] up how come it didn't burn
[1:09:02] up when it even kill the ones that throw
[1:09:04] them in there he says 1 2 3
[1:09:10] four how many did we throw in they said
[1:09:14] three read your
[1:09:16] Bible he said I
[1:09:18] see four men walking
[1:09:21] around yeah it
[1:09:24] wouldn't burn didn't even send your high
[1:09:26] on them
[1:09:28] right and he said that one I see is like
[1:09:32] unto the Son of God Amen that man had a
[1:09:36] great Revelation number one he knew
[1:09:38] whatever was down there to take care of
[1:09:39] them had to be the Eternal God right
[1:09:43] amen number two if he could see
[1:09:46] him he was in another
[1:09:50] form right so he said he's lacking to
[1:09:53] the Son of
[1:09:55] God they took them all out of there and
[1:09:57] wanted to get their God right they
[1:09:59] wanted to know about their
[1:10:01] God you see God is trying to reveal
[1:10:04] himself to you and
[1:10:05] I Amen to make himself known right but
[1:10:10] when he come into that logos or
[1:10:13] speech he could say Let There Be and out
[1:10:16] would come everything that's Genesis
[1:10:18] 1 but then when he got down a little
[1:10:20] further not a shorten in a hurry when he
[1:10:23] got down to the life
[1:10:25] day all right you got to just go back
[1:10:28] and read a little bit to
[1:10:31] understand Man was created on the sixth
[1:10:33] day right there's no creation on the
[1:10:36] seventh we certainly ain't going into
[1:10:38] the eth all right man was created on the
[1:10:42] sixth
[1:10:43] day okay cuz all the animals were
[1:10:46] created and man would have been created
[1:10:48] on the sixth day in Genesis
[1:10:52] 1 but yet you read in Genesis 2 about
[1:10:55] the bringing in of man but you fail to
[1:10:58] read Genesis 2 is just a referring as to
[1:11:02] what happened to Genesis 1 right so it
[1:11:05] says the beginning you know the doings
[1:11:07] in other words Genesis 2 is writing
[1:11:09] down what happened in Genesis 1 the 6th
[1:11:13] day telling you what happened listen
[1:11:16] when he said let us make man in our own
[1:11:18] image and our own likeness image means
[1:11:21] exact
[1:11:22] form
[1:11:25] the best any two uh twins identical
[1:11:29] they're still not identical they'll
[1:11:31] always be something a little bit
[1:11:33] different somewhere right cuz it cannot
[1:11:36] be see God said let us make
[1:11:41] man he's not talking to another being
[1:11:45] like one of father can we do
[1:11:48] this
[1:11:51] no but he's referring to all that God
[1:11:55] has revealed of himself in other forms
[1:11:58] to come down and if you wanted just a
[1:12:01] natural story I'll show you where the
[1:12:03] Prophet said it this way he said he's
[1:12:05] talking to animals about how to make me
[1:12:06] and
[1:12:07] you I love it when he makes it natural
[1:12:11] he said he's talking to animals that's
[1:12:13] right he look around animal said let us
[1:12:15] make
[1:12:19] man you said well did the Animals help
[1:12:22] no it's just way doing it cuz I come I
[1:12:25] said well let us do this all of us don't
[1:12:27] have to get up and go do it right but
[1:12:30] you see what I'm getting at he said let
[1:12:32] us make
[1:12:33] man and he made man a spiritual
[1:12:37] being he made man a spiritual being this
[1:12:40] afternoon we'll pick up going into Adam
[1:12:42] with it but he made man a spiritual
[1:12:45] being
[1:12:47] right he didn't make man like making him
[1:12:50] that's where we don't get the point of
[1:12:52] God in his doings I've spent Services
[1:12:55] trying to explain that when we see
[1:12:59] creation we think of something starting
[1:13:01] when we see beginning we think of
[1:13:03] something beginning you know a starting
[1:13:06] point that's what we've been taught all
[1:13:08] of our lives but that's not so in Bible
[1:13:10] terminologies in Bible terminology when
[1:13:13] it says in the beginning was the word
[1:13:14] the word was with God and the Word was
[1:13:16] God the word's always been Eternal right
[1:13:19] right but it just means there was a time
[1:13:22] that was not comprehend Ended as being
[1:13:24] word but then he be to
[1:13:27] speak and unveil
[1:13:30] himself and bring it
[1:13:33] out and he brought a man
[1:13:35] out and he let that man have dominion
[1:13:38] over the
[1:13:40] garden all the animals in the
[1:13:43] garden looked up to that spiritual being
[1:13:46] because a physical being it took a
[1:13:47] little while before he got there the
[1:13:49] spiritual being was created first not
[1:13:52] created
[1:13:54] that's the
[1:13:55] point where it says in Revelations 3:14
[1:13:58] the beginning of the creation of God now
[1:14:01] there was never a tongue God
[1:14:04] begin
[1:14:06] right that's human
[1:14:08] terminologies ex simply
[1:14:11] meaning in the beginning when this come
[1:14:14] into being that we can comprehend
[1:14:17] right I'm just trying to get you to see
[1:14:20] God there was a time God
[1:14:23] existed totally
[1:14:25] alone yet the prophet of God had said it
[1:14:27] like this he said God's not like the
[1:14:29] wind God is a being he said Heaven's my
[1:14:32] Throne Earth is my foot stol what house
[1:14:35] will you build for
[1:14:39] me he's
[1:14:43] real you don't just get a spirit
[1:14:46] anointing your spirit you wind up being
[1:14:49] an anointed one right
[1:14:52] right you got to have the life that was
[1:14:54] in the very
[1:14:56] God that created us to come into us as
[1:14:59] giving us a new birth not just changing
[1:15:02] our spirit around or it says in what is
[1:15:04] it is Ezekiel what is it uh I create a
[1:15:08] new you know get you a new heart and a
[1:15:10] new
[1:15:11] spirit and we think that's the Holy
[1:15:13] Spirit but he said then I put my spirit
[1:15:14] in you that's it amen that's right new
[1:15:17] heart and new spirit is a good idea
[1:15:18] alcoholic synonymous go through it every
[1:15:21] day getting people helped doing a good
[1:15:23] job
[1:15:25] right but they can't convert the person
[1:15:28] n right amen but if you can touch that
[1:15:31] Soul you don't have to worry about him
[1:15:32] drinking no more no amen right that's
[1:15:35] right you mean a drunk can be born again
[1:15:37] I believe it amen that's right abely
[1:15:41] there's nothing mankind could do so bad
[1:15:43] that he can't be saved
[1:15:45] amen except one thing blaspheming the
[1:15:48] holy
[1:15:49] spirit amen making fun of God and
[1:15:52] triping in the works of of God to the
[1:15:53] devil and now from then on that can't be
[1:15:55] done but that's the only
[1:15:58] thing right you can't be dirty enough
[1:16:02] that God can't save you cuz that's who
[1:16:04] he come to
[1:16:05] save he said the righteous don't need no
[1:16:08] salvation that's what Jesus said
[1:16:12] yep but those that are
[1:16:15] lost we see created man then in the
[1:16:18] image of
[1:16:19] God he created him in a theophany a
[1:16:23] logos a form higher than all the thing
[1:16:26] let's just call it the holy spirit amen
[1:16:30] let's just say it this way that God just
[1:16:32] took part of his spirit and put it over
[1:16:35] in a position to be called Adam right
[1:16:40] amen the Holy Spirit was in the garden
[1:16:42] the prophet said to lead those animals
[1:16:46] the Holy Spirit was in Adam to lead
[1:16:48] those that's spiritually speaking then
[1:16:50] when he was made physically he had
[1:16:52] control of the animals physically that's
[1:16:54] right right that's why they still have
[1:16:56] that control that that fear see because
[1:16:58] it comes all the way
[1:17:00] down but he created God God created Man
[1:17:03] In His
[1:17:04] Image what does God look
[1:17:08] like Abraham met a man one
[1:17:11] day and he called him MDC y Paul speaks
[1:17:16] of him in Romans
[1:17:18] 7 believe that's right seven where he
[1:17:22] speaks of M desic and he called him a
[1:17:25] man y amen yes sir that's what my whole
[1:17:30] point come on musician my whole point is
[1:17:33] we think we're
[1:17:35] something but just remember God created
[1:17:39] us what do you want to make it physical
[1:17:41] or spiritual or whatever he created
[1:17:43] you it is he that hath made us and not
[1:17:46] we ourselves the scripture we are his
[1:17:48] people in the Sheep of his Pastor amen
[1:17:52] amen
[1:17:54] see to understand the image that God
[1:17:57] would bring down and then bring man in
[1:17:59] that image and we'll pick up a little
[1:18:01] more this afternoon then we'll get on
[1:18:03] into the natural image of Adam
[1:18:06] amen and Adam had control of the
[1:18:10] animals but you know Eve did too sure
[1:18:13] amen yes
[1:18:15] sir but they were just a time that Eve
[1:18:17] was not in existence when Adam was
[1:18:20] created first physical he was male and
[1:18:22] female right amen read your Bible that's
[1:18:25] right then he took the rib from Adam and
[1:18:29] made
[1:18:30] Eve he called her a help meat not a help
[1:18:35] mate he called him a help meat that's
[1:18:37] right which means something part of you
[1:18:41] right God had a plan and a purpose to
[1:18:44] reveal himself Amen to Mankind and we
[1:18:47] see that unveiling before
[1:18:49] us as to see him and who he is right
[1:18:53] let's Stand
