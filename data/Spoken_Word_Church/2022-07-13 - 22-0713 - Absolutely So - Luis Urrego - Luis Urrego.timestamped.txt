[5:43] and uh so while you're standing this
[5:46] this evening we want to go ahead to the
[5:47] book of second peter chapter one
[5:50] ii peter chapter 1
[5:53] and we're going to read here from verses
[5:54] 1 through 12 a very familiar scripture
[5:57] here in this in this
[5:59] in this church
[6:02] because we believe it
[6:04] amen we believe it
[6:09] second peter 1 verse 1 says simon peter
[6:11] a servant and an apostle of jesus christ
[6:14] to them that have obtained like precious
[6:17] faith with us
[6:18] through the righteousness of god and our
[6:21] savior jesus christ
[6:23] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[6:25] through the knowledge of god and of
[6:28] jesus our lord
[6:30] according as his divine power hath given
[6:33] unto us all things
[6:35] has given unto us all things that
[6:38] pertain unto life and godliness
[6:40] so i like that it says they're hath
[6:43] given unto us all things amen
[6:46] praise god it's all it's all in you amen
[6:48] we just got to let it out
[6:50] those virtues are holy ghost virtues
[6:53] they've been given to you you just got
[6:55] to let them out praise god as you live
[6:57] as you go through trials go through life
[7:00] that's when these virtues start being
[7:02] displayed through the knowledge of him
[7:04] that hath called us to glory and virtue
[7:06] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[7:09] great and precious promises
[7:11] that by these ye may be partakers of the
[7:14] divine nature having escaped the
[7:17] corruption that is in the world through
[7:19] lust
[7:20] and beside this given all diligence
[7:23] add to your faith
[7:25] virtue and to virtue knowledge into
[7:28] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[7:31] patience
[7:32] and to patience godliness and to
[7:34] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[7:36] brotherly kindness charity
[7:38] for if these things be in you and abound
[7:42] they make you that ye shall neither be
[7:45] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[7:47] of our lord jesus christ
[7:50] but he that lacketh these things is
[7:53] blind
[7:55] so it's important to have them right
[7:57] otherwise you're going to be blind
[7:59] spiritually
[8:00] and cannot see afar off
[8:03] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[8:05] from his old sins
[8:07] wherefore the rather brethren
[8:10] give dylan this is what i want to
[8:11] concentrate on where for the rather
[8:13] brother and give diligence to make your
[8:15] calling an election sure
[8:18] sure
[8:20] amen when you are sure you're sure
[8:23] right when something is sure
[8:25] it's sure it's it's it's stable
[8:28] for if you do these things ye shall
[8:31] never
[8:32] fall
[8:33] because you're sure
[8:35] amen you shall never fall
[8:39] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[8:42] unto you abundantly into the everlasting
[8:45] kingdom of our lord and savior jesus
[8:47] christ and verse 12 says wherefore i
[8:50] will not be negligent to put you always
[8:54] in remembrance of these things
[8:56] though you know them
[8:58] and be established or in other words be
[9:01] sure
[9:02] be established
[9:05] in the present truth
[9:07] praise the lord jesus
[9:09] amen so this morning this this evening
[9:11] we want to talk about i'm going to title
[9:13] it absolutely so
[9:15] and uh
[9:16] my wife may be smiling
[9:19] but absolutely so the importance of
[9:22] having an absolute in your life
[9:25] amen and i want to talk to all of us but
[9:29] i want our young people to listen as
[9:30] well amen reason why i say absolutely so
[9:33] is because
[9:35] you know in speaking that i remember
[9:37] brother marcus becker from germany
[9:39] whenever you talk to him and then you
[9:41] give him a a a a a a sentence or you or
[9:45] you make a statement to him
[9:47] and say brothers uh marcus such and such
[9:50] and such and then he'll go absolutely so
[9:52] [Laughter]
[9:54] absolutely so
[9:56] uh what's
[9:57] uh and then there's another one that he
[9:59] says i can't remember what it is but
[10:01] that always stuck to me
[10:03] so
[10:04] since we're supposed to have an absolute
[10:07] right
[10:08] it's got to be absolutely so
[10:10] amen praise god so hopefully you'll
[10:12] never forget this title
[10:14] absolutely so
[10:17] all right let's just go to the lord in
[10:18] prayer our heavenly father we thank you
[10:20] lord jesus once again for the
[10:22] opportunity to serve you lord to open
[10:24] back the pages of your word we ask
[10:26] father that you would just uh speak to
[10:28] our hearts lord god almighty you fill in
[10:30] the gaps lord jesus wherever father god
[10:33] we've studied we've done what we could
[10:35] lord god but you're the one that knows
[10:37] the needs of the people here father and
[10:39] you can fill in those gaps you can speak
[10:41] to the hearts
[10:42] directly father god to and to whatever
[10:45] that need may be lord jesus father i ask
[10:47] that you would just change us through
[10:49] your word father because without your
[10:51] word father we cannot be changed without
[10:53] your holy spirit we cannot change lord
[10:55] it takes your holy spirit father to
[10:57] change us and it's a change father that
[11:00] has to take place from the inside out i
[11:02] pray lord that you'd bless and continue
[11:04] to meet the needs amongst us father and
[11:06] lord you just have your will in your way
[11:07] tonight help me to get aside lord so
[11:09] that you speak lord and forgive us for
[11:12] all of our sins lord god and father just
[11:14] we just commit this rest of the service
[11:16] into your hands in jesus christ's name
[11:18] amen amen god bless you saints
[11:22] praise the lord good to have brother
[11:23] micah here with us this afternoon
[11:27] and each and every one of you
[11:29] i trust that
[11:31] trust that everyone's doing well
[11:33] praise the lord absolutely so
[11:36] or exactly so that's the other one that
[11:38] he would say exactly so
[11:41] amen
[11:42] so i i'm i'm if you go back and you read
[11:46] brother branham where he preached an
[11:48] absolute i'm pretty much getting a lot
[11:49] of this from from that sermon but we'll
[11:52] just go and i want to talk to a couple
[11:54] of things that that brother branham
[11:56] didn't touch upon in that sermon but
[11:58] but uh i think it's very relevant to
[12:00] this day especially especially for our
[12:02] young people and uh
[12:04] but we we see here that that in in in
[12:07] living life uh saints
[12:09] you you can't live life without you
[12:11] standing on something you see
[12:13] you you've got to stand for something
[12:15] and you've got to you've got to you
[12:17] you've got to sometimes make a stand
[12:20] amen and when you say that you make a
[12:22] stand that means you're standing on that
[12:24] point and you're standing on that and
[12:26] nothing can move you from that
[12:28] praise god and and and you could take
[12:31] for for example uh brother brown made a
[12:34] statement where you could take for
[12:35] example a red light amen the red light
[12:37] when you're when you're driving down the
[12:38] road and and you see those red lights
[12:41] amen those are those are absolutes for
[12:44] for traffic
[12:45] amen when you see a red light that's in
[12:47] red
[12:47] amen there's not a human being there
[12:49] taking you know telling you to stop but
[12:52] that is that is an absolute for you to
[12:53] stop
[12:54] you must stop
[12:56] otherwise there'll be there'll be chaos
[12:58] and when it says green you go
[13:01] man because that is the absolute that is
[13:03] what we
[13:05] we abide by in order to get traffic
[13:08] flowing you see
[13:10] we have to have an absolute when we when
[13:13] we when we have traffic man when we're
[13:15] out driving in traffic
[13:17] amen and you can take you also look for
[13:19] example a a a a boat amen and and a boat
[13:23] has to have
[13:25] an anchor in order especially the big
[13:27] boats they have to have anchors in order
[13:29] for them to be able to
[13:31] stand still while
[13:33] while parked you see otherwise the winds
[13:36] will come or a storm will come through
[13:38] and then take that boat and then that
[13:40] boat starts drifting off into the sea
[13:42] and the owner is like where's my yacht
[13:46] and you got to have an anchor amen you
[13:49] got to have to have something that that
[13:52] that anchor has to stick on firm ground
[13:56] amen where that boat cannot move from
[13:58] there praise god and i'm so thankful
[14:01] lord that our lord jesus christ is our
[14:03] anchor in this hour amen because brother
[14:05] brown uh
[14:07] there's that song you know the anchor
[14:09] holds amen though the ship is battered
[14:11] the ankle the anchor holds amen your
[14:13] anchor won't hold but but amen but his
[14:16] anchor wills amen and he is the anchor
[14:18] and when you get a hold and and you put
[14:20] confidence in that amen you can leave
[14:22] your boat amen right there in confidence
[14:25] and say and say my boat's going to be
[14:26] okay
[14:27] amen my life is going to be okay because
[14:30] i put my confidence in that anchor amen
[14:33] and that anchor is the word of god amen
[14:35] my children are going to be okay because
[14:37] i place them in in that anchor amen and
[14:40] that anchor is the word of god amen my
[14:42] church family is going to be okay my
[14:44] body is going to be all right because i
[14:46] place my confidence in that anchor and i
[14:48] know that that that won't move anywhere
[14:51] amen that captain has
[14:53] he totally puts confidence in that
[14:55] anchor that when he lets it down right
[14:59] he'll come back the next day and his
[15:01] boat would be right there
[15:03] amen when you look at the scripture and
[15:04] when you put your faith in it right
[15:06] rightly
[15:08] then it'll be able to stand
[15:11] amen otherwise
[15:12] if it's just you
[15:14] reading and then you give your own
[15:15] opinion about it it they won't stand
[15:19] amen but just read it and take it like
[15:21] as it is and go with it amen it'll stand
[15:24] the word of god speaks for itself
[15:27] amen it takes god god said let there be
[15:30] light amen and that what was the
[15:31] manifestation of that light is that it
[15:33] appeared
[15:35] the confirmation of that word is that
[15:36] that light came to be
[15:38] amen the word
[15:40] manifests or confirms itself
[15:43] you don't have to push and and shove
[15:45] amen it manifests itself as long as you
[15:47] put faith in that word of god amen
[15:50] praise the lord jesus so bold anchor
[15:52] amen brother brandon would say like this
[15:54] he says that that is the way a man when
[15:56] he is born again of the holy spirit he's
[15:59] got a hold of something that's got an
[16:01] anchor out yonder and the storms doesn't
[16:04] shake him
[16:05] he knows he's all right he's anchored
[16:07] all right
[16:09] amen you know that nothing can shake you
[16:12] you know that the current present
[16:13] conditions won't shake you if you're
[16:15] standing on the anchor if you're holding
[16:18] on the word amen standing fast on that
[16:21] word praise god you could take also for
[16:24] example a couple that that's planning to
[16:26] get married
[16:27] and what's going to hold them
[16:31] the only thing that can hold them they
[16:32] better be getting married for love
[16:36] not because i i i want his money later
[16:38] on or her money later on or i want amen
[16:41] as a matter of fact you should actually
[16:43] join all those things together
[16:45] it's not your money anymore it's not his
[16:46] money anymore it's our money
[16:49] amen it's it's our it's everything is
[16:51] ours amen so so uh
[16:54] i better be careful with that but
[16:58] i believe that with all my heart i mean
[17:00] i've been married 16 16 years
[17:03] right 16 years sweetheart
[17:10] and you know what it works
[17:13] because that's that's how it's supposed
[17:14] to be
[17:15] amen two two people become one
[17:18] so it's not my bed it's our bed
[17:21] it's not my chair it's our chairs not my
[17:23] money it's our money
[17:25] amen but you should get married amen
[17:28] what anchors both of you is love
[17:30] amen the love that you have for her the
[17:32] love that you have for him amen that
[17:34] should be an absolute that that will
[17:37] help drive your marriage amen
[17:39] i love her and that's what drives me no
[17:41] matter what i got to give up i got to
[17:43] give up time to play my video games i
[17:46] can't do that anymore

[17:59] the children i got to do fatherly things
[18:01] now you see
[18:03] there's things that you must give up so

[18:07] absolute that should drive us and help
[18:09] us amen in our in our in our in our
[18:12] marriage praise the lord amen we read in
[18:14] the bible where all where the different

[18:27] all of his children and and and and his
[18:29] house amen just everything went falling
[18:32] apart
[18:34] he had to have something to anchor him
[18:37] amen
[18:38] and and
[18:40] it's not promised to us that our life is
[18:42] going to be easy the way it is now
[18:44] amen things change
[18:46] things thing thing people change
[18:50] situations change you've got to have
[18:52] something amen to stand on in this hour

[18:57] can't be dr so-and-so
[18:59] amen doctor
[19:01] this that or the other amen it's got to

[22:19] believe amen
[22:21] what do i truly believe
[22:23] do i really have an absolute in my life
[22:26] do i really have an anchor in my life
[22:29] because the world won't give you
[22:31] anything like that the world gives you
[22:33] things that are wishy-washy
[22:35] one day
[22:36] one day where where
[22:38] they're believing this the next day
[22:40] they're believing or not something else
[22:42] amen you can see it in the news amen the
[22:44] news one day is this the next day is
[22:46] something else the next day is something
[22:47] else and what happened three days before
[22:49] nobody will remember anymore
[22:53] constant change constant change but
[22:55] god's word never changed ever since that
[22:58] it was spoken and written amen it never
[23:01] has changed
[23:03] and it's still changing lives
[23:06] it doesn't change but it changes lives
[23:09] hallelujah praise the lord
[23:12] what a wonderful thing
[23:14] and it's not just the physical words in
[23:16] that book amen it's the spirit that
[23:18] gives life
[23:19] amen when you take that
[23:21] personally to you
[23:23] and say that promise is mine
[23:26] it will come to pass
[23:28] amen
[23:29] i believe sister freda the past several
[23:31] weeks i i think she took god
[23:34] seriously
[23:36] hey man when do you have to have a
[23:38] situation like that to take god
[23:39] seriously
[23:40] i hope not i i don't want to and i want
[23:43] to take god seriously now
[23:45] amen
[23:46] but i believe she took god seriously and
[23:48] i believe god is you pl you do business
[23:51] with me i'll do business with you
[23:53] let's sit at the table and you you take
[23:55] god you take my word
[23:58] at heart
[23:59] and i'll i'll fulfill my word
[24:02] and we're seeing it come to pass praise
[24:04] the lord jesus and i believe we're going
[24:06] to see greater things
[24:07] amen praise the lord jesus abraham had
[24:10] to have an absolute amen praise the lord
[24:13] jesus he was living his life amen
[24:16] working living doing
[24:18] amen but one day god told him to go move
[24:21] to a strange land that he had never even
[24:23] heard of
[24:25] and he had to believe that that was god
[24:26] talking to him
[24:27] amen several years had passed god told
[24:30] him you're going to have a child and
[24:32] that child is going to be between it's
[24:35] going to be from your loins
[24:37] and sarah was the one who was going to
[24:38] bear that child
[24:41] and he had to believe that that was
[24:42] going to happen even though amen it
[24:45] seemed like it was an impossibility
[24:47] amen amen you know
[24:50] uh abraham's life all the different
[24:52] things even up to the point where god
[24:54] told them go sacrifice that child
[24:58] how many of us would be willing to do
[24:59] something like that
[25:01] but see abraham had to know that it was
[25:04] god
[25:05] or that absolute talking to him
[25:08] because if he was if he wasn't sure i
[25:10] don't know it could have been the devil
[25:11] talking to me so i'm not going to do it
[25:12] no he knew that it was god talking to
[25:14] him therefore he took action
[25:17] amen but he also had that promise in his
[25:19] heart amen that through the loins of
[25:22] this of this son of mine that i was
[25:24] going to have many many generations
[25:28] many children and many people great
[25:30] people would rise up out of so he knew
[25:32] that some way somehow isaac had to live
[25:37] he that it wasn't that wasn't his end
[25:40] amen and abraham had to have an absolute
[25:43] had to have an anchor that that was god
[25:46] speaking to him do you have an anchor
[25:48] that that is god speaking to you through
[25:50] his word
[25:51] praise the lord jesus
[25:53] when he sees when when you read
[25:55] something in the word and you and and
[25:58] and you're going through a certain need
[25:59] you're going through a certain trial you
[26:00] see it in the word amen why don't why
[26:03] not just believe it
[26:04] why not just take it to you personally
[26:06] like abraham did
[26:09] and say god i don't know how it's going
[26:10] to be done but
[26:12] you said it and i believe it
[26:14] that settles it for me
[26:16] let me just go ahead and take the wood
[26:17] and let me go ahead and just do what
[26:19] exactly what abraham did and abraham
[26:21] didn't even have the holy ghost
[26:24] you and i have the holy ghost in this
[26:26] hour
[26:27] praise god
[26:29] you can read about moses and about paul
[26:31] amen and the different ones shadrach
[26:33] meshach and abednego daniel had an
[26:35] absolute amen it doesn't matter what the
[26:38] world says the ma the world told him he
[26:40] couldn't go to church anymore he
[26:41] couldn't pray anymore amen he still
[26:44] opened those doors and he prayed three
[26:45] times a day
[26:47] and he didn't care if the king saw him
[26:48] either
[26:49] he didn't care if if if if who saw him
[26:53] amen he was he was worshiping his
[26:54] absolute
[26:56] his absolute wasn't was in the white
[26:58] house his absolute wasn't wasn't any
[27:00] anybody else a man it was it was god
[27:04] praise the lord jesus amen so we all got
[27:07] to have an absolute in this hour saints
[27:11] and and the reason why i felt so
[27:12] compelled to to to i've just been
[27:15] thinking about this i i really enjoyed
[27:17] the other the other day brother brother
[27:19] bob preaching on on on on that message
[27:22] he preached kind of sort of on these
[27:23] lines
[27:24] amen
[27:26] and and and we see amen
[27:29] nowadays how how how truth
[27:32] has been so skewed
[27:34] that there's there's no truth now
[27:36] amongst
[27:38] even amongst our christian young people
[27:42] they're almost as afraid to stand on
[27:45] something yeah
[27:46] it's almost and it's not their fault
[27:48] this is the culture around them that
[27:50] tells them that it's okay for you to
[27:52] have your truth and it's okay for me to
[27:55] have my truth
[27:57] and they were both right
[28:00] when the word of god totally says the
[28:02] opposite
[28:04] jesus christ didn't say
[28:06] you have your way your truth and your
[28:08] life and i have my way my truth in my
[28:10] life no he said i am
[28:13] the way the truth and the life and he
[28:16] didn't say i am a way a truth or a life
[28:20] he said i am the american the means the
[28:24] the only one
[28:26] the the only thing
[28:28] amen
[28:29] he is the only source of truth

[30:40] especially our young people we've made
[30:42] that whatever you see on media or
[30:44] whatever you see on youtube it must be
[30:46] the truth
[30:47] it's kind of the same thing as our older
[30:50] generations when they saw uh in the
[30:52] 1930s 40s and 50s if it was on tv it
[30:56] must be true
[30:59] same thing now

[31:04] internet well it must be true
[31:07] google said it so
[31:09] yeah
[31:11] but you
[31:12] you got to research things out yourself
[31:15] amen just because somebody said
[31:17] something is true amen or showed you
[31:19] that something is true doesn't mean it's
[31:21] true
[31:22] praise the lord jesus you got to know
[31:25] things for yourself amen praise god
[31:27] so we got to make we got to have we got
[31:30] to make his word our absolute in this
[31:32] hour look what brother brown says here
[31:33] he says oh you might say i wish that all
[31:36] he required today
[31:38] i wish that that's how he required today
[31:40] he was speaking of job's
[31:42] requirement about uh you know offering
[31:44] burnt offerings to for him and his
[31:46] family but but look what brother brown
[31:48] says it's less than that he says
[31:50] he says just just faith in his word
[31:53] amen and you if you make his word your
[31:56] absolute you can
[31:58] any divine promise in the bible you
[32:00] could tie your soul to it
[32:03] any divine promise
[32:05] amen i can't i can't time my soul to to
[32:08] a tick-tock influencer
[32:10] no he he will fail
[32:12] amen i i can't tie my soul to to anybody
[32:16] else amen on on on in the media amen
[32:20] they will fail they change from one hour
[32:21] to the other
[32:23] amen but this word will never pass away
[32:26] this word has never failed amen and if
[32:28] we could raise everybody
[32:31] that has been blessed by this word the
[32:33] the
[32:35] billions of christians probably that
[32:37] have lived and anchored their souls to
[32:39] this word amen
[32:41] what would they tell you and me
[32:44] amen those that died in the coliseums
[32:46] back in the dark ages
[32:48] amen they had to have an anchor
[32:51] they had to have something that they
[32:52] were standing on in order to go and say
[32:55] i give my life for what for jesus christ
[33:02] are you willing to do that in this hour
[33:07] what what is so important to you that
[33:09] you're willing to die for
[33:11] right
[33:13] think about that
[33:16] we got to die for something
[33:18] we should we got to we we got to stand
[33:20] for something
[33:22] what are you willing to die for
[33:28] i want to die for the lord jesus christ
[33:31] if i have to
[33:33] amen but you see
[33:35] in serving him you actually do do that
[33:38] spiritually
[33:39] you have to die to yourself
[33:42] in order to live for him
[33:44] you see what i'm saying praise the lord
[33:45] jesus
[33:46] now so when god gives when god gives an
[33:49] absolute amen he always gives
[33:52] the vindication of that absolute amen
[33:55] all these people that had absolutes in
[33:57] their life amen moses david and all
[33:59] these amen god vindicated that absolute
[34:02] in their life some way or another amen
[34:04] moses was given a vindication of that
[34:06] absolute by that burning bush
[34:08] amen that vindicated to him that that is
[34:10] something that he could stand on
[34:12] because it was real
[34:14] he experienced it he knew he was there
[34:17] praise the lord jesus our problem is is
[34:19] that we haven't fully experienced a man
[34:21] had a full experience with god
[34:24] amen
[34:26] we know him intellectually
[34:28] we know him by the books
[34:30] we know him by the words we know him by
[34:33] the scriptures we've read and we've
[34:35] known him by maybe
[34:36] father or priest so and so or somebody
[34:39] telling us in the church that that's how
[34:41] god is amen but do you know him for
[34:43] yourself
[34:45] have you experienced his power have you
[34:47] experienced his healing have you
[34:48] experienced amen what he could do for
[34:50] you
[34:52] praise the lord jesus
[34:54] amen it's like a blueprint and and
[34:56] brother brother anderson if you could
[34:58] bring those pictures up how many know
[35:00] what a blueprint is
[35:02] oh my
[35:06] goodness
[35:07] praise the lord
[35:09] now if those who don't know what a
[35:11] blueprint this is more of a modern
[35:13] blueprint but this is a blueprint of a
[35:15] house right well blueprint is a plan
[35:20] right it's a plan that lets those that
[35:23] are going to build or the ones that want
[35:25] this house built
[35:26] what things are going to be
[35:28] so in this case the kitchen's going to
[35:30] be a certain certain uh place the living
[35:33] room's going to be a certain place the
[35:35] closet uh even
[35:38] if they go next next one
[35:40] there's blueprints where they tell you
[35:42] exactly where everything is
[35:45] this is a hand-drawn blueprint
[35:48] now to you and me that doesn't make any
[35:50] sense
[35:53] right
[35:54] now we know that the word of god is a
[35:56] blueprint
[35:57] it's the blueprint for you to be saved
[36:00] it's the blueprint it's the plan of god
[36:02] for you to receive the holy ghost it's
[36:04] the plan of god for you to receive your
[36:06] healing amen but many people look at
[36:09] that blueprint amen and it's just like
[36:11] looking at this blueprint i got no idea
[36:14] why because you're not the author of
[36:16] that blueprint if we went and asked the
[36:18] author of that blueprint sir what did
[36:20] you mean that 15 by 20 right here under
[36:23] the family room he'll tell you exactly
[36:25] what he meant
[36:26] praise god and and instead of you asking
[36:29] so and so or my friend so and so amen
[36:32] what does the word of god mean about
[36:34] this what what is your opinion about
[36:36] this amen why don't you just go and ask
[36:37] the author instead amen the author of
[36:40] the word will tell you what the word
[36:42] meant by that
[36:44] praise the lord jesus
[36:46] just like the author of the blueprint
[36:47] we'll tell you exactly what everything
[36:50] there is if you want to know
[36:52] but he's not going to tell you if you
[36:53] don't want to know
[36:56] because he might border your death but
[36:58] somebody that really wants to know
[37:01] that really wants to know about the word
[37:02] of god
[37:04] amen he'll tell you
[37:06] if you really want it praise the lord
[37:08] next
[37:09] and there's just some other ones right
[37:11] here more blueprints i got no idea what
[37:14] that is
[37:15] but the one that created it does
[37:18] i can't explain everything in the word
[37:20] but the one that wrote the word can
[37:22] amen and he's and he's revealed his word
[37:25] in this day amen praise god he sent us a
[37:28] prophet in this day amen and
[37:30] and we have clarification about that
[37:33] word in this hour next
[37:35] and here's what a there's a blueprint
[37:37] right here
[37:38] a true one
[37:41] so that's really what a blueprint looks
[37:42] like right there
[37:44] all right i think that's it
[37:47] so
[37:49] so you might you want to know how your
[37:51] how your spiritual house needs to be
[37:53] built look at the blueprint
[37:55] man what
[37:57] what if you told somebody if you made
[37:59] plans about having a house built
[38:02] and they came back and and you you gave
[38:05] them a blueprint
[38:06] and you coordinated everything
[38:09] in the in detail with them and then it
[38:11] took maybe three four five six months to
[38:14] build a house you come back and you look
[38:16] at and you're excited about that house
[38:18] my goodness i can't wait to see the
[38:19] house
[38:21] and then you look at it
[38:22] and that house is not
[38:25] anything
[38:26] according to the blueprint
[38:28] what would you tell them
[38:30] well that's your truth then
[38:33] that's true your truth and and my truth
[38:37] no
[38:38] you would tell them i'm sorry this is
[38:40] not what we agreed upon
[38:44] there's a standard we wrote it on the
[38:47] blueprint
[38:48] you confirmed that with me and now i see
[38:52] here i'm looking at the house that i'm
[38:53] so excited to see and i see that the
[38:56] windows
[38:57] there's no window here where there's
[38:58] supposed to be a window there's no the
[39:00] bathtub is not even there where it's
[39:02] supposed to be and all things are
[39:04] totally different from the blueprint
[39:08] you're gonna tell them tear that thing
[39:10] down and rebuild it
[39:12] amen that's the reason why there is no
[39:15] room for
[39:16] your own blueprint
[39:18] or your own truth there's only room for
[39:21] the truth
[39:22] amen and the truth is the blueprint amen
[39:26] praise the lord jesus the word of god
[39:28] amen
[39:30] amen
[39:31] no nobody nobody will say oh we'll just
[39:33] leave it like that then okay if you
[39:36] really want that house the way you want
[39:37] it amen you're going to do something
[39:39] about it
[39:40] you're going to stand on something
[39:42] you're going to stand to be uh to make
[39:44] sure that that's done properly
[39:47] and that's the reason why young people
[39:49] amen that our parents and ministers they
[39:53] stand on the word of god the way they do
[39:56] amen because it can't just be any way
[39:58] it's got to be exactly according to the
[40:00] blueprint or it's not any or anything or
[40:02] not
[40:04] it's got to go exactly by the blueprint
[40:07] and the blueprint said how do i get
[40:09] received the holy ghost amen you've got
[40:11] to repent
[40:13] then be baptized in the name of the lord
[40:15] jesus christ for the remission of those
[40:18] sins then you shall receive the gift of
[40:20] the holy ghost that is the blueprint of
[40:22] god and that will make sure that will
[40:25] make sure that your house will stand
[40:27] and they will look exactly the way the
[40:29] word of god says
[40:31] how many are following me
[40:33] praise the lord jesus you are being so
[40:35] good and paying attention praise the
[40:37] lord jesus
[40:40] all right and i want to deal with this
[40:41] for just a moment about your truth
[40:42] versus the truth amen
[40:45] because it's a phrase that i keep
[40:46] hearing
[40:47] a lot uh you hear it on social media a
[40:50] lot and on the internet you hear a lot
[40:52] of young people nowadays talking about
[40:54] well it's my truth
[40:55] and it's your truth
[40:57] but there's no such a thing
[41:01] let me i'll tell you the reason why
[41:03] because
[41:06] amen or you hear the phrase speak your
[41:08] truth amen
[41:12] and really these are phrases that we
[41:14] should actually refrain from using
[41:15] especially as christians
[41:18] amen because we don't have our own truth
[41:21] where amen
[41:22] we're
[41:24] and and what that leads us amen uh
[41:27] because i read something and it said
[41:28] that words build were worlds
[41:32] amen so whatever whatev whenever you
[41:35] hear this phrase and it's become and
[41:37] it's become more and more popular amen
[41:40] it starts making it it starts
[41:42] normalizing it for the people
[41:45] until
[41:45] they just say it and don't even think
[41:47] about it anymore
[41:49] how many how many words and phrases have
[41:50] we have we
[41:52] you know taken throughout the years and
[41:54] and we say them now and we we don't even
[41:56] think about it anymore they're just part
[41:57] of our vocabulary anymore we don't even
[42:00] go back and see where that stems from or
[42:02] where that's coming from
[42:04] amen but you have your truth and i have
[42:07] my own truth you you do you and i do me
[42:11] you do you
[42:13] what does that mean
[42:15] what is that supposed to mean
[42:18] for one it gives an a it gives actually
[42:20] an attitude of like i don't care about
[42:22] you
[42:25] whatever happens to you
[42:27] that's not my concern
[42:32] right
[42:33] now here's a few problems with that
[42:35] phrase my truth
[42:37] amen
[42:39] was what it what it
[42:41] it makes us think
[42:42] that we are our own source of truth
[42:47] when in reality we are not
[42:50] amen you didn't come to this world amen
[42:53] by yourself
[42:55] you didn't create yourself
[42:57] amen you have a creator therefore he is
[42:59] the source of truth
[43:01] praise the lord
[43:03] amen
[43:04] all your truth amen you give it up to
[43:06] him
[43:07] you give it up to this truth
[43:10] amen you have no truth for yourself so
[43:13] it makes us look like that that that you
[43:16] are your own source of of knowledge
[43:20] in reality that's make it raising
[43:23] yourself and making yourself
[43:27] it brings it leads to pride
[43:29] leads to pride
[43:31] it also gives false impressions that the
[43:33] truth is is rocky or fluid
[43:37] in other words that there is nothing
[43:39] absolute
[43:40] well that's your truth but i have my
[43:43] truth
[43:44] so where what is the truth then
[43:47] this you see what i'm trying to ask
[43:51] what is the truth then your truth and my
[43:53] truth okay but where is the truth
[43:56] amen
[43:58] in other words that truth can change
[43:59] that's what that phrase makes it sound
[44:01] like it gives the impression that truth
[44:03] is not consistent
[44:06] that's what that phrase gives that there
[44:09] is no consistency in truth
[44:12] but the truth is always consistent
[44:15] amen
[44:16] and it leaves people with nothing
[44:18] constant or reliable to stand on
[44:22] when i tell you well that's my truth and
[44:25] you have your truth
[44:27] i mean it doesn't leave it doesn't leave
[44:30] anything reliable to stand on i can't
[44:32] stand on your truth
[44:34] and you can't stand on my truth so
[44:37] therefore
[44:38] it's mediocre
[44:40] there's there it's just the middle
[44:42] ground
[44:44] and there's no truth and that's what the
[44:46] world is trying to portray to us in this
[44:48] hour
[44:49] there's nothing for you to stand on
[44:52] you have nothing to stand on that's what
[44:54] they want you to think and when you
[44:56] don't have anything to stand on amen
[44:58] that you easily fall for anything
[45:01] you fall for anything and everything
[45:03] they tell you
[45:05] when you don't have
[45:07] nothing to stand on but it's cloaked as
[45:10] my truth and your tooth and your truth
[45:12] in reality what it is is my opinion and
[45:15] your opinion
[45:17] that's what that is
[45:18] it's not your truth or it's not my truth
[45:22] amen
[45:24] your truth is just as good as mine
[45:27] so no one is wrong
[45:30] no one is wrong nobody gets offended
[45:33] because it's all about nobody gets
[45:35] offended anymore you know
[45:37] everybody that participates gets a prize
[45:40] you know it used to be when i was in
[45:42] school amen you only got a prize when
[45:45] you won
[45:48] there was first second and third place
[45:50] you got a prize if you worked hard and
[45:53] you won
[45:55] now everybody gets a prize
[45:58] everybody
[46:00] it's mediocracy
[46:02] let me tell you what mediocracy means
[46:04] it's a blend of mediocre and the greek
[46:07] is a which is the root word
[46:10] crossy meaning rule or government or
[46:12] governing body mediocre comes from the
[46:15] latin mediocrities
[46:17] meaning in a middle state
[46:20] in other words not here nor there
[46:24] yeah lukewarm that's exactly what it is
[46:28] lukewarm and what did what did jesus say
[46:30] in revelations that he would do with
[46:33] lukewarm people
[46:34] he would spit him right out of his mouth
[46:37] and so that is what society young people
[46:40] is trying to form your mind right now to
[46:42] become lukewarm
[46:44] and not stand on anything
[46:47] because when you don't stand on when you
[46:49] have nothing to stand on you fall for
[46:51] everything
[46:52] and you take everything
[46:54] and you receive everything because hey
[46:56] it's their truth
[46:59] and so i have to respect it
[47:01] sure yeah you respect people you respect
[47:04] people's opinion
[47:06] that's what that is your truth is your
[47:08] opinion
[47:09] my truth is my opinion but there is the
[47:11] truth
[47:13] right
[47:14] this is what what stands right
[47:17] praise the lord jesus how many are still
[47:19] with me amen
[47:21] all right
[47:22] so they used celebrities back in 2018
[47:26] this phrase started being used speak
[47:28] your truth and you know who started
[47:29] using it first
[47:31] none other than oprah winfrey
[47:34] and you know that she
[47:36] is the uh the the the culmination of
[47:40] truth
[47:42] whatever she said a lot of people that's
[47:44] that's she's the gospel
[47:46] amen
[47:48] but she started using that and it's
[47:50] become something that uh
[47:52] you just believe whatever you want and
[47:54] it's and it's right
[47:55] i believe whatever i want and it's right
[47:58] but it's totally contrary to why jesus
[48:01] spoke in the bible
[48:03] amen
[48:06] so what this phrase
[48:07] what it does it if
[48:09] it feeds the idea that the world
[48:12] uh is waiting for your opinion
[48:15] speak your truth
[48:18] that the world wants to hear from you
[48:22] hence that's the reason why we get on
[48:24] social media
[48:25] and we air out all of our laundry on
[48:28] social media but when you confront a
[48:30] person head on face to face they won't
[48:32] tell you what they tell you on facebook
[48:35] or what they tell you on text message
[48:36] that's why it's so important amen that
[48:38] we don't totally rely on these on these
[48:41] devices
[48:42] for communication
[48:44] god created us to talk face to face
[48:48] that is leaving
[48:51] but that is not the original way
[48:54] the original way was talking face to
[48:56] face
[48:56] meeting face to face
[48:58] handling things face to face because you
[49:00] know what through text through facebook
[49:02] through these different avenues
[49:04] you write something and somebody else
[49:06] will take it differently than when you
[49:07] wrote it
[49:09] it's not reliable
[49:11] it's not reliable
[49:14] so sometimes it's best to just go to the
[49:16] brother go to the sister and say listen
[49:19] this such and such and such and such and
[49:20] you look him right in the face
[49:24] let's take care of this right now
[49:27] right
[49:28] nyla
[49:30] forgive me
[49:32] all right see i'm looking at her right
[49:34] now i'm seeing her reaction
[49:37] right she's smiling but what if i was
[49:39] telling her that in text message
[49:41] let's take care of this right now she
[49:42] would probably take it oh he's upset
[49:45] but i wasn't i was playing with her
[49:47] right because she laughed
[49:50] but in a text message she might take it
[49:52] a different way
[49:54] that's why it's so important amen that
[49:55] we don't forget amen it's important to
[49:58] talk to people
[50:00] some of us don't even want to talk to
[50:02] anybody amen service is over and we just
[50:03] rush right out
[50:05] amen that won't help you later on in
[50:07] life
[50:09] that won't help you later on in life
[50:11] that's going to be something that's
[50:13] going to hinder you later on in life
[50:15] some of us don't even know how to
[50:16] communicate with people
[50:19] so how do you learn how to communicate
[50:20] with people talk to people
[50:24] you want to be a better communicator you
[50:25] want to learn things from people talk to
[50:27] people
[50:28] ask them questions
[50:30] amen
[50:31] you want to learn how to lose weight
[50:33] talk to the one that's lost weight
[50:37] man you want to learn about
[50:38] changing the tire talk to the one that
[50:40] changes his attire
[50:42] and that works on cars you see what i'm
[50:44] saying
[50:46] you want to learn how to how to get to
[50:48] be a mayor
[50:49] talk to the mayor
[50:53] [Laughter]
[50:56] praise the lord
[51:01] but do you get my point amen
[51:04] praise the lord so social media has
[51:07] become a place to speak out
[51:09] you air out your laundry
[51:11] on there but then when you face them
[51:14] face to face they're cowards
[51:16] they won't say to you in in in your face
[51:19] what they say on tick tock or or
[51:21] facebook or or all these other media
[51:24] outlets they won't
[51:27] so don't depend on those things speak
[51:29] your truth
[51:30] your truth
[51:33] amen
[51:34] and so what what that's doing saints is
[51:36] fulfilling what jesus said that will
[51:38] happen in the last days
[51:40] that the love of many shall wax cold
[51:43] because why
[51:44] you do you and i do me and we just go
[51:47] our separate ways
[51:48] not caring what that brother what that
[51:51] person is going through or or or
[51:53] desiring to even know more about that
[51:56] person
[51:57] you do you i do me
[52:01] and that's fulfilling exactly what jesus
[52:03] said that the love of many in the last
[52:04] days shall wax cold in other words your
[52:07] love for people is going to get colder
[52:09] and colder and colder
[52:11] and that is not the spirit of god
[52:14] second timothy 3 1 tells us this know
[52:17] also that in the last days
[52:19] perilous times shall come how many how
[52:21] many can agree that we're here
[52:23] i mean food supply chains going uh gas
[52:26] prices uh ukraine and all this kind of
[52:29] stuff is
[52:30] amen all these things are happening
[52:34] now verse 2 says for man shall be lovers
[52:36] of their own selves
[52:41] you do you and i do me
[52:45] and these devices they don't help
[52:49] lovers of themselves
[52:51] that's why it's so surprising to me
[52:54] i just i want you to think about this
[52:58] think about this because 40 years ago it
[53:01] wasn't like this 30 years ago it wasn't
[53:03] like that
[53:05] you're writing people don't have
[53:07] anything to talk about anymore
[53:10] because why they say it all on on on on
[53:14] on facebook or on text messages
[53:16] and when they get together
[53:18] you still see them with their phone and
[53:20] they got their friends right next to
[53:21] each other
[53:22] and all of them are on their phone
[53:26] i thought you're supposed to be like
[53:27] talking and fellowshipping with one oh
[53:29] yeah we are as we're using our phones
[53:32] hey
[53:33] did you see this
[53:35] okay
[53:38] we're fellowshipping yeah we're talking
[53:42] but but 30 years ago 20 years ago it
[53:45] wasn't like that
[53:47] it was totally different
[53:49] and people that that taught people how
[53:52] to
[53:52] how to care more for each other
[53:56] to know more about each other see we
[53:58] think that we're connected to these
[53:59] social medias uh and all these different
[54:02] things and that we we just know
[54:04] everything about everybody but not
[54:05] everybody that's in your friend list is
[54:07] really your friend
[54:10] they're just acquaintances or or
[54:12] somebody that you might have met
[54:14] somewhere one day and then they they
[54:15] decided on facebook that that you know
[54:17] they
[54:18] they
[54:19] you know to friend you that doesn't mean
[54:21] they're your friend a friend or somebody
[54:23] that you know personally and that knows
[54:25] you personally
[54:27] amen
[54:28] i consider brother wade my friend
[54:29] because i know him personally consider
[54:31] brother boyd my friend i know him
[54:33] personally
[54:34] praise the lord
[54:36] those are not your friends on social
[54:38] media
[54:40] amen maybe you do you might have a few
[54:42] of them that hey man but
[54:45] do you really fellowship with people
[54:49] all right
[54:52] so
[54:53] it's become today in the same way so you
[54:56] remember we got to get back we got to
[54:58] have an absolute
[55:00] so let's we've established that your
[55:02] truth is not the absolute right
[55:05] my truth is not the absolute
[55:08] i can't stand on my truth you can't
[55:10] stand on your truth but i can stand we
[55:12] both can stand on this truth
[55:15] they're truth of the word of god
[55:17] we can always stand on that right
[55:20] remember you didn't come here to the
[55:21] bible says that you didn't create
[55:23] yourself you didn't come here by your
[55:25] own by your own desire amen he created
[55:29] you amen therefore you owe your life to
[55:32] him
[55:33] praise god
[55:35] amen judge
[55:37] today it's becoming like like it was in
[55:39] the days of the judges
[55:40] man judges 21 25 says in those days
[55:43] there was no king in israel
[55:46] every man did that which was right in
[55:48] his own eyes
[55:51] because there was no absolute
[55:54] there was no standard there was no king
[55:57] there was no lawgiver there was nobody
[56:00] that they could look to and say
[56:02] and say that is who we follow
[56:05] and so everybody did whatever they
[56:07] thought it was right
[56:09] whatever whatever came to their mind
[56:12] my truth and your truth
[56:15] and if i wanted to kill uh
[56:17] such and such a person go right ahead
[56:20] that's your truth
[56:22] and if such as such a person wanted to
[56:24] rape such and such a girl amen go right
[56:27] ahead that's your truth and there was no
[56:29] law
[56:32] almost kind of like becoming like like
[56:33] today
[56:34] lawless
[56:36] lawlessness if we're not careful this is
[56:38] exactly where this nation is going to
[56:41] bunch of communistic lawlessness
[56:47] lawlessness and and so
[56:49] it's so important for you to have a king
[56:53] amen
[56:54] in your life
[56:56] praise god the king of kings
[56:59] the lord of lords
[57:01] amen you want to know something about
[57:03] lying the bible tells you exactly what
[57:05] to talk about lying go to the book of
[57:06] proverbs go to the book of psalms it
[57:08] tells you it tells you plenty about
[57:11] lying amen go to the book of exodus it
[57:14] tells you about lying you want to know
[57:15] about fornication should should i have
[57:18] sexual relationships before i get
[57:19] married the bible tells you exactly
[57:21] where
[57:22] amen it tells you exactly what you need
[57:25] to do
[57:28] that is our king that is our absolute
[57:31] praise god
[57:33] amen
[57:35] but you know the believers of today amen
[57:37] they've taken their own absolute
[57:40] i feel like staying at home and
[57:42] listening to tapes and listening to uh
[57:45] streaming in and and
[57:47] where's that in the world well it's not
[57:48] in the word but
[57:51] it's right in my own eyes
[57:53] it's my truth
[57:56] and it's not based on the word of god
[57:59] everything that you that that you live
[58:02] by you've got to base it
[58:04] you have to have a foundation
[58:06] it's got to be in the message it's got
[58:08] to be in the in the word of god
[58:10] amen so
[58:12] your truth is groundless
[58:14] amen there's no ground for you to stand
[58:16] on with your truth amen your truth will
[58:18] fail but his truth will never fail
[58:20] praise the lord jesus i'm going to go a
[58:22] little quicker here brother brown tells
[58:23] us this and the message absolutely he
[58:25] says he says this i've just seen many
[58:27] religions very devout many times more
[58:30] sincere than the christian people of
[58:31] today profess
[58:33] all right brother branham he traveled
[58:35] all over the world when preaching the
[58:36] gospel when a mother can take her little
[58:39] fat black baby
[58:41] about that long and speaking about you
[58:43] know people in india and and
[58:46] it says here
[58:48] and throw it into the mouth of a
[58:49] crocodile for the love of her god
[58:52] i wonder how sincere christianity is
[58:57] when a man can afflict himself in such a
[58:59] way
[59:00] would put in a thousand hooks through
[59:02] his flesh like that hanging with balls
[59:05] of water
[59:06] you see in other words he he sticks
[59:08] hooks all over his and they're hanging
[59:10] with little weights with a ball of water
[59:12] so it's pulling on the skin all over his
[59:15] body
[59:16] sounds nasty doesn't it esther it looks
[59:19] it's done
[59:20] they do it in in in in hindu religions
[59:23] and things like that
[59:26] he says they put a thousand hooks
[59:29] through his flesh like that a thousand
[59:30] of them
[59:31] would put in a thou uh let's see like
[59:33] that hang him with balls of water
[59:34] holding him down like this and walk
[59:36] through a streak of fire
[59:38] from here to the end of that tabernacle
[59:41] back and forth and it white hot fanned
[59:43] like that for the sacrifice of his god
[59:46] an idol there with ruby eisen and so
[59:48] forth i wonder where christianity is
[59:53] so don't think
[59:55] sincerity sincerity is not it
[59:59] so he he's about to he's about to
[1:00:01] address sincerity sincerity is not his
[1:00:03] sincerity sincerity is all right if it's
[1:00:07] placed on the right thing
[1:00:10] right
[1:00:11] like a doctor giving medicine watch this
[1:00:13] example that he gives
[1:00:16] he he says he might give you arsenic
[1:00:21] sincerely
[1:00:22] arsenic is a poison
[1:00:24] he might give you arsenic sincerely and
[1:00:26] he might give you sulfuric acid
[1:00:29] sincerely
[1:00:31] you might have your prescription filled
[1:00:33] wrong and you might take it in sincere
[1:00:36] insincerity but that don't save your
[1:00:38] life
[1:00:41] see no sir you've got to know what
[1:00:44] you're doing
[1:00:46] or in other words you've got to know
[1:00:48] where you're standing
[1:00:50] and anything contrary to god's word i
[1:00:53] don't care what it is and how long it's
[1:00:55] been in existence it's still wrong
[1:00:58] amen i don't care if president so-and-so
[1:01:01] said i don't care what madam or queen
[1:01:03] such-and-such said amen if it's contrary
[1:01:06] to the word of god it's wrong
[1:01:08] even though they say it in sincerity
[1:01:12] there's many sincere people around the
[1:01:14] world but they can be sincerely wrong
[1:01:18] right it doesn't make them bad people
[1:01:24] but you can be very sincere
[1:01:27] and be very sincerely wrong
[1:01:30] amen so which one which one is more
[1:01:32] important to you
[1:01:34] is sincerity more important to you or is
[1:01:36] truth more important to you
[1:01:39] answer that question let me let me ask
[1:01:41] that again
[1:01:42] is sincerity
[1:01:45] is somebody being sincere to you
[1:01:47] sincere more important to you or is the
[1:01:51] truth or is truth that comes out of
[1:01:53] their mouth is that more important to
[1:01:55] you
[1:01:57] right amen
[1:02:00] i'd rather have truth
[1:02:02] amen because you can say something with
[1:02:04] a passion and really feel sincere about
[1:02:07] it but you're wrong
[1:02:09] because it's not based on truth
[1:02:12] right
[1:02:13] right
[1:02:14] so let's define sincerity real quick
[1:02:16] sincerity is the quality of being free
[1:02:19] from pretense deceit or hypocrisy
[1:02:23] and so now let's look at that truth
[1:02:25] truth is the property of being in accord
[1:02:28] with fact or reality
[1:02:31] yeah
[1:02:32] so sincerity is good
[1:02:36] i'm not saying it's bad it's really good
[1:02:38] we all got to be sincere
[1:02:40] but we all have to have our sincerity
[1:02:42] based on facts
[1:02:43] based on truth
[1:02:45] praise god
[1:02:49] so is it possible for someone to be
[1:02:51] sincere and still be untruthful
[1:02:54] yeah somebody come you you somebody
[1:02:57] comes to you
[1:02:59] and tells you well hey i heard such and
[1:03:01] such as
[1:03:04] or tells you this that or the other this
[1:03:06] oh really well where'd you hear that
[1:03:08] from well i heard it from such and such
[1:03:10] as oh
[1:03:11] so you continue digging for that truth
[1:03:13] amen where did they hear it from
[1:03:17] get to the bottom of the of it amen
[1:03:19] because it can be said with sincerity
[1:03:22] but it can be no truth behind it
[1:03:25] and then we've got to base everything we
[1:03:28] say we got to base everything we believe
[1:03:30] on truth praise the lord
[1:03:33] amen
[1:03:34] praise god
[1:03:37] so
[1:03:39] it's like it's like a
[1:03:41] thinking about this example it's like a
[1:03:43] little kid that gets in trouble
[1:03:46] how many that have had children
[1:03:48] and and they do something that they're
[1:03:50] not supposed to do and and and you catch
[1:03:53] them in the act
[1:03:54] and you say well that's it you know
[1:03:56] you're
[1:03:57] you know i'm gonna have to take your
[1:03:59] toys away or i'm gonna have to do
[1:04:00] something you you you start delivering
[1:04:02] the punishment
[1:04:04] and then that you can see them in their
[1:04:05] faces i promise i won't do it again
[1:04:10] i won't do it again
[1:04:12] they're sincere
[1:04:14] but you don't know if they're really
[1:04:15] mean it in their heart
[1:04:17] they're being sincere i mean i believe
[1:04:19] that they really don't want to do it
[1:04:21] again but do they really mean it in
[1:04:23] their heart
[1:04:25] because the next day you see him doing
[1:04:27] the same thing again you knew that that
[1:04:30] sincerity was not based upon fact or
[1:04:33] upon truth
[1:04:35] oh well do it again mommy i promise i
[1:04:38] won't do it again just just don't don't
[1:04:41] don't spank me
[1:04:45] i've done it
[1:04:47] i did it with my parents many times
[1:04:51] i still got it
[1:04:55] you know what i'm thankful
[1:04:58] thankful that i did
[1:05:02] like brother branham said it made me who
[1:05:03] i am today
[1:05:06] amen i'm thankful that that my mom and
[1:05:08] dad didn't cut corners with me or
[1:05:10] or or or just
[1:05:12] very loose with me amen
[1:05:14] it made me who i am today
[1:05:17] amen
[1:05:18] and those of you who who planned on
[1:05:20] having children later on in life amen
[1:05:22] amen don't think because society is
[1:05:25] changing that you have to change the way
[1:05:27] god said for you to raise children amen
[1:05:30] god said amen apply the rod when it
[1:05:32] needs to be applied
[1:05:34] that's what he said i didn't say that's
[1:05:37] truth
[1:05:38] that's fact
[1:05:39] that is what i will stand on but society
[1:05:42] says no you're damaging that child
[1:05:43] you're doing the
[1:05:45] the word of god is my absolute
[1:05:48] the word of god now there is a right way
[1:05:50] to do it
[1:05:52] don't do it out of anger
[1:05:53] you will damage that child yes for sure
[1:05:57] amen but if you talk to them and say
[1:05:58] listen do you know why you did this and
[1:06:00] then the other you give them the reason
[1:06:02] why you're applying the punishment
[1:06:05] and if and give them bible-based reasons
[1:06:10] because when you always give them the
[1:06:11] bible race reasons they'll they'll know
[1:06:13] as they're growing up
[1:06:14] amen it's got to be based on the word of
[1:06:17] god amen but if it's your opinion that
[1:06:19] you're giving them amen then that that
[1:06:21] won't stand praise the lord all right
[1:06:24] so the word true
[1:06:26] watch because there's very many true
[1:06:28] things
[1:06:30] but there is the truth amen the word
[1:06:33] true is an adjective
[1:06:35] and adjectives describe a person place
[1:06:38] or thing
[1:06:39] right
[1:06:40] that's what the word true because you
[1:06:41] could say for example uh
[1:06:44] uh i don't know that's the true
[1:06:46] that's a true uh
[1:06:49] i don't know that's a true thing on that
[1:06:50] car
[1:06:51] you know
[1:06:54] you're just describing something about
[1:06:55] that car
[1:06:57] right but the word truth is a noun
[1:07:01] amen and a noun is a per it's a person a
[1:07:04] place or a thing
[1:07:06] it's the person it's d place or it's d
[1:07:09] thing
[1:07:10] man so that's the difference between
[1:07:11] true and truth
[1:07:13] because sometimes people use it
[1:07:15] interchangeably
[1:07:16] but it really means two different things
[1:07:19] amen praise god
[1:07:21] so
[1:07:23] let's make sure we're standing on
[1:07:24] something saints
[1:07:26] let's make sure we're standing on tr and
[1:07:28] on truth
[1:07:30] and truth and who is the truth
[1:07:34] our lord jesus christ
[1:07:37] i know this may may sound like a broken
[1:07:40] record to to many of us
[1:07:43] but i want to tell you
[1:07:44] adults have patience
[1:07:47] because our young people they're
[1:07:49] fighting spirits that you didn't fight
[1:07:51] 10 15 20 years ago
[1:07:55] and so if somebody can say something
[1:07:57] about these things to kind of guide them
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:00] be patient
[1:08:02] be patient oh he's not preaching daniel
[1:08:04] 70 weeks he's not preaching statue of a
[1:08:05] perfect man amen this all blends in
[1:08:09] this all has to do with it
[1:08:12] this all has to do with it and if we
[1:08:14] don't address it
[1:08:15] hey man who will
[1:08:18] the tick tock they're getting all their
[1:08:20] info from the tick tock influencer from
[1:08:22] the youtube influencer man it's time
[1:08:24] that somebody stand and man and give
[1:08:26] them something that will give them amen
[1:08:28] hope
[1:08:29] there is hope in christ young people
[1:08:32] there's no hope in the world there's no
[1:08:33] hope in
[1:08:34] in in in smoking there's no hope in
[1:08:36] vaping there's no hope in premarital sex
[1:08:39] not all that all that joy of all those
[1:08:42] things go away
[1:08:43] but you experience christ one time for
[1:08:46] real
[1:08:46] amen that will always stay that
[1:08:49] experience will never go away
[1:08:52] but you've got to have it for yourself
[1:08:55] for real
[1:08:56] not just one time but but but a reality
[1:09:00] and and the reality could be that you
[1:09:03] didn't jump or shout or scream you don't
[1:09:05] need to
[1:09:06] when that word has anchored down in your
[1:09:08] heart and everything that you do and
[1:09:10] everywhere you go that word never leaves
[1:09:13] you amen something has happened in your
[1:09:15] life
[1:09:17] and that it's changing you from the
[1:09:18] inside out that you're no longer the
[1:09:20] person that you are you no longer dress
[1:09:22] the way you used to dress you're no
[1:09:24] longer talking the way you used to talk
[1:09:26] amen it's changing you from the inside
[1:09:28] out then that means an anchor you you
[1:09:31] stand up you've stood you've got an
[1:09:33] absolute in your life
[1:09:35] amen it's like it's like peter
[1:09:38] peter now uh we'll we'll finish up with
[1:09:40] this peter amen when he walked out of
[1:09:42] that boat
[1:09:43] i mean the what the storms and the storm
[1:09:46] and the waves everything was gone was
[1:09:48] going crazy and they were on the boat
[1:09:49] they didn't have anything that they were
[1:09:51] that they were anchored on
[1:09:54] and all the disciples they were all
[1:09:56] scared
[1:09:57] they were they didn't know where to go
[1:09:58] it was dark the bible says that it was
[1:10:00] in the third i believe it was the third
[1:10:02] or sixth hour of the night
[1:10:04] it was darkness
[1:10:07] and in the middle of this darkness
[1:10:08] appears this ghost
[1:10:11] can you imagine that
[1:10:13] imagine it's thundering and lightning
[1:10:15] outside and then all of a sudden in your
[1:10:16] room you see this ghost
[1:10:21] but really it was actually the lord
[1:10:23] jesus christ
[1:10:24] and they see it from far off
[1:10:26] and they think it's a ghost
[1:10:29] amen
[1:10:31] brother branham says that the thing that
[1:10:33] could help them they got scared of
[1:10:35] amen
[1:10:36] and they started screaming and said oh
[1:10:38] it's a ghost and so they were they were
[1:10:40] paying more attention now to the to the
[1:10:42] ghost than they were to the storm
[1:10:44] they were very the bi
[1:10:46] i was looking into that and they were
[1:10:48] very superstitious people
[1:10:50] the jews the jews are
[1:10:53] so they take those things seriously
[1:10:57] but here comes jesus walking on the
[1:10:59] water
[1:11:01] doing something that they had never seen
[1:11:03] anybody else
[1:11:05] do before defying nature defying
[1:11:10] his own word
[1:11:12] his own creation
[1:11:14] he's over his own creation
[1:11:17] amen he's over amen
[1:11:19] you
[1:11:20] if you're you're if you're his creation
[1:11:23] and he's walking on the water and then
[1:11:25] peter gets this bright idea
[1:11:29] and says lord after jesus tells him
[1:11:32] do not be afraid it is i
[1:11:34] he makes sure that he
[1:11:36] he vindicates who he is
[1:11:38] i am that absolute
[1:11:40] don't be afraid it's i
[1:11:42] don't be afraid young people to stand on
[1:11:44] that word it's just the lord jesus
[1:11:46] christ
[1:11:47] do you love the lord jesus christ then
[1:11:49] don't be afraid to take him by his word
[1:11:52] it's just the lord and he wants the best
[1:11:55] for you
[1:11:56] and so peter says well lord if it's you
[1:11:59] bid me to go
[1:12:01] and
[1:12:02] lord jesus just tells him come
[1:12:06] doesn't explain the seven seals to them
[1:12:08] doesn't doesn't say something real deep
[1:12:11] and it doesn't it just doesn't come
[1:12:14] yeah
[1:12:15] it's like what brother wade's been
[1:12:16] saying amen don't worry about those
[1:12:18] things eventually you need to learn
[1:12:20] about those things because they're in
[1:12:21] the word but right now if you're trying
[1:12:23] to find christ amen find christ
[1:12:26] don't worry about the statue of perfect
[1:12:28] man those things you need amen but amen
[1:12:31] get to christ
[1:12:33] that's what peter needed to do amen get
[1:12:35] to christ and now he just he had the
[1:12:37] word come and and peter with that that
[1:12:39] was enough for him he gets off the boat
[1:12:41] amen and starts walking and starts
[1:12:43] walking and he had nothing to hold on to
[1:12:46] amen he himself defying
[1:12:49] nature
[1:12:51] remember peter didn't even have the holy
[1:12:52] ghost
[1:12:55] doing something
[1:12:59] just because he saw the lord jesus do it
[1:13:01] just because he saw his absolute do it
[1:13:04] he made jesus his absolute at that
[1:13:08] moment
[1:13:08] and nothing was going to stop him then
[1:13:10] you think his friends the other
[1:13:12] disciples where are you going peter man
[1:13:14] you crazy man what
[1:13:16] man what's and you're going to die out
[1:13:18] there no my absolute said so i'm going
[1:13:22] i'm going i don't care
[1:13:24] it takes a step of faith
[1:13:26] young people it takes a a faith it takes
[1:13:29] a step of faith for you to stand on that
[1:13:31] absolute
[1:13:35] and he kept going and he kept going
[1:13:37] until finally he got to his absolute
[1:13:41] i mean but sometimes when we get to our
[1:13:43] absolutely we might have an experience
[1:13:44] with god
[1:13:46] and we let the elements of the world the
[1:13:48] world again around us
[1:13:51] brother someone so offended me sister
[1:13:53] so-and-so offended me
[1:13:55] brother so-and-so from the pulpit said
[1:13:57] this that or the other i'm offended
[1:14:00] and we start sinking
[1:14:02] like peter
[1:14:04] lord
[1:14:05] why because you stopped looking at your
[1:14:07] absolute you looked at the offense and
[1:14:10] you looked at what sister so-and-so said
[1:14:12] to you instead of looking at the word of
[1:14:13] god amen
[1:14:16] amen
[1:14:18] amen
[1:14:19] it's the word of god that matters not
[1:14:20] what brother someone so said
[1:14:23] i pray for brother so-and-so
[1:14:25] go talk to brother so-and-so what did
[1:14:28] you mean brother about that
[1:14:30] what sister what did you mean by this
[1:14:32] amen but you you look at the word first
[1:14:35] remember what i was saying sunday amen
[1:14:37] we need to learn how to not react
[1:14:40] when something is said to us but think
[1:14:43] before we say
[1:14:45] amen because we could cause more damage
[1:14:47] than we could to good
[1:14:48] peter amen he had to
[1:14:50] grab onto he had to hold on to that
[1:14:53] absolute in order to
[1:14:55] walk on water just like just like jesus
[1:14:57] was
[1:14:59] but eventually amen there's the grace of
[1:15:00] god
[1:15:01] it doesn't matter you might you may have
[1:15:03] failed god it does and you may have
[1:15:05] disbelieved his word you may have
[1:15:07] backslid but there's the grace of god
[1:15:10] still right there
[1:15:11] the grace of jesus christ was right
[1:15:13] there peter and just picked them right
[1:15:15] back up
[1:15:17] and he said peter oh you have little
[1:15:19] faith
[1:15:20] pick them right up
[1:15:22] now i love this part because
[1:15:25] jesus didn't carry him back to the boat
[1:15:29] you notice the bible doesn't say that
[1:15:31] he didn't carry peter back to the boat
[1:15:34] no he walked with peter back to the boat
[1:15:36] again
[1:15:37] peters continued walking on the water
[1:15:40] he was able to get back up to continue
[1:15:42] walking on the water
[1:15:45] so
[1:15:45] jesus when he restores he restores fully
[1:15:48] and he restores you back to your to your
[1:15:51] original point
[1:15:52] wherever you left jesus that's where
[1:15:54] he'll put you back
[1:15:56] amen
[1:15:57] and him both of them walk back to the
[1:16:00] boat walk to the boat
[1:16:02] jesus didn't carry him back to the boat
[1:16:05] he walked with jesus back to the boat
[1:16:10] amen
[1:16:11] because he grabbed on to that absolute
[1:16:13] praise the lord
[1:16:14] stay with an absolute have an absolute
[1:16:16] young people
[1:16:18] amen stay on something that that that's
[1:16:20] something that's firm
[1:16:22] amen the man who found the pearl of
[1:16:24] great price
[1:16:25] the bible says that he that became his
[1:16:27] absolute matthew 13 44 says again the
[1:16:30] kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure
[1:16:32] hid in a field that which when a man
[1:16:34] hath found he hideth and for joy thereof
[1:16:38] goeth and selleth all that he has
[1:16:41] and buys that field
[1:16:43] he buys that field because he found the
[1:16:46] the pearl of great price
[1:16:48] a treasure that was hit in that field he
[1:16:50] he sold everything in order to obtain
[1:16:53] that was his absolute
[1:16:55] he sold out to that absolute
[1:16:58] in verse 45 jesus says again the kingdom
[1:17:00] of heaven is like unto a merchant man
[1:17:02] seeking goodly pearls
[1:17:04] who when he fed found one pearl of great
[1:17:07] price
[1:17:08] went and sold all that he had and bought
[1:17:11] it
[1:17:13] he forgot all the other pearls around
[1:17:15] him that he had he probably had
[1:17:16] thousands of them he got rid of them he
[1:17:18] sold him because he knew this one was
[1:17:20] worth the most
[1:17:24] amen
[1:17:25] that was his absolute
[1:17:29] and he stuck to he stuck to his guns
[1:17:32] so they say
[1:17:34] praise god
[1:17:35] and second thessalonians two ver one and
[1:17:37] two says now we beseech you brethren by
[1:17:39] the coming of our lord jesus christ and
[1:17:40] by our gathering together unto him that
[1:17:42] ye be not so soon shaken in mind
[1:17:46] amen in other words amen be have an
[1:17:49] absolute don't be shaken so easily
[1:17:52] yeah or be troubled in ephesians 4 14 we
[1:17:55] read this this past sunday that we
[1:17:57] henceforth be no more children
[1:17:59] tossed to and fro
[1:18:01] back and forth
[1:18:03] yeah
[1:18:05] and carried about with every wind of
[1:18:09] tick-tock videos you could put put right
[1:18:12] over anything there
[1:18:13] carry about whatever you see on youtube
[1:18:16] carry it about whatever facebook post
[1:18:18] you see
[1:18:19] well brother so-and-so posted such and
[1:18:21] say it must be true
[1:18:26] things that brother so-and-so posted
[1:18:28] when you go back and look at him and
[1:18:30] it's not true and then it might not be
[1:18:32] him it might it might not be his fault
[1:18:34] he just shares re-shares whatever he
[1:18:36] sees on his feet
[1:18:41] amen
[1:18:42] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:18:44] every wind of doctrine by the slight of
[1:18:46] man and cunning craftiness whereby they
[1:18:48] lie in wait to deceive
[1:18:52] so a lot of things that you see on
[1:18:54] online it's kind of like how many
[1:18:56] receiving text messages from people that
[1:18:57] you don't even know
[1:19:00] it's been happening more and more the
[1:19:02] last year
