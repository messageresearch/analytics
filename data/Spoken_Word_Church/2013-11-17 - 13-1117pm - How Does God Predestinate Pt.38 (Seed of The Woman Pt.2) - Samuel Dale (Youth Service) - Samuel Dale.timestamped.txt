[40:28] you know this is this is something to
[40:30] just enjoy
[40:31] fellowshipping
[40:33] and don't worry about saying well i
[40:34] don't agree with you that don't bother
[40:36] me
[40:38] you know that doesn't bother me for you
[40:39] to look me in the face and say i don't
[40:40] agree with you
[40:42] you know because every day i didn't
[40:43] agree with myself either you know
[40:45] but you know just have a good time
[40:47] talking about the lord and
[40:50] and the things of what you see and
[40:52] fellowshipping
[40:53] because that's what it's all about we're
[40:54] going to have an eternity to do that
[40:56] with us together so why not enjoy here
[40:58] right
[40:59] okay romans
[41:01] 8
[41:03] and we know that all things work
[41:04] together for good to them that
[41:06] love god to them who are the called
[41:08] according to his purpose
[41:10] for whom he did for no
[41:12] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[41:15] to the image of his son that he might be
[41:18] the firstborn among many brethren now
[41:20] remember that when we get on over into
[41:23] the begotten you know
[41:25] he's the firstborn
[41:27] all right we'll understand that one of
[41:29] these days
[41:30] more of whom he did predestinate them he
[41:33] also called and whom he called
[41:35] then he also justified in whom he
[41:37] justified them he also glorified
[41:39] what shall we then say to these things
[41:42] if god be for us
[41:44] who can be against us that's something
[41:46] isn't it
[41:49] okay we'll just read one scripture pick
[41:51] up our thought this afternoon
[41:53] and it'll be taken from
[41:55] genesis 4
[41:57] and 15.
[42:00] and i will put enmity between
[42:02] thee and the woman
[42:04] and between thy seed and her seed
[42:08] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[42:10] shalt bruise his heel you may be seated
[42:13] the lord had his blessing to the reading
[42:14] of the word
[42:16] now we have we're trying to cover
[42:20] to the point
[42:21] and uh
[42:23] you know
[42:26] getting an understanding
[42:28] of the scriptures and the things of why
[42:30] that it would
[42:31] be a certain way see we
[42:33] we we kind of
[42:37] i say we we all do we kind of
[42:39] we get set in our ways
[42:42] southern says sought
[42:44] you know we get shot in their ways and
[42:46] and somebody crosses us it uh
[42:49] it kind of jiggles a little but that's
[42:51] good right you know and i don't mean
[42:53] that about
[42:54] uh discussing the message you're talking
[42:56] about i mean in the basis of
[42:58] of what i try to do sometimes preaching
[43:01] to you
[43:02] i try to bring out things that will make
[43:04] you
[43:05] interested enough to think
[43:10] interested enough to study
[43:13] interested enough to pray
[43:16] and to seek god
[43:18] and even if it's wrong
[43:21] the bible is always right
[43:23] he said there must need to be heresies
[43:25] among you that they that are proven may
[43:26] be made manifest well
[43:30] even if i preach wrong
[43:32] and you get what's right
[43:35] look at a great thing out of it all you
[43:37] know but we you know we try to do the
[43:39] best we can
[43:40] all right but i asked you this morning i
[43:42] kept asking a question
[43:44] and i'll keep asking it for a few
[43:46] services
[43:47] why does it say
[43:50] between thy seed speaking of the serpent
[43:53] you know and
[43:55] her seed
[43:56] speaking of the woman
[43:58] when the serpent
[44:00] the devil
[44:02] the serpent see it's not the beast that
[44:04] way it's the serpent
[44:06] that's being dealt with he doesn't have
[44:08] a literal seed
[44:12] his seed is unbelief
[44:14] and that's not a seed
[44:16] all right
[44:18] the only way it can become one even than
[44:20] anything is for us to receive it
[44:22] and and become a part of us all right
[44:25] but he doesn't have a seed see he's a
[44:28] spirit being we read this morning
[44:30] and doesn't have a seed all right the
[44:32] woman doesn't have a seed
[44:35] she has an egg
[44:38] but why does it speak of that and why is
[44:41] so much time spent by the prophet
[44:43] covering the seed of the woman
[44:46] right
[44:47] in answering to it when he states that
[44:50] this
[44:51] genesis 15
[44:53] he said all bible scholars
[44:55] know
[44:57] that that's the
[44:58] first time that it's speaking of the
[45:01] coming of the christ
[45:03] the messiah
[45:05] the promised to be
[45:07] and that's why i was bringing it like i
[45:08] did for you to think about it
[45:10] that god didn't just
[45:14] leave us alone and throw us away when we
[45:16] sinned
[45:17] he was right there and he made an
[45:19] atonement through the animals
[45:22] took the skins made an atonement but
[45:24] that atonement was only a covering
[45:27] of the sin
[45:29] it could not eradicate it
[45:31] but it was speaking of a coming messiah
[45:34] right but not a direct we call it
[45:36] prophecy
[45:38] but when you come over to genesis 2 and
[45:40] or
[45:42] 3 and 15
[45:44] then it's a direct prophecy
[45:48] nailing it down that i'm going to do
[45:50] something now watch that at the end of
[45:52] the message
[45:54] because he says i'm going to do it
[45:59] he's not saying you're going to do it
[46:03] he said i'm going to do it
[46:05] i will
[46:06] sinned
[46:09] all right
[46:11] now
[46:12] in that doing then
[46:15] and satan not having a seed
[46:19] and eve not having a seed
[46:22] and in knowing that mary
[46:26] never produced an egg
[46:31] you know that would have been mankind
[46:33] bringing forth and it would not have
[46:35] been the seed of the woman
[46:39] because now if you'll get the point
[46:40] you'll see what i'm driving at the seat
[46:42] of the woman then would be the promise
[46:44] of god
[46:47] that's a promise amen all right we can
[46:50] lay our life on that
[46:52] i mean
[46:53] all right
[46:55] but it's saying that
[46:57] i'm going to sin this seed of the woman
[47:02] and it could not be that
[47:03] mary would bring the egg
[47:06] so that would be mankind doing it
[47:09] so it wouldn't be him saying it
[47:11] see you'd have to change genesis 3 15.
[47:15] you have to say you'd have to put it
[47:17] like this i i i will
[47:21] come down and i'll use that woman one of
[47:23] these days and because she was one that
[47:25] went wrong and i'll come down and i'll
[47:28] use her
[47:30] who said she's got to have something to
[47:32] do with it
[47:33] and she's going to produce the egg
[47:36] so you'd have to rewrite the bible right
[47:39] it doesn't say that it says i will
[47:42] but enmity so whatever is done it's the
[47:45] promise of god to you and i
[47:49] to bring forth
[47:51] he would do it
[47:53] well right now as i'm saying this
[47:54] morning then surely by what we know of
[47:57] foreknowledge
[47:59] that god knew we would fall
[48:03] and he knew what he'd do
[48:05] now if we get back to it over a few more
[48:08] messages
[48:09] i want to go through that old testament
[48:11] and just try to bring christ
[48:14] and see that and the right of the the
[48:17] christ to the old testament
[48:19] and then the ride of the
[48:22] the you know
[48:24] the seed of the serpent
[48:26] and remember when you're talking about
[48:27] the seed of the serpent
[48:30] then you you've got a
[48:32] uh
[48:33] you've got to get an understanding that
[48:35] some way it's got to be brought to a
[48:36] seed
[48:39] because
[48:40] the the seed of the woman
[48:42] right that was the last thing we read
[48:44] this morning
[48:45] see the seed of the woman was the the
[48:47] coming forth of jesus christ
[48:50] without the help of mankind
[48:54] you know all right
[48:55] but then we would discover the seed of
[48:57] the beast
[48:58] or serpent
[49:00] would be the coming forth
[49:03] by
[49:05] some form of
[49:08] human
[49:09] doings
[49:11] and wouldn't that be we then tie back to
[49:13] where that
[49:14] cain started it but he said
[49:16] now lord i've done this
[49:19] you know
[49:20] now you can take it or leave it
[49:23] and that's what the religious world is
[49:24] doing
[49:26] he's saying take it leave it
[49:28] no i forgot to welcome our little
[49:30] visitor this morning sister johnny's
[49:32] grand
[49:33] son is here
[49:34] and we forgot to say to him welcome this
[49:36] morning
[49:37] okay good to see you
[49:40] we always say welcome to you so
[49:42] you know that'd have him but we just
[49:45] blowed that in this morning and
[49:47] he got off
[49:48] all right
[49:50] but now
[49:54] and we're saying i watch
[49:56] the literal way we ended up on page 102
[49:59] of the these in church age
[50:03] by saying that this would show the way
[50:06] the seed of the serpent would come into
[50:07] being
[50:08] but brother branham used the coming
[50:10] forth of the
[50:12] seed of the woman
[50:14] and he brought it forth in jesus christ
[50:16] you know mary
[50:18] and and
[50:19] the virgin birth
[50:21] all right
[50:22] so we're not looking for a virgin birth
[50:23] in the
[50:24] serpent seed we're looking for the wrong
[50:27] birth
[50:28] you know the messed up things all right
[50:30] and
[50:31] we know that's what we've all done
[50:34] and uh you know i know a lot of people
[50:36] don't want to believe that
[50:38] they're the seed of the serpent but
[50:41] now i'm just honest
[50:43] now
[50:44] whether you believe it or not that's up
[50:45] to you
[50:46] but
[50:48] i believe it's so intermingled
[50:51] you know
[50:53] and i can bring it down with brother
[50:54] branham i'll be glad to do it he brings
[50:56] it down one time and brings it straight
[50:58] to judas
[51:02] as to bring in judas
[51:04] coming down as the
[51:06] seed of the serpent i've got them laying
[51:08] on my desk because see i always run off
[51:09] everything try to study it
[51:12] and you you say well well you know i
[51:14] don't understand that i don't either
[51:16] because
[51:17] judas came from the same tribe jesus
[51:19] came from did you know that
[51:22] have you studied your bible
[51:24] judas came from the same tribe the tribe
[51:26] of judah
[51:29] so then you can't go physically see it
[51:31] gets all messed up
[51:32] and then to wind up with the lord jesus
[51:34] giving us a parable
[51:37] i mentioned this morning
[51:40] he's talking about the sore going forth
[51:42] or so and he said that was the children
[51:43] of the kingdom
[51:45] he said but the wicked one
[51:48] went forth to sow his seed so what do we
[51:50] got
[51:52] two seeds
[51:53] right
[51:55] god see the devil's seed
[51:59] then wouldn't it be as they're saying
[52:01] about the mark of the beast
[52:03] we all have the prophet said to mark of
[52:05] the beast unless we're born again
[52:07] well wouldn't it be that we were all
[52:09] as the prophet would say born between
[52:14] satan
[52:15] and ever
[52:18] now that's not degrading of anything
[52:20] that's just telling it like it is
[52:23] it's just being straight and honest to
[52:25] what we are
[52:26] we're all as the psalmist david said
[52:28] born in sin shave it in the nick would
[52:30] spouse my mother's womb went forth a
[52:31] liar we all need the new birth right
[52:35] we all need to be born again we need to
[52:37] get that straight
[52:39] it's not how good we are or what we do
[52:41] or how we go to church or what we do or
[52:44] give or anything it's all whether or not
[52:46] we're born again all right
[52:48] and see then
[52:50] that two seeds would come down why would
[52:53] jesus look at those pharisees
[52:56] that was raised in church
[52:58] not a marker against him and what'd he
[53:00] say
[53:02] he said you are of your father
[53:05] the devil
[53:10] now we ain't got to understand
[53:12] that you look at cain and say cain we
[53:14] love that wicked one that's right right
[53:17] that's kind of all right but look at
[53:19] religious people
[53:21] totally religious one mark against them
[53:24] they'd be killed
[53:26] and he said you're of your father the
[53:27] devil well now brother daley wasn't
[53:29] talking to them people he's talking to
[53:31] one in there that's okay
[53:35] how'd he get in there
[53:37] you know
[53:38] so that means we're all
[53:41] a.l.l all
[53:43] lost and need a savior
[53:46] all right
[53:47] now
[53:49] adam
[53:50] needed a savior
[53:53] just like eve
[53:55] come on
[53:57] he didn't just make coats for eve and
[53:59] send adam out naked
[54:01] okay
[54:02] he made coats for him too
[54:06] when it comes to the offering of the
[54:07] sacrifice abel was offering a sacrifice
[54:10] as well as cain was offering a sacrifice
[54:12] so abel was lost as well as cain
[54:16] but see why would people get into their
[54:18] mind to think that if we were born to
[54:20] some holy lineage we could be saved
[54:26] why would we consider even stuff like
[54:28] that
[54:30] i told you i wouldn't care if i knew
[54:31] that i was a direct descendant
[54:34] from the beast
[54:36] i'd glory in jesus christ because it
[54:38] don't have nothing to do with
[54:39] anything other than the new birth
[54:43] now
[54:45] but see the literal way
[54:47] that god was to come into
[54:50] the human race
[54:52] was by creation
[54:57] but satan couldn't do that
[54:59] so he used the
[55:01] the beast
[55:03] to achieve
[55:05] what he was trying to do
[55:09] and through an unlawful act we were
[55:11] reading out of oneness there
[55:15] eve brought forth
[55:18] all
[55:18] right
[55:20] but see
[55:21] he promised her
[55:27] a savior
[55:30] now
[55:31] get what i'm getting at see
[55:34] people wanted to say now you got to say
[55:36] this distracted and probably says you
[55:38] gotta say it well okay amen i'm trying
[55:40] to
[55:41] but i want you to say something
[55:47] all of us men got left out
[55:50] because only the women can be saved
[55:52] you believe i can prove that in the
[55:53] bible
[55:56] because it's her seed
[55:59] so we don't have one
[56:03] come on
[56:06] you see what i'm trying to say
[56:09] see we want to say this for example
[56:11] we'll say let's say
[56:15] brother branham said one day he said
[56:18] luther denominated
[56:20] and died and went to hell
[56:24] heart denominated and died let me
[56:25] correct that don't mate
[56:27] what the hell
[56:29] this brother said see i say what the
[56:30] prophet said i said you say it
[56:33] he said what do you mean i said well
[56:35] then if he denominated and died
[56:37] he missed it
[56:39] he caught what he's saying
[56:41] i said come on now you say it
[56:44] you just quote brother branham
[56:46] he wouldn't do it
[56:48] because he was caught
[56:50] and that's what we're doing
[56:52] we want to take the bible and the things
[56:54] and just what we want to say
[56:57] you know
[56:58] but i believe in putting it all together
[57:01] and it comes out to make a beautiful
[57:02] picture
[57:04] but what is the seed of the woman now
[57:10] you know the seed of the woman was
[57:11] called something else one time in the
[57:13] bible
[57:18] now i'm saying seed of the woman
[57:23] we know who the seed of the woman is
[57:24] it's christ right
[57:26] but you know
[57:28] it was called mary's seed
[57:37] that which is born of thee
[57:40] merry seat
[57:45] all right
[57:50] see we have to tie a lot of things
[57:51] together
[57:53] and where i want to start at brother
[57:54] brown said
[57:55] and given the scripture said
[57:58] when it comes over to genesis
[58:01] where
[58:02] eve said
[58:06] i've been appointed
[58:08] the seed
[58:11] appointed a seed it says in about the
[58:14] fifth or sixth chapter there
[58:16] i've had it somewhere in the notes but
[58:19] it said
[58:20] to rip in other words in place of say uh
[58:23] abel said whom
[58:27] came slew
[58:29] appointed why did it say appointed
[58:36] see
[58:37] the bible's right
[58:39] we just misinterpret
[58:42] the point of what it's talking about
[58:44] what did why did eve say appointed
[58:49] why didn't you what did she say he gave
[58:50] me a seed
[58:53] because when that what happened i mean
[58:55] didn't he give a seed in the place of of
[58:58] abel it was flu but eve didn't say that
[59:01] what she said he hath appointed me a
[59:03] seed because she just said he had given
[59:06] me a seed that would have been christ
[59:10] come on
[59:14] and she never
[59:16] according to brother branham
[59:18] eve never
[59:22] claimed that
[59:23] cain was her son
[59:29] she claimed abel
[59:31] she claimed seth
[59:34] she never claimed
[59:36] cain has to be in her son
[59:39] all right
[59:41] now
[59:42] he has appointed me a seed
[59:48] now we were reading this morning it
[59:50] doesn't say then he has pointed me an
[59:52] egg
[59:54] that wouldn't work
[59:57] but he has appointed me a seed
[1:00:01] didn't say he's given me seed that would
[1:00:03] have been christ
[1:00:06] and that definitely didn't happen back
[1:00:08] there
[1:00:09] she was appointed a seed
[1:00:12] in the facts of seth carrying on the
[1:00:14] human race
[1:00:17] because at that time the human race had
[1:00:18] stopped on the basis of that now adam
[1:00:21] and eve were having children so
[1:00:23] but there's no record but there was
[1:00:26] children born to them but the point i'm
[1:00:29] getting at
[1:00:32] she had to say it correctly she has he
[1:00:34] has appointed me a seed
[1:00:40] he has given me seth to replace abel
[1:00:45] all right
[1:00:46] seth was not to promise seed no more
[1:00:48] than isaac was the promised seed
[1:00:51] he was a promised natural
[1:00:54] seth was the promised natural to carry
[1:00:55] on to human rights
[1:00:58] all right
[1:01:02] but then
[1:01:06] if you can see it then you can see why
[1:01:10] she didn't say he'd give me more seed
[1:01:12] because that wouldn't work
[1:01:15] you know
[1:01:19] see she said he had to point it
[1:01:23] that means in place of
[1:01:27] to carry on the human race
[1:01:29] but it was not the christ
[1:01:32] that was brought forth there the christ
[1:01:34] was the promise to come
[1:01:37] that would be then called the seat of
[1:01:39] the woman
[1:01:41] now you mind we don't have much company
[1:01:43] today you might just preach a little bit
[1:01:44] without quoting so much
[1:01:46] you know reading so much we'll just try
[1:01:47] to do that a little
[1:01:49] see because when you come over to eve
[1:01:52] i mean mary
[1:01:56] for her to bring forth
[1:02:01] she had to have something to do with it
[1:02:03] on this basis she said be it unto me
[1:02:05] according to thy word
[1:02:09] but it's already a promise now that a
[1:02:11] virgin shall conceive
[1:02:15] so now you're following me what i've
[1:02:16] been on predestination and for knowledge
[1:02:19] and etc
[1:02:21] he knew mary would say that word
[1:02:25] right
[1:02:26] he knew she'd say it rightly
[1:02:29] but she had to say it
[1:02:32] he knew you would be a christian
[1:02:34] but you had to accept it
[1:02:36] right right
[1:02:38] so you can't overwrite a free moral
[1:02:39] agency
[1:02:41] amen
[1:02:43] see then when it would be brought forth
[1:02:47] mary would say be it unto me according
[1:02:49] to thy word
[1:02:54] she wouldn't say now
[1:02:56] because she didn't understand to say it
[1:02:58] she didn't say uh
[1:03:03] let me supply an egg
[1:03:08] right
[1:03:11] because that couldn't be involved
[1:03:13] right
[1:03:14] it's going to be involved for her to say
[1:03:17] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:03:19] well i thought the bride in the end time
[1:03:21] was supposed to say that
[1:03:24] you know
[1:03:26] all right
[1:03:30] so back there when the
[1:03:32] literal act took place
[1:03:38] the literal act between
[1:03:40] eve
[1:03:42] and the beast brought forth the seed of
[1:03:45] the beast
[1:03:47] you agree
[1:03:49] right
[1:03:50] but it wasn't called that
[1:03:54] because that had been called the seed of
[1:03:56] the beast so you know the whole world
[1:03:57] would have known what was going on
[1:04:00] the whole religious world would have
[1:04:01] known it
[1:04:02] so he hid it from the eyes of the wise
[1:04:04] and prudent but he said it exactly right
[1:04:07] what about god being able to say
[1:04:09] something right and us so misunderstand
[1:04:11] it
[1:04:15] he said the surface most subtle of all
[1:04:17] beasts
[1:04:18] he just went right on
[1:04:20] you know he didn't explain that
[1:04:26] right
[1:04:28] so eve and the beast brought the seed of
[1:04:30] the beast
[1:04:33] right
[1:04:36] but satan perverting her
[1:04:38] thinking into unbelief
[1:04:42] turned it from being called the seed of
[1:04:44] the beast
[1:04:46] to the seed of the serpent
[1:04:50] because satan was the one that was
[1:04:51] responsible because the animal right
[1:04:54] even though it would be taken
[1:04:55] and have to be sacrificed the animal
[1:04:57] didn't have anything to do with it
[1:05:02] it was just used
[1:05:04] but as we were ending up this morning
[1:05:05] talking about what
[1:05:07] that that was satan's way
[1:05:09] of trying to enter the human race
[1:05:13] now he knew he could not
[1:05:16] use that beast and enter the human race
[1:05:19] the way
[1:05:20] god could use mankind
[1:05:24] no
[1:05:25] follow me through and you'll get a good
[1:05:26] thought
[1:05:28] don't you know what happened on the day
[1:05:30] of pentecost
[1:05:31] god and man become one
[1:05:36] god came down in a man
[1:05:38] to give him the new birth
[1:05:43] satan can't do that
[1:05:46] so the closest thing he can do
[1:05:50] try as brother tony was saying good
[1:05:51] point
[1:05:53] he was trying his best to kill us
[1:05:58] what was satan's
[1:06:00] point in the beginning
[1:06:02] to kill us
[1:06:04] and you know i've always said and i
[1:06:06] believe it
[1:06:07] i've always said that
[1:06:10] i believe satan he literally believes
[1:06:15] that if he can get enough people on his
[1:06:17] side he's going to be able to whoop god
[1:06:19] somewhere
[1:06:20] you know
[1:06:22] i believe that i've always thought of
[1:06:24] that the point
[1:06:26] why would he want to do it but by
[1:06:27] killing us
[1:06:28] see
[1:06:31] he's trying to destroy
[1:06:32] the human race that god would live in
[1:06:36] right
[1:06:38] he doesn't want to destroy the
[1:06:41] the uh now he doesn't care about his
[1:06:43] death that's what it means it means
[1:06:44] death you see
[1:06:46] but which one did satan rather destroy
[1:06:50] and he'd rather destroy a slot drunk is
[1:06:53] that the other garbage can
[1:06:55] or had he'd rather try to destroy
[1:06:57] someone that was trying
[1:07:01] he's already got the other
[1:07:02] all right
[1:07:04] so then the seed of the serpent
[1:07:09] would bring nothing but death
[1:07:13] upon the human race
[1:07:17] it could not bring life
[1:07:19] god's the only one that can bring life
[1:07:24] his was the seed of unbelief
[1:07:29] and that seed of unbelief is what's
[1:07:31] killing you and me right now
[1:07:36] brother there ain't no unbelief in me
[1:07:38] well pray for me
[1:07:40] all i've got to say about it
[1:07:46] but now remember
[1:07:49] we spend a lot of time talking about the
[1:07:51] seed of the serpent when we really ought
[1:07:52] to be doing this
[1:07:54] it's trying to bring forth the
[1:07:57] the seed of the woman to understand it
[1:08:00] you got to cover the other to bring it
[1:08:02] forth
[1:08:04] see
[1:08:06] eve having no seed
[1:08:10] she couldn't bring forth the promise
[1:08:13] now watch what i'm saying she had an egg
[1:08:17] mary
[1:08:19] having no seed
[1:08:23] just an egg
[1:08:25] she couldn't bring forth right
[1:08:30] but god didn't come and
[1:08:33] energize or make alive the the egg that
[1:08:38] mary produced
[1:08:41] she couldn't do that i mean he couldn't
[1:08:43] do that
[1:08:44] and be mankind brought around said
[1:08:45] having part to do with it and see what i
[1:08:47] love in the bible is the way god does
[1:08:49] things
[1:08:50] you know they offered abraham a burial
[1:08:52] plot to bury his wife in
[1:08:54] and what's it mean if you birds your
[1:08:55] wife there you're gonna bury your family
[1:08:57] and different things you know man
[1:08:58] offered to give it to him
[1:08:59] a man had probably paid him to took it
[1:09:04] but he said no i'm going to buy it
[1:09:08] you realize if it had been given to him
[1:09:09] that would have been a type and then
[1:09:11] jesus christ would have messed up
[1:09:13] but see
[1:09:15] and satan when he offered him all of
[1:09:16] that he said okay i'll take it
[1:09:19] but not
[1:09:20] abraham said no i pay fart
[1:09:23] when it come down jesus christ said no
[1:09:25] satan i'm not going to take anything
[1:09:27] i'm going to pay for it
[1:09:30] and then you don't have no earmarks left
[1:09:32] on it
[1:09:33] to do anything with
[1:09:35] me
[1:09:36] and when it would come
[1:09:38] see then
[1:09:39] it would be the fulfilling
[1:09:43] of that
[1:09:45] i will put enmity
[1:09:50] if you're following what i'm saying then
[1:09:51] see if mary had anything to do with if
[1:09:53] he had anything to do with it
[1:09:55] it couldn't bring forth
[1:09:58] the i will
[1:10:05] well
[1:10:06] that's kind of what people wants today i
[1:10:08] think they want to alter the i i they
[1:10:10] don't want the eye to be him
[1:10:12] you know and that that won't work out
[1:10:17] but the prophet said he first appeared
[1:10:20] in genesis 3 15
[1:10:24] according to the messiah e14
[1:10:27] as the anointed one
[1:10:31] the christ
[1:10:34] that christ would come forth back there
[1:10:37] not how now listen one saying
[1:10:41] the reason i'm giving you that so you
[1:10:43] can go ahead and pull up number 10 if
[1:10:45] you want to
[1:10:48] or 11 excuse me pull up 11.
[1:10:51] the messiah
[1:10:53] my brother around and said the first
[1:10:54] appearing in genesis 3 15.
[1:10:59] we got it
[1:11:00] 61.
[1:11:05] from a seat of the woman
[1:11:07] which was to be the anointed one
[1:11:12] now
[1:11:13] the promise of the messiah
[1:11:17] we know when the messiah came right
[1:11:22] but what about a promise so great
[1:11:25] until god saw
[1:11:27] that promise me
[1:11:29] 4 000 years
[1:11:32] before it transpired
[1:11:34] to him it was already done
[1:11:38] and it would be called the anointed one
[1:11:43] then you can see that anointed one
[1:11:46] coming through the old testament
[1:11:49] to be able to tell
[1:11:51] god a better way of doing things
[1:11:54] the christ the prophet said
[1:11:58] he didn't wait 4 000 years
[1:12:01] to start bringing that promise to pius
[1:12:04] when he walked out of that garden as i
[1:12:06] was quoting this morning and he says
[1:12:08] listen
[1:12:09] i love you and i can't let you go like
[1:12:11] this
[1:12:12] i got the quotes laying on the desk or
[1:12:14] either back in the studio
[1:12:16] he said i'll come down and go out with
[1:12:20] you see if he'd stayed in the christ
[1:12:23] couldn't come
[1:12:25] you you get me if he stayed in the
[1:12:27] garden the christ couldn't come
[1:12:30] but by coming out with them
[1:12:33] there came the christ
[1:12:36] all right
[1:12:36] and that christ could come down through
[1:12:38] which was to be the anointed one all
[1:12:40] through the scriptures all the prophets
[1:12:41] spoke of that coming one
[1:12:43] the anointed king i like that word
[1:12:45] anointed god anointing one and he was to
[1:12:48] be a king who was to be
[1:12:50] israel to freedom and all like that
[1:12:53] but yet who is the anointed king
[1:12:56] who was the real king david wound up
[1:12:57] with to be
[1:12:58] the king anointed to do it but
[1:13:02] jesus christ is the king who was it in
[1:13:04] david it's christ
[1:13:07] all right
[1:13:08] see i've got to move from that because i
[1:13:10] want to get on that point
[1:13:11] see who is the messiah then
[1:13:14] who is the anointed one the christ
[1:13:18] the messiah to redeem according to
[1:13:20] marriage and divorce
[1:13:24] the messiah to redeem
[1:13:27] but he didn't wait
[1:13:28] 4 000 years
[1:13:31] to start coming into being
[1:13:37] he would be back there through the old
[1:13:38] testament as the atonement right
[1:13:41] of the animals
[1:13:43] but he would be there as the christ
[1:13:47] who took care of david who took who
[1:13:49] fought the battles of
[1:13:50] simpson and
[1:13:53] all of those great warriors
[1:13:56] the christ
[1:13:58] coming down
[1:14:03] but yet
[1:14:06] when you call it the seed of the woman
[1:14:11] well let me let brother brown say it go
[1:14:12] ahead with number 13
[1:14:16] future home
[1:14:20] paragraph 3 20 through 23 or something
[1:14:25] you saw him and i'll put in between your
[1:14:26] seed and the serpent seed is it right
[1:14:28] and the woman don't have any seed did
[1:14:30] you ever think of that she has a field
[1:14:32] not a seed see the serpent had already
[1:14:35] placed his seed there
[1:14:38] then if the woman doesn't have a seed
[1:14:42] she has to remain
[1:14:46] to have a seat
[1:14:50] now
[1:14:51] don't stop that
[1:14:53] all the way back under
[1:14:55] i'll warn you that you might find out
[1:14:56] i'll use the same quote
[1:14:58] later on
[1:15:00] when we talk about the seed of the woman
[1:15:01] that come down
[1:15:05] all right
[1:15:06] you see through the sexual and of course
[1:15:08] there had brought from satan the serpent
[1:15:10] which was not a reptile in the legs
[1:15:12] because his legs went off of him he was
[1:15:14] the most subtle the only beast that
[1:15:16] would would do would co-ordinate with
[1:15:19] the woman
[1:15:20] a bc won't do it now once
[1:15:24] and nothing else
[1:15:25] they've tried it
[1:15:27] it won't work see the seed life out of
[1:15:30] the mail won't go into a female woman it
[1:15:32] won't do it know what he's saying you
[1:15:33] can't take the snake now and do it you
[1:15:35] know they've tried
[1:15:37] but the closest thing
[1:15:40] is what
[1:15:42] a chimpanzee and it won't work
[1:15:45] they've tried those things
[1:15:47] but now think about what i'm getting the
[1:15:49] point
[1:15:55] he would promise the seed of the woman
[1:16:00] and she brother brown says
[1:16:02] has to remain
[1:16:04] to have a seed
[1:16:08] which would be jesus christ right
[1:16:13] but she held on to that promise
[1:16:17] and that promise then of the seed of the
[1:16:20] woman
[1:16:22] would be called something else in the
[1:16:24] bible
[1:16:28] that would relate to this day
[1:16:34] it would come to
[1:16:36] revelations
[1:16:38] 3 14.
[1:16:44] to the lady you'll see an age
[1:16:48] and what does it say
[1:16:54] the beginning
[1:16:55] of the creation of god
[1:17:00] that's the revelation to this age
[1:17:04] so the seed of the woman would be the
[1:17:05] beginning of the creation of god
[1:17:12] all right
[1:17:16] i'm trying to get a point to you to see
[1:17:17] what this seed of the woman really is
[1:17:20] it was christ we know
[1:17:23] the promise of the messiah
[1:17:25] but when he got here
[1:17:28] he was called the seat of mary
[1:17:32] he said well no it's not in the bible
[1:17:36] how did he get here
[1:17:41] sure it was a virgin birth
[1:17:46] but yet mary
[1:17:48] said be it unto me
[1:17:50] that's what brought
[1:17:53] the promised son
[1:17:58] come on am i right
[1:18:00] was there mary to say be it unto me
[1:18:02] according to thy word
[1:18:04] all right
[1:18:06] and it would bring into being
[1:18:10] something that would seem odd
[1:18:15] it would bring into being the beginning
[1:18:17] of the creation of god now i don't want
[1:18:18] to spend a lot of time on that because
[1:18:20] that'll be wednesday the lord willing
[1:18:24] but the beginning of the creation of god
[1:18:26] brother ryan said where did
[1:18:28] god begin
[1:18:31] he said it began in the wound of a
[1:18:33] virgin
[1:18:37] that's where he began
[1:18:42] well because you're talking about
[1:18:43] creation
[1:18:47] when we get to it
[1:18:49] he was the only begotten
[1:18:51] but he's called the beginning of the
[1:18:53] creation of god
[1:18:56] and he's called the seed of the woman
[1:19:00] so then the seed of the woman has to be
[1:19:01] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:19:06] sensible a equals b b simon a
[1:19:12] all right
[1:19:18] but you see the beginning of the
[1:19:19] creation of god is god
[1:19:23] being born
[1:19:24] in human flesh
[1:19:27] you're not talking about back there in
[1:19:29] the beginning and the coming down and
[1:19:31] the
[1:19:32] you know the logos the theophany et
[1:19:34] cetera that we preached about all that's
[1:19:36] right
[1:19:37] but talking about
[1:19:40] the seed
[1:19:42] of the woman
[1:19:48] when she doesn't have a seat
[1:19:53] so what link can you put
[1:19:58] you see why i like it and when companies
[1:20:00] not too much but at least i can get down
[1:20:02] to
[1:20:03] saying something and the way i want to
[1:20:04] say it a lot of times you can't
[1:20:06] do it because of company and i don't
[1:20:08] mind company being around i enjoy
[1:20:09] preaching that way
[1:20:12] but see we covered
[1:20:15] a little bit this morning tapped it come
[1:20:16] on down this evening talking about
[1:20:18] it's called mary's seed
[1:20:21] i'll be glad to give you the quote for
[1:20:23] it
[1:20:25] brother random in illustrating mary's
[1:20:28] seed
[1:20:30] he's not talking about her giving
[1:20:33] an egg and god's supplying that right
[1:20:35] he's not talking about that
[1:20:37] he's talking about the
[1:20:39] immaculate or virgin birth
[1:20:43] that would bring him into being but he's
[1:20:44] talking about
[1:20:46] that she must say be it unto me
[1:20:48] according to that word
[1:20:51] so when she says that
[1:20:53] you know what it becomes her seed
[1:20:57] amen
[1:20:58] come on think with me when she said
[1:21:02] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:21:05] it became her seed it's mary's seed
[1:21:14] see it came right to her
[1:21:17] what was said in genesis 3 16 15.
[1:21:23] was fulfilled in her
[1:21:30] and she gave birth
[1:21:33] to the beginning
[1:21:35] of the creation of god
[1:21:43] now what does that beginning of the
[1:21:44] creation of god mean to you after all
[1:21:46] these years we preached about it
[1:21:51] it wasn't a time of god beginning
[1:21:54] the great eternal does have no beginning
[1:21:57] it was a time when he brought into being
[1:22:02] himself
[1:22:03] into
[1:22:04] flesh
[1:22:08] we've got a good one when we get over to
[1:22:10] it when we go back to john 1 14. he said
[1:22:13] and the word
[1:22:15] was made flesh
[1:22:17] and dwelt among us
[1:22:20] see the seed of the woman is called the
[1:22:22] word
[1:22:25] but you see it became mary's seed
[1:22:28] when she accepted it
[1:22:32] all right
[1:22:33] it couldn't happen in eve
[1:22:37] you couldn't accept it
[1:22:40] it couldn't happen down through there
[1:22:43] because it would not be the match-up or
[1:22:44] the scripture being fulfilled
[1:22:47] but the promised christ
[1:22:49] would come
[1:22:51] and not just be a christ
[1:22:53] in mary
[1:22:58] come on
[1:23:01] you agreed with me willian said
[1:23:04] that it takes a egg and a sperm to make
[1:23:07] a seed
[1:23:08] let's see if you can keep agreeing with
[1:23:10] it
[1:23:12] because see when mary said that
[1:23:15] in her wound become a physical
[1:23:19] seed
[1:23:21] that's right you agree yes amen
[1:23:24] a literal seed
[1:23:31] and that literal
[1:23:32] seed would be the seed of mary
[1:23:39] well because it was given them to her
[1:23:43] eve couldn't have it but she could have
[1:23:46] appointed until one would come
[1:23:50] right
[1:23:52] but if she said he'd give me seed christ
[1:23:54] would have come back there
[1:23:57] so it only appointed
[1:24:00] but when mary said be it unto me
[1:24:05] that word she said
[1:24:08] brought into being
[1:24:10] into her wound
[1:24:14] a literal seed
[1:24:20] and it would be the seed of the woman
[1:24:24] you say well how could that be because
[1:24:26] it was given to her
[1:24:29] may i quote a little
[1:24:32] this is my eye
[1:24:36] i come
[1:24:38] because god give it to me
[1:24:42] come on i'm in the message you need
[1:24:44] those quotes
[1:24:47] this is my hand
[1:24:50] god gave it to me
[1:24:51] see when he gave mary that seed
[1:24:55] it
[1:24:56] became her seed
[1:25:03] the seed of the woman came into being
[1:25:10] come on
[1:25:12] the promise of the coming messiah would
[1:25:15] have to have a place to be literal
[1:25:18] or it would be spiritual
[1:25:21] i've got to quote where brother brown
[1:25:22] said if it's spiritual
[1:25:24] you know is the seed of the serpent is
[1:25:26] spiritual
[1:25:27] right
[1:25:28] right you know if it's just spiritual oh
[1:25:30] it's just unbelievably spiritual well
[1:25:32] then jesus christ was spiritual
[1:25:36] right
[1:25:38] because the same thing it says about the
[1:25:39] seed of the serpent says about seed of
[1:25:41] christ oh god
[1:25:44] what is the seed of mary
[1:25:49] the seed of the woman
[1:25:53] god
[1:25:54] creating
[1:25:56] his own body
[1:26:00] to be able to fellowship
[1:26:03] with mankind
[1:26:06] but also to make a per a product
[1:26:09] that would wind up to be
[1:26:13] the body that god would have to
[1:26:16] remove
[1:26:18] himself
[1:26:20] and let die
[1:26:25] that's why it's called the seed of the
[1:26:26] woman
[1:26:29] because that's who it belongs to
[1:26:37] that's why then it would be called the
[1:26:38] beginning of the creation of god
[1:26:43] what
[1:26:45] it would be god creating again
[1:26:49] he wasn't through creating when he ended
[1:26:51] it with adam and eve
[1:26:55] that just ended the physical the prophet
[1:26:57] said creation
[1:26:59] you know human race
[1:27:01] here's one that's going to be borne
[1:27:08] that when he before he's born he's
[1:27:10] called the seed of the woman
[1:27:13] amen
[1:27:14] but when he steps forth out of that he's
[1:27:16] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:27:19] god in human flesh
[1:27:22] john 1 14
[1:27:24] and the word
[1:27:26] was made flesh
[1:27:28] and dwelt among us
[1:27:33] the seed of the woman
[1:27:40] the seed of the woman was what mary gave
[1:27:42] birth to
[1:27:44] so that didn't have anything to do with
[1:27:46] mary did it
[1:27:47] it was just fact it belonged to her but
[1:27:48] she gave birth to it
[1:27:51] i don't mind going ahead with it i'll
[1:27:52] preach it when i get back to it
[1:27:55] i thought we were supposed to give birth
[1:27:57] to the word in the end times
[1:28:05] i thought the prophet of god said it
[1:28:06] like this one time he said that he's the
[1:28:09] beginning of the creation of god he said
[1:28:11] we're the rest of that creation
[1:28:15] so the seed of the woman didn't stop
[1:28:17] back there in genesis
[1:28:19] it didn't stop
[1:28:22] in matthew as we call it
[1:28:26] we have to give birth
[1:28:29] to the word
[1:28:32] in this day
[1:28:34] but it won't be no rapture
[1:28:37] all right
[1:28:39] but see what is giving birth to the word
[1:28:43] you know
[1:28:45] what is it did we say we got to give
[1:28:46] birth to the word well i mean i've read
[1:28:48] it i've read it i've read it read it
[1:28:49] read it read it read it
[1:28:51] how do i give birth
[1:28:54] when that word
[1:28:57] and that spirit becomes one is the only
[1:29:00] way to give birth
[1:29:03] right
[1:29:06] it takes a word and spirit to be one
[1:29:08] word by itself is no good
[1:29:11] letter of the word
[1:29:13] it's just intellectual understanding
[1:29:17] but when god comes down and gives life
[1:29:19] to that word that we hold in there
[1:29:24] amen
[1:29:28] and when it does
[1:29:32] you know we're going to give birth to
[1:29:33] the
[1:29:35] seed of the woman
[1:29:39] if not
[1:29:41] right
[1:29:44] why is
[1:29:46] the 144 000
[1:29:49] called
[1:29:51] the remnant
[1:29:53] of the woman's seed
[1:29:56] what your prophet called it
[1:30:00] they're the remnant you know the piece
[1:30:01] of material you lay out and you've got a
[1:30:03] pattern you go by that's the seed of the
[1:30:05] woman the remnant that's around is the
[1:30:07] same material right it's just not chosen
[1:30:10] for that so it's the remnant of the seed
[1:30:12] of the woman
[1:30:13] the seed of the woman is the dress
[1:30:14] you're making
[1:30:16] while i'm saying that some of your
[1:30:17] sisters are letting them slips get up a
[1:30:19] little bit in the back so work on it all
[1:30:21] right
[1:30:22] trying to be a little different about
[1:30:23] the way i preach
[1:30:25] just drop in there once in a while
[1:30:27] let it go
[1:30:29] but listen church
[1:30:31] i'm trying to get a point across why is
[1:30:34] it called the seat of the woman
[1:30:37] because that's exactly what it is
[1:30:43] it was mary seed that was given to her
[1:30:48] she gave birth
[1:30:51] this bride is giving a word
[1:30:54] to birth
[1:30:58] and to bring forth christ again the way
[1:31:00] he's supposed to be
[1:31:01] and he's the beginning of the creation
[1:31:02] of god and we're the rest of that
[1:31:04] creation i'll repeat these things
[1:31:09] but brother dale you seem to be making
[1:31:10] there's something have something to do
[1:31:11] with it did not the prophet cover it you
[1:31:14] want to read it
[1:31:16] where it says be it unto me according
[1:31:18] thy word he set a bride one day
[1:31:21] i think it's spoken words reasonable
[1:31:23] seed but he said one day the little
[1:31:25] bride will say be it unto me according
[1:31:27] to that word he said sparks will fly
[1:31:31] that's the way he says it he said sparks
[1:31:33] will fly why because it'll bring life
[1:31:38] if
[1:31:39] mary said be it unto me according to thy
[1:31:41] word brought jesus christ god in human
[1:31:44] flesh
[1:31:45] what was the birth of the word brain
[1:31:49] christ again
[1:31:51] no wonder there's going to be a rapture
[1:31:57] what could you do if you got christ back
[1:31:58] here like he was in the beginning
[1:32:03] you don't think he's going to be killed
[1:32:04] this time do you
[1:32:10] see he's going to be here visible the
[1:32:12] prophet said among us
[1:32:14] but he's not here physical that's
[1:32:15] another quote right so you got to get
[1:32:17] the two together he said we'll be back
[1:32:19] here in a corporate body he said we meet
[1:32:20] that now but he said he'd be visible
[1:32:22] among us and raise the dead and we'll go
[1:32:24] in the rapture
[1:32:26] well that's close to physical
[1:32:31] hallelujah it's very close but it's
[1:32:33] still not that because he can't be here
[1:32:36] physically what do you need to be here
[1:32:37] for he's got a body
[1:32:42] we are the people to give birth to the
[1:32:44] word right
[1:32:45] as mary said be it unto me
[1:32:48] that's what we're supposed to be saying
[1:32:51] lord get rid of my ideas and my thoughts
[1:32:59] get rid of me and my ideas and
[1:33:02] let me take what you're saying
[1:33:04] and believe your word
[1:33:09] he said because i will
[1:33:13] and i'm going to drill on that just a
[1:33:14] second then we'll
[1:33:16] get into the point i want to ask you
[1:33:17] this simple question i got wrote down
[1:33:18] here to lies
[1:33:23] when he said i will
[1:33:25] put enmity
[1:33:28] that means he's going to do it
[1:33:31] amen
[1:33:34] right when he said i will that means
[1:33:37] he's going to do it
[1:33:39] all right we spent 45 minutes talking
[1:33:41] about how he's going to do it
[1:33:46] but yet he's going to do it
[1:33:47] himself
[1:33:50] because the seat of the woman is not me
[1:33:52] and you
[1:33:55] no more than mary was the seat of the
[1:33:57] woman
[1:33:59] she gave birth to the seat of the woman
[1:34:06] come on mary wasn't the seed of the
[1:34:07] woman
[1:34:10] because it had to be in it would have
[1:34:12] been back there and even would have said
[1:34:14] he had given me seed and christ would
[1:34:16] have come to her
[1:34:19] no
[1:34:22] he said i will
[1:34:28] what is the promise of the messiah
[1:34:31] i will
[1:34:36] he just borrowed the wound right
[1:34:38] but you know by barring that wound that
[1:34:40] put her into an elevated position
[1:34:43] right
[1:34:45] come on very very elevated position
[1:34:48] that made the world testify
[1:34:51] that there was a virgin mary
[1:34:53] that received god's word
[1:34:55] and gave birth to god's word
[1:34:57] emmanuel god with us
[1:35:00] and it would mean a bride that would
[1:35:02] receive god's word in the end time and
[1:35:04] give birth to the word
[1:35:07] it's called the seed of the woman
[1:35:08] because it was given
[1:35:12] not because she could produce it
[1:35:16] mary couldn't produce a word
[1:35:18] she had to have a husband to get any
[1:35:20] kind of a child
[1:35:26] joseph couldn't get it by itself right
[1:35:29] well that's not even a child you're
[1:35:30] talking about
[1:35:33] that's where people that i don't even
[1:35:34] read
[1:35:35] you run your genealogy sometime
[1:35:38] i wish you would run your genealogy
[1:35:41] and you'll find out your genealogy comes
[1:35:43] to joseph
[1:35:46] boy that messes things up now you say
[1:35:49] what the bible says
[1:35:51] it comes to joseph it don't come to mary
[1:35:54] because women are not in the genealogies
[1:35:56] that's right in the listing
[1:36:01] joseph's journey wasn't the father of
[1:36:03] jesus
[1:36:06] but you're reading the bible it says
[1:36:07] joseph was his
[1:36:08] father right
[1:36:12] but you see we think we know so much
[1:36:16] the seed of the woman is exactly what it
[1:36:18] says
[1:36:19] a seed would be
[1:36:21] given
[1:36:23] and it would come by the woman
[1:36:26] why because she was a fall to start with
[1:36:30] her wound was polluted to start with
[1:36:32] right
[1:36:33] why did he have to come through the
[1:36:34] wound
[1:36:35] if it was apples you could lay him out
[1:36:36] on the table he'd come through an apple
[1:36:42] but see whatever god would bring to be
[1:36:45] the seed of the woman would have to come
[1:36:47] through the wound of the woman
[1:36:52] because it'd be given to her
[1:36:56] but yet in the beginning god never said
[1:36:59] anything about me and you
[1:37:01] he said i will
[1:37:06] i'll put enmity
[1:37:08] i'm gonna do it i'm coming out of the
[1:37:10] garden and going with you
[1:37:14] i love you so much i can't let you walk
[1:37:16] out
[1:37:20] i'll put enmity between the and the
[1:37:23] between the serpent seed and the woman's
[1:37:26] seed
[1:37:28] you'll have to wait four thousand years
[1:37:31] and when you do then i'll bring a virgin
[1:37:33] birth
[1:37:35] he said i'll place it into a wound of a
[1:37:38] woman
[1:37:40] if that don't prove serpent see not just
[1:37:41] like brother brown said on the on the
[1:37:43] future home he said if i don't show you
[1:37:44] the serpent seed he said you're blind
[1:37:47] why did you have to come through a wound
[1:37:51] god could create on a rock and bring a
[1:37:53] child
[1:37:54] right
[1:37:56] come on if he's going to create eggs
[1:37:58] firm
[1:38:00] okay come on let's see if you follow
[1:38:02] this
[1:38:03] he was going to create egg in the sperm
[1:38:05] why couldn't he put it in the monkey
[1:38:12] oh you're silly brother dale no just
[1:38:14] showing how silly we are
[1:38:17] see the seed of the woman then would be
[1:38:19] the seed given to
[1:38:22] her
[1:38:26] because she
[1:38:28] fell
[1:38:30] it wouldn't be given to him be given to
[1:38:32] her
[1:38:36] because she failed
[1:38:40] what did the prophet say he said the
[1:38:41] greatest honor could ever be he said a
[1:38:43] woman can be used in both one side or
[1:38:45] the other he said the worst thing in the
[1:38:46] world said she could be a type of but he
[1:38:48] said she could be a top of the greatest
[1:38:50] in the world
[1:38:51] he said now you're sisters he said i'm
[1:38:53] not talking about you he said not to
[1:38:55] genuine ones
[1:38:59] you know the genuines are going to give
[1:39:00] birth to the word
[1:39:06] then it'll be the word made flesh again
[1:39:09] amen
[1:39:10] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:39:13] was jesus christ
[1:39:15] born in a woman
[1:39:18] that's where he created egg and spirit
[1:39:21] put it in the wound
[1:39:22] and just borrowed it
[1:39:24] but when it came forth it was her seed
[1:39:29] see without her
[1:39:31] it would not have been a human being
[1:39:34] well it's okay prove it okay melchizedek
[1:39:37] spoke into existence and spoke out of
[1:39:39] existence so was the two prophets that
[1:39:40] went down to sodom
[1:39:43] but
[1:39:44] melchizedek could not die for you and i
[1:39:46] never
[1:39:50] he would have to be our brother
[1:39:52] to be able to die for us melchizedek
[1:39:54] couldn't pray the price of sin
[1:39:57] even though it was a body spoken into
[1:39:58] existence and he walked out there and
[1:40:00] ate the calf and done the things and
[1:40:01] then he was spoke right back out of
[1:40:02] existence of god
[1:40:06] but you see
[1:40:09] we think
[1:40:11] that we have it all figured out
[1:40:15] now
[1:40:18] i didn't mean to tie into things of
[1:40:23] the bride being the
[1:40:25] seed of the woman but
[1:40:28] you tell me what it is
[1:40:33] the seed of the woman was jesus christ
[1:40:36] the bride is to give birth to jesus
[1:40:39] christ
[1:40:41] the word
[1:40:43] luther gave birth to the word of his day
[1:40:46] wesley gave birth to the word of his
[1:40:48] pentecost to them
[1:40:50] we've got to give birth to the end time
[1:40:52] word
[1:40:56] but instead of that we wind up arguing
[1:40:58] quoting we say well just say what the
[1:41:00] prophet said
[1:41:03] now don't answer don't raise your hand
[1:41:04] don't say nothing
[1:41:06] okay
[1:41:07] i used to be bad to make you pull you
[1:41:09] out and open you know and just say well
[1:41:12] and pull you out and open but
[1:41:15] i found out how embarrassing that gets
[1:41:17] sometimes and
[1:41:18] i decided not to do it at least today i
[1:41:21] won't
[1:41:22] i said i won't next time
[1:41:27] i want to ask you a simple question
[1:41:33] and you say well how does this tie with
[1:41:34] it well it'll you'll see
[1:41:40] was adam under a
[1:41:43] conditional covenant
[1:41:46] or an unconditional covenant
[1:41:50] right down on your face
[1:41:53] you don't have to tell
[1:41:58] me well brother dale
[1:42:01] adam was under an unconditional covenant
[1:42:03] i got his quotes
[1:42:05] well you know you're right
[1:42:11] adam was under
[1:42:12] you don't need that tree out there
[1:42:14] nothing's alright
[1:42:19] but you know that adam was under an
[1:42:20] unconditional covenant
[1:42:26] how in the world can you be under a
[1:42:29] conditional covenant
[1:42:30] and an unconditional covenant at the
[1:42:32] same time
[1:42:39] how can you and i as human mortals
[1:42:42] think about giving birth to the word
[1:42:52] that solve the problem
[1:42:57] he said well brother dale i got all
[1:42:58] these quotes for that adam was under a
[1:43:00] conditional covenant if you will
[1:43:02] you don't protect that tree
[1:43:06] and that's right
[1:43:09] and they took of the tree and they fell
[1:43:12] that's right
[1:43:20] but to the bride it will give birth to
[1:43:21] the word she will ponder what is being
[1:43:24] said
[1:43:28] and to see
[1:43:30] what it truly is to be the seed of the
[1:43:31] woman
[1:43:35] see what it means be it unto me
[1:43:37] according to that word
[1:43:42] now
[1:43:44] we're not trying to give a physical
[1:43:46] birth right
[1:43:49] so when the bride says be it unto me
[1:43:50] according to thy word it's not a meaning
[1:43:52] of physical
[1:43:56] it's the birth of the word right
[1:44:00] now how can you give birth to the word
[1:44:02] and you believe a trinity
[1:44:08] well brother dale i love the lord i just
[1:44:10] love the lord i just love the lord i'm
[1:44:12] amen i love the lord too
[1:44:15] i believe he's three what do you what do
[1:44:16] you think no no don't believe in that
[1:44:20] well i've got a rock
[1:44:22] and we ain't got no rights
[1:44:25] bible don't teach the trinity does it
[1:44:31] it teaches one true and living god
[1:44:38] and if i asked a question there's a
[1:44:39] reason i didn't see if i asked a
[1:44:41] question i'd say where was the first
[1:44:43] unconditional covenant come into being
[1:44:45] you'd say in abraham
[1:44:50] you that have studied the message
[1:44:52] you would quote me to death right there
[1:44:54] abraham
[1:44:55] unconditionally
[1:45:03] i wonder about a prophet saying that
[1:45:04] adam was on an unconditional covenant
[1:45:10] how about it you believe it
[1:45:15] wade mentioned it here the other day and
[1:45:16] i asked him i said do you realize
[1:45:20] what you're speaking of
[1:45:24] and do you really understand it
[1:45:35] go ahead and get number 14 and we'll get
[1:45:37] this and i'll quit
[1:45:41] this is god's covenant with abraham and
[1:45:43] his seed
[1:45:44] priest in 1956
[1:45:47] 223
[1:45:49] paragraph for e11
[1:45:53] now then when god saw the weakness of
[1:45:55] man
[1:45:56] that how he broke his covenant with him
[1:45:58] in the garden
[1:46:00] then you notice
[1:46:02] god making the covenant
[1:46:04] of the coming of christ
[1:46:12] he never included anyone in it
[1:46:16] are you reading
[1:46:21] a covenant with adam
[1:46:24] don't eat of that tree he was included
[1:46:29] in that covenant right
[1:46:35] god making the covenant of the coming of
[1:46:38] christ he never included anyone in it
[1:46:42] he said i and i is a personal pronoun
[1:46:45] i'll put enmity between thy seed and the
[1:46:48] serpent's seed
[1:46:50] unconditionally
[1:46:52] do you see it
[1:46:55] anybody wait do you see it
[1:47:00] unconditionally
[1:47:07] god said i will
[1:47:09] in other words send a savior
[1:47:14] not now
[1:47:15] adam if you will do a certain thing out
[1:47:17] here
[1:47:18] why we'd have never had a savior
[1:47:22] because adam would have never done it
[1:47:26] but he said i will and when god says i
[1:47:28] will
[1:47:29] it's already done
[1:47:32] now
[1:47:33] so you see
[1:47:35] adam was on a conditional covenant
[1:47:41] but at the same time of being a
[1:47:42] conditional covenant
[1:47:46] he was under an unconditional covenant
[1:47:50] you see it
[1:47:52] no i don't see it
[1:47:55] okay pray about it
[1:47:58] i don't see how you can see under
[1:47:59] conditional and conditional same time
[1:48:00] you ain't looking at it right
[1:48:04] god listen
[1:48:07] god has never made a covenant with
[1:48:09] nobody on condition
[1:48:14] what he did with adam and him no he just
[1:48:16] told them
[1:48:20] he just told them you don't eat
[1:48:23] you're okay
[1:48:27] god's never made a covenant with nobody
[1:48:28] except unconditional
[1:48:33] i want to see it in the word and i want
[1:48:34] to see it in the prophet's message the
[1:48:36] way i'm trying to bring it out
[1:48:41] the coming of christ
[1:48:43] the promise of the messiah was not a
[1:48:45] condition
[1:48:48] he never said adam if you don't need
[1:48:49] that tree i praying to
[1:48:52] never said it that way
[1:48:54] are you with me yes
[1:48:57] did adam you done broke the covenant
[1:48:59] that i gave you
[1:49:01] or the commandment that i told you not
[1:49:03] to eat it right
[1:49:09] you've done done that
[1:49:11] but i'm going to keep my word
[1:49:13] i'm still going to bring
[1:49:16] the coming of christ
[1:49:19] because i said it to start with and i'll
[1:49:21] keep it i
[1:49:23] will
[1:49:24] put enmity
[1:49:30] there is no unconditional covenant in
[1:49:33] god
[1:49:35] god don't make conditions
[1:49:39] you see everybody
[1:49:42] you're not listening
[1:49:47] when he come to abraham he said
[1:49:50] no if adam failed noah failed
[1:49:53] all of us failed
[1:49:56] right
[1:49:58] but he said abraham
[1:50:01] i've already done it
[1:50:05] we think that's an unconditional cut
[1:50:07] that's
[1:50:08] right but he told adam
[1:50:11] he had already done it
[1:50:17] he told adam he put he would not destroy
[1:50:20] him
[1:50:24] he broke
[1:50:25] the laws of god
[1:50:27] mankind broke the laws of god we can't
[1:50:30] keep the laws of god
[1:50:34] but god never gave a law for us to keep
[1:50:39] we
[1:50:41] brother branham said
[1:50:42] accepted law instead of grace
[1:50:47] so it was never god's intention to give
[1:50:49] the law
[1:50:52] well because it made the promise
[1:50:57] i got to think that oh well think it
[1:50:59] over while you do it pray
[1:51:02] pray is a whole lot better than thinking
[1:51:10] adam was told don't you eat
[1:51:14] he ate
[1:51:17] god had already before it ever come into
[1:51:20] being if you've been listening to me
[1:51:24] the tree
[1:51:26] of life
[1:51:28] was in the garden
[1:51:30] if you'll go back you'll find out trees
[1:51:32] were created on the third day
[1:51:37] he didn't wait until adam failed and
[1:51:39] then
[1:51:40] bring the tree
[1:51:45] the promise was before the foundation of
[1:51:47] the world i thought
[1:51:49] because i thought that's what revelation
[1:51:51] 13 8 said
[1:51:55] that he was a lamb slain before the
[1:51:56] foundation of the world
[1:52:00] but when he told adam
[1:52:02] he said him i adam i'll put enmity
[1:52:09] it was his promise
[1:52:13] he never stopped no more
[1:52:17] man's went on conditions
[1:52:20] we've made it conditions if you don't if
[1:52:22] you do like brother branham said
[1:52:24] as listen we was one day and he said it
[1:52:26] like this he said people say what must
[1:52:28] we do to be saved during the book of
[1:52:29] acts he said we tell them what to quit
[1:52:31] doing what not to do and what to do
[1:52:34] he said that wasn't the question they
[1:52:35] asked they asked how do we be saved
[1:52:39] can we give them a book of rules
[1:52:45] he says repent everyone and be baptized
[1:52:48] in the name of jesus christ
[1:52:52] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:52:54] holy ghost
[1:52:56] said we asked them what to do and said
[1:53:00] we tell them what not to do
[1:53:06] well do you believe in just living like
[1:53:08] the devil no i believe in being born
[1:53:10] again that they of the devil
[1:53:15] jesus never come to destroy the law he
[1:53:18] came to magnify it
[1:53:21] make it honorable the scripture says
[1:53:26] because he was the seat of the woman
[1:53:31] that's who he was wouldn't it
[1:53:35] that was mary's seat
[1:53:38] that was the beginning of the creation
[1:53:39] of god
[1:53:41] what's the rest of it supposed to be
[1:53:42] like
[1:53:48] where are you listening i'm just using
[1:53:50] that point
[1:53:51] get us to see how we can so miss
[1:53:53] anything and want to quote ourselves to
[1:53:55] death well now brother dale uh that
[1:53:57] quote dire was before the seals broke
[1:54:02] so we don't believe that quote
[1:54:06] well tear it out
[1:54:08] you remember what i told the brother
[1:54:10] when he told me that about the gifts one
[1:54:11] time he said they already let him be in
[1:54:13] the bibles they don't be tore out i said
[1:54:14] give me a bible
[1:54:18] we solve the problem we just rip it out
[1:54:20] is that being silly i don't think i was
[1:54:22] the one being silly
[1:54:25] i thought he was silly
[1:54:29] to say that some part of god's word is
[1:54:31] not right
[1:54:35] amen brother brown said something go dig
[1:54:38] in there and find out what he's talking
[1:54:39] about
[1:54:42] read that last quote over and over i
[1:54:44] just gave you
[1:54:45] he's talking about the unconditional
[1:54:48] covenant being that god said i will
[1:54:52] it don't matter if you break this you're
[1:54:54] going to break it anyway i know she was
[1:54:56] going to break it
[1:55:02] and i already had that tree sitting
[1:55:04] there
[1:55:08] before you ever sinned i had the tree
[1:55:11] and knowed what i was going to do when
[1:55:13] you did sin
[1:55:16] that i was going to come on the scene
[1:55:21] and i was going to do it
[1:55:23] he said i'm going to leave the garden
[1:55:24] with you adam
[1:55:27] because one day
[1:55:29] the seed of the woman will come
[1:55:32] it did
[1:55:36] it said in the last days there'll be a
[1:55:38] bride of jesus christ
[1:55:41] that will realize who they are
[1:55:44] who are we church
[1:55:47] if we're the rest of that creation as
[1:55:48] the prophet said we were
[1:55:54] then we must be the seed of the woman
[1:55:56] amen
[1:55:59] but that's just too far now brother dale
[1:56:01] you're going a little bit too far no i
[1:56:03] ain't went far enough
[1:56:04] because if we are the seed of the woman
[1:56:09] and we do put everything on the basis of
[1:56:11] having a new birth then we're god made
[1:56:13] manifest in a human form called a bride
[1:56:17] now is that far enough to go
[1:56:22] we're not the god of heaven
[1:56:27] come on you follow the teaching of the
[1:56:29] godhead that i've been with you
[1:56:31] when jesus was here on earth
[1:56:34] he said i do nothing
[1:56:37] until the father shows me
[1:56:39] who was that talking am oh just a flesh
[1:56:47] what we were talking about at lunch i
[1:56:48] was trying to get those brothers to see
[1:56:51] where david said the lord said unto my
[1:56:52] lord
[1:56:56] now brother random said he was talking
[1:56:57] in the spirit
[1:57:00] when he said it
[1:57:05] see the reason i don't believe that i'm
[1:57:06] a oneness is because i just can't run
[1:57:08] back there far enough to get oneness out
[1:57:10] of it
[1:57:11] because the further i go back i find
[1:57:12] more manifestations of god
[1:57:20] i told you ain't preached all i can see
[1:57:21] on the god head yet but i'm getting to
[1:57:22] it
[1:57:25] you see i don't have a bit of trouble
[1:57:26] with the father and me praying to him
[1:57:30] up in heaven
[1:57:32] but me saying that he's living right in
[1:57:34] here
[1:57:36] i don't do away with that
[1:57:40] that makes the lord that can talk to my
[1:57:42] lord
[1:57:46] why would you call him
[1:57:49] your advocate
[1:57:55] why don't you call him father
[1:57:57] no as an advocate with the father
[1:58:01] jesus christ the righteous
[1:58:06] when we give birth since the gail to the
[1:58:07] word in the end time it won't be me and
[1:58:09] you
[1:58:13] it'll be christ
[1:58:16] the seed of the woman
[1:58:18] that's when i've tried my best to preach
[1:58:20] adoption to people and looking at it
[1:58:22] most everybody preaches here's the the
[1:58:24] father just going off the scene he's
[1:58:26] leaving and we're going to take over
[1:58:28] well one of these days i'll speak the
[1:58:30] word
[1:58:34] well i didn't know that was anywhere in
[1:58:35] the bible i thought the one that claimed
[1:58:38] to be god in human flesh said i do
[1:58:40] nothing until my father shows me
[1:58:43] that's what i thought
[1:58:45] i thought adoption
[1:58:47] with the father coming on the scene
[1:58:49] in the nature of the sun
[1:58:52] right until the father and the son is
[1:58:55] identical
[1:58:58] and that's not two gods or two persons
[1:59:02] and then when it's all over with
[1:59:06] we can still look up there and say
[1:59:08] the lord said unto my lord
[1:59:12] amen
[1:59:14] you still haven't caught on to what i
[1:59:15] use in genesis
[1:59:17] genesis 1 it says elohim lord
[1:59:21] capital
[1:59:23] no it don't say capital in genesis 1.
[1:59:27] it says god
[1:59:29] in a lower case
[1:59:34] which is the word
[1:59:36] genesis 2
[1:59:38] when he created man it says lord god
[1:59:42] capital l o r d
[1:59:44] small case g o d
[1:59:47] read a little while longer and it says
[1:59:49] small case l o r d
[1:59:51] and a big case g o d
[1:59:55] then you go over to hebrews 1 and it
[1:59:57] says god
[2:00:00] g-o-d large
[2:00:02] letters
[2:00:04] he said oh that's just the start of a
[2:00:05] sentence oh man
[2:00:07] then go over to worst what is john 5
[2:00:09] what is it is it 5 24 where it says god
[2:00:12] is a spirit
[2:00:15] it started to send us with god as a
[2:00:17] spirit it's a little case
[2:00:22] you see folks we're just getting enough
[2:00:24] to understand god
[2:00:27] while we're here in this world
[2:00:30] we're just getting enough to know a
[2:00:32] little bit about him
[2:00:34] it'll be an ever learning eternity
[2:00:37] about god in his ways
[2:00:41] you know the ones that are going to be
[2:00:42] there to understand it are going to be
[2:00:43] those that are
[2:00:45] the continuation
[2:00:47] of the creation of god
[2:00:54] that continuation of the creation of god
[2:00:56] started on day of pentecost
[2:00:59] it didn't start in this last days
[2:01:01] it started on the day of pentecost in
[2:01:04] the bride of jesus christ
[2:01:06] it climaxes with a group of people in
[2:01:08] the end time realizing who they are
[2:01:13] and knowing what we're here for
[2:01:15] we're here to strip satan of every power
[2:01:18] that he ever thought he had
[2:01:23] and yet we get sick and we start crying
[2:01:26] yeah
[2:01:28] oh lord
[2:01:31] stand up and face him
[2:01:33] that's right
[2:01:34] just face him and say satan
[2:01:36] get out of here
[2:01:39] you know what you're doing you're
[2:01:40] looking in the mirror because you know
[2:01:41] who you're talking to
[2:01:42] the guy that's looking at you in the
[2:01:44] mirror
[2:01:46] just say bye stripes i'm healed
[2:01:52] and then just keep walking
[2:01:54] go to doctor
[2:01:55] glory
[2:01:57] we do everything we can to help
[2:01:59] ourselves in that way
[2:02:05] but we don't depend upon the doctor
[2:02:10] right
[2:02:12] that's why i think you ought to be at
[2:02:13] church when you're sick
[2:02:16] i never i don't understand that now come
[2:02:18] on folks i'm human
[2:02:21] there are sicknesses you can't be at
[2:02:23] church
[2:02:24] right
[2:02:27] but when we got a toenail
[2:02:29] hurting yeah
[2:02:32] well
[2:02:33] my foot hurt
[2:02:35] i wanted to sit at home and hold it up
[2:02:38] that's what the doctor told me to do
[2:02:44] yeah
[2:02:47] you yield to your sicknesses you're just
[2:02:48] accepting it
[2:02:50] but if you fight it
[2:02:52] ask brother gary about what his daddy
[2:02:53] told
[2:02:58] they told him what was it was it was 80
[2:03:00] or something
[2:03:01] of his patients that told him the first
[2:03:03] day in in in medical school said if you
[2:03:06] won't hinder your patients 80 of them
[2:03:09] get well
[2:03:11] right
[2:03:13] think about it church
[2:03:15] seed of the woman
[2:03:17] be in the seed of mary
[2:03:20] be in the seed of christ
[2:03:21] being the beginning of the creation of
[2:03:23] god being the seed of the bride in the
[2:03:24] end time
[2:03:26] the word
[2:03:30] the word right
[2:03:31] let's stand come on brother
[2:03:34] took a little bit longer i thought i'd
[2:03:35] be too short because i didn't have just
[2:03:37] a few notes
[2:03:39] but it's all right
[2:03:42] i hope you understand i don't try to be
[2:03:43] smart by giving illustrations
[2:03:46] but i just wanted to illustrate it that
[2:03:47] we think about
[2:03:49] oh it's just oh adam was under a
[2:03:51] conditional covenant
[2:03:53] and that's right he was
[2:03:56] but as far as god is concerned he was on
[2:03:58] an unconditional covenant
[2:04:03] because god had done said i will do it
[2:04:07] he didn't say adam if you halfway try
[2:04:13] he said i've done done it
[2:04:17] he didn't ask mine and you're okay to
[2:04:19] bring jesus christ into the world two
[2:04:21] thousand years ago did he
[2:04:26] well the biggest problem we've had we'd
[2:04:27] be a hendrix
[2:04:30] right
[2:04:31] oh no no that baby yeah
[2:04:33] we'd be a hindrance to his word
[2:04:37] let's get rid of ourselves and get on
[2:04:38] into it what we got boys
[2:04:43] okay let's go
[2:04:52] uh
[2:05:14] our little sister's been complaining
[2:05:15] with stomach problems and vomiting and
[2:05:18] things
[2:05:30] father
[2:05:31] in the name of jesus christ
[2:05:34] the one we spoke of this day
[2:05:36] we condemn this sickness
[2:05:39] not us
[2:05:41] but the spirit of the living god
[2:05:42] speaking through us saying
[2:05:44] by your
[2:05:46] scribes and we thank you
[2:05:49] in jesus name
[2:06:26] sinners
[2:06:30] because the seat of the woman is going
[2:06:32] to be there
[2:06:35] somebody's got to give birth
[2:06:39] why don't we believe
[2:06:44] let's give birth to our part
[2:06:48] let everybody else
[2:06:52] part of the word that we are to be
[2:07:10] we're supposed to be
[2:07:15] somebody ask yourself what are you not
[2:07:17] the bride of jesus christ
[2:07:20] what right have i got to say anything
[2:07:22] else
[2:07:37] anybody else before we go
[2:07:50] oh
[2:08:01] if you want to see a beautiful picture
[2:08:02] of the bride in the end time
[2:08:06] turn over to revelation 19.
[2:08:10] and read
[2:08:13] where he said his wife has made herself
[2:08:15] ready
[2:08:19] she rides back with him
[2:08:35] how many promises brother ray enter in
[2:08:37] the message that the prophet told us
[2:08:41] that we would
[2:08:48] be dismissed remember the services
[2:09:05] two
[2:09:27] you
