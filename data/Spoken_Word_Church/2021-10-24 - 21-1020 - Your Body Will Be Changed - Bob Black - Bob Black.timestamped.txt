[16:43] word help us lord jesus that you'll

[16:46] and give us encouragement lord and
[16:48] understanding we pray
[16:50] lord we open just our hearts this
[16:52] afternoon lord jesus as we gather here
[16:54] together around your word lord and
[16:55] invite you in to move among us lord
[16:57] jesus and be with us tonight lord jesus
[16:59] we ask in your name
[17:02] amen so in mark chapter 16 verses 1 and
[17:06] 2 it says and when the sabbath was
[17:09] passed
[17:10] mayor magdalene and mary the mother of
[17:12] james and salome had bought sweet spices
[17:14] that they might come and anoint him and
[17:17] very early in the morning the first day
[17:19] of the week they came unto the sepulcher
[17:21] at the rising of the sun
[17:25] and romans 8 11 says
[17:27] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[17:29] jesus from the dead
[17:35] dwell in you
[17:37] he that raised up christ from the dead
[17:40] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[17:43] by spirit that dwelleth in you
[17:53] my
[17:54] i feel this i feel his spirit right now
[17:58] now
[17:59] you know we we come to church and we've
[18:02] uh many of us have been
[18:04] uh christians for many years and and we
[18:06] come to church and it's almost like uh
[18:08] you know you battle through things and
[18:10] you you go through things to to overcome
[18:13] things in your life and and you know
[18:15] first of all to be a christian and to
[18:16] get the new birth and you and you as you
[18:18] keep going on you
[18:20] sometimes maybe we lose sight of what
[18:22] the ultimate goal is and i still believe
[18:24] that god is going to change our bodies
[18:26] and and i believe that that we have we
[18:29] have been given in this hour the recipe
[18:32] of how our bodies are going to be
[18:33] changed maybe you look back and remember
[18:36] early on when you became a christian and
[18:38] you you were kind of probing at things
[18:39] and wondering how things worked and
[18:41] wondering why well how how do you even
[18:43] know whether you were born again or not
[18:44] whether what what what the what what the
[18:47] difference between all these the true
[18:48] and the false and all these kind of
[18:49] things are and then you begin to wonder
[18:51] well how are our bodies going to be
[18:53] changed is it is do we just keep
[18:55] marching along and all of a sudden
[18:56] something happens or is something that
[18:58] we have to have give be given some some
[19:01] special ability or something
[19:03] but i believe that the recipe for how
[19:05] our bodies are going to be changed is
[19:07] laying in the message it's laying in the
[19:09] bible and we've got it so i want to talk
[19:11] about that tonight and and kind of build
[19:13] up your faith to know that that your
[19:15] body is going to be changed if you can
[19:17] follow this recipe if you can get into
[19:19] the word and and
[19:21] and follow the prescription that has
[19:23] been outlined for us in the message
[19:25] now the scripture that i just read in
[19:28] mark chapter 16 very early in the
[19:29] morning the first day of the week they
[19:31] came under the sepulcher at the rising
[19:33] of the sun and then these two ladies
[19:34] they came to these two sisters they came
[19:36] to the open tomb and they looked inside
[19:38] and they they saw the proof that that
[19:41] jesus was gone you know they'd been
[19:43] following him for many years and and
[19:45] maybe they began to wonder as they saw
[19:47] him die on the cross wonder
[19:49] what is all this about and you know see
[19:51] see the the effects of peter uh
[19:54] betraying jesus and saying well i don't
[19:56] know him and all all that night as the
[19:58] events unfolded and that maybe looking
[20:00] around and seeing men that you had
[20:02] confidence in kind of fall away and uh
[20:05] you know think about all the ones that
[20:06] follow jesus ministry and then
[20:08] along along the way they begin to go off
[20:10] and and you don't see them anymore
[20:13] but yet here as they came to the tomb
[20:15] was the proof the proof that everything
[20:18] that they had been taught everything
[20:20] that they had believed in
[20:21] everything it was the proof of the thing
[20:24] and see everything everything's got to
[20:25] be proven out maybe that's something
[20:27] sometimes we kind of
[20:29] don't like it so much maybe maybe young
[20:31] people tonight you maybe you at a place
[20:33] in your life where you don't want to be
[20:35] proven out but everything's got to be
[20:36] proven out it's got to be proven out
[20:38] what you're really made of whether
[20:40] you're going to be a real man or not
[20:42] whether you're going to be a real sister
[20:43] or not
[20:44] whether you're going to be a real
[20:45] believer or not it's got to be proven
[20:47] out and you see you see even jesus had
[20:49] to be proven out and the proof was when
[20:52] he rose up from the grave it proved that
[20:55] everything that he everything that he
[20:56] said was proven
[20:58] brother abraham said there's many little
[21:00] fine little babies born and there's many
[21:02] man who has suffered and died for a real
[21:04] cause but never there never was one
[21:07] there never was a man even though there
[21:10] had been a lot of people good people in
[21:11] earth there was never a man that could
[21:13] raise himself up again until this day
[21:16] never a man that could raise himself so
[21:18] he proved what he said he said man can
[21:21] say things but yet it isn't exactly can
[21:23] be believed upon thoroughly until it's
[21:25] been proved to be the truth what proves
[21:28] what proves the message to be the truth
[21:30] what proves it is the quickening power
[21:32] of the holy ghost to come upon the word
[21:34] that you have believed and make it come
[21:36] to life you see there's got to be a time
[21:39] there's got to be something to prove
[21:41] that what you've heard and what you
[21:42] believed something within you to make it
[21:44] live something direct make it rise up
[21:47] from that dead denominational grave that
[21:49] you come out of something to make you
[21:51] walk and talk just like jesus and you
[21:54] see when it come forth from the grave
[21:55] that's what he came forth to prove that
[21:58] that same life that caused him to raise
[22:00] from the grave that same life has power
[22:02] to make you to quicken your mortal body
[22:05] and make you walk and talk just like he
[22:07] did
[22:10] brotherhood said he said what good would
[22:11] any of it do you whether you had lent or
[22:14] not lent if there is no life in you you
[22:16] see that's what it is it's the life the
[22:18] life is what's important it's only a
[22:21] memorial he said satan doesn't care how
[22:23] religious you are or how right you are
[22:26] in your doctrine if you miss that life
[22:29] you won't cup up anyhow
[22:32] let me pause on that for a little bit
[22:33] because you know when you read
[22:35] statements like that it doesn't satan
[22:36] don't care how right you are in your and
[22:39] then your mind begins to go places your
[22:41] mind begins to go places like you begin
[22:43] to think maybe maybe well okay it
[22:45] doesn't matter what i believe but i want
[22:48] to declare to you tonight that it does
[22:50] matter what you believe it matters what
[22:52] you stand for that's why that's why god
[22:55] sent us a prophet in this last day to
[22:57] straighten up what we believe but you
[22:59] got to believe it it doesn't matter it
[23:01] doesn't matter how much you just look at
[23:03] the car and polish it up and say look
[23:05] look at all the good stuff we got
[23:07] sitting over there on our shelf but you
[23:09] got to believe it when you believe it
[23:12] something will begin to happen something
[23:13] will spark and it will come to fruition
[23:18] he said no matter how religious
[23:20] how good how many churches you belong to
[23:22] or will belong to it doesn't matter one
[23:25] thing unless you have been born again
[23:28] you see what he's saying no matter no
[23:30] matter how good you think no matter how
[23:32] good he touch you know how many how
[23:34] religious how everything's all polished
[23:36] up and it looks real good but until you
[23:39] have that life on the inside it doesn't
[23:41] matter one thing
[23:45] now brother burnham said he said there
[23:46] was a time
[23:48] there was a time when the world not
[23:50] maybe just think that as as we go
[23:52] through this study think about the the
[23:54] thought that brother brown is trying to
[23:55] communicate to us as he said there was a
[23:58] time when the world was laying in utter
[23:59] darkness and there was a time when you
[24:01] were laying in utter darkness you were
[24:03] going through life not knowing what what
[24:05] you were here for what your purpose was
[24:06] in life you were sinner and lost and
[24:09] everything and then what happened to you
[24:10] is the same thing that happened to the
[24:12] earth the same thing that happened to
[24:14] the earth happened to you there was a
[24:16] time when the world was laying in
[24:18] darkness it was without form and was
[24:20] void and it was all
[24:21] covered with water and was laying there
[24:23] in the dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and
[24:26] the spirit of god moved upon that water
[24:28] and said let there be light in other
[24:30] words god spoke he spoke the word you
[24:33] see that's the same thing that happened
[24:34] to you when you were living in darkness
[24:37] one day you heard the word spoken it was
[24:39] spoke over you let there be light maybe
[24:42] not those exact words but you heard a
[24:44] preacher preaching that you need to be
[24:45] born again you heard a preacher
[24:47] preaching that you need to go to the
[24:48] water and be baptized and yet something
[24:50] down you begin to you begin to say i
[24:53] believe that that preacher's right i
[24:55] believe he knows what he's talking about
[24:57] they led you to the message and they
[24:58] began to preach and you're listening to
[25:00] the message tapes and you begin to
[25:01] listen and study and some of them begin
[25:04] to grow on the inside something is
[25:06] happening to you
[25:08] why because it's the word of god
[25:10] received into your heart the word will
[25:12] have an effect just like the word had an
[25:14] effect as it was spoken over a a world
[25:17] without form and void just
[25:20] brother brahman said the first light was
[25:22] ever given in the earth was god's spoken
[25:24] word the first light that ever struck
[25:27] the earth was god's spoken word he said
[25:29] let there be light and there was light
[25:31] and the spirit of god moved upon that
[25:33] water and said let there be light he
[25:35] said god had a reason to do that for
[25:38] down beneath that water there was seeds
[25:40] that he had planted and it had to have
[25:43] that sunlight to make it live
[25:46] if you think about that as god was
[25:48] moving over the earth without form and
[25:50] void he knew that there was a seed that
[25:52] was going to come up he knew why because
[25:54] it was in his mind before the foundation
[25:56] of the world and maybe one day you heard
[25:59] that word spoken over you and it was
[26:01] spoken and it came to life because god
[26:03] knew before the foundation of the world
[26:05] that there was a match for you in heaven
[26:07] you were going to come up you came into
[26:09] the world with that cosmic light but
[26:11] when you heard the word spoken over you
[26:13] eternal life came down and melded itself
[26:16] with your soul and you came alive
[26:20] and said and how did you come alive by
[26:22] the word it was spoken over you it's the
[26:25] word that changes you you see it's the
[26:27] word that's gonna make your body change
[26:29] it's the word is transforming you it's
[26:32] transforming your mind it's transforming
[26:34] your character it's changing you bit by
[26:36] bit preset by precept line upon line
[26:39] here a little there with little the word
[26:42] is what is doing it
[26:45] listen
[26:46] if his word will make the first seed
[26:48] come forth
[26:50] then it can make a predestinated son or
[26:52] daughter of god spring forth today
[26:55] it's doing the same thing that it did
[26:57] way back then when the world was in a
[27:00] formless and without without any kind of
[27:02] shape and all those things
[27:04] brother said in genesis the first time
[27:06] the sun rose in genesis he was bringing
[27:08] it was bringing a message
[27:10] you think about the sun rising up to
[27:12] bring a message
[27:13] the sun was coming up to bring a message
[27:16] that there will be life upon the earth
[27:17] mortal life
[27:19] mortal life
[27:20] but on easter morning on resurrection
[27:22] morning the s.o.n had risen to bring
[27:25] eternal life to all god's promised seed
[27:28] that by foreknowledge he had seen laying
[27:30] upon the earth now back in genesis when
[27:32] that sun wrote when the sun rose and to
[27:35] deliver a message and christ rose on
[27:37] easter morning to deliver a message what
[27:40] kind of a message should we have tonight
[27:42] today the same kind of a message that
[27:44] there's seeds laying out their seeds
[27:47] that are going to come to force come
[27:49] forth seeds that god has stalled before
[27:51] the foundation of the world that are
[27:52] going to come to life come to life and
[27:55] spring up come to life and grow to
[27:56] maturity come to life and by that word
[27:59] come to a place where they'll be changed
[28:01] where their atoms the atoms of your
[28:03] flesh will be changed
[28:08] i'm reminded of that parable that jesus
[28:10] taught he taught many parables about a
[28:11] sower going forth and so and seed and in
[28:14] one parable he talks about how the seed
[28:16] is the word but in another in matthew 13
[28:19] he said he answered and said unto them
[28:20] he that soweth the good seed is the son
[28:22] of man the field is the world the good
[28:25] seed are the children of the kingdom but
[28:27] the tares of the children of the wicked
[28:29] one in other words in that parable
[28:31] he god is actually sowing individuals
[28:34] how is he sowing by planting the word
[28:36] and you by by sowing the word in your
[28:38] heart but he's sowing individuals the
[28:41] individuals that they thought of before
[28:43] that foundation of the world could you
[28:44] just imagine that imagine that you you
[28:46] have a purpose and a plan for being here
[28:49] it's not just an accident that you're
[28:50] sitting here tonight but god knew before
[28:52] the foundation of the world that you
[28:54] would need something tonight maybe you
[28:56] would receive something tonight if you
[28:57] can believe it if you can believe it if
[28:59] you could just not just look at the
[29:01] tires be polished up not just look at
[29:03] the car laying out there the word that
[29:05] you have access to but believe it and
[29:07] you'll see god move on the scene
[29:11] he said it takes the s-o-n like word the
[29:14] word to bring them to eternal life his
[29:16] chosen ones that he knew before the
[29:18] foundation of the world he had chosen
[29:20] them in himself before the foundation of
[29:22] the world
[29:24] listen i i maybe speak tonight on some
[29:27] some some some quotes and things that
[29:28] might
[29:29] have stumbled people for a long time but
[29:31] i i believe we've come to a place now
[29:33] where we can look into these things with
[29:35] confidence knowing what we believe
[29:37] knowing that we have been hearing by the
[29:39] word to a place where we can receive
[29:40] with confidence what brother madam said
[29:42] and listen and thinking a thinking man's
[29:44] field tree he said notice that word
[29:46] cannot deny itself
[29:48] there then it is satisfied or is the
[29:50] desire it's a desire of what what made
[29:53] you desire it in the first place because
[29:56] down in your soul there was a
[29:58] predestinated seed which was eternal
[30:00] life always laying in there always was
[30:04] in there what is that seed the
[30:06] brotherhood said in the voice of the
[30:08] sign he said there was a seed laying
[30:10] there a predestinated seed that was he
[30:12] said it was god's thought before the
[30:14] foundation of the world in other words
[30:17] before the foundation of the world god
[30:19] knew you were coming he had it prepared
[30:21] for you he had your mama and daddy
[30:23] prepared for you he had them prepared to
[30:25] tell you about the gospel he had the
[30:27] church that you go to prepared he had
[30:29] everything laid out for you because he
[30:31] knew you were coming
[30:35] do you realize that's the message that's
[30:36] the message that was proclaimed when
[30:38] jesus rose from the grave and that wave
[30:41] she fully waved over the people that
[30:43] there's more coming this isn't the end
[30:45] of the story there's more coming he knew
[30:47] you were coming
[30:50] bill graham said in works his faith
[30:51] expressed he said now here predestinated
[30:54] plan is plain view just as others see
[30:56] the word of god is a seed and must have
[30:59] the ground prepared beforehand he said
[31:02] if you sowed seed just throwed it out
[31:04] there on the ground it would do no good
[31:06] the birds would pick it up you throw it
[31:08] among thistles and thorns that'll choke
[31:10] it out pretty soon jesus's parable says
[31:12] so so the ground has to be made ready
[31:15] first so god and sovereign grace
[31:17] prepares the heart first
[31:19] he prepared you before the foundation of
[31:22] the world to receive him in this age he
[31:24] foreknew you by his knowledge and
[31:26] ordained you to eternal life he knew you
[31:29] therefore he prepared you that's the
[31:31] reason he's you staggered out of these
[31:33] things and staggered into what you have
[31:35] now it was god leading you to the place
[31:38] where he had ordained for you to be
[31:40] even when you were like the world
[31:42] without shapeless without form with no
[31:44] purpose in your life not knowing what
[31:46] you're supposed to be yet god knew you
[31:48] were coming first for the you think
[31:50] think about i want to really lay that
[31:52] down before you first heard your very
[31:55] first sermon before anybody told you
[31:57] about the gospel god knew you were
[31:59] coming he knew you were coming forth
[32:02] before you ever heard your first sermon
[32:04] preached he knew you were coming one day
[32:07] you would hear that word preached and
[32:08] you would receive it in your heart and
[32:10] that seed that predestinated seed laying
[32:13] there before the foundation of the world
[32:14] would come to life
[32:16] god stopped before the foundation of the
[32:18] world
[32:20] so brother brown said if god raised up
[32:22] jesus from the dead did he raise him up
[32:25] for a memorial
[32:27] is this resurrection morning only a one
[32:29] day in the year
[32:30] or a certain day that we celebrate this
[32:33] or are we benefactors of his
[32:35] resurrection
[32:37] and he asked this question what does it
[32:39] mean
[32:40] to me
[32:41] what does it mean to you
[32:44] is it a memorial where we look we look
[32:46] over at a grave and we say well like you
[32:48] know that's what a memorial is all these
[32:50] memorials to the veterans the vietnam
[32:52] veterans and all the different war war
[32:54] ii veterans you go and you look at a
[32:56] grave and you think well you remember
[32:58] and you think thing you think nice
[33:00] thoughts that's what that's what the
[33:02] gospel is to a lot of people but the
[33:04] gospel is to proclaim that jesus is not
[33:06] dead but he's alive listen to that same
[33:09] life that rose him from the grave and
[33:11] changed his mortal body is here tonight
[33:14] to quicken every fiber of your being
[33:16] here tonight to make you change to
[33:18] change you from the things of the world
[33:20] to take away all that depression and sin
[33:22] and sickness and heartache and give you
[33:24] a joy that passes all understanding
[33:27] knowing that that eternal life is on the
[33:29] inside of you
[33:33] he said the secret was made known
[33:35] the seal was opened
[33:37] to prove what kind of seal what kind of
[33:40] secret to prove that you're going to
[33:42] come up to
[33:43] that's the message that was preached on
[33:45] easter morning as he rose from the dead
[33:48] that you're coming up too you're coming
[33:49] up with him as he rose that life if
[33:52] you're in him if you're in him tonight
[33:54] that same life that was in him rose you
[33:57] up from the from your dead ideas and
[33:59] thinks
[34:00] brother said the seal on the sunrise was
[34:03] broken and the secret of life after
[34:05] death was revealed
[34:06] he said before that time we didn't know
[34:08] the world groped and darkness groped
[34:10] around banned suspicion theories was a
[34:13] man among man's heart tradition made up
[34:16] man worshipped idols they worshipped the
[34:18] son they worshiped all kinds of gods and
[34:20] all kinds of people that made claims
[34:22] they all went into the grave and they
[34:24] stayed in the grave but the real seal
[34:27] had been broken and one who once lived
[34:29] as we live died as we will die was risen
[34:32] from the dead what a morning he said the
[34:35] secret was made known that he was both
[34:38] resurrection and the life
[34:40] because he was the proof
[34:43] you know even in the natural you find
[34:45] business people want to go find a
[34:47] business person that that
[34:49] has become successful in their life and
[34:51] they look at that person and they go sit
[34:53] under their feet and they learn from
[34:54] them so that they can learn how to make
[34:56] money or how to do just in life you look
[34:59] at somebody that's been successful in
[35:00] their life that is able to raise
[35:02] children and able to set up a good home
[35:04] or whatever and you
[35:06] many times you want to sit under their
[35:07] feet and listen to the words that they
[35:09] have but now listen we've got what kind
[35:11] of example do we have we've got an
[35:13] example of somebody that rose from the
[35:15] grave that their mortal body was changed
[35:18] and that's why we sit at the feet of
[35:20] jesus and listen to his words because he
[35:22] proved that that the things that he
[35:24] talked about were true that quickening
[35:27] power was in him and it proved it that's
[35:29] why we
[35:30] we give everything that we have over to
[35:33] him
[35:35] we give our whole life our whole being
[35:37] over to him to study out these things
[35:40] just
[35:41] to yield ourselves in prayer to give
[35:43] ourselves holy to this one who's been
[35:45] proven proven to raise from the death
[35:48] the only one like brother baby said
[35:49] there's been a lot of good people that
[35:51] that did a lot of good things but nobody
[35:53] ever rose from the grave like this man
[35:56] and he said when he come forth on that
[35:57] morning because i live
[36:00] you'll live also
[36:01] he said that was the breaking of the
[36:03] seal because he was brought up so will
[36:06] everyone that's in christ be brought up
[36:08] with him that's the breaking of the seal
[36:10] because he lives i can live also because
[36:13] he came forth i can i can be changed
[36:15] also because of what he did all that
[36:18] power that was given to him has been
[36:19] given over to the church
[36:21] he's able to live in the church he's
[36:23] able to quicken he's able to quicken and
[36:25] change you and change your mortal bodies
[36:27] the seed has come to life you're rising
[36:30] up jesus said all those seed that was
[36:31] resting and brotherhood said all those
[36:33] seed that was resting in god's great
[36:35] promise was a benefactor of that
[36:36] resurrection to life because he raised
[36:39] from the dead we also have raised from
[36:41] the dead for we were in him
[36:45] now brother brown said
[36:47] he said now when he rose from the grave
[36:49] he conquered satan's trinity and what
[36:52] was satan's trinity that this what that
[36:54] was the trinity of the trinity of the
[36:56] devil death hail and the grave he said
[36:59] that was the trinity of satan being
[37:00] caused by one thing that was death death
[37:03] you go with the grave and being a sinner
[37:05] you go to hell and the very all the very
[37:07] one thing the trinity of satan which was
[37:10] death that had held man in captivity and
[37:13] all these years held man in captivity
[37:15] all these years and how did he break how
[37:17] did he break the everything that that
[37:19] trend the trinity of satan was doing how
[37:22] did he do it by bottling everything that
[37:24] all the deity up in one man
[37:27] and accomplishing the work the way
[37:29] brother brahm said this i don't want to
[37:31] stumble a little bit but the words that
[37:33] brother brown uses he said the true
[37:35] trinity of god the true trinity of god
[37:39] god how what what do you mean true
[37:41] trinity of god
[37:42] god being one manifested in christ who
[37:45] was life and had broke the seals and
[37:47] conquered the enemy and rose up the one
[37:50] true and living god god in one made man
[37:55] god in one made man put into flesh and
[37:59] dwelt among us and conquered every enemy
[38:02] and had proved that the trinity of satan
[38:04] was conquered and that the trinity of
[38:06] god was made known
[38:08] because only god alone had power to
[38:11] bring life back again he was that
[38:13] emmanuel god had been manifested in the
[38:16] flesh you see what a great revelation
[38:19] this message has brought us that
[38:21] god has not split up in three different
[38:23] people but he's in three offices manif
[38:25] and he was manifested in that one man
[38:28] manifesting the true trinity of god god
[38:30] and one god and one man
[38:32] now you see why brother brahma said
[38:33] would say when you've got the holy ghost
[38:35] you've got the father son and holy ghost
[38:37] in you because it's one one manifested
[38:40] in you and what's he doing now he's
[38:41] manifesting that same god the true
[38:44] trinity of god and the flesh of his
[38:46] bride today come back to manifest
[38:48] himself in fullness proving that he had
[38:50] raised from the dead brother said fear
[38:52] not for i am he that was dead and is
[38:55] alive again forevermore and i have the
[38:57] keys to death and hell i've already
[38:59] conquered it don't fear any more for
[39:01] every foreordained predestinated seed of
[39:04] god that shall come the lot shall come
[39:06] to life when that light spreads across
[39:08] the earth the glorious gospel in every
[39:11] age it'll bring forth a crop that god
[39:13] ordained it to do
[39:15] he was quickened you see he was
[39:17] quickened so that you could be quickened
[39:20] the same life that quickened me brother
[39:21] brahma said the power that brought me
[39:23] from the grave i will send it upon you
[39:26] to quicken you that where i am there ye
[39:29] will be also
[39:31] he come to redeem or to bring to life
[39:34] those predestinated seed that god seen
[39:36] before the foundation of the world and
[39:38] put their names in the book
[39:41] but we need the spirit to make it live
[39:45] and brother brahman said we as his
[39:46] servants are commissioned by him to go
[39:48] into all the world and to bring this
[39:49] good news to every person that he is a
[39:51] living
[39:52] that he's a living
[39:54] and he said and how can we do it
[39:56] by word only
[39:58] oh goodness we're getting into some
[39:59] stuff that stumbles people how can we do
[40:02] it by word only you see we get we get
[40:04] taught a lot of things
[40:06] a lot of a lot of word is laid out and
[40:08] yeah i want to maybe tackle this
[40:10] afternoon the idea that we don't need
[40:12] the word well the idea that we don't
[40:14] need the moving of the spirit in our
[40:16] lives and how do you get it because
[40:18] brother brown lays out the plan in this
[40:20] message if you've got the word you've
[40:22] got the mechanics how do you get the
[40:24] dynamics and he lays it out in here he
[40:26] said he said i'm afraid that too many of
[40:29] us are not getting people to christ what
[40:31] is getting people to christ getting
[40:33] people to christ is getting people to
[40:35] the word see sowing that seed and then
[40:38] getting them to believe the things that
[40:40] they've heard getting them to see christ
[40:43] actually moving in their life not just
[40:45] going to church and sitting there and
[40:48] looking at
[40:49] looking at things moving looking at
[40:50] criticizing
[40:52] he said we're getting them to a church
[40:54] to a theory but we must get them to
[40:56] christ
[40:57] you see the word is not something just
[40:59] to argue over but it's not something to
[41:01] argue over but to believe
[41:05] the word is not something to make a camp
[41:07] about and set up a set up a tent and
[41:09] camp out on your theology or your church
[41:11] or your membership or your theory or or
[41:13] your religion or all those kind of
[41:15] things but it's actually something to
[41:17] actually believe
[41:18] he said if the life of a man that's dead
[41:20] be projected in you you will live the
[41:23] same life he lives in other words let's
[41:26] not be satisfied with just knowing a lot
[41:28] of things but let's let's crave and
[41:30] let's hunger and move toward actually
[41:32] seeing god demonstrated in our own life
[41:35] actually seeing him visible in our life
[41:37] not just memorizing a lot of things not
[41:39] just knowing a lot of things in our head
[41:41] but actually see and be made manifest in
[41:43] our life
[41:45] what good would it do what good would it
[41:47] do if you packed in all kinds of
[41:49] information but you're still in the
[41:51] prison of pornography what good would it
[41:53] do if you've got all kinds of knowledge
[41:55] packed into your mind but you're still
[41:56] under bondage of temper tantrums and
[41:59] not being able to have a relationship
[42:01] with your wife and just bound by things
[42:03] of this world but god sent that
[42:05] quickening power into the church to
[42:06] change your life to quicken your mortal
[42:09] body
[42:11] he said if your spirit that's in you is
[42:13] wrecking dead and you are anointed with
[42:14] the life that was in christ is upon you
[42:17] that same life that insane powers them
[42:21] same beneficiaries that he had here on
[42:23] earth from god and it's not the word is
[42:26] not said so we can be critical of others
[42:28] and
[42:29] critical of other people
[42:31] many times the word will make you
[42:32] critical that just just hearing the the
[42:34] the bare mechanics because you'll look
[42:36] at somebody come up for healing and
[42:37] you'll be like well they didn't get
[42:39] healed i wonder why they didn't get
[42:40] healed maybe there's something wrong in
[42:42] their life or you look at you look at
[42:44] somebody begin to praise and you'll
[42:46] wonder there must be they i'm sure they
[42:48] don't really get it the way that they
[42:49] should get it and you begin to look
[42:51] because you've got all that knowledge
[42:52] heaped up on the inside and you begin to
[42:54] look with a critical mind towards
[42:56] somebody that's praising god and
[42:57] somebody maybe that doesn't preach the
[42:59] way that you think they should preach
[43:01] and you begin to look look but
[43:04] instead of looking with a critical mind
[43:05] in the critical eye i want to look for
[43:07] and expect the dynamic power of a living
[43:10] god believing that only only believe all
[43:14] things are possible to them that believe
[43:20] now the problem is
[43:21] the problem is and i i want to lay this
[43:23] down tonight the problem is that when
[43:24] the word is preached
[43:26] we have such a hard time actually dying
[43:28] out to our own ideas and we'll sit there
[43:30] and we'll argue it out within our own
[43:33] within our mind and we'll argue out and
[43:35] i don't know if that ministry is right
[43:36] and i don't know if that i don't know if
[43:37] what my mama and daddy are telling me is
[43:39] right i don't know if what people are
[43:40] saying is right and you are argue and
[43:43] argue and argue you know you can tell a
[43:45] lot about somebody by whether they argue
[43:47] with the word when the word is laid out
[43:49] in front of them and they argue back
[43:51] when a standard is put before the
[43:53] children and they argue back we there's
[43:55] a standard of holding us while we dress
[43:58] the way we do and why we come to church
[44:00] every time the doors are open and when
[44:01] you argue back and say why do we have to
[44:03] do that why do we have to come to church
[44:05] it shows that there's something lacking
[44:07] why do i need to be in the house of god
[44:09] every time why why why but one day when
[44:11] that quickening power comes upon the
[44:13] word that you've failed to believe up
[44:15] till now something will change it'll
[44:17] change your character it'll change you
[44:19] from an arguer to a believer you see
[44:21] what our problem is we don't die out to
[44:23] our own ideas if you can begin to
[44:26] listen i'm telling you i'm i'm telling
[44:28] you something real i know what i'm
[44:30] talking about if you tell if you can
[44:32] turn your soul toward the word and say
[44:34] maybe i was wrong
[44:36] maybe the things that i held down in my
[44:38] heart were not right maybe my mama and
[44:40] daddy do know what they're talking about
[44:42] maybe the ministers at this church do
[44:44] know what they're talking about and you
[44:46] begin to die out to your own ideas die
[44:49] out to your own way of thinking accept
[44:51] the mechanics that have been laid out
[44:53] before you the quickening power of
[44:54] dynamics will come
[44:57] stop arguing with the word
[44:59] just accept it and believe it that's i
[45:01] believe one of the most profound
[45:03] scriptures in the bible is where jesus
[45:05] said if you can come to me as a little
[45:07] child come to me as a little child just
[45:10] saying i believe it not arguing it out
[45:12] not saying well i don't understand why
[45:14] he would preach those things is he
[45:16] trying to attack somebody is he trying
[45:18] to come after somebody in the church but
[45:20] don't argue with it just believe it just
[45:22] accept what god has already said and
[45:24] believe it
[45:27] if we could see how simple the message
[45:29] really is how simple the gospel really
[45:31] is is when the truth is laid out before
[45:33] you all you got to do is believe it all
[45:35] you got to do is accept it and die out
[45:37] to your old ideas just believe what's
[45:39] been spoken
[45:42] bill brother said how did he know how
[45:44] did we know he was the christ because he
[45:46] proved what he talked about he proved it
[45:49] he proved it by his life he proved it by
[45:52] his ministry and he proved it by raising
[45:54] from the grave
[45:56] and you've got to be proven too
[45:58] he said how will i know the message of
[46:00] the hour
[46:01] god proves what he promised and he talks
[46:04] about it he said that is the
[46:05] identification that we are beneficiaries
[46:08] with him in the resurrection he proves
[46:10] what he has talked about he proves it by
[46:13] making it come up off the page and live
[46:15] before you living where you could
[46:17] actually see a change in your life that
[46:20] once you were shapeless without form
[46:22] without purpose in your life and god
[46:23] plucked you out of the world and put a
[46:25] purpose in you and changed you see
[46:27] you're not bound by pornography you're
[46:29] not bound by depression you're not brown
[46:31] other things of the world anymore but
[46:33] you've been changed
[46:34] he said his spirit brings his same life
[46:37] again on the earth that same spirit by
[46:39] the same works by the same power by the
[46:42] same signs being you it'll also raise
[46:44] you up
[46:48] what he promised to do in christ he
[46:49] proved on the resurrection
[46:52] what he promised to do in the days of
[46:53] moses he proved it
[46:55] what he promised in the days of enoch he
[46:57] proved it
[46:58] in all the days of the apostles he
[47:00] proved it
[47:01] and he has still proven today
[47:04] how's he doing
[47:05] by that same resurrection power
[47:08] what are you talking about brother bob
[47:10] i'm talking about when you look at a
[47:11] christian life and you you can tell you
[47:13] look at somebody when somebody smacks
[47:15] them across the face or says something
[47:17] disagreeable that that christian life in
[47:19] them holds it's a manifesting of the
[47:21] quickening power in their life a real
[47:23] true saint of god that's been molded by
[47:26] the word have to believe that word and
[47:28] the quickening power has come upon that
[47:30] person living inside of them proving
[47:32] that the things that have been spoken of
[47:34] are true
[47:36] that's the kind of proof i believe in
[47:38] that's the kind of proof i stand for the
[47:40] proof of the resurrection
[47:42] he's still proven today and brother ram
[47:44] said the sun has got to be revealed
[47:46] again and the bride in the last day the
[47:48] quickening power has got to come quicken
[47:51] them out of these dead denominations and
[47:53] decrees to a living word of the living
[47:55] god how's it going to come how can the
[47:57] quickening power come it's going to come
[47:59] by the word by the word that we've heard
[48:02] by the word that's laying on our
[48:04] bookshelves that by the word that we've
[48:06] polished up all these years and now it's
[48:08] time to believe it
[48:15] now in leviticus chapter 23 verses 10 to
[48:18] 11 you
[48:19] you don't have to pull that up or
[48:20] anything i'm just going to preach
[48:21] tonight
[48:24] the bible says
[48:25] the word of god to moses will speak unto
[48:27] the children of israel and say unto them
[48:29] will you be coming to the land which i
[48:31] give you and shall reap the harvest
[48:32] thereof then you shall bring a sheaf of
[48:34] the first fruits of your harvest unto
[48:36] the priest under the priest
[48:39] and he shall wave the sheep before the
[48:41] lord to be accepted for you
[48:43] on the morrow after the sabbath the
[48:45] priest shall wave it so if the priest
[48:47] was the the sheaf wave was weighed the
[48:49] priest would go out into the field and
[48:51] he'd see all that all that week coming
[48:53] up and a lot of wheat had not come to
[48:54] maturity yet so he grabbed up the first
[48:56] little bundle of wheat that had come to
[48:58] maturity and he hold it up over his head
[49:00] and the bible says that he'd hold it up
[49:02] over his head on sunday on the day that
[49:04] christ rose from the grave on the day
[49:06] that that sheath wave was waved it
[49:09] actually
[49:10] the the way that the the the day that
[49:12] the sheep wave was proved that it was
[49:14] proven he and the priest would wave it
[49:17] up over the people and
[49:19] why did he do that he waved it to show
[49:22] standing there in that field of all the
[49:23] other wheat that was coming up to prove
[49:26] that there's more to come that there's
[49:28] more coming and he waved it he was he
[49:30] was the first from the dead and the
[49:31] first to maturity hey brother i said
[49:34] notice it was the first corn of god's
[49:35] wheat that had been raised from the dead
[49:37] god's first corn of wheat by god's
[49:40] quickening power but it showed that
[49:41] there was more to come if you can accept
[49:44] that same life that was in him will
[49:46] raise you up waving of the sheep what
[49:48] was the sheaf the first one that come to
[49:50] mature the first one that proved it was
[49:52] the wheat the first one that proved it
[49:55] was a wheat in other words you've got to
[49:57] be proven
[49:58] you've got to be proven how are you
[50:00] proven you got to stand like jesus did
[50:02] right before pilate and pilate looked
[50:04] him all over and he said i find i don't
[50:05] find the devil himself looked him all
[50:07] over and said i don't find no fault in
[50:09] you you got to go through trials and
[50:11] suffering and things in life to be
[50:13] proved out proved whether that faith
[50:15] that same life is dwelling inside of you
[50:18] and then what was he doing what what is
[50:19] that sheaf wave it was waving christ the
[50:22] word over the people that chief wave was
[50:24] raised as he rose it was waved on the
[50:27] day of pentecost brotherhood said as
[50:28] that rushing mighty wind waved over the
[50:31] people on the day of pentecost to prove
[50:33] that that life was coming back and it's
[50:35] got to be waved again in the last day to
[50:37] prove proof that the word is true that
[50:39] his power is real that there's more to
[50:42] come what is that chief wife it's the
[50:44] the word of god in this last day waved
[50:46] over the people and i believe that we've
[50:48] heard the word waved over us we've heard
[50:50] the gospel of daniel 70 weeks and the
[50:53] message of the son of man and the
[50:55] message of all these dispensations and
[50:57] the word the seals have been opened and
[50:59] we've heard a word waved over us and
[51:01] it's been waved of us to prove that
[51:03] there's more coming up more coming up to
[51:05] maturity
[51:07] he said the first time they will come
[51:08] forth for the bride age for resurrection
[51:11] out of dark denominationalism
[51:13] will be a message a message that the
[51:16] full maturity of the word has turned
[51:18] back again in its full power and being
[51:20] waved over the people by the same signs
[51:23] and wonders that he did back there we
[51:25] we've seen the message waved over the
[51:27] people as cops were brought up before
[51:29] brother branham and his ministry and it
[51:32] showed forth that the life was in the
[51:33] people again it's showing forth today in
[51:36] this very hour that all around the world
[51:38] people are being healed and saved
[51:40] because the same quickening power under
[51:42] the headship of this message that we've
[51:44] heard has the same effect that it did
[51:46] when jesus rose from the grave that's
[51:49] why brother brown said who is the who is
[51:51] the son of man and the day that the son
[51:53] of man will be revealed or waved again
[51:55] over the people in the beginning was the
[51:57] word and the word was with god and the
[51:59] word was god and the word was made flesh
[52:02] and dwelt among us he said if all the
[52:04] teaching that we have and confirmation
[52:06] of the word of god by word of god by
[52:09] signs by wonders we see today that in
[52:11] the book of luke here that we as we just
[52:13] quoted from and malachi 4 and the
[52:16] different scriptures that we are
[52:17] acquainted with that that word again is
[52:20] waved over the people the word again is
[52:22] waved over the people as the word is
[52:25] preached you see this message is the
[52:27] very proof of the resurrection this
[52:29] message is the proof that what he said
[52:32] it has an effect on your life the very
[52:35] effect that it has on your life is proof
[52:37] that christ is alive
[52:39] a resurrection out of dark
[52:40] denominationalism
[52:42] he said he was waved to them the word
[52:44] which he was was waived back to them on
[52:46] the day of pentecost the word made
[52:48] manifest
[52:50] wave to prove
[52:52] to prove
[52:53] the power of the risen christ is here
[52:57] and then he said well
[52:59] you say the power is in the gasoline
[53:00] brother
[53:02] but i don't care how much power is in
[53:04] the gasoline
[53:05] unless there's a spark there to manifest
[53:07] that power
[53:09] unless there's a power there to confirm
[53:11] that that's gasoline it just might as
[53:13] well be water
[53:15] you you see what he's saying
[53:18] we've got all the we've got the car
[53:20] built we got the all the the the son of
[53:22] man the doctrines we got daniel 70 weeks
[53:25] laying out there but something's got to
[53:28] bring it to life and actually make it
[53:30] live within us we've got we've got all
[53:32] the head knowledge maybe of the seven
[53:34] seals we've got the seven seals laying
[53:36] there before us and we can begin to kind
[53:38] of probe and understand with our ideas
[53:41] but something's got to make it rise to
[53:43] life so that it's not in symbol form
[53:46] anymore but it's actually a living
[53:47] reality the thing that has been
[53:49] prophesied of the thing that's been
[53:51] spoken of living out right before our
[53:53] very eyes you see that's what the son of
[53:55] man is the son of man is actually the
[53:57] word in flesh again quickened actually
[53:59] walking before you where you can see
[54:02] that same life in the flesh of the bride
[54:04] again the same life that was in christ
[54:06] that made him rise from the grave
[54:08] he said no matter how much theologians
[54:11] claim
[54:12] how well you got your church set how
[54:14] much education you got how much like the
[54:17] bible until that wave sheaf until the
[54:20] holy spirit comes upon that person to
[54:22] quicken that word the gasoline
[54:25] represents the word it's the truth but
[54:27] without the spirit it won't move
[54:31] now how do we get the spirit to move
[54:32] though
[54:33] if we can crack into that secret into
[54:35] the key of how to get the spirit to move
[54:37] and you see it's so simple
[54:39] so simple that's why you know brother
[54:41] brown kept going back as he would
[54:42] illustrate talking about talking about
[54:44] abel crawling up on that altar to be
[54:46] identified with his sacrifice crawling
[54:49] up on that altar what was he doing up on
[54:50] that altar he was dying out dying out to
[54:53] his old way of thinking dying out to
[54:55] himself
[54:56] ready to recognize that what christ what
[54:59] what the sacrifice had done was was
[55:01] enough ready to believe
[55:04] and if you'll if you'll do the same
[55:05] thing tonight if you'll just believe the
[55:07] word that has been spoken that's what we
[55:10] do that's what we comb through the
[55:11] message looking for little nuggets we're
[55:13] combing through looking for that little
[55:15] thing that will spark our faith looking
[55:17] for that little sentence that brother
[55:18] brown said looking further something
[55:20] that will spark us and give us faith to
[55:22] ignite it this uh
[55:24] if we'll die and humility and contrition
[55:27] and come as a little child that's why
[55:30] young people pushing back against your
[55:31] parents and believing that everyone but
[55:34] you is wrong and rejoicing in the
[55:36] weeping of others and doing all those
[55:38] kind of things if you'll humble yourself
[55:40] and come and contrition believing
[55:42] believing maybe
[55:44] that you didn't have it figured out to
[55:45] begin with
[55:49] if you want to go up you got to go down
[55:52] if you want to go up sometimes you got
[55:54] to admit that you're wrong if you want
[55:56] to go up sometimes you've got to admit
[55:57] maybe that you didn't have church
[55:59] figured out that you didn't have the new
[56:01] birth figured out that there's something
[56:04] maybe that's lacking in your life
[56:06] why don't you recognize
[56:08] why don't you recognize tonight that
[56:10] maybe your parents do love you
[56:12] why don't you recognize recognize that
[56:15] maybe the preacher's right and maybe
[56:16] that god does want to save you recognize
[56:19] it
[56:21] that's how the dynamics come
[56:23] the dynamics come because the mechanics
[56:25] have been laid out the mechanics is god
[56:27] loves you but you've got to accept it
[56:30] you've got to believe it and if you
[56:32] believe it then you'll see something new
[56:34] you'll see god come on the scene and
[56:36] prove his word to you if you can
[56:38] recognize tonight that there is a way
[56:41] back brother said we put too much stress
[56:43] on the mechanics
[56:45] and i'll put
[56:46] i'll say this
[56:47] i believe the mechanics is our own ideas
[56:50] sometimes it's our own church ideas
[56:53] it's laboring over what what the greek
[56:55] and the hebrew is and our opinions and
[56:57] traditions and and even wanting to be
[56:59] the authority wanting to be the one
[57:01] that's right if we'll lay that down and
[57:04] say maybe maybe god maybe i'm not the
[57:06] one that's right maybe your word is the
[57:08] one that's right maybe you're the one
[57:10] that knows what you're talking about
[57:12] maybe that ministry that that it seems
[57:14] like a lot of people poke at and don't
[57:16] like too much maybe he's got something
[57:18] that i need
[57:20] we put too much stress on the mechanics
[57:22] the mechanics is the word though
[57:25] the mechanics and brother brown explains
[57:27] it a little bit we'll we'll get to that
[57:28] brother
[57:29] he really nails it down we put too much
[57:31] stress on the mechanics and nothing on
[57:34] the dynamic
[57:38] if you begin to stress the dynamic in
[57:40] your life you'll come with humility
[57:41] saying oh god give me something coming
[57:44] in humility seeking after something
[57:47] coming probing through the word flipping
[57:48] the pages of your bible that's something
[57:50] that i need he said it needs the dynamic
[57:53] power of god the resurrection power of
[57:55] jesus christ upon the church to manifest
[57:57] and pray to bring that to pass that this
[58:00] is gasoline
[58:01] it might be in a gasoline can
[58:04] it could still be water seed but the
[58:05] only proof is
[58:07] the only proof of it is
[58:09] is the life
[58:10] the life on us
[58:12] in other words it's got to be proven
[58:13] that what you've held down in your heart
[58:15] is actually the is actually what you say
[58:17] it is it's got to be you say you got the
[58:19] new birth it's got to be proven you say
[58:22] you say you're living a christian life
[58:24] it's got to be proven and i'll say this
[58:26] when your kids are looking at you and
[58:28] you see you screaming to your spouse
[58:29] they're in the kitchen or whatever they
[58:31] know that something's wrong it's got to
[58:33] be proved out everybody knows whether
[58:36] it's proved out the devil knows whether
[58:38] it's right or not your kids know whether
[58:39] it's right or not your spouse knows
[58:41] whether it's right or not it's time to
[58:43] get serious and crave the dynamics to
[58:45] look for so look for the power of god in
[58:47] our life
[58:48] it might be all good that you know all
[58:50] the things about the message but i want
[58:51] to see christ live and we've got to
[58:54] prove we've got the wave shift to prove
[58:56] that there's more coming up that there's
[58:57] something available to you if you get
[59:00] serious about it
[59:02] in the message once more he said there's
[59:04] where satan got in to make it all
[59:06] mechanics and no dynamics back all
[59:08] dynamics and no mechanics see we got to
[59:10] put it together we've got the power of
[59:12] the holy spirit but we got to come back
[59:14] with a word
[59:15] you see you see what he's putting the
[59:16] emphasis on we got to come back with the
[59:19] word
[59:20] to feed this machine
[59:22] we can't feed it on creed
[59:24] it won't burn it it chokes up the flues
[59:27] and it will not burn it it was made for
[59:29] the word of god
[59:31] how do how do i let's lay this down how
[59:33] do i get a body change
[59:35] by the word of god
[59:36] how do i get the new birth
[59:38] by the word of god
[59:40] how am i changed by the word of god
[59:43] now to go from point a to point b
[59:45] there's a lot of things happening in
[59:46] there there's a lot of trials and
[59:49] struggles and tribulations and worrying
[59:51] about your kids and oh god what's going
[59:53] on right now in my life and problems at
[59:55] work and problems with your spouse and
[59:57] all that but it's the word of god the
[59:59] word of god is what's changing you
[1:00:01] there's a lot of things in there between
[1:00:02] point a and point b but it's the word of
[1:00:04] god he might take you down through the
[1:00:05] valley of the shadow of death like job
[1:00:07] but the word of god is going to change
[1:00:09] you nonetheless it's the word of god
[1:00:11] that's doing it and when you believe the
[1:00:13] word of god that has has been spoken to
[1:00:15] you the dynamics will come it's
[1:00:18] believing the word that brings the
[1:00:20] dynamics
[1:00:22] you see you see how satan does he'll get
[1:00:24] in amongst people and he'll begin to
[1:00:25] make you think that it's not the word
[1:00:27] that brings the dynamics that the
[1:00:29] dynamics comes some other way but it's
[1:00:31] the word of god that brings the dynamic
[1:00:33] power of god
[1:00:35] the problem the problem with why there's
[1:00:36] no dynamics many times is because when
[1:00:38] the word is being preached people get so
[1:00:40] cozy in their own their own ideas and
[1:00:43] they begin to fall asleep and they can
[1:00:44] begin to say well i don't want to hear
[1:00:46] what that preacher has to say or i don't
[1:00:48] i've already heard it before and they
[1:00:49] begin to get all cozy with their
[1:00:51] mechanics they get cozy and they begin
[1:00:53] to
[1:00:54] shower up maybe
[1:00:58] he said that's the easter message
[1:01:01] the dynamics and the mechanics together
[1:01:03] the the mechanics without the dynamics
[1:01:05] no good neither is the dynamics without
[1:01:07] the mechanics you can scream and shout
[1:01:10] and jump and up and down all you want to
[1:01:12] and deny this word it won't do you any
[1:01:14] good you're just cranking around the
[1:01:16] pistons
[1:01:18] that's why i
[1:01:19] i was talking to somebody the other day
[1:01:21] you cannot say that because somebody
[1:01:23] jumped up and down that they got
[1:01:24] something real
[1:01:26] it's a real holy ghost but you cannot
[1:01:28] say i know that stumbles people i know
[1:01:30] that might be stumbling to you here
[1:01:31] tonight but i'm going to preach it
[1:01:33] anyway because it's the truth you cannot
[1:01:35] look at somebody and say because they
[1:01:37] saw the pillar of fire or they had a
[1:01:39] good dream or they had supernatural
[1:01:42] things in their lives that they had a
[1:01:44] real experience i'm talking about down
[1:01:45] on the inside of your soul
[1:01:47] that that word that where's the word at
[1:01:50] if all you're looking for is some kind
[1:01:52] of a
[1:01:53] some kind of a supernatural sign without
[1:01:55] the word it's got to be the word first
[1:01:58] the word first and everything and
[1:02:00] brother emma said i i'm skipping ahead
[1:02:02] in my notes but he said the evidence to
[1:02:03] the whole thing if you've really been
[1:02:05] quickened down in your on your inside of
[1:02:08] your soul it will quicken you to the
[1:02:10] word it will quicken you to the word and
[1:02:13] you will hunger and thirst after the
[1:02:15] word because that's the thing that
[1:02:17] you're living by it's the word is the
[1:02:19] evidence the word because the word
[1:02:22] quickened is alive and the word the word
[1:02:24] the whole thing is about the word you're
[1:02:26] changed by the word you're matured by
[1:02:28] the word
[1:02:29] so
[1:02:30] maybe ask this question tonight do you
[1:02:32] realize
[1:02:34] do you realize what you got in your
[1:02:35] hands
[1:02:37] do you realize what this is
[1:02:40] this is the secret to your body change
[1:02:42] this is a secret to overcoming the world
[1:02:45] it's the secret to overcoming every lie
[1:02:47] of the devil it's the secret to
[1:02:49] conquering everything that the devil
[1:02:51] throws at you it's laying in your hand
[1:02:53] maybe laying on yourself it's laying
[1:02:55] here if we'll just accept it
[1:02:57] but i said i'm so glad that there is a
[1:02:59] 10 000 octane power the word of god
[1:03:03] and a holy ghost to light it up and to
[1:03:05] resurrect the power of god into a man's
[1:03:08] life or a woman's life or enter a church
[1:03:11] now i believe that i believe that there
[1:03:13] is a quickening power that can take the
[1:03:14] word believed and make it come alive in
[1:03:17] your life that will as you actually
[1:03:19] resurrect it in your life that same
[1:03:21] resurrection power will make it live
[1:03:24] that's what the gospel message is that
[1:03:26] christ is not dead but he's alive
[1:03:30] and you think about what we've been
[1:03:32] given this day the word has been poured
[1:03:34] out well we have we can see the whole
[1:03:37] thing the whole thing from cover to
[1:03:38] cover which is why brother graham said
[1:03:40] there's been churches churches brides
[1:03:42] brides churches brides brides
[1:03:45] but there's got to come one
[1:03:48] there has to come a real bride
[1:03:50] there must come one that's not only got
[1:03:52] the mechanics
[1:03:53] but the dynamics of it makes that church
[1:03:56] leave moving the power of his
[1:03:57] resurrection how how we're going to get
[1:03:59] there we've got the mechanics we've got
[1:04:02] all the capstone teaching we've got all
[1:04:05] this message that brother branham
[1:04:06] brought to us the seals have been opened
[1:04:08] up and it's been preached but if we'll
[1:04:10] believe it if we'll take it into our
[1:04:12] heart and believe that the things that
[1:04:14] have been spoken are not just some
[1:04:15] theology not just something to look at
[1:04:17] and marvel at and say wow look how much
[1:04:19] i know and look how much i know more
[1:04:21] than the other person and build
[1:04:23] ourselves up in our own mind but if
[1:04:25] we'll humble ourselves and just take
[1:04:27] god's word as it's been presented
[1:04:30] a bride with the full word that believes
[1:04:33] the word
[1:04:34] that god vindicates with his quickening
[1:04:36] spirit
[1:04:38] manifesting his fullness in flesh
[1:04:40] that's the son of man
[1:04:44] that's the son of man god back in flesh
[1:04:46] walking and talking and doing
[1:04:49] he said that's what he proved
[1:04:51] he wasn't only the word
[1:04:53] but he was god himself
[1:04:55] the dynamics in the word that made the
[1:04:58] body of jesus christ cold stiff and dead
[1:05:00] in the grave shaking the life and rise
[1:05:02] again and roll away the stone i am he
[1:05:04] that was dead
[1:05:06] so dead to the son said he was dead the
[1:05:08] moon said he was dead the star said he
[1:05:09] was dead all nature said he was dead
[1:05:12] and now the whole world has to recognize
[1:05:15] that he's alive again
[1:05:16] he's not only he was not only the
[1:05:18] mechanics god's word he was the dynamics
[1:05:20] to prove it why does the whole world
[1:05:22] have to recognize it because the whole
[1:05:24] world's got to recognize when they see
[1:05:26] christ moving at his bride
[1:05:28] to see signs and wonders done to see
[1:05:30] healings wrought to see god living again
[1:05:32] and
[1:05:33] preached in the power and demonstration
[1:05:34] of his spirit not just some theological
[1:05:37] theology of of what martin luther and
[1:05:39] john wesley preached with a little angry
[1:05:42] thing things that needed to be tidied up
[1:05:44] but the word and this power the word
[1:05:46] back in its fullness again
[1:05:49] the bible says these signs shall follow
[1:05:51] them that claim to have the mechanics
[1:05:53] this is what brother graham said
[1:05:54] the dynamics will take its place
[1:05:58] let me let me skip through my notes here
[1:06:00] a little bit to see
[1:06:03] so we can
[1:06:04] stay stay with the clock i hate i don't
[1:06:07] like the clock
[1:06:13] listen he said your temp your body is
[1:06:14] the temple of the dynamics
[1:06:16] why now he's going back to the seed for
[1:06:19] because from the beginning
[1:06:21] from the beginning you're part of the
[1:06:22] mechanics
[1:06:23] what what kind of mechanics you're part
[1:06:25] of the word
[1:06:26] you're part of in the beginning was the
[1:06:28] word and the word was with god and the
[1:06:29] word was god and you were part of that
[1:06:31] word way back in the beginning and part
[1:06:32] of that genesis 1 26 27 a man you're a
[1:06:35] part of that and now the word has been
[1:06:37] made manifest in flesh in your flesh
[1:06:40] by the word because the word believed
[1:06:42] will make the engine run
[1:06:44] the word believed is what makes the
[1:06:46] engine run and brother brown used that
[1:06:48] illustration you know you you come about
[1:06:50] on somebody on the side of the road and
[1:06:51] they're they they they their engines
[1:06:53] splutter and everything and and
[1:06:55] they're trying to maybe they're trying
[1:06:56] to start up their engine and if they put
[1:06:58] water in their engine all it does is
[1:07:00] just make it splutter
[1:07:02] he said the dynamics if it comes on
[1:07:04] water it'll just splutter somebody
[1:07:06] saying days of miracles is passed pump
[1:07:08] pump pump oh i believe the bible pump
[1:07:10] pump pump but when he hits that 1000
[1:07:12] octane where away she goes you see
[1:07:16] how my the dynamics will strike that
[1:07:19] you see what he's saying when you if
[1:07:21] you'll believe the word
[1:07:22] something will begin to happen
[1:07:24] and he said the dynamics with the
[1:07:26] mechanics that is if he is a true eagle
[1:07:28] now he will understand he'll begin to
[1:07:30] god will begin to reveal
[1:07:33] he'll begin to reveal his word to you
[1:07:36] he said watch it was the spiritual
[1:07:38] revealed word that did it
[1:07:40] that's the reason he told them to go
[1:07:42] baptize now
[1:07:45] y'all listen if you if you've been
[1:07:46] asleep for a second just wake up just
[1:07:48] for a moment
[1:07:49] because this is how the dynamics will
[1:07:51] come and brother brown he got to talking
[1:07:53] to this this man and he got to expect he
[1:07:55] was wondering how why do some people why
[1:07:56] do you baptize in the name of the lord
[1:07:58] jesus
[1:08:01] and he said
[1:08:02] he got to explaining to him
[1:08:04] about he said now if i told you brother
[1:08:06] to go over here and sign up for our
[1:08:08] dinner in the name of the governor of
[1:08:09] the state of arizona would you go sign
[1:08:12] it like that
[1:08:13] do you think they would receive it at
[1:08:14] the desk and now listen what up the
[1:08:16] point is
[1:08:17] he had the mechanics
[1:08:18] it was laying there between the pages of
[1:08:20] his bible and he saw what it said it
[1:08:22] said go and be baptized in the name of
[1:08:24] the father son and holy ghost in matthew
[1:08:25] 28 19. and in acts 2 38 it said then
[1:08:28] peter said unto them repent and be
[1:08:30] baptized to every one of you in the name
[1:08:31] of jesus for the remission of your sins
[1:08:33] and he had the mechanics there it was
[1:08:36] laying there and he he actually agreed
[1:08:38] that it was there
[1:08:39] he said now if i told you that would you
[1:08:41] go sign it like that do you think they
[1:08:42] would receive it at the desk why he said
[1:08:45] i guess not he said why did jesus say
[1:08:47] that and he explained he went on his
[1:08:49] explanation he said when he said father
[1:08:51] son and holy ghost he knowed how they
[1:08:52] was going to baptize he they know they
[1:08:55] knowed who he was
[1:08:57] my sheep hear my voice now he had the
[1:08:59] mechanics there laying there he had it
[1:09:01] all laid out and the brother said that
[1:09:03] he was talking to he said he said oh
[1:09:06] i see
[1:09:08] brother brown said he said oh i see
[1:09:10] in other words he's he's got the
[1:09:11] mechanics there and he's now he's
[1:09:13] agreeing with it he's agree
[1:09:15] but that ain't it yet
[1:09:17] not yet
[1:09:19] and brother brown said in that you go
[1:09:21] read it
[1:09:22] in and and it is the rising of the sun
[1:09:25] he said but now
[1:09:27] the next thing
[1:09:28] will you believe
[1:09:31] will you believe
[1:09:33] now you see how simple it is for the
[1:09:35] dynamics to come
[1:09:36] the word has been laid out but will you
[1:09:39] believe
[1:09:40] and he said see he that heareth my word
[1:09:42] and believeth on him that sent me has
[1:09:44] everlasting life he that heareth my word
[1:09:47] he that hears it and then believes it
[1:09:49] and continues on believing believes then
[1:09:53] you got eternal life not not maybe that
[1:09:55] moment when you say oh i see
[1:09:57] but you keep believing until god
[1:10:00] recognizes that you believe and that
[1:10:02] quickening power will come upon that
[1:10:04] word the mechanics that you've held the
[1:10:05] mechanics that you got lay in there and
[1:10:07] it will quicken it and bring it to life
[1:10:09] the next thing will you believe when
[1:10:12] you've received this holy spirit now
[1:10:13] that they did at pentecost
[1:10:15] they were the mechanics
[1:10:17] now the dynamics had to come and he said
[1:10:21] they had believed
[1:10:23] they had believed and when they believed
[1:10:25] that that made a way for the dynamic
[1:10:28] power of god to come into their life it
[1:10:30] opened up the gate for the for the holy
[1:10:32] ghost to come and quicken the word
[1:10:35] when god recognizes your faith you see
[1:10:37] the dynamics come that's why the bible
[1:10:39] said when the day of pentecost was fully
[1:10:41] come they were all with one accord in
[1:10:42] one place they all got in there and they
[1:10:45] began to meditate in one accord
[1:10:46] believing
[1:10:47] believing that something was going to
[1:10:50] happen
[1:10:52] believing
[1:10:53] if you can believe when you get the
[1:10:55] dynamics brother said you've been
[1:10:56] quickened from mortal to immortality it
[1:10:58] makes the whole body come subject to the
[1:11:01] word it'll make you act different look
[1:11:03] different live different it'll just make
[1:11:05] you different why
[1:11:07] because god recognized your faith that
[1:11:09] you believe the mechanics you believe
[1:11:11] the word that was laid out for you and
[1:11:12] it brought the dynamics
[1:11:14] what's the dynamics
[1:11:16] christ living in you
[1:11:20] i
[1:11:21] i almost feel like
[1:11:23] you see how simple it is how some
[1:11:26] complex sometimes we make it we make it
[1:11:28] we if i don't see the pillar of fire i
[1:11:30] don't know if we got the dynamics but if
[1:11:32] i can see christ living in his bride
[1:11:35] if i can see christ walking on two feet
[1:11:38] on your two feet i know to see god
[1:11:40] change somebody from the things of this
[1:11:42] world into somebody that he can use
[1:11:45] somebody that he can preach through to
[1:11:46] sing through be a deacon through
[1:11:48] minister through help through a little a
[1:11:51] little widow woman to help somebody with
[1:11:53] the words that come out of her mouth and
[1:11:55] the life that she lives like that woman
[1:11:57] that brother ram talked about
[1:11:59] cleaning her floor saying must jesus
[1:12:01] bear the cross bear the cross alone and
[1:12:03] her drunk husband come in and that
[1:12:05] quickening power that he observed there
[1:12:08] on the floor is what changed him he
[1:12:10] began to recognize that there was a life
[1:12:12] being lived in front of him
[1:12:15] what kind of life the same the same
[1:12:18] spirit that raised up jesus was in that
[1:12:20] little woman and the same spirit that
[1:12:23] raised up him is in you tonight if
[1:12:25] you've got the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:28] and what'll it do it'll take you right
[1:12:30] straight to the word because that's
[1:12:32] where you get all your nourishment from
[1:12:34] that's where you get all your strength
[1:12:35] from it's from the word he said how can
[1:12:37] you claim to have that spirit and throw
[1:12:39] yourself away from the word you're
[1:12:41] quickened by something else for it will
[1:12:44] quicken your mortal bodies to the word
[1:12:47] it'll make you love the word now these
[1:12:49] are my words it'll make you love the
[1:12:51] word it'll make you care about
[1:12:53] what you believe
[1:12:54] it'll make you care about it
[1:12:56] it'll make you want to live it
[1:12:58] why because you've been changed
[1:13:01] and brother brahma said
[1:13:03] just like a little seed coming up from
[1:13:04] the ground it's pushing up and and a
[1:13:07] seed drinks water and you've got to
[1:13:09] drink the word because you can only
[1:13:11] drink from one thing you pour oil down
[1:13:13] on that little seed one time it'll kill
[1:13:15] it you pour stagnated water or water
[1:13:17] that ain't no good it's contaminated
[1:13:19] it'll stunt the growth but you pull real
[1:13:21] good soft rain water
[1:13:23] it'll make it live
[1:13:25] which is why the bible says in isaiah
[1:13:28] incline your ear and come unto me here
[1:13:30] and your soul shall live in philippians
[1:13:32] holding forth the word of life
[1:13:35] the word is actually where you get your
[1:13:36] life from
[1:13:38] the word is what's going to change your
[1:13:40] body
[1:13:43] listen i know i'm fighting against
[1:13:45] something tonight because that's so hard
[1:13:47] for some people to argue against that
[1:13:50] it's so hard for you to come to grips
[1:13:52] that it's the word that will change you
[1:13:54] the word believed if you believe it it
[1:13:56] will change you you look around at your
[1:13:58] house maybe and you say well i don't see
[1:14:00] the effect it seems like i believe
[1:14:03] maybe you got the mechanics all piled up
[1:14:05] and you just need you just read you
[1:14:07] really need to take the book down and
[1:14:09] meditate on the word of god and get to
[1:14:10] believing
[1:14:11] because if you believe it the right way
[1:14:13] if you take the medicine the right way
[1:14:15] like brother said in the greatest battle
[1:14:16] ever fall it will have an effect if you
[1:14:19] take the medicine the way the doctor
[1:14:21] prescribed it and follow the follow the
[1:14:23] prescription it will do what it says
[1:14:26] john 5 25 says verily verily i say unto
[1:14:29] you the hour is coming and now is when
[1:14:31] the dead shall hear the voice of the god
[1:14:34] and they that hear shall live
[1:14:37] because his words are life his word is
[1:14:39] actually what will give you life
[1:14:44] my brother brown said see the dynamics
[1:14:45] come into the mechanics on the day of
[1:14:46] pentecost and he said some of you people
[1:14:49] that are afraid that some woman would
[1:14:50] laugh at you for having long hair or
[1:14:52] quit wearing makeup some of you man
[1:14:54] that's afraid your organization will
[1:14:55] throw you out when you baptize your
[1:14:57] congregation that scriptural baptism you
[1:14:59] need to close yourself in the upper room
[1:15:01] until the dynamics come
[1:15:03] what happens in that when you close
[1:15:04] yourself off
[1:15:06] you get to meditating on the word
[1:15:08] you get to believing something begins to
[1:15:10] take place your soul begins to elevate
[1:15:12] into another dimension into that
[1:15:13] dimension where all the world begins to
[1:15:15] fall away and you're you're able to
[1:15:17] believe
[1:15:18] when you close yourself
[1:15:20] in the upper room like they did on the
[1:15:22] day of pentecost
[1:15:23] and i i believe maybe that's some maybe
[1:15:26] tonight that's what we need some of is
[1:15:28] to close ourselves off away from the
[1:15:30] things of this world and get along with
[1:15:32] god so that we can see the dynamic power
[1:15:34] of god moving in our life
[1:15:36] listen some of you some of you may be
[1:15:38] that are afraid of what others think
[1:15:39] about you here tonight if you get along
[1:15:41] with god so that his dynamic power get
[1:15:43] along and begin to meditate on his word
[1:15:46] that god can change that
[1:15:48] when you're when you're afraid of taking
[1:15:50] correction when your mama and daddy tell
[1:15:52] you you need to be dressing this way you
[1:15:54] need to be clothing yourself instead of
[1:15:56] going out in the world naked showing
[1:15:58] yourself off to other men if you begin
[1:16:00] to realize that that's for your good not
[1:16:02] for your hate not for your hurt but your
[1:16:05] mama and your daddy want you one day to
[1:16:07] find a good man that will love you and
[1:16:09] raise you up in the admin to teach you
[1:16:11] the word and raise up children in the
[1:16:13] admonition of the lord
[1:16:15] the reason your mama and daddy are
[1:16:16] concerned about you is not for your hate
[1:16:20] listen someone maybe sometimes the older
[1:16:22] ones maybe they'll sweep secret sin up
[1:16:24] under the rug but if you get alone with
[1:16:26] god and let god take care of that he'll
[1:16:29] change you he'll change you so you're
[1:16:31] not ashamed to be identified with the
[1:16:33] gospel so you're not ashamed to walk
[1:16:35] behind your mama through the store or
[1:16:37] something because she's got long hair
[1:16:38] and a dress you're not ashamed to be
[1:16:40] identified with the gospel that's what
[1:16:42] the quickening power will do to you
[1:16:44] it'll make you it'll make you proud to
[1:16:47] say this is that this is that that was
[1:16:50] spoken of by the prophet joel it'll make
[1:16:52] you proud to be identified with the
[1:16:54] things that were spoken of it'll be
[1:16:56] proud to say i'm one of them i'm one of
[1:16:58] the one of that crazy group that just
[1:17:01] shouts and praises god and knows what
[1:17:03] they believe i'm one of them
[1:17:06] brother braham said when he was talking
[1:17:08] about it he said i'll show you what it
[1:17:10] is it's the scripture
[1:17:12] he said i've always said if this ain't
[1:17:13] that let me keep this till that come
[1:17:15] listen the quickening power will make
[1:17:17] you proud to say that you're a christian
[1:17:20] christian proud to be identified with
[1:17:22] that life that's come upon the word that
[1:17:24] you've believed
[1:17:26] he said what did it happen what happened
[1:17:27] on the day of pentecost he said it
[1:17:29] changed them it quickened them
[1:17:31] it made them different
[1:17:33] they were a changed people from the you
[1:17:36] see what effect it has on you it changes
[1:17:39] you
[1:17:40] it quickened them from an old life
[1:17:42] they absolutely faced martium and all
[1:17:45] those other things nailed the crosses no
[1:17:47] more cowards about them death had no
[1:17:49] victory over them at all
[1:17:51] the dynamics was in the mechanics
[1:17:53] yes sir it quickened their mortal body
[1:17:56] it's so quick in them and such what
[1:17:58] equipping their mortal body
[1:18:00] what's he talking about in this sermon
[1:18:03] he's building up your faith
[1:18:05] when you come to a place and i believe
[1:18:07] we've come to a place where we can
[1:18:08] believe that the seals have been open
[1:18:10] you come to a place where it's time for
[1:18:13] a body change
[1:18:14] you read these messages again and you'll
[1:18:16] find out he's talking about the thing
[1:18:18] that we need in this hour for our flesh
[1:18:21] to be changed that's why he's talking
[1:18:22] about it quick in their mortal body it
[1:18:25] changes your flesh and it will change
[1:18:27] your flesh your mortal body
[1:18:30] it's so quick in them
[1:18:32] they quicken their language
[1:18:35] what's he talking about he's talking
[1:18:36] about their flesh
[1:18:37] their tongue it quickened their tongue
[1:18:40] so that they were speaking different
[1:18:42] their thoughts were quickened it looked
[1:18:44] quick in your brain
[1:18:46] their spirits were quickened their life
[1:18:48] were quickened they were quickened all
[1:18:50] together they tried to talk and couldn't
[1:18:52] talk it anymore human language
[1:18:54] it'll make you do things you didn't do
[1:18:56] before
[1:18:58] because you're feasting at a fountain
[1:18:59] that the world know knows nothing
[1:19:02] about
[1:19:05] now listen he says the quickening power
[1:19:09] wasn't only in their soul
[1:19:11] it was all over them
[1:19:15] what's the stature of perfect man for
[1:19:17] to take what's in your soul
[1:19:19] and push it out push it out until all
[1:19:23] your flues are open up in your spirit
[1:19:25] push it out until you're believing the
[1:19:27] word of god
[1:19:28] push it out
[1:19:29] until it finally takes over your body
[1:19:33] pushing it out until
[1:19:35] it's all over you
[1:19:36] until like brother adam said in the
[1:19:38] statue of a perfect man you've been
[1:19:40] swallowed up
[1:19:41] swallowed up in christ that's what we're
[1:19:43] yearning for he said not only that
[1:19:46] the dynamics i can't talk not only the
[1:19:49] dynamics come in to quicken but it
[1:19:51] quickened the mechanics they were so
[1:19:53] quick until their tongues began to speak
[1:19:55] in another language they were so quick
[1:19:58] and it quickened your mortal body
[1:20:00] they were healed by laying on a hand
[1:20:03] now you think that you can quicken your
[1:20:05] mortal body so much that you can pass
[1:20:08] eternal life from one to another
[1:20:10] pat i'm talking about this the spirit
[1:20:12] the quickening spirit to heal somebody
[1:20:14] that someone can be healed because you
[1:20:16] touched them with your hand
[1:20:20] with your flesh
[1:20:21] they quickened their mortal body
[1:20:24] in their flesh
[1:20:25] resurrection from the dead brother said
[1:20:27] in the spirit quicken their fellowship
[1:20:29] together with god so they were also so
[1:20:31] quick and into the presence of god until
[1:20:32] when a person died and their soul had
[1:20:35] gone off it called him back to life
[1:20:38] again amen
[1:20:40] you see where brother graham is going in
[1:20:41] this message he's going up he's he's
[1:20:43] culminating i'm doing maybe a cliff
[1:20:45] notes tonight for you so when you go
[1:20:47] back and study this message maybe you'll
[1:20:49] read it different he's culminating with
[1:20:52] resurrection of the dead
[1:20:55] and changing your mortal body
[1:20:57] what happened on the day of pentecost is
[1:20:59] they saw the dead raised
[1:21:02] and their bodies were quickened
[1:21:04] and what is what the culmination of this
[1:21:06] message is you'll see the dead rise from
[1:21:08] the ground
[1:21:10] and your bodies will be changed first
[1:21:13] the dead in christ must rise and then we
[1:21:15] will be caught together with him to meet
[1:21:17] him in the air
[1:21:19] they laid hands on the sick they
[1:21:20] recovered they prayed and the spirit
[1:21:22] they saw vision call the dead back to
[1:21:25] life that's right quicken their mortal
[1:21:27] body the quickening power bringing the
[1:21:29] word the mind that was in christ was in
[1:21:32] you then when christ when god raised
[1:21:34] jesus from the dead he raised up you
[1:21:36] also
[1:21:37] and when a man has said that he believes
[1:21:39] the word and then when the holy spirit
[1:21:41] comes it is the abstract to the title
[1:21:44] and that gives you permission
[1:21:46] when you have that abstract that every
[1:21:48] bit of that belongs to you
[1:21:50] every bit of it
[1:21:51] and everything is on it belongs to you
[1:21:56] now enoch in the bible
[1:22:00] had a testimony
[1:22:02] and brother branham said his testimony
[1:22:05] was
[1:22:06] that i haven't failed i haven't one time
[1:22:09] failed his word
[1:22:11] you see what's going to change you it's
[1:22:13] his word
[1:22:14] enoch was walking in the word and then
[1:22:16] it was a type of you not the other way
[1:22:18] around enoch's typing you and you're
[1:22:21] going to take a body change the same way
[1:22:23] that enoch took a body changed
[1:22:26] and brother abraham said enoch got so
[1:22:27] full of quickening power when the
[1:22:29] dynamics hit him on the mechanics
[1:22:33] he didn't even have to die he just took
[1:22:35] him home
[1:22:37] he just started walking
[1:22:38] he just went i'm an old man anyhow
[1:22:41] i just got so much quickening power i'll
[1:22:44] just walk right out of the earth
[1:22:47] and brother brown said
[1:22:49] that's that same quickening power that
[1:22:52] we have right now
[1:22:54] see it will quicken your mortal body
[1:22:56] isn't that right it's the quickening
[1:22:58] power in it with that perfect testimony
[1:23:00] that everything god told me to do i did
[1:23:03] it everything that i seen he said for me
[1:23:05] do
[1:23:06] i done it
[1:23:08] everything now you you with your your
[1:23:10] walk
[1:23:11] you're going down to the water to be
[1:23:13] baptized
[1:23:14] the preacher of the pulpit said you need
[1:23:16] to be born again and and you went
[1:23:18] through the motions you've been born
[1:23:19] again the preacher of the pulpit
[1:23:21] preached the status of a perfect man to
[1:23:22] you and you've climbed and you've
[1:23:24] struggled and you've you've gone through
[1:23:26] all your life like like an ox laboring
[1:23:28] burdening going to climbing and climbing
[1:23:30] until you come and you can have that
[1:23:32] same testimony that anik did everything
[1:23:35] god told me to do
[1:23:37] i did it
[1:23:39] that's what will bring you confidence in
[1:23:41] the confidence when you're facing the
[1:23:43] hour of death and you say you say like
[1:23:45] job i know in my flesh that i will see i
[1:23:48] will see god because everything god told
[1:23:50] me to do i did it
[1:23:52] everything that i've seen he said for me
[1:23:54] to do i've done it
[1:23:55] and he said he becomes so full of
[1:23:57] mechanics until when the quickening
[1:23:59] power struck him the mechanics he just
[1:24:01] lifted him right up
[1:24:03] he walked on out of the earth into
[1:24:05] heaven
[1:24:06] you see how you do it
[1:24:08] you believe god's word
[1:24:10] and god's word is what will carry you
[1:24:13] elijah got so full of the quickening
[1:24:15] power until he seen a chariot hooked
[1:24:16] over there some horses of fire and
[1:24:18] chariots of fire hooked to some tree
[1:24:20] over there he just walked across the
[1:24:21] river and went home
[1:24:23] without even dying now hold that in your
[1:24:26] mind for a second elijah didn't die
[1:24:28] now moses moses is full of that
[1:24:31] quickening power was the brother of them
[1:24:32] said he was a prophet who the word came
[1:24:34] to and i'm i'm closing here in a minute
[1:24:36] i'm i'm winding up
[1:24:38] he was part of the word he was the word
[1:24:41] of that day is that right and after he
[1:24:42] was dead 800 years
[1:24:46] there he stood again peter james and
[1:24:48] john went up to the top of mount
[1:24:50] transfiguration and they saw elijah who
[1:24:53] never died
[1:24:55] but went up in a fiery chariot
[1:24:57] and moses
[1:24:59] who died
[1:25:00] but there he was
[1:25:02] why because that same quickening power
[1:25:04] brought him back that same quickening
[1:25:06] power had him standing up there between
[1:25:08] on another either side of jesus there on
[1:25:10] mount transfiguration what kind of
[1:25:13] quickening power the same quickening
[1:25:14] power that when elisha was dead in the
[1:25:16] ground his bones had so much quickening
[1:25:19] power when when they touched another
[1:25:21] dead man it brought into life that's the
[1:25:23] kind of quickening power we're talking
[1:25:25] here tonight
[1:25:27] there was that scene on the mount
[1:25:28] transfiguration when jesus was standing
[1:25:30] there in the middle and a voice spoke
[1:25:32] from heaven this is my beloved son hear
[1:25:34] ye him hear him and on either side of
[1:25:37] him was in type a type of the ones that
[1:25:40] had that quickening power that had died
[1:25:44] and the ones that had not died
[1:25:47] but had that quickening power and were
[1:25:48] called away that quickening power is
[1:25:50] going to bring the dead saints from the
[1:25:52] ground that quickening power is going to
[1:25:55] change somebody's body so you'll never
[1:25:58] have to taste death that quickly power
[1:26:00] that quickening power is sufficient to
[1:26:02] raise the dead saints from the ground
[1:26:04] and how are they going to raise from the
[1:26:06] ground because the word will be
[1:26:08] manifested in the life of the son of man
[1:26:11] revealed again in his bride and they
[1:26:13] will have to come from the ground
[1:26:15] because that is the resurrection sign
[1:26:18] the son of man is the resurrection
[1:26:20] that's the resurrection power is god's
[1:26:23] life man manifesting flesh again by that
[1:26:27] quickening power quickening the word
[1:26:28] that you've heard the word that you've
[1:26:30] you've heard all these years that you've
[1:26:33] held in your heart that you received the
[1:26:35] quickening power in your life to make it
[1:26:37] live
[1:26:39] that's what'll do it
[1:26:41] now the musicians go ahead and come
[1:26:42] brother said look at transfiguration we
[1:26:45] was everyone
[1:26:46] represented there
[1:26:48] there was the living saints that had
[1:26:50] raptured
[1:26:51] there was elijah standing there
[1:26:53] there stood moses the dead saints
[1:26:55] whether one died
[1:26:58] and the other didn't die
[1:27:00] they're all there
[1:27:02] he said we're just like them amen at
[1:27:05] mount transfiguration
[1:27:07] see
[1:27:08] let's stand to our feet and just worship
[1:27:10] the lord
[1:27:11] i believe we've got the secret to a body
[1:27:13] change the secret was revealed it was
[1:27:16] opened up as when christ rose from the
[1:27:19] grave and now the seals have opened up
[1:27:22] everything that we have lead to take a
[1:27:24] body change to raise the dead saints
[1:27:27] from the ground to see them come forth
[1:27:29] again can you imagine all of our dead
[1:27:31] loved ones that have gone on to maybe
[1:27:33] one day be needing bread in the kitchen
[1:27:36] or whatever and see see brother marlo

[1:27:44] and see him come maybe won't come
[1:27:46] walking down the aisles of the church
[1:27:47] one morning it's that quickening power
[1:27:50] that'll do it
[1:27:53] i believe that same quickening power is
[1:27:55] here tonight if you have need of
[1:27:57] something to set your heart set your
[1:28:00] mind on christ
[1:28:01] don't just leave the mechanics sitting
[1:28:03] up there on the shelf don't it's time to
[1:28:05] polish it off and
[1:28:07] get our heart my mind set on believing
[1:28:09] it and you'll see god do something
[1:28:12] just believe him
[1:28:14] let's sing something

[1:29:39] there's an answer to that fear just give
[1:29:41] yourself over to him tonight and then
[1:29:44] one day
