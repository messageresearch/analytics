[3:20] have sister Trudy and sister Nala back
[3:23] with us so they made it back to the
[3:25] States and you know we we thought maybe
[3:29] you might might get over there and try
[3:31] to decide to stay over there or
[3:33] something so it's back to the States
[3:35] we're glad to have you that all
[3:37] announcements I it's must always miss
[3:41] something all right Hebrews
[3:45] 111 Heavenly Father we thank you for the
[3:48] day and the hour thank you Lord that you
[3:52] would choose us that you
[3:56] would draw a bunch of people together
[4:00] and that you'd get us into a place to
[4:02] where we can hear Thy
[4:03] word we ask you to just come on the
[4:06] scene now and make that manifest in our
[4:08] hearts and lives we've heard tonight
[4:11] many testimonies about your your what
[4:15] you've done Among Us father we pray that
[4:18] it will bring Faith to a place that we
[4:21] can just walk off this Earth because
[4:22] that's our desire in in you is to just
[4:26] have your faith in Lord because we know
[4:30] that it's all in you come on the scene
[4:32] tonight and speak to our hearts and you
[4:33] be the answer to the questions and
[4:35] thoughts and comments and let your
[4:37] loving grace be with us thank you for
[4:40] the things that you've done Among Us Now
[4:42] come and make your man self manifest as
[4:45] we go on into Thy Word in Jesus name
[4:50] amen okay
[4:52] Hebrews
[4:55] 11 now Faith is the substance of things
[4:57] hoped for the evidence of things not
[4:59] seen for by it the elders obtained a
[5:02] good report through faith we understand
[5:04] that the worlds were framed by the word
[5:06] of God so that things which are seen
[5:09] were not made of things which do appear
[5:12] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[5:15] excellent sacrificed and Cain by which
[5:17] he obtained witness that he was
[5:19] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[5:22] and by it he being dead yet speaketh by
[5:26] faith Enoch was translated that he
[5:27] should not see death and was was not
[5:30] found because God had translated him or
[5:32] before before his translation he had
[5:35] this testimony that he pleased God but
[5:38] without faith it is impossible to please
[5:41] him now think about that without
[5:46] faith now and what have we been talking
[5:48] about all of this time about
[5:51] faith all right not just a belief or a
[5:55] thought or a concept or a Doctrine
[6:00] it doesn't say that it doesn't say you
[6:01] can know God by those things but without
[6:04] faith it is impossible to please
[6:08] him we'll get back to these later in
[6:10] another message or so for he that cometh
[6:13] to God must believe that he is and that
[6:16] he is a rewarder of them that diligently
[6:19] seek Him you may be seated the Lord add
[6:21] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[6:23] now I didn't give them any notes to
[6:26] quotes to pull up just some things that
[6:28] we I have here to where keep kind of a
[6:31] thought together in
[6:32] mind because I just want to speak for a
[6:34] little bit and then uh you know then
[6:37] we'll turn it over to you for the
[6:40] questions and comments and and things
[6:42] and we pray that you will speak out and
[6:46] don't worry about uh you know some
[6:48] people have always said like this well I
[6:50] don't know how to ask a
[6:53] question well I don't either so we're
[6:56] both in the same shape um you know you
[7:00] say but my questions are silly you know
[7:02] or foolish or childish or well if you
[7:06] got one you'll keep it until you get rid
[7:09] of it so you might as
[7:11] well get it out in front and get rid of
[7:14] it because there's going to be a
[7:16] hindrance until you do that if you got a
[7:19] question it'll always be there I don't
[7:21] care what you do it'll keep coming back
[7:23] up all right but we've been talking
[7:25] about
[7:27] faith faith
[7:31] and found that it's not a myth or a
[7:33] thought or an
[7:35] idea because the word faith there runs
[7:38] to just believing or belief or doctrine
[7:42] or idea or concept but it doesn't lead
[7:45] us to where that we can see what it's
[7:47] really saying faith
[7:50] is the
[7:53] substance of things that you're asking
[7:58] for right
[8:00] now we were speaking a little bit down
[8:02] at brother Joe's the other night and U
[8:05] you know some points about
[8:08] faith and
[8:10] uh see we we think that we don't have
[8:13] any faith in brother brandham he says he
[8:16] said that's where our trouble is he said
[8:18] it's it's
[8:20] simple he said it's symbolic back there
[8:23] in the Old Testament of the little weed
[8:25] that grows and says it just grows
[8:28] everywhere and say
[8:29] they took that and applied the blood
[8:31] with it he you know and uh he said it's
[8:37] a common
[8:39] thing we see we have
[8:42] faith but we've let hindrances come in
[8:46] our way to hinder us to be able to uh
[8:51] exercise
[8:52] it uh to put it into action to uh you
[8:56] know to let God make it manifest but it
[9:01] was like I was saying in the message the
[9:03] other day if there's more people to come
[9:06] into the body of
[9:08] Christ you know all right more people to
[9:11] be saved come into the body of Christ
[9:13] then God's not through
[9:16] creating
[9:18] right and see he can't be through
[9:21] creating because I believe that you and
[9:25] I somebody will take the word in the
[9:28] last days and
[9:30] speak it a glorified body into
[9:35] existence ever how you want to say it or
[9:38] speak us into eternity whatever because
[9:41] we have to speak for healing we have to
[9:44] say by Stripes I'm Healed now do you
[9:46] really think about
[9:49] that you know think about
[9:52] that you don't have your healing you
[9:55] know you're
[9:58] sick and
[10:00] for it to come into being you must speak
[10:04] it
[10:06] right and are you with me you must speak
[10:09] that
[10:10] healing we see then people say well I
[10:13] don't know where I'll ever be able to
[10:14] come to speak the word well if you ever
[10:17] spoke your healing into existence the
[10:20] healing can't come until you speak
[10:22] it salvation can't come until you speak
[10:28] it
[10:30] well why you know why are we so hindered
[10:32] upon and looking at Faith well I just
[10:35] don't have any faith I just you're
[10:39] here why are you not somewhere
[10:42] else why are you not out in the world
[10:45] and all of the
[10:48] things for some reason you know why
[10:53] don't you put that on the basis of
[10:56] saying well you
[10:57] know we've been speaking the word a long
[11:02] time because we're talking with Brother
[11:05] Gary this morning about
[11:06] it so I believe we must exercise our
[11:11] faith you
[11:14] know I
[11:15] mean you go down to the gym and you walk
[11:18] in you know and you grab a 400 lb
[11:20] barbell and you stick it up over your
[11:23] head and do it about 10 times and lay it
[11:24] down and walk
[11:26] out i' never heard of that happening
[11:30] unless somebody's been working out a
[11:32] whole lot somewhere else you know in a
[11:34] way you know what I'm talking about see
[11:37] it just don't work that way you got to
[11:40] exercise your muscles or they they'll
[11:43] start
[11:44] deteriorating put your arm in a sling
[11:47] leave it there for a couple two or three
[11:48] weeks you have no
[11:50] strength see all right see then it's not
[11:53] to have to go out well I'm going to
[11:55] exercise my faith I'm going to go out
[11:56] and speak this don't that's not that's
[11:59] not what I'm talking about I'm simply
[12:01] talking about just living a daily life
[12:04] being a Christian walking in life and
[12:07] just you know and then when something
[12:10] comes up you say well Lord by his
[12:14] stripes I am
[12:17] healed well now he's waiting on you to
[12:19] say
[12:28] that well is there any difference in you
[12:32] saying by his stripes I'm
[12:39] Healed are you calling flies fleas and
[12:41] frogs into
[12:48] existence that's Brother D now that's
[12:51] just that's just going a little bit too
[12:52] far no it ain't going far
[12:56] enough
[12:58] right did we talk about
[13:00] faith but it's so
[13:03] simple until we pass over it trying to
[13:07] find
[13:09] it and it's kind of like I always
[13:11] illustrate where you're talking about
[13:12] the you know uh the stone that you can't
[13:15] find you got a football field and ain't
[13:17] hardly a Grace PR of Grace in it there's
[13:20] one rock laying in the middle and you're
[13:22] out there for hours trying to
[13:25] find and then you stumble over it you
[13:29] stumble at The Stumbling
[13:31] Stone the thing you're looking for and
[13:33] the only one they are
[13:37] there you know you say well that's silly
[13:40] I agree with you that's how silly we
[13:42] are because we're trying to make things
[13:46] be something that they're
[13:49] not well the spoken word was only for
[13:52] brother brandom and the Lord Jesus now I
[13:56] want the scriptures and I want you know
[13:59] the prophet's message for
[14:02] that well if I can't find it then every
[14:05] who said that's a
[14:08] liar is that blunt
[14:11] enough shouldn't be any problem should
[14:14] it all right but you see we don't think
[14:17] about the things that have actually went
[14:20] on in our
[14:22] lives down through our
[14:26] lives and the Lord leading us and
[14:29] guiding us moving us from here to there
[14:32] or something bringing us from other
[14:36] churches to
[14:38] Lula you
[14:41] know bring this from other states to
[14:46] Georgia but yet we don't think
[14:48] that we don't connect that to the
[14:51] Christian
[14:53] Life why
[14:56] not do you do you follow me
[15:00] I mean had it ever really doned on
[15:03] you for you to be healed you got to say
[15:09] it because God can't make it manifest
[15:12] unless you say
[15:13] it all
[15:15] right sister Gil you mean you've been
[15:19] speaking the word about your healing and
[15:21] you sure I'd love to speak the word one
[15:23] day wouldn't you would you love to speak
[15:24] the word one day and there all your life
[15:26] you've been doing it
[15:29] you spoke it for your
[15:35] salvation come
[15:37] on you got believe in your heart confess
[15:41] with your
[15:43] mouth you mean you spoke your own
[15:46] salvation into being
[15:51] yes but just keep
[15:54] practicing you know
[15:57] what now that doesn't mean I've got to
[16:00] go out every day well I'm going to go
[16:02] try it I'm going to go try it Lord I
[16:04] speak a squirrel into existence see you
[16:06] getting Plum
[16:09] silly what if Satan comes along and
[16:12] brings an illusion into your mind and
[16:14] you wind up with things and you really
[16:16] got a
[16:19] problem if you need a squirrel you speak
[16:22] a
[16:24] squirrel
[16:26] right what you have need of
[16:30] my car is not running too good Lord
[16:33] would you make it to where that I can
[16:35] get to the service
[16:38] station you
[16:40] know I'm running low on fuel would you
[16:43] make it to where that I can just get to
[16:45] the
[16:48] place but brother Dale that's not
[16:51] speaking the
[16:53] word now I'll give you the pull pit for
[16:55] you to explain it you just made your own
[16:59] comments in your mind or wherever you
[17:00] made it come on the pull Pit's open
[17:03] explain to me any other
[17:05] way cuz you're going to come right back
[17:08] and face one thing you can't be healed
[17:11] until you say
[17:12] it you can't be saved until you say
[17:19] it well I never thought of it like that
[17:21] well that's what I'm here
[17:24] for is to make you
[17:26] think you know
[17:29] just to try to get you to think is my
[17:32] job I'll just try to do the best I can
[17:35] if I hurt your feelings doing it I'm
[17:38] sorry but you see we're looking for some
[17:41] great miraculous I have never spoke the
[17:47] word and I just gave you two
[17:50] illustrations that is
[17:52] in if you're a born again Christian it's
[17:54] got to be in your experience that you
[17:57] spoke the word
[18:00] yeah but that just leaves it for
[18:03] everybody it is for
[18:08] everybody the prophet when he was
[18:10] quoting those scriptures there where it
[18:12] says when you spay to this mountain be
[18:14] moved he said that's for
[18:22] anybody it says if you
[18:27] say doesn't say got to be a prophet
[18:29] priest king preacher
[18:32] whatever or a prophet's child or
[18:34] whatever you want to
[18:37] be when are we going to get to the basis
[18:39] that we're going to start
[18:42] believing that we are his
[18:45] offspring and we have been speaking the
[18:48] word ever since we started into the
[18:51] kingdom of
[18:56] God come on
[19:01] may I quote the
[19:02] prophet he said if you don't have enough
[19:10] Faith to speak about your
[19:14] children he said then I doubt if you
[19:16] have any faith for your own
[19:19] salvation now how you like that
[19:22] one is that what he say
[19:27] it well then why don't we speak the word
[19:30] and go
[19:31] forward you know just move on just move
[19:35] on with the Lord and just whatever comes
[19:38] in our way just walk right
[19:41] on and don't be afraid of the devil
[19:44] coming with
[19:46] some thing to put him in front of
[19:48] remember he's a bluff
[19:49] anyway he can't do anything to you until
[19:52] God allows
[19:54] him and that's for a trial and a test
[19:56] for our benefit
[20:01] well brother D you know understand I
[20:03] just like to be able to speak the word
[20:06] okay you'll get one day what I'm talking
[20:10] about you'll see what I'm trying my best
[20:13] to bring into manifestation brother Dell
[20:16] are you trying to get us to speak the
[20:18] word I'm trying to get us to see we have
[20:21] been speaking the word a long time let's
[20:23] just keep on and I don't like the word
[20:26] practice but that's the best word I got
[20:32] because practice makes
[20:35] perfect cuz I've not been a fanatical to
[20:38] go out and speak something into
[20:42] existence you
[20:45] know I'm not talking about going out and
[20:48] doing things I'm talking about just
[20:50] letting what's in you take over and for
[20:54] whatever needs you
[20:57] have
[21:01] I've been pointing to that for a long
[21:03] long time about 40 something
[21:07] years to get you and I to
[21:11] realize what we
[21:14] have in our possession by having the New
[21:22] Birth the position that puts us in by
[21:26] having the new birth
[21:31] CU what do we found
[21:33] out that only
[21:36] Christians have that six
[21:41] sense all
[21:43] right only Christians have that six
[21:49] sense but you see that's where then I
[21:51] have to you know that's my part I reckon
[21:54] in doing it I have to break down things
[21:57] for us to comprehend
[21:59] because that leaves a blank spot in your
[22:02] mind when you say that only Believers
[22:05] has a six
[22:06] sense and then you know somebody did
[22:09] speak the
[22:11] word you know like I was bringing out
[22:15] Sunday you say well can a sinner speak
[22:18] the word he has to speak his own
[22:22] salvation he has to speak his own
[22:26] healing it's not what somebody somebody
[22:28] else speaks for
[22:30] him
[22:32] right but we know and for sure those Old
[22:36] Testament Saints didn't
[22:38] have the six sense into being like it is
[22:42] in the New Testament all right it was
[22:46] there
[22:49] working we read you and talk to about it
[22:51] where Moses brother R said had that six
[22:57] sense
[22:59] but it wasn't a birth in his
[23:02] life but it was a connection to his soul
[23:06] his inward
[23:07] being that he believed
[23:11] God you remember we gave it to you where
[23:14] the deciples didn't have perfect
[23:18] Faith right message perfect faith
[23:20] brother R said they didn't have perfect
[23:23] Faith he said they had Jesus with them
[23:27] as long as Jesus was with them that
[23:29] perfect Faith couldn't be in
[23:33] them right the little woman she had
[23:37] faith for the time for her blood issue
[23:39] and it
[23:42] stopped but she didn't have the new
[23:48] birth and brother R I gave it to you the
[23:50] other day on the maniac of gatera where
[23:53] he
[23:55] said let me just read that one
[24:00] Adam had the Holy Ghost
[24:03] potentially that's right all the
[24:06] prophets as they was moved by the Holy
[24:09] Ghost but the St John said that the Holy
[24:14] Ghost had not yet come for Jesus was not
[24:18] yet been
[24:20] glorified that's John
[24:25] 7:39 Jesus was not yet glorified so the
[24:29] Holy Ghost could not be given to give a
[24:31] new birth that was the kingdom Jesus
[24:33] kept speaking of that they couldn't
[24:35] understand that was what Nicodemus
[24:37] couldn't
[24:38] understand that he needed to be born
[24:40] again amen he had a pretty good sense of
[24:45] Faith he got to the
[24:48] master right he
[24:51] confessed that we believe that no man
[24:54] can do the things you're doing L God be
[24:55] with
[24:57] you a lot of them made those positive
[25:02] statements coming from their inner
[25:06] being but they didn't have a new birth
[25:09] back
[25:10] there all right they didn't have the
[25:13] Life of Christ because Jesus had not
[25:15] been
[25:17] glorified see then the least in the
[25:20] Kingdom according to Matthew 11:11 or
[25:24] 11:13 the least in the kingdom is
[25:27] greater than John the B
[25:30] Baptist no would it say it like
[25:34] that he said it like that because it was
[25:38] true cuz even though John had the holy
[25:41] ghost from his mother's
[25:43] womb he never had the baptism of the
[25:46] Holy Ghost in the way or form that it
[25:49] was brought on the day of
[25:52] Pentecost he wasn't in the
[25:55] Kingdom he was a messenger of the
[25:57] Kingdom
[26:00] but why can't we believe that but to
[26:02] realize then the great thing that God
[26:05] has done because he's given
[26:07] us a super
[26:13] sense he's given to every Born Again
[26:16] believer a super sense that belongs the
[26:19] prophet said to that believer
[26:24] only doesn't belong to
[26:27] everybody
[26:29] but everybody don't have the new
[26:32] birth all
[26:34] right but it belongs to every believer
[26:37] he said the only class of people that
[26:40] has the six sense is a born again
[26:45] believer he said well you just said
[26:48] Moses had Moses had it under a potential
[26:53] form come on can I quote the prophet he
[26:58] said said if we believe under the blood
[26:59] of bulls and
[27:01] goats that a man could speak flies fleas
[27:03] and frog he said what about under the
[27:05] blood of Jesus Christ he made a
[27:08] difference between That Old Testament
[27:10] person and the New Testament
[27:12] person
[27:14] right but see that's that seems to be
[27:17] the hardest thing to do but I knew that
[27:19] when I was in the Baptist Church cuz I
[27:21] could
[27:26] read I could read and
[27:29] realize the least in the
[27:32] Kingdom a newborn
[27:35] believer is greater in the way God
[27:38] wanted it to be than even John the
[27:46] Baptist why can't we believe that and
[27:49] have faith in
[27:52] that come on church I
[27:56] mean you remember we gave the quotes
[27:59] where that you're controlled by the six
[28:02] sense and gave out it it was the armor
[28:04] of
[28:06] God you know the armor the the thing we
[28:08] put on the love joy peace goodness
[28:12] meekness long the stature of a perfect
[28:18] man but when are we going to start
[28:20] believing that we have
[28:24] it instead of believing that one day
[28:26] maybe we will
[28:32] you remember when I started the series I
[28:34] said those in the Bible that ever had
[28:39] a manifestation of things with people
[28:43] that had a positive
[28:49] attitude that's all I'm trying to get
[28:51] you and I to
[28:54] have and would that be wrong to have a
[28:57] positive
[29:00] attitude and brother Gary's daddy said
[29:03] they told him the first day in medical
[29:05] school that if you don't hinder your
[29:07] patience they'll get
[29:13] better like I've always said you go into
[29:15] the doctor and he says you got this
[29:16] disease he said we got a appeel for it
[29:19] but he said we've tried it now on a
[29:21] thousand cases and only one
[29:26] lived and that's it's not too good of a
[29:30] of a bat and average as we call it right
[29:34] but if they say we seen here that 80% of
[29:38] the people who take this
[29:41] medication get over the
[29:44] situation what are they
[29:47] doing building up your
[29:50] confidence building your faith your
[29:56] belief well see I thought then God
[29:59] revealing his word to
[30:05] us God revealing his word to us is what
[30:09] stimulates our
[30:11] faith because what did we find faith is
[30:15] a
[30:16] revelation Revelation is the word of
[30:20] God revealed to
[30:26] you
[30:29] and see then in that when I see
[30:31] something that that comes
[30:34] alive out of the Bible to
[30:37] me the that builds my
[30:44] confidence because I know and realize
[30:46] he's given it to me for
[30:51] that you Brothers was in service you
[30:53] didn't go out the first day and they say
[30:56] there's a wall you're going to get get
[30:58] over
[31:01] it no they started out doing a few
[31:05] push-ups and few pull-ups and a few
[31:07] little Runnings and you know and then
[31:10] right a while you run back by the wall
[31:12] and and you see the guys that's are
[31:14] ahead of you and their their their
[31:17] training and all you know that you watch
[31:19] them and you see them they they just
[31:21] over the
[31:22] wall ain't ready
[31:25] yet exercising
[31:30] what are you talking about brother Dale
[31:31] how do we exercise Faith by reading the
[31:33] word of
[31:36] God right by studying the word of
[31:41] God by listening to tapes and praying
[31:47] and
[31:50] right no that just going into our mental
[31:52] part well it's got to be in there before
[31:56] it can be revealed
[31:59] all
[32:01] right see then faith is a revelation and
[32:04] it belongs to only one class that six
[32:07] sense Belongs to Only One class and it
[32:11] is what controls
[32:15] you because you cannot have that six
[32:18] sense until you're born again I'm just
[32:20] looking down the page if you want me to
[32:22] give you the par paragraph number that
[32:23] was paragraph 53 super
[32:26] sign I got 57 50-59 of the super sense
[32:31] brother BR talking about the the super
[32:33] sense being the Holy Ghost and he says
[32:36] the devil can't touch that sick
[32:44] sense he can't touch
[32:48] it if he touched it he'd get born
[32:51] again is that
[32:56] sensible we're going to we to get into
[32:59] and I'm getting ready to turn it over to
[33:00] you for question and I we're going to
[33:03] get into these so read the the Hebrews
[33:05] 11th chapter and think of these that it
[33:08] says by faith Enoch by faith Noah by
[33:11] faith and we we just try to take maybe
[33:14] one at a time or whatever we want to run
[33:17] through and uh just speak about
[33:20] it but just remember the
[33:24] basis remember the basis of what we were
[33:27] talking about in Hebrews
[33:30] 10:38 Paul is explaining that the just
[33:34] shall live by
[33:36] faith all
[33:40] right and then 111 he tells you what
[33:43] faith
[33:45] is if you took the definition
[33:48] remember of Hebrews 10:38 took the
[33:52] definition of faith or even in 11 one to
[33:55] take the definition of faith and you
[33:57] find out it's a
[33:59] belief a Doctrine a thought a concept or
[34:03] something you know an
[34:07] assurance and God knew that's where we
[34:09] would
[34:12] be so he told us
[34:19] himself see Paul was was looking at it
[34:22] the just shall live by faith but those
[34:24] that turn back and those you remember
[34:26] coming down you remember 38
[34:28] 39 of the 10th chapter but then he stops
[34:32] and he
[34:34] says faith is the
[34:39] substance things hope for the evidence
[34:42] of Things Not
[34:46] Seen then he starts and he's defining
[34:49] what happened with the people who have
[34:53] that
[34:56] faith
[34:58] but he concludes that in the
[35:03] end and he says but they without us
[35:06] cannot be made
[35:12] perfect you know my understanding of
[35:16] that maybe
[35:17] is carnal I guess
[35:20] but
[35:22] uh if I was falling off of a
[35:26] cliff and on to a
[35:31] rope
[35:33] uh I wouldn't want Jonas to be expected
[35:36] to pull me back
[35:38] up he
[35:42] try you
[35:44] know but I'd want somebody a little
[35:47] stronger would
[35:49] you and as I said about the service I
[35:52] thought what they done was is they
[35:54] trained you upwardly until the body
[35:58] begins to
[35:59] develop to the point that it can stand
[36:02] the
[36:03] pressure and then they'll put more test
[36:06] in front of
[36:08] you and a lot of them you failed I'm
[36:11] sure but you know after a while you got
[36:15] where you could get over the
[36:18] hurdle
[36:21] right but one day you graduated well see
[36:25] this is the only graduation we're going
[36:26] to have in this to me is when these old
[36:29] bodies are changed then we'll graduate
[36:32] out of this situation you know because
[36:34] it's a never ending
[36:37] thing
[36:39] Faith the six
[36:43] sense the word of God being
[36:48] revealed whatever you have need
[36:55] of you should say it
[37:01] well now I remember so and so that done
[37:04] that and I been there with you been in
[37:08] churches where they tried to get people
[37:10] to practice it and that's the reason I
[37:13] don't like that word practice but it's
[37:14] only want to have but you know trying to
[37:18] get to people I remember one brother was
[37:20] going to speak a an ALB old groundhog
[37:23] into
[37:24] existence well I never did understand
[37:26] why he wanted an albino
[37:28] groundhog because it ain't worth eating
[37:31] to start with it wouldn't matter where
[37:32] they black green or blue or white but he
[37:35] he was going to speak on albo Groundhog
[37:38] well he said that's what the Lord told
[37:40] him now there's where trouble comes in
[37:46] that we get an what you call it an
[37:50] Intuition or thought or an idea and we
[37:53] build it and then we we try to make that
[37:56] manifest when well you say and here's
[37:59] the way we
[38:00] do we say well I spoke Lord for an
[38:04] albino
[38:06] groundhog but I killed a brown
[38:09] cat so I guess the cat was chasing the
[38:13] albino groundhog and I just killed a cat
[38:16] see we try to prop up everything
[38:22] right you know why not just be honest
[38:24] and flat and just forget
[38:26] it
[38:28] I sitting on a deer stand one day and I
[38:29] don't mind telling you this and I
[38:32] sitting there thinking and I thought
[38:33] Lord I could just speak a deer in
[38:34] existence and I could shoot that deer
[38:36] and I'd go back and tell them what I
[38:38] done and about that time this little
[38:39] voice come along and said sure there's a
[38:42] lot of eyes in
[38:46] that you
[38:48] know I'd speak it I'd do this I'd go
[38:51] back and tell
[38:54] it brother brandham never done it that
[38:57] way
[38:59] right it wasn't I'll do this I'll do
[39:02] that it was I done this and done that
[39:06] because I was challenged to do
[39:10] so then what do you have need of you
[39:13] need squirrels speak them into
[39:17] existence but brother Dale you're trying
[39:19] to make us all
[39:21] prophets uh can I quote the scripture
[39:23] let's
[39:25] see was it Paul or was it who was
[39:28] it one of them said I would to God that
[39:32] we were all prophets is that Paul I
[39:35] believe that's right now if I'm wrong on
[39:38] that but I I may be paraphrasing it but
[39:40] I think that's scripture I would that we
[39:42] all be prophets or maybe it's one of the
[39:43] Old Testament prophets speaking about it
[39:46] you know I'll find it
[39:49] okay I thought God wanted all of his
[39:53] children to be his
[39:56] children
[39:58] to be like
[40:01] him and you know what he only spoke as
[40:04] was
[40:07] needed when you realize what I'm talking
[40:10] about you'll see brother randam didn't
[40:11] play with a gift to practice like I was
[40:14] using the word practice to try to go out
[40:17] and do something ahead of time he just
[40:19] waited and God used the
[40:22] gift well that's what we're supposed to
[40:26] do
[40:28] right you don't pray for rain in a monso
[40:31] season you you've heard me say that a
[40:33] many a time you know it's raining like
[40:35] everything and you get out and say Lord
[40:37] I call for rain no I call for it to
[40:41] stop you know if it's raining real
[40:45] bad all
[40:46] right but you see that's what we think
[40:49] boy I prayed for rain we got rain we
[40:51] tell it ahead of
[40:54] time you remember the time I spoke here
[40:57] and I
[40:58] said July and August are driest months
[41:00] but this next two months will be the
[41:03] wetest months we've had it was on record
[41:05] in Gainesville Georgia that it
[41:09] was but you see I was just taking God as
[41:13] his
[41:15] word and just saying what I thought he
[41:19] said what are you listening I turn it up
[41:22] back to you are you
[41:26] listening
[41:27] are you thinking about it
[41:32] correctly
[41:34] that faith is so
[41:40] simple it's just so simple until we
[41:42] stumble all over it trying to find
[41:47] it I don't want you to raise your hand
[41:50] or comment or do
[41:52] anything I asked my wife a question the
[41:54] other day but I just want to illustrate
[41:57] something with
[42:03] it in the
[42:07] creation Now I'm just illustrating
[42:09] something that will help the next
[42:11] message or
[42:14] so in the
[42:17] creation on what day was the World
[42:23] created you ain't moving because you
[42:25] know there a problem don't you
[42:29] but write down on the page in front of
[42:31] you what day the world was
[42:39] created all right everybody got it wrote
[42:49] down I've read lips and heard voices
[42:52] enough to know that a lot of you are
[42:54] saying that the world was created on the
[42:56] first day
[42:58] was
[43:01] not World wouldn't created it on the
[43:03] first day if he did you made brother ROM
[43:06] a false
[43:14] prophet you know why because brother
[43:17] brandom
[43:19] said well it
[43:24] says in the world was what is the
[43:28] wording there in Genesis let's go back
[43:30] yeah but let me go back to the let's go
[43:32] back to that I'm just illustrating a
[43:34] point because that's what I asked my
[43:35] wife a point that see we see things like
[43:40] this and we see things the way that it's
[43:43] done and we think it's a revelation and
[43:45] it's a great thing but really it's just
[43:47] an actual reading of the
[43:50] word that's how simple it
[43:52] is in actual reading of the word the
[43:56] world was not created created on the
[43:58] first
[44:04] day the world was created in the
[44:07] beginning God created the heavens and
[44:09] the Earth
[44:12] period so the world could be billions of
[44:15] billions of trillions of years old you
[44:18] ever heard your Prophet say
[44:25] that but see if the world was created on
[44:27] the first day you'd make him a false
[44:30] prophet or a liar there because he'd be
[44:32] wrong go in Genesis and read
[44:35] it in the beginning God created the
[44:38] heavens and the
[44:39] Earth just period that
[44:42] stopped
[44:45] right and watch and the Earth was
[44:48] without form and void and darkness was
[44:51] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[44:54] of God moved upon the face of the water
[44:56] right
[44:58] that's still back through eternities and
[45:00] eternities of
[45:03] eternities and God said let there be
[45:05] light and there was light and God saw
[45:08] the light that it was good and God
[45:11] divided the light from the darkness and
[45:13] and God called a light day and the
[45:15] Darkness he called night and the evening
[45:18] and the morning was the first
[45:25] day it's a simple fact to read the word
[45:27] of
[45:28] God I'm illustrating faith and how
[45:31] simple it is once it's made reveal or
[45:35] thought come to
[45:37] you do you think well the world was made
[45:39] on the first day
[45:42] no the world was created without form
[45:46] and void could have been billions of
[45:48] years and that's why they Tak prove that
[45:50] there so many billion years old or this
[45:52] or that or the
[45:54] other but
[45:57] when they start putting a man back there
[46:00] they got to do it by carbon
[46:02] content or checking his bones and
[46:07] things and like I was reading there last
[46:10] night brother BR said if you had a bone
[46:14] that was thousands of years old he said
[46:17] it couldn't be it wouldn't be preserved
[46:19] too good he said because it would just
[46:21] be gone away you
[46:24] know see that's the problem they're
[46:27] taking the dust and the dirt that's
[46:28] collected around the
[46:30] bone and they're analyzing what's on the
[46:33] bone and it's showing that it's billions
[46:36] of years
[46:37] old that's true the dirt and the things
[46:41] is true it's billions of years
[46:45] old but they're taking that carbon
[46:48] content it's really coming from the dirt
[46:51] and the ashes and the stuff around the
[46:53] bone or on the bone that makes it look
[46:55] like the bones that open
[46:57] bone ain't but 6,000 years
[47:01] old
[47:03] right see now we got the Bible in the
[47:06] correct order as an understanding and
[47:09] our faith is
[47:11] correct now you can have faith in the
[47:14] Bible as to
[47:15] say the Bible doesn't say the world was
[47:18] created on the first day and we only got
[47:21] 6,000 years or six days it doesn't say
[47:25] that
[47:27] he said the heavens and the Earth was
[47:30] created and it literally says our
[47:33] Heavens remember Paul spoke of the
[47:36] heavens of
[47:37] heavens and they asked brother brandham
[47:39] a question that brother brandham is it
[47:41] more than one world he said there's
[47:43] worlds of
[47:49] Worlds worlds of Worlds letot of them
[47:53] out there in space floating around
[47:55] called Mars
[47:58] venis lot of
[48:01] Worlds it's all CU Genesis says
[48:05] worlds are
[48:09] created what are you trying to
[48:10] illustrate and get ready for the
[48:12] question I'm saying what I've tried to
[48:14] say to start with that faith is very
[48:17] very
[48:19] simple but it is the word of God once
[48:23] it's brought into
[48:25] light you know and you'll see that it
[48:28] can't be said any other
[48:30] way because the way that it's said
[48:33] sometimes is to Blind
[48:36] some and Open the Eyes of others but it
[48:39] says the same
[48:41] thing and faith is very very simple it's
[48:46] just
[48:47] believing all right but it's believing
[48:50] the right
[48:53] thing
[48:54] right it's waiting on God to reveal that
[48:57] to you what is the New
[49:01] Birth the revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:04] personally to
[49:06] you you remember how we brought the
[49:08] quote out brother R said that that six
[49:11] sense is the same six sense that God
[49:14] used to create the
[49:21] world well then why are we so stumbling
[49:24] at
[49:25] the
[49:27] point of thinking about
[49:33] creating well let just not for us I want
[49:35] that quote I want to see that I want to
[49:38] read that in the
[49:39] Bible but it's not there so go ahead
[49:42] it's not going to change you because
[49:44] you're going to think
[49:45] that it takes God to be able to break
[49:48] that down to where your eyes can see all
[49:50] I can do is speak and try to open them
[49:54] show you how simple faith is
[49:59] but he
[50:01] says in the beginning God created
[50:03] heavens and the
[50:10] Earth period just
[50:14] stopped brother R said he let this thing
[50:17] float down through there he said then in
[50:19] come the ice ages and the
[50:22] things and they can prove that
[50:24] happen he said that's how that great big
[50:27] Grand Canyon was
[50:30] cut it wasn't just water running over a
[50:38] rock see then it's very
[50:41] simple brother Brown said it like this
[50:44] he said well he was a prophet that's
[50:46] right but he was a man of simple
[50:51] thoughts he said they're trying to go to
[50:53] the Moon said that doesn't make no
[50:54] difference said when they get there they
[50:56] ain't going to find
[51:01] nothing you know what they got there
[51:03] they found
[51:05] nothing just as simple as it could be
[51:09] you say well the Lord showed him that
[51:10] did the Lord show him that or was he
[51:13] speaking words from his
[51:16] lips that God was allowing to
[51:22] be you know sometimes it might not be
[51:25] you
[51:27] because I'll put it in plain language if
[51:30] it's me trying to speak it won't
[51:35] happen that's practicing trying to get
[51:38] it to
[51:41] work but if he says it I don't worry
[51:44] about telling
[51:47] nobody see I'm the kind of person
[51:49] that'll tell you now if that don't
[51:51] happen then the Lord didn't speak to
[51:55] me I'm not going to prop it
[51:58] up you know well it should have been
[52:01] this or could have been that or maybe it
[52:02] was that
[52:07] no like a man made a statement one time
[52:10] about somebody and he said because
[52:12] they'd went against him and he said
[52:14] let's just wait and see what'll happen
[52:15] to them
[52:22] people Brother Richard if you live 10
[52:24] more years there going to be a lot of
[52:25] things happened to you
[52:27] you right it might not be because I said
[52:31] it it's just simply because it's going
[52:33] to
[52:35] be but yeah we think it's something then
[52:38] something happens look at there but what
[52:40] they don't see
[52:43] is is that when you think you're trying
[52:45] to bring it on somebody else be careful
[52:49] you're opening up a door for it to come
[52:52] on
[52:53] you open your blinded eyes
[52:57] to the point that you try to call down
[52:59] something on somebody else it'll come
[53:00] back on you but are you going to admit
[53:07] it if you got the six sense you don't
[53:10] have to worry about
[53:12] it who's first six sense
[53:16] Faith the new birth Faith the baptism of
[53:20] the Holy Ghost
[53:24] Faith something real
[53:27] a
[53:28] substance get Danny and then we'll get H
[53:32] coming up the line
[53:38] okay well here I go y'all you started
[53:41] out by said you didn't know how to ask
[53:44] well I probably don't know how to ask
[53:47] but uh you talking about the Blank Spot
[53:49] earlier and we well most of us here know
[53:53] that uh when I was in the hospital three
[53:58] weeks whose Faith was that to carry me
[54:01] through
[54:08] exactly
[54:10] exactly wouldn't
[54:13] Danny
[54:14] no but you
[54:23] know it is tough yeah not knowing what
[54:28] happened for 3
[54:30] weeks don't know who you talk
[54:32] to what you talk
[54:35] about who come to see you and the way I
[54:39] understand it I mean you and Brother
[54:41] Dean Jo some of y'all were there almost
[54:42] as long as I
[54:44] was and
[54:54] uh get all about Fai been
[54:57] simple well that's a good thing because
[54:59] I'm a I'm a simple
[55:07] guy y'all forgive me
[55:15] in but the last thing I
[55:20] remember before I
[55:22] fa is I saw how uneasy or how
[55:26] uncomfortable Jacob
[55:28] was being on the
[55:30] roof for me I'm not I'm I'm I've been
[55:33] out on tree limbs on roofs I've been
[55:37] I've been everywhere give me up four
[55:39] five stories what I N I might get a
[55:41] little nervous but I mean nothing like
[55:43] that really bothered me and I saw how
[55:46] uneasy he
[55:49] was and I took my hat off and I bow my
[55:54] head Lord take care of us
[55:58] yeah
[56:00] and when I ask the Lord something I
[56:03] believe right I'll get
[56:10] it
[56:12] and I know this might sound a little
[56:14] little odd but for five weeks I'm in the
[56:17] hospital I don't know that I ever prayed
[56:20] once because of medication or what have
[56:25] you
[56:27] but
[56:30] uh it had faith I guess to carry me
[56:33] through this right even though I didn't
[56:37] know I mean I you know I still don't
[56:40] know I don't have a clue for three weeks
[56:43] what went
[56:44] know but
[56:47] uh faith is simple and just when you ask
[56:52] when you ask the Lord for something
[56:53] believe
[56:54] right and me me I do
[56:58] right good way of putting
[57:02] it is believing
[57:06] him believing that you that he'll do
[57:09] what you ask
[57:11] him well there's not a daddy in here
[57:14] that wouldn't do everything he could for
[57:15] his
[57:16] kids
[57:18] right but the think see that your
[57:20] thoughts was on
[57:23] him Jacob not on yourself see
[57:27] and just simply thinking and
[57:32] believing see we don't think about that
[57:35] being you know that that was God working
[57:39] his way
[57:41] out bring it to a
[57:44] place we just think it's well something
[57:47] it
[57:50] happened I don't think
[57:53] so I think he works out a lot of things
[57:56] in our lives that we don't know nothing
[58:03] about simple Faith
[58:09] Brother Sam you know I've worried you to
[58:12] death over the last couple months since
[58:13] I've been coming here well since my
[58:15] daddy died I've had a lot of troubles
[58:18] issues and problems to go along with I
[58:21] guess living in this world I was talking
[58:23] to my mama up a little further
[58:26] about being so simple it's funny you
[58:29] preaching about that tonight because
[58:30] last night I was on the phone my Mama
[58:32] saying Mama faith and believing in God
[58:34] is so simple we get lost trying because
[58:37] we step over we go past it we look try
[58:40] to look and see something that we
[58:41] shouldn't even be trying to see it's
[58:43] just simple as getting on your knees and
[58:45] asking God to reveal reveal it to you my
[58:49] questions I tell my wife every day we
[58:51] get up honey we got to leave here we go
[58:53] in faith we trust God that the day is
[58:55] going to work out be it a bad day or not
[58:57] if we trust him at the end of the day
[58:59] we'll go to bed and night feeling good
[59:00] about what we've done and that's the way
[59:03] we've been living now for a good
[59:05] while and it's funny that yesterday
[59:07] afternoon my sister called me and then
[59:10] her boyfriend called which is the kids
[59:12] is Daddy and they're all fighting well I
[59:15] tried to talk them down tell them look
[59:16] you need peace you need to pray before
[59:18] you talk to my sister I told my sister
[59:20] you need to ask God to give you the
[59:23] words to talk to the man because he
[59:25] don't know what is right
[59:27] you know and then my mama called me back
[59:29] that night and said hey everybody's
[59:32] peaceful

[59:53] to me she lets me voice what I feel
[59:56] inside and sometimes she correct me if
[59:58] if she don't feel like I'm right and
[59:59] then she'll tell me to call Brother Sam
[1:00:01] and I've called you several times with
[1:00:03] questions I don't want to mislead
[1:00:05] somebody that I love very much I've
[1:00:07] watched my daddy for a lot of years
[1:00:09] correct himself and walk away come back

[1:00:24] goes with all the people in this church
[1:00:26] I love every one of y'all y'all have
[1:00:28] been really good to me and my wife I'm I
[1:00:31] was I laid in jail and I asked God if
[1:00:33] I'm supposed to go back to that church
[1:00:34] when I get out of here you put me back
[1:00:35] in
[1:00:37] there he put me in a house over there
[1:00:40] with no rent a place to stay for me and
[1:00:43] my wife and this church has filled that
[1:00:45] house up with everything we need we've
[1:00:47] got no reason not to be here and be
[1:00:49] grateful and thank God every day for
[1:00:51] every one of y'all and that he's even
[1:00:53] acknowledged that we're here on this
[1:00:54] planet yeah I'm grateful for that and I
[1:00:57] need for all y'all to know that I love
[1:00:58] y'all
[1:01:00] guys who'll be
[1:01:05] next what do you think about
[1:01:09] faith
[1:01:18] Annie I've had a lot of things to happen
[1:01:21] in my life but one time uh Samuel had
[1:01:24] this Uncle he was lost as lost could be
[1:01:27] he cussed and never went to church or
[1:01:30] anything that we know of and they lived
[1:01:32] in South Carolina so he got real sick
[1:01:35] and they had him INT in intensive care
[1:01:39] so Simon's sister I usually would not
[1:01:41] have went but she didn't have anybody to
[1:01:44] go with her so she was going over to see
[1:01:47] him so when I got there they wouldn't
[1:01:51] let anybody go in because they just go
[1:01:54] certain hours in intense of care so they
[1:01:57] said well since y'all are out of town
[1:01:59] we'll let you go in so he was on all
[1:02:02] kind of you know tubes and wires and
[1:02:05] everything else so something just hit me
[1:02:08] I knew he wasn't saved so when I walked
[1:02:12] in all I could get to was his toe I was
[1:02:16] at the end of the bed I just touched his
[1:02:18] toe and I said Lord just let him come
[1:02:22] out of this hospital and get saved and
[1:02:26] they said after he got out of that
[1:02:29] hospital they lived in a meal Village
[1:02:31] they both worked in a cotton mill or
[1:02:33] something they said he got out when he
[1:02:36] got out he went to all the churches
[1:02:39] around all the neighbors and in one year
[1:02:43] the Lord took
[1:02:45] him so I thank God that he he got saved
[1:02:48] before his life
[1:02:50] ended and see that's
[1:02:53] Faith just to believe what you asked for
[1:02:57] I've told you before about him that he
[1:03:00] chewed to
[1:03:02] backa real bad but he chewed it all day
[1:03:07] and he swallowed every bit of it that's
[1:03:09] how bad he
[1:03:11] was something happened in that hospital
[1:03:14] room he never chewed
[1:03:19] again never chewed another bit of
[1:03:21] tobacco after he left that
[1:03:24] hospital and he done that all his life
[1:03:26] cuz I remember when I was a little kid
[1:03:28] watching him getting sick because he
[1:03:30] swallowed all that down he never spit
[1:03:33] out his tobacco until he got ready to
[1:03:36] eat that's how bad it was on him he
[1:03:39] chewed to Twist tobacco not plugs old
[1:03:44] twist but after then he never chewed no
[1:03:47] more but see all of us can testify
[1:03:51] and the things that had happened but do
[1:03:54] we realize
[1:03:57] that who was doing
[1:03:59] that was it you
[1:04:02] asking or was it just the thought come
[1:04:04] to you to
[1:04:07] ask not you that speak us what scripture
[1:04:10] says it's the one in you
[1:04:13] speaking are we going to believe it that
[1:04:15] sister Trudy
[1:04:18] the the one who just got back we can
[1:04:22] call her the got back Trudy
[1:04:24] now
[1:04:26] um I just wanted to give a little report
[1:04:30] on my mom's situation and it also has to
[1:04:32] do with faith as well um while I was
[1:04:36] there now my mom is not a Believer as
[1:04:40] yet um but because of the prayers that
[1:04:44] com from this
[1:04:45] church she don't know it
[1:04:48] yet but what I'm getting from her is
[1:04:52] that she know that God is working in her
[1:04:55] life MH and working with
[1:04:58] her um I'm not going to be in a position
[1:05:02] to like push on her because sometimes it
[1:05:05] get a lot of negative
[1:05:07] feedback um but knowing that she said
[1:05:10] that I felt like you know it's working
[1:05:13] is a wheel within a wheel just going and
[1:05:17] I just want everybody to continue
[1:05:18] praying just not just for her healing
[1:05:20] but mostly for her salvation exactly um
[1:05:24] she's the only thing I have over there
[1:05:25] and I just wanted to be to make it
[1:05:35] amen um I just wanted well most of you
[1:05:39] know my oldest daughter pervine does a
[1:05:41] lot of work in the Middle East and you
[1:05:44] know I've prayed worked with my kids all
[1:05:47] the time that they're growing up but her
[1:05:49] job a lot of times I pray extra prayers
[1:05:53] for her but I just wanted to tell you
[1:05:55] about one time she was telling me when
[1:05:57] she was in Egypt she U she always liked
[1:06:01] to get out early in the morning and walk
[1:06:02] or run you know before she starts her
[1:06:04] day and she was doing that she's I think
[1:06:08] she was in a bedin village but she was
[1:06:11] going across the desert following a road
[1:06:13] down and she said she saw a truck coming
[1:06:16] down the road and it was full of a lot
[1:06:18] of young men and uh when they saw her
[1:06:22] the truck stopped and they all started
[1:06:23] to get down and she was looking around
[1:06:26] and there was nowhere to go and nothing
[1:06:27] to protect her and she was getting
[1:06:30] scared said you know what am I going to
[1:06:31] do now and she said then all of a sudden
[1:06:34] they all started running back to the
[1:06:35] truck and scrambled inside and she
[1:06:38] looked around and there was a dog beside
[1:06:40] her yeah and you have to understand in
[1:06:43] Egypt they don't have dogs or very very
[1:06:46] few a lot of cats but hardly any dogs
[1:06:49] and I asked her why they ran away and
[1:06:51] she said because they're afraid of dogs
[1:06:53] they think dogs have demons basically
[1:06:56] and I said did you see where the dog
[1:06:58] came from she said no and I said what
[1:07:01] happened to it she said it followed me
[1:07:02] all the rest of the day back to the camp
[1:07:06] and then in the evening it just walked
[1:07:08] off she said I don't know where it came
[1:07:09] from I don't know where it went right so
[1:07:12] if that's not the hand of God right
[1:07:17] amen that's what we believe you'll be
[1:07:20] there who'll be
[1:07:22] next that
[1:07:24] right
[1:07:28] I used talking about while ago about
[1:07:30] practicing going to the doctor they
[1:07:33] wants me to take two blood pill blood
[1:07:35] pressure pills so the last time I went
[1:07:38] to uh to the doctor I told him I wasn't
[1:07:40] taking those two I was cutting them down
[1:07:43] to uh a half each yeah and now I'm down
[1:07:46] to just a half on
[1:07:48] one and you talking about practicing
[1:07:51] well I call it exercise in my faith and
[1:07:54] all cuz I don't temp God you know what I
[1:07:56] mean but I just believeing I get I take
[1:08:00] that half right by God's
[1:08:05] grace just say it and go forward we'll
[1:08:07] be
[1:08:11] next this may sound kind of silly to
[1:08:14] people but you know I have a lot of
[1:08:16] things on my Facebook about natural news
[1:08:19] and health health things and stuff like
[1:08:22] that
[1:08:23] um anyway one of the things things that
[1:08:25] I was reading was at Monsanto one of the
[1:08:29] big companies they're the ones that made
[1:08:31] the agent orange for
[1:08:33] Vietnam well they are now going to start
[1:08:38] spraying our food that is growing with
[1:08:42] this agent
[1:08:43] orange and you know one of the things
[1:08:45] that the Lord showed me not just within
[1:08:48] the past few weeks you know the
[1:08:50] scripture where it says we can pick up
[1:08:52] serpents or drink deadly things and you
[1:08:55] know it wouldn't harm us I said well you
[1:08:57] know what come to me it didn't
[1:08:59] necessarily mean that we were going to
[1:09:02] pick up a a drink of Arsenic and drink
[1:09:05] it like I mean that could be too but the
[1:09:08] food stuff that's out there right now
[1:09:11] that we
[1:09:12] consume all of the stuff that they have
[1:09:16] in that all it's doing is deteriorating
[1:09:19] every's body everybody's body but you
[1:09:22] know when we pray over our food
[1:09:26] that prayer of faith keeps that stuff
[1:09:30] right from doing us such harm and it's
[1:09:33] like you always tell us when it comes to
[1:09:36] medication put a prayer cloth in there
[1:09:39] sanctify it before you take it that God
[1:09:42] would take the side effects away so
[1:09:44] that's Faith that's faith in his word
[1:09:46] that he'll do what we asked him to do so
[1:09:50] that's just something that had come to
[1:09:51] me and I thought well Lord that is so
[1:09:54] simple but that that's exactly what it
[1:09:56] is it's faith in believing what he said
[1:09:59] he would do amen
[1:10:05] exactly Brother Sam we don't know if
[1:10:08] we've got faith until we exercise it
[1:10:12] right and I think a lot of times I'm
[1:10:14] learning I'm talking about me now what
[1:10:16] I'm going to say but I have learned in
[1:10:19] the last few weeks listening to you and
[1:10:22] listening to what's come up on my iPod
[1:10:25] at home home and just watching
[1:10:27] life that we're missing out on a lot of
[1:10:30] things that are extremely simple simply
[1:10:33] because we just don't stop and take God
[1:10:36] at his word and stand there we let Satan
[1:10:39] throw us a curve and lose
[1:10:42] it as for instance we went with down and
[1:10:45] was with Brother Dean and sister Peggy
[1:10:49] today the doctor had told Brother Dean
[1:10:51] his small blood vessels were collapsing
[1:10:54] today they weren't
[1:10:56] but it worked around where you had a
[1:10:57] different doctor and this doctor was
[1:10:59] very thorough I could go in detail but
[1:11:01] take too much time but just to make a
[1:11:03] make a point and an i Peggy and Dean all
[1:11:07] believe that God arranged everything
[1:11:09] that happened down there today the
[1:11:12] doctor getting changed and everything
[1:11:14] else was so that what God had done for
[1:11:17] Brother Dean was made manifest he the
[1:11:21] doctor had the doctor that treated him
[1:11:23] today testified that God had been there
[1:11:26] amen where it
[1:11:28] works believe in him and just go on
[1:11:32] who's
[1:11:37] next when you said that uh Adam had uh I
[1:11:42] always thought that Adam had eternal
[1:11:44] life in his
[1:11:46] soul now how could that not be God in
[1:11:49] his soul it was well how could
[1:11:54] he
[1:11:55] I forget how you said he had it it was
[1:11:57] like he words what you're saying Jesus
[1:12:00] hadn't died yet that type of thing but
[1:12:03] but remember Adam was by
[1:12:08] impartation he never went through
[1:12:11] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:12:14] of the Holy Ghost to come into the
[1:12:15] kingdom because the kingdom was not
[1:12:17] present but he started the first person
[1:12:20] with the example of what he would end
[1:12:23] that mankind upon
[1:12:25] so he had to start Adam with eternal
[1:12:27] life in the soul that's true see and he
[1:12:31] imparted it all right now I don't put
[1:12:34] them in the same category but I give an
[1:12:37] example uh because see Adam was the
[1:12:39] first and he brought in but one day the
[1:12:42] foolish virgins will be given eternal
[1:12:45] life right right but that eternal life
[1:12:48] will not
[1:12:50] be the kingdom of God in the bases of
[1:12:54] what we call the new
[1:12:57] birth it's an
[1:12:58] impartation it's given unto them you
[1:13:02] know on the basis that God promised it
[1:13:04] and that makers we make the foolish
[1:13:07] virgins the fal Jew the different ones
[1:13:09] that are there it will give them eternal
[1:13:11] life to their soul but they have nothing
[1:13:13] to do with you're
[1:13:15] 144,000 after we leave out of here and
[1:13:17] the kingdom is gone they will receive
[1:13:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost which will
[1:13:22] give their soul eternal life but it will
[1:13:24] not not make them part of the body of
[1:13:28] Christ so Adam's not part of the Bride
[1:13:32] no so you didn't have a bride Christ
[1:13:35] that was a bride of of
[1:13:38] Jehovah so it has to what I'm seeing
[1:13:41] immediately is that to be part of the
[1:13:43] Bride it has to be a decision on our
[1:13:46] part
[1:13:47] exactly where Adam didn't have that
[1:13:50] exactly that's why I use the word
[1:13:51] impartation okay he just spoke right
[1:13:54] into existence
[1:13:55] into Adam right just like he'll speak to
[1:13:59] the 144,000 he'll speak to the through
[1:14:02] the two witnesses I mean the uh the fill
[1:14:05] Jew the ones who don't have it like
[1:14:07] he'll speak to the foolish virgins one
[1:14:09] day and they'll receive eternal life but
[1:14:11] it does not make
[1:14:13] them the body of Christ there's a lot of
[1:14:17] difference in it because we have to do
[1:14:19] with receiving
[1:14:21] that we have to go through steps
[1:14:25] to receive that eternal life and that's
[1:14:28] something that we do you know we we're a
[1:14:31] part of it right but yet uh it's it's a
[1:14:35] how can you explain eternal
[1:14:38] life uh once they receive eternal life
[1:14:41] sure that'll be eternal life but they
[1:14:43] will never be
[1:14:46] bride even though they will be given
[1:14:48] eternal
[1:14:50] life because see we have something to do
[1:14:52] with being
[1:14:53] bride you know you know a man can ask
[1:14:56] you to be his wife but you must
[1:14:59] accept and walk into that or you're not
[1:15:02] his wife so that's be the
[1:15:05] difference okay and that's when I use
[1:15:07] that to liken
[1:15:08] Adam to the bases that God gave him
[1:15:12] Eternal and I believe he gave Eve
[1:15:14] eternal life right I believe in their
[1:15:16] soul they had eternal life all right but
[1:15:20] that was the way God started
[1:15:22] Mankind and speaking of what it would
[1:15:25] be when it was finished up cuz see Jesus
[1:15:29] didn't have to have impartation to
[1:15:31] receive eternal life he was eternal
[1:15:34] life
[1:15:36] you so he chose us by his for knowledge
[1:15:39] but we chose him yeah we chose him when
[1:15:43] when you say yes to a boy that asks for
[1:15:46] your hand in marriage you're choosing
[1:15:48] him right over other men
[1:15:51] exactly okay see we get it all in our
[1:15:53] mind to think now wait a minute he chose
[1:15:55] us we didn't choose him give you a quote
[1:15:57] for that you know he chose us we didn't
[1:16:00] choose him right but if you don't accept
[1:16:03] it it's not
[1:16:05] yours so in the basis you chose it in
[1:16:08] the basis of accepting it right you
[1:16:12] accepted what he gave to you right if
[1:16:14] you didn't you don't have
[1:16:18] it okay that's the difference anybody
[1:16:23] else
[1:16:34] lot people know my dad David
[1:16:38] yeah today would have been his 87th
[1:16:44] birthday he had a lot of
[1:16:46] faith one time uh we went to uh Alto up
[1:16:52] here at Arendale I had a brother that
[1:16:54] was in incarcerated
[1:16:58] there and they've been talking about it
[1:17:00] was going to rain all day long and and
[1:17:03] the it got so dark and
[1:17:05] everything and uh we were standing
[1:17:08] outside the gate and it was going to be
[1:17:10] a while before we could get
[1:17:13] in and Dad grabbed my hand and he said
[1:17:15] let's pray that this storm's going to
[1:17:18] pass
[1:17:19] over well we started praying there was
[1:17:22] people all around us and everything they
[1:17:23] were just looking
[1:17:27] and it come just a few drops of rain and
[1:17:29] then it cleared up and it was over with
[1:17:33] right and he had faith my healing too
[1:17:36] when
[1:17:38] I when I didn't have
[1:17:45] it that's what we're not doing s
[1:17:48] g you we're not trying to be any
[1:17:51] different Faith than what everybody
[1:17:52] always always had it's a same faith that
[1:17:55] was in the first church age second third
[1:17:57] fourth fifth all the same
[1:18:00] Faith go ahead well I'm 76 so I could
[1:18:04] talk all
[1:18:05] night but when our children were at home
[1:18:09] we had this sign that hung over the
[1:18:11] first one's bed and uh they made it in U
[1:18:15] in church you know the kids when in one
[1:18:17] of the groups and it said let go and let
[1:18:20] God and as each child married and left
[1:18:23] it hung over the next child bed and I
[1:18:25] just I'm getting it framed again now I
[1:18:27] still have it and you know you have to
[1:18:30] let go of your own thoughts your own
[1:18:33] desires what you see and just let go and
[1:18:37] let God do his beautiful thing right to
[1:18:40] me that's Faith just let go believe him
[1:18:43] ask him tell him you know I always tell
[1:18:46] him Lord you know I'm selfish and this
[1:18:48] is the way I want it to be but I want it
[1:18:50] to be the way you want it to be and you
[1:18:53] know he's never failed me yet I'm 76
[1:18:56] I've known him since I was 12 he's never
[1:18:58] failed me with my Katie I turned her
[1:19:00] over to him the day I came home from the
[1:19:02] hospital and I I mean I was sitting on
[1:19:05] that sofa and I said Lord you know you
[1:19:07] know what tomorrow what down the road
[1:19:10] holds for that child it could be
[1:19:12] something terrible and you know I know
[1:19:15] that you know what's best I wanted to
[1:19:17] stay I'm selfish I wanted to have a good
[1:19:20] healthy full life but whatever you have
[1:19:23] decided whatever you saw
[1:19:25] that I give her back to you she's yours
[1:19:28] that burden left me that day I didn't
[1:19:29] cry another tear and I had cried all day
[1:19:32] the day before and you know it's just I
[1:19:34] could go on and on and on we all could I
[1:19:37] mean God is so faithful to us when we
[1:19:41] don't really deserve it exactly because
[1:19:44] it's
[1:19:45] Faith it's simply believe in
[1:19:49] him believe in it go ahead I just want
[1:19:53] to make one more statement my dad died
[1:19:55] about 3 years ago and I kept on
[1:19:56] wondering all my life growing up why he
[1:19:58] called God his he'd always say me and my
[1:20:01] God's right together because before he
[1:20:04] died I don't know what come on me but I
[1:20:06] sat down in the building with him and
[1:20:07] asked him I said
[1:20:09] Daddy are you right with God I want you
[1:20:12] to know I thank God for you've been a
[1:20:14] good daddy I love you you've been good
[1:20:15] to me my whole life but I need to ask
[1:20:17] you if you've got yourself right with
[1:20:19] God he said I'm right with my God and I
[1:20:22] never understand never understood what
[1:20:24] he meant by my God until I come here
[1:20:27] yeah now I know he's mine too exactly
[1:20:31] he's my
[1:20:34] God who'll be next
[1:20:39] sister um I want to say two things uh
[1:20:42] first of all his dad bill was just a
[1:20:45] fixture in my life all my life and I
[1:20:48] remember you remember brother brandham
[1:20:49] saying how that people would drive to
[1:20:52] the meetings and broken down old cars
[1:20:54] well his daddy was one I all my life I
[1:20:58] remember hearing them tell tales about
[1:20:59] how Bill would have to stop every few
[1:21:01] miles and put oil in the car you know
[1:21:04] and and they would hear brother Brandon
[1:21:05] was there and they would just pick up
[1:21:07] and go and come back that day and stuff
[1:21:09] so that when I think about Bill I think
[1:21:10] about that
[1:21:11] but the other thing is you said Sunday
[1:21:15] you mentioned how H you ask us a
[1:21:18] question have you ever had it happen to
[1:21:20] where you
[1:21:21] knew you no one could take it away from
[1:21:24] you when when something happened well
[1:21:25] this is a really kind of a simple thing
[1:21:28] I mean it's not a monuments healing or
[1:21:31] anything but several years ago um
[1:21:34] anybody knows JC um he when my mom
[1:21:38] passed away he wanted to to move and she
[1:21:42] had lived there all her life there in
[1:21:43] whiteall and he wanted to get away from
[1:21:45] whiteall so they uh well actually it was
[1:21:47] before Mama died actually when they
[1:21:49] moved um and he moved her out to a
[1:21:51] trailer park and she grieved leaving
[1:21:53] mama and stuff and I moved back in with
[1:21:55] Mama um
[1:21:57] but she wasn't happy and she talked to
[1:22:00] me about it and I said well let's just
[1:22:01] pray about it well he ended up moving
[1:22:03] her next door to the
[1:22:06] property and so he had sold the the
[1:22:08] property that she loved he that Daddy
[1:22:10] gave her he had sold it but it was like
[1:22:13] owner finance so the guy was paying him
[1:22:16] every month so they moved next door to
[1:22:20] the property that she loved and I just I
[1:22:23] remember just when I said that to her it
[1:22:25] just felt it just felt different you
[1:22:28] know it just felt different than just
[1:22:30] saying it you know right well didn't
[1:22:33] think nothing else about it prayed about
[1:22:35] it and didn't think nothing else about
[1:22:36] it they moved back in next door and
[1:22:38] every little bit it would just you know
[1:22:39] maybe maybe months but it would come to
[1:22:41] my mind you know cuz she would grieve
[1:22:44] over it and talk to me about it this guy
[1:22:47] ended up I mean he was a good way into
[1:22:50] paying for it and he ended up filing
[1:22:53] bankruptcy and and the property went
[1:22:55] right back to them and then and and
[1:22:58] right now she's back in that property
[1:23:00] and and it's but what my point is she's
[1:23:04] happy about it you know living there but
[1:23:07] it it it me it seems like like she'll
[1:23:10] relive it all and and and and in my mind
[1:23:13] when she talks about it I'm thinking
[1:23:15] about what the Lord did MH you know that
[1:23:18] that's that faith that thing happened
[1:23:20] with me but I it didn't it didn't seem
[1:23:23] to impact her in that same way and so
[1:23:26] that's just one of those little simple
[1:23:27] times that I always when you talk about
[1:23:29] faith I always remember that little
[1:23:31] situation
[1:23:34] right who's
[1:23:45] next I think about when
[1:23:49] um my mother came to the church she was
[1:23:53] on oxygen you know and she'd been around
[1:23:56] how order and all of
[1:23:58] us and I saw her faith building and and
[1:24:03] as everyone knows she was delivered from
[1:24:04] being on oxygen for last couple years of
[1:24:07] her life then I think about my
[1:24:10] father who came to the church heard the
[1:24:14] word and and some of the thoughts he had
[1:24:18] and then I think of about he how he
[1:24:20] called me one day and said he called
[1:24:21] tell you goodbye and that's where you
[1:24:23] going he said I'm going the hospital not
[1:24:25] coming out and I said well where's your
[1:24:27] faith and he said he was real carnal you
[1:24:29] know so but I had called brother Wade
[1:24:32] and and talk to you all about the day I
[1:24:34] had to disconnect the machines on him
[1:24:37] and I think you know he saw the word
[1:24:41] manifested in my mother in her
[1:24:44] healing and then he was always negative
[1:24:48] about what we
[1:24:50] believed and yet then I think about
[1:24:52] Marybeth being around here all all that
[1:24:54] time and around all the word and then
[1:24:57] when she had her leg cut off just you
[1:24:59] know a while
[1:25:01] back I had I asked myself where's her
[1:25:04] faith I mean she had to see the works
[1:25:06] and it wasn't Works she had to see the
[1:25:08] word
[1:25:09] manifested but in that was some Works
[1:25:12] where mother was healed and I just don't
[1:25:15] understand how you can walk around and
[1:25:17] be so close to the truth and yet blind
[1:25:21] yourself of it and deny it and then you
[1:25:24] sit and look and see what where they're
[1:25:27] at some people just have to be petted I
[1:25:29] guess some people like like that but I I
[1:25:32] I don't understand why if you see
[1:25:34] something happen in a healing you've got
[1:25:37] to be the in the natural I would think
[1:25:39] you at least pursue to try to understand
[1:25:43] how that happened you know so I just
[1:25:46] thank God that that Janet you know I
[1:25:49] always went to church and when Janet and
[1:25:52] I first met for two years I'd go to
[1:25:54] church church on Sunday she wouldn't go
[1:25:56] and I went and I'd go and she she said
[1:25:58] I'll come to church when you come hear
[1:26:01] the
[1:26:03] word that's where we came here it be 20
[1:26:05] years uh November yeah I just thank you
[1:26:10] for helping
[1:26:16] me who'll be
[1:26:19] next brother
[1:26:23] Aaron
[1:26:27] just want to give a little
[1:26:28] testimony
[1:26:30] um everybody knows about my job
[1:26:33] situation and how everything went and
[1:26:35] you know just having faith to believe
[1:26:37] that God would make a
[1:26:40] way and you know
[1:26:43] just it's
[1:26:46] almost amazing but just the way God
[1:26:49] works it I was able to get this job the
[1:26:53] way I did and
[1:26:56] uh everybody asked me every morning how

[1:29:15] walked out of that was talking to one of
[1:29:17] the guys I work with and I told him I

[1:29:42] I'm just so thankful that he's there
[1:29:43] with us all the time amen and
[1:29:46] amen even when we're
[1:29:49] unconscious and don't know
[1:29:51] it
[1:29:53] brother
[1:30:01] uh I just want to say something based on
[1:30:03] what Aaron was just talking about I was
[1:30:05] over in Winder and seeing my son and I
[1:30:08] come down the road and come up to this
[1:30:10] convenience store on a hot day it was it
[1:30:13] was a 100 degree day and I look up and I
[1:30:16] pull in this convenience store and guess
[1:30:18] who I see on top of the roof up there
[1:30:20] with all that heat all that hot air
[1:30:23] blowing and then him working on a hot
[1:30:24] air conditioner was my brother Aaron he
[1:30:27] didn't have no business up on top of
[1:30:29] that roof way up there and I mean I know
[1:30:33] he's not a a ballet dancer or anything
[1:30:36] you know and he don't have no business
[1:30:37] up there and there he was up on the roof
[1:30:40] trying to make a living doing the best
[1:30:41] he had right in front of him and I
[1:30:43] thought to myself I said Lord why is our
[1:30:45] brother up here like this on this roof
[1:30:47] he just I mean I'm not saying he wasn't
[1:30:49] qualified to do it yeah he's he's good
[1:30:51] at it he's good at his job but not as
[1:30:54] you know I thought to myself I said Lord
[1:30:55] we got to get him somewhere else get him
[1:30:58] off that roof and out of the heat
[1:30:59] because it was it was up there it was
[1:31:01] bad and I thought to myself that's just
[1:31:04] a simple things like you said one one
[1:31:07] can chase a thousand two Chase 10,000 I
[1:31:10] said he needs to get another job Lord
[1:31:12] right and uh here he is he's testifying
[1:31:15] about it and I thank God for the little
[1:31:17] things that happened in our day every
[1:31:19] day every day exactly I thought about
[1:31:22] writing down everything every day that
[1:31:24] God does for me and I spend my whole day
[1:31:27] writing right because he shows it to me
[1:31:30] right I thank him for it I thank him for
[1:31:33] this word I thank him for this church
[1:31:35] and I thank the ministry that's
[1:31:37] here I know it's God sent and I feel
[1:31:40] like I know he sent me here for a reason
[1:31:42] and that reason's being manifested and
[1:31:44] fulfilled all right and I and I love it
[1:31:47] I appreciate
[1:31:50] it who'll be
[1:31:52] next
[1:31:59] looking all
[1:32:01] over uh I guess most of y'all knows
[1:32:06] Chris the the the boy that I raised and
[1:32:11] um recently well I guess in the last
[1:32:14] year or so that uh the man that was
[1:32:18] supposed to be his father passed away
[1:32:21] and he decided that
[1:32:25] we as as parents to him mistreated him
[1:32:28] because we
[1:32:30] didn't have the didn't give him the
[1:32:34] opportunity that he needed to know his
[1:32:37] daddy but I told him from the time that
[1:32:41] we first took him we went to court and
[1:32:43] the court T had the man to be in court
[1:32:46] with him and he asked him said are you
[1:32:49] his father he said no I'm not so the
[1:32:52] judge just missed him from the court
[1:32:54] and told him to go on by his business
[1:32:57] because if you're not his father you
[1:32:59] don't have no need to be here and uh for
[1:33:03] for a while for a long while you know
[1:33:05] kind of bother me a good bit you know
[1:33:08] like I've took you off the street and
[1:33:10] raised you and now you don't even want
[1:33:14] to speak to me don't even want to know
[1:33:17] who am claim that you doesn't even know
[1:33:19] me and he put stuff all on you know
[1:33:21] Facebook with people that the girls one
[1:33:25] that was his sister that this this is my
[1:33:28] family and uh but I I I think I had
[1:33:32] enough faith that I began to just push
[1:33:35] him you know push the thoughts out of my
[1:33:38] mind and and and carry on with God
[1:33:41] because I know that he will continue to
[1:33:43] carry me through whatever things is
[1:33:47] happening and uh I mean you know he's
[1:33:50] he's he's gotten away from serving God
[1:33:52] in a way and and um he recently I was at
[1:33:58] a thing with Ru sisters for for Father's
[1:34:02] Day and his wife and he he does have a
[1:34:05] daughter and daughter came but they
[1:34:07] refused to even speak to me acknowledge
[1:34:11] that I was there and uh but I said well
[1:34:16] I've did the best I could with him to
[1:34:19] help him understand who God was but he
[1:34:21] said well I was glad when I turned 18 so
[1:34:26] I don't have to go to church anymore and
[1:34:29] uh so he he he's he's really gotten away
[1:34:31] from it but you
[1:34:34] know I I just I just read I read the
[1:34:37] Bible I keep it keep going you know what
[1:34:41] Paul
[1:34:42] said this this one verse I want to read
[1:34:44] here in Peter part of wherefore I will
[1:34:47] not be negligent to put you always in
[1:34:50] remembrance of these things though ye
[1:34:54] know them to and be established in this
[1:34:57] present truth and so I have the faith
[1:35:02] are the present truth of God's word
[1:35:04] that's what I continue to hold fast to
[1:35:07] and I continue to pray for him too
[1:35:09] because he's in a terrible
[1:35:13] place so just thank God for for his
[1:35:17] faith that's the main thing is you can
[1:35:19] come out of it with the right
[1:35:22] attitude that's
[1:35:24] come out of the right
[1:35:26] attitude to do the best you can and then
[1:35:28] get ridiculed and all but still right
[1:35:32] attitude you know God can take that and
[1:35:34] work a lot of
[1:35:36] Miracles
[1:35:38] right anybody
[1:35:52] else
[1:35:54] I just want to give the Lord all the
[1:35:57] praise and glory for my

[1:36:15] plants but I was taken standing one day
[1:36:18] working for this guy in Gainesville who

[1:37:07] out of 63 months we have made it 62
[1:37:12] times yeah a bonus and that's just the
[1:37:15] Lord blessing right the company has

[1:37:32] we can't close this house cuz we can't
[1:37:34] find this lady we prayed and that lady
[1:37:38] walked in the house and she said
[1:37:40] something's happened because I'm never
[1:37:43] at home and that phone rang yeah but
[1:37:45] there's just more and more testimony
[1:37:47] that God's in all of it right and when
[1:37:51] you see people that these people were
[1:37:55] so uh I mean they didn't have a good
[1:37:59] word to share their attitude was
[1:38:02] terrible nobody talked about the Lord
[1:38:04] everything was bad words but now there's
[1:38:09] an atmosphere where you're sharing a
[1:38:12] little bit so there's some people that's
[1:38:14] come out that wouldn't speak of the Lord
[1:38:17] more and more
[1:38:19] are so I I just think he put me there
[1:38:22] for that purpose to
[1:38:24] share yeah but I'm telling you he's uh
[1:38:29] they don't know how he's
[1:38:31] bless
[1:38:34] amen anybody else where we
[1:38:44] go I just want to give one more
[1:38:46] testimony I was thinking you know about
[1:38:48] what you said to speak what you need
[1:38:50] when you have need of it you know cuz
[1:38:52] you don't play games with this right but
[1:38:56] years ago when my children were small
[1:38:58] there was a Sher had to be out of town
[1:39:01] and he was out of town for about six
[1:39:02] weeks I think and I was at the house and
[1:39:05] we kept getting a rash of obscene phone
[1:39:07] calls and you know I wouldn't talk to
[1:39:10] the guy but every few days he'd call
[1:39:12] back again and uh I I was praying about
[1:39:16] it I said you know Lord what can I do so
[1:39:19] finally uh when one day when he called I
[1:39:23] just told him I said I rebuke you in the
[1:39:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ you leave
[1:39:27] us alone don't call anymore and then I
[1:39:30] hung up the phone well I had to I think
[1:39:33] it was the next day I had to go
[1:39:35] somewhere Kevin was at the house by
[1:39:37] himself he was a little guy his pray
[1:39:39] like 10 11 years old and uh when I got
[1:39:42] home he said Mom that guy that's been
[1:39:44] calling is called back and said he said
[1:39:46] all kinds of bad words He was cursing
[1:39:49] what you believe and I remember what you
[1:39:51] know brother Brandon said about anybody
[1:39:54] cursing your faith or this message so I
[1:39:57] told him I said don't worry he's never
[1:39:59] going to call here again and he never
[1:40:01] did right I don't know what happened to
[1:40:03] him I don't think I want to know what
[1:40:04] happened to
[1:40:06] him
[1:40:08] exactly don't want to know what happened
[1:40:10] the Lord takes care of
[1:40:16] Amen I was just thinking today as I came
[1:40:19] to church about what Peter said and
[1:40:25] I know people might be upset because you
[1:40:28] believe that you're in the church where
[1:40:31] God put you but that's how I feel where
