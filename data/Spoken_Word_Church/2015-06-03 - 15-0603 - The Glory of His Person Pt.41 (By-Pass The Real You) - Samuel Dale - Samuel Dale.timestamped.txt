[5:48] some and you have them written down let

[5:52] on it and study on a little bit by the
[5:54] weekend but I remembered that and I went
[5:57] back and listened to the both Services
[6:00] Sunday to you know get kind of lined up
[6:03] and I remembered I had said that I would
[6:05] try to cover a part there on this that U
[6:10] I hadn't covered so I thought I'll do it
[6:11] tonight and then we'll have uh maybe at
[6:15] least Sunday afternoon we'll have
[6:16] questions and answers all right so you
[6:19] get your questions and answers and sorry
[6:21] if you would come ton not thinking
[6:22] you're going to do it but write them
[6:24] down and we'll try to cover them even if
[6:26] you're not here we'll try to read and
[6:28] cover that but remember the bible study
[6:30] this coming Saturday 6:00 remember the
[6:33] Father's Day weekend I make these
[6:35] announcements because only internet
[6:38] sometimes they cut it and pull in you
[6:41] know and the whole entire song service
[6:43] is not actually covered under someone
[6:46] that you hear and see so you know it is
[6:49] if you're doing it live but other than
[6:52] that you know you're trying to to do and
[6:54] I I make announcements to make sure we
[6:56] don't forget okay so the the Father's
[6:59] Day weekend will be June 18th 19th 20th
[7:03] and just make your plans to be that the
[7:05] ladies during that time on June the 19th
[7:08] we'll be having a painting time here at
[7:11] the church and I'm I'm freely I'll buy
[7:14] all the paint they want as long as they
[7:17] don't mess up everything else you know
[7:19] and they can just paint and I don't
[7:22] think that's the kind of painting
[7:24] they're talking about but anyhow all
[7:26] right they're having that and remember
[7:28] that and remember the 4th of July
[7:31] meeting with brother Vernon being with
[7:32] us and the cookout and then remember the
[7:35] fellowship meeting will be here now on
[7:39] July the 18th the third Saturday in July
[7:44] all right remember those announcements
[7:47] so we're making them a way ahead of time
[7:49] okay Revelations 1 and 2 Corinthians 5
[7:54] Heavenly Father we thank you for all the
[7:57] things that you've given unto us we
[7:59] thank you for loving us because we know
[8:01] you loved us way before we could ever
[8:04] think about loving you and Lord it takes
[8:08] time sometimes to learn to love and to
[8:10] make it into a full complete
[8:12] manifestation and we desire Lord
[8:15] to know your love and your understanding
[8:18] of each one of us have your way forgive
[8:21] our sins lead us by thy Grace remember
[8:23] the ones that are not here the ones that
[8:25] are traveling the ones that things that
[8:27] are doing and just remember each one and
[8:30] let your grace be with each one of us we
[8:32] love you in Jesus name amen remember
[8:36] Anna Roberts now we'll be having a
[8:40] surgery in the morning so remember that
[8:43] pray the Lord would would uh you know
[8:46] take care of everything I tried to fix
[8:49] these little things up here to see if we
[8:51] could stop the fluffing fluffing but if
[8:53] it works we'll put some tape on it and
[8:56] do something all right uh Revelations
[9:00] 1:12 and I turned to see the voice that
[9:03] spake with me and being turned I saw
[9:05] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[9:07] midst of the seven candlesticks one like
[9:09] unto the son of man clothed with a
[9:11] garment down to the foot and G about the
[9:13] PS with a golden girdle his head and his
[9:16] hairs were white like wool as white as
[9:19] snow and his eyes were as a flame of
[9:22] fire and his feet like undefined brce as
[9:25] if they burned in a furnace and his
[9:27] voice as the sound of many
[9:30] Waters all right we'll go to Second
[9:35] corini
[9:39] 5 for we know that if our Earthly House
[9:43] of this Tabernacle were disolved we have
[9:46] a building of God and house not made
[9:49] with hands Eternal in the heavens now
[9:52] this is not talking about a
[9:55] house all right it's a body but it's not
[9:59] a house that way all right so when we
[10:02] get on through you'll see for in this
[10:05] this house that we're living now we Gran
[10:09] earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon
[10:12] with our H our house which is from
[10:15] Heaven if so be that being clothed we
[10:18] shall be be not be shall not be found
[10:21] naked for we that are in this Tabernacle
[10:25] do grown being burdened not for that we
[10:28] should be un clothed but clothed upon
[10:31] that mortality might be swallowed up of
[10:33] life now he that hath wrought us for the
[10:36] selfs same thing is God who also hath
[10:39] given us the earnest of the spirit
[10:43] therefore now concluding it what we are
[10:46] always confident
[10:48] knowing that whilst we are at home in
[10:51] this body we are
[10:54] absent from the Lord you may be seated
[10:57] the Lord had his Blessing to to the
[10:59] reading of the word now I want to try to
[11:03] just make a fast run through uh some
[11:07] parts that I want to make sure that you
[11:10] follow me and then we'll get to the part
[11:14] of where we talk about bypassing and and
[11:17] things like that so remember that uh
[11:21] let's
[11:22] see seem like there other announcements
[11:24] but not but I'm now everybody is
[11:27] supposed to have a copy of tonight's
[11:29] notes so if you don't have one raise
[11:32] your hand they'll give you a copy of it
[11:34] to where that you can can uh keep these
[11:38] I like to give you these because see
[11:40] sometimes we even though we quote so
[11:41] many things so many times still it's
[11:44] better to have them laying somewhere
[11:46] that you can pick it up and read it and
[11:49] and know you know what is being said now
[11:53] backing up a little bit onto this past
[11:55] Sunday
[11:56] services that we were trying to cover
[11:59] and have been trying to cover for a long
[12:03] time um 40 something years of how real
[12:08] that God really
[12:10] is now I know that may get old to you it
[12:14] may be burdensome to hear the same thing
[12:17] over and over and over but Paul said it
[12:19] was needful uh so I don't worry about it
[12:23] you know I I I worry if it does burden
[12:26] you because why would not you want want
[12:29] to know more about uh your savior your
[12:33] lord your all and
[12:35] all and to know that he's real because
[12:40] you got to admit now that there was a
[12:42] time when we all started basically that
[12:45] started out in organized religion and
[12:48] and all and that we started out
[12:51] believing well God is a spirit you know
[12:54] he just a spirit he just just floating
[12:56] around and and in all things and when
[13:00] the prophet begin to speak of him as he
[13:03] did and how real he
[13:06] was then you know it begin to D on me
[13:10] that hey wait a minute we've been
[13:12] missing a lot you say well brother God
[13:16] is a
[13:19] spirit is that all that we have is that
[13:22] all the thoughts that we can consider
[13:24] about the great
[13:27] Eternal Everlasting in God that he's
[13:29] just a spirit now I agree with that I
[13:31] believe in it I believe he's a spirit
[13:33] all right we know that we understand
[13:36] that but my point is that we lock down
[13:39] on that a lot of times and we don't try
[13:42] to go on to get an understanding and uh
[13:48] you know and that to me I believe that's
[13:51] why God had to send us a prophet cuz we
[13:53] were already reading the scripture that
[13:55] says God is a spirit amen but you know
[13:59] we we we did you know and I wonder today
[14:02] still how many people still just think
[14:07] about God as a spirit that there's no
[14:09] form to him he's just you know he's just
[14:12] well what do you mean he's just
[14:14] everwhere but brother Brandon said he
[14:17] wasn't just everywhere amen we'll read
[14:19] that in a minute he's a
[14:22] being he's not like the
[14:26] wind right and see that's what I've
[14:28] tried to get get you to to think on and
[14:31] and and get you to consider the fact of
[14:34] how come we believe Hebrews
[14:38] 13:8 that it's Jesus Christ the same
[14:41] yesterday today and forever do you
[14:43] believe that just because brother
[14:45] brandham said
[14:46] it now let me go on further do you
[14:49] believe that just because the Bible said
[14:53] it or have you had a personal experience
[14:57] with him as your your lord and savior to
[15:01] where that you know he's the same amen
[15:05] that's why I went through all of that
[15:07] doings of trying to talk about that
[15:09] every person's ever born again is born
[15:11] again the same same way just like every
[15:13] baby is born naturally normal babies are
[15:16] born the same way all right and see then
[15:19] following that we can see that whatever
[15:22] he was he still is amen and whatever he
[15:26] will be he's already that right right he
[15:29] may not have made it
[15:32] manifest that's a whole lot different
[15:36] but it's to talking about well well
[15:38] brother Dale I just can't see that
[15:40] because I I just can't see uh the way
[15:43] you think that God is
[15:45] real you know well what do you
[15:50] think you mean as I keep saying to you
[15:53] you I mean he created
[15:56] us but he's not more real than we are
[16:00] right yeah but but he's real in his own
[16:05] way what kind of
[16:08] way what is
[16:10] it you
[16:13] know see that's where I've been trying
[16:16] to just lay that down to where to let us
[16:19] think about it and I keep saying it that
[16:22] God never gained any
[16:24] attributes right after coming into the
[16:27] world right if you did he
[16:30] changed something went wrong and he said
[16:33] I'm God and I Chang not all right see
[16:36] then it can't be something that has
[16:39] changed it can be more
[16:43] understanding of he that has already
[16:46] been but not something to change to
[16:49] another way or something that's just
[16:52] words that's terminologies that's a way
[16:55] of God doing things to contact the human
[16:58] mind
[16:59] all right and the one thing that I
[17:01] wanted to make sure that you followed me
[17:04] you know at least whether you believe it
[17:06] or not that's up to you because I can't
[17:09] reveal it and there's no need of me
[17:11] trying to uh but to me see I know our
[17:17] thoughts used to link even after we were
[17:19] coming into the message and we we we
[17:22] would link it together as there was just
[17:24] this you know self-existing
[17:29] this great Eternal and we just know
[17:31] nothing about
[17:34] him is that the way you
[17:37] thought we know nothing about him
[17:40] because he's just a great Eternal he's
[17:43] just like the wind just blowing he's a
[17:46] spirit he's just
[17:49] doing is that as far as we can
[17:54] go by trying to understand about the
[17:57] eternal
[18:00] that's why I tried to make that
[18:02] statement Sunday enough to where we
[18:04] would understand that we think and I
[18:07] know I did that's the way I thought I
[18:10] thought you you you just see
[18:12] nothings there nothing you know and then
[18:16] all at once something comes into being
[18:18] that's created and as it comes into
[18:21] being you know then I can start thinking
[18:24] about uh the word the logos the speech
[18:29] to you know the great theophany because
[18:31] we'd learned those words and we thought
[18:34] we knew what we were talking about
[18:37] right and then we would bring that down
[18:40] toward human
[18:42] flesh and we would try to even make the
[18:45] reality of Christ the flesh the body of
[18:48] Jesus to be more real than just be a
[18:52] spiritual
[18:53] form
[18:56] well I I don't I don't get
[18:59] that see I mean if I'm wrong on what I
[19:02] see in the godhead I've at least told
[19:05] you it's not something oh I've got this
[19:08] great Revelation but I just can't
[19:10] explain it to
[19:13] you well shut up blabbering because all
[19:16] you're doing is confusing
[19:18] people you ever seen people do that I
[19:21] got it right here I got it right here
[19:23] but I can't explain
[19:25] it well throw that out the door you
[19:28] can't explain it at least enough to be
[19:30] able to comprehend a little bit you know
[19:33] I can't
[19:36] explain that a a brown cow eats green
[19:39] Grace and gives white milk and you Churn
[19:41] it and it turns into yellow butter I
[19:43] can't explain that but I know it
[19:46] happens and I'm not going to stop
[19:48] drinking the milk or eating the butter
[19:51] amen so why can't we do that on
[19:53] understanding
[19:55] God and see if you've seen what I was
[19:57] trying to bring
[19:59] Sunday the he was more real back there
[20:04] than what we can see him as being real
[20:05] now amen or else where is your
[20:12] god what is your
[20:15] thinking remember he condescended for us
[20:19] to
[20:20] understand condescending means to come
[20:23] down in forms to where we can
[20:27] comprehend but see we had it as going
[20:29] from nothing upward to try to get us to
[20:35] understand no no brother de BL that's
[20:38] that's the best way for me to say
[20:41] it but you see I believe he's real and
[20:44] when that Prophet began to talk about
[20:47] God as he saw
[20:51] him I believe he's
[20:55] real I don't believe he's just a myth
[20:58] Oles right I don't believe it's a
[21:00] Doctrine and an idea is that all this
[21:03] message
[21:05] is you know some different way of
[21:10] explaining
[21:12] things a better way of explaining it
[21:15] maybe is it that or is it the revealing
[21:19] of the Eternal
[21:24] God see then what do you think about it
[21:29] when you go back to say well he was just
[21:32] self-existing
[21:35] he existed
[21:39] alone all right I believe that but you
[21:42] know when he existed
[21:44] alone in our
[21:47] terminologies we're really confused
[21:50] because he existed alone but within him
[21:53] he had all the
[21:56] attributes he was a Healer he was a
[21:59] savior right right he just hadn't
[22:02] displayed it that's right well now may I
[22:04] say it this way for you to think about
[22:07] it at the same time he was a Healer and
[22:10] a savior you know what that would make
[22:13] him then make him Father Son and Holy
[22:21] Ghost
[22:22] right the trunity of God not the Trinity
[22:25] of God the triun of
[22:30] God are you going to make him pick up
[22:32] those things on the way down you know in
[22:36] you're
[22:39] condescending see the way I see
[22:41] condescending it means there something a
[22:43] whole lot more greater and as it begins
[22:46] to come down I can begin to comprehend
[22:50] it and then when it gets to hear in the
[22:53] New Birth we start going back the other
[22:57] way of of understanding the things of
[23:01] God and that's why it takes the new
[23:07] birth see we can't understand it just by
[23:09] head knowledge and quotes and ideas it
[23:13] is just another concept or a thought or
[23:15] a Doctrine if there's not a personal
[23:18] experience
[23:21] involved and see that's what I mean when
[23:23] I say and read what brother Brown said
[23:26] he said when you can't be saved he said
[23:28] without a
[23:31] revelation you can't be saved without
[23:33] faith
[23:37] amen what is the new birth brother
[23:40] Brandon he said the revelation of Jesus
[23:42] Christ personally to
[23:45] you amen that's right he doesn't reveal
[23:49] himself in a group Theology of a group
[23:53] therapy right you know this is not a
[23:55] group therapy we're individuals
[23:58] everybody in the in the body of Christ
[24:00] is an
[24:03] individual it's not to just say well so
[24:06] and so believes it so I believe
[24:07] it we better get away from the day
[24:10] Grandma believed
[24:12] it come on we're not against grandma she
[24:15] was wonderful and done what she' done
[24:17] but you know grandma taught you a
[24:19] Trinity
[24:21] right Grandma taught you hell was
[24:23] eternal yeah grandma taught you a lot of
[24:26] things that ain't in the
[24:30] Bible I don't love if you throw off on
[24:32] my grandma like
[24:33] that I'm talking about mine so you
[24:36] forget yours
[24:40] okay but see if we don't see him as to
[24:44] be real what do we see God is to
[24:49] be you know what's our
[24:52] ideas what's our thoughts I gave you
[24:55] these word that I've had these you know
[24:57] I've used them a lot in the message
[24:59] coming down but let's just read some and
[25:01] we'll read pretty fast because you got
[25:03] the the the ability to read with me and
[25:06] and let's let's go ahead and start
[25:08] number one brothers and
[25:11] uh it's from the message it wasn't so
[25:13] from the beginning preach
[25:19] 1960 and watch what he said now God is
[25:23] omnipotent
[25:24] omnipresent by being omniscient
[25:28] see now he's
[25:30] omnipotent he's
[25:32] omnipresent but we know he's not
[25:35] omnipresent outside of the point of
[25:37] being
[25:38] omnipotent right because he's not
[25:41] omnipresent because he's a
[25:44] being and a being is not an omnipresent
[25:47] all over the
[25:50] world all right you remember that makes
[25:54] him Omni president he being omniscient
[25:57] makes him om depress he knows all things
[26:00] but God could not be just like the Aras
[26:02] because God has a dwelling place right
[26:07] man God is not a myth God is a being God
[26:11] Jesus he God pronoun he is a being
[26:15] therefore he's omniscient omnipresent
[26:19] omnipotent and
[26:21] infinite but he's got a Dwelling
[26:24] Place
[26:26] amen have you ever thought about back
[26:28] before this world come into existence
[26:31] where did God
[26:36] dwell well he was just just um he was
[26:40] just floating like well see if you do it
[26:42] that way you you ain't got to make no
[26:45] place but now if you're going to believe
[26:47] God is a being and not like the wind
[26:50] you're going to have to start someday
[26:53] believing that he just didn't become
[26:56] tangible as the journey come along but
[27:00] that he was tangible before the journey
[27:03] started well where was he at what okay
[27:06] we'll let your Prophet answer it cuz he
[27:08] just answered it right there he says God
[27:11] has a Dwelling
[27:14] Place well now brother what he means is
[27:17] God has a dwelling place
[27:19] now well now you're interpreting so go
[27:21] ahead look at the next one who is this
[27:26] MDC and look what he
[27:30] says drop on down safe time we'll get
[27:32] back to these later paragraph 49 and if
[27:35] he isn't infinite he isn't God God has
[27:37] to be infinite we are we are finite he
[27:41] is infinite and he was
[27:43] omnipresent omnicient and
[27:46] omnipotent if he isn't then he can't be
[27:50] God knows all things all places because
[27:53] of his
[27:54] omnipresent omnicient makes him an
[27:56] omnipresent he is a being he's not like
[28:00] the wind he is a being he dwells in a
[28:03] house but being omniscient knowing all
[28:06] things makes him omnipresent because he
[28:09] know everything that's going on but he's
[28:12] a being he dwells in a
[28:18] house well brother that work with that
[28:21] house well let's use the term that we'll
[28:23] use later on in the message that the
[28:25] prophet us it let's just call it Heaven
[28:28] that's right
[28:30] okay to just get it away from trying to
[28:33] make whatever you want to try to do
[28:36] let's just call it Heaven because you're
[28:38] going to find out in a minute that's
[28:39] what your Prophet says all
[28:46] right he's got a Dwelling Place he dwelt
[28:50] in a dwelling place before this world
[28:51] ever begun
[28:56] am
[28:57] now you better remember one
[29:01] thing
[29:03] that before this world according to your
[29:06] Prophet what did he say was the first
[29:10] creation Angels right
[29:14] right am I right now he said Angels is
[29:18] his first
[29:19] creation well now Angels were created
[29:21] before the world ever created so where
[29:24] were they and where were they doing what
[29:25] were they doing
[29:28] I'm talking about back before this world
[29:30] ever
[29:32] begun I know that requires thinking and
[29:35] it mean a point A lot of times too that
[29:37] a lot of people's never heard it that
[29:41] way because it just go along with the
[29:43] ideas and concept but where's your ideas
[29:45] and concept with the Bible and the
[29:46] message right for 40 something years
[29:49] that's been my ideas and
[29:52] concept if he made Angels before he made
[29:55] the world then where did they stay where
[29:57] were
[30:05] they do you
[30:07] follow look at the next one number three
[30:11] which is actually called fellowship e19
[30:14] and he's while they bringing it up he
[30:16] said he was talking to somebody and he
[30:18] told the person he said uh I said God is
[30:20] a
[30:21] being now God's just not like you're
[30:24] like the Arab if he would you would
[30:27] never have to seek the Holy Ghost it
[30:29] would be in you because he'd fill all
[30:31] space and things God's omnipresent sure
[30:36] by being omniscient knowing all things
[30:39] but God has a dwelling
[30:41] place because he is a being right
[30:45] exactly right and God dwells with
[30:48] fellowship with us now under the shed
[30:50] blood of Jesus Christ I didn't give them
[30:52] these because I I don't give you
[30:54] everything because it just continually
[30:56] reading
[30:58] but on paragraph 38 of things that are
[31:00] to be be 1965
[31:02] 1205 he said he's a being he just isn't
[31:06] a myth he even
[31:11] dwells in a
[31:16] house a place called
[31:20] Heaven e50
[31:23] e352 Fellowship preaching 62 there is a
[31:26] certain place called Heaven that's where
[31:30] he's dwelling that's the point of what
[31:31] he's right and you know where he calls
[31:33] that from and brother random was in the
[31:38] Bible where are you going to go in the
[31:40] Bible then brother Dale to bring
[31:41] something up as to being before before
[31:44] that we
[31:45] uh start our journey downward to make us
[31:50] all right let's go with what he's
[31:52] saying God dwells in a house he dwells
[31:56] in a place he has a dwelling place it's
[31:58] called Heaven Y and you know the
[32:01] scripture he
[32:02] gave in my father's house are many
[32:06] mansions if it were not so I would have
[32:08] told you I go to prepare a place for
[32:13] you so before this world ever come into
[32:16] any form of
[32:18] being God already
[32:20] existed God already was there he already
[32:23] had a Dwelling
[32:26] Place and he' already created the Angels
[32:29] before this world was ever thought about
[32:31] come or ever came into being in Genesis
[32:35] one look at the next
[32:38] one I love this one this is M this is
[32:41] number four
[32:42] brothers this is a message of adoption
[32:45] and look what he
[32:47] says that is he's not only is he
[32:50] infinite he's omniscient he knows
[32:53] everything but he is a being God is a to
[32:57] being and out of this being begin to
[33:01] bring forth
[33:02] these out of this
[33:06] being but Brother D you mean do you
[33:09] think that God before the world was real
[33:11] in the terminologies of our human word
[33:13] real no no no no he was more real than
[33:17] our terminology of the word real amen
[33:21] that's
[33:23] right he was more real than what we
[33:25] think about being real
[33:29] well you sound like some
[33:31] extraterrestrial place or some place I
[33:34] well what do you explain it as it's
[33:37] called
[33:40] Heaven it's a house the prophet would
[33:42] call
[33:43] it
[33:47] sir so what do you think about
[33:53] it see we only want to dwell with what
[33:56] comes on down into Earth
[33:58] Earth and that's why I've tried my best
[34:01] to get you to see the the real truth of
[34:03] one God in the bases of because
[34:07] according to my Bible it says that he
[34:10] was born Lord the Christ he was born the
[34:13] Messiah it warn Emmanuel that's right
[34:17] you know y all
[34:19] right then if that be true the body yes
[34:23] was a creation by the
[34:25] word
[34:28] but when that body Dro from the wound of
[34:31] Mary and come into
[34:34] being God himself amen not another
[34:38] person amen God himself stepped into
[34:42] that
[34:44] body of course the way they want it now
[34:46] you can't get him to be God until he's
[34:48] 33 on on or about 30 on the River Jordan
[34:52] of all these doctrines
[34:55] now but where you going to put it
[34:57] together with anything that's truthful
[34:59] in the Bible that's right but you know
[35:00] that's what everybody wants they don't
[35:02] want the
[35:03] truth they want some concept that keeps
[35:05] jangling it around that requires no
[35:09] understanding no
[35:14] Revelation that spirit and that soul of
[35:18] almighty God dropped into that body
[35:21] right
[35:24] amen don't you believe he had eternal
[35:26] life in his soul
[35:28] amen don't you believe that that inward
[35:30] part of him was eternal
[35:34] amen watch it when we get on over in the
[35:37] message a
[35:38] little when brother randam talks
[35:41] about that and the scripture declares it
[35:45] that you can't tempt
[35:50] God but Jesus could be
[35:54] tempted the flesh man right could be
[35:59] tempted who was that one brother Dale
[36:02] that you think about and talk
[36:05] about I thought your Prophet said it was
[36:07] little
[36:08] Jehovah crying in a
[36:11] cradle you're god with no
[36:17] teeth now what was he referring to the
[36:21] body was a
[36:25] creation but that Soul and Spirit was
[36:28] not a
[36:31] creation he was almighty God or yet he
[36:34] was or else he wasn't God
[36:38] then if that spirit that came into him
[36:41] was just a human spirit and that Soul
[36:45] just a human formed Soul then we have no
[36:48] savior amen right yes he is not Our
[36:51] Redeemer that's he not to be made Our
[36:54] Redeemer and made our savior
[36:58] avor but he's not right he just couldn't
[37:02] pay the
[37:04] price he was born the
[37:07] Messiah but he couldn't manifest being
[37:10] the Messiah
[37:12] right he was born Lord the Christ right
[37:16] the Christ he was born that he was born
[37:18] because it was God y right
[37:23] amen do you understand what I'm what I'm
[37:26] trying to say
[37:28] right he's this is not
[37:31] mythologies that's
[37:34] right this is talking about about a
[37:45] reality brother BR said either he was
[37:48] God or what did he
[37:50] say are the biggest
[37:53] deceiver that has ever been
[38:00] but around the world today they're
[38:02] rejoicing about Jesus wouldn't god Till
[38:04] The River
[38:06] Jordan I know the quotes I don't worry
[38:09] about
[38:10] it I'll go along with a point if they
[38:12] keep it in the right
[38:14] way he became then totally the fullness
[38:17] of the godhead bodily on the River
[38:19] Jordan yes but he was born Lord the
[38:23] Christ he's just come into manifestation
[38:25] there cuz he was born to fullness right
[38:28] amen he was born the all in all sir
[38:38] amen you see why did you know I I get
[38:41] something I think well I just go on to
[38:43] questions and answers and just the whole
[38:46] week it just uh don't do
[38:49] it it won't work so I rewrote rewrote
[38:52] rewrote finally stopped
[38:55] writing
[38:57] I said I'll just let the prophet say it
[39:00] and then they can argue about whatever
[39:01] they want to maybe this is somebody on
[39:03] the internet maybe it's whatever I don't
[39:05] know maybe it's
[39:08] me I have no
[39:11] problems I just try to bring you what's
[39:13] on my
[39:15] heart because that's the only place I
[39:17] can preach from outside of that I'm
[39:19] preaching for somebody else's mind or in
[39:25] intelligence I believe in a reality of
[39:29] true Living God Amen that's right well
[39:34] let see
[39:38] him anybody in the building want to see
[39:41] him just turn around and take a
[39:48] look right that's right yes
[39:53] sir because we're either a Christian or
[39:56] we're we're not a Christian and if we're
[39:58] a Christian we're God in human
[40:02] flesh that's right so now that's your
[40:05] choice but do you see what I'm talking
[40:10] about he condescended down to be that
[40:14] baby right
[40:19] yep
[40:21] right when that baby dropped from the
[40:25] wound was Soul into the Spirit came into
[40:27] that body and there was almighty
[40:31] God now that's not
[40:37] Oneness because in that body was Father
[40:39] Son and Holy
[40:41] Ghost the trunity of
[40:44] God not the Trinity the trunity of
[40:47] God but
[40:50] look look what he says go ahead to
[40:53] number
[40:55] five look what what he said on God keeps
[40:57] his word
[41:01] 57 while I bring it up I'll start
[41:03] reading I believe that Jesus is the son
[41:06] of God I believe that in in body he was
[41:08] a man he was born of a woman just like I
[41:11] was but his blood was not a woman it was
[41:15] of God and Jehovah God the Loos who
[41:17] brewed over the Earth in my message this
[41:19] morning and brewed the first man Out of
[41:21] the Dust of the earth overshadowed Mary
[41:24] and brewed over her to fulfill his word
[41:26] word and created the blood cell that
[41:28] brought forth the son of the Living God
[41:31] I believe in body he was a man all right
[41:35] I believe in his
[41:37] soul he was
[41:39] God it was God's manifestation here on
[41:43] Earth God was in Christ reconciling the
[41:45] world reconcile him the world to himself
[41:48] I believe that he was not just a mere
[41:50] man neither was he a
[41:53] prophet he was God Emmanuel
[41:57] I
[41:58] believe with all my heart that being
[42:04] truth in body he was a man in Soul he
[42:08] was God look at the next one Conference
[42:13] 1959 see he thirsted like a man he's
[42:16] talking about how he was doing he was a
[42:19] man in body he was a man in spirit he
[42:22] was God God dwelt in Christ reconcil the
[42:25] world to
[42:28] himself God came down y right you
[42:32] remember he didn't send a son right he
[42:36] came himself
[42:39] amen so when he came into the world what
[42:41] was he God himself that's why brother
[42:44] randam and I gave you these the other
[42:46] day that we can we can go on to what on
[42:48] the message in tun number seven what did
[42:50] he
[42:52] say his soul his Spirit his is theophany
[42:57] of his own
[42:59] being you didn't have no problem putting
[43:01] Soul spirit theophany being
[43:06] together because what is a soul it's
[43:15] you think about
[43:20] it did he have that theophany body
[43:24] number eight go ahead adoption
[43:27] and Paul said it does not yet appear
[43:28] just exactly what kind of a body we'll
[43:31] have but we know we'll have a body
[43:34] like he
[43:36] is what did he ever have that theophany
[43:40] body yes sir when he died the Bible said
[43:43] he a personal pronoun again he went to
[43:45] hell and preached to the souls in prison
[43:47] hallelujah how did he do it he had
[43:49] senses of feeling he had senses of
[43:52] hearing he had senses of speech he
[43:54] preached with the same kind kind of body
[43:57] I saw those glorified ones in the other
[44:00] night and he preached to the souls that
[44:02] were in hell that repented not in the
[44:04] longsuffering the days of Noah so what
[44:07] went
[44:09] there his
[44:13] soul is
[44:15] being is
[44:17] theophany the spirit of God you can call
[44:22] it well because it was was him all right
[44:28] are you following
[44:30] me when he went down to those people
[44:33] what kind of a body were they in go
[44:35] ahead number
[44:37] nine which is questions and answers on
[44:41] Hebrews I'll not leave my soul in Hell
[44:44] neither will I suffer the only one to
[44:45] see corruption about that here his body
[44:50] was in the grave and his soul was in
[44:52] Hell preaching alive what about that he
[44:55] was in his the again his soul was down
[44:58] there with those people that were in
[45:00] theophany
[45:02] also now watch you and was witnessing to
[45:06] them that they repented not in the
[45:10] longsuffering you can move him over real
[45:12] easy to Abraham Isaac you know the ones
[45:15] in there right but he ain't saying
[45:19] that he saying they were in their
[45:22] theophany you but brother Dale that's
[45:24] what I'm we'll get to later on I got to
[45:27] cover one more thing then Sunday we'll
[45:29] get to that so you think your theophan
[45:31] is up in
[45:34] heaven well we'll get to and go through
[45:39] it I believe that
[45:42] theophany is the soul of the Lord Jesus
[45:48] Christ and for us to ever be born again
[45:52] we're going to have to have that new
[45:53] birth that's right amen and that means
[45:56] then our soul will be made
[46:00] Eternal but a sinner also has a body to
[46:03] go
[46:06] to he's not just floating around he's a
[46:08] soul under the altar I mean souls in
[46:14] prison see the
[46:16] reality
[46:19] look he was witnessing to
[46:21] them in other words he knocked at the
[46:24] door now he's moving from this group of
[46:26] people to another group of people right
[46:29] got remember he done that you remember
[46:30] he went to hell he come back up do I
[46:32] need to get that from the prophet he
[46:34] came back up by Paradise you can't put
[46:37] hell in Paradise together he came back
[46:40] up you remember he kicked Satan over in
[46:43] the pit came back up all right in other
[46:46] words he knocked at the door and when
[46:48] the door swung open and all those Souls
[46:51] that repented what about these up here
[46:53] repented not
[46:56] these soul that repented he said I'm the
[46:59] seed of the woman I'm the one that Enoch
[47:01] over in Paradise another place he said
[47:04] don't get all them messed up what was
[47:10] it did God ever have a
[47:15] body at least you can see that he had a
[47:17] theophany
[47:20] body we I no problems with that look at
[47:22] the next
[47:24] one which is the in tment paragraph
[47:28] 50 we know that in him dwelt the
[47:31] fullness of the godhead bodily the
[47:33] entire godhead was in him he was both
[47:35] Father Son and Holy Ghost but dwelt in a
[47:37] human form the theophany of God the
[47:40] great image of God that he made man in
[47:43] then placed him in the earth he had a
[47:46] body God isn't without a body God's got
[47:50] a body and it looks like a
[47:54] man Moses saw it others saw it and it
[47:58] looks like a
[48:00] man you got to agree that he had to the
[48:03] off
[48:06] anybody why not just go on and think
[48:09] about how real God really
[48:12] is
[48:16] amen what was he let's
[48:21] see yeah let's look at the next one look
[48:25] at number 11 and think about this
[48:28] theophany okay and it was the theophany
[48:31] of God that went out in the human form
[48:33] that didn't have eyes like you see watch
[48:37] a better
[48:38] eye it didn't have ears like you hear
[48:41] but a far more hearing it was a
[48:44] theophany and all this rainbow
[48:46] condescended into theophany Moses saw it
[48:48] when it passed through the rock like
[48:50] that he saw the back Parts he said it
[48:53] looked like a
[48:54] man
[48:58] so then you're going to have to
[49:00] agree that the theophany is a
[49:04] body amen right and to agree in that it
[49:07] being a
[49:08] body what kind of a body are you talking
[49:13] about that's what I was trying to get
[49:14] too Sunday for us to
[49:16] see go ahead to number 12 who is this
[49:20] Mel eddi then we'll we'll get down to
[49:23] the part we want to cover so this is
[49:26] paragraph 55-56 now of who is this melch
[49:30] now notice his attribute then the
[49:32] attributes was first God the thought the
[49:35] attribute itself all in one without
[49:37] being expressed then when he expressed
[49:39] secondarily he became the the word and
[49:43] then the word was made flesh and dwelt
[49:44] Among Us St John the first chapter the
[49:46] first verse notice this is in the
[49:49] beginning but before the Eternal that's
[49:52] wonderful isn't it notice in the
[49:54] beginning was the word
[49:56] when the time began it was word but
[49:58] before it was word it was attribute of
[50:00] thought then it was expressed in the
[50:02] beginning was the expression in other
[50:05] words you know yourself what brother
[50:06] Brown has said he said God standing
[50:09] there and said in his great mind he sees
[50:13] what he's going to
[50:15] do instead he simply says Let There
[50:20] be all right now we went through a whole
[50:24] bunch of services is to prove that Jesus
[50:29] was Jesus Christ is the Creator
[50:35] God right Colossians 1 Hebrews 1 John 1
[50:39] Ephesians 3 and9 all things were created
[50:42] by who Jesus Christ not Jesus the flesh
[50:46] Jesus Christ and if there was not
[50:48] anything
[50:49] made that's right without him making it
[50:53] amen but brother Dale you're putting
[50:55] Jesus I didn't put Jesus the flesh back
[50:58] there I made that emphatically for 40
[51:01] years it wasn't the Jesus the flesh
[51:04] standing back
[51:06] there it was Jesus the word God
[51:10] himself cuz there's just one true and
[51:12] living God like look what he's saying in
[51:15] the beginning
[51:16] expression when it uh in the beginning
[51:19] was the word when the time began it was
[51:21] word before it was word it was attribute
[51:23] of thought and Express in the beginning
[51:24] was the expression the word and we're
[51:27] getting where mesic
[51:30] is that's this mysterious person in the
[51:33] beginning was the word and the Word was
[51:35] with God and the Word was God and then
[51:36] the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us
[51:38] hold that there now notice he his his
[51:42] being was Spirit God Supernatural all
[51:45] right the great Eternal second he begin
[51:47] to form himself towards flesh in a
[51:50] theophany is called the word a body this
[51:54] then is the state he was in when he met
[51:56] Abraham and was called mzc he was in the
[51:59] form of theophany now we'll get to that
[52:01] and prove it in a few minutes the Lord
[52:03] willing he was the word what is a
[52:06] theophany the word
[52:11] body a word
[52:14] body you see Jesus Christ came through
[52:18] that way as word body because Jesus
[52:22] Christ is the
[52:24] creator
[52:27] you got to tie your Bible together come
[52:29] on because according to Colossians 1
[52:31] John 1 Hebrews 1 all of it is pointing
[52:34] to the
[52:35] Creator that's why I said what I have
[52:38] and I always have believed it when he
[52:41] said who do Man say I the son of man
[52:44] am Peter and them couldn't understand
[52:47] that because it wasn't
[52:50] revealed
[52:53] right Peter said Thou Art the
[52:58] Christ the son of the Living
[53:03] God he said Upon This Rock Revelation
[53:07] I'll build my
[53:11] church let's build on the revelation of
[53:13] Jesus
[53:15] Christ that's why it was so valuable and
[53:18] so important it had to be it had to be a
[53:20] Prophet come back in the last
[53:22] days that's what I was speaking on a
[53:24] couple of weeks ago Ezekiel in the
[53:26] Valley of the dry bones without Ezekiel
[53:28] speaking to those Dry Bones it wouldn't
[53:31] matter they had to send you they had the
[53:33] flesh the bones was
[53:35] together but when Ezekiel spoke life
[53:39] came in
[53:41] too those Dry
[53:43] Bones I think folks you and I it's about
[53:47] time to start realizing how dry these
[53:50] old bones are you know what I mean by
[53:53] that our old d ational ideas and
[53:56] thoughts is dry bones to
[54:01] God it took a prophet to come if he
[54:05] hadn't said let there be a Rapture you
[54:07] go read the
[54:08] message that thrilled me when I saw it
[54:11] he said it has been spoken now let it be
[54:16] come to
[54:18] pass why did see that's why I preach so
[54:21] I do Church born as a prophet said by
[54:24] the Breath of
[54:27] God he's going to breathe and these
[54:30] bodies are going to
[54:31] be but it's not breathing like that that
[54:34] we have to wait for him to breathe when
[54:38] he spoke it that is the Breath of
[54:43] God the word of God coming out of the
[54:46] man's mouth don't make the man
[54:49] God it makes the God that was
[54:54] coming now here's the point we got to
[54:56] get
[54:58] to because you
[55:00] see in the message
[55:03] now the basics of the message
[55:07] people they they like the quote where
[55:09] brother Brown says you always was
[55:11] eternal I do too I like it put in the
[55:15] right order right amen they like those
[55:18] things because they think and people pre
[55:21] actually preach that we come into the
[55:22] world with eternal life
[55:31] now where do you get that from the
[55:33] prophet
[55:36] right but it was just
[55:40] predestinated
[55:43] all brother Brown said we had
[55:46] representation by
[55:49] predestination he said we had
[55:51] representation from
[55:54] predestination
[55:55] but remember then if representation is
[55:58] by predestination and representation is
[56:00] from predestination that means somebody
[56:03] else paid the price and we don't have
[56:05] anything to do with
[56:08] it you better remember that Adam came
[56:12] with Eve in
[56:15] him Eve didn't come first with Adam in
[56:21] her that's what you're
[56:23] saying they don't realize it but that's
[56:26] the
[56:28] doctrine well there so many quotes like
[56:31] I said take all the quotes read them
[56:33] listen to the message when brother
[56:35] brownon says you always was eternal just
[56:37] listen to what he says he said if you
[56:41] have eternal life tonight you always was
[56:46] eternal I agree with that
[56:49] 100% cuz my Bible says that that his
[56:52] seed remaineth in me and I cannot sin
[56:56] right but I know that I'm a sinner every
[57:02] day but I know the seed can't sin
[57:08] right but you don't believe you born
[57:10] with a seed in you a seed of
[57:12] representation from predestination right
[57:16] all I've asked is where was it
[57:19] at and how did he get
[57:22] there that's all I've asked this is
[57:25] going around the world if they want to
[57:27] listen to it come and explain it where's
[57:29] it
[57:34] at well I was born with this seed in me
[57:38] because the reason I was born with this
[57:39] seed in cuz I wasn't born like
[57:43] you you had never heard it t that if you
[57:46] was born from Adam's lineage you could
[57:49] be saved but if you was born from the
[57:51] Beast lineage you could not be saved
[57:55] now show me that in the Bible show me in
[57:58] the prophet's
[58:00] message show it to them in common
[58:04] sense lay aside all things it's common
[58:09] sense but see people don't want to talk
[58:11] to you like
[58:12] that I got this great Revelation this
[58:15] seed was in me I said okay where's the
[58:17] seed at was it in your body was in your
[58:19] spirit it was in your soul where was it
[58:22] at and after you get it all settled out
[58:24] are trying to make it somewhere then I'm
[58:26] going to give you a quote and let's see
[58:27] if you can swallow that one brother R
[58:29] said the seed was put in you before the
[58:33] foundation of the
[58:36] world now I believe it that way
[58:40] amen that's 1,00% correct right because
[58:45] before the foundation of the world he
[58:47] stood as a lamb
[58:49] slain and my name could be written in
[58:53] the Lamb's Book of Life
[58:55] and remember if it wasn't written there
[58:57] it never will be in
[59:01] there if it wouldn't written before the
[59:03] foundation of world so what about us as
[59:05] human beings
[59:07] then you've talked about God we talk
[59:10] about it we believe God is real believe
[59:13] God could condescend downward start so
[59:16] great until he was beyond all things of
[59:19] comprehensions of what we could think
[59:21] about him that there had to be a Heavens
[59:23] there had to be a place that they had to
[59:25] be Angels there they had to be all kind
[59:27] of things before the world ever
[59:36] started but what about you and
[59:40] I so I said that's what I said and I
[59:44] went back listen to the tape I said I
[59:45] got to do it cuz that's going to be
[59:47] hinging on something
[59:48] so hang on to it let's go ahead and do
[59:51] it let's I ask you to read who is this m
[59:53] chadic or listen to the tape I ask you
[59:56] to do that so why can't we do it you
[1:00:00] know it's all right we just finished up
[1:00:04] paragraph
[1:00:05] 55-57 and talk about his first being
[1:00:07] with Spirit God Supernatural the second
[1:00:10] he began to form himself toward flesh in
[1:00:12] a theophany it's called the word of body
[1:00:16] this is the state he was in when he made
[1:00:18] El met Abraham was called melic he was
[1:00:22] in the form of theophany
[1:00:25] now now pick up paragraph
[1:00:28] 67 flip over to number 13 and we'll read
[1:00:31] down through a good
[1:00:35] bit starting with paragraph 67 who is
[1:00:37] this Mel
[1:00:39] jezdic and I see the
[1:00:43] attribute sons of his
[1:00:46] Spirit have not yet entered into the
[1:00:49] word form
[1:00:52] body but if I come here with it in me
[1:00:57] I would be coming like
[1:01:00] Jesus remember we didn't come like
[1:01:08] Jesus he came straight from attribute
[1:01:11] thought Express word come down to the
[1:01:14] Old Testament as the theoy the word body
[1:01:17] that created all things through the
[1:01:19] prophets he stood on Earth as being
[1:01:22] Eternal Emmanuel
[1:01:25] God living in human
[1:01:27] flesh the soul the spirit of God entered
[1:01:30] into that baby and he walked forth and
[1:01:33] there was eternal life living in that
[1:01:35] Soul they could not kill that Soul they
[1:01:38] could not kill that Spirit right right
[1:01:41] they could
[1:01:42] only kill the
[1:01:44] body but don't worry about it he raised
[1:01:46] that up all
[1:01:48] right but you see we didn't get to come
[1:01:50] that
[1:01:53] way what what he says while we
[1:01:56] come see we see the attribute sons of
[1:01:59] his Spirit have not yet entered into the
[1:02:01] word formed body we haven't done it
[1:02:04] yet all right you say well we have the
[1:02:07] new
[1:02:08] birth you better hold on the scripture
[1:02:11] read that we have the
[1:02:14] earnest how would you like to have where
[1:02:16] brother Ram said your soul is not
[1:02:21] complete it only has the earnest
[1:02:25] sure a lot in the message
[1:02:28] folks
[1:02:30] look but at the ofne this body is
[1:02:33] subject to the word and Earnest waiting
[1:02:36] for the earnest change of the body okay
[1:02:39] we know that's going to happen now the
[1:02:41] difference between him and you as a son
[1:02:43] see we he was at the beginning the word
[1:02:46] and in morphe body he came in and lived
[1:02:48] in that in the person of mzc then later
[1:02:51] we heard no more of mzc because he
[1:02:53] became Jes Jesus Christ mzc was the
[1:02:56] priest but he became Jesus Christ now
[1:02:59] you bypass
[1:03:01] that okay because in that form he knowed
[1:03:06] all
[1:03:07] things y Jesus Christ right you have
[1:03:11] never been able to know that yet we're
[1:03:14] limited right all right you come like
[1:03:18] Adam like me you become from the
[1:03:21] attribute to the flesh to be tempted but
[1:03:24] when this life is finished here if this
[1:03:26] Earthly
[1:03:28] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[1:03:30] already waiting that's where we go that
[1:03:33] is the word then we can look back and
[1:03:36] see what we've done now we don't
[1:03:40] understand it we have never become the
[1:03:42] word we just become the flesh man not
[1:03:45] the word all right now that's explaining
[1:03:48] just the simple terminologies of
[1:03:53] mankind
[1:03:55] don't get so involved and run your mind
[1:03:57] over into but I'm Eternal and I have
[1:04:00] this and I've become we'll get to
[1:04:04] that just stay with me where I'm at we
[1:04:08] come into the world lost born in sin
[1:04:10] shaping in iniquity spouse my mother's
[1:04:13] wound a liar that's right amen where can
[1:04:16] you put eternal life in all of
[1:04:21] that and come on remember my stud
[1:04:25] if you come into the world with eternal
[1:04:27] life you don't need Jesus
[1:04:31] Christ what could he give you ackowledge
[1:04:35] that you were
[1:04:36] Eternal
[1:04:39] right I don't want a knowledge I want
[1:04:42] something real now you can play all you
[1:04:45] want to with knowledges I've been
[1:04:47] accused of being a knowledgeable person
[1:04:49] and in that knowledgeable person you're
[1:04:51] looking at is one thing for certain I
[1:04:54] want Jesus Christ as my savior he's my
[1:04:57] all and my all and I want that new birth
[1:05:00] with inside of me and not just some idea
[1:05:03] of
[1:05:05] mankind right sir am and watch what he
[1:05:09] said you see in order to stand
[1:05:10] Temptation you had to bypass the
[1:05:13] theophany
[1:05:15] okay
[1:05:17] y but but what I can't understand
[1:05:19] because you juggle it about because you
[1:05:21] talked about a sinner having a theophany
[1:05:23] i is talking about him having a body to
[1:05:25] go
[1:05:26] to cuz that's the fir form and words of
[1:05:29] the word
[1:05:33] theophany see we got to get down to
[1:05:35] where we can understand
[1:05:38] it that brother randam
[1:05:40] said before you was born again you had
[1:05:43] an
[1:05:45] undercurrent to you remember that that's
[1:05:49] right he said but after you're born
[1:05:51] again you start an upward Lord pull are
[1:05:55] current to you right all right we'll
[1:05:58] explain these as we go along but just
[1:06:00] hold on you had to come down here in
[1:06:04] flesh to be tempted by sin now watch my
[1:06:09] point the outside man of MDC could eat a
[1:06:16] calf the Inside Man was a theophany that
[1:06:19] didn't need nothing to
[1:06:21] eat theophanies don't eat
[1:06:26] see the outside of a man that walked on
[1:06:28] the shores of Galilee 2,000 years
[1:06:32] ago the outside part the flesh could be
[1:06:36] tempted
[1:06:38] right but the man that was inside of
[1:06:40] there couldn't be
[1:06:42] tempted man on the outside was hungry
[1:06:47] thirsty body dwindling away in the
[1:06:50] desert the Inside Man said when the
[1:06:53] devil says turn this and take this and
[1:06:56] do this the Inside Man spoke
[1:06:59] out through the outside man and
[1:07:04] says get behind
[1:07:07] me cuz he wasn't
[1:07:10] thirsty outside man was what was thirsty
[1:07:13] some of these days we'll understand so
[1:07:16] he come right down now watch it's
[1:07:18] talking about Jesus Christ so listen he
[1:07:20] come right down the regular line from
[1:07:22] attribute he he did the flesh Jesus the
[1:07:25] man the foundation World his name is put
[1:07:29] on the lamb book of life then from that
[1:07:32] he become the word the theophany that
[1:07:35] could appear disappear then he become
[1:07:37] flesh and return back again resurrected
[1:07:39] that same body in the glorified state or
[1:07:41] condition that's Jesus Christ right that
[1:07:43] ain't me and you all
[1:07:46] right but you by pass the theophany and
[1:07:50] become flesh man to be tempted by sin
[1:07:52] and then if this Earthly Ty Tabernacle
[1:07:54] is dissolve we have one already waiting
[1:07:56] we have not yet the bodies right we'll
[1:07:59] get into that more Sunday but look when
[1:08:02] this body receives the spirit of
[1:08:04] God The Immortal Life inside of you it
[1:08:09] throws this body in subjection to God
[1:08:12] throws your body into subjection look
[1:08:14] roll it on up we'll just get to the last
[1:08:16] part he's talking about there buried
[1:08:18] baptism you're a new creation in Christ
[1:08:20] Jesus subject to the spirit trying to
[1:08:23] live by the spirit of Jesus Christ all
[1:08:26] right how far did we
[1:08:32] get go ahead with the next
[1:08:37] one go this paragraph
[1:08:41] 76 now this body is subject to the
[1:08:44] spirit have not yet entered into the
[1:08:46] word
[1:08:48] form now what's he
[1:08:52] saying
[1:08:57] this body is subject to the
[1:09:00] spirit have not yet entered into the
[1:09:02] word
[1:09:03] form but we are still in the flesh form
[1:09:07] but subject to the word Death In the
[1:09:10] Flesh will take us
[1:09:12] there you drop dead right now Split
[1:09:15] Second you're already
[1:09:17] there
[1:09:20] right come
[1:09:22] on
[1:09:25] the word form is this right
[1:09:29] here the new birth is a birth of the
[1:09:31] word called
[1:09:32] Faith but the stature of a perfect man
[1:09:35] and then The Headstone coming is the
[1:09:38] word
[1:09:38] form you want to quote he said we become
[1:09:41] the word
[1:09:42] here
[1:09:44] right if we don't become the word here
[1:09:46] you know what that means we wouldn't
[1:09:47] have word there sensible roll it on
[1:09:51] up breathe the breath of life and need
[1:09:53] Scream out sure as a natural body being
[1:09:55] formed there's a spiritual body to
[1:09:57] receive it as soon as it gets there I
[1:09:58] agree with that then when a man is Born
[1:10:01] Again from Heaven he becomes a spirit
[1:10:04] baby in Christ and then when this robe
[1:10:06] of flesh is dropped there is a natural
[1:10:09] body what's what he calls it the the
[1:10:12] Natural Body theophany a body not made
[1:10:14] with hands neither born of a woman that
[1:10:16] we go to then that body returns back and
[1:10:18] picks up the glorified body that's the
[1:10:20] reason Jesus went to hell when he died
[1:10:22] he preached to the soul that were in
[1:10:24] prison turn back into that theophany oh
[1:10:27] marvelous thank God 2 Corinthians
[1:10:31] 51 if this
[1:10:33] Earthly body be
[1:10:35] dissolved this Earthly
[1:10:38] Tabernacle we have another
[1:10:41] one that's
[1:10:43] true
[1:10:46] right we
[1:10:48] do sure but is it up there
[1:10:52] waiting
[1:11:00] now
[1:11:03] remember don't pick up too many bodies
[1:11:06] as you're going through the studying of
[1:11:07] the
[1:11:09] message because in no reference
[1:11:12] whatsoever have I made tonight in any
[1:11:14] form talking about a word body that I
[1:11:18] was not talking about bringing that word
[1:11:21] into full
[1:11:22] manifestation because Jesus Christ was
[1:11:24] the word made
[1:11:26] flesh and before you and I get out of
[1:11:29] here somebody is going to be the word
[1:11:33] made flesh that's right not trying to
[1:11:37] make us Jesus Christ we ain't got to
[1:11:38] nothing worry about it back it's what we
[1:11:41] are so look what he said you see we
[1:11:46] have another
[1:11:48] one but is it up there or is it
[1:11:51] something that the minute you die
[1:11:54] you go
[1:11:56] there see we've bypassed that to come
[1:11:58] straight from God the attribute to flesh
[1:12:01] to be tempted and tested by sin like
[1:12:03] Adam did but when testing of his word
[1:12:05] his word is over then we are taken up to
[1:12:09] this body that was a prepared for us
[1:12:11] before the foundation of the world it is
[1:12:13] the word there that we skipped to come
[1:12:16] right around down here to be tempted and
[1:12:21] tested if we to have come true that y
[1:12:24] there'd have been no temptation that's
[1:12:26] right right now there's what I explained
[1:12:29] while IO did you hang on Jesus the
[1:12:33] outside man could be tempted right but
[1:12:36] the inside of the man couldn't be
[1:12:40] tempted
[1:12:41] mzd could stand there in human flesh the
[1:12:45] human flesh was eaten mesic was inside
[1:12:48] of it cuz there's your word body I know
[1:12:51] that blanks out okay
[1:12:54] that's the reason Jesus knowed all
[1:12:55] things because he was the word before he
[1:12:57] was
[1:12:58] flesh then we become the
[1:13:01] word here we are formed to the word
[1:13:03] image to be a partaker of the word feed
[1:13:07] on the word by being predestinated since
[1:13:10] the beginning you see that little spark
[1:13:12] of life that you had in you from the
[1:13:14] beginning when you started your
[1:13:17] journey but but but but Brother D that's
[1:13:20] that's all it's just a spark of life it
[1:13:23] it's something it's something that was
[1:13:24] in me I I just feel like it yeah and
[1:13:27] there was a guy named
[1:13:28] Napoleon that I hope they can see what
[1:13:31] I'm doing and sticking my hand in
[1:13:32] Napoleon you know he stood and he
[1:13:35] believed he was reincarnated from
[1:13:37] somewhere else do we believe in
[1:13:41] reincarnation brother randam says what
[1:13:44] 154 is that what it did Church age
[1:13:46] book he said I don't believe in the
[1:13:49] Mormon doctrine of pre-existence of
[1:13:51] souls neither do do I believe in
[1:13:56] reincarnation and he said I don't
[1:13:58] believe in
[1:13:59] transmigration
[1:14:02] y now have you ever looked up
[1:14:07] transmigration according to Webster
[1:14:10] transmigration means going from one body
[1:14:14] to another
[1:14:15] body and brother Brown didn't believe
[1:14:17] that
[1:14:19] amen so we better not believe it cuz
[1:14:22] Jesus never went from one body to
[1:14:24] another body but you see Jesus didn't
[1:14:27] need a new
[1:14:30] birth that's right because he always was
[1:14:35] eternal the soul was eternal but you and
[1:14:38] I needed a new birth that makes our soul
[1:14:45] Eternal that makes it to
[1:14:48] be
[1:14:51] that look at the last one
[1:14:55] One Number 15 go ahead
[1:14:59] brothers and after you recognize the
[1:15:01] word of God was eag food what is that
[1:15:04] the new birth can we sum that up by
[1:15:07] saying that that after you received the
[1:15:09] new
[1:15:12] birth then you're left the other
[1:15:16] thing you know You' died out to the
[1:15:18] world you gone from you have been formed
[1:15:21] into the living image of the Living
[1:15:24] God now watch what it said you
[1:15:29] heard
[1:15:30] from you're
[1:15:33] theophany there's a positive of God's
[1:15:37] mind look at the pyramid behind me and
[1:15:39] you look at it it is not negative to
[1:15:42] positive it's partial to perfect you
[1:15:43] start off the bottom of the Pyramid of
[1:15:45] faith and you come to the top of the up
[1:15:48] to the pyramid at top and it's called
[1:15:49] love which is Faith which is the baptism
[1:15:52] of the Holy Ghost and full full
[1:15:56] manifestation the day you was born
[1:15:59] again you heard from your
[1:16:03] theop you heard from a positive part of
[1:16:06] God that he had in his mind you and I
[1:16:09] would come
[1:16:12] to Martin
[1:16:17] Luther one day God spoke to a
[1:16:20] man he said to Joshua live by
[1:16:24] faith you know what that was part of the
[1:16:26] word right Luther heard from his
[1:16:31] theophany right but there was just no
[1:16:33] way he could bring together the thoughts
[1:16:36] and the ideas so he must pass
[1:16:40] on Wesley when sanctification come forth
[1:16:43] which was the word of God he heard from
[1:16:45] his theophany but there was no way he
[1:16:48] could
[1:16:52] comprehend isusa Street came forth with
[1:16:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother
[1:16:56] Brandon called it another great
[1:16:59] prophet of the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:04] Ghost they heard from their
[1:17:07] theophany because they were born again
[1:17:11] amen but they could never in no way to
[1:17:13] attain to that headstone because your
[1:17:15] Prophet said The Headstone hadn't come
[1:17:18] yet that's his
[1:17:22] words all
[1:17:25] right here comes a
[1:17:28] prophet to be able to stand and take the
[1:17:30] word of God and he said 30s something
[1:17:33] years before he could preach the statue
[1:17:36] of a perfect
[1:17:37] man that's in the message
[1:17:42] there yet he was preaching all around it
[1:17:45] and saying things like on the message
[1:17:47] interv where he talks about a living
[1:17:50] instrumentality of God walking on two
[1:17:52] feet
[1:17:54] he said I've been preaching these things
[1:17:56] but he said the other day I got this
[1:17:58] right here that ties it all
[1:18:01] together when he got into the seals he's
[1:18:04] refers back to the great message the
[1:18:07] stature of a perfect man when he gets
[1:18:10] over into the message bringing it he
[1:18:13] refers back constantly to the stature of
[1:18:16] a perfect
[1:18:20] man you see the day you got born again
[1:18:23] you heard from
[1:18:29] God but that's only the earnest of your
[1:18:32] inheritance until the Redemption of I
[1:18:35] quoting scripture of the purchased
[1:18:37] possession he paid the price for this
[1:18:40] right but he didn't claim it he's coming
[1:18:44] in his last days or may I restate that
[1:18:48] he came in this last days through the
[1:18:51] word or message of of this Prophet
[1:18:54] that's what I believe that he came
[1:18:57] through the message of this Prophet to
[1:18:59] claim these bodies you yeah but he died
[1:19:02] and went by the grave what's that got to
[1:19:03] do with it Jesus died
[1:19:05] too now don't don't make fun don't
[1:19:09] make Jesus
[1:19:14] died would you see
[1:19:18] church if the theophany is the word
[1:19:21] body
[1:19:23] see we by pass coming like Jesus because
[1:19:27] remember Jesus stood there and spoke the
[1:19:28] word Jesus Christ may I get it more
[1:19:31] correctly where won't be misunderstood
[1:19:33] Jesus Christ stood there and spoke the
[1:19:36] word of Let There Be Right had we come
[1:19:40] that way there would have been no
[1:19:42] temptation within that person but we
[1:19:45] bypass that
[1:19:47] part and even a born again believer who
[1:19:50] has eternal
[1:19:51] life dwelling within him by the new
[1:19:56] birth until that stature of a perfect
[1:19:59] man comes into
[1:20:01] being you've got the
[1:20:04] earnest of your
[1:20:07] inheritance I receive the Holy Ghost
[1:20:09] Brother D I got everything I want that
[1:20:11] in the Bible and I want it in the
[1:20:13] prophet's
[1:20:17] message the Bible says you got an
[1:20:21] Earnest the prophets said you got an
[1:20:25] Earnest a part payment
[1:20:30] y sure we bypassed what we should have
[1:20:33] come you realize that if Stan hadn't
[1:20:36] entered the picture what this thing
[1:20:38] would have
[1:20:39] done we would have come like Jesus
[1:20:42] that's
[1:20:43] right there's no need to talk about it
[1:20:45] because it didn't come that
[1:20:48] way cuz he could not display his
[1:20:50] attributes and the things that he
[1:20:52] desired as it to come that way but what
[1:20:54] if Satan had never entered the
[1:20:57] picture what if man had never fallen
[1:20:59] after the devil's
[1:21:07] life folks I'm glad I've
[1:21:10] heard from the Eternal
[1:21:13] God sir to come down at least enough to
[1:21:16] save my
[1:21:19] soul to give me his own life
[1:21:25] you can't become the word until you hear
[1:21:27] the
[1:21:29] word come on there was no way if you
[1:21:31] listen to what I said there was no way
[1:21:33] Luther could have done it no
[1:21:35] way Wesley could have done it no way
[1:21:38] Pentecost could have done listen now no
[1:21:40] way the great Apostle Paul could have
[1:21:44] ever attained unto that
[1:21:47] place or else why did he have to send a
[1:21:51] prophet
[1:21:54] if you think Paul could have attained
[1:21:55] then why did not he
[1:22:01] attain yes he spoke he prophesied but
[1:22:04] everything he prophesied never come to a
[1:22:07] reality he spoke of a change of the body
[1:22:10] a moment the twinkle of an eye he spoke
[1:22:12] of the corruptible becoming
[1:22:13] Incorruptible he spoke of those
[1:22:16] things but then he died and went by the
[1:22:19] grave but the Lord Jesus Christ spoke of
[1:22:22] the those things he went by the grave
[1:22:24] but he
[1:22:27] raised cuz death couldn't hold
[1:22:30] him why because he was the
[1:22:33] word and he'd already said it take this
[1:22:36] body do what you want to with it I'll
[1:22:38] raise it up in three
[1:22:41] days and it took
[1:22:45] place what about the real
[1:22:51] you
[1:22:53] as I said there's no need of thinking
[1:22:54] about it but you know sometimes it is
[1:22:56] good it is good to think about what is
[1:22:58] sin that never entered the
[1:23:01] picture wouldn't it be a wonderful place
[1:23:05] am but you know what in the soul of
[1:23:08] mankind by the new
[1:23:10] birth that position is already
[1:23:14] attained we are just waiting the
[1:23:16] Redemption of these bodies nothing been
[1:23:20] paid for it's a finished product
[1:23:24] but
[1:23:27] waiting is that the
[1:23:30] scripture
[1:23:35] waiting but at least we ought to be able
[1:23:37] to quote the scriptures where it says
[1:23:39] the last part is to wit the Redemption
[1:23:42] of our
[1:23:44] bodies look up that word to wit I know
[1:23:47] what it means it wits and all kind of
[1:23:49] but look it up and
[1:23:51] see
[1:23:53] is to
[1:23:55] understand you and I would have never
[1:23:57] understood nothing about these chains of
[1:23:59] the body or anything that we talk about
[1:24:02] had it not been for God sending a
[1:24:03] prophet to bring the word unto
[1:24:07] us thank God he kept his
[1:24:12] word you know what all he wants you and
[1:24:15] I to keep our
[1:24:19] word to believe him
[1:24:25] right come on
[1:24:26] Brothers come on
[1:24:29] musicians we bypass why because
[1:24:34] listen may I say this while they're
[1:24:37] coming down Atlanta there's a place
[1:24:39] called 285 I mean two u
[1:24:44] n what is it 285 going around
[1:24:48] Atlanta all right going around Atlanta
[1:24:51] it's called a b pass
[1:24:54] that just keeps you from going through
[1:24:55] the middle if you want to go
[1:24:58] around but you know
[1:25:00] what now let's swallow and listen for a
[1:25:04] second and you're going to think I'm
[1:25:06] trying to change brother Brandon but no
[1:25:08] you
[1:25:09] listen he said we bypass that we never
[1:25:13] come that
[1:25:17] way
[1:25:19] right that's how we bypast the theophany
[1:25:23] we never come that way that's
[1:25:29] right that's simple to
[1:25:31] me we never came that
[1:25:34] way so by doing that we came straight
[1:25:37] from
[1:25:38] atribute as he thought of us before the
[1:25:41] foundation of the world and as he
[1:25:42] thought of himself as being healer and
[1:25:44] savior and all of those things of
[1:25:49] attribute we never came that way
[1:25:57] that's
[1:25:59] bypassing is to never
[1:26:03] come not if not then where are you going
[1:26:06] with it what we got brother 229 my God
[1:26:10] is real
[1:26:15] amen the we never come that word body
[1:26:18] form there are some things but we become
[1:26:22] a child of God by the new
[1:26:27] birth we study the word we let the word
[1:26:30] come in
[1:26:31] us and mold us and make
[1:26:36] us sure we fight the devil on every
[1:26:44] hand every day we battle with him that
[1:26:48] God
[1:26:50] is you know what your prophet said to
[1:26:55] do he said just turn him
[1:27:00] down that's a hard thing to do isn't
[1:27:04] it just turn him down my God is real for
[1:27:09] he
[1:27:10] hased and made
[1:27:16] me we're going to believe for everything

[1:28:38] may they come forth with a
[1:28:39] testimony saying the healing of God and
[1:28:42] what it is and how he's taking care of
[1:28:45] things because we believe you father in
[1:28:47] Jesus
[1:28:49] name anybody else
[1:28:54] just how
[1:28:57] you when
[1:29:03] Jesus you remember that you remember
[1:29:07] when he first touched
[1:29:09] you you remember when you cried out God
[1:29:12] forgive me and a great burden of things
[1:29:15] was taken from
[1:29:19] you we just keep on going
[1:29:24] it's just more
[1:29:30] word we want to get it in a big
[1:29:34] hurry you know according to the pro
[1:29:37] prophet Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph laid
[1:29:40] the foundation the prophets built the
[1:29:43] body of the Lord
[1:29:45] Jesus it took almost 6,000
[1:29:50] years for them to do
[1:29:55] that yet we wanted this
[1:30:00] instantly are we the Seed of
[1:30:04] Abraham are we the Seed of
[1:30:08] Abraham Abraham waited 25
[1:30:12] years everything got worse and worse and
[1:30:15] worse and worse but he kept saying we're
[1:30:18] going to H the baby
[1:30:20] amen why cuz God told
[1:30:24] him God tells you something you don't
[1:30:26] have to worry about
[1:30:27] it I like what brother Brown said he
[1:30:30] said if if God told me to go was it
[1:30:32] George Washington what he said he told
[1:30:34] me to go way is George Washington he
[1:30:36] said I'd call the
[1:30:38] world tell them to be there in the
[1:30:40] morning cuz they going to see George
[1:30:42] Washington walk out of the
[1:30:44] Grave that's how much he believed
[1:30:48] it well why can't we believe it that
[1:30:53] way I never did read where the Bible
[1:30:55] said all things are possible to Jesus
[1:30:58] Christ and nobody
[1:31:00] else and then I and read that it was all
[1:31:02] things were possible to Jesus Christ and
[1:31:05] the prophets and nobody
[1:31:08] else I I thought it read that all things
[1:31:11] are possible to them that believe that's
[1:31:16] right won't you ask for it sometime
[1:31:19] that's you know that a lot of people are
[1:31:21] really afraid to
[1:31:22] pray you ever notice you go to pray for
[1:31:25] people and they don't want you to pray
[1:31:29] positive pray if there's any way maybe
[1:31:31] that that this can work out that the
[1:31:33] Lord can can do these things you know
[1:31:36] pray that's not
[1:31:41] positive when you pray in positive you
[1:31:43] say Thank You

[1:32:19] people how real you are
[1:32:22] and Lord we know and
[1:32:25] realize that us as human Mortals don't
[1:32:28] have any hopes
[1:32:31] whatsoever but yet you
[1:32:33] Lord can come on the scene and change
[1:32:36] that hope and make it a revelation and
