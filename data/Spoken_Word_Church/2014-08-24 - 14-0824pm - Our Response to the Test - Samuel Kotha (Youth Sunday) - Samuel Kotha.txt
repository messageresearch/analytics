i'd like to read verse 14 15 and 16. for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the lord sent rain upon the earth and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and he and her house did it many days and the battle of mill wasted not neither did the cruiserwell fail according to the word of the

and i was truly blessed and thank you for the response thank you for the you know saying amen to the word of god and brother branham as i said you know we must operate the gift and when we operate the gift god begin to you know work so i'm so thankful you know that uh the presence of the lord was here this morning and and i expect the same thing now and i would like to uh salute our young young men for what this did this evening i really appreciate them and i very proud of them we also have amen god bless them in our church in india the lord put it on my heart and we started last year and have every third wednesday dedicated for the children amen we cannot imagine what the little ones can do they come up with the scripture and they come and they just you know say it you know by by-hearted and brother it touches your heart amen and i was really blessed uh by the young man who stood and took care of the service and you know i can i can see future song leaders and i can see future preachers they're right in our midst this evening amen it's such a blessing to have a children like that and i believe they are they are pillars of this church in future amen and what a blessing it will be amen i would like to speak on our response to the test and i believe the bible speaks that every uh son that cometh to the lord must be proven must be chastised but we look into the story here this evening this afternoon my brothers my sisters uh you know this woman was obito and she just had a handful of meal and maybe a few drops of oil in her cruise and she was at the gate of that city you know uh trying to find some sticks and uh cooked the last meal last cake you know for her and for her son and they were getting ready to die and in this time you know a man comes to her um you know the prophet of god and the lord told him to come to this place and when when he came to that city and he began to talk to this woman and uh he said i'm thirsty can you give me a little water to drink and she turned and she as she was turned as she turned and as you as she was walking to get a little water for him to drink and he began to say you know i'm hungry too and it is quite a test for this woman brother branham says it was quite a test you know quite a trial uh a great trial for her faith and obedience you know she had to exercise her faith and she had to obey what this man has said and this prophet was a stranger to her actually she never saw him she never met him and and you know she had a lot of objections and reasonable objections we could say but you know when he began to talk to this uh this lady this widow she over came all her object objections and uh reasons and uh she had enough reasons to tell him i'm sorry she could have said sir i cannot do that i'm sorry but when the prophet began to speak to her something happened in her heart and he said this man is asking a piece of bread and you know and he's giving me an assurance that you know you go and you know no problem you got marshall of meal and you know few drops of oil in the cruise he said no problem that will be taken care but you go and make the first cake and bring it to me and that was quite a quite a task my brothers my sisters you know you know if we are in that kind of situation i don't know how we will react but thank god that this old widow you know uh i mean i don't mean that she was an old woman but you know uh this this woman you know being widow you know she began to think something positive yeah and i'm so glad that she did it and i believe this is a small lesson to our lives today you know when you listen to the word of god when you hear the word of god and the word of god speak to our hearts and i believe that's the time not only we hear the word of god but we receive it into our hearts and we try to do what the word of god told us to do that shows that we are taking that in a positive way and i believe my brothers my sister this woman you know she overcome her objections and she over you know overcome our reasonings and you know she took this prophet prophet's word and you know like the bible said seek ye first the kingdom of god and and its righteousness and then these all these things shall be added unto you and i believe as a children of god today this afternoon my brothers my sister our priority is seeking first the kingdom of god no matter what our circumstances are no matter what kind of situation we are surrounded by no matter what kind of uh you know difficulties we are going through but our priority in our lives must be jesus christ and if we can do that if we can place jesus if he can place god in number one place and brother you just keep watching what god does in our lives and and you know we are not surprised to see when she obeyed this prophet's word when she took this word of the prophet and she went into her house and she began to you know lit fire and and you know she began to begin to uh prepare a cake for this man of god and and as she was preparing maybe she turned a little back and and something she could feel and something she could see some kind of a special presence of god has come and surrounded her her kitchen and and she sees something different here and she goes and maybe looks at the at the barrel and he said ma he said the meal she can see the barrel full of meal and and cruise full of oil and it is about to overflow it and she may be such an you know she might be in such a big great excitement after seeing what god has done to her right and i believe my brother is my sister that he is same yesterday today and forever he can do that in our lives i have seen time after time time of the time god doing great things i've seen it personally in my life brother there was times you know i just couldn't move out of the house because my pockets were empty but god who is rich in mercy he knows how to provide for his children there were times in our house you know we come from a very poor family there was times you know my mother would you know say to my dad he said no there's nothing for the children and i see sometimes god dad's reaction and and mom's reaction you know and brother sister you know it's very difficult because there's nothing in the bank there's nothing in your pocket there's nothing in the house it's a difficult situation but right there in that kind of situation you may have may not have gone in that kind of situation but i've gone through that i've seen what it means to go hungry i know what it means to live in a poor conditions can you imagine we were born and brought up in 10 by 10 feet house 100 square feet that was our living room that was our bed that was our kitchen that was our everything but let me tell you we had jesus in there we we served god with all our hearts that 10 by 10 room never bothered us we played as children we fought and we did a lot of things but we were happy we were happy because god never you know took us you know in a place where we were hungry god always provided some or the other way god you know he bought somebody to the house he brought some person to the house sometimes you know daddy could walk and and you know you know has nothing and he could open the post office you know box and there was one letter there and somebody from this this country some precious brothers or sisters you know said brother prakash this is a little love offering for you to use for the for your family and for your ministry i've seen time after time i've seen god doing a lot of things like that and you know what god puts us in a place sometime he wants to test us he wants to see brother branham he says be certain of god and he said you know he loves to test us god loves to test us he loves what kind of a god he is he loves to test us he loves to see us sometimes panicking he loves to see us sometimes discouraged that's what happened when tests come you know we get panic sometimes we get so discouraged our heart breaks and and we look we're human beings isn't it but he loves to to put us in that place in that position and he said he loves to see the reaction of your faith he wants to see the reaction of your faith did you know that brethren says god likes to see how you will react right when you say oh lord i believe you about my savior i believe you you are my healer i believe you you are the one who gives the holy spirit and the things that i am requiring you are the god who gives me that and this but then when you confess all your sins and promise god what he will do if you he will let you get well and then become because it don't happen you run off like a covert somewhere god can't use that right there's no way for him to use you there's no way for him to answer you are you with me amen he cannot use us he cannot speak to us he cannot answer us because he only answers by faith amen in that kind of a tight position or circumstances you stand up and say in the name of the lord jesus christ i take over this situation and i'm trying i i'm i'm exercising my faith here no matter how much negative you may see in your life no matter no matter what doctor says right he may tell you you've got a few hours to die sometimes it does because it happened in my own family my mother she went through that you know since several years and several times doctor said you're going to die in 2009 he gave 15 days he said within 15 days she will go but thank god she was there for 2000 till 2014. doctors are not always true sometimes medical science is not always true most of the time you know praise the lord but god's word stands true praise the lord i like that statement he said if you run away like a coward and you know because just you didn't see what he wanted god to do and you know god takes time and as the as we have read he loves to see your reaction he loves to see how you respond to the situation he wants to see how you will deal with that situation you know he wants to see how you'll conduct yourself he said he only answers by faith then all of a sudden you go away and you can't answer but you know what he says the real faith stands there being sure that he is god the real faith will stand it will not move it will take any kind of pressure the faith will right may not our mind and body but the faith which god has given to us it will stand still the faith will take up challenge faith will say let me see what you can do let me see how much you can do let me see how far you can do right but i know inside my heart that i serve a living god and my god is always ready always present in the time of trouble he's a great help sometimes we think he's too late but he's never too late faith says being sure that is god the faith stands he said if god asked this thing to be done to confess your sins and so forth and you have done it faith says he that is it's certain that it's going to happen your request has to be granted he says if you are sure of god god's god is sure of his word he's only waiting to test you he's just keeping quiet for some time just to see how we respond right how we respond to the situation you know brother branham speaks about this the shenanight woman he said you know he wanted to see what her reaction would be he wanted to see what she will she will tell this man this stranger who have just come up in the mid-afternoon and say i'm thirsty and then he goes and he says i'm hungry not knowing a situation it happens isn't it sometimes it happened to us many times in india you know people here in america you need to call you need to take time you need to take appointment you just cannot walk into somebody's house india is not like that he just wants to come he feels like coming he just comes when he comes or when when somebody some people come the wives have to go inside and cook the food and make the things ready and bring it on the table on time that's the way the country of india is you know but you know not knowing a situation he said now i'm thirsty and then he says i'm hungry he said god he does that many times just to see how we will react but if we are certain that we have met god's requirement just stay right with it right amen now now you know to see the power of god you know working in our lives to see our faith is an action there is something we need to do is to meet god's requirement and i believe this lady this widow she obeyed god's voice brother it takes obedience today and you know what when you obey obedience being brings you know responsibility when we try to obey god's word it gives us responsibility to fulfill that word and this woman she obeyed the voice of god how much you know god will bless our our souls today if you can just take the word of god and just obey it god wants obeying people who will obey him today god wants somebody that will say yes lord i will do it god wants somebody who's looking for some people he said lord i'm here i'm ready to do whatever you want that's what he wants us from us today he said she you know we have met god's requirement just stay right with it he's got to act when we meet god's requirement god is obligated and he will act that's a wonderful thing isn't it you hear it he says he's got to act if he made a promise he's god and has to keep that promise he's god he just can't take it back and say well i was mistaken god makes no mistakes he's perfect and just can you imagine in these days people are trying to mist take mistakes from this and that but here the prophet of god you know there was somebody i don't know who i don't remember but somebody gave me a cd you know compiling a lot of ministers in the time of brother branham and brother branham was one of them a allen was there in that city you know and and people like that even even brother billy graham was was in that cd and you know they began to show a man of god after you know one after the other you know and and and and you see brother branham's ministry was very unique when i started watching that cd you know i could feel when i came to the last and and seen brother branham they begin to show the the prophetic ministry in our day and when i begin to watch and see he said nothing could match this man all these people because brother branham you know he was a human being like you and me but you know god was in that man and brother sister when brother branham stood and when he began to discern the lives of the people not one thing ever failed right and i i know and i i forgot the message i was trying to recollect and trying to you know search on my ipad you know there was there was a time i believe it was a lady if i'm not wrong brother branham gives her seventeen one seven things he begin to discern in her life and for everything she said yes that's true that's true one after the other 17 things not one two three seventeen i i would like to ask somebody today how many of that you know that kind of situation will make us to believe today how many we need in that particular message 17 things he spoke about that one person and he began to tell you know one after the other one after the other one and that lady or that man i don't know if i'm not wrong maybe it's a lady and she said yes sir that's true that's true that's true she never said no this is false glory we have seen the vindication of god we have seen the power of god brother even some of you in your life you might have tasted the power of god that miraculous power that god could bring miracle in our lives you know we are the greatest miracle today that we are saved the greatest miracle we are alive on this face of this earth today that's the greatest miracle what else we need to believe this message what else what more we need to trust this message just think about it she took the word of god and when she began to act god's eyes was saying what she was trying to do she never murdered she never said one word against the man sometimes you know uh there is a saying in in my language when it is a famine 13th month has come there are 12 months in a year but in a famine time 13th month when someone extra has come in so he was elijah was that kind of a situation now she already was in great trouble but here comes a man asking for water and a piece of bread and she took that word oh how i like that my brother's my sister and god put her to test that mid-afternoon and god began to watch her reaction and when god saw that she's doing exactly what the man of god said god began to multiply her blessings and i believe we can have that in our lives there was a preacher there is a preacher in india who preached about this elijah and the meal offering brother one sister a widow you might have all read that in that came in faith challenge several years before but you know what you know we seen that miracle that was for a certain time or maybe a month or two i don't remember exactly but you know she never had to buy a grocery i can tell you when you are faithful in paying tithes when you're faithful you know when you take the word of god and live according to it and when you are faithful in paying tithes and offerings when you are faithful to god god blesses you i can tell you my wife can testify about that there were times that i bring ration for this month and i don't have to bring for next month and next month god blesses that god multiplies that i've seen with my own eyes me and my wife we spoke several times said hey he said how long it's been we've never been any ration to groceries you know groceries in our home and she will go back and say oh it's about how about two three months or two and a half months what you bring groceries today and it goes up to two and a half months how it is possible well when god begins to multiply we don't realize it we don't see we don't recognize it sometimes but god always he's always keeps his way brother branham says you know she met every requirement she lived a clean she lived clean she had lived decent she had lived horrible she had met all god's requirement but look he was silent god does that sometimes to test you and to see what kind of reaction you will have don't forget it he will wait and wait and wait i remember the prophet saying story about the three hebrew children god had to just kept quiet of course he ever he had a conference in heaven but he had to keep quiet till they came to the last step and about the time they were about to pick up and and thrown into the into the fire there came the fourth one but he watched them till the last step i like that my brother's my sister we need to keep that faith until the last morning until we breathe last keep exercising that faith because god will honor your faith god will honor your honesty god will honor your sincerity right oh my it's such a wonderful thing brother branham speaking of job of the old testament he said when satan he said when our accuser accused him of being a secret sinner but job know that he had not sinned right he met god's requirement he know that he has confessed everything that he had done and put a bunt offering out there that was god's requirement that's all god required was that burnt offering and a confession and job done those things and satan he took away his camels his sheep he finally took his children that were closest to his heart brother he was devastated you talk about problems like paul says you know i was buffeted buffeted means a blow after a blow right you know ah a blow after a blow can you imagine joe was a man like you and you know human being like you and me he was just normal person like you and me and you know such a terrible situation he lost his 10 children at once can you imagine the agony and the pain he had to go through and here she comes his wife turns around he said now you curse your god right and you die he lost his ten children he lost all his sheep camels animals you know servants and married servants and many people have dead by now but now his own heart his sweetheart right turns around and he said curse your god he said i don't want to see your integrity anymore he said you curse him and you die job it's better for you to die and in this situation he says please don't talk like a foolish woman he didn't even call her a fool not in a word or indeed big job shamed right he just renders clothes and he put ashes on him and you know he sat down in the heap of action and he said oh the lord hath given and the lord had taken blessed be his name what a life job lived after meeting god's requirement after living a clean life after living a righteous life after living a holy life that pleased god and god himself testified about him and here the man of god on his black day he never sins he never says anything brother branham says but still but still job stood path for he knew that was god he was certain of god right my brothers my sisters i don't think we have never been in this kind of a situation but you see you know how much we are troubled sometimes you see how much we are you know get into things different kinds of things how we are discouraged and how our hearts breaks and you know all these things we see my brothers and my sisters it's very important to stay with the word of god today take the word of god just believe the word of god no matter what the circumstances are just take the word of god just believe it as it is given to us just blindly trust the word of god and brother watch what god does you know many times we stand and say is god listening to my prayer is god hearing my prayer sure he does he shall listen to our prayers his ears are open to our prayers all the time sometimes we don't pray like we should you agree with me sometimes we don't pray we people don't pray much i don't know about here in america but brother sister i have heard enough from the denomination preachers in india he said you guys preach great things in this you said this is a true message you say this is the truth and you know you preach great mysteries and great deeper things from the word of god but you guys like one thing he said you all doesn't know how to pray what we need is prayer alive in these days anyway i'm going i'm trying to stress on this point a little bit we need prayer lives no matter who we are no matter how you know senior christian we may be we need to learn to go on our knees and we need to pray we need to spend time with god yes sir brother branham speaks about prayer and prayer alive i believe you all know about about prayer a lot of things that brother dale catch i believe he made a book on prayer yeah brother branham said a lot of things about prayer he speaks about all night prayer he speaks about fasting prayer he speaks about praying on our knees he's speaking about our prayer lies and he says our prayer lives have become too weak just think about it you don't pray you're not a better christian you may know whole bible you may know whole message but if there is no prayer in your life better you you check your life you are in a bad terrible situation we need prayer brothers and sisters we need to see that we and our children we pray in our houses amen i know i don't get many amens on this line but that's the truth you can preach four hours you can study for hours but i'm speaking for myself now i can study for long long hours you know i can sit for four five six hours at a time i can study i can listen to the message i can preach for hours together i can travel i can do shopping i can you know go to this place and that place brother i can hardly pray and you know what we need to pray we need the holy ghost prophet of god said a man a person doesn't have the holy ghost he cannot pray you cannot pray you better check whether you got holy ghost or not i know i'm a little bit strong on this but it's the truth we need prayer lives god will not ask you how much you studied how much you know let me ask you a plain question it will it will really tickle it will really you know pinch the minister's mind and heart brother branham used to pray three hours to preach one hour you show me one preacher today that prays three hours to preach one hour i can show you in india there are preachers just like my daddy's age you will see calluses found on the on their knees why because hours together i have a family in my church i will not say the name but you know i have a family that daddy comes to our church too but sometimes he goes to his older son you know about two three uh 100 kilometers but most of the time he comes to the church and one day we were having fasting prayer and he's in his 70s brother sam he's in his 70s he had a he has a cane stick to walk and we started praying meeting that 11 o'clock that day we were all in fasting and praying and he knelt down my brother's my sister and he was on his knees up to five o'clock i couldn't need i'm i'm sorry i'm not ashamed to tell that his own son we talk big things in the message but we couldn't knee that man over 70 years he knelt down brother and he prayed i salute and i respect that man where is our prayer i've gone i believe in prayer life and i'm practicing this since last three years i pray i want to talk to my lord whether it is a night if there's a dawn in the morning or afternoon or evening or night or midnight whatever it is whenever i get little time i pray and ask god and talk to him that is what i'm practicing without prayer you're nothing that's what i found out no prayer you're nothing you're not a good christian i'd like to tell you a little thing before i close this you know my brother's my sister when a child is born listen to this very carefully it's a simple thing but it will help us when a child is born if he is alive and not still brother there is a certain thing there are certain times the child will cry you agree with me mothers and the mother knows the time why the baby is crying so this time she brings water water in a bottle to feed that baby she looks at the time and she said he's thirsty or she's thirsty feeds him and the baby drinks and you know he's happy within few minutes he kicks his hands and legs and you know you can hear him making difference certain sounds and you know the mother says yeah you're happy now but after several hours maybe the baby cries again right and the mother looks why is crying oh he must be hungry so she brings him closer or her closer to her bosom and feeds milk because she knows the baby is hungry you agree with me and the baby you know gladly receives what mother gives and you know that is the greatest thing a mother can give to the baby you know and and and he lives and he jumps and you know how the babies you know when their stomach is full they're happy but again he will cry or she will cry and the mother knows what to give it to him right if our birth is correct and if we are not still born we will cry we will cry i mean we will pray because there is a desire in our heart and that desire only god can fulfill it only god is our satisfying portion only god can quench that thirst only god can answer that tears only god can look into that situation only god is able to satisfy that problem or take care of that problem if we don't have a desire to pray that means we are still born yeah right whether you agree with me i'm not i'm not i don't have a problem we are still born right we can claim we are message believers we can claim we are christians we can claim whatever right but remember you are still born right if there is any life in you you will have a desire right amen and that desire will bring you on your knees oh hallelujah job he always went ahead and gave burnt offerings there was a feast in his son's house and his sons gave feast and all the 10 of them were in the family job said maybe perhaps my children have committed some sin in their hearts so he britain 10 altars and he began to sacrifice on the altar he met god's requirement what we need to do we don't need our altar today we don't need a bullock or a or a sheep or a lamb to sacrifice to god but what we need an altar in our hearts what we need i pray alive he needs praises from this lips we need to pray we need to praise him we need to worship him job in his life he was certain that he is god and he knows that his answer will come his faith will be honored he knows brother branham speaks about he said if you have been anointed and prayed for god is waiting to see what you will believe about it and he says not run up next sunday and run the next day until the next healer comes through the city he's waiting to see your reaction of your faith not walk back next day and say i feel so bad i don't guess i got healed you are not fit for the prayer line in the first place and on the other hand brother branham makes a statement he said if you got faith you don't have to even come in the prayer line when you don't have faith you are not even fit to come in the prayer line you don't believe that he is god what we need today is to believe on him believe this word hallelujah job in his time you know he wanted somebody who could come and intercede for him he was looking for somebody to come and comfort him he was looking for somebody church believers to come and encourage him but we know they all came and they said you are a secret sinner he wanted somebody to come you know and build a bridge between the holy god and a sinful man but you know he was nobody came but then as he was waiting on the lord as he kept trusting in the lord the inspiration struck his mind and heart and brother sister when that inspiration dropped into his heart then he could see god and the lights began to flash and the thunders began to roll and when it did he stood up upon his feet and said i know my redeemer is living and i will see him at the end praise the lord in his troubles in his trials job saw resurrection jobs are resurrected jesus christ and that's why he said my redeemer is alive praise the lord hallelujah oh brother sister brother branham goes further and he says when the spirit of god is near what will take place salvation will be introduced salvation that will bring a spiritual worship not a singing of him altogether but a worship in the spirit it's got to be contrary so contrary to the intellect it's timed by it he said you cannot understand god by intellectual faith you must be born again praise the lord it's got to come to the heart it's got to be an experience he says when the experience is brought by the holy spirit then the same nature same power same reaction that happened on the church first will come again for its god in them i like that my brother i like that all time preaching style i like that old time worship i like that all time you know the religion brother branham speaks he said the same nature will come into him but what we need an experience with god today you may tell me brother sam we have been heard we have heard this long time back but our life should reflect something we need to reflect and we will reflect if it is the holy ghost we will reflect if it is not then we will reflect too yeah but what it takes is an it takes an experience that is brought by the holy spirit and when that experience comes into our life will be same nature same power same reaction that happened in the church first it will be the same now right and i believe one day we are heading to that spot praise the lord before the lecture comes brother we will see that same power it's here right among us you know brother branham says you don't have to pray for more power he said you got enough power to speak a world into existence and step into it and leave but what we need is to use that power by faith that's why we need to pray lord increase my faith increase my faith disciples prayed lord increase our faith we need to pray lord increase my faith my faith and when we pray that's what brother brown says is a prayer for revelation faith is revelation you keep on praying i was trying to to look a guy wearing a t-shirt you know push me and other brother you know we were talking and and you know when we came across this word push and brother lloyd told me he said what you know brother sam have you ever thought about this word push p-u-s-h pray until something happens pray until something happens the bible says pray without ceasing never be tired never get tired of praying i pray that god will bestow his spirit upon us and his church will begin to pray hallelujah we need prayer lives you believe that saints we need prayer today you give more time in prayer if you got time just get into the prayer you know wherever we are i take this this one month or 40 days or 45 days as my pleasure trip you know what i do i only pray read study and preach and travel amen you wouldn't believe and i i'm getting ready to go home i'm like a bull my church tells me he said whenever you come from united states you are like a ball of fire i said praise god you know in this time i try to you know you know i don't know take my my spiritual vitamins and you know spiritual supplements my dietary supplement you know i keep on eating and eating and eating anything brother i become like a powerful bull because i have time here to pray it's not that i don't pray in india i take every bit of it if i get chance i'll get into my office close myself and pray my brothers and sisters we need to meet god's requirement we need to have this experience to have the same power you know same uh nature same kind of reaction just like the first church you see the preview of the bride you all know that you know the the last church is exactly the same you know just like the first church was he said if god poured out the holy ghost on the people of pentecost and that was his decision then how how that the church must operate under the power of the holy spirit he cannot change that god cannot change that if he put the holy ghost in the first church he's going to do it and he has done it is doing it in this last change praise the lord he said and if the church on the day of pentecost received the baptism of the holy ghost the reaction that came from the baptism of the holy ghost will be the reaction on every person that ever receives the baptism of the holy ghost it will be the same reaction he says because it's the same holy amen and i believe we have seen it with our eyes brother branham in paradox he says the pillar of fire is identified scientifically and by the reaction by his character and everything else just the same as it was when he it was dwelling in the body of god's only begotten son so does it dwell in the body of his adopted sons for the last day i'm so glad it's the same holy ghost in us we are the adopted sons and daughters of god it's the same holy ghost and brother we need that we can lay aside put aside all the things you want to but not this one this is the criteria why because brother branham speaks about he said in adam's time the sin was not rooted in their hearts in their life it was tender that's why when god came adam he ran and he began to hide himself but now it's different it's different no matter what people do they're just walking into the church it is so rooted and grounded in the lives of the people if you want i can read that when the first man i said as he has sinned and done something wrong it's in his presence 62 brother branham speaks there and when god came into his presence or he come into the presence of god adam he could not stand in the presence of god he ran and hid himself in the bush and tried to cover himself with a fig leap because he knowed he was standing in the presence of jehovah the creator he knew he realized that that was the reaction of the first man but after he had sinned and tried to come into the presence of god with sin upon his soul he could not stand brother branham said he could not hide but you know he says he could not stand because you were he was tender yet sin had not took a hold like it is rooted in the people's heart today but he was very conscious that he was standing before his creator he hid himself in the bushes and would not come out and could not come out until god had made a preparation for him praise the lord but today people they just they're just walking they don't have no fear of god in their life they don't care about him much right now the bible speaks in 1st timothy 4 12 speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with hot iron you know they will act as if nothing happened they will have act in such a way say we didn't know nothing brothers you tell about it brother they will get upset they will not like it but in that day adam he had to fight because he knew that he's god jehovah the creator he's standing in his presence my brothers my sisters you know that's why god has to send his son to suffer for us brother branham says you know we are not built that way because we are not god but he was god he was god in flesh right he said even though this they saw you inch to inch and you know chop you into pieces he said even you could you know you could not die that death because your makeup is not like that he had to be god he said he had to be more than a man in the makeup god died he died of a broken heart with such a grief for the world until a chemical reaction taken place in his body that could not take place in you you cannot suffer like that there's no way for you to have that kind of grief there's only one could do it and he did it that's why he suffered so we need to look on him today we need to focus our eyes on him because he did it on behalf of us he became us and we became him my precious brothers but the bible says as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be jealous therefore and repent what we need to do is be jealous today and repent keep ourselves correct put our lives on the altar of god and make it set it right and let our life be worthy of his word let us meet his requirement let us obey his word and just act upon the word of god and just believe it as it is given to us unless god will act god will take care of the rest may god bless you may god help us all to follow this line may god help us to keep up our faith in this kind of situation and you know jesus had a greatest question while he was leaving this that he said will i find faith when i come right that's the criteria today i believe god has sent us a message today brother without any blemish it is a pure word of god the word of this hour and brother this has got a rapturing faith if somebody says this is wrong then my question is show me something better than this they are busy criticizing this but they are not giving a better suggestion than this it's beautiful right they're criticizing this but not able to give us a better suggestion than this i believe this is the true word of god this is the truth and we need to stick with it stay with it live by it even if we die let us die for this because this is the truth and there is nothing else god bless you i love you all if you don't see me again on this face of this earth brother if you go first you look for me if i go i'll wait on you because i will be there that's my faith god bless you i turn this servant to the man of god amen amen you believe the message amen response to the test yes what about it we put to the test you know but how do we respond after the test is over what do we do that should be the point shouldn't it what we got boys give me a clean heart man a clean heart because that's what we need right anybody have a name holy spirit is that your you desired a need coming let's see within me the what he's done for you and i'm within what do you have nato so one thing that probably said we can't do too much we're supposed to pray to change our minds not to change his but to change our mind to what he wants not holy restore unto me the joy of thy salvation restored get away from my ideas or what i want and get it to watch restore unto me right you know he likes to put us to a test see if we believe you know what when you're in a test it's not that the lord is a long way from you he's closer to you in the test than he is when you're not being tested we take it backwards we think when we're being tested that god is all somewhere else he's closer to you than when you're not going through a test when things start running too smooth for me i get worried because i realize the lord must be away from me but when things are going wrong i know he's right with me because that's when he said he'd be there anybody else to just have a need me with david's saying that the prophet said he knew that he didn't have any said he knew he didn't have any he's wanting the lord to restore his salvation oh god within me within just keep me from that right it just keeps me promised because he promised i will be with you always didn't say always that would be contrary but always a clean heart just make sure you tell brother brother samuel how much you appreciate him how much appreciated his message appreciate him coming being with us we say brother uh wes greeley there from coming up from columbus to pick him up this afternoon you know we appreciate these things they really mean something to us because it's it's people putting forth an effort you know to do things and serve the lord and to do it make sure you tell him how much you appreciate him all right and remember now what we said this morning after the offering this afternoon we didn't announce it to the kids but we did this morning the offering this afternoon will go to brother prakash's is their ministry there all right and then that way if you have anything you want to give him you feel free to give it to him but but let me do something cause i've got one i've got to cry right if you write a check write the check to the church here and then because a lot of these brothers can't take care of the checks on the way write to check to the church and then we will give him the money because that way you don't have to worry about handling the checks on that basis it turns out a whole lot better then that way you can write off your what you give to on your tithe you know i mean write it off on your taxes sometimes because it'll be that way but just make sure you write it out to the church and then you know and make do it that way or try to give cash because these brothers are traveling and doing and all and we we do have a contact part where we can can contact brother percussion and everything in the ministry there and we always take care of the expenses of you know we don't take up an offering for the minister that preaches because we do that as a church but we let all the money go that comes into the offering to them for the work that they're doing in all of that part okay so what we're going to do if it's all right with everybody we'll just also give him a check that he can take back with him to india from the church here of about 1500 to where that it can they can put it into the work dire and you know do the things he was saying that the church needed painting but uh whatever they do with it that's up to them that's right that's not that we control that part we just send it so if they're all right so we'll do that plus whatever is given unto him okay everybody happy anybody anything to say before we go remember my wife the lord willing is supposed to be operated on friday um somewhere close to 12 12 30. all right so just remember at that time and just that the lord would bless her and take care of her and we still believe that he can take care of it before friday gets here because we don't worry about that we just depend on the whole thing and then the lord take care of it right what else we got waiting brother forney will be here with us wednesday ministering so remember that all right anything else lord jesus we thank you today thank you for your grace and your love unto us thank you for the word that we've heard today and we pray that you would just let it dwell within our hearts and that we may see you lord and that we would be as the bible said our brother preaching pray without ceasing and lord we can do that all day long we don't have to get on our knees we don't have to get in a closet we don't have to do we can just talk to you within ourselves but lord then sometimes it is good to just get down and pray and just pour our hearts to you but we can pray without ceasing and that we can live our lives every day and talk to you all day long and tell you one thing for sure that lord you know that i always tell you lord i love you amen that's the main thing is for you to know that i love you because i know you love me i don't have no problem with that but i want you to know that i love you and we just pray that you'd bless our brother now as he travels on and bless him in his ministry in the traveling bless the people that are in india lord and brother prakash and all of the the work that they're doing we pray that you would bless each one we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen you're dismissed amen no yes i know
