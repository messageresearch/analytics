[0:20] And before we get started, let's just

[0:48] what we have need of. And Father, bless
[0:51] each part of this service. We commit it
[0:52] all to you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[0:55] Amen.
[0:56] Amen. This morning, uh going to go to
[1:00] the book of Deuteronomy,
[1:01] chapter 6,
[1:04] and uh
[1:07] begin at verse 18.
[1:09] [snorts]
[1:10] And uh
[1:13] scripture says, "And thou shalt do that
[1:17] which is right and good in the sight of
[1:19] the Lord, that it may be well with thee,
[1:22] and that thou mayest go in and possess
[1:25] the good land which the Lord swear unto
[1:26] thy fathers, to cast out all thine
[1:29] enemies from before thee, as the Lord
[1:31] hath spoken. And when thy son askketh
[1:34] thee in time to come, saying, What mean
[1:37] the testimonies, and the statutes, and
[1:39] the judgments, which the Lord our God
[1:41] hath commanded you, then thou shalt say
[1:44] unto thy son? We were Pharaoh's bondman
[1:47] in Egypt. And the Lord brought us out of
[1:50] Egypt with a mighty hand. And the Lord
[1:53] showed signs and wonders great and sore
[1:55] upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all
[1:58] his household before our eyes. And he
[2:01] brought us out from thence that he may
[2:03] bring us in to give us the land which he
[2:06] swore unto our fathers. And the Lord
[2:08] commanded us to do all these statutes to
[2:10] fear the Lord our God for our good
[2:13] always. And that he might preserve us
[2:17] alive as it is at this day. And it shall
[2:21] be our righteousness if we observe to do
[2:24] all these commandments before the Lord
[2:25] our God as he hath commanded us.
[2:29] And
[2:31] this morning I uh y'all might find it a
[2:34] little funny this morning. Um I entitled
[2:37] this what is the meaning of this? And uh
[2:41] for those of us that were together
[2:44] yesterday at brother Kern's house. Uh we
[2:48] were we were playing this little game
[2:49] and uh you're trying to give hints to
[2:53] words and you're trying people are
[2:55] trying to guess the words and uh it was
[2:58] quite funny because um it's very hard to
[3:02] come up with the right words because if
[3:04] you you're trying to give hints but the
[3:07] problem is if you give if you give it
[3:09] too easy it's not hard to figure out
[3:12] what the word is.
[3:14] So then but if it's too vague then
[3:16] nobody has any idea what you're talking
[3:17] about
[3:19] &gt;&gt; and you know and and so you know it's
[3:21] like it becomes a real struggle to
[3:24] understand some of these things but
[3:28] you know we as when you're when you look
[3:32] at it because I I got I was playing the
[3:34] moderator and so uh here I am trying to
[3:38] give definitions to words and trying to
[3:40] give clues and hints and and the more I
[3:43] the more I had done it, the more more
[3:44] confused people look sometimes. And then
[3:47] um but it's like well if if I was if I
[3:50] made it real easy,
[3:51] [cough and clears throat] y'all wouldn't
[3:52] I mean it just you know you're not
[3:54] playing the game because you're making
[3:56] it too easy on everybody. But uh so it
[3:58] was a little bit of a struggle trying to
[4:00] play this game. But it was so funny
[4:01] because people kept getting closer and
[4:03] closer and closer. But it's like well
[4:06] they're not seeing it. But see but
[4:08] you're getting closer every step of the
[4:09] way.
[4:11] And you know, I was I was reading here
[4:13] in the in the scripture. I was thinking
[4:14] about that last night. And I was
[4:16] thinking about what brother Chris Long
[4:17] had was preaching on the other day when
[4:18] he was talking about the books, the one
[4:20] book, two books, and the you book.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; And you know, when you when you begin to
[4:25] look at it, it's you in that book. You
[4:27] are that book. And you begin to see
[4:29] yourself in that book. And the one thing
[4:31] he was talking about at the beginning of
[4:33] the of the sermon when he kept talking
[4:35] about the symbols in the scripture, you
[4:37] know, we we're confused by the symbols
[4:39] and we don't understand the symbols. But
[4:41] you know, over time they become become
[4:44] clear because the more you see yourself
[4:46] in the word when you see yourself then
[4:48] it becomes more clear to you because
[4:50] you're seeing Christ and you're seeing
[4:52] Christ in you. You see in the word then
[4:54] it becomes more clear to you. So the
[4:56] symbols are not u so confusing but
[5:00] you're beginning to see more. And when
[5:03] brother Chris was
[5:05] ministering afterwards I told him I said
[5:08] I what comes to my mind is uh the
[5:11] mission impossible.
[5:13] Some of y'all remember the old Mission
[5:15] Impossible uh when uh when Peter Graves
[5:19] would come up and he would just speak to
[5:21] somebody on the street, you know, he
[5:23] just walk up to somebody and he would
[5:24] speak to them and you know, it's just a
[5:27] common mundane kind of
[5:30] conversation. They would say something
[5:32] and he would say something and then the
[5:35] other person would speak and if you were
[5:37] listening to that conversation, it would
[5:38] mean anything to you. I mean, it's just
[5:40] normal, mundane, common conversation.
[5:43] But the problem was is when he's
[5:46] speaking to that person and that person
[5:49] is responding that he knows there is a
[5:51] secret that's being conveyed between the
[5:54] two that nobody else sees. But it's only
[5:57] those two that are speaking understand.
[6:00] And then when he speaks the right word,
[6:03] then he tells him, you go here and you
[6:05] find what you're looking for. And that's
[6:07] when he went and found the, you know,
[6:09] the cassette player. But, you know, he
[6:11] had, but he had to go through those
[6:12] steps to bring him to the place that he
[6:14] needed to come to.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, you see how how that
[6:17] works. And, you know, I was talking
[6:18] about that because, you know, brother
[6:20] Brandham talked about that mystery. You
[6:22] know, God had a had a a mystery, a
[6:25] secret mystery hidden in the back part
[6:27] of his mind that he kept secret, but the
[6:30] mystery didn't become known until he
[6:32] began to convey it.
[6:34] See when you know because we didn't see
[6:37] even though he spoke through the
[6:39] prophets through the old throughout the
[6:41] whole Old Testament and he began to
[6:44] speak to through the prophets people
[6:46] didn't realize that was God and in in
[6:49] human flesh before the people
[6:52] &gt;&gt; right
[6:52] &gt;&gt; you know sometimes they missed it
[6:54] because you know I mean it's you know
[6:57] they're up there and they're talking
[6:58] thinking that God was behind badger skin
[7:01] God's in in the tabernacle He's he's in
[7:04] the holiest place and he's in there.
[7:06] It's like, well, don't let don't let him
[7:08] speak.
[7:10] But God stood in in the human flesh of
[7:13] Moses speaking to them.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; There was there was God speaking to
[7:18] them. And they're like, "Don't
[7:21] [clears throat] don't let God speak to
[7:22] us. Moses, you speak to us." Well, it
[7:25] was God speaking through Moses to them.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; And they missed they missed that God was
[7:30] speaking to them here. Here he was
[7:33] speaking to them and they murmured and
[7:35] complained against Moses and not
[7:36] realizing that's God's mouthpiece.
[7:38] That's God, human flesh to them and he's
[7:41] speaking to them and trying to help them
[7:43] along the way and they miss what what
[7:46] has happened. Here's God with them all
[7:49] the way. Every time they failed, every
[7:51] time they murmured, every time they
[7:53] complained, no matter what happened, it
[7:55] didn't change God's plan. He still was
[7:57] with them. He was still encouraging
[7:59] them. He was still leading them. He
[8:01] didn't stop, but they missed that God
[8:03] was with them.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Right?
[8:05] &gt;&gt; Here's God leading them the whole way,
[8:08] &gt;&gt; you know, and and
[8:11] he tried to, you know, lead them all the
[8:13] way, show them that they were going into
[8:15] the land of promise, but because of
[8:17] their unbelief is what held them back.
[8:21] And here in Deuteronomy chapter 6, I I I
[8:23] always like this one because Deuteronomy
[8:25] chapter 5, in Deuteronomy chapter 5, we
[8:29] read the is the reading of the Ten
[8:31] Commandments before they go into the
[8:34] promised land
[8:35] because they're reading he's leading
[8:37] them back to the because in Exodus 20 is
[8:40] when God give them the ten commandments,
[8:42] but in in Deuteronomy 5, he's speaking
[8:45] to them in of the uh giving them going
[8:48] back over the law and giving them the
[8:51] word again. And then in chapter six here
[8:54] as they as they're leading again and
[8:56] they're saying why
[8:59] why does he bring these things up and it
[9:01] says that you may know what is right in
[9:04] the sight of the Lord for you to do
[9:06] these things and it says you know why
[9:08] why are we following all these things
[9:10] because these are the laws of God to
[9:13] lead us into the land of promise
[9:16] &gt;&gt; and and so and it's like he's giving you
[9:18] the same opportunity give the children
[9:20] the same thing he gave to their fathers.
[9:22] Their fathers didn't stay with the word.
[9:25] The fathers didn't go all
[9:26] [clears throat] the way, but the
[9:27] children are here and he's giving them
[9:29] the same law and he's giving them. He
[9:31] said, "So why do we have these
[9:32] testimonies?" Because God was faithful
[9:34] to his word,
[9:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[9:36] &gt;&gt; He led them all these. Why do we have
[9:38] these testimony? Why do we have these
[9:39] statutes and the judgments which the
[9:40] Lord our God commanded you?
[9:44] because
[9:46] he promised Abraham and he came to the
[9:48] children of Israel and he brought them
[9:50] out of the land of bondage. And the
[9:53] scripture says he says, "And thou shalt
[9:55] say unto thy son, we were a Pharaoh's
[9:58] bondman in Egypt, and the Lord brought
[10:00] us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. And
[10:04] the Lord showed signs and wonders, great
[10:06] and soore upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and
[10:09] upon all his house before our eyes. and
[10:12] he brought us out from thence that he
[10:15] may bring us in to give us the land
[10:17] which he swear unto our fathers.
[10:21] So he's showing them that now is the
[10:23] time of going in and he's showing all
[10:26] these are the things that took place.
[10:29] Now you know here they are seeing these
[10:32] things and they were wondering where God
[10:35] was for so many years.
[10:37] you know, we're we're the we're the
[10:39] chosen people of God and here they are
[10:41] bondsmen,
[10:43] you know, death and destruction and all
[10:45] the things they faced and it's like
[10:47] where is God in all this? Then when God
[10:50] comes on the scene
[10:52] and he show he showed the miracles,
[10:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[10:55] &gt;&gt; He done all the miracles, the signs, the
[10:57] wonders, and it was to encourage them.
[10:59] It wasn't for everybody else. It was to
[11:02] encourage them.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:04] &gt;&gt; But you go back and listen to the
[11:06] Philistines. you go back and listen to
[11:08] the other the other tribes that were
[11:10] there
[11:12] when when Rahab when they crossed into
[11:14] the into the promised land and Rahab's
[11:16] in there said you know we when we y'all
[11:18] crossed over we we heard what God done
[11:19] in Egypt our hearts melted with we had
[11:22] no fight in us
[11:25] &gt;&gt; we we we we didn't we didn't have no
[11:27] place to stand
[11:29] &gt;&gt; we were not going to make it if your God
[11:32] can do those things we didn't have a
[11:35] That's right.
[11:37] &gt;&gt; But you know what? God spoke to them.
[11:39] And it wasn't for the world,
[11:42] &gt;&gt; but the world took it. There was some
[11:44] all those tribes, all those nations saw
[11:45] that it's like, "Wow, this God's
[11:47] powerful. He's going to lead them
[11:48] through. He's going they're going to
[11:50] overtake all this because it was
[11:51] promised. And look what all the things
[11:53] that have taken place.
[11:56] All 10 all the 10 gods of Egypt. He
[12:00] destroyed every one of them. He showed
[12:02] that they were powerless. Right.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; Everything that every every plague that
[12:06] come upon Egypt was showing that their
[12:09] gods were powerless
[12:13] &gt;&gt; and showed everyone every god that Egypt
[12:15] had. God showed his power
[12:19] &gt;&gt; and overtook them. And and not only
[12:21] that, see, Moses went out there and
[12:22] began to tell them, said, "Listen,
[12:25] the river is going to turn to blood.
[12:29] There's going to be darkness.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; There's going to be frogs.
[12:33] the locust and everything's coming. But
[12:35] you know, he spoke it before it came to
[12:37] pass,
[12:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[12:38] &gt;&gt; He warned the people and told them said,
[12:40] "Listen, if your God's powerful, then
[12:42] let him stop it, but the God of heaven
[12:45] spoke and said, "Listen, y'all going to
[12:46] face these things."
[12:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; And they saw it and they saw the Egypt
[12:51] saw the destruction, but the children of
[12:53] Israel saw God was faithful to his word.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[12:57] But you know all those times when all
[13:00] that they faced all those things and
[13:02] when the darkness came and all that
[13:04] there was light in Goan. There was
[13:06] safety in Goan.
[13:09] They had protection in Goan.
[13:11] &gt;&gt; And then when it came for their time
[13:13] then all of a sudden all he had to do
[13:14] was they had to follow what the word
[13:17] said. Right?
[13:18] &gt;&gt; Just come follow what the word said. And
[13:20] then here he is. He's leading them out.
[13:25] It's time for you to get ready.
[13:28] It's time to get ready because we're
[13:29] seeing things take place.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; And all of a sudden, it's like, "Hey,
[13:33] get your shoes on. Get your staff in
[13:35] your hand. We got we got a we got a
[13:37] getting out of here meal to eat.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; There's a roasted lamb. There's
[13:41] unleavened bread. We're time we're time
[13:43] to feast."
[13:46] &gt;&gt; And people didn't see that. Hey, we're
[13:48] going we're going to take all this lamb.
[13:50] We're going to roast it. We're going to
[13:51] eat it. and we gonna get out of here.
[13:55] And the whole time they're so worried
[13:56] about what was going to take place.
[13:59] What what's what's the what's the
[14:00] neighbors think? What's what's the
[14:02] nations around us think? What what No,
[14:06] God was encouraging the whole time,
[14:08] showing them it's time to get ready to
[14:10] go.
[14:12] And it's it is such a wonderful thing to
[14:14] see that that God has has allowed us to
[14:16] see these things just like them. It's
[14:18] time to get ready to go. And you know,
[14:21] he led them out all this through this
[14:23] journey, bringing them through. God was
[14:26] faithful to them the whole time. You
[14:28] know, I I I get I get down in myself
[14:31] sometimes. And
[14:34] maybe y'all don't. I do.
[14:36] You know,
[14:38] &gt;&gt; I I you know, as brother Dale used to
[14:40] say, you have your little pity parties.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; And uh but you know, I go back and I I I
[14:45] love I love reading the Old Testament.
[14:48] Brother Donnie says, "I preach out of
[14:49] the Old Testament all the time." I was
[14:50] like, "Well, I find myself there many
[14:52] times." And
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:53] &gt;&gt; And uh I I really en enjoy reading
[14:56] because you know, you see these people
[14:57] and you and you think, "Why why do these
[15:00] people struggle with all of this?" When
[15:02] you see when you've seen the
[15:03] supernatural take place, when you've
[15:04] seen the miracles, when you've seen what
[15:06] God's promised you and it comes to pass
[15:08] and we still we still struggle with
[15:10] these things, it's like, why why are
[15:12] they struggling with this? It's like why
[15:14] why why didn't they just have bold and
[15:16] be faithful and just you know rest in
[15:19] God and everything like that and then I
[15:20] sit and and when I face things in life
[15:25] and I think you know what because I'm
[15:27] human too
[15:31] &gt;&gt; just like they were human
[15:33] &gt;&gt; and it's [clears throat] like well you
[15:34] know I've got I've got him on the inside
[15:37] &gt;&gt; and I still struggle
[15:39] &gt;&gt; I still have doubt
[15:42] &gt;&gt; and you That's the reason if you get
[15:44] into the word, you know, he comes and
[15:46] buys and he speaks to you and he he
[15:49] shows you. He encourages you.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; Hey, this is this is for you.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; Just like they struggle, but you know
[15:56] what? God was faithful to them. But he
[15:58] rose up a group. There was a faithful
[16:00] group that rose up.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; And you know what? They went all the
[16:05] way. They put all the things behind
[16:07] them. Here's a here's a group that ra
[16:10] rose up and they didn't they didn't
[16:11] worry about well our fathers done this
[16:13] and our fathers done that. They failed.
[16:17] But there was a group that rose up that
[16:18] were going in to take the promise that
[16:20] the promised land. They weren't held
[16:22] back by those things
[16:25] and the word came to them and they took
[16:27] the word and it's like listen this word
[16:30] is for me
[16:32] and so this is this is what I'm going to
[16:34] do. And you know, brother Brandham said,
[16:36] you know, God sends send sends things
[16:38] our way sometimes for us to do certain
[16:40] things.
[16:43] And then he said, then we will see that
[16:44] God has proved what he said
[16:48] he was to that person. And then God
[16:50] testifies the thing the person testified
[16:52] of.
[16:55] So things happen in our lives that God
[16:56] sends things our way. He wants us to do
[16:58] things. You know, he was talking about
[17:01] non going to the going to the river to
[17:04] Jordan and baptizing. He said, "Well,
[17:07] Nathan didn't have to go to the to the
[17:09] water to be baptized to dip seven
[17:12] times." But that's what that's what the
[17:14] prophet told him to do.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; You know, Elijah could have told him,
[17:20] said, "You're clean." And left.
[17:24] But was he going But would he have faith
[17:26] to believe what name what Elijah told
[17:29] him to do? Would he have faith to go to
[17:31] the water and get baptized? Would he
[17:34] would he actually go dip seven times
[17:36] when he went out there and says, "We got
[17:38] better there's better rivers to dip in
[17:39] than the Jordan.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Who would want to go in that? I mean,
[17:44] this is dirty water."
[17:47] He's like, "Well, do you do you want to
[17:48] get clean?"
[17:51] You know, the young servant girl said,
[17:53] "My Lord said, 'Well, if you know, if he
[17:55] told you to do some great thing, if you
[17:57] had if you had to go do some great
[18:00] that was very hard to do and and
[18:03] difficult and time consuming, would
[18:05] you?" Oh, yeah. I'd do that.
[18:08] Would you go down there and dip in the
[18:09] river seven times?
[18:12] Oh, yeah.
[18:14] It's like, well, you know, he had to
[18:15] humble himself to go step in that muddy
[18:19] water and dip seven times. And when he
[18:22] did,
[18:24] then the Lord come on the scene and
[18:26] cleanse him just like
[18:28] just like the prophet told him to do.
[18:34] And see you see all the way through and
[18:36] there's there's many many scriptures but
[18:39] you know I I think about the children of
[18:41] Israel you know as as they go and and
[18:44] their journey and and not only then but
[18:47] after they come into the promised land
[18:49] you know they still have issues they
[18:50] still have problems and you know they
[18:53] continue on and and it goes right back
[18:54] to the same thing and you know I was
[18:57] reading about
[18:59] about when Samuel
[19:02] when when Samuel was the prophet and
[19:04] they came in
[19:06] and [clears throat] God began to speak
[19:08] to Samuel as a young man and you know he
[19:11] had never heard the voice of of God
[19:13] before
[19:15] and Eli told him said listen when you
[19:17] hear that he said just speak to the Lord
[19:19] here am I right
[19:21] &gt;&gt; and hear what he had to say
[19:24] &gt;&gt; and you know when when God began to
[19:26] speak to Samuel you know he was troubled
[19:30] at what God told him.
[19:34] And you know, he was standing there one
[19:35] day and he it was like he was he didn't
[19:38] know what to do in the situation when
[19:41] God spoke to him. And Eli told him, he
[19:44] said, "What did the Lord tell you?"
[19:46] And he said, "Don't hold anything back."
[19:49] He said, "God do to you and more if you
[19:51] hold anything back." back and he told
[19:53] him, he said, "Because judgment's come
[19:55] upon your house because of your sons and
[19:58] the iniquity that took place and you've
[19:59] not done anything about it."
[20:02] And you know when when God came and
[20:06] to them and God began to speak to
[20:10] Samuel about the word of the Lord and
[20:11] become and the scripture tells us
[20:21] that later on
[20:23] it says that he began to grow and God
[20:26] began to speak to him.
[20:29] And it says and the word of Samuel came
[20:31] to all Israel. This is 1st Samuel
[20:32] chapter 4. And it said, "Now Israel went
[20:34] out against the Philistines to battle
[20:36] and pitched beside Ebenezer, and the
[20:39] Philistines pitched an Aph.
[20:43] And the and it says, "And the
[20:44] Philistines put themselves in array
[20:47] against Israel. When they joined the
[20:49] battle, Israel was smitten before the
[20:51] Philistines, and they and they slew of
[20:54] their army in the field about 4,000
[20:56] men."
[20:58] And here's this battle going on.
[21:01] And what was interesting is
[21:05] here in the in the scripture that you'll
[21:07] see it says, "And the people were come
[21:10] into the camp. The elders of Israel
[21:11] said, "Wherefore the Lord has spitten us
[21:15] today before the Philistines, let us
[21:17] fetch the ark of the covenant of the
[21:19] Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that when it
[21:22] cometh among us, it may save us out of
[21:25] the hand of the enemies of our enemies."
[21:29] And so they go and get the ark of the
[21:31] covenant and they bring that into the
[21:33] camp.
[21:35] But you know the one thing that you find
[21:36] out in the reading of the scripture,
[21:40] the the children of Israel when they're
[21:42] when they're fighting against the
[21:43] Philistines, they never consult Samuel.
[21:48] There's not one time they consult Samuel
[21:50] in all this. But the leaders decided,
[21:52] hey, we're gonna go get the ark of the
[21:54] covenant
[21:55] &gt;&gt; and we're gonna bring this we're gonna
[21:57] bring the ark of the covenant in. And
[21:59] there's and there's they had all this
[22:01] great rejoicing that was that the ark of
[22:03] the covenant was brought into the camp
[22:05] and the Philistines were hearing it. And
[22:08] the Philistines were afraid.
[22:11] It says the Philistines were afraid when
[22:12] the when the ark of the covenant came
[22:14] in. But you know later on when they when
[22:17] they rose up to fight
[22:19] after after the the children of Israel
[22:21] had the ark of the covenant with them
[22:24] and the scripture says and the
[22:26] Philistines fought and Israel was
[22:28] smitten and they fled every man into his
[22:31] tent and there was a very great
[22:33] slaughter for there fell of Israel
[22:37] 30,000 footmen.
[22:40] So the first battle they lost 4,000 and
[22:44] it's like oh we're just going to go get
[22:45] the we're just going to go get the ark
[22:46] of the covenant and bring it in the camp
[22:49] and they set the ark of the covenant up
[22:52] and then there was a great slaughter
[22:55] beyond that and everybody's like
[22:58] everybody begins to wonder what what
[23:00] happened what happened
[23:02] and you know that's when the ark of the
[23:04] covenant was taken by the Philistines
[23:07] [cough]
[23:07] and it was brought unto Dagen
[23:11] And you know, we know the god dagen was
[23:13] broken up into pieces and all that and
[23:14] God smoked the people
[23:16] &gt;&gt; because they had taken the ark. But you
[23:19] know, when they took the ark of the
[23:20] covenant, the people's like, "Well, we
[23:22] just got we just got the ark. We've got
[23:25] the word. We we've got this this
[23:28] covenant here. We're showing this." But
[23:30] that's not what helped them.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; When the prophet was there, they never
[23:35] consulted the prophet to see what to do.
[23:39] And it's just like because later on
[23:42] after after they went through all of
[23:44] this and they're still in battle and
[23:46] they're still they're still under this
[23:48] attack and they're losing. And then
[23:51] finally Samuel comes to him one day and
[23:53] tells them. He said the only way that
[23:56] you're going to get this is if you come
[23:58] back to the word and repent.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; There's a time of repentance. You must
[24:03] come back to this and then if you will
[24:05] hold to the word then God will deliver
[24:07] you.
[24:09] But if you don't, then you're still
[24:10] under this under this
[24:14] you're still under this bondage. You're
[24:15] still being attacked. And you know, and
[24:17] then when they came,
[24:20] then God was able when they began to cry
[24:23] out to Samuel
[24:25] for deliverance,
[24:27] to turn back to God. Then that God was
[24:30] able to deliver them. And so, you know,
[24:33] many times in our lives and other
[24:36] people, you see, you know, it's just not
[24:39] just taking the word, but it's actually
[24:41] taking the word and applying it to
[24:43] ourselves and holding it. And it takes
[24:45] it takes a life of repentance. It takes
[24:47] a life of humility.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Because if we if we're not humble before
[24:51] the Lord, then all this is is not going
[24:54] to help us
[24:56] &gt;&gt; toing a Bible and reading a Bible.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; But, you know, it's saying the right
[25:00] thing. Yes.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; And not and and believe in what God says
[25:05] and taking in what God said. And Lord,
[25:07] try me. Create in me a new heart, a
[25:10] clean heart. Lord, help me that I got I
[25:12] have all of these battles and and many
[25:15] things that we're facing, but you know
[25:16] what? The same God
[25:18] that delivered them is with us today.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; And you know, today we see we see the
[25:25] wars and rumors of war. We see all these
[25:27] things happening. But you know what? I
[25:28] thank God for one thing. We're starting
[25:30] a new year. That puts us one day closer
[25:33] to the coming of the Lord.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; We are one day closer.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; And you know, we see the things that are
[25:39] taking place, but praise God that we see
[25:42] these things. You know, we know
[25:44] tomorrow's headlines today. As brother
[25:46] Ernie used to say all the time, what a
[25:49] wonderful time. What a wonderful day to
[25:50] live in.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful place to be in.
[25:55] And you know you and if you know what
[25:57] the word says. I I thought about sister
[25:59] Hattie, right?
[26:02] Hearing the word go forth.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; The words went forth and we've heard the
[26:09] word.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; And all and all she done was she said
[26:13] one thing. That ain't nothing but the
[26:15] truth.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:21] And just as brother Chris was talking
[26:23] about the that little boy playing in
[26:25] that house, when he began to look, he
[26:28] saw that mirror and he's like, "Hey,
[26:29] that's me. I identified me. That's me. I
[26:33] see myself. I see the day and hour which
[26:35] we live." And I realize this is for me.
[26:37] This is mine and I'm going to speak it
[26:39] and I'm going to claim it.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[26:42] &gt;&gt; It's like, well, you you may have the
[26:44] hardest battles you've ever had this
[26:45] year, but you know what? You're gonna
[26:47] have the greatest victories
[26:50] &gt;&gt; you've ever had this year.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; It's it's a great thing. This is going
[26:55] to be our our starting of a new year.
[26:59] We got opportunities.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; Many times we we think, well, we just
[27:06] got more more problems and more
[27:07] struggles and, you know, a lot more
[27:10] questions and everything. But you know
[27:12] what? We still have the answer. Right?
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the answer to every question in
[27:18] life.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; And he's still on the throne. And he
[27:22] said he's going to lead you and guide
[27:23] you. He said, "Lord, I'll be with you
[27:26] even in you to the end of the world, to
[27:29] the end of the age."
[27:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; That's encouraging to me.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. when the when no matter how
[27:35] no matter how the devil comes in,
[27:37] attacks, whatever comes our way, you
[27:40] know, praise God, we we know who who to
[27:43] run to. We know that we're encouraged.
[27:46] We know where to stand. It looks
[27:49] confusing to everybody else, but you
[27:51] know what? It's not confusing to me.
[27:56] Praise God that God has given us a light
[27:58] to see. He's given us a word that that
[28:02] speaks to us and shows us who we are.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; And if you you wonder what the meaning
[28:07] of things are,
[28:10] you take it to God. You get in the word
[28:11] and he'll show you what these things
[28:13] mean.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I'm so glad he gave my life
[28:16] meaning
[28:18] &gt;&gt; because without it, we wouldn't we
[28:20] wouldn't know what where we'd be at or
[28:21] what to do.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; But thanks God we know.
[28:27] You know it's because
[28:29] you know many people that they want to
[28:31] be
[28:33] you ask people you know they want to be
[28:35] rich and famous and and all these type
[28:37] things and you know they have certain
[28:39] things that they want. I want to be
[28:40] faithful to God.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; I want to be faithful to his word.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; That's all that's all I want in this
[28:46] life.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; I want I want to be all that he wants me
[28:50] to be.
[28:52] And that's the greatest that's the
[28:53] greatest accomplishment we we can have
[28:55] in this life. Amen. But God bless you
[28:58] this morning.
