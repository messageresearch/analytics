that our hearts would be set on one thing to see what's taking place in this hour that's fun to speak about the past we do that it's great to speak about the future but we're supposed to be content

in obeying the truth through the spirit under unfailing love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever now how are you born you're born by the incorruptible or the word that is made alive is that a better way of saying it the word that is made alive is your new word now let's go to 2nd Peter all right Simon Peter servant and apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according to his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory inversor now we're all called to that what we will reimburse you right strength and eternity of all the things okay we're by giving it to us exceeding great and precious promises by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue or knowledge and the knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word yeah keeping your thoughts in mind of what we've been trying to bring out I wanted to kind of take each virtue tonight ahead that planned but it never did work out so you know you're looking at things and you say well I'll bring this out well sometimes you don't get to bring out what you want to bring out so I hope it's God doing it and not me changing to myself but I wanted to and we'll try the Lord willing to do that maybe you know this coming Sunday and get everything in order for Ken but I want to talk to you about something that I want you to notice I'll try to make little points then they're valuable to me now they may not be valuable to you you may not think about the things that you know that a minister will think of or whatever just like there in first Peter where it says being born again then he tells you how by the incorruptible word well right now the war is there any thoughts of any way of the new birth being anything besides the birth of the word you know what would be anything could be in relation to the birth of the word is just what the scripture says it is it's God meant alive in you Christ in you the hope of glory alright now keep that in mind because we kept hammering a little bit to our Sunday onto one point for you to get and to think about we were talking about that it's it talks you know it says there add to your faith virtue now say this and then repeat it and get in a minute it does not say add faith that may not mean a thing to you see you said well that's just you know it may not mean anything to you but see that makes me stop and think it says that virtue had temperance that patients had godliness right but it does not say to add faith why not why would it not say add faith see that that's you know maybe maybe it's just my abilities or forms you call it human intelligence when I look at something I try to look at it as to the point of what is being said you know to us and it says there in first Peter for us being born again well you know what being is being there's a process of something going on being born again alright the new birth the process of the new birth starts from your beginning you know at justification goes all the way through your journey to the sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the you know coming forth and then the pyramid coming up through and adoptions and all of the things and you're still one scripture being born again because that's what's taking place something is going on in your life something is going on each day in our lives we are being mourned again by what by the incorruptible word alright then why would we not want the word you know why would we not be more concerned that's where people have said it about Lula they say all they are up there just word word word word word will thank God for that I mean I'll say that whether you will or not I say thank God for the word the word because they Lance the word all the way through it was the word that started the world it was word before the world ever started it'll be the word after the world has ended all the things are through it'll still be the word well why wouldn't we want to think about when he's the word and His Christ in you Bert into you need to give you his own life okay now think of that thought now for just a little bit and we'll get back to it think of it why does it not say see it doesn't say add faith it doesn't say that it says add to your faith virtue add to your virtue knowledge now remember you can't jump up the ladder remember it's got to be vulcanized together right so it's all got to be the same material you remember that in the Service's previous it's all the same material it's all the word being revealed the new birth is the word being revealed adoption is the word being revealed the fields being revealed the the the seventy weeks are Daniel the things that that we have in the message being revealed to us and it's going to bring somebody to a change of the body alright and I want to be one of them don't you I mean that's that's the point I want to want us to get alright but now let see it says add not it don't say add faith put it back up where everybody can read if you want me to pull that back up brothers or the of the theater and let's just read verse five because I want you to keep that in mind that's gonna be valuable as we go along now watch when it gets to verse five and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and diverse your knowledge and a knowledge temperance and tell faces huh but it doesn't say Edie faith faith is not a virtue faith is a birth see the prophets if you remember all of what we talk he says you can't be born again without having faith that's statue of perfect man sitting when you're born again you have faith you just starting to a place to grow what when you get faith all right so then it doesn't say add faith they're saying what it wants to say because of the point that it's to me that God's trying to get across to us it starts in your new birth and you burn new birth this faith so you don't add faith how would you add faith what would you add it to well see then all the virtues are added to the faith right see they can be put on the faith and all called faith the Prophet said is the foundation of all Christianity is based upon the faith of God revealed to you and I all right but see it doesn't say where to add faith and it probably said have faith and be born again then these are the things that God expects us to add right the virtues can be added to your foundation but your foundations got to be the thing that holds you up and the foundation of all Christianity is faith in the Word of God right faith in the Word of God is the foundation for all things see then having doing that then see you start out at faith and you have faith and be born again the Prophet said all right so the new birth is faith now watch what we're getting to what was we talking about Sunday it's your faith now that is not your faithfulness that's the human intelligence of mankind trying to interpret the Word of God your faithfulness is not what it is that's just your faithfulness to believe God and do what God did that's not God's faith but see the new birth is God's faith revelation were revealed to you alright now take that as being his faith given to you and what did the prophets say that we read from Chrysler myths I mean from the statute of perfect man he said this is my eye he said God gave it to me he said this is my arm God gave it to me he said like it was with Mary right God gave Mary the promise that come all the way from genesis 3:15 that i'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman woman I'll have the seed so she had to be given a seed she was given a seed now Seth was not that seed he was just what would you call it a hundred prophets in and there was like a replacement but he was not that seed Jesus Christ is that seed when he was the one that was given to Mary and it became Mary seed right it became her seed because God give it to you the gods not an Indian giver so we don't count it that what he done that he give me you give me this and see don't try to add all of the other things as we'll get to it later you say well I've been in the message and study this message 40 years I think I got knowledge that's not the knowledge brother Brett I was talking about right yes well I wanted to get into each one of those virtues and we'll try to pick it up Sunday where he says now virtuous virtue he said now that's not trying to live a virgin lawful he said not in this case and it comes out to be an odd thing to wear he said and virtue is what strength he said and said you've got to have a pice to let it out we'll get to those things Lord with it Sunday but I want you to think about it because see it does not say add faith it says add to your faith see God has given us the new birth that is your faith that's not your faithfulness to do believe him and accept him and do this edit don't know all that's well and good with that's not the new birth the new birth is God coming down to giving to you his own very life placing within you his own very life but was he does it it becomes yours he's not gonna take it back that's what I love about it God is not going to take back what he gives you because he gives you his own life and he says add to your faith all right so he says how faith and be born again he said now that's your foundation but he says now this is my paragraph 92 of oneness this is my number five I want to pull it up this is my eye he gave me this I we don't what it becomes mine he's illustrating it to show you how much stronger it is to just say give me this and this is my eye see he takes it to Mary I'm showing Mary is given the seed of the woman now Eve wouldn't give that so don't get your mind into jangling no woman now what Mary got to do with is we're talking about Eva we're now that's back tire don't they just listen because you'll get your mind all jumbled up and trying to well how come and he using Mary the lorenz using Mary coat it wound it to be the seed of the woman which was Jesus Christ that was given to Mary it became her seed and like brother Larry comes to the office Sunday he said and God give me a seed we better get serious about thinking about it if he give me a seed it's mine and like I always say you know it's kind of carnal but this is my Bible they don't belong to you this is my Bible you may have one like it but it's not this Bible this is my Bible that God gave to me I thank brother Colley give it to him that's hurt but see it become mine so it's the seed of the woman the seed of the woman is Jesus Christ he came through the virgin wound to bring forth the product to pay for our debts and things like that cuz he come to Pais down that under you and I all right now watch what I'm getting at then the first thing is to be born again because in that then if you're born again don't worry about the virtues until you get born again you say well I've studied stats with Prairie man I think all this all this work on faith I work on virtue I work on knowledge I know you worry yourself to death won't get nowhere go the way God says it how faith and be born again then you can talk about virtue knowledge temperance patience and time but first how faith and be born again huh and see then when you do not watch what I'm talking about see he says it's my God gave it to me the new birth is yours it becomes you and God together as one in the new birth huh see then Paul said it's not I that liveth but Christ liveth in me and the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God God had put him his own life into the Apostle Paul it became Paul's faith then the ever born-again believer not just Mary now Mary was just a part of the the what you would call it the transmitter or the point of being used for the time she was just into that area what you see she now here's brother Branham we'll get back to this if you don't read masterpiece and see down there with her show you know run around sitting Mary's not to seat read the Masters didn't see what he said but Mary was the same he read what brother around him say it he said Mary was not the seed the seed was in Mary the seed was Jesus Christ now physically speaking Jesus Christ was in Mary right but spiritually speaking that never gave her the new birth she still had to be born again she was not say just because she could say she had within her so now you see one of the property said he said Mary is not to seed he said she represented Azusa Street of Pentecost he said they were not the seed they were a carrier and that's what Mary was she was a carrier of the natural life Jesus Christ was that seed see so she was she couldn't say I have the new birth but I have God within me that's what we say in that you know I mean you ask the kids and what do you say say words got out he's right in here rah see we climbed the new birth is God living and that's perfectly right we just remember Mary had to go to Pentecost to get the new birth the seed of the woman then was Jesus Christ do you realize then on the day of Pentecost I believe Mary was in the upper room right under there Pentecost there was not just one person there was 120 you know what that hundred and twenty had they were not just Mary carrying the seed see Mary then become born-again right but you know what 119 had the same thing she had right because the each one had the new birth come on then then each one could say this is my faith this is well as he could say it in other words Mary would say what I had within me was wonderful and great and all which they they even had troubles with it myself you remember she did she denied it and everything else I said I had trouble but said now I'm not just a carrier of the word I am now the seed itself but you know what Peter setting out to our hey sign time James John although same time Paul on the road to Damascus wooden hundred and twenty on the road to Damascus running by self when he got through what the hell Christ in you the hope of glory he had the new birth which was a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to him what did brother Adam say the new birth was cross the mystery of God revealed what'd he say he said the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you see that becomes something that Mary had this that could be brought forth from her which would be for everybody else but then would be for her to by her accepting it and I'm not the savior the the Christ but until she received that she did not have eternal life yet she had within her she had within her the one that would bring eternal loss she now know he turned a lot that's why this if people don't get that they don't listen to read around him they don't pay attention to the Bible I knew when I was in the Baptist Church that the Old Testament people didn't have the new birth then you can say well that's just young guys brothers they well okay forget it is it true well why does it matter who routed like what the lady said that times did you know she was hungry Nick some boys coming brought some food and set it on the porch and she come out of hollering and screaming praise God praise God for the food to praise God for the food little boys woke up and said ma'am then we brought that food us boys brought that food she said thank you Lord for the food and the ones that fought stick you know the ones that brought it thank you for them huh but see do you understand what I'm saying see they did not have that new birth back there Nicole Jesus Christ had not died see the seed of the woman had not been transmitted as well saying don't get tied up well will the seed of the woman back there in Genesis 3:16 that's that I see no no what I need you better get out of there in a hurry now these want to mess the whole thing up would you come over to Mary Mary had within her the seat of the woman with that never gave her a new birth she had to go to the upper room and receive eternal life then the seed of the woman was dwelling within her instead of just dwelling within her flesh it was in her soul and her being but so was it in every born-again believer right every born-again believer has that eternal life living in your soul which is the seed of the woman so why don't you say well Who am I I have within me the seed of the woman well you two thing with each other no no no I'm not I'm just being honest to tell you the truth that's what the Bible says that's what the Prophet brought to us what you see you don't pay attention maybe it's not meant to be that's all right let's see it means a lot when I read something and I read dirt as I said in the scripture where it says in Peter you know being born again by the incorruptible Word of God that means something to me that tells me how it took place that shows me how it would come into being and how the new birth would be the birth of the word the word that I heard now here's what I tried for the Sunday afternoon to get across see when you say that the Prophet says that the new birth is revelation of Jesus Christ personally you see in your mind will automatically transmit and thoughts and try to figure out things and you'll try to figure out what revelation is it that I'm supposed to get is it two seals it's a 70 weeks as it is now I'm gonna throw a rock hard and watch them every born-again believer that's the same new birth now you shook your head the other day agreeing with that for two or three Sundays in a row you've agreed that that's the birth the birth of the word and that everybody had the same new birth no matter what age there was then they had to sign new birth all right now you kind of picked up a little bit talking about the seed of the woman that believed in that ever born-again believer today every born-again believers ever been had within them that seed of the woman which with Jesus Christ the new birth right now let's see if you can swallow so Peter and Paul at the same revelation now you you go back and listen to Sunday afternoons message over again you'll see what I was saying Peter and Paul had the same revelation oh you say but but but Paul had a greater revelation the Peter saw him personally now I'm quoting brother anonymously in here okay Paul had more knowledge you call it Holy Ghost you know knowledge of the things because of his abilities and the points where he was being a prophet but Peter had the same revelation the Paul had so it's not trying to figure out well wave got a revelation of this and brother Donnie got a revelation of that scripture and sister got a revelation of this one and he's got a revelation of that one what is the revelation of Jesus Christ I'm asking you seriously think on it what is the revelation of Jesus Christ well he was Almighty God aren't you getting in good one then he was God made manifest inflation okay you're doing good keep following it don't lose that what I'm asking you what is the revelation you said well well God didn't reveal nothing to me the day I got born again no you mean the day you got born again that you never realized that you was a sinner and that God had come down and saved you come on no I shouted I cried figure you're still on that hookup I'm trying to get you off that hookup to get you on the straight line what happened when you were born again well I I was one person saw this one person see your own that you're not listening the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you don't you realize then that what happened the Bible said the goodness of God is what leadeth thee to repentance right so what would bring you to justification it would bring you to a repentance right did you not repent did you not cry out to God and asking him for to save you come on did you cuz if you didn't you didn't get it remember well the Prophet touted first you accept him but then if he don't accept you you're not saved now you need to go back three or four months and listen to some tapes you think I just drag things out listen you want to go back there for months and listen to some Tyson here would you do one thing favor for me would you go ask brother Curtin what I preached four or five eight ten years ago he'll tell you just what he told me this is the same thing you talk 10 20 years ago cuz he's back in our listening to he's had enough concern his heart to go back and listen then you know what his statement was now he don't like for me saying it I guess I'll just say it anyway he gets him in trouble I'm all raised in Kerrville it don't matter you know what he said he said why are some of the questions that are asked in the questions and answers forum steal the things brother they'll talk 20 years ago this is what he taught 20 years ago while you're not listening okay sorry brother curtain gets you in trouble at least I won't be by myself I'll have some help coalition Church I've been preaching the baptism with the Holy Ghost the new birth whatever revelation of Jesus Christ for 50 years you think it's war out on me to word it up still don't want to preach them I still like to preach it on a new burner and I don't see why anybody that would have the nuber wouldn't want to hear about the new birth I like to hear people talk about their their experiences I like to hear them tell about what happened but see you wouldn't think about it the way I think about it Peter is over here following the Lord Jesus for three and a half years goes to the Upper Room and the Holy Ghost Falls Paul meets him on the road to Damascus goes to the backside of the desert and stay just for a little piece and they come out with the same baptism when the holy go they both came out with a sign faith God's aim for one faith one Lord one baptism but listen you don't listen did you ever have an experience of where you realized he was a sinner and you needed to be saved have you ever had that well you know what that was that was God talking to you now if he was talking to you why can't you believe that what he was saying was the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you when I decided I just cried I don't know anything about these other things brother they'll talk about cuz I just done this not just doing that and I know I'm saved do you understand what I just say it what is the revelation of Jesus Christ well he was introduced into their seat are you going back up sit down and listen what is the revelation of Jesus Christ when God began to speak to your heart to bringing you to salvation there is his revelation because he's coming to tell you what he's going to do he's going to save you that's what he's come far it ain't a river or less forever life and it over here I was looking in the book the other day you know I found it I found it right there know what is sanctification well you don't do this you quit just quit that with it well you know a lot about sanctification that's good old Baptist had a better understanding that it's a what is sanctification sanctification is an inward work to try to cleanse that man it's not an outward I quit this and I quit that that is not sanctification sanctification is not I quit drinking I quit you quit sanctification is the change of you thinking the change of your nature your ways your desires are changing you become closer to God through sanctification now you tell me that in Revelation because you don't know what a revelation is a revelation is God speaking to your heart to not tell you something over here this that will drive home with you no they don't you know he's telling you what you are he's dealing with your nature do you understand see when Jesus Christ calls you to himself that was a revelation to you of him revealing himself to you now simple do we think it's some great example listen then when Jesus Christ calls you to come to himself now is that Bible the Bible says no man can come unless I call him right now that Bible you can't come because you want to come you come because he calls you why don't you take what he done when he was calling you and to be a revelation because he was revealing himself to you see when God gives you something then that what is given is the word being revealed to you this injury God is speaking to you calling you to himself yeah but I remember when Paul saw him on the road to Damascus I want to be like Paul no you don't want to be like Paul what I've always told you the only said Paul would be this Paul to be that if he's here and I said Paul to be in jail for for midnight tonight because he'd be screaming out and hollering about sin and it wouldn't be the law to be putting him in jail would be the Christians the religious people will be the ones who putting it in jail court he didn't understand what he's talking about when God calls you to sanctification he's calling you to a closer walk with him I quit this and I quit that that's sanctification brother Dale I quit this when will I never did drink there's some things I didn't do that you claimed salvation about taking away from you and I never done it oh trying to be a holier than thou ain't worried about wholly of what I'm trying to preach God's Word sanctification is not you quitting smoking and chewing tobacco you know like that sanctification is a cleansing and setting aside inside of your soul to drive that enemy out of you right take that as a revelation if you can't see that I haven't had a revelation brother Dale what take what I'm talking about on it to the new birth is God revealing his word to you telling you what he is doing in you right telling you what he's doing in you so would that not be a personal revelation code it don't save you to say I saw brother Branham come on it don't save you to say bread around and put his hands only no now come on I'm not against it you say brother Dale you're nothing why not I'm not throwing no stones if it is you quit throw them I'll quit go we're all living in the Glass House right you know the story you don't you don't start throw stones if you live in the Glass House you don't work too good listen Church the new birth personally to you now the day he started talking to you about salvation no you remember that you remember when you first come in contact with God you first you know God begin to deal with you and begin to to bring you remember that well you know what maybe your mama your daddy was sitting outside early maybe the pastor was sitting outside of you and you know how he wasn't getting the fine right it was something personal to you right fountain personal to you something made alive to you what you see when I look at things I look at little bitty things you listen Lord you've been doing this for a long time you've been revealing yourself for a long time it's the people getting it but what it really is it's because you can make it so big you can't attain them to it right you make it so small until it you belittle it to make it know you go this way and say well well I never done like Paul I never sold no angel I didn't see this or nothing I can't even talk about things that brother Dale talked about seeing angels I can't talk about cuz I've never done it well what's that got to do with it you see I could see those things and dine this and go to hell and you could see the truth out of it and go to heaven because gifts and callings is not what it's built on it's not whether or not you've seen angels whether or not you've done this dreams or whatever it's whether or not God has revealed himself to you you said reveal yourself to me you back to that now get what I'm saying about revealing itself to you when he speaks to your heart and calls you to salvation is he not revealing himself to you that's how simple to new birth then the children can understand the children can know that God has been dealing with them right and then they come back to your mamas and daddies and say well I need to be baptized I need to do this I need somebody you know because they're beginning to see things God is speaking to their heart he's revealing himself I never thought about it like that what are you thinking about I mean this is a serious matter it's either life or death for you and me but I brought it out I just never had nothing it's a great revelation do you believe in one true and living God what greater revelation could be you know that the world is against that you know that all Christendom is against the revelation of one true and living God you mean all of the millions of millions of Christians that are out there they're against the thought of one true and living God should you not be happy about what you see I better not say it I guess in the wrong way but remember I didn't say it's your prophet said it okay he said uh Neagle struts you remember that you remember that for the Prophet saying that an eagle struts well you know why can't we strut why can't we be happy about what God's done why can we not be joyous instead of Paul well I know I'm sick oh I'm not having problems you don't like for me to preach do you because I can remember where the Prophet said maybe that's put on to you to bring you to the Lord we don't like that one do we we don't like the point that we could be sick not as rough don't you say that people who say you know that we're sick for the glory of the Lord he said now if you're going that away said let's you got a lag all for the glory of the Lord let's just cut both legs off for the glory of the Lord now that ain't what I'm talking about I'm talking about God is trying her faith to see whether or not we'll hold out and he allows trials and troubles and heartaches to come our way to see what we'll do but you know what it's not for him to see what we'll do he knows what we'll do it's for us to find out what we'll do we're gonna fold up go home I don't like my brother down if he says that no I'll just quit and go somewhere that's goodbye I didn't run you off I didn't say a word to run you off I tried to preach the gospel but if you think it's better somewhere that's go go time's running out but do you understand what I'm saying do you understand even the little point I'm making in the whole message yet Sunday this is my if I have any of these things a virtual knowledge temperance patience godliness if I have any of those God gave it to me to put on my new birth I've never tried to make anything out of trying to say well I'm their sound editor what I did tell you one thing this is the only thing God ever spoke to me about on it he spoke to me one day about patience he said if you'll have patience with the people he said it'll prove you have patience well very good point I wish you'd speak about the rest of them because I ain't doing too good on placements but at least I can get off of that and say well Lord look over here this is working this way anyway you don't move it alright listen each one of these virtues is given unto us to add to our faith the virtue is given to add it to your faith knowledge temperance patience we'll get back to those points of how it comes into manifestation and want you to do it but I want you to think about something I don't do things to be smart ethically to show how much I can do or whatever I can you know know I try to get it to where you can see how great God is now he said add-ins they had faith faith is not a virtue faith is a birth faith is the new birth it's not you can't add the new birth to anything cuz it has to be the product itself justification and sanctification just taking care of the vessel God comes and Leos that is not him going through that justification sanctification it's him coming as a new birth to live inside of us and then we have an opportunity to study the message and to hear these virtues explained by the Prophet because that's what I've always said see the Apostle Peter you remember how we've been through this over and over Peter and Paul couldn't teach two different things now Peters teaching the natural perfect lands with Peter Paul is going through the adoptions and the thing and if you'll read blasphemous names you'll hear him dealing more with Paul basically than he does with Peter but he's still teaching the statue of a perfect man from the lady's dream that she had on it says add to your faith all right we've established the new birth is that faith and then as you progress in your studies then things can be added well the brother Dale I think I've got brotherly kindness but I don't believe I've got patience or virtue Allah now that that won't work now I'm just telling you up front now that don't work don't go that route don't think you're gonna jump up the ladder and get the Holy Ghost up the top when you ain't even got virtue down at the bottom because each one has got to be laid upon the other one and vulcanize together and seal together am i quoting the prophets you're supposed to be leading reading the message now then how many church age messengers are they I mean so change mesengeros and miniature choji's are they the seven the many messengers are they seven okay I mean virtues are they and when the ads are they when you're just getting this off kind of yeah I'm just trying to get it sensible to be truthful you see if you don't understand the ages how are you gonna understand all of it and it's fitting okay how many manifestations of God are V in the church ages okay one two three four six seven eight because this is the Holy Ghost that seals in so don't try to make that and make nine out of it see you're going too far thinking you're so smart that's nine how many manifestations of God are there in church age well there's only seven Church ages then you're still hooked in time because you're in lady asiye mmm-hmm I mean the manifestations of God are they each one of these is a manifestation of God faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness in love that's eight well I don't know where it's important for me to know that faith is not a bird or not a thing it's a birth and all that we've been through that way okay let's count again let me find it Oh number eight if they can get it pulled it up with his paragraph 217 of God's only provided place of worship but I run said there's seven a heads 7ix lucky you've got a here in seven years he's exactly right seven heads yeah I'm completely seven Church ages at Grace at this and this then there's seven ads and the last one is Christ was that and this is your charity which is what's your headstone now we go one two three four five six seven eight nine but we're really getting all in there we could have done with all that stuff tonight there's had many ads you mean listening don't add faith faith is not an ad it's a birth okay now then faith is a birth add virtue you got seven ads with eight manifestations same as you got seven church ages with eight manifestations because brother Branham was not the lady Ossian messenger brother branham was in the time of the Lady of seeing but he said don't do that he said you would make me a lady you'll see in okay take your church ages Paul Iranians Martin Colombo but random said that there was no messenger to the age of Lady of Syria he said because the holy ghost came himself for 64 seal book that there is no messenger to the lady of C&H he said because the Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness of the baptism which says as all the other ages and things are at the end of the age then the messenger comes word brother branham come did brother Branham come here and bring a message to that or did he come right here come on but you see you say well it don't matter B you don't know what age you're in you don't know what to expect you don't know what has happened we get it don't matter to you all I need just be born again all that won't do it be safe that's what my brother said years ago he said what does it matter where this that or the other about things I was talking to him one day method this is nice discussing some things with it he said what does it matter he said all I want to do is get to heaven that's all he said all I want to do is get to him well we've had fifty years to play with that little toy then all we want to do is get in the rapture all right how did we wind up Sunday I ain't looking for the rapture I quit looking for the rapture when I heard the prophets say your resurrection it inside of you read your Bible it says what it don't say rapture is not even in there they said the Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout force of Arcanine no trumpet girl when we got that right well what does they say what's the next thing for you and I the resurrection because the Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be changed so don't worry about the rapture worry about the resurrection all right the probably said your resurrection is inside of you that's your new birth when I saw that I began to shout glory hallelujah I quit looking for some kind of a something to be a rapture we started looking to see what the resurrection had for me the Prophet said no divine healing no resurrection right think about it little simple point it's my eye God gave it to me he gave me the new birth it's mine he can't take it away because they can't he promised you so he gave me eternal life in the new birth then these are the things he expects us to add and like I've always said people think that I try to belittle this try to belittle you realize what would happen and God not sent a prophet where would we know anything about the ages in the rapture the change or the resurrection or anything come on glory hallelujah for a rapture yeah but what if we're not die what if we don't know what bus to get home well the denomination teaching rapture go down to Masonic Lodge and they'll lay it right out down in the on the floor with you and take you for faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness I call the staircase next a lot of people teach you a lot of things that the people of this magic don't even know anything about cuz they don't want it they'd have to think I was thought I was doing pretty good do you start preaching okay it's my eye on God gave it to me he gave me the new birth the new birth is faith have faith and be born again then add virtue knowledge it all the faith and you've got one two three four five six seven adds now you got the hit stone on the church no I don't this is if dip down here's an ad okay one two three four five six seven eight now you well I got the headstone up now you ain't got to seven because then it was seven I adds name four seven Church ages but the Holy Ghost came on a zoo sir Street I'm quoting brother branham Holy Ghost came on the zoo sir Street in the fullness of the baptism you know that a lot of people in this message still think that a zoo so street people don't have didn't how the baptism when the Holy Ghost didn't have nothing come on church wake up listen to what you're hearing men stood right here years ago but he stood right down it little beautiful and I told him then he was wrong he came right here in priest the same time that Azusa Street name was false of course he's the guy that couldn't preach error well you shouldn't say things if the truth is the truth it's about time to wake up come on musician think on these things my faith God gave it to them new birth God gave me the new bar when that listen come on God gave you the new birth but he expects you and what's the closing point he expects you to add the virtues that's what your prophet said in the message statue of a perfect man he said these are the things he expects you to add well how can I add them you can add them by getting rid of that attitude right there cuz you've got the attitude well I can't do it you can't do it that's why we're here don't none of us you've got nothing I differ with you you can feed a patter around all you want to and stay here and lady he'll see you but just remember somebody is gonna walk off this earth and I'm gonna believe the word and walk in it and see where it fits or not okay what we got well let stand together I've been changed in a fillet anybody having a diol to roll to the water and up in baptize up in Boston bigotry from the creature that is was everything it's now my name James I've been reborn all my life has been rearranged [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] squats he said God named moon broke the record this the other day beats fresh 755 pound well that ain't strength that ain't strength my god raised the whole world hella doesn't hold it right now right if you want to deal with strength it ain't dad he said strength he's like what he had he said he lived the life and that was his pice to let it come out to me and you we don't need to exercise our muscles we need to exercise the studying of the word but now if all we're gonna do is read Gers Almanac we're gonna get grid Almanac and if that will be our religion but a revelation will change it one more then we'll go understand [Music] a spirit within me create in me a clean heart you're right spirit within me catch me not away from my friends and soul then take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of that salvation and renew a right spirit father we thank you for the night and we pray that what we said has been worthy great well if it's not then forgiveness just make everything right it's all into your hands because that's all we can do is try to give out what's been given to us we love you and we thank you and I pray that the people would not get the wrong attitude of me screaming and hollering to try to the Lord it's something to scream about when we say the Prophet said so-and-so and people just look and wonder is that true help us to study the word to know because the word said study to be approved a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth just come on the scene with us and that manifest yourself and father be with everybody on
