========================================
is is is no turning back amen i have decided nobody give me jesus do you follow me foreign oh is you saved my soul when i was lost to me me me me you heal my body is afternoon abc he's got a special so when i woke up to see another day this morning i was thinking about the way my savior is i want to keep his precious love in my heart i love his holy way he said father if it be possible like this for me nevertheless is this morning i and then the father came and took him home oh i wanna be just like jesus i wanna keep his precious love in my heart oh i wanna and when my trials are over you um i don't know any other place but in the bride to get together and the music just comes together it's it's beautiful the world will try to satisfy satisfaction foreign is sweetheart is oh is is oh jesus amen open the eyes i want to see open the eyes of my heart see you i am shining in the light of your glory is oh amen if you love him you really want to see him know you could just see anybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn back where we've been reading in ephesians and then we're reading this morning from romans 8. ephesians 1 romans 8. now remember the fellowship meeting this coming weekend and brother forney will be here preaching the lord willing for us and preaching it on the sunday services so keep these in mind and just come and have a good time with us our saturday for the fellowship meeting time and now also if anybody would like to have the cassette tapes downstairs of brother branham's message there's almost a whole complete set of cassettes on the wall down in wade sunday school room because we're planning on taking that down and redoing a little bit painting and fixing up and you can even have if anybody's already spoke for them now you get them but you know but if not if you can even have the racks that you go in because that'll be something you take and put them on your walls and put the tapes in but we need to find out if anybody wants them you know if they don't then we're going to we will try to find somebody else that would like to have them because we're basically using now the you know the mp3s and different things like that in the uh so we're not using those uh cassette tapes anymore so if anybody wants them you can have almost a complete set of rudder rounds tapes it's probably in the neighborhood of lever 1200 of them so you you're welcome to them and the boxes that goes with them as long as you want them so just you know and do it and if somebody wants to taste and somebody else wants the boxes that's all right too it is every which way you do it and they'll if you want them all right so remember that i think that's all the announcements of anything else you have anything we're missing all right okay ephesians 1 and romans 8. our heavenly father our lord our savior our redeemer or all in all and jesus lord is your name thank you for revealing yourself unto us and manifesting yourself among us in your loving grace and we look forward lord as the hour approaches that we're promised in thy word that as the enemy would come in like a flood the spirit of the lord would raise up a standard against him so we're dependent upon you we know within ourselves we are nothing but we know that with you inside of us then behold we are the bride of jesus christ we love you and we thank you and just bless each one be awaiting them today traveling the different ones lord that are not here just bless each one and just come and do as we sing open the eyes of our understanding lord that we may walk in you keep us and keep in and this let us be in you lord because that's what we want you said you sent your word and healed us so we believe you we thank you guide us now in jesus name amen ephesians 1 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ jesus according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved now go back to romans 8 verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry out by father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and join ours with christ it so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature wait us for the manifestation of the sons of god you may be seated lord that is blessing to the reading of the word as we've said we're trying to speak on adoption and trying to bring it out and we'll you know just thinking a while ago the lord willing i want to this coming wednesday in connection with this to to try to speak about the promises in the book that are promised to this end time you know and uh you know it's just kind of on my my mind so you know we'll try to deal with that a little bit the promise is specifically right down to where we're at because there's promises in the bible that cannot be fulfilled until this time this day this hour you know we thank god for that you know like i've told you the prophet has said you know that it's the word that's predestinated eternally so don't worry about it it's going to take place you and i have an option or a choice or whatever to call it to be able to be part of it if we desire it but god has said it and it will come to pass so we'll you know somebody can do it why can't we believe we're there right so we're here at the end time how much longer do you think we got don't worry about it i'm enjoying it where it is and uh everything and we will uh you know have a greater enjoyment later on all right now we were talking this morning about as i said we're on the adoption in three stages and uh you know we were talking about comparing it to the life and and journey of the lord jesus and i put this on kind of a little bit on each one where somebody hears it you know on tape or something they'll want to relate back to the other so bear with me that way kind of a little background but see then the lord jesus had a river jordan a baptismal time a time that the spirit came upon him right we believed those things because the scripture says it and the prophet says it and you know and then he had a time of that was his identification then he had a time of uh coming to authority on the mount of transfiguration not that he didn't have it before then but it was just like a time or a coming to a place or position you know there in the scriptures and then he truly had as we'll read later on to wit the redemption of our body to understand the redemption of our body and truly he had the understanding of what it was going to take place and he was going to make it manifest well then that compares with our journey because as i was saying this morning paul is not telling the people here in romans that we know you know all about the great adoptions and things like that so now all you got to do is just jump up here and take off no no he was just saying listen we're only using as brother branham would do we're only using the uh natural adoption to compare or to you know speak of as to type ever what you would want to use the wording there to see where you and i are at and what we're supposed to be doing and the things and that's why he would say to the romans are in verse 14 that and going on into 15 that being the sons of god but yet we received in what the spirit of adoption all right and that's what i believe the new birth is the new birth is the spirit of adoption because you and i have to be brought into the family by the new birth before we can talk about the growth development the the statue of a perfect man the coming to manifestation of the sons and daughters of god and all it has to be through the basis of of the fact that we've got to first be born again all right see then that way then peter would come over and say being born again which means a process of development of going along you know so we we're staying in the scriptures but the prophet we kind of laid on pretty heavily this morning on what brother random said about that we're not getting the people to christ we're getting them to a doctrine or an idea we're getting them to a head knowledge that's what everybody wants in us to have a head knowledge and listen we must have the head knowledge before we can have a revealed holy ghost knowledge all right i'm the very one that hollers about head knowledge we need head knowledge i would to god that everybody in here me you and everybody in the world could quote everything brother around him say it and had a photographic memory to be able to call it back i would to god we had that would be wonderful but still that's not the revelation see that's that's not the revelation nicodemus truly had a head knowledge of the bible as far as what he was in the old testament but then he couldn't understand how that they would have to be a new right i mean that's what he couldn't understand that it was going to be a new testament a new covenant a new uh new kingdom the he thought just like they still thought over the disciples even were still thinking it in in acts 1 8 there and and the ascension of the lord jesus you know and they said will you restore the kingdom to israel now they still thought it was a natural kingdom but he was speaking of a spiritual kingdom of the baptism of the holy ghost that he would have to give his life and then come back to live in us and bring to you and i the tutor and put the tutor inside of us all right now bringing that inside of us see it's not a head knowledge now that doesn't mean everything you've got in your heads revealed i would regard everything i would regard and he'd reveal everything that i have in my human cranium cap i guess you call it brain my computer of the head you know but see he only reveals and don't ask me how he does it i don't know i don't understand that i don't uh understand how that he can quicken one thing to you and not quicken at all and you're studying the whole thing at one time but he's god and he he knows how to raise children right he knows how to reveal his word and when to reveal it all right but see then to be the children of god we must have the new birth not a head knowledge we must have the word revealed to us that is the verb it's the revelation of that me all right and the tutor being on the inside of us then he will only quicken what we bring into him in purity or cleanness or whatever you call it uh you know he can't quicken something that's not right people say oh i had a revelation of the trinity no you didn't have a revelation of the trinity there's no such thing as a trinity and there's no such thing as a revelation of the trinity because if there's a revelation of it that make it real well it's not real no it's a figurative or whatever you call it of some people's imagination that was brought into its way you know way on back all right but now see that the tudor the holy spirit then being the one who's in the inside of us he's waiting on us to br waiting on us to bring him the word the prophet would say to word that he can quicken it to us all right so we must make ourselves available to the word study the word pray read you know how it is you read something you read it again you read it again you know you read something through it four or four five six times all at once well that didn't even hardly seem like that read like that one of the last times i read it see it's called something happened to you that quickened that instead of it just being the natural all right amen see that holy spirit can only quicken the word and you see why it's so important to hear the word i'm talking about not to just hear about it right i'm talking about hearing someone preach the word who can preach it and and let the holy spirit keep it straight because he can't quicken it if it's not if it's not right that's one thing we want to get plain to ourselves you know that that he can't quicken something that's not right well i i got a revelation of you know like the man told wrote around and said i'd like to straighten you out on you on your your your god heads you know he said well we're ready to go now you know come on and and the man started telling him you know and he said well now you know what college did you come from you know he had it all it had this great trinity you know and he said well even the scholars can't understand he said i know that's got to be revealed all right so now that's the main thing that i'm trying to get me and you to look at because the only way we killed this morning the only way you could be born again is by a revelation because that's what the new birth is all right see then the holy spirit be in the spirit the spirit of god the tutor to come and live in us and that is the holy spirit that you you can't make the holy spirit one spirit and the father another spirit so then god gave us the greatest tutor that could ever be what he came to live in us amen now he's wanting us to grow up into his nature in his ways from that that's within us as we eat upon the word now remember sheep only eat sheep food you know some animals you give them uh certain things and and it would kill them you know so you have to feed them according to whatever they they have need of all right now here's what we want to get on to this afternoon why it has been so long in the time of the child training i want to make sure you get this the reason we've been around here 40 what is it now just been 2011 somewhere in 44 years or something you know that we've been here since the prophet passed on all right now the reason we've been here i believe now just tell you what i believe you you do i believe that it's on the basis or has been because the people have not been preached the true word of god and you look around the message you can see it we're not talking about organized religion we're not out there in our denomination talking about them and what all they do or what this is or whatever we're talking about the people of this message the most mixed up group of people that seemingly have ever been in the world because a good baptist wouldn't come up with with the doctrines the people of this message come up with and say brother around and taught it polygamies and all the way down and all kind of things all right but see if the new birth is the birth of the word all right now if that's true if the new birth is a birth of the word then the holy spirit could only reveal the word and he can only feed on the word in the growth development process is that sensible see it would have to be the word all right now i see it this way we've had our own ideas we've had our thoughts and things brother adam would say we i i'm sure that we're not getting the people he wouldn't say you're not getting it i'm doing it but you're not getting see he said we're not getting the people to christ all right if we've had ideas of our own see we're not getting the people to christ all right and as human beings we do have those ideas you know most people oh bless god i've got to thus faith the lord will you know i've done the best i can do but still in all of that you wind up having problems as humans trying to express what you're talking about and i don't mind saying that we have tried in our own ways to get the people maybe to come to some place or whatever instead of preaching the word and just letting god bring it forth because it's proven around the world you know the country of the people of the message what they're trying to do and everything so that's enough to be said but as i said this morning you could you could preach the way that it's been preached by most people now for 40 something years you could preach that another thousand years it would not bring to pass the things that you and i need all right now i'm just dishonest i'm sorry it's just as honest as i can be because it has not brought any different it's brought divisions and brought other things and brought doctrines and ideas and all instead of the truth now see i believe children are birthed by the word and the building of the body of jesus christ the house of god the statue of a perfect man whatever wording you want to use is will only come to pass by the revealing of the word now not just teaching the letter of the word and i don't mean i can reveal it to you i mean that we must preach it to where god can reveal it but if we don't preach it correctly god can't reveal it is that sensible that shouldn't need a a great big light bug turned on to understand that see and if we get any of our ideas or thoughts involved see then it's not the perfect word being brought because brother rather said a preacher all he does is just breaks the spell satan has over your eyes where he can speak to you that's all i try to do i try to speak to the inward part of you that's why i don't beat on the bodies like most preachers i believe in living right i believe in being christians and and doing right i believe that because we're trying to be christians but yet beating on the bodies will never do anything it will never produce anything if it did produce it it wouldn't be worth anything it would just be a good people you know and i thank god we would love to have a worth full of them you know i mean i could say i didn't drink i didn't do those things but that don't make me any different in god it just makes me different in a natural life but in god it makes no difference because i was a sinner and really i was chief this why because i i didn't do those things what paul to me was talking about when he said i'm cheapest of sinners because paul was very close right but he had the life he had everything he had to work right now he had the word of the day until jesus christ stood forth right paul had the word of the day until jesus christ came on the scene then more was required all right but you see why to me then we're talking about the adoption and stages you see why that it's not developed like it's it it should have because that we've not fed the people the word you know and i i keep saying i say wait because see if there's any thought i have i don't know of it but that's where i preach like i do i i preach i i keep no secrets you know i mean i don't try to play around and get you to hear something play around get you to believe something you know and then let you get a great thing you know because you can go to if you want to know what a preacher believes go ask his congregation most time he ain't gonna tell you but his congregation will tell you well i hope to god that somebody could come in and say something about it and and i remember a certain people one time went to a youth camp and and they were you know talking about you know group that they were discussing the message and and one person looked over and said i know where you go to church well you know i mean thank god you know i mean they were confounding the rest of them over what they knew about it the young child the kids you know they said i know where you go to church well i hope that you can tell the people what i'm believing you know because that's what i'm trying to get it instilled into you you know to where you can do that see see i've tried to feed you on the word and not man's ideas but i i i'm honest i don't mind saying it if that hinders you and offends you i'm sorry we can have just at least a little bit of our own ideas it's anything that's contrary to god it don't matter how big it is or how little it is if we have any thought or concept you know i mean you know i have my thoughts a man years ago most of you know about it he he got on to me about said my daughter wore these blue jean jackets so that's a man's jacket well i come to find out she got buttons on one side for the women's button on the other side of the men and all but you know i just i just couldn't comprehend why he would be saying that about it because i knew that basically most of his people in the church were those stylish stuff you know but anyhow he said well i just don't see how you could be that way well i just told him i said well you know i just maybe i don't know what these things are you know i mean you know i have to ask people about things because i'm not that type of a person to go around and keep up with too much of the world but i didn't even know until then i didn't know women's jackets had the buttons on one side to me and let them on the other one i didn't know it i had to ask somebody to find out because i don't go around looking to them buttons on the wrong side another brother he kept on about and i just finally told him i said listen brother if your son comes up with a silk shirt on i ain't going to make him you know a little bit strong well i really didn't think about it till later you know he wore a lot of silt church so the brother shut up about it but yeah all right but listen i'm just saying that we're human beings and in our human beings we can have our own concept which is not according to the word of god all right and we will hold that concept and thought until god reveals it right you say well i don't oh yes you do so don't worry about it all right now here's my point what i've listened to most people that i've even heard preach about adoption it seems to run into the realm of the bases that when you say manifestation of the sons of god all right now it seemingly always runs to signs and wonders not of you know what i've preached before about this so you you know where i'm going but wait on the others a little and listen there's no one in this building that believes in signs and wonders any more than this man you're looking at i mean i don't say things i tell you that i don't tell things because i don't want it built up on the basis of me i want it built up on the basis of what the prophet has said you know and and doings and i don't go around all the time talking about what's happened among us and i believe in signs and wonders see i i don't see how you could believe the word of god and not believe it i believe the schizophrenic signs shall follow them that believe i believe that you know i mean i believe in a living god a reality of a living god i've seen him i've met him i've talked with him you know he's directly in the word i believe in a reality of a real god not just thoughts of our mind or or some kind of a concept i believe in reality but i also believe in reality you know i believe in the reality of the facts of one thing that we can get in our mind what something has got to be and then we can totally miss come on now did nicodemus miss the bible now was not jesus the word was not he the promise that was to come was not he and he admitted openly you have to be from god because no man can do the things you've done unless it be of god but he missed the reality i i listened to that a lot on the church they were brought around talking about today they say oh if we can get the the bible in the original greek and the you know the things and know exactly what that says he said they knowed it back time and he said knowing it back there they missed jesus when he came so then you can know it to the letter but without the revelation that's a different thing so we can get our ideas set and it's got to be this oh people have said you know if we had if you have what you say you have brotherdale we'd see more signs and wonders well i think we still see a lot of signs and wonders don't worry about that i can stand here the rest of the evening talk about them but i'm just you know just just to go on with the point that we we want to make it some kind of signs and wonders and i believe in signs and wonders it's like brother brown said you know about he said we we have stillborn babies you know we know what they are they're dead i mean the baby comes in the world screaming and hollering you know they don't come forth for the wound and say i'm hungry i just took the dream no it's just screaming it's hard out well the only way i can get something to eat and all i can just keep screaming i believe in manifestation of god i believe in the reality of god no i believe it but now listen i wrote it like this and i got it underlined real good i know and believe that there has always been signs and wonders of the living god now i challenge that on the basis of the entire bible it's always throughout the bible ever worked and throughout the church ages all through each one of them there were signs and wonders in the prophet's ministry there were signs and wonders and then we're gonna get down here die no there's things taking place we just need to open our eyes but if we get set on one narrow path and say well now that's the way it's got to be see probably maybe kaifas or some of them they probably had a good you know their they had a concept of what they was expecting don't you think so and they probably had it figured out that one of these days they believed the messiah was coming right they believed in all that now they had that all in mind and they believed he'd be a prophet and they believe it'd be god in flesh but they had it figured out that well what'll happen one of these days he'll roll up there'll be something like maybe an announcement because they believe that even today the jews believe that elijah is the preceded to come in messiah and i heard today brother ray was talking about sitting making a movie now or have made one or doing something on showing elijah well i hope they do and bring it out like it really is you know but see they they believed that they could have believed certain if it had come their way you following me a carpet rolled out here come right down to the walking right up to coppers you know old catholics you stayed with the truth and here i am to you we'll see hold on everybody believed it but by coming the way it did which was coming exactly the way the bible said it would come you agree yes right all right but by coming the way the bible said it would come they didn't believe it you think they could argue about the ministry of the lord jesus the discernment was there the the signs and wonders was there but could they argue about the prophet's ministry in the last days no they said he was a man of god oh speak highly of it but we just don't believe his doctrine they just didn't believe the word right because don't you believe his doctrine was ordered but you see i believe in this day that there are ministries ministers around the world now i'm just saying it this way the way i write it they have tried to preach the word of god i believe that i believe there's a five-fold ministry in the land around the world i say that meaning it around the world different places around the world you know ministry five full ministry and they've really tried to preach the word i believe that all right but people are looking for signs and wonders and failing to to listen to the revealed word and in doing that it has brought a condition that you know people are blinded to the truth now and i'm going to make another statement which is real strong so listen all right god has allowed this to take place right now he said i didn't god said he sent prophets among you to try it now he's talking about false prophets right come and give him signs and wonders and different things he said they're trying to see whether you'll stay with the truth or not all right see now i'm putting it that way because i'm putting as strong as i can that god has he didn't make it work this way but he has allowed it to take place to try you and i and we've been 40 years and we caught it in the temptation of the wilderness all right to trash he took 40 years back there with the children of israel to try them to prove who was what and who would go into the land and who wasn't right all right see so everything right around and said there's nothing out of cater the united wants our caterer but see people looking for signs and wonders they won't follow the truth right because if somebody got something over here you watch them a young man come in the message you know especially young or something you know they'll do it and and the people maybe he's got a little ministry a little guilt or something people just flock after it just run after it just leave churches and just move and just jump up and go with this dude to follow some kind of a ministry well and i've always said leave them alone and people will say well destroy it brother rather than not just leave him alone because according to the bible you know if that be not of god it'll be made manifest but if it is of god it'll be made manifest right leave it alone my fussing argue about it just let them go home you know let them have their way all but now see people don't want to hear there's something to say right down on the word they had rather fellowship and and believe and listen and go here somebody that can can attract attention or even uh you know build you up emotionally and make you feel good about what they're saying and certain phrases or words that can be said to make you really build up to where you can say oh we've really been to church but what was preaching i don't know but we have a big time well you know now you know i'm not kidding and you know i'm telling it like it is so don't uh you know don't think brother dale's trying to make something no i'm just telling it like it is because you've seen it but see church i believe we need to see more of god all right we have sick among us we have things among right we need more of god i believe in that i want to see these bodies change i want to you know it'd be nice to be young again wouldn't it no but see i know that it has to come by the revealing of the word all right and i know too that we cannot we cannot even the ones that are trying we cannot reveal the word of god nobody can reveal the word of god god is the only revealer of the word the brother said the holy ghost is the only revealer but around can't reveal anything to you he can only tell you what god says jesus himself he said i do nothing until my father shows me all right now see we cannot make manifest the things that people are looking for and you know what god don't want it that way that's more signs and wonders out there and as a whole because there's not that many of us but you know as a whole you go out among organized religions you go out among the the people that you know the pentecostals etc and you go to the good the baptist now and i mean they're just having healing they're having all kind of things happen around the country but you see god is allowing that to take place but you see there's gonna come a day when all miles are gonna be but it'll only be for a short time it won't be no no no worldwide sweeping thing all right see and listen now i wrote this because i know what has happened the i try to explain things and i know people says oh you don't have to explain well it's all right but i try to explain things but in trying to explain things people automatically get the idea that you're trying to explain it away you know no i'm trying to explain it like it is not try to explain it away explain it like it is because see then in doing that to explain it like it is it leaves us you know a problem right because you get the idea you know well that's just a way of explaining it that's why i've been called an intellectual for the basis of where that you know you take that intellectual ability and you just break something down and you just stay on it and just explain it well it's all right if you knew my brain you you would never say that but that's why we get over there it'll be okay because you see my i got problems with mine you'd have to take my word on that intellectualism is not knowing and the ability to learn and to be able to quote that's not intellectualism that's why brother brown said intellectualism is a sign of satan right that's just his words all right but you see we try to explain things away and then blame me for trying to explain things i'm not propping up anything i don't have to profit it i can stand here you've witnessed it we've witnessed the works of god among us that we can stand here and talk this afternoon a good bit on the things god has done among us well that's true it's happened okay now so then it's not something to try to explain that we're really we're not looking for these big things no i'm looking for greater things every day greater and greater brother branham who was it talking about the uh he was talking about one of the churches messengers he said he wouldn't have it till all of his people in his church had the holy ghost it was full of the holy ghost and signs and wonders taking place every service now i'd love that but you can't explain it to people because when you start telling them this the flat truth about it then they start going haywire because they think you're trying to explain it away you know when i tell you say okay you know go to the doctor and let the doctor give you the medicine and we pray it's sanctify the medicine and we have operations and we do things like that well you just don't have the faith you had the faith you'd preach it to tell us not to do these things well i don't have to explain that you've been around most of you long enough to know that you know you can prop up things for a little while but after a while it's going to get you so go ahead you know i believe in a super duper faith yes i believe in a god that is super duper but i believe he also gave us doctors he gave us medicine he gave us things to do and told us things to help herself and i believe we'll do that you don't see me eating pork like crazy when i called pork going around your blood pressure i love it but i stay away from it that way so then i think we would be dissensible let my own christians were to be sensible but now the point of trying to get is what if we look at manifestation and if we can see things take place we think something is taking place that's what i want to do wednesday night to learn with it i want to try to bring the scriptures of like the promises in the book there's a lot of promises in the book that have been fulfilled right but you know there's a lot of promises for this day right now that has never been fulfilled and i'm looking forward to them being fulfilled changed the moment of twinkling right becoming the fullness of the godhead bodily all this happened the other prophet has said and the thing i'm looking forward to that but i know and realize my point is to what we've tried to make manifestation signs and wonders now i want a definition for that i want a definition for manifestation or manifest or manifesting and i want you to bring it in the bible i want you to bring it through the prophet's message where did he ever put signs and wonders ahead of the word signs and wonders were to vindicate the word not signs and wonders first it is the word first these signs shall follow them that believe believe in first signs and wonders followers show me in the message show me in the bible you on internet you're listening to it whatever send me your benefit your definition of manifestation well it's just make manifest just go out and do things where's it at your prophet said they'd never be in hospital he said i did but that don't mean you can't empty half of them or hide for the hospital right see we take those and people have justified them no i'm not doing that but you see i'd like for you to give me your definition of the word manifest our manifestation which is a you know manifested is the past tense and manifestation is the completion of manifest give me your definition of manifest as i said most you know i've preached this to you for so many years you know what i'm going to do and everything but some have not heard it and somebody there's not heard it maybe we need to think about it a little bit too webster says manifest webster now i didn't give you that now i'm not reading this thing we'll read what brother what the strong concordance has but webster says the word manifest means to readily perceived by the eye or the understanding now go on read your web readily perceived by the i or the understanding it means to apparent you know something clear plain you know apparent to the eye in other words something's seen by the eye all right now it means to prove now manifest means to prove put beyond doubt or question it means to reveal it means to disclose it means to make manifest you know all right now that's webster now i'm just playing language now i've done said what i've said about healings and signs and wonders and manifestations so if you go to sleep on me now and don't hear the rest of this and wake up and i'm drawing something else then you got a problem according to the strong's concordance the word manifestation which is taken during romans 8 and verse 19 we're talking about the manifestation of the sons of god i gave this to you we'll read them it's the number 601 which is strong's concordance i mean 602 i can't pronounce these big words you know but i i surely like to read them and that word there means revelation now if you're reading it looking on number one of your notes the word manifestation means revelation be revealed to lighten you know that don't mean less weight you know that means turn the light on another word means manifestation means coming it means appearing at the appearing of our lord jesus christ at the manifestation of our lord jesus christ yeah you understand a lie laying anyway behind you bear laying something there you know making naked a disclosure of truth instructions concerning things before unknown used of events by which things are states or persons hitherto withdrawn from view are made visible to all manifestations it means appearance now the next one is the number 53 18 which is the word manifest you know which these things the scriptures say are made manifest right like luke 8 and 17 or matthew 6 and 4 is using the word openly is the same as manifest and it says in order to reward the openly things that are in secret shall reward the opening the word openly is the same as the word manifest okay or to make known right so then it is coming the word manifest is coming make the word manifest openly known abroad spread abroad outwardly outward appear apparent manifest evident known manifest in other words to be plainly recognized are known the word manifested which is used like mark 4 and 22. it is the word 5319 which is to make manifest appear manifest show to be manifest show oneself manifestly declare manifest forth to make manifest or visible are known what has been hidden or unknown to manifest whether by words or deeds or in any other way make actual and visible realized to make actual invisible realized to make known by teaching to become manifest be made known of a person to be known of a person who is exposed bring into view make manifest to show oneself appear to become known to be plainly recognized sterling understood who and what one is all right now so then it's not saying talking about this signs and wonders if you read that and listening it's talking about making known bringing something to an understanding bringing it in view making it plain something that has been previously unknown brought out to where you can see it or understand it or perceive it see all right and see in doing that now let's go ask brother branham brought around what is manifestation what are you talking about manifest all right number four in your notes go away jesus 1950 60 63 on 11 30 the evening service read all the way down just getting what we got on the line how they rest assured we are sure that they are the christ how could they because they sing the promised word vindicated and that's going to deal with signs and wonders right but it's not all of it see all right in other words make manifest make known you know they didn't have a bit of trouble about jesus healing the sick raising the dead right am i true is that right but when he began to make known the word so the living word of promise was made alive projected right through that body and they know that was god in him nicodemus said you have to be a man of god now watch message psylon 64 0-12 he said i'm jesus jesus said i come from god and i go to god the same light has come to what manifest now that same light has come to do what manifest make known to the people the promises that he's made for this day manifested light of the day the darkness is darkened okay to make nothing all right i hold your point till we get where we're going but look at the next one manifested sons of god based in 1965-18 that'll be one of those one two three four of adoptions we've given you the definition 1965-18 with earnest expectation the whole creation is waiting for the manifestation see the manifestation what is manifestation making known okay simple the world and what have it is under they're looking for it all around the world they're looking for where is these people we've had uh we've had the mighty russian wind we've had thunders and lightnings we've had oil and blood we've had all kind of things but we failed to hear that little still small voice that attracted the prophet that wrapped the robe around him and walked up and said here my lord now the next one is christ the mystery of god revealed wrote around and said webster says reveal is to make known to make known by something like a revelation to make known all right now well brother dale you're trying to explain away all that what we believe about the signs and wonders of manifestation no sir reno i'm trying to give you the definition of manifest or manifested or manifestation where we get in the right order what to make known first then signs and wonders follows the making known the making known the prophet would you know in his earlier ministry remember he used to let someone else preach and then he would just come out and and and pray for the sick well you know he quit that now you know your definition i don't know i never did ask him i don't know where anybody else ever asked him why he done that but i have my definition of why i believe he did because he didn't like to come out behind somebody didn't preach it right i mean i know what i would be if the man wasn't preaching it exactly the way brother branham wanted to preach because he was wanting the people built on the word then he walked out and god performed the word he didn't he quit letting anybody else preach and he preached himself then he come you know and what did he come to do to make gnome right what did brother brown try to do he tried his best to make god known right not rude around him right agreed he come to make god known now what did jesus come to he didn't do to make his own stuff known as that scripture we got a few written down in here you know he come to make the father known and he stood out there with that word and he would bring that word down and that great apostle paul would come through there and take those old testament scriptures and tie them together and bring it down and that's what got me you know because i knew that's what he was doing and then here would come brother branham and he'd go back there and get them old testament scripture he'd tie that together and not follow him down it's like following paul because i knew that's what paul done paul was trying to make god known you know what god made paul known jesus was trying his best to make the father known not his own self and as he made the father known the father made him known with signs and wonders to take place you want signs and wonders make the father known that's all i've ever done and he's made it known among us with signs and wonders okay i believe that and i don't have no problems i don't i'm just you know but the whole world is waiting on the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god now anointed ones are having great signs and wonders i believe that's god doing those things don't you because the devil can't heal but the little bride she has one desire in her heart i have one desire and that's to make my father known i've tried my best to make my father known to you 35 years of pastoring trying to make god known to you not to try to make brother dale known or anybody else known that's why we stood alone right they tried everything in the book to bring us into some of these doctrines and come around us and things like that and just i just couldn't go along with it yeah you know i just couldn't go along with it i mean that's just honest and i studied them because i'm a person that likes to study something out to make sure that i know what i'm talking about all right and that way then see it's not trying to make me and you know him here's where the trouble there's where people see like adoption they think the father's leaving the scene the sun's coming on the scene so then you see it and then see that they're trying to bring their cells out right they're wanting yourself seen look what i've done ain't none of us done nothing it's either god or it's not because it don't work but see the word manifest is to make known not it's if we make him known he'll make us known preach the word signs will follow the word you see you can take gifts and do things and have all kind of followings me i even told the brothers certain brother i told him i said i said i i've got four years ago that the lord would speak to me and i said i began to see what was taking place and i said i actually backed away from that ministry and he said you're not done it i said no i said because if i'd kept pressing it would have made it would have brought me out and people would begin to look at me and i said i don't want people looking at me i want the people to look to the word and to the god that's in you i said i want you to see the word and he said you order pressed on i said no something you because i don't want to be something to make me known i want god to be made known in you that's like your brother said you know when the when when the brother told it the pillar fire was up here you know and then it went down like that and started out and the brother you know immediately said well it's leaving we've got to do something to get it to come back and if it's leaving you can't get nothing to bring it back begging him back don't bring god back that's why i made my statement and i still stand on it i said he left him up here because that's what i wanted and he went right back there among you because his brother never said he went out the door he said he walked went down and started that way and that's exactly what i tried to do i tried to preach god from here to you whether you agree with that or not that's nothing to me because that was you'd say i wouldn't do that myself that's all right that's just brother dale i want to see god in your life i want to see god in your experience i love to hear people's experiences the word god would speak to him and tell them things i love that you know why because that's my god you're talking about that's my father i think that's what it is in the end time the end time is not to wind up with a preacher behind the pulpit that's what brother brown said they'd done in the early age he said they put it all on the preacher he said that wound up being the nicolaitan because they began to rule with those things right i want to see god in your life because the time keeps going on you know hey i brought in probably going to live very many more years i ain't talking about how many but i'm 71 and i'd sure love to see that if we're going to be around here 20 more years i don't think i'll be preaching i'm just honest i'm you know i'm going to believe it that way but i want to see some of you young people take over where i'm at and go home and carry this message on we're not told how long we're going to be here where's the other problem everybody thinks of this and that god don't have no time but he's got a word and if his word ain't fulfilled time will exist as long as god's word ain't fulfilled but when it's fulfilled forget about it time it over amen there's things in the bible we'll get to it wednesday that's not come to pass and if it's not come to pass then all right let's get on with trying to get to the bases to understand it because it doesn't even say down there about the where it says about the the uh you know to it the redemption of our body look up that word to it that means to understand right to understand the redemption of our body you could have everybody in the world adopted and that still wouldn't be a change it would still have to take something that god is going to do right there to make it change the body see we can everyone stand here ready but there's still something we're not running out of something to preach we just get to where we can preach but you see the word manifest is to declare or bring out in the open things that were hidden it means to to be made known by teaching you've got the definitions in front of you it means to expose it or to bring it into view or to thoroughly understand that's why i'm not down and out because we're here in the year 2011. but you know what it was when someone was talking about the other day you remember when 2000 come around everybody was scared to death oh we don't know what it's going to be someone said you don't have a watchdog service i said yeah well lots go out at 12 o'clock let's bring you a flight slot make sure your gas tank is full if you're doubting all of it just make sure you got a full tank of gas and that's a sensible thing to do anyway on a watch night service bring you a flashlight because you think the world's going to end because the lights go out no but you see it's just god's just letting it roll the longer he marched with the children of israel out there around that mountain something the more people died off right the old fighters died off there's only two of the original old fighters joshua and caleb now there's a group there that was 20 years old when they come out they'd never been circumcised go round and round the land for 40 years but before they could go into the promised land they had to hold it and they had to have a circumcision and those that was born in the way because they didn't circumcise them no more after they left egypt rich obama so they had a stopping sign and you know time to stop a dispensation of circumcision a time that they had to wait until everything was right but you see church if we make him known he will make us known then read the rest of the quotes that i gave to you about people will come to a place that they'll speak the word and it'll create i believe that but it's like i told him when i first come in the message everybody then back in the 60s or 67 well i'll be glad when we come to where we can speak the word i said you got to get it first you know i didn't understand why people didn't understand that point that's very simple to me well you had to get it first well we see everybody saw well what do you mean get it we got the prophet's message and then i'd quote things and i just got where i'd carry the books with me because i quote someone they'd say i didn't know he said that i said well i said so-and-so one brother one day he said i just listened to that tape and i didn't hear him say it read the book did you say it yeah well see but see that way you become a smart aleck i never have understood that i don't know what an alec is i'm sure he ain't smart but now listen the whole entire bible is pointing down to a group of people that can make god known the prophet of god said i've done the best i can do breaking this down to you i'll give it to you in big nuggets he said the fifo ministry will pick it up and they'll break it down to you well see i believe in a holy ghost living in everybody and you know what sisters i love to hear you talk about god like i said sister birds you know she she was very illiterate in their bases and she wouldn't mind me saying that because she couldn't even hardly write her own name and she wouldn't even buy we went to get her a stove one day and she wouldn't buy stove it had all the modern convenience she said all i wanted on and off that's true i'm not throwing off on her but you know i preached one night all i could preach you know but i'm just preaching on the godhead you know and the things like that he come from god and went to god and i told you about it on the way home that night she said brother i see what you talking about i said dear she's yeah said he come from god went to god said he's god all the whole time i said i wish i'd let you preach because i spent an hour and a half trying to explain that she brought it down in simple terms i love to hear you sisters talk about it why because you gotta have my wife's gotta have her own holy ghost she's gotta have her own change in the body see you sisters you know i love to hear you talk about the word that's why we have a good time on on a saturday night bible study we just sit down just talk and just eat popcorn and just sit there and talk about the the message you know have a good time at it and the sisters most of the time sisters will do a lot of the talking then because they'll they'll open up you know a little bit and i enjoy it but do you understand what i'm trying to say now folks we think manifestation is signs and wonders but get the word first and then signs and wonders will follow it but it's word first it's never been signs and wonders now you say what now wait just a minute now what about back there where the son of righteousness arising healing in his wings you better remember one thing while those signs and wonders was taking place there was a prophet being prepared in the word right that's what i talked about while ago he started out letting other people preach and he come behind him but he went long leasing that wasn't working he started preaching at the same time the signs and wonders were striking the world as a promise from god the prophet was being made ready in the word standing there in the word and that's what everybody else everybody said about him said you know you can't say anything about his life you can't say anything about all because it's all wonderful i said we just don't agree with what he said you know he's teaching well that's what he said i remember the man stood up and told it one day there and meeting you know and said did you believe brother brown while he's in the discernment and all i can say when he starts preaching said you know that word he walked out behind him you know and this sweet little homeboy he said you know somebody would say that there's really got to be something wrong because you see that's the sign of god is the revealing of his word and he to whom the son will reveal it the son came to make the father known and the son was made known by the father is not that the way that we're supposed to be so you see why did i preach the way i do and just keep on preaching and just keep going the lord's took care of us and he will but there is a word to be fulfilled thank god for it told me thank god for the word his word and then manifestation we make god known do you understand what i'm saying he'll make us known that goes for women children and all make god known what have i done here many times we'd be praying for somebody and i take a prayer cloth hand it back i said whatever person in here to pray over this men women and children right but i believe the children can trust god we're us old adults a lot of times done set too much and we have problems when young kids can believe i want to see god living in a church now this is not set to be one person it's said to be god living in the church manifesting himself and according to the bible it didn't say now and it will end it and then we'll pick up later it didn't say that the whole world was waiting on brother branham to come he said yes it does no it just says he'll come behold i send you a life to the pro but then when you get over in romans it says the whole world waiting on the manifestation of the sons of god brother branham done his job he brought us to work it's our job to get into the word now and to bring forth the dead to bring forth the things that happen and he's in the grave waiting on us whatever you believe to take place on down through there that's up to you and what's going to take place but you better remember one time the dead's gonna be raised and god is gonna live among us let's stand together spiral book number four over three number four three in the spiral booth have a need the author's open come and let's see uh oh oh is the abraham let me see you held that seat and not long enough the ladder reign is gonna follow me you know why i believe we're here right down the road this afternoon on the way home he don't have any for sale sizes on the home foreclosure signs are everywhere the law won't let that happen definitely oh good living prophet said keep it home alone the spirit of the lord we are everybody oh oh oh two oh oh foreign okay so so you
