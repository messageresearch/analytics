========================================

today we want to talk about lies uh last two nursing homes we went we talked about life but today I'm just going to turn it up a little bit more uh one one time this this brother went with us and he told them he said uh each Christian that's born in Christ is born in b and God's house our house fores everybody that mean we go there to not try to confuse them or TR try to bring them into the message we try to just lead them to the Lord so I think what he said went about the see the first letter that was ever given on Earth was God God spoken word he he said let there be light and there was light that turned the darkness into light okay let's do uh Genesis 1 1 through 5 in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said there God said let there be light and there was light and God saw that the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day Genesis 1116 and God made two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day and the Lesser light to rule the night he made the Stars also 1 John 1 1 15-7 this then is the message we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light remember that part God is and in him is not Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth do not and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleans us from all sin John 12:35 and Jesus said unto them yet a little while as the light leave you walk while you have the light that darkness comes upon you for he that walk walth in the darkness knoweth not whether he goes John 8:12 then Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that follow me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life the message uh rising of the sun brother said now the Sun at the rising of the sun well there was a time when the world was laying in utter Darkness it was without form and it was void and it was all covered with water and was there and there in the dark this one gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of God moved upon the water and said let there be life he said God had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there was seeds that he had planted and he had to add the sunlight to make it l just like when you plant your tomato in it light so nothing grows onless we had light and the first light was ever given to Earth with God's spoken word the first light that ever struck the Earth was God's spoken word he said let let there be light and there was light that turned Darkness into light in order to bring forth that creation of joy and life upon the earth and the spirit of God as he moved with love and compassion at that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the Earth the Sun Rose and swept the cross this raised and dried up the water from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the Earth by a seed that was a great power but all it wasn't nothing that Sunrise like the sunrise on the Easter morning this time with the sun leaping into the skies it brought forth the greater Sunrise than ever because it came greater news with the sunrise than it did with the sunrise at the beginning this Sunrise brought a news that he is risen he is quickened from the dead ahe he promised he has risen from the dead the first time the sun rose in Genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the Earth Immortal Life but this time when the sun rose there was a du Sunrise another sunrising it was not only the Su Rising but it was the s o n had risen to bring eternal life to All God's promise see that for knowledge he had seen laying upon the Earth no more could the B live back there at the beginning without the sun to bring it to life no more than today when sons of God is upon the Earth it takes the S so life to bring them to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world you can read Jeremiah 3135 think fast might need to give us a minute to look up yeah let read before I forget Jeremiah Jeremiah 31:35 there's man it's Jeremiah 31:35 thus say the Lord which giveth the son for light by day and the ordinance of the moon and the stars for our light by night which divided the sea when the waves thereof Roar the Lord of The Lord of host is his name read psalms you don't have to go through if you want Psalms 119 105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path Psalms 271 the Lord is my light of my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid of now some men like Darkness better than they do light but I like what Joshua said Joshua 24:15 and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods give you guys enough time like the guy preach over here last just rattle it on choose you this day who we will serve whether the gods with your father serve that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord a tile okay in the message uh there's a man here that can turn on the light if if you want to Le about light has a lot of stuff about light this now when you see his word being Vindicated other words may known prove that that is a light the light of his spoken word and without light light nothing can live without light there is no life upon the Earth today but what has to come but the light of the Sun in B life and so forth and there's no eternal life outside of the sign of God see he is the light same message and that's the way God has today his seed is already here his word the only thing you need is light on it he is that light for he is the word the word and the light is the same thing the light in there is the light of the of the word is the light The Germ of Life lays within the Grain and the grain is the life is what breaks forth and brings forth the light of the grain that's the way that that's the way that Christ and the world makes the world do what it's supposed to do just like the life and the grain of wheat or whatever it is it makes it we do what it's supposed to do because it is the life that's in it and spiritual life eternal life can only come by God's Spoken Word of Life Light was the es this time in him is light and in him is not darkness and he is God spoken spoken light th God spoken a word for in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and it's forever God see it takes the light of God to strike the work to make it live here's what he spoke now let the light shine that the Light Shine the Light will bring every word to his right right position in It season now in all ages has set forth so much of his word for each age God always sends somebody that can that their word can get into and show the light of it that in every age it does the same thing it always does that John John the Baptist came to introduce the light that's why uh told Brother brma as John the Baptist came to introduce the first coming of the light your your message will pour on the second coming of the light not only did he say I'm the light but he say you are the light if his word is in you bearing record of itself then you are the light you are the light of the world that at the end we going to be down light that this world will ever see no no Noah Noah was the light for his day he light so was Noah the light in his day he was the light Noah was that light he was a light to what to make God's word I will destroy man upon the Earth that I created build an ark and all desires to come into it will be saved Noah walked out there and said there's one there's one way and that's an ark they said that old crazy fanatic he was a word made manifest Noah was the light of the hour sure was in his day his AG his age he sprung forth light and Moses was the light of his of his hour I'll surely visit you God said to Abraham I'll come down and I'll take out of the people with a strong hand and I'll show my power in Egypt and when Moses up there met that burning bush up there and found out that I am was in the Bush Moses went down there and he was a light no wonder he could take some dust and blow it up out up and say Let There come fleas upon the Earth he had the word of God what happened the dust began to blow and flee began to come into existence why he was manifestation he was the manifestation of the light of God's word of plag Egypt he was a prophet what he said had had to come he was a light of that day he was God's light now Pharaoh might had everything he wanted to have and the rest of them all the priests had what they wanted but Moses was the light while he was shown from forth God's manifested God's promise I'll bring them out under a strong hand I'll get myself Glory that's what that's what he was doing that's the reason Moses proved that he could create not because he wanted to create because God told him to now go to the congregation tomorrow the Lord God has just spoke to me take a handful of dust and throw it up in the sky like this and call for it there's none here but it'll be there I hope you're not asleep for manifestation he said I sent God did say to our father surely he visit us down here and take us out I come to prove you you the hours at hand get rid of what you got let's go Elijah was

looks awfully dark no matter how dark it gets you can can't see your hands before you just remember there's a man here that can turn the light and he can Rapture the church in the message the great comeon Revival brother said and today it will be light in the evening time and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is this revival is God's life in the last day there's a lot of lot of things happening uh in in the world this year whatever you know tsunamis earthquakes uh tornadoes floods uh I think when the tornado tornadoes hit it was like 250 tornadoes and uh 350 people died or more so and the floods kind of reminds me of that that's brother talk about the in storm you know I've seen pictures of the floods where the water on the on the top of the top of the houses you know and he preached that uh message on the incoming Stone where he talks about that chicken farmer that they came and gave him a warning he said there's a big storm coming six shelter and he said nonsense they always talk about that but it never happened so he said well at least let your wife go and he said no he said I'm the head of the house no you know she's not when that storm came the water got top of the buildings and they when they came back they found the the lady and the kids all bidden by snakes because the water Rose and the snakes everybody went up there too and that man they never been find I guess they didn't find these chickens either I don't know now what what is Darkness an absence of light you know have you ever been in an area that flooded like that and actually seen seen no but uh when they hit them tornadoes I went towards naan and there's this tornado came in down on 75 right we saw that and they cut the trees look like tcks and then went across the road and they Bend all that railing and stuff and then went across the other side and did the same thing to the trees it look like toothpicks it's like a c just come down and takes everything and like I said they flip tractor trailers over and all kinds of stuff I lived in south Georgia when in '94 when they had the flood down there what you see on TV is nothing yeah compared to really actually witnessing it it is unbelievable I got up early in the morning that day and uh G it was little drizzly stuff drizzling a little bit when I got to Atlanta already had like toward towards a that way so they L always me right we also must be careful as the devil can transform himself into an angel of Light uh Second Corinthians 113 15 I wish I could just talk by way there I he just don't say I'm what was the scure uh 2 Corinthians 11 13- 15 for such are FAL Apostles deceivers workers transforming s and themselves into Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light there is no great thing if his Minister also be transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works here in Acts 2618 to open their eyes and to turn them from Darkness to light and to from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins inherit among them which are Sanctified by faith that is in me Revelations uh 21 23-25 and the the the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof and the nation of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of Earth do bring their Glory and honor into it and the gates of it shall not be shut At All by day for there shall be no no night there see yall want to study about light I mean I could have talked all here and I don't have my security blankets I'm going to let you all go
