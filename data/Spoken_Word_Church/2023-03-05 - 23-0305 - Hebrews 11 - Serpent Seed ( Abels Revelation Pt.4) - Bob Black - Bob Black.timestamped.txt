[0:01] God bless you Saints good to be in the
[0:02] house of the
[0:07] Lord let's just jump right in and we'll
[0:09] look at a couple of slides and then
[0:11] we'll we'll read our scripture what
[0:14] we've been talking about is is in uh
[0:17] Hebrews 11 of what what faith is and how
[0:21] that's the only way that you can please
[0:23] God and how Abel had a revelation and we
[0:26] just and and all the others Enoch and
[0:30] and all the other on that are mentioned
[0:31] in the Hall of faith in Hebrews 11 but
[0:34] brother R said in the power of God he
[0:36] said Abel by Revelation he saw that it
[0:38] wasn't fruits that brought us out of the
[0:39] Garden of Eden as some people still
[0:41] think it was but it wasn't
[0:43] fruits it wasn't fruit like Kain thought
[0:46] it was the blood of his mother who had
[0:48] made him mortal over his father now look
[0:50] how he's he's kind of uh uh yeah exactly
[0:54] he's correcting it was the blood of his
[0:57] father who made Immortal so he came came
[1:00] and offered the blood of a lamb by
[1:01] divine
[1:02] revelation no one did tell him anything
[1:05] about it but he by faith he seen the Son
[1:07] of God coming and offered a lamb and a
[1:08] figurative type and seeing that Jesus
[1:10] was the lamb slain before the foundation
[1:12] of the world and God testified that's
[1:15] the truth God will always Testify the
[1:18] truth now um this is Sunday school class
[1:21] you know it gives us an opportunity kind
[1:23] of kind of move back a little bit and
[1:25] just kind of cover some things um you
[1:27] know like serpent seed that the serpent
[1:30] seed doctor what what was Abel's
[1:31] Revelation why did he bring a lamb and
[1:34] so as we dive into this um I I I think
[1:37] Sunday school kind of gives us an
[1:38] opportunity to kind of kind of dive into
[1:40] this a little bit more and some of these
[1:42] slides um uh a few of them you know this
[1:45] is a a sensitive topic you want to deal
[1:47] with it with discretion and so forth but
[1:49] some of these are a little bit
[1:50] heavy-handed so I would give you a
[1:51] warning before I move to the next one
[1:54] this is about as heavy-handed as I'll
[1:56] get see brother R said in Fellowship he
[1:59] says there's an ele of Life In The Blood
[2:02] life is in the blood cell life comes
[2:05] from the male sex and that's where
[2:06] brother Brown that last quote that he
[2:08] corrected what he was saying from the
[2:10] male life comes from the male not from
[2:12] the woman the woman can produce life cuz
[2:15] she's the egg but she produces the egg
[2:18] but the male produces the germ The Germ
[2:21] of Life comes from the male because it's
[2:23] in the blood cell and in that blood cell
[2:26] lays life so now now that's what we're
[2:29] talking about this morning life you want
[2:31] to get life you got to you got to be
[2:33] with the male and in the blood cell in
[2:35] the state in the place of Jesus was not
[2:38] the sexual Affair of a man but the
[2:41] creative power of God so now he's
[2:43] talking about why you ever think U and
[2:46] maybe just say that the the reason
[2:50] there's a reason why Jesus had to come
[2:52] from a virgin birth it would had to be
[2:55] born from a virgin birth to be the
[2:56] antidote before they fall what happened
[2:58] in the Garden of Eden
[3:01] was not was not by the sexual Affair of
[3:03] a man but the creative power of God it
[3:06] created a blood cell in the womb of Mary
[3:08] with that egg that brought forth the Son
[3:10] of God which was the tabernacle that God
[3:12] lived in himself and so that's that's
[3:14] the stage for what we're studying on in
[3:16] verse four so let's just pray before we
[3:18] get into our little study and ask the
[3:21] Lord to bless it this morning Lord God
[3:22] we're so grateful to be able to gather
[3:24] together around your word this morning
[3:25] and we just ask your blessings Lord as
[3:27] we study these things out you Quicken
[3:29] them to us Lord that it won't just be
[3:31] won't just be like the just the word uh
[3:33] that's not been quickened but we need we
[3:36] need you to come and Quicken the word to
[3:38] us to make it aive because without you
[3:41] it won't be aive but Lord if you come
[3:43] and give life to it then it'll spring
[3:46] forth into a living reality to us Lord
[3:48] that will live in US Lord we ask Lord
[3:51] that you'll just Quicken the word to us
[3:53] today Lord to be with brother Wade as
[3:54] he's prepared and studying Lord and that
[3:56] you'll set our mind in order Lord so
[3:58] that we can be prepared to receive Lord
[4:00] Jesus Grant it Lord we ask it in your
[4:03] name amen so in verse four it says by
[4:07] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[4:09] excellent sacrifice than Cain and you
[4:11] see how faith faith faith is the only
[4:13] way you can please God and by faith
[4:15] faith Abel had a revelation that went
[4:18] beyond just the teaching the education
[4:20] and the theology that maybe his mother
[4:22] and father had given him and of course
[4:25] they both came with a desire to to
[4:27] present their sacrifice the the way that
[4:29] they thought the approach should be but
[4:31] Abel had a revelation that's how he
[4:34] obtained he had obtained witness that he
[4:37] was righteous God testifying of his
[4:40] gifts and by it being dead yet speaketh
[4:43] by by it he being dead yet yet speaketh
[4:46] so God came on the scene and proved that
[4:50] Abel's Revelation was correct by
[4:52] accepting his sacrifice now if we look
[4:54] in some of these quotes brother R said
[4:56] in questions and answers law having a
[4:58] shadow he said just to just to paint
[5:00] that picture of what happened he said
[5:01] there stood Adam and Eve Eve a beautiful
[5:04] woman I can see there Adam with them
[5:08] dark Shaggy locks hanging around his
[5:10] head those bright flashy eyes look over
[5:13] to his little sweetheart Eve and such a
[5:16] perfect built woman and her hair looked
[5:18] up and her eyes as blue as the sky Adam
[5:21] loved her oh how he loved her but when
[5:23] sin entered in their little home was
[5:26] broke up because of an old lustful Beast
[5:29] the devil had got into an animal called
[5:31] The Serpent not a reptile remember the
[5:33] Bible doesn't say that the devil was a
[5:34] snake that's right he wasn't a snake in
[5:37] the beginning the snake wasn't like he
[5:40] is now in the beginning the curse put
[5:41] him where he's at the Bible said he was
[5:44] not a reptile he was a beast and the
[5:46] most subtle of all the beasts of the
[5:48] field he looked more like a man than
[5:50] anything you've ever had walked upright
[5:53] there's where the devil got in him and
[5:55] come to Eve this beautiful maid woman
[5:58] and she did what was was wrong now you
[6:01] look at what s subtle means that that's
[6:03] kind of a weird we we don't have when we
[6:05] read a book today we don't have any
[6:08] any it's very seldom where You' see a
[6:10] word spelled like that s u b t i l sub
[6:14] brother R said in the what that means is
[6:16] he said the serpent is that missing
[6:17] person between the chimpanzee and the
[6:19] man and he said he went and got
[6:21] dictionaries today from everywhere to
[6:22] look up this word what the word subtle
[6:24] meant it means to be smart to be crafty
[6:28] and so you look online and see what what
[6:30] that word subtil means it means it's
[6:32] it's really just an archaic spelling of
[6:34] subtle and it's no longer used in any
[6:36] variety of English though it's a modern
[6:38] word in French and German but what it
[6:40] means is mean to be real clever cleverly
[6:42] using indirect methods to achieve
[6:44] something somebody that's sneaky now you
[6:47] think about the beast in the garden
[6:48] being being sneaky enough to just kind
[6:50] of twist the words a little bit and you
[6:52] see you bring it over in the present day
[6:54] that's what the devil will do today is
[6:56] just twist it just enough to where you
[6:58] think well the the promise isn't for me
[7:01] I can't get my healing Twisted enough to
[7:03] where you don't understand how to be
[7:05] born again well as long as you as long
[7:07] as you just feel something you got it
[7:09] just twist it enough and then that keeps
[7:10] the promise from being fulfilled just
[7:13] just change it just enough so there uh
[7:15] now so so brother around he's explaining
[7:19] what what that Beast the serpent is the
[7:21] missing person between the chimpanzee
[7:23] and the man so let's let's just look at
[7:25] that for a second now what that means is
[7:28] uh you know Darwin started when he he
[7:30] wrote that his book the origin of the
[7:32] species after he went to the Galapagos
[7:34] Islands he he went out there and he saw
[7:36] um you can see on the cover of the book
[7:38] is all of these these finches that he
[7:40] saw on on the on the Galapagos Islands
[7:43] and you can see each of these
[7:45] finches um Darwin Darwin believed that
[7:48] they came from a a fch and uh they were
[7:50] a com had a common ancestor in South
[7:52] America that they all came from this
[7:54] descended from this one fch but they
[7:56] they they slowly began to develop these
[7:58] different characteristics ICS one fch on
[8:01] one Island had to had to uh get little
[8:04] bugs and stuff so it would it learned
[8:06] how to use little a little stick to get
[8:08] bugs and another would eat a certain
[8:10] kind of fruit where it needed a long
[8:11] beak so they started they started
[8:13] developing these little small
[8:14] characteristics you can see the pictures
[8:15] where some of them have big beaks and
[8:17] some have small beaks some have long
[8:19] beaks some have short be beaks so they
[8:22] all developed these little
[8:23] characteristics so Darwin got into his
[8:25] idea he could see where where you know
[8:27] things began it looked like things were
[8:28] evolved from a common ancestor coming
[8:31] from a common ancestor so he began to
[8:33] think you know I can I can see something
[8:35] happening but there's got to be so
[8:38] surely that happened with with uh we
[8:41] where we came from so he's looking for
[8:43] this transition what you can look at
[8:44] monkeys and see see things moving along
[8:47] surely there had to be where where is
[8:48] the link between a gorilla or whatever
[8:51] it would be a a chimpanzee or something
[8:53] and human there's got to be some a
[8:55] transition so that's the The Missing
[8:57] Link what's that transition Dar Darwin
[9:00] was looking for a transition and
[9:02] scientists have been looking for that
[9:03] transition because it you know you if if
[9:05] if if that kind of evolution were true
[9:07] and I want to pause just for a second
[9:09] now we believe we do believe that God
[9:12] went through a stage of Creative
[9:13] Evolution where he started from
[9:16] something simple and began to work up
[9:18] and something until he finally he
[9:19] achieved his Grand purpose to manifest
[9:21] himself in Adam and Eve in Harmony in
[9:24] the garden so we do believe in evolution
[9:26] in that sense where God is behind it God
[9:29] is the one that's orchestrating it but
[9:31] not just some halfhazard thing where
[9:33] like you look on the wall and you can
[9:35] see a clock there or you look in your in
[9:36] your on the desk and you see a book
[9:38] there and you just think well uh you
[9:40] think nobody made that book nobody made
[9:43] that clock now you look at a clock on
[9:45] the wall and you know that somebody made
[9:46] the gears you know that there had to be
[9:48] a grand designer behind it somebody to
[9:51] be able to have to have the knowledge to
[9:52] be able to put that together and make
[9:54] the make the all the things that go into
[9:56] it but see God is the one that's been
[9:59] behind it all the time so so see see
[10:02] brother Brandon by Revelation is is
[10:04] revealing to us who what where where the
[10:07] where the transition was between between
[10:09] like a monkey or whatever or whatever
[10:11] the lower form was to to get up to where
[10:13] the to the man and so in the serpent
[10:16] seat he said you can cross animals they
[10:18] keep getting higher blood higher blood
[10:20] higher form of life higher form till it
[10:22] climbs up into the man realm but the
[10:24] last connection here between here was
[10:26] cut off how many knows that science
[10:28] can't find The Missing Link all you know
[10:31] that why here he is here he is the
[10:33] serpent the missing link that transition
[10:36] now he said it now let's watch this just
[10:38] a minute he's smart smart and crafty
[10:42] smart and sneaky smart crafty enough to
[10:44] be able to have a conversation with
[10:46] somebody and twist things around to get
[10:47] to accomplish a goal accomplish a person
[10:50] that's the kind of person that this
[10:51] Beast was yet he's called The Serpent
[10:54] but remember he was the smartest thing
[10:57] there was and the more like the human
[10:59] human being than anything else there was
[11:00] on the field amen closest to a human
[11:03] being he was not a reptile the curse
[11:05] made him a reptile the Bible said he was
[11:08] the most beautiful of all and even the
[11:10] curse didn't take all of his Beauty away
[11:12] yet the Glorious colors of the snake is
[11:14] beautiful and his grace and his
[11:16] shrewdness even the curse didn't move it
[11:19] off but you remember God told him that
[11:21] his legs would come off and he'd go on
[11:23] his belly and you can't find one bone
[11:26] and a snake that looks like a human
[11:27] being and that's the reason science is
[11:29] lost but there he is so God took that
[11:32] transition and hid it so that science
[11:35] can't find it but you can see where it
[11:37] is by Revelation and even even you know
[11:39] you just look you just look everywhere
[11:41] in the world and the snake is a symbol
[11:43] of that that deception that happened in
[11:45] the garden it's a a symbol of of well
[11:50] I'm trying to be speak with discretion
[11:52] but y'all know what I'm talking about
[11:54] y'all it's a symbol it's a it represents
[11:58] what what happen happened the and the
[12:00] spoken word is the Original Seed he said
[12:02] now look Eve what did she do she
[12:04] received the wrong seed how did she do
[12:07] it now now here's something to meditate
[12:09] on how did she do it believing Satan's
[12:13] lie now as we as we Trace these things
[12:16] out we'll find out that brother bram's
[12:17] talking about two things at the same
[12:19] time cuz you got two wombs or a woman
[12:23] has two wombs a woman's got two wombs a
[12:25] womb in her mind where she first got to
[12:27] think about it think about it and
[12:29] receive it and then then the womb in her
[12:32] belly so first she received it at the
[12:34] wrong seed in her mind she started
[12:36] believing it wrong she believed that she
[12:38] accepted Satan's lie how many says
[12:40] that's right and the congregation said
[12:42] amen well sure it's right sure she
[12:44] received Satan's lifee what' she bring
[12:47] forth by doing it Satan said you know
[12:50] this is glorious this is a wonderful
[12:53] thing do you know you were made for that
[12:56] why you were actually made for this
[12:58] purpose oh was I oh it's Pleasant to the
[13:01] eye it's good you should you should try
[13:04] it but the Lord God said not that not
[13:08] yet wait a minute see where where last
[13:11] time we were talking about how that God
[13:13] wants you to just wait and that's our
[13:15] problem so many times we just want to
[13:17] hurry and force it to happen that's the
[13:19] Pentecostal problem is to force it and
[13:22] manufacture before you got Deliverance
[13:24] to try to force it and act like it just
[13:26] hold just wait just wait on it wait a
[13:29] minute but you know oh if we do we oh
[13:32] you surely won't die that slick tongue
[13:35] devil he ain't got Hooves and Fork tail
[13:38] no no they like to try to make you
[13:41] believe he's a Slicker behind the
[13:43] pulpit or some little Ricky with his
[13:45] hair combed down like a
[13:48] duck sitting on his back out there to
[13:50] harm some mother's daughter that's the
[13:52] guy come around with a little cute like
[13:55] little oh I'll let that go oh you can
[13:58] preach on that couldn't you
[14:00] you that's a father's responsibility is
[14:02] watch out for his keep watch over his
[14:04] family so that you know some of these
[14:06] little Slickers come around that uh
[14:08] maybe a little girl would be susceptible
[14:10] to the father's got to put that
[14:13] protective around anyway I'm I'm not
[14:15] here to preach we're just
[14:17] teaching now the womb Eve receives the
[14:20] wrong seed word she received the wrong
[14:24] words so it all always starts out in the
[14:26] womb of your mind that's where it starts
[14:28] out first now listen real close now
[14:30] we're going to drive this right down if
[14:31] the Lord willing she received the wrong
[14:34] word what did it do it was Satan's lie
[14:38] said she would be wise and the God of
[14:42] this evil age brother R said oh you see
[14:43] we bring it over to the present day
[14:45] because a lot of times you read these
[14:46] you start studying these things how is
[14:48] it going to help me right now to know
[14:50] this historical uh thing or
[14:52] whatever if if we can begin to discern
[14:56] the to recognize the devil in his tactic
[14:59] to see when the devil's doing something
[15:02] then you'll you'll have overcoming power
[15:04] then to see when the devil begins to
[15:06] move maybe in a congregation or your
[15:07] family or when somebody says something
[15:09] that that's not right and you cast that
[15:11] down and say no I'm sorry that's
[15:13] contrary to God's word and recognize
[15:15] when when the devil's moving and the God
[15:18] of this evil age he said eve never just
[15:20] simply walked out willfully say I don't
[15:23] believe in God she she never just went
[15:25] well today I'm not going to believe I
[15:26] don't believe in God no more see it's
[15:28] more it comes in more subtle than that
[15:30] more simple it was an error she believed
[15:33] it was an error Satan never come out and
[15:36] said oh well that's not even the word of
[15:38] God he admitted it was the word of God
[15:40] but he put his own interpretation to it
[15:43] which God plainly told them not to do it
[15:45] what does this do it makes a strong
[15:48] delusion for the Bible for the people to
[15:50] believe a lie and be damned by it in
[15:52] second Thessalonians
[15:54] 2:11 and brother Bram said in the spoken
[15:56] word of his Original Seed he said that's
[15:58] there's the three now this is a
[16:00] fantastic quote there's the three Adam
[16:04] Christ God the reason that Adam's bride
[16:08] never did beite the life child is
[16:10] because she disbelieved God's
[16:14] word if that's right say amen and
[16:16] everybody says amen the reason that
[16:19] Jehovah's wife was put away or his bride
[16:22] was because she rejected God's word the
[16:25] prophet and the reason that Christ bride
[16:28] he's now he's talking about the
[16:29] Pentecostals they they they hung on for
[16:31] a while but then they they just couldn't
[16:33] go on with the word the reason that
[16:34] Christ bride is put away in divorcement
[16:36] is because that she has rejected the
[16:38] word of God like Eve did like the rest
[16:41] of them all
[16:43] all polluted their husband
[16:47] couldn't get to them now see that there
[16:49] goes back to that second that second
[16:51] slide that I showed you got to be with
[16:54] the
[16:54] man you got to receive from the man cuz
[16:57] that's where the life come comes from
[16:59] they was already pregnated before their
[17:01] husband got to them oh God if that ain't
[17:03] a pitiful sight think of a young man
[17:06] coming to a woman and find her with seed
[17:08] of some other man in her what a thing
[17:10] that's what God has done that's what
[17:12] Adam done that's what Christ has done
[17:15] now now this next slide I want to look
[17:17] we're what we're talking about receiving
[17:18] a lie so you know brother Ram said that
[17:21] that the serpent seed came over the ark
[17:23] let's see what let's examine that quote
[17:25] a little bit he said now Noah and his
[17:27] sons which come out ham sham and japeth
[17:30] come out in the righteous line how did
[17:32] the seed ever get over how did it get
[17:34] over on the ark the seed come over in
[17:37] the ark just like it did in the
[17:38] beginning through the woman their wives
[17:42] they Carri the seed of Satan through the
[17:44] ark just as Eve packed the seed of Satan
[17:46] to give birth to Cain through the woman
[17:48] now this is why it's so important to
[17:50] examine the context of what brother man
[17:52] was saying look at what he's saying
[17:54] before and after look what he says right
[17:56] after he starts talking about preaching
[17:59] he starts talking about telling somebody
[18:01] something that's wrong you put them
[18:03] women in your platforms for preachers
[18:05] the Bible condemning it Paul said If any
[18:08] man thinks himself to be a prophet or
[18:10] even spiritual let him acknowledge that
[18:13] what I write is the Commandments of the
[18:15] Lord but if he be ignorant just let him
[18:17] be
[18:19] ignorant and the serpent seat again he
[18:21] said and I'm just reading reading some
[18:24] reading what brother Brown said he said
[18:26] notice this now and out of there then
[18:28] come ham ham with his wife and he had a
[18:31] curse put on him from ham come Nimrod
[18:33] who built Babylon out of Babylon come
[18:35] the Catholic Church the beginning of it
[18:37] come on down through Ahab Ahab into
[18:40] Judas and in this last day here is the
[18:43] spirit of the Antichrist and the spirit
[18:45] of the Christ what's the spirit of the
[18:46] Antichrist saying the days of Miracles
[18:49] is passed taking something that's true
[18:50] and twisting around so you think well
[18:53] God is not able to heal me any God's not
[18:55] going to heal me anymore he don't want
[18:56] to he the promise itting for me see I
[18:58] just take it and twist it the spirit of
[19:00] Christ saying he's the same yesterday
[19:02] today and forever and the spirit of
[19:04] antichrist said it don't make any
[19:06] difference you see why preachers just
[19:09] hammer on it so many so much that it
[19:11] does make a difference what you believe
[19:14] it matters what you believe it don't as
[19:17] Spirit of antichrist saying it don't
[19:18] make any difference if you're baptized
[19:20] in the father son Holy Ghost poured
[19:22] sprinkled or whatever it is it means the
[19:25] same thing the Bible said that God's
[19:27] infallible and he can't change who you
[19:30] going to serve it's up to
[19:35] you I see all these things what we're
[19:38] talking about is receiving something in
[19:39] the womb of your in in your
[19:42] womb and the spoken word of is original
[19:44] C brother said he said let's go back now
[19:46] and pick up again and come down for
[19:48] something you remember what last Sunday
[19:50] service was the gate to the soul now
[19:53] there is a womb of the physical there's
[19:56] a womb for the spirit
[19:59] did you believe that there is a
[20:01] spiritual womb and a physical womb and
[20:04] the mind is the womb to the spirit now
[20:07] see if you really meditate on this and
[20:10] God reveals it to you then you'll see
[20:12] how to be born again you'll see how to
[20:13] receive any promise of God cuz your the
[20:16] womb is the incubation place you let it
[20:19] you let God's word begin to incubate in
[20:21] your mind and you say I believe it and
[20:23] you hang on to it sooner or later you're
[20:24] going to have a baby born sooner or
[20:27] later there's going going to be a baby
[20:28] crying you're going to be able to come
[20:31] forth but why cuz you you accepted what
[20:33] God's word says and you stayed with it
[20:36] until now see there's a process you got
[20:39] to go through when you're when you're
[20:40] receiving the word of God God will take
[20:42] you through justification sanctification
[20:44] the little twitching muscles muscles
[20:46] twitching baby's not born again but then
[20:48] life comes forth and there you got a
[20:50] little baby and you pop it on the bottom
[20:51] or whatever and it takes that breath and
[20:54] now now you got life and that's how
[20:57] baby's born there's a womb a womb where
[21:00] that baby's being formed that that's
[21:02] what in second Timothy Paul telling
[21:04] Timothy he said consider what I say and
[21:08] the Lord give thee understanding in all
[21:10] things consider what I'm telling you if
[21:12] if we could do that this morning
[21:14] consider the things that it's not just
[21:16] something boring that's going over the
[21:17] pulpit but it's the it's the words of
[21:19] eternal life that if you consider the
[21:21] word of God then something is going to
[21:24] happen in Mark 4:20 he said and J Jesus
[21:29] these These are they which given the
[21:30] parable of the sewer these are they
[21:32] which are sown on good ground good
[21:35] ground somebody that will take God's
[21:37] word and hold it in the womb of their
[21:38] mind hold on to it until it comes forth
[21:41] and you can see it coming up out of the
[21:42] ground not just when it sprouts beneath
[21:44] the ground hang on let it incubate let
[21:47] it let it begin to grow until it comes
[21:49] forth and and and don't put a rock on it
[21:52] and don't let it get choked out by the
[21:53] weeds but hang on to it incubate it in
[21:56] that good ground and then these are they
[21:58] which are sown on good ground such as
[22:00] hear the word and receive it and bring
[22:01] forth fruit some 30-fold some 60 and
[22:04] some 100-fold and Luke chapter 8 now the
[22:07] parable is this the seed is the word of
[22:10] God you receive that seed hang on to it
[22:14] believe it and something's going to
[22:16] happen because it's a womb now brother
[22:18] BR said in the spoken word of the
[22:19] Original Seed he said when the Bride of
[22:21] Jesus Christ let L man-made Creeds and
[22:24] dogmas take the place of the word of God
[22:28] she's committing
[22:29] adultery did not Jesus say whosoever
[22:33] lookth Upon A woman has committed
[22:34] adultery with her already in his heart
[22:37] now now think about this when Jesus said
[22:39] you look on a
[22:41] woman you look on a woman with lust
[22:44] you're committing adultery in your heart
[22:47] why cuz that's the womb you're thinking
[22:50] about it you're thinking about it and
[22:53] something begins to move lookth upon a
[22:56] woman to lust after her heart
[22:58] hath committed adultery with her already
[23:00] he said why she let it come into his
[23:03] mind oh you see that's that's what's
[23:06] taking place when a woman goes out on
[23:08] the street or at the beach or wherever
[23:09] and she's unclothing herself she's
[23:11] trying to get she's trying to change
[23:13] that man's mind that looks at her
[23:15] because that's where it starts in your
[23:17] mind and a man looks on that woman and
[23:19] if he's not a holy ghost filled believer
[23:21] that that knows not to do that then his
[23:24] mind is going to start thinking about
[23:26] that cuz that's where it starts that's
[23:28] where every everything starts in your
[23:30] mind in your mind is where the battle
[23:32] reaches she let it come into his mind
[23:34] and that's that's why it's wrong sisters
[23:36] to dress wrong and to to dress like that
[23:39] cuz you're trying to influence maybe
[23:41] this will go out on the Airways it's
[23:43] it's try you're trying to change what
[23:45] that man is thinking about that's the
[23:47] womb that starts the things moving now
[23:50] see it all goes back we haven't
[23:52] forgotten our our topic that we're
[23:54] talking about why did Abel offer blood
[23:58] because blood it's the life it's the
[23:59] thing that you receive it all goes back
[24:01] to to to to these
[24:04] things the womb is the W the mind is the
[24:07] womb for the spirit to take in or let
[24:10] out and that's how they commit adultery
[24:13] is taken let some Satan devil Spirit put
[24:16] in them something against the word of
[24:18] God then she's committed
[24:20] adultery and brother Ram said in the
[24:22] mark of the beast he said your heart is
[24:24] a womb you know what I'm speaking of
[24:26] women and men your heart is a womb and
[24:28] the womb holds the seed and the seed is
[24:31] the gospel now the seed alone in his
[24:34] heart now now look this this is I know
[24:36] this slide is a little heavy-handed as
[24:38] we as we y'all can grin and everything I
[24:41] see the grins we got two more minutes
[24:43] but listen this is what brother R saying
[24:45] you might have the egg there you might
[24:48] have the teaching where gel taught Paul
[24:50] for year and Jesus taught the disciples
[24:53] for three and 1/2 years the word is
[24:55] there laying but it's got to be it's got
[24:58] to be quickened no matter how many GES
[25:01] you set under no matter how great your
[25:03] pasture is how much you've read the
[25:06] Bible it'll never take life until the
[25:08] germ of life has come to it a woman's
[25:11] seed is a wonderful thing it's the
[25:13] building of a body but it has no life it
[25:15] can't it's impossible it has no life to
[25:18] begin with so now no matter how much you
[25:21] know the Bible and how well it is in
[25:25] your heart you're still a sinner
[25:28] yeah what what are we talking about
[25:29] we're talking about what happened in the
[25:31] garden and what Abel's Revelation was
[25:34] and the mark of the beast and well maybe
[25:35] we'll stop on this slide he said what
[25:37] happens the heart is a womb and Faith
[25:40] cometh by an open ear that's not been
[25:43] sealed by theology Faith cometh by
[25:46] hearing that's what we're talking about
[25:48] in Hebrews 11 Faith to hear the word
[25:52] comes into the mind so if you want Faith
[25:54] this morning as brother Way's preparing
[25:56] to bring the messages this morning and
[25:58] this afternoon faith comes by hearing
[26:01] when you hear the word open up yourself
[26:03] to receive the word and you'll receive
[26:07] fa he said look he's he's giv us the
[26:09] recipe he's saying you make up your mind
[26:11] about it is that right could that be
[26:14] right well the Bible said so I believe
[26:17] it down into the heart it goes then it's
[26:22] a womb when you receive God's word we'll
[26:25] stop right there God bless you amen
[26:30] [Applause]
[26:34] thank you
