[8:07] it looks good we've just thank the Lord
[8:10] for the people giving us that building
[8:12] and things and then we could be able to
[8:15] you know get it all tore out and and
[8:17] make it more usable for us okay remember

[9:02] visions - then we're going back into
[9:05] Romans right father we thank you for
[9:08] this day in your grace and love Lord

[9:12] you to come among us in a mighty way
[9:14] today and let your understanding be with
[9:17] us let your heart Lord come to our
[9:20] hearts to where that we can father
[9:22] receive and understand and open our eyes
[9:25] to that word forgive our sins because we
[9:28] know where we fail you and we just pray
[9:30] that you'd bless each one got it all and
[9:33] remember all of these that are away from
[9:35] us that are seeking all remember each
[9:37] one's our brother Daugherty still having
[9:39] trouble with his eyes and onand we just
[9:42] appreciate you touching some Lord and

[9:50] commit it all to you now in Jesus name
[9:53] Amen
[9:59] visions 2 verse 8 for by grace are you
[10:04] saved through faith and that not of
[10:07] yourself it is the gift of God it's a
[10:10] journey right ok drop back a few verses
[10:13] to verse 3 in the first chapter it says
[10:19] blessed be the God and father of our
[10:21] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[10:23] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[10:24] places in Christ Jesus according as he
[10:28] had chosen us in him before the
[10:30] foundation of the world that we should
[10:32] be holding without blame before him in
[10:35] love having predestinated us unto the
[10:39] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[10:43] himself according to the good pleasure
[10:44] of his will so keep these scriptures now
[10:49] we'll go to Roman's that'll be picking
[10:52] up a main part of our thought I guess
[10:54] from Romans 8 as many as are led by the
[11:00] Spirit of God they are the sons of God
[11:02] for you have not received the spirit of
[11:04] bondage again to fear which you've
[11:06] received the spirit of adoption what
[11:08] about you cry
[11:09] father the spirit itself beareth witness
[11:13] with our spirit that we are their
[11:15] children of God
[11:16] any children then heirs heirs of God and
[11:20] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[11:23] suffer with him that we may be also
[11:26] glorified together you may be seated the
[11:29] Lord at his blessing to the reading of
[11:32] the word but have a sister there brother
[11:44] sister Rachel's sister-in-law I can
[11:48] never remember nine so don't worry about
[11:50] that
[11:50] she knows who she is but glad I've heard
[11:54] children with us today then now we've
[12:00] been trying for a while to get into our
[12:04] thought of the new birth and I want you
[12:11] to see from the word cause see that away
[12:17] then if I can follow it through the word
[12:18] you can follow it through the word then
[12:20] you can read it for yourself and
[12:23] understand and get into the right
[12:26] channel of everything
[12:27] see we were all born in sin shapen in
[12:31] iniquity come came into the world lost
[12:34] it doesn't matter who we are everybody
[12:37] was born done away except Adam Adam was
[12:41] created
[12:42] he was created everything since then has
[12:45] come by the fact of you know being
[12:49] brought into the world by natural birth
[12:53] that brought us as human beings and and
[12:57] put us in to the to a world of sin all
[13:01] right and put us into Satan's domain
[13:05] that we were not to have been we were to
[13:07] vent into the domain of God and it would
[13:10] have been wonderful that had it stayed
[13:11] like the Garden of Eden and everything
[13:13] you know whatever he wanted to do to
[13:15] bring us into being that's up to him but
[13:19] to the basis of you know us our sale
[13:23] and knowing that we come lawston and
[13:26] where we're searching for the redemption
[13:29] and he made away he came himself to give
[13:33] us you know his own life and that that
[13:37] would make us come out to be then the
[13:39] children of God because that was his
[13:41] original plan was to have children you
[13:46] know that was original plan that was
[13:49] that was what he wanted but he didn't
[13:51] want it with the sin involved uh-huh
[13:55] but then he still had attributes within
[13:58] him that was needing to be displayed so
[14:01] in the display of that he permitted
[14:03] different things and to bring it into
[14:06] being that we would all wind up being
[14:08] lost and needing a savior okay but we by
[14:13] that we could receive then eternal life
[14:17] and come back to the original plan and
[14:20] purpose of God but it would take all of
[14:23] the time coming down that it took four
[14:26] thousand years for Jesus Christ to come
[14:28] into being to where he could give his
[14:30] life you know so God's not even no big
[14:34] Harry
[14:34] we're the ones has the problems with
[14:37] that and are the disciples for three and
[14:39] a half years were tutored and trained of
[14:42] the Lord Jesus before the Holy Ghost
[14:44] fell upon them on the day of Pentecost
[14:47] making them then the offspring of God so
[14:50] we were thank God that we understand the
[14:53] plan of redemption and bringing it into
[14:57] view and to see what it is and to thank
[15:00] God for the truth of knowing what it is
[15:03] instead of just going along with what
[15:05] ideas of man you know people say well
[15:08] what is the nubert well it was accepted
[15:10] Jesus Christ
[15:12] that's part of the plan
[15:14] alright that's part of the plan but
[15:18] that's not all of it all right see
[15:21] there's more to it that has he accepted
[15:23] us okay and see well then you look at
[15:27] the religious world so you you may think
[15:29] that I'm so well dogmatic of stand upon
[15:33] things but do you realize
[15:36] and it just dawned on you to think a
[15:38] little bit about it of me trying to stir
[15:40] you up that the whole religious the
[15:44] basics of all the religious world is on
[15:51] the basis of just ideas and thoughts of
[15:55] salvation
[15:58] where are they that teach the new birth
[16:03] the new birth to them is just believing
[16:05] on Jesus Christ what I accepted him as
[16:08] my savior enough so I'm saved you know
[16:12] well that's not all the story all right
[16:17] that that's not the whole story we need
[16:20] to understand more about redemption than
[16:24] to just think about it as well
[16:26] well I just believe well the devil
[16:31] believes so is he saved
[16:33] no it's an onus of well that's all right
[16:37] then you know I'm not D Christianizing
[16:40] the world I'm just telling it like it is
[16:42] the word is what does the D
[16:45] Christianizing alright according to the
[16:48] word you must be born again
[16:52] that was Jesus's first message right all
[16:57] right so then being his first message
[16:59] that ties together the entire being of
[17:01] what he is I said come 4,000 years to
[17:04] get into being and and coming to that
[17:07] place of her that things could happen to
[17:11] bring you in I a new birth because if
[17:16] we're not born again see we're still
[17:17] lost you say well then what else can we
[17:21] do I'm not saying that's the hope you
[17:24] get the point I'm not saying the world
[17:26] is lost or the religious rent that's
[17:30] between them and God that ain't none of
[17:32] your bidness to mine neither one you
[17:34] know it's not for us to try to convert
[17:38] the world we do the best we can with
[17:40] what we can and the things that we are
[17:43] to try to minister the word to help
[17:45] people right but still if you
[17:50] let's think about what I'm saying if you
[17:52] went were over here to see what the new
[17:54] birth is and they tell you well it's
[17:56] this and you over here and they say well
[17:58] that's this go over here and they say
[17:59] well that's the N over here in a sense
[18:01] there well then which one is right
[18:05] do we need to get with the one that's
[18:07] right it doesn't matter which way it
[18:09] goes or how to find the truth of it okay
[18:12] see now god didn't have to send us a
[18:16] prophet to bring the new birth back into
[18:20] being right we were hitting that a
[18:24] little Wednesday on God didn't have to
[18:27] send a prophet to bring us the
[18:31] understanding of the new birth it was in
[18:34] the Bible well yet we had twisted it so
[18:38] much to straighten out that yes sure to
[18:43] straighten out the new birth yes
[18:45] we needed the Prophet in his message but
[18:49] do you understand what I'm saying they
[18:50] were already preaching the new birth
[18:52] before the Prophet ever came into being
[18:55] and people were already being warned
[18:58] again because God was winking at the
[19:01] ignorance as the scripture would say and
[19:03] you know not counting things and
[19:06] bypassing all of it waiting till the
[19:09] time that he could bring the word but
[19:13] see then now we say well what is the new
[19:15] birth well I shouted I cried I spoke in
[19:18] tongue that's exactly what the organized
[19:21] religion has always taught those forms
[19:23] of some thing that happens as being the
[19:28] new birth but is that the new birth or
[19:32] is that like a baby you got to go to the
[19:36] to the baby to see the new birth right
[19:39] the natural birth is the top of the
[19:41] spiritual birth so what's the natural
[19:43] burden water blood life drop off one of
[19:48] them it doesn't work all right see then
[19:51] the baby comes into being and you know
[19:55] you spank it and it screams out in
[19:57] receiving life all right
[20:00] and as it does that then it cries
[20:03] it Wiggles it moves it does all kind of
[20:06] things
[20:07] what because those are the attributes of
[20:10] the fact see that's not the birth the
[20:13] birth is took place the birthing is not
[20:16] the the baby as it cries out the the
[20:21] birth is the the life that comes in that
[20:24] causes the baby in the natural to cry
[20:27] all right see then in the spiritual
[20:30] birth I'm saying this for a purpose in
[20:34] the spiritual birth we know that it's
[20:38] justification sanctification the baptism
[20:41] with the Holy Ghost
[20:43] then we shout and cry the birth you got
[20:51] to get the baby here then you can talk
[20:56] about gifts and operations and things
[20:59] like that but that birth is the birth of
[21:02] life coming into the child and the
[21:05] natural which is the life of Christ
[21:07] coming into the spiritual creating a new
[21:11] birth all right see then we come into
[21:14] the message and we begin to get deeper
[21:16] into understanding of the things and
[21:19] here comes a prophet to explain it and
[21:22] telling us that new birth will we ought
[21:24] to listen to what he has to say you know
[21:30] listen to what he says about it because
[21:33] if we're going to believe in to be a
[21:34] prophet
[21:35] all right What did he say he said the
[21:37] new birth is a revelation of Jesus
[21:39] Christ personally to you well do you
[21:46] understand what he's saying Richard now
[21:50] we're talking about this yesterday going
[21:51] with on land and back do you understand
[21:54] what it means to say that the new birth
[21:57] is the birth of the word you know
[22:04] is the natural birth a seed planted
[22:08] comes forth produces a child what is the
[22:12] spiritual birth the word made alive into
[22:18] your heart all right now if that's true
[22:22] then do you understand what I'm saying
[22:24] or what I said for over and over about
[22:26] it that the profits that Christ the
[22:28] mystery of God revealed that didn't what
[22:30] is the new birth murder run and he said
[22:32] just a revelation of Jesus Christ
[22:33] personally to you well brother Dale I
[22:35] don't remember getting a revelation see
[22:41] I've tried my best to explain that to
[22:44] where you wouldn't go into those realms
[22:46] of thinking you know well did I get when
[22:51] I got born again did I get to Revelation
[22:53] to one God then I get to Revelation the
[22:55] water baptism did I get a revelation one
[22:57] see that that can't be it's our
[23:04] understanding of something instead of
[23:06] those points like that so what if I
[23:09] tried to express to you what is that new
[23:11] birth the revelation of Jesus Christ
[23:15] all right now the 3,000 that were saved
[23:19] on the day of Pentecost outside they
[23:23] heard a message right Peter preached a
[23:26] message and the Holy Ghost failed at the
[23:29] house of kunia Peter then brought a
[23:34] message and all the ghosts fail now some
[23:37] of like canoeist everyone they already
[23:39] knew some things but does to me is the
[23:44] to see the birth and what is the birth
[23:46] on the dead Pentecost some of those
[23:48] people maybe that that was the first
[23:51] time they had heard anything about the
[23:54] Lord Jesus Christ
[24:00] let me get this off of my heart or that
[24:02] you can understand what is that birth of
[24:05] the word it's the word made alive well
[24:09] what happened with that 3000 what
[24:15] happened at the house Oakland he is what
[24:17] happens to all of us you've got to hear
[24:20] the word before you can be born again
[24:23] true you're not born again just by
[24:27] setting somewhere and something happened
[24:29] the light comes down and all the time no
[24:31] faith cometh by hearing all right the
[24:41] faith comes by hearing you know all
[24:45] right now if it comes by hearing then
[24:49] the seeds got to be planted into the
[24:52] individual before it could be made alive
[24:55] and that's what I've tried to emphasize
[24:58] what the Prophet is saying when he says
[25:00] that it's a revelation of Jesus crying
[25:06] now like I said you realize on the Deaf
[25:09] pinnacles those people maybe a lot of
[25:11] them had never heard do you realise what
[25:18] it takes to bring a new birth suppose
[25:26] you today would leave and go to any
[25:29] place in the country that had never
[25:33] heard about Jesus Christ or anything
[25:35] like that or Christians or how do you
[25:38] think you could get them people saved
[25:48] well God just drop
[25:50] I know this concept don't know it
[25:51] doesn't work how is it that people come
[25:59] to salvation what brought you to
[26:07] salvation I see you heard the word
[26:17] somebody mama daddy whoever it don't
[26:20] have to be a preacher then you can hear
[26:22] the word from anywhere you pick up a
[26:26] Bible and read it we still remember
[26:29] whatever you do even if you're reading
[26:31] the Bible that was written by one some
[26:34] man and that's God speaking to you from
[26:38] that word according to the Bible that we
[26:44] went over and over it says there in
[26:46] lakhs that they were when that when
[26:48] Peter spoke a great dynamic message of
[26:52] explaining the Lord Jesus Christ right
[26:55] that's where I ask you to go back and
[26:57] read these things but do you did you go
[27:00] back to acts one and read and see in
[27:04] acts two Peter preaches a sermon to them
[27:09] about this Messiah about this Christ and
[27:17] they become pricked in their heart
[27:23] right and they said men and brethren
[27:26] what must we do to be saved Peter said
[27:28] repent everyone be baptized in the name
[27:30] of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin
[27:32] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[27:33] Ghost for the promise alright so what
[27:39] did they do what happened what would
[27:42] happen if you went to an island a place
[27:44] to her that no one had ever heard
[27:47] anything about Christianity how would
[27:50] you think about getting those people
[27:53] saved okay are you listening
[28:01] all right now I'm trying to make an
[28:03] illustration uh-huh I'm trying to say
[28:06] what if you went and done that what
[28:07] would you do well I get them telling me
[28:13] need to be saved they don't know what
[28:18] saved it well I just preach to them what
[28:25] would you preach to them
[28:26] I preach them they need to be saved they
[28:32] know nothing about it
[28:35] but it wouldn't be no great revelation
[28:38] of when I come over here to bring you
[28:39] the seals that's not what it is so you
[28:49] would have to first get those people to
[28:53] realize that they were lost and bring
[28:58] them the message of the Lord Jesus
[29:01] Christ coming in to earth to die for us
[29:06] right and what you got them to listen
[29:12] for a minute about that this plan of
[29:14] salvation this this religion you've got
[29:16] it's based on the death of Jesus Christ
[29:20] and how that Jesus Christ has come and
[29:24] died he done he say that's exactly what
[29:27] Peter darling he preached them a sermon
[29:29] about the Lord Jesus Christ and then God
[29:36] convicted him you see why it's so
[29:41] important what you preach it's so
[29:45] important about the truth sure God has
[29:49] to wink at her ignorance all the time
[29:50] but what about the you going out and
[29:54] trying to get somebody saved and telling
[29:55] them that's three God's you need to do
[30:00] this you need to do that now that's
[30:01] religion that ain't salvation Peter got
[30:05] up before a group of people that had
[30:08] never heard and he preached them a
[30:11] sermon about the coming of the
[30:14] seiyya that he had experienced in his
[30:19] 3.5 years of seeing who this man is and
[30:23] he told him about the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:29] then God could come down and burden
[30:33] their heart they become pricked in their
[30:38] heart and they say what can we do said
[30:41] alright now here's what you do
[30:43] you go get baptized and you follow the
[30:46] Lord and receive the Holy Ghost and the
[30:50] Holy Ghost fell on them that had been
[30:54] heard that one message if you understand
[30:57] what I've always tried to drive I
[30:59] believe it I don't believe you could be
[31:01] born again just by setting out in the
[31:04] woods and thinking about something will
[31:06] you know and you never heard about the
[31:09] Lord Jesus you understand what I'm
[31:13] saying you never heard about the Lord or
[31:16] anything but what is so amazing to me is
[31:19] that even the human being the way the
[31:22] human being is made he's made to worship
[31:25] and by doing that he'll worship the Sun
[31:28] the animals the moon the stars and the
[31:31] things right he'll worship them things
[31:34] because he was made to worship something
[31:39] we see we were made to worship the Lord
[31:43] Jesus Christ our God Himself are you
[31:47] listening to what is a new birth it's a
[31:50] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[31:52] you it's not two seals you know it's not
[32:01] these things it's not a message of those
[32:04] type of things so that's what people
[32:07] think it is they think well boy I'll
[32:09] take this message and that's what
[32:11] they're making mass confusion they're
[32:13] going of our preaching you know they're
[32:15] taking it to the lands and preaching
[32:17] about this or that even though some of
[32:19] their parts are true but they're not
[32:23] bringing a conviction upon the people
[32:25] because God has to bring that
[32:28] but you got to get them to realize
[32:30] they're lost and that God came to save
[32:35] them that's what I'm telling you the new
[32:38] birth is the new birth is when you have
[32:43] heard the word it's been brought to you
[32:48] by somebody
[32:49] are you ready to whatever you know
[32:52] that's still somebody you had to come
[32:55] that away the word you could receive it
[32:57] and God can use that that is brought
[33:00] then to quicken your heart you're
[33:06] listening to what I'm talking about what
[33:08] was the new birth to the 3,000 it
[33:13] doesn't mention like it does of the
[33:18] Upper Room experience but when the fire
[33:22] came down to different time and doesn't
[33:24] mention that in the 3000
[33:25] it just says as many as believe we were
[33:28] added under the church that day all
[33:32] right
[33:33] and it brought those people a new birth
[33:38] what was quickened to them that Jesus
[33:43] was Almighty God and what he had come to
[33:48] do it was a simple message at Peter pre
[33:52] read it learn the book of Acts he was
[33:56] simply explaining what God had done to
[34:00] come down to live in mankind and bring
[34:04] it forth
[34:05] it was a great mystery of this of the
[34:08] seals of the play we need to know right
[34:10] we need to know these things but we need
[34:12] a new birth then we get our growth
[34:19] development into those things that's
[34:21] what I'm trying to lay a little platform
[34:24] for didn't those things coming into
[34:29] being run around I'll never come out on
[34:32] Ohio River and said I won't you know
[34:35] what the first sale is and then that
[34:37] first event in second sales if there's
[34:39] it
[34:41] he preached for 30-something years and
[34:48] says it on the statue of a perfect man
[34:49] before he could bring that message of
[34:52] the stature of a perfect man that's why
[34:54] I've asked you to listen to it or to
[34:57] read it and take close attention to what
[35:00] he's doing it took him 30 years he said
[35:12] growth development goes on into the
[35:15] child coming on up it's in the the
[35:17] journey that we've been talking about
[35:20] right but you see what is now the birth
[35:26] of the word it's when the people heard
[35:28] the message of the Lord Jesus Christ now
[35:33] a lot of them didn't know who Jesus
[35:35] Christ was right but when the Peter
[35:40] explained that he was Almighty God and
[35:44] that he had walked among them then they
[35:47] begin to remember maybe that they'd
[35:48] heard of him they begin to think about
[35:54] what they had heard from somebody else
[35:55] or some of the Apostles had talked to
[35:58] them they begin to realize that Jesus
[36:02] Christ was Almighty God as Peter didn't
[36:06] get up pray I won't preach your Trinity
[36:08] now today they three of them you got to
[36:10] be laid it down that's what I've asked
[36:12] you to do just raid lingo town boy you
[36:17] got time for everything you know so go
[36:19] ahead but radar to see how simple then
[36:25] he laid down a message explaining who
[36:31] Jesus Christ was and he said this one
[36:36] that you've crucified right he told him
[36:43] said you crucified this one year he
[36:47] brought Jesus Christ out in the open to
[36:50] the people and then God could use that
[36:52] to condemn them in their heart and when
[36:55] they accepted the fact that he had died
[36:57] for them the oligos came right then they
[37:05] receive the new birth not a revelation
[37:07] of the seals the plagues of Allah it's
[37:10] not a revelation that way the revelation
[37:13] was the fact of what he had they had
[37:15] heard and the our sermon that they were
[37:17] listening to one of the days
[37:23] realize why your profit makes a
[37:25] statement he said you're sitting in your
[37:28] aisle he said you get up and start this
[37:31] way said you need salvation who need
[37:33] even he said what was solved when you
[37:35] still don't started this way right he
[37:41] was healed when you got up started this
[37:43] way you were saved when you got up
[37:44] started this way why because he's
[37:46] something that was taking place
[37:48] something had been made known to you in
[37:51] your mind or would call it brain mister
[37:55] you need to be healed you need to come
[37:57] up be prayed for these in the new birth
[38:04] is the birth of the word the word that
[38:06] they heard the hour or so sermon that
[38:11] they heard was made alive to them what
[38:18] always been alive that Jesus was
[38:21] Almighty God there's a new birth when
[38:28] it's revealed to you that he was God not
[38:33] just because you read it or studied it
[38:35] or climate or the Prophet said it it's
[38:37] when it's revealed to you that he's God
[38:41] they wouldn't made known to you that was
[38:44] Almighty God they then he came quicken
[38:49] it now that's what I've tried to explain
[38:52] I believe what's your property's telling
[38:54] because what else you gonna make it but
[38:57] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ what
[39:02] was made alive to the three thousand a
[39:04] revelation of Jesus Christ
[39:09] right see then the birth was the birth
[39:13] of the word they heard what they heard
[39:19] was made alive into their hearts
[39:27] and see that was the birth the holy
[39:34] ghost come down and quicken what they
[39:37] had heard darkest of Earth it's the
[39:41] birth of the word that's what I've
[39:42] always preached to you I'm always
[39:46] preaching down what comes is what I
[39:47] believe the birth is a verse of the word
[39:50] and the natural baby of the birth is a
[39:53] birth of the seed that was planted and a
[39:58] spiritual child it's the seed that was
[40:00] planted of the Word of God that you
[40:01] heard like I said what would you do if
[40:07] you were scheduled to go to some Island
[40:10] someplace and nobody there knew anything
[40:15] about salvation you go to how to first
[40:23] get them to a point that they realize
[40:26] that they're lost and you can't do it by
[40:31] trying to explain the goodnesses of
[40:33] things to it but if you can explain
[40:38] Jesus Christ God can come down and
[40:44] quicken that you know that's the
[40:49] foundational for what I'm trying to cite
[40:51] them cause you see Adam and Eve were
[40:58] created from their own dime
[41:01] it has to be a natural birth to bring in
[41:05] natural people right okay are you with
[41:11] me so I'm trying to preach a sermon
[41:13] about what Jesus Christ done God came
[41:17] into life himself to where he could die
[41:22] to release his life to where it could
[41:25] come and live in us and see then it's so
[41:32] vital how you preach it to people so you
[41:36] say come up to the altar and shake her
[41:38] hand or go
[41:39] quota queried or telling and you're
[41:40] saved now they ain't no such thing in
[41:42] the Bible there's no such thing in the
[41:51] Word of God if Jesus was explaining to
[41:57] Nicodemus in his first sermon that he
[42:00] preached that he must be born again
[42:03] and he told him how right old Nicodemus
[42:10] like us so you mean I always go back to
[42:12] my mother nothing he said no no no I'm
[42:14] trying to tell you that Jesus Christ
[42:18] this one has come and died in your place
[42:21] and you need to be saved
[42:24] it's the preaching about Jesus that
[42:27] people get saved from not preaching them
[42:29] creeds and ideas that only makes another
[42:34] church or another Creed you or another
[42:36] cult hmm
[42:39] I bread around and see it I don't
[42:42] believe we're getting people to Jesus
[42:43] Christ no see we're getting them to her
[42:50] own ideas and thoughts or something no
[42:55] see Wednesday night then our point was
[42:58] what we were talking about in the
[43:02] simplicity of it of the fact of how the
[43:06] Bible tells us what we are when you're
[43:11] born again all right Adam and Eve was
[43:18] the only ones that was created rest were
[43:21] born okay all right now so everybody
[43:27] come into the world lost everybody come
[43:35] in the world lost everybody is required
[43:38] to new birth if they're going to be in
[43:41] the kingdom of God all right so then if
[43:46] that be true then it would make ever by
[43:49] ever person would be the same
[43:52] birth would be the same and this time of
[43:55] I spent on that the new birth is the
[43:58] same to everybody and for you want to
[44:03] make it something this out of the other
[44:04] that's not the new birth brother Dale
[44:09] these people shouted these people cried
[44:11] these spoken to that ain't got to do
[44:13] with a new birth that's supposed to
[44:15] happen after the birth right that's not
[44:21] the birth that's the baby crying after
[44:25] he gets here see the new birth is the
[44:30] birth of the word well I'll see then you
[44:33] flop back well I never got a revelation
[44:35] I don't understand brother Dale he talks
[44:38] about a revelation you mean we got to
[44:41] get a graph relation to be born again
[44:42] a revelation of Jesus Christ yes and
[44:47] that Jesus Christ was Almighty God yes
[44:55] the once its truth is required
[44:57] God has quit winking at the fact of what
[45:01] we believed prior he went through those
[45:05] days and in hours and kinds of it not
[45:08] being clearly to understand and he
[45:11] winked at it but he doesn't wink at it
[45:13] anymore
[45:14] my will said he called command now all
[45:16] men to repent see I've tried to tell you
[45:21] whatever the new birth is it's got to be
[45:24] the same to ever person and the same in
[45:27] every age and it's been so hard to try
[45:31] to explain because see people Luther
[45:34] them they got there what's that got to
[45:38] do with the birth you know what I just
[45:42] don't understand how Luther could track
[45:45] a beer and set in the pub talk about I
[45:48] don't understand how me and you can do
[45:52] the way we do you want to talk the
[45:55] office doors open don't play with me on
[46:01] stuff like that I don't understand how
[46:03] you and me can be what we are
[46:06] and act the way we act oh we make
[46:15] drinking the beer before I don't
[46:16] understand God winked at ignorance and
[46:23] that's why he had to sin see he done it
[46:25] himself he said John Wesley with a
[46:28] message of sanctification I like the way
[46:30] brother smoke used to try to explain it
[46:32] he said kind of he said if you look at
[46:34] Luther little said you look at him said
[46:36] he's he's over here into the world of
[46:40] sin looks like and you can't hardly see
[46:42] you know but said if you don't look and
[46:44] see that there's a bungee cords hung
[46:47] from here to there that's pulling him
[46:50] and keeping him from going too far you
[46:54] know now that was his way of explain he
[46:58] said now when Wesley come along said he
[47:00] had to hook him and pull him over this
[47:02] away and said naturally when he pulled
[47:05] him over this away said Wesley pulled it
[47:08] a little too far that may not mean a
[47:13] thing to you but it means a lot to me
[47:16] Wesley was pulling that say you know
[47:19] condemning the people for what they were
[47:21] doing and it was right to condemn sin
[47:28] with ours in in his life maybe he was
[47:31] doing just what the other people was
[47:33] doing in another way but you see then
[47:37] the baptism when the Holy Ghost has to
[47:39] hook it and pull it right back into the
[47:42] middle
[47:45] Jerusha Street went off and cabbage down
[47:48] on their doctrines and ideas and when I
[47:50] for all kind of signs and wonders which
[47:53] you know there was some true people
[47:54] though there really to receive Jesus
[47:57] Christ they really had the new birth
[48:03] well brother so-and-so said is it well I
[48:05] don't care what brother so-and-so says
[48:08] brother Branham is when it said it said
[48:12] I met people with a Holy Ghost fifty
[48:14] years before just like the day of
[48:15] Pentecost
[48:20] but you see Church the birth is the same
[48:28] the after-effects is what we look at
[48:30] cried sprout had done this to my brother
[48:33] Dale you took away everything you took
[48:37] away all of my things that I thought all
[48:39] of my life was the sign or thought that
[48:43] I was born again right
[48:53] you base it on looks like some
[48:55] intellectual and that's where I'm
[48:58] against that down through you're wrong
[48:59] you're wrong to think that way
[49:01] it ain't intellectual a new birth ain't
[49:03] no intellect the simplicity of the
[49:08] revelation of Jesus Christ is not
[49:10] intellect it is a revelation that's why
[49:15] I believe it like that you say yeah but
[49:19] all of our life I've depended on the
[49:20] fact that I shouted and that the day I
[49:24] was born again well praise God that's
[49:29] wonderful you shouted with the shout and
[49:33] wouldn't the birth I'm not destroying
[49:39] the shouting I'm destroying the fact of
[49:42] thoughts of what we think about it we
[49:45] think the shouting was what it was
[49:47] no the birth is the birth then the
[49:51] shouting the baby is brought into the
[49:54] world then it cries
[50:02] and we don't allow it I know what that
[50:04] goes through you might want to say it we
[50:07] don't we don't want to accept that
[50:09] everybody is born again the same way now
[50:15] why not well I I just don't understand
[50:22] how that Martin Luther could a drank a
[50:25] beer and set in a pub talk about the
[50:29] gospel
[50:33] listen Church have gotten so far in
[50:35] men's and ideas and things back there
[50:37] until there was no condemnation from
[50:39] anything told from the pulpit that got
[50:44] to the bases too you could just fill out
[50:46] a piece of paper and get a thing a right
[50:50] to go out and kill a man before you ever
[50:52] killed him
[50:58] and here comes Luther out who is there
[51:01] to condemn him to show him these things
[51:03] are wrong well they show no your way
[51:07] over here well I'll tell you what I
[51:14] never did drink I didn't either that
[51:17] don't save me I've tried to explain that
[51:22] and people don't listen to you see you
[51:25] become a religious person and you think
[51:29] your religion is what it is you think
[51:34] because I didn't well then that's what I
[51:36] tried to tell the brothers in the
[51:37] message they kept talking about born
[51:39] with this seat in there I said well they
[51:41] sure must have been in me some way
[51:43] because I surely oh like the devil till
[51:45] I heard the truth and got born again was
[51:50] I saved all that time because I didn't
[51:51] drank didn't smoke didn't you didn't lie
[51:58] No
[52:00] I was in danger of the fact of him
[52:04] thinking I didn't do that but you
[52:11] understand the birth is the same what
[52:16] happens is the attributes of those
[52:19] things everybody has the same identical
[52:23] new birth or they don't have it you
[52:26] can't have a dozen different new birth
[52:29] you got one new birth and it's the birth
[52:35] of the word no matter what age is in its
[52:42] the birth of the word see that each age
[52:50] has a birth and then we were trying to
[52:52] bring that out to other day where bread
[52:53] run said that if people in this age
[52:55] would to be delivered of a new birth
[52:57] from according to Malachi 4 right I
[53:00] believe in that I've taught you that I
[53:02] talked to you that this message has to
[53:04] come to a basis I'm looking for an
[53:06] outpouring from heaven of a great
[53:09] outpouring of the Holy Ghost
[53:11] to take us in the rapture right I've
[53:14] always talked that always believe it
[53:24] what you see that new birth they put it
[53:31] on the word then shout and cry what
[53:36] you're saying they're shouting and crime
[53:38] is a new bar that's the country to the
[53:40] Bible and then you say I'm destroying
[53:43] you're destroying my my belief brother
[53:46] Dale I believe I got saved when I cried
[53:50] you got saved and then cried or maybe
[53:56] cried for you got saved
[54:04] why would Paul come along and say have
[54:08] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[54:11] believed or having previously believed
[54:18] seeing you know what the new birth was
[54:20] so I know what the new birth you people
[54:25] have said well I'm a new worth it if it
[54:28] don't fit the Word of God let's see then
[54:36] I give the new birth to everybody every
[54:39] age every time because it's the birth of
[54:42] the word then Martin Luther already
[54:48] being supposingly a Christian then God
[54:52] spoke to him about the just shall live
[54:54] by faith
[54:56] John Wesley already converted under
[54:59] Luther's message into a Christian
[55:02] teaching into insane and he comes to
[55:04] America to convert in it and gets here
[55:06] and gets the message of sanctification
[55:12] right already believe in it he was saved
[55:20] already believe in Luther's message of
[55:23] the just shall live by faith
[55:31] - the age started condemning the people
[55:34] for doing what Luther was doing drinking
[55:38] a beer and sitting in the pub - places
[55:41] you don't not have been doing and God
[55:45] started through Wesley condemning those
[55:47] things so what is the new bar what -
[55:53] brother Dale I'm gonna walk up the altar
[55:55] and see that's where people think that
[55:58] I'm I'm off about you come up to the
[56:00] order to be pray for for the baptism
[56:01] when the older goes you want to get
[56:06] everybody around and get them emotional
[56:08] shouting and praying and hollering and
[56:10] little random says do not speak in
[56:15] tongues when you're praying for people
[56:20] to receive the Holy Ghost and time you
[56:22] need that quote he said because you get
[56:26] their mind on the wrong thing
[56:31] and he said I've heard people speak in
[56:36] tongues and call on the devil see do you
[56:48] know what the new birthday is well
[56:51] you've destroyed all of my things that I
[56:53] thought it was well good praise God we
[56:56] got that done now what are we going to
[56:59] do about it
[57:02] see now we can start thinking about a
[57:05] growth development of a Christian that
[57:11] was never taught in the organized
[57:12] religions and things may be a little bit
[57:15] here a little bit there may be a thought
[57:17] yeah we knew the Bible said being born
[57:19] again
[57:20] I knew that another Baptist Church I
[57:22] could read the Bible but see now we need
[57:29] to growth development
[57:30] why because ever born-again believer
[57:43] is born again as a baby but I was six
[57:51] years old I said I ain't got nothing to
[57:54] do with it
[57:55] you get born again you're a baby you
[58:00] ain't got no teeth well the Bible says
[58:06] we're supposed to drain the help and not
[58:10] to eat meat and the baby don't have no
[58:13] teeth right a natural baby doin okay a
[58:20] spiritual baby don't have no teeth
[58:26] you drink the milk right
[58:33] you're a baby I don't like to be called
[58:37] a baby I've been in this message long
[58:39] and brother Dale have I tell you what
[58:41] that's crazy god I hope so but what good
[58:45] is it done that's the only question I
[58:48] ask ever person that's born again is
[58:54] born again the same make sure you follow
[59:01] what I'm saying it's the same for
[59:05] everybody
[59:06] the difference in the attributes of what
[59:10] we do afterward is a lot of difference
[59:13] one shouted one cried one smoking dog
[59:16] wonder that's why if you don't have the
[59:26] new birth you don't know what it is is
[59:30] that plain enough if you don't have the
[59:33] new burro
[59:33] you don't know what the new birth is
[59:38] okay we'll go back down there hordes
[59:40] three thousand there was three thousand
[59:41] I got site then we take a trip over to
[59:44] next country we get over to our say
[59:46] wants a new bar wasn't Virginie where I
[59:47] don't know what about new bar that's
[59:49] exactly the way we are let's see
[59:55] everything we think figured out and then
[1:00:00] somebody comes along and says something
[1:00:02] I never will forget brother moat ears
[1:00:07] ago he he wanted to go to a long story
[1:00:11] but he wanted to go to a meeting they
[1:00:13] were having
[1:00:14] all right the meeting they were having
[1:00:16] was a convincing and they were having it
[1:00:18] was about the new birth you know I knew
[1:00:23] he couldn't hit me do it anyway he
[1:00:24] needed some water pipes and in fixing
[1:00:27] inside of the house from different
[1:00:29] things I said why don't you just go to
[1:00:31] the meeting and I'll do the work that
[1:00:33] way we'll get God working both ways I'll
[1:00:36] get you fixed and your house stopped
[1:00:37] leaking and all this things and you can
[1:00:41] go up there maybe they might be somebody
[1:00:44] you can talk to cuz he didn't go knowing
[1:00:46] he was gonna preach but he goes up and
[1:00:51] someone finds him very nice ride brother
[1:00:53] mold let's get him to preach tonight
[1:00:59] he said you preach it on the new bar
[1:01:01] yeah first night he preached
[1:01:04] justification oh they wanted to hear
[1:01:13] more second night he preached
[1:01:17] sanctification see all the brothers was
[1:01:20] giving up there they were scheduled to
[1:01:23] preach you know
[1:01:24] and once he preached that justification
[1:01:26] they've never heard it like to have
[1:01:29] chopping off you pie sins where does
[1:01:31] nothing do you feel sure enough you know
[1:01:32] and he begin to bring it out and in life
[1:01:34] and things I'm sure well see they begin
[1:01:39] to give up their position to let him
[1:01:41] preach so he preached justification
[1:01:44] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[1:01:46] ghost I'm sure a lot of people caught a
[1:01:48] lot of things would you know what you
[1:01:50] know was invited to come back because
[1:01:54] once he explained it it's like what I'm
[1:02:00] explaining or trying if it's not your
[1:02:03] shout and it's not your crime that was
[1:02:06] not the new birth
[1:02:07] that was an aftereffect of the birth the
[1:02:14] birth was the word you had heard and
[1:02:16] took that word in the gospel that said
[1:02:19] they took the word and held it the Holy
[1:02:23] Ghost could come in quicken that word
[1:02:25] Darcie new birth what you're doing the
[1:02:28] way I ain't done away with nobody
[1:02:30] shouting crying or nothing
[1:02:32] I believe in it I'll quote you the
[1:02:35] Prophet a stillborn baby is dead
[1:02:38] that's paraphrasing but it's close
[1:02:41] enough stillborn baby is a dead baby
[1:02:50] there's going to be emotions with the
[1:02:52] new birth anything that doesn't have an
[1:02:56] emotion with it it's not a new birth you
[1:03:04] sound like you against this but now you
[1:03:11] will rejoice and have a good time in our
[1:03:14] salvation but to remember what our
[1:03:22] salvation is it's the same as everybody
[1:03:25] in the Bible all the way down and saying
[1:03:28] whether prophet trying to explain it you
[1:03:29] go to the prophets message and show me
[1:03:31] I'm asking you to come show me where he
[1:03:34] ever taught anything about emotionalism
[1:03:37] isn't he in the new birth he's their way
[1:03:41] with experience as a measuring rod as a
[1:03:49] measuring rod not a way with experience
[1:03:52] because he never taught to do away with
[1:03:53] the experience he said if you have
[1:03:55] looking at yesterday he said if you have
[1:03:57] the new birth you've had an experience
[1:04:00] you can't have the new birth without
[1:04:02] having an experience because that's
[1:04:09] something you live through over and over
[1:04:15] till you get it ever born-again believer
[1:04:17] is born the same
[1:04:21] it's the birth of the word they heard
[1:04:24] and ever born-again believer starts out
[1:04:28] as a baby not courting allit what age
[1:04:31] they are or even the amount of word some
[1:04:34] theologian come in here and he'd say
[1:04:37] brother Dale I wanna I wanna I'm not I
[1:04:41] realize I'm not saved
[1:04:42] that's our okay let's take care of that
[1:04:44] we pray for salvation but I tell him
[1:04:47] right real quick when you get the Holy
[1:04:50] Ghost it ain't gonna put you in the
[1:04:51] pyramid of it to top you may be able to
[1:04:54] talk about things but it ain't gonna put
[1:04:57] you that God is gonna come and put you
[1:05:00] there and then you can talk about being
[1:05:02] born again then you can use the
[1:05:09] scriptures that we were talking about
[1:05:10] the other day well as newborn babes
[1:05:13] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[1:05:16] wears no one desiring the sincere milk
[1:05:19] of the word that we may grow thereby
[1:05:28] now how many of you feed your babies a
[1:05:32] piece of steak when it's two weeks old
[1:05:34] it ain't got no teeth you ain't got no
[1:05:39] ability you can now and shuck off of it
[1:05:43] but you know I think come on folks we've
[1:05:47] raised up in the time when we didn't
[1:05:49] have all the baby foods and something my
[1:05:51] wife would take the kids meal and you
[1:05:53] know beans or whatever it was and squish
[1:05:56] it all up and do it up and feed it to
[1:05:59] her and they left surprisingly but you
[1:06:07] know what I'm talking about you go give
[1:06:09] the spoon and the beans to the kid II
[1:06:11] don't know anything about it if it's two
[1:06:12] days old get it right on what we're
[1:06:17] talking about the natural is always the
[1:06:19] type of the spiritual right see seeing
[1:06:27] you're out purified your souls in
[1:06:28] obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:06:30] John finding love of the Brethren that
[1:06:33] you love one another with appear
[1:06:34] art being born again what not of
[1:06:39] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[1:06:46] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[1:06:49] forever
[1:06:52] 1st Peter 1 in 23 22 what do you get
[1:06:59] with a new birth what we've done about
[1:07:00] Wednesday
[1:07:00] it's the earnest of the spirit into our
[1:07:04] hearts when you get the new birth you
[1:07:07] get the new birth there's an earnest you
[1:07:09] don't get it in a full grown well I've
[1:07:15] got it further up than rest y'all what
[1:07:19] made you that way I just gave the
[1:07:21] illustration put the theologian down
[1:07:23] there I'm gonna tell him hey how old are
[1:07:25] you I'm 80 years old and I got 12 years
[1:07:27] in college good you're a little baby you
[1:07:32] need some sugar tits
[1:07:36] you need milk well I know I was about to
[1:07:40] work you know the letter don't throw it
[1:07:44] away with the letter of it under what
[1:07:49] you had didn't bring it across right see
[1:07:55] the earnest of the spirit seasons 114
[1:08:01] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:08:03] what until the redemption of the
[1:08:06] purchased possession unto the praise of
[1:08:10] his glory the new birth is an earnest of
[1:08:15] part payment and everbody started that
[1:08:21] away except 120 120 you got a defier
[1:08:28] with a prophet he said they had these
[1:08:30] virtues so you go with that he said but
[1:08:32] he didn't have the headstone so we go
[1:08:34] with that before anybody runs our
[1:08:39] computers and uh uh you know gets to be
[1:08:41] a brain to running I don't say and I'm
[1:08:45] just this is me
[1:08:48] maybe not all the hundred and 20s in the
[1:08:49] upper room not the Holy Ghost it's at
[1:08:53] hospice ition worse the Holy Spirit
[1:08:55] because it's according to how much word
[1:08:57] you know it's according to how much
[1:09:00] understanding you know it will get to
[1:09:03] that you said well I believe 120 well
[1:09:08] that's all right I'm not our again we
[1:09:09] I'm just being sensible if they were not
[1:09:16] tutored and trained they didn't get what
[1:09:19] the rest of them not okay but they got
[1:09:24] the new birth but everything down stars
[1:09:29] in the 3000 everything was they know was
[1:09:31] a baby when it's born again I don't care
[1:09:37] who it is worth what it's a baby
[1:09:39] according to the Bible Paul must have
[1:09:43] understood that because he constantly
[1:09:45] spoke of the earnest he spoke of those
[1:09:48] things about how he was just a baby
[1:09:52] what about a great theologian like the
[1:09:54] Apostle Paul and all of his doing and he
[1:09:59] turned out to be a baby he goes through
[1:10:03] the backside of the desert takes what
[1:10:07] Scrolls he has and what thing and when
[1:10:10] he come out of the higher he was
[1:10:12] preaching the same thing Peter was
[1:10:15] that's why I've tried to illustrate it
[1:10:18] over the years try my best to get you to
[1:10:19] see Paul tells us about adoption but he
[1:10:24] doesn't break it down to how to do this
[1:10:26] and do that other than desire the
[1:10:28] sincere milk of the word do you my girl
[1:10:30] Peter says add to your faith virtue see
[1:10:33] now they're in the right order and run
[1:10:35] around said Peter and Paul had no
[1:10:37] difference in doctrine are you listening
[1:10:45] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:10:47] I have fed you with milk Paul says
[1:11:00] he says you're even as babes in Christ I
[1:11:04] have fed you with milk and not with meat
[1:11:08] or hitherto you were not able to bear it
[1:11:13] neither he says now then we have many
[1:11:23] things to say it hard to be understood
[1:11:26] which be the first principles of the
[1:11:34] Oracles of God and become such as have
[1:11:37] need of milk and not a beat what about
[1:11:42] talking to the Hebrews they were
[1:11:44] supposed to be anchored in the word and
[1:11:49] he's now telling them that their babies
[1:11:55] let's go ain't no baby yes see that's
[1:11:58] what I'm saying go ahead strong meat
[1:12:00] belongeth to them that are full age even
[1:12:03] those who are by reason of use have
[1:12:05] their senses exercised to discern both
[1:12:10] good and evil what about it what about
[1:12:17] it a baby
[1:12:28] sister Barbara said she had a dream
[1:12:30] years ago that people around here one
[1:12:33] would do this and out of the other and
[1:12:34] she'd see me I don't want I have them up
[1:12:36] on my shoulders well I'm just honest to
[1:12:39] say if you'd have seen it you just been
[1:12:43] a bunch of babies well brother they are
[1:12:46] you calling us babies does that offend
[1:12:49] you
[1:12:49] it don't offend me whatsoever for you to
[1:12:52] call me a babe in Christ you have given
[1:12:54] me the greatest honor that any human
[1:12:58] being could pleasure would be the fact
[1:13:01] that I would be considered a newborn
[1:13:04] baby in the kingdom of God with the
[1:13:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost the life of
[1:13:11] Christ living in me thank God called me
[1:13:13] a baby let's grow up right let's grow up
[1:13:21] to getting our feelings hurt about
[1:13:24] everything like let's grow up
[1:13:28] quit being babies hey folks that's when
[1:13:34] a lot of people used to laugh at me
[1:13:35] they said how in the world can you
[1:13:37] preach the way you do brother they'll
[1:13:40] and I'm talking about back when brother
[1:13:42] mote was the pastor said how can you
[1:13:46] throw me people outside not necessarily
[1:13:48] here said you mean you preached with him
[1:13:50] in the depth of his understanding of the
[1:13:53] Word of God in the message I said thank
[1:13:55] God I said if I go wrong he can correct
[1:13:58] me if I preach it wrong he can show me
[1:14:02] where I'm I need to get straightened out
[1:14:04] I wanted to preach it that away that's
[1:14:12] what wouldn't bother me to it I'll say
[1:14:14] it this way forever theologian is in
[1:14:17] this message to sat down and let me talk
[1:14:19] to him about the new birth and wouldn't
[1:14:23] bother me at all but it might bother
[1:14:27] them for me to tell him a bunch of
[1:14:29] babies cause they getting upset about
[1:14:31] what I'm saying so if you getting upset
[1:14:34] it proves your baby right you say glory
[1:14:40] hallelujah now
[1:14:42] me how to grow up because the Bible says
[1:14:46] to grow up in him a bunch of babies but
[1:14:58] let's say that's I I try my best you
[1:15:02] called me deeper then I try my best to
[1:15:04] stay with the greatest simplicity they
[1:15:07] try to bring something because I know
[1:15:10] where all babies bless good ain't no
[1:15:16] baby you fended me if I offended you by
[1:15:19] saying that you are not a born-again
[1:15:22] believer is that strong enough well
[1:15:28] you're doing away now with my belief is
[1:15:30] or what I thought was salvation you kind
[1:15:33] of got me away from from the shouting
[1:15:35] and all these other things now I've got
[1:15:37] it anchored I'm in the message being in
[1:15:39] the message don't make a birth
[1:15:41] it's when the message is revealed to
[1:15:44] live in you and me there's a birth and
[1:15:47] in no way was preaching we're brother
[1:15:50] Brandon would say this message we this
[1:15:52] bride is to be delivered of a new birth
[1:15:55] from Malachi 4 you realize that new
[1:15:59] birth is not gonna be a baby form not in
[1:16:02] this day it may start out is there but
[1:16:06] it's gonna be a growth development
[1:16:13] what about it to me
[1:16:18] I enjoyed there the other night
[1:16:23] preaching about were because I knew
[1:16:26] brother I meant talked about the white
[1:16:27] button
[1:16:28] I knew he talked about the little spot
[1:16:31] in you but it just really hit me and I
[1:16:36] started reading the things brother
[1:16:39] Brennan said about since when you were
[1:16:41] born again believer he said it's like a
[1:16:45] little button
[1:16:45] life inside of you he calls it eternal
[1:16:49] life well I thought I got this field
[1:16:51] well if you got filled how are you gonna
[1:16:54] get any of this I mean if you come out
[1:17:00] of it for well I got a new birds that I
[1:17:03] was filled with his spirit like I've
[1:17:11] always said I give honor where on earth
[1:17:12] do but I tell it like it is
[1:17:15] brother mold in nineteen in 70 or 71
[1:17:18] right in there brother calling him
[1:17:20] started coming he started preaching on
[1:17:23] the statue of a perfect man my waist
[1:17:27] have God everybody in the world would
[1:17:30] have heard those services when he
[1:17:34] finished I asked him one simple question
[1:17:38] listen now we believe what you teaching
[1:17:41] leave everything about it you got it
[1:17:43] laid out right cause that's what he said
[1:17:45] in the book he read it yeah I said we
[1:17:48] don't ask you a simple question now how
[1:17:50] do I get those virtues the rudder
[1:17:56] brownie in the statute of perfect man
[1:17:57] doesn't tell you verbatim how to get
[1:18:01] those virtues he tells you of a growth
[1:18:03] he tells you of being born again during
[1:18:05] but he doesn't tell you the direct
[1:18:07] Avenue to follow
[1:18:09] I went from 7480
[1:18:14] about nineteen eighty the Lord revealed
[1:18:18] it not come and preached
[1:18:24] how do you get those mergers through the
[1:18:27] opening of the word if the new birth is
[1:18:31] the opening of the word then the growth
[1:18:33] development is the opening of the word
[1:18:37] right see then you can see how the
[1:18:41] Prophet done it I'll make this statement
[1:18:43] and then quit on you can see how he done
[1:18:45] and all of those years in his preaching
[1:18:48] he's preaching in 56 on the Intervale
[1:18:54] talking about a living moving
[1:18:56] instrumentality because he knew the
[1:18:59] Pentecostals had cabbage down on the new
[1:19:01] birth and was not bringing it you know
[1:19:03] into the fullness he could see that he
[1:19:07] begin back in those early years I ask
[1:19:09] you if you will to just take your
[1:19:11] message if you want to be something to
[1:19:13] assign to you to study I'm just starting
[1:19:15] about 19 and 61 and listen to ever take
[1:19:20] from 61 really 60 60 up to 62 when he
[1:19:26] preached statue of a perfect man and if
[1:19:28] you listen to it you'll see that he kept
[1:19:30] growing and kept growing income before
[1:19:33] he gets to the statue of a perfect man
[1:19:35] he said this come to me just the other
[1:19:38] day out in the woods
[1:19:39] one second Peter he's up on what I was
[1:19:42] studying on it's all those years he was
[1:19:45] trying to preach the statue of a perfect
[1:19:47] land will reach some of those thing we
[1:19:51] did it to other excuse me the other day
[1:19:53] on that one work was talking about the
[1:19:55] Messiah know about growing growing
[1:19:57] growing holy he began in that light that
[1:20:01] early part of the sixties to dig in
[1:20:04] deeper and deeper the people begin to
[1:20:07] pull away because he didn't know what he
[1:20:10] was saying when he begin trying to bring
[1:20:12] the birth and he would make statements
[1:20:15] like him in mmm-hmm he's one of them you
[1:20:20] must be born again one her he said I can
[1:20:22] conclusively prove that you are born
[1:20:25] again and then baptized into the body I
[1:20:30] remember when that winter Island it's
[1:20:33] still going around

[1:20:36] about simple matter you're born again by
[1:20:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:45] your growth development is your baptism
[1:20:48] into the body further the gifts and the
[1:20:51] different things of the body of Christ
[1:20:54] as a adopted manifested child very
[1:21:01] simple all of those things bring them to
[1:21:07] me it's when it sounds contrary

[1:22:31] opening of those seals to be able to
[1:22:33] receive the virtues of the statute of a
[1:22:35] perfect man cause you and I are not
