that supposedly had a hole in its heart they don't know why it don't have a hole in its heart doctors usually are not very wrong well they were probably wrong on that one or they were right and then they got wrong by a healing that that happened um by the fervent prayer of the Bride of Jesus Christ and we appreciate the Lord being with us so let's bow our heads and uh continue on with get this frog out of my throat continue on with patience dear Lord Jesus thank you for this evening Lord I pray that you'd be with us now here in the middle of the week Lord we fought the demons on Monday and

the furtherment of this service just take care of our our our needs Lord and and be with a little bride around the world we thinking about the missionaries brother uh Joe Green and his wife is over in

about a week just bless brother Joe sister rexan there with them too Lord I pray that you'd touch them give them a safe trip back just bless us in the furth of this service Lord in Jesus name we pray amen yeah just remember remember brother Joe Green and his wife they're over there in farmtown Jamaica having services so it's um good to hear from them in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth second Peter 1 15 says besides this what we said besides the new birth giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge for knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness 1 Timothy 3:16 Says without controversy all right there's no disputation there's no no way to get out of this if you're if you're a child of God if you're a son and daughter of God without controver controversy great is this mystery of godliness CU it's going to be in you when I have to uh I can't find it in Jesus Christ cuz I don't see him you understand I don't see him here with his physical him walking around I see it in us so that's godliness that's God god listen it's easy for God to be Godly because he's God but us being Sinners made made in His image and made in his likeness and made with and get the new birth then there's the mystery of godliness is that we can live and see and work just like God and I'll prove it to you in just a little bit brother B you know it's always that question I can't be good enough God doesn't ask you to be good enough he just ask you to do what he says just get in Christ and let him do the work all right remember we'll read the quote where scrap peaps of ministers that have tried people have tried to what Pentecost has tried to produce something they try to work something up they try to get it's going to come down to this right here without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into Glory you may be seated that word with controversy is Strife or without dispute without a quarrel we're not going to sit and we're not we're not going to argue I'm not going to argue with somebody that I can't be like God cuz God told me I had to be like God all right and if he did then guess what he had to do he had to make a way that even just common folks like us can make it not some Theologian not somebody knows more than you know but something that we can do starting in our everyday life in this Plan of Redemption that we've been talking about and we see that Plan of Redemption I see it more and more I was watching a a brother online this uh yesterday and and uh you just kind of see what's going on out in the in the message world and and he was talking about free moral agency and he said this message did away with free moral agency I said I want to see that quote I want to see where that was done away with in this message you still are a free moral agent you can sit here today and you can take that right there or you can reject it you can take God and you can reject it you can decide for yourself if you're going to go on with God or you're not going to go with God we're still human and in our Humanity we still have choices every day that we have to make so I don't understand where well I do understand because they want to talk about that Seed doctrine where you was just lying down through here and you there's no other way you could come well by for knowledge you can say that but not just by predestination let's read this right here so forign knowledge looks back and says that he foresaw this and he knows that's the reason he could tell what the end was from the beginning to me that is so simple God is God he's infinite he can see he already saw your whole life before he even said let there be before he made an angel he knew your life he knew the day you were going to get born again or the day you were going to turn it down cuz he's God and being God now that we can go back in the back part of God's mind we can as Chris was talking about this weekend you know you see you've got the clothes about the seed over here and you got the quot about the seed but I like what he said he brought out a good point he said it's not something inside of you that's tangible right and I like that you you can't do away with a quote over here that you came here with this with this seed and I read it uh back here just a few minutes ago and then over here where you were born lost all right you got to bring it to the middle and realize that there's not a tangible anything in you that's that wasn't even that like Adolf Hitler different ones I'm telling you to be just God had to bring everybody here the same way everybody on the same freem moral agency even Cain he told Cain he said Cain if you'll do different what make a choice if you'll make a choice I'll bring you in the fold but he knew before the foundation of the world what Cain would do brother R said he knew that if he put Adam and Eve in human flesh they'd fall but being a righteous judge he can't get in the way of that and make you not be that because at the end time when we come up to the day of judgment if we're not judged here we're going to be judged there and if we're judged there Adolf Hitler's got the same chance me and you got or he did he doesn't now but he did before but by for knowledge God could see Adolf Hitler's life and we use him and and I'm not ashamed to use him cuz he was vile he he was almost the Devil Himself had six million Jews killed and it was just not a it was not a mercy killing he killed them right and left all right so he was a vile man but he had the same chance you did or God's Not Just Adolf Hitler can stand at the at the day of judgment and say Hey you made them different from me that makes you not righteous you can't judge me but see he didn't he made us all free moreal ageny he's going to say no Danny Fountain is standing right here because and he'll tell him the very day the very hour and the very moment that he received Christ as his personal savior all right so to me that makes it so simple that God put everybody on free moral agency and you got a choice to make you still got a choice to make now even after you're born again I was looking at that a little bit a few minutes ago but let's let's continue I'll get into it in just a second the reason he could tell what the end was from the beginning and therefore knowing knowing that all these marvelous days were living in now that we're living in to stand and witness and see the things that we've seen now see he's already seen it we are seeing it now all right God had to make a preparation for it he knew that that that that I you whoever would come to a place to where we might go out in the world and we we would do the things of the world but we would come to a place where said hey that's enough you had to come to that same place God came knocking on your door for the last time but he knew you would react as you reacted he didn't get a surprise he knew how you would react so now therefore I do believe in predestination he predetermined it because he saw it first then he could predetermine every bit of this but by for knowledge and your choice see I can go with anybody on on the seed doctr if F talk about choice and something not being tangible inside of you there couldn't be something eternal life can't be rambling around somewhere inside of you while you're a sinner I am so sorry that is not going to happen amen God will not dwell in an unclean vessel why does he clean you up why does the unclean Spirit have to go out of you well all that why is the Plan of Redemption just well just believe it and there it is it'll just pop right up now no it's a birth and what is a birth a birth is a mess a birth is birthing what into the world and you're getting a nature and I was thinking about this yesterday you get a nature and that nature is not of God are you wouldn't need a new birth that nature is of the devil and there's not a nature God inside of you to combat that at that moment or it would it's like brother Dale talk about a long time ago about two Soul doctor that's kind of what it is they've just they' just cleaned the pig up and painted it pink it's the same thing you know you get two souls or two Natures or they're in there fighting they ain't in there fighting in your soul it's either Faith or doubt tonight it's either Faith or doubt brother R never changed that he never said there was three or four people in your soul he said it's Faith or doubt one are the two not one and the two so what's fighting you now is your second realm your spirit realm is what I'm talking about now I'm talk talk if you're born again today we are not talking about that we're talking about then Chief which one wins he said the one I feed now listen it wasn't white dog and black dog in his soul you can't have that if you got the new birth if you got the new birth I thought that cleaned all that out and what sealed you sealed you now listen if God sealed you you and the devil in at the same time we got an issue but he didn't something had to be driven out of you according to the Book of Luke driven out and if you didn't get it all cleaned up and if you didn't get it patched up and vulcanized he's going to come right back in but we fight that folks in our spirit realm today most of your fight is going to be in your spirit realm because remember your soul is perfect if you're born again perfect complete never sin never had a bad day never said a bad word never had a bad thought but yet he's living inside of you that's your theophany that's what's working that's what's firing you every day but there is a nature when you was born through your mom and your daddy you were given a nature that you being that you're fighting all the time but you got to realize whether it's in your soul fighting it or whether it's in your spirit fighting it that's this whole thing that's why I spend all that time on the new birth on faith you got to believe that God is in your soul and the devil is not you're sealed until the day of your Redemption but all these other things the outside that Spirit realm of memory reason conscious effects and Imagination there's where Satan is playing with you at there's where Satan is bombarding you every day of your life saying you're not worth it but that guy inside of you says yes you are cuz listen that guy inside is going to if he's born again he's going to lean to the word of God and I'm going to read you here in just a few minutes it has to because the seed remaineth in them in you or them you and you can't see it and remember when you read that scripture you got to remember that the Bible is written to Christians okay so the seed remains in you after you're born again not not remains in you at your birth at your baby birth at your new birth yes but not at your baby birth why would Paul have to fight why would Paul have Christians killed if he had anything inside of him that was eternal life that'd be that'd be God fighting God but it wasn't it wasn't sure there was representation as brother Chris was talking about if you go by representation then you're there cuz what is what's represented is the mind of God has come to the Earth and this is what we're doing we're looking at Time and Eternity amen we're looking at time here and Eternity here and we've got to look at that Eternal part and that's what we've got a as we were talking the other day a TI poost that's where you tie it to you tie it to that eternal life you tie it to that experience that you have that the things I used to do I do them no more now listen we slip up and make mistakes but remember if you're born again in your soul you don't make mistakes God does not make mistakes amen we've got to do what white dog has got to be fed more than the black dog and the black dog is that one right there we're talking going to p statue of perfect man we can let him win because we don't listen we don't come to church we don't pray we don't study let's listen to what brother Ry says and I love this Chris was talking about it too back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve now why was he going to achieve this he knew we'd be lost he knew we wouldn't need this he knew we wouldn't need 60 years after the prophet left for us to get this thing right but there was something he was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it why he wanted to get you back to that Genesis 126 man in its fullness amen right everybody with me look but it's in order to let him be expressed not you in order to let him be expressed through you he had to do these things he had to let us get lost he had to let us because he was what he had a attribute of a savior a redeemer and and the whole book of redemption you know if you look at Revelations 5 and you look at that and you see that book and you see it being in in the hands of the original owner well that was a book of your name that was the book of eternal life that was not the book of all the other people cuz that's a special part of the book that's the Eternal section that's the part God had and said I have redeemed this or I have held this I'm sorry I've held this Adam couldn't do it cuz Adam was not a redeemer right Adam died his soul went to the whatever de to paradise and he couldn't save nobody else but thank God Jesus Christ could go through all those Dimensions it didn't matter where he could come come back and go inside of you praise God he can go inside of you and live his life through you then we sit like a bump on a pickle we got to be happy about this at least smile first it wasn't even a moon a star an atom a molecule anything he was God but now watch brother R he backs up he said he wasn't exactly God cuz God's an object of worship and God's not an name name God's a title he had to have a name his name was Jesus Christ so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be Express now where were we where was that book where was that where was that part of God that Genesis 1 126 man it could not be unfolded in the Old Testament it could not be unfolded until the New Testament in his blood where he could save us be a savior be a father son healer and all these great attributes they were in God but remember being in God they were expressed when he died and came back and then went into the 120 as they were speaking of this weekend you know Jesus could have just died and that have been it he had all of us inside of him though that was his whole being of nevertheless as brother um Dutch was speaking brother Chris you know nevertheless not my will you know who was talking us we were the expression he wanted to get out it wasn't it wasn't he was going to sure he died alone as a human being but he didn't die alone in his Spirit realm he had all of us in him millions of bride he had you and I in there when he was on the cross what I was on his mind Hebrews 9 says forth the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heord sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh now if we just stopped right there and stayed in the Old Testament absolutely you couldn't say I'm perfected by God absolutely you couldn't say I am God made manifest in flesh you couldn't say I am a son and daughter of God if we stayed right there how much more though shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit there's the key that eternal spirit is eternal life which is the new birth and that is not in you when you're born you're born dead that has to come inside of you by a birth to do what purge your conscience from dead Works to serve a living God Paul's asking these questions and for this C he's the mediator of the New Testament by means of death his death for the Redemption of the transgressions I thought we were perfect for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must be necessity be the death of a testator Jesus knew he was dying that's why he could say in the upper room this is a new testament in my blood for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth second Peter 3:14 wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace look at without spot and blameless there's no way in your natural self you can do that there's no way in your in your natural human nature you can do that and account that the longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation you see what he's saying the longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you 1 Corinthians 1:7 so that you come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of Our Lord who shall also confirm you unto the end that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus now what is today today is the day of our Lord Jesus all right God is faithful by whom you were called into the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing there be no divisions among you we got a lot of work to do but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment now here we go this is going to hit us right between the eyes know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God all right we're unrighteous we were not worthy we didn't deserve the kingdom of God but it was there for us as brother Chris said by representation God knew there a group of people would want it so he made it for us a place be not deceive neither fornicators idolators adulterers effeminate abusers of themselves with mankind you look these up I'm not they're horrible nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkers how many of y'all have already okay nor revilers the extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God we're done we're done and such for some of you Paul's preaching to his congregation the Corinthians he said and such were some of you now what was he doing he wasn't judging them he was telling them but you're are washed you have a way out you have a way of Escape amen you have a way to be judged now to be Sanctified now now listen that's the first church age that's to the Corinthians what about now what about now when we have the perfect word of God we've been we've been brought back back to that Faith right we've been brought back to the faith that was once delivered to these people right here and such were some of you but you are washed but you are Sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God Philippians 2:15 says you that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation well we're here we're here among whom you shine as lights in the world different yes sir God will make you different if he's inside of you all right we know what Temperance is let's continue through here with patience just a minute I want to get to Godliness patience is steadfastness that means I I was I was kind of going through all this you know you got faith virtue knowledge Temperance and then you come to patience and patience says stand there stand right there Temperance is kind of an involvement you know you you got to watch your temper you got to there's a kind of a two-way thing but when you look at patience what brother Bown say the first person to have patience with God so you stand there brother B said when you've done all stand can we do that can we stand though knowing that we have faith virtue knowledge and Temperance working toward our patience that's why these are in perfect order I'm going to read you a quote here in a minute where brother B said look we have come all the way up this pyramid to Godliness and he said it's up here it wasn't down here cuz God knew you couldn't live it down here he put it way up here that's why brotherly kindness is way up there cuz it's real hard to love your neighbor as you love yourself so steadfast this constancy endurance how many of us like to have it I mean we'll have sometimes we slip off into eternity eternity and we have a constant life every once in a while and you say man this is good and then all of a sudden when you say that guess what happens yeah the devil hears you too but constancy that's what I like I like things being constant I like I don't like uh a lot of um um ups and downs but we have to have them people have ups and downs and we all do cuz we're human but when are we going to get to a place to where that doesn't Spike so much this way or so much this way where they can come and be more like a wave instead of like a mountain and a and a and a valley and a mountain and a valley and a mountain and a valley that's what to me the Walk of God is when you're a Christian when you're a young Christian you absolutely uh they call it they call tanking you tank out I mean you do you fail you think you're worthless you you start doing some of the things if you're not born again if you're just in justification and sanctification unclean Spirit goes out remember if you don't get something filled it up fill it back up it's going to come right back in and you're going to do the same thing you did before and then you're like man this is worse I'm doing the same thing guess what keep going keep going get born again keep sitting under the fountain you keep sitting under the water it will get you wet amen don't leave it sit under it right send under a good message s s in a good congregation where people can help you where we can all help each other and not be a hindrance to each other right in the New Testament the characteristics of a man who is not swerved look from his deliberate purpose now you and I have got to have not just Faith to be Christians anymore we got to have faith for a body change we got to have faith for a resurrection we got to have faith to where we come to a spot to where the the prophet of God said Satan will not know what to do with you oh would I want to have that place you wouldn't and his loyalty to what faith and piety by even the greatest trials and sufferings patiently steadfast James 1:2 says my brethren count it all joy when you fall into many Temptations how many of us has got that on a refrigerator no you don't you don't put that one up count it Joy when you fall into many Temptations knowing this that's a trying of what this guy right down here the trying of your foundation worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire what wanting nothing do you believe that brother Brown said the Smur Church AG he now the Lord Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is for so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer that is what they said in Malachi 1 1-3 the B burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you sayith the Lord yet we say wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother sayith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau how did he do that by forn knowledge he knew what they'd be when they come out of the womb he knew what kind of nature they would have he knew what would motivate them and what motivated Esau was he didn't care anything about the birthright when God had made this big plan in the Old Testament that the birthright meant everything and then Esau's like I'm just hungry you know let's I just need something to eat Jacob would have seemed the worser person but Esau gave away the one thing that God promised them that they could have and they would have all the possession was the birthright firstborn got everything and I hated Esau latest mountains in his Heritage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness you see they could not figure out God's love and if we see this too we we you look at the people and I feel sorry for the people out in the world I was listening to the radio the other day and you know they they talk about the love of God well when they think when they talk about the love of God it's like this greasy Grandpa right you know don't worry about what you're wearing don't worry about all that Old Testament stuff you know and the uh don't worry just just God loves you his love is unconditional but our love back to him has conditions right amen our love back to him he listen remember because he died for the whole world right but watch what the prophet now watch he just brings us and and he covers it way better than I do goes watch they thought that love meant no suffering they thought you being a Christian all of a sudden all the lights in the house was going to be on the bills was going to quit coming your gas was always going to be full you didn't have a problem with your wife and your kids you know they all was just perfect little angels wrong I don't know where you got that from they thought that love meant a baby with parental care this is not a baby with parental care this is the statue of a man a perfect man not a perfect baby they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact they were chosen under salvation because God has chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and believe the truth what you believe in the truth not him you believe in the truth so there's your condition you got to believe the truth he's not going to love you and you not do the truth he can't he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative you know why because he knows what it'll take to get you through he knows what to do to take you and break you through to become a better Christian he is Sovereign but watch this but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job said he put strength in US job 23:6 you may see himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered now how in the world are you and I going to be made perfect if he didn't I mean if we didn't and he did he didn't though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became what the author of what you're supposed to be the author of your book that's your book he came he became the author of that he wrote that and being made perfect he became the author what is an author somebody writes a book that either has a personal experience if it's non-fiction or fiction something formulated in his mind God is Not non-fiction I mean he's not fiction sorry he is nonfiction thank you Bob I saw your face I knew i' said something wrong thank you he's not the author of a fictional book he's the author of non-fiction I'm sorry he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them what no wait a minute condition unto all them that obey him in plain language brother brandom give us it in plain language right here the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering wow oh he's the perfect one he's the sinless one yet that human body had to be perfected by the things that he suffered and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him I say one more time while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did he want this James 1: 12:4 my brethren counted all joy we read that when you fall into many Temptations knowing this is trying your faith work is patience but let patience have a perfect work why does he stand by the reason is Romans 8 ver1 17 he explains it and if children then HS if God suffered we suffer hes of God and join HS with Christ if so be that we what suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time everybody say this present time are not worthy to be compared all right with the glory that shall be revealed where in us he brings it right back down to us he's not going to he didn't he didn't do something and say well I I'm not going to be able to depend on this group so I'm gonna get me another group bride is bride always will be bride always was bride in his mind in his mind always was bride in his mind in the back part of his mind the memory part of God you and I didn't know it we we didn't know one thing about being a bride when we were out in the world did you maybe a natural one but not a spiritual bride not headship our headship was you know who I'm not even going to call his name that's who it was well I some of you maybe not unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift character is not in the nine spiritual gifts if you have the nine spiritual gifts it will build your character and then you will be victorious but character is not in there that he just gives you character all right so he's not going to give you these virtues you got to fight for them a man without character look a man without character he can't rain he can't rule over anything how you going to rule over this if you don't have the right character cuz power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us look he wants us to share his throne remember that's our that's our um mandate in in the loud of see in church age remember to sit with me in my Throne as I sit with my father in his his throne that's our mandate to sit there with him in the throne and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis look that he overcome and is sit down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him so now if you're going to sit with him you got to overcome what do you got to overcome you and the little temporary sufferings that we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that look will be revealed in us when he comes he is going to show let me tell you something he's going we think we might and people say well the bride looks bad the brides never look bad you're looking at the mixed multitude you're looking at the hinder Parts I'm looking at a bride that he promised us without spot and wrinkle he promised us the power would come back into church he promised us the gifts would come back into church he promised us that we'd See Fire Fall Out of Heaven he promised that right that we'd see the the pillar of fire we see it all the time but it's inside of us it's hid but it's not hid to me and you I'll promise you one thing if Satan's an angel of Light he can send you a Halo he can send you a light cuz he's the angel of Light remember but I'll promise you one thing if you're born again that pillow fires inside of you and he can't replicate that he can't do it he try his best but he cannot get born again he cannot have that Pillar of Fire in his soul like brother Chris was talking about the the that's what that was that burning bush that was the pillar of fire that's what came on day of Pentecost divided itself because it didn't have to divide itself it was talking to Moses it couldn't go into anybody didn't even go in Moses he said I'll be with you but he told us he'd be in us so that all pillar fire became 120 little licks and then 3,000 little licks and then he's been now into the millions and you and I when you get born again you get the same lick of fire all what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing well I'm just here I'm I I clocked in I wonder if some of you already clocked out what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation count it all joy when you fall into many Temptations statue of perfect man that's what we're supposed to do reflect the Son of God and now we're supposed to do his work he that believeth on me John 14:7 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also your beginning to reflect the works of Christ but so many of us try to do the works of Christ before look the reflection of Christ is in us now there's the trouble we find these things happening you know it I know it we see these stumbles along the road we find the scrap heap of Ministers of Christians piled along the road is because they didn't go into it right remember there's a time and a place for everything all right and you can be overzealous that's why I'm here this morning is to try to teach this little church what if you're overzealous that means you a't come to patience you're wanting and everybody's Wan we're wanting to do thing you know we're wanting to to to get better and and maybe try to work up some emotions every once in a while because most of you are dead but we're trying to get it where somebody at least say Amen somebody at least say praise the Lord hard sobody at least act like you want to be here but that's patience brother I'm going to read it here in just a minute brother BR said I've been 33 years in this pull pit he said you women still cut your hair you still do the things I tell you not to do Lula Church my daddy's been here 50 years and you're still doing things we're all still doing things that he told us not to do that's why we're not moving oh we're moving but we're not moving like we should we've got the word of God here people where you where you can't take a strand of memory out of your head and say we were taught wrong that's right we can't say oh we went through this Doctrine amen right we went through this error so it should be easier for us to approach god with the true word of God that we do have and maybe I am trying to push it a little bit but somebody needs to get alive trying to teach this little church and myself look brother R didn't he didn't discl he said bless God I'm all the way up here and I'm fixing to teach y that wasn't the prophet he said you and me how that we can become the dwelling place of the Living God how many you like to be that Dwelling Place of the Living God well there's things we have to do 2 Peter 3:9 says the Lord is not slack concerning his promises as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us were not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance you look at all down through the church ages you look at all seven Church ages and you see that that that all but the end where we're at he said he said I love you and I appreciate this that you're doing but read it I appreciate that you don't take the Deeds of nickol adans but you've suffered this woman Jezebel but you fell from your first love but you've done this and you've done that so don't think I'm a stand up here telling us you know telling us bad stuff God was telling them he said you fell away from your first love you quit doing this you suffered Jezebel you did these things but now remember the the very last one number seven that we're in he just rebuked the whole thing why we should know better bear long suffer long be longsuffering patiently enduring be of a long Spirit not to lose heart don't lose heart keep this thing going if even just a little bitty candle light that's right cuz if it's a candle out of God it's worth more than 10,000 worlds to persevere patiently and bravely and enduring what misfortunes and troubles to be patient in bearing the offenses and injuries of others to be mild and slow to punish brother R tells us faith alone won't do it let's just keep going down here elhad 1960 brother Bri said then Abraham we find out didn't obey God just right wait a minute he's father of our faith but he had errors he had things he had to deal with now he made ready and had faith in the promise but see we can still have faith in promise every person sitting in the sound of my voice right now all of you sitting here believe that God sent a prophet believe that what he brought us was the pure unadulterated word of God Amen and it came straight from the Bible and there's no discrepancy there's no error we have faith in that promise right and then not obey it still it'll hinder us I'm reading you what Prophet that you just said you believe said now you say I believe in the Holy Spirit I believe I should be baptized with the Holy Spirit now no no matter how much you believe you got to obey that commission yes sir what is the commission repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ with the mission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost there's your promise because this promise is given to us and all ages and all nationalities I guess you might save the whole world but look just faith alone won't work you got to obey that commission just faith alone won't work because faith without works is dead that's right just like the borderline Believers got people today you find in the Bible says for is impossible for those which are once enlightened and made partaker of the Holy Ghost to fall away to renew them themselves again into repentance seeing They Crucified to thems the Son of God AR fresh and count the blood of the Covenant where with he was Sanctified an Unholy thing and done despite to the The Works of Grace you know what they're saying they're saying is Well I ain't I ain't perfect and you ain't perfect I I I just I can't and I can't and I can't that's God there's no sacrifice for that there's a sacrifice for ignorance you know that right being ignorant is not knowing what you're doing so there's an offering for ignorance just like right now there's an offering for ignorance and it's patience an offering for ignorance is God's patience with me and you that we won't stay ignorant that we'll come to whatever we need to come to that we'll listen a little bit more study just a little bit more pray just a little bit more pray for things yes specific P specific specific pray that I can speak look watch this it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a living God and those people you've seen them come to church they'll come and they'll say oh yes I believe yes sir but they believe it but they'll never lay their hands to it to turn one wheel to help it go on we still believe this is a prophet right I'm not quoting Charles Stanley I'm quoting what brother Brown said in other words he sees this even in his own church they believe it but they'll never lay their hands to it to turn one wheel to help it go on and listen brother B ain't talking about well now I made four casseroles this past weekend and sister so and so just made too so I'm blessed more than she than she is if you can't cook you're not but that's what he's saying he's not he's not saying okay we like brother Dell always says pave the parking lot and pay for this and pay it's no it's doing this it's doing the promise of God it's doing what God said it's doing what God Said in the word of God now yes all that other peripheral that is so sweet and so nice and I appreciate you sisters and Men you do it without any reluctance you do it without any anything in you know malice in your heart but you can go to hell and still be doing that that's not what God requires he does not require that he requires that you as brother around said you you do the things that God said to do I'm sorry that was a little bit cutting but if you think works is going to get you there not only works alone is not going to do it even pay your ti is not going to get you in heaven it's an ordinance it's what you should do and you'll get a blessing because of it but it's not going to get you to heaven well now God just don't go over there and take a broom and sweep out the Canaanites and the amorites and the aites and all of them sweep them out and say come on in Israel this is yours they've even planted crops for you no sir they had to fight for every inch of the way every inch that we fight we got to fight for it that's right but they had the promise of Victory God told Joshua wherever The Souls of your foot tread that I have given you now remember they broke that promise through achin that promise was broken through aching cuz God told him you'll not lose one person in battle all of a sudden the first two or three battles was good and everything and all of a sudden they lost 12 or 14 men every how much that is in the Bible Joshua said hold on we've got an issue we got a problem we've got something in our camp that's not supposed to be here and you understand what happened aen stole the little or took the little garment and the wedge because that's not what God told him to do he said destroy it all get rid of it get rid of every one of them don't have any of that stuff in your house so Footprints means possession remember that sister in the wheelchair Footprints means possession every time the souls of your feet touch that's it that's why God had to go to hell that's why Jesus Christ went to hell his Footprints he overcame he took over in hell because his feet was there then he come back on Earth and took over here all power in heaven and Earth's been given unto me that stir my soul to know that that man's inside of us tonight he's in here he's not somewhere going well now wait a minute I'm just going to give you a little bit of me I ain't giving all of you no it's not what he said amen everywhere your feet touch take that much ground people fighting stuff like sister Freda get up stand on your feet put one foot forward and say cancer nope not this part depression not this part you're not going in this part of my house even your physical house walk through your F why do we why do we come up and and if you buy a new house what do we do sister Trudy what do we do we dedicate it we get into every piece of the house amen and we pray that God will be in that house that God will protect that house and we put prayer cloths in all different kind of places that's not Hocus Pocus I believe that works and I believe that we all maybe need a little checkup that's why I talking about uh having a marriage ceremony or we may have to try let's try to go home and and like brother R said get this out and get that out start with this one but physically we let things come in and what does it do it hinders our walk with God patience with what what kind of patience first thing is to have patience with God if you've got real genuine faith you'll have real genuine patience because Faith worketh patience Faith worketh patience When You When God says anything you believe it that's all you got patience how many of us believe in Salvation in the room today we everyone should believe in Salvation even those of you that don't want to raise your hand we believe in Salvation right all right now if we believe in Salvation then you believe in whatever God says that's what it's going to be you believe it that's all you've got patience I have patience for my kids you want your kids to be here yes I do I want them all sitting here and I want your sitting here Doo but we got to have patience that they'll come in the time that God sees that they'll come but it will reain they will [Applause] come why God said so when did he tell you that Noah 120 years ago he's not us live that long just cleat is heading there but 120 years years he believed in something though that had never happened see see we we build we we establish our faith listen to me a minute we established our faith on I know that brother Donnie was healed all right all right I know that brother George has salvation I know that sister Jun is going to be healed I and I've seen y'all be healed I've seen you come to repentance I've seen you being baptized with water and then baptized with the Holy Ghost seen that so I can build on that Noah had nothing the whole world was against him science was against him they might have had one of those telescopes that like Hubble or whatever it was and they could shoot that thing a million miles not one drop of water so Noah had to believe something that never happened before and he didn't believe it just for a few minutes he didn't believe it just for a few days he believed 120 years worth of it what's wrong with us we find out God come this far waiting for the church too look brother M said but it'll be there don't you worry he promised it that's why I said you got to plug yourself into that though you can't just say I'm the church and not do what the church says I don't mean the church I mean the Bible the Bible is the church church if it's the true church amen Isaiah 40 says hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord capital L O R D the creator of the ends of the Earth fth not neither is he weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases your strength that's a promise Lord I'm weak in my weakness he can be strong and help us to be that too even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary see that's impossible to a human being the fastest people in the world can only run so far so fast so long you can't run for days but you he's promised that you'll run this race and not be weary they shall walk cuz sometimes you can run right sometimes you got to walk walk by faith and faint not perseverance 1962 brother Brown said the trouble of it with we people were're in too much of a hurry it's just got to be done right now now listen he was living in a Crock poot age we're living in an ultra instapot Instagram insta this insta that microwave in 10 seconds is hot that's what we're living in now he wasn't living in that but he knew it was coming see that's what surprises a lot of people you take John Wesley his mother had what 17 kids wasn't it 17 kids or whatever more it was either him his wife or his mother and had to wash all 17 kids clothes didn't have a westing house washing machine she was the washing machine and she hung them out on the dryer out in the in the uh yard to Dy how many remember remember that praise the Lord some of us are still in our sanity you drive by and they look like Flags it be everybody's anyway but that's what she did it wasn't throw it in the dryer and 20 minutes later it's all fluffed it's all wrinkle-free and you just fold it up and put it in the in the closet she had to iron the clothes and she had enough time to stop and teach her kids about God yeah get quiet on me that's okay it hits all of us the trouble of it is we people were too much of a hurry it's just got to be done right now can't come back no more see when you get that in your mind you're going to lose it right there you're going on losing ground right there you have nothing to stand on you must be patient brother BR in an uncertain un certain sound now Noah being warned of God moved and prepared an ark we just talked about that and God said it's going to rain and it rained those who found a way of Escape took it those who didn't perish that same God said it'll rain fire is going to fall from Heaven and destroy this world and there was a way prepared for you those who will take it will escape it those who will not will perish The Sinner will perish with the sinful world but the redeemed will be Redeemed by the Holy Spirit and he's talking about Noah standing at the door remember telling people something that they did not even believe in they didn't know anything why is rain they probably didn't have rain in their dictionary brother John cuz they didn't know what it was the water was coming up out of the ground and it was you know watering everything up from the bcts underneath the ground cuz that's what collapsed when the water started raining down that's what collapsed to make all the water on the earth so everything they needed was right there so they didn't have to look up me and you nothing down here it's all got to be from up there don't look to the earth look to the heavens we should have patience with one another like I've tried to get this watch I've tried to get this message over at the Tabernacle to see that each member of the Tabernacle become this it's hard to do I've tried to have patience this is 33 years have patience women still Bob their hair still just the same but just have patience see just have patience wait you have to if you ain't got it don't try to build on this down here have patience Hebrews 12 ver1 says wherefore seeing will also are compassed with this great cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does easily beset us and let us what run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith listen we know the plan we know the plan more than Paul did we're in the end time he was in the first time but he could see it that we needed to make sure we run with patience the race that was set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God Matthew 10:22 says and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that what endureth he that endureth to the end shall be saved that word endureth means to remain abide not recede or flee not first time something happens first time somebody says something cross to you first time somebody looks at you different now or somebody gets on you steps on your toes don't recede or flee remain abide preserve look under misfortunes and trials hold fast to one's faith in Christ to end endure to Bear bravely and look calmly ill treatments the word end means means the end to which all things relate the aim or the purpose I told you about God what is a plan a plan is a method of achieving an end we're trying to achieve an end listen and God's going to have it doesn't matter you can sit here today and you can clam up and you can be a sire pus all you want to somebody's going to have the quickening power and going to take this thing and sweep it on I'm just dumb enough to believe it's me and you all right so get let's get out of this doldrum what let's get into what God's already give us and pray for what's coming that's right CU with God it can't be less it's got to be greater that you be not slothful but followers of them who through look who through faith and patience inherit the promises for when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear no greater swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so look so after he had patiently endured after Abraham waited 25 years he obtained the promise Luke 21:19 says in your patience possess you your soul It Is Well with My my soul when peace like a river extendeth my way when Sorrows like sees Bellows roll nevertheless What It Is Well with My Soul I have patience to believe that God's going to do what he said he do that's right so let's look at godliness just for a minute then we'll close godliness and the strong is holiness reverence and respect you would not you would not think that much but think just bear with me and I'll get to it it may be Sunday reverence and respect all right piety towards God Godly now look how can you have be piety towards God God is piy we're born in sin to be to have py towards God is to know what that is by that person being inside of me or being inside of you that's why brother rown said we'll read in just a minute he said you go all through this said but when you got to get up to the top you're getting some really good material second Timothy this is just kind of like what we read at Corinthians this is what Paul was dealing with he's dealing with it in Timothy he dealing in the Corinthians he comes among people he says for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful and Unholy without natural affection Lord Jesus we see that now more than ever we took a little survey today man June did and we gave some blood for a for a um uh a test or something they were doing about um stuff in the past anyway it said on that it says are you male or female but it said what did it say it said something about your birth sex were you born male or female do you identify that's right what do you identify as without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent you know what that means that means you can't keep your mouth shut Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form now that's a form you don't want but having a form of godliness but denying the power of that godliness if we don't come to Godliness and show the power of it you know what it is it's that right there you lose it a form but denying the power thereof power without character is satanic for of this sword are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women or churches or denominations or us if we're that part silly women Laden with sins LED away with many lust and in other words watching looking for everything else ever learning and ever able to come to the knowledge of the truth now let's read this again First Timothy and without controversy without us even having to argue about it great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh we know where he's at now though amen we know where he's at we don't have to go find him and there's no controversy that he's in a Bible or he's in a church or he's in Pope he's in Me and You by the new birth God was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles that's us believed on in the world and received up into Glory brother R says in the statute perfect man but if you got genuine Faith then put genuine virtue to it then genuine knowledge then genuine Tempest then genuine patience see you're moving right on up the line all right fifthly add godliness oh my godliness to be added what does godliness mean I looked in four or five dictionaries couldn't even find what it meant finally I was down at brother Jeff there and we found it in a dictionary godliness means to be like God oh my after you got faith virtue and knowledge Temperance patience then be like God you say I can't do that brother brandom oh yes you can let me just read you a few scriptures here in a minute Matthew 548 and let's see what Jesus said you are God's all the virtue all the things that's in God is in you do you believe that Matthew 5:48 be ye Jesus speaking into Beatitudes be therefore p e r f e c what's that perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect you got way up here now before you're asked to do that he didn't ask you to be like God at virtue you need to have strength before you can be like God then when you get up here he's asked you now to be perfect godliness Sons and Daughters of God that's right how many things could I say on that line then he turns let's turn to Ephesians 4 it's kind of a long quote but we'll finish right here on this let's turn to Ephesians four and find out here in the book of Ephesians it says about these things how what we should do four and 12 you know where he's going with this begin with the 12th verse all right let's begin up here at the 11th verse and he gave some Apostles and some prophets remember last night don't try to take the other man's office see and some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers forther perfecting of God does it read like that congregation says no the perfecting of what they said Saints who are the Saints the Sanctified ones not Sanctified before before you get born again this is Sanctified after you get born again right after me Born Again Chief which one wins he said the one I feed cuz I got one out here in my spirit realm that's a black dog but I've got one inside of me that's a white dog now there's a contrast now there's a fight going on it's not down in your soul right the Sanctified ones amen the ones started from down here perfecting of the Saints for the working of the ministry the ministry of Jesus Christ for the edifying of the Body for the edifying Build It Up edifying until till we all come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God and to the perfect man and to the Assurance to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ invisible Union watch what brother R said a man is born of God a Son of God look has to have the nature of God requirement all right you write that down underline it requirement you got to have the nature of God he has to be like God he honors God he is part of the word of God right and in this last days of this Bride Watch This bride taking form just exactly the same power that he was at the beginning has come up to these organizations and so forth and come out for the bride he can't be nothing else but that let's stand to our feet he can't be nothing else but that what the bride he can't be nothing else but the bride patience 30 something years he said he's been waiting somebody to say I see that you just come on I say I see that I I I want to be that I I I can't but now I can I've read where I couldn't by men out in the world I've read you know uh you ain't perfect and I ain't perfect but what have we done with reading of the word of God that never says now it tells you that there's a position that you got into by your first birth that you are not perfect but by your new birth it's made you as perfect as God is that's right so you got to let that out and let it go to working let it out it will work something is going to happen in this end time in a group of people but it's got to start with you as an individual saying it's me right it's me Lord it's me it's not it's not my neighbor it's not my wife it's not my pastor it's not my kids it's not my ministers it's me amen amen and we do all I can to help you but you're going to have to make the first move right you got to make the first move you got to make the first move and say God I'm done I'm finished I'm tired sick and tired of being sick and tired I don't want to be this way anymore well now if you re but see a lot of people just lip service if you really believe that then 6 months from now you shouldn't be able to say that again right everybody with me put the state down somewhere all right we you know people being baptized four five six times he's one day you can't just wash it all away from you right not with natural water you can't you got to come to a place and said I'm done I said that I ain't got to do that no more I ain't got to worry about not getting up and going to church I can't worry I'm not going to worry about not having time to study not having time to pray I'm not worry about that no more I'm not going to let X Y and Z take over anymore but the problem is we just keep same pit all the time over and over same stink same mess why that's why it's called a change he's changing you a little by little but you got to let him do it from inside you can't try to clean yourself up a pig is a pig you can take a pig and you can wash it up I've seen you know you see places you go to they have these U uh FFA things you know and they clean the pig up they clean it up and they put a big old ribbon on it and they think man this is this is number one Pig one hour later he tells you who he really is he's a pig cuz you look at him again you go he's in the mud well he's doing what a pig said to do but

lost right there brother Brown remember positive mental attitude brother Dell's always preached positive attitude positive confession positive promise there is nothing negative in God he's not oh oh is me God he's not I can't do it God this is just too much I can't do it he's never said that he's always had a provision he's always had a way for us to be healed or to be saved or or we we were talking this past weekend you know there's only one way you can't go to heaven one way and that's blaspheme the Holy Ghost and count it to be not cuz I read you a list of people that should be in [Music] Hell adulterers Liars thieves murderers and they won't enter in the state they're in here but when they get a change it's not a Salvation issue if you murder 34 people and you get saved and filled with the Holy Ghost wow you think no that's too much have we belittle God so much that you know you say and the reason I'm saying that is you say well my kids have done X long as you hang on to them you just keep hanging on to them I'm like brother Claude wisinger said he said look God he said I want my kids saved I don't care if it's the he he said give them one minute if they're dying give them one minute Lord to make a choice and let them make that choice Lord save my filthy soul and you know what he'll do he'll come down save them amen we let God handle that but you know what I don't deathbed confessions are just too close to the they're too close to the to the Finish Line okay let's get it now and not worry about it then when we go home if we have to go home by death we go home with a smile we go home with a wow is that what this is all about is that heaven this is like heaven to me this word of God to me this past weekend that was that was close enough to heaven to me down here on the earth the word of God was preached it was some good Fellowship good friendship and we we had a good time together and we had a good time around the word of God first put the word first put
