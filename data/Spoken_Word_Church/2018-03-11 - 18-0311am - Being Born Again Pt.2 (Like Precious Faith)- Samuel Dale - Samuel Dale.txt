your light shine in our hearts forgive our sins cleanse us from all unrighteousness and may we walk in the light of your love in Jesus name Amen I guess you noticed when you came up today that we have red doors now coming up so you know we opened the door to make them read that's when and he's always wanted red doors so we got that done and then and nany and Terrence and Lisa came up yesterday and we've got everything pretty well back together but the whole thing is painted all the starway overhead and the things and it it's you know looking good so that way we we can at least handle that it's been quite a while since it's been painted but we think the Lord for all it's helped and done and you know you doing those thing okay first Peter 1:18 for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's in other words you you there was no redemption under that point that they kept it to that and did not go on to Christ alright but your what now you redeemed but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot overly was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him to believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God seeing you how purifies your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which about us liveth and abideth forever huh yeah trying to get started if we can on to the message of the statue of a perfect man so we'll read from 2nd Peter 1 all right now we're not going to get in through the virtues and the thing we're going to enter it as we have from the other start at the foundation and move upward and go through as we're doing I said Simon Peter servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power hath given unto all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we're going to try to move in we spent a lot of time covering the Old Testament and the people and they're there what took place but always remember one thing that our thought has always been that whatever you start with is what you must end up with further advance yes you know but you you can't start off my whole saying is you you can't start off in Genesis with a white dog and wind up in the Book of Revelations with a black dog even though you still got a dog it won't work it's got to be the same all the way other than just an unfolding our being made manifest what was started you know in the beginning so salvation started as we covered Wednesday night salvation started with the basis of Adam and Eve you know God had them the way he wanted them had they remind and no sin entered the picture then we would have come forth as they were and Adam and Eve had eternal life in their soul they I say it because and a lot of people don't bleed no I don't believe that but according to brother Branham and blasphemous names he said that was what took place when God breathed into their nostrils see there was no sin back there so then he could breathe eternal life into their nostrils because that's the way he started his people all right as us emphasizing Wednesday night as he started it it was the way he wants to end it which it means what so then on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came it gave eternal life to the souls of the people there in the upper room all right it did not pay the whole price or do the whole point of redeeming the body or the spirit it was just that soul that was made eternal by the new birth or not then in that he started his church on the day of Pentecost think his people okay same his atom same as he with eternal life and soul the yet body and spirit not finished alright so then as he started out and as I we tried to cover see then Adam and Eve fell from the position that they were first granted they never lost their eternal life in their soul they lost the right of the Tree of Life right they could have went to the Tree of Life and and been made eternal in body and spirit had they stayed with it but the fall took that part into being all right so you start on the day of Pentecost with eternal life into the souls of mankind but then before God could come forth and manifest himself in the way he wanted you see the church falling away until it came down to the position that they they did not lose their eternal life in their soul no but they lost the revelation of God's Word they lost the tree of knowledge I mean the tree of life took of the tree of knowledge and as they did it deteriorated down to were that you come in to one of the dark ages and the things happening all right and then you see the loser starting out Wesley's coming forth then you see Pentecost coming in with justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost bringing them in to eternal life the well I always said because I don't want people to think the wrong thing Martin Luther had eternal life in his soul but he's in the body of Christ and the only way you can get in the body of Christ is to have eternal life you may not have manifested so much as to justification sanctification emphasis on a lot of that but it still you've got to go through it because Martin Luther surely repented of his sins right surely he accepted Jesus Christ all right surely he come to a sanctified state in his life he may have had still a lot of other Riccardi wouldn't the age or the time to bring but he still had it West we had the new birth for their day they had those times all right then we come back to the point of bringing the new birth I mean we come to the point of the new birth at their pinnacle and then in the end time when you're coming back to on Zeus's Street you're coming back to that Holy Ghost coming in to people all right and see then that was still not enough that's where brother I'm told the Pentecostals he said that's where you messed up he said cause you thought you got everything dark and he said no you just got the birth you just got born again you just got into the body we said now you need to progress on so now you will see the stature of a perfect man is that message of growth development as we proceed into it all right but we want to stay now right on that basis of faith because we've covered that in the Old Testament faith was to believe God right in the Old Testament they believed God they accepted God as to what was taking place and believed him and followed it and they had faith in God all right so truly you can see that he's as he started the church on the day of Pentecost you know it would be back to what it was now I've covered this over and over to give just a little bit where it won't get lost the bread around him will say he said I met people that had the baptism of the holy ghost just like the day of Pentecost then he turns around and calls them babies right so then you got to remember on the day of Pentecost you've got a split condition it took place you got a hundred and twenty in the Upper Room that at least a few of them had to work planning that's up to God how many that was in that 120 but that's you know I believe Mary was there don't you I believe a lot of them was down in the upper room to receive that new birth all right now then that put them at a certain position in Christ and made them the forefathers are the beginning are the faith of the fathers as we call it put them in a great position that around center disciples had these virtues but he said they did not have the headstone he said cause it hadn't come yet now we stay playing on that point all right but see they had been tutored and trained for three and a half years and when the Holy Ghost fell it could put them in a greater depth because you're gonna have to have God didn't use novices to write his word or bring the New Testament into being alright so he brought his children grown grown up in the Lord for three and a half years he tutored him but then the 3,000 outside only heard one master and when they heard that one message they were born again it could not put them in the pyramid to where the disciples were but it put him in the pyramid and put him in the body of Christ go that is the pyramid all right see then you can see brother branham's right when he would say he met people with the Holy Ghost just like the day of Pentecost you wouldn't probably necessarily necessarily referring to the Apostles and their doctrine because like I said he turn on call them babies but on the day of Pentecost you had that split condition that's always helped me to understand God in his ways to remember this group for three and a half years this group only heard one message you can't put them on the day of Pentecost through the three thousand you put them at them new arts of faith we'll get to it but you don't bring them wound up in here where the faith of the Father that's where the growth development comes in that's what the statue of a perfect man was written for that's what Peters talking about they're trying to tell people how to come to where he was is that sensible there comes a great Apostle Paul he was standing at that place cuz he didn't have to go with a disciple he went to the backside of desert and God brought him you know remember Paul was a prophet so you got it you got to have those lines but all right now remember that and don't forget it then when we say something don't go well I don't want this gold is enough just remember what I'm sayin the disciples had heard the word and the Holy Ghost can quicken only the word you've hailed as you've received it and that's the scripture says they understood it the parables it says they kept it all right and there's one more something but they held it they kept it they understood it all right they knew those things they knew there was no tourists regards they now know thoughts of two or three guards back there but they did how to teach the others so that's what Peter's we'll get back to it in the message Peter is telling the people then are already born again we'll get to that he's telling them how to come to where he was that and here comes brother on him with a new birth right and then what opens the word and what does he teach the Statue of perfume and to do what to shorten how to get work he was which he was back where the disciples were like I said Paul never went with Peter and them and and learned it from this he went to the backside of the desert with God but a random didn't how Peter them to he had to read the word yes but he didn't have them to teach him as that but he went to the backside of the desert and come out of it with a statue of a perfect man all right but just remember he's the one that said it I did he said it took him 30 some years to be able to preach that one message he said well he knowed all that he said that I just got the other day I learned the woods how this ties in with something like don't preach on all right we'll get to that as we go along okay and try to do and that way don't lose it then cause God ain't gonna put Martin Luther even though he was a messenger to the age God never had him to write no Bible John Wesley was a great man but God didn't have him to write no Bible Zeus's Street were great people great men come down through there great things took place but God never allowed them to write a Bible now he didn't now brother branham to write a Bible but he allowed him to what to give us the understanding of the Bible right they could get a little bit for each age they could get so much for their time but they couldn't get the fullness it had to wait until the Prophet came so we're writing the line of the message right all right but now listen see we've tried to cover so keep that in mind then if you have any problems about it just come back to that thought that you got 120 upper room heard the word live with the word for three and a half years a lot of new but then the others just heard one message so when brother Allen said he met people with all the ghosts just like the damn penny College well you got the two powers from today at Pentecost because you'd say well I don't believe that people got the Holy Ghost like them apostles they don't have to get it like the Apostles all they got to do is get the born-again experience under their Pentecostal faith and they're in the body of Christ because it only one faith one Lord one baptism or all right now how many times we went over this so you can't have see somebody if the Prophet would say being contrary to the word but claim the same Holy Ghost come on then Paul had this constantly get onto those that corrupt it's the Corinthians there's really that's called the book of Corrections and he took him to books not that's what it was was correcting those people well cause there's babies What did he say about it he says you your babies you desire the sincere milk of the word but he said we need to get to a place that we can eat some made he said in other words we need to get to the places if we can eat were the apostles we're eating all right so keep that in your mind now as we go along and you won't get lost in the thought all right now we drop back to the day all right so we've been covering that you must be born again all right we've covered over and over that the born to get experience the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost is all one in the same because your mind don't let you think see you can you can look at a bird kind of like and you can can look at a born-again experience but then your your mind goes up into the skies to think of a baptism coming down did it come down learn the Upper Room I thought the liquefier sitting on each one I thought that was the new birth I thought that was God dividing himself I thought that's what the prophet said I thought that's what we were to understand by reading the Bible itself that that liquefier was the part of the pillar fire divided out among the people innocent I believe that's always half so I'll go ahead and say it I believe anybody this ever received a new birth get that lick of fire if you get the new bar you get to lick of fire all right you might not be able to show it too much but you get to lick a fire why because it's a part of God's life right all right now so then by being born again doesn't mean that we do this and then there's something great anointing comes down that's great let God do what he wants to when he does it but just remember what I'm stating when that three thousand outside with it some great big thing that took place why didn't the rest of the world see it 3,000 receive the Holy Ghost why didn't the world see it because they didn't know what was going on sure a sound of a rushing mighty wind your ID would just remember the rushing mighty wind is not always the Holy Ghost itself because remember it can't anoint anointed one and that's not the new birth so the new birth is the birth of the word that's what we've drove I have ever since I've been in this message and heard what brother around him said to me that's the most simple thing that there is it's the birth of the word it's all of what Jesus preached in those parables and all those things through the Gospels and then the Holy Ghost came and made alive what those disciples hail within their heart there's a new birth what is it your birthday you said well brother Dale I believe one starts one leads out to this one goes that go and do what you want to I don't have time to fool with that I'm just gonna stay like it is okay now get what we're talking about then what makes the word alive is for the Holy Ghost to quicken that word that you heard is that true come on is that what the Prophet said that God laid down his word one word original seed and the Holy Ghost irrigated the word all right now are you listening see you heard the word right you go through repentance accepting Jesus Christ you go through sanctification cleanse and setting your side through justification of sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the quickening of the word that's within you is that right why do you always want the sound of the rushing mighty wind when the Prophet in the cave wasn't listening to none of that but when that still small voice spoke he came out Nordic ones how that mighty rushing wind come on and now listen so what is the new birth it's the birth of the word that you have held it's what the disciples done they held that word and when the Spirit came down to quicken it so it was inside of them the quickening was inside of them the word was in them is that true so if the word was in them so then the Holy Spirit would be quickening the word it's inside so the whole work is inside of you there's the mystery that your prophet would say receive the baptism when the Holy Ghost without a sensation but he never talked I want you short to me a receiving the baptism when the Holy Ghost without an experience a lot of difference in the word experience and a sensation sensations can deal with anointed ones experience is something you lived through all right now then what did we what was we talking about Wednesday night then from one paragraph 161 of the spoken word original see he said to be born of the word of spirit you could pull that note you want to start that's number two because we'll use it I just want to make sure one thing I don't care for it doesn't bother me to repeat anything that don't bother me at all if you get tired of it if you get tired of hearing the same over same thing over and over you don't have it I've heard water baptism but I ran him explain it hadn't you heard him explaining water baptism over and over and over you know what I still love to hear him explain he's never got all germane didn't if you say well well I bet if this got old to you they something wrong with you if you don't know that listen all of God's sons must be the same yes sir to be born to the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3 now what's John 3 to Jesus you must be born again right now what to be born to the water and the spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again unto the place of where you should have been at the beginning what was in the beginning the quickening of the word would bring you back to the like in the beginning what was in the beginning Adam with eternal life right body and spirit not eternal would eternal life in his soul so then the word spirit brings you right back to that you realize that new birth put you in the place of where Adam was now here's the only part split the condition again Adam had authority that's the part we need the birth yes we have the birth if you're born again you have the birth that don't mean you how the stature of a perfect man I don't agree with the people that say I got it all when I believe I got it one of those people that believe it I talked with her they said we get all these virtues when we're born again now I don't believe that I believe when your new birth is finality and finished maybe that's what they're talking about but that was certainly not the way they explained it because one brother said they got he got everything when he believed the other one said you ain't got nothing yet and that's what I told him I said you two brothers mind if I stay in between cuz I believe I've got something but ain't got what I need Oh they'd lead what look he brings you right back again to the place where you should have been at the beginning see that's the reason of Christ's death bringing us right back again to work brings right back to work sons of God was not Adam a son of God you see then what we're trying to get in trying to move on with what is the new birth in brother Branham then we that he's he's making it like we could make the question if we was there you know what is the new birth he's stating it like coming from you to him and that's good he said what is the new birth brother branham well what is the new birth it's revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you now that's what I remember I listen yesterday evening to Wednesday night's message I like to listen to see where it's lined it were to start back over in a listen what is the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you well brother Dale when I got the Holy Ghost I didn't get known you I didn't get no revelation hmm see you you you don't listen when you went to the altar why did you go now come on you know what brother Brennan says you know what he's talking about he said don't get them people and drag him to the altar now what did he say he said you get to people and drag them to the altar ah he said you'll make him twofold child of Rome he's had cause it's hard to get him to come the second time he said leave him alone let him come themselves but that's what they done with me my sister come to me my brother and all got killed in a car wreck I was 18 years old and she come to me and she said Sam you need to go the altar since Jesse didn't have a time to repent but you do I miss honestly I can't believe I don't know where the man was from what he was but he was a better man than she was a woman I don't mind saying it to me he was more christian-like than she was but yet she was trying to lead me to the altar see that was a hindrance the hindrance was the Deacons and things that was having problems but yet they wanted to lead you to Christ that was a hindrance okay you never worked well okay but what is it but I never received a revelation so you don't know what you're talking about did not something call you did not something deal with you to come to the altar well then there's your God revealing to you that you need to be saved and then if you did get saved he would be quickening the words you had see this one said you try to preach to people and they're so revelation until I have no common sense or either so no common sense and and got all this willing that claim revelation and no common sense that's how simple it is but yes you can miss it by not being tall you see what brother Branham was saying the Holy Ghost is so this talk see we're taught you got to do this you got to do that speaking tongue shout cry do this do that it's not to have it's accepting Jesus Christ as your Savior and them here then him accepting you there's the key you could go all your life except in him unquote brother branham I'm looking at this morning you can go all your life accepting Christ wind up in the end of it and find out you didn't have him because there was something wrong listen I'm quoting him he said they something wrong with your believing something being wrong with your believing you're sitting there thinking you're right many times about told you I'll tell you one more time I'd rather be all of my life crying out before God asking him to save me and guide me and keep me and get on at the end of the road and find out I've had it all along instead of not crying out for him because I I got it when I believe that's God you can't tell me you tell me I'd say cuz I got what you gonna do to get down the road in the road and then you got it you never find a person I have it I've tried to study the Bible from this rim and brother branham you know watching him him from whatever of the tapes and the things we could follow I've never seen a real Christian it wasn't crying out for God it's in the stature of a perfect man but a Renault said the oldest one here a brother and sister kid he said but what would be the thoughts that they want he said how to serve God the only this blessed God I got this nothing you know that doning encouraged me none so whatsoever what is the new birth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not you join the church you shook a hand you've done something different you said a Creed all of those things goes with it no Gentiles what Gentiles are not supposed to have the basis of laying on hands right because they're supposed to believe the word but did brother Branham take it out or did he say we still lay hands on the sick he said we still do it you know why cause it's part of the word did he ever do away with shouting crying speaking in tongue come on did he ever do away with him thought no he said get born again and then let God do what he wants to he said just remember one time he said remember when you come back down that you can walk a straight line you can get up all into the heavenlies when you come back down what did we cover now Wednesday night what do we cover it over and over the new birth is Christ revealed personally to you in other words the words you've heard has been made alive in your soul there's your new birth okay then what did we cover from Patmos vision we've covered it over and over and over you can only be saved by revelation you can only be saved by revelation you know what I didn't write the book have I become your enemy because I found it in the message let's go down thought I still think that I shout a crying I think that ain't nobody said a word about your shouting and crying as long as an aftereffect the baby comes it will cry after it gets here right come on then now what do we get down talking to you cannot be saved without a revelation you can't be saved without a revelation let's see you're looking at it I keep feeling that point they don't understand the revelation why don't you understand the revelation I tried to make it so simple God speaks to your heart and calls you and tells you you need to come and be saved right and you accept that call and you answer that call and you accept him as your Savior and it gives you the new birth it's that simple I put a whole message or two in the basis of what we've never we we haven't been taught down through time come we didn't come through some of you come to the Pentecostal churches and I and you knew that you had to be justified sanctified filled with all to go less bad just got it all one or bleed what the rest of Ian's do you know ain't no joking about it I'm just telling the truth we were never taught you needed to read to do other than repent and accept Jesus Christ we were never called that's why this message is so strong change we were never called that you need to be justified sanctified before you can be filled with the Holy Ghost that's got it when a blue will see your Baptist because there's not enough there for you to believe all right come on but if revelation faith faith is a revelation to you and if you have received the new birth you've got a revelation in that faith you accepted Jesus Christ he accepted you come on it may take a while for it to go on and you don't want to use the word growth because that'll be for later but it is that too but for you to repent of your sins and then you seek God and keep on seeking God and you come to her power with speaking of a daily sanctification even after you're born again let alone come into it we should never stop seeking God what are these seeking for guiding with that attitude you don't have it that plain enough with that attitude and that response you don't have it because you say like the color lady ain't what it used to be ain't Wonder Woman I ain't what I want to be ought to be but ain't what he used to be around said she come from somewhere huh she'd had an experience yes okay because remember what we got to Wednesday night talking about a revelation you cannot have a revelation without it being faith ice off the rapture faith is something that you've been that's been revealed to you which you can't tell nobody else you can try it explain your salvation to somebody but they didn't experience what you experienced maybe in another way they didn't won't ever understand they didn't experience right that so they're it's not to the image to you all right what did we get to that what we were talking about Wednesday that I want to go over and over that wrote about him on the message how faith in God he says to have an experience it must be a substance gives your salvation a substance or it is a mythology or a thought you know just something you believe or is it real is God real to you now let me ask you this way it's God more real to you after you've heard the message of the Prophet explaining God and how really is but yet how simple it is or do we still have the same thing that we believed in God I believed in God when I was in the Baptist Church and so God move and things happen didn't you before you ever heard of the message we see a distance that winds did not but rather says to have an experience it must be a substance because of substance Hebrews 11:1 is what the substance faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen see it's the substance because it's an evidence and that's what I asked question right is your substance and evidence is that your evidence see then why was all the evidences tongue speaking crying shout and all and what did the Prophet say your evidence of the holy ghost whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word if it don't agree with it then we're yeah that's that should solve a problem you know what I've always said to you know I always believed it you know how I check a doctrine well I go through the mission well that's good and that's fine I'll go through the bottle but how do you know how do you check a doctrine no we're not two Pentecostals you know look II and I you know I've heard y'all tell about it you know they they try to discern your spirit you know look you in the eye you know to see if I know you know the way I check a doctrine to see if it's right by my own experience but what if your experience is wrong well it's done pretty good so far I've got a decent batting average out of it I mean that's that still don't mean it's right but it's I still take what I believe instead of the others trooper natural SuperDuper great revelations in nine you see if something with inside of me says and then wait a minute that just say in the words you know that to Lourdes what if there's two lords that means these two gods or something this someone says that's not right they just don't you says that ain't right because it won't compare with my experience why can't you do that what are you ii by what do you check a false doctrine bah when I get into the message that's wonderful great cuz you know that's what I do but the first is to look at it and see what it's saying is that bringing forth two gods is the people that are preaching that Jesus wasn't God till the River Jordan is that two God's within you want to say well that ain't right but brethren said that but he also said that he was born God now then where you go you said but you don't understand brother so-and-so I never heard him say you don't listen like you're not listening now you're sitting there trying to figure it out and refute it instead of listening what say it I've read the quotes right here from brother branham then we read around and says Jesus wouldn't God to a river Jordan that's a quote now what's he saying is he saying what you're reading is he's saying what you're reading then we better find us another prophet cuz if he can't keep the Godhead straight so he's not saying what you think he said yeah he wasn't the fullness of God until the River Jordan Helen I can quote - I've quoted these to the in random tree he never became The Anointed Messiah until the River Jordan spread around the word but he was born the Messiah he was born the Anointed One but when it comes to the River Jordan he entered this ministry come on why don't you do it like that thing is your faith and your experience one in the Sun is your faith in your experience one of the Sun you know are of this side which is a revelation of Jesus cry personally to you see if it is then your evidence is a substance then I'll get off of that but just remember one more time speaking in tongues out and crying and all those things we believe in it we believe in that doing that whatever one of them Satan can impersonate he can impersonate everything you put in that room but he cannot impersonate the revealed word because remember what the Prophet said he can't bring it word by word look like that's one thing he could do don't you can't do it word by word knows you'll walk off somewhere all right then what are we getting to then if it's true say that for your point if it's true that you cannot be born again without a faith how's that faith is your born-again experience you can't be saved without faith what's your prophet said all right now we'll pick up I'm starting the message today go to number eight you see we jump a long way this is off the message earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the son why brother it's my faith you're saved it's my faith you're saved is that right listen in accepting of your faith and accepting of your faith God confirms your faith by the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you say you believe and don't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you do not what's he saying something wrong your faith isn't accepted it's not accepted right if you don't get the Holy Ghost you say up do you believe and you don't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in you do not know it's dropping it your faith isn't accepted in the side of God you've got a mental faith in the stead of a heart faith that's right when you truly believe God gods under obligation to pour the Holy Ghost on you and then if he does pour the Holy Ghost on you you say well I got the Holy Ghost well if you do you're bound to believe in the supernatural signs and wonders because you're added to it that's the faith you and your faith becomes one so if you say you I believe but I didn't get the Holy Ghost well you believe in it's not right I didn't say that now you could talk to the Prophet okay now listen cuz what's our problem are you listening now but listen in accepting of your faith God confirms your faith by the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you say you believe and don't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you do not your faith isn't accepted in the side of God you've got a mental faith instead of a heart faith because God's under obligation to keep his word now what's wrong with us then go ahead to number nine this is taken from blasphemous names okay so now listen 145 you know come on there you go so what does he say paragraph 143 the biggest part of our faith is mental faith by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God now I watch this is one I love but if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this there it is a godly spiritual faith the church I've taught this 4050 years they don't close because brother mol preached statue of perfect plan 19 in 71 and so that would come right into there I'm just making a point a statement and believing that one time when you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior he accepts your faith he brings you into the body across now look listen are you listening for a second what did he just say this will come on over in the statute of perfect man once we start through with the virtues in time but I'm trying to get you to stay right at the point to listen What did he say by hearing the word it brings us to a mental recognition of God so are out there on the internet I'm southern so mental it mental to me you know but if this our mental faith something's got to happen to our mental faith in other words God accepts us and then he imparts unto us he turned a life which is the faith to make the word alive that you've heard now listen but if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this so you got something up here you got something evidently down here okay if it ever strike see if there's you godly faith accordingly spiritual faith what does that do that faith recognizes only the word no matter what anybody else says it only recognizes the word because in the beginning was the word word with garden word was God and the word is still God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental faith becomes a spiritual revelation now keep that thought in mind because it's going to be ever virtue is going to be sealed into the other one but I want you to look at the pyramid and think about what your prophet just say something coming from above that's why I've always talked to you I've taught it from the beginning I still teach it did your soul is your theophany no might be out knees up in heaven hey I love it there's your positive yours the beginning the day you receive the new birth butter brown said you heard he didn't use the word new birth but he says you heard from your theophan the day you receive the new birth right here that God accepted your faith you started a pool upward and it's gonna pull us into the headstone don't break that connection that's why I've always said I know I'm carnal but that's alright just don't bring that headstone down you can't do it it would sit here and you be off leave it where it's at and just let that Holy Ghost fill in the sides [Music] let him fill in the sides you don't have to bring it down you bring it down it won't fit it'd be sitting like this leave it works out let it draw you let it pull you so you know what you heard from the positive of God's mind that he had of you before the world that had begun it drugs you through justification through sanctification and when the baptism of the Holy Ghost strikes it gives you faith the faith of God it's pulling you all the time right in the beginning watch them not upon the mental conceptions Church join him okay back up and upon this foundation I'll build my church those found at his church to build on faith right see not a fundamental conception of Church joining mental conception of that wood upon the revelation when them streams of grace has poured into that mental faith that you got did upon this a spiritual revelation I'll build my church and the gates of Hell can't prevail against it see that shows you would be that shows they would be against it would it'll never prevail oh what a glorious thing now see the faith just by strength you remember the sister Shepherd we'll get back to that in a statue of perfect man because this headstone was missing and the Holy Spirit the angel was pouring the message in and it was running down what about it you know we could be a little closer than we think then that was number one where did we get to 145 okay go ahead one more go ahead number ten it's in the same message and that was number one number one coming to you your mental faith right here what's that number one coming to you your mental faith right here comes the Holy Spirit coming down into your mental fate making it a spiritual faith then the spiritual faith only recognizes the word the day you receive the new birth there's a pool leading you upward right that's the positive of God's mind it's drawing us to that place listen number two number three then you have spiritual you'll have the holy spirit and we'll seal all these things into you as that Holy Spirit covers it from your faith up to the Holy Spirit seals you in with Christ and you become one we get back on those don't worry about it but did you catch what I'm saying just a little point when the day you got born again someone started drawing you now brother branham is the one that called it he says a sinner has a soul everybody has a soul right cuz that's the difference that's an animal and even if you're lost your soul will carry you somewhere when you die because it is your theophany no you got Itoh no I got the prophets message ain't gonna argue you the Prophet said the sinner has a theophany hey man but that's not an eternal body right now that's a soul he's on his way to hell and that's the way you when I was until we got the new Berto and when you get the new birth you start your upward pull now your soul is your theophany and there's the positive of your theophany right here this is the partial realization or earnest are being born again let me get something in a hurry so then go to number 11 we'll let's pick up part of it and let's read this Peter and then we'll stop in just a minute because listen we're not gonna get on down because here we're just gonna stop here but we got Simon Peter servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ goes on talking about being taken away you know getting bringing it on the things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him Peter is addressing that message to those that are in Christ Jesus I got the rest of to read so there's hope those of like precious faith what is like precious faith brother branham go ahead and start on number 12 just remember what you're saying to them that have obtained like precious faith the Bible the Bible is not written to a sinner it is written to those that are in Christ Jesus it is only a condemnation for the sinner it is not written to the sinner the Bible is

see the world we've escaped that now he's addressing this to the church that's why we're here this morning is to find out what is the way what is God's requirement there's not a person in here he talks about the system kidding and wouldn't want watch your heart's desire to be closer to God when you learn a Christ there's something about him that's so loving you just try to get right into him the Bible is not written to the sinner it could only tell him he's lost it's written to those that are in Christ Jesus the statue of a perfect man Peter's saying I just read it to you he said I've got this faith and he said I'm addressing this to them that have that faith but remember now he's got a hound more than this faith he's right here we'll get back to it he's right here but telling us how

precious faith go ahead with number 13 all the days of our life 19 and 59 612 hold it on that where we know he's how much the bonds slaves and the shackles and the time the world that I could become a slave to Jesus Christ to serve him in the love and you my brethren and sisters who are like precious faith he's talking to those with like precious faith which is the new birth who were like precious faith who's been born of the Holy Ghost this had the blood of Jesus Christ to sanctify and cleanse you from all the filth of the world that died daily to the flesh crucifying it putting it away and becoming a slave to your own body to serve God we look for a city to come blessed be the Lord like precious faith he was not addressing this to the world he was addressing it to them that had the same faith he had he's addressing it to them with the same faith I didn't choose to keep all of these I'll just read this is beginning into the Gentile Instrumentation brothers of like precious faith believe in now he's talking about the people at CERN believe in just what the scripture says is truth Azusa Messi's Azusa I'm so happy today to have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and be a fellow worshipper of like precious faith as you all stand for today bringing these two just show you what he's talking about precious like precious faith as to those that are born again only thing is purposed for is for that to find brethren of like precious faith it certainly thrills my heart because the even is is coming in the shadows of the day of for spent the Great Commission fellow citizens of the kingdom of God brothers and sisters of like precious faith what are you doing I'm showing you that when he's talking about like precious faith he's talking about born-again believers those that are in the body of Christ I just know what I would do if I don't know what I'd do if I wasn't a Christian he said to have the association with Christians and a people of like precious faith who believe in God and are trusting him and believe in the same glorious day will be over the Battle of be over and you my brothers and sisters who are like precious faith who's been born of the Holy Ghost your denomination now this is different messages home they've taken time to give you the title you can look it up your denomination fine but Christ is your center when you do that all men is your brethren that's like precious faith that believe in God like to fellowship together with brethren of like precious faith we'd be glad to fellowship with one another he tell about when communism

spirit we're all baptized into that body and our members and fellow citizens of the kingdom of God and brethren and sisters of like precious faith I want to thank this fine group of brethren back here this afternoon for this great minister of representation brothers of like precious faith who stand for the same gospel that we've preached Paul said he didn't find any inner city only Timothy that was like precious faith that he had though Timothy had like precious faith and brother green God has sent him in here and opened us up a church of like precious faith that we believe like precious faith to those that are born again born again believers all have like precious faith they might not have the same understanding I got one in here he said no matter where you riding the two-hump camel or one hump camel he said long as you ride in the camel all right the message of the statue of a perfect man is not addressed to the world it's not even addressed to try to tell you how to become a Christian I'm talking about getting born again it's addressed to those that are already born again then Peter is telling us to how to come to work he's at the like precious faith that we start with the new birth we all start with the baptism of the holy ghost faith brother Brown says you can't be born again without having faith so if you read the message of the statue of a perfect man I'd ask you go back and read it again trying to get you to see what faith really is faith is a revelation from God like come on musician it's a revelation from God just telling us about God faith we'll get to it we're brethren says you're born again at faith and he says you can't be born again without having faith so then remember the point he's addressing this to those not of the world he said addressing it to those that are in Christ Jesus those with like precious faith then he says and that's why I love it - it is then he says add to your faith people don't even read that add to your faith but it don't say add to your virtue it's this add virtual add knowledge - Templar the only one that says add to your faith is a beginning you add to your faith virtue yep but remember for their own it's not you it starts with you at faith your faith has been accepted it's your faith in God that has brought him on the scene and he quickens that word to you it's your faith because faith now I'm saying this way ahead of time faith is not an ADD faith is a verb every one of these virtues will to read to brother branham they're all added to your faith they're added to your faith now I'll give you one drew you to studied all you want to the Prophet said they 7 adds right one two three four five six seven eight I brought a random where did you mess up these eight things which is only seven is this is not an ad this is a birth then you add virtue you add knowledge you have temperance you had patience now you've got seven adds but you got eight virtues things really faith is not a virtue as of Earth this team think on these things see what the prophet has said is right what he says is right we've got to get it in the right blood to understand it go ahead anybody how I need I was [Music] and he have an
