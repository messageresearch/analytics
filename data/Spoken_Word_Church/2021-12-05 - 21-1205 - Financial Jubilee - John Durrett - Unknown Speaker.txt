If God gives us things to do, and gives us money, and makes us the richest nation under the heavens, then God's going to ask what did we do with it. Why do we spend our money for things that satisfies not? Not only to a nation, but that'll be to individuals….

Principle 1:  God Owns it All: The 10% Tithes are his and the 90% is his-entrusted to you. (we don’t waste our money, we waste his money). 

Principle 2:  Manage his resources “Diligently.”  Get organized. The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute. Proverbs 12:24   

Principle 3: Money is Time . You purchase “stuff” with your time.  Don’t swap any portion of your allotted time on earth for useless “stuff.”

Principle 5: Avoid debt like a curse.  The worlds tells you that we deserve to have it, but as Christian we don’t deserve debt. The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.. Prov 10:22  

Principle 6:  “Winter is coming” Save a little!  Don't spend all that comes i...
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
praise the lord god bless you all see that's a good way to get started i am having trouble connecting um so y'all pray for me praise the lord jesus yeah i'm not sure why i'm up here i think i got tricked into it especially when i look out and i see our brother bob out there and you know and certainly brother dale being here my goodness i was tricked so y'all pray for me certainly not a um not a minister for sure so you can lower your expectations to begin with but certainly you know being a christian that certainly means that i have experiences of god changing my life for sure that's number one and certainly life experiences as well you know growing up in this this message has certainly been experiences that i've had and lord just put on my heart to share something related to some of the experiences that i had since i became a christian so i'm certainly honored i don't take it for granted to to be up in front of the bride of christ it's it's a real privilege to to be here standing in front of you and i wanted to take a topic today something that you know we we deal with every time every day something that we all have experience with i am sure something we talk about i'm sure every day something you deal with every day something we talk about and pray about it every service and it's money money so it's very real you work for it you live for it just try to save it you certainly spend it you borrow it you try to invest it you know different languages have different terms that they use moolah doe you can go on and on money so it's a real thing but i want to talk about what financial jubilee and um you know what jubilee if you look at the the hebrew word for jubilee we know that it's freedom we know that as a celebration a time of jubilee but you believe really the hebrew word for that is the trumpet the rams horn that was used to announce the jubilee so that jubilee is really a trumpet and there's a quote from brother breton he says when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free it was a choice that you had to make if you wanted to go free and that's very very important because that choice comes down to us and you would ask why would someone not want to go free i mean that seems very easy if i said you can go free say i want to go free but freedom comes with a cost so slavery if you think about slavery at those times why would someone not want to go free well it's work it's hard it's difficult we get used to certain things we get comfortable so financially we can be comfortable in our current society where it's based on you borrow you go in debt you you do what you have to do really to get by but you get satisfied you get used to it as the norm it just becomes standard this is the way we live but when that trumpet sounds you can go free if you want to go free but it's work it's hard it's difficult but there's freedom and that's what financial jubilee is all about how did i even get to this topic well i've had some experiences in my life when god got a hold of me my parents my dad many of you certainly the older ones know my dad we come from a poor background my dad was an extremely hard worker period i know brother gary who worked with my dad early on no one could outwork my dad it was impossible he still works today so he's 83 years old he's still going you can't stop him he drives from he from hartwell georgia to macon they go he go to the service down and make it he's still doing that so sunday's up i'm going four hours away he's driving so my dad is a hard worker but financially we struggled i remember 375 was our monthly rent and my dad had a hard time sometimes coming up with that of course he worked he paid the people that worked with him but he didn't really manage any of that so the money would come in it would go out god in his grace allowed me to go to college that was a whole testimony of itself in maryland got out of college and i thought i was smart man i thought i was really smart i was making some money that my dad had never seen that type of money before and my brother was doing the same thing making some real money we was like wow so we got into real estate him and i started looking at houses we knew some other brothers that were borrowing money to buy houses and rehab them and sell them so we started doing all of that and i sold we sold one house and we made some good money i thought oh my i'm a christian this is how god is going to bless me i'm going to be blessed was i in for a surprise 2007 2008 you all know what happened if it was in any type of real estate it went money started going out left and right we started losing everything that we thought we ever had we lost a whole lot of money to say the least so i was shocked into this it got so bad thousands 10 20 000 gone gone gone every day the market was going like this we got down to one property that we had to try to get rid of and this was a condo in this condo they had a huge electric panel where the electric uh meter goes in so we got our condo was all ready to sell we're going to be done by god's grace we're going to get out of it call the electric electrician to come out to put the electric meter in they came out and said it's broke there's a plastic piece inside the meter and they can't get it in i said oh okay well they said you need to call the homeowners association to get this worked on we called they came out to know you got to get the entire thing replaced not just your box because it's connected to all of the condos this is going to be about ten thousand dollars for you to fix i'm like oh my god lord what in the world is going on here my brother who is in construction as well he said john whatever you do don't bother that electric panel it can boom that could be it i'm like i hear you i understand but i was under intense stress so i went and looked at that panel and it truly was a little small plastic piece that was broke and i was like if i could just move that plastic piece out of the way it'll be fine so i can do it i mean i'm pretty steady just have my screwdriver some rubber shoes on i'm fine i can i can get this plastic piece and get this 10 000 out of the way i don't know what happened i don't know how steady i was but i touched that thing boom all i know i was probably about 10 feet back by the time i came to and a chunk of that medal had been blown off i don't know what happened but i know god and his grace spared my life i do know that of course i didn't touch it after that believe me i i didn't touch it and i knew it was the grace of god because we called another electrician they came out called me later and said hey we fixed it that's all they said i said well okay how much to don't worry about it we've never seen anything like that that's all they said i said okay praise god but i went home and i started praying i said lord god something's wrong i've been paying my tithes i've been doing what i know to be right i've always been a little tried to manage my money the best that i could but lord something's not right that's when god started saying yep you've been trying to do it your way the world's way you've been a slave god has a way to manage money and it's called god's way let's go to the next slide and when you talk about money certainly it's not just money and that's what i've come to realize you know god in his word you can read plenty of scriptures about it you can also go through the message and see it but he said if you therefore have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon which is worldly wealth who will commit to your trust the true riches that's luke 16 1. that's what it's all about it's about managing something that's we all know we can all relate to but god is trying to see how well we can do that to put us in a position to manage true true riches and i know we know all what that's about all of the true riches to be able to manage that with character and that's what he's trying to get it is something that anybody from the youngest age can relate to money how do you manage it you can look at your children how do they spin how do they save do they have any character to save anything or do they always spend do they borrow are they just used to the norm so that's what financial jubilee is about it's about bringing that out go to the next slide [Applause] if you look at our society so 80 percent of americans have some form of consumer debt that's an average of 38 000 of americans which we supposed to be the richest nation on earth but 80 so if we brought 10 people up here eight of you could sit down you got some level of debt two of you would be a little special 70 percent of lottery winners spend it dave ramsey said that 78 of former nfl players have gone bankrupt or in financial distress due to joblessness or divorce that's from their own magazine sports illustrated so it's very real it's not about how much money you have or how little but it's how you manage what god has given you let's go to the next slide it's the number one reason for arguments among couples the number one reason for divorce the love of it as we know is the root of all evil clearly stated you can serve it or god that's how real it is keep going go to the next brothers if we talk about our uncle who we know who that is that's uncle sam right so looking at 2020. so as a country we brought in everybody when you pay your taxes that's how the government gets all of their money they brought in about 3.6 trillion dollars they spent or promised to pay about 13.4 trillion so they overspent 9.8 trillion dollars in 2020. we know with the pandemic all the money going out the little pieces that you got well that was part of that 9.8 trillion that they just gave you over and beyond what they had so we already know what our prophet said about this nation that it is bankrupt if you look at the full outstanding bills of the of our government it's 123 trillion dollars that's about 796 000 per person if we had to all pay that back that's how much it would be so if you got that in your wallet you can write your check and you can be free it's 123 trillion 123 trillion trillion is a big number in and of itself like if i tried to tell you what a trillion looks like it's very hard to imagine but if i were to take a million dollars and i'm gonna give you 10 million dollars tell me how long you think you could spend it to reach 1 trillion you probably well maybe a year if you're trying to do your math no it'll be past 100 years past 200 years you mean you can spend 10 million dollars a day for over 200 years and you still haven't reached a trillion try 273 years to spend 10 million dollars a day you couldn't spend a trillion don't mind so think about what our profit is saying who's going to pay that who's going to even help i think you already know i know y'all have been taught well because i've been here for several years so rome is going to help solve this problem my my mind and brother burnham said right in the money will get this whole thing rolling so where do you think we're headed so my we definitely want to be free people by his grace go to the next slide so we always talk about the government right and we're like oh man that's bad that's all man that's terrible this quote says if god gives us things to do and gives us money and makes us the richest nation under the heaven then god's going to ask what did we do with it why do we spend our money for things that satisfy not not only a nation but that'll be to individuals that's each one of us my brothers and sisters each one of us has to manage what god gives us in a way that it's different from the world the only way you can do that is god's way that's the only way to do this go to the next so we got to talk about financial bondage because before god helped me i i didn't know i thought i was like i said i thought i was smart i thought i had figured it out i thought god was going to bless me richly and it wasn't until god started showing me no you were way off so the question you got to ask yourself am i free or am i comfortable with this what this world and america has created me am i in financial bondage i don't know if you went to the doctors you got to do some check-ups some physical they got to tell you what kind of condition you are so we're going to run through some quick symptoms to see if you fit into any of this let's go to the first next slide all right we're going to run through some of this number one or you're always worried about money okay that's money and marriage problems arguments in the home frustrations maybe too much month at the end of the money the money the money runs out and you still got a long way to go is that going on in your home number two this is what i call bailout this is the big one especially now more than ever it's like you can go to youtube and find a thousand ways to make ten thousand dollars next month is not going to happen let me tell you but are you looking for some kind of bailout you know what i mean you're ignoring reality you got problems with money you're in debt you've got situations that you know you need to handle but you're hoping for a bailout something's going to happen okay something's going to happen is going to take care of all of this problems you want different results but you haven't changed anything and you look at history i mean we're at the end right we're at the end of time you know we know that we should be a people that should be free free from religious bondage free from all of those things that history has stacked us to this point we know the scripture that's always used in this church that they without us cannot be made perfect you know and the end of times have come to us but have we learned i mean have we learned from everything all of history i think of our prophet and what he brought everything has advanced everything has advanced but it seems like and i'm not saying this to be maybe for myself we should be way up the road with everything because we should be getting ready to go everything but take your money are we ready to go are you clean is it is it polished that you are really standing ready to go if god were to say let's go or do we have outstanding bills and debts and we're in a mess are we because if we're really ready to go we have to be ready to go in all areas of our life and i truly believe that's what god is doing to us trying to prepare us for that number two so is it is it we're looking for a bailout we're looking for something different every get rich quick or hey this opportunity is going to solve all my problems this will take care of it well that's how i kind of start started i thought god was going to bless me and it's going to be i'm going to show i'm a christian he did the opposite so that's the bailout if you have those kind of thoughts you're looking for some easy way that's the bailout the next is cover-up this is postponing the issue this is not being truthful with your spouse your husband wife you may know situations in your family that hey you're not telling your spouse if you're young and you're dating that's a good topic to kind of get through make sure she's not going to bring some some bills with her or he's not going to bring some bills with him make sure you understand that those are things to talk about but you can go through life your whole journey and not share things with your spouse because it's kind of embarrassing yeah i never paid this off i never paid that off but what you're waiting for if god were to take you home you don't that left on your spouse something she has to deal with i've seen that i've experienced that young and old alike i've seen that in the church i've seen that so it's very very real so don't have any cover-up situations not truthful to your family friends digging the hole deeper to maintain an image that's all about cover-up the next is greed this is certainly something that you feel like well i deserve it it should be me you know how do they get that you're not content impulse buying you buy things on impulse don't talk about it you know hey that's that's got a little bit of greed next is resentment you know point in the finger feel like god not giving you what you want and you're envious of others around financial concerns and money and things indulgence creating happy moments you know you can't afford it so you buy more that's called a great escape you know it's time to take a vacation when you start thinking about money like you know what we got to go yeah we need a vacation we need some happy experiences i know this one for sure when i started losing that money that money was going down like i could watch it especially being an accountant i was literally watching it go down but guess what part of that time i went out and test drive the new suv and i thought hey it's bad but i'm about to feel good and i drove that car around i was like man about his grace guys like no you don't need it you need to deal with the problem but it felt good i thought man if i could get this it'll kind of make me feel better for all this money that i lost and i didn't have any money to buy it but i guarantee you the world will tell you you deserve it john you've been working hard buddy you've been working hard you've been a faithful tied pair you can you can get this just sign these loan documents you can get it then god will bless you i don't sound like god blesses me it sounds like visa or mastercard or that bank is blessing me but that's what we call indulgence the next one is called no plan you don't know what happened right you know that you know that situation every month you know what's bills should be due but you don't know what happened so you're coming can i borrow this can i borrow that i don't know what happened well i know what happened you had some bills and you didn't have money you didn't work you didn't save you didn't put it aside guarantee your property tax gas all that's going to come those bills are going to keep coming so you need to keep some good records don't be slothful have a plan number eight middle man this is living paycheck by paycheck there's no margin all that comes in goes out during the pandemic we know i mean credit card you people was using that to make end meets i mean it was no kind of security if our government as you saw they had a plan we wouldn't have spent 9.8 trillion over but there was no plan there was nothing set aside to be prepared for that but we want to make sure within our home we don't have that nine is help wanted this has been unable to help when the real need arise your kids your parents i like to call this one like the hate the broke good samaritan if that good samaritan was broke that bible story would be very different promise you he would not have sent that man to that hotel it would not have happened he'd been like looking at him like bruh i can't take you home and i i can't man good luck but the bible store is quite different than that he had something he had something to say hey leave him here whatever he i'll take care of it when i get back and i promise you he didn't have to go to visa or mastercard to take care of that so we want to make sure that we're in a position where we can help truly then we know the depth debt trap you know this is not saving this is not bar and this is borrowing and being in that trap all right real quick so those are symptoms you can think about that let's go to the next slide the only way to get out of all of this right you got to have some principles and standards i'd like to call it a gps if you're kind of lost with all of this how do we figure it out well god has some principles he has some standards that can help guide you and that's what you have to take his word to guide you through all of this he knows exactly where each one of you are just like a gps and he can direct you all to that one way and get you back on that path that you have to be on all right go to the next slide we'll run through this for example this is one of the things prepare thy work if you look at the scriptures and this is certainly for some of the young people coming up how well that word guides us it says prepare thy work without and make ready for it in the field and afterwards build your house so before you run down and you get married make sure you have a plan make sure you have a way to provide then you start building your house don't take that first step you don't know if that young lady is going to want a coach bag a versace or whatever they call it all this stuff hey you better make sure you can take care of her likewise make sure sister that you're prepared for your husband make sure you don't have a bass boat five guns and all this and he's thinking he's gonna have what his granddaddy had tomorrow you better make sure because you're gonna find yourself in a lot of trouble so you can see how easy and how well our word is designed to guide us in whatever phase of life that we are in we're going to run through in the next couple minutes just some of the principles principle number one always know god owns it all the 10 tides they're his and the 90 we pay our tithes and we think well the 90 i guess i can do whatever i want to no he just gave that to you for you to manage and trusted it to you but it's still his so we don't waste our money we're wasting his money so it's important to think about how you're spending your money and know that god owns it all principle two manage his resources diligently get organized the scripture says the hand of the diligent shall bear rule but the slothful shall be under tribute get organized write some things down that's all you it doesn't have to be fancy but write some things down try to get organized take baby steps one step at a time money is time you purchase stuff with your time don't swap any portion of your a lot of time on earth for useless stuff you can pay 25 an hour if you waste that money that's 25 that's an hour of your time that you just said it was nothing so it's time to think about it think about what am i doing you know if your kids are wasting whatever is going on think about what you're doing because that is your life that you're trading and the world has been designed that way you work and you get paid so it's your time you got to think about that number four delayed gratification is one of the keys to financial maturity okay it says learning to wait that is so important learning to wait simply don't spend more than you earn wait it's so much character into waiting saving building i promise you you buy a car brand new for fifty thousand dollars it's easy to sign that loan promise you you save 50 000 you'll be a different person you will definitely think about before you spend that money i know for a fact we bought a in maryland before god taught me these principles we had a 40-year loan on a house and i know they got next generation loans you can pass through your kids if you want 40-year loan and i remember going in the house we had a house built we walked in they didn't do some things right but we were so thrilled to borrow that we couldn't tell them we felt well we've been blessed with this loan we can't disturb some situations you know we uh we'll take it but if i had that money i promise you i've been like no you're going to fix that or we're not buying the house we'll take our thousands of dollars somewhere else so you can see what debt does it puts you into a different frame of mind go to the next slide principle five winter is coming i'm sorry it says avoid debt like the curse the wealth tells us that we deserve to have it but as a christian we don't deserve debt oh i love this scripture it says the blessing of the lord it maketh rich and he added no sorrow with it man that's how you want to be blessed you don't want to be blessed and now you have some headaches trying to pay back some bills that's not the way god wants to bless you amen principle six winter is coming save a little bit don't spend all that comes in don't live to the max we already know the scripture that's been thousands and thousands of years go to the ant go to the end you're not going to be the same man 20 years from now that you are today my dad although he works hard he's definitely not the same man that he was when he was 50. at brother uh our brother ray's funeral my dad was talking to me he was like um god he said i wish i was that young man that i used to be my dad don't talk much but somehow he was reflecting on that at our brother's funeral he said man i could really go out there and do a lot i was like dad you're absolutely right you did that and probably to you like 60 or 70. but now he knows that he's just not that same i wish i had my strength so that's what we got to look at we don't know how long we're going to be here but it's still trying to think through like okay i can't live to the max i have to put something away just in case god still has me here or my spouse years from now principle seven the best investment of course is given to the kingdom of god your a lot of returns is waiting for you at home we know that and of course the last contentment is learned so everything i'm talking about is you have to practice just like the statue of a perfect man it's something that you got to walk you got to do it every day until that character is built inside of you paul said and get contentment is not something i can give you but if you apply these principles it's something that you can learn paul said i know how to be a bound and i know how to a base he learned by the grace of god so that's something we could do let's go to the next slide as we finish up this quote really means a lot and this was something that really stood out to me when when god was dealing with me during these times for sure you know this quote i promise to clean up your lives pay your debts oh no man jesus said get all things off your hands get everything right make ready get ready remember in the name of the lord something is fixing to happen that's what these principles all about it's about cleaning your lives getting things ready you know not owing anyone getting yourselves diligent writing things down and just the way that you do write it down take envelopes whatever you have to do to get yourselves organized to talk to people that you may owe money on just get yourself cleaned up god is there to help i know from experience because we started applying these principles step by step step by step we started getting rid of things that we didn't need we started selling things we started doing everything that we could do to get ourselves out of that hole i didn't take any shortcuts and by not taking any shortcuts god showed me his way and i have proved it i have proved it beyond a shadow of a doubt what god can do when you start applying his principles he's there to help he wants to get our lives ready that's his goal that's what he wants to do and he wants us to be free from this bondage for this world we shouldn't look like the world we know that but our finances our homes all of that should also not look like the world and the only way to do that is with that gps god's principles and standards last slide as we close and the musicians can get ready to come up go to click brothers you can go to the next that's what we're trying to strive for says well done good and faithful servant thou has been faithful over a few things i will make you ruler of many things enter thou into the joy of the lord that's very real that's what our god is trying to prepare us for to get us to be that faithful servant of course money is a little thing but being faithful faithful with that little thing is a very very big thing so god bless you all certainly appreciate this opportunity and the musicians all can come on up [Applause]
