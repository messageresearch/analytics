[0:00] sorry never
[0:02] mind morning everyone good morning good
[0:05] to have each one of you here today good
[0:08] to see brother Isaac with us today from
[0:11] somewhere up in
[0:13] Tennessee close to Johnson
[0:19] City hope you're having the
[0:21] ball funny huh was funny that's his last
[0:25] name okay
[0:28] anyway right go thank you now everybody
[0:32] hello all right let's turn to
[0:33] Revelations
[0:35] 21 and what we're going to do this
[0:37] morning is just kind to wrap up
[0:41] our Sunday school class on the
[0:45] Millennium and the future
[0:48] home just for a
[0:50] recap uh before I forget it thanks
[0:53] brother Joe for taking over last
[0:55] Sunday did a marvelous job yeah so
[1:06] amen it's good that God can raise up
[1:08] people that can do things this is not
[1:10] easy is it no it Ain is it he said no I
[1:14] know I talking about him too it's not
[1:17] easy it takes up a little time so that's
[1:21] why being a pastor is a full-time job
[1:23] you try to get three sermons for a week
[1:25] you're you're doing a lot of thinking
[1:28] all right so what we were doing was is
[1:30] we were taking the
[1:31] Millennium and comparing it with the
[1:33] future
[1:34] home we know that Millennium is in time
[1:38] the future home is in eternity that's
[1:40] the two main differences uh the
[1:43] Millennium is still in the seventh day
[1:45] rest the future home is in an eighth day
[1:48] which is eternity all right uh on the
[1:51] throne in the Millennium Jesus will set
[1:53] on the throne as the son of
[1:55] David future home he'll be King Jesus
[1:58] and we're going to read it in a little
[2:00] bit um this is before the white Throne
[2:03] judgment there is still sin it's not on
[2:06] the Earth but it is still the devil's
[2:09] still alive and all of the demons are
[2:11] still alive they're just put in a
[2:13] holding
[2:15] place until the Judgment
[2:17] comes even the foolish virgin even the
[2:20] fisel Jew even all the people that died
[2:23] during the uh battle of
[2:26] Armageddon they're all waiting for
[2:29] judgment
[2:31] this is the temporary world not saying
[2:33] that this world will go away but what's
[2:35] on top of it is going to be temporary
[2:37] because the Bible says we'll build
[2:39] houses and inhabit them in the future
[2:42] home we're going to read right here John
[2:44] saw the city already coming down out of
[2:48] Heaven John 14 Jesus said I'll go to
[2:51] prepare a place for you it wasn't this
[2:53] place it was this place cuz Jesus went
[2:56] to prepare an eternal place all right
[3:00] so
[3:01] now this is the temporary City in the
[3:03] Millennium and Eternity is an eternal
[3:06] City it's the one Abraham was looking
[3:08] for this in the Millennium is going to
[3:11] be a honeymoon for the bride and and and
[3:15] the groom and the
[3:18] 144,000 is going to be our Eternal home
[3:21] in the future
[3:23] home this is still all temporary here
[3:25] because this
[3:27] is sin is still around it's not there
[3:30] but it's still around when we get over
[3:32] into here when we're talking about this
[3:34] right here you're going to see that
[3:36] everything is passed away everything's
[3:39] gone uh the Millennium just ushers right
[3:42] into the white Throne right there to the
[3:44] Battle of Magog
[3:47] where um sin is done away with actually
[3:51] sin is judged see sin is judged right
[3:54] here that's what the white Throne
[3:55] judgment is it judges sin and
[4:00] then one given it eternal life and the
[4:02] other one is
[4:03] given into the Lake of Fire uh that's
[4:06] not going to happen right here at the
[4:08] battle of Armageddon the battle of
[4:09] Armageddon is going to be man's atomic
[4:11] fire that blows the world up all right
[4:14] and destroys the world because the Bible
[4:17] says man has destroyed everything um but
[4:20] this right here at the white Throne is
[4:22] going to be where God Reigns his holy
[4:26] fire and he kills all the devils and
[4:28] kills all the
[4:30] bad things and then now let's read
[4:34] Revelation
[4:36] 21 here's
[4:38] John and I saw a new Heaven and a new
[4:42] Earth
[4:44] okay cuz what had happened before that
[4:47] chter 20: 7 when a thousand years was
[4:50] ended Satan was loosed there was the
[4:52] Battle of Gog and
[4:54] Magog together to all the subjects
[4:57] together to try to fight against
[5:00] the righteous and they do not defeat
[5:02] them because you come over and then you
[5:03] got the white Throne judgment where all
[5:06] are
[5:08] judged look at verse 14 of chapter 20
[5:11] before we get to 21 and death and hell
[5:13] were cast into the Lake of Fire this is
[5:15] the second death see these Sinners are
[5:18] going to die one death and they're going
[5:20] to have to be raised
[5:22] again for another for judgment all right
[5:25] so they're going to have to be raised up
[5:26] and judged and then die the second death
[5:29] don't worry about the first death if
[5:31] you're born again you'll never see the
[5:32] second death but if you're not born
[5:33] again you going to see the second death
[5:35] cuz you're going to come up and give an
[5:36] account if we die to oursel here we
[5:39] don't have to go to the second death
[5:41] right if you're born again you've
[5:44] passed from what death unto
[5:48] life okay already here pass from Death
[5:52] unto life already been judged white
[5:55] Throne judgment is has nothing to do
[5:57] with you except you the one that'll be
[5:58] doing the judging right all right so
[6:01] let's keep reading now John well no I
[6:04] saw a new Heaven and new earth 21 verse1
[6:07] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[6:09] were passed
[6:10] away this
[6:13] one this one is passed away burn Over
[6:16] Again by God's fire going to burn
[6:18] everything out all right and what's
[6:21] going to happen is like brother R said
[6:22] that city is going to the Mountain's
[6:24] going to push up and then what did John
[6:26] see for the first heaven and first Earth
[6:28] will pass away and they more SE and I
[6:31] John saw the holy city New Jerusalem
[6:34] coming down from God out of Heaven
[6:35] prepared as a bride
[6:37] Adorn for her husband so where is it
[6:40] coming to where was John standing when
[6:42] he saw this Vision he was standing on
[6:44] Earth so the prophet said that the new
[6:46] city is going to be on the earth that
[6:48] Mountain's going to push up just like we
[6:50] showed it's not going to be a straight
[6:52] like this it's going to have valleys and
[6:53] ridges but there's the mountain and what
[6:55] John saw was a direct copy
[7:01] cuz remember when God gives you the new
[7:02] birth what does he
[7:04] do he takes the old man and and and
[7:07] takes the nature out right but this form
[7:09] is still here so what does he do man was
[7:12] formed in the image of God all right now
[7:15] you're being reformed or reborn but it's
[7:17] not changing I didn't have two arms now
[7:20] I have I mean didn't have two when I was
[7:21] a center and three or six fingers and
[7:23] now I got five he didn't change this
[7:26] structure that's right he just burned it
[7:28] Off made it holy
[7:30] all right that's what he's doing with
[7:31] this city he's pushing that mountain up
[7:33] and that city is going to sit right down
[7:35] if there's a valley in that City it's
[7:36] going to sit right down on that mountain
[7:38] it's going to be just a a carbon
[7:43] copy because what does it got to do it's
[7:45] got to fit the pieces that got to fit
[7:46] together right right so now that's the
[7:48] same with you and I why you and I now
[7:51] the word has to
[7:53] form be formed in us right but it's
[7:56] reforming us but it this same guy you
[7:58] saw that was was doing all the sin and
[8:00] is the same guy that's doing all the you
[8:02] know the it's not righteous what I am
[8:05] but what inside of me has made me that
[8:06] way all right but it's the same form
[8:09] that I had when I was a sinner right
[8:11] this is the same form that the Earth had
[8:13] when it was before you know back in the
[8:15] Garden of Eden and even with all the sin
[8:18] on it it's never it's not going to
[8:20] reshape itself and be square where it
[8:23] was round the form and the foundation is
[8:27] is you know the sound same thing with
[8:30] the foundation of the Bible it don't
[8:31] change right and if he made a heaven and
[8:34] he made an earth it's not going to
[8:35] change but you're going to have a new
[8:37] like brother Brown said new if you look
[8:39] in the Bible it's not I mean in the
[8:41] correct Greek it's not new like you
[8:44] throw away and get a new one but it's
[8:46] redone everything that we've destroyed
[8:48] like all the trees and all the things
[8:50] like that will come back new oh yeah
[8:52] fresh everything will be fresh and you
[8:56] know that may not be a Grand Canyon or I
[8:58] don't know that in the Millennium I
[9:00] think everybody everything will pretty
[9:01] much stay the same cuz in the Millennium
[9:03] is just going to be the atomic fire when
[9:06] they when they destroyed heroshima and
[9:07] Nagasaki all it done was it just killed
[9:09] the people killed all the vegetation a
[9:12] lot of the buildings were still there
[9:14] and they've worked on bombs for years
[9:16] that would just destroy people and
[9:17] plants and not even bother the building
[9:20] right right so that's what we're going
[9:21] to see I believe when we come back in
[9:23] Millennium there'll be a new Heaven and
[9:25] a new Earth but it's not going to be new
[9:27] like this one
[9:29] this one's going to be Eternal God is
[9:31] going to come and dwell in this one sure
[9:33] he's going to come dwell in this one but
[9:34] right here you want read right here see
[9:37] all things have been made new all things
[9:39] are not made new here in the Millennium
[9:41] that's right cuz you still got the devil
[9:43] still got the Heathen that be raised up
[9:44] in the Millennium all the things like
[9:46] that uh the Bible even saids a child
[9:49] would die 100 and the center this and
[9:50] see that that's things that I don't
[9:53] understand that's going to happen in the
[9:54] Millennium cuz it's it's a lot closer to
[9:56] what we're living in now the the future
[9:58] h ruins like they are now could be well
[10:02] there was ruins back you know right
[10:04] 2,000 years ago but it won't be that
[10:07] here because of this listen and I heard
[10:10] a great voice out of Heaven saying
[10:12] behold the Tabernacle of God is with men
[10:16] and he will dwell with them and they
[10:17] shall be his people and God himself
[10:20] shall be with them and be their God God
[10:22] shall wipe away all tears from their
[10:24] eyes and there should be no more death
[10:26] neither sorrow or crying there should
[10:28] any more pain for the former things are
[10:30] passed away now that you we're talking
[10:33] about the pure future home here we're
[10:35] not talking about a millennium this is
[10:36] the future home all
[10:38] right and God shall wipe away all tears
[10:40] there shall be any more death sorrow
[10:42] crying neither any more pain but the
[10:44] former things have passed away and he
[10:47] that sat upon the throne said behold I
[10:49] make all things
[10:50] new and he said unto me right for these
[10:53] words are true and faithful and he said
[10:55] unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega
[10:57] the beginning and the end I will give to
[10:59] him that is a thirst for the Fountain of
[11:00] Water of Life freely he that overcometh
[11:03] shall inherit all things see there's
[11:06] there's seven overcoming in the Bible he
[11:08] that overcometh he that overcometh
[11:10] there's seven that's number eight number
[11:12] eight puts you in in eternity each one
[11:15] of those one through seven is a battle
[11:17] it's just like the statue of a perfect
[11:18] man it's it's a birth right it's a birth
[11:22] of the things that uh getting it out out
[11:25] of us but right here number eight is he
[11:27] that overcometh shall inherit all things
[11:29] all right so we inherit the
[11:35] earth and I will be as God and he shall
[11:37] be my son but the fearful and
[11:40] unbelieving abominable murderers hor
[11:41] mongers Sorcerers adulterers and Liars
[11:44] shall have their part in the lake which
[11:45] burth with fire and brimstone which is
[11:47] that second death showing that there'll
[11:50] be no kind of any sin at all anywhere
[11:54] around all
[11:56] right everything's in the Lake of Fire
[11:59] that's going in the Lake of Fire all
[12:02] right and there came unto me one of the
[12:04] Seven Angels which had the seven vials
[12:06] full of the seven last plagues and
[12:07] taught with me saying come hither I will
[12:10] show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife and
[12:14] he carried me away in the spirit to a
[12:15] great and high mountain and showed me a
[12:17] bunch of
[12:20] people wait a minute he said he was
[12:21] going to show you a bride the
[12:24] Lamb's wife he didn't say I'm going to
[12:26] show you buildings and and parks and
[12:29] streets and houses he didn't say that
[12:31] didn't he
[12:33] but come hither I will show Thee the
[12:36] bride the Lamb's
[12:39] wife and he carried me away in the
[12:41] spirit the great high mountain and
[12:43] showed me that great City what the one
[12:45] that came down in verse two which was as
[12:48] the bride Adorn for a husband which was
[12:50] us the holy Jerusalem descending Out of
[12:53] Heaven from God having the glory of
[12:56] God and her light
[13:00] feminist her
[13:03] light talking about who you and I it's
[13:06] not the buildings that make a
[13:09] city when the city of Lula comes out for
[13:12] a parade all the buildings don't go out
[13:14] to the
[13:15] street right right who goes out to the
[13:18] street the people
[13:20] right city of Atlanta comes out for a
[13:24] parade all the skyscrapers don't just go
[13:26] right up to the and that's kind of
[13:28] carnal but that's the way you people
[13:29] think that the city is the buildings and
[13:32] no the city is the
[13:36] people her light was like into a stone
[13:38] most precious even like a jasper stone
[13:41] clear as
[13:42] Crystal now here he's going to describe
[13:44] this
[13:47] city and he had wall had a wall great
[13:50] and high and had 12 gates and at the
[13:52] gate 12 angels names written there on
[13:55] which are the names of the 12 tribes of
[13:57] the children of Israel look it's four
[14:00] square three gates on each
[14:03] side Ruben Dan it's car Benjamin all the
[14:09] 12 tribes
[14:11] right cuz you can't do away with them
[14:13] God said I'll never do away with Israel
[14:14] here we go back to Daniel 70 weeks you
[14:16] know he'll not do away with them he may
[14:18] punish them he may hide them but he'll
[14:21] not do away with
[14:23] them and on the East three gate on the
[14:26] north three Gat South three Gat and the
[14:28] West three gates like I draw it right
[14:30] here this
[14:32] wall had 12 foundations and on them the
[14:35] names of the 12 Apostles of the Lamb so
[14:37] your foundations right here you got your
[14:39] 12
[14:40] Apostles what's the what's the word of
[14:42] God built on the foundation of the
[14:44] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being
[14:47] the Chief Cornerstone but now he's the
[14:48] head right but Each corner is going to
[14:52] have the
[14:53] apostles not the people they're not
[14:55] going to sit there all the time with the
[14:57] city on top of their backs
[15:02] and the wall of the city had 12
[15:04] foundations and in them the names of the
[15:06] 12 Apostles of the lamb and he that
[15:08] taught with me had a golden rod to
[15:10] measure the city and the gate thereof
[15:11] and the wall thereof and the city lith
[15:14] four square and the length is large as
[15:17] the bread so in other words it's a
[15:19] perfect square and he measured the city
[15:21] with the re 12,000 furl which is how
[15:25] much, 1500 square miles right Prophet
[15:27] told you that the length and the breadth
[15:30] and the height of it are
[15:32] equal only way that can be be a pyramid
[15:35] all right pyramid
[15:37] shape because if this wall if the city
[15:40] was as high as it was wide it'd be
[15:43] straight up but if you got it at an
[15:45] angle like I said if you drive from here
[15:47] from here to Bartlesville 900 and
[15:49] something
[15:51] miles and if they're a th000 ft higher
[15:53] than us which they're probably not but
[15:56] say they were you'd never know right
[15:59] if you could see forever you could see
[16:01] the the U the angle as you were going up
[16:04] but you hardly would know you were going
[16:06] up right that's why that something down
[16:10] here can
[16:11] happen and it not be a square City Four
[16:14] Square they all thought it was like a
[16:16] cube you know the whole city was like a
[16:17] cube but even this
[16:20] uh even this uh
[16:24] wall L and he measured the wall thereof
[16:27] 140 and4 Cubit which which is 216 ft
[16:31] that's pretty good size wall but if you
[16:34] got A500 M Square
[16:37] incline in other words you could build a
[16:39] 200t wall um Stone Mountain is 8 uh 900
[16:44] ft tall Stone Mountain is at the top you
[16:47] build a 200 ft fence around it guess
[16:50] what you still going to be able to see
[16:51] Stone Mountain except if you were
[16:53] standing right at the bottom of the wall
[16:55] you couldn't but if you were standing
[16:57] away from it you're still going to see
[16:58] the mountain all right so that's 2116 ft
[17:01] which is pretty
[17:04] impressive cuz we didn't build it God
[17:08] did and he measured the wall thereof 140
[17:11] and 4 cubits according to the measure of
[17:13] a man that is a the Angel and the
[17:16] building of the wall of it was of Jasper
[17:18] and the city was pure gold like into
[17:19] clear glass and the foundations of the
[17:22] wall the city were garnished with all
[17:23] mans of precious stones First Foundation
[17:25] with Jasper second Sapphire the Third
[17:29] doni the fourth an emerald the fifth
[17:31] sardon donx the sixth Sardis seventh
[17:35] crystalite eth Burl ninth topaz
[17:39] 10th whatever that word is and the 11th
[17:42] jessen and the 12th
[17:44] amethyst if you'll remember back several
[17:47] years ago brother George
[17:51] quinnn brought out what all those things
[17:53] were what those stones and the names of
[17:57] them meant and I've still got them
[17:59] somewhere in my Bible I'm not in my
[18:01] Bible but somewhere at
[18:02] home but it was really those things are
[18:05] just not put there it was like God just
[18:07] thr a pile of rocks together and said
[18:08] hey this is how it's going to look no
[18:09] there's to God remember there's a order
[18:12] to
[18:12] everything
[18:16] right and I saw no Temple therein right
[18:19] now we had a temple right here remember
[18:22] we had a temporary we had in Ezekiel 40
[18:24] to 44 we had a millennium Temple that
[18:26] was built that Temple must got destroyed
[18:29] with everything else cuz it was
[18:32] temporary right this Eternal City that
[18:35] we're talking about right here is not
[18:36] temporary this thing's not going to ever
[18:38] go away right and I saw no Temple
[18:42] therein for the Lord God Almighty and
[18:43] the lamb or the Temple of it and the
[18:47] city had no need of the sun neither the
[18:48] moon to shine in it but the glory of God
[18:51] did lighten it and the lamb is a light
[18:53] thereof the nations of them which are
[18:55] saved shall walk in the light of it the
[18:58] kings of the Earth do bring their Glory
[18:59] and Honor into it and the gates of it
[19:02] shall not be shut At All by day for
[19:05] there shall be no night there he talking
[19:08] about the city City's going to Glow
[19:11] God's going to sit at the top of it on a
[19:15] throne read the future home brother
[19:17] random explains it just like he probably
[19:20] saw it in a vision probably God let him
[19:23] see it in a
[19:24] vision because you wouldn't get what he
[19:26] said out of a lot of the things that's
[19:28] in the Bible here all right but he
[19:30] remember a prophet goes up higher than
[19:32] anybody else and he can see further than
[19:34] anybody else God allow him to see all
[19:36] the way from how do you know Eve was
[19:37] blond-headed and blueeyed and Adam had
[19:42] hair down to his shoulders and he
[19:43] described it just like he was standing
[19:44] in the garden right right that's why he
[19:47] was a good Storyteller cuz he was there
[19:49] I believe God let him see those things
[19:51] that's
[19:55] right and they shall bring the glory and
[19:57] the honor of the into it see what's
[20:00] going to happen is is this is the way
[20:02] it's going to be said let's finish and
[20:04] there shall be no wise and there shall
[20:06] in no wise enter into it anything that
[20:10] defileth neither whatsoever worketh
[20:12] Abomination or maketh a lie but they
[20:15] which are written in the Lamb's Book of
[20:18] Life all right so here we go to the city
[20:21] the city part is going to be inhabited
[20:23] by who the bride and
[20:26] 144,000 okay now that's bride from
[20:30] Paul's age all the way up to our
[20:33] age bride not people that's giv eternal
[20:36] life not people at the white Throne
[20:38] judgment foolish virgins or or people
[20:41] like that it's only going to be for the
[20:45] bride and the bridegroom me and June the
[20:47] only two that lives in our house of
[20:49] course we have children and God has
[20:50] children too but we're the only ones
[20:51] that live in the house right not
[20:54] somebody else so all the kings of the
[20:56] earth that are giving eternal life like
[20:57] it just said here and all the people
[20:59] that are giv eternal life are going to
[21:01] have to live outside the city and what
[21:03] goes on outside the city is going to be
[21:04] different than what goes on inside the
[21:06] city inside the seity there'll be no
[21:08] need of light he just said that cuz I
[21:10] believe it'll have an eternal glow it'll
[21:12] just glow for for eternity but on the
[21:14] outside they may still have day and
[21:15] night it doesn't matter who God's not
[21:18] going to do away with the sun I don't
[21:19] believe right he said you won't need no
[21:22] you won't need the light of the Sun in
[21:24] the city see what it said right it said
[21:26] in the city it won't have need of the
[21:28] son because remember just like go back
[21:29] to what I
[21:31] said God when he originally created
[21:35] something he can't I don't believe he
[21:37] can do away with it now man can have sin
[21:39] on it and he can pervert it but when he
[21:41] comes back to his original whatever was
[21:43] created in that six days of creation
[21:46] God's never going to do away with it I
[21:47] just don't believe that I believe God
[21:49] made that sun he made the moon he made
[21:51] Earth he made all these things in his
[21:54] economy and it's going to all come back
[21:56] to the same Earth's going to be U right
[21:59] and all those things are going to happen
[22:01] right here so I don't think we're going
[22:02] to walk into this place and it be a
[22:05] strange place right we're going to know
[22:07] where we're at we're going to know where
[22:08] we've been we're going to know where we
[22:09] come from and we're going to know where
[22:11] we at all
[22:12] right so that's what I believe cuz
[22:15] watch chapter 22 and then we'll
[22:18] finish and he showed me a pure River of
[22:20] Water of Life clear as Crystal
[22:23] proceeding out of the Throne of God and
[22:25] of the lamb in the midst of the street
[22:27] of it either side of the the
[22:29] river was there the Tree of
[22:32] Life which be 12 maners of fruits now
[22:35] tree of life was where Garden of Eden
[22:38] right right you can eat off of that
[22:40] one now you can eat off of it and live
[22:44] right right you could have lived off of
[22:46] that one if they could have got to the
[22:47] Tree of Life In the Garden of Eden they
[22:49] were heading toward it but Satan you
[22:51] know give them the tree of knowledge of
[22:52] Good and Evil that tree is not going to
[22:54] be in the garden I mean it's not going
[22:55] to be in the future
[22:57] home and that time it won't be a future
[22:59] home it'll be a present home right
[23:01] brother renom was preaching prophesying
[23:03] of a future home right but once we get
[23:05] in there you're not going to call it the
[23:06] future home it's going to be your
[23:07] heavenly home
[23:10] right and there was the Tree of Life
[23:12] which bear 12 matters of fruits and
[23:14] yield her fruit every month and the
[23:16] leaves of the trees were for the healing
[23:17] of the nation because remember the
[23:19] leaves on the tree that um the pommer
[23:24] worm Locust caterpillar and all that
[23:26] what they ate they ate the leaves the
[23:27] leaves were
[23:29] Fellowship remember the leaves brother R
[23:32] showed how the leaves would happy the
[23:33] wind blow in the leaves and you could
[23:35] get under it you know and have shade and
[23:37] and could have Fellowship to leave we
[23:39] see fellowships all come back together
[23:40] now there ain't going to be no more war
[23:42] all the kings of the nations are not
[23:43] going to be fighting against each other
[23:46] that's why they're going to come in and
[23:47] get a leaf off of the tree as a
[23:50] symbol that that leaf is for Fellowship
[23:55] right and there shall be no more curse
[23:58] but the Throne of God and of the Lamb
[23:59] shall be in it and his servants Shall
[24:02] Serve him and they shall see his face
[24:05] and his name shall be in their forehead
[24:07] in other
[24:09] words in our
[24:13] brain right right here the knowledge of
[24:16] the Lord shall fill the Earth to sea and
[24:18] sky which is who you and
[24:23] I and there shall be no light there they
[24:26] need no candle the light of the sun it's
[24:30] talking about in the city right for the
[24:33] Lord God giveth them light and they
[24:35] shall rain forever and ever and he said
[24:38] unto me these things are faithful and
[24:39] true and the Lord God of the Holy
[24:41] prophets sent his Angel to show unto his
[24:43] servant the things which must shortly be
[24:45] done behold I come quickly blessed is he
[24:48] that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy
[24:50] of this book now John saw these things
[24:52] and heard them and when I had heard and
[24:54] seen I fell down to worship before the
[24:56] feet of the Angel which showed me these
[24:58] things
[24:59] then said he unto me see thou do not do
[25:01] it not for I am thy fellow servant and
[25:04] of thy Brethren the prophets and of them
[25:06] which keep the sayings of this book
[25:09] worship God and he said unto me seal not
[25:11] the sayings of the prophecy of this book
[25:13] for the time is at hand he that is
[25:16] unjust let him be unjust still he that
[25:17] is filthy let him be filthy still he
[25:19] that is righteous let him be righteous
[25:21] still he that is Holy let him be holy
[25:23] still behold I come quickly and my
[25:27] reward is with me
[25:31] me to give every man according to his
[25:34] work as his work shall be I am Alpha and
[25:37] Omega the beginning and the end the
[25:38] first and the last blessed are they that
[25:40] do these commandment this do his
[25:42] Commandment that they may have right to
[25:44] the tree of life and may enter in
[25:46] through the gates into the city for
[25:48] without her dogs Sorcerers whoremongers
[25:51] now what's he doing now he's dropping
[25:53] back and telling John what's happening
[25:54] now his City's being defiled by all
[25:57] these things that's city is not going to
[25:58] have these people in it right it's going
[26:00] to have these people that are converted
[26:02] in it but they're not going to be that
[26:03] when they're in the city dogs Sorcerers
[26:05] wh mongers and murderers adol and
[26:07] whosoever loveth and maketh a lie I
[26:10] Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto
[26:12] you these things in the churches I the
[26:14] root and offspring of David and the
[26:15] Bright Morning Star and the spirit and
[26:17] the bride say come and he that Hearth
[26:19] say come let him there is a thirst come
[26:23] and whosoever will let him take the
[26:24] Water of Life freely for I testify unto
[26:27] every man that Hearth the word of this
[26:28] prophecy of this book If any man shall
[26:30] add unto these things God shall add unto
[26:32] him the plagues that are written in this
[26:34] book and if any man shall take away from
[26:36] the words of the book of this prophecy
[26:37] God shall take away his part out of the
[26:39] book of life and out of the holy city
[26:41] and from the things which are written in
[26:42] this book he which testifies these
[26:45] things sayth surely I come quickly amen
[26:49] and then here's what John said even so
[26:51] come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord
[26:54] Jesus be with you all
[26:56] amen and then now for all these years
[26:59] has been expounded on from that
[27:01] amen but do you understand this city is
[27:05] a temp c a temporary City in the
[27:07] Millennium it's a temporary temporary
[27:09] thing but once sin is dealt with the
[27:12] white Throne judgments come we come to a
[27:14] city that it's our Eternal home there'll
[27:17] be no building done
[27:19] there the Bible says before we even
[27:23] think it God will answer all right it's
[27:27] an eternal world it's an eternal City
[27:29] that Abraham looked for and it won't be
[27:32] like I said it won't be a future home
[27:34] it'll be an eternal home it'll be our
[27:36] home for an
[27:39] eternity the difference in the people
[27:41] outside the city they can come
[27:45] in but but they got to go back out they
[27:48] don't live in that City all right you
[27:51] and I the Bride of Jesus Christ are the
[27:53] only people that are allowed to live in
[27:56] this city because this city was built
[27:57] Accord according to your desires from
[27:59] Paul's age from Steven which is the
[28:02] first martyr of the Holy Ghost during
[28:04] the Holy Ghost age to whoever is the
[28:06] last one that enters in in this last age
[28:10] those people are the only people because
[28:12] they held on to the word of God for
[28:14] their age and the testimony of Jesus
[28:17] Christ they held on to that and they
[28:19] became Born Again Christians which made
[28:21] them the Bride of Jesus Christ right not
[28:24] saying these people out here are any
[28:26] different it's just they don't get the
[28:27] privilege leges because what we did here
[28:30] is is we took and believed the word of
[28:33] God here right to its fullest extent
[28:37] that we
[28:38] know we were born
[28:40] again actually you got a part of that
[28:42] City when you were born again so you
[28:44] can't miss it that's right if you're
[28:46] born again you got a part of the city
[28:47] right here inside of you cuz he build it
[28:50] according to your desires not Adolf
[28:52] Hitler's desires or the man down the
[28:54] streets that's never going to have
[28:55] eternal life he built it according to
[28:56] your desires what you like the things
[29:00] you love um Jun will be my partner I
[29:05] believe that all my heart like brother
[29:07] Bram you know he had both of his wives
[29:10] arm and arm and walked into the city
[29:12] because they were both Born Again
[29:14] Christians not just because they were
[29:15] his wife they were both Born Again
[29:17] Christians and they both died and had
[29:20] pass you know one of them had passed on
[29:23] but remember meia asked him about going
[29:25] over there and M told I mean he told me
[29:27] to he said you won't have to worry about
[29:30] it over there he said there ain't no
[29:31] jealousy there ain't
[29:33] no you know so if your wife died and you
[29:36] marry another one which is lawful
[29:38] according to God's word then they'll
[29:40] both be there and you won't live as
[29:42] husband and wife as we do here but you
[29:45] will she'll be your companion for the
[29:47] rest of your life she'll be yours cuz
[29:48] brother Ram said he said you know um
[29:52] Adam wasn't complete without
[29:55] who Adam was not complete without Eve
[29:58] and if Adam wasn't complete without Eve
[29:59] you and I are not going to be complete
[30:01] without a mate right cuz we that's what
[30:03] we were given for right that's what you
[30:05] and sisters were given for took that rib
[30:07] out of Adam made Eve and I don't think
[30:10] God would went through that much trouble
[30:11] if he didn't think Adam and Eve should
[30:13] be together for an eternity right okay
[30:16] so and all those things that people try
[30:19] to preach that brother rown said all
[30:21] wrongs will be made right and all you'll
[30:22] get the right one over there I just
[30:25] believe I got the right one over here so
[30:26] I don't have to worry about over there
[30:28] that's right and over there there's no
[30:30] jealousy we won't have to worry about
[30:32] any of that stuff we you know you think
[30:35] you love your wife now you way to get
[30:36] over there you won't just love your wife
[30:38] that way you'll love everybody 10
[30:40] million times more than whatever love
[30:42] you have for your wife now that's right
[30:44] and it's pure and and and holy that you
[30:46] want you know the the love you have for
[30:48] your wife now but that brother rown said
[30:49] that was he said take that times
[30:51] millions and I believe he said
[30:54] billions and he said that's the love
[30:56] that you'll have over there for
[30:58] everybody for a single person like
[31:00] someone that never married at whatever
[31:02] age and went in they don't have that
[31:04] same love that it'll be directed
[31:05] everybody be back and for everybody and
[31:08] there be no jealousy I mean like brother
[31:09] Bown said he said the women hugged me
[31:11] and I knew they were women so they must
[31:13] have had the form of a woman they wasn't
[31:14] just we're not going to look like cookie
[31:16] you know we're not going to look like
[31:17] little cookie cutters all of us are
[31:19] going to be the same
[31:21] gingerbread no we're going to be short
[31:23] and tall and I hope we're not going to
[31:24] be fat I hope that's all going to be
[31:26] done away with praise the Lord all the
[31:28] people in the building says
[31:30] amen amen but it doesn't matter because
[31:33] we're all going to be still human beings
[31:35] that's my whole
[31:37] point when you're born again it doesn't
[31:39] change your human being it changes the
[31:42] being that's inside of you which one day
[31:44] is going to change this outside person
[31:47] same way with the world the world just
[31:49] got off
[31:51] kilter sin but God's going to put that
[31:54] same earth right back upright and he's
[31:57] going to put sainted people on it to
[31:59] live for an eternity right so somewhere
[32:02] down in this underneath where we're
[32:05] walking there's a
[32:07] mountain that mountain right there
[32:09] somewhere over there in Jerusalem down
[32:10] under the ground and I believe it's just
[32:12] going to one day it's going to just push
[32:14] right up City's going to sit right down
[32:16] on it and brother R said we'll walk out
[32:19] on a redeemed entire Earth now this is
[32:21] not redeemed entire Earth the
[32:23] millennium's not but that future home
[32:25] right there is a redeem in other words
[32:27] Redemption was you drop the book you
[32:29] don't pick up the pencil you drop the
[32:30] book you pick up the book so God let the
[32:33] Earth fall he pick going to pick the
[32:35] Earth right back up to where Adam and
[32:36] Eve was in the garden you know going
[32:38] have to worry about the Lions and the
[32:39] tigers eating each other you know cuz
[32:41] they ate grass before maybe when uh
[32:43] California f up sinks then come out no
[32:49] no no cuz California sinks way back over
[32:52] here yeah California don't sink here
[32:55] California sinks over here they don't
[32:56] have anything to do with this city right
[32:57] right here this city right here is
[32:59] waiting for this time right here after
[33:01] that white Throne judgment when we come
[33:02] back that Mountain's going to go push
[33:04] right up all right we'll do something
[33:07] else next Sunday I don't know what we'll
[33:10] do something
