[29:08] Jesus name Amen
[29:11] we'll read from John one that in the
[29:18] beginning was the word and the Word was
[29:21] with God now see we say Word was with
[29:25] God sounded like two people that would
[29:27] not look at the next part and the Word
[29:29] was God so you bring it right back to
[29:32] the singular part see the same was in
[29:35] the beginning with God all things were
[29:37] made by him and without him was not
[29:39] anything made that was made in him was
[29:43] life and the life was the light of men
[29:45] the light shyness in darkness and the
[29:47] darkness comprehended it not now we'd be
[29:51] taking part of our thought from
[29:53] melikhaya 3 and 6 he says for I am the
[29:58] Lord I change not therefore you sons of
[30:04] Jacob are not consumed in and you may be
[30:08] seated everybody in the family if they
[30:10] will will come on up and bring the
[30:14] little feller we'll have a dedication
[30:17] 'el service you know all of the family
[30:21] and everybody come home you know line up
[30:24] a round up here and get as close in as
[30:27] you can anyway or whatever and just come
[30:30] on up
[30:31] everybody we want everybody to be we
[30:34] doing things we don't believe in infant
[30:37] baptism that's if you do that's your
[30:40] business but we don't believe in that
[30:42] but we believe in what the Bible said
[30:44] they brought their children to Jesus and
[30:48] he blessed them well that's what we do
[30:51] we we just come together but we have a
[30:54] dedication and the whole family is to
[30:58] dedicate see now we're going to dedicate
[31:01] the baby to the Lord but just remember
[31:04] you are coming as a witness and standing
[31:09] here and you're to be a witness to this
[31:14] one
[31:14] you're supposed to dedicate your life
[31:17] then to the basis of seeing the child
[31:21] gets a good opportunity that way you
[31:23] help it and everything you can do and
[31:25] that way mainly what do you do you try
[31:27] to live before the child to where the
[31:30] child will see Jesus Christ and want to
[31:33] you know be a part of that because it's
[31:37] dedicating ourselves of the whole church
[31:39] so everybody will stand if you will the
[31:42] whole church then we dedicate everybody
[31:44] here is dedicated to see that this child
[31:46] gets a change it's an opportunity to how
[31:51] salvation and to everything we believe
[31:54] in in praying and asking God to take
[31:58] care of a lot of things so then that way
[32:00] we just commit it to him and we commit
[32:02] the child to the Lord but then you know
[32:04] what we'd have to do see we can hold the
[32:07] baby up and commit it to the Lord but
[32:09] then we give it back to you to raise now
[32:11] you
[32:12] uncle's answering everything grandmas
[32:14] and grandpas and and everything it's up
[32:18] to you to live before this child a way
[32:21] that the child can see Jesus Christ
[32:24] that's the greatest thing that could
[32:26] ever be thought of is to see that you
[32:30] would live and give your life
[32:31] to where you live because that's what a
[32:33] Christian is right a Christian is living
[32:35] for others and that's what we do okay
[32:37] now they can tell you he is official
[32:40] name and there's no way in the world
[32:41] would I try to pronounce all of it
[32:43] because I am NOT that talented so we go
[32:48] by little David we go by that and just
[32:51] say we're going to dedicate little David
[32:53] to the Lord okay
[32:56] hey buddy buddy yeah you doing on I just
[33:02] wanted okay so let's just all bow our
[33:07] heads and let's pray together and we
[33:09] just commit this little feller to the
[33:10] Lord and ask the Lord to bless little
[33:13] David and keep him healthy and to make
[33:16] him to be what he would want him to be
[33:19] and then we would live together with him
[33:22] to see that he arrives it down okay
[33:24] father
[33:25] we think you're an opportunity of taking
[33:28] a little baby like this and our hands
[33:31] and arms are not worthy but yet you gave
[33:34] it to a set of way and you gave a little
[33:36] baby to the to the family and it's a
[33:40] miracle Lord because we know the
[33:41] background story of even little Sabra
[33:44] that Lord there was no children to be
[33:46] there yet you blessed and you took care
[33:49] of it and you gave them Sarah then you
[33:52] now you gave them David and we just ask
[33:56] you Lord to touch little David we place
[33:59] him under the blood of Jesus Christ the
[34:02] word that you would be covered by that
[34:04] blood in the could be for you Lord we
[34:07] love you and we thank you we give him
[34:09] back to you now as we give him back to
[34:12] the family for them to raise him for
[34:15] your honor and glory we thank you for in
[34:19] Jesus name okay you want to wait the
[34:24] energy are you wide awake okay yeah I
[34:28] got a little bit not well okay you can
[34:32] be seated we appreciate everybody coming
[34:35] to say to the families Anderson's family
[34:40] sister Anna's family all the members of
[34:44] the families and for friends that come
[34:46] to dedicated a little feller to the Lord
[34:49] that
[34:54] if he can you know in the natural and
[35:01] babies are noise breaking down because
[35:03] of the immune systems is falling away
[35:06] but babies are really basically immune
[35:11] to sicknesses of things when their first
[35:15] five or six months you know and because
[35:18] that was the way God made it but then we
[35:21] get them to the Lord as quick as we can
[35:23] and dedicate them to the Lord to place
[35:26] them under the blood of Jesus Christ
[35:27] where he can come on the scene with them
[35:30] and take care of them and give them a
[35:32] good happy life and all and we just
[35:34] appreciate that appreciate all the
[35:36] families traveling they come from
[35:38] overseas and California is in New
[35:42] Jersey's and all over to see the little
[35:45] feller dedicated and we appreciate that
[35:47] we as the Church of Louisville we
[35:50] appreciate you being that concern to her
[35:53] you know that you would put forth an
[35:55] effort to show brother Anderson and
[35:58] sister Anna how much that you appreciate
[36:01] them and we do say to we most of you
[36:05] know the story little it was not to have
[36:07] any children it was hard and all but God
[36:10] took care of it we got a picture back on
[36:13] office it says a baby that faith brought
[36:15] well we believe that we believe that God
[36:18] made that he's all the supplies you know
[36:22] and now he's give him a little David and
[36:25] so then that sure that's doing now as
[36:29] brother brother said one time now and
[36:31] now look it's not for you brother
[36:33] Anderson or sister Anna to populate the
[36:36] whole world you you know okay and it
[36:41] doesn't matter to me how many out cuz
[36:43] I'm really one of those bleezin
[36:44] perfectly in predestination
[36:47] I am the 13th child of my family the
[36:55] baby in the thirteenth one and my dad
[36:58] when I was born was 63 years old my
[37:04] mother was 42 so I'm a firm believer
[37:07] and predestination now I believe the
[37:10] Lord took care of it and brought it
[37:11] there and that's why I love big families
[37:13] I don't know where most of you know
[37:16] those movies you made that they called
[37:19] it Dallas or something wherever I lived
[37:20] in a big old mansion thing you know and
[37:22] has well that's the way I'd be if I
[37:24] could I just have everybody to live
[37:26] around go away and we're doing pretty
[37:27] good we're within three or four yards of
[37:30] each other so you know we love it and
[37:33] and thank God for okay any other
[37:37] announcements always forget okay now
[37:42] what we've been doing for quite a while
[37:45] is talking about I've been trying to
[37:50] bring it from the Word of God and the
[37:52] both families know that how we believe
[37:54] that the God sent a prophet for the last
[37:56] days and and we believe that message
[37:59] that he brought unto us and we know that
[38:02] that the man himself was not God we
[38:05] don't put up nothing like that it's not
[38:07] true that we just honor the fact of him
[38:10] God sending us a servant that would
[38:13] bring us the Word of God because that's
[38:16] the main thing is serving God through
[38:19] hearing of the word truly we know that
[38:22] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[38:24] the word so then we're reading here and
[38:27] we read that in John 1 where it says in
[38:30] the beginning was the word Word was with
[38:32] God all right like I said that moment
[38:34] ago see we say with God seems like two
[38:37] of them you know but then it would say
[38:40] and the Word was God
[38:42] bringing it back to the singular point
[38:46] though we believe in one true and living
[38:48] God because that's the difference in the
[38:51] way we believe in say the denominational
[38:54] organizational systems of
[38:56] you know the religious room we believe
[39:00] in a firm statement of stating one true
[39:04] and living God not God in three persons
[39:07] that's what you've been taught most of
[39:10] your life that it was God in three
[39:12] persons we'll just remember a person's a
[39:15] personality a personality is an
[39:17] individual an end
[39:19] vidual as a person so then you wind up
[39:21] with three God's not knowing it see it
[39:25] was taught to us and we believe that but
[39:28] the Bible says you shall know the truth
[39:29] and didn't say you'd know about it now I
[39:32] said you shall know the truth and the
[39:34] truth shall set you free
[39:36] well see even in the commandments the
[39:40] first commandment is what the Lord thy
[39:43] God is one the whole word no word does
[39:47] it declare there is no such thing in the
[39:49] Bible as a Trinity now if you can show
[39:53] me the word in there I'll be glad to
[39:55] to denounce my belief if you can show me
[39:59] some form of a Trinity I can't believe
[40:02] that I believe in and try own I believe
[40:05] in in one true and living God as a
[40:07] triune being yes because to make it
[40:11] simple Father Son and Holy Ghost Lord
[40:16] Jesus Christ I'm a father I'm a son I'm
[40:20] a human but how many are the of me
[40:24] there's only one all right see then
[40:27] that's the way he was you said well
[40:29] brother nobody has ever seen God but you
[40:32] don't quote the rest of the scripture
[40:34] jesus said if you've seen me he said
[40:37] you've seen the father he said cause I
[40:40] and my father are one
[40:42] well God was glowing in that human
[40:45] vessel that was created for the purpose
[40:48] of being our Savior and our Redeemer and
[40:51] to bring us to the position of
[40:53] understanding God in his ways and do it
[40:56] but yet most of our life we've been
[40:59] taught by mankind or whatever is to talk
[41:04] about God just being like a spirit you
[41:07] know we'll quote that scripture God is a
[41:09] spirit well that's fine but remember
[41:13] he's not just a spirit like floating
[41:15] around think that's what we were taught
[41:20] all of our life you know that that makes
[41:22] it something to work that nobody has
[41:25] seen God well I said there's a quote in
[41:27] the scripture moment ago jesus said if
[41:29] you've seen me you've seen the father
[41:31] all right watch the problem see the one
[41:34] true and living God then comes down to
[41:36] the basis of seeing that God came to
[41:43] reveal himself to mankind right and
[41:48] being Almighty God the best words the
[41:51] theologians and things can get for it to
[41:53] start because you can only start from
[41:56] human terminologies and words if they
[41:59] use a word they call it Elohim and that
[42:03] word Elohim means self existing one
[42:07] right now you say well what now wait a
[42:10] minute there's a Trinity alright now how
[42:12] can the father and the son be the same
[42:14] age that's not even cents son can't be
[42:19] his older his father that's plain sins
[42:22] so then we don't believe something that
[42:25] away we believe in the one true and
[42:27] living God and there was a time that he
[42:29] was self existing which meant in plain
[42:32] language he dwelt alone what else could
[42:35] you say we're trying to explain an
[42:37] eternal God you say yeah but we can't
[42:40] understand why can't we understand it
[42:43] why did he give us the Bible if we can't
[42:46] understand why did he open the word unto
[42:49] us if we can't understand who he is and
[42:51] what he's doing see I'm a firm believer
[42:54] in God being real you know you say well
[42:59] he's just a spirit and he just with me
[43:01] at work no spirit you're making it too
[43:04] much like a pie Rangers or some of the
[43:11] terminologies you using the of these
[43:13] great things with their supernatural
[43:15] power you know this that or the other
[43:17] and so you put it all in the looks on
[43:21] don't put it dark God is real and that's
[43:25] the question I've asked you over and
[43:26] over how real is your God how what do
[43:29] you think about it what do you think
[43:32] about how that he could create
[43:34] everything and you mean that this is
[43:37] greater or more real this would this
[43:41] flesh
[43:43] is more real than the God that created
[43:46] it that's not even human sense you'd
[43:50] have to know I'm sorry that's I'm
[43:52] blowing alright any of you ever heard me
[43:54] some of you have you know that I'm just
[43:56] blunt I don't play around in that way
[43:59] you don't go out the doors and I wonder
[44:01] what that guy's talking about because
[44:03] you know for sure the way that I say it
[44:05] the water and see if you would talk
[44:08] about God is your God not greater than
[44:12] you then you would be his God is that
[44:18] sensible you would be his God instead of
[44:21] him being your project see if the
[44:23] Creator is greater than the creation
[44:26] right so we know that he created us all
[44:29] right so then he's greater than we are
[44:32] so then that way we can believe that
[44:35] he's real he's just not a mythology's or
[44:39] a thought
[44:40] see we want it that away cause then that
[44:42] way you turn around and talk to your
[44:44] kids about Santa Claus you know and you
[44:51] tell them about a Santa Claus which is
[44:53] the mythology well then they get to the
[44:56] point they wonder if God is a mythology
[44:59] because they can't see God but they
[45:03] didn't see Santa Claus he's done it to
[45:04] store but just remember he's down at all
[45:06] the Walmart so there's four I mean
[45:09] probably hundreds of thousands of stores
[45:11] and he's in every one that's a pretty
[45:13] good Santa Claus but I don't care for
[45:17] that that much to you but my point is
[45:20] what you mean we want to make Santa
[45:22] Claus greater than God and you ask your
[45:28] kids to explain a lot about the world
[45:32] today and that could explain all of us
[45:33] but don't even know Jesus Christ don't
[45:37] even know his name
[45:37] don't even know who he is or what he hid
[45:39] we yet they can tell you all about the
[45:41] the Daniel Boone's and the Davy
[45:44] Crockett's of being in that realm of us
[45:47] older ones or Superman's or our Batman's
[45:50] and and you get the kids all built up
[45:53] into an area until they don't know what
[45:56] to believe
[45:56] well I'm not that away I want you to
[46:00] know what to believe
[46:01] see that's where I believe that there is
[46:02] just one true and living God in his name
[46:05] is Jesus Christ because he said I come
[46:07] in my father's name is that scripture
[46:10] within if his father were if his name
[46:13] was Jesus then his father's name would
[46:15] be Jesus that shouldn't be no problem
[46:18] see and on son father's in the line of
[46:22] of the name and his name is Jesus that's
[46:26] the only name God ever had because they
[46:27] could not pronounce even in the Old
[46:30] Testament that's giving you a quick
[46:31] run-through they've got the word they
[46:33] call it jvh you or you can be do two or
[46:37] three different spellings of that but
[46:40] what it simply means is they could not
[46:42] pronounce it
[46:43] there was no vowels ever how your
[46:45] English people are you know there was no
[46:48] I hey I owe you that landed there wasn't
[46:52] enough in there to be able to come up
[46:53] with it so they came up and they made
[46:55] the word Jehovah and they put it down
[46:59] trying to interpret that jvh you has to
[47:02] be in Jehovah alright and Jehovah beings
[47:06] like a father with his family
[47:08] alright see then it means he's not self
[47:11] existing anymore
[47:12] he's existing with his people I love it
[47:15] thataway
[47:16] he'll never be self existing again why
[47:19] because he has somebody to fellowship
[47:21] with but he doesn't want to fellowship
[47:24] with the world he wants to fellowship
[47:26] with his children his offspring to learn
[47:29] Palo Mars Hill we talked about you know
[47:32] in other words at Mars Hill they had all
[47:34] these gods sitting up there well then
[47:37] they had one little space probably
[47:38] little boxes or something and it says to
[47:42] the unknown God well that was just in
[47:46] case they forgot who he was you know or
[47:49] left him out so they might little space
[47:51] you know what Paul said he said that's
[47:53] one cow creamer and the unknown God I
[47:55] won't talk to you about is Jesus Christ
[47:58] he said Dennis Christ in you the hope of
[48:01] glory
[48:02] he didn't knowing that God is real is a
[48:06] very important part of the Christian
[48:09] realm because they're just
[48:10] even in thoughts and ideas or
[48:12] mythologies or what is your input is a
[48:15] great words we use today what do you
[48:17] think about this well we don't have no
[48:19] right to think about God you mean you
[48:23] can think about God and change his ways
[48:25] of do it no that's why I read that he
[48:28] said I'm God and I change not
[48:31] we'll see he's never changed whatever he
[48:35] was in the beginning he still is he'll
[48:38] always be that he's the eternal God he
[48:42] just brings himself down to human parts
[48:46] to work as human beings can understand
[48:48] him and follow her into that line and
[48:51] and see who he really is
[48:53] alright see then in doing that he didn't
[48:59] he's more real than we are he's not a
[49:01] myth he's not a doll he's a person he's
[49:05] a PE he lives in heaven he had to place
[49:09] to dwell he was that away before you and
[49:14] I ever come into existence but he was
[49:17] real not just a spirit floating around
[49:22] in the world of nothing's and all know
[49:25] where his heavens of heavens power was
[49:27] taken up to the third heaven and he said
[49:30] he saw things that were not able to even
[49:31] talk about them well how much further
[49:34] can God go so in the beginning get it
[49:37] out of your mind in the beginning we
[49:38] return in John in the beginning was the
[49:41] word right now what are you going to do
[49:45] because before it can be word it has to
[49:49] be a thought first right I know
[49:54] sometimes we run our mouths off I still
[49:56] I wonder if our brain keeps up but it's
[49:59] still not true the fact you can't say
[50:01] something unless your brain communicates
[50:04] with that part of you to make the
[50:06] talking so you have to think about it
[50:11] you don't sit down I think I'll say this
[50:13] and I say that no you're thinking it as
[50:16] you go when you're speaking from that
[50:19] part all right but see it's got to be
[50:22] first at all
[50:25] and then can't you see how real God is
[50:29] and we like I said we think about him as
[50:31] we've taught it well he's just
[50:32] experienced it why not bring him down to
[50:35] reality why not let him be real like he
[50:41] is and then it will get away from all of
[50:43] those ideas well you know I just feel
[50:46] you know what it is you know in the
[50:48] religious rims of how it is oh I feel
[50:50] the Lord I feel this I feel that's
[50:52] wonderful as long as the Lord which is
[50:56] also teaching in the religious realm
[50:58] that says that God is the good thoughts
[51:00] that you have and that's all he is but
[51:04] the devil is the bad thoughts that you
[51:07] have well that makes the devil just as
[51:10] real as God goes now you argue all you
[51:15] want to but you get a whole lot more
[51:17] wrong thoughts and you get good thoughts
[51:19] I don't care who you are you say I know
[51:22] I just think now you're lying be honest
[51:25] the devil gets more in road into the
[51:27] human realm that we are and he has a
[51:29] whole lot more controlling power in here
[51:32] than we allow the Holy Spirit to have
[51:34] even though it's living within us I
[51:38] don't know just be honest and just see
[51:44] how the devil can do those inroads if he
[51:46] could talk to the Lord Jesus Christ and
[51:49] offering bread offering this offering
[51:51] that offering the world don't you think
[51:54] he can all talk to us a whole lot all
[51:56] right now see then we've been trying to
[51:59] go backward in understanding and now we
[52:03] start in Genesis where it says in the
[52:06] beginning God created the heavens and
[52:11] the earth see now that was a worldly
[52:14] beginning that was a beginning of things
[52:18] not necessarily a beginning of time
[52:20] until sin entered the picture it was not
[52:23] recorded about time and doing even
[52:26] though the days you had read in Genesis
[52:27] 1 about the day one he created that who
[52:30] he created those are explanations
[52:32] they're not stating a day as a day
[52:37] because the day with God is a thousand
[52:39] years and a thousand years as a day so
[52:40] you you've got to get more than just
[52:43] twenty-four hours as a day time but just
[52:47] think about it my whole point has been
[52:49] to all of us is to do one thing think
[52:51] about he wasn't just you know we said
[52:54] okay now brother Dale we got away from
[52:56] being a spirit so now we just make him
[52:58] you know be real you mean he's gonna set
[53:01] now for millions of years by self and
[53:05] just twiddle his thumbs
[53:09] no he self-existing he's by himself -
[53:16] that's wonderful remember he's thinking
[53:21] you know this world is just God's
[53:23] thoughts spoken and brought into
[53:26] existence human beings people and
[53:29] whatever we think of ourselves are just
[53:32] the fact of what God thought of before
[53:34] the world and he spoke it and it comes
[53:37] forth why can't we accept it that way
[53:40] but can't we see that is that his
[53:43] thoughts are more real than we are over
[53:48] in Isaiah Isaiah says my thoughts are
[53:52] not your thoughts it says my ways are
[53:59] not your ways said my thoughts are so
[54:04] much higher than your thoughts until
[54:07] your thoughts are not even in the
[54:09] picture and he said my ways are so much
[54:11] higher until your ways is out of the
[54:13] picture see it's not just you and I to
[54:16] think remember the best we can think is
[54:19] just human terminologies and like the
[54:22] Prophet said when you read in the
[54:24] beginning was the word the Word was with
[54:28] God the Word was God
[54:29] that's as far as our human minds can
[54:33] comprehend but by revelation God's Word
[54:42] bringing it down to us we can go back
[54:45] pi-star go back into the eternity
[54:48] without thinking
[54:50] and to no one realized that he's real
[54:52] and he thinks he's is not set as I said
[54:56] setup to her you know Lilly Juun ain't
[54:58] got nothing to do I'm gonna board you no
[55:00] no and you believe God is being real how
[55:07] real is your God now quote the Prophet
[55:09] the way he stated he said God knew ever
[55:12] net that would ever be in the world and
[55:16] how many times that NAT would bat its
[55:20] eye that's getting close to infinite
[55:24] isn't it if we don't give him that
[55:28] ability to be infinite we think he hides
[55:30] and like I said and maybe it would be
[55:32] pretty good sometimes to have all this
[55:34] Father Son and Holy Ghost in some kind
[55:36] of a doctrinal ideal code may be
[55:38] somewhere between all three of them he
[55:40] might lose my sin he might lose Who I am
[55:43] and what I do it but I don't believe it
[55:45] teller was sure I believe in Father Son
[55:47] and Holy Ghost for that Lord Jesus
[55:48] Christ
[55:49] see that's why our baptism is not in
[55:52] father son and holy go your Catholic
[55:54] Church pact that down your throat all of
[55:55] the years I can show you in your own
[55:58] sight encyclopedia go home on your
[56:00] computer and running on your computer do
[56:03] it one time run in Nicean council 325 AD
[56:08] and see if that was not what they were
[56:12] doing they were changing the original
[56:15] way of baptism is in the name of the
[56:17] Lord Jesus Christ causes just one God
[56:20] the Catholics come up come in from Rome
[56:22] and as they come down from the natural
[56:24] pagan Rome to the what you call the
[56:27] spiritual Rome or whatever you call it
[56:29] religious Rome then they brought it up
[56:32] to many gods and they brought in Father
[56:35] Son and Holy Ghost simple to me Lord
[56:41] Jesus Christ
[56:42] Father Son Holy Spirit and see that's
[56:46] why we baptize in the name of the Lord
[56:48] Jesus Christ because there's no such
[56:49] thing as three gods your Catholic Church
[56:53] back that down your throats you go ahead
[56:54] and believe what they say but the truth
[56:57] of God will set us free
[56:59] see that's why there's so much in the
[57:01] Word of God that brings it out to where
[57:03] we can
[57:03] understand and there's like I said we go
[57:07] back and see how real God is you can't
[57:13] come on listen you can't prove there's a
[57:15] god oh and they've heard a preacher talk
[57:22] like that well is it true proving to me
[57:29] now you're going to have to use some
[57:31] form some wording some thought to be
[57:35] able to bring it down you can say all
[57:36] you want to God lives in need you know
[57:40] god lives in me I know he's real you
[57:43] remember what happened years ago there
[57:44] was a man named of livers Altizer
[57:46] that he back in the 60s I guess
[57:49] somewhere right in there he said God was
[57:51] dead well it just went everywhere oh boy
[57:55] everybody was getting all excited and
[57:57] everything cause the manege said God was
[57:59] dead the simple point was I checked it
[58:01] out his point was that God was dead in
[58:03] the lives of the people I agree with him
[58:05] 9 I agree in the lives of the people God
[58:08] was dead they didn't have a living God
[58:11] they don't believe God was dead because
[58:13] if god is dead where are we you
[58:16] understand
[58:18] we see that was his thoughts and man
[58:20] said you know that come on the radios
[58:22] and the preachers were free
[58:24] I know he's real because he lives in my
[58:27] heart
[58:30] well they're not living like the devil
[58:33] right and then my living like the devil
[58:38] I don't think God was in their heart
[58:41] sorry if that's all you got you got a
[58:46] flimsy excuse to try to talk about God
[58:50] to me to believe in one true and living
[58:53] God the best thing I can do is look back
[58:56] at humanity and see what God created
[58:59] see how he brought us you talk about a
[59:02] marvelous situation of bringing into
[59:05] existence like I said there I want to go
[59:06] about the dedication you realize and I
[59:08] know it's breaking down because of the
[59:10] immune system but you know babies used
[59:12] to be almost immune to sickness for for
[59:15] 6 months
[59:16] why because God had put in with him an
[59:19] immune system that it was broken down
[59:22] after it got into life can you tell me
[59:26] how that you you tell me how you live
[59:32] we'll find out whether there's a guard
[59:34] or not how do you live well I eat I do
[59:38] this will tell me how that food goes
[59:40] into your body comes out into blood
[59:42] cells and runs through this and comes
[59:44] through that makes all this work you
[59:50] realize all you got to do is block that
[59:52] heart for a split second and you're dead
[59:57] you mean all of this that works in the
[1:00:00] human you come on flow implying that you
[1:00:09] tell me how that a white man can give a
[1:00:12] black man a blood transfusion our vice
[1:00:15] versa it don't change the color of the
[1:00:19] skin it doesn't I mean when you go to
[1:00:23] the hospital you be you say I want to
[1:00:26] make sure that I get a white man's blood
[1:00:28] or the black foods I want to make sure
[1:00:30] to get the black men blood
[1:00:32] it might change something what's it
[1:00:34] going to change its blood the Bible said
[1:00:38] in one blood there's no glory in what we
[1:00:42] look like with somebody yesterday with
[1:00:46] the brothers are me the pigmentation of
[1:00:51] the color of your skin is determined by
[1:00:53] the environment you're around and the
[1:00:54] thing and as it does and it finally
[1:00:58] gradually weakens down and that's why
[1:00:59] it's getting worse and worse and mixing
[1:01:01] together but at one blood the Bible says
[1:01:05] he made all man
[1:01:07] well it doesn't bother to give a blood
[1:01:09] transfusion Lee do you explain that
[1:01:13] though I like the way the Prophet said
[1:01:16] it you explain to me how that a brown
[1:01:18] cow eats green rice and yields white
[1:01:22] milk
[1:01:25] I got lost our tumblr it looked like the
[1:01:32] milk would at least be green no you
[1:01:37] can't explain those things right but you
[1:01:40] can look at it and see God is real see
[1:01:44] how it really is because he created us
[1:01:48] and the Bible says we're good to adduce
[1:01:50] even more that he created us in His
[1:01:52] image well what was God to look like
[1:02:00] then he dwelt on the earth 2,000 years
[1:02:06] ago in the human body right you know
[1:02:10] that body didn't look no different we do
[1:02:14] we just remember one thing for certain
[1:02:18] Jesus was neither God neither Jew nor
[1:02:21] Gentile he was God Almighty he created a
[1:02:26] blood stream he was the only DNA of that
[1:02:29] connection all the rest of us connects
[1:02:34] back to Adam to her DNA but he's real
[1:02:41] that's all I've asked you to think about
[1:02:43] how real is your god a god that could
[1:02:48] run all of this universe like people
[1:02:50] have said you know to me about it said
[1:02:52] well if Jesus was God when he was a baby
[1:02:54] later who was running the world all he
[1:02:59] did in the Genesis he just focus it let
[1:03:01] it be it's been running ever since he
[1:03:04] don't have to get up every morning raise
[1:03:05] the Sun it comes up automatically why
[1:03:09] because he spoke at the beginning and
[1:03:11] speaking it in the beginning it's going
[1:03:13] to run that way until he speaks in some
[1:03:15] other way but see we limit him to our
[1:03:19] thinking I try to bring him to our
[1:03:23] thinking and your think I'm trying to
[1:03:24] limit him to that no I'm not limited to
[1:03:27] him to my thinking but I'm trying to
[1:03:30] bring him to our thinking to where we
[1:03:32] can see how really is and have it back
[1:03:37] in the beginning he existed
[1:03:38] own we had talks I emphasize this at
[1:03:46] every funeral that I've ever done I
[1:03:50] emphasize one thing to the brief to the
[1:03:53] grieving family it's hard to lose a
[1:03:56] loved one it's hard to let them pass on
[1:04:00] we just remember after a little while
[1:04:04] you'll start thinking about the things
[1:04:07] that you were doing and you'll be
[1:04:11] grieving about losing your daddy or your
[1:04:13] mother but then after a while it changes
[1:04:18] to from grieving to the point you
[1:04:20] thinking about the things that happened
[1:04:22] and you know you can spend the rest of
[1:04:25] your life thinking about the things
[1:04:27] action that we you would do your daddy
[1:04:32] in your mother you don't never sit down
[1:04:38] am I the only dumb it shuts down
[1:04:40] sometimes and just tries to think you
[1:04:43] don't ever just get you know you just
[1:04:45] said I own and you to think and you
[1:04:48] think about all of the things that

[1:04:55] life and what you've done and were you
[1:04:57] doing who or you makes your husband that
[1:04:59] or you met your wife at or you've earned
[1:05:01] it where you found this and I'm you
[1:05:05] don't never think it's considerate
[1:05:14] I don't believe in in what you call the
[1:05:17] word sanitizing I don't know what that
[1:05:20] means just trying to build up in your
[1:05:21] mind to make something I mean just think
[1:05:23] about reality just think about where you
[1:05:28] come from what you're doing it can be
[1:05:32] funny even things that when you went
[1:05:36] through it in life it wasn't funny
[1:05:42] you'll never remember in school the
[1:05:45] things you kids used to do and then we
[1:05:46] adult don't want our kids to do things
[1:05:48] right we think they ought to be saying
[1:05:50] through it oh come on
[1:05:51] we wouldn't st. we had a calendar in a
[1:05:55] school and it had to put us together cuz
[1:05:58] it the whole building had burned down
[1:05:59] and we were rotating through and we had
[1:06:01] a calendar sitting about as far as the
[1:06:03] waller of all the presidents I mean we
[1:06:06] remember them well back this is this is
[1:06:08] in the 50s okay and then we had a
[1:06:12] calendar well the way they separated the
[1:06:14] room was a pegboard you know South board
[1:06:17] with the etiquette how hold it in take
[1:06:19] board come on kids come on adults what's
[1:06:24] it like ride we used to take a spool

[1:06:31] us a rubber band and we take a spool and
[1:06:35] we get us a pencil or a stick that would
[1:06:37] slide to the food and the teacher would
[1:06:41] be up trying to tell everybody and you'd
[1:06:43] hear it go I mean Abraham's eye goes out
[1:06:53] hello we could Life all evening about
[1:06:56] the things of life couldn't it now will
[1:06:59] you get the point then to do that you
[1:07:01] know what you're doing you're thinking
[1:07:05] when I Illustrated that you looking at
[1:07:08] then I got to see him doing that ugly
[1:07:10] Roosevelt on that that's you're thinking
[1:07:15] it's a wonderful opportunity to be able
[1:07:18] to think what would it be if it was
[1:07:21] taken away from us
[1:07:24] I've always said about my wife you know
[1:07:27] they worry about you taking in now when
[1:07:29] you get about 70 years old I take it in
[1:07:31] and and they take you 65 70 to take you
[1:07:34] into the doctor and the doctors got the
[1:07:36] nurses comes in and they got these
[1:07:38] questions asking and they say remember
[1:07:41] these three words
[1:07:43] CatDog hat well then they go talk for a
[1:07:47] while and ask you all about what you're
[1:07:49] doing and everything else and did it
[1:07:50] come back to what was in three words you
[1:07:52] know what they're doing they're checking
[1:07:54] to see where you go where you're crazy
[1:07:55] or not they're checking to see whether
[1:07:57] you got all Hummers or not and I told
[1:08:02] the people about it I said you need to
[1:08:05] worry about my wife No so you'll never
[1:08:08] die of all hammers because her brain
[1:08:12] never stops you can't go to bed at night
[1:08:15] I go to bed lay in the bed fall over two
[1:08:19] seconds I'm sound asleep
[1:08:21] three hours later I'm up maybe walking
[1:08:23] through the house I haven't slept a wink
[1:08:26] pray for me
[1:08:28] you know what the problem our brains
[1:08:30] running she never puts it on hold and
[1:08:34] says go to sleep are you following me
[1:08:38] what about your thoughts I'm jogging
[1:08:43] your brain to think about thoughts and
[1:08:45] ideas because to realize then that God
[1:08:48] when he was dwelling alone back before
[1:08:50] the world he had thoughts and his
[1:08:53] thoughts was his attributes attributes
[1:08:56] is what he was trying to display he
[1:08:59] wanted to be a savior but there was
[1:09:01] nothing lost he wanted to be a healer
[1:09:05] but there was nothing sick he wanted to
[1:09:09] be a father but there was nothing to me
[1:09:11] he wanted to be God but there was
[1:09:13] nothing to worship him and see then he
[1:09:17] was dwelling truly alone with histology
[1:09:19] of what he wanted to be he decided to be
[1:09:25] those things Satan didn't pull nothing
[1:09:28] over on God in the garden Satan was a
[1:09:31] part of the plan to get it all to going
[1:09:34] because it had to been a devil to make
[1:09:36] us go wrong we wouldn't know went wrong
[1:09:38] so he had to not make the devil
[1:09:41] devil and put him out he permitted him
[1:09:43] to come that was part of histology it
[1:09:48] was also a part of his South to know one
[1:09:49] thing for certain if he give me and you
[1:09:52] the opportunity we would go into sin
[1:09:56] don't blame Adam and Eve back Dyer
[1:10:00] remember they didn't have no new birds
[1:10:02] to help them but just remember he was
[1:10:08] thinking about what he was going to do
[1:10:12] and we talked about life as being you
[1:10:17] know they were enter in the seventh day
[1:10:18] is what we talked about seven thousand
[1:10:20] years under thing and see he was set
[1:10:24] back our billions of billions of
[1:10:25] billions of years before anything ever
[1:10:29] come into existence he had a lot of time
[1:10:32] to think it over
[1:10:34] you know what he could never have a new
[1:10:37] thought that's what I love about God he
[1:10:42] can't think of something and then turn
[1:10:43] around and change his mind if he ever
[1:10:46] tells you anything from the word don't
[1:10:47] worry about it they put your life on it
[1:10:49] and believe it just put everything on
[1:10:53] that if he ever tell you you read the
[1:10:54] Bible and believe it just believe it
[1:10:56] because he he's there's no way that he
[1:10:59] can think a different thought there's no
[1:11:05] way that he can change his mind
[1:11:10] remember melikhaya says I'm God and I
[1:11:13] changed not there's no way that God can
[1:11:17] change it's us to change and we want to
[1:11:20] make him to our changes instead of
[1:11:23] trying to make us coming to the point
[1:11:24] that he doesn't change and how that back
[1:11:28] in the beginning before anything ever
[1:11:30] existed at all he thought about this
[1:11:34] world and what it would be you know what
[1:11:38] it's going to be the way he thought it's
[1:11:44] going to be the way he thought I got a
[1:11:47] pen a associate meeting one day you know
[1:11:49] arguing over who was going to be
[1:11:50] president back two or three before you
[1:11:52] know and ever picture it got up you know
[1:11:54] in kind of way we do
[1:11:55] in the felon and each one was talking
[1:11:56] about I believe it's gonna be this I
[1:11:58] believe it's gonna be that I got up and
[1:11:59] I said do you want me to tell you who's
[1:12:01] gonna be President
[1:12:02] here so I said you know problem you want
[1:12:09] me to tell you who's going to be
[1:12:09] President or finally someone said hello
[1:12:12] I said the Bible says I put in Kings and
[1:12:15] I take out Kings whoever who he wanted
[1:12:19] to be President was going to be
[1:12:20] President I didn't know God run
[1:12:24] everything like that well I thought he
[1:12:25] did I thought he run every time if you
[1:12:29] don't believe it that way wanted the
[1:12:30] devil get it in his own idea to try to
[1:12:32] offer everything to Jesus if he didn't
[1:12:35] think he owned it the devil owns a lot
[1:12:38] of it but he knows there's nobody
[1:12:40] greater than him and that's the problem
[1:12:42] is trying to get as many people as he
[1:12:44] can on his side by our thinking you
[1:12:50] realized you're sitting there right now
[1:12:52] some of you're saying well I wonder what
[1:12:53] we're going to eat come on saying what
[1:12:58] in the world just got talking about some
[1:13:00] of your saying well I need to go do this
[1:13:01] because I get to I better write it down
[1:13:03] cuz I'm gonna forget it oh yeah that's
[1:13:11] our thinking but just remember we quoted
[1:13:16] you Isaiah I believe it's 58 I think I
[1:13:18] tried where he says my ways are not your
[1:13:22] ways my thoughts are not sure at all you
[1:13:26] can never have another thought from what
[1:13:28] he thought of it that's wonderful
[1:13:32] all you got to do is find it in the Word
[1:13:34] of God and believe what God said when
[1:13:36] you read in earnest and by stripes I'm
[1:13:38] healed
[1:13:38] put your name there say by stripes I'm
[1:13:41] healed ale is healed that's the word you
[1:13:47] know they do that and then he'll just
[1:13:48] take care of the healing why are you
[1:13:51] women out listening to thought just for
[1:13:52] a minute his thoughts are eternal and he
[1:13:58] can never have another different talk
[1:13:59] from that one that he thought so then we
[1:14:02] can believe it looking the Prophet said
[1:14:05] it like this he said this is
[1:14:08] now I'm holding up a Bible what is those
[1:14:11] letters on a page right we call it what
[1:14:15] the word right
[1:14:18] we call this Bible the word you know
[1:14:22] what that's God's Tallis then he put
[1:14:27] there you must accept it as for you
[1:14:36] well yet we look at it is like we like
[1:14:38] to tell stories out of it or this
[1:14:40] happened and that happened they were
[1:14:41] great things happen here but not
[1:14:43] thinking about who we are and where
[1:14:46] we're at and what's taking place why not
[1:14:53] the Bible is not written to a sinner
[1:14:56] listen to what I'm saying the Bible is
[1:14:59] written to Christians those that are in
[1:15:00] Christ Jesus the scripture said it's
[1:15:03] written through the center only in the
[1:15:04] basis of condemning him of his sin it's
[1:15:10] not to him it's only to condemning only
[1:15:13] to bring knowledge of sin in his own
[1:15:17] life within if it's to bring knowledge
[1:15:19] of sin and its own life why can't we
[1:15:21] believe it it's written to you and I and
[1:15:25] accepted as that and say thank you lord
[1:15:29] I didn't realize you were thinking of me
[1:15:33] we've seen that song you know about when
[1:15:35] he was on the cross I was on his mind
[1:15:39] that was reason is on the cross is
[1:15:42] because you and I were on his mind to
[1:15:43] pay the price right what about it what
[1:15:48] about life what about every day of your
[1:15:52] life and the things you realize the
[1:15:57] Prophet said it one day like this and I
[1:15:59] love to quote it he said our thoughts in
[1:16:01] heaven are louder than our words on
[1:16:03] earth with our mouth guns a whole lot on
[1:16:05] earth right in order to blabber a lot
[1:16:08] and has a lot of things to say but what
[1:16:11] about he he thought of it before you
[1:16:13] ever said it it's not going to be a
[1:16:16] Judgment Day when it comes up and God's
[1:16:18] got to put on the screen you know
[1:16:20] that a judgment he has to put up on the
[1:16:23] screen and said did you say that no
[1:16:26] he'll just bring it to your thoughts and
[1:16:27] there it is he doesn't have to put it up
[1:16:31] in front of us to tell us what we done
[1:16:32] we'll know our thoughts remember the way
[1:16:38] the Prophet expresses is not going to be
[1:16:40] the center at judgement it's not going
[1:16:42] to be no problem he's going to walk
[1:16:44] across and see who he is and know who is
[1:16:46] but what about that God that Jesus was
[1:16:48] talking about over should have not I
[1:16:50] cast out Devils and I named have not I
[1:16:52] done these things he say depart from me
[1:16:53] I never knew you but that'd be a
[1:16:56] horrible situation to spend all your
[1:16:58] life preaching the gospel and get up at
[1:17:02] the end of it and find out you're still
[1:17:04] lost you don't sound too good no because
[1:17:11] I don't make it too good we've been
[1:17:15] taught all of her life to become a
[1:17:16] Christian that takes care of all of our
[1:17:18] troubles no sir that's not right when
[1:17:22] you become a Christian the devil gonna
[1:17:23] point everything in the world he's got
[1:17:24] at you he's gonna throw everything in
[1:17:29] front of you you're gonna fight your way
[1:17:33] all the way when you become a Christian
[1:17:35] when you're of the devil you're just in
[1:17:38] his world and doing what he's done you
[1:17:39] remember that can I touch your mind
[1:17:42] actually just a little bit can you
[1:17:43] remember when you used to be in the
[1:17:44] world once you were doing you know what
[1:17:48] you're thinking right what about God
[1:17:54] thinking you see them is that real
[1:18:03] not mythologies in dollars he's real
[1:18:09] if you ever get it to the point to find
[1:18:11] out how really really is you will stop
[1:18:15] your thoughts and ideas of things I know
[1:18:19] a lot of people never experienced things
[1:18:21] to where they can see the reality of a
[1:18:24] living God but why not if you conceal -
[1:18:28] see yourself and know where you're at
[1:18:30] why can't you do it do you have to have
[1:18:31] some kind of a way or something for
[1:18:33] somebody telling you we love to listen
[1:18:35] to the Prophet telling about the way God
[1:18:37] done and told him this and told him that
[1:18:39] and would discern out the people in the
[1:18:41] congregation and tell them all I don't
[1:18:43] have to worry about it you see my Bible
[1:18:46] didn't die when the prophets died
[1:18:49] Hebrews 4:12 is still the same today
[1:18:52] that the word is a discerner of the
[1:18:54] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:18:56] I just don't have the ability to throw
[1:19:00] it back to you and tell you what you're
[1:19:02] thinking and I don't want it the times
[1:19:05] that I've had that I don't want it I
[1:19:08] don't want nothing like that because I
[1:19:11] don't want to know your thoughts I want
[1:19:14] to go away from you thinking that you
[1:19:15] enjoyed what I've had to say today
[1:19:16] instead of wandering her you know well
[1:19:19] he just keep trying to convert us ain't
[1:19:22] trying to convert nobody because it
[1:19:25] wouldn't do them good for me to convert
[1:19:27] he'd be about like it was in the old
[1:19:29] days when they told that you know they
[1:19:30] could pay for their sins and then walk
[1:19:33] this man walked up to this pillar and he
[1:19:35] said he was drunk laying in the street
[1:19:38] and he said I'm one of your converse he
[1:19:42] said you look like something I'd convert
[1:19:48] it wasn't God to convert it he just
[1:19:51] converted to a thought or an idea of a
[1:19:53] mankind and believed it how real is your
[1:19:57] God
[1:20:02] sometimes just take a moment you're in
[1:20:05] the bathroom you know once you spend
[1:20:07] more time shaving and doing of it you
[1:20:09] know that there's actually proven that
[1:20:10] there's more muscles strained in the
[1:20:12] bathrooms and there are out here
[1:20:14] weightlifting it's it you're crazy
[1:20:20] there's more muscle strained in the
[1:20:23] bathroom you're up in front of the
[1:20:27] mirror come on guys and you go look at
[1:20:29] this because my physique look a little
[1:20:33] loose then you turn around there's a big
[1:20:35] village thing oh let me turn sighs if
[1:20:36] you get this it away
[1:20:38] you'll tear up more muscles right away
[1:20:41] and you will out working out trying to
[1:20:45] get you to think and to get you to think
[1:20:48] of how real God is because he knows all
[1:20:55] of those thoughts before we ever have
[1:20:56] them you know what I love about him he
[1:21:04] can never have a new thought and all of
[1:21:05] his thoughts are eternal but you know
[1:21:07] like I said to her the other night about
[1:21:08] it some way then for me to say Father
[1:21:11] forgive me of my sins according to the
[1:21:15] Bible that says that my sins are put in
[1:21:17] the seal his forgetfulness never to be
[1:21:21] remembered again and he says as the far
[1:21:23] as the East is from the West
[1:21:25] see the reason it says that way you got
[1:21:27] a north and a south that's two poles you
[1:21:30] go so far and do you know stops it's
[1:21:33] north and south but when you say east to
[1:21:36] west you just start going west and Ida
[1:21:38] while you're coming back east there's no
[1:21:41] ending to it that's why it says in the
[1:21:44] Sea of his forgetful as he puts my fins
[1:21:46] you even know what to do that he has to
[1:21:50] have amnesia is that the word of today
[1:21:53] you know amnesia means you lose your
[1:21:55] mind I don't believe God lost his mind
[1:21:57] but he agreed and stated it and when he
[1:22:01] stated it that my sins would be in this
[1:22:03] interval let's see if we're get fulness
[1:22:05] that could never be remembered against
[1:22:06] me all I got to do is ask him to forgive
[1:22:09] me
[1:22:15] we think that we're going to hell
[1:22:17] because of this that or the other we're
[1:22:18] going to hell because we do not believe
[1:22:21] God in His Word if we believe him he'll
[1:22:25] make a way for everything you say yeah
[1:22:27] but I've done sin too long I've done
[1:22:29] this I've done that there's no such
[1:22:31] thing because you're still a human being
[1:22:32] that's a mortal alive you say yeah but
[1:22:37] but the Lord told me I was lost could
[1:22:41] have been the devil telling you that -
[1:22:45] you mean you don't believe it I believe
[1:22:47] in ascending away your day of grace
[1:22:49] right but as long as you're wanting to
[1:22:53] be saved there is no sin in a way of
[1:22:56] your grace it's when you come to the
[1:23:01] point you don't want to be saved no more
[1:23:02] and it's over with but think about it
[1:23:06] Church the point of and trying to get
[1:23:08] trying now to get God in his mind not at
[1:23:13] you and I was sitting back up in heaven
[1:23:15] with him no it was in his mind it was in
[1:23:22] his mind of what he was going to do with
[1:23:24] what the world would be like and what we
[1:23:25] would be like why does the Bible says
[1:23:29] you that you can't take one cubit
[1:23:32] however it is you can't add no now when
[1:23:35] today when the women cut you know men -
[1:23:37] excuse me that colors are higher but
[1:23:40] according to the Bible it says you can't
[1:23:41] do that but you can't add a cubit you
[1:23:46] can't do this can't do that about your
[1:23:47] heart when it tickles me is when you see
[1:23:52] the sisters and they dine it pretty good
[1:23:54] and then it gets into the scout and then
[1:23:58] all the other starts coming out and you
[1:23:59] look at the scalp as they go bonza you
[1:24:04] finding out the color that was original
[1:24:06] is down in below there so you can't add
[1:24:10] to it or take away right you say well
[1:24:13] you don't believe now ask your business
[1:24:14] and just say the Bible says don't cut it
[1:24:17] don't say nothing about coloring it
[1:24:19] don't cut it
[1:24:20] oh that's where it's real all right
[1:24:23] but listen he say that thousand people
[1:24:28] are jumping well I didn't say it the
[1:24:30] Bible did
[1:24:31] now he's causing you to think what I
[1:24:36] want you to do right now is to do one
[1:24:38] thing from the or anybody else is to
[1:24:41] think about how real God is come on
[1:24:43] musician think about how real God is and
[1:24:51] how he's trying his best to speak to
[1:24:54] your heart he's trying to speak to the
[1:25:00] inner part of you to get you to think it
[1:25:07] gets you to realize that you need a
[1:25:10] Savior what's the purpose of all things
[1:25:14] of God coming was to save mankind yeah
[1:25:21] but I've got too many things to give up
[1:25:22] to be you don't have to give up a thing
[1:25:24] to be a Christian you just become a
[1:25:28] Christian and it'll give up everything
[1:25:29] you don't have to quit this quit that
[1:25:35] you just let God come into your heart
[1:25:37] and your soul and he'll take care of it
[1:25:39] that's Christianity Chris we felt we
[1:25:42] teach Christianity you don't smoke you
[1:25:44] don't drink you don't chew you don't do
[1:25:46] this I smoke all I want to out you all I
[1:25:53] want to I drink all I wanted
[1:25:54] why because something happened to me a
[1:25:57] long time ago they took away that
[1:26:00] problem the Indies is coming to live and
[1:26:08] you're not we're trying to be a
[1:26:10] Christian and accept Jesus Christ
[1:26:15] that sounds funny why not quit trying to
[1:26:20] be a Christian and just accept Jesus
[1:26:23] Christ as your Savior because you're
[1:26:25] going to try to do everything you can by
[1:26:27] your mind and the iviews of your mind
[1:26:29] and you're going to try to say I can
[1:26:31] quit this I can quit that and you know
[1:26:33] what happened the lifetime you quit you
[1:26:40] know some of you that smoked and
[1:26:42] everything else you took in cigarettes
[1:26:43] and you throw them down across the field
[1:26:45] oh hang on smoke no more about three
[1:26:50] hours later you were out running in the
[1:26:51] yard looking for the Ducks
[1:26:53] and we old enough to remember them words
[1:26:56] you know what a duck is is what's left
[1:26:58] over from the cigarette the thing you
[1:27:00] throw away from the cigarette that you
[1:27:02] don't smoke all of it you throw it away
[1:27:03] that's called a duck while it's old
[1:27:05] commerce and you're out in New York
[1:27:06] trying to dick them things back up why
[1:27:08] because that demon is inside of you is
[1:27:10] crying out for smoke you know what all
[1:27:15] you got to do is just accept Jesus
[1:27:19] Christ and let him take care of it and
[1:27:23] it won't be anything that it won't be
[1:27:29] any part that you're trying to live it's
[1:27:31] not the head of Paul said it's not I'll
[1:27:33] Utley with the Christ that liveth in me
[1:27:36] he said in life that I now live I live
[1:27:39] by the faith of the Son of God I make
[1:27:44] this statement and people look at me I
[1:27:46] say I don't want you to be good now like
[1:27:49] alcoholic anonymous and stuff like that
[1:27:51] wants you to be good you make a good
[1:27:53] neighbor you know but that's no such
[1:27:55] thing in Christianity I don't want you
[1:27:57] to be good I want you to become
[1:27:58] born-again it'll take care of all the
[1:28:01] other things you're a funny preacher I
[1:28:05] agree with you but is it true just
[1:28:08] accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and
[1:28:10] let him come they didn't get into that
[1:28:12] mind because remember before the
[1:28:15] foundation of the world if you believe
[1:28:18] in what I try to bring that before the
[1:28:20] foundation of the world he was sitting
[1:28:22] there thinking about all the things that
[1:28:24] would ever happen in this world
[1:28:26] now let's be more personal to this for a
[1:28:30] second you realize you came here a lot
[1:28:33] of you came for baby dedication a lot of
[1:28:37] you older ones came because of this or
[1:28:39] that or the other some reason you
[1:28:41] realize God before the world knew
[1:28:42] exactly who's going to be here and you
[1:28:45] exactly who was going to be sitting
[1:28:46] where you're sitting and you exactly
[1:28:48] what I was going to be saying how do you
[1:28:52] believe God that real because that's the
[1:28:55] way I believe it if he gives us dogs and
[1:29:00] we transmitted his words remember God
[1:29:05] back there in Moses when Moses was sent
[1:29:08] out you know dart said to Egypt his
[1:29:14] words plagued Egypt Ryan broke flies
[1:29:17] fleas frogs but you know how it came he
[1:29:23] got the thought from God it was not a
[1:29:28] word
[1:29:29] God was leaving it up to Moses to speak
[1:29:32] it Moses said let there be flies and
[1:29:41] flies came because that was God's
[1:29:46] thought given to Moses don't worry about
[1:29:51] speaking what you believe to be true
[1:29:53] yes but brother difference you think you
[1:29:56] could be wrong about this out of the
[1:29:57] other why would I even think the
[1:29:58] thoughts are being wrong if God is real
[1:30:01] he'll correct me and he'll bring me to
[1:30:04] the right truth of it but I'm trying to
[1:30:08] just get down to the inside of you and I
[1:30:10] to think about how real God he is and
[1:30:12] how he wants to come and live in English
[1:30:14] this is not a good thought well I've had
[1:30:16] good thoughts and I I tried it for a
[1:30:18] little while and I didn't do no good
[1:30:19] that's what it was you're trying but you
[1:30:24] sit down and ask him to take over
[1:30:31] and see if he won't come and deliver you
[1:30:34] from view probably the staying together
[1:30:37] what will happen number 55
[1:30:40] number 55 the black notebook you might
[1:30:44] have a need the alders open god is good

[1:34:06] his clothing and you give it to the
