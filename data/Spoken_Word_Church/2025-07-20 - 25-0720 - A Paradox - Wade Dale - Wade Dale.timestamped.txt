[0:01] The walls of Jer
[0:06] and golden street.
[0:11] Why should I be present?
[0:15] Why should I enter in
[0:19] after all the sinful living
[0:24] and the wicked one I'm
[0:29] in the presence of Jehovah
[0:34] as I stand before the throne
[0:39] the accuser of the bre
[0:43] starts to ring
[0:45] the things I've done.
[0:48] As I hear the awful charges,
[0:54] a question f my mind.
[0:58] Why should not be placed in hell to
[1:04] suffer for our time
[1:09] is true love.
[1:14] That's all I have to be is through the
[1:19] love
[1:23] that Jesus shed for me.
[1:27] Not by works of my own rightousness.
[1:31] Oh filthy rags are they loving a battle
[1:37] rug tree hanging on
[1:44] this is my only
[1:49] fruit of
[1:56] a valley
[1:58] and I see there's no way Now
[2:02] the winds of sorrow threaten me and turn
[2:08] my world around.
[2:11] That's when I look to Jesus
[2:15] and the price he paid for me.
[2:19] I can lift my hands in praise to him and
[2:24] shout the victory.
[2:29] is true love.
[2:34] That's all I have to
[2:37] love.
[2:39] Love
[2:41] that Jesus shed for me.
[2:45] of my works. So my own rightousness
[2:50] or fil.
[2:54] But because of that
[2:57] tree hanging on the calary.
[3:03] This is my only
[3:08] is through the blood.
[3:12] Oh, precious is the glow that makes me
[3:20] white as snow.
[3:22] No other felt I know
[3:28] is true.
[3:31] [Music]
[3:33] Amen.
[3:41] You want to serve silver.
[3:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be in the house of the
[3:57] Lord this morning.
[3:59] &gt;&gt; Good to see each one of you. We've
[4:02] had a wonderful weekend and
[4:04] many we all look forward to coming up
[4:07] here this weekend and
[4:09] it's hard to believe it's
[4:13] Amen.
[4:17] Is that good?
[4:20] Technology
[4:22] told me there's two things I look
[4:24] forward to when we get on the other
[4:25] side.
[4:27] uh we don't we won't have to have neck
[4:29] ties and technology.
[4:33] I told him I said we we have robes of
[4:35] white robes of his righteousness and
[4:38] there's no neck ties involved. So I
[4:41] appreciate that. Look forward to that.
[4:44] But you know God's blessed us on this
[4:46] side and we're here to worship the Lord
[4:48] and
[4:50] lift him up this morning and praise his
[4:52] name.
[4:54] It's good to see each one of you and we
[4:56] just really enjoy the fellowshipping
[4:58] with brother Andre and the in the church
[5:00] here and it's just a wonderful
[5:03] atmosphere just
[5:05] all part of the same body, same family
[5:09] and I want to say I appreciate the
[5:11] sisters singing this morning and
[5:13] &gt;&gt; and uh also want to say I appreciate
[5:15] brother Albert leading singing. Amen.
[5:19] &gt;&gt; You know,
[5:21] &gt;&gt; you have people that stand up here
[5:23] constant, consistent, and sometimes
[5:25] they're overlooked,
[5:28] &gt;&gt; but you know what? Where would it be
[5:30] without each member of the body of
[5:32] Christ?
[5:32] &gt;&gt; We all have our parts to play. So, we
[5:34] appreciate that, Brother Albert.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. This morning, we're going to sing
[5:38] the song, Where could I go but to the
[5:40] Lord in the key of G. Amen.
[5:45] Living below
[5:49] in this old sinful world
[5:54] hardly a comfort can afford
[6:02] striving
[6:04] alone
[6:06] to face temptation. Lord,
[6:11] where could I go? Back to the Lord.
[6:19] Where could I go?
[6:23] Oh, where could I go?
[6:28] Seeking
[6:29] a reuge for my soul.
[6:37] needing
[6:38] a friend
[6:40] to help me in the end.
[6:45] Where could I go but to the Lord?
[6:51] [Music]
[6:53] And life here is grand
[6:57] with friends I love so dear.
[7:02] comfort I get from God's own word.
[7:11] Yet when I face
[7:14] the chilling hand of death,
[7:19] where could I go back to the Lord?
[7:28] Where could I go?
[7:31] Oh, where could I go?
[7:36] Seeking a refuge for my soul.

[9:53] in his arms.

[27:05] at this time.
[27:09] I don't see.
[27:11] Sister Linda, the boys aren't here
[27:13] today.
[27:15] I got a little buddy named Josiah,
[27:18] and he sang he sang my song. He learned
[27:21] to sing my song. And so, we're going
[27:24] we're going to sing it this morning. But
[27:26] uh
[27:28] I was going I was going to ask him to
[27:30] come sing this morning with me, but he's
[27:31] not here. But uh everybody everybody
[27:34] knows everybody knows the song. And
[27:37] before brother Wade comes this morning,
[27:38] we're going to sing Paul and Silas.
[27:41] Everybody everybody knows the song. And
[27:44] we're going to worship the Lord for a
[27:45] few minutes. And just clap your hands,
[27:48] raise your hands, whatever you feel like
[27:49] doing this morning. Worship the Lord as
[27:52] we sing. Well, you've heard the story
[27:56] of Paul and Silas,
[27:59] how they were bound and thrown into
[28:02] jail.
[28:04] They kept on praying.
[28:06] They didn't worry.
[28:09] They were serving a God that could not
[28:13] fail.
[28:14] Well, on about midnight,
[28:17] God sent an earthquake
[28:20] where the whole foundation
[28:23] began to shake.
[28:26] Those prison doors blew open wide
[28:31] and Paul and Silas stepped outside.
[28:35] Yes, he'll deliver me in my time of need
[28:41] like those Hebrew children from that
[28:44] fire. He freed and he fed 5,000 with two
[28:50] fishes and bread and he walked on the
[28:53] water and he raised the dead. Well, he
[28:57] stood by Daniel in the lion's hand. He
[29:02] saved over Moses from Pharaoh's men.
[29:08] Open the eyes of the blind to see.
[29:13] I know that he'll deliver me.
[29:17] Now it was David,
[29:20] my God delivered.
[29:22] When before Goliath made it stand,
[29:27] he took no armor. He took no weapons,
[29:33] just five stones and a sling in his hand
[29:38] as he went running
[29:40] to meet that army. He met that
[29:44] Philistine man that stood mighty and
[29:48] tall.
[29:50] He said, "I come in the name of the
[29:53] Lord."
[29:55] And oh, that mighty man did fall.
[29:58] Yes, he'll deliver me in my time of me
[30:04] like those Hebrew children from that
[30:08] fire. He freed and he fed 5,000 with two
[30:13] fishes and bread and he walked on the
[30:16] water and he raised the dead when he
[30:20] stood by Daniel in the lion's d. He
[30:26] saved old Moses from Pharaoh's men.
[30:31] Open the eyes of the blind to see.
[30:36] I know that he'll deliver me.
[30:40] Now it was David. My God delivered.
[30:45] When before Goliath he did stand,
[30:50] he took no armor. He took no weapons,
[30:56] just five stones and a sling in his
[30:59] hand.
[31:00] As he went running
[31:03] to meet that army, he met that
[31:07] Philistine man that stood mighty and
[31:10] call.
[31:12] He said, "I come in the name of the
[31:16] Lord."
[31:17] And oh, that mighty man did fall.
[31:21] Yes, he'll deliver me in my time of need
[31:26] like those he grew children from that
[31:30] fire. He freed and he fed 5,000 with two
[31:35] fishes and bread and he walked on the
[31:39] water and he raised the dead. When he
[31:42] stood by Daniel in the lion's den, he
[31:48] saved old Moses from Pharaoh's men.
[31:53] Open the eyes of the blind to see.
[31:58] I know that he'll deliver me. As brother
[32:02] comes this morning, he'll deliver me in
[32:06] my time of need.
[32:10] children
[32:11] [Music]
[32:14] 5,000 with his fishes and bread. And he
[32:19] walked on the water and he raised the
[32:22] dead while he stood by Daniel and lions.
[32:29] He saved all Moses from Pharaoh's men.
[32:33] Same God.
[32:35] Same God here today. I to see. Sing it
[32:38] one more time. Oh, turn around, shake
[32:40] somebody's hand, and say, "God bless
[32:42] you. Good to see you today." Oh, he'll
[32:44] deliver me in my time of need.
[32:51] From that fire he breathed, fed 5,000
[32:56] with his fishes and bread,
[33:00] walk on the water, and he raised the
[33:03] dead. Well, he stood by Daniel in that
[33:08] lion's den.
[33:13] Pharaoh's men
[33:15] open the eyes of the blind to see.
[33:20] I know that he'll deliver me.
[33:25] You believe that? Same God, same one,
[33:29] same Holy Ghost inside of you did every
[33:31] bit of that. Amen.
[33:34] We believe it was the same person,
[33:35] right? We don't believe it was two or
[33:37] three different people. It was the same
[33:38] God.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; That delivered them. We'll deliver you
[33:40] today. Well, good to be in the house of
[33:42] the Lord. Good to be back.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; Always a pleasure.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; And uh I want to thank all the church
[33:49] here in in Irwin for for putting up with
[33:52] us for a few for a few days. And uh and
[33:56] uh
[33:57] that's right. Okay. I wanted them to say
[34:00] okay.
[34:02] But um we sure have enjoyed it. Brother
[34:05] uh Andre and I were talking we should
[34:07] have done this a long time ago, but
[34:09] since we didn't, we're going to catch
[34:10] up. So, we're just going to keep doing
[34:11] it as long as the Lord allow us to do
[34:13] it.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; And uh we appreciate all of ours that
[34:15] came uh made the journey with us. And
[34:18] also uh Brother Luke, Sister Jan coming
[34:21] and being with us. And
[34:23] &gt;&gt; we've had a wonderful time. Yesterday
[34:25] was a wonderful day for us to get
[34:28] together and fellowship and uh and eat
[34:31] and then eat and then eat some more. So
[34:34] today we're going to try to eat a little
[34:35] bit of spiritual food.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; So if you got your Bibles, let's go
[34:38] right straight into the word of God.
[34:40] It's going to be kind of a a paradox
[34:43] today. We're going to u uh go to 1
[34:46] Corinthians 6
[34:50] verse 9.
[34:52] And we greet you again in the name of
[34:54] the Lord from Spoken Word Church there
[34:56] in Lulu. They're live streaming in now
[34:59] and and uh not having service, but
[35:03] again, we appreciate Brother Andre
[35:04] opening up his church for us and uh to
[35:08] speak and I was talking to uh brother
[35:11] Jackie and
[35:13] and uh brother Albert, I wondering how
[35:16] long we've been, how long this place had
[35:17] been here. We started coming I think in
[35:19] 1974
[35:20] and we were all a lot younger than we
[35:23] are now but um a lot of waters went
[35:26] under the bridge. We've had a lot of
[35:28] trials, troubles, tribulations,
[35:31] went out in the world for a little
[35:33] while. Lord brought us back. Now we've
[35:36] come back full circle to a place that we
[35:39] really enjoyed being here
[35:41] &gt;&gt; during that time that we were uh coming
[35:43] up here uh rather often uh back then in
[35:47] the in the 70s. So we sure appreciate
[35:50] this place. I believe God set it aside
[35:52] for a reason because there's a bride
[35:54] here.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; God's going to take care of his own
[35:57] kids. God's going to take care of his
[35:59] bride.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Satan's not going to take care of them.
[36:01] I promise you that.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; God's going to take care of his own
[36:04] children. And today I want to speak to
[36:06] you today a little bit and show you that
[36:09] we are looking at a paradox. Let me tell
[36:12] you before we get started. We're going
[36:13] to look at the Apostle John today. Now
[36:16] this not John the Baptist. All right?
[36:19] This is the Apostle John.
[36:22] Not John the Baptist. So when I say
[36:24] John, I mean who?
[36:25] &gt;&gt; The re
[36:26] &gt;&gt; the revelator. John the revelator. The
[36:29] one who went to Patmas. Okay. One more
[36:31] time. John the
[36:32] &gt;&gt; revelator.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. But we're going to get
[36:35] started here first and then we'll move
[36:36] our way there and then uh let's see what
[36:39] the Lord has for us. So let's bow our
[36:41] heads before we get started. I know we
[36:42] all have needs to uplift our hands. We
[36:44] have sick among us. We have our um
[36:47] friends and family that are not serving
[36:49] the Lord. We all have those needs. So if
[36:51] you'll raise your hand before the Lord,
[36:53] we'll say a prayer and get started.
[36:55] Father, Lord, with our hands up, Lord,
[36:57] mine, too. I pray, Lord, that that all
[37:00] the needs will be met in this building
[37:01] today. that Father, you will continue to
[37:05] bless us, lead us and guide us by your
[37:07] Holy Spirit. Lord, bless the local
[37:10] congregation here and brother Andre,
[37:12] Lord, keep him strong, Lord, and and
[37:14] bless his wife, Father, as she recovers,
[37:16] Lord. May may there be no nothing
[37:18] backwards. Everything will be forward
[37:20] from now on and the healing process will
[37:22] continue. Father, I pray for the ones
[37:24] that are weward, Lord. We know we all
[37:25] have one in our heart that we're
[37:27] thinking about that's not here today or
[37:29] or has backslid or has went away from
[37:31] the Lord or doesn't know you. Father, I
[37:34] pray that you would stir the water,
[37:36] Father, and and draw them to you, Lord.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Be with us today, Lord, as we speak your
[37:42] word, you do the speaking, Lord. May we
[37:46] hear from you and no one else. Father, I
[37:49] pray that you'd be with the ones that
[37:50] are in the foreign mission fields, Lord,
[37:53] a different one. Brother Aaron getting
[37:54] ready to leave in a few month going
[37:56] there to Honduras and different places.
[37:58] I pray that you'd be with him, Lord.
[38:00] Bless the ones, Lord, that are on the
[38:02] highways. We're going to have to all
[38:03] travel back home, most of us. So, be
[38:05] with us, Lord, as we travel back. Give
[38:07] us safe journey. And Lord, may we go
[38:09] away from this place, Lord, knowing that
[38:12] that we met you today. Not just human
[38:14] beings, but we met you through human
[38:15] beings today, Lord. And that this will
[38:18] all be done for your honor and glory. In
[38:19] Jesus name we pray.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, you have to pinch
[38:24] yourself for a minute because we got to
[38:25] get started, but we got we're going to
[38:27] end somewhere. All right. So, I'm we're
[38:28] going to talk about this whole
[38:29] congregation here for just a second. Is
[38:31] that all right?
[38:32] &gt;&gt; All right. No tomatoes.
[38:37] 1 Corinthians chapter 6
[38:40] verse 9.
[38:43] Know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[38:45] not inherit the kingdom of God? That's
[38:47] &gt;&gt; right. Be not deceived, neither
[38:50] fornicators, nor idolattors. Now, this
[38:52] is Paul speaking to his church in
[38:54] Corinthians, okay? He's not out on the
[38:56] street preaching. He's preaching to his
[38:57] people.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[39:00] &gt;&gt; All right. I'm going to make you say,
[39:01] "Amen."
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Weak. That was weak.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; I heard y'all shouting yesterday about
[39:07] certain things and ball games and all
[39:09] that stuff. So, let's shout for the Lord
[39:10] today. Neither fornicators, nor
[39:13] idolattors, nor adulterers, nor
[39:14] effeminate, nor abusers of themselves of
[39:16] mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor
[39:19] drunkards, nor revilers, nor
[39:20] extortionists shall inherit the kingdom
[39:23] of God. We're in trouble.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; And Paul says
[39:30] that's out in the barrooms and it's not
[39:32] affecting us today. Verse 11, he said,
[39:35] "And such were some of
[39:38] &gt;&gt; you, but you are washed, but you are
[39:40] sanctified. You are justified in the
[39:42] name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[39:44] of our God." Now, let's turn to Romans
[39:46] 8.
[39:48] Romans 8:1.
[39:51] Now, you heard what I said, what we
[39:53] were.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; But by the saving grace of Jesus Christ,
[39:57] this is what we are now.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Romans 8:1.
[40:02] You got it.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; I you it's usually on the screen. That's
[40:06] why I'm I'm going to wait till you turn
[40:08] you to the to the scripture. Romans 8:1
[40:12] Paul says, "There's therefore now what?
[40:15] &gt;&gt; No condemnation."
[40:17] &gt;&gt; I thought we just all felt condemned
[40:18] about two minutes ago,
[40:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Such were some of you. Well, now such
[40:23] are some of you now. There is therefore
[40:26] now no condemnation to them what? which
[40:28] are in Christ Jesus, who walked not
[40:31] after the flesh, but after the spirit.
[40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; For the law of the spirit of life in
[40:35] Christ Jesus hath made me free from the
[40:38] law of sin and death. For what the law
[40:41] could not do, and that it was weak
[40:43] through the flesh, God sending his own
[40:45] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[40:48] for sin condemned sin in the flesh.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; What? that the righteousness of the law,
[40:55] the law was righteous under Jesus
[40:58] Christ.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; The law condemned us. But when Christ
[41:02] came, he lived the law and gave us
[41:05] liberty to see the righteousness of the
[41:08] law. We're the only ones that can live
[41:10] the Ten Commandments. We're the only one
[41:12] that can live the Bible the way it's
[41:14] supposed to be lived. Is that not right?
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Am I in the right place?
[41:18] &gt;&gt; We still believe Brother Brandon was a
[41:19] prophet, right? We believe what he said
[41:20] about us. We're going to talk about that
[41:22] in just a little bit. All right. So,
[41:24] remember though the contrast 1
[41:26] Corinthians and then Romans 8:1 that the
[41:30] righteousness of the law might be
[41:31] fulfilled what?
[41:33] &gt;&gt; In us.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Us today. Us. No one outside today. Us.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; That about me fulfilled in us who walk
[41:41] not after the flesh but after the
[41:43] spirit. You may be seating as blessing
[41:45] to the reading of the word. But in
[41:47] Corinthians, Paul's giving us a a
[41:50] summation of what our life was before
[41:53] Christ.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; And now he's given us a summation in
[41:58] Romans 8 of our life being filled with
[42:01] Christ. All right? And we see that there
[42:04] was a law and we see that there was
[42:06] grace. But remember, there was grace in
[42:09] the law.
[42:11] If you killed somebody, you could go
[42:13] into a sanctuary city and you stay in
[42:15] that sanctuary city. Right? So there was
[42:17] actually grace in the law. But remember,
[42:20] if we stay under the law, the law kills
[42:22] us. So what did we have? We had to come
[42:25] to a place to where someone had to
[42:28] change this contrast of being these
[42:31] horrible people to there is therefore
[42:34] now no condemnation. And it's the same
[42:36] people,
[42:37] &gt;&gt; right? Amen. You're the same person that
[42:40] you were well maybe not 25 years ago.
[42:43] Maybe a little different, but you're
[42:46] still you.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; So, let's go to Hebrews 9
[42:53] because I want us to see something today
[42:55] that
[42:57] that we're going to get to the Apostle
[42:59] John and and see something. I believe
[43:01] it'll help you a little bit to uh to
[43:03] understand why we we do have trials and
[43:05] tribulations. We have strife. We have
[43:06] trouble. Uh, when you got saved and you
[43:09] got born again, Sister Kim, your bills
[43:11] didn't quit coming in the mail,
[43:14] right? Your car never broke down.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Your house never needed a repair,
[43:22] right?
[43:24] &gt;&gt; No, that ain't right
[43:27] in my Georgia language. No, that ain't
[43:29] right.
[43:31] Seems like you have more trouble. But
[43:33] listen, you'll know how to handle it
[43:35] better if you're a born again Christian.
[43:37] Instead of blaming other people, we just
[43:40] go ahead and blame oursel and we just go
[43:42] and move on with it. But look at Hebrews
[43:44] 9
[43:46] real quick and then we'll get set a
[43:49] basis here and then we'll get started.
[43:50] So Hebrews 9:15.
[43:56] For this cause he is the mediator of the
[43:58] New Testament
[44:00] that by means of death for the
[44:02] redemption of the transgression that
[44:04] were under the first testament. What was
[44:07] the first testament? The law.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Right.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; You got hold your Bible up. It says old
[44:17] &gt;&gt; testament.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; And you look in Matthew, it says New
[44:22] Testament. All right.
[44:24] Hebrews 9:15,
[44:27] for the transgression that was under the
[44:29] first testament, they which are called
[44:31] might receive the promise of eternal
[44:33] inheritance. Now, those people in first
[44:35] Corinthians didn't receive a promise of
[44:37] eternal inheritance while they were
[44:39] named as they were named as horongers
[44:41] and revilers and liars and all those
[44:42] different things.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; But receiving
[44:46] this testament, this New Testament, as
[44:49] you take communion, I know y'all take
[44:51] communion once a month like we do. Jesus
[44:53] said, "This is the new testament in my
[44:55] blood. This is the something new." But
[44:59] something had to happen for us to
[45:01] transition from from being this lost
[45:04] condition to being where even in John in
[45:07] Revelations 5, not being lost in his
[45:09] soul, but he was he was he was afraid
[45:11] that that he wasn't going to make it. He
[45:13] cried, and we'll read that in just a few
[45:14] minutes to where we go over to to the
[45:17] book of Revelations where he's shouting
[45:18] and praising God because of the things
[45:20] he sees.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Right? Right.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; So, what are you trying to say, brother
[45:22] Wayade? We're going to have trials.
[45:24] We're going to have tribulation. We're
[45:25] going to have trouble. We're all going
[45:26] to have We're all We all had to come out
[45:28] of the world. And then the world had to
[45:29] come out of us.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; All right. But when it did, it changed
[45:34] us by a new testament according to
[45:38] Hebrews 9:16. For where a testament is,
[45:41] there must also ne necessity
[45:44] be a death.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; All right. Um, my u wife's mother died
[45:50] seven years ago and we didn't read her
[45:53] will till she died.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; You don't read wills until people pass
[45:57] away.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[45:59] &gt;&gt; All right. You read a will after the
[46:02] person's dead.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Because it's not enforced when it's
[46:06] alive.
[46:07] Usually the usually the the will says
[46:09] after my after my departure u Gail gets
[46:13] everything I got you know or whoever
[46:15] your wife is they get or the husband
[46:17] they get everything you got well that's
[46:19] what's happening same Jesus come the
[46:20] same way for watch verse 17 for a
[46:23] testament is of force after men are dead
[46:26] so Jesus when he raised that cup on the
[46:28] communion night right before he was
[46:30] crucified he said this is the new
[46:32] testament in my blood and what that new
[46:34] testament was going to do was it was
[46:36] going to wipe the sin off of your life.
[46:40] When you get born again, your sin is
[46:42] gone.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; I want us to see that
[46:45] &gt;&gt; your sin in your soul is gone. You are a
[46:49] new creature.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; You have become a new testament because
[46:54] you had to die too.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; You had to die
[47:00] to have a testimony.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? That's right.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; So now continue verse 17. For a
[47:08] testament is a force after men are dead.
[47:11] Otherwise it is has it is of no strength
[47:15] at all while the testator liveth. In
[47:18] other words, the person or the one
[47:20] that's giving the testament or giving a
[47:24] uh the really the testator means someone
[47:26] that's giving something away or giving
[47:28] something. All right. Verse 18.
[47:31] whereupon neither the first testament
[47:34] was dedicated without blood. For when
[47:36] Moses had spoken every precept of to all
[47:40] the people according to the law, he took
[47:42] the blood of calves and of goats with
[47:43] water and scarlet wool hip sprinkled it
[47:48] all the people saying this is the blood
[47:49] of the testament which God hath enjoined
[47:52] unto me. And as we continue on we know
[47:55] what happened that the next day after
[47:56] Jesus said this is the new testament man
[47:58] my blood. What did he do? He died.
[48:01] He passed away.
[48:04] He's body died, but his soul didn't die.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that because we don't die.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Christians just fall asleep. Just
[48:12] departs from this world because we came
[48:14] here born in sin and and ch and we got
[48:17] to wait for a body change and we haven't
[48:18] got to it yet. So, as we pass away, the
[48:21] body stays here. The uh soul goes in
[48:24] another dimension and it's waiting.
[48:27] Thank God for a prophet that told us all
[48:29] this and literally went there to tell us
[48:32] these things so that we can come back
[48:34] and have assurityity. I can have
[48:36] assurityity that this is my testament
[48:39] &gt;&gt; that God gave us.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; He gave it to me. He didn't give it to
[48:43] nobody else. He gave it to me. He didn't
[48:45] give it to you. He didn't die for you.
[48:46] He died for me.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; All right. You got to figure out whether
[48:49] he died for you or not. Right?
[48:51] &gt;&gt; But if he did die for you, then there's
[48:54] something that we're going to look at
[48:57] that has been a mystery since the
[49:00] foundation of the world.
[49:02] And it's been in the minds and the
[49:03] hearts of others all down through the
[49:06] ages. But here today, we stand and we're
[49:10] looking, if you're looking down at your
[49:12] Bible, you're looking at your will.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, after somebody dies,
[49:18] that's the first thing they do. They
[49:20] probate it for 30 days and then they go
[49:21] to the court, they give it and they say
[49:23] if anybody's got anything against
[49:26] anything against you,
[49:29] then they can't read that will until
[49:31] that's taken care of.
[49:33] But today, when you get when you're born
[49:35] again of the spirit of God, there's
[49:37] nothing against you. Amen.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; So you can come and you don't have to
[49:41] wait 30 days for man to stand and read
[49:44] the will and say, "Okay, you get this
[49:45] and you get that and you know I I I
[49:48] bestow this on you and this on you." No.
[49:50] God gave us a will right here. 66 p 66
[49:53] chapters.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; This is the will. Every every Sunday we
[49:59] have a death.
[50:01] Come on.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; What is Sunday? Resurrection morning.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; We come to what? show that someone had
[50:09] died and now they've resurrected. I want
[50:10] to ask you a question today. Have you
[50:12] died and resurrected yet?
[50:16] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about even Christians.
[50:18] Have you died today
[50:20] &gt;&gt; of the things that you were living for
[50:23] yesterday and got rid of them? Because
[50:26] this will, if you don't understand what
[50:29] this will is, you'll be confused.
[50:32] Because this will today, as I'm looking
[50:34] at it today, right here, this is your
[50:36] adoption paper. This is your will. This
[50:38] shows that you're in the family. It
[50:39] shows you what you got. Ain't that what
[50:41] a will does? A will shows you what you
[50:43] are what you're given from the testator
[50:46] or from the person that's passed on. All
[50:48] right. So God gave us this will which
[50:51] brother Brown said his will is his what?
[50:52] Is his word.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; All right. So if his will is his word,
[50:55] this is where we must look at first to
[50:58] see what we have as a member of the
[51:05] bride of Jesus Christ.
[51:07] But remember,
[51:09] this Bible or this will is being read
[51:12] today down the street and over across
[51:15] the the river over there by
[51:16] Presbyterians, by Methodists, by
[51:19] Baptist.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; They're reading the same thing.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; But they're not getting the mystery of
[51:28] the will. Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Because they look at it um
[51:34] &gt;&gt; and they look at it and go, "Well,
[51:35] there's three."
[51:37] &gt;&gt; They go to Matthew 28:19 and say, "Well,
[51:39] we need to baptize in the Father, Son,
[51:41] and Holy Ghost."
[51:43] They look in the Bible and somewhere
[51:44] they find a trinity.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; It's not in there, but they they find
[51:48] it. So what do we today as the bride?
[51:51] We're standing here today, sitting here
[51:53] today.
[51:55] There's a mystery that must be unfolded
[51:58] just to the bride.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; It is not to the world. It is just to
[52:04] the bride.
[52:06] I mean, this is the greatest book that
[52:08] was ever written. There's there's more
[52:10] there's more Bibles in print. It's the
[52:12] greatest book that ever was, you know,
[52:14] New York Times bestseller. Ain't got
[52:16] nothing to do with this guy. What do we
[52:19] see the mystery of what this will has
[52:22] given us?
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Because God hid it
[52:27] &gt;&gt; in the will.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[52:31] &gt;&gt; I do because there wouldn't be so much
[52:33] confusion.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; There wouldn't be so much I believe in
[52:36] this and I believe in that. I believe
[52:37] it's all right if we do this. And you
[52:39] know, you've got what 13,000 now
[52:41] different denominations. I was listening
[52:43] to brother Brown the other day. He said
[52:44] 969. Well, I looked up, Sister Dorothy.
[52:47] I looked up on I I Googled it, so it's
[52:50] got to be right.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Got to be true. There's 13,000 different
[52:55] denominations now in the world. From 969
[52:59] that we quote from Brother Brandham to
[53:01] today, there's 13,000 different ways
[53:03] they interpret this. Well,
[53:06] &gt;&gt; 13,000
[53:08] different times. Now, God's not that
[53:10] confused.
[53:11] He wants a group of people to know
[53:13] exactly what he wants to give them, who
[53:17] to give it to, and for us how to use it,
[53:21] what God's given us.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[53:25] &gt;&gt; But we can't look at every We look at
[53:27] Corinthians and we go, "Man, these
[53:29] people are lost." And then Paul says,
[53:31] "Such were some of you." So, you got to
[53:32] figure out there's got to be a way or
[53:34] something's got to be a way to get us to
[53:35] Romans 8:1.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? This is simple, but
[53:39] we're getting to something here.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; All right. Romans 8:1 got us somewhere.
[53:44] And it had to be that testator dying.
[53:46] And for us to not read the
[53:50] Irwin Times, I don't know what Irwin
[53:52] paper they're about to do away with
[53:54] paper now, you know? I mean, it's all on
[53:56] it's all on the internet, so it's all
[53:57] got to be true.
[53:59] But hey, you got all these other things
[54:01] that you read and and sure we read
[54:03] self-help books and we read about
[54:05] different things and we do look up
[54:07] things online and and used to go to the
[54:09] library and you don't have to go to the
[54:10] library anymore. You just open up your
[54:12] phone almost and get any answer that you
[54:14] want. But is it the real answer?
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Is it the true answer?
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Is it man's idea or is it God? as as our
[54:23] brother was saying yesterday and I
[54:25] really really appreciate when I I I hold
[54:28] on to that quote probably more than
[54:30] anything else where brother Ram said,
[54:32] "Let's go back in the back part of God's
[54:34] mind."
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Let's take a stroll to where no one else
[54:39] has been
[54:41] &gt;&gt; and it's in the back part of God's mind.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; And bring it out. Now listen, I believe
[54:46] Brother Brandham went there,
[54:51] but I don't believe the door was shut
[54:52] where you can't go there.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; When he went back into the back part of
[54:57] God's mind, I believe he Isn't he
[55:00] supposed to tie up all the loose ends?
[55:02] Wasn't Wasn't this Malachi 4 person
[55:05] supposed to open the seals and open the
[55:07] door and open open? Well, guess what he
[55:11] did when he went there? He brought that
[55:12] part of God's mind, the eternal part,
[55:15] and he brought it to us.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; And he said, "This is it.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed."
[55:23] And then what is the great mystery in
[55:24] the Bible? It tells us plainly in
[55:27] Colossians, he says, "What is it? What
[55:29] is this great mystery? It's Christ in
[55:31] you, the hope of glory."
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Christ in you. If it Christ is not in us
[55:36] today, there is no hope
[55:40] &gt;&gt; of a resurrection or rapture. But
[55:43] there's going to be one, folks. I'll
[55:45] promise you. You can sit here today and
[55:47] you can close your eyes and you can say,
[55:49] "I don't believe what's going on. I
[55:51] don't believe this Christianity stuff. I
[55:53] don't believe this." Well, you are an
[55:54] unbeliever. That's why
[55:57] &gt;&gt; this will requires believing something.
[55:59] We had to believe Jesus Christ died.
[56:01] Were you there? Some of you are pretty
[56:03] old, but you're not that old. Right.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Right. We don't have any documentation
[56:08] except believing word of mouth. There
[56:11] was no pictures, no photographs.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; So that's why we become believers.
[56:17] And as we become believers, we do see
[56:19] the back part of God's mind. We do see
[56:22] because I believe that's where he wrote
[56:24] the Bible from.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; He wrote it from that part that no one
[56:28] else can understand. But he had to write
[56:31] it for everybody because he's not a
[56:33] respector of persons. He had to write it
[56:35] for every person on the face of the
[56:36] earth.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Even the devil,
[56:39] &gt;&gt; but the devil don't believe it.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; And people don't believe in this
[56:43] whatever, you know, you this religion
[56:44] thing and all this. I told the church
[56:46] the other day, I said, "It's just so
[56:48] hard now though, that um that
[56:50] Christianity has just become this big
[56:52] broad brush and you just take and brush
[56:55] it across the wall." And that's
[56:56] Christianity. You can you can have
[56:57] tattoos. You can have rings. You got
[56:59] earrings and all the you and you're a
[57:01] Christian.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go to church. You just
[57:03] have to believe that God's God and and
[57:06] then go about your business. Well, no.
[57:08] There is something in this will that
[57:09] tells me that's not right.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham said faith
[57:14] final resting place is not in the
[57:17] message of the hour.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; It's in the word of God
[57:24] &gt;&gt; which is the message of the hour. Amen.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. We're not doing away with that,
[57:28] which is the message of the hour.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; We would not understand this will had it
[57:34] not been for the message of the hour. I
[57:35] know a lot of you come out of
[57:36] denominations. Some came out of just
[57:38] come from the world. So, you were a
[57:40] denomination of your own self.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; But everybody came from somewhere with
[57:44] an idea.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Everybody came somewhere with an idea.
[57:50] You didn't come here to sit here today
[57:52] and your mind was blank. No. Your mind's
[57:54] running all the time,
[57:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:57] &gt;&gt; But why can't we see the back part of
[57:59] God's mind? It's a mystery that was
[58:03] withholden until we had a prophet come
[58:08] to help us see that this was the mind of
[58:12] God.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; And it was the correct way to do the
[58:16] correct way to live, the correct way to
[58:19] worship.
[58:22] That's right.
[58:24] We may have flaws. We may have problems.
[58:27] But I'll promise you one thing.
[58:30] You try your heart out to live this
[58:32] message as the prophet preached it
[58:33] according to the word of God. And that's
[58:36] the closest anybody on this earth is
[58:38] going to be to God is you living it the
[58:41] way you're supposed to live it according
[58:43] to the message of the hour.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; That's just it.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; There's nothing else,
[58:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:49] &gt;&gt; What are you going to put your hope in?
[58:51] You tell me what you going to put your
[58:52] hope in. finances, you just wait another
[58:55] year, maybe.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you just wait. There's going to be
[58:59] a crash like you never seen before. You
[59:02] know, when stock markets crash, the two
[59:05] years before they have their best years.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; I can remember when the stock market was
[59:11] like 9,000, it's 30 something thousand
[59:14] or 13,000. It's just astronomical.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; If you put your hope in that, guess what
[59:19] you're doing? You're throwing money in
[59:20] that thing and it keeps piling up. Well,
[59:22] all of a sudden one day that's going to
[59:24] get pulled out from under you and you're
[59:26] going to go back to zero. They I work
[59:28] for the post office and they have a uh a
[59:31] retirement plan, a 401k or something
[59:33] that's matching. But you can instantly
[59:36] look on your phone every day and find
[59:37] out how much you made or how much you
[59:40] lost.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Well, boy, when the stock market went
[59:43] down the other day, all of them were
[59:44] looking on their phones. They're like,
[59:45] "We lost $25,000." I said, "No, you
[59:48] didn't have it to begin with."
[59:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. You just had a small
[59:52] portion of that. You didn't lose
[59:53] $25,000. You didn't have it to begin
[59:55] with.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; It's just all on paper. Sam Walton said
[59:58] one time, he said, "It's just all on
[1:00:00] paper."
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; We don't even have cash in our pocket
[1:00:02] anymore.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; We didn't have paper.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; We got to build our hope on something
[1:00:09] besides that.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Something besides that. I like what one
[1:00:13] of the brothers at church said that
[1:00:17] brother Brown told us that this nation
[1:00:19] was gone.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; So we don't we don't need to get happy
[1:00:23] about the good things that are happening
[1:00:25] in this nation. We know what's going to
[1:00:26] happen.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; One day this nation's going to get it
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; because they turned down this right here
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; in English.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; They turned down God's prophet spoke
[1:00:39] English. brought it to the United States
[1:00:40] of America
[1:00:42] and turned it down. More denominations
[1:00:44] now than ever. You'd think if he'd come
[1:00:45] and and the way he tore those
[1:00:47] denominations down that that that they
[1:00:49] would be no more.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Well, there was plenty more.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; But there's a group of people. You and I
[1:00:58] are the only people,
[1:01:01] as I said before, that are going to see
[1:01:03] this event. Let's go to Matthew 16.
[1:01:10] Brother Andre, I can't see that far
[1:01:11] back, brother. Hey, there you go. Okay,
[1:01:15] he's sitting back there in the men's
[1:01:16] bathroom almost.
[1:01:22] Just don't let nobody go out the door.
[1:01:24] Okay.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. Matthew 16:28.
[1:01:30] We'll build up to something here. You
[1:01:31] love the Lord.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Listen, you've got you have got to make
[1:01:36] a decision. Amen.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; You can't walk this life wishy-washy.
[1:01:40] You've got to make a decision.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; And I'll promise you everything as the
[1:01:45] as the manifestation of the word comes
[1:01:48] forth,
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; you're going to manifest who you are
[1:01:51] also.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Hide it all you want to. Hide it any way
[1:01:55] you want to. When this word comes forth,
[1:01:58] there'll be a time when even the Bible
[1:02:00] says the sinner will not be able to sit
[1:02:02] in this congregation. Why? Their sins
[1:02:04] will be called out.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:02:07] Wow.
[1:02:09] Matthew 16 verse 28.
[1:02:14] Now, as we know, I know brother Andre is
[1:02:16] very versed in and I know he teaches
[1:02:17] y'all well, so I don't have to
[1:02:19] background about the dispensations of
[1:02:21] the son of man and son of God, son of
[1:02:23] David. Do I have to do that? No.
[1:02:27] Jesus came as the son of man.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; The son of man is what? God in a human
[1:02:33] vessel. Right.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; That was that was born without sex.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; He was God in human flesh. All right.
[1:02:44] When he when he ascended, he came back
[1:02:46] in a spirit form called the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:49] That was the son of God.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; The dispensation through the church ages
[1:02:54] was son of God. That's the Holy Ghost
[1:02:56] inside the believer. Everybody with me?
[1:02:59] Then it's promised
[1:03:01] in the book of Psalms, I believe it is,
[1:03:03] or over in the Old Testament, that that
[1:03:05] the son of David would sit on the throne
[1:03:07] ruling and and reigning the 12 tribes of
[1:03:09] Israel. So that's the son of David,
[1:03:12] which is we know it's Jesus Christ. But
[1:03:14] brother Brown told us right in in
[1:03:16] between the time of the son of God and
[1:03:18] the son of David dispensation, there's a
[1:03:21] small period of time that the son of man
[1:03:23] will come back into power.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; That's what we're living under today.
[1:03:27] You're living under a ministry that's
[1:03:29] not the son of God ministry. It's the
[1:03:30] son of man ministry.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Your flesh and my flesh are going to be
[1:03:35] literally changed by the word of God
[1:03:38] that you listen to.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Literally going to be changed. It's
[1:03:43] going to change us back. You say, "I
[1:03:45] don't see that." I see it.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Even though we get older, even though we
[1:03:50] look different because we get What are
[1:03:52] you looking at? I'm not looking at this.
[1:03:56] We're looking at that thing inside of us
[1:03:58] because remember that thing inside of us
[1:04:00] is greater than we are.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; It's eternal.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; This Linda,
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; yes.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; That real you never sinned a time.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; All the things we went through of all of
[1:04:12] our life that we can remember up here.
[1:04:14] If you're born again by the spirit of
[1:04:16] God, that eternal life is in your soul.
[1:04:18] You can't sin anymore.
[1:04:20] [Music]
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; You can't fall ever again.
[1:04:26] It's eternal. It's perfect. It's the
[1:04:28] thing we were singing about. It'll
[1:04:30] deliver you from the things that you
[1:04:32] need to be delivered from.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Matthew 16:28 says, "Verily, I say unto
[1:04:37] you, there will be some standing here
[1:04:39] which shall not taste of death till they
[1:04:42] see the what?
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Son of man."
[1:04:47] Son of man, not son of God. Son of man
[1:04:51] coming in his kingdom.
[1:04:53] Now, what kingdom is the kingdom of the
[1:04:56] son of man?
[1:04:58] Remember Jesus said, "I have no kingdom
[1:05:00] here. My kingdom is not of this earth."
[1:05:01] Right? When he was here the first time,
[1:05:02] the son of man, the son of God kingdom
[1:05:05] was the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:05:07] seven church ages that are that are most
[1:05:10] are gone now. Everything's about over
[1:05:12] with. We're right at the end of the
[1:05:13] seven church age. Everybody with me? All
[1:05:14] right. Don't fall asleep on me. I'll
[1:05:16] come down there and sit with you
[1:05:18] with an ink pen.
[1:05:22] the son. Then you got the son of God
[1:05:24] dispensation which is not to us,
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; That's to the Jews. We're going to be
[1:05:30] there, but you know what we're going to
[1:05:31] do? We're going to be sitting right
[1:05:32] beside of him
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; as the queen and him being the king.
[1:05:37] We're going to be the queen. Now, we got
[1:05:40] to get from here to here somewhere.
[1:05:43] Something's got to happen between this
[1:05:45] and this.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:48] I believe a lot of people believe I do
[1:05:50] believe a lot of people believe that
[1:05:52] just God is sitting up there in heaven
[1:05:54] and he's got an X on a day on a calendar
[1:05:57] that he's coming.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Sure, he knows when he's coming, but
[1:06:03] he's not coming till we get ready.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; He's not coming. What are you saying,
[1:06:08] brother Way? Well, I think that's what
[1:06:09] the world's waiting for. The world's
[1:06:10] waiting on for a day that he's going to
[1:06:12] split the eastern skies. He's going to
[1:06:14] walk down through just like they did.
[1:06:17] Now listen. If the second coming of I
[1:06:19] just got this. If the second coming of
[1:06:21] Christ, first coming of Christ was they
[1:06:23] thought that G that this Messiah was
[1:06:26] going to come down go through Jerusalem
[1:06:28] and stick spears in the Romans and
[1:06:30] destroy their kingdom and get rid.
[1:06:32] Right. Is that what they said?
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; That's what's happening now. They think
[1:06:36] that that Jesus is going to walk down
[1:06:38] through uh a big old cloud and walk down
[1:06:41] here and just, you know, take over every
[1:06:43] nation. That's not going to happen. I
[1:06:46] told the brother that one time. He was
[1:06:47] saying, he said, he said, "Oh, I can't
[1:06:49] wait that I can look up and see them
[1:06:51] eastern skies split and see Jesus walk
[1:06:53] down through there." And you know me.
[1:06:55] I said, "If you done that, you missed
[1:06:58] the rapture."
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; He looked at me. I said, "The Bible
[1:07:02] tells me that it's a secret.
[1:07:04] It's a secret catching away.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be I said when you see
[1:07:09] him I said that's where every eye will
[1:07:10] behold him. I said that's the judge.
[1:07:12] He's coming down to judge.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; I don't want him to come down to judge.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; He's judging us now.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; So there's a son of man coming in his
[1:07:21] kingdom. So what is the kingdom of the
[1:07:24] son of man? He couldn't over here be the
[1:07:27] kingdom, have a kingdom because he was
[1:07:30] the only person that was the son of man.
[1:07:33] Everybody with me? When Jesus was on
[1:07:35] earth, there was no Christian.
[1:07:38] There was nobody saved.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; You can say what you want to. Nobody got
[1:07:43] eternal life until Christ died, released
[1:07:46] that life
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; for it to come back into the believers
[1:07:51] on the day of Pentecost.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; All right? And that started the
[1:07:55] dispensation of the son of God.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; So he was standing in on here on earth
[1:08:01] and he said, "My warriors are not here
[1:08:03] or they would fight. My kingdom's not
[1:08:05] here." Where was his kingdom?
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; His kingdom was inside of him.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; His kingdom was waiting to get out. And
[1:08:15] on the day of Pentecost, 120 little
[1:08:18] kingdoms came forth.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:23] But he says there will be somebody
[1:08:25] people standing here. There'll be some
[1:08:28] standing here which shall not taste of
[1:08:31] death
[1:08:32] till they see the son of man coming in
[1:08:34] his kingdom. What is the kingdom of the
[1:08:37] son of man? You're looking at it.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; This is his kingdom. The kingdom of the
[1:08:44] son of man.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; We've been called out of denominations.
[1:08:47] We've been called out of different
[1:08:48] things. And we've been put into this
[1:08:50] kingdom of the son of man because
[1:08:52] there's got to be a time to where and
[1:08:55] we'll look at it with John and the two
[1:08:57] types with John because remember also
[1:09:00] John the revelator type the bride right
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; everybody knows that type John the
[1:09:05] revelator one man typed the whole entire
[1:09:07] bride. Now that's what the prophet says.
[1:09:08] Everybody with me?
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; All right. So John typed the bride. John
[1:09:11] the revelator. So whatever he goes
[1:09:14] through and sees we are. Yeah. Amen.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Whatever he goes through, because
[1:09:23] remember in Revelations 4:1, he's caught
[1:09:25] up. We'll read that in just a minute. He
[1:09:26] goes up in a rapture,
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; He's caught up to see what what is, what
[1:09:32] was, what was, what is, and is to come.
[1:09:34] All right, we'll get to that in just a
[1:09:36] minute because brother Brandon will tell
[1:09:37] you that John the Revelator saw it just
[1:09:40] as he lived it.
[1:09:42] So the spirit of John, the the Holy
[1:09:44] Ghost in John is projecting all the way
[1:09:47] down to where you're sitting today.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; If he lived through it, he didn't. We
[1:09:52] know he died in, you know, AD96 or
[1:09:54] somewhere in there. We we he's gone on.
[1:09:56] But there's a there's a group of people
[1:09:59] that's going to see that's not going to
[1:10:01] taste death according to Matthew 16 till
[1:10:04] they see the son of man coming in his
[1:10:05] kingdom. When the son of man comes in
[1:10:07] his kingdom, death will be destroyed.
[1:10:09] That's right.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Death will be destroyed in me and you.
[1:10:12] You got to believe that. You I'm getting
[1:10:14] older. That doesn't matter.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Sight and time is man's worst enemy.
[1:10:22] Looking at something.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; We've been in this thing for
[1:10:28] my brother Brown's been gone how many
[1:10:29] years? 60 some odd years. He's been
[1:10:31] gone. And here we're still here. But you
[1:10:33] know why we're still here? Because we're
[1:10:35] not all a complete body yet.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Right. But remember, there's got to be a
[1:10:39] group of people that's alive.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Alive.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Because remember, the resurrection was
[1:10:47] told to live people.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a group of people that
[1:10:51] is alive. To me, that's the kingdom of
[1:10:54] the son of man that we're living in and
[1:10:56] living through. But there's going to be
[1:10:58] a culmination to it.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Very soon.
[1:11:02] Matthew 17 verse1
[1:11:12] there there Matthew 17 verse1 this is
[1:11:16] Matthew 16:28
[1:11:19] ends if you look at your Bible it ends
[1:11:20] and I believe the next chapter starts
[1:11:22] Matthew 171 is that right
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; right
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; okay so he's it's it's continuing his
[1:11:27] thought Matthew is so and after six days
[1:11:30] it's kind of funny after six
[1:11:32] After six days, Jesus took Peter, James,
[1:11:34] and who?
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; John his brother, and bringeth them up
[1:11:38] into a high mountain apart. And he was
[1:11:41] transfigured before them, and his face
[1:11:43] did shine as the sun, and his raignment
[1:11:45] was white as a light. And behold, there
[1:11:48] appeared what? Moses and Elijah talking
[1:11:50] with him. Then after Peter said unto
[1:11:53] Jesus, "It's good for us to be here."
[1:11:55] Peter got a denominational idea. He
[1:11:57] wants to build three tabernacles. Well,
[1:11:59] the the the Lord shut him up. Said,
[1:12:01] "Behold, behold this my beloved son.
[1:12:03] Hear you him." And then there was nobody
[1:12:04] else seen but Jesus.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; All right. So now look, so remember one
[1:12:08] more time, John was a type. So John was
[1:12:10] there, right? John was there. Peter,
[1:12:12] James, and John. John was in that scene
[1:12:14] and saw Jesus being glorified.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Saw Moses and Elijah.
[1:12:21] Right
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; now, Brother Bam's going to tell us here
[1:12:23] in just a few minutes. I hope I brought
[1:12:25] this one. Yes, I did. where Moses is
[1:12:28] representing
[1:12:30] six church ages
[1:12:33] that slept because Moses died.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; And then Elijah, the messenger of the
[1:12:39] last day, his group, I'll read it to you
[1:12:42] right here.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; But remember in your back part of your
[1:12:45] mind, John was a type of the entire
[1:12:47] bride in the church ages.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; So what he went through is what we're
[1:12:55] going through. Right?
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; He didn't go through it. He he went
[1:12:57] through it in a vision,
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; but this is a reality.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, let me tell you
[1:13:04] something. In the past year, have you
[1:13:05] seen how much prophecy has been made
[1:13:08] known?
[1:13:10] We have a pope from the United States
[1:13:12] now,
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; which has been extremely quiet for the
[1:13:15] past few months. If you'll notice that
[1:13:17] he's not asleep in the Vatican, I
[1:13:19] promise you,
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; they're working on something. Then you
[1:13:23] got a man in the in the office now of
[1:13:26] the White House that's going to be
[1:13:28] Revelations 13. It's going to be the
[1:13:30] voice.
[1:13:31] What? That's going to give the power to
[1:13:33] the beast.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; You see the power the man's wielded
[1:13:36] already in the first six months he's
[1:13:38] been in office.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Not getting into politics, but that is
[1:13:43] what's happening according to Revelation
[1:13:46] 13. We see that happening. According to
[1:13:48] all these, we see everything coming to
[1:13:49] pass. We're living it. Amen.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; We're living. It's not prophecy anymore.
[1:13:54] Once a prophecy is made known and
[1:13:56] fulfilled, it's not a prophecy anymore.
[1:13:59] It's a reality.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram saw California sinking. Now,
[1:14:03] when that day when California sinks,
[1:14:05] that prophecy is over.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; So listen, Revelations chapter 4,
[1:14:11] Brother Brham said, "Look, paragraph
[1:14:13] 136. Jesus said, "Some of you standing
[1:14:16] here will not taste of death till you
[1:14:17] see the kingdom." Now, he said the
[1:14:19] kingdom of God. Now watch this. This is
[1:14:21] how the Lord worked on brother Brandham.
[1:14:23] And I hope he works on us ministers and
[1:14:25] all you too. He didn't say the right
[1:14:27] thing.
[1:14:30] Revelation chapter 4. I know I read this
[1:14:32] the other night. Some of y'all that um
[1:14:34] at church, he says until they until they
[1:14:38] see the kingdom of God coming in power,
[1:14:41] or see the son of man coming in his
[1:14:44] kingdom.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; He changed it because it was wrong.
[1:14:48] Brother Brandham was I'm not going to
[1:14:51] say that. Some people when you say
[1:14:53] brother Brandham was wrong, they get all
[1:14:55] upset about it, but he was a human.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; He was a human being just like me and
[1:15:00] you. But the Holy Ghost stopped him.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; How many times have you seen listen to a
[1:15:06] a message and and Brother Mar go uh uh
[1:15:09] uh you know what he's doing?
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is changing his thought.
[1:15:14] That's just the way I believe it, folks.
[1:15:16] I'm telling you. I believe he was so
[1:15:17] inspired by God till God wasn't going to
[1:15:20] let him. Especially when the seals open,
[1:15:22] he wasn't going to let him speak error.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; It was going to be the exact word of the
[1:15:28] will.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, brother Ram did preach
[1:15:32] that the white horse rider was the Holy
[1:15:33] Ghost. We've been through that before.
[1:15:35] But we've all had our ideas
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; about how this thing is going to happen
[1:15:41] and how these prophecies are going to
[1:15:42] happen. But there is a way that they're
[1:15:44] going to happen and that's the only way
[1:15:46] they're going to happen. Because when
[1:15:47] John saw what was going on and when he
[1:15:50] wrote that in the book of Revelations,
[1:15:51] that's the eternal word of God. It can't
[1:15:53] be changed. Not going to change. Never
[1:15:55] will change.
[1:15:57] All right. Now listen. So he changed it.
[1:15:59] Says, "See the son of man coming in his
[1:16:01] kingdom." Rather see the son of man
[1:16:03] coming in his kingdom. A few days after
[1:16:05] that, he took Peter, James, and John and
[1:16:07] went up on a high mountain and there was
[1:16:08] transfigured before them. Now watch.
[1:16:12] There was a transformation
[1:16:17] on a mountain.
[1:16:19] There was a transformation
[1:16:22] of the son of man. All right.
[1:16:26] Moses and Elijah were there. Listen to
[1:16:29] what the prophet said. Now watch.
[1:16:32] Over in this place, he saw the coming or
[1:16:36] the rehearsal.
[1:16:40] right?
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Or the rehearsal,
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; And what was the first thing he saw? The
[1:16:46] first thing he saw in the coming was
[1:16:48] Moses represented the dead saints that
[1:16:52] would be resurrected.
[1:16:55] Elijah was standing there. He said, so
[1:16:57] he interjected. Elijah was standing
[1:16:59] there.
[1:17:00] Oh, I want you to notice next paragraph
[1:17:02] what will take place. There was Moses
[1:17:06] first. That's all these six ages that
[1:17:10] slept.
[1:17:12] Six church ages.
[1:17:14] All right. He didn't say seven. Six
[1:17:16] church ages.
[1:17:19] Not only that, but Elijah was there. The
[1:17:22] messenger of the last day with his
[1:17:26] group.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Now, don't let your mind go wild and say
[1:17:31] that was brother Brandham standing on
[1:17:32] the mountain with Jesus and and Elijah,
[1:17:34] I mean Moses. It was not.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of Elijah. Everybody
[1:17:39] with me?
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was not there. Sorry.
[1:17:44] Anyway, not only that, but Elijah was
[1:17:46] there, the messenger of the last day
[1:17:48] with his group of the transfigured,
[1:17:54] the raptured,
[1:17:57] now in the future awaiting the coming.
[1:18:01] Now, what did he do? Because he said,
[1:18:03] "Some people will stand here." not will
[1:18:05] not taste death till they see the son of
[1:18:07] man coming in his kingdom and they seen
[1:18:09] the rehearsal of it. All right, continue
[1:18:12] on. Same same thing. Now listen, this is
[1:18:14] where we're going to get into a
[1:18:16] transition part of John because remember
[1:18:18] John type the bride. Everybody with me?
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; John type the bride.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; But now remember John is going to be
[1:18:25] like Moses though and type the bride in
[1:18:28] the six church ages
[1:18:31] because they're gone on.
[1:18:33] All right, everybody with me? Cuz
[1:18:35] brother, I'm I'll read it. I already
[1:18:37] read it to you one time. Here we go. I'd
[1:18:40] like to bring you to another thing.
[1:18:42] Verse one, I mean chapter 141. After
[1:18:45] Jesus died and buried in St. John 21:20,
[1:18:49] that's actually St. John 21:22. If you
[1:18:51] want to turn there and read it, we'll
[1:18:52] read it here in just a second. Some
[1:18:54] critics started this in the early day,
[1:18:56] right? While we're in this lesson, let's
[1:18:58] clean it up. Jesus had met with his
[1:19:00] disciples, fed them fish and bread upon
[1:19:02] the fire. As they went upon the bank,
[1:19:04] John leaned upon his bosom. And Peter
[1:19:06] asked a question, said, "What will
[1:19:08] happen to this man?" Jesus loved John.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus loved his bride. Jesus loved John.
[1:19:17] Every time I see John, I see me. I see
[1:19:19] the bride. All right.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Every time.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; What's going to be his estate? What's
[1:19:27] going to be his future? Now it's St.
[1:19:29] John 20 21 verse 22. Let's read it. And
[1:19:32] Jesus said unto them, "What is it to you
[1:19:34] if he tries until I come till I return?"
[1:19:38] What is it? That's this is brother Brown
[1:19:39] paraphrasing. What is it to you?
[1:19:42] Now watch John the person John did not
[1:19:47] see Jesus come back. He's in the grave
[1:19:49] right now.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; But remember, he is projected
[1:19:53] as the bride,
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; right? And tight.
[1:19:58] Jesus said that he was going to live. Uh
[1:20:01] the disciples made a mistake and I'm
[1:20:02] reading from brother Brandham. They said
[1:20:04] Jesus said he was going to live till the
[1:20:06] coming of the Lord. But Jesus didn't
[1:20:08] make no mistake. Right here in
[1:20:10] Revelations the 4th chapter, Christ kept
[1:20:13] his word. He brought John up into heaven
[1:20:16] and rehearsed the whole thing to him.
[1:20:18] Now who'd he bring up? He brought the
[1:20:20] bride. Now listen, you and I are not in
[1:20:23] a rapture right now, but we are in
[1:20:24] rapturing condition. As brother uh Joel
[1:20:28] said last night, the rapture's inside of
[1:20:30] you. It's working. It's like that
[1:20:32] butterfly. It's like that cocoon where
[1:20:34] all that mess is inside that cocoon.
[1:20:36] It's working and one day it's going to
[1:20:38] burst forth as a butterfly. All right,
[1:20:40] y'all with me?
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Okay. A transformation is taking place
[1:20:43] in all of us today. Either good or bad.
[1:20:46] You're either going to walk out of that
[1:20:47] door better or you're going to walk out
[1:20:49] that door worse.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; And you know how you do that? You come
[1:20:53] in here with sin. You come in here with
[1:20:55] the things of the world and the things
[1:20:57] you do.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; And if you don't want deliverance,
[1:21:00] you're going to walk out of that door
[1:21:01] and God's going to tell you one day,
[1:21:02] he's going to say, "I give you a chance
[1:21:04] to be delivered." Right there.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; But if you'll come here and get
[1:21:09] deliverance and go out that door, you'll
[1:21:11] go out that door a better person.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; We want to go out that door a better
[1:21:15] person. Who want who come in here wanted
[1:21:17] to go out bad?
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; You want to come in here and hear God
[1:21:20] tell us something
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; that we can take and hold on to? Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; To watch
[1:21:28] right here in Revelations the 4th
[1:21:29] chapter. God keeps his word. He brought
[1:21:31] John up into heaven and rehearsed the
[1:21:33] whole thing to him. Glory. He saw the
[1:21:35] preview. Now watch. Here's here's here's
[1:21:38] the quote. He saw it just as though he
[1:21:40] lived it on earth and saw the whole
[1:21:44] church ages come to pass right to the
[1:21:48] coming of the Lord. The whole book of
[1:21:50] Revelations. Now we continue on.
[1:21:51] Paragraph 145.
[1:21:54] See how infallible his promise is.
[1:21:57] James didn't do it. Peter didn't do it.
[1:22:01] John did it.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; One person. There's not two or three
[1:22:06] brides.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; There's one bride.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; And John typed that one bride. One man.
[1:22:11] John type the bride.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Peter's a great man. James is a great
[1:22:15] man. But God chose John
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; to write the book of Revelations and to
[1:22:20] write it as though he lived it on the
[1:22:23] earth.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Now listen, paragraph 145. He quotes the
[1:22:28] scripture again. What is it to you if he
[1:22:31] tries till I come and being that he said
[1:22:33] that he just chose John and took him up
[1:22:36] and showed him the whole thing before he
[1:22:38] died? Just like he lived the whole thing
[1:22:41] through. showed him the church ages, the
[1:22:44] coming of the Jews, the pouring out of
[1:22:45] the plagues, the vowels, all the
[1:22:47] different things, the rapture, the
[1:22:49] millennium, and the future home.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; That's a mouthful,
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; But if he typed the bride,
[1:22:59] he had to
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; because the bride's in the church ages.
[1:23:04] When the bride leaves, God goes to the
[1:23:06] Jews.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:23:09] The pouring out of the plagues is when
[1:23:11] we're gone. It's because we're not here.
[1:23:14] Listen, the reason this world's not
[1:23:15] falling apart today is cuz you're
[1:23:17] sitting there in a pew.
[1:23:19] [Music]
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; God's not going to destroy this world
[1:23:22] with his bride here.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; We're going to get out of here and then
[1:23:26] the plagues are going to really fall.
[1:23:28] But he saw the rapture, which is the
[1:23:29] bride. He saw the millennium, which is
[1:23:31] not to the bride, but we'll be in there.
[1:23:33] And then the future home will be where
[1:23:35] we live.
[1:23:37] Just as though he said it again, just as
[1:23:40] though he lived right through it.
[1:23:43] So maybe you'll read the Bible a little
[1:23:45] bit different now. When you read the
[1:23:47] book of Revelations, uh dad preached
[1:23:50] sermon many, many years ago or series on
[1:23:52] the book of Revelations and he called it
[1:23:54] the bride's book. And it is it's the
[1:23:56] bride's book.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; John's there. John's the one that wrote
[1:24:00] it.
[1:24:02] And it's either what's going to happen
[1:24:04] to us, with us, or because of us.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; One of those three is all the bride.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; One more quote and then we'll read
[1:24:13] scripture. We need to go to Revelations
[1:24:15] 5. Go ahead and turn there if you want
[1:24:16] to. Will,
[1:24:18] brother said, look, paragraph 147.
[1:24:22] Before his death, he was caught up in
[1:24:23] the spirit and seen things just as
[1:24:25] though he had lived it. Seen it all
[1:24:27] rehearsed. Thus he saw in a vision
[1:24:31] exactly what would have taken place and
[1:24:33] what did take place on earth from that
[1:24:36] time until the coming of the Lord showed
[1:24:38] it to him in a vision. All right. So
[1:24:41] let's go to Revelation
[1:24:43] chapter 5. Is everybody all right? I
[1:24:44] know it's hot in here. I'm sweating. I
[1:24:46] know some of you are already went to the
[1:24:47] land of Nod, but that's where Cain went.
[1:24:49] So be careful. Revelation
[1:24:53] chapter 5. Now remember John wrote the
[1:24:56] church ages. Maybe if you'll start
[1:24:58] flipping your Bible, you'll
[1:25:02] Maybe that's what we'll start doing at
[1:25:04] home instead of putting it on the
[1:25:05] screen.
[1:25:06] Make you look for it.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Maybe there's some action we need a
[1:25:11] little bit maybe.
[1:25:13] But remember John in Revelations 1, what
[1:25:16] did he do? He saw Christ. Saw all of his
[1:25:19] attributes. Saw all of his
[1:25:22] manifestations in Revelations chapter
[1:25:24] one.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:25:27] And he said it was like unto the son of
[1:25:29] man. A man standing in the seven golden
[1:25:31] candlesticks. One liken to the son of
[1:25:33] man clothed about with the cloud and all
[1:25:35] the different things. But he come to
[1:25:37] revelations 4 and it says and after this
[1:25:40] I looked and behold a door was opened in
[1:25:42] heaven. What brother said he was caught
[1:25:44] up in Revelations 4:1. So after the
[1:25:47] church ages there is a rapture. But
[1:25:50] remember this is a rehearsal. This is
[1:25:51] not the real thing yet.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; All right. This is not the real thing.
[1:25:55] We not I hope the rapture hadn't took
[1:25:57] place this morning,
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz we all missed it.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; All of us.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; So now, what is Revelations chapter 5?
[1:26:10] Brother Ram said Revelations chapter 5
[1:26:12] was the most sublime scripture in the
[1:26:14] Bible.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Why? Because something was happened.
[1:26:20] Something had happened to take us from 1
[1:26:23] Corinthians 6 that we read
[1:26:26] to Romans 8:1.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; There had to be a book.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; There had to be something taken which
[1:26:35] was we know what it was. We know it was
[1:26:38] the book, but we know it was a book of
[1:26:40] names. It was it was us. Because
[1:26:42] remember in a will to be specific in a
[1:26:45] will you can't just say I leave my
[1:26:49] children everything
[1:26:52] if there's four or five of you
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; they going to be a fight
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; right
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; we just humans going to be a fight but
[1:27:03] if it says specifically I give Gary I
[1:27:07] give Aaron I give Wade then that's what
[1:27:11] The testament has to that's what the
[1:27:13] will has to do. It enforces,
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Right. It enforc the the one enforces
[1:27:19] the will and gives Aaron whatever is
[1:27:21] written on here. Well, that's what
[1:27:22] Christ has then that's why that's his
[1:27:24] will. But his will is a mystery. It's
[1:27:26] been sealed
[1:27:28] until
[1:27:30] we look at Revelations 10. We'll look
[1:27:33] there in just a minute. But Revelation
[1:27:34] chapter 5, remember the book is closed.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Is everybody with me? The book is closed
[1:27:40] in Revelations 5. You can't listen. John
[1:27:45] has there's going to be another paradox
[1:27:47] here because down in verse 4, verse 3
[1:27:50] and 4, John said, "I wept. There's
[1:27:53] nobody could even look at it. I I I'm
[1:27:55] I'm distraught. I don't know what's
[1:27:58] going on."
[1:28:00] But you see him over in Revelations
[1:28:02] 10:1. He's eating a book. He's eating
[1:28:05] that same book, Brother Bob.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; He's eating the same book. It's not a
[1:28:09] different book. It's the same book he
[1:28:10] was scared of over here. He's eating it
[1:28:12] over here. That's
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Revelations five. And I saw in the right
[1:28:18] hand of him sat on the throne a book.
[1:28:20] Now remember, there's one sitting on a
[1:28:22] throne,
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to get into that for save
[1:28:26] time, but there was one sitting on a
[1:28:27] throne. That was the father.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; That was the father's throne. And he had
[1:28:31] the book because remember what happened
[1:28:33] in the garden of Eden. Brother Bram said
[1:28:35] God took the book back from Adam.
[1:28:38] That's right.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Held it,
[1:28:42] brought it here as Christ.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Is that with me?
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; That book was inside of that man called
[1:28:47] Jesus.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; This whole entire book was him.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Okay. This whole entire book was him.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; So, who had the book? He had the book
[1:28:56] because it was the book.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; And it was the book of names.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; My name and your name.
[1:29:05] But that book was sealed. No man could
[1:29:08] look at it. But Christ came and he said,
[1:29:10] "Hey, I'm going to go away, but I'm
[1:29:12] going to send somebody.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; I'm going to send a comforter. I'm going
[1:29:15] to send the Holy Ghost." And he's going
[1:29:16] to help you understand this, but I'm
[1:29:18] really not going to open it fully until
[1:29:22] the end time.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; That's what he says. Everybody with me?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Revelations 5. So, here's the paradox.
[1:29:30] We're going from 1 Corinthians 6 where
[1:29:32] we're all dead. We're all dead in t-
[1:29:34] trespasses and sin. We have no hope
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; to where in Revelations 8:1 we're
[1:29:39] shouting and praising. I mean Romans 8:1
[1:29:41] where we there's no condemnation.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; I'll promise you today when before when
[1:29:48] I started till this moment there has
[1:29:50] been a thought run through your mind
[1:29:52] that has condemned you.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Some of you shaking your head. Some of
[1:29:56] you are lying.
[1:30:01] I'll shake mine.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; And I saw in the right hand of him that
[1:30:07] sat on the throne a book written within
[1:30:09] and on the backside sealed with seven
[1:30:12] seals. So it was closed.
[1:30:14] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:30:16] with a loud voice, who is worthy to open
[1:30:18] the book and to loose the seals thereof.
[1:30:20] And no man in heaven,
[1:30:23] no man in earth, no man under the earth
[1:30:27] was able to open the book, neither to
[1:30:29] look at it.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; And I wept much. Who's I? John.
[1:30:36] I the bride. If I don't get this
[1:30:39] mystery,
[1:30:41] I'm not taking a rapture. Yeah.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; And I wept much because no man was found
[1:30:49] worthy to open and to read the book,
[1:30:52] neither to look there on. There's no
[1:30:55] hope.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; That's what John said.
[1:31:01] There's no hope for us until God reveals
[1:31:03] this word to us.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; There's no hope for us.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; And one of the elders said unto me, weep
[1:31:10] not. Behold, the line of the tribe of
[1:31:13] Judah, the root of David, had prevailed
[1:31:15] to open the book, and to loose the seven
[1:31:18] seals thereof.
[1:31:21] All right? Now, remember that book
[1:31:23] couldn't be touched. That book couldn't
[1:31:26] be looked at. That book couldn't be
[1:31:28] read.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; I just read you that. That's what the
[1:31:30] Bible says.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; That book was a hot item. Nobody wanted
[1:31:35] it. Nobody could touch it because they
[1:31:37] weren't worthy to grab a hold of that
[1:31:38] book.
[1:31:41] And I behold behold, and lo, in the
[1:31:44] midst of the throne, and of the four
[1:31:45] beasts, and in the midst of the elders
[1:31:48] stood a lamb, as it had been slain,
[1:31:49] having seven horns and seven eyes, which
[1:31:51] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:31:54] into all the earth.
[1:31:56] And he came
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; and he came
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; and took the book out of the hand, right
[1:32:03] hand of him that sat upon a throne. In
[1:32:05] other words, he had no problem, Brother
[1:32:07] Luke, reaching and getting that book.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; He had no problem that nobody could see
[1:32:13] it, nobody could understand it, nobody
[1:32:15] could read it. He went and just picked
[1:32:17] it up off the throne, the man sitting on
[1:32:19] the throne.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you a question.
[1:32:24] And he come and took the book out of the
[1:32:26] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:32:27] throne. And when he had taken the book,
[1:32:30] there was just a there was just a
[1:32:32] Pentecostal revival happen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; But remember that book couldn't be
[1:32:37] touched.
[1:32:39] Now someone is touching it. All right?
[1:32:42] That means no one was worthy to reach
[1:32:45] and get that book except the man that
[1:32:47] was sitting on the throne and the one
[1:32:50] that picked it up from the man sitting
[1:32:52] on the throne.
[1:32:54] But remember when he picked that book
[1:32:56] up,
[1:32:59] listen,
[1:33:01] when he had taken the book, the four
[1:33:02] beasts and four and 20 elders fell down
[1:33:04] before the lamb, having every one of
[1:33:06] them harps and golden vows full of
[1:33:08] odors, which are the prayers of saints,
[1:33:10] and they sung a new song,
[1:33:13] saying, "Thou art worthy to take the
[1:33:15] book, and to open the seals thereof."
[1:33:16] All right. Someone is now worthy.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Who was that?
[1:33:23] The lamb was the son of man, not the son
[1:33:25] of God. The lamb was the son of man.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; The one that died for us.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; So now, if that was where he's standing,
[1:33:34] and if we're standing in the son of man
[1:33:36] dispensation now with this kingdom that
[1:33:38] he's talking about,
[1:33:41] we were there with him.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; If you're shaking your head this way,
[1:33:47] you you're an unbeliever. Where were we?
[1:33:52] We were in him.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; All of us were in him. Brother was
[1:33:57] telling about before the foundation of
[1:33:59] the world, we were the attributes in the
[1:34:01] mind of God. Listen, if we were
[1:34:03] infallible, if we knew everything, I
[1:34:05] wouldn't know how many children I'd
[1:34:07] have, what their name would be if I was
[1:34:09] infinite. That's the reason he knew. He
[1:34:12] knew every child he was going. He knew
[1:34:13] every person that was going to be born
[1:34:15] again. He knew everybody that was going
[1:34:16] to be in his family because he was
[1:34:18] infinite,
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; So then therefore he could predestinate
[1:34:22] or predetermine what we're talking about
[1:34:24] by his fornowledge
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; coming out of that back part of his
[1:34:28] mind.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; But we had to have something happen
[1:34:35] between Revelations 5
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; and Revelations 10.
[1:34:40] That's specifically to me and you.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; All right. Be finished in just a few
[1:34:45] minutes. All right.
[1:34:47] Are you with me?
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So John typed the bride in the
[1:34:52] ages,
[1:34:53] but remember John also typed the seventh
[1:34:57] age bride.
[1:35:00] Right?
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; I'll prove it to you in just a second.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Because in Revelations 5, the lamb takes
[1:35:06] the book.
[1:35:08] They singing a new song. Now watch verse
[1:35:11] 10.
[1:35:13] Watch verse 10. Now verse 1 2 3 and 4.
[1:35:18] No hope.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Unworthy.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Verse 10. Something has happened and has
[1:35:32] made us
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; right. Amen. unto our God, kings and
[1:35:38] priests, and we shall reign on or over
[1:35:43] the earth. Something happened in just
[1:35:47] about 10 verses that made us worthy to
[1:35:52] be kings and priests.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; But remember, the book was still closed.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Book was still closed. He just took the
[1:36:03] book. He redeemed what was in that book.
[1:36:06] He took that book. That book was me and
[1:36:08] you.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; And I'll promise you when when John's
[1:36:11] standing and looking, he said, "Well,
[1:36:12] I'm not worthy. I'm not worthy." Well,
[1:36:14] by the time we get over here a little
[1:36:15] bit further, when that book becomes
[1:36:17] open, it's going to show us that we're
[1:36:19] worthy.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; So, let's go to Revelations 10 real
[1:36:22] quick. We'll be finished right here.
[1:36:31] I hope you know God orchestrated all
[1:36:33] this just for us.
[1:36:35] Yes, sir.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Sure. He sure he loves nature and he
[1:36:39] loves people. He loves every person. He
[1:36:40] can't he can't unlove.
[1:36:43] That's
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; He loves. But remember, you got to
[1:36:47] remember that you got to attach yourself
[1:36:49] to that love
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; because you're a free moral agent to
[1:36:52] either be able to do it or not be able
[1:36:54] to do it. All right. Revelations 10:1.
[1:36:57] All right. This is all of our This is
[1:36:58] our great This is our um anthem of the
[1:37:02] believers
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; chapter. All right. So, Revelations 10:1
[1:37:07] and I saw another mighty angel come down
[1:37:09] from heaven. You see how God is hiding
[1:37:12] all this? Because remember when you talk
[1:37:15] about the covenant angel or the angel of
[1:37:17] the covenant, it's a capital A.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; This is not.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; So, God's hiding it. It's going to take
[1:37:26] a prophet, but it wouldn't really take a
[1:37:28] prophet. It'd just take you to knowing
[1:37:30] what was look because his his
[1:37:31] characteristics after that, brother Bob
[1:37:33] was exactly Revelations 1.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brown said, "Only Christ
[1:37:39] this could be."
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; And I saw another mighty angel come down
[1:37:43] from heaven clothed with a cloud, a
[1:37:45] rainbow upon his head, his face, as it
[1:37:47] were with sun, and his feet as a pillar
[1:37:48] of fire. And he had in his hand a little
[1:37:51] book open.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; All right. a little book open. Now
[1:37:57] remember, John typed the bride, but John
[1:38:00] is fixing to type us
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; because remember, he couldn't even touch
[1:38:05] the book. He praised he praised the lamb
[1:38:08] that he could take the book.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; But over here, John's not going to have
[1:38:14] a problem reaching and getting the book.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; What happened? I'll tell you what
[1:38:20] happened.
[1:38:22] He had his hand a little book open and
[1:38:23] he said his right foot on the sea and
[1:38:25] his left foot on the earth. Now there is
[1:38:27] something I want you to
[1:38:30] make a little asterisk in your brain if
[1:38:32] you don't want to write in your Bible
[1:38:34] cuz we got to come back to that. That is
[1:38:36] a spec. Everybody believe the word of
[1:38:37] God is written right correct. No
[1:38:40] changes. Okay. I just wanted to make
[1:38:41] sure I was in the same crowd. And he had
[1:38:43] his hand a little book open and he said
[1:38:45] his right foot upon the sea and his left
[1:38:47] foot upon the earth. Who was that? That
[1:38:48] was Christ.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody with me? That was
[1:38:51] Christ.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's another angel going to come
[1:38:57] into the be involved in this in just a
[1:38:59] minute. All right. He cried with a loud
[1:39:01] voice as when a lion roar. And when he
[1:39:03] had cried, seven thunders uttered their
[1:39:05] voices. And when the seven thunders had
[1:39:07] uttered their voices, I was about to
[1:39:09] write. Now look,
[1:39:12] brother Ram said John saw who those what
[1:39:14] they were. He even said Daniel saw the
[1:39:17] thunders.
[1:39:19] So, everybody wants to make it a great
[1:39:21] mystery. The thunders are a great
[1:39:23] mystery. John
[1:39:25] was about to write down what they were,
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Man's made it everything else, but we're
[1:39:33] not getting into that later on. That's a
[1:39:35] another subject for another time. But I
[1:39:37] was about to write. Remember, John typed
[1:39:39] the what?
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Bride. Right
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; now, here in this chapter, he's going to
[1:39:44] not be the entire bride cuz the entire
[1:39:47] bride did not eat an open book.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; And the angels which is which I saw, now
[1:40:00] watch again. He said, "Seal up those
[1:40:02] things that the seven thunders uttered
[1:40:03] and write them not." And the angel which
[1:40:05] I saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[1:40:07] earth lifted up his hand to heaven. Now
[1:40:09] who is that? That's Christ, right?
[1:40:11] That's Christ.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; And swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:40:16] ever, who created heaven and things that
[1:40:17] therein, and the earth, and the things
[1:40:19] that therein, and the sea, and the
[1:40:20] things which are therein, that there
[1:40:21] should be time no longer.
[1:40:28] If we skip down to verse eight,
[1:40:32] we'll miss the whole thing. Right.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Verse seven says, "But in the days of
[1:40:40] the voice of the seventh angel, when he
[1:40:43] shall begin to sound the mystery of God,
[1:40:48] should be finished
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; as he has declared to his servants to
[1:40:53] prophets." Let me read you a couple of
[1:40:56] uh translations. Brother U
[1:40:59] Andre and I were talking about this. the
[1:41:01] there's a translation called the way way
[1:41:03] wy translation and he's a really good
[1:41:06] he's a really good uh translator. Now
[1:41:09] listen we're reading
[1:41:11] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:41:12] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:41:13] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:41:15] finished as he hath declared to servants
[1:41:16] the prophets. This is the way the
[1:41:18] another interpretation of that is then
[1:41:20] is the secret purpose of God fulfilled
[1:41:24] according to his message which he give
[1:41:27] to his servants to prophets.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Or another translation says moreover at
[1:41:32] the time when the seventh angel shall
[1:41:34] speak when he is ready to blow his blast
[1:41:37] the mysteries will be revealed.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; All right. Well, we know who that was.
[1:41:41] We know that was Elijah number seven. We
[1:41:44] know that was William Brandon. We know
[1:41:45] that for a fact. Is that right? Amen.
[1:41:47] All right, real quick. But now watch.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice of the
[1:41:52] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[1:41:53] sound, the mystery of God to be
[1:41:54] finished, as he has declared his service
[1:41:55] to prophet. We should all read that
[1:41:57] without even looking at the Bible.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; And then we say, well, verse 8, 9, and
[1:42:01] 10, we know that's John. But here's John
[1:42:05] doing something that he's never done
[1:42:06] before.
[1:42:09] Revelations 5, he couldn't even pick the
[1:42:11] book up. Revelations 5, he couldn't even
[1:42:13] look at it.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:16] Now
[1:42:18] verse eight. And the voice which I heard
[1:42:20] from heaven spake unto me and said, go
[1:42:23] and take the little book which is open
[1:42:26] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[1:42:29] upon the sea and upon the earth.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; That's not brother Brandham.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; The book was not taken
[1:42:42] from the seventh angel.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:42:45] But without verse seven, you will not
[1:42:48] know what verse 8, 9, and 10 is.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Okay? We're not doing away with brother
[1:42:52] Brown's ministry. But there's a lot of
[1:42:53] people believe that that book was given
[1:42:54] to brother Brandham. That book was given
[1:42:56] to the bride.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; It took the voice of a seventh angel to
[1:43:02] break that mystery to show us who we
[1:43:04] are.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; All right. We know who William Brandham
[1:43:07] is. I want to know who I am. Amen.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; And the voice which I heard from heaven
[1:43:15] spake unto me saying, "Go and take."
[1:43:17] Now, he had a problem with even looking
[1:43:18] at it. Now, the angels Christ
[1:43:22] is saying, "John, go and take that book
[1:43:25] from me. Come and get it."
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; So, something happened between
[1:43:30] Revelations 5 and Revelations 10.
[1:43:32] Something should have happened between 1
[1:43:34] Corinthians 6 and re and Romans 8:1.
[1:43:36] Something should have happened the day
[1:43:37] you got born again. from that day till
[1:43:39] this day you're standing here today.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; There should be an open book somewhere
[1:43:43] that God say you come and take this
[1:43:45] book. It's your book.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram's message was my message.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Go and take the little book which is
[1:43:56] open in the hand of the angel which
[1:43:58] standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:43:59] earth. We know that's Christ. And I went
[1:44:02] unto the angel and said unto me, I'm not
[1:44:05] worthy. I can't look at this book. I'm
[1:44:09] gonna cry because I don't know what I'm
[1:44:11] doing.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; That's not what that says.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; And I went unto the angel and said unto
[1:44:18] him, "Give me.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Give me my mountain."
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Give me my book.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Praise.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; And the and and the and the angel said,
[1:44:33] "No, no, no, John. You you no you you
[1:44:35] you can't do this. This is not for you.
[1:44:38] No. What does he say? And immediately
[1:44:41] the angel says, "Take it and eat it up."
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Then it shall make thy belly bitter, and
[1:44:47] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
[1:44:50] And I took the little book
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; that was open out of the hands of
[1:44:57] Christ.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. and I ate it and it disappeared in
[1:45:03] John.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; He didn't sorry. He didn't throw it back
[1:45:10] up.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; He ate it and it became John.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; That book that was not worthy to be
[1:45:18] looked on, not worthy to be handled, now
[1:45:20] is being eaten by a person.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; And he didn't eat the pages that he
[1:45:25] liked and kicked the rest of them out.
[1:45:28] Right.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; They weren't pages laying on the ground
[1:45:31] when John got finished. Well, I don't
[1:45:33] think I can do that one. No, that's too
[1:45:34] much for me. All that stuff right there.
[1:45:36] I don't think No, he ate the whole book.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; He ate everything there was. There was
[1:45:41] nothing left for him to do but one
[1:45:43] thing, and that was to go into all the
[1:45:46] world. And let me rephrase that and
[1:45:48] preach the gospel to every creature.
[1:45:50] Jesus said that before he left, right?
[1:45:52] Right.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; And you must prophesy to every person
[1:45:58] you see
[1:46:01] of all the nations, tongues, kindred,
[1:46:05] everybody.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:09] John
[1:46:12] was the man
[1:46:15] that ate the book.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; And who did John represent?
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; The bride. But here he represented a
[1:46:24] specific part of the bride
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; cuz not other part of no other part of
[1:46:28] the bride could eat that book.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; because remember it was closed over
[1:46:34] here. It was open over here. So he was
[1:46:37] commissioned to eat an open book.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Everything
[1:46:44] has been given to me and you. Yes.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; You and I should not have a mystery in
[1:46:51] our will and where it goes.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Who it goes to
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; and how to handle it. At one time, this
[1:47:01] book couldn't be handled.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; This book had ideas of man that said,
[1:47:06] "Well, it's three people. It it's it's
[1:47:09] water baptism in the other other way.
[1:47:11] It's it's uh hell's eternal. Uh Eve eat
[1:47:14] an apple. just let's just keep going.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; But once that book became, it took the
[1:47:20] seventh angel. Let's stand our feet.
[1:47:22] Come on, musicians.
[1:47:24] It took an angel.
[1:47:26] It took Christ to come down on a
[1:47:29] mountain and give our prophet
[1:47:34] the seals.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; And then those seals were revealed. All
[1:47:40] the trumpets, the vows, the plagues,
[1:47:42] even the thunders,
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; everything was revealed.
[1:47:45] Yes.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; But if brother Brandham came just for
[1:47:48] himself, he came,
[1:47:53] God's not going to ever do that, folks.
[1:47:54] God's going to come and bring a message.
[1:47:56] And when he brings a message, he brings
[1:47:57] it to a people.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Okay? All the way back when brother
[1:48:02] Woodby and different ones, my dad,
[1:48:04] different ones, God brought a message
[1:48:06] through them because I see the fruits of
[1:48:07] it.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; I see the fruits of it.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; If not, where'd you get it from? Who'd
[1:48:13] you get it from? Right?
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; You got it from the man behind the
[1:48:16] bullpit
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; who preached to you an open book
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; who said today come and eat this book.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Come and let's eat this book together.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Let's make Oh, it's going to be bitter.
[1:48:30] We got to live it.
[1:48:32] But oh, it should be sweet as honey when
[1:48:34] we put it in there and the word of God
[1:48:36] starts working and and we see that that
[1:48:38] that we're part of that book and and
[1:48:41] then then you know all of a sudden lives
[1:48:43] start changing around you. You start
[1:48:45] changing your job changes. Sometimes you
[1:48:48] it's a transformation folk
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; from 1 Corinthians 6 to Romans 8:1.
[1:48:54] There's therefore now no condemnation to
[1:48:57] them which are in Christ Jesus who walk
[1:48:59] not with a closed book but with an open
[1:49:02] book.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Dear heavenly father, thank
[1:49:07] you for this day you've gi us. May we
[1:49:10] have said something, Lord, that'll help
[1:49:11] our people. Lord, it's just it's just us
[1:49:14] here on earth, Lord. We're human beings
[1:49:15] and we sometimes we do feel unworthy.
[1:49:18] Sometimes we feel like that we're just
[1:49:19] not worthy enough. But Lord, I've got to
[1:49:22] look to the word of God and I've got to
[1:49:24] say this everywhere I go that we are
[1:49:27] worthy. By your stripes, we're healed.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; By your healing power of salvation, our
[1:49:34] soul can be burned out, Lord. And you
[1:49:37] come and and be there and reside in our
[1:49:39] soul by the new birth and make us a new
[1:49:42] creation, a new creature in Christ. And
[1:49:45] then Lord, we are then in the bride and
[1:49:48] now involved in an open book to where
[1:49:50] we're going to eat this. We're going to
[1:49:52] eat our way into a body change. Father,
[1:49:56] bless us. Be with us now as we take a
[1:49:59] little time here with you, Lord. And and
[1:50:01] may we eat this book. And oh, it may be
[1:50:04] bitter sometimes,
[1:50:06] but Lord, John, eat it all. And
[1:50:10] everywhere John went after that, he
[1:50:13] prophesied. He told about the Lord. He
[1:50:15] went and told people up until the day he
[1:50:17] died. He was just a very humble man. But
[1:50:20] he was typing an end time bride that was
[1:50:23] standing here today right now around the
[1:50:25] world. We are living under that open
[1:50:28] book and making that book come to life.
[1:50:30] Father, be with us. Be with brother
[1:50:33] Andre and the group here, Father.
[1:50:34] Strengthen them. Be with us, Lord, on
[1:50:36] the highways, Lord, as we go eat a
[1:50:38] little bite there in a in a bit, Lord.
[1:50:40] But be with us as we continue on our
[1:50:42] journey home, Lord. that as the wheels
[1:50:44] turn that we'll say, "Oh, did our hearts
[1:50:47] not burn within us as we walk together
[1:50:50] as believers." Father, I thank you for
[1:50:53] the uh blessings of the people that you
[1:50:55] have that brought from the church, our
[1:50:57] church. Lord, that you would be with
[1:50:58] them. Thank you for each one. Lord,
[1:51:02] just bless us now. Sanctify us, Lord.
[1:51:05] Keep us healthy.
[1:51:07] Keep us centered in your will, Lord. And
[1:51:10] I I hope that and pray that every
[1:51:12] morning that we open this book up and we
[1:51:14] see our name in the will and that you
[1:51:18] died to give us all these things
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; and you gave it to us abundantly.
[1:51:23] Father, I pray that you'd bless us now
[1:51:25] in Jesus name. Amen. Brother Andre, God
[1:51:28] bless you.
[1:51:33] [Music]
[1:51:39] They just let his praises ring. Come on.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Love you, buddy. Appreciate you. That's
[1:51:47] warm. Go ahead. Thank you.
[1:51:51] [Music]
[1:52:02] of the pro.
[1:52:15] [Music]
[1:52:31] from the throne of your heart.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; To take that book. Faith is the victory
[1:52:38] that overcomes the world.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; When we see the open book, because we
[1:52:44] are the people of the open book. That's
[1:52:46] our message. And when we see that great
[1:52:49] Holy Spirit with the power of
[1:52:51] transformation
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; to move us, the people who pass from
[1:52:56] death into life.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; As brother Brandham said in the message,
[1:52:59] who is this mech? Only the predestinated
[1:53:03] are considered in redemption.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; This great plan of God that's
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; taken over our lives. As brother Wade
[1:53:11] was saying, your real you. I'm not going
[1:53:13] to preach
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; your real you. that gene that was locked
[1:53:18] up in the seals.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; And then the book was open,
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; then your life came into view.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; And how thankful we are.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Let's take this word
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; that we've heard this morning. You say,
[1:53:30] "Well, brother, I know those things, but
[1:53:32] these things are reality, a living
[1:53:34] reality."
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; And if our life is just the same, and
[1:53:38] we're just doing the same thing and just
[1:53:40] get the same results.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Then we've got to do something
[1:53:43] different.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:45] to do different is to have that lamb.
[1:53:48] The lamb that came and took the book in
[1:53:50] Revelations 5. The lamb that steps from
[1:53:53] your heart
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; and and gives you faith to say, "Lord,

[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; So, just go in telling you what Irwin
[1:58:58] Full Gospel Tabernacle. One more thing,
[1:59:01] the owner there, her name is Rachel. And
[1:59:05] Rachel, my wife and I, we were dear
[1:59:08] friends with her. We spoke to her. She
[1:59:10] said, "Brother Andre, I've got to fly to
[1:59:12] Oklahoma to Texas."
[1:59:16] And she said, "They found a lump in my
[1:59:18] colon. Me and my dad are flying out
[1:59:20] there today."
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; So she said, "Please get these believers
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; Pray for me."
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Yes.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; And so y'all remember her. She's such a
[1:59:31] wonderful shoe. She goes out of her way
[1:59:33] to make you as comfortable as possible.
[1:59:36] So let's remember her and uh I know she
[1:59:40] would certainly appreciate a very
[1:59:42] generous and thankful person. So before
[1:59:46] we just close, I met brother Miguel. I
[1:59:50] met him come up here because you're
[1:59:52] going to dismiss us in prayer. I met him
[1:59:54] and his lovely wife and children and
[1:59:57] just had a good fellowship with him.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord for him.
