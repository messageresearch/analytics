Lord God and I've been able to hear your word Lord Jesus I can I can catch the details I can understand what you've said Lord God and I believe it Lord God I believe what you revealed in this day and this hour Lord God lord Jesus I recognize Lord God God that it's a it's it's it's an awesome awesome time we live in Lord God to know Lord Jesus that we're here just before your soon appearing in the resurrection of your bride Lord God as we come into this Easter season Lord Jesus I pray oh Lord God that you help us Lord Jesus to understand all there is that you're willing to give to us in this hour in this day in this age Lord Jesus Lord I've always looked at at at at if I could only uh uh uh come to a place where you know like the disciples or like those that came wanting to see you said Lord let us see Jesus Lord I want to present you Lord God amongst the people Lord tonight Lord Jesus get me totally out of the way Lord God and let them see you Lord God in every aspect of your life Lord God everything that you're showing and revealing in this day and age Lord we love you and we're so grateful to live in a day when you've revealed so much Lord Jesus when you revealed the message of this hour Lord God when you brought this truth Lord God that that you could give us Lord God an opportunity Lord Jesus to be when the scripture is being fulfilled Lord we're so grateful Lord and Lord Jesus we pray oh Lord God that as we come Lord Jesus that that that your your manifesting time Lord God is here you're revealing Lord Jesus all things Lord God that pertains to this ministry Lord Jesus Lord we recognize Lord God that out there in Arizona Lord you brought that you brought forth the revelation of the Seven Seals and brought them out east here Lord God to be revealed to us personally Lord Jesus Lord we recognize Lord God that you've done so many wondrous things Lord Jesus and as we come to hear from your word Lord Jesus we pray oh Lord God you come and abide in our hearts bless the hearers Lord God everyone and bless Lord Jesus the word that would come forth Lord Jesus Christ's name amen am amen let's remain standing as we take a few scriptures amen uh uh let's uh first of all let's look over to uh Revelations the first chapter and uh let's go over to the Revelations 1 and uh let's drop down to the 17th verse and when I saw saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that was that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more the I mean I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death right amen let's now go over to Romans the eth chapter and I want to speak a little bit I I I mentioned that the title was going to be Easter's quickening power amen and uh we're we're in the Easter season now and I know Romans 811 I know that we're in a day when the word of God is coming to pass in more ways than we can even see sometimes that's right but we can see that the scripture always holds true amen amen Romans 811 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal body by the spirit that dwelleth in you amen amen that quickening power amen the and if the spirit and we realize that the quickening power is the spirit of God that's right and that spirit of God that raised up that was in Jesus that raised him up from the dead that's let's jump over to Mark 16 1 and 2 Mark 16 1 and 2 now this is the scripture for Easter they usually use this scripture around the Easter time it says and when the Sabbath this is after the Lord had passed away and he was in the grave and when the Sabbath was passed Mary of Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and salomi the had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the Seiler at the rising of the sun amen and uh I took a lot of this message from the message brother Brown talked about it is the rising of the sun right and you can be seated uh and I realize you know that the rising of the sun you know uh uh my my son-in-law uh got me a uh uh a little thing to that I he he he actually downloaded a little video on my iPod and I was I'm amazed with each time I see it cuz it's called Uh God of Wonders and in it they talk about the sun you know the sun we have that big Globe we have out there that puts out the Heat heat that we get here in Georgia seeming like a lot of humidity too that's right okay am uh and over there in New Mexico they just got a snowstorm yesterday so I don't understand it same sun over there same sun over here but they got a snowstorm over there well uh yesterday they were they were going through a snowstorm and and I said wow what do you mean a snowstorm look how nice it is here our grass is barely barely coming up in our yard I don't understand you guys I think you guys got the advantage here you know we'd love to cut grass like you cut grass all we get is thorns and thisel out there but nevertheless I I I was looking at the grass brother the kids were just rolling in the grass yesterday I mean uh when we were out at brother Dale's and I says my gosh I says we wouldn't dare try that at home right you'd get up with more thorns on you then you know what to do with we don't walk barefooted in our grass but uh it's so so happens that I guess the sun rises in the East and sets in the west we haven't gotten our spring yet we're expecting it soon yeah amen I saw the blossom starting on my peach tree they probably froze with the snow but uh nevertheless we're looking in looking at the rising of the sun I was telling you about this video called God of Wonders and they said that our son is one of the most smallest ones out there but yet it has so much power that they you know I work on nuclear bombs at the laboratory at Los naal laboratory and they go and they explain to us how many kilotons of TNT one of these hydrogen bombs can produce right I mean it's out of your mind it's it's unimaginable right you know what we seen what you see in the films of Hiroshima and Nagasaki those bombs are just the blasting cap that sets off the bomb and I was talking that I don't want to talk anything classified here I could get in trouble because it goes over the internet you know but nevertheless that little that nuclear bomb that we know of that was set off in Hiroshima nasaki is just the neutrons that set off the real explosion in other words it's the blasting cap that Timothy McBay had in that fertilizer you know so you can realize that you know there's much more power amen and then an interesting thing is is when you get that many neutrons hit in something even what's not nuclear doesn't have to be Atomic right we we set off nuclear right right that's why they were so afraid in the first atomic bomb that they're going to set off the atmosphere right exactly y because they put out that many neutrons things that aren't nuclear like salt goes nuclear right so you say well then how can how can that be and then we're they're talking about the Sun and they say the sun in 1 second's time puts out more energy than 5 million kilot my 5 million atomic bombs w i what in a second of that energy just it's rolling around in the way it's doing and it doesn't turn off yep amen it hasn't turned off in a long long the same son you look up at was the same son that was here when Jesus was here see so you realize that hey God put that in in in in his word and it's there because it can't it can't fail it it falls in its position every single day you know how much more should us as a bride be able to fall into position every single day amen so when we look at the quickening power of our Lord Jesus Christ and we we look at the at there in the in the in in uh when we start looking at at at Easter and what we're what this season is and we start to look at the at at at at at what we're trying to be quickening of our mortal bodies how are we ever going to arrive there yeah you know brother Brown said we don't have enough Faith to cure the common cold and how are we going to gain enough Faith to Quicken our mortal bodies and bring them up from the grave right amen some people say well it's not supposed to be in us it's supposed to be in the Saints of the last day well who do you think we are you know the Saints of the last day are going to call us all out of the great who do you think we are what time do you think we're living in you know we've got to come to a place where we'll take God as word just like the sun does every day that's right amen right but I was looking at uh Josiah in the in the car he has a a Bible and it's like a comic book and I just trying out my new glasses bought me some new glasses cuz I was pretty much blind over here without my reading glasses so she bought me some new glasses I picked up that book and I started reading Genesis and I was reading it said and Genesis Genesis 1 let me see where where am I Genesis 1 and 2 it says and the Earth was without form and void well of course that's comic book style so they kind of show the pictures but they're not really saying what the word is the word saying something and they show the picture saying something else for example you see some kind of weird fruit hanging off of a tree that uh Eve Eve was taken upon but we know what it was now so here you see you see he says in the beginning okay and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the waters and and the waters rolled over okay now this is my paraphrasing Waters were rolling over the Earth so on a spinning Earth out there that there was really no form and void and you start to look at it and you see that and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters even the sky the water in the sky and the water on the ground or the water in the oceans and the water over the ground was just everywhere it just didn't have a a place you can tell it apart right and God actually separated the waters from the waters but first of all he said let there be light yeah wait a minute there was no sun created yet but he said yet let there be light what kind of light was it that they were seeing there if you go back and you can imagine yourself right there at the dawn of time and you can you can imagine yourself standing there and the world was void and darkness was upon the face of the Earth and just the whirling Waters of waves the skies were full of waves the ground was full of waves the air was full of waves and the Lord moved over the the the the the Deep yeah scripture says no form void and he said let there be light right there was no sunlight yet God hadn't created the sun yet but he said let there be light that's right so what kind of light was it amen it wasn't this light and it wasn't it wasn't any light we know of but it is the light we know of because it's the same light we see in the in the picture of the pillar of fire was over brother brandom so there was light then God you think about the seeds that were down in the Earth God said there was seeds in the earth and they needed light okay so and God made this light but yet it wasn't the sunlight yeah and then he said and and the seeds were in the earth he says and then and then you you go over to Genesis 3 and I mean 1 and 3 it says and let the light and and and let there be light in he okay and he separated the waters after that then he moves over and he brings plant life on the Earth right okay then on Genesis 1:14 he he he he put lights in the sky and made Seasons all right you say well that was all when the sun came out and and it would go far away from the earth or come close to the Earth remember remember true science proves God is true that's right true science sure so you start to look at it here here it is here here you got God on on Genesis 1:14 he made the seasons with that Supernatural light and then he made Genesis 1:15 he made the Sun and he made the Lesser he made the the the lights in the heavens right okay then in Genesis 1:16 he actually made the sun and the moon so he made lights in the sky then he made the Suns and the moon and then he made the Stars yeah or he made the Stars also y yeah so you start to say well how could this all be he made the plant life and he made the plant life to sprout way before there was sunl mhm well that's not in my botney uh frame of mind but I do realize that there's more light than the physical light that the sun provides or the moons or the star provides the light the light that I'm looking at is the light of God's word amen and what it produces right so what what are we looking at we're still looking want to keep our mind on on on on this this resurrection power of E of of that the Lord brought forth in his resurrection so then so then so then we realize that the light of the sun wasn't the light that first came upon the Earth that's right and the light of the Stars wasn't the first light to come upon the Earth right and the light that actually brought the seed out of its position Glory wasn't actually the sunlight right it was God's light Glory now we start to look at you know when we look at at at at at when the Lord ignited the Sun out there when he uhhh set the sun in in in orbit and brought the earth into that Lifeline you know uh science is saying you know what the Earth is running in the out get getting close to the to the the inner bands they they can calculate by its orbits and everything how many years it will take before the Earth actually gets pulled into the sun yeah how many years right millions and millions of years I don't know how they calculate it but they figure it out you know they're so science is so so careful that they can send a rocket out of here or should I say a rocket up launch a satellite send it circles around the Sun several times and calculated to come right into the atmosphere of one of the planets out there they got one spinning around Saturn right now trying to look for a certain Moon and this I I actually worked on that one uh uh the cuz I was building the uh the generators the generators the reactor generators made with atomic or should I say U nuclear stuff that would keep the the the thing warm way away from the presence of the Sun so they had they had little heat sources in all the in all the m parts of all that of that satellite and they had to be producing their own power so they they made generators on the actual satellite it's not very big I mean little little thing it up folds as it comes out of there but nevertheless uh uh I had I had a lot of a lot of work on that on that satellite but they got it all the way to Saturn and set it around one of the moons up there and they actually did what from here they control that thing with radio waves or something they control that thing until it finally finally it's still doing its work up there it hasn't gone dead yet right they called that one uh what was the name of you can look it up on the internet uh um can't remember the name um look up Saturn oh There He Man work is work I don't like work okay next so all right so what happens is nevertheless they calculate how how long these things will happen y so by looking at the orbit of the of the Earth around the Sun they calculate that one day the Earth is going to be pulled into the sun yeah so already most that's why money is being appropriated to try and explore Mars you say why Mars because it's the next one outside of the Life Band yeah see as the earth goes in to the inside Life Band global warming they say then the next one coming in is going to be Saturn into a life band that can keep life like we got here so that's why they're trying to put so much money into exploring Mars because it'll be on the outer skirts of our of of the Earth's life band uh around the Sun so what happens we look at Easter morning uh there and when we're starting to look at Easter morning in Mark 16 we see the sun was Rising this same Sun that we see in the morning rising over but there was the rising of another son the S Jesus the sun and the S and at the rising of the Sun in that day there was another seal broken and we talk about the Easter seal right see the Romans had placed a seal over the grave y should I say the soldiers from the temple who were Roman guards set a seal over the grave and said nobody they said this this fake this this person here said he was going to raise from the dead he's not going to raise from the dead without breaking this Roman seal and they put a seal over the grave right they made sure that nobody can go can enter that grave without passing the guard without getting in Breaking the Roman seal right and they didn't realize that that one was going to be broken from within right so what happened so here was the breaking of a seal we talk about the Easter seal and we we realize that that that the breaking of a seal contains a lot of power we look at at at at at at that breaking of the seal at that time when God decided to break the seal of the Grave you know the grave has such a seal that all through time nobody's come up from there right right nobody gets out of the Grave come on they go there but they don't come back out come on but the Easter seal proved something different right amen it proved that there was life that God had life he was a possessor of life and he had given already his word that he was going to be quickened from the grave the the way that because David had already said of him that he would Quicken from the grave right that he I suffer not my Holy One to see corruption and and so by by David saying that under inspiration it was Christ speaking through David that he was not going to stay in the grave so when we see the breaking of the Easter seal we see that he broke he broke the Seal of death hell in the grave and he came forth to bring newness of life just like that son if you look at that son that that that morning in the in the dawn of time yeah when it when when when God said let there be light and that little plant down in the depths of the water like brother BR talks about the about the uh Easter lily right in the mck and the Meer not even able to see any light but when spring comes around and it feels that there's light up there it can't see it but it just feels that there's light out there it starts pushing its way through the mck and the m and to get out to the light right just like our sinful Souls we're in the depths of the world where we have no way to look up we're in the in the depths of sin and drugs and alcohol and and everything that the world's got to offer us and we have no idea where we're from or what we're what our purpose is in life something inside of us says there's something real about this there's something real about God there's something true about God and I want that I'm hungry for that something I I can't help it right you might have run through different Avenues you might seek in different ways but someplace along the line you say I need God I need he I need his life I need I need the truth of God's word and somehow somewhere God makes himself obligated to make sure the light crosses your path amen amen he he finds a way to let that light come across your path to draw you from the depths of sin now what happens when we startop when we look at it we look at the at the at at at at the the days that that that the that life was was was was in turmoil yeah in the darkness of of of sin yes sir and almighty God was able to beat that seal now we start looking at seals when we when we look at seals cuz I'm talking about everything that we know brother Brown preached about Easter yeah he preached the Easter seal yeah he preached the uh he preached the uh uh uh it is the rising of the Sun and we look at the Easter seal you know the Easter seal you know he talked about tuberculosis yeah yeah now uh my dad worked in a in uh uh in Von MOA in the Las Vegas area it was a sanitarium for tuberculosis patients hundreds and hundreds of people from all over the nation were there the doctor would take them and sunbathe them in a healthy environment they brought food to them they brought all kinds of things to try and give them the the uh resistance to the disease as best they could but to bir osis was such a strong disease they were dying one after another after another Y and they put out the to get finances for all these sanitariums around the nation they put out the thing called the Easter seal and they sell little little uh postage stamps for everybody to Buy Buy for so much money and you bring these little Easter Seals and you stick them on your letters or right over the the sealed part of your letter you stick these little Easter Seals you'd buy them and they'd send the money to the catarium to help out TB all over the nation right and they would stick these little stamps on your and everybody would break the seal when they're going to open their letters but the real seal they're wanting to break was the way to figure out how to heal that dreaded disease tuberculosis and they looked and looked everywhere to try and figure that out well their brother Brown said they came a public outcry y a public outcry to cry out for God to give the revelation of the seal to reveal to the doctors how to heal tuberculosis right amen and it went out and they prayed and they prayed and they prayed and People Prayed and all of a sudden somebody came up with something called antibiotics y right antibiotics and they started finding out they were they were shooting shooting these people with radiation it was working but not that great yeah right they were doing uh things like uh like like of course giving them uh trying to build up their immune system of course you see all these people with AIDS trying to build up their immune system eat healthy don't don't eat nothing you know but it didn't it wasn't working right they were still dying it was such a dread of disease that they had to be in a sanitarium way away from the public because anybody that came in contact with could catch tuberculosis yeah so they they couldn't figure out how to break that seal the doctors so people went to praying and antibiotics came on the scene right well they didn't only heal tuberculosis my dad lost his job because no more sick people but he was amazed cuz he thought the doctor was doing it he actually told me the story he says Dr gallentine the one who was working he said healed all those people oh my but he didn't know that they had brought antibiotics in and started giving it to all these people but he really thought that what he was doing did it but no they they came in with antibiotics they healed it right and let me tell you all those soldiers in World War I that lost limbs because of a little because of infection of of of of just stepping on a on a on a on a landmine they could they lost limbs and legs and all these things because infection would in so bad that they had to amputate they would amputate all the soldiers limbs that got Dam got a little damage right and you say why because they had no antibiotics at the time right but when antibiotics came up it was developed for TB but it was healing a lot of other things now we still go to the doctor get antibiotics for the different things whenever we catch an infection but what happens people pray and ask God right they got a hold of God for it so they broke the seal and understood the the the details about these sicknesses and they they realized there that that there was a there was there was healing in what God has placed in order right man now watch so what happened the seal in Jeremiah there was a seal and the seal in Jeremiah the scripture says that he was in in prison for pre ing against uh the country right and he was in jail cuz he said that Babylon was going to take this country and take them out to be uh uh 70 years out there and they put him in jail but an uncle of his come over and says Jeremiah you know you're the next kin here and I have this piece of land he says buy the land from me cuz I can't hold it and I I want I want to sell it to you Jeremiah says why would I buy buy land that's going to go into captivity and become just worth nothing and God said buy the land why would I want to buy land that's going to go that's going to just be bar uh what do they call that uh desolate land when everybody goes to captivity right and God said buy the land have them have do the paperwork so Jeremiah bought the land from his uncle they in in the prison mhm he had them they they took and they put a seal the government seal for the land they put the seal on it and did the documentation and everything that he got the title deed it was all sealed up and just for proper and then he took it and he put it in an earn vessel God told him save it well cuz one day it'll be worth something save it well so he put in an earn vessel they put another seal on it yep then they saved it in a well in a good place so that it would come up when they came back from Babylon 70 years had to be good for 70 years sounds like some of us maybe we might have something of importance we might want to put in a safety deposit box you know some place right but you know with our banks falling apart where our safety deposit box being good you know but you know what from the dawn of time when Adam fell and Mankind lost its inheritance to be with God right and Eve fell from the presence of God and Adam knowing what he was going to do went and became evees Jesus Christ yeah right and he stood in the Gap and said you know what I'm going to save your life you know you you say well he he he just partook no he didn't just partook he knowingly partook yeah right he knowingly partook that it was going to it was going to cost him his life amen sure and he stood in the gap for Eve cuz he loved Eve glory and when he stood in the gap for Eve there was a reason that he let his seed mingle with the Serpent's Seed you say why because there was a time that this seed would have a redeemer yeah and that Redeemer would call all Adam's race back into position that's what the Easter Seal's about when when God said he when when God said you know she's bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh you know she he reached out to keep his wife from being Anni ated yeah so he he he he broke the seal yeah you say the seal the Seal of death there was no death in the land he was willing to take death so both ways you know there could be so Jeremiah looking at that you say well there's something better down the line yeah there's a reason yeah that God looks down the line when he looked down at this Earth while it was rolling in void he looked and he cared about those seeds sure and when he looked in his heart and he looked at God's predestinated seed that he had in his mind they were still sealed up in his mind there's something wonderful about the breaking of a seal Glory right there's something wonderful about the breaking of a seal right when you start to look at what how how God would save the good things for later amen say the good things for later yep you my mom used to camp and years ago she C some peaches she's long gone and the other day I looked in my closet and I still had a can of peach a bottle of peaches a ball jar yeah with sealed Peaches I think it was from my peach tree from years ago that she C and I took them out and I opened them up I said they're very old I said they're probably bad the color was good the smell was good they were good I hate them you know what you know what it's it's amazing how a seal can preserve exactly how a seal how a seal done properly I tried sealing a few things and I couldn't make it work but my but she had the art of how making now God has sealed up something for us right great things for us that have been hidden throughout all the ages right right you know in his mind he had an idea of what he wanted this bride to be he had an idea of how he could present to his bride his own character amen his own his own will his own abilities he wanted to to to to save something throughout time 2,000 years he wanted to say look the life that I live I want you to live amen the faith that I have I want you to have the the abilities that I have I want you to have yes amen how am I going to do this how am I going to get a people that will be of Faith people that will believe my word and take it as it is how am I going to have a people that look at my word and say you know what this promise that's written here in the word of God is my possession it's something that I I I don't deserve I don't I don't but I believe it's true and I'm going to possess it when you stand back and you say well what am I promised here what's in this for me how can I be an air to these kind of things right it's because he preserved it for you right through the ages he preserved it for you there's people that have died to make sure this gospel came out in English so that you can read it amen many people died to give this gospel to you burned at the stake for this right take a look at history John HW and all those people that died to give you this get this scripture where you can read it that's right amen right look at the mar book of Martyrs find out why they were getting killed in the book of Martyrs they were getting killed because they protested right and stood back and says the word of God should be something for the people why should the priest just give us what they want to give us right glor amen but it was preserved Through the Ages so that you can paric of it at this time right man like that bottle of peaches my mom left for me that's right the other day I founds a bottle of Choke Cherry syrup too yeah that was very good yeah amen you know I've got a you know and and and yet you start to look at how is it that that that that that he could preserve his own life Through the Ages and say okay we do understand that Pentecost we can go back to the book of Acts and we can see what Pentecost produced It produced a book of Acts and when we see that Pentecost produced The Book of Acts through the church ages through the Dark Ages how could God preserve a people that would come to the place and position that they'll say hey this is mine y it's my possession right wife says oh those peaches are too old you better throw them out they they're they're they're too old you don't she's been gone this many years I says yeah I says I understand that but I still they smell good they look good y you know what they didn't hurt me at all you know and now the same kind of thing how can they you say I'm a possessor of all that Pentecost has to offer silver and gold I don't have but such as I have right I'll give to you glory in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and the scripture says his body received strength right and he got up and walked am how do you get to that place well you know what what's what's the the the use of a first fruits yeah right what is a what does a first fruits do for you right if a crop if a was sheet okay my corn has come to maturity I got three or four kernels of corn in the Old Testament they' take those three or four kernels of corn take them to the priest and say look my crop is out there my whole field is full of corn but this is the first three uh what do they call those corn cobs or that have come to maturity so here take this and the priest would wave it and say May the rest of your crop in a prayer May the rest of your crop come to the maturity of this one amen you know what what brother Brandon was doing in those tapes is the kind of maturity we are to come to amen ex brother brand you say was a Wade sheath no the anointing of Jesus Christ is the Wade sheath and you come to the same maturity of producing all that you see in those dayses silver and gold I don't have but what I do have it's the name of Jesus Christ given to us throughout all ages that can produce the same thing that is produced throughout all ages amen a seal that has been held Through the Ages that's been given to us the message of this hour is not brother Brandon preaching it's God coming and revealing himself to you again and saying Adam where are you right Adam you know inside of you is a heart that says look I'm a son of God MH and a Son of God the first Son of God went to the Cross saying not my will your will be done you the Son of God is still saying the same thing not my will Lord your will be done and I will fulfill everything that this scripture is calling for this bride to fulfill that's what Jesus said I will fulfill all that the Christ is supposed to fulfill cuz he was the son of God and you being the Son of God again you will fulfill all that this bride says the scripture says this bride will be amen she'll be a faith seed she'll believe she'll hold to the word she'll understand what the seals are trying to tell you she'll understand what those seven Thunders are trying to reveal in this day and age that's a seal come on right John was told and let me go over to that John was told in Revelations 10 let's go over there I didn't mark it so let's go to it quickly Revelations 10 okay it says and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the and the angel which I saw stand upon the Seas and upon the Earth and upon and and lift up his voice to heaven and swore by him that liveth forever and ever that created the heavens and the things that there are in and the earth and the things that there are in and the Seas and the things that there are in which are there in and there that there should be time no longer that's right but in the days of the voice right of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished as he has declared it to his servants the prophets the breaking of a seal you see the breaking of a seal how does that have to do with breaking a seal John was told don't write it right 2,000 years ago John was told don't write this it's going to be revealed later it's going to be clear it's going to the Seal's going to be open you're going to open this bottle now come on you're going to eat partake and eat of what this things were hidden throughout all ages it's not for you John to tell everybody right now but it's going to come out at the end time it's going to be revealed to your bride glory to Jesus's bride now what are we looking at here we're looking at the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound amen you know we are in the days of the voice that's right and it's been revealed it's being revealed Glory what is it rapturing Faith how are we going to get there how are we going to get to to a faith that we can go beyond our physical abilities here amen how are we going to get beyond our bills how are we going to get beyond our our uh our our our trials we come to a place where we don't take what what's going on around us as real what's real is what he said right right right what's real is what the word calls us to be exactly right man you know uh the natural brother Brown said you can take God's word more than you can believe what's physical right you know what did Joshua do when he stopped the Sun the son Faithfully truly Faithfully without compromise rises in the East sets in the west it's so accurate we can set our clocks by but when Joshua stood up and said I need more Daylight son you stay there and moon you stay over there yeah till I finish this battle right what made him have that kind of Faith right he knew who he was right he had a commission what was it when when when Moses was told what was it when Moses was told at the edge of the Red Sea when he was standing there why Christ speak right why are you CED to me Moses speak and go forward amen oh god look the the enem is coming at us and we're stuck here against the sea we can't go nowhere we're going to be butchered Lord what are we going to do and God told him look I gave you the commission I told you what to do you're called to this whatever you say it's it's going to happen and Moses stood up and says you Ocean or see park right and we'll go over on dry land and you did it amen why why did it do it because he had a commission right amen what's our commission right right amen have you searched the word to see what your part is to play here do you know what you're so you're supposed to be doing in this day and age you know what faith you're supposed to be having you know what your word the word says about you right amen you have to know what the word says about you cuz you going to have to you know I don't know what's been happening to me yeah I keep dreaming that I'm in a concentration camp like in the days of Hitler okay bless it the Germans are after me and they've got me and I'm cornered and they've got my wife my kids and everybody there and in this dream I keep saying but you know I have no power here I I but you know what all in all I say you know what something keeps coming up in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus I don't care what the pressure is in the name of Jesus thank Lord you know one time I had a dream of a look kind of like a you ever seen those those pictures that they put on top of the the images they put up demons on top of of of temples and stuff wings and Claws and mouths and everything like look like a lion but has wings and and muscular looking animals that look like a dog kind of yeah well one of those was after me me and I was running with all I had and I saw a tree and I saw a branch kind of high and I said maybe I can jump at that branch and grab it and climb this tree before this thing gets me but it was fast by the time I got to the tree and went to reach up for the branch that thing had come right by me come up and he was sitting on the branch looking down at me with a mouth open and and just as he leaned back to Lunge at me when he leaned back to Lunge at me I says I claim the blood of Jesus Christ glory and just then as he was going out like that he stopped and he looked sideways quickly and he went that way and he didn't come down on me amen you realize what God has given us that's right amen what has God given us by giving us his name exactly amen that's it your kid get sick in the name of Jesus Christ that's right amen you get sick in the name of Jesus Christ that's right you get hurt in the name of Jesus Christ you call out on that name amen demons have to obey right in the name of Jesus Christ exactly there's power in the name Glory take the name of Jesus with you do everything you can but realize that's your Avenue of power right amen have faith in the name of Jesus Christ have faith in who you are as the Bride of Jesus Christ amen realize that's the resurrection power how do we get the Dynamics how can we have the Dynamics you know that seed that seed needs pure sunlight if you block off the sun and it don't get sunlight that seed don't grow in the natural same thing that seed needs water that seed needs Earth it needs to be in the earth it needs water to water it you can't put a bucket of burnt motor oil on top of that seed and expect it to grow you'll kill the seed you can't put salt water on top of that seed and expect it to grow it'll kill it right but if you're watered by the water of the word if you're studying and believing what the word of God says about you if you're looking into the message of this hour and you're taking what it says that's me amen you keep looking at that mirror and you say that's me right right that's right that little boy that was looking at that Mir he said that's me Mama yeah you keep looking at this word and used to keep saying that's me Joshua that's me right amen Moses that's me that's right and you start to believe that that is you EXA everything the word says about every patriarch that's you you have that faith you believe that word right and you'll take him at his word you're being watered by the water of the word that pure TST of clear water that'll suffice your soul amen reading you to a revelation that you know what the Dynamics come in gear with the mechanics you can't expect that you can have Dynamics if you got gasoline that's por half water y yeah you know you can't expect your car to run full of water amen water doesn't burn you your gas you can't expect to have your oil all sludged up you can't expect to have a spark of your G spark P gaps covered you can't expect to have air to get into your in mix with your gas if you have your filter plugged right your coils you don't have a coil you can't expect the Dynamics exactly but you know what this one here is Pentecost it's Jesus Christ bringing to pass all that this message has said would come to pass in The Bride of the last days right she's not going the scripture says she's not going to roll over right like that first church age because she was under the oage she's getting ready for a Rapture right she's not that same bride she is that same bride in faith right but she's the she's a bride that has come to a higher Revelation am a bigger truth because God has decided in this 20th century to reveal to us himself in the fullness of his word right you know you look at Jesus when Jesus looks at us he said she's bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh just like Adam said he's bone of my B she's bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh right you know when he looked at us through time when he thought about us in his mind he was thinking of a bride that would take him at his word right you know Joseph pointed out something to me he said you know if you keep saying I'm no good I I can't make it I'm not I wonder if I'm even a Christian yeah if you're professing things like that yeah if you you know God you take God at his word right right amen if you take him at his word don't you think he'll take you at your word if you start saying I'm not so sure I'm a Christian oh I don't know if I have faith or not I can't I maybe maybe I got to go to the you know if you don't take him at his word right if you don't if you don't if you profess things that are not as a Christian then he'll take you at your word right amen you're hurting yourself take him at his word right cuz he's he you can take him at his word he'll take you at your word so when you when you when you're under trial you come up and say look I'm a Son of God right I have a right to I have a right to be redeemed I have a right to my healing I have a right to everything I have a right to tell nature nature you back off right my pains aches and and hurts and pains that I go through you could tell turn to your pain and say pain you back off right I'm a Son of God and I believe God's word and I have a right to my healing my S my my healing is given to me cuz he paid for it at Calvary it's it's a finished work that's right realize I want to talk a little bit about raising uh resurrection power in the in Patriarchs of the days of old yeah you know the resurrecting power it's all through the scripture right Moses died the Angels carried him away and 800 years later at Mount Transfiguration he was standing there he said well you're not going to get to go into the promis he got to go into the promised land yeah you know there's no doubt he was there in Mount Transfiguration and he was talking to the Lord Jesus with Elijah you take a look at at at at where it is is you start looking at you know you look at the the the veil rent that earthquake that rent the rent The Veil Matthew 275 you look the veil was rent the earth quake happened the Rocks were rent the graves were open and many of the bodies of the Saints which slept arose right there is resurrection power in the Saints amen exactly if that scripture there that we just read on on uh on uh on Romans Romans it says but if the spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead dwells in you amen you know what I was telling the congregation at home I said you know what I was telling I I was telling them look you better be sure right now that you got the Holy Ghost right amen don't wait till you kick the bucket to say oh man I got the Holy Ghost don't wait till you're in trouble or having trouble to say oh I I want to have the Holy Ghost you seek it with all you got at this moment right now because if you don't have the Holy Ghost here you won't have the Holy Ghost there but if the spirit but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead dwells in you that raised okay in dwell dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwells in you that's where we stand amen we stand in a day when the true word of God has been revealed in our day and age amen when the Lord Jesus Christ has visited us once again through the ministry thank you Lord and you know what it didn't stop with brother Bram going off the scene that's right brother amen it still holds true because the fivefold ministry will keep on bringing the word of God to Quicken your martal bodies to the truth that's been presented in our day and age she'll the re revelation of the word of God is still being revealed amen and still coming to life remember that job when he stood there and he said you know what he says uh uh you know what even if the if if if I die and go by way of the Grave I'll be able to see God in my flesh why because he said I know my redeemer liveth that's right and even though I'm slay a lamb for my sins today y there is a redeemer and Jesus Christ came on the scene amen yep and we we stand here and we recognize that that quickening power 1 Thessalonians 4:16 the Lord himself yes shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and a trumpet of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first amen that's right you know and the 17th verse then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we all ever be with the Lord amen Comfort one another with these words right did you know that this scripture I can tell you this day this scripture is partially fulfilled you say why brother Daniel why is this state partially fulfilled come on that scripture is for the end time that scripture is right for the just for the Rapture no sir brother Brown said that the first part of that scripture the Lord himself shall descend with a shout was the message of this hour going forth the message of this hour was what you see in the tapes going forth the Rapture started amen the Rapture started think about that amen what kind of life should we be living the Rapture is on its way right amen amen be a faithful people believe God's word stand for the truth that's right here in our day and age cuz it's yours it's your possession okay then he said and with the voice of the Archangel brother Brown said that's the quickening of the dead that's the resurrection right and then he said and the trumpet that's the call to the wedding supper amen all right right it's already in its way part of the scripture has already been fulfilled Hallelujah let's stand to our feet amen as we close hallelujah oh Lord Jesus Lord we're so grateful Lord God for a day that we live in Lord Jesus Lord Jesus we
