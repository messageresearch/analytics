[0:02] it's on it
[0:05] so we're gonna try to finish up today
[0:08] don't start something else
[0:12] and if this works well we may go back
[0:14] through
[0:16] some other like major doctrinal stuff
[0:19] that we went through we'll see
[0:24] but if you got your Bible let's turn to
[0:28] Isaiah
[0:29] 65
[0:32] because we've left one we left one piece
[0:35] of the puzzle out
[0:36] all right
[0:38] last Sunday week Isaiah 65 thank you
[0:43] we left we left one element out
[0:48] because last Sunday we proved by the
[0:52] message and by the uh
[0:56] Bible that
[0:58] it took one week of
[1:00] of Messiah Ministry to get us an
[1:02] interact with one week of Messiah
[1:04] Ministry to get the Jews in a rapture
[1:07] and it's going to take a one week
[1:09] Ministry to the Earth
[1:12] to get the Earth redeemed right
[1:15] gotta have all three
[1:16] all right and remember we go ahead of
[1:19] the earth we go justification
[1:21] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24] the earth goes through a justification
[1:26] went through a justification under Noah
[1:29] when he baptized the Earth with water
[1:33] in the flood
[1:35] and then when Jesus Christ came on the
[1:38] earth he Sanctified it with his blood
[1:40] while his blood was dropping on the
[1:42] Earth
[1:42] you and I our bodies were in the Earth
[1:46] right
[1:47] so we sanctify the people
[1:50] and then it's waiting a baptism by fire
[1:55] right
[1:57] because we look and see that
[2:01] that in the Scripture it says
[2:05] Holy Ghost and Fire
[2:09] see God gives you the holy ghost at the
[2:10] new birth
[2:12] but one day he's going to burn you
[2:14] completely so much to where that the
[2:16] part that Mom and Daddy brought here is
[2:19] going to be changed back into an
[2:21] original creation all right or what that
[2:24] theophany looks like which is you
[2:27] so that's this Earth
[2:31] but this Earth down here has got to go
[2:32] through it too it's already went through
[2:34] justification already went through
[2:35] sanctification
[2:37] and the prophet said our body goes first
[2:39] and then read the future home
[2:42] then the world natural comes behind all
[2:47] right
[2:49] because the Earth was in a fallen
[2:51] condition if you read there in Romans we
[2:53] talk about the whole creation growth and
[2:56] travaleth waiting on what you and I to
[2:59] manifest ourselves so that the Earth can
[3:00] manifest itself because we're the ones
[3:04] that fell and then everything behind us
[3:06] all creation fell behind us and it's
[3:08] going to take whatever like we were
[3:11] talking about here the fall the fall
[3:13] what redeems us back is the same thing
[3:16] that the Jews fell from From Grace With
[3:19] God
[3:20] divorced her took a gentile bride
[3:24] takes her in the Rapture and then he's
[3:25] going to take this 144 thousand
[3:29] twelve thousand tribes 12 000 from each
[3:32] tribe 12 12 144.
[3:35] ain't gonna take them in a rapture
[3:38] after this three and a half years are
[3:40] 1260 days
[3:42] of Daniel 70 weeks
[3:45] that's prophesied in Revelations 11. but
[3:49] according to the Bible
[3:52] we've only accomplished 483 years
[3:56] to the birth of Christ I mean from the
[3:58] death of Christ excuse me
[4:01] for an 83 years
[4:03] Jesus said how many times do you forgive
[4:05] her brother well that's he's talking
[4:06] about you and he's talking about this
[4:08] Earth because this Earth's got to be
[4:10] forgiven too because it fell
[4:12] and I believe somewhere else in Isaiah
[4:14] I've been looking for it but I couldn't
[4:16] find it maybe we'll find it in a minute
[4:19] where God said I made this Earth to be
[4:21] inhabited and until a prophet came
[4:24] we all thought we were going to heaven
[4:26] somewhere off
[4:28] live on a cloud live in heaven go up
[4:32] come to find out we're going to go up
[4:35] for a little while God's going to clean
[4:36] this thing off and we're going to come
[4:37] right back down
[4:39] all right
[4:41] and live here this is where Heaven's
[4:43] going to be right okay so we miss those
[4:47] things let's let me go back maybe I can
[4:50] find it
[4:51] because I have it done
[4:53] right here turn right to it Isaiah 45
[4:58] now is this not the word of God and it
[5:01] will live Eternal right
[5:04] Isaiah 45
[5:08] Isaiah 45.
[5:12] verse 18.
[5:16] that's 317. this is going to tell
[5:23] but Israel shall be saved in the Lord
[5:25] with an everlasting salvation
[5:28] you shall be ashamed nor confounded
[5:31] shall not be ashamed nor confounded
[5:34] World Without End
[5:37] ah listen to this for thus saith the
[5:41] Lord that created the Heaven
[5:43] God himself that formed the Earth and
[5:45] made it he has established it he created
[5:48] it not in vain he formed it to be
[5:52] inhabited
[5:55] so brother Joe there's no doubt in my
[5:57] mind the Earth was made to be inhabited
[5:59] eternally
[6:00] right right I am the lord and there is
[6:03] none else
[6:04] okay that's enough right there
[6:07] all right now let's go back to Isaiah
[6:09] 65.
[6:12] all right
[6:16] for just a minute let's look at the
[6:19] chart so now we see that it was 483
[6:22] years
[6:23] a 62 week period and a seven week period
[6:25] brother Brown said there's three periods
[6:27] a seven week at 62 and a seven
[6:30] or one week I mean I'm sorry a seven
[6:32] week a 62 week in one week three periods
[6:35] 62 plus 7 is 69 and one more make 70.
[6:40] all right Jesus said in Matthew we read
[6:43] it last Sunday how many times do you
[6:45] forgive her brother he said 70 times 7
[6:48] which is what 490
[6:51] 483 years already been accomplished
[6:54] so there's one week left after the
[6:56] Rapture or seven years all right for the
[6:59] rest of this to culminate not to say
[7:01] that that the
[7:04] uh tribulation period is not seven years
[7:07] um
[7:09] Jesus didn't through two prophets
[7:12] doesn't preach for seven years
[7:13] there's only three and a half year
[7:15] Ministry of Jesus Christ left to be
[7:17] preached on the earth to take them in a
[7:19] Rapture but there's time left
[7:22] to come to this 490 and the Bible even
[7:26] says in Daniel blessed is those that
[7:28] live to be in the 1300 and something
[7:30] weak or 1300 something days that's 1260.
[7:34] blessed is the one that make it through
[7:36] all right now we'll see because remember
[7:39] during this time the foolish version is
[7:42] going to be hunted down and killed
[7:44] the battle of Armageddon is coming in
[7:46] here right in here and then there'll be
[7:48] a millennium Temple set up
[7:50] according to Ezekiel 42 44 somewhere
[7:53] after the Rapture of those Jews
[7:57] brother random said the two prophets to
[8:00] Israel were the Sixth Seal
[8:03] what is the six seal destruction they
[8:05] call down fire earthquakes Islands will
[8:08] be taken out of their place I believe
[8:11] the scripture even says that everything
[8:12] on top side of the earth will be shook
[8:14] even the heavens will be shook this time
[8:16] all right
[8:18] what God is doing is is he's showing
[8:21] that this thing's coming back to
[8:22] original right right
[8:25] where where man destroyed the world
[8:29] by flood or brother Brown said it could
[8:33] have been an atomic explosion I believe
[8:34] so where it shifted or Tilted the world
[8:37] over and it's going to bring that world
[8:39] right back and then we'll go back to
[8:41] what we'll go back to those prophetic
[8:43] days 30 days 30 days because we're going
[8:45] to read here God's not going to do away
[8:47] with the moon and the sun right and all
[8:50] those things
[8:51] he just said here that he created all
[8:53] this to be inhabited he created I
[8:55] believe that everything that God created
[8:57] originally was eternal yeah in the mind
[9:01] of God
[9:02] what Adam done is he forfeited the
[9:05] ability to bring it all to pass by doing
[9:08] what he did but doing what he did
[9:11] saved a lot more people all right
[9:14] foolish virgins and all the Jews and all
[9:16] those things like that
[9:17] now we see how it come into into big
[9:21] but we've got to get us into the
[9:23] millennium
[9:25] to build this Temple so let's read
[9:27] Isaiah 65
[9:31] and let's start
[9:35] with
[9:39] verse 16.
[9:44] that he who blesseth himself in the
[9:47] Earth shall bless himself in the god of
[9:50] Truth
[9:51] he that sweareth in the Earth shall
[9:53] swear by the god of truth because the
[9:55] former troubles are forgotten and
[9:57] because they are hidden from mine eyes
[10:01] for behold I create
[10:03] now listen
[10:05] that creates you and many times people
[10:08] say I create new Heaven and you work
[10:09] that's where everybody got the idea that
[10:11] God was just going to blow this one up
[10:12] and just build a whole new one
[10:15] we read in Isaiah that he wasn't going
[10:16] to do that
[10:18] he was just going to burn it off then
[10:19] the prophet comes in invisible oh Not
[10:22] Invisible Union but in
[10:24] um
[10:24] the future home and tells us that it'll
[10:27] be burnt off all right renew it right
[10:30] you renew it right
[10:32] because you and I when we're born again
[10:34] God didn't just kill this human you're
[10:37] looking at and raise up a new one he
[10:39] took what was already created and made
[10:42] it on you all right burn it off burn all
[10:46] the sin out of all the drops and all
[10:47] that while I'm still alive right here
[10:51] all right
[10:52] because he said I'll take my
[10:54] spirit and put it in your heart
[10:56] see he gives you a new spirit of
[10:59] sanctification
[11:00] which many people claim that as the holy
[11:03] spirit because it changes their attitude
[11:05] instead of their whole being all right
[11:07] but when you're born again what does it
[11:10] do God comes down and burns out the sin
[11:12] in your soul
[11:13] still got this old guy that does the
[11:16] center outside right same way with the
[11:18] Earth he came on the Earth
[11:20] he's always been here but look at all
[11:22] the sin look at all the things that
[11:24] that's going on and let's read
[11:27] for behold I create new heavens and a
[11:29] new Earth
[11:31] you notice a key there
[11:34] I create new heavens
[11:37] and he didn't say a new Earths right
[11:40] there's only one Earth
[11:43] okay there's many Heavens there's all
[11:46] the nebulas and all that I believe their
[11:48] solar system but there's only one Earth
[11:49] one Earth behold I create new heavens
[11:53] and a new Earth
[11:56] all right
[11:59] and the former shall not be remembered
[12:01] nor come into mind
[12:02] but be glad I'm enjoy us forever and
[12:04] that which I create for behold I create
[12:06] Jerusalem or endorsing and her people
[12:09] with joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem
[12:12] and join my people
[12:13] and the voice of the Weeping shall be no
[12:15] more hurting her another voice of crying
[12:17] there should be no no more fence in
[12:19] infinite days nor old man that has not
[12:21] filled this day the child shall die 100
[12:23] years old but the sinner being a hundred
[12:26] years old shall be a curse and they
[12:28] shall build houses and inhabit them now
[12:31] some of these things you can put into
[12:33] the future home some of them you cannot
[12:36] because we don't build houses in the
[12:38] future home
[12:39] Jesus said I go to prepare a place for
[12:41] you brother random said that's the
[12:43] difference between the Millennium and
[12:44] the future home your future home he's
[12:46] already built the house according to
[12:48] your desire
[12:50] right
[12:52] but this is that they shall build houses
[12:54] and inhabit them and they shall plant
[12:55] Vineyards and eat the fruit of them
[12:58] they shall not build in another and have
[13:00] it
[13:02] that means I built my you know Daddy
[13:04] builds a house and then when he passes
[13:06] away I get it and then when I pass away
[13:07] the son gets it
[13:09] that's not going to happen here because
[13:10] you're not going to die right
[13:13] they shall not build in an oven habit
[13:15] they shall not plant in another eat
[13:17] whereas the days of a tree of the days
[13:19] of my people in my election long enjoy
[13:21] the works of their hands all right
[13:25] they shall not labor in vain nor bring
[13:27] forth for trouble for they are the seed
[13:30] of the Blessed of the Lord and their
[13:31] offsprings with them there's the promise
[13:35] and it shall come to class that before
[13:37] they call I will answer them while they
[13:39] are yet speaking I will hear the wolf
[13:41] and the lamb shall feed together and the
[13:42] lion shall eat strong like the bullet
[13:44] and thus shall be the Serpent's meeting
[13:46] they shall not hurt nor destroy at all
[13:48] my Holy Mountain saith the Lord
[13:51] all right so there's a millennium coming
[13:55] the 70 weeks of Daniel when it
[13:58] Blends into the millennium
[14:01] it has brought the Earth to not a total
[14:04] restoration
[14:05] but remember
[14:07] you got justification sanctification the
[14:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you
[14:12] got the holy ghost coming with fire
[14:14] Holy Ghost and Fire
[14:17] right because you and I received the
[14:19] Holy Ghost but we're not changed we're
[14:22] changed on the inside but this guy's
[14:24] still dying all right the Earth was
[14:26] changed it's changed here in the
[14:28] millennium
[14:29] but according to everything else it's
[14:32] still dying because the devil's still
[14:34] alive the devil's still here they're
[14:36] still evil but not where we're going to
[14:37] be the evil will be suppressed
[14:40] but the Bible said let's go over now and
[14:43] let's see where the Holy Ghost
[14:45] that's the type here of the baptism of
[14:47] the Holy Ghost the Millennium is right
[14:48] because they're still sin
[14:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost half of the
[14:52] Millennium because it going to this day
[14:54] but it's restored the Earth It's
[14:56] Beginning a process to bring everything
[14:57] back all right but let's read now where
[15:00] the fire comes in over in Revelation
[15:04] chapter 20.
[15:17] well let's just read now
[15:22] because what's going to happen that 490
[15:24] God's going to forgive this Earth
[15:26] he's going to
[15:28] wipe it off by man's fire this is going
[15:31] to be a nuclear Holocaust and it's going
[15:33] to blow everything up everything's going
[15:35] to be remembering Malachi 4 says we
[15:38] would walk out on the ashes of the
[15:39] wicked all right so everything's going
[15:41] to be turned to Ash all right and then
[15:44] everything in a thousand years is going
[15:46] to do like the Garden of Eden is going
[15:47] to just grow right back up all right
[15:49] what great fertilizer
[15:52] that's right
[15:54] then then people and animals and it's
[15:57] what you're putting in your gas tank now
[15:59] from the flood and all those plates
[16:01] turned upside down matched all the
[16:03] vegetation in the people in the
[16:04] dinosaurs and the cars and the buildings
[16:06] and whatever was before the flood maxed
[16:09] all that down and that's why out in the
[16:10] Gulf of Mexico that's why that oil is
[16:12] coming up because they made a hole and
[16:14] all that stuff coming back out of the
[16:15] ground and it's dead people they say all
[16:17] plants and animals and well yeah and
[16:19] people were there too
[16:22] Jehovah Witnesses one time when they
[16:24] came to the house they were talking
[16:25] about heaven and the fact that we were
[16:27] going to walk out in the ashes of the
[16:29] wicked and I said you know the Lord
[16:31] showed me something this week I said
[16:33] where are all those Wicked people
[16:35] they're not up there somewhere they're
[16:37] right here on Earth because they think
[16:39] they're going right exactly yeah I think
[16:40] they're all going to come up yeah
[16:45] but we'll walk out and we'll be able to
[16:47] build and inhabit our own home
[16:50] this is not the future home coming down
[16:52] with the mountain pushing up and the
[16:54] gold streets of gold that's not the
[16:56] Millennium all right does everybody
[16:57] understand that we may go through that
[16:59] maybe and maybe clarify that since our
[17:02] mind's fresh on it we may go through
[17:03] that maybe in the next couple weeks so
[17:05] and clarify that but here in Revelations
[17:07] Watch What Happens here chapter 20.
[17:10] now saw an angel come down from heaven
[17:12] having the key of the bottomless pit and
[17:14] a great chain in his hand and laid hold
[17:16] on the dragon that old serpent which is
[17:18] the devil and Satan and bound him a
[17:21] thousand years and cast him in the
[17:23] bottom of the spin and shut him up and
[17:25] set a seal upon him that should deceive
[17:26] the Nations no more
[17:29] excuse me until a thousand years should
[17:30] be before excuse me to fulfill and after
[17:33] that he must be loose a little season
[17:35] now here's his loosing
[17:39] think now John stops
[17:43] said I saw Thrones and they that sat
[17:45] upon them
[17:47] I saw Thrones and they which is going to
[17:50] be us
[17:51] sat upon them and Jacob was given unto
[17:53] them and I saw the souls of them that
[17:55] would be headed for the witness of Jesus
[17:57] for the word of God which are not
[17:59] worship the Beast and our damage neither
[18:00] received the mark on his head let's stop
[18:02] right there but no it's going to verse
[18:04] five just the same time
[18:07] excuse me but the rest of the Dead live
[18:10] not again until the thousand years were
[18:12] finished
[18:13] this is the first resurrection so all
[18:15] the people is going to die here at
[18:16] Armageddon is going to have to stay dead
[18:18] for that thousand years then they're
[18:19] going to come up in a white Throne
[18:21] judgment all right
[18:22] now listen to verse 7.
[18:24] this brings into being
[18:28] this is the Fire part
[18:31] okay
[18:33] the Earth is already going through her
[18:35] change
[18:37] in the Millennium right the devil's
[18:40] being suppressed they're still demons
[18:43] but they're not in us or around us
[18:45] they're all suppressed brother Brown
[18:46] said that chain was not a log chain it
[18:48] was a chain of circumstances there's
[18:50] nobody gonna be able to uh hey if we all
[18:52] had wonderful thoughts today that would
[18:54] defeat a lot of the devil just right now
[18:57] if we just cast everything away and not
[18:59] do that you know not be healed against
[19:01] our brother or our sister right that
[19:03] would do a lot of that what's going to
[19:04] happen in in the Millennium is that
[19:06] we're going to be see we're going to be
[19:08] in our full estate
[19:10] right here
[19:13] Bonnie spirit and so we're going to be
[19:15] Eternal right I believe the same thing
[19:17] for the 144 000. now and the ones that
[19:20] come back in this resurrection that died
[19:23] in here but you got a lot of people that
[19:25] died in here
[19:27] that I don't know about that's something
[19:29] another subject to get into
[19:31] but they're all going to have to stay
[19:33] dead the only people is going to be
[19:35] alive in the millenniums as far as I
[19:37] know for a fact is you and I are the
[19:39] bride the 144 000 and Jesus Christ
[19:42] himself right that's all that I know you
[19:44] understand what I'm saying because there
[19:46] are brother Reynolds talks about heathen
[19:48] being raised up in the Millennium that
[19:50] we preach the gospel to now maybe we'll
[19:52] get a little further deep into that but
[19:54] it says right here it says the rest of
[19:56] the Dead live not again until the
[19:57] thousand years were finished
[19:59] okay but see after that Thousand Years
[20:01] the devil's going to be loosed for a
[20:03] season now one is a season we're Eternal
[20:05] season could be another Thousand Years
[20:07] wow
[20:08] but I don't believe it will be I just
[20:10] believe it'll be a time and what they're
[20:12] going to do is it's right here
[20:14] verse 7.
[20:15] and when a thousand years are expired
[20:18] Satan shall be loosed out of his prison
[20:20] and shall go out to deceive the Nations
[20:23] which are in the four corners of the
[20:25] Earth
[20:26] that had to come from somewhere
[20:30] and he had to be able to work through
[20:31] them and not us it can't work through us
[20:33] right
[20:36] Gog and Magog to gather them together to
[20:38] battle in the number of whom is the
[20:40] Sands of the sea
[20:41] and they went up on the breath of the
[20:44] earth and can pass the camp of the
[20:46] Saints about and the Beloved City
[20:49] and fire came down from God out of
[20:52] heaven
[20:52] and devoured them
[20:56] and they killed him and said devour them
[20:59] okay so there's your Holy Ghost all
[21:01] right here's your justification
[21:03] sanctification when Jesus died at the
[21:05] cross
[21:06] your baptism of the Holy Ghost into the
[21:08] millennium
[21:10] because what we're talking about we're
[21:11] talking about Redemption
[21:12] three stages of redemption but brother
[21:14] Brandon remember there was four bugs
[21:16] that eat it down
[21:17] four bugs you got to bring or four
[21:19] Messengers got to bring back to their
[21:20] life messages
[21:22] justification sanctification back to the
[21:24] Holy Ghost and the word
[21:25] which is your justification
[21:27] certification baptism the Holy Ghost and
[21:29] Fire
[21:30] what's going to clean us up the fire
[21:32] that proceeds out of the mouth of God
[21:34] and the scripture is not a sword
[21:37] he said a flaming sword it's not a
[21:39] literal sword it's what the word of God
[21:40] right right so the word of God is a
[21:43] consuming fire and watch what's going to
[21:45] happen with this Gog and Magog we're
[21:46] going to come to the end of the
[21:47] Millennium
[21:48] white Throne judgment whatever you want
[21:51] you know we'll put all that in
[21:52] perspective but what's going to happen
[21:53] is is that fire is going to consume our
[21:57] devour those evil spirits and then what
[21:59] happens
[22:01] excuse me verse 21.
[22:05] and I saw a new Heaven
[22:07] and a new Earth now come from heavens
[22:10] to heaven
[22:13] all the dimensions are coming together
[22:16] because you can say to people in the
[22:17] sixth Dimension are in a half yeah right
[22:20] so there's Dimensions right all right
[22:24] chapter 21 and I saw a new Heaven and a
[22:26] new Earth for the first Heaven and the
[22:27] first Earth will pass away and there
[22:29] were no more Seas right and I saw John
[22:32] the holy sit and I John saw the holy
[22:34] city New Jerusalem coming down from God
[22:37] out of heaven
[22:39] so what's going to happen after the
[22:40] Thousand Years this is what I believe
[22:42] God's Gonna burn this thing off again
[22:43] with a holy fire kill all the devils
[22:46] right well the Devils didn't get killed
[22:49] right here at the battle of Armageddon
[22:50] that just pushed him down under in
[22:53] another dimension so that they can't
[22:54] bother us then they're going to be able
[22:56] to raise back up
[22:57] but what's going to happen in this
[23:00] fire that's coming this is God's fire
[23:02] fire came down from God
[23:05] right out of heaven and devoured them so
[23:09] we're not going to see these no more and
[23:10] the devil that deceived them was cast
[23:12] into the Lake of Fire Brimstone where
[23:14] the Beast and the false prophet are in
[23:15] other words they're going to get theirs
[23:16] first
[23:18] all right and Shelby told me today and
[23:20] not forever and ever
[23:22] and then he sees a white Throne judgment
[23:24] coming out with books then here you got
[23:26] John saw the holy city and you Jerusalem
[23:28] coming down from God out of Heaven
[23:29] preparing as a bride and the Lord for a
[23:32] husband
[23:32] what John stall was the city with us
[23:36] coming down and settling on a mountain
[23:38] brother Brown proves what that mountain
[23:40] was remember it pushes up
[23:42] it's 1500 Miles Square at an angle a
[23:45] pyramid angle pyramid mountain and we're
[23:48] going to live on that because there's no
[23:49] way the Bible says you can see him day
[23:51] and night you can see the light of the
[23:53] Lamb which is
[23:55] I mean from here to it's 900 miles from
[23:58] here to
[23:59] Bartlesville I know that because we've
[24:01] been there before but you take another
[24:04] 600 miles past that
[24:07] and it's an incline from here to there
[24:08] well if you can see forever you can see
[24:11] that far that's not a problem right but
[24:13] it's almost a whole
[24:15] almost compassion to hold the United
[24:17] States as far as a square so it's going
[24:20] to be where we can see the lamb is the
[24:22] light because it tells you here
[24:25] in down in the verse
[24:30] verse 23 and the city had no need of the
[24:33] sun neither of the moon to shine in it
[24:35] but the glory of God did lighten it and
[24:37] the lamb was lighting up somewhere in
[24:39] there to save time
[24:40] it tells you that it'll always be seen
[24:43] that way
[24:44] even if you had a wall
[24:47] the walls are going to be like 200 feet
[24:48] high
[24:50] Ivory and all these stones and Jasper
[24:53] and Jasmine and Burl and Onyx and all
[24:56] that he said man that's you can't see
[24:58] nothing but if it's in an incline
[25:01] you can stand outside the city and look
[25:03] up and you can see the top of the
[25:04] mountain always anywhere you go right
[25:06] and it's going to be in Jerusalem well
[25:09] see now
[25:11] now what's going to happen
[25:14] let's go back to verse three and I heard
[25:16] a great voice out of Heaven saying
[25:17] behold the Tabernacle of God is with men
[25:19] now why didn't he say that at the
[25:21] millennium
[25:23] it is in the bride but they still other
[25:26] people that's got to come in and be
[25:28] giving eternal life and to watch their
[25:30] own judgment so Redemption is not
[25:31] complete until the Battle of God and
[25:34] Magog all those demons are killed now
[25:36] and you're either going to be a sheep or
[25:39] a goat
[25:40] right
[25:41] everybody understand that we'll go let's
[25:43] go we'll do that maybe next next week or
[25:45] so we'll go over the uh
[25:48] the difference in the Millennium and a
[25:49] future home and take it maybe step by
[25:51] step
[25:52] but in the millennium
[25:55] and I don't and I don't understand where
[25:57] it says an old man will live 900 and
[26:00] Center will die 100 years old and a
[26:02] young child will not die and all those
[26:03] things maybe we'll get in and see what
[26:05] the prophet said about it all right I
[26:07] just know one thing for sure during the
[26:09] Millennium there's still going to be a
[26:10] devil
[26:12] somewhere right but when we get in that
[26:15] future home they won't be no demons
[26:17] right right there won't be nothing but
[26:19] pure holy
[26:21] good because he said I heard a great
[26:23] voice out of Heaven saying behold the
[26:24] Tabernacle of God is with men and he
[26:27] will dwell with them and they shall be
[26:28] his people and God himself shall be with
[26:31] them
[26:32] excuse me be their God
[26:34] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[26:36] their eyes there shall be no more death
[26:38] nor sorrow no crying
[26:40] you know he didn't pronounce it being no
[26:42] more deaf talking about the millennium
[26:45] because somebody's gonna die at the end
[26:46] of that Millennium all those demons are
[26:48] at least they're gonna die right they're
[26:49] real people as we're real as we are and
[26:51] God's got to kill them that's why he's
[26:53] got to kill this thing with fire
[26:54] to take it to Rapture because if you
[26:56] don't get this kill with fire you got to
[26:58] go by the grave and that's your fiery
[26:59] grave that you got to come back up
[27:01] through the Earth
[27:02] to get your body same body but to get
[27:05] your theophany back into your body that
[27:07] you're living in all right
[27:09] now do away with it he didn't do away
[27:11] with the Earth remember he cleaned it
[27:13] and he still hadn't done away with him
[27:15] with a future homecoming down but he
[27:17] burnt that thing off with Holy Fire
[27:19] where there is no
[27:21] there's no mention of the devil anymore
[27:23] all right after this
[27:27] and he that sat upon the throne
[27:30] I'm sorry there should be no more death
[27:32] nor sorrow nor crying neither shall
[27:35] there be any more pain for the former
[27:37] things are passed away and he that sat
[27:39] upon the throne said behold I make all
[27:41] things new
[27:42] and he said unto me right for these
[27:44] words are true and faithful
[27:46] and he said unto me it is done I am out
[27:48] when Amiga the beginning and the end I
[27:50] will give unto him that is the verse of
[27:52] The Fountains of Water of Life freelance
[27:53] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[27:56] things
[27:58] and come down to the church ages seven
[27:59] times
[28:01] it tells about that it tells those who
[28:03] have overcome I'll give this and give
[28:05] this well see this is number eight
[28:07] that puts you into eternity Aid is
[28:09] always eternity seven is still
[28:10] Millennium you're still in seven sevens
[28:12] is 49 7s seven means completion but not
[28:16] eternity right right but when you get
[28:19] into that Eighth Day
[28:22] you're complete the 50. that's what
[28:24] brother Brown saw when he preached a
[28:26] future home he said oh brother Brown you
[28:27] run out of your types you got sevens you
[28:29] got sevens you got seven
[28:30] took them back to Leviticus and showed
[28:32] them where there was an eighth day a
[28:34] holy convocation and that's what we're
[28:36] talking about right now the holy this is
[28:37] the holy convocation that all creatures
[28:40] are looking for
[28:41] because everything's restored back
[28:44] foolish virgins giving eternal life a
[28:46] cup of water my name's been given
[28:47] eternal life Old Testament Saints or
[28:49] eternal
[28:50] we're we're Eternal before that 144 000
[28:54] but everything else catches up
[28:56] through the Millennium just like you
[28:58] were the Holy Ghost she was born again
[28:59] with the Holy Ghost maybe 15 years ago
[29:01] did you understand the message no not
[29:03] all of them what you grew just like this
[29:07] in this Millennial we're going to grow
[29:08] in great we're not yes the Earth is
[29:11] because the Earth is we're already out
[29:12] here and the Earth is moving toward that
[29:17] time okay all right so it's moving
[29:21] but all's been forgiven when we start
[29:23] into that Millennium as far as because
[29:26] remember the 70 weeks was to Daniel and
[29:29] his people and the City
[29:32] okay
[29:34] so New Jerusalem is going to be the
[29:36] temple is going to be rebuilt but this
[29:38] is New Jerusalem
[29:40] coming down from God out of Heaven has
[29:43] nothing to do with this but we got to go
[29:45] through this to get there
[29:46] all right so does the Earth right the
[29:49] Earth just follows the Earth is catching
[29:50] up
[29:51] it is done I'm Alpha and Omega the
[29:53] beginning and the end I will give them
[29:55] to him that it thirsts The Fountains of
[29:56] water blind freely either it overcome it
[29:58] shall inherit all things and I will be
[30:00] his gun and he shall be my son
[30:03] fearful and unbelieving and abominable
[30:05] murders more mongers remember look what
[30:08] they happened to them the second death
[30:11] and watch your own judgment that fiery
[30:13] death they're going to be done away with
[30:15] right
[30:19] now
[30:21] anybody have any questions
[30:24] our comments
[30:26] I think first you already have one you
[30:28] got another one I always thought that
[30:30] when the devil was loose first season
[30:31] that that was the Judgment
[30:34] am I wrong about that
[30:37] because what's going to happen is
[30:40] it's gonna happen something we're in
[30:42] their clothes when the devil's loose
[30:44] brother Brown if you'll read in the
[30:45] future home he says he brings his army
[30:48] up against
[30:49] us that are hearing a millennium all
[30:51] right and then we'll get into it and
[30:53] read it because I knew there'd be some
[30:55] questions about it so we'll go into it
[30:57] maybe next Sunday but what's going to
[30:59] happen is he's going to raise up with a
[31:02] group and try to overthrow us because
[31:04] the devil still thinks he can he can
[31:06] handle us you know he just he still
[31:07] thinks he can he can do it you say well
[31:09] how can he do that and let's be Eternal
[31:11] he's still fighting God and he knows
[31:12] God's Eternal right he knows God created
[31:15] it
[31:16] uh he ought to be the one that knows it
[31:18] because that's the one that created it
[31:19] he just forgot
[31:21] but then you raise up after the
[31:23] Millennium and then brother random said
[31:25] all the saints will be brought off the
[31:26] Earth in other words put in another
[31:28] dimension and God's just going to wipe
[31:29] it off now what does it matter if the if
[31:32] the white Throne judgment's right in
[31:33] there somewhere that's fine that's okay
[31:35] where he burns it off and then then
[31:37] they're they're there no more but
[31:39] there's got to be a white Throne
[31:40] judgment whether it's done at dog and
[31:41] Magog I don't know
[31:44] where it says
[31:46] she raised our hands you gotta raise
[31:48] your hand I'll have my hand back okay I
[31:51] can't see that
[31:52] okay
[31:54] I was wondering about the
[31:58] not having no need of Sun or the moon
[32:01] that's not going to get rid of it no it
[32:03] says we won't need he said the city
[32:05] won't need it right outside I believe
[32:08] it's going to be daylight and dark right
[32:09] they like dark moon stars God's not
[32:12] going to do away with anything he
[32:14] created he's just gonna bring it right
[32:16] back to the original I was thinking
[32:31] in the city
[32:33] there will be no need of light because
[32:35] that whole hey it's going to be
[32:36] transparent gold
[32:38] and if we're glowing man gold glows when
[32:41] it you know when the when the light hits
[32:44] it so we're not gonna have to worry
[32:45] about that because it says you won't
[32:47] need it didn't say it be done away with
[32:50] he said you won't need it in the city
[32:52] we just don't know outside that City
[32:54] they couldn't
[32:56] I just don't think everything's going to
[32:58] be plastic like little flowers and it's
[33:01] never going to grow it's just going to
[33:02] stand in one place I just don't believe
[33:04] that I just don't believe that God's so
[33:07] um put these where we had seeds and we
[33:09] got garden and we got things like that
[33:11] he put Adam in an eternal condition he
[33:14] put Adam in the Garden of Eden
[33:16] to do what
[33:18] heals us all right
[33:23] I mean Adam wasn't Eternal yet but God
[33:25] was getting ready to put him in that
[33:27] condition the Earth was perfect in that
[33:30] Garden of Eden and he said there's no
[33:32] man here to tell the song right so he
[33:34] put Adam in human flesh so he could and
[33:36] I mean it wasn't by the sweat of his
[33:38] brow yet
[33:40] right I don't believe Adam sweat because
[33:42] now God said in Genesis he said now
[33:46] you'll work the rest of your life about
[33:49] a sweat of your brow to raise up your
[33:51] children and and you know take life and
[33:54] all that yeah God created everything a
[33:56] lot of people
[34:00] sure didn't I believe they'll plant
[34:04] trees and grow and not inside the city
[34:06] the Bible says
[34:09] there'll be a tree of life
[34:12] and that uh
[34:14] Kings will come into the city right and
[34:17] take a leaf
[34:19] for the healing of the nations take it
[34:21] back out
[34:22] now if that tree didn't grow
[34:25] eventually during eternity somewhere
[34:27] they're gonna pick that tree down to
[34:29] nothing
[34:32] it's well matters of fruit seed you're
[34:33] going to have we're gonna be able to eat
[34:35] we just won't have to
[34:39] explain that League
[34:42] it doesn't matter to me it's all for the
[34:45] it's for the Nations for the Kings right
[34:47] ain't got nothing to do with the bride
[34:48] ain't got nothing to do with us all
[34:50] right it's just there for God to
[34:53] um
[34:53] I guess as an example
[34:55] because what did Rome used to do Rome
[34:58] used to do that when they go out and
[35:00] Conquer they'd send gifts or they'd send
[35:02] uh leave you saw those things that go
[35:04] around the
[35:05] the hands of the of the uh Caesars and
[35:09] all those you know they had the little I
[35:10] can't remember what the name of those
[35:11] leaves are
[35:13] but
[35:15] that was because they had conquered
[35:16] somewhere and they was given that lead
[35:19] for our flower or whatever so
[35:21] that'll just be to show that that there
[35:24] won't be any more war
[35:25] there won't be anything going on because
[35:27] the people on the outside I don't know
[35:29] that they're going to live different
[35:30] than you and I but I don't see how God
[35:33] can
[35:34] make us Sons and Daughters of God
[35:37] give us all the promises in this Bible
[35:39] and then give that guy that changed your
[35:42] tire one day that never even thought God
[35:44] was nothing and God said hey I'm giving
[35:47] you eternal life right his somewhere in
[35:50] his
[35:51] knowledge of thinking he's going to have
[35:53] to be lower than you not saying lower as
[35:56] far as being a like illiterate like we
[35:58] are but it surely it would be illiterate
[36:00] because illiterate's not bad litterness
[36:02] just means you don't know they don't
[36:04] know anything about God and here you've
[36:05] got a group of people us can walk
[36:08] outside that City see they can come in
[36:10] the city but they can't stay
[36:12] we'll get into all that but they have to
[36:14] go back out but we can go out and sit
[36:16] down under a tree one day and just teach
[36:18] them about God teach them about all this
[36:19] you know oh that's just going now so we
[36:22] need to go
[36:24] then next Sunday and all of you that are
[36:28] dating I mean that's going to the uh
[36:32] um
[36:33] camping trip
