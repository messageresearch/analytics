[0:13] you can't get this thing to work
[0:16] Ryan that's why you couldn't hear
[0:18] there's no audience the audio comes from
[0:20] theirs all right so let's go to Second
[0:22] Peter one
[0:23] and we we're through this study of the
[0:25] Statue of a perfect man which is over
[0:27] here on the board then that the prophet
[0:29] grew for us and put this thing together
[0:33] I was uh reading some quotes this
[0:35] morning that where brother Brown said
[0:38] that um
[0:39] that in
[0:42] I'm not gonna pull that door shut
[0:43] there's nobody in there they're not yeah
[0:48] Lord's not here
[0:50] I don't know if he's coming or not
[0:52] apparently yeah
[0:55] Paul went in his mama's class
[0:58] okay
[0:59] second Peter 1 3. of course that's his
[1:02] divine power hath given unto us all
[1:04] things
[1:05] that pertaineth unto life and godliness
[1:07] so what we're talking about is we're
[1:09] talking about life
[1:10] and had to be Godly in this life all
[1:13] right
[1:14] through the knowledge of him they have
[1:16] called us to glory and virtue whereby
[1:18] are given unto us exceeding great and
[1:20] precious promises that by these what
[1:23] these promises that God's made us you
[1:25] might be partakers of the divine nature
[1:27] now remember let me just kind of
[1:29] background a minute we were born with
[1:31] not a divine nature right our nature was
[1:35] the children of Wrath as you see David
[1:37] here he's crying out to God for the
[1:39] things that he done the sins that he
[1:41] done and the iniquity in his life and
[1:43] all the things that's going on David has
[1:46] a struggle because David can't get the
[1:48] new birth so he's got that war going on
[1:51] that we have but our war is in the
[1:53] spirit Realm
[1:55] all right
[1:57] because remember this body only does
[1:58] what motivates inside that's right and
[2:01] and not saying anything against any you
[2:04] know we got our new brothers and sister
[2:05] back here but smoking smoking doesn't
[2:08] come from the spirit
[2:10] it's motivated by the thing that's in
[2:14] there
[2:15] same way with you and I I used to chew
[2:17] tobacco every day just like doing just
[2:20] like smoking
[2:22] for 20 years Danny knows that we went
[2:24] fishing together many times
[2:27] but you know one day when God saved my
[2:29] soul it stopped that day
[2:32] I went from Tuesday night
[2:36] all right Jim I was dipping on tears
[2:38] tonight yeah Wednesday I came to church
[2:40] gave my heart to God I never put another
[2:42] drop in my mouth because God took that
[2:44] desire away because your body craves
[2:46] that right hey people I'm telling you
[2:48] it's hard it's a hard devil to get rid
[2:50] of okay but your body craves that thing
[2:54] I see them your body craves that thing
[2:56] well when your body craves that thing
[2:58] you've got to have something to change
[2:59] because look the divine nature of God
[3:02] doesn't smoke the divine nature of God
[3:05] does is Curse the divine nature of God
[3:07] doesn't to you and you can name all
[3:08] these different things but it comes back
[3:09] to the it comes back to having gone in
[3:12] your soul right not just something that
[3:14] makes you feel good right
[3:16] we're not talking about a feel-good
[3:17] gospel here we're talking about living
[3:19] and that's what this is life and
[3:21] godliness so we're looking at life that
[3:23] we're living and godliness it's a
[3:25] process you go through justification
[3:27] where God forgives you of you past sins
[3:29] right
[3:30] those are done whatever you did in your
[3:32] pastor done if you ask God to forgive
[3:35] you he's just the Bible says he's just
[3:38] to forgive you so
[3:39] whatever you've done in the past it's
[3:41] done right even if you were a prostitute
[3:44] right doesn't matter if you're Justified
[3:47] and you're in God's eyes you're just as
[3:50] virgin as the next person but now
[3:52] there's certain things you can't do and
[3:53] you can't deny it yourself
[3:55] that's why you have a war in your spirit
[3:57] because your memory remembers it
[3:59] right your reasoning says you did it
[4:01] that's right
[4:02] you're conscious absolutely bothers you
[4:06] you're affectionate and Imagination and
[4:08] all those things are still there so
[4:10] there's the war of the fight but down in
[4:12] that Soul if you've been truly Justified
[4:14] God's putting you toward a place that he
[4:17] can sanctify you
[4:18] all right and then under sanctification
[4:20] that's where you get the unclean Spirit
[4:22] out
[4:24] the Bible says there in Matthew that
[4:27] that he gets he he's the unclean Spirit
[4:29] goes out of a man walks in dry places
[4:31] seek his breath finds none comes back
[4:33] makes you worse if you don't get the
[4:35] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is the most
[4:37] important thing that's the divine nature
[4:40] of God you were born with your parents
[4:42] nature and the nature of the devil
[4:44] everybody was that's right there's only
[4:46] one person that wasn't that's Jesus
[4:48] Christ amen so everybody everybody's on
[4:51] the same level we're no one big up here
[4:52] in a little down here and just this and
[4:54] just no we all start at the same level
[4:57] we're lost that's right and until God
[4:59] brings us to our knowledge of being lost
[5:02] we're lost that's right and we're going
[5:04] you know what you do the nature of lost
[5:06] people that's right it's like Dave
[5:07] Ramsey said he said if you do rich
[5:09] people things
[5:11] you'll become rich if you do poor people
[5:13] things you're gonna stay poor and that's
[5:15] just the truth in natural life but the
[5:16] same way in spiritual life
[5:19] I can't help this this is the way I was
[5:21] born yeah there's certain things you
[5:22] can't help but the Holy Ghost gives you
[5:24] a divine nature
[5:26] and that's what we're talking about here
[5:27] with these verses it's a divine nature
[5:29] that comes into you this is not just
[5:31] playing church and coming to church and
[5:33] feeling good now it's going out there
[5:35] and living it before others right that's
[5:38] the walk
[5:39] okay
[5:40] I was just gonna say
[5:43] that you said that when you came before
[5:46] that Wednesday night it was gone
[5:48] I felt it going I mean I knew it was
[5:50] gone I just want for their benefit my
[5:53] dad you know my dad sure um loved it
[5:55] true question but he went for years he
[5:58] went for a long time with the smoking
[6:00] tree and when the prophet
[6:03] he said he could not remember how many
[6:05] cartons of cigarettes he threw away you
[6:07] know
[6:08] but then when he was called out he said
[6:11] on the way home he threw that pack out
[6:13] the window he never had the desire again
[6:15] but I mean sometimes it takes a while
[6:18] sure it takes a while I'm just telling
[6:21] you that that even uh sister Paul Bush
[6:24] uh Donny's Mama where's Susan yeah
[6:28] Donny's mom
[6:32] that's the first time I hadn't seen you
[6:34] in the crowd
[6:35] I just haven't heard
[6:37] but but sister
[6:39] um
[6:40] Sister Hazel she smoked for a while and
[6:43] that's okay but we gotta remember this
[6:45] is a process same way with being born
[6:48] again this is the process once you get
[6:50] the divine nature see says having
[6:53] escaped the corruption that is in the
[6:55] world through us now we all believe the
[6:56] Bible right the bibles are absolute in
[6:58] this church the Bible is the absolute so
[7:01] we take the absolute that if we get the
[7:03] divine nature of God it automatically
[7:06] pushes those things out see I had a
[7:07] desire
[7:08] when I was dipping and doing those
[7:10] things and I told you I used to cuss
[7:11] like a sailor remember I told you that I
[7:15] knew I was delivered because God one day
[7:17] I was talking on the phone and I was
[7:19] getting ready to
[7:20] to say the bad word that used to come
[7:23] out so freely
[7:25] and it was like somebody hit me in the
[7:28] chest it was God that hit me in the
[7:30] chair yes right yeah all right I mean
[7:33] because I said those words freely
[7:35] because I didn't have a divine nature
[7:37] okay I had my own nature I had a nature
[7:39] that I was born with which is contrary
[7:42] to God and we all were born I said
[7:44] everybody but Jesus Christ so
[7:45] everybody's on the same level doesn't
[7:46] matter if it's Prophet priest or King we
[7:49] were all born lost and needed to have
[7:51] this new nature put in us right then
[7:54] once we get that new nature put in US
[7:57] we've still got a divine nature to live
[7:59] by that's right
[8:01] that's what we're talking about now so
[8:02] this is this is not just this is not
[8:05] just
[8:06] going to church and living right I got
[8:09] some quotes maybe we'll get to them or
[8:10] not but brother Brown said it's not how
[8:12] much you shout it's not how much you
[8:14] speak in tongues it's not how much you
[8:15] know the Bible he said it's how much you
[8:17] can live the nine spiritual gifts out
[8:19] there in the world which is love joy
[8:21] peace long-suffering meekness kindness
[8:23] patience right things like that all
[8:25] right and you project that
[8:28] because the uh
[8:30] people that were in the Old Testament
[8:32] they were called Christians because the
[8:34] word Christian means christ-like
[8:36] in other words the people that saw
[8:38] Christ walking on the earth they saw
[8:40] Peter James and John
[8:42] walking on the earth just like Christ
[8:44] did so they called them Christians all
[8:46] right so that's the way you and I have
[8:48] to be we have to be Christian
[8:50] to be identified with Christ but if you
[8:52] have the divine nature of God God wants
[8:55] to still give you more gifts he wants to
[8:57] still give you more promises seed
[9:00] exceeding great and precious promises
[9:02] not just little ones exceeding he wants
[9:04] to abound and besides this giving all
[9:07] diligence in other words
[9:09] let's just don't make this an everyday
[9:10] thing
[9:12] besides just giving all Dylan it will
[9:14] just add to your faith virtue
[9:16] virtue knowledge and all its Temperance
[9:18] Temperance patience
[9:20] patience godliness now we're on patience
[9:23] now this is not just
[9:26] patience
[9:30] uh as in the world if you know it's like
[9:33] um
[9:35] I would say that you know well let's say
[9:37] for example brother Tatum brother Tatum
[9:39] was the most patient person in the world
[9:40] those of you that knew him he was so
[9:43] patient but now he said this come out of
[9:45] his mouth before he got born again
[9:48] he was a rascal
[9:50] he only went to that church to see
[9:52] sister Tatum he didn't go to that church
[9:53] to see God
[9:55] he just went to the church to go see
[9:57] sister Tam all right it's hard to
[9:58] believe it same way Jim just went to
[10:00] church with me she'd come to church with
[10:02] me when we first met she was just a
[10:03] center out in the world of course I was
[10:05] too but I was trying to come to church
[10:07] and she'd come Church me just because I
[10:09] was at church
[10:10] now if you come here to see somebody
[10:12] besides God
[10:14] you're in trouble
[10:16] sure we like to commune with each other
[10:18] but if I commune with sister Johnny's
[10:19] that's me and God communicate with him
[10:21] okay same way with any of us here it's
[10:24] God communicating with each other
[10:26] through individuals that's what we're
[10:28] trying to do here we're trying to build
[10:30] a stature not a statue a stature which
[10:33] is a growth development it never says
[10:35] statue what is a statue
[10:39] stand
[10:43] he's dead yeah but a stature is a growth
[10:47] development of Eula I remember when she
[10:50] was born she's a little basement but you
[10:52] know she was cute as a button then she's
[10:54] cuter now
[10:55] and she's growing but she's growing in
[10:57] stature
[10:59] right EULA
[11:00] that turn
[11:02] yeah I don't even pay attention to me
[11:06] okay but now let's talk about patience
[11:09] for a minute we talked about faith we've
[11:12] got to have faith
[11:14] we got to have faith in in God
[11:17] but we've got to see that it's not just
[11:19] having faith in God that God's out there
[11:22] somewhere that God's somewhere over here
[11:24] we've got to have faith in God it is in
[11:26] you that's right all right he's in the
[11:27] preacher that's going to preach today
[11:28] are that he's somewhere that's tangible
[11:32] okay
[11:34] you know Dad said first sermon I heard
[11:36] him preach when I came back on that
[11:37] Wednesday night uh as I was riding up
[11:40] here to church
[11:42] uh the devil of course he's always there
[11:45] he was there saying you're not good
[11:47] enough and I was trying to go well if I
[11:50] quit this and I quit that and I don't do
[11:51] this and I don't do that I'll get
[11:53] Daddy's sermon was you can't get good
[11:56] enough to be saved
[11:58] and you can you can't wash yourself up
[12:01] enough to get saved it's got to be an
[12:04] inward work you cannot no way physically
[12:07] make yourself say but now look if you
[12:09] get the divine nature of the one that
[12:11] wrote the Bible number one you'll start
[12:13] reading the Bible and quit reading all
[12:15] that other junk
[12:16] you'll start seeing what God said to you
[12:19] see as a young Christian we all have to
[12:21] do that we all gotta we all got to um I
[12:25] know as we get older in life we uh
[12:27] sometimes you know Dad can about quote
[12:30] the Bible so he really doesn't have to
[12:32] read every day but I'm I'm sure he it's
[12:35] like he and I are kind of geared the
[12:38] same way I you see people and I'm not
[12:40] putting off on them and the message
[12:42] they've always got their earbuds in and
[12:43] they're listening to a sermon constantly
[12:45] 24 hours a day I just don't do that
[12:48] but I meditate on what I already know
[12:50] what God Said and that's the way daddy
[12:51] is daddy be just working away and he'll
[12:53] just be meditating
[12:54] the tape's running in his head right it
[12:57] ain't running and you know it ain't it
[12:59] ain't physically hooked to him but it's
[13:01] running in his head because he's known
[13:02] it long enough he's been in this message
[13:04] for 50 years 45 years so it kind of
[13:07] turns over and God can put those things
[13:08] together but a lot of us are geared
[13:10] different we have to listen to tape see
[13:12] I can't listen to tape my mind goes and
[13:14] goes wandering I have to read yeah I'm a
[13:17] reader if I read
[13:20] I'd block everything out and I don't I
[13:22] can't I mean the world could fall apart
[13:24] and I if I'm reading a book
[13:27] it doesn't matter what's going on I can
[13:28] focus on that book but now turn on a
[13:30] tape
[13:32] I'll go to sleep or my mind will be over
[13:34] under somewhere but I'm just being
[13:35] honest with you but I'm telling you in
[13:36] your Christian experience you got to
[13:37] figure out what works for you
[13:40] even in all this and I'm not saying just
[13:41] for the young ones I'm saying for all of
[13:43] them like you were talking about
[13:45] patience last Sunday you got to figure
[13:47] out a way
[13:51] to get where you don't
[13:54] have bad thoughts about that guy that
[13:56] pulls out in front of you you know right
[13:58] but I want to read something in just a
[14:00] minute because it's
[14:02] and I'm sorry when I did it this morning
[14:04] I got up at five o'clock couldn't sleep
[14:05] so I did my sermon or I did my notes and
[14:08] I did them in smaller fonts so if some
[14:10] of you in the back is not gonna be able
[14:11] to read
[14:12] the ones that's coming up but um
[14:16] brother Ryan said patient
[14:19] in patience the Bible says possess you
[14:21] your soul but brother around says
[14:22] patience is something you've got to
[14:25] endure
[14:27] so you've got to go through all these
[14:29] troubles you got to go through it we all
[14:31] brojo
[14:33] yeah you were talking about that guy
[14:34] pulling in front of you yeah
[14:36] your inner man wants to do something but
[14:39] there's something an Insight even if you
[14:41] wanted to you can't do it you know what
[14:43] I mean that's correct that's correct you
[14:45] that's right brother Brown said if your
[14:48] gear something like if you're geared to
[14:49] the Holy Ghost see when that starts
[14:52] turning and it used to like my I used to
[14:54] say bad words that Cog in my head now
[14:57] listen let me be real honest with you
[14:59] those bad words hadn't went away that's
[15:02] right
[15:04] I still got them in my head that's right
[15:07] and I'll call myself something every
[15:09] once in a while then I'll have to repent
[15:11] of
[15:14] sorry it's just I can't just say just
[15:17] the human brain that's where brother
[15:18] Brown said but don't sit there and dwell
[15:20] on it
[15:22] yeah say God forgive me because remember
[15:25] if you're a child of God you better
[15:27] watch what that thing inside you is
[15:29] calling you that's right if you're a
[15:31] child of God
[15:33] remember right because you can grieve
[15:35] the Holy Ghost
[15:36] not do away with it not be lost but you
[15:39] can grieve it but you say God you know
[15:42] that what man you know I wouldn't say
[15:43] that
[15:45] I would before but not now but it's just
[15:47] it's why it's in this brain this is
[15:49] where Satan works right here God takes
[15:51] what David said right here not what was
[15:53] up here okay brother I used to think
[15:56] that as long as I didn't involve nobody
[15:58] else in what I was doing right that I
[16:00] was only hurting myself
[16:02] since I've been coming here I've been
[16:03] realizing God's getting in me yeah and
[16:05] now I'm hurting God yeah how can you
[16:08] talk about God
[16:09] hurting there you go that's correct
[16:12] that's correct a woman that loves you
[16:14] and yep you know so that's bottom I
[16:16] can't smoke around people I go to church
[16:17] with yeah the other day I caught myself
[16:19] walk across street marks down that day
[16:21] and I caught myself throwing a whole
[16:22] cigarette on the ground polar Graham a
[16:24] whole cigarette those
[16:44] and boy before me and him met
[16:55] he called me one time
[16:57] you come around the house I was working
[16:59] in the backyard up there in Dixie Drive
[17:01] and I didn't hear him pull up and I was
[17:02] working in the back on the deck he come
[17:04] around there and I turned around looking
[17:05] him
[17:10] look what he did nothing he never
[17:13] never said a word example of God is what
[17:16] we are right and when you're doing all
[17:18] of that stuff
[17:19] you're hurting the temple of God right I
[17:22] mean that's right it's known that all
[17:24] this stuff we do drink smoke dope
[17:27] whatever we do that's hurt in this
[17:29] temple of God so that's why we don't do
[17:31] it because we're supposed to be right by
[17:34] the way not not that it you know and
[17:36] that's what you do is commendable that's
[17:39] what I did I didn't ever smoke around
[17:41] well I didn't smoke but I never tried
[17:43] not to chill except that one time but I
[17:45] didn't drink or anything like that
[17:46] around there that was respect but then I
[17:48] got to realize like you when I got saved
[17:52] I was kidding me more than I was kidding
[17:55] anybody else I was kidding me I wasn't
[17:57] kidding God he's there all the time he
[17:59] knew it from the foundation of the world
[18:01] before I was born what I'd be doing
[18:02] right all right
[18:05] so here we are you know it's it's like
[18:08] Mom said it's the temple you walk around
[18:10] in but that Temple has got to show
[18:13] what's inside that's right right the
[18:16] temple that's just what we're talking
[18:17] about here with patience we need to have
[18:20] more patience we need to have more
[18:22] knowledge we need to have more
[18:23] Temperance not have that brother perhaps
[18:25] an ungodly temper but the first thing he
[18:27] said to do was was to have patience with
[18:30] who
[18:31] God have patience with God
[18:35] let's shift to that let's get to it
[18:37] let's see
[18:44] patients with what what kind of patience
[18:46] first thing is have patience with God
[18:48] now let me paraphrase this if you've got
[18:51] real genuine faith you'll have real
[18:53] genuine impatience because Faith works
[18:55] with patience When God says anything you
[18:56] believe it so when we started our
[18:58] Christian Journey how many of us had ups
[19:01] and downs
[19:02] oh everybody raise their hand grief
[19:05] even Jesus was tempted that's right he
[19:09] had his ups and downs days and he was
[19:11] God Almighty and human flesh
[19:14] remember he did he asked himself what in
[19:17] the world y'all talking about one wants
[19:18] to sit on my right hand one more so you
[19:20] got aggravated with them right because
[19:23] he had a human nature but it was the
[19:25] nature of almighty God and that's what
[19:27] projected out but watch but watch what
[19:30] happens with this nature
[19:33] when you have the divine nature of God
[19:35] religious people don't like you
[19:39] I said religious people I say Christian
[19:41] I said religious people don't like you
[19:44] religious people kill Jesus the
[19:47] the drunks
[19:50] they didn't kill Jesus that's right they
[19:52] loved him because he was Healing The
[19:54] Sick he was testing out Devils he was
[19:56] helping Humanity but who killed him
[19:59] because of who he was the religious
[20:01] people
[20:02] and religious people is somebody that
[20:04] just puts on it's like brother Brown
[20:05] said you take a you take a crow and he
[20:08] starts sticking peacock feathers in his
[20:11] in his body and he might kind of look
[20:13] like a peacock
[20:15] but he's not going to act like one he's
[20:17] gonna act like a crow all right that's
[20:19] why that um if you didn't know this
[20:22] that's why that that Noah sent a dove
[20:25] okay right and a crow that's right
[20:29] you know why the dove couldn't eat the
[20:32] dead bodies that was flowing because
[20:34] there's billions of people died after
[20:35] the flood that's right
[20:36] so he sent them out well the dove comes
[20:38] back that's right the crow stays out
[20:41] there he's just he's just he's probably
[20:43] lit on somebody's body eating them but
[20:46] the dove come back so no one knew that
[20:48] the floods what that the waters hadn't
[20:49] went down far enough but when that Dove
[20:51] came back with a green leaf in his mouth
[20:55] so you remember one thing for sure and
[20:57] you know they even in this new movie
[20:58] Noah they even say it he stayed in that
[21:01] art for a year he didn't stay in there
[21:02] 40 days and 49. it was over a year they
[21:05] stayed in New York right because they
[21:06] had to wait till the 40 days and 40
[21:08] nights and all that to happen then they
[21:10] had to wait for the waters to go down so
[21:12] it took over a year for them to be in
[21:14] there so that dub
[21:16] the reason they were in there that long
[21:18] the high places it took time for that
[21:20] those leaves to grow and for that Dove
[21:23] to go get that leaf and come back when
[21:24] they knew that
[21:26] because remember it was the nature of
[21:28] that Dove not to eat dead stuff that's
[21:30] right so he knew when that Dove came
[21:32] back with that green leaf in his mouth
[21:34] that the water had went down so they
[21:36] opened the door and went out of the arch
[21:37] so that's the same way with you and I
[21:38] you can have a chrome nature
[21:41] that's what we were born with eating
[21:43] anything in the world that's right
[21:45] but when we got that Dove nature it can
[21:47] see all that dead stuff laying there
[21:49] but it's not going to eat it it's going
[21:51] to eat a green leaf because they can't
[21:53] digest it when you get the divine nature
[21:55] of God you can't digest the things of
[21:57] the world anymore and like I said it's a
[21:59] it's a process it's a process
[22:02] hey man I'm telling you I'd rather see
[22:04] somebody struggle I'd rather see
[22:07] somebody fight their way to heaven
[22:09] then to see somebody come in how many
[22:10] times have we seen it people come in and
[22:12] they say oh this is great and this is
[22:14] wonderful three months later you don't
[22:16] see them no more well they ain't getting
[22:17] nothing to start with all right but the
[22:20] wine that's up and down and fighting and
[22:22] struggling and pray for me and pray for
[22:24] me and pray for me
[22:26] they usually last 99 of the time they
[22:29] last because they didn't just come in
[22:31] and
[22:32] see it's real easy to get in the
[22:33] atmosphere that's right it's real easy
[22:36] to get in the atmosphere it's what I
[22:37] always say I always tell people when I
[22:38] preach
[22:39] today we may feel good about what's
[22:42] going on because it's Sunday we're round
[22:44] Believers we're in this we're in this
[22:46] Dome of of Godly love but Monday morning
[22:50] when your feet hit the floor
[22:52] the devil's feet hits there first
[22:55] and he's the first one sitting right
[22:57] here
[22:58] that's when what you get on Sunday it's
[23:02] either going to do you any good or not
[23:03] one of the two
[23:20] the question I have for you is
[23:24] when a man leaves the house he's
[23:26] supposed to leave his wife to the Lord
[23:27] and that the only way he really got any
[23:29] right trying to leave her at all correct
[23:30] I mean she's grown human being right
[23:33] right and that's what I'm trying to do
[23:35] right but in that instance what I'm
[23:37] thinking
[23:38] is I've got to trust the person or
[23:41] persons that's leading this boat to the
[23:44] low in order for me to trust bringing my
[23:48] wife and let her be that with me and we
[23:50] both know the same direction true this
[23:52] is this is that's my question some
[23:55] percent trust in people that's exactly
[23:57] correct well I got that feeling here so
[24:24] told me in testimony about getting a
[24:27] place to live and all that yesterday I
[24:28] drove my marks and he was out there and
[24:30] uh
[24:31] there's one thing about it
[24:34] when you try
[24:36] see like David when you read that I feel
[24:38] David's struggle
[24:40] man he's up and down and you know what
[24:43] ninety percent of the time
[24:45] his fight wasn't
[24:48] from his kingdom his Earthly people sure
[24:51] he had a son that was but his fight
[24:53] those enemies were with inside him
[24:56] that's right his enemies ain't was in
[24:59] here right
[25:00] his enemies was here and he was warring
[25:03] against his own self that's right
[25:06] but see God knew in his heart
[25:10] that he wanted to do right I mean he God
[25:13] knows the heart he you know sometimes we
[25:15] get emotions and we get to feeling good
[25:17] and we get you know but God knows our
[25:19] heart he knows if our if your desire is
[25:22] to have your wife here you know what
[25:24] that Divine promise I told you about in
[25:26] in there in the second Peter it'll
[25:29] happen
[25:40] everybody
[25:47] we had a brother here that couldn't pay
[25:49] his bills remember that brother Harris a
[25:51] long time ago couldn't pass bills he got
[25:52] down on his knees on to Ottoman and he
[25:54] said God I need x amount of money and I
[25:56] only got this much but I need extra
[25:58] money yeah 19 I think he had 19 and he
[26:01] needed
[26:03] but when he got up from praying that
[26:06] stack of money had built up right in
[26:08] front of him yes yes and he had enough
[26:11] to pay now he didn't make him Rich God
[26:12] didn't give him 100 bills this high he
[26:15] had enough to pay his bill amen that's
[26:18] right dollar supply your needs not you
[26:19] want that's right right a lot of us
[26:22] wants and knew this and wants and knew
[26:23] that but God says you need work and get
[26:25] that but I'm going to give you this
[26:28] you need to work if you want a new car
[26:30] but I'm going to give you enough money
[26:32] to sustain yourself right through life
[26:35] pay your bills get your things done and
[26:37] Hank's got a real good testimony and I I
[26:40] appreciate somebody like that I like
[26:42] somebody fresh it's kind of like a yeah
[26:43] kind of like a breath of fresh air
[26:46] you got it wrong
[26:48] right now I'm wrong but the Skin's
[26:51] growing over me let's say I'm quitting
[26:52] easing off the hurting so much
[26:56] you know hey you do the best you can
[26:59] like I said under justification God
[27:02] forgives you but you still the things I
[27:05] did when I was out in the world they
[27:06] still haunt me
[27:31] that's correct
[27:33] see that'll tell you that's a good point
[27:35] that'll tell you whether it's truly God
[27:39] leading you
[27:40] and you're a God child
[27:42] is that you don't go back because
[27:44] remember justification is you're going
[27:46] in this direction
[27:49] all right you're going in this direction
[27:50] we all were born going in this direction
[27:54] we do a 180 not a 360. I've heard some
[27:56] people say we can do it if you do 360
[27:57] you come right back around where you
[27:59] were that's right you do a 180 and you
[28:03] go in the opposite direction hey the
[28:05] best thing I've done when I was growing
[28:07] when I was growing in God
[28:08] I knew the things that I was weak on
[28:11] so I tried my best to stay away from
[28:13] that right I knew that I was weak on
[28:16] certain things and I tried my best to
[28:19] stay away from it just just move away
[28:21] from it I said something maybe go I've
[28:23] not done a lot of a whole lot of bad
[28:25] things and I've always had gone in my
[28:26] mind I wouldn't cross no lines I didn't
[28:28] think I'd get back across my biggest
[28:30] problem with drugs so when I got myself
[28:33] together this year last time I made a
[28:35] point letting everyone up know if you
[28:37] come in my yard I will call the police
[28:39] then we're gonna fight good good
[28:42] I'm told you to drag you out of this
[28:44] yard and I get through you're right I
[28:47] meant that we'll see if they see that
[28:49] sincerity see I had I had um uh forgive
[28:52] us forgetting that we'll go do patients
[28:53] next Sunday but um but see I still had
[28:56] friends that did and Jim knows that I
[28:58] had I had cans of skull in around the
[29:00] house even that Wednesday night after I
[29:02] came home and told her I'd you know give
[29:04] my heart to the Lord and I tell you that
[29:06] what was tough was Hank is
[29:08] she and I went to church here for a long
[29:09] time together then we quit
[29:12] and then she started coming back
[29:14] and I didn't
[29:16] but when the Lord started dealing with
[29:17] me she quit here and started going to
[29:19] baptist church so see I had a quandary
[29:21] there I had I'm like Lord I'm finally
[29:23] coming back and here my wife's gone off
[29:25] again
[29:26] you know not again but she's gone off
[29:28] you know but it took her going to a
[29:30] Baptist Church to realize
[29:33] what that the realness that this is real
[29:35] and that's not I ain't saying nothing
[29:36] against the Baptist Church but that's
[29:38] where I grew up that was familiar that
[29:40] was correct that was her comfort zone
[29:42] They believe in here that was her
[29:44] comfort and I was making
[29:46] trying to you know
[29:50] you know
[29:51] trying to figure out what everybody was
[29:54] doing here and why everybody feels the
[29:55] way they feel and I started asking God
[29:58] to come be with me and help me
[29:59] understand when I lay down at night I
[30:01] closed my eyes off walking together him
[30:03] glowing it may not sure yeah for example
[30:06] right now the reasons in my mind that he
[30:08] would be he would be the almighty he
[30:10] would have a certain Look to Him and I
[30:12] wouldn't do the human being
[30:13] but since I started doing that he's put
[30:16] it in my heart to be here no matter what
[30:18] right and in my life the people around
[30:20] me even my mama looked at me and said
[30:22] the other day something's different
[30:23] about it man I tell you
[30:28] I tell you
[30:30] you know what it does
[30:32] it even it changes your countenance and
[30:34] your countenance is your persona your
[30:36] person it changes that I'm sure we have
[30:39] things and I didn't I haven't used to
[30:42] been quiet now loud I've been loud the
[30:44] whole time
[30:45] but I just used to use my loud mouth to
[30:48] curse people out and make people feel
[30:50] bad but now I try to use it to help
[30:53] people so I use that gift that gift was
[30:56] always in my life I just used it in her
[30:59] own way because it was me using it not
[31:00] him and you're talking about God walking
[31:02] beside you with a light in you in the
[31:04] dark one day that's going to do this
[31:05] yeah that's what I'm looking for and
[31:07] you're not going to see dark anymore
[31:08] you're going to see the light because
[31:10] he's going to be walking with he's going
[31:11] to be in you I think in my mind when I
[31:13] when I do that
[31:34] and a thing about the loud mouth thing
[31:37] you're talking about I blame it on hard
[31:39] here I don't know if I got hard here or
[31:40] not but I sometimes I talk really loud
[31:44] I see y'all and I see what y'all do and
[31:48] I see Mark and Dawn and Susan and Gina
[31:52] and I just there's something dark bigger
[31:54] than me and I want to be part of it now
[31:56] and it's going to take me a while to get
[31:57] there y'all for Jimmy I'm slow always
[32:00] happening oh I should have been on a
[32:02] short bus you know don't worry
[32:06] it was full of us you couldn't get home
[32:09] yeah you know it was full of us
[32:16] they want to see for you we were wrong
[32:18] thank you for letting me talk but hey
[32:21] this is open this is Open Bible school
[32:23] down there everybody just like this I've
[32:25] been coming here ever since I don't
[32:26] blame me something let me get it this
[32:28] morning and say come on we got to go
[32:29] well good so I got here in time well
[32:32] that's what we're going to try to we try
[32:33] to do down here what I what I tell them
[32:35] is we try to give you the gravy down
[32:36] here and you get to meet upstairs yeah
[32:38] so if you put the two together or
[32:40] something most of the time how many
[32:41] times people if we went upstairs and
[32:43] daddy covered the same scripture the
[32:46] same topic we're talking about and he'll
[32:49] hit it and just fill in the gaps and so
[32:51] that's you know what that's gone because
[32:53] he and I don't don't talk about it I
[32:56] don't try to influence what he's
[32:57] preaching and he'll try to influence
[32:58] what I'm doing down here we listen to
[33:00] each other and we we feed off each other
[33:02] but I I think you Claude calls it
[33:04] stealing your fire which I don't know if
[33:06] it's too much stealing your fire or not
[33:08] but still if you got a thought you know
[33:10] you can I can I can pull him off to my
[33:12] phone I don't want to do that I want God
[33:14] to have his way God to have his thought
[33:17] with him and then God would have his
[33:18] thought with me so but my friends
[33:21] when I started serving the lord I was
[33:24] tested many times now my friends I
[33:26] wasn't in a circle of drugs but that
[33:28] doesn't matter there's no big sin or
[33:30] little sin it's all seen so the friends
[33:33] that I'm with they would tempt me and
[33:35] they said well we're gonna go hunting on
[33:36] Sunday because I was a big hunter we
[33:37] hunt it all the time it's we're gonna go
[33:38] hunting on Sunday you won't go with us
[33:40] no I'm going to church okay or we're
[33:43] gonna go hunting Saturday but we're
[33:44] gonna stay over the Sunday you want to
[33:45] ride with us we'll see if I rode with
[33:47] them I'd have been stuck there Sunday I
[33:49] said no I'll drive see I didn't do away
[33:51] with my friend I just they just made
[33:53] sure that they knew I made sure that
[33:55] they knew that Sunday was church service
[33:59] June's father
[34:00] he comes over we don't see him but maybe
[34:02] two or three times a year but you know
[34:04] what if he comes over on Sunday he knows
[34:06] one thing's for sure we're either not
[34:07] going to be there or he's going to come
[34:09] with us one of the two I'm not going to
[34:10] stay home for any of my kids that's
[34:12] putting them before God
[34:14] now you shouldn't do that
[34:16] you should put God first and if your
[34:17] kids want to stay home hey I got one at
[34:19] home right now the kids want to stay
[34:21] home they don't stay home I'm coming
[34:23] here because this is more important than
[34:25] anything in the world
[34:27] but my friends
[34:29] pay a little testimony about change

[34:36] involved in getting the 10-year class
[34:38] reunion

[34:58] and in 1998 that summer we had our
[35:01] 20-year class reunion well they did I

[35:13] bar but I told him I said I got saved
[35:15] and of course they would say okay good
[35:17] you know praise the Lord yeah
[35:19] but when I went to that class reunion
[35:24] they voted me the most changed person
[35:28] from the 10 years to the 20 year

[35:44] of the only people who's got a platform
