[0:22] all right we will continue speaking
[0:24] about this kingdom of God and last time
[0:28] when we left off we talked about we were
[0:34] discussing how the kingdom is not it's
[0:39] not an external Kingdom and we gave some
[0:41] examples as to how the Jews were looking
[0:45] for a kingdom when Messiah would come
[0:47] was looking for an external Kingdom that
[0:49] to be built here on earth and that
[0:52] wasn't the that wasn't what was in God's
[0:56] image that wasn't his interest obviously
[1:00] it's like us you know I see it this way
[1:02] as God's building his kingdom
[1:05] you know he's building a kingdom within
[1:07] us right right we'll get to that later
[1:13] but character what does that day that
[1:20] power that character therefore Christ is
[1:26] gonna have a physical Kingdom you know
[1:28] later but it's got to be built
[1:31] spiritually first the character has to
[1:33] be there first because it's gonna be
[1:36] filled by his people by his children
[1:38] right it's gonna be it's gonna be his
[1:40] children they're gonna possess it right
[1:42] right but you have to have that
[1:44] character that Kingdom already
[1:45] completely built in you before you can
[1:48] compose
[1:49] that's the physical key thing so that's
[1:53] kind of where I want to go with it but
[1:55] let's just look at this but uh let's
[1:59] look at this here uh interesting
[2:02] scripture in John chapter 18 this is
[2:05] when Pilate was talking to the to Jesus
[2:07] and let's just read verse 33 says then
[2:11] Pilate entered into the judgment Hall
[2:12] again and called Jesus and said unto Him
[2:15] art thou the King of the Jews
[2:18] so he wanted to know if he was the King
[2:20] of the Jews
[2:22] or maybe he wanted to see what he would
[2:24] say
[2:25] jesus said answer to him say stuff
[2:27] because whenever you ask Jesus a
[2:30] question he's going to answer your
[2:31] question right he'll give you the answer
[2:33] did you just ask that's the reason why
[2:34] you said Axman you shall receive seek
[2:36] and you shall find him and he even gave
[2:39] an answer to to to to Pilate right he
[2:42] answered him saying Satan's sayst thou
[2:46] this thing of thyself or did others tell
[2:49] it thee of me in other words are you
[2:52] saying this because it's revealed to you
[2:54] that I'm or are you saying that because
[2:56] somebody else has said it to you
[2:58] Rome has told you that I'm the king of
[3:00] the Jews right so Pilate answered and
[3:03] said mi jus thine own nation and the
[3:06] chief priests have delivered thee unto
[3:09] me what has thou done so your own nation
[3:12] in my duty to answer that question I'm
[3:14] not concerned about these things your
[3:17] own nation your own people have
[3:18] delivered me that you to me Jesus verse
[3:23] 36 jesus answered my kingdom is not of
[3:27] this world so he plainly says it right
[3:30] there if my kingdom were of this world
[3:32] then would my servants fight that I
[3:37] should not be delivered to the Jews this
[3:40] way if it was a if it was of if his
[3:43] kingdom was was when he would come when
[3:45] he was here on earth being come to
[3:46] establish a physical Kingdom obviously
[3:49] he'd have servants he'd have people just
[3:51] like a nation has an army has sergeants
[3:56] has
[3:56] man there hasn't you know people's
[3:58] support right but he didn't have that
[4:01] now we know that there was cuz I mean
[4:05] that he could call legion of angels to
[4:07] stop the whole thing and they were not
[4:08] stopped he never owned a truck but then
[4:10] where would we have been you see the
[4:12] plan of redemption wouldn't have
[4:13] continued right in scripture would not
[4:16] have been fulfilled and to Jesus in the
[4:21] physical right because we know he was
[4:23] just as much human as he was God when he
[4:26] was here on earth but his whole main
[4:28] point was to fulfill that Scripture the
[4:32] scripture had already spoken about him
[4:33] to do certain things and because he was
[4:37] the word he had to fulfill the word so
[4:42] then with my servants fight that I
[4:46] should not be delivered to the Jews but
[4:48] now is my kingdom not from hence my
[4:52] kingdom is not from this worldly man
[4:54] Pilate therefore said unto Him art thou
[4:58] a king then no are you of him so he's
[5:04] asking them pretty much kind of the same
[5:05] question they just invented a good first
[5:07] verse 33 jesus answered thou say us that
[5:12] I am a king to this end was I born see
[5:17] saying yes I am a king and for
[5:20] this cause came I into the world that I
[5:24] should bear witness unto the truth every
[5:29] one that is of the truth for this
[5:31] kingdom hear my voice
[5:36] so Jesus here is speaking heat now he's
[5:39] turning it back to a spiritual Kingdom
[5:41] right
[5:42] he's turning them back to a kingdom the
[5:44] real reason why he came here to earth
[5:47] right to bear witness of the truth and
[5:51] we know that he is the truth and we know
[5:53] that because he there's different
[5:56] scriptures that I am the way the truth
[5:57] and the life
[5:58] right that word is truth and another
[6:02] scripture says you know man so we know
[6:05] that he is the truth but everyone that
[6:08] hears my voice jesus said it's of that
[6:11] truth or in other words it's of that
[6:13] Kingdom that's the kingdom that he's
[6:16] come here to establish right Pilate said
[6:19] unto him what is true and then look like
[6:23] what happened and when he had said this
[6:25] he went out again unto the Jews now even
[6:28] when we think we continue reading we we
[6:32] don't see that jesus answered this
[6:33] question there because why Pilate
[6:36] immediately just kind of walks out he
[6:38] asks him what what is right him being a
[6:41] philosopher that he is or whatever you
[6:43] know what is true there is no you know
[6:46] kind of nonchalant what is truth and he
[6:49] walks out and Jesus then you know they
[6:52] give otherwise Jesus would have told him
[6:54] mm-hmm
[6:55] right weird of answered his question but
[6:57] he had already told him who he was at
[6:58] the bed and the first few verses so this
[7:02] is the kingdom that uh that Jesus come
[7:05] to establish all right and Romans uh
[7:10] let's read Romans chapter 14
[7:14] you have your scriptures I don't have it
[7:16] up here
[7:28] now you know as when we first come into
[7:34] the messes and I told you guys that I
[7:36] was gonna get a little little I got a
[7:40] little carnal with this if you could say
[7:42] it that way
[7:44] but you know thanks to a lot of people
[7:47] the kingdom of God is hair dress and
[7:51] doing external things and I'm gonna read
[7:56] you a quote I've read you several quotes
[7:59] but I'll read you hear what Paul says
[8:01] because a lot of people are fixed that
[8:02] you know a sister comes into the message
[8:05] and they let their hair grow out and
[8:08] they think some of them get get get to
[8:11] you know I get to the points that well
[8:13] my hair is longer than yours that I must
[8:15] be holier than you and that's not the
[8:19] case yes because because I mean there's
[8:27] I'm sure there's cases where the sister
[8:30] will look down on another sister because
[8:31] their hair is not all the way down to
[8:33] the floor right no sister can't help
[8:37] that but right that's all right sister
[8:39] can't help that in you have an extremely
[8:42] long hair doesn't make you holier than
[8:44] somebody else
[8:46] because I heard you've always heard the
[8:48] phrase you know you're gonna have long
[8:50] hair but have long tongue yeah I'm
[8:52] talking about everybody at church but
[8:54] your hair is long and you dress right
[8:55] yeah and you're hurting the body of
[8:58] Christ right here Tom Evans my friend
[9:01] so you know some people would think well
[9:04] the unites the kingdom of God it's all
[9:06] these external things but we'll read
[9:09] Romans let's just read Romans 14:17
[9:11] that's where the kingdom of God is not
[9:13] meat and drink
[9:14] in other words physical things but
[9:18] righteousness and peace and joy in in
[9:21] the Holy Ghost any man now when you have
[9:25] the Holy Spirit
[9:27] that's what's gonna produce this penis
[9:28] righteousness peace and joy it's not
[9:30] your own righteousness okay
[9:32] it's his righteous right amen and it's
[9:35] so easy for us to when we come become
[9:38] Christians or we come into the message
[9:40] for us to be so legalistic right right
[9:42] that we you know I can't do this I can't
[9:47] wear some man they think they can't wear
[9:49] long sleeve shirts you know but that's
[9:51] up to you if you don't want to wear the
[9:53] Lugg I mean if you don't want to wear
[9:54] short sleeve shirts right
[9:56] that's up to you you know we're not
[9:57] condemning you you're not going to be
[9:59] condemned but I want to see what I want
[10:01] let's see what Paul says let me just see
[10:05] what Paul says cuz I mean I saw it when
[10:08] I first come into the message I saw a
[10:10] lot of that oh yeah and and then you cut
[10:13] your that way as well but as you start
[10:15] growing in the Lord you you start
[10:18] balancing things in your life then you
[10:21] start seeing that the kingdom of God is
[10:22] not meat and drink
[10:24] amen so let's treat this this chapter of
[10:27] Romans chapter 14 it says I'm in
[10:33] Jeremiah and you know we just want to
[10:37] take our time scientists still have two
[10:40] more Sundays obviously you know Paul
[10:48] speaking here about this kingdom of what
[10:52] is not alright verse 1 it says him that
[10:56] is weak in the faith receive ye but not
[11:00] to doubtful disputations in other words
[11:03] there's going to be people Christians
[11:06] that are going to first come and get
[11:08] saved or people that come to the church
[11:10] and start getting safe they're not going
[11:12] to know everything
[11:14] they're not gonna know you know that's
[11:17] the reason we have to be patient receive
[11:19] you in the faith right right received
[11:23] them in the faith verse 2 for one
[11:25] believes that he may eat all things
[11:27] another who is weak eateth herbs in
[11:31] other words one of them believes but
[11:33] there's a Christian that believes I can
[11:35] eat everything including pork including
[11:38] all these things but your brother weight
[11:41] obviously blazing right but then there's
[11:43] another one that says well I just eat
[11:45] out to eat vegetables but I chose a weak
[11:47] those about to eat another who is weak
[11:55] urghhh some vegetarians touring the
[11:57] spiritually weak so there's another one
[12:06] that that things well I should and now
[12:08] this is speaking about the Romans
[12:09] because right there was a lot of issues
[12:12] about Christians eating meat and
[12:14] sacrificed to idols during that time
[12:16] should we or should we not uh should we
[12:18] hug that there was questions in people's
[12:20] minds that Paul has to deal with but now
[12:23] if you take those things and bring them
[12:24] to our day we don't have to worry about
[12:26] you know I meat being sacrificed to
[12:29] idols that it could be I don't know what
[12:31] they do at Publix I don't know what they
[12:33] do but I just take it in prayer and
[12:38] continue on sometimes we can get so
[12:41] caught up with these little things you
[12:43] know these little external things and
[12:46] you forget of the big picture of the
[12:48] kingdom of God you see so so verse 3 let
[12:53] not him that eateth despise him that
[12:56] eateth not right in other words don't
[12:59] don't don't look down on the one that
[13:02] that puts up the Christmas tree and you
[13:06] don't put the Christmas tree up or vice
[13:09] versa
[13:10] right I'm gonna need the Christmas tree
[13:14] because that's a big thing yeah there's
[13:16] people they don't want to put Christmas
[13:18] trees they don't have the faith to put a
[13:20] Christmas tree but don't look down on
[13:21] them and I and you're not gonna you
[13:24] shouldn't look at one that does put them
[13:26] down on the one that does put the
[13:27] Christmas tree up because they're doing
[13:30] that's that's they have full faith to do
[13:32] it right so let's just leave it up in
[13:41] the rest in here
[13:51] but it did have a little bit like you
[13:54] know sort of a little bit type of snowy
[13:55] to look nice white BER story
[14:02] first three are items let not him that
[14:05] eateth despise him that eateth not and
[14:07] let not him which eateth not judge him
[14:09] that eateth for God have received him
[14:11] right who art thou that judgest another
[14:16] man's servant to his own master he
[14:19] standeth or falleth yea ye shall behold
[14:22] enough for God is able to make him stand
[14:24] one man esteemeth one day above another
[14:27] much let's just look at Christmas
[14:29] another example one man in other words
[14:33] looks at Christmas I love Christmas
[14:34] right another steamin every day alike
[14:37] another one says every day to me is a
[14:39] life you know
[14:40] I don't look at Christmas better than
[14:42] another day right let every man be fully
[14:44] persuaded in his own mind right in his
[14:50] own mind he that regardeth the day in
[14:54] other words looks at the day and keeps
[14:56] it regardeth it unto the Lord right all
[15:00] right don't you do it for the Lord sink
[15:04] right no you don't you don't celebrate
[15:06] Christmas or you don't do things around
[15:07] Christmas because you're doing it for
[15:09] the world
[15:09] pull out your bottles of champagne and
[15:12] dress up as Santa Claus and you know and
[15:14] all that all that stuff you know you do
[15:17] it unto the Lord for the Lord he does
[15:19] not regarded it regarded he that eateth
[15:22] eateth to the Lord for he giveth God
[15:25] thanks and he that eateth not to the
[15:28] Lord he eateth not so to the one that
[15:31] does it and the one that doesn't do it
[15:33] they're both doing for the Lord right
[15:36] and give it God things for none of us
[15:39] liveth to himself and no man
[15:41] amen for whether we live we live unto
[15:44] the Lord and whether we die we die unto
[15:46] the Lord whether we live therefore or
[15:49] die we are the Lord's centra either way
[15:52] we are the Lord's because you know see
[15:55] God knows the reason and it knows your
[15:57] heart your reason why you do things or
[16:00] why you don't mean things and if you
[16:02] don't have the faith enough to not do
[16:04] certain maintenance don't do it because
[16:05] another brother or sister does it right
[16:09] you know and then we have to be careful
[16:11] as Christians to not boast because we
[16:14] have the faith enough to do it and
[16:16] another Christian doesn't you know it
[16:18] doesn't want to do it a lot of people
[16:20] you know when I came into the message
[16:22] and that's how that's how you know I got
[16:25] around people that you know you know I
[16:28] didn't want to do certain things or that
[16:32] they would do they were too written
[16:35] necessarily bad but I just didn't feel
[16:36] comfortable but they would just kind of
[16:39] do it in front of me you know and then
[16:41] it really like well okay and this person
[16:44] was an older person than me well that
[16:48] kind of you know that just kind of the
[16:50] ability you know put me put me down
[16:52] you see so you just have to be you have
[16:56] to walk you have to walk be careful
[16:59] around around people am I going to do
[17:04] something around my brother that I have
[17:07] full faith in doing but I know that it's
[17:09] gonna offend my brother would would I
[17:13] would would I would I would I put a
[17:17] stumbling block and my brothers walk it
[17:19] with Christ just so that I can get the
[17:21] pleasure in that I have full faith in
[17:23] doing whatever I'm doing around them you
[17:25] see my you all see what I'm trying to
[17:28] say this is what Paul is talking about
[17:30] [Music]
[17:33] first night first night foot to this end
[17:37] Christ both died and rose and revived
[17:40] for that he might be Lord both of the
[17:43] Dead and living in control but why does
[17:46] thou judge thy brother or why does thou
[17:50] setting off thy brother for we shall all
[17:52] stand before the judgment seat of Christ
[17:57] for it is written as I live saith the
[18:00] LORD every knee shall bow to me and
[18:01] every tongue shall confess to God
[18:03] verse 12 so then every one of us shall
[18:06] give account of himself to God verse 13
[18:10] let us not therefore judge one another
[18:11] anymore but Judge this rather that no
[18:15] man put a stumbling-block or an occasion
[18:18] to fall in his brothers way that's
[18:22] pretty clear yeah I know you and listen
[18:28] to what Paul says here I know and am
[18:32] persuaded by the Lord Jesus by the Lord
[18:35] Jesus that there is nothing unclean of
[18:39] itself so there's nothing unclean
[18:43] there's nothing bad of itself let's take
[18:48] the TV for example it's not bad within
[18:51] itself I can have it in my home
[18:54] but it's what how I use it right that
[18:56] makes it that makes it bad
[19:00] we all have internet on our cell phones
[19:02] it's just as bad as a deviant worse than
[19:05] the TV you know we brought about the TV
[19:08] and shooting the TV out of the house we
[19:10] should be shooting our phones and our
[19:12] computers out of there that's worse
[19:17] [Music]
[19:20] that's worse
[19:22] we've been more damaged through internet
[19:23] than theirs but it's the way you use it
[19:28] it's the way I use the Internet that's
[19:31] gonna that's you know that's gonna bring
[19:33] glory to God or not right so there it's
[19:38] nothing but it's not bad within itself
[19:40] but Graham said TV could been used for a
[19:42] good purpose and it has been used for
[19:45] good you know preaching the gospel and
[19:47] things like that but we know that that
[19:49] these things have also it's it comes
[19:52] from the from the knowledge of tree and
[19:54] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[19:59] let us not therefore throw to see verse
[20:01] 14 know and portrayed by Lord Jesus that
[20:04] there is nothing unclean or except but
[20:05] to him that esteemeth anything to be
[20:07] unclean to him it is unclean so if you
[20:12] think celebrating Christmas is is bad
[20:15] then it to you it's bad all right I'm
[20:19] just giving Christmas as an example
[20:24] but don't you don't have to proclaim it
[20:26] to everybody else and get her convert
[20:28] everybody else to go your way and vice
[20:31] versa you that celebrate Christmas you
[20:33] don't make converting everybody out
[20:35] there you need to put at the Christmas
[20:36] tree you know that and all this stuff
[20:38] right right now let verse verse 15 but
[20:46] if thy brother be grieved with thy meat
[20:49] in other words if that brother be
[20:51] grieved with you celebrating Christmas
[20:52] now walkest thou not charitably destroy
[20:57] not him with thy meat for whom Christ
[20:59] died in other words don't don't destroy
[21:02] him with your with your doctor with your
[21:07] own thing your own idea about things you
[21:09] see let let not then your good be evil
[21:14] spoken of verse 17 for the kingdom of
[21:19] God is not meat and drink but
[21:22] righteousness and peace and joy in the
[21:24] Holy Ghost for he that in these things
[21:28] serveth Christ is acceptable to God and
[21:30] approved of man verse 19 let us
[21:32] therefore follow after the things which
[21:34] make for peace and things were with one
[21:38] may edify right for me destroy not the
[21:44] work of God so in other words because of
[21:48] you know like let's not destroy what God
[21:52] is doing and let's not get sidetracked
[21:53] by all these things just because you
[21:55] want to be heavy about oh that you
[21:57] celebrate Christmas right
[22:02] all things indeed are pure but it is
[22:06] evil for that man who eateth with
[22:08] offence so that person that eats and
[22:10] doesn't have full faith to him it's evil
[22:13] right it is good neither to eat flesh
[22:17] nor to drink wine nor anything whereby
[22:19] thy brother stumbleth or is offended for
[22:23] his mate week past I'll fake it have it
[22:26] to thyself before God if you have faith
[22:30] for these things you know then you have
[22:32] it to yourself right we're all growing
[22:34] in different levels all right and we
[22:37] just be patient with one another and if
[22:40] you feel like a sister or a brother or
[22:42] well they're not to up to par to where I
[22:44] am let the Lord do the work right you
[22:47] don't need their Holy Ghost you can't be
[22:49] their Holy Ghost you know because it's
[22:53] the Lord that does the work for one here
[22:54] I always say if if the Lord does the
[22:57] work if we let the Lord through the work
[22:59] it's gonna be done right right well when
[23:01] we convince somebody else that's the
[23:03] reason why arguing doesn't does it bring
[23:05] it to anything foolish disputations and
[23:09] stuff like that you're not gonna
[23:10] convince somebody with argument yeah
[23:12] fussing never it's better you know when
[23:15] your father window when you see the fuss
[23:17] about to start you just stay quiet let
[23:20] things simmer down let things calm down
[23:23] 3 2 1
[23:25] 1 2 3 what the heck is it bothering me
[23:31] you say that she hasn't heard you say
[23:35] that sounds much better
[23:51] it is good neither to verse 21 it is
[23:53] good neither to eat flesh nor to drink
[23:54] one or anything where how thy brother
[23:56] stumbleth or is offended who is made
[23:58] weak has thou faith have it to thyself
[24:00] before God happy is he that condemned
[24:02] that condemneth not himself in that
[24:04] thing which he allowed verse 23 and he
[24:07] that doubted his damned if he eat
[24:08] because he eateth not of faith for
[24:11] whatsoever is not of faith is sin but
[24:13] whatsoever is not a faithless man right
[24:16] you know if if to me now this is me if I
[24:24] was if I was in a third world country
[24:25] and I was I was sitting down to eat food
[24:29] and I knew that that food was sacrificed
[24:32] unto idols I'd still eat it because I
[24:37] have faith I know where I'm standing
[24:39] that it was and plus the thing is is
[24:44] that I want to be able to come at you
[24:46] know take because sometimes if you don't
[24:48] partake in what in it's something that
[24:51] now if it's something you know taking
[24:53] off your clothes and stuff like that you
[24:54] know that's a bit of different thing but
[24:56] this is me now I would eat for the sake
[24:59] of trying to convert these people right
[25:01] that's just me but now you may not do it
[25:05] because your conscience may not allow
[25:07] them you don't have to faith enough to
[25:09] do it
[25:09] and I'm not saying that bus and leave
[25:11] but that's just me sure that's just what
[25:13] I was because nothing within itself as
[25:15] bad as an all set right it's what Paul
[25:17] said and he said I'm convinced so you
[25:20] see so and he that doubted this damned
[25:23] if he because he eateth not a faith for
[25:25] whatsoever is not of faith is sin and
[25:27] verse 15 last verse chapter 15 verse 1
[25:30] we then that are strong ought to bear
[25:33] the infirmities
[25:34] of the weak and not to please ourselves
[25:38] amen does anybody have any questions or
[25:42] any any comments about that for the joke
[25:49] blood blood I mean to me
[25:55] at one point at one point I thought it
[25:58] was it was bad eating blood now live
[26:01] drinking lots of fresh warm blood you
[26:06] know I just want to do it because I
[26:07] don't want that iron taste in my mouth
[26:09] and I just thought that's not what I eat
[26:11] but I mean I'm eating chicken and all
[26:13] the time we get we go into the in your
[26:16] Nui blood is your blood in there BAM
[26:18] based around these guy blood and I mean
[26:20] so I guess we're all condemned because
[26:22] we drink you me blood you're not hurt
[26:25] stay really within it so if you give a
[26:28] Paul said in another place you know as
[26:32] it Paul or Peter he said everything is
[26:37] good that God created if you give thanks
[26:39] you know when you give thanks but if you
[26:42] don't have the faith to do it then you
[26:44] don't do it that doesn't make you better
[26:46] in the kingdom of God than me you see a
[26:50] lot of that over Rachel they we're
[26:51] talking about an Testament kind of
[26:53] research that a little bit back
[26:55] especially during this time they would
[26:58] take an animal and bleed it out while it
[27:00] was alive and take the blood and
[27:02] actually come right out of the vein of
[27:04] the neck and just get gallons of it and
[27:08] then they were taking drink it but that
[27:09] was a ritual knotted to die they're done
[27:12] until their guy that's a very good yeah
[27:14] it was it was a ritual to their gun and
[27:16] Paul probably saw this and he said okay
[27:20] yeah you know don't don't drink blood of
[27:22] alive like oh that animal was life yeah
[27:24] he was standing and living and they
[27:27] punched his neck and the blood come out
[27:28] like water you know they were
[27:30] drinking it let animal was still alive
[27:32] but they were going to sacrifice that
[27:34] animal to them whatever God they had
[27:36] right that would be long I know other
[27:44] tribes in Africa in the desert where
[27:47] they don't have water source of water
[28:19] really change the mindset and I would
[28:21] have faith that God will do something to
[28:23] help me to bring me water or print
[28:27] something assignment you're not great
[28:29] wine I'm great
[29:00] yeah I mean we have we have a dish we
[29:03] have a dish and that big sister Trudy
[29:05] she knows what I'm talking about it's
[29:06] called blood sausage yeah and what it is
[29:09] it's they look good they take it well to
[29:13] us it's like a gut it's like chitlins
[29:15] they take they take the gut you know and
[29:17] clean it out they they stuff that gut
[29:21] with it usually pig with rice some meat
[29:24] or something like that and and and then
[29:27] it's sort of it's cooked in in blood as
[29:30] well it's be cooked in blood it's really
[29:33] good now there's a lot of Christians
[29:35] they don't eat that when they come to
[29:37] Christ they said no that's blood and I
[29:39] don't want to eat it for me I have no
[29:42] problem with it's good but I mean but
[29:50] again listen if I'm around Christians
[29:52] that don't want to eat that because of
[29:54] their faith I won't eat it because I
[29:56] don't want to be a stumbling block right
[29:58] there right I'm trying to help these
[29:59] people out spiritually I won't eat it
[30:01] I'll sacrifice my my pleasure of
[30:05] enjoying that for their sake and that's
[30:07] what Paul was discussing here yeah right
[30:10] amen so does anybody have any other
[30:13] comments or anything we have ten more
[30:15] minutes
[30:16] amen okay we don't have to like Ethan if
[30:20] you go out and leave it to people you
[30:21] know first
[30:23] you know if you come to our church you
[30:25] need to wear you've had people come in
[30:30] wear pants and people condemned it now
[30:33] we don't let it go long she's not gonna
[30:35] be here six months until we're there now
[30:37] yes sir okay but one or two three times
[30:39] you they'll either get the revelation or
[30:42] they leave and most of them leave and
[30:43] want to stay will come you know they get
[30:45] they become do Chrismukkah they see the
[30:48] the testimony your testimonial positions
[30:50] you know so and I was lucky I watched
[30:55] that in a lot more you did because back
[30:56] when I was 12 13 14 I mean you heard
[30:59] sermons for hours of dress and hair and
[31:02] clothes no jewelry and jewelry and
[31:04] long-sleeve short-sleeve women not to
[31:07] wear this not what I thought you heard
[31:09] yeah and it really didn't notify nobody
[31:12] know it because it's that's not what
[31:18] it's all about you do these things
[31:19] because you want to please the Lord
[31:21] right and it's born in you you want to
[31:23] do it right I when I used to do it when
[31:29] I was a Christian in the denomination of
[31:31] it uh you know I would wear shorts you
[31:34] know when I became when I came into the
[31:36] message you know I'm gonna hurt your
[31:39] brother brown I'm talking about these
[31:40] man wearing shorts and how 65 they look
[31:42] and all that stuff and then just one day
[31:45] I was running in the car with my dad to
[31:47] the bank and all of a sudden I was like
[31:50] I don't want to wear these things and
[31:53] you know not you know to go out you know
[31:56] I don't want to wear these things
[31:57] anymore and my dad my mom had told me to
[32:01] stop wearing my
[32:03] it's a different thing than you don't
[32:05] want to do something vigor within
[32:08] yourself and somebody else telling you
[32:10] and that one has to be Russian they did
[32:13] it's to be registered in all them years
[32:16] teaching what brother Dale's teaching us
[32:18] and there's now about salvation and
[32:20] judge navigation the same kitchen
[32:22] getting all the clicks pen would have
[32:23] preached that forty years ago at the
[32:25] Church of being a lot better so yeah
[32:27] absolutely because you can get a hold of
[32:28] go still woman to work their pants I
[32:30] mean brother Brown said that so if you
[32:31] wear pants you ain't got although going
[32:33] to me that just black and a lot if you
[32:35] cut your hair programs it's an
[32:37] abomination
[32:38] what brother Brendan say if the Bible
[32:39] says I keep playing but the Bible says
[32:41] these things right right so then so if
[32:43] you still do and you know they just
[32:46] pretty that's pretty cut-and-dried right
[32:48] and man the same way stuff that we
[32:49] didn't know you know shorts doesn't ask
[32:53] cannot do that and like you say that mom
[32:56] and dad was to lean back though if
[33:00] you're not a born-again Christian you
[33:02] gonna wear them just out spying a
[33:03] promise yeah that's fine but that's the
[33:06] reason why I you look at the youth well
[33:09] they won't do it around you when they're
[33:10] still living with you at some point in
[33:12] time that desire hasn't changed in them
[33:15] they're gonna do it oh yeah because they
[33:18] were just suppressed for a while but at
[33:20] the new birth doesn't come in there to
[33:22] change that that's right they're gonna
[33:24] go out and do it anyways that's right so
[33:26] it's very doctoring that determines a
[33:29] man's shirt sleeve length others there's
[33:32] no searches there searches in Latin
[33:34] America that they do that they used to
[33:36] be a lot of America
[33:38] I remember brother picture I'm sure
[33:44] there is brother Harold Hildebrandt with
[33:48] preaching one time over an Alabama
[33:50] brother he took your shirt no he took
[33:56] his coat off and it was short slave and
[33:59] I mean you know and he stopped in the
[34:03] middle of service he said folks if it
[34:05] offends you I put my shirt back on he
[34:06] sitteth ain't no word the Bible tells me
[34:08] I gotta wear a long plate chart right so
[34:11] he said I'm gonna cut back on which
[34:14] would be fine but he just kept on
[34:16] preaching got a real good job I remember
[34:17] that sermon probably because he stopped
[34:20] and say it and he had a short sleeve you
[34:22] know know that go from Penhall yeah the
[34:26] come from penico brother brother from
[34:31] South Carolina and he would tell me
[34:33] because he came out of what's called
[34:35] progressive Pentecost and the man
[34:38] couldn't wear they had to wear like
[34:40] their suits they always had to wear
[34:42] white long-sleeved shirts yeah they
[34:44] could never wear colored shirt like this
[34:46] they could never but that was Pentecost
[34:49] but then when he came into the message
[34:51] that idea was still in there but it just
[34:53] took a little while you know do them to
[34:55] kind of wait a second this is this is
[34:57] this is just external stuff you know
[34:59] right I've been to churches where the
[35:02] women can't wear flip-flops or sandals
[35:03] yeah okay one minute oh no showing of
[35:06] the toes no that still happens yes still
[35:09] going and you know you know just all
[35:14] kinds of stuff but you know what
[35:16] well then there are one church did he
[35:19] the pastor wants all his blades to wear
[35:22] their help am never a nun not always
[35:24] down who you see the whole church and
[35:26] all they do well they got nothing to do
[35:27] with nothing no
[35:30] but it's just one after all but that's
[35:33] you know if you put down and you spare
[35:35] that on the people to me that's a waste
[35:38] of time yeah the waste of time to do
[35:41] that because your seconds for beating
[35:43] the women about their life problem well
[35:47] what do you say that human Shh
[35:50] I'm trying to be I'm trying to be like
[35:52] the Bible today that's trying to be nice
[35:54] but yes they have these doctors that
[35:57] fill up along their time but yeah
[36:00] multi-ball the profession not putting
[36:04] away of all that but if we got riding
[36:07] the clothes and the dress and the hair I
[36:08] mean let's move on to them because
[36:11] that's the key guy right and look
[36:15] including what brother Brown said thank
[36:16] God when the cop is dick told us you
[36:19] know you if we were to go to the church
[36:21] say we went to Gina Williams Church
[36:24] we're sitting there and this lady walks
[36:26] in with hair short is mine and sits down
[36:28] and she's worshiping God and I never
[36:31] think you don't know if that girl
[36:32] brother Ron said if that woman gets born
[36:34] again her hair just as long as that
[36:35] woman said number five over that's never
[36:37] got now we got externally we condemn her
[36:42] and I've seen many churches we were in
[36:45] fellowship meeting on time lady walks in
[36:47] she sits in front of us her hair was cut
[36:48] like this not all that preacher don't
[36:50] preach them that one the whole service
[36:53] just on that poor woman and you know
[36:56] what if she was a born-again woman in
[36:58] her doctor come to our church she got
[37:00] morning in really repented of God with
[37:02] aunty
[37:03] she's got her hair girl okay so you know
[37:07] but but like you said though we got to
[37:09] watch the whole life but watch the whole
[37:12] thing
[37:13] consider the end of the conversation
[37:15] Jesus Christ the same you to consider
[37:17] the end of that woman hurt she can't
[37:19] help she cut her hair but got morning in
[37:20] three months ago and her hair still
[37:22] looks short but she's just as born-again
[37:25] as you are in might be more born
[37:27] some of them sitting there with a handle
[37:28] that's attracting the green well so I
[37:31] mean the hair is just a similar
[37:33] representation exactly to them it
[37:35] doesn't save you know it doesn't place a
[37:37] Calise right right it's just a symbol
[37:40] right well you don't get saved at a
[37:42] simple
[37:43] no no search here so all the women you
[37:50] know had their hair down but they had it
[37:53] down on top of damn and I could not
[37:56] enjoy the message because these women
[37:59] sitting in front of me and I guess
[38:01] secondly that when birth control because
[38:03] everyone unpacked
[38:05] one two three four five you know those
[38:11] women was trying to you know take care
[38:14] of their babies and all this hair was in
[38:16] the baby and she was doing this number
[38:19] all the time never heard I'm sure what
[38:22] was going on in the bullpen because I
[38:25] mean it was just a distraction
[38:27] distraction to her and me she couldn't
[38:30] get that baby sail down on her shoulder
[38:33] because a hairball in its face she was
[38:36] doing this number all the time I thought
[38:38] lord thank you that brother brother is
[38:40] not safe parallel where we're all
[38:44] supposed to be logical about things too
[38:46] right
[38:47] all right let's let's go ahead and go on
[38:49] god bless you
