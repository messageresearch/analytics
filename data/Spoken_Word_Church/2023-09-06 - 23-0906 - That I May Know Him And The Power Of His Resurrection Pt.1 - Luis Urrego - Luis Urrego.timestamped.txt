[2:33] uh key of G
[2:36] and then you may be seated for just more
[2:43] [Music]
[2:53] the old house
[2:57] that I'm living in is needing
[3:04] repair
[3:07] the windows and
[3:10] the
[3:11] shutters are living in the cold cold air
[3:19] well I say to myself I'm gonna fix it
[3:25] when I can find the time
[3:32] but all
[3:34] right and lately
[3:37] is living on my mind
[3:46] lately on I've got is living on my mind
[3:55] [Music]
[3:58] it seems that's all I'm thinking about
[4:05] most of the time how that soon and very
[4:14] soon I'll leave my troubles far behind
[4:23] lately I've got leaving
[4:28] [Music]
[4:30] on my mind
[4:34] thank you
[4:36] oh I guess I
[4:39] should be looking for a better place to
[4:46] live
[4:48] but I can't seem to get excited about
[4:54] this world and all it has to give
[4:59] oh I couldn't care less if I could buy
[5:05] all with a solid
[5:08] [Music]
[5:12] for one good word this world to me with
[5:19] leaving on my mind
[5:26] lately all I've got
[5:30] leaving on my mind
[5:37] oh it seems that all I'm thinking about
[5:43] [Music]
[5:45] most of the time oh how that soon and
[5:52] very soon I leave my troubles far behind
[6:00] [Music]
[6:22] my mind foreign
[6:29] [Music]
[7:03] praise the Lord Jesus amen
[7:07] thank you sister
[7:08] thank you musicians you may be seated
[7:12] hey man I believe that that's what a
[7:14] Christian should be thinking about amen
[7:16] but how did
[7:18] by leaving this world behind
[7:22] by the resurrection
[7:25] come in Resurrection that we're looking
[7:27] forward to amen
[7:30] and if something else is taking over
[7:32] your your mind and
[7:34] well maybe you just haven't drawn close
[7:37] to Christ yet
[7:38] but if a true born-again Christian amen
[7:41] he wants to have the mind of Christ
[7:44] and and that and that thinking of Christ
[7:47] amen eventually draws him higher
[7:51] until eventually amen you just don't
[7:52] want to be here anymore now we know that
[7:55] this Earth amen is our home because
[7:57] heaven and Earth are coming together
[7:59] we're going to live here
[8:01] amen this is where we're going to be but
[8:03] amen it's not going to mean the same
[8:05] condition we see it now
[8:07] hey man just brother Wade was talking
[8:09] about Sunday man it's gonna be taking
[8:11] this destroy the elements the things are
[8:14] all over the Earth will be destroyed
[8:16] burnt over as Peter says
[8:19] a man there would be no more Satan no
[8:21] more Devils no more sickness no more
[8:24] dementia
[8:25] no more no more no more uh anything no
[8:28] more death no more sorrow no more
[8:29] sickness nothing like that amen
[8:32] Satan will be annihilated and it will be
[8:36] exactly the way God thought it before
[8:38] the foundation of the world Amen
[8:40] and you and me will be reigning over it
[8:43] but for now we have to Reign Over this
[8:46] Earth First
[8:47] because if you don't know how to learn
[8:49] how to Reign Over this Earth then you
[8:50] won't be able to learn how to you won't
[8:52] be able to reign in that in that time
[8:54] amen so this is our moment to shine let
[8:57] the devil know amen who we really are
[8:59] praise God we're the Sons and Daughters
[9:02] of God Amen praise the Lord Jesus well
[9:04] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[9:05] and uh I hope that you all came
[9:09] expecting good to have our visitors here
[9:11] with us God bless you all amen hopefully
[9:14] the Lord bless you all through the
[9:16] through his word this evening amen
[9:18] praise the Lord
[9:20] um just real quick before we get into
[9:22] the word I just want to thank each and
[9:24] every one of you all for the ones that
[9:26] have given towards the efforts there in
[9:28] uh for December and and uh the youth
[9:31] camp in Honduras so we just appreciate
[9:33] you all and like I said if you can't if
[9:37] you can't give that's that's no problem
[9:38] at all just pray that that that that the
[9:41] that the full amount I believe we've
[9:44] taken up about a quarter of it now and
[9:46] there's some money still coming up from
[9:48] Ohio if I'm not mistaken from the
[9:50] brothers up in Ohio
[9:51] that
[9:53] they said that they were gonna give so
[9:56] um so we just appreciate that and I know
[9:58] and brother Eric down there he really
[10:00] appreciates it just can't thank you all
[10:03] enough for everything that you all have
[10:05] done for him and and the church and the
[10:08] family down there
[10:10] um and um there was something else I was
[10:13] going to mention
[10:14] also just continue to remember brother
[10:16] Howe and your prayers and the situation
[10:18] with Brother Boyd and the family there
[10:20] amen there was something else I was
[10:21] going to mention but anyways it might
[10:23] come to my mind later if you have your
[10:25] Bible say man let's turn to Philippians
[10:27] chapter 3. Philippians chapter 3.
[10:32] amen and so the song that I was singing
[10:36] um I guess it kind of goes in tune with
[10:38] what I want to talk about
[10:40] and uh
[10:43] I've been reading on on uh in in First
[10:45] Corinthians chapter 15. and if you all
[10:48] know that's probably one of the if if
[10:51] you had maybe 10 scriptures in the Bible
[10:54] that you'd put as the top ten that'd
[10:56] probably be one of the top 10 scriptures
[10:58] First Corinthians chapter First
[11:01] Corinthians chapter 15 where it talks
[11:04] about the resurrection amen and and and
[11:06] the and and how we identify the in the
[11:10] resurrection and and and Paul goes into
[11:13] details as in into the resurrection and
[11:16] and and then it brings us even brings it
[11:18] even down towards uh the resurrected
[11:22] Saints and a Rapture amen uh they're at
[11:25] the end so uh if you all have time just
[11:28] go through and read that and and just
[11:30] look over it but I just felt led to just
[11:33] go ahead and go this this direction uh
[11:35] just looking at some things there and
[11:37] the Lord showed me some things and I
[11:39] hopefully that the Lord will show you
[11:41] some things through it as well so
[11:43] we might not be able to get it's a long
[11:45] chapter about 58 verses if I'm not
[11:47] mistaken so maybe we might not be able
[11:50] to finish this tonight but we'll uh
[11:52] we'll finish it at another time so in
[11:55] Philippians chapter 3 verse 7 through 11
[11:57] says but what things this is Paul
[12:00] speaking but what things were gained to
[12:02] me those I counted lost for Christ
[12:06] yea doubtless and I count all things but
[12:08] loss for the Excellency of the knowledge
[12:11] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[12:14] suffered the loss of all things and do
[12:18] count them but done
[12:20] now we all know what dung is and dungus
[12:24] is you don't even pay attention to it
[12:26] afterwards
[12:28] this is what he says that he considers
[12:30] everything that he learned
[12:32] all that he had accomplished
[12:35] nothing but something that you just
[12:37] flushed down the toilet
[12:40] can you imagine the conversion that Paul
[12:43] had to think of of his life in that way
[12:48] do we do we do we and sometimes we hold
[12:51] things back in our well I don't want to
[12:53] give this up in my life I don't want to
[12:54] serve Christ uh fully because out that
[12:57] means I'll have to give this music and
[12:59] my life up I'll have to give this up in
[13:01] my life but here Paul he he experienced
[13:05] Christ in such a way that he counted
[13:07] everything that he had learned all his
[13:10] life all the The Prestige that he had
[13:13] gotten nothing but
[13:15] done
[13:18] at this man has really been converted
[13:22] this man's really been converted
[13:24] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[13:27] things see he lost something and do
[13:29] count them but done that I may win
[13:31] Christ
[13:33] and be found in him not having my own
[13:36] righteousness which is which is of the
[13:39] law but that which is through the Faith
[13:42] of Christ the righteousness which is of
[13:44] god by faith
[13:46] and watch this verse 10 that I may know
[13:49] him
[13:50] and the power of his resurrection look
[13:54] the way he words it there the power of
[13:56] his resurrection amen
[13:59] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[14:01] being made conformable unto his death
[14:06] if by any means I might attain unto the
[14:09] resurrection of the Dead amen so let's
[14:12] just buy our heads before we be seated

[16:04] we just want to do a little Wednesday
[16:05] Sunday school service
[16:08] we're just going to go through the
[16:10] scriptures here amen and um
[16:12] but I wanted to read this quote here
[16:15] um you know because
[16:18] I know that do you all know we're living
[16:20] in crazy times in the hour that we're
[16:22] living in
[16:23] if you don't know that amen wake up
[16:26] [Laughter]
[16:27] we're living in an insane world and the
[16:31] country's becoming more insane by the
[16:33] day we have uh uh uh a clown show up in
[16:38] Washington D.C
[16:40] uh and and it just doesn't get better
[16:42] and better we don't even know what's
[16:45] going on up there
[16:47] but that right there is letting us know
[16:50] amen that that's not what we need to be
[16:52] dependent upon
[16:54] I'm not depending my soul and my life on
[16:57] on what's going on in Washington DC or
[17:00] on a coming on coming uh uh the
[17:03] presidential elections people are like
[17:04] well Trump's getting back in this and
[17:06] Trump was the one who put us in this
[17:07] stuff in the first place in 2020. all
[17:10] right so you just think about that all
[17:13] right
[17:14] there's no man amen that's going to save
[17:18] you except the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:20] no no politician amen no no savior the
[17:24] world is looking for a messiah
[17:26] the world is looking for for for a
[17:29] Superman to rise on the scene hey man
[17:31] he's already coming and and gone amen he
[17:35] should be living in you that Superman
[17:38] amen there's not going to be any other
[17:40] Superman but the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[17:42] and that's what we should be hoping for
[17:44] is for the coming of the Lord you know
[17:47] sometimes we talk about we talk about
[17:49] politics and still letting people start
[17:51] who was he going that direction you know
[17:53] but brother Branham talked about
[17:54] politics so anyways but but you see
[17:59] that's not where we need to put our
[18:00] trust on Amen
[18:02] I I hope that 2020 and I hope that this
[18:06] last three years have taught us
[18:07] something
[18:08] because it certainly has taught me a lot
[18:11] of stuff
[18:12] and uh and now they're talking about
[18:15] bringing the masks back in and the
[18:18] lockdowns again
[18:19] or what is that about
[18:22] so you all just just pray
[18:24] you all just pray because it's a clown
[18:27] show it's really what it is
[18:29] so so because I tell you what I'm sick
[18:33] and tired of it to be honest with you
[18:35] amen but brother Brandon says here in
[18:37] the in the mystery Christ in Christ's
[18:39] mystery of God revealed he says but I'm
[18:41] taking I'm talking about the headship of
[18:43] Christ he said he said notice being
[18:46] personally identified by the original
[18:48] headship amen we have the answer to the
[18:52] devil's question amen praise the Lord
[18:55] amen glory we have the answer to the
[18:57] devil's question he Christ is risen and
[19:01] has paid the price and raising up the
[19:04] head the body amen the devil can't stand
[19:07] it
[19:09] and that's the reason why he's howling
[19:11] around here continues here that's the
[19:12] reason these ecumenical kingdoms are
[19:15] setting up that's the reason they're all
[19:17] coming into what they are doing now
[19:21] and they're all in lockstep doing the
[19:23] same thing
[19:24] amen
[19:26] that you can't you can't say it's a
[19:28] coincidence oh it's just a coincidence
[19:29] no they're all in lockstep doing the
[19:31] exact same thing but if we know it's
[19:33] what the power behind it is is nothing
[19:35] but the devil amen and so let the devil
[19:38] do whatever it wants to do because it's
[19:39] drawing us closer to God it's drawing me
[19:42] closer to my knees amen and it should do
[19:46] that to you as well
[19:48] praise God so let the devil do because
[19:50] the Bible says that this Kingdom amen
[19:52] this world is this is the devils
[19:55] this is his domain this is this this is
[19:58] his playground and he's got his little
[20:00] chess pieces
[20:01] amen so let him do whatever he wants to
[20:04] do amen because what that's doing to us
[20:07] amen is drawing us to be more like him
[20:09] amen
[20:10] praise God
[20:13] but we shouldn't be we shouldn't be uh
[20:15] uh
[20:17] uh what's the word I'm looking for
[20:20] we shouldn't be ignorant of the devil's
[20:23] devices
[20:25] we shouldn't be ignorant amen
[20:29] because sometimes women we're just so
[20:30] carried up with the things of this life
[20:33] you got your Apple Apple phone you got
[20:35] your your devices and you got your your
[20:38] job and you got stock in your money in
[20:42] your in your in your bank account ah
[20:44] that all can't happen to me
[20:46] but I do remember brother Brandon
[20:48] talking about a squeeze coming down
[20:52] and gas prices don't seem to be going
[20:54] getting less
[20:57] and food I mean is getting worse it's
[21:02] not the food that's getting more
[21:03] expensive
[21:04] amen it's the money that's that's being
[21:07] devalued
[21:09] so so so
[21:11] it's a little squeeze that's happening
[21:14] amen
[21:17] and this should make us look more and
[21:18] more towards the word
[21:21] and I have so much so much dependence
[21:23] upon this upon this world and upon the
[21:27] the the the the the new gadgets that
[21:29] come out and all that kind of stuff amen
[21:31] that has
[21:33] amen the word is what changes us amen
[21:37] that's the reason these economical
[21:39] kingdoms are setting up that's the
[21:41] reason they're all coming into what they
[21:43] are doing now the devil that's the
[21:47] reason he's howling the way he is
[21:49] amen his wickedness has been his scheme
[21:52] has been uncovered by the Risen
[21:54] resurrected Christ in the headship over
[21:58] his body amen praise the Lord Jesus so
[22:01] he is the head we know that Christ is
[22:03] the head and wherever the head does Amen
[22:06] the body follows amen and if you and I
[22:09] are the body of Christ amen if he raised
[22:11] amen then we raise along with we were
[22:13] raised with him as well amen if you are
[22:16] born again and have this the Holy Ghost
[22:18] dwelling within you praise the Lord
[22:21] amen so as I said you know everyone's
[22:24] looking for a Superman right now amen
[22:26] and and even at the time of brother
[22:28] Brown and brother Brown was was saying
[22:29] how people back then they were looking
[22:31] for a Superman amen and and even in the
[22:34] in the in the days of of Israel amen
[22:36] when where they were looking for the
[22:38] Messiah amen they were looking for
[22:40] someone to come in and stump out the
[22:42] Romans and and and and freedom
[22:44] politically when in reality what they
[22:47] needed was was was was someone to
[22:49] Freedom spiritually
[22:51] and that spiritual savior came and they
[22:54] didn't recognize who he was
[22:57] they didn't recognize that that was God
[22:59] himself coming down to free them
[23:03] God himself not another man not another
[23:06] he didn't say nobody else he came down
[23:08] himself that was who the Messiah was to
[23:11] be
[23:12] and God comes down on the scene amen
[23:15] service after service and and and and in
[23:18] different ways in your life and we fail
[23:20] to recognize that it's God moving on the
[23:22] scene
[23:25] we failed to realize that it's God
[23:27] amen
[23:30] because sometimes we're looking over
[23:31] something else
[23:33] right
[23:35] right and God's Right Here Waiting amen
[23:39] praise the Lord
[23:40] so amen what the bride in this hour
[23:42] desires amen is the resurrection of the
[23:45] Saints
[23:46] and man I'm not looking for anything
[23:47] else but the resurrection because that's
[23:50] the next that's the next coming event
[23:51] amen
[23:53] I don't know what all the details of it
[23:55] are I just know that I want to be ready
[23:57] when it happens
[24:02] amen
[24:03] and there the Bible says that they can't
[24:05] be perfected without us
[24:07] without us they cannot be perfected so
[24:10] you have to be perfected in order for
[24:12] them to be perfected praise God
[24:15] you have to make sure that you are
[24:17] living the life of Christ
[24:19] praise the Lord Jesus now we know that
[24:22] nature testifies of a resurrection amen
[24:24] we see the the sun setting in the
[24:26] morning and it it dies in the evening
[24:29] amen but that's not the end of it
[24:32] amen we see it again coming up in the
[24:34] morning
[24:35] you see and so it's like it's like a
[24:38] resurrection amen we see the the leaves
[24:41] that fall in in in in in in in the fall
[24:43] we're coming to a time right now where
[24:45] where leaves are turning yellow and and
[24:47] they're getting ready to fall and
[24:50] they'll the sap will come down to the
[24:52] the bottom of the tree and and but
[24:55] that's not the end of that tree
[24:58] amen because that tree a man will
[25:01] eventually that sap will come back up
[25:02] amen the leaves will come back out in
[25:04] the springtime and that that tree looks
[25:06] like it never had a death before
[25:09] right
[25:09] you never you never would have thought
[25:12] ma that tree looked barrelless you know
[25:15] a couple of months ago
[25:17] because that's how powerful the
[25:19] resurrection is amen
[25:21] praise the Lord I remember I was I was
[25:23] talking to a brother brother Jorge Rivas
[25:24] who came here to spoke for us a couple
[25:26] of years ago from Colombia and he was in
[25:29] our backyard on our deck he was drinking
[25:32] his coffee he was spending the night at
[25:33] our house drinking his coffee and uh
[25:36] and I'm from Colombia you know so he was
[25:39] back there look drinking and he was just
[25:41] admiring and it was January
[25:43] the dead of winter right and he was just
[25:46] admiring and enjoying the cold
[25:49] drinking his coffee
[25:52] and I went back there and I said I said
[25:54] brother brother Jorge I said this back
[25:57] here looks much nicer in the summertime
[25:59] I mean with all the trees with all the
[26:02] leaves have grown out and everything and
[26:04] he said brother Louise you just don't
[26:05] understand where I'm from I see trees
[26:08] with leaves all the time
[26:10] everywhere I go I see trees with leaves
[26:12] I don't see trees with leaves this is
[26:15] this is I'm enjoying this
[26:17] and I never thought of that you know I
[26:19] never thought that you you know that
[26:21] that they they don't see that
[26:23] if we do we see it and so to them it's
[26:26] something amazing
[26:28] you know we think it's ugly but to them
[26:30] it's amazing at least to him it was and
[26:33] so I said well you know what brother you
[26:34] just keep enjoying keep drinking you
[26:36] want me to get more another cup for you
[26:40] and uh but it's a beautiful time for God
[26:43] too amen
[26:45] you know the trees they look so much
[26:47] beautiful Amen in the in the fall
[26:49] but they're dying the leaves are dying
[26:52] but that's when the the most beauty is
[26:55] the that's when you want to go up to the
[26:57] mountains to look at them right
[26:59] yet the leaves are dying at that moment
[27:01] and so it makes us think about our lives
[27:04] amen how how some of us hey man we're
[27:06] dying amen but but we're dying each and
[27:09] we're once are dying amen our physical
[27:12] bodies are degenerating hey man I don't
[27:14] feel like when I was 21 years old amen
[27:17] but but but but but you see uh the Bible
[27:22] says that precious is the death of his
[27:24] Saints amen so it's something beautiful
[27:27] to him because it's a graduation time
[27:29] for those who for his Saints amen and it
[27:33] also makes him a candidate for a
[27:34] resurrection
[27:36] hey man you think about that
[27:38] praise the Lord because you see there is
[27:41] going to be a time where there's going
[27:43] to be a people who are going to be alive
[27:45] and remain right the Bible talks about
[27:48] that Paul talked about that but then
[27:50] those that are alive and remain would
[27:52] not have experienced what a resurrection
[27:54] is
[27:55] but those that have gone past beyond the
[27:57] curtain of time amen those that have
[27:59] gone before us amen they will be able to
[28:02] experience that and so I believe that
[28:04] that that's beautiful in the sight of
[28:06] God because he knows what it's like
[28:10] because wherever the head goes the body
[28:12] goes with it I always give this example
[28:15] for young people to understand amen when
[28:18] you get up in the morning amen what is
[28:20] the first thing that gets up in the
[28:22] morning
[28:23] it's usually our head
[28:25] right
[28:27] sometimes we drag our feet down on the
[28:29] floor like this and oh God
[28:33] yeah but usually the normal person gets
[28:36] up and his head gets up amen and so
[28:38] that's why Peter I mean Paul here is
[28:42] going to describe as Jesus resurrecting
[28:44] the first fruits of the Resurrection
[28:46] right and we'll read we'll read it here
[28:49] in just a moment so we have no we have
[28:52] not to be uh be afraid of of death
[28:55] Saints amen
[28:57] we we have not need to be uh uh uh to be
[29:01] afraid that well we only we only live
[29:04] for Christ here and we only experience
[29:05] Christ here amen Christ will be with us
[29:08] even there amen praise God I believe the
[29:11] Saints amen that have gone past before
[29:12] us they're enjoying
[29:14] Aaron join Bliss right now and they're
[29:17] they're they're if we could just hear
[29:19] them amen beyond the curtain of time we
[29:21] could just hear him telling us keep
[29:23] going keep praying keep pressing on just
[29:26] keep keep doing what you're supposed to
[29:28] be doing amen because I'm they're saying
[29:30] I'm telling you it's worth it
[29:33] it's worth every every every drop that
[29:36] Every Teardrop that you shed amen every
[29:38] prayer that you pray every scripture
[29:41] that you sit down and take time to read
[29:43] it's it's all worth it amen and it won't
[29:46] be in vain
[29:48] amen and so Paul here in in first in
[29:51] First Corinthians 15 where we're going
[29:53] to be reading here in just a moment amen
[29:55] Paul says amen that if there is no
[29:58] Resurrection amen then what we preach
[30:00] and what you believe is all in vain
[30:05] if there is no such thing as a
[30:07] resurrection
[30:08] everything that we that we Christianity
[30:12] is based upon the fact that we have had
[30:16] a resurrection
[30:17] it was Jesus Christ
[30:20] right
[30:21] and if all that is done away with if
[30:23] there is no such thing as that
[30:27] then why are you here
[30:31] why do you pray
[30:33] why do you just not go back to the world
[30:36] why do you just not go back and doing
[30:39] the things that you used to do
[30:41] remember something has drawn you amen
[30:45] a living Christ has drawn you it's not a
[30:49] dead Christ something dead doesn't draw
[30:51] you but a living Christ does draw you
[30:53] amen a living Christ draws you I I hope
[30:57] it was a living Christ that Drew me
[31:00] amen and I want that living Christ to be
[31:02] living in me amen praise the Lord Jesus
[31:05] so we see it in nature nature testifies
[31:08] of a resurrection Amen brother brother
[31:11] Wade's been talking about metamorphosis
[31:13] amen about the caterpillar even the
[31:16] caterpillar testifies of a resurrection
[31:19] maybe we'll look into that later on Amen
[31:22] I've been looking at some things in in
[31:23] detail about that it it's very powerful
[31:26] by the way
[31:29] the process of metamorphosis
[31:32] but the foundation of the Christian
[31:34] faith is the fact that Jesus resurrected
[31:37] that is the foundation
[31:39] amen that is the foundation you see
[31:41] that's the that's the main point of
[31:43] Christianity amen
[31:44] Christianity can be summed up in in in
[31:47] in in in in this way amen God created
[31:50] man man sin needed a redeemer amen
[31:54] nothing else could redeem him amen but
[31:58] God himself so he came down himself and
[32:01] so he redeemed man but now amen he just
[32:05] doesn't want to redeem him he wants to
[32:06] live in them
[32:08] amen
[32:11] and that's that's that's what that's
[32:13] that's the that's Christianity right
[32:15] there
[32:16] tell me one thing in this life amen that
[32:18] can that can one that that can do that
[32:20] for you
[32:22] amen
[32:24] you know in in the in the comic book
[32:25] world or in the or in the in the stories
[32:28] that that you read amen there's always
[32:30] that that that protagonist amen that
[32:34] if he dies oh we want him to come back
[32:36] again
[32:38] oh
[32:39] and sometimes he does
[32:41] and the series continues right
[32:44] sometimes he does
[32:46] but you see where did they get that yeah
[32:49] it came from the Bible
[32:53] even the world has to testify of a
[32:55] resurrect to Jesus Christ amen praise
[32:57] the Lord
[33:00] amen
[33:02] well thank God for that now
[33:05] the prophet tells us here in in the
[33:08] message Awakening Jesus he says let us
[33:09] remember also that he created our bodies
[33:12] now listen to this I hope that sister
[33:15] freda's list is listening to this listen
[33:17] to this this might help her won't our
[33:20] bodies obey his command
[33:23] if he created him right spit out that
[33:26] cancer he says to the body
[33:28] amen and away it goes praise God you
[33:31] just take that word and plan it in here
[33:34] and see what happens sure yes sir our
[33:36] bodies has to obey his command
[33:40] praise the Lord you you say you're a
[33:42] Christian I believe you are you believe
[33:44] why are you resting what are you resting
[33:46] in someday he'll raise our bodies up
[33:48] after they've absolutely completely
[33:50] perished praise the Lord if you watch
[33:53] this if you don't believe that why do
[33:55] you go to church
[33:58] if you don't believe that if something
[34:01] happens to you maybe on the way to
[34:03] church amen that you are going to amen
[34:06] being coming in a resurrection you're
[34:08] you that same body that went down is the
[34:10] same body that's coming up amen
[34:13] then what you're doing is is in is in
[34:16] vain
[34:17] but we know it's not in vain
[34:19] if you don't believe that why do you go
[34:21] to church if there's no Resurrection
[34:23] aren't we amongst men most miserable
[34:27] but his Word of Promise he that
[34:30] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[34:32] shall he live amen
[34:34] Jesus said I am the resurrection and
[34:36] life amen he that eats my flesh and
[34:39] drinks my blood has eternal life and
[34:41] I'll raise him up at the last days my
[34:44] why the body the ashes the volcanic
[34:46] ashes that we're made out of obey his
[34:49] command because he's the creator of it
[34:51] amen praise the Lord Jesus amen you
[34:54] don't have to sit there with yours and
[34:56] accept your sickness you don't have to
[34:58] sit there and accept your your your your
[35:00] situation amen whatever your body goes
[35:03] through because he's the creator of your
[35:04] body you can speak to it because you
[35:07] have the living Christ dwelling in you
[35:09] amen and the living Christ dwelling in
[35:12] you amen that that thing because Devils
[35:15] were created as well
[35:17] and if the living Christ is living in
[35:19] you amen you can speak to that devil
[35:22] you can speak to that mountain you can
[35:24] speak to that thing amen and it's got to
[35:26] obey
[35:28] the life that's within us is not only a
[35:32] creative life but it's part of his own
[35:34] life
[35:35] that's the reason we have the authority
[35:38] to speak to a devil because it's God's
[35:41] Own created life if your anointed see
[35:43] correctly not you it's not you that
[35:46] speaketh but the father that dwelleth in
[35:48] you amen praise the Lord
[35:50] amen
[35:51] now the the word Resurrection amen this
[35:55] is what it means indeed
[35:57] in the dictionary it says the act or
[35:59] fact of bringing someone back to life
[36:03] or bringing something back into use or
[36:07] existence now the key thing about
[36:09] Resurrection is bringing that same thing
[36:11] back to life
[36:14] it's not replacing
[36:16] Resurrection is not replacement
[36:19] Resurrection is whatever went down is
[36:21] the same thing that comes back up
[36:23] because it was it was the body of Jesus
[36:26] Christ that went down but it's not the
[36:28] body of Jesus Christ that you see in
[36:30] that tomb today it's not is that it's
[36:32] not there it's what came up you see
[36:35] praise the Lord Jesus and so it's not
[36:37] replacement
[36:38] sometimes you know in the nominal world
[36:40] you know we have the thought that that
[36:42] that God's going to give us a another
[36:44] body amen and and I don't know how it
[36:48] all works in regards to the theophany
[36:50] amen but but but there's not another
[36:54] body because something's got to happen
[36:56] to this body that goes down
[36:58] right this body's not going to be lost
[37:01] this body's part of you and me
[37:03] amen so there's got to be a resurrection
[37:06] for this body
[37:08] because it's what happened on uh with
[37:10] Jesus Christ the same body that went
[37:13] down is the same body that came up
[37:15] praise the Lord Jesus
[37:18] so we're it's not going to be lost
[37:22] this is this is you
[37:25] now we know that the the the the the
[37:26] soul is is is the real you God said All
[37:31] Souls are mine
[37:32] and we know that that that is the real
[37:34] you amen but this flesh amen this spirit
[37:38] amen it's part it's part of Who You Are
[37:41] amen there's all there's a connection
[37:43] there and God won't lose that amen
[37:46] praise the Lord Jesus
[37:49] so
[37:51] um there's another part here the
[37:54] resurrection meaning it says
[37:55] Resurrection or anastasis or anastasis
[37:59] is the concept of coming back to life
[38:01] after death
[38:03] in a number of religions a dying and
[38:05] Rising God is a deity which dies and is
[38:08] resurrected reincarnation is a similar
[38:11] process hypothesized by other religions
[38:13] which involves the same person or deity
[38:16] coming back to another body
[38:19] so we know it's not reincarnation amen I
[38:22] don't see the word in anywhere in the
[38:24] Bible but it is resurrection
[38:27] praise the Lord amen you take for
[38:29] example the the the the the the the the
[38:31] example of of pawning something amen
[38:35] when you go upon something and you want
[38:37] to go get that thing back amen they
[38:40] don't give you something else
[38:42] you're pawning amen they're giving you
[38:45] back what you pawned right
[38:47] amen and that's the same thing with
[38:49] Resurrection amen whatever went down is
[38:52] what's coming back up amen praise God
[38:57] now we know that Satan he's the God of
[39:00] this world and and he loves to copy God
[39:04] but in a perverted way
[39:06] amen he's he's a pervert Yeah
[39:09] if you didn't already figure that out
[39:12] he's a pervert and he's making people
[39:14] act like perverts
[39:17] you can see it out in the streets you
[39:19] can see it
[39:21] if you live in Beaufort do you see it a
[39:23] lot there
[39:25] it's terrible you can't even go into
[39:26] Target now
[39:28] how much perversion it is man with
[39:30] dresses
[39:31] and you can't say anything about it
[39:35] that's what I guess Target's losing
[39:37] sales and
[39:39] Budweiser but going out of business
[39:42] well thank God
[39:48] anyways
[39:51] let it happen whatever needs to happen
[39:53] amen but you see
[39:57] Satan we know he can't create
[39:59] he only perverts what has been created
[40:02] amen and and so I you know reading the
[40:06] scientific things and stuff like that
[40:09] you know do you know that they plan to
[40:11] actually they're trying to resurrect a
[40:12] woolly mammoth
[40:16] they want to bring back the woolly
[40:18] mammoth if the woolly mammoth existed I
[40:21] I guess it did
[40:22] but they're trying to bring back the
[40:25] woolly mammoth now this this is what
[40:27] this is what they say yeah I was talking
[40:29] to my daughters about this the the other
[40:31] day and we were talking about this
[40:34] and what they're saying they want to
[40:35] they want to bring it back a woolly
[40:37] mammoth back within a decade
[40:39] this was in 2021
[40:41] so they got a couple more years left
[40:45] but this is what they're saying previous
[40:47] discussions on resurrecting this is and
[40:49] they're using the word Resurrection
[40:52] resurrecting long extinct animals like
[40:55] the woolly mammoth have been largely
[40:57] theoretical but colossal uh is a company
[41:01] or scientific uh consensus or a group
[41:04] that has taken many of the first steps
[41:07] towards
[41:08] resurrecting the creature using a gene
[41:11] editing technology called crispr amen
[41:14] and so if you've never heard of crispr I
[41:16] mean that's what crispr is amen those
[41:19] letters represent uh I forgot what what
[41:22] they represent but it's it's what it is
[41:24] where they keep replicating Gene uh
[41:27] genes and um
[41:29] and they're trying to create they're
[41:31] trying to create humans even in that way
[41:33] so he says here because woolly mammoths
[41:36] and Asian elephant shared a common
[41:39] ancestor some six million years ago
[41:40] church this is the the man spearheading
[41:44] this his last name is church
[41:46] [Laughter]
[41:50] rewrite the elephant's DNA to produce
[41:53] what's to produce something that looks
[41:56] and behaves like a mammoth using crispr
[42:00] you see they can't Resurrect The a true
[42:03] thing
[42:04] they can only copy if they can do this
[42:07] they they can they can only say that we
[42:10] can only bring something that looks like
[42:12] it
[42:14] like a mammoth using crispr which acts
[42:18] as a copy and paste tool for for genetic
[42:20] code that's what Chris that's what
[42:22] crispr technology is so
[42:25] my I thank God that God Amen doesn't
[42:28] just bring something that looks like it
[42:29] amen he brings Resurrection to him is is
[42:32] that whole thing amen the original that
[42:34] went down is the original that comes up
[42:36] praise God Amen so it's the difference
[42:39] between see Satan wants to copy God but
[42:41] he can't
[42:43] he can't he perverts amen he perverts
[42:46] the people he perverts uh uh you you
[42:49] know man trying to be women and women
[42:52] trying to be man and and and the way
[42:56] that they're trying to botch their
[42:57] bodies and and all that stuff and it
[43:00] doesn't work
[43:02] it doesn't work because science say man
[43:05] uh uh tells you amen that it that it
[43:08] that it that it doesn't there's there's
[43:10] a there's a footprint or there's a print
[43:12] right there
[43:13] and you and it doesn't work but a lot of
[43:15] people that say that they're
[43:16] transitioning and they're a lot of them
[43:19] are transitioning trying to transition
[43:21] back
[43:22] because it's not it doesn't work
[43:25] amen there's nothing like the original
[43:28] Saints
[43:29] young people don't don't allow for your
[43:32] for your Minds to be perverted in a way
[43:36] where they're trying to push these
[43:38] agendas on you and say that you're going
[43:40] to be happy and that you're going to be
[43:42] free and that you're going to be a lot
[43:45] of them is just a bunch of work work of
[43:48] taking hormones hormones and doing all
[43:50] kinds of they don't have a peaceful life
[43:53] just because they're trying to make
[43:55] themselves look a certain way
[43:58] that's not the peace of God
[44:00] the peace of God doesn't amen doesn't
[44:03] doesn't uh when the peace of God is
[44:05] really in you amen
[44:08] it's uh it doesn't make you do it it
[44:10] makes you just lay down your burdens
[44:12] give them to the Lord amen praise God
[44:16] amen so
[44:19] so this this crispr technology now they
[44:22] they've succeeded cloning an animal or
[44:24] cloning human body parts
[44:27] my wife was showing me a picture of a of
[44:29] a mouse the other day that that there
[44:31] that their clone or they're trying to
[44:34] build you know human ears upon upon a
[44:37] mouse and it just looks so silly
[44:40] they got this they got this mouse and
[44:42] it's got a a human ear hanging on uh on
[44:45] it and stuff like that and it's such a
[44:47] perversion this is what brother Branham
[44:49] called amen that they're all in God's
[44:51] Laboratory
[44:53] trying to to make something that is that
[44:56] they can say we did it
[44:58] they cloned the Sheep about 20 years ago
[45:01] called Dolly I believe that sheep is
[45:04] dead now yeah
[45:06] yeah and so but they can't call no human
[45:08] they're as far as I know there's no
[45:10] cloned humans because they can't clone a
[45:12] soul
[45:14] that's the reason they can clone an
[45:15] animal but they can't clone a soul amen
[45:18] because the souls belong to God Amen
[45:20] praise the Lord
[45:22] so we just thank God for that
[45:24] now let's go to First Corinthians
[45:26] chapter 15.
[45:30] First Corinthians chapter 15.
[45:35] and we're going to talk about this
[45:36] resurrection of Christ now we'll just
[45:38] take it verse by verse
[45:40] and we'll see how the Lord leads here
[45:45] it's interesting that Paul here he's
[45:47] talking to the to the Corinthians amen
[45:50] and and in the Corinthians you know they
[45:52] were Gentiles and uh
[45:55] you know Paul had some issues with the
[45:57] Corinthians
[45:59] he had to he had to spank him I guess
[46:02] many times
[46:03] and write to them and let them know
[46:05] because they were they were
[46:07] they were uh um
[46:10] uh just very immature
[46:13] and so
[46:14] in this time the Corinthians the
[46:17] Corinthians being uh in the area of
[46:19] Greece amen a lot of people back then uh
[46:23] during in that time they were not not
[46:25] agnostics
[46:27] um um they didn't believe in
[46:29] resurrections and maybe they might have
[46:32] had influences from maybe the Sadducees
[46:35] he uh because the Sadducees did not
[46:38] believe in the resurrection they didn't
[46:40] believe in spirits and they didn't
[46:41] believe in angels so we don't know
[46:44] exactly why the Corinthians some of
[46:46] these Corinthians that Paul is talking
[46:48] to were having a problem with
[46:50] Resurrection
[46:52] but they were so Paul uh starts here in
[46:57] First Corinthians 15 and he tells them
[46:59] moreover Brethren I declare unto you the
[47:02] gospel which I preached unto you which
[47:05] also ye have received and wherein ye
[47:09] stand so we thank God for for for those
[47:11] those that did receive the Gospel amen
[47:14] because imagine living in that time amen
[47:16] where where it was nothing they didn't
[47:19] some of them were just were just
[47:21] heathens
[47:23] and they had they had all these
[47:24] different gods and all these amen and
[47:27] they had one place there for the unknown
[47:29] God
[47:30] and Paul said that's the god I come to
[47:32] preach to you that's the Paul I come to
[47:35] teach you about amen the unknown God so
[47:38] that you can know him
[47:41] and so
[47:43] amen verse two it says by which also ye
[47:46] are saved if you keep in memory what I
[47:49] preached unto you unless you have
[47:51] believed in vain
[47:53] amen
[47:55] for I delivered unto you first of all
[47:57] that which I also received how that
[48:00] Christ died for our sins according to
[48:03] the scriptures amen and you think about
[48:06] this amen that that that in the
[48:09] scriptures you know there's different
[48:11] parts you know uh Isaiah talked about
[48:14] how he was to be wounded by our with our
[48:17] transgressions but it's by his stripes
[48:19] you know we were healed uh Isaiah
[48:22] mentioned that and and then other other
[48:24] prophets mentioned it about it and and
[48:26] you see these different types Amen in in
[48:28] in the scriptures even the the life of
[48:30] Abraham amen you look at the life of
[48:33] Abraham and and how God asked uh asked
[48:35] him a man to go sacrifice your son
[48:38] your only begotten son though you you
[48:42] you're you're the one that you love
[48:45] now at that time Abraham had had Ishmael
[48:48] he had two sons at that time but God
[48:50] tells him go sacrifice the one that you
[48:52] love
[48:54] the one that God promised to him
[48:57] and here goes Abraham imagine this
[49:00] Abraham the Bible says that it was about
[49:02] three days journey
[49:04] three days journey up in the mountain
[49:07] how long was Christ in in the grave
[49:11] heading up
[49:13] and you think about this Abraham in
[49:15] Abraham's mind Isaac was already dead
[49:20] because he was obeying God
[49:24] I'm whatever he said I'm doing
[49:27] can you imagine can you put yourself in
[49:29] that in that position
[49:31] you Dad or or you mom if God told you to
[49:34] do that
[49:36] I'm like Lord just take me
[49:40] take me
[49:42] but he
[49:43] said Abraham go sacrifice your son the
[49:47] one that you love
[49:50] and as he's riding his horse up there as
[49:54] he's walking with his servants
[49:56] his servants are just doing what he's
[49:58] Abraham's telling them to do
[50:00] and Isaac is right there right behind
[50:02] him he's looking at Isaac and his Isaac
[50:04] to him and his mind is already dead
[50:09] because that's the only way he can obey
[50:10] God
[50:13] so he goes he goes he goes to that point
[50:16] and he tells the servants he says stay
[50:18] here me and my lat the ladder are going
[50:20] to go worship but we're gonna come back
[50:25] hey man
[50:26] praise God we're gonna come back
[50:31] and then we know that right there he
[50:33] ties he ties Isaac right there on the
[50:36] table and and Isaac tells him Dad we
[50:39] have the the table and the wood but
[50:41] where is the sacrifice
[50:44] and he said God will provide himself a
[50:48] sacrifice
[50:49] amen
[50:51] and then right there right here before
[50:53] he's getting ready to put that God stops
[50:56] him that angel stops him the angel the
[50:57] Bible says the angel of the Lord
[51:00] amen
[51:01] and so
[51:03] he comes back down the mountain amen
[51:06] they sacrificed the ram call it Jehovah
[51:09] Jireh comes back down to the mountain
[51:11] back with Isaac
[51:13] the way Isaac went is the way he came
[51:15] back
[51:17] amen
[51:18] unharmed untouched
[51:21] amen
[51:22] speaking of a resurrection amen so Paul
[51:27] here is telling us hey man as a Christ
[51:30] died for our sins according to the
[51:33] scriptures
[51:35] in the Old Testament amen many different
[51:37] things that had happened they meant
[51:38] testifying of that
[51:40] and that being one of them and that in
[51:42] verse 4 and that he was buried and that
[51:45] he rose again the third day according to
[51:50] the scriptures
[51:51] amen
[51:53] and that he was seen of cephas then of
[51:57] The Twelve now now Paul here is bringing
[51:59] the the witnesses
[52:02] the witnesses that that witnessed Jesus
[52:05] amen after he was raised from the dead
[52:08] amen because without Witnesses amen
[52:10] anybody can say anything
[52:12] but now here's the here's he bringing
[52:14] Witnesses and that he was seen of cephas
[52:17] then of the twelve
[52:19] after that he was seen of above 500
[52:22] Brethren at once of whom the greater
[52:24] part remain unto this present but some
[52:28] are fallen asleep
[52:31] so
[52:32] it looks like there's over 500 people
[52:34] here that he's mentioning that Saul
[52:37] Jesus after he resurrected
[52:41] amen
[52:43] after that he was seen of of James
[52:46] I'm not sure which one of the James was
[52:48] it it could have been the James that was
[52:50] the brother of Jesus
[52:52] but uh I'm not sure the half-brother of
[52:55] Jesus then then of all the apostles
[52:59] and last of all he was seen of me also
[53:02] as one born out of Due Time amen
[53:06] Amen in the in the in the in the in the
[53:09] Contemporary English version it says
[53:10] finally he appeared to me even though I
[53:12] am like someone who was born at the
[53:15] wrong time
[53:16] amen so Paul is saying here I saw him as
[53:19] well and I'm a witness of his
[53:22] resurrection
[53:23] that he is alive
[53:25] because I talked with him and he changed
[53:27] my life
[53:29] Paul wasn't the same then
[53:32] amen amen when he when he was walked
[53:34] when he was writing Amen on that road to
[53:36] Damascus amen he thought he was all
[53:38] Almighty taken care we're going to just
[53:40] take care of all these Christians we're
[53:42] going to just put them all in jail kill
[53:44] them amen he was he was blinded
[53:48] but then God blinded him
[53:52] he needed to be blinded so that he could
[53:54] see Jesus amen
[53:57] praise God
[53:59] so he so he continued we'll just go down
[54:01] to verse 12 amen it says here now if
[54:03] Christ be preached that he rose from the
[54:06] dead
[54:09] now if Christ be preached that he rose
[54:11] from the dead how say some among you
[54:13] that there is no resurrection of the
[54:16] Dead
[54:17] you know when I was younger and I was
[54:18] this scripture really caught my
[54:21] attention and I'm I'm thinking my how
[54:23] could someone believe that
[54:25] that there is no resurrection of the
[54:27] Dead when when it's the foundation of
[54:30] the scriptures it's the foundation of
[54:32] Christianity
[54:33] that he rose from the dead how says I'm
[54:36] among you that there is no resurrection
[54:37] of that but if there be no resurrection
[54:40] of the dead then is Christ not risen in
[54:44] other words Christ did not rise if
[54:45] there's no Resurrection from that and if
[54:47] Christ be not risen
[54:49] then is our preaching vain
[54:52] and your faith is also vain
[54:55] amen amen
[54:57] so if you don't really believe
[55:00] what that Christ died if you if you read
[55:04] it and you really don't believe it and
[55:05] you can't apply that to your life amen
[55:07] then what are we doing right
[55:10] right you're wasting your time
[55:12] go home
[55:15] you're wasting your time coming to
[55:16] church you're wasting your time kneeling
[55:19] down to pray you're wasting your time
[55:20] telling someone about Christ
[55:22] if Christ did not raise from the great
[55:24] but we know that he raised from the
[55:26] grave amen
[55:28] praise the Lord Jesus
[55:32] and where we have verse verse 14 and if
[55:36] Christ be not risen then is our
[55:37] preaching vein and your faith is also
[55:39] vain verse 15 yea and we are found false
[55:43] Witnesses of God because we have
[55:46] testified of God that he raised up
[55:48] Christ whom he raised not up if if so be
[55:52] that the dead rise not
[55:55] so we're just false Witnesses Paul is
[55:58] saying we're only just false Witnesses
[56:01] if we are preaching that to you and the
[56:03] apostles are false Witnesses everybody
[56:06] that's preached amen that Christ has
[56:08] died and raised amen there's they're
[56:11] just false Witnesses if so be that the
[56:13] dead rise not
[56:15] amen
[56:16] can you imagine I mean the world walks
[56:19] like that in this life
[56:21] with no hope
[56:23] amen but the Christian doesn't have to
[56:24] walk that way we have a hope
[56:27] in Christ
[56:29] amen as I said earlier amen it's a head
[56:32] amen a shoulder that we can lean upon
[56:35] praise the Lord Jesus
[56:37] verse 16 for if the dead rise not
[56:41] then it's not Christ raised
[56:43] and if Christ be not raised your faith
[56:47] isn't is vain ye are yet in your sins
[56:52] now now think about that those are very
[56:55] strong words from Paul
[56:57] amen that if Christ is not raised amen
[57:00] then you are still a sinner
[57:04] you are still yet in your sins
[57:08] if Christ is not raised amen
[57:11] and your faith is in vain what is vain
[57:15] vain means for not
[57:17] it means it means that that there's no
[57:20] purpose amen but we know that's not the
[57:23] case
[57:24] then they also which are fallen asleep
[57:27] in Christ are perished
[57:30] they're gone
[57:32] everybody all your loved ones that have
[57:34] gone past before you they're that
[57:37] they're just rotting in the ground in
[57:39] other words is what Paul is saying
[57:42] amen
[57:43] so we have no hope to seeing them now
[57:45] I'm talking loud now I'm talking like
[57:47] Paul is talking to the Corinthians
[57:50] we have no hope of seeing our loved ones
[57:52] because Christ did not raise
[57:55] you see what kind of imagine living life
[57:58] like that
[58:00] amen what a great thing amen it is to
[58:02] think that amen that that we serve a
[58:05] living Christ
[58:07] amen we that we serve a resurrected
[58:11] Christ
[58:12] and that there were Witnesses of his
[58:14] resurrection
[58:16] and you and I are witnesses of his
[58:18] resurrection
[58:19] amen the life that that that you was
[58:22] once lived amen you don't live anymore
[58:24] why you've experienced that Resurrection
[58:27] amen
[58:29] at least you don't have to
[58:32] true Christianity amen is is as you walk
[58:35] in this way amen
[58:38] and you take a 180 degree turn
[58:41] go back the other way
[58:43] amen
[58:46] sometimes we we do this
[58:52] and we think that that there's a change
[58:55] but is it changed back to the same thing
[58:59] there's no change that's where a lot of
[59:01] people do Christianity Today they just
[59:04] do 360 degree turn
[59:07] and back in the same thing as long as
[59:10] I'm going to church as long as I'm
[59:12] paying my tithes as long as I'm a little
[59:14] bit it doesn't matter what I do at home
[59:16] as long as I'm doing that
[59:19] you're walking the same route that you
[59:21] were that you that you started
[59:24] you need to do the 180.
[59:27] amen Christ is calling you from here you
[59:31] go back and listen to where Christ is
[59:32] calling you from amen
[59:36] truth praise the Lord
[59:40] then they are also which are fallen
[59:42] asleep in Christ or Paris you know we
[59:44] have we have hope saints that we're
[59:45] going to see our loved ones I have hopes
[59:47] that I'm going to see my my in-laws
[59:50] amen
[59:53] I have hopes that we're going to see

[1:00:01] to be
[1:00:02] tomorrow is going to be two years
[1:00:05] since he since he passed away
[1:00:08] what a thing it is to think that I'll
[1:00:11] I'll never see him again
[1:00:13] amen well that we'll never see brother
[1:00:16] Gabriel again or or the Saints that have
[1:00:19] passed on here brother dick and some of
[1:00:21] the Saints
[1:00:22] that's not a consolation is it but what
[1:00:25] a great consolation it is amen
[1:00:28] amen that we are going to see them and
[1:00:30] they're not going to be in the same
[1:00:31] condition that they went down in
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:36] they're gonna be they're gonna be young
[1:00:38] they're gonna be they're gonna be happy
[1:00:40] they're going to they're not gonna have
[1:00:42] gray hair or not even that all right
[1:00:44] what a what a wonderful thing it is to
[1:00:47] think amen you know that that even Jesus
[1:00:50] when he resurrected amen the the the
[1:00:53] gardener
[1:00:55] amen uh they I mean the the Mary
[1:00:58] didn't even didn't even think that that
[1:01:00] was Jesus
[1:01:02] he thought that she she thought that
[1:01:04] that was one of the gardeners or one of
[1:01:06] the area the the man tending the garden
[1:01:08] there
[1:01:09] because he had got he had come back so
[1:01:11] so in such a young looking State again
[1:01:15] she didn't even think that that was
[1:01:17] Jesus
[1:01:18] Jesus worked so hard in in in in his
[1:01:21] lifetime and and did so much his body
[1:01:23] almost was wasted
[1:01:26] and and and almost older looking than
[1:01:29] what he was than what he really was
[1:01:32] right now can you imagine when they were
[1:01:34] when they were hitting him and spitting
[1:01:37] on him and yanking beard and all that
[1:01:39] stuff amen how much more he even looked
[1:01:43] amen the the the The Passion of the
[1:01:46] Christ didn't do that Justice
[1:01:48] although it came close but it didn't it
[1:01:51] didn't it didn't do amen justice of what
[1:01:53] Jesus really looked like
[1:01:55] his ribs showing and all kinds of things
[1:01:59] but when he came back and resurrected
[1:02:01] from that grave amen even Mary didn't
[1:02:03] even recognize who he was and then can
[1:02:06] you imagine amen that the resurrection
[1:02:07] of the Saints amen and they're walking
[1:02:10] amongst us amen
[1:02:13] maybe we brush right by him and we don't
[1:02:15] even know that's that's one of them
[1:02:18] and they'll say brother Louise yeah huh
[1:02:22] I don't know
[1:02:23] I'm just wanting it so bad amen
[1:02:26] I don't know how it'll happen amen
[1:02:30] rushing right there around my brother
[1:02:31] who are you
[1:02:33] or maybe we will know exactly amen but
[1:02:37] I mean we will know that it's our loved
[1:02:39] ones
[1:02:40] amen we definitely know
[1:02:42] you just you just ever stop to think of
[1:02:45] how it all happened
[1:02:46] it's it's it's amazing to even think
[1:02:49] about amen
[1:02:51] I'm gonna let you all go here I'll start
[1:02:53] rambling here in just a moment
[1:02:57] I hope you're enjoying the word
[1:02:59] I'm I'm just reading the word
[1:03:03] then they also which are falling asleep
[1:03:05] in Christ or Parish verse 19. in this
[1:03:09] life and we'll stop here at verse 20 in
[1:03:12] this life
[1:03:13] only we have hope in Christ
[1:03:15] we are all okay so he's saying if in
[1:03:19] this life only we have hope in Christ we
[1:03:23] are of all man most miserable
[1:03:26] and if we can't take the same Christ
[1:03:28] that we have obtained here in this life
[1:03:30] on the other life on the other side and
[1:03:33] we're just very miserable is what Paul
[1:03:35] is saying
[1:03:36] amen
[1:03:38] in other words he says here if our hope
[1:03:40] in Christ is good only for this life we
[1:03:44] are worse off than anyone else
[1:03:46] yeah
[1:03:47] verse 20 but now
[1:03:50] now I like that but now
[1:03:55] I like I like that that that that that
[1:03:58] that word amen that it's not a
[1:04:01] conjunction I think it's a conjunction
[1:04:03] I don't know what what the word bud is
[1:04:04] but but now
[1:04:07] amen so if something was a certain way
[1:04:10] then amen but now there's a change right
[1:04:14] but now is Christ risen from the dead
[1:04:18] amen
[1:04:20] when are you the sons of God now are you
[1:04:23] the sons of God why because now is
[1:04:26] Christ risen from the dead and become
[1:04:28] and become the first fruits of them that
[1:04:32] slept amen praise the Lord Jesus
[1:04:35] so he is the the the the head the head
[1:04:39] of the body right
[1:04:41] and wherever the body goes
[1:04:44] the wherever the the head goes the body
[1:04:46] follows praise the Lord
[1:04:49] so if he resurrected from the dead
[1:04:51] nothing could stop him death hell on the
[1:04:54] grave amen couldn't stop couldn't stop
[1:04:56] God
[1:04:58] amen but he had to overcome he had to
[1:05:02] face death he had to face hell and he
[1:05:05] had to face the grave in order to
[1:05:07] overcome them
[1:05:09] and it's the same thing with you and I
[1:05:11] Saints amen we have to face dangers we
[1:05:13] have to face hardships we have to face
[1:05:15] problems in order for us to come out
[1:05:18] Overcomers on the other side
[1:05:20] amen the Christian life isn't easy
[1:05:23] and I know that you all can say Amen to
[1:05:26] that
[1:05:28] it's not easy
