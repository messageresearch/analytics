[0:00] BL you Saints good to be in the house of
[0:01] the Lord I'm excited for What the Lord
[0:04] Has in stay store for us
[0:09] today let's
[0:12] uh see if this works there we go I want
[0:16] to start off just we've been kind of
[0:17] meditating on what um Paul was talking
[0:20] about with uh the the sacrifice that
[0:23] Christ made and how we're identified
[0:24] with that sacrifice and we've got to
[0:26] give ourselves up I'm just looking at
[0:28] this um quote that brother Ram said in
[0:31] the message the token where he said a
[0:33] lamb is self-sacrificial it doesn't take
[0:36] claim its own can lay it right down and
[0:39] Shear the wool off of it that's the only
[0:41] thing that's
[0:43] got so I just as we're studying these
[0:46] scriptures this morning just kind of uh
[0:47] think about the attributes of a
[0:49] Christian and the attributes of you know
[0:52] when you're living out in the world and
[0:53] you're not saved you you want things
[0:55] done for you you want to take you want
[0:57] you know you start you're living from a
[1:00] more selfish perspective but a Christian
[1:03] it changes everything instead of taking
[1:05] you're giving and look at this little
[1:07] lamb just like Christ died on the cross
[1:09] he gave instead of taking he was giving
[1:12] and a lamb a little that Christian
[1:14] nature is is just it's just going to
[1:17] give out and that's that's that's really
[1:21] you start identifying like uh that
[1:24] sermon that brother R preached the
[1:25] serment of spirits he talked about how
[1:27] that uh uh the spirit of God when it's
[1:30] manifested in a Believer it's just going
[1:32] to act out the nature of Christ and
[1:35] there's the nature of Christ being acted
[1:36] out that that lamb they like a dove a
[1:39] lamb just real just real simple and um
[1:43] and humble and just it's just making
[1:46] wool it's just giving out you you come
[1:49] and take the wool off of it get some
[1:51] laneline get all the things that it's
[1:53] given out just natural and he said it
[1:55] never never says anything about it just
[1:58] sacrifices everything as God
[2:00] that's a lamb even you know Monica talks
[2:04] about how when she was growing up they
[2:06] she's got that story of how her family
[2:08] would kill all the Lambs they'd have the
[2:10] lamb killing day and she'd wake up in
[2:12] the middle of the night with the lamb
[2:14] laying on the you know the the kitchen
[2:16] table and she'd look up there and see
[2:17] the Lambs there but to the lamb the lamb
[2:20] would just that they just bite their
[2:21] tongue and they don't make any sound
[2:23] when they're being killed they just they
[2:25] just give it up they they not struggle
[2:28] and that's what lamb of that Christian
[2:30] nature just just ready to give and and
[2:33] give to somebody else now see there's
[2:35] the difference between that worldly
[2:37] nature wants to take from everybody but
[2:39] a Christian nature is about living for
[2:42] others there's Christianity is living
[2:44] for others doing for others always
[2:47] putting the other first and that's what
[2:49] real humility is that's what real uh all
[2:52] the things that you can trace out
[2:54] through the scripture real Christianity
[2:56] is for others that's a lamb it gives
[2:59] everything it gives everything away
[3:01] itself and all it is so as we study out
[3:04] what Paul said about uh uh sacrifice
[3:07] let's let's just go to the Lord in
[3:09] prayer before we study these things out
[3:10] Lord God we're so grateful to be able to
[3:12] gather around your word this morning
[3:14] today and Lord to look into these things
[3:16] and studying them out Lord and Lord
[3:18] every little line that Paul spoke was
[3:20] just packed full of goodness and
[3:22] richness and treasures Lord Jesus and I
[3:24] pray God that you'll just help us to
[3:25] unpack the things that Paul said in
[3:27] every little line of the things that he
[3:28] spoke be with us today Lord I pray
[3:30] you'll be with brother Wade as he's
[3:32] prepared and studying Lord Jesus and
[3:33] Open the Eyes of our heart Lord As we
[3:35] sing that song Lord as you'll open our
[3:36] eyes of understanding to know Lord
[3:39] whatever we have need of Lord that
[3:40] you'll help us in your name
[3:44] amen so Paul is saying here he said
[3:46] wherefore Jesus also that he might
[3:48] sanctify the people with his own blood
[3:51] suffered without the gate so he went
[3:54] beyond all their ideas all the ideas of
[3:56] the Pharisees all the ideas of the
[3:57] people of that day and went outside the
[3:59] gate to to be to die to to give up
[4:02] everything not to take but to just give
[4:05] it all up he said let us go forth
[4:07] therefore unto him without the camp so
[4:09] we got to follow behind him and do the
[4:11] same thing with our with our own lives
[4:14] bearing his reproach for here have we no
[4:16] continuing City but we seek one we seek
[4:19] one to come and that should give us
[4:21] that's the confidence of a Christian
[4:23] because a Christian Life you know really
[4:25] really you start meditating on how a you
[4:28] you think that a Christian Life would be
[4:29] a flowery bed of roses and just nice and
[4:32] neat and everything but really when you
[4:34] get dive into Christianity you start
[4:36] giving your life to God you become a
[4:38] prisoner to God like Paul said I'm a
[4:40] prisoner and it begins begins to be
[4:43] maybe you go through times like job
[4:45] where you just look around and it's just
[4:46] a lot of sadness and things you're going
[4:49] through those deep those valleys but you
[4:51] know it's a valley a valley like the the
[4:53] three Hebrew children that went into the
[4:55] fire that's a valley when you see when
[4:58] you really see Christ on display and
[5:01] because because we have that confidence
[5:03] that he we have no continuing City we're
[5:05] we're on the road for something we're
[5:07] we're marching to something we're
[5:09] looking we're we're looking at not the
[5:11] things that we can see around we're not
[5:12] looking at the valley but we're looking
[5:14] to Christ and that's where our
[5:16] confidence is so we go out we got to go
[5:18] out beyond the camp following after
[5:20] Jesus and going beyond the camp brother
[5:23] brand said now watch what he says to do
[5:24] now in closing put out of the camp where
[5:27] the sacrifices was burned and that's
[5:29] what we're talking about Christ was a
[5:31] sacrifice and that's where he belonged
[5:33] he was the sacrifice now if we follow
[5:36] him out we've got to sacrifice our own
[5:38] self as well just like a little lamb
[5:41] just giving everything up ready to give
[5:43] up your own life and you think as we
[5:45] study this out you think about all the
[5:47] things that a Christian has to sacrifice
[5:49] even here when you when you sit here in
[5:51] church and maybe something will be
[5:52] explained that you don't quite
[5:54] understand like like so many times
[5:55] people will struggle with the those
[5:58] little basic what we call Basic
[6:00] doctrines of of of of Oneness of the
[6:03] godhead and how to be baptized and
[6:05] things and you got to sacrifice your old
[6:08] denominational ideas the way that you
[6:11] were maybe were raised up you got to lay
[6:13] that down and you got to battle it out
[6:15] and it's a sacrifice maybe it might take
[6:17] a long night of hard prayer to maybe
[6:19] you're searching through the scripture
[6:21] where does it say that anybody was ever
[6:25] baptized in the name of the father Son
[6:26] and Holy Ghost and you battle it out and
[6:29] and after a while you just got to lay
[6:31] down your own thoughts and take what
[6:33] God's word says and that's that's how it
[6:35] is all through the scripture you you
[6:37] battle it out so so many times you know
[6:39] you see people they look at a quote or
[6:41] they look at a scripture and they're
[6:43] just they you can see that it says it
[6:45] right there on the page but they just
[6:47] can't sacrifice their own idea and just
[6:50] take what it says and that that's that
[6:52] so the whole Christian Life is sacrifice
[6:55] you got to sacrifice your ideas you got
[6:57] to sacrifice your thoughts you got to
[6:58] sacrifice your will you have to
[7:00] sacrifice everything for God for the
[7:03] other person you got to lay down
[7:05] yourself for the other now brother Ram
[7:08] said in going beyond the camp he said
[7:09] too he said now brother sister do you
[7:11] know that each one of you all must
[7:13] sacrifice you must be God's sacrifice
[7:16] sacrifice the things of the world
[7:18] sacrifice your own pleasures of this
[7:19] world sacrifice the things of this world
[7:22] you know the reason that people won't do
[7:24] it and he said we're not asked to
[7:27] manufacture
[7:28] something we we're asked to Bear the
[7:30] fruit of the spirit just like the little
[7:32] lamb that we're talking about that is
[7:34] the inside of the sheep what he is on
[7:36] the inside makes the wool on the outside
[7:38] and when a man has got Christ on the
[7:40] inside it makes him Christlike on the
[7:43] outside not some artificial put on now
[7:47] see there I I love quotes like this and
[7:49] where we're studying on sacrifice
[7:51] because that makes our pattern that
[7:52] we're following we sometimes you get so
[7:54] caught up in looking at somebody else as
[7:56] an example of how you should be as a
[7:58] Christian but our p pattern is the word
[8:00] and the word says that we're supposed to
[8:02] be like a little lamb or a little Dove
[8:04] just willing to lay everything down so
[8:07] that Christ can live in us and so
[8:09] Hebrews 13:15 says by him therefore let
[8:12] us offer what the sacrifice of praise
[8:15] that even your praise is a sacrifice and
[8:18] that's where sometimes many of us we
[8:19] struggle in church because we're so
[8:21] careful about what somebody else thinks
[8:23] about us that we don't want to say Amen
[8:25] we don't want to lift our hand because
[8:26] we're so careful it's it's and where
[8:29] where I'm going with this lesson is
[8:31] selfishness selfishness where you're so
[8:34] you're more concerned about yourself
[8:36] than really letting loose and praising
[8:39] God or laying down yourself that's
[8:40] that's what it all you got to sacrifice
[8:44] yourself but what when you when you
[8:46] really can break through and not care
[8:48] just Worship in the way that God wants
[8:51] you to maybe just cut loose with with
[8:53] crying or or or just whatever way that
[8:56] that that you are made to be and and
[8:58] begin to sacrifice that's when you can
[9:01] really see God begin to
[9:03] move let us offer the sacrifice of
[9:06] praise to God continually that is the
[9:07] fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
[9:09] name but to do good and to communicate
[9:12] forget not for with such sacrifices God
[9:15] is well pleased so the whole Christian
[9:18] Life doing good and and acting out
[9:20] Christianity all those things it's it
[9:22] it's all sacrifices everything that a
[9:25] Christian does is
[9:27] sacrifice and show us the the father and
[9:29] it suffices he he says but now back to
[9:32] Cain and Abel when Cain worshiped he
[9:34] built an altar he sacrificed he
[9:36] worshiped God but that wasn't enough and
[9:39] it was beautiful no doubt the flowers
[9:40] and things that grows in the field and
[9:42] he de decorated his altar while soon as
[9:45] Easter come while soon as as soon as
[9:47] Easter come across the Nations there'll
[9:50] be million dollars spent for Easter
[9:52] flowers that go on the
[9:54] altar well God don't care about that
[9:56] Easter flower on the altar he wants you
[9:59] on the altar you're the person for the
[10:01] altar not your flower or your money he
[10:05] wants you the altar was built for you to
[10:08] sacrifice your own will to his
[10:12] will now there's there's the thing of
[10:15] look looking in the scripture seeing
[10:17] what God says you're supposed to do and
[10:19] and then laying down your own will and
[10:21] saying I I accept God instead of my own
[10:25] will my own thoughts I'm willing to lay
[10:27] down everything
[10:30] that's why so as we study these things
[10:33] out we'll find out some things that we
[10:34] got to sacrifice one we got to sacrifice
[10:36] our personal desires and self-will just
[10:39] like uh Jesus was was showing us as an
[10:41] example as he died on the
[10:43] cross Jesus said in Matthew chapter 16
[10:47] If any man will come after me let him
[10:49] deny himself and take up his cross what
[10:52] what does that mean deny yourself so
[10:55] that you can prefer somebody else in
[10:57] your whole Christian Life that's that's
[10:59] how that's how you have a good marriage
[11:01] as you get so selfish and you're like
[11:03] well I ain't taking out the trash that's
[11:04] your job or whatever but if you're
[11:06] willing to to lay down your own life and
[11:10] serve your spouse lay down your own life
[11:13] and serve your children when you get
[11:14] home from a hard day at work and and you
[11:17] uh you're too tired to have devotions
[11:20] but but you do it anyway maybe you're
[11:22] too you're too tired to pray but you
[11:24] you're willing to lay down your own
[11:26] self-will and and get on your knees and
[11:29] and pray for a little bit you because
[11:31] you're it's the whole thing is sacrifice
[11:34] for whosoever will save his life shall
[11:36] lose it and whosoever will lose his life
[11:39] for my sake shall find it in questions
[11:43] and answers brother Ram said see Satan
[11:45] was once the Archangel of God and we're
[11:47] talking about uh sacrifice in your life
[11:51] giving versus taking and we'll see here
[11:54] that the nature of Satan is actually to
[11:56] take and to exalt himself rather than to
[11:59] Humble himself he once dwelt in the
[12:02] heaven he once was the greatest person
[12:04] in the heavens outside of God he was
[12:06] God's rightand man to fellowship and he
[12:08] got puffed up in his heart and isn't
[12:10] that just the way that people get today
[12:13] let God just bless a fell and put a
[12:15] little confidence in him and he gets to
[12:17] be a know-it-all he gets to be he's got
[12:19] to start an organization or he's got to
[12:21] do something that's different why AR
[12:23] thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer God
[12:25] has a hard time trying to get somebody
[12:27] that he can deal with that'll stay
[12:29] humble and meek and stay in the place
[12:33] until God calls him to do something you
[12:35] believe that see a man that God can
[12:37] bless and he'll still keep himself a man
[12:40] not be an angel or a God why is it so
[12:43] hard because what we're battling is self
[12:46] we're battling our self and when you
[12:47] begin to see self rise up you know
[12:50] that's not of God because the that Godly
[12:53] christly nature is going to be like a
[12:55] little lamb that's willing to just give
[12:57] whatever it produces give it away when
[13:01] you begin to see self rise up that's
[13:03] something's something's off-kilter
[13:05] and questions and answers brother R said
[13:08] as soon as a man gets blessed and has a
[13:10] little something given to him he wants
[13:12] to become a God that's that's that
[13:15] humanism humanism is where you begin to
[13:17] worship yourself instead of God you
[13:20] start looking at your ideas well I I I'm
[13:22] I don't I don't care what the Bible says
[13:25] I'm going to take my what I think is the
[13:27] authority he wants wants to become an
[13:29] angel he wants to become some great
[13:31] person what I do what me and me and mine
[13:34] all that that's the wrong attitude God's
[13:37] hunting for somebody who he could bless
[13:40] and pour out the blessings and more he
[13:42] blessed the little the man will become a
[13:47] ain't that
[13:48] something the more He blesses you that
[13:51] the smaller and the liter you become
[13:54] that's right that that's got to be a
[13:56] supernatural act for for somebody to
[13:59] overcome self so much until they can get
[14:02] smaller and smaller and little the more
[14:05] that God pours out his blessings on
[14:08] them so selfishness is the biggest enemy
[14:11] brother BR said the greatest enemy you
[14:13] got is
[14:14] yourself that's the reason we have to
[14:16] Die
[14:17] daily that's the reason Paul had to Die
[14:20] daily he had to die to Paul in order
[14:24] that Christ could live in him what what
[14:26] does that mean to die every day every
[14:29] day every day you come home from work
[14:31] maybe and you you want what you want
[14:33] instead of instead of maybe like brother
[14:35] R said he come home and course we all
[14:37] fail at this you come home I certainly
[14:39] do you come home and and and rather than
[14:41] doing something for your spouse you just
[14:43] want everything done for you you want
[14:45] the whole family to serve you you want
[14:47] everything done for you and instead of
[14:49] instead of trying to do for others and
[14:52] and and that's see that's the battle
[14:54] that that's and that that's really you
[14:56] know that's what a minister gets up
[14:57] behind the platform and they they've
[14:59] laid down their own life through the
[15:02] week they got home after after work and
[15:05] they went to studying and they study and
[15:07] pray and study and pray because they're
[15:09] trying to give out something selfishness
[15:12] getting rid of yourself getting rid of
[15:13] your own ideas and your own Ambitions
[15:15] and things just like Jesus there in the
[15:17] Garden of Gethsemane that we keep
[15:19] laboring the point on that he could have
[15:21] said well I'm I want my own way that I'm
[15:24] going to have a family I'm going to I'm
[15:26] going to get married to a nice girl have
[15:28] a family I'm I'm going to just lay what
[15:30] what my plan and purpose is aside but
[15:34] instead of that he said not my will not
[15:38] my will I'm laying I'm crucifying My Own
[15:40] will there in the Garden of Gethsemane
[15:43] he's laying his own will down and doing
[15:45] what his plan and purpose was which was
[15:47] to that's the hard Road that's hard
[15:49] that's why Christianity sometimes is
[15:50] hard to lay down your own will and do
[15:53] what God wants to to see done so that
[15:56] his plan and purpose can be fulfilled
[16:01] self-will self-will is always to lift
[16:03] yourself up but God's will see I got a
[16:06] little picture here this man in front of
[16:08] the mirror he's doctoring himself up
[16:09] he's got a little Halo he's thinking
[16:11] great of himself boy look at me I I've
[16:15] got a nice suit I got a brand new
[16:17] haircut that probably cost me
[16:19] $150 I'm I'm somebody I got this halo
[16:22] over my head look how great I am but on
[16:25] the other hand you got somebody that's
[16:27] willing to do something for somebody
[16:28] else willing to go take some get get
[16:31] some groceries for a little old sister
[16:35] or help somebody Christianity real
[16:38] Christianity is living for other people
[16:42] living for others and that's why I I
[16:45] love this Parable what the Jesus told in
[16:47] Luke chapter 14 I'm not going to belabor
[16:49] the point but down there at verse 11 he
[16:50] said who whosoever exalteth himself
[16:52] shall be abased and he that humbleth
[16:54] himself shall be exalted now there's the
[16:57] story of real Christianity in that
[16:59] little lamb just willing to just give
[17:01] out give out for other
[17:04] people so
[17:06] selfishness selfishness is really you
[17:09] could say it's is it the greatest evil
[17:12] it's it's certainly an evil and as aw
[17:15] pink said he said the very essence of
[17:17] sin is the determination to have my own
[17:22] way and and you can follow that all
[17:24] through the Bible look at look at Cain
[17:26] who said if if I'm going to come to God
[17:28] it's going to have to be my way could
[17:30] you imagine a man sitting there seeing
[17:32] the fire of God come down and consume
[17:35] Abel's sacrifice and saying I don't care
[17:37] I'm going to do my own way anyway I
[17:39] don't care and that's how so many people
[17:41] look at the Bible they read the Bible
[17:43] that way they can see it
[17:45] Vindicated and the life of Christians
[17:47] all around them and the life of brother
[17:48] brandham and that they'll turn away from
[17:50] it because they're unwilling to lay down
[17:51] their own life and accept what is plain
[17:54] as day before their face and Martin
[17:56] Luther Martin Luther said he said the
[17:58] sin underneath benath all our sins is to
[18:00] trust the LIE of the serpent that we
[18:01] cannot trust the love and grace of
[18:03] Christ and must take matters into our
[18:06] own hands that that's self selfishness
[18:10] and he said again God created the world
[18:12] out of nothing so long as we are nothing
[18:15] he can make something out of us now you
[18:17] see how that permeates every every fast
[18:20] we we'll go you know maybe maybe today
[18:22] some of you will go home and you'll
[18:24] think uh maybe you'll be upset maybe
[18:27] some of the the way that the that
[18:28] Christianity is is presented and you'll
[18:30] go home and you'll have your own
[18:32] conception of how things are and you and
[18:34] you maybe you won't come to church and
[18:35] you'll battle it out you'll think I
[18:38] would rather have Christianity my way
[18:41] than to do what the Bible says I'm going
[18:43] to just stay at home and and stew in my
[18:46] little uh my my little situation and be
[18:49] upset at that this or that or or be
[18:51] upset at the way the gospel is presented
[18:53] or something that happen in that church
[18:55] and I'm just going to stay away from
[18:56] church I'm not going to repent I'm not
[18:58] going to lay down my life and there is
[19:00] selfishness that's why that's the worst
[19:03] the worst thing is selfish you f follow
[19:06] that all the way down through scripture
[19:07] from Judas and
[19:09] balum God come down and told balum how
[19:13] to prophesy and yet balum said I I'd
[19:17] rather have the money I'd rather have
[19:19] the
[19:20] popularity s popularity and money and
[19:23] all those things where we're unwilling
[19:25] so look at look at all these stories in
[19:27] Scripture it was Adam and man selfish
[19:29] decision to eat what was forbidden that
[19:31] led to sin entering the world in the
[19:33] fall of humanity when God told him not
[19:35] to do it but they'd rather believe their
[19:37] own their own way and their own ideas
[19:39] instead Cain's jealousy and selfishness
[19:42] led him to murder his brother Abel when
[19:45] giving a choice lot selfishly chose the
[19:48] best land for himself
[19:51] that's because you given a choice and
[19:54] somebody like lot will always choose
[19:58] for themsel and the Rich Young Ruler
[20:01] selfish attachment to his possessions
[20:03] kept him kept him from following Jesus
[20:06] and Judas is carot his selfishness led
[20:09] him to betray Jesus for 30 pieces of
[20:12] silver and ananas and Safar selfishly
[20:15] kept back a portion of the proceeds from
[20:17] their sale of the land while claiming to
[20:20] get everything to the
[20:21] church and you look at uh uh just kind
[20:25] of studying this
[20:26] out in in Isaiah chapter 14 it talks
[20:30] about Satan's and you know really if you
[20:34] meditate on this the war in heaven
[20:36] started before way back before the
[20:38] foundation of the world and that that
[20:40] great battle began to be fall out
[20:42] between the angels and and and and Satan
[20:45] Satan and and all the angels that he
[20:47] pulled away and those same Angels now
[20:50] are in the church anointing people
[20:52] anointing people that with the same
[20:53] attributes they come and they they uh
[20:56] that same battle now has come to the
[20:57] Earth and they're anointing you so the
[21:00] same attributes that s Satan
[21:02] demonstrated now is being demonstrated
[21:04] here on the earth you can see the
[21:06] selfishness of Satan can be is now being
[21:09] demonstrated in the selfishness of
[21:11] people look look at what Satan said in
[21:12] Isaiah 14 I will Ascend into heaven so
[21:15] Satan wanted to exalt himself I will
[21:18] exalt my throne above the stars of God
[21:21] Satan's ambition to have authority and
[21:23] dominion over the angels He said I will
[21:26] sit also upon the Mount of the
[21:27] congregation and these are if you study
[21:29] this out these are the five wheels of
[21:31] Satan in Isaiah
[21:33] 14 I will Ascend above the heights of
[21:36] the
[21:36] clouds I will be like the most high the
[21:41] ultimate expression of Satan's pride and
[21:43] his desire to be equal with God so look
[21:46] how you can discern you can discern
[21:49] because the the attribute of Christ is
[21:52] always to just give out like a little
[21:54] lamb just give out and the attribute of
[21:56] Satan is always to take to se be selfish
[22:00] to to to gather to
[22:05] himself I will Ascend into heaven
[22:08] Proverbs 16:18 says Pride goeth Before
[22:11] Destruction and an Hy spirit before a
[22:14] fall and in James 4:6 he says but he
[22:18] giveth more grace wherefore he saith God
[22:20] resisteth the proud but giveth Grace
[22:23] unto the
[22:25] humble I will exalt my throne above the
[22:28] stars of God and you know I got this
[22:30] little Point here just written out true
[22:32] greatness comes from through serving
[22:35] others and Mark chapter 10 he said but
[22:37] Jesus called to them and saith unto them
[22:39] ye know that they which are accounted to
[22:42] rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship
[22:45] over them and their great ones exercise
[22:47] Authority upon them but so shall it not
[22:50] be among you but whosoever will be great
[22:54] among you shall be your minister and
[22:56] whosoever of you will be the chiefest
[22:58] shall be servant of all for even the son
[23:01] of man came not to be ministered unto
[23:04] but to minister and to give his life a
[23:07] ransom for
[23:10] many Satan said I will sit also upon the
[23:13] Mount of the
[23:15] congregation in other words I I want to
[23:17] have control instead of submitting to
[23:20] God's word to submitting to his will I
[23:22] want to be in control but Matthew 6:33
[23:26] says seek ye first the kingdom of God
[23:29] and his righteousness and all these
[23:31] things shall be added unto you Satan
[23:34] said I will Ascend above the heights of
[23:36] the clouds in other words uh you you're
[23:39] pursuing after to pursue after power and
[23:42] control over your circumstances and
[23:44] things that's that's where we go wrong
[23:46] is we look at circumstances and we get
[23:49] so worried about politics and things and
[23:52] instead of just submitting to God and
[23:54] trusting that God's going to bring
[23:56] things to pass he's going to he it we
[23:59] like James said submit yourselves
[24:01] therefore to God resist the devil and he
[24:04] will flee from you and Proverbs chapter
[24:06] 3 says trust in the Lord will all with
[24:09] all thine heart and lean not unto thine
[24:11] own understanding and all thy ways
[24:14] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[24:16] paths now that's where we struggle is to
[24:19] trust in God and not our own
[24:22] understanding to look to the word for
[24:23] our guidance and not our own thoughts or
[24:26] not our own will but if the word says
[24:28] that the word we've got that promise the
[24:30] spirit of truth will lead and guide us
[24:33] into all truth and the word is what is
[24:35] guiding us and leading
[24:37] us I will be like the most high the
[24:41] human temptation to act as our own God
[24:44] determining what is right and wrong for
[24:46] ourselves and others when God Alone is
[24:49] the source of Truth and we should submit
[24:51] to his will like Isaiah 55 says for my
[24:55] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[24:58] are your ways my ways sayith the Lord
[25:00] for as the heavens are higher than the
[25:02] earth so are my ways higher than your
[25:04] ways and my thoughts than your
[25:06] thoughts and in John chapter 14 it said
[25:09] Jesus saith and him I am the way the
[25:11] truth and the life no man cometh unto
[25:15] the father but by me and my wife and I
[25:18] were walking down the the the road one
[25:20] day and we we stopped there was a man at
[25:22] his mailbox and and he started talking
[25:24] to us and he was saying all all
[25:26] religions all religions lead to
[25:29] Salvation and I my my mind went back to
[25:32] this scripture that he said I am the way
[25:35] Jesus is the only way but that's see
[25:36] that's the battle when the Bible says
[25:39] something and our mind and our thought
[25:41] and our background and the way that we
[25:43] raised says something different are we
[25:45] willing to lay that down and take what
[25:48] the Bible says instead to take what God
[25:52] Said now that's what the sacrifice is to
[25:54] sacrifice your will and your thoughts
[25:57] and your ambition
[25:58] and lay everything down like Jesus did
[26:01] at the Garden of Gethsemane and just lay
[26:03] it all down for Christ then Christ can
[26:07] really use us if we're willing to
[26:09] sacrifice it all God bless you Saints
[26:13] [Applause]
