[18:16] Betsy a man on it we could just remove
[18:20] all you know the Word of God is so
[18:22] wonderful ha you we were always
[18:26] strolling on that Abraham and whatnot
[18:28] and there's a relative over of one time
[18:31] to us I'm he was saving it up ever hums
[18:35] first prayer and I thought my I never
[18:38] thought whatever hunts for spreading was
[18:40] you know and his first prayer was I
[18:44] sleep he says the Lord what are you
[18:46] going for support recorded product what
[18:48] are you going to give me see and I go
[18:50] chalice right not was that my islands
[18:53] all right you know so what a God is
[18:55] always eternal event no matter how much
[18:58] you came to the one you know it for more
[19:00] and more and more 3m exhaustible let us
[19:04] just read this very well-known piece
[19:06] here I chapter 3 and verse 11 and John
[19:10] says I indeed baptize you with water
[19:12] unto repentance but he that cometh after
[19:15] me is mightier than I whose shoes I am
[19:18] not worthy to bear he shall baptize you
[19:21] with the Holy Ghost on what firemen
[19:25] responders in his hand and he will
[19:27] prolly purge his floor and gather his
[19:30] wheat into the garner but he will burn
[19:33] up the chaff with unquenchable fire then
[19:36] cometh Jesus on to Galilee to Jordan on
[19:39] to John to be baptized of him but John
[19:42] forbid him saying I have need to be
[19:45] baptized of me
[19:46] come on start to me and Jesus answering
[19:48] said unto him suffer it to be so for
[19:52] thus it becometh us to fulfill all
[19:55] righteousness then he suffered them on
[19:57] Jesus when he was baptized went up
[20:00] straightway under the water I know the
[20:04] heavens were opened unto him and he saw
[20:07] the spread of God descending like a dome
[20:09] I'm leading opponent I love a voice from
[20:12] heaven saying this is my beloved Son in
[20:15] whom I am well pleased or at him i'm
[20:17] pleased to dwell then was Jesus led of
[20:20] the Spirit end of the wilderness to be
[20:23] tempted of the devil a member and I

[41:18] that he vindicates it I don't send her
[41:20] the whole church uh we were looking at
[41:23] the first scene and I said to the people
[41:25] now we know brother brother told us what
[41:27] it was that decreased breath I said but
[41:29] what have I asked you to find me a
[41:31] scripture to show me what it was could
[41:33] you do it and of course the great
[41:35] scholars they are they were looking to
[41:36] one another and oil you know I said well

[42:29] that's what's good thing that you'll
[42:30] know this fella he wouldn't identify
[42:32] himself but Jesus Christ all as well
[42:35] right and you know who who is right
[42:37] never reckless you don't have to guess

[50:43] prophet and they're sprint iphone to the
[50:46] word I've you find him amen kicking the
[50:49] devil on and also co nguoi I starting
[50:52] this ministry event right for the SEC
[50:54] game in the spread of God had come upon
[50:56] him before his ministry so that's the
[50:59] reason you can see it's not mean it does
[51:00] the works but the father that dwelleth
[51:02] in many men died in Acts chapter 10 it
[51:06] says that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth
[51:09] with the Holy Ghost I'm with power and
[51:12] he went about doing good and healing all
[51:15] not gonna press I of the devil that is
[51:18] something that our ministers can do
[51:19] hallelujah
[51:21] person wants deliverance there is
[51:23] deliverance there I wouldn't care
[51:25] hallelujah hard the devil would be
[51:26] afflicting you today and you can believe
[51:28] it there's a prayer of faith running the
[51:31] second image yeah I mean that's the Lord
[51:34] older okay that's just going a little
[51:35] bit more a man so the Holy Ghost here
[51:39] anoints to hurt okay then you can't do
[51:42] that I suppose it would be a logical
[51:43] question what are you doing amen what
[51:47] are you doing the profits of the same
[51:48] yeah you see where does the word is it
[51:51] just floating the aether so we're there
[51:52] or what happens to the word a man what
[51:55] happens then I'm gonna tell you what
[51:57] happens then because jesus said and it
[52:00] is expedient that I go from you because
[52:04] if I do not go the comforter can I come
[52:06] right so we see here amen that hat he
[52:10] had to get off the same to let the Holy
[52:13] Ghost come into the bigger picture amen
[52:15] I'm the bigger picture was you and I and
[52:18] Jesus had no wet then the day of
[52:20] Pentecost written of Hoffman right I'm
[52:22] in prison or dead and that's not true
[52:24] night so ah good given vindication to
[52:28] the words that were spoken a man i'm
[52:31] going to show you what that means it's a
[52:33] xanax when the day of Pentecost was
[52:36] fully come they were all with one Accord
[52:38] in one place and suddenly there came a
[52:41] sign from heaven as a mighty rushing
[52:43] wind I have felt on the high steel or
[52:45] sitting I'm there appeared unto them
[52:47] cloven tongues like us fire I have SAT
[52:50] upon each one of them right and they
[52:52] were filled with the holy books in it a

[52:58] a man on this bird give them utterance I
[53:01] notice the pillar of fire I came upon
[53:05] each one hey man 120 pores of fire I
[53:08] believe that will be rain and also all
[53:11] night folks you do not you don't really

[53:15] Catholic people here or I scalping
[53:17] people but i'll tell you what have you
