[0:00] Yes. Oh, the love that drew
[0:03] salvation's
[0:05] plan. Oh, the grace that brought it down
[0:09] to
[0:10] man. Oh, the mighty God that God did

[1:14] Never forget Calvary
[1:17] and what he done that day
[1:20] this
[1:21] morning 2,000 years
[1:24] ago was a empty tomb.
[1:28] We're going to sing that. The tomb now
[1:30] is empty. The stone's been rolled away.
[1:33] Amen. Let's all stand this
[1:38] time. The
[1:40] tomb now is empty.
[1:44] The stones been rolled

[2:01] conquered in
[2:03] me hath no
[2:05] part. For
[2:07] Christ is alive in my heart.
[2:14] heart. The
[2:16] tomb now is
[2:19] empty. The stones been rolled
[2:23] away. And
[2:25] Christ is alive in my heart.
[2:33] and death which is
[2:37] conquered in
[2:39] me hath no
[2:41] part. For
[2:43] Christ is alive in my
[2:48] [Music]
[2:50] heart. The
[2:52] tomb now is
[2:55] empty. The stones been rolled
[2:59] away. And
[3:01] Christ is alive in my
[3:05] [Music]
[3:08] heart. And death which is
[3:12] conquered in
[3:14] me hath no
[3:17] part. For
[3:19] Christ is alive in my heart.
[3:29] Good morning. We thank God for coming.
[3:32] We thank God for giving his only
[3:34] begotten son that whosoever believe in
[3:37] him should not perish but have
[3:39] everlasting life. So this morning let us
[3:43] surrender our eye all unto him. Amen.
[3:47] And walk forth.
[3:49] Amen. We're going to read this morning
[3:51] from Psalm 62:es 1-2.
[3:56] Amen.
[3:58] Let us pray.
[4:00] Heavenly Father, we are ever grateful
[4:01] and thankful for all that you have done
[4:03] for us. Lord, your willingness to give
[4:05] your only begotten son that we all may
[4:08] have eternal life. Lord, we ask you to
[4:11] bless our hearts. Father, let us be
[4:14] surrendered unto you for what we have
[4:16] need. Oh God, let us reach out to you.
[4:19] Lord, you promise you would give it to
[4:20] us. God, we thank you. Wherever we are,
[4:23] whatever we do, let us hold fast to you.
[4:26] In Jesus name we pray.
[4:41] Amen. Psalm 62
[4:44] verse
[4:47] 1-2. My
[4:49] soul wait upon God. From
[4:52] him cometh my salvation.
[4:57] is my rock and my salvation. He is my
[5:00] defense. I shall not be greatly moved.
[5:05] How long will ye imagine mischief
[5:07] against the man? Ye shall be slain all
[5:11] of you as a bro wall shall ye be and as
[5:16] a toing
[5:18] fence to cast him down from his
[5:21] excellency. They delight in they bless
[5:25] their
[5:27] mouths inwardly.
[5:30] My soul thou only upon my soul wait thou
[5:36] only upon God for my expectation is from
[5:39] him.
[5:40] He only is my rock and my salvation. He
[5:44] is my defense. I shall not be moved. In
[5:48] God is my salvation and my glory. the
[5:51] rock of my strength and my refuge is in
[5:54] God.
[5:56] Trust in him at all times to the people.
[5:59] Pour out your heart before him. God is a
[6:03] refuge for us.
[6:06] Surely men of low degree are vanity and
[6:09] men of high degree are a lie. To be laid
[6:13] in the balance, they are all together
[6:16] lighter than vanity.
[6:18] Trust not in oppression and become not
[6:21] vain in robbery. If riches increase,
[6:25] send not your heart on them. God has
[6:28] spoken once, twice have I heard this,
[6:32] that power belongth unto God.
[6:36] Also unto thee, oh God, belongth thy
[6:40] mercy, and thou render to every man
[6:44] according to his word.
[6:47] God bless you.
[7:06] Amen.
[7:09] This time we're going to worship the
[7:11] Lord and tithes and offerings. And
[7:13] Brother Kern, you mind helping us this

[7:58] bring something in your message this
[8:00] morning to help them Lord be overcomers.
[8:02] And we can't forget those Lord Father
[8:04] who are deciding Lord trying to figure

[9:49] [Music]
[10:00] There is a
[10:03] candle in every soul.
[10:07] Some brightly
[10:09] burning, some dark and
[10:13] cold. There is a
[10:16] spirit who brings a
[10:19] [Music]
[10:20] fire, ignites a
[10:23] candle and makes his
[10:27] home. Carry your
[10:30] candle. Run to the darkness.
[10:34] Seek out the
[10:37] hopeless, confused and
[10:40] torn. Hold out your
[10:43] candle for all to see it. Take your
[10:50] candle. Go light your
[10:54] world. Take your
[10:57] candle. Go light your world.
[11:02] frustrated
[11:04] brother. See how he's tried to light his
[11:09] own
[11:11] candle some other
[11:14] way. See now your
[11:17] sister. She's been robbed and lied to
[11:22] still holds a
[11:25] candle without a flame.
[11:29] Carry your
[11:31] candle. Run to the
[11:35] darkness. Seek out the
[11:38] lonely, the tired and
[11:41] worn. Hold out your
[11:45] candle for all to see it. Take your
[11:52] candle. Go light your world.
[11:56] Take your
[11:58] candle. Go light your
[12:02] world. We are a
[12:05] family whose hearts are
[12:08] blazing. So let's raise our
[12:12] candles and light up the
[12:15] sky. Praying to our
[12:18] father. In the name of
[12:22] Jesus, make us a
[12:25] beacon in darkest
[12:29] times. Carry your
[12:32] candle. Run to the
[12:35] darkness. Seek out the
[12:39] helpless, deceived, and
[12:42] poor. Hold out your
[12:45] candle for all to see.
[12:50] Take your
[12:52] candle. Go light your
[12:55] world. Take your
[12:59] candle. Go light your
[13:02] world. Carry your
[13:05] candle unto the
[13:09] darkness. Seek out the
[13:12] helpless, diffused and torn.
[13:16] Hold out your
[13:19] candle for all to see it. Take your
[13:25] candle. Go light your
[13:28] world. Take your
[13:32] candle. Go light your
[13:35] world. Take your
[13:38] candle. Go light your world.
[13:49] Hallelujah.
[13:58] Amen. Amen. Brother Bram said, "Go tell
[14:01] if you don't have anything else to say,
[14:02] go tell them how your candle got lit."
[14:05] You know, if you've got your candle lit,
[14:07] it's easier to light somebody else's
[14:08] candle. God can use your light to light
[14:11] somebody else's candle.
[14:15] Amen. Pastor Zoe here.
[14:44] [Music]
[14:51] Who taught the
[14:53] sun to stand in the
[14:58] morning? Who taught the ocean? You can
[15:02] only come this
[15:07] far. And who showed the
[15:11] moon where to hide till
[15:14] evening? Whose words alone can catch a
[15:19] falling
[15:22] star. I
[15:24] know my
[15:27] redeemer lives.
[15:31] I know my
[15:35] redeemer
[15:37] lives. All of
[15:40] creation
[15:42] testifies. Let this life within me cry.
[15:46] I
[15:48] know my redeemer lives.
[15:54] The very same God that spins things in
[16:00] orbit. He runs to the weary, the worn,
[16:06] and the
[16:09] weak. And the same gentle
[16:13] hands that hold me when I'm
[16:17] broken, they conquer death to bring me
[16:21] victory.
[16:24] No, I know my
[16:29] redeemer
[16:31] lives. I know my
[16:36] redeemer
[16:39] lives. All of
[16:41] creation
[16:43] testify. Let this life within me cry. I
[16:49] know my
[16:51] redeemer
[16:54] lives. He
[16:57] lives to take away my
[17:02] shame. And he
[17:04] lives forever. I
[17:10] proclaim that the payment of my
[17:13] sin was a precious life he
[17:17] gave and now he's alive and there's an
[17:21] empty
[17:24] grave. I know my
[17:29] redeemer lives.
[17:33] I know my
[17:37] redeemer
[17:39] lives. All of
[17:42] creation
[17:44] testify. Let this life within me cry. I
[17:49] know my redeemer
[17:55] lives. All of
[17:57] creation testify.
[18:00] Let this life within me cry. I
[18:05] know my
[18:07] redeemer lives.
[18:13] Hallelujah.
[18:18] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. All creation
[18:22] testifies to that. Thank the Lord.
[18:30] Amen. Amen.
[18:52] There's no one
[18:54] great amongst us.
[18:58] And we're
[19:01] nothing on our
[19:06] own. And we make
[19:09] mistakes and often
[19:14] slip, just come in flesh and bone.
[19:21] But
[19:21] someday I'll prove
[19:25] just why I
[19:29] say I'm of a
[19:32] special
[19:35] kind. For when
[19:37] he was on the cross,
[19:42] [Music]
[19:45] I was on his mind.
[19:50] [Music]
[19:52] Oh,
[19:54] for he
[19:56] knew me.
[20:01] Yeah, he
[20:03] loved me.
[20:07] [Music]
[20:09] And he whose
[20:12] glory
[20:14] makes the heavens
[20:21] shine. So
[20:28] unworthy of such mercy.
[20:35] [Music]
[20:37] Yet when
[20:38] he was on the cross,
[20:43] [Music]
[20:45] I was on his
[20:49] [Music]
[20:55] mind. A look of love was on his
[21:00] face, the
[21:02] [Music]
[21:04] thorns on his head.
[21:09] head and blood was on that scarlet
[21:15] robe and stained in
[21:18] crimson red.
[21:22] And though his eyes were on the crowd
[21:27] that
[21:29] day and he looked ahead in
[21:35] time for when he was on the
[21:42] cross, you and I was on his
[21:49] mind. Sing it with us.
[21:52] And for he
[21:55] knew me. Oh, he knew me. And yet he
[22:02] loved me. Oh, he loved
[22:07] me. And he whose glory
[22:12] remains the
[22:14] heaven
[22:16] shine. Heaven shine.
[22:20] I'm so unworthy.
[22:25] So
[22:27] unworthy of
[22:29] such mercy
[22:32] of his mercy.
[22:35] [Music]
[22:36] when he was on the
[22:42] cross and I was on his
[22:51] mind and oh he
[22:54] knew me. Oh he knew me and yet
[23:00] he loved me. Yes.
[23:07] And he whose
[23:10] glory makes the
[23:13] heaven shine.
[23:17] Heaven shines.
[23:19] So unworthy.
[23:24] I'm so unworthy.
[23:28] Such mercy.
[23:30] Oh, his mercy.
[23:34] Yet when he was on the
[23:40] cross, you and I was on his mind.
[23:48] When he was on the
[23:54] cross, you and I was on his mind.
[24:06] Hallelujah.
[24:10] Amen. Amen.
[24:12] Amen.
[24:14] Well, let's all stand.
[24:17] Thank God we were in his thinking before
[24:18] the foundation of the world. He thought
[24:21] of us
[24:23] and came take on the sinful flesh, a
[24:26] form of sinful flesh that we could
[24:29] become the righteousness of God. I want
[24:32] to sing this song this morning. One
[24:33] number 80 is
[24:35] 187. Such love, such wondrous love.
[24:38] Before we change order of
[24:40] service, I know brother Collie likes
[24:42] this song. So, we're going to go sing it
[24:44] for brother Collie this
[24:46] morning. He said, "I don't know. I can't
[24:48] remember the name of that song, but he
[24:50] said, I like you singing that song." So,
[24:53] so I had had to go through the list of
[24:55] songs that I sang and he said, "That's
[24:56] it." So, I'll never forget that. So, but
[25:00] I love this song that God should love a
[25:02] sinner such as I. Amen. Let's help
[25:06] sing. That God should love a sinner such
[25:11] as I should yearn to change my sorrow
[25:17] into bliss. No rest till he had plans to
[25:22] bring me nigh. How wonderful is love
[25:26] like
[25:28] this. Such love.
[25:32] Such wonderous love. Such
[25:36] love. Such wonderous love that God
[25:41] should love a sinner such as I. How
[25:46] wonderful is love like
[25:50] this. That Christ should join so freely
[25:55] in the scheme. Although it meant his
[26:00] death on
[26:01] Calvary did ever hear me up by no theme.
[26:08] That love divine that ransom came.
[26:13] Such
[26:14] love. Such wonderous love. Such
[26:20] love. Such wonderous love that God
[26:25] should love a sinner such as I. How
[26:30] wonderful is love like this.
[26:34] That for a willful outcast such as I,
[26:40] the father bled, the savior bled and
[26:44] died.
[26:46] Redemption for a worthless slave to buy.
[26:51] Who long grace
[26:54] [Music]
[26:55] defied? Such
[26:57] love. Such wonderous love. Such
[27:03] love. Such wonderous love that God
[27:08] should love. A sinner such as I. How
[27:13] wonderful is love like
[27:17] this. And now he takes me to his heart a
[27:22] son. They ask me not to fill a servant's
[27:27] place. The far off country wondrings are
[27:32] all done. Wide open are his arms of
[27:38] grace. Such
[27:41] love. Such wonderous love. Such love.
[27:47] Such wonderous love that God should love
[27:53] a sinner such as I. How wonderful is
[27:57] love like
[27:59] this. Such
[28:02] love. Such wonderous love. Such love.
[28:08] Such wonderous love that God should love
[28:14] a sinner such as I. How wonderful is
[28:18] love like this.
[28:24] Amen.
[28:25] [Applause]
[28:27] Amen. Wonderful love. Amen. Y'all ready
[28:30] for the word this morning? Amen. Let's
[28:33] sing. Word of God ever true.
[28:39] Holy
[28:41] words long
[28:44] preserved for our
[28:47] walk in this
[28:49] world. They
[28:51] resound with God's own heart. Oh, let
[28:56] the word of God impart.
[29:01] Words of
[29:02] life, words of
[29:05] hope, give us
[29:07] strength. Help
[29:10] us in this world where we roam. The word
[29:16] of God will guide us
[29:20] home. Word of
[29:23] God, ever
[29:25] true. Changing
[29:27] me, changing you.
[29:31] We have
[29:32] come with open hearts. Oh, let the word
[29:37] of God
[29:40] impart. Holy
[29:43] words of our
[29:45] faith handed
[29:48] down to this
[29:50] age. Came to us through
[29:55] sacrifice. Oh, heed the faithful words
[29:59] of
[30:00] Christ. Holy
[30:02] words preserved for this
[30:05] day for our for all the years in this
[30:09] world. Many men gave their life for this
[30:12] word so that we can hear it today.
[30:16] Let's pray to him today.
[30:20] God, word of God is ever true.
[30:26] Change me. It'll change you. And we have
[30:32] come with open hearts. Oh, let the word
[30:37] of God. Sing it to him
[30:39] again. Oh, word of
[30:41] God is ever
[30:44] true. Changing
[30:47] me, changing you. Oh, we have
[30:51] come with open
[30:54] hearts. Oh, let the word of God
[30:59] impart. Amen. God bless you. Turn around
[31:01] and shake somebody's hand. Say, "Happy
[31:03] resurrection day. The sun is
[31:07] up. He's walking around. Something
[31:09] happened and never happened before."
[31:11] There was a
[31:13] man raised from the
[31:16] deadl. And it wasn't
[31:18] like Lazarus. This man will never die
[31:21] anymore.
[31:23] He's alive forever more.
[31:27] We worship him.
[31:30] Good to have each and every one of you.
[31:31] Bless you in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[31:33] You may be seated for a minute and I'll
[31:34] go ahead and make some of these
[31:35] announcements and and all that way we
[31:37] don't have to stand up so much. Uh we're
[31:39] going to uh kind of deviate a little bit
[31:42] from the the sermons we've been bringing
[31:44] on the third poll and and may be strange
[31:47] to some people but but uh it's just all
[31:50] about Jesus Christ. There's really
[31:52] nothing else. Amen. What Paul said, what
[31:55] can we preach
[31:57] except Jesus and him crucified. That's
[31:59] all we can preach. Everything comes from
[32:02] the resurrection.
[32:04] And the proof of the resurre proved who
[32:06] he was. The prophet of God said when he
[32:08] came out of that grave
[32:12] he he fought it out at at Gethsemane.
[32:16] Died resurrected for your justification.
[32:20] He resurrected so you and I can have
[32:23] eternal life if you'll accept it today.
[32:27] Good to be in the house of the Lord.
[32:29] Good to have um I don't think anybody's
[32:31] a visitor here today. Uh but good to
[32:33] have each and everyone. Good to have
[32:35] Olivia and Dalton with us today. Good to
[32:37] see you guys. Appreciate you. And I
[32:39] think there's nobody else. I think
[32:41] there's I think there's a a couple that
[32:43] that had a
[32:45] um they had an anniversary not too long
[32:48] ago. And I always try to look back on
[32:50] anniversaries, Brother Jim, and I look
[32:52] at myself. That's what you're going to
[32:54] look like when you when you come back in
[32:56] this world with that new body, right? We
[33:00] know it's not a new We know it's not a
[33:01] new one hanging up. It's a new one being
[33:03] formed in here. We know that. But on
[33:05] that wedding day, you were at your best.
[33:09] Your wife was at their best. You were
[33:11] standing there. And this is what you
[33:14] look like. So Anderson, brother, pull
[33:17] this up for a second. I want to show
[33:18] you.
[33:24] That's what she going to look like when
[33:26] y'all come back.
[33:28] Brother Alvaro and Sister Emma
[33:31] Senior had a wedding anniversary not too
[33:33] long ago. Now put the other one up.
[33:35] That's what they look like now. But
[33:37] that's what they're going to look like
[33:39] come resurrection morning when the
[33:41] change of the body comes. That's what
[33:43] our hope is. It's not a hope. It's a
[33:46] shity.
[33:48] It's not something we have to guess it's
[33:50] going to happen. We know it's going to
[33:52] happen. Amen. Amen. If not, then we need
[33:55] to just eat, drink, and be merry and
[33:57] just do like the rest of the world.
[33:58] We'll die, go away, and fade out of
[34:01] here. But no, sir, this life just just
[34:04] starts your new life by the new birth.
[34:08] You started a little bit on this side,
[34:10] and it'll take you to the other side.
[34:13] Amen. Good to be in the house of the
[34:15] Lord. But yeah, I thought when I saw
[34:16] that yesterday, I thought I'll put that
[34:18] up there as a uh as a tribute to you for
[34:21] coming and we appreciate them coming all
[34:23] the way from from Arizona and uh and
[34:25] sharing their uh daughter with us and
[34:28] family. So, uh but I wanted to show that
[34:30] to show that that's the youth that we're
[34:33] going to see. We're never going to be
[34:35] old again. When Jesus came out of that
[34:37] tomb, he wasn't 30ome years old. He
[34:40] didn't look like he was 50. He was in
[34:42] the prime of life. Amen. My God doesn't
[34:45] look like a 90 year old man that's about
[34:47] broke down and can't hardly move.
[34:51] My God's 20 years old. My Oh, Jim's
[34:56] dad's here today and he's 92. So, oh,
[34:59] good to have him with us.
[35:05] But, you know, we were talking, Brother
[35:07] Joe and I, different ones. Every year
[35:10] something comes up and you have to go to
[35:11] the doctor. So, just
[35:13] And that's not the way it was supposed
[35:14] to be.
[35:17] Today we're going to
[35:18] speak kind of a little bit out of the
[35:21] normal, but brother
[35:24] Donnie, you might enjoy this
[35:27] title. Pulled it up
[35:29] there. I preached this sermon a long,
[35:31] long time ago, and it means more now to
[35:33] me than ever before.
[35:39] It started before the foundation of the
[35:41] world. Amen. It came to Calvary and
[35:45] died. But he's building that body now.
[35:50] A body thou Jesus has prepared me way
[35:54] down.
[35:56] A body incorruptible.
[35:59] If we have any other hope, we better put
[36:01] our hope in that. That we're not going
[36:04] to get older when we go to eternity.
[36:06] that we're going to be young and
[36:08] beautiful, prime of life, live for an
[36:11] eternity,
[36:13] never see a doctor again. Praise the
[36:15] Lord. Never see Mondays again or the
[36:17] income tax people. Hallelujah. That's
[36:20] good enough for me right there.
[36:25] But just remember, Brother Luis, he's in
[36:27] Honduras and uh and his safe journey
[36:31] back on Tuesday. We appreciate Brother
[36:33] Luis doing work down there. We
[36:35] appreciate him. so much. Brother Chris
[36:37] Long will be here. Remember, we got
[36:39] service Saturday at 3:00 and we have a
[36:43] meal. And I don't I want to say
[36:45] something real quick. I don't want I
[36:46] don't want to make you mad, but but it's
[36:49] probably going to and it's not my fault,
[36:50] it's yours. Amen. Thank you. Praise the
[36:52] Lord. That's why I like people sitting
[36:54] up here say amen. When we give these
[36:56] announcements out, look at the
[36:59] dates. Don't look at anything. Look at
[37:02] the dates. Dates don't change.
[37:07] ever.
[37:09] We may change, but dates don't change.
[37:12] So, look at the dates. The date will
[37:14] tell you when we're having these uh
[37:16] special meetings and special meals, and
[37:18] you won't get confused. But just look at
[37:20] the date. Don't even worry about me
[37:22] saying it. Just look at the date. It's
[37:25] on It's online. It's on Brother Joe
[37:27] graciously puts it on WhatsApp. Um and
[37:29] it's there for us as our information.
[37:31] It'll I don't want it to be confusing. I
[37:34] really don't. I want us to have a
[37:36] wonderful time in the Lord. Uh this
[37:38] Wednesday I'll be speaking. We're
[37:39] leaving uh next week going to a pastor's
[37:43] retreat. Me and Sister June. So, Brother
[37:46] Bob will be speaking this the next
[37:48] Wednesday, the 30th. See there? Put a
[37:50] date on it. The
[37:52] 30th. And then remember, we will then we
[37:55] will then get home on Thursday, Friday
[37:57] morning. We're leaving for Jamaica.
[37:59] We'll be there till Tuesday or Monday in
[38:01] the evening. and brother Donaldo
[38:03] Bautista will be here that Sunday for
[38:07] regular ser that's May the 4th. See
[38:09] there you put those in makes it clear
[38:11] that's May the 4th. All right so
[38:14] remember that I got to put a prayer
[38:16] cloth here to pray for somebody as we
[38:19] speak the word Easter. I want to say
[38:22] this just for a few minutes. We I was
[38:24] milling over it yesterday and and you
[38:27] know the prophet of God tells us and we
[38:29] see
[38:31] that Jesus fought it out not at Calvary
[38:36] cuz at Calvary he was done.
[38:40] He fought it out in the garden. Right.
[38:43] When he went to that garden, there were
[38:44] two wills.
[38:48] Not my will, but thy will be done. He
[38:53] submitted his will. There was a junction
[38:56] of time,
[38:58] right? That even being the son of God,
[39:00] the almighty trapped in the body of
[39:03] flesh, he had to make a choice.
[39:07] He could have made this choice. He loved
[39:09] his disciples. He loved the He loved
[39:10] some of the people of the world because
[39:12] he said he did. He said he even loved
[39:14] Judas cuz he called him friend.
[39:17] But there was a will that overtook all
[39:19] that. And there was when he sealed that
[39:23] in the
[39:25] garden. That was it. He couldn't change
[39:28] his mind even though it hurt. And I
[39:31] appreciate Brother Boyd. If y'all have
[39:32] not seen that, I'll send it to you. He
[39:34] um uh sent me the the steps at what
[39:36] happened to Jesus's body during the time
[39:39] of Calvary. Don't think you've ever had
[39:41] a bad day if you read that. Amen. And he
[39:45] hung there for three hours almost to
[39:48] give his life for me and you. Don't ever
[39:50] forget that.
[39:52] But Easter's
[39:54] origin, we know that it started with
[39:58] paganism.
[40:00] Everybody with me? Don't get don't get
[40:01] quiet. Right. The name Easter is derived
[40:04] from the Anglo-Saxon goddess Ator or
[40:08] Estray, associated with spring and
[40:10] fertility. That's where they get eggs
[40:11] and rabbits. For those of us that are
[40:13] older, we know what eggs and
[40:16] rabbits they produce and they make
[40:19] life. But when the Old Testament during
[40:23] the Old Testament time, remember they
[40:25] had to get Jesus off the
[40:27] cross on Friday at 6:00 before 6:00. Now
[40:31] remember, their days are from 6:00 p.m.
[40:35] to AM. Is everybody with me? Or 6:00 to
[40:38] 6, 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. It's not like
[40:40] our days go to midnight and then that
[40:42] starts a new day. Our their day started
[40:44] at 6:00 on Friday. They had to get him
[40:47] off that cross at before
[40:49] 6:00 because the next day was the
[40:52] Sabbath, Saturday, which became a high
[40:55] Sabbath because it was the Passover and
[40:58] it happened on Saturday. Everybody with
[41:01] me? So they had to get him off or they
[41:03] had to leave him up there for three day
[41:04] or you know until till Monday. Everybody
[41:07] with me? And they had their festivals
[41:09] and their all that going on. So the
[41:12] Passover was there. And the Old
[41:14] Testament remember Saturday was when the
[41:17] Sabbath was instituted, right? All
[41:19] right. God worked six days, rested the
[41:22] seventh. But you got to remember the
[41:25] seventh day was not Sunday.
[41:29] Seventh day was Saturday. Sunday is the
[41:32] first day of the week according to the
[41:33] Bible and according to your calendar.
[41:34] You look on it, you can see Sunday is
[41:35] the first day of the week.
[41:38] So in the New Testament though, the
[41:41] disciples never celebrated an Easter
[41:45] until the second century. I'm reading
[41:47] this off of several um interviews that
[41:50] we've had I had with different people
[41:52] that that prove this fact that disciples
[41:55] because remember they met on Sunday to
[41:59] commemorate the resurrection
[42:02] that's why we do that's why the old
[42:04] testament had to be done away with the
[42:06] old testament sabbath
[42:09] Saturday to where now that we have a
[42:11] resurrection every day Sunday I mean
[42:14] Sunday every Sunday we come to church
[42:16] for a resurre resurrection.
[42:18] Everybody with me? Amen. So, but it is
[42:21] tied to fertility and all this other
[42:23] stuff. And the reason I'm telling you
[42:25] this is because when we get started,
[42:27] we're going to see in every situation
[42:30] when God hits the earth, Satan hits the
[42:32] earth, too. There's always a set of
[42:35] twins. There's always two opposing
[42:37] forces. There's always two spirits
[42:39] working. even in the framework of this
[42:42] church.
[42:43] If you're not born again today, you are
[42:45] of another spirit. Now, you may be
[42:47] wanting to or you may be on your journey
[42:49] to, but you are of another spirit.
[42:53] And we'll talk about it here in just a
[42:55] little while. So, let's stand to our
[42:56] feet. God bless you. Thank you for all
[42:58] of you being here
[42:59] today. I want to just kind of give you
[43:02] that that that
[43:04] Easter is celebrated. We understand and
[43:07] know. We know why. But the world has
[43:09] turned it into just like Christmas and
[43:11] all the other pagan holidays has turned
[43:13] it into what? Moneym scheme. Right.
[43:17] Amen.
[43:19] Eggs,
[43:21] rabbits,
[43:23] chickens. You ought to seen I don't know
[43:25] how many people ordered chickens online
[43:27] and we had to deliver them because the
[43:28] post office still delivers live
[43:31] animals. Not a cat or a dog, but small
[43:35] animals. So, we've delivered many, many
[43:38] um chicklets this past couple of weeks.
[43:41] So, but that's what the world's turned
[43:43] it into. We know it was the death,
[43:45] burial, and resurrection of our Lord
[43:47] Jesus. And then we become in newness of
[43:50] life when you get born again. Yes, sir.
[43:55] So, we're going to just for a moment, a
[43:57] body hast thou prepared me? Let's go to
[44:00] Hebrews 10 verse
[44:01] one. You say, "What has this got to do
[44:03] with the resurrection and Easter?" Well,
[44:06] if you'll hang on a little bit and and
[44:09] you can take a nap in between, but kind
[44:10] of stay awake for the end. Hebrews 10:1,
[44:14] for the law having a shadow, now watch,
[44:16] for the law having a shadow of good
[44:18] things to come. Remember Jesus Christ
[44:20] came under the law.
[44:22] Everybody with me? The law didn't end
[44:24] until the day of Pentecost on 120 in the
[44:28] upper room when Jesus said, "This is a
[44:30] new testament in my blood. It's going to
[44:32] be a new commandment that it's not going
[44:34] to be the blood of an animal anymore.
[44:36] It's going to be the blood of a man. And
[44:38] this man was Jesus Christ.
[44:41] But the law having a shadow of good
[44:42] things to come. You can't do away with
[44:45] the Old Testament.
[44:46] The Old Testament is just as much mine
[44:48] as the New Testament is. Because you
[44:50] know what Paul did? Paul sat down one
[44:52] day for three years. He didn't have a
[44:55] quote book. He didn't have a New
[44:57] Testament. He didn't have a Bible. All
[44:59] he had was a pen and a piece of paper.
[45:01] And he took the Old Testament and by the
[45:03] Holy Ghost wrote 80% of the New
[45:06] Testament for us to enjoy today.
[45:10] And this is actually him saying this in
[45:13] the book of Hebrews. For the law having
[45:15] a shadow of good things to come and not
[45:17] the very image of the things can never
[45:19] with those sacrifices which they offered
[45:22] year by year continually make the comers
[45:25] there too perfect. In other words, come
[45:27] up every year, come up to the Passover
[45:29] or whatever it is. Uh, then you you put
[45:31] your lamb up there, you know, you put
[45:32] your head on the lamb, the lamb dies,
[45:34] you walk away. If you were a liar,
[45:36] you're still a liar.
[45:39] If you're an adulterer, you're still But
[45:40] your sin though was at that point was
[45:42] covered until the next year. But there
[45:45] had to be another sacrifice made the
[45:48] next year. But we know that didn't when
[45:51] Jesus died, one sacrifice, he died once
[45:54] for all. We don't have to do that
[45:55] anymore. All we have to do is sacrifice
[45:58] our life.
[46:01] Can never with those sacrifices which
[46:03] they offered year by year continually
[46:04] made the comers or the people that come
[46:07] there into perfect. For then would they
[46:09] not have ceased to be offered. He's
[46:11] asking a question. Because that the
[46:13] worshipper once
[46:15] purged should have no more conscious of
[46:18] sins. Amen. But in these sacrifices
[46:21] there's a remembrance again made of sin.
[46:23] Every year they had to sit down. They
[46:24] had to get a calendar out and they had
[46:26] to know what day that they go to the
[46:27] temple, what was their time to go and if
[46:29] they had this and if they had two turtle
[46:31] doves and if they had a lamb, they had
[46:33] to put all that up and it was just
[46:34] ritual back and forth. But it did
[46:36] nothing to make them eternal. It did
[46:39] nothing to make them Christians because
[46:41] the only way you can be Christian is to
[46:42] be Christlike and have Christ inside of
[46:44] you. Okay, everybody with me? For it is
[46:48] not possible that the blood of bulls and
[46:50] of goats should take away sins.
[46:52] Wherefore, when he cometh into the
[46:53] world, who's he? Jesus Christ. He say,
[46:56] "Sacrifice and offerings, thou wouldest
[46:58] not, but a body hast thou prepared me?
[47:02] In burnt offerings and sacrifices for
[47:04] sin, thou has no
[47:07] pleasure." Jehovah said one time, he
[47:09] said, "It's just a stink in my nostrils.
[47:11] But it's something I'm going to have to
[47:13] do because I can't look at you with
[47:17] eyeball to eyeball. There's got to be a
[47:19] substitute between me and you." Amen.
[47:22] Everybody with me? Because remember,
[47:24] before he saw Adam in the garden, he
[47:27] killed a lamb, threw the skins in, they
[47:29] put them on, then they walked out.
[47:32] So, there has to be a law of
[47:34] substitution. There had to be a
[47:35] substitution because a God is a holy God
[47:38] and we're filth. Amen. But there's a
[47:41] substitute that came in between that
[47:42] that made us to where we could come
[47:44] before God. Now, we can come boldly.
[47:46] Back then, you couldn't go to the Holy
[47:48] of Holies. Amen.
[47:50] Wherefore when he cometh unto the world,
[47:52] he says, sacrifice and offerings I
[47:53] wouldest not, but a body hast thou
[47:55] prepared me. And burnt offerings and
[47:57] sacrifices for sin thou hast no
[47:59] pleasure. Then said I, lo, I come, the
[48:02] volume of the book, it is written of me
[48:06] to do thy will, oh God. You may be
[48:10] seeing the Lord that is blessing, but
[48:11] you got to start somewhere. That's
[48:13] right. This is where that Paul gets what
[48:18] he just said. This is where he gets it
[48:20] from. Psalms
[48:22] 40:6. Sacrifice and offerings thou
[48:25] didest not desire. Mine ears hast thou
[48:28] opened. Burnt offerings and sin
[48:29] offerings hast thou not required. And
[48:32] that that word means ask
[48:35] for. Then said I lo I come. And the
[48:38] volume the writings are the record book
[48:41] of God. It is written are recorded of
[48:44] me. Now, every one of us today, I
[48:47] delight to do thy will, oh my God. Yay,
[48:50] thy law is within my heart. Every one of
[48:53] you sitting here today, you're a book.
[48:56] You are a book. Remember the old saying,
[48:59] I can read you like a
[49:02] And then it said, don't judge the book
[49:03] by its cover. Well, you can start there.
[49:08] Everybody with me? But we're all a book.
[49:10] were written epistles. Something has
[49:12] been written about you. You just got to
[49:15] find it in the Bible. You're either a
[49:17] sinner or a saint. One of the two.
[49:20] There's a Listen, for those of you that
[49:22] don't come here a lot, there's two
[49:25] opposing forces. Oh yeah. It's a good
[49:27] one and a bad one. There ain't no in
[49:29] between. There ain't no gray area in
[49:31] God. No, sir. You're either born again
[49:33] and going to heaven, or you're not born
[49:35] again, you're going to hell. I'm sorry.
[49:37] That's just the way it is. And I didn't
[49:39] write the book. He did. So you argue
[49:41] with him. Don't argue with me. Argue
[49:42] with him. But there is a way out. It is
[49:45] so simple that people Hallelujah. Amen.
[49:48] They wrestle at it when all you got to
[49:51] do is is through your mouth let your
[49:54] book open up and speak and say, "I am
[49:56] sorry, God. I didn't mean to do that."
[49:59] That's right. And mean it from your
[50:01] heart. Mean it from the core of that
[50:04] book, not just from lip service. That's
[50:07] right. Many people, as I've said many
[50:10] times before, many people are sorry they
[50:13] got caught. They're not sorry that
[50:14] they're sorry.
[50:18] That's why people go to jail and they
[50:19] get Jesus in jail. Come on, somebody.
[50:23] But now, some come out with him, some
[50:25] come out and left him in there.
[50:28] But if you and I get born again, he'll
[50:31] never leave you or forsake you. You
[50:33] can't outrun God.
[50:36] Hallelujah. You can never outrun God.
[50:39] You can run as long as you want to, but
[50:40] there's going to be one time he's going
[50:42] to say, "Make a choice, big boy. Make a
[50:45] choice, girl. You better make it now."
[50:48] So now, let's let's see where all this
[50:51] If a body's been prepared by the Lord
[50:56] himself, and we're part of his body,
[50:59] being the bride of Christ. Is everybody
[51:00] with me? Amen. Amen. We got to go where
[51:03] to find where that body started and why
[51:05] it had to come to Calvary.
[51:09] Everybody with me? So Genesis 1:26, the
[51:12] second the first favorite scripture in
[51:15] the Bible for me. And then the other one
[51:17] is the body hast thou prepared me? So in
[51:19] Genesis 1:26, "And God said, let us make
[51:23] man in our own image and after our
[51:25] likeness." Now Joshua is sitting back
[51:27] there today and whether he likes it or
[51:28] not, he was made in my image.
[51:34] He may not act like me, but he looks
[51:36] like me. Why? He's my progeny. He's my
[51:40] genetic makeup. Whatever I have inside
[51:43] of me as a genetic strand, he's got
[51:46] parts of it. Everybody with me?
[51:49] So when God said, "Let us make man," he
[51:51] ain't talking about all mankind. God is
[51:54] not in every individual in the world.
[51:57] He has a group of people that is his
[51:59] children, his progeny. Yes, sir. That
[52:03] has come forth from him and was going to
[52:06] come forth from him. Let me make a
[52:08] statement real quick. God always wanted
[52:10] to live in human flesh. Amen.
[52:16] But so did the devil.
[52:18] Twins.
[52:20] So did the devil.
[52:22] Why do you think he got in the beast and
[52:23] did what he did with Eve? wanted to
[52:25] interject himself into flesh of a human
[52:28] race. Cuz Satan can't create. He only
[52:32] perverts. God created Adam.
[52:37] Amen. In his own image. But remember
[52:39] when we talk about that
[52:42] person that was a spirit first. Yes.
[52:46] With me? Those of you been here a long
[52:47] time, you'll know that. You know this.
[52:49] Dad's preached on this for 50 years, 40
[52:50] years.
[52:52] Let them have dominion over the fish of
[52:54] the sea and over the fowl of the air and
[52:55] over the cattle and over all the earth.
[52:58] Now, that can't be the devil's kids.
[53:01] That's only the children of God that he
[53:03] has given them authority over the earth.
[53:07] Everybody with me? All right. So, now
[53:10] there's going to be though a time where
[53:12] there's going to be a drift off to one
[53:13] side, and we'll get to in just a second.
[53:15] Oh, I said here, I had a Let me tell you
[53:17] something. Thursday night, I had a
[53:20] Gethsemane.
[53:22] Praise the Lord. And I'm sorry. I've
[53:24] been dilatory and I've not studied like
[53:26] I should and brought the word like I
[53:28] should. And I apologize for that. But
[53:30] when I got Thursday night finished, he
[53:32] won. Amen. He won. I didn't win. He won.
[53:37] You ought to all have a Gethsemane. You
[53:39] got to get down and have shed your tears
[53:42] of blood and say, "Not my will, Lord,
[53:45] but thy will be done." We're human. and
[53:47] I want to go do things. I want to go do
[53:49] stuff.
[53:50] Come on, brother. But no, Paul was a
[53:54] prisoner of Christ. He wasn't a prisoner
[53:56] in a dungeon somewhere. He was a
[53:58] prisoner of Christ. That's what put him
[54:00] in the natural dungeon. Amen.
[54:04] So remember, there's two forces and
[54:05] that's it. There's God and there's
[54:07] Satan. That's right. And they both want
[54:11] the same thing, but in a different way.
[54:14] Amen.
[54:16] He wants his kingdom. He's got it
[54:20] temporarily.
[54:22] Amen. But we're a kingdom of eternity.
[54:25] Yes, sir. We're a king of We're a
[54:27] kingdom of the most high. We are his
[54:29] children. Amen. We are his offspring.
[54:31] And he has given us rulership over all
[54:34] the earth. Now, the first earth you got
[54:36] to get rulership over is what? This one.
[54:39] Not my will, but thy will be done.
[54:41] And there is no doubt there has been
[54:43] there was hundreds of thousands of
[54:45] crucifixions. It was starting way before
[54:47] Jesus was even born. And I'm sure in
[54:50] Jesus Jesus's life, brother Bob, he's
[54:52] walked by and looked and
[54:54] saw somebody hanging on the cross,
[54:57] screaming and wailing. It wasn't a new
[54:59] thing, folks. They did it every day.
[55:02] They'd throw them up on the cross,
[55:04] crucify them. they didn't die. They'd
[55:05] break their legs with a with a big old
[55:07] stick and throw them over in a pit.
[55:11] So, no doubt Jesus saw what he was going
[55:14] to. He said, "Not my will, but thy will
[55:18] be done. I'm not doing this for myself.
[55:21] I'm doing it for my children."
[55:24] Because Adam, the first Adam, lost us
[55:27] all.
[55:29] That's right. God had to hold on a
[55:32] minute with his plan. Everybody with me?
[55:34] That's right. How patient is God?
[55:38] For thousands of years, he's been
[55:39] waiting for a body to get here.
[55:43] His plan is perfect. He never had to
[55:45] change it in the middle of it. It's
[55:47] always been the same. That's right. So
[55:49] listen, over the earth and over every
[55:51] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[55:52] earth, everything. So God created man in
[55:56] his own image, and the image of God
[55:58] created he him. Now look, male and
[56:00] female created he them. Amen.
[56:04] Everybody with me on that cuz we're
[56:06] going to get into something just a
[56:07] second that I believe it'll help you.
[56:10] And God blessed them.
[56:14] So in other words, he created a form,
[56:16] but it's in
[56:17] plurality. We know who we are, male and
[56:19] female,
[56:21] right? There's only two. There's not
[56:22] inbetweens and five different degrees of
[56:25] this, and you can do whatever you want
[56:26] to here. And there's all kind of stuff.
[56:28] Well, anyway, whatever. Believe what you
[56:30] want to, but it's cursed. Anything
[56:32] outside this word is cursed. I don't
[56:35] care how smart it sounds. I don't care
[56:37] how good it looks. It's cursed.
[56:40] And God blessed them. Now, how would
[56:42] everybody like to be blessed today where
[56:44] God says, "I have blessed you."
[56:46] Everybody in here should be. If you
[56:48] hadn't, then you're missing the
[56:49] blessing. Amen. I could say, "Bless you
[56:52] today." You could go to the Catholic
[56:53] church and the pope could say, "I bless
[56:55] you today." But when God blesses you,
[56:57] it's for an eternity.
[57:00] And God blessed them. And God said unto
[57:02] them, "Be fruitful and multiply and
[57:04] replenish the earth." Now remember that
[57:05] was before they were put in human flesh.
[57:08] So how was God going to procreate the
[57:10] earth? Cuz remember, brother Jim, he
[57:12] said multiply.
[57:16] How's he going to multiply? Spiritual
[57:18] multiplication.
[57:21] You see what it turned into when the
[57:24] twin come into view, right? It was by
[57:27] sexual desire. Not supposed to been that
[57:30] way. Everybody with me? Don't get quiet.
[57:33] And God blessed him. And God said unto
[57:35] them, he's talking right to him. But
[57:38] guess who's standing there while he's
[57:40] talking?
[57:42] Diablo.
[57:43] The devil.
[57:46] Himself. Yes. Was standing there
[57:49] listening. The prophet of God said he
[57:51] knew the principles of life. Why? He
[57:53] could see the animals procreating.
[57:55] That's right. He's just sitting there
[57:57] waiting. And when God put Adam and Eve
[58:00] in human flesh or put Adam in human
[58:01] flesh and Eve came out, he said, "Right
[58:03] there is my way in."
[58:06] But now remember, God made them first so
[58:09] that he could get in them.
[58:12] Have children spiritually,
[58:15] not by sex desire. All
[58:18] right? And have dominion over the fish
[58:20] of the sea and the foul of the air. He
[58:21] blessed them. Multiply, replenish the
[58:23] earth, and subdue it. and have dominion
[58:26] over the fish of the sea and the foul of
[58:27] the air and over every living thing that
[58:28] moveth upon the
[58:30] earth. Sorry,
[58:33] brother. I have to slow down a little
[58:35] bit. And God said, "Behold, I've given
[58:39] you every herbbearing seed." Now, watch
[58:41] what God says. Now, remember, whether
[58:44] you believe this or not, that's the same
[58:46] God that hung on the cross. That's
[58:47] right. There's not three gods. There's
[58:50] not two different gods. There's not a
[58:52] God and a son. There's a God that became
[58:54] a son. That's right. Well, what a
[58:56] revelation. Amen. God became a son so he
[58:59] could die for me and you. God can't die.
[59:02] That's right. Amen. God's a spirit.
[59:05] Jesus said, he said, "Those that worship
[59:07] him must worship him in spirit and
[59:08] truth." That's right. But there he stood
[59:11] in human flesh. They couldn't understand
[59:13] who he was. Right.
[59:16] Behold, I've given you every herb
[59:18] bearing seed. Somebody called me those
[59:20] asked, "Would we would we eat meat in
[59:21] the millennium?" I No, I don't think so.
[59:23] I think we revert back to what we did in
[59:25] the garden where we didn't eat each
[59:27] other, the
[59:29] animals. We ate of the best fruit you'll
[59:32] ever have in your life. It doesn't have
[59:34] to be sprayed with MSG. It don't have to
[59:35] come from Florida when it's out of
[59:37] season. Everybody with me? It's right
[59:39] there all the time. Whatever your desire
[59:42] is, that's what's going to happen.
[59:45] Amen.
[59:46] To it to you it shall be for meat and to
[59:49] every beast of the earth and every foul
[59:50] of the earth. to everything that
[59:51] creepeth upon the earth, wherein there
[59:53] is life. I have given every green herb
[59:55] for meat, and it was so. Yes. Now look,
[1:00:00] and God saw everything that he had made.
[1:00:03] Now remember, God can't change his mind,
[1:00:05] right? He can't say, "Whoops, I made a
[1:00:07] mistake." In other words, he said, "This
[1:00:10] is my plan. This is the way it's going
[1:00:11] to be because I see the end of this."
[1:00:15] And God saw everything that he had made.
[1:00:17] Now watch. And behold, remember back in
[1:00:21] Genesis 1 2 3 4 5 6, he said, "And it
[1:00:24] was good." He said, "And it was good."
[1:00:28] Made the cattle, and it was good. Now,
[1:00:30] when he got finished making man, he said
[1:00:32] it was very good.
[1:00:35] And the evening and the morning was the
[1:00:36] sixth day. That's why the evening at
[1:00:38] 6:00 starts the Jewish day. Everybody
[1:00:41] with me?
[1:00:42] Okay. But now
[1:00:46] remember God was
[1:00:48] lonely. And when Adam came
[1:00:51] out, he was a ruler of the world. He
[1:00:54] ruled this whole earth in spirit
[1:00:58] form. Everybody with me? Then what did
[1:01:01] he do? He took that man and put him into
[1:01:05] human flesh. Yes, sir. You say, "How can
[1:01:07] that happen?" You need to ask God. He's
[1:01:09] God. I'm not. Okay? God can do whatever
[1:01:11] he wants to do. Yes, sir. He sprinkled
[1:01:13] some dust over him a few years after
[1:01:15] that and became Melzdc.
[1:01:18] So he can do whatever he wants to do.
[1:01:19] But this is his plan. I love it. I want
[1:01:22] to go by it. There's nothing in the
[1:01:24] world I want besides that.
[1:01:27] Cuz listen, let me tell you something. I
[1:01:29] think about yesterday. How many of you
[1:01:32] ever saw
[1:01:35] Job? How many of you ever saw Jesus?
[1:01:39] Isaiah, Jeremiah,
[1:01:42] Moses.
[1:01:44] Oh, you never seen them, have you? You
[1:01:46] have no evidence they ever existed,
[1:01:53] except believe in what the word of God
[1:01:55] says.
[1:01:57] And what does it do? It resonates inside
[1:02:00] from here, not up here.
[1:02:03] Up here, you're wrestled. Down here, you
[1:02:05] won't. Oh, yeah. You may still throw
[1:02:08] something back and forth, but once you
[1:02:09] get it settled in here, that's why I
[1:02:10] know this Bible's right. That's why I
[1:02:12] know the message of God is right. He
[1:02:14] sent us a message, and that message is
[1:02:16] right. Amen.
[1:02:18] Find me a different one that's better.
[1:02:20] I'll listen to it.
[1:02:23] Yeah.
[1:02:25] Garbage. Everything outside of this word
[1:02:28] of God is garbage. We're all garbage
[1:02:30] outside of the word of God.
[1:02:33] Man told me one time, he said, "Why in
[1:02:34] the world did Brother Random call women
[1:02:36] dog meat?" I said, "Brother, you're dog
[1:02:38] meat."
[1:02:41] Brother, I'm dog meat. Until I'm born
[1:02:42] again, I was dog meat. Until you were
[1:02:45] born again, you're dog meat. That's
[1:02:47] right. Cannon fire. You say, "I don't
[1:02:50] believe that." See, you become an
[1:02:51] unbeliever when you say, "I don't
[1:02:52] believe."
[1:02:54] You immediately become an unbeliever
[1:02:56] when you say, "I don't believe that."
[1:02:57] Right now, if you're a believer and
[1:02:59] something's in error and you say, "I
[1:03:01] don't believe that." That shows where
[1:03:03] you got the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:06] Cuz we'll look at something in just a
[1:03:07] few minutes if we get to it. Now, maybe
[1:03:08] a little long today, but you ain't got
[1:03:10] nothing else to do. You might get a
[1:03:12] little bit, but that'll keep you
[1:03:14] awake. If your neighbor's belly sounds
[1:03:18] loud, you'll stay awake,
[1:03:20] maybe. But now listen. So, what did God
[1:03:24] do? He began to start his family.
[1:03:29] Genesis is a C chapter. All right. He
[1:03:32] started his family in Genesis, remember?
[1:03:35] The way he wanted it started because God
[1:03:38] don't make a mistake.
[1:03:40] You with me?
[1:03:42] Adam put Adam in flesh. But now once he
[1:03:45] put Adam in flesh, now watch. And the
[1:03:48] Lord God formed man of the dust of the
[1:03:51] ground. In other words, 16
[1:03:53] elements and breathe into his nostrils a
[1:03:56] breath of life and man became a living
[1:03:59] soul. Now remember, there was just one
[1:04:02] man, Adam. All right? There was
[1:04:06] something inside of
[1:04:09] him, but was not yet ready to be
[1:04:11] revealed. Everybody with me? Because
[1:04:15] remember, God said, "I'm lonely.
[1:04:22] Adam says, "I'm lonely."
[1:04:24] God was lonely because Adam was inside
[1:04:26] of him.
[1:04:30] Adam was lonely because Eve was inside
[1:04:32] of him. Hallelujah.
[1:04:35] And the Lord God formed man of the dust
[1:04:37] of the ground and breathe into his
[1:04:38] nostrils a breath of life, and he became
[1:04:40] a living salt. And the Lord God planted
[1:04:43] a garden eastward in Eden, and there he
[1:04:45] put the man whom he had formed. All
[1:04:48] right, y'all with me? Hang in here.
[1:04:50] We're getting somewhere. It may take a
[1:04:52] minute. Genesis 2:1 17. Now, he tells
[1:04:56] Adam, and remember, Eve is in Adam in
[1:05:00] theophony. If you don't understand that,
[1:05:03] study it out. Theophony is what? A body
[1:05:07] of God or not flesh. It's a um it's
[1:05:12] actually better than flesh because it's
[1:05:13] it's it's the body of God. God was
[1:05:15] eternal. God was a spirit. But now
[1:05:18] remember that transformation goes over
[1:05:20] from here into a body. So he took Adam
[1:05:22] and put him into a body so that he could
[1:05:25] fellowship with him. Then when he got to
[1:05:28] fellowshipping with Adam, Adam said,
[1:05:29] "Man, I'm
[1:05:31] lonely." Now watch.
[1:05:34] But of the tree of the knowledge of good
[1:05:36] and evil, thou shalt need not eat of it.
[1:05:39] For in the day thou eatest thereof, thou
[1:05:41] shalt surely die. That's pretty
[1:05:43] specific.
[1:05:44] You might. You might. No, you might.
[1:05:46] Know not you might, you will. Yes,
[1:05:48] that's right. You will die. Yes. And the
[1:05:51] Lord God said, "It is not good that the
[1:05:54] man should be alone.
[1:05:56] I will make him and help me for him."
[1:06:00] Now, what did he do? Did he go and
[1:06:01] create another body?
[1:06:05] Did he go create another spirit?
[1:06:08] Hello.
[1:06:12] Because remember, when God formed Adam,
[1:06:14] he didn't create another spirit. It was
[1:06:16] his spirit in another form.
[1:06:19] Everybody with me. It was his spirit in
[1:06:21] another form. Listen, devil's over here
[1:06:23] wondering what in the world's going on.
[1:06:26] I want a part of this. I want in on it.
[1:06:29] And God said, "You stay over there." I'm
[1:06:31] the creator. You can't. You stay over
[1:06:32] there. And the devil's like, "I ain't
[1:06:34] staying over there. I'm going over
[1:06:35] there. I'm gonna figure out how to get
[1:06:37] into that just like he did."
[1:06:39] Right? And out of the
[1:06:41] ground, the Lord God formed every beast
[1:06:43] of the field. Now watch, he's specific.
[1:06:45] When when Oh, how many of y'all believe
[1:06:47] that Moses wrote this first four books
[1:06:48] of the Bible? Five books of the Bible.
[1:06:50] How do you know that?
[1:06:54] How do you know that?
[1:06:57] Prove
[1:06:58] it. It's Jewish
[1:07:01] tradition. Way back. They got the
[1:07:04] scrolls. But just
[1:07:07] like this Bible or just like anything
[1:07:10] else, you can pervert it. You can have
[1:07:13] somebody else write it. That's why if we
[1:07:15] don't put our faith in what God did in
[1:07:18] this Bible,
[1:07:19] we're lost. And listen, we are
[1:07:22] believers. Remember, we what? We believe
[1:07:27] so that we can see. Yes, sir. We don't
[1:07:30] go looking for something so that we can
[1:07:32] believe it afterwards. No, no, no, no,
[1:07:34] no.
[1:07:36] Amen. Amen.
[1:07:39] I met Jesus Thursday night, but he
[1:07:42] wasn't in a corporal body. He was in the
[1:07:45] word of God. And that word of God spoke
[1:07:48] to this word that I am and said, "That
[1:07:50] ain't nothing but the truth." Amen.
[1:07:52] That's what you got to decide today.
[1:07:53] Amen. What is truth? Pilot said, "You
[1:07:55] know why Pilate said that? He didn't
[1:07:57] know the truth." Right? The truth was
[1:07:59] standing right in front of him. He
[1:08:00] didn't know who it was.
[1:08:02] Right. Yes, sir. It's not good man
[1:08:05] should be alone. I will make him a help
[1:08:07] meat. And out of the ground, the Lord
[1:08:08] formed every beast. Now, watch. God is
[1:08:09] saying, "I'm forming every beast out of
[1:08:11] the ground." Amen. I am
[1:08:15] creating animals foul and brought them
[1:08:18] unto Adam to see what he would call
[1:08:20] them. And whatsoever Adam called every
[1:08:21] living creature that was a name thereof.
[1:08:24] There is the
[1:08:26] confidence, brother Carlos.
[1:08:29] That was the confidence God had in his
[1:08:31] son at the time. Right.
[1:08:36] Amen. They didn't this big gray thing
[1:08:38] walk by with a trunk and big old tusk
[1:08:41] and and and Adam says, "That's an
[1:08:43] elephant." And God said, "No, no, no,
[1:08:44] no. That's not what that was." No. You
[1:08:46] know what he did? He said, "That's
[1:08:47] exactly what I was thinking." We had the
[1:08:50] mind of God. He had the mind of God. He
[1:08:53] had the mind of a creator. He was in
[1:08:56] line. But remember, he never was a
[1:08:58] savior. He couldn't be a savior. That's
[1:09:01] why when he did what he did and they got
[1:09:03] cast out of the garden, Adam went with
[1:09:05] Eve because he thought he could save
[1:09:07] her. No, he went with her and found out
[1:09:09] he was lost, too. He's not a savior.
[1:09:13] But the second Adam sure is.
[1:09:16] Cuz that's the body I want to be
[1:09:17] included with. We'll see Adam. We'll see
[1:09:21] Eve, but I want to see Jesus.
[1:09:25] And out of the ground, the Lord God
[1:09:26] formed every beast of the field, brought
[1:09:28] him to Adam. And that was a name and
[1:09:31] that's the way it's been since the dawn
[1:09:32] of time. Yes, sir. And Adam gave names
[1:09:35] to all the cattle and foul of the air
[1:09:36] and every beast of the field. But for
[1:09:38] Adam there was not found and help me for
[1:09:41] him. Adam could look and see female dog,
[1:09:44] male dog, female cat, male cat, female
[1:09:46] this
[1:09:47] lamb, male lamb. Everybody with me?
[1:09:52] And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to
[1:09:54] fall upon Adam. He
[1:09:57] slept. And he took out of his
[1:10:00] ribs, one of his
[1:10:03] ribs, not two.
[1:10:07] He made two eaves. He made one.
[1:10:09] Everybody with me? Okay. And he took one
[1:10:12] of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[1:10:14] instead thereof. What a master
[1:10:18] physician.
[1:10:21] Take take a piece of a man out. Put the
[1:10:25] thing back. close it back up and then
[1:10:27] take that one piece of bone and make
[1:10:29] another human being out of it.
[1:10:32] But remember whose bone was it? Adam's.
[1:10:40] So he did a little surgery. Then he did
[1:10:43] a little creating. He didn't create. He
[1:10:46] used from the creation that he had. And
[1:10:48] the rib which the Lord God had taken
[1:10:50] from man made he a woman and brought her
[1:10:53] unto the man. And Adam said, "Now
[1:10:56] watch. What was the first woman's
[1:10:59] name?"
[1:11:02] Huh?
[1:11:05] H actually she was called woman, but she
[1:11:08] was Adam. We We'll read that in just a
[1:11:09] minute. And Adam said, "This is now bone
[1:11:12] of my bone and flesh of my f flesh."
[1:11:14] Really? That's exactly what they were.
[1:11:16] She shall be called woman or man with a
[1:11:19] womb. All right. because she was taken
[1:11:22] out of man. Therefore shall a man leave
[1:11:25] his father and mother and shall cleave
[1:11:26] unto his wife, and they shall be one
[1:11:28] flesh. And they were both naked, the man
[1:11:30] and his wife, and were not ashamed.
[1:11:32] Walked around the whole time, no clothes
[1:11:33] on because they didn't have a carnal
[1:11:35] mind. Everybody with me? But now
[1:11:38] remember, we're going to see here in
[1:11:39] just a few minutes when we read
[1:11:43] it that her name was Adam. Amen. Now we
[1:11:47] we go on over 6,000 years and we hear
[1:11:51] brother Brandham on I think it's uh
[1:11:53] Christ the mystery or somewhere he says
[1:11:55] she is him. Amen.
[1:11:58] Bone of his bone flesh of his flesh,
[1:12:01] life of his life. She is him. Amen.
[1:12:06] Amen. Eve was Adam in another form.
[1:12:11] You are the bride of Christ in another
[1:12:15] form. Amen.
[1:12:18] You I was listening to a preacher the
[1:12:19] other day and he said, "You know, Eve is
[1:12:20] not a really good name." Cuz Eve,
[1:12:21] brother, you know, the Adam says she's
[1:12:24] the mother of all living. That's why I'm
[1:12:25] going to name her Eve. And that's what
[1:12:26] Eve means. But Eve also means she
[1:12:28] committed adultery.
[1:12:31] She wasn't woman anymore. She wasn't his
[1:12:34] woman
[1:12:34] anymore. Think about
[1:12:38] that. Are we just called Miss Jesus
[1:12:41] Christ or are we Miss Jesus Christ?
[1:12:45] If we are mis Jesus Christ, we will do
[1:12:47] what Jesus did because we have his life
[1:12:49] inside of us.
[1:12:51] And the Lord God said unto the serpent,
[1:12:53] because thou hast done this, thou art
[1:12:54] cursed above all cattle and every beast
[1:12:56] of the field. Upon thy belly shalt thou
[1:12:59] go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days
[1:13:01] of thy life. When he finds out and comes
[1:13:03] to Adam and Eve, he sees now that he
[1:13:05] didn't he
[1:13:07] wasn't
[1:13:09] surprised at all. He knew what was going
[1:13:12] to happen, but he had to make them
[1:13:14] witness what happened.
[1:13:18] What have you done? What he said, Adam,
[1:13:20] what he done? Well, it's my wife. It's
[1:13:22] that woman you gave me. Woman says,
[1:13:23] "What?" He said, "What happened to you?"
[1:13:24] He said, "Well, it's that beast over
[1:13:26] there." Like, brother Rab said it was
[1:13:28] passing the buck passing somebody else's
[1:13:30] fault.
[1:13:31] But God said, "Hold on just a minute. I
[1:13:33] made a covenant and you did not meet
[1:13:37] your end of the covenant."
[1:13:40] Right. Eat of everything but that. Yes.
[1:13:46] So now
[1:13:47] Eve, you believe what you want
[1:13:50] to. You can believe it was an apple if
[1:13:52] you want to. But now Eve was not a
[1:13:54] virgin anymore.
[1:13:56] Her womb was polluted. This one first,
[1:13:59] then the natural one. But see, remember
[1:14:02] Satan has to do it carnally. He cannot
[1:14:05] create.
[1:14:07] So he had to use, excuse my expression,
[1:14:09] he had to use the sperm of a beast
[1:14:12] to inject himself into the human race.
[1:14:14] And and the Lord had already said
[1:14:16] whatever seed brings forth of its kind.
[1:14:18] So he had to give it life. He had to
[1:14:20] give Cain life because he said he did.
[1:14:22] That's right. Everybody with me?
[1:14:26] So remember, God can't dwell in an
[1:14:28] unclean vessel or come through an
[1:14:30] unclean vessel. He was if Eve would have
[1:14:33] waited, Adam and Eve would have been the
[1:14:35] spoken word of God. They would have
[1:14:37] spoke the children into existence
[1:14:40] without sex, without sin, and we just
[1:14:42] lived for an eternity. But God had
[1:14:44] attributes.
[1:14:46] His attribute was a healer. There was
[1:14:47] nothing to heal. God was a savior. We
[1:14:50] know today God what? This is why he did
[1:14:52] it.
[1:14:54] He was a savior, but there was nobody to
[1:14:56] save. But he knew put him on free
[1:14:58] legacy. Say, "Okay, if you do this,
[1:14:59] you're cursed."
[1:15:01] He knew she wasn't going to do it. He
[1:15:03] knew she was going to break that
[1:15:05] covenant. But remember, when God steps
[1:15:07] on a scene and says, "I
[1:15:10] will." You can put money in the bank.
[1:15:13] Amen. Hallelujah. So God after all this
[1:15:17] happens, he knows he
[1:15:18] cannot interject himself into the human
[1:15:21] race like he wants to. Everybody with
[1:15:23] me? Amen. that Genesis 1 man eternal
[1:15:27] life
[1:15:29] and eternal life is a book
[1:15:37] in symbol. We know it wasn't a book that
[1:15:38] they had to read with names in it. I'll
[1:15:42] promise you you stand before the white
[1:15:43] throne judgment there's not going to be
[1:15:44] a great big dusty book opened up and
[1:15:46] they have to find your name.
[1:15:49] No, you're going to know cuz you're the
[1:15:51] one that wrote it. Good or bad.
[1:15:56] Nobody knows you but you and God. Nobody
[1:15:59] knows you but you and God.
[1:16:02] And the devil tries to get in there
[1:16:03] every once in a while. If you don't know
[1:16:05] Jesus, then you are go. You're you're
[1:16:07] the devil's anyway. Now watch. Because
[1:16:10] you have done this. Thou art cursed
[1:16:11] above all cattle. He's separating it.
[1:16:13] Now I can't build this body that I'm
[1:16:17] trying to prepare at this moment.
[1:16:22] Right. told a serpent on your belly you
[1:16:24] shall go. That's why the serpent was not
[1:16:26] a snake before the fall. He was turned
[1:16:28] into a snake. And dust shalt thou eat
[1:16:31] all the days of your life. And I will
[1:16:34] put enmity.
[1:16:37] God said I will put enmity. That word
[1:16:40] enmity means hatred, division or chasm.
[1:16:45] In other words, I hate sin. I can't look
[1:16:48] at you anymore without a substitution,
[1:16:52] without a blood sacrifice. I cannot look
[1:16:54] at you.
[1:16:58] So now, if he made that
[1:17:00] statement, he's got to make a way to get
[1:17:03] back across chasm because of this right
[1:17:05] here.
[1:17:07] And I will put enmity, hatred, division,
[1:17:09] chasm, a great gulf fixed between us and
[1:17:12] God. Right? Between which means among or
[1:17:15] in the midst of thee and the woman and
[1:17:17] between thy seed and her seed. Now
[1:17:19] remember thy seed was the serpent coming
[1:17:23] from the beast interjected into Eve
[1:17:25] brought forth Cain. Everybody with me.
[1:17:27] If you don't understand that, ask
[1:17:29] somebody. They'll talk to you about it.
[1:17:31] And her seed. Now let a woman doesn't
[1:17:33] have a seed. A woman can't get pregnant
[1:17:35] by herself. Right? Oh yeah, they may be
[1:17:39] have this artificial insecination and
[1:17:40] all that stuff, but there still has to
[1:17:42] sperm come from man. Woman cannot make
[1:17:44] sperm. Everybody with me? Sorry about
[1:17:47] that if the kids here, but I'm
[1:17:49] sorry. So there's going to be a
[1:17:51] division, but
[1:17:54] listen, between thy seed and her seed or
[1:17:57] offspring, it shall bruise thy head and
[1:18:00] thou shalt bruise his heel. It it what?
[1:18:03] The seed of the woman. Jesus was the
[1:18:06] seed of the woman. We're gonna get down
[1:18:08] here in just a minute. Mary had zero to
[1:18:10] do with Jesus coming in the womb of of a
[1:18:13] virgin. Zero.
[1:18:17] If there was any connection, that body
[1:18:20] would been human with a carnal mind.
[1:18:24] Are you with me? Cuz every one of you in
[1:18:26] this building right here, I don't care
[1:18:27] who you are, you born the same way. Come
[1:18:29] from the same act. Come through the same
[1:18:31] womb. Not the same womb. You understand?
[1:18:33] Come through the same way. Everybody,
[1:18:36] thank you.
[1:18:38] But it what the seed of the woman shall
[1:18:41] bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise
[1:18:44] his
[1:18:45] heel. Pointing to
[1:18:48] Satan putting him on the cross at
[1:18:50] Calvary. But we remember we're the ones
[1:18:52] that did it. But Satan was the
[1:18:54] instigator. Remember, you had a set of
[1:18:56] twins.
[1:18:57] You had Jesus and Judas, right? You had
[1:18:59] a set of twins. You had Esau and Jacob.
[1:19:03] You had Cain and Abel,
[1:19:06] Jesus and Judas,
[1:19:09] the word and the non-word. We're going
[1:19:11] to look at that in just a few minutes.
[1:19:12] Amen. Cuz remember the original
[1:19:16] material, listen to me now. The original
[1:19:18] material that God wanted was his first
[1:19:21] son.
[1:19:25] Adam, created son, Adam. That's what he
[1:19:28] wanted. That's right. There was no
[1:19:31] sperm. There was no egg. It was just
[1:19:33] Adam.
[1:19:35] That's the way he wanted it. But once
[1:19:36] this happened, he had to come now to
[1:19:39] where he had to come through that womb
[1:19:40] to clean the womb out.
[1:19:42] Everybody with me? Oh, what a perfect
[1:19:45] plan of
[1:19:47] God. And to the woman, he said, "I will
[1:19:51] greatly multiply your sorrow and your
[1:19:53] conception." You sisters know exactly
[1:19:55] what we're talking
[1:19:56] about. I cannot have a baby. I don't
[1:20:00] care what the world says. A man has
[1:20:03] never had a baby.
[1:20:05] Sorry.
[1:20:09] Could say something, but I'm not. In
[1:20:11] sorrow thou shalt bring forth
[1:20:14] children, and thy desire shall be to thy
[1:20:16] husband, and he shall rule over thee.
[1:20:19] Remember, until that time, they were
[1:20:21] equal. She was him.
[1:20:26] She didn't have a name. She was him.
[1:20:33] There I go. And it'd be Eve and one is
[1:20:37] with God. Brother Ram said God looked
[1:20:38] down in the Garden of Eden and there was
[1:20:40] Adam and Eve and he saw one
[1:20:44] because remember he's not going to have
[1:20:45] two brides.
[1:20:47] When he looks down, he's going to have
[1:20:48] one bride.
[1:20:51] And she's going to be without spot or
[1:20:52] wrinkle. We got to get to that because
[1:20:54] we're pretty wrinkly and pretty spotted
[1:20:56] at this moment. Everybody with me? Just
[1:20:59] say it plain right here at this moment,
[1:21:01] this scripture, we are pretty messed up.
[1:21:05] And unless God does something, we're
[1:21:07] going to stay messed up. But praise God,
[1:21:10] he did.
[1:21:12] Now
[1:21:15] watch. You see what Eve did? I'll read
[1:21:18] it to you in just a few minutes, but
[1:21:20] I'll I'll emphasize this. He said,
[1:21:22] "Don't eat from that tree."
[1:21:25] Right? Don't eat from that tree. Eat
[1:21:28] from this one. Right? Jesus walks up one
[1:21:32] day and he says, "I am the vine."
[1:21:35] You are the branches.
[1:21:38] What her problem was, brother Donnie,
[1:21:40] she hooked herself to the wrong tree.
[1:21:43] Amen. Eve hooked herself to the wrong
[1:21:45] tree. And when she did, she produced
[1:21:46] something besides what God wanted
[1:21:48] produced. Amen.
[1:21:51] And to
[1:21:52] Adam, he said, "Because thou hast
[1:21:54] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife,
[1:21:56] and hast eaten of the tree of which I
[1:21:57] commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not
[1:21:59] eat of it." He didn't curse Adam. He
[1:22:02] didn't curse Eve. He cursed the ground.
[1:22:05] And I have myself a note. Where was your
[1:22:08] body at that time?
[1:22:11] Yes, sir.
[1:22:13] Your body was s You're made out of 16
[1:22:16] elements.
[1:22:17] Potassium, calcium,
[1:22:22] potachsh, garbled
[1:22:26] garbage. Your mom and daddy ate food
[1:22:31] from this
[1:22:32] ground. That food went into their body
[1:22:36] and produced sperm and egg for the man
[1:22:38] and woman. Am I with me?
[1:22:41] So everybody came here the same way.
[1:22:43] Right? And you were born from this
[1:22:45] earth, right? So the earth was cursed,
[1:22:48] so you're cursed.
[1:22:51] That's why we get older.
[1:22:55] Cuz it's a cursed thing that we're in.
[1:22:57] But God made a way for us to get out of
[1:22:59] that. Amen.
[1:23:02] Thou shalt eat of it. Cursed is the
[1:23:04] ground for thy sake. Thou shalt not eat
[1:23:06] of
[1:23:07] it. And sorrow thou shalt eat of it all
[1:23:10] the days of your life. Thorns also and
[1:23:12] thistles shall bring forth, and thou
[1:23:14] shalt eat the herb herb of the field,
[1:23:16] and the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[1:23:18] bread. You'll have
[1:23:20] Mondays. You'll have overtime.
[1:23:25] You'll have 100 degree days when your
[1:23:26] tire goes flat in the middle of the
[1:23:28] interstate.
[1:23:31] In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[1:23:32] bread, till thou return to the ground.
[1:23:35] For out of it was thou taken. For dust
[1:23:38] thou art, and to dust you're going to
[1:23:39] return.
[1:23:40] Amen. Now look, after all
[1:23:44] that, Adam called his wife's name Eve
[1:23:48] because she was the mother of all
[1:23:50] living. Now, let's jump over to Genesis
[1:23:53] 5. Here we go. We're going to look at
[1:23:55] the book still. Now, look, this is the
[1:23:57] book of the generations of Adam. In the
[1:24:01] day that God created man in the likeness
[1:24:04] of God, made he him. male and female
[1:24:08] created he them blessed them and called
[1:24:12] their name Adam
[1:24:15] in the day they were created
[1:24:19] got messed up later on but in the day
[1:24:21] they got created or was created her name
[1:24:24] was Mrs. Jesus Christ. That's right.
[1:24:28] May I jump over a few thousand years?
[1:24:31] She was him. She was literally him.
[1:24:36] Listen, that's what God wanted.
[1:24:39] That's what God wanted. That's his plan.
[1:24:42] But by permissive will, we all came off
[1:24:46] of that tree. Your mama, mama for that,
[1:24:49] daddy daddy for that. You got hooked to
[1:24:51] the wrong tree. Amen. and the fruit you
[1:24:54] brought forth because remember the
[1:24:55] branches bear the fruit.
[1:24:59] The vine is the life. Amen. So we got in
[1:25:02] the wrong tree life.
[1:25:05] Right. So we come forth a product of
[1:25:08] Satan.
[1:25:10] Amen. Oh, don't get quiet on me. That's
[1:25:12] right. That's how we all got started.
[1:25:16] Oh, my mama was a saint. My daddy was a
[1:25:18] saint. That's okay.
[1:25:21] So was
[1:25:23] um Esau and
[1:25:25] Jacob's parents were godly parents. You
[1:25:28] see what came out of them.
[1:25:31] Amen. I am the vine. You are the
[1:25:34] branches. He that abideth in me and I in
[1:25:36] him. The same bring forth what? The tree
[1:25:38] of life.
[1:25:40] For without me, you can do nothing.
[1:25:45] She attached herself to the tree of
[1:25:46] knowledge and brought forth a child of
[1:25:48] Satan.
[1:25:51] Now, what we're trying to do is is get
[1:25:53] back attached to the tree of life. And
[1:25:56] by the new birth, we are attached to the
[1:25:58] tree of life. And we're going to bring
[1:26:00] forth fruit, as the New Testament says,
[1:26:03] faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, or
[1:26:04] love, joy, peace, longsuffering, all
[1:26:06] those different virtues. That's what
[1:26:08] fruits of the spirit, that's why they
[1:26:10] call fruits of the spirit. It comes off
[1:26:11] of a tree. Amen. The God tree, not the
[1:26:14] devil tree. Amen.
[1:26:17] So, both wanted to be expressed in human
[1:26:20] flesh. That was their whole goal. You
[1:26:22] say, "How do you know that?"
[1:26:24] What's the beast going to be in the end
[1:26:27] time? Incarnate devil. Amen. What's the
[1:26:31] bride going to be in the end time?
[1:26:32] Incarnate God.
[1:26:36] And Adam called his wife's name Eve
[1:26:38] because she was a mother of all living.
[1:26:41] The true bride body was not expressed
[1:26:43] yet. She was his bride. Absolutely. Adam
[1:26:46] and Eve,
[1:26:47] right? But that's not the one God
[1:26:50] wanted. God wanted, as brother Ram
[1:26:52] preached, a masterpiece. And what a
[1:26:54] masterpiece it was cuz it's a
[1:26:56] masterpiece family that he's trying to
[1:26:58] produce and going to produce. Listen,
[1:27:01] God don't try anything.
[1:27:04] I said that wrong. God doesn't try
[1:27:06] anything. You know, you're going to say,
[1:27:07] "Tomorrow, I'm going to try to do it
[1:27:08] this way. I'm gonna try to go." God
[1:27:12] don't do that. Every move he makes is
[1:27:15] right.
[1:27:17] What do we got to do? We got to attach
[1:27:19] oursel to that.
[1:27:21] She took her own wisdom, the wisdom the
[1:27:24] devil put in front of her and not God's
[1:27:27] wisdom.
[1:27:29] So what happened? God's sitting here.
[1:27:32] He's want to build his body. He's got
[1:27:34] his bride. He's got his groom, right?
[1:27:37] She's she's virgin at the time. I'm
[1:27:40] talking about before the fall.
[1:27:42] He's getting ready because Adam had that
[1:27:45] title deed. Now, what was the title
[1:27:47] deed? It was names on the book.
[1:27:51] Redemptive names on the book. The only
[1:27:54] book God is worried about, the only book
[1:27:56] I'm worried about is is being in the
[1:27:59] book of the lamb slain before the
[1:28:01] foundation of the world. Eternal life.
[1:28:05] Yes, sir. There's a book of life written
[1:28:07] about all of us. But oh, praise God.
[1:28:10] There's a section that's gone now. Amen.
[1:28:13] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. It's gone.
[1:28:16] God put a place where he created a place
[1:28:18] he couldn't even go itself.
[1:28:21] Let's see if God's forgetfulness never
[1:28:22] to be remembered again.
[1:28:27] Oh my. The forfeited title deed is now
[1:28:29] in the hands of the original owner,
[1:28:31] Almighty God. Adam couldn't produce it.
[1:28:34] He said, "All right, Adam, you can't you
[1:28:35] cannot give someone eternal life.
[1:28:40] Is that all right?
[1:28:42] You've messed up. I was going to bring
[1:28:45] myself through Eve
[1:28:48] and my children, my my Genesis 1:26
[1:28:51] progeny,
[1:28:52] but I can't come or dwell in an unclean
[1:28:55] vessel and I can't come out of
[1:28:56] something. Is that what didn't Jesus
[1:28:58] say? Can some How can something clean
[1:29:00] come from something unclean?
[1:29:02] Can't happen. It's why we have to be
[1:29:04] washed by the water of the word. That's
[1:29:05] why we have to come to church. That's
[1:29:06] why we have to do the things of God.
[1:29:09] Come on.
[1:29:11] Try doing the things of God first.
[1:29:19] You can pray all you want
[1:29:21] to, but that doesn't resonate in
[1:29:24] mine. My book says if you don't come to
[1:29:28] church, you ain't a Christian. Amen.
[1:29:31] I'm sorry, but that's what the prophet
[1:29:34] said and that's what the Bible says.
[1:29:36] That's right. So, you can figure it out
[1:29:38] for your own self. You say, "Oh, that's
[1:29:41] just a ritual." You can make it that.
[1:29:44] You can come to church every day and die
[1:29:45] and go to hell. But you can't sit at
[1:29:47] home every day and go to heaven.
[1:29:53] I'm going to do Well, preach, Brother
[1:29:55] Wade. I believe it will.
[1:29:58] Amen. Listen, it's time we get down to
[1:30:01] the brass tax. You either going to make
[1:30:04] it or you're not.
[1:30:07] Absolutely. And you can't make it by
[1:30:10] yourself and your own ideas.
[1:30:15] That is correct. We have to
[1:30:18] absolutely put oursel in him. That's
[1:30:21] right. Cuz at Calvary,
[1:30:25] there was an open wound. Getting ahead
[1:30:27] of myself. He closed the one up in the
[1:30:30] Garden of Eden so Eve couldn't get back
[1:30:31] inside of Adam.
[1:30:35] But at Calvary, he had a wound. And
[1:30:38] guess what? Water and blood came out.
[1:30:42] Right.
[1:30:44] Made a way we could get back in.
[1:30:45] Correct. Amen. Absolutely. Amen. If
[1:30:48] you're not in Christ, you're lost.
[1:30:53] The title deed to the
[1:30:55] earth and to eternal life.
[1:30:58] So this book is a book of redemptive
[1:31:01] names. The Genesis 126 progeny of God.
[1:31:05] Everybody with me?
[1:31:08] Now we know one thing's for sure. Jesus
[1:31:10] died at Calvary for the whole world.
[1:31:14] He couldn't
[1:31:15] differentiate and say, "I'm just dying
[1:31:18] for this group." That's right.
[1:31:20] Because he said himself, you know, John
[1:31:23] 3:16, God, Jesus quotes that. That
[1:31:26] that's him talking. For God so loved the
[1:31:28] world, he gave his only begotten son
[1:31:29] that whoever believe in him shall have
[1:31:31] eternal life.
[1:31:33] Problem is like brother Aaron's
[1:31:35] preaching. Yeah. We want to get him off
[1:31:36] the cross or we want to see that he was
[1:31:38] on the cross. But what about getting
[1:31:40] inside of you? That's right. Amen. You
[1:31:43] want him to be your savior. Oh yes. You
[1:31:46] want him to be your Lord? No. Wait a
[1:31:48] minute. Wait a minute. Ain't nobody
[1:31:51] going to tell me what to do.
[1:31:57] The white throne judgment will tell you
[1:31:58] what to do.
[1:32:01] Amen. Hello.
[1:32:04] The title deed to the earth and to
[1:32:06] eternal life. When Adam forfeit it, then
[1:32:10] Satan's dirty hands could not take it.
[1:32:12] So, it went back to its original owner,
[1:32:15] God himself. Amen. Now, remember, it
[1:32:19] wasn't a physical book, but for us to
[1:32:21] understand, for us to understand
[1:32:24] We have to say it was something like a
[1:32:26] book, right? Cuz there's things written
[1:32:29] in here,
[1:32:34] right? Everybody with me?
[1:32:37] We're going to find out in just a
[1:32:38] minute. There he sits on the throne with
[1:32:40] his hand. Now, we going to get to
[1:32:42] Revelations 5 later on, but this is
[1:32:44] what's going to culminate in Revelations
[1:32:45] 5. There's going to be a bloody lamb
[1:32:48] that is alive now.
[1:32:50] Amen. Amen. That's going to take that
[1:32:53] book that Adam forfeited.
[1:32:56] That's right.
[1:32:59] Take it out of the hands of the original
[1:33:00] owner and say, "This is mine. I've been
[1:33:04] waiting on this for 6,000 years. It's
[1:33:06] mine. It's my book.
[1:33:10] Those are my kids.
[1:33:13] Those are my progeny."
[1:33:15] They come from me. Yes. Oh, how many of
[1:33:18] you can say, "I come from God and I go
[1:33:20] back to God." You better believe that.
[1:33:22] Absolutely. You better believe. You come
[1:33:24] from God and you say, "Oh, that's pretty
[1:33:26] bad." Well, the Bible even says that
[1:33:28] what? You're God's who the word comes
[1:33:30] to.
[1:33:33] But listen, we're not going to come any
[1:33:35] other way than the shed blood of Jesus
[1:33:38] Christ. And it's not the message of the
[1:33:40] hour.
[1:33:42] Oh, don't get quiet. I think I'll take a
[1:33:44] drink while you throw something.
[1:33:52] You got to know Jesus Christ first.
[1:33:55] If you know Jesus Christ, I'll promise
[1:33:57] you he'll take you to the message cuz
[1:34:01] she is him. How's he going to reproduce
[1:34:03] himself? He's got to have a virgin
[1:34:05] bride. How's he going to reproduce
[1:34:06] himself with dirty word?
[1:34:11] How's he going to repossess himself with
[1:34:13] a critical stinking attitude that
[1:34:15] everybody's wrong and you're right?
[1:34:21] Oh, I saw you, brother Aaron. I saw you
[1:34:24] the other day.
[1:34:27] Put whatever that isn't in
[1:34:31] there. Critical spirits are hard spirits
[1:34:33] to break.
[1:34:36] Amen. You see, that was Judas's problem.
[1:34:41] There we go to the twins again. Because
[1:34:43] remember, and I had got to that yet, but
[1:34:45] I'm going to get to it right now.
[1:34:48] When you have twins now, when you have
[1:34:50] natural twins, like where's Zoe and
[1:34:51] Kaylee? Joey and Kaylee, they're the
[1:34:53] only twins in the house, I think.
[1:34:54] Anybody else said twins? They're not
[1:34:58] identical. Absolutely not identical.
[1:35:03] Questionable sometimes.
[1:35:07] But they came, listen honestly, they
[1:35:09] came from the same act. They came from
[1:35:10] the same mother and father, right?
[1:35:12] So now they have the progeny of their
[1:35:14] parents inside of them. Though they were
[1:35:17] a split, okay? Not identical. Okay?
[1:35:20] Didn't split the egg, but it had two
[1:35:22] different eggs, right? Isn't that where
[1:35:22] you get the two without the identical
[1:35:27] twins? But in God, if there's ever a
[1:35:32] second, it's
[1:35:34] material that he didn't
[1:35:36] produce. Think about it. Shock factor
[1:35:39] here.
[1:35:41] Did Did the right seed produce Cain?
[1:35:48] Huh? He was a twin.
[1:35:59] Right
[1:36:01] seed produces the right person. Not
[1:36:04] twins. Amen.
[1:36:08] There's not twins in God.
[1:36:10] No, you and him. That's not twins
[1:36:13] either.
[1:36:16] She is him. Remember, she's not him.
[1:36:19] She's him.
[1:36:23] So when you look at twin
[1:36:27] material, you look at Cain. Cain was
[1:36:31] twin material. Cain came from the same
[1:36:33] womb.
[1:36:35] Everybody with me? Different seed, same
[1:36:38] place. Everybody with me here for a
[1:36:40] second? All right, I'm about halfway
[1:36:42] finished.
[1:36:44] Praise. Listen, that people are going to
[1:36:46] be eating. The the restaurants are going
[1:36:48] to be full of Easter people.
[1:36:54] That's what I told
[1:36:55] him. We went to that Methodist church.
[1:36:58] When we went out to eat, it was right in
[1:37:00] the middle when everybody else got out
[1:37:01] and we had to stand away for 15 or 20
[1:37:03] minutes at a Mexican restaurant. And we
[1:37:05] sat down and I looked at the girl that
[1:37:07] worked with me and I said, "You know, if
[1:37:08] id have preached a little longer, it'd
[1:37:10] been empty." Cuz about 30 minutes after
[1:37:11] we got there and got seated, the all the
[1:37:14] church goers left. You know what she
[1:37:16] said? She said, "If you'd have quit 30
[1:37:18] minutes earlier, we'd have got here
[1:37:19] before they
[1:37:25] did." The devil knows how to answer a
[1:37:28] question. Praise God. Anyway, yeah, she
[1:37:32] said 30 minutes earlier, we'd have got
[1:37:33] here in front of this. Anyway, so
[1:37:35] they're going to be out there eating.
[1:37:37] So, let's just talk a little while and
[1:37:38] then when they empty out, we'll go eat a
[1:37:40] little while. I like eating here, man.
[1:37:43] When I was doing Thursday night, I'm
[1:37:44] telling you, I had a it was an
[1:37:46] experience that you should have. I don't
[1:37:48] want you to have mine. You have your
[1:37:49] own. You got to come to a place where
[1:37:51] you're fixing to go to Calvary. You're
[1:37:54] getting ready to die. Amen. You got to
[1:37:56] die to yourself here. You can't do it at
[1:37:58] the cross.
[1:38:00] [Music]
[1:38:02] Praise God.
[1:38:04] He gave us the opportunity
[1:38:07] to do that right now today. Hallelujah.
[1:38:10] Yes.
[1:38:12] But twin material. You look back through
[1:38:14] time and you see Cain religious.
[1:38:20] Did everything he thought was right.
[1:38:24] Huh?
[1:38:27] Went to the same church.
[1:38:30] Judas. Jesus. Yep. Listen. Judas had the
[1:38:34] same ministry. He cast out devils, spoke
[1:38:35] in tongues.
[1:38:37] He was sanctified. Yes. He looked like a
[1:38:40] pretty good message believer. But he was
[1:38:42] a devil.
[1:38:44] Why? Cuz it wasn't in his soul.
[1:38:48] Until God gets in your soul, you will
[1:38:49] doubt everything in the world.
[1:38:53] But when you get born again, you are
[1:38:55] connected to eternal life. And when it
[1:38:57] speaks, you got to speak back. You got
[1:39:00] to say like Sister Hattie, right? That
[1:39:02] ain't nothing but the truth.
[1:39:06] I don't have to understand everything.
[1:39:08] Exactly. Brother Ram said, "You
[1:39:10] scholars, you know the
[1:39:11] Bible." He said, "You may know all the
[1:39:13] Bible." He said, "But I know the author
[1:39:15] pretty well." And if I know the author
[1:39:18] pretty well, he'll tell me what's in
[1:39:19] that Bible. Amen.
[1:39:22] Hallelujah.
[1:39:25] That was my problem. I wasn't spending
[1:39:26] my time
[1:39:28] wisely to the things of God. And I
[1:39:31] apologize.
[1:39:33] I'm just man enough to own up to it.
[1:39:37] I just did not spend the time I should
[1:39:38] spend. That won't happen
[1:39:41] again because when I started into this,
[1:39:45] it became
[1:39:46] fresh, brand
[1:39:49] new, live.
[1:39:51] I knew where it came from.
[1:39:55] Now you got to do with it what you're
[1:39:56] supposed to do with it.
[1:39:59] But twin material was Cain, Esau. They
[1:40:02] came from the same womb.
[1:40:05] Jacob have I loved, Esau have I hated.
[1:40:09] Now, we didn't say that. God did because
[1:40:12] he knew what Esau would do.
[1:40:15] Jesus,
[1:40:16] Jesus, Antichrist, Christ.
[1:40:22] Different material, twin material. We do
[1:40:25] not ever want to be a twin.
[1:40:30] Think about
[1:40:31] it. Sorry, twins.
[1:40:35] in
[1:40:37] God. So, it's okay. You're fine. It's
[1:40:41] not I'm not talking about natural. You
[1:40:42] understand what I'm saying?
[1:40:44] If you have a different mindset, it's
[1:40:46] that twin mindset. It comes from that
[1:40:48] twin material that he's telling you this
[1:40:50] ain't right. This is wrong. You
[1:40:51] shouldn't believe this. You shouldn't do
[1:40:52] that. Shouldn't do this. Go over here.
[1:40:54] Look at this. What he does is is he
[1:40:56] takes you all away from God. Right.
[1:40:59] Put your mind on this and this and this
[1:41:01] and this and this and this and this and
[1:41:02] this and this and this and this.
[1:41:05] When the truth's laying right here in
[1:41:07] front of you,
[1:41:10] what did Mary
[1:41:12] do? Cuz remember this is where it all
[1:41:15] get started.
[1:41:19] Hallelujah.
[1:41:22] The title deed, it disappeared for a
[1:41:25] while because the blood of bulls and
[1:41:27] goats didn't have eternal life in it.
[1:41:29] Everybody with me, brother Collins?
[1:41:32] Right. It didn't have eternal
[1:41:34] life. Blood of bulls and goats had the
[1:41:36] blood of an animal
[1:41:38] which only covered sin until God could
[1:41:41] come and take away sin. That sin was
[1:41:44] still there. bumping up against that
[1:41:47] blood.
[1:41:48] But remember the law of substitution is
[1:41:51] something had to take your place.
[1:41:56] Something had to take your place in the
[1:41:58] Old Testament. It was an animal. But
[1:42:00] that animal, there's no way that that
[1:42:02] life could come back and come into the
[1:42:05] person and make them righteous.
[1:42:10] Amen. Hey, but
[1:42:12] remember the lamb of
[1:42:15] God, the life in him was not a man's
[1:42:18] life. It was God's life. And he could
[1:42:22] come back into the believer. All right.
[1:42:25] And save us. Yes, sir. Fill us with the
[1:42:27] Holy Ghost. Take us in the rapture.
[1:42:31] The title deed to eternal life. Abstract
[1:42:33] title deed to eternal life. When Adam
[1:42:36] forfeited it for wisdom and instead of
[1:42:39] faith, it went back to the hands of the
[1:42:41] owner, God Almighty. What a great thing.
[1:42:44] What a great thing. And remember, there
[1:42:47] is books of life. There is a book in
[1:42:51] Revelations 20 something that that's
[1:42:53] going to be open at the white throne
[1:42:55] judgment.
[1:42:57] Right? You're not in that book if you're
[1:43:00] bride.
[1:43:02] You don't want to make it to that part
[1:43:05] cuz you're going to be judged for your
[1:43:07] deeds and your works.
[1:43:10] But praise God, today if you're born
[1:43:11] again, you take God's works, you take
[1:43:14] God's deeds, you have the mind of
[1:43:16] Christ, and you're going to have the
[1:43:17] body of Christ before long. Amen. And in
[1:43:20] potential, your body now is going to
[1:43:23] obey the life that's inside of you. I
[1:43:27] said potentially. Remember, this thing's
[1:43:28] sticky. It's always going to be contrary
[1:43:30] to God. But there's got to somewhere you
[1:43:33] got to say, "That's it right there. I'm
[1:43:35] done. I ain't taking nothing else."
[1:43:38] So, the book of the redeemed or the
[1:43:40] bride body, we're talking about a body
[1:43:42] thou has prepared me. There's no other
[1:43:45] way you can get around
[1:43:47] Calvary to make this new bride body.
[1:43:52] Well, don't get quiet.
[1:43:54] It wasn't produced in the Old Testament,
[1:43:56] was it? No.
[1:44:00] So now two
[1:44:01] bodies flesh bodies remember God wanted
[1:44:05] be in flesh Satan want to be in flesh
[1:44:08] right
[1:44:09] twins one true one opposing are twin
[1:44:14] material twin material will always
[1:44:18] always deny the word of God question the
[1:44:22] word of God and be critical to the word
[1:44:24] of God
[1:44:27] because
[1:44:28] Look, Dad preached it a long time ago
[1:44:30] and I think I mentioned it when we went
[1:44:32] through. There's listen, there's two
[1:44:33] kind two kinds of virtue, two kinds of
[1:44:35] knowledge, two kinds of temperance, two
[1:44:37] kinds of patience, two kinds of
[1:44:39] godliness. There's one he said, brother
[1:44:40] M said, one is just your human quality.
[1:44:44] Then there's the faith of God,
[1:44:47] the virtue of God, the knowledge of God,
[1:44:51] the temperance of God, and the patience
[1:44:53] of God. Everybody with me? right there.
[1:44:56] But if you're twin
[1:44:58] material, think about this.
[1:45:01] If you're twin
[1:45:03] material, right
[1:45:06] there, you can't believe the unseen.
[1:45:12] You have to see it to believe it. That's
[1:45:16] not what a believer is.
[1:45:19] My faith is not twin faith or twin
[1:45:22] material. My faith is God said it. I
[1:45:25] believe it. And listen, hold on. And
[1:45:27] God's obligated to bring it to me if I
[1:45:29] want it. That's right. Amen. Obligated
[1:45:31] to bring it to me if I want it.
[1:45:35] The faith of God. All right. There's one
[1:45:38] faith cannot even believe what the
[1:45:40] unseen
[1:45:41] is. But the faith of God is something
[1:45:45] inside pushes out of you and changes
[1:45:48] your life
[1:45:51] eternally. Not today, not lose it
[1:45:53] tomorrow, not lose it next week. You
[1:45:56] know, that's what gets me. I am sorry.
[1:45:58] I'm going to say this. You can We got a
[1:46:01] building full of people and a lot of
[1:46:03] people out.
[1:46:05] So, I'll promise you one
[1:46:09] thing. If your life hadn't been changed
[1:46:12] from what you were,
[1:46:15] you're not born again.
[1:46:18] If your life if your life is the same as
[1:46:21] it was, what in the world did you get
[1:46:23] saved from?
[1:46:26] I've always said if you fall out of a
[1:46:28] boat into the water, can't swim, you
[1:46:31] swim like a rock. Amen. And somebody
[1:46:34] reaches out and grabs you and pulls you
[1:46:36] back into the boat, he has saved you.
[1:46:39] Yes, sir. Amen. Our problem is we jump
[1:46:43] back in the water. Right.
[1:46:46] preacher sat here and then me saying
[1:46:48] preach on you got to come to church. You
[1:46:50] need to come to church. Only Christian
[1:46:51] come to church. People come to church
[1:46:52] like three or four services and all of a
[1:46:53] sudden
[1:46:55] listen that fire will never go out if
[1:46:58] you get it one time from God. It'll
[1:47:00] never go out. It'll burn in your heart
[1:47:02] if you don't can't get in this church. I
[1:47:04] said burn in your heart.
[1:47:08] There's a lot of things my flesh wants
[1:47:10] to do. Amen. I'm just gonna be honest.
[1:47:13] There's a lot of things my flesh wants
[1:47:14] to do even on Sunday.
[1:47:18] Oh, pray for me then.
[1:47:21] A lot of things.
[1:47:27] More than you know.
[1:47:32] But I got something inside of me that
[1:47:35] doesn't say you got to go to
[1:47:37] church. It says you want to go. Yes,
[1:47:40] sir. Amen. It says you need to go. I
[1:47:44] need fellowship. I need to see my
[1:47:47] brothers and sisters. I need to see. You
[1:47:50] know why? Because you're a witness
[1:47:53] of what's inside of you. And if you're
[1:47:54] not at church, I told somebody, remember
[1:47:56] a long time ago, I said, "You you say,
[1:47:58] "Well, where can I meet God? I I haven't
[1:48:00] found God in a long time." Look down
[1:48:02] there on that door. It says, "Service
[1:48:03] starts at 10:00."
[1:48:06] If you want to meet God, be here at
[1:48:07] 10:00.
[1:48:10] Amen.
[1:48:13] If you don't believe it, that makes you
[1:48:14] an unbeliever. You're twin material.
[1:48:17] I like that.
[1:48:20] Because listen, you and I are going to
[1:48:21] find out when we get to the end of this
[1:48:24] thing. You're going to be the material
[1:48:26] of God, body, spirit, and soul. Amen.
[1:48:30] You're not going to be the body of
[1:48:32] Samuel and Peggy Dale. Right? You're
[1:48:35] going to realize that you came from
[1:48:37] another source. You are not twin
[1:48:40] material. You have come from the
[1:48:42] Almighty and you're going back to the
[1:48:44] Almighty. Amen. But you can't do it.
[1:48:48] We're going to get into a lot of these
[1:48:49] things. Marriage and divorce, paying
[1:48:51] your tithe, coming to church, doing the
[1:48:53] things you're supposed to do. You say
[1:48:54] that's ritual. You can make it that.
[1:48:58] That's right. But it's got to be a want
[1:49:00] to. Absolutely. Absolutely.
[1:49:06] Everybody all right
[1:49:09] sisters. You can't
[1:49:14] go and
[1:49:16] say my hair is just a little too long.
[1:49:20] Me and brother Collie don't have that
[1:49:23] problem. Praise God. We we we worship
[1:49:26] with our head uncovered.
[1:49:28] All right.
[1:49:32] But it and listen, the old person wants
[1:49:34] to I see June and different ones. Yeah.
[1:49:36] I mean, you know, you
[1:49:38] got I love you,
[1:49:41] baby. Stand up
[1:49:43] [Laughter]
[1:49:45] here, Gabby. Hold your hands
[1:49:49] up. But sometimes she'll get in a
[1:49:53] windstorm and look like Albert
[1:49:58] Einstein. And I'm trying to make a point
[1:50:00] here. I hope I'm trying to make a point
[1:50:02] here. I mean, it's
[1:50:04] like, but see, if we do that, of course,
[1:50:07] we don't have that problem, but if we
[1:50:09] had that problem like like Dalton
[1:50:11] does, you better hang on to that stuff,
[1:50:14] buddy. He can have that all flying
[1:50:16] everywhere and like, I don't like that
[1:50:18] anymore. I think I'm going to cut it
[1:50:19] off. That's right. Right. Josiah, you do
[1:50:22] the same
[1:50:23] thing. All of us, it just naturally
[1:50:25] comes out. It's called the fall for a
[1:50:28] reason. That's right. your hair falls
[1:50:30] out. Your teeth fall out.
[1:50:36] But but you know what Sister June does?
[1:50:39] She doesn't go well. I think I'll if I
[1:50:41] go behind this door and I think I'll
[1:50:44] just I don't know why I'm doing this,
[1:50:45] but I'm preaching anyway. You know, I
[1:50:47] think I'll get rid of them flyers.
[1:50:49] That's what I call them. Flyers. Flyers.
[1:50:51] Not flowers. Fly. Sarah, that's not
[1:50:53] funny. Flyers.
[1:50:57] You and I can get rid of them. If I see
[1:50:58] one sticking up right here, Sister Emma,
[1:51:01] it's going to go, I'm cutting it off,
[1:51:04] but they don't. And they don't do it
[1:51:07] because they think they'll get caught.
[1:51:09] That's right. By not doing it. Their
[1:51:11] hair is their glory. They're doing what
[1:51:13] the Bible said to do.
[1:51:16] It's an honor for you sisters to walk
[1:51:18] with your hair long. And I know, Listen,
[1:51:20] I'm sorry. I've never had that problem.
[1:51:22] But there is when your hair is this
[1:51:24] long, there's only so much you can do
[1:51:25] with it, right? Everybody says they all
[1:51:28] the sisters say amen. None of the men.
[1:51:31] Sorry, we don't have to handle that.
[1:51:36] So, what are we as bride material
[1:51:39] now? Bride material comes to church
[1:51:44] every Sunday. I know some of you can't
[1:51:46] get here on Wednesday night, but my
[1:51:48] goodness, if if Sister Trudy sitting
[1:51:50] back there, she's 80 something years
[1:51:51] old. Raise your hand up, Sister Trudy.
[1:51:55] She's in I ain't going to say she's just
[1:51:57] in her
[1:51:58] 80s. She drove four hours. How many
[1:52:02] years?
[1:52:03] 20. Roughly 20 years from from
[1:52:06] Charlotte, North Carolina to this
[1:52:08] church.
[1:52:10] 4 hours to get there here. In other
[1:52:14] words, when you were still asleep, she
[1:52:16] was getting in the car to leave. That's
[1:52:17] right. Right. And when you got home and
[1:52:20] had your little supper and you had your
[1:52:22] little had your little meal with your
[1:52:24] family or and fellowship, she hadn't
[1:52:26] even got home yet.
[1:52:29] She did for 20 years. God honored her.
[1:52:32] Amen. Some of you live here 30 minutes,
[1:52:34] 20 minutes, 45 minutes away and you
[1:52:36] think, "Oh, that's just too long. I
[1:52:37] can't get here."
[1:52:39] You'll think it's too long when you walk
[1:52:41] up a white throne judgment.
[1:52:43] You say, "Oh, it ain't got nothing to do
[1:52:44] with my Christianity." It's got
[1:52:46] everything to do because you are saying
[1:52:47] I don't need that.
[1:52:50] I'm sorry.
[1:52:52] I don't need that. Your sisters, I don't
[1:52:54] need that. I don't need hair long. God
[1:52:57] loves your hair long. And listen, if God
[1:53:00] loves whatever we need to do it,
[1:53:06] amen.
[1:53:08] So now twin
[1:53:10] knowledge does not judge God's word to
[1:53:13] be all true as the serpent did.
[1:53:16] Everybody with me? Yeah. Stick with me
[1:53:18] here for just a little bit. Does not
[1:53:20] judge God's word to be all true as the
[1:53:23] serpent did. Because remember he just
[1:53:24] added one word.
[1:53:26] You'll not surely not. God said you will
[1:53:30] die. Surely die. He said not. I I don't
[1:53:32] think
[1:53:34] so. But true knowledge. I'm sorry, I
[1:53:37] didn't spell that right. Brings together
[1:53:39] the word of God and judges it
[1:53:43] true. Everybody with me. True knowledge
[1:53:46] brings together the word of God and
[1:53:47] judges it the truth.
[1:53:52] Let's look at Mary just for a
[1:53:54] moment. Talking about somebody that had
[1:53:56] to believe.
[1:53:58] Amen. Talking about somebody had to
[1:54:00] believe. Have you ever put yourself
[1:54:02] Who's in here? Who's 16 years old in
[1:54:03] here?
[1:54:07] Oh boy. And
[1:54:10] Melody and oh my daughter, my
[1:54:13] granddaughter. I'm not going to use her
[1:54:15] for this
[1:54:17] example. But you're walking among your
[1:54:21] friends. You're 16 years old. You're
[1:54:24] walking one
[1:54:27] day. You've never known a man.
[1:54:30] You
[1:54:33] know, let me put it this way. You know
[1:54:36] what happens between a man and a woman.
[1:54:38] You're 16. You ought to know that by
[1:54:39] now, especially in this day and
[1:54:41] age. But Mary is just minding her own
[1:54:45] business. She's not in a temple. She's
[1:54:48] not before God.
[1:54:50] She's just walking to the, you know, I
[1:54:52] like what brother Ram says. She's just
[1:54:53] walking down the
[1:54:56] road. And something just appears out of
[1:54:58] the
[1:55:00] sky.
[1:55:02] Gabriel, he ain't got wings and he ain't
[1:55:05] a she.
[1:55:08] Preach. I believe it. Well, he doesn't
[1:55:11] have to get up there in the wings go.
[1:55:12] They do that for dramatization now, you
[1:55:15] know. But but I mean, you know, you
[1:55:16] angels don't have the wings. They got
[1:55:20] no you know. I thank God
[1:55:23] that God let Billy Paul
[1:55:27] see the angel of the Lord.
[1:55:30] Okay?
[1:55:33] That brother Ram sees all the
[1:55:35] time. That's the angel of the Lord. Why
[1:55:37] would he come to somebody that ain't
[1:55:38] worth nothing? Cuz he deemed him worthy.
[1:55:42] He deemed him a prophet.
[1:55:44] A prophet of God. Everybody with me?
[1:55:49] So here's the angel and and brother Paul
[1:55:52] said, "Dad, I'd like to see him just one
[1:55:54] time."
[1:55:56] He said, "Okay, he's heard your he's
[1:55:57] heard your request. You go stand over
[1:55:59] there." He said, "When he saw him, it
[1:56:01] was a what?" It was like a Middle
[1:56:02] Eastern looking man standing there, you
[1:56:04] know, all powerful looking and all that.
[1:56:06] That was an angel. So, here comes this
[1:56:09] angel up to Mary. It's a
[1:56:11] stranger. Mary's never seen him
[1:56:14] before. Mary, highly favored.
[1:56:19] What? He's fixing to build a body,
[1:56:21] remember?
[1:56:22] He's got to find faith first
[1:56:26] before he can build a body because this
[1:56:29] body is going to be built by
[1:56:32] faith.
[1:56:34] A 16y old, not a 30-year-old woman, a
[1:56:38] 16-year-old
[1:56:40] kid that was a spouse to a man that was
[1:56:43] a little bit older. Okay, they had fell
[1:56:45] in love. Brother Ram said they talked on
[1:56:48] the porch maybe and and maybe even
[1:56:50] quoted Isaiah 9:6, a virgin shall
[1:56:53] conceive because, you know, they read
[1:56:54] the Old Testament, right? Okay. And they
[1:56:58] went to
[1:57:00] church.
[1:57:01] But here's this man says, "Mary, highly
[1:57:06] favored." And she's like, "Who are you?"
[1:57:10] It's pretty much, you know, I'm an angel
[1:57:11] sent from God to tell you that the Most
[1:57:14] High is going to overshadow you and
[1:57:15] you're going to bring forth a child.
[1:57:17] Yes. Whoa.
[1:57:20] Shock. Would that not be a shock? And
[1:57:23] she He says, "It's going to be really
[1:57:25] miraculous. You're not even going to
[1:57:26] know a man. The Holy Ghost is going to
[1:57:29] overshadow you." And Mary's like, "Now,
[1:57:31] mama told me how this
[1:57:33] happened, and I don't see
[1:57:36] that." But what did she say? She said,
[1:57:39] "How could this
[1:57:41] be I not knowing a
[1:57:44] man?" How could this be
[1:57:48] not knowing a man? She just didn't know
[1:57:51] she was getting ready to produce the
[1:57:53] man.
[1:57:55] She was going to be the incubator for
[1:57:58] God to fulfill 400 and something
[1:58:01] scriptures in the Old Testament.
[1:58:04] It had to be a creative act of God
[1:58:06] alone. So, what was the first body? He
[1:58:09] wanted a body without sin. A body
[1:58:13] created in his image, right? How do you
[1:58:16] think he's going to get it back? He's
[1:58:18] got to make a body without sin and
[1:58:21] without sex, without a carnal mind. You
[1:58:25] and I have a carnal mind because we can
[1:58:27] look back at our progeny that we
[1:58:28] produced on earth and we go, "Well, my
[1:58:30] daddy was this and my mama was that."
[1:58:32] And we were talking about something back
[1:58:34] there the other the other day.
[1:58:35] Genetically, we have things wrong with
[1:58:37] us that have just come from genetics.
[1:58:40] Your mom and daddy, your mom and dad's
[1:58:41] daddy, and all this genetics and what?
[1:58:43] All this stuff piled in
[1:58:45] together. It's just corrupting worse and
[1:58:47] worse every time a generation comes.
[1:58:51] But God had to step in and say, "I'll
[1:58:53] put enmity. I'm going to put a division,
[1:58:55] but I'm going to put it back together.
[1:58:57] I'm going to give put my seed in a
[1:59:01] woman.
[1:59:02] She's not going to have anything to do
[1:59:04] with it." That's right. It was God's
[1:59:07] created lamb.
[1:59:09] Now remember, she didn't produce the
[1:59:12] egg.
[1:59:15] This was all in God's mind. Even back in
[1:59:17] the garden, Brother John,
[1:59:21] he's so patient.
[1:59:23] He waited on me for 20 something years.
[1:59:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:59:28] More more than for others, not for
[1:59:29] others. So, praise God for that he
[1:59:31] waited that long on me. Amen. But he
[1:59:33] stood there, waited.
[1:59:36] He said, "I got this plan and I'm going
[1:59:37] to see it out." He said, "I already see
[1:59:39] it done."
[1:59:41] But it's got to come through. Something
[1:59:43] that got polluted back then that started
[1:59:47] the fall rolling. Ball of the fall.
[1:59:50] That's pretty good. I like that. The
[1:59:51] ball in the fall. So, I'll use that.
[1:59:53] Nobody else can use that as
[1:59:56] copyrighted. But to get the ball
[1:59:58] rolling, he had to do it in reverse.
[2:00:01] It couldn't be twin material.
[2:00:05] It had to be his material.
[2:00:08] Amen. His material created egg.
[2:00:11] Remember, he's a creator. That's why
[2:00:13] Satan can't create. Satan can't put his
[2:00:17] germ in a woman. Cuz he's not a human.
[2:00:22] But if he ever gets in a human, he can
[2:00:24] use a human to do what he wants to do.
[2:00:27] Amen. Well, pray for me.
[2:00:32] little kids, little
[2:00:34] devils. Till they get born again, we're
[2:00:36] all devils.
[2:00:40] So when this baby was born though, he
[2:00:42] was so special. That body that thou has
[2:00:45] prepared me is a body that the germ life
[2:00:52] DNA came from God.
[2:00:56] The blood cell came from God.
[2:00:59] at all. There was nothing on this earth
[2:01:02] he was connected to except that cord to
[2:01:04] give him life because he had to be born
[2:01:07] like me and you, right?
[2:01:12] Law of
[2:01:14] redemption that Gabriel couldn't redeem,
[2:01:16] Michael couldn't redeem,
[2:01:20] God couldn't redeem in spirit form.
[2:01:24] Oh, come on. Amen.
[2:01:26] He had to become a human cuz human fell.
[2:01:29] He's got to become a human to erase what
[2:01:32] happened in the garden. Amen. Amen. So
[2:01:36] it was a creative act. Listen to this.
[2:01:38] In a
[2:01:39] masterpiece and then come finally the
[2:01:41] great head, the head of it all. The rest
[2:01:43] of the body just spoke of it. The
[2:01:45] foundation was laid by the patriarchs.
[2:01:47] But the body was built by the word which
[2:01:50] was the prophets. Amen. The prophets.
[2:01:53] Remember Amos 2:9. I'll do nothing
[2:01:55] unless I speak it through a prophet.
[2:01:57] Amen. Well, that was for back then.
[2:02:00] Well, that's your business, not mine. I
[2:02:02] believe in prophets till now.
[2:02:04] But the body was built by the word,
[2:02:06] which was the prophets. And here comes
[2:02:08] the head of it all. Jesus came on the
[2:02:12] scene. There when this headpiece was put
[2:02:15] upon it, we find in him the entire,
[2:02:18] listen to this, entire handiwork of
[2:02:21] God. Wow. He looked like God. He acted
[2:02:23] like God cuz he was God.
[2:02:27] And when his head was placed on there,
[2:02:29] we find in him the entire handiwork of
[2:02:31] God. We find in him the perfect
[2:02:33] reflection of the word for he was the
[2:02:37] word, the fullness of the word. Now
[2:02:40] again, God has the perfect masterpiece.
[2:02:43] Again,
[2:02:44] everybody with me? Romans 8 verse 29.
[2:02:48] for whom he did forno, he also did
[2:02:50] predestinate to be conformed to the
[2:02:53] image. Now remember the image, it was
[2:02:55] back before the foundation of the world.
[2:02:56] We were created in his image. So if if
[2:02:59] if he wants us to be perfect, he had to
[2:03:01] be perfect to begin with
[2:03:05] to be remember cuz he didn't need
[2:03:07] salvation. We do. He didn't need
[2:03:08] salvation. We need salvation.
[2:03:11] Sorry I'm a little long, but guess what?
[2:03:13] Like I said before, I ain't my stomach's
[2:03:14] not even
[2:03:15] growing. that he might be the firstborn
[2:03:19] among many brethren. Amen.
[2:03:22] Now watch Hebrews 12:23. Paul says to
[2:03:25] the general assembly and church of that
[2:03:28] firstborn.
[2:03:30] Amen. Well, I said right here, "That he
[2:03:32] might be the firstborn among many
[2:03:33] brethren." In other words, he was born
[2:03:35] right
[2:03:37] to the general assembly and church of
[2:03:38] the firstborn. That's us, which are
[2:03:41] written in heaven. Amen. That book. Yes,
[2:03:45] sir.
[2:03:46] and to God the judge of all and to the
[2:03:48] spirits of just men made perfect and to
[2:03:51] Jesus the mediator of the new covenant
[2:03:53] and to the blood of sprinkling that
[2:03:55] speaketh better things than that of
[2:03:58] Abel Revelations 3:14 that's our this is
[2:04:02] our mandate
[2:04:04] because this is our church age until the
[2:04:06] angel of the church of the layout of
[2:04:08] right these things sayith the amen the
[2:04:10] faithful and true witness what the
[2:04:13] beginning of the creation of God. Amen.
[2:04:16] You say, "Well, now you just told me
[2:04:17] that God was the
[2:04:19] creator. He created his own self body."
[2:04:23] Amen. Hello.
[2:04:25] The way it was to begin, the beginning
[2:04:27] of the creation of God. And remember,
[2:04:29] Brother Bram said, "And you and I are a
[2:04:32] continuation of that creation."
[2:04:36] You and I, we're a mixed breed.
[2:04:41] All of us are hybrid. There's a chasm
[2:04:44] between us and
[2:04:46] God. As Lazarus said, "Oh, can I go see
[2:04:49] Abraham?" Abraham looks back and says,
[2:04:51] "No, there's a great gulf and it's
[2:04:53] fixed. I can't move it. You can't move
[2:04:56] it. There has to come a redeemer."
[2:05:00] Put that thing back together again. Cuz
[2:05:03] if God put enmity between him and man,
[2:05:05] he's going to take it away by coming
[2:05:07] himself.
[2:05:09] Amen. So there was eternal life in that
[2:05:11] blood cell which is
[2:05:13] God. So the right son came to get the
[2:05:15] title deed.
[2:05:18] That's right.
[2:05:21] Now watch. And that's why he went to
[2:05:24] Calvary. That's why he bled and died. He
[2:05:26] didn't bleed and die so that the blood
[2:05:28] could come on you. Come on somebody.
[2:05:30] That blood has after 2,000 years that
[2:05:32] blood can't even be found.
[2:05:35] It just actually the the the chemistry
[2:05:37] of the blood just mingled down into the
[2:05:38] ground. First rain there was, it just
[2:05:40] washed it away.
[2:05:43] But the life that was in that blood, you
[2:05:46] can't kill it.
[2:05:48] You can't kill
[2:05:50] God. That's why God, that's why Jesus
[2:05:52] hung on the cross said, "My God, my God,
[2:05:54] why is thou forsaken me?" What? He
[2:05:57] couldn't feel that anointing. He
[2:05:58] couldn't feel that closeness that was
[2:06:00] with him during that period of time.
[2:06:02] Right? You know, brother Ram even said
[2:06:03] Jesus the the spirit left him in the
[2:06:05] garden so he could die a man. What the
[2:06:07] anointing that was on him? There was an
[2:06:09] anointing on him. He couldn't die.
[2:06:10] Remember they tried to throw him off a
[2:06:11] cliff. They tried to stone him. He just
[2:06:13] disappeared between the crowd. You're
[2:06:14] not going to die until God's finished
[2:06:16] with you.
[2:06:19] Have you ever thought about that? If all
[2:06:21] of your parents Jean was in the in the
[2:06:23] army or Navy and several one of you may
[2:06:26] have had ancestors in the army.
[2:06:30] If those people only knew it,
[2:06:32] Bob. If those people had a revelation
[2:06:35] that there's no way they could die until
[2:06:38] you got here.
[2:06:41] Don't look at me like I'm crazy. The
[2:06:43] plan of God is the plan of God. And if
[2:06:46] it got you here, it was his plan. He did
[2:06:49] it. You didn't.
[2:06:52] That's what I told them at Brother Ron
[2:06:53] Spencer's church. I said, "Y'all had
[2:06:55] 600,000 men died in the Civil War."
[2:06:58] 600,000.
[2:07:00] 600,000 generations were cut off. If
[2:07:04] they had not had children and never had
[2:07:06] children, that generation just went
[2:07:08] away.
[2:07:10] But there was angels on that field. Just
[2:07:12] like there's angels at your house,
[2:07:13] there's angels at your job. There's
[2:07:15] angels in your car with you. There's
[2:07:16] angels when you travel. Amen.
[2:07:19] That made sure move your head. Move
[2:07:23] over. Get behind that tree. And here
[2:07:24] comes the bullets flying by. Talking
[2:07:26] about the Civil War, right? I'm talking
[2:07:29] about any other time God preserved them
[2:07:32] to get you here. Amen. Now I ask you,
[2:07:34] what are you going to do about it? Cuz
[2:07:36] look, watch. This body died, resurrected
[2:07:40] today. Not today, but in symbol today.
[2:07:44] Resurrected, right? Went to the father
[2:07:47] and came back as the Holy Ghost. The
[2:07:49] body is still
[2:07:50] there. But you and I, he
[2:07:53] decided that this was going to be his
[2:07:55] body. Amen.
[2:07:57] Cuz he needed fellowship.
[2:08:00] He didn't want two heads. He didn't want
[2:08:02] two bodies. He's the head. We're the
[2:08:04] body, but we're connected. That's right.
[2:08:06] So he separated at Pentecost. So he be
[2:08:09] he separated 120 on the day of
[2:08:12] Pentecost.
[2:08:13] Separated 3,000 downstairs the next
[2:08:16] sermon that was preached. Wow. What a
[2:08:18] mighty God. But he separated himself so
[2:08:21] he could put himself back
[2:08:23] together. Amen. The bride body was
[2:08:26] inside of him wanting to get out. Just
[2:08:28] like Eve was inside of Adam wanting to
[2:08:31] get out and Adam wanted her out so he
[2:08:34] could fellowship with her.
[2:08:38] Satan's Eden.
[2:08:40] So God knew that we would be here. But
[2:08:43] then he put us in flesh so we could be
[2:08:46] or could be would be contacted. in order
[2:08:49] he could contact he became one of us
[2:08:52] when he became Jesus Christ the son of
[2:08:54] God himself the fullness of the
[2:08:57] manifestation of God therefore that was
[2:09:01] God's purpose to display his attributes
[2:09:05] in fellowship
[2:09:09] when I was in my father I knew nothing
[2:09:11] about it
[2:09:13] but I when I became his son and was born
[2:09:15] of him I was an attribute part of my
[2:09:18] father and you're part of your father.
[2:09:20] Amen. And as children of God, we are
[2:09:22] part of God's attribute that was in him,
[2:09:25] locked up in him. This is me. Locked up
[2:09:27] in him. Couldn't get out of him unless
[2:09:30] he had to. He had to come as a redeemer.
[2:09:33] Right. Amen. The redeemer paid the price
[2:09:37] and whatever was inside that redeemer
[2:09:39] got redeemed. Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:09:42] That book was inside of him when he
[2:09:44] walked the shores of Galilee because
[2:09:45] brother Ram I'm going to show you where
[2:09:46] brother Ram said you were with him at
[2:09:48] Calvary. You were with him on the Sea of
[2:09:50] Galilee. You were with him in the
[2:09:51] resurrection. You were written when he
[2:09:53] went to heavenly places when he left.
[2:09:54] You were with him. Amen. Amen. Cuz what
[2:09:58] came back on the day of Pentecost? The
[2:10:00] same Holy Ghost. Yes. That's right.
[2:10:02] There's not two or three different Holy
[2:10:03] Ghost.
[2:10:05] That's why I love what brother Ram said.
[2:10:07] He said, "You may be right and I may be
[2:10:08] wrong." He said, "But we both can't be
[2:10:11] right.
[2:10:13] In God, you don't have two rights."
[2:10:16] Amen. You have son of God and twin
[2:10:20] material, which is going to deny the
[2:10:22] word of God. Going to be a wild child,
[2:10:24] going to be something that is not going
[2:10:26] to be tameable.
[2:10:28] Amen.
[2:10:30] And most of the time, a son of the
[2:10:32] devil.
[2:10:37] Listen, we better start calling it what
[2:10:38] it is. Yes, sir. Cuz there's a devil.
[2:10:41] He's real and he wants to kill you.
[2:10:44] Period. Absolutely.
[2:10:46] As a child of God, we're a part of God's
[2:10:48] attribute that was in him. Made flesh
[2:10:51] like he was made flesh. So we can have
[2:10:54] fellowship one with the other as a
[2:10:56] family of God upon the earth. And that
[2:10:59] was God's purpose at the beginning.
[2:11:02] That's what God wanted at the beginning.
[2:11:04] We spoke about that he had everything
[2:11:07] under control and he turned man over
[2:11:10] into the garden of Eden on free moral
[2:11:11] agency says son it's yours and then we
[2:11:13] know what happened right God of this
[2:11:16] evil
[2:11:17] age now these messages I want to
[2:11:19] emphasize the things that I have told
[2:11:21] you in the message of this evening light
[2:11:23] that God said would come upon the earth
[2:11:26] and notice then the beast that was to
[2:11:27] come upon the earth would deceive all
[2:11:29] those names that were not put on a
[2:11:32] lamb's book of life slain
[2:11:34] before the foundation of the world. See
[2:11:36] what I mean? If you're twin material,
[2:11:38] you'll deny God every time. But if
[2:11:40] you're true son and daughter of God,
[2:11:42] you'll never deny it.
[2:11:45] In God's own thinking, God, the great
[2:11:48] spirit in the beginning, before there
[2:11:51] was a beginning, he was God. And did you
[2:11:54] know you were in him then? I do. Cuz you
[2:11:58] know what? Like I said before, that God
[2:12:00] faith is something inside of me saying
[2:12:02] that ain't nothing but the truth.
[2:12:07] And do you know we were in him then? If
[2:12:08] you're a Christian now, you was in him
[2:12:10] then.
[2:12:13] And then if that be so, the whole
[2:12:15] Godhead bodily shaped up in the person
[2:12:18] of Jesus Christ. And then when Jesus
[2:12:20] died at the cross, I died with
[2:12:24] him for I was in him then. For he was
[2:12:27] the fullness of the word manifesting.
[2:12:31] Watch. Knowing that we would be
[2:12:33] manifested later. That's why he hung
[2:12:35] there. Didn't say a word. He knew he had
[2:12:38] to die to release the book.
[2:12:42] He released the book. Then here all we
[2:12:44] came. Then you go to we're going to go
[2:12:46] to Revelations 10 several sermons and
[2:12:48] we're going to see where that book ended
[2:12:50] up at. In John's
[2:12:52] belly. It disappeared in a bride. Amen.
[2:12:56] Everybody with me? And we didn't eat he
[2:12:58] didn't eat part of it. He didn't leave a
[2:13:00] page or two out.
[2:13:03] Amen. He didn't eat what he wanted. He
[2:13:06] ate the whole book.
[2:13:08] He We were at Calvary with him. We went
[2:13:13] in the grave with him.
[2:13:15] And let me say one more thing. We went
[2:13:17] to hell with him. Amen. You say, "How'd
[2:13:21] that happen?" I was in Christ. I was in
[2:13:23] that theopony. That body laid dead in
[2:13:26] the grave and was getting ready to
[2:13:27] corrupt. Nothing was working in that
[2:13:29] body. It was dead, cold.
[2:13:34] But that wasn't Jesus at that time.
[2:13:36] Jesus was already in a glorified not a
[2:13:38] glorified body. He was already in his
[2:13:39] theophony which you and I are a part of.
[2:13:42] He went to hell. That's why you think
[2:13:44] this is not a good statement. We have
[2:13:47] already, if you're born again right this
[2:13:50] moment, you've already been to hell.
[2:13:52] Right.
[2:13:53] You went when he went. And there's
[2:13:55] nowhere in the Bible says you're going
[2:13:56] to go two times.
[2:14:00] Oh, what a mighty God we serve. What a
[2:14:02] plan of redemption. Amen. And we raised
[2:14:06] with him and his resurrection. And now
[2:14:10] we've ascended by his spirit to the
[2:14:12] throne of grace, sitting together in
[2:14:14] heavenly places in Christ
[2:14:17] Jesus always. For as the germ of natural
[2:14:20] life is brought down, germmitized by
[2:14:22] father to father to father, so is the
[2:14:24] life of Christ germmitized. That's the
[2:14:27] reason God uses Elijah's spirit five
[2:14:30] different times. What is it? It's
[2:14:32] handing down.
[2:14:35] I mean, it's plain as day. You can see
[2:14:36] the character of Elijah all five all
[2:14:38] five times.
[2:14:41] And remember, a long time ago, I
[2:14:43] preached on the five cups of Elijah. You
[2:14:44] know, the Israel believe they have five
[2:14:46] cups for Elijah. It's kind of strange
[2:14:48] that there's five comingings of Elijah.
[2:14:49] So
[2:14:50] anyway, well, I can't see that in the
[2:14:53] Bible. Well, I can't see Jesus died
[2:14:55] either.
[2:14:56] See, see, see, I
[2:15:01] see. And as your natural life and traits
[2:15:04] is handed down from the natural breeding
[2:15:06] of your father, so is the spirit of God
[2:15:10] that was predestinated before the
[2:15:12] foundation of the world. And when the
[2:15:14] entire word of God
[2:15:16] incomplete was headed up in a human body
[2:15:19] called Jesus Christ, in there God made
[2:15:22] me pay for my sins in him there. Then he
[2:15:27] rose me, raised me up with him in the
[2:15:30] resurrection. And now we are seated with
[2:15:33] him with power and authority over every
[2:15:36] devil. Right.
[2:15:40] Oh, if you could only believe what God
[2:15:43] has given. Amen. But if you're not
[2:15:46] seated there, you don't have it. That's
[2:15:49] right. And if you're seated there and
[2:15:52] don't believe it and afraid to move,
[2:15:54] you'll never use it. Wow. But if you are
[2:15:57] seated there, you will use it. Yes, sir.
[2:16:00] For you're ordained to do what you do.
[2:16:04] Amen. Amen.
[2:16:10] one more time then we'll go one more
[2:16:13] quote. Now he comes from the feet. Now
[2:16:15] remember in the Babylonian kingdom,
[2:16:17] remember in Daniel 9 or Daniel whatever
[2:16:20] it is. There was a kingdom built with a
[2:16:23] head of gold and all coming down. Now
[2:16:25] I'd never seen this before. I never seen
[2:16:26] this quote
[2:16:28] before. As the as it was
[2:16:32] crushed, it was being built back up the
[2:16:34] right way.
[2:16:36] the kingdom. He showed all those Old
[2:16:38] Testaments. He came from the head down
[2:16:40] until he come down to God himself became
[2:16:42] flesh at the foot of the
[2:16:46] ladder. Now here in the New Testament,
[2:16:49] he brings himself right back up again to
[2:16:52] the head again and the head of gold to
[2:16:55] be crowned. Look, you get it? See, God
[2:16:57] was in the beginning and he kept coming
[2:16:59] down through the prophets and on down
[2:17:01] until God himself became human flesh
[2:17:04] like us, plumbed down at the foot of the
[2:17:07] ladder, a baby born in a manger, hated,
[2:17:10] rejected, despised, bad name and
[2:17:13] everything he was. Let me finish my
[2:17:15] thought real quick. Think about Mary.
[2:17:18] Mary had a little
[2:17:19] girlfriend, right? right? May had people
[2:17:23] around her, you know, and she all of a
[2:17:26] sudden she starts looking like something
[2:17:30] happened.
[2:17:32] Amen. Amen. Maybe she tried to hide it.
[2:17:35] I don't know. But think of the ridicule.
[2:17:37] Cuz here's Joseph, a man like 40 years
[2:17:39] old or 20 years older than her that's
[2:17:41] already got kids. His wife died and here
[2:17:44] he is now. He's got this little
[2:17:45] 16-year-old girl. And your carnal mind
[2:17:48] run just like mine did. Hello, somebody.
[2:17:52] Okay, pray for me then. But she had to
[2:17:54] stand all that ridicule.
[2:17:58] Listen, there's only one
[2:18:00] person on earth, you hear me? There was
[2:18:03] only one person on earth that knew she
[2:18:04] was telling the truth.
[2:18:07] One. That was her. And remember, God had
[2:18:11] to speak to Joseph because he was
[2:18:13] worried about it, too. God spoke to
[2:18:16] Joseph and said, "Don't worry about
[2:18:17] this, buddy. You just protect her."
[2:18:19] That's mine.
[2:18:24] God keeps his word and protects
[2:18:27] it. So look at all the ridicule that she
[2:18:29] took even after she the baby was born.
[2:18:32] Child with a bad name, you know, and
[2:18:35] everything he was then he started
[2:18:36] rising.
[2:18:37] See, from the feet he began to build the
[2:18:40] church and the bride coming back on back
[2:18:43] and now coming out into the headstone
[2:18:46] where all joins together and makes one
[2:18:49] great transfigured body of Jesus Christ.
[2:18:52] And here's my
[2:18:55] last Ephesians 5. I wrote myself a note.
[2:18:59] So you can't get clean by dirty or
[2:19:01] perverted word. It had to be the clean
[2:19:03] word of God. Washed by the water of the
[2:19:05] word. So, so remember now, brother Kern,
[2:19:08] if God said that that we can't put a
[2:19:12] unclean in a clean vessel, but he's
[2:19:15] coming back for a bride without spot or
[2:19:18] wrinkle, sinless
[2:19:20] virgin. He's got to make a way for that
[2:19:22] to happen. And he did.
[2:19:26] Ephesians 5:23, "Husbands, love your
[2:19:28] wives."
[2:19:30] And a sister
[2:19:32] said, "Even as Christ also loved the
[2:19:35] church and gave himself for it, that he
[2:19:37] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[2:19:39] washing of
[2:19:41] water by the
[2:19:44] word that he might present it to
[2:19:50] himself." He's not presenting to anybody
[2:19:52] else. He's presenting it to
[2:19:54] himself. A glorious
[2:19:57] church. Let me just put it this way.
[2:19:59] when you and your wife got
[2:20:01] married,
[2:20:03] right? I mean, I hope you had a
[2:20:05] honeymoon. I I hope. But what
[2:20:09] happened? What happened was is she, you,
[2:20:13] the bride, presented yourself to him.
[2:20:22] No one
[2:20:24] else. No one else. You unveiled yourself
[2:20:29] for your
[2:20:30] husband. That's why it's so critical to
[2:20:32] stay clean. Stay clean to be the bride
[2:20:34] of Christ. We got to stay clean in the
[2:20:36] spiritual
[2:20:37] part. We got to stay
[2:20:39] clean. But that's what he done on the on
[2:20:43] the when you got born again, you
[2:20:44] unveiled yourself and gave everything
[2:20:46] you had to your husband. Oh, what a
[2:20:48] mighty God we serve.
[2:20:51] that he might present it to himself a
[2:20:53] glorious church, not having spot or
[2:20:55] wrinkle or any such thing, but that it
[2:20:58] should be holy and without blemish.
[2:21:02] Amen. So ought men to love their wives
[2:21:04] as her own bodies. He that loveth his
[2:21:05] wife loveth himself. For no man ever
[2:21:08] hated his own flesh, but nourishes
[2:21:12] it, cherishes it, even as the Lord the
[2:21:15] church. For we are members of his body,
[2:21:18] of his flesh. Yes.
[2:21:22] Now he's come back. That's what it was
[2:21:23] in the garden. Now he's come back to
[2:21:25] right here. He's come back to the
[2:21:27] scripture here in in um Ephesians to a
[2:21:30] real mature church that'll understand.
[2:21:34] For no man hated his own body, but
[2:21:36] nourishes. He cherisheth even as the
[2:21:38] Lord the church. For we are members of
[2:21:40] his body, of his flesh, and of his
[2:21:42] bones. For this cause shall man leave
[2:21:44] his father and mother, shall be joined
[2:21:46] unto his wife, and they too shall be one
[2:21:48] flesh. This is a great mystery. But I
[2:21:52] speak concerning
[2:21:54] Christ and the church.
[2:21:57] Now, let's read the scripture again. A
[2:21:59] body thou Jesus Christ hath prepared me.
[2:22:04] Wait, Dale, put your name in there. He
[2:22:08] has created me a body. You can't see it.
[2:22:13] It's a mystery.
[2:22:15] Mystery. Christ is a mystery God
[2:22:17] revealed, right? Well, where is Christ?
[2:22:20] I think Paul said one time, Christ
[2:22:23] in you, the hope of glory. Amen.
[2:22:27] Everybody with me?
[2:22:30] Now, this is the body of
[2:22:33] Christ. So, who are we? We're Mrs. Jesus
[2:22:36] Christ. Now, look, we have a title.
[2:22:40] You see this right here? That's a hand,
[2:22:43] right? That's a
[2:22:46] title, but it's attached to a man named
[2:22:48] Wade
[2:22:50] Dale. We have a many membered body that
[2:22:53] may look somewhat different and have a
[2:22:55] title of apostle, prophet, pastor,
[2:22:58] teacher, evangelist, deacon,
[2:23:00] elder, but it's come from the same body,
[2:23:03] the same source. You and I are the
[2:23:07] virtuous, sinless bride of Christ
[2:23:09] because he died at Calvary and rose to
[2:23:13] come inside a bunch of people that were
[2:23:15] not worthy.
[2:23:21] Find me one place you were worthy. Oh,
[2:23:23] I'm this great so and so and such and
[2:23:25] such. No garbage.
[2:23:29] We were in pitiful shape. But you know
[2:23:30] what?
[2:23:33] God looked through the
[2:23:35] blood and said, "I'm bringing them back.
[2:23:38] They were mine to begin
[2:23:41] with and they're still mine and they're
[2:23:44] always going to be mine." Let's stand to
[2:23:47] our feet. God bless you. Musicians,
[2:23:49] come.
[2:23:52] But that's why he hung on Calvary.
[2:23:53] Listen, that's why he stayed there until
[2:23:56] he died a sinner's death. until he died
[2:24:00] to where the moon even said he died. The
[2:24:02] sun said he died. The earth even said he
[2:24:04] died. Yes, sir. That was an earthquake
[2:24:06] that shook the place. He shook that
[2:24:08] place so much so a heathen sinner man
[2:24:11] that probably put him on the cross said
[2:24:13] that has to be God's always got a
[2:24:16] witness, brother Bob. He's always got a
[2:24:18] witness standing somewhere. And that man
[2:24:20] looked up and he said, "That must be the
[2:24:23] son of God." Oh, I wish he'd had that
[2:24:25] revelation before, but it wouldn't it
[2:24:27] should wouldn't have played out that
[2:24:28] way. Now, it plays out that way that we
[2:24:31] know he was the son of God. We know why
[2:24:32] he went to Calvary. He went to Calvary
[2:24:35] for me and you.
[2:24:38] He was born right. But if you're born
[2:24:41] again today, you're born right.
[2:24:46] Right. born again the right way by a
[2:24:50] spiritual birth from an eternal God
[2:24:55] that says you don't have a spot and you
[2:24:58] don't have a wrinkle you're mine you're
[2:25:01] my bride you're my
[2:25:03] wife and guess what church we got to get
[2:25:07] oursel ready
[2:25:09] because the bride hath made herself
[2:25:13] ready wife has made herself
[2:25:17] Let's sing a song. Thank you for for uh
[2:25:20] hanging on. I appreciate that. But it
[2:25:22] just meant so much to to see more
[2:25:24] clarity of what's going on even in the
[2:25:27] world. My heavens, I'm telling you
[2:25:30] folks, if this ain't
[2:25:33] it, we've missed something.
[2:25:37] The people of this country are
[2:25:40] drunk on the wine of the fornication
[2:25:43] that's going on
[2:25:45] under the guise of religion.
[2:25:50] Franklin Graham stood up yesterday and
[2:25:53] said, you know, that's Billy's boy,
[2:25:55] Billy's son. They had a breakfast with
[2:25:58] President
[2:26:00] Trump. He come out of that. He was um a
[2:26:03] reporter was talking to him and he said,
[2:26:05] "This has to be a move of
[2:26:10] God. This has to
[2:26:12] be a move of
[2:26:14] God." And you ought to seen them. There
[2:26:16] was 40 or 50 preachers in that room with
[2:26:19] at the White House. They were saying
[2:26:21] that that God was devoid of the White
[2:26:23] House the last four years, which he was,
[2:26:26] but he's still devoid. But he's under a
[2:26:28] new guise
[2:26:29] now.
[2:26:32] Remember the twins?
[2:26:35] They looked alike, but one was of a
[2:26:37] different material.
[2:26:39] That's why folks, we thank God we had a
[2:26:42] prophet to warn us where that system is
[2:26:46] and what it's going to do to us. That
[2:26:48] denominational system will take them
[2:26:50] into chaos. But what it's going to do is
[2:26:54] it's going to squeeze us out of here
[2:26:56] because we know the truth and the truth
[2:26:59] will set you free. I'm not worried about
[2:27:00] what's going on up there, but you look
[2:27:01] and you see the sign. The Bible says
[2:27:03] that peace, peace, there'll be sudden
[2:27:05] destruction. The Bible says craft will
[2:27:07] prosper. All these different things are
[2:27:10] going to be
[2:27:11] good,
[2:27:15] wonderful, satisfy the
[2:27:17] sensation of the body. Amen. This is
[2:27:21] good. This is that this must be a move
[2:27:23] of God.
[2:27:25] Even Jensen Franklin right up here in
[2:27:26] Gainesville, he stood up and he said,
[2:27:28] "The reason Trump didn't get shot was
[2:27:31] because of God." And I said, "That's
[2:27:34] absolutely the truth. They just don't
[2:27:37] understand the God that they're dealing
[2:27:39] with." But thank God for truth. It's,
[2:27:41] you know what? That's going to put us in
[2:27:43] a hard
[2:27:45] place.
[2:27:48] Constantine, you know, they've already
[2:27:50] said that he was he's acting just like
[2:27:52] Constantine. What did Constantine do? He
[2:27:55] persecuted Christians.
[2:27:58] 68 million people were killed under the
[2:28:00] Christian crusade. So much said by
[2:28:04] Constantine. And he was absolutely
[2:28:05] killing the true bride.
[2:28:09] It's a wonderful time, but it's a hard
[2:28:10] time. But I'm telling you, you either
[2:28:11] get in or you're going to be out. Amen.
[2:28:14] The arc door is fixing to close. I'm
[2:28:16] sorry, but God bless you. May he be
[2:28:20] resurrected again in your life. May he
[2:28:24] resurrect your body because thank you
[2:28:26] for sitting here for all this time. I
[2:28:27] appreciate that. I don't I'm not going
[2:28:29] to say it won't happen again. But
[2:28:31] anyway, go ahead. God bless you. Thank
[2:28:34] you everybody. Let's worship the Lord
[2:28:36] just for a few minutes. Like a burning
[2:28:39] prison I found. No need and proise.
[2:28:44] Sorrow I fell. Then Jesus came and
[2:28:49] listen to me. And glory to God. He set
[2:28:55] me free. Hey, listen. If you're a free
[2:28:58] man, you can do this.
[2:29:02] If you're free today, you can do this.
[2:29:05] You have no bond. You have nothing
[2:29:07] attached to you. The chains of the devil
[2:29:10] is off of you now. Just accept it. Glory
[2:29:14] to God. He set me free. I was dead and
[2:29:18] now I'm alive.
[2:29:21] I come from God and now I'm going back
[2:29:23] to God. I may not act like I'm 100%, but
[2:29:27] God's helping me to get there. My feet
[2:29:30] are the word of God is clean.
[2:29:34] There's no dirt in the nation.
[2:29:37] Lord God, he set me
[2:29:41] free. He set me free. And he broke the
[2:29:46] bonds of ris for me. I'm going down my
[2:29:52] Jesus to see. Oh, glory to God. He set
[2:29:58] me free.
[2:30:01] [Music]
[2:30:02] and things I confound. You can't get rid
[2:30:06] of it
[2:30:07] today. Turn me
[2:30:10] around. Daily I'm working. I pray
[2:30:15] you. Glory to God. I'm going through
[2:30:20] life. Oh, he set me free. Oh, he set me
[2:30:25] free.
[2:30:27] He broke the bonds of prison for me. I'm
[2:30:33] glorify Jesus to see for glory to God.
[2:30:39] He said
[2:30:41] now I am climbing higher each day.
[2:30:47] Darkness of night has drifted away. Like
[2:30:53] your plane on higher
[2:30:57] ground. Glory to God.
[2:31:01] I found he
[2:31:05] set the right hand. He set me free. He
[2:31:10] set me free. Prison
[2:31:12] glory. I'm glory bound. He set me free.
[2:31:17] How do you mean that? Glory to God. He
[2:31:21] set free. Oh, you're going to be the
[2:31:22] happiest people in the world. He set me
[2:31:25] free. Yes. He set me free. He broke up
[2:31:30] on the prison for
[2:31:33] me. I
[2:31:35] glorify my
[2:31:38] Jesus. And glory to God. Jesus set me
[2:31:43] free. Say your time as your kn. He set
[2:31:46] me free. Yes. He set me free. He broke
[2:31:51] the bond
[2:31:53] [Music]
[2:31:56] rising my Jesus to see and glory to God.
[2:32:02] He set me free. Once like a burden
[2:32:08] prison I dwell. No freedom from my
[2:32:13] sorrow I fell. Then Jesus came and
[2:32:18] listened to me.
