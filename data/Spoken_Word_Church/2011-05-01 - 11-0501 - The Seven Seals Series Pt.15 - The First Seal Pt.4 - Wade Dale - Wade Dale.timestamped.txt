[0:00] no headset so don't be uh don't be
[0:02] alarmed but they're trying to get the
[0:04] computer fixed so we can pipe the voice
[0:10] in Revelations chapter 6 now we're still
[0:13] studying on the first seal all
[0:18] right I saw when the lamb opened one of
[0:20] the
[0:21] seals heard as it were the noise of
[0:26] Thunder what brother R say thunder was
[0:28] was the voice of God when seal
[0:30] break one of the four beasts says come
[0:34] and
[0:35] see now we're going to get into that a
[0:37] little bit later who was one of those
[0:40] beasts it was the lion cuz the lion was
[0:43] the one that went out first it's lion ox
[0:46] man and Eagle right so the lion roared
[0:50] said come and
[0:51] see and I saw and behold a white horse
[0:54] and he that sat on him had a bow and a
[0:56] crown was given unto him and he went
[0:59] forth con
[1:01] conquering and to conquer which was not
[1:04] just conquering at that moment but to
[1:07] conquer he has continued to
[1:10] conquer so that when that seal open
[1:13] brother Rand said when the seal
[1:15] opens what happens a war breaks out a
[1:20] spiritual war a plague falls on the
[1:23] people they become spiritually dead then
[1:25] there's a Warfare between the live
[1:27] Christian and the and the live devil
[1:30] because the
[1:32] Power
[1:33] of
[1:35] Choice The Power of Choice there's your
[1:39] Battleground where does that come from
[1:41] right
[1:42] here right here your choice oh choose
[1:47] you this
[1:49] day Moses said Joshua said who you were
[1:54] serve but Power was given assemble his
[1:57] horse you're going to see this horse all
[1:59] the way through cuz a horse represents
[2:01] the power all right and behind you of
[2:03] course it's all covered up we may bring
[2:06] it out here next
[2:07] Sunday but um it shows the four horse
[2:11] riders in that drawing that the brother
[2:13] from Brother Ronnie did from the
[2:15] philippins but you got a man on a horse
[2:18] a horse is a
[2:19] power now who gives the who gives a man
[2:23] setting on him the power the horse does
[2:26] the horse is the power the horse power
[2:28] that drives okay but the guy sitting on
[2:31] the horse had a bow and no arrows and
[2:34] the crown was given
[2:36] him by who the
[2:38] people all
[2:42] right so let's go back to Matthew
[2:44] 24 just read a few scriptures and then
[2:47] we'll comment Matthew
[2:54] 24 cuz we got to set this basis to get
[2:56] into this seal because we're going to
[2:58] look at the natural part of of it
[3:00] spiritual part of it and then what's
[3:02] going to happen later on
[3:06] right verse 5
[3:09] 245 for many shall come in my name and
[3:12] say I am Christ and shall
[3:15] deceive many all right you got a man
[3:17] sitting on a white horse this guy has a
[3:20] bow which to me that would show that
[3:23] even brother Bram in his early Ministry
[3:25] was was showing that that was the Holy
[3:27] Ghost because he had a bow
[3:30] and he had a crown so this was an
[3:32] important person it wasn't just somebody
[3:34] that was sitting on a horse that looked
[3:36] dead no he probably had that bow and he
[3:39] was he threw that bow out like this you
[3:42] know but the mystery was there was no
[3:44] arrows there all right there was nothing
[3:47] to give this man but he had a bow and he
[3:49] had a crown right he looked kind of
[3:52] prestigious all right that's what
[3:54] happened in the first church age brother
[3:55] Rand said all the back there in NAA and
[3:58] places like that there was uh a group of
[4:01] aristocrats got in all right so this is
[4:04] just a common part that happened on the
[4:06] earth during the time of the first
[4:08] church age cuz really the first church
[4:10] age is when this white horse rider began
[4:12] to ride out now let's read in in second
[4:16] Thessalonians
[4:18] 2 now this is Paul in ad 54 so from ad30
[4:23] when Jesus spoke these
[4:27] words in Matthew let's just get ad33 cuz
[4:31] it was right at the end of his ministry
[4:36] ad33 watch what
[4:39] happened verse three let's just let's
[4:43] just read the
[4:45] whole 2 Thessalonians not first 2
[4:48] Thessalonians
[4:50] 2 now we beseech you Brethren by the
[4:53] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by
[4:54] our gathering together unto him of
[4:57] course that's the song We Sing We Are
[4:59] gather Gathering Together unto him that
[5:01] you be not soon shaken in mind or be
[5:04] troubled now what's he telling he's
[5:06] telling you what he telling you there's
[5:08] something coming there's a problem
[5:11] coming here so don't be shaken troubled
[5:15] neither by Spirit or by
[5:18] word nor by letter as from us as that
[5:22] the day of Christ is at
[5:24] hand is at
[5:27] hand I thought the day of Christ was
[5:30] before Paul came you understand what I'm
[5:33] saying all right the day of Christ no
[5:36] but computer's doing something over
[5:39] here but the day of Christ he says is at
[5:44] hand which is when now all
[5:49] right let no man deceive you by any
[5:52] means for that day shall not come except
[5:55] there come a falling away first and that
[5:58] man of sin and be revealed the son of
[6:02] predition now let's just look at what
[6:06] starting here in a baby form it's people
[6:09] getting in the
[6:10] church um I see us coming up in about 2
[6:14] or 300 years cuz you know
[6:18] 300 is when they had the first Nan
[6:21] Council but Paul could see that man of
[6:24] sin already start cuz remember when
[6:27] Jesus came back on the day of Pentecost
[6:29] and
[6:30] 8033 the devil came right with him and
[6:33] got on that horse and started riding
[6:36] okay Satan's pretty quick remember he's
[6:40] like he's just he's like the light he's
[6:43] not light but he's like the light I mean
[6:44] he's fast he's
[6:46] quick excuse me for that day shall not
[6:48] come except to come A Falling Away
[6:52] first okay Falling Away first which was
[6:56] what I know I'm walking out of the
[6:57] camera but in that fourth what happened
[7:00] if you look at your church ages there
[7:01] was a great falling away in the natural
[7:04] sense but it's also the spiritual sense
[7:06] but now there is a great Falling
[7:09] Away Now
[7:12] spiritually which is way worse than
[7:14] naturally John Paul was not talking
[7:15] about a natural Falling
[7:19] Away look churches even message churches
[7:22] are getting so big they're getting
[7:23] bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
[7:26] but there's supposed to be a great
[7:28] Falling Away
[7:31] maybe it's not
[7:32] in
[7:34] numbers but in people that are really
[7:36] born again right sorry who opposes and
[7:41] exalted let's go back for that day shall
[7:44] not come except there come a falling
[7:45] away first and that man of sin be
[7:49] revealed the son of
[7:51] predition how I wrote in my Bible how by
[7:55] this message right the message is the
[7:57] only time
[8:00] that the son of predition can really be
[8:03] like like we're going to read in the
[8:04] fourth seal he finally gets a name his
[8:07] name was death right
[8:09] here but the symbol was that he was
[8:12] hidden behind a white righteous church
[8:15] right but in that fourth seal when that
[8:17] man begins to ride out that Pale Horse
[8:22] the Bible says Called Death give him a
[8:24] name okay well Paul's giving him a name
[8:27] here but that's a mystery
[8:29] because look who opposes and exalteth
[8:31] him
[8:33] exalteth himself above all that is
[8:35] called
[8:37] God or that is worshiped so that he as
[8:44] God as God not light now he you know he
[8:47] wants to be
[8:48] life Christ in the Old Testament this is
[8:51] setting as God sth in the temple of
[8:56] God Church churches
[9:00] buildings
[9:01] people showing himself that he is
[9:06] God not want to be right here is the
[9:10] effect of all this other that's been
[9:13] that's been going through remember you
[9:15] not that when I was yet with you I told
[9:17] you these things that was ad 54 one of
[9:21] the most powerful ages that ever was the
[9:25] Ephesian Church remember Ephesus and us
[9:28] are supposed to be the two book ends the
[9:31] we're supposed to get back to that right
[9:34] we're supposed to be just like they were
[9:35] in the first age and then these seals
[9:38] are to open to show us exactly what's
[9:40] going on okay but we're supposed to get
[9:42] back to where Paul was standing which
[9:45] was at the faith of the fathers up there
[9:47] with all the virtues working
[9:50] right remember you not that when I was
[9:52] yet with you I told you these
[9:54] things and now you know what withholdeth
[9:58] that he might be
[9:59] revealed in his
[10:02] time for the mystery of iniquity do all
[10:07] ready
[10:09] work now we were talking about this
[10:11] brother Jim Pinkston and I and listen to
[10:13] this only a
[10:15] prophet could break this down only a
[10:19] prophet only a word Prophet could break
[10:21] this down because you not going to read
[10:22] it like this for the mystery of all
[10:25] right we're going to read this without
[10:26] Revelation for the mystery of iniquity
[10:27] that already work on only he who now
[10:30] leth will let until he be taken out of
[10:32] the way now to you and I to me and
[10:35] people that read that you can put the
[10:37] Satan you put Satan in there cuz he's
[10:39] going to be taken out of the way but you
[10:41] come with brother Brandon brother
[10:42] brandham reads it like this only he
[10:46] God who now lth will let in other words
[10:49] he's letting things go until he the
[10:53] prophet said the
[10:56] bride but you got to remember one thing
[10:58] he said now now she is
[11:03] him cuz that don't say she that says he
[11:07] right he right brother Brown said that's
[11:10] the bride Christ he said that's the
[11:13] bride until he be taken out of the way
[11:15] in other words he's going to let this
[11:17] thing go
[11:18] on God is until he the bride the the
[11:22] real church I don't even want to say
[11:24] church anymore it's
[11:27] bride wife
[11:29] has been taken out of the way but see
[11:31] she is him right so now we can say we
[11:34] are what's the same scripture that
[11:36] speaks of the what bridegroom speaks of
[11:38] the Bride so she is him so brother
[11:41] brandham could as a
[11:43] prophet could tell us these things
[11:46] and sometimes we probably scratch our
[11:49] head wondering why
[11:51] but I can see now that's how that fits
[11:55] in
[11:55] here and then shall that Wicked be
[11:59] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[12:02] with the spirit of his mouth if you want
[12:04] to know what page that page 116 of the
[12:07] seal book is when he said he who leth
[12:08] will let until he be taken away we'll
[12:10] read it in just a
[12:12] minute and shall destroy with the
[12:14] brightness of his
[12:16] coming all
[12:20] right cuz he's going to consume him with
[12:22] the spirit of his mouth the word all
[12:27] right bride is the final voice to the
[12:29] final a cuz Paul is saying a great fall
[12:32] of the Way's got to
[12:35] come and that man of sin will be
[12:37] revealed and man of sin was never
[12:39] revealed until that Prophet opened that
[12:40] first seal and showed that that white
[12:42] horse rider was the Antichrist riding
[12:45] through the
[12:46] church even him verse five whose coming
[12:49] is after the working of Satan with all
[12:51] power and signs and lying wonders and
[12:54] with all deceivableness of
[12:56] unrighteousness in them that perish
[12:58] because they received not the love of
[13:00] the truth that they might be
[13:02] saved and for this cause God shall send
[13:05] them who the
[13:07] church nominal Message
[13:11] Church strong delusion that they should
[13:13] believe a lie that they all might be
[13:16] damned who believe not the truth but had
[13:19] pleasure and unrighteousness but now
[13:22] watch Paul but we are bound to give
[13:24] thanks always to God for you Brethren
[13:26] beloved of the Lord because God hath
[13:27] from the beginning
[13:29] chosen you to Salvation through
[13:31] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[13:35] of the truth so there is somebody that's
[13:37] going to
[13:39] believe that
[13:41] truth and I believe they're here on the
[13:43] earth now all right let's go to 116
[13:46] let's read
[13:48] that if you don't have your if you don't
[13:50] have one like this
[13:51] one it'll be paragraph 85 of the first
[13:57] seal
[14:02] I have a question
[14:05] M that
[14:09] we question I had the same question
[14:13] where are we at verse
[14:17] eight the
[14:22] wicked but in scoffield the original
[14:25] says the Lawless
[14:27] one
[14:30] I don't know Satan's always Capital he's
[14:33] like
[14:35] God Satan the s in Satan is capital I
[14:38] wouldn't put him in their Capital at
[14:42] all but let me tell you something though
[14:45] we're
[14:46] forgetting we're
[14:48] forgetting what we're doing here that's
[14:51] right Satan is the number two man he is
[14:55] the most religious person besides God
[15:00] we think he's the most in the opposite
[15:02] direction well yeah he is but he's right
[15:05] there with God just like this except for
[15:07] in
[15:09] creation let me tell you something what
[15:10] I think about this this is just my
[15:12] opinion you know the reason that that
[15:15] God lets Satan continue and do the
[15:17] things he does you think if if I was
[15:19] God and I saw Satan and I knew it before
[15:22] I even made him he was going to do this
[15:25] I never made
[15:27] him right
[15:29] but to fulfill the plan cuz you and I
[15:32] were inside of God the only way to get
[15:34] us
[15:36] out and what is God doing
[15:39] now because
[15:41] remember in a mouth of two or three
[15:44] Witnesses let everything be established
[15:45] remember God cannot cannot make a law
[15:49] and not abide by it by
[15:52] himself he can't say all right in mouth
[15:54] two or three Witnesses let everything be
[15:57] established
[15:59] and then him not do
[16:01] that all right now when God condemns
[16:05] Satan at the end when everything becomes
[16:07] natural when I'm when I say natural when
[16:09] this the whole scene plays out we know
[16:12] in God's mind it's already played out
[16:14] but it's going to there is going to be a
[16:15] white Throne judgment there is going to
[16:16] be a playing out of this scene where we
[16:20] stand in judgment with Jesus Christ as
[16:22] almighty God and the people come before
[16:25] and actually Satan is destroyed before
[16:27] them
[16:29] brother Bown said the Holy Ghost is a
[16:31] gentleman right very
[16:34] timy but in the mouth of two or three
[16:37] Witnesses
[16:38] God is proving to
[16:42] Satan me and
[16:45] you thr the mouth of trly witnesses he's
[16:48] going to have Satan is going to have to
[16:50] witness and so are
[16:53] you right and God's already see in God's
[16:57] mind is already done so so but he's got
[16:59] to have some
[17:01] witnesses what he's doing now is he's
[17:03] showing Satan that he's
[17:06] God God is God right he's proving to
[17:10] Satan because he thought so much of that
[17:12] man that he made what about Adam why
[17:15] didn't you if we were God why didn't we
[17:17] just say okay Adam you you you boooo
[17:19] I'll just do away with you and I'll do
[17:21] away with Eve and I'll just make me some
[17:23] more kids that are better than you are
[17:27] no God can't do that that's right he's
[17:30] got to have a
[17:31] witness you and I are going to be the
[17:33] witness to Satan that God can live in
[17:36] human flesh just like he wanted to to
[17:39] start with and make it and make it by
[17:44] what not by God putting you in a tube
[17:46] and pulling you through saying okay
[17:48] lisadell you you made it because of me
[17:50] no you made it because of
[17:51] you so you can tell Satan then Satan I
[17:54] made a choice I am a witness that God
[17:58] can can live like he wanted to live in
[18:00] human flesh I am that witness and you
[18:03] know what that's what's going to condemn
[18:04] Satan
[18:05] right because we destroy him you didn't
[18:08] read that we destroy him with the with
[18:11] the power of the
[18:14] mouth right right here Spirit of his
[18:17] mouth and shall destroy with the
[18:18] brightness of his coming where is the
[18:21] coming of Jesus
[18:23] Christ in the people physically he's not
[18:27] going to come onto this Earth Earth
[18:28] until what the
[18:31] Millennium so what's he doing he's
[18:33] proving to Satan that somebody can make
[18:36] this thing right here pointing to the
[18:39] Bible stay
[18:41] alive in
[18:43] flesh like that brother was preaching
[18:45] Wednesday night which was really good it
[18:46] was the flesh God in flesh flesh human
[18:50] flesh right here this flesh not another
[18:54] the way I see it too the natural typing
[18:56] the spiritual a man want a white that
[18:58] wants him oh absolutely no doubt that's
[19:02] the choice not because she has to
[19:04] because she wants him and Satan standing
[19:06] you know threes a crowd but Satan's
[19:08] standing there and you're going to be
[19:10] the witness that's just the way I
[19:11] believe it you think well it's got all
[19:13] this you know you put Theology and all
[19:14] this and you put the bible let me just
[19:16] put it in a in a simple
[19:18] form God created Satan Satan made a
[19:22] choice but God created Satan to be the
[19:25] anointed one to help him in all the
[19:27] things that he done and he turned him
[19:31] down Satan says okay there's no way I
[19:34] can
[19:34] create he's smart enough to know that he
[19:37] can't create but once God creates
[19:39] something then Satan can come and
[19:41] pervert it so that's what he's been
[19:43] doing he's just pervert it he saw God
[19:46] make an eternal
[19:48] word he was standing there the prophet
[19:50] said when he said let there be let there
[19:52] be let there be that's why he knew the
[19:53] principles of life cuz he said let the
[19:55] fish and the foul multiply and replenish
[19:58] the Earth where Satan knew he didn't
[19:59] have a seed
[20:00] himself so he perverted the the Beast
[20:03] seed got into the Beast and what the
[20:05] Beast was just doing something
[20:07] natural but he motivated that Beast to
[20:10] do what he did with Eve and the seed
[20:12] would mingle and then what did God do he
[20:14] separated all that that didn't separate
[20:16] Satan cuz Satan stayed right there
[20:18] beside of him but God is proving this is
[20:21] the witness two or three mouth of two or
[20:24] three so it's going to be you and the
[20:26] devil the devil's going to have to
[20:27] witness one day cuz the Bible says every
[20:29] knee shall bow and every tongue shall
[20:33] confess Satan one day when we all stand
[20:35] and we all take a body change see that's
[20:37] that's something we were talking about
[20:38] this weekend we're talking about God in
[20:41] flesh Satan when we get finished with
[20:43] these seals when we get down to that
[20:44] four seal that's an incarnate devil
[20:47] there is a man standing on the
[20:50] earth I want you to keep this in back of
[20:52] your mind Sister Barbara had her hand up
[20:54] and I'm going to try to hurry and get
[20:55] her get her
[20:56] question keep this in in mind that is
[21:00] what you and I are here for we're here
[21:03] to prove to Satan that God's going to do
[21:06] what he done right and that God will
[21:09] incarnate himself not just take June
[21:12] Dale or Peggy Dale or whoever and just
[21:14] say well I'm going to do no he's going
[21:15] to he's going to totally consume that
[21:20] being and then this will be the Flesh of
[21:23] God Satan don't know how to do that
[21:26] right Satan is a copycat remember
[21:29] because he's incarnate after we leave
[21:32] brother brandham said what we go
[21:37] up right up through the
[21:40] ceiling
[21:45] prob probably say something about the
[21:47] devil knocking on the door
[21:49] down anyway all right when he when we go
[21:53] up what happens Satan comes down and
[21:55] incarnates a pope and he is is
[21:58] Incarnate Satan on the face of this
[22:01] Earth he is the most evil person God
[22:04] sorry Satan has finally got what he
[22:07] wanted he wanted to indwell human flesh
[22:10] but he can't do it because this right
[22:13] here has not been totally
[22:15] revealed once this word has been totally
[22:18] revealed in a group of human beings and
[22:21] they one thing left people and that's
[22:23] death that's the only thing we can we
[22:26] lack destroying and that's death
[22:29] death is Satan's little trunk card but
[22:34] even when Jesus died people continue to
[22:37] keep dying but the ones that died in the
[22:39] faith God's going to raise back up
[22:43] Satan's waiting for that to
[22:44] happen when he sees that happen he'll
[22:46] say aha I know how to do it now and he
[22:48] comes right down into a pope and becomes
[22:50] a very religious
[22:53] highly right there where it says says as
[22:55] God he will be he it himself showing
[22:59] himself that he is God that's right
[23:02] because remember now even the pope when
[23:05] when they uh whatever they do to a PO
[23:07] one dies and the other one comes in and
[23:10] God incarnates that man they say God
[23:12] comes down and incarnates that man so
[23:15] they're close to it now but when they
[23:17] get Satan Superman that's when Satan's
[23:19] going to come right in and incarnate
[23:21] that man and he's going to rule the
[23:22] world with an iron fish and we're not
[23:24] going to be here sister
[23:26] Barber what say it's pretty much I love
[23:29] but you're just thought that Wicked one
[23:31] was the Antichrist because he was
[23:33] sitting inle as God and
[23:37] exactly even in the Bible one of the
[23:40] whole this whole few minutes were to
[23:43] show you
[23:45] that even the Bible even I'm going to
[23:49] say this let me step out on the
[23:51] Lim because God honor
[23:54] Satan if he didn't he'd destroy him if
[23:57] he didn't he would let him get close to
[24:01] it right now would you not you know
[24:03] God's not sitting up there thinking you
[24:04] know well he knows what the guy's doing
[24:06] and going to do and the whole plan but
[24:10] God is honoring that man cuz God created
[24:12] and now how would be like me and and and
[24:14] Donnie you know I thought enough of him
[24:18] to bring him adopt him into my family
[24:20] and give him part of a business you know
[24:22] and then one day say no you're not worth
[24:24] it no he brought Satan into his economy
[24:28] cuz Satan was not
[24:29] Satan remember he was the anointed chff
[24:32] he was a worship Angel he became Satan
[24:35] when all that junk that he did Happ okay
[24:38] so let's don't look at Satan as being so
[24:40] far away and being something so evil and
[24:43] hideous now we know he is he's the
[24:45] creator of evil he don't create but he
[24:47] is the perverter of good which makes it
[24:50] evil see brother brandham even the
[24:51] little things he would tell us he'd say
[24:54] he'd say okay he said now you and you
[24:56] and your wife you have relations under
[24:59] under the the umbrella of the wedding
[25:02] there's no
[25:04] problem God said bed not be defiled
[25:07] everything's
[25:08] honorable but you do that with somebody
[25:10] else's wife see now what have you done
[25:13] you still male and
[25:15] female still male and female still two
[25:17] people doing the same thing that you and
[25:19] your wife did it's just out from under a
[25:20] law the law of God or the law of even
[25:23] principle of a human being God didn't
[25:26] want that to happen I've said many times
[25:28] God didn't want divorce to happen
[25:30] because he knew not only that it's
[25:32] scripturally wrong but he knew we
[25:34] couldn't handle it you look at split
[25:36] marriages and see I don't care if you
[25:38] have even a very amicable one there's
[25:40] something in there that just gnaws at
[25:42] you all the
[25:44] time ain't that the truth ain't that the
[25:47] truth ain't that the truth and all of us
[25:51] have not don't matter if we're married
[25:52] two or three times if we've done
[25:53] everything anything outside of marriage
[25:55] we're we're guilty
[25:58] so yes ma'am has Satan ever incarnated a
[26:03] very evil man in the world like Hitler
[26:06] at the time he was he just anoints okay
[26:09] he just anoints he will not be
[26:11] incarnated until this right here cuz
[26:13] brother R said he incarnates a pope he
[26:15] becomes the Satan incarnate Satan
[26:19] Superman now we think he's Satan
[26:21] Superman now which he is which is
[26:22] developing into that all right but he's
[26:25] not the one he's not what Satan wants
[26:27] yet right you know why cuz you and I are
[26:29] still here that's right see people
[26:31] that's what I'm saying we are the
[26:32] witness we're the witness that God we
[26:36] God is protecting us look read that
[26:38] again for the mystery of iniquity does
[26:40] already work so it's already working y
[26:44] it's already infiltrating
[26:46] itself until only he God who now leth
[26:52] will
[26:53] let he's letting it happen he's letting
[26:56] Satan have his way have his why for a
[26:59] witness cuz one day he's going to say
[27:03] Satan these people is what I wanted
[27:07] these are the ones I wanted the ones
[27:09] that take a body chain he can point
[27:10] right at them and say look at there they
[27:12] destroyed you standing in human
[27:15] flesh right you have absolutely
[27:18] destroyed every effect there's only one
[27:20] power Satan has over us right now and
[27:21] that's us getting
[27:22] older sure he can play with your mind
[27:25] and he can he can affect your choices in
[27:27] on a daily basis and we may sin and do
[27:29] things wrong but I'm not talking about
[27:31] big sin I'm well Sin is Sin but I'm
[27:33] talking about we don't go out smoke
[27:34] gamble drink and cuss and do those
[27:35] things I hope not all right but we do
[27:38] have bad thoughts wrong thoughts and
[27:40] stuff like that and we do sometimes get
[27:41] a little ill and agitated and all things
[27:44] like that but you know what that's
[27:45] motivated by
[27:47] Satan but as far as incarnate someone
[27:50] he'll incarnate at the end when he gets
[27:52] in he cannot incarnate until God shows
[27:55] himself incarnated in human flesh FL you
[27:58] and I Believers that's we so
[28:03] bad CR The Rock we had done that yet
[28:06] that's right when he gets in the car
[28:09] he's going to do some horrible things
[28:11] because remember Bible says CR the rocks
[28:14] to fall on see this is all under the
[28:16] first seal think about what's going on
[28:18] going to what think about what was
[28:20] released after this seal
[28:22] open okay this is this is awful enough
[28:25] on the bad side but on the good side
[28:28] we're going to get to where you and I
[28:31] and then shall that Wicked be revealed
[28:33] whom the Lord shall consume with the
[28:35] spirit of his mouth and I wrote bride
[28:38] final Voice final age in my Bible with
[28:40] the brightness of his coming now if
[28:41] you'll go
[28:43] back in the Old Testament remember in
[28:46] the Old Testament God promised that the
[28:48] light of the
[28:50] Moon would be seven times brighter in
[28:53] the end time that who's the moon the
[28:54] moon's always the bright remember the
[28:56] sun is the sun is the bride the Moon is
[28:58] the bridegroom I mean the bridegroom is
[29:01] the sun and the bride is the moon right
[29:03] the Lesser light but in the end time
[29:04] that lesser light will be so bright
[29:06] seven times brighter than the sun we may
[29:10] pick that up it's in Isaiah
[29:12] somewhere let's read it we got time I'll
[29:14] find it cuz I got it marked in my
[29:22] Bible somebody find
[29:26] it
[29:33] that's why I like to go back we'll go
[29:35] back 30 H 30 26 there you go got it
[29:39] right here all
[29:42] right this scripture was the one that
[29:44] was that we read there for 911 too
[29:47] remember 25 and there shall be upon
[29:50] every high mountain and upon every high
[29:51] hills rivers and streams of water in the
[29:53] day of the great Slaughter when the
[29:54] towers fall moreover the light of the
[29:57] moon shall be as the light of the sun
[30:01] coming up to
[30:02] something and the light of the sun shall
[30:05] be Sevenfold now the light of the sun's
[30:06] going to be seven times prior because
[30:08] the son of man's going to be here
[30:10] right in as a light of seven days and
[30:13] the day that the Lord bindeth up the
[30:15] breach of his people and health The
[30:18] Stroke of their
[30:19] wound what's our wound death that's the
[30:23] only thing that can harm us people death
[30:25] right you said well all cancer no what
[30:27] is cancer go to death right death is the
[30:30] main man that we have not been able to
[30:33] handle we can't get a grasp on death
[30:36] somebody just as powerful look like look
[30:39] at um um Paul Anderson up here strongest
[30:42] man in the world one little bitty germ
[30:46] in his kidney killed
[30:49] it one little germ powerful man went
[30:53] down just months he died went down to
[30:56] nothing why well little joury
[30:58] that that little germ was death that's
[31:01] way to go to went to death but now
[31:03] natural death is not what we're worried
[31:05] about in the end time it's spiritual
[31:08] death the prophet says which is millions
[31:10] times worse is to be walking remember
[31:13] they were walking around
[31:14] alive remember it talks about the woman
[31:17] she's dead while she
[31:19] liveth that's the church woman's always
[31:22] a type of the church she's dead while
[31:23] she's
[31:24] alive right all these glamour Queens and
[31:27] stuff you think boy they look so good
[31:28] and they're so no they're dead they're
[31:31] death walking and they'll take you to
[31:33] death
[31:34] too moreover the light of the moon shall
[31:36] be as the light of the sun and the sun's
[31:38] going to be seven times brighter so
[31:39] guess what's going to happen to the moon
[31:41] the M the
[31:42] moon and the brightness of his coming
[31:44] all right let's read this right here
[31:45] before we stop let's let the prophet
[31:49] tell paragraph
[31:52] 85 he gets finished reading that in 2
[31:56] Thessalonians
[31:57] he says I was writing this down
[31:59] quivering and
[32:00] shaking this in paragraph 84 the mystery
[32:03] of iniquity do already work only he who
[32:05] leth will let until he be taken out of
[32:07] the way who he that leth see a mystery
[32:10] everybody got
[32:13] this paragraph 85
[32:16] who got it yes he who he that L it see a
[32:21] mystery the mystery of iniquity way back
[32:23] in that very first church age here here
[32:26] is Paul writing saying that the mystery
[32:28] of iniquity what is Iniquity iniquity is
[32:31] something that you know you ought not to
[32:32] do and you do it anyway and Paul said
[32:35] there is such in the early today in the
[32:37] Earth today workers of iniquity oh if
[32:39] you were going to get to the let's just
[32:41] read that piece just a minute start up a
[32:43] little further third verse let no man
[32:46] deceive you by any means for that day
[32:48] shall not come except there come a
[32:50] falling away first and that he spells it
[32:52] out m a n man it's not a spirit it's a
[32:56] man of sin be revealed the son of
[32:59] predition that's right who opposes and
[33:01] exalted himself above all that's called
[33:03] God or that is worship so that he as God
[33:06] sth in the temple of God showing himself
[33:08] that he is God and brother Brandon
[33:10] quotes remitting sins remember you not
[33:13] that when I was yet with you I told you
[33:15] these things I'd like to have sit under
[33:17] some of his teaching wouldn't you and
[33:19] now you know that with that know what
[33:21] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[33:24] his
[33:25] time what with holding Paul was saying
[33:28] what was withholding was the mystery of
[33:30] that man iniquity until what until
[33:34] what withholding withholdeth that he
[33:38] might be revealed in his time what's his
[33:40] time
[33:41] now everything's point you keep reading
[33:44] this seal book you going to see
[33:45] everything's pointing to these this
[33:46] people right here not the people sitting
[33:48] listening in Jeffersonville in 1963
[33:50] everything in this book is pointing to
[33:51] people that are sitting here right now
[33:53] that's right this age
[33:55] right
[33:57] now then see not then but in his time
[34:01] you see there brother R said not then
[34:03] not during Paul's age but in his time
[34:05] see at the breaking of that
[34:08] seal we'd know exactly what it was who
[34:11] is this man of iniquity who is this man
[34:13] of sin this fellow that's working
[34:15] iniquity but he be revealed in his time
[34:19] now he reads it again listen how he
[34:20] reads it for the mystery of iniquity
[34:22] does already work deceivers you see
[34:25] deceiving the people often to something
[34:27] only he
[34:29] God that lth will let until he the
[34:33] church Christ the bride be taken out of
[34:36] the way and then shall the wicked one be
[34:38] revealed at the breaking of the seal at
[34:41] his time Paul said not in my
[34:45] time but in the time that he'll be
[34:47] revealed when the Lord shall consume
[34:49] with the spirit of his mouth we going to
[34:51] get that after a while the spirit of his
[34:52] mouth Watch what it is and shall destroy
[34:54] with the brightness of his coming even
[34:57] him Who coming is after the workings of
[34:58] Satan him him a man whose working is
[35:01] after the working of
[35:03] Satan with all power and lying wonders
[35:06] and with all deceivable deceivableness
[35:08] of unrighteousness deceiving people by
[35:10] unrighteousness and them that perish not
[35:13] this
[35:15] bride in them that's looking for such a
[35:18] thing because they receive not the love
[35:20] of the truth and didn't say they didn't
[35:22] receive the
[35:25] truth remember what somebody was
[35:26] preaching the other day about love
[35:28] brother Pinkston on Friday night about
[35:30] love and love and the Caps don't ain't
[35:33] because you just darely love everybody
[35:35] and you don't want to you know hug and
[35:36] kiss them all and you think they're all
[35:37] so wonderful that's not that kind of
[35:39] love that Love's
[35:42] corrective if God didn't love us and let
[35:44] a little things happen to us then e what
[35:47] he said we' Bast your children right see
[35:50] right but they receive not the love and
[35:53] I underline that because that's the big
[35:55] deal they did not it didn't say they
[35:58] didn't receive the
[36:00] truth now did it it said it didn't
[36:03] receive the
[36:04] love of the truth and that love there I
[36:07] don't believe is the love like you have
[36:09] for your wife that's agape love that is
[36:12] the love of almighty
[36:14] God and Christ is a truth and Christ is
[36:17] a word but they would rather have a
[36:18] Creed huh that they might be saved and
[36:21] for this cause God has sent them strong
[36:23] delusion that they should believe a a
[36:25] lie should be translated there as I
[36:28] looked in the Lexicon the lie not a li
[36:30] the LIE the same one he told Eve that
[36:33] they might be damned who believe not the
[36:35] truth but had pleasure and
[36:36] unrighteousness what a statement
[36:39] my after the bride is taken away then
[36:42] this man of sin will
[36:44] reveal himself all right we'll have to
[36:47] stop right there because we're out of
[36:49] time but the man of
[36:51] sin don't you believe he's not here
[36:54] because he's come right here to find his
[36:55] Incarnation he's come to this message
[36:57] right here he was standing there that
[37:00] day the prophet broke those seals and he
[37:01] was standing there in a group of people
[37:04] that refuted everything brother brandham
[37:05] said brother brand said he said it's not
[37:07] for you people he said it for another
[37:19] grouth
