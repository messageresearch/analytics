[15:34] things in your name
[15:35] amen so i want to speak on a little
[15:38] topic called
[15:39] breaking out of breaking out of your
[15:40] shell and and again you know how i like
[15:43] to do is just kind of take a little
[15:44] message and break it down and so
[15:46] what what i'm what i'm going to be
[15:48] speaking on this afternoon is the
[15:49] greatest battle ever fought
[15:51] and just to call out some some things
[15:53] maybe just kind of
[15:54] point out some things in that message
[15:56] that brother brown said so
[15:57] when you when you get alone and and you
[16:00] want to just kind of meditate on some
[16:01] things maybe go back and listen to that
[16:02] message and think about
[16:05] um that god has given us the recipe in
[16:07] this hour to overcome
[16:10] but there's something we got to do so
[16:13] let's read and
[16:13] uh brother branham actually read two
[16:15] scriptures when he was when he was
[16:17] reading uh
[16:17] when he preached this sermon i'm just
[16:19] going to read the first one and that's
[16:20] first peter chapter 5
[16:22] verses 8-10 and he said be sober
[16:25] be vigilant because your adversary the
[16:28] devil
[16:29] the adversary of the devil many times we
[16:31] think that our adversary is
[16:33] is people that go to church with us or
[16:35] the minister or
[16:36] our boss and all kinds of things but or
[16:38] maybe the president
[16:40] the president is your adversary the
[16:42] president is not your adversary because
[16:44] you know
[16:44] to be able to fight your adversary
[16:46] correctly you've got to know who your
[16:48] adversary is
[16:49] you've got to know if if the president
[16:51] is your adversary then you would be able
[16:53] to fight him by being a republican or
[16:54] democrat or join the right party
[16:56] but if you know your adversary is the
[16:58] devil then you can know and understand
[17:01] how to defeat the devil
[17:04] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[17:07] whom he may devour
[17:10] whom resist steadfast in the face in the
[17:13] faith
[17:13] do you know you can resist the devil
[17:16] many times we go through life and we
[17:18] forget that we can resist the devil
[17:21] resist steadfast fast in the faith
[17:24] knowing that the same afflictions are
[17:26] accomplished in your brethren that are
[17:27] in the world
[17:29] but the god of all grace who hath called
[17:32] us unto his eternal glory by christ
[17:34] jesus
[17:35] after that ye have suffered a while make
[17:37] you perfect
[17:39] established strengthen
[17:42] settle you my what a promise and what a
[17:45] blessing you may be seated the lord had
[17:47] his blessing to the
[17:48] reading of the word after that you have
[17:50] suffered a while make you perfect
[17:52] establish strength and settle you after
[17:55] you have suffered a while
[17:56] so you know brother brown when he as he
[17:58] was preaching this message the greatest
[18:00] battle ever fought maybe
[18:01] one thing to kind of point out is that
[18:03] you have to fight a battle you remember
[18:04] when
[18:05] in the israelites when they went into
[18:07] the promised land in the old testament
[18:08] they crossed over the river
[18:10] and they got into the promised land and
[18:12] and they thought maybe
[18:13] maybe in their mind it's just going to
[18:15] be a bed of roses but as soon as they
[18:17] crossed over then
[18:18] now they've got they've got the city of
[18:20] jericho and they've got to drive out all
[18:21] the moabites and the amorites and
[18:24] it turned in there was a battle that
[18:25] they had to fight and you've got to
[18:27] fight a battle to get
[18:29] every inch of ground every again every
[18:32] promise of god that god has given to you
[18:34] he's laid out all these promises but you
[18:36] can't just
[18:37] sit on your uh in your chair in your
[18:40] easy chair and expect everything to be
[18:41] handled
[18:42] handed to you everything is a battle so
[18:44] we are in a battle and we're warring
[18:46] against the devil
[18:48] now now brother branham as he preached
[18:49] this sermon he called out at the
[18:50] beginning of this message he said
[18:52] and and this is maybe the the crux of
[18:54] the whole message
[18:56] is that a devil is almost harmless until
[18:58] he can have
[18:59] something to work in he's got to have
[19:02] something to work in
[19:03] and he said you remember those devils
[19:05] that were cast out of legion they had
[19:07] they
[19:07] they wanted to do more mischievous so
[19:10] they wanted to go
[19:11] in the hogs you remember that story how
[19:14] when jesus cast out the devils from
[19:15] legion they said let us they didn't want
[19:17] to just go
[19:18] out of the of the person but they wanted
[19:20] to go into something
[19:21] so that they could continue to cause
[19:23] mischief they wanted to go into the hogs
[19:25] and then they ran those hogs down into
[19:27] the sea
[19:28] once they got in the hogs and that's the
[19:29] same way that the devils will do
[19:31] any person once they get inside of you
[19:33] and begin to work in your life then they
[19:35] will run you down into the ground
[19:37] they'll destroy your
[19:38] life we've seen so many evidences of
[19:40] that
[19:41] people in hollywood showing up in the in
[19:42] the magazines that you read in the store
[19:44] of
[19:44] their lives and wrecks and ruins people
[19:46] that you know because once the devil
[19:48] gets a hold of you he'll just
[19:49] run run you right down into the ground
[19:51] just like he he ran those hogs
[19:53] and he said brother brown said see so
[19:54] devils must have something to work in
[19:57] somebody to work through now now so
[20:00] we were actually talking about that
[20:02] recently what if you were out in the
[20:03] middle of the arctic or
[20:04] what if you went to alaska would you
[20:06] still be able to get the coronavirus
[20:08] if you're not away from anybody if
[20:09] you're away from everybody would you
[20:11] still be able to get sick
[20:12] would you still be able to get all the
[20:13] different kind of diseases see the
[20:15] devil's got to have somebody to work
[20:16] through
[20:17] and that's how he goes from one person
[20:19] even even with coals and flus and all
[20:21] those kind of things he's got to go from
[20:23] one person to another person
[20:25] the devil's got to have somebody to work
[20:27] through now now
[20:28] wouldn't it be wonderful to be able to
[20:31] find the secret
[20:32] to the devil would not be able to work
[20:35] through
[20:36] you you know brother brahma said that's
[20:38] a promise in the message that
[20:39] you can get so close to god and to the
[20:42] devil's
[20:42] just kind of walking around how can i
[20:44] what can i do to this person
[20:46] no matter what i do to this person no
[20:48] matter what i say what kind of thoughts
[20:50] i put in their mind
[20:51] they're resistant to me they're
[20:52] resistant to anything that i say
[20:54] anything that i throw at them i can't do
[20:56] anything to them
[20:57] and so there's a promise in the message
[20:59] that you can somebody's going to come to
[21:01] that place where the devil can't do
[21:03] anything to them that's a promise in the
[21:05] message somebody now it might only be
[21:08] like a handful of people as brother
[21:10] brown alluded to and many times
[21:12] as it was in the days of noah where only
[21:14] eight souls were saved and then he would
[21:16] type it to enoch and it was only one
[21:18] one to eight so maybe just a few people
[21:21] but somebody
[21:22] somebody is going to come to a place
[21:24] where the devil can't do
[21:25] anything to you so we're in a battle
[21:28] we're in a battle and
[21:29] and and the devil is trying to find
[21:31] somebody to work through
[21:32] but you see also god is trying to work
[21:35] finding somebody to work through
[21:37] you think about two and satan in the
[21:39] millennium brother brown said he would
[21:41] be
[21:41] bound by chains of circumstance and the
[21:43] circumstances
[21:44] are that there would be nobody for him
[21:46] to work through in the millennium nobody
[21:48] that he could find to work through until
[21:50] the end of that millennium and then you
[21:51] have the battle of gog and magog when
[21:52] he's loosed for just a little bit of
[21:53] season
[21:55] so brother brahma says one night he says
[21:58] what drew me to the conclusion here
[22:00] as and the beginning of this sermon as
[22:02] he as he's speaking he says i was
[22:04] standing with brother wood
[22:05] and brother sotheman now now now pay
[22:07] attention to how he kind of lays the
[22:09] framework
[22:10] to the greatest battle ever fall he
[22:12] begins to look to the heavens
[22:14] and he begins to look to the stars and
[22:16] he says i was standing with brother wood
[22:18] and brother soffman
[22:20] it was about 10 o'clock at night and i
[22:21] was looking up towards the sky and a
[22:23] great all came over me and i said just
[22:26] look
[22:27] all that great heavenly host and i said
[22:30] everything
[22:30] is perfectly in harmony
[22:34] and you think you think now thousands of
[22:37] years ago
[22:38] in the days of enoch and and uh early on
[22:41] and
[22:41] and and you know four or five thousand
[22:44] years ago you'd be able to look up into
[22:45] the sky
[22:46] and actually see the milky way and all
[22:48] of its glory and all those kind of
[22:50] things
[22:50] and and they would look to the skies
[22:52] brother brown said that was god's first
[22:54] bible
[22:55] and the sky would tell the story of
[22:57] redemption
[22:58] and and now now you go out into the
[23:01] night sky
[23:02] and and when we go out at night where we
[23:04] live we look up and the the lights of
[23:06] man the man-made lights have kind of
[23:08] dimmed the night sky and you can't
[23:09] really see it the way
[23:11] that they could see it back then i
[23:12] really wish that we could
[23:14] but if you could you know they they were
[23:16] so in tuned with the way that the sky
[23:18] looked and the position of all the
[23:20] planets and everything's that
[23:21] the magi were even so they they knew
[23:24] when something special was coming on the
[23:25] earth because they could see the
[23:26] alignment of those
[23:27] of those planets and the star they they
[23:29] knew that exactly where it was going to
[23:31] be happening and they followed that star
[23:33] to jerusalem
[23:34] but the lights have become in that isn't
[23:36] that the same way that the lights of the
[23:38] tree of knowledge that that
[23:40] light of knowledge has dimmed in this
[23:42] day in this hour
[23:44] the light of the gospel but yet there's
[23:46] still a little shining light brother i'm
[23:47] saying
[23:48] remember when he drew out the seven
[23:49] church edges he said i left a little
[23:51] light because it had gotten
[23:52] so dark but yet there's still a little
[23:55] light left
[23:56] but see he was looking up at the sky to
[23:59] see the great harmony that god had put
[24:01] into place
[24:02] how the sun and the moon and all the
[24:04] planets in their position
[24:05] were in harmony and knew their position
[24:07] and knew knew what they were supposed to
[24:09] be doing
[24:10] we'll kind of put it like that knew knew
[24:12] their place
[24:13] and they were in their place and they
[24:14] were accomplishing a purpose
[24:16] and he said brother brown said in that
[24:18] whole great mass of
[24:19] millions and billions of light years god
[24:22] sits
[24:23] in the midst of all of it and he looks
[24:25] down and he said paul is in there
[24:27] my mother's in there somewhere looking
[24:29] down now now
[24:30] what does he mean if that is god's first
[24:32] bible
[24:33] and you your name is written in the the
[24:36] bible that we read
[24:38] what about in that first bible now we
[24:41] know that that brother brown said the
[24:43] way that
[24:43] you were supposed to read that first
[24:45] bible is is it started with virgo
[24:47] and ended up in leo now we don't have
[24:49] maybe there's a lot of missing pieces
[24:51] anywhere
[24:52] but we know that if you look at that at
[24:54] the constellations the correct way what
[24:56] they're spelling out is the redemptive
[24:58] story
[24:58] that god came by a virgin and he came
[25:00] and manifested in the earth
[25:02] like like brother dale was breaking out
[25:03] this morning and and and all the way
[25:05] down to when he would return
[25:07] and return as a roaring lion and and so
[25:10] i believe that if you could look at it
[25:11] in the right way you would see
[25:14] all the bride and all the people of god
[25:15] reflected in that great story in the sky
[25:18] and so brother branham was talking about
[25:19] how that you can see god in the midst
[25:22] holding everything together putting
[25:23] everything together in a way
[25:25] that everything moves in harmony because
[25:27] god is in the midst
[25:29] and he's saying what if what if our
[25:31] lives could be
[25:32] like that what if our what if we could
[25:34] reflect that
[25:36] bible in the heavens what if we could if
[25:38] god was so in the midst of the church
[25:40] to where everything moved in harmony and
[25:42] we were in one accord
[25:44] what would that church look like what
[25:45] would our lives what would our lives
[25:47] look like
[25:49] and he said i thought of the order of
[25:50] that heavenly
[25:53] host not one of them is out of place
[25:56] everyone keeps its time perfectly god's
[25:59] great army
[26:00] i thought of the soldiers how that if
[26:02] that moon would happen to get out of
[26:04] order
[26:05] the earth would be covered again with
[26:07] water just in a few minutes
[26:10] they all set in place and if there's a
[26:12] moving
[26:13] anywhere of them it's for cause and will
[26:16] affect this earth
[26:17] now can't you see the bride's purpose
[26:20] reflected in those statements
[26:22] that every move of the bride is for a
[26:24] cause
[26:25] every action that you take is for a
[26:27] cause and he's saying
[26:29] it will affect this earth do you know
[26:31] when the bride
[26:32] speaks when when the bride makes a
[26:34] movement it will cause an effect
[26:36] in this earth when you take a hold of
[26:38] god's word it will affect
[26:40] your earth just the same as the moon
[26:42] moving through its orbit affects the
[26:44] earth
[26:45] affects the movement of the water from
[26:47] one side of the earth to
[26:48] the other because what you're reflecting
[26:51] the word of god
[26:52] you are the interpretation of the word
[26:54] of god just as those things those
[26:56] planets in orbit are showing forth the
[26:58] great
[26:58] magnificence of god's word in harmony
[27:01] moving in harmony with his word
[27:03] he said we just see the results of it
[27:05] now but
[27:06] some of them moving into their other
[27:08] spots it's effective
[27:10] it affects everything my goodness
[27:14] you think about how every little small
[27:17] planet every little moving of an
[27:18] asteroid or whatever
[27:20] affects something and there's not one
[27:22] believer here
[27:23] sitting here this afternoon that doesn't
[27:25] affect the bride of christ
[27:27] you have a place that you're you have a
[27:29] place and a purpose sitting here in this
[27:31] church you have a place and a purpose
[27:32] in your home your little housewives
[27:35] going home making your biscuits there's
[27:37] a purpose in your life
[27:38] because everything that you do has a
[27:40] purpose
[27:41] brother brown said the celestial objects
[27:43] were in their place
[27:45] they know their place and i want to just
[27:47] point out
[27:48] that the celestial objects could not be
[27:51] affected by
[27:52] they're not affected by satan's doing
[27:54] they're not affected by
[27:56] no fear or no hysteria and so you see
[28:00] let me just point this out now this this
[28:02] we're living in a time now
[28:04] where there's so much hysteria going on
[28:06] in the earth everybody's so affected by
[28:08] the
[28:09] by sickness and by by death and things
[28:11] and you can get into a place of hysteria
[28:14] but i believe god's word will bring us
[28:16] to a place of confidence
[28:17] of stillness like that promise that we
[28:20] were reading that
[28:21] after ye have suffered a while make you
[28:23] perfect establish
[28:24] strengthen and settle you will settle
[28:27] you down to where you know your god and
[28:28] the bible says that they that though
[28:30] their god will do great exploits
[28:32] will come to a place where you don't
[28:34] fear
[28:35] and brother brahman said as he was
[28:37] breaking all these things down he said
[28:38] that
[28:39] same god is here the same god that can
[28:42] keep the planets in orbit the same god
[28:44] that can
[28:45] keep the sun in the right place they
[28:47] could put this earth three planets away
[28:49] from the sun
[28:50] because there's life on it they can
[28:52] arrange everything in just
[28:53] a harmonious way because everything in
[28:56] the celestials
[28:57] has a plan and purpose that same god is
[29:00] here
[29:01] and he says what's he waiting on he's
[29:03] waiting the only thing that he's waiting
[29:05] for
[29:06] is for his army to get their position
[29:09] like the stars get the position
[29:13] all right now now let's highlight that
[29:15] for a second because so many times in
[29:17] our carnal imagination of what the what
[29:19] the gospel is really about we believe
[29:22] that
[29:22] what we're doing here is we're waiting
[29:24] on god to do something
[29:25] but see god has already i i i luis
[29:29] i was marco polo me the other night and
[29:30] i was staying up we were going back and
[29:32] forth because i was i was going through
[29:34] what brother dale had been preaching on
[29:36] the seals and i was staying up the other
[29:38] night
[29:39] and and i saw where
[29:42] i i i i was reading some things about
[29:46] now i lost my train of thought anyway
[29:49] that happens sometimes anyway
[29:53] god is we're not waiting on god to do
[29:55] something
[29:56] oh i remember what it was now that after
[29:59] after
[30:00] after six seals were preached there's
[30:02] nothing else can be said
[30:04] six seals are preached and there's
[30:06] nothing else can be said and so
[30:08] so there's nothing the message has
[30:10] already been preached that's my point
[30:12] the message
[30:12] that message has already been preached
[30:15] and now
[30:16] now what is what are we waiting on god
[30:18] to preach to send another
[30:20] another messenger are we waiting on
[30:21] another message to be preached what
[30:23] we're waiting on
[30:24] we're god is waiting on us to do
[30:27] something with us
[30:28] he's the only thing that he is waiting
[30:30] for us is to get in position and how do
[30:32] you get in position
[30:34] by by the word how do you even know what
[30:36] your position
[30:37] is how do you so like a young person
[30:39] would say well i feel like i'm supposed
[30:41] to be called to be a minister i want to
[30:42] be a minister
[30:43] well how do you know what to preach
[30:44] without the word you can't preach if you
[30:46] don't know what the word is
[30:48] how can you preach this message if you
[30:49] don't know what the message is
[30:51] so get in the message get in the word
[30:53] and then you'll have something to preach
[30:54] then you'll have something to do
[30:57] now now brother adam said the the point
[30:59] of this message
[31:00] is there's two powers there's two powers
[31:03] and there's there's
[31:04] the devil is trying to get control of
[31:06] you
[31:07] and god is trying to get control of you
[31:10] and whichever one has control of you is
[31:12] the
[31:13] is the thing that you've given over to
[31:15] now brother brown said there's only two
[31:17] powers and there's only two kingdoms two
[31:19] powers and two kingdoms
[31:20] all the rest the little minor things are
[31:23] connected with either one of those
[31:24] powers
[31:25] and those powers is god's power and
[31:28] satan's power
[31:30] and he goes on he says one of the other
[31:32] power is going to control us
[31:34] so let's cast out the evil one and let's
[31:36] take our position
[31:38] like the stars of the heaven and and
[31:41] then he goes on and he says
[31:42] and we don't want to be wandering stars
[31:45] like jude spoke of
[31:46] wonder if this is right wonder if that's
[31:48] right wonder
[31:50] if it will happen wonder how it could be
[31:53] do you know that this gospel has given
[31:55] us the antidote to confusion
[31:57] with this message if you get in the
[31:59] message you don't have an excuse for
[32:01] being confused anymore
[32:03] the reason that people are confused is
[32:05] because that they don't get into the
[32:07] message to find out what the prophet
[32:08] said
[32:09] and then they wander from one church to
[32:11] the other wondering what is the truth
[32:13] wondering if people are telling the
[32:15] truth what the gospel really is how do i
[32:17] get the holy ghost
[32:18] how do i know whether i'm really born
[32:20] again or not but brother and i'm saying
[32:22] don't be wondering stars
[32:24] you know maybe there's they're stars if
[32:26] you look into the heavens that are just
[32:27] shooting from place to place and they're
[32:29] not in a particular position
[32:31] but there's you want to be like those
[32:33] stars that are in a position that are
[32:35] rooted and grounded and settled and have
[32:37] a place and a purpose
[32:38] not just something shooting around
[32:40] shooting off not knowing what you're
[32:42] doing
[32:43] don't don't be like one of the stars
[32:45] that that maybe at the end of your
[32:47] journey you look back and say
[32:49] what was i even doing what was what was
[32:51] my life for but your life has a purpose
[32:54] and if you get in christ you'll find out
[32:56] what that purpose is and your purpose is
[32:58] to manifest
[32:59] his word for this day now brother brown
[33:02] says when an army makes ready
[33:04] and he nails down all the different
[33:06] criteria of an army
[33:08] having to get ready all the different
[33:10] steps and stages
[33:11] he says they should first sit down and
[33:14] figure out what's right and wrong
[33:16] and whether they're able to go against
[33:18] the next nation or not
[33:20] he says jesus taught that and then the
[33:23] soldiers have to be selected
[33:26] and they've got to be dressed for
[33:28] fighting
[33:29] and then they've got to be trained for
[33:32] fighting
[33:33] and a battleground has to be selected
[33:36] for the battle to take place now
[33:39] now think about all these things have to
[33:41] do with the word
[33:43] the soldiers being selected you're being
[33:46] selected there's a selection
[33:47] process going on when you come to church
[33:50] and you hear the preaching of the gospel
[33:52] if you respond to that gospel call then
[33:55] you have been selected
[33:56] if your ears open up if the gospel
[33:58] looses that
[34:00] bind that bond that the devil has you
[34:02] under and your eyes become open to the
[34:04] truth
[34:05] then you have been selected you've been
[34:07] received into the army of the lord
[34:10] and then you see you want to sit down
[34:12] first though
[34:13] and figure out what's right and wrong
[34:16] and so that's why it's so important to
[34:18] discern
[34:19] what's right and what's the the true
[34:21] truth from the false
[34:23] now this is what brother wade's been
[34:25] been been preaching on
[34:26] so long that that you've got to be able
[34:28] to discern the two spirits
[34:30] that is and maybe i want to just nail
[34:33] down the practical application of that
[34:35] tonight because
[34:36] if you can't discern between the two
[34:38] spirits the true
[34:39] and the false that are in the church how
[34:43] are you going to know how to respond how
[34:45] are you going to know
[34:46] what you're supposed to be fighting for
[34:48] or against
[34:49] now now brother brown the example that
[34:51] he uses is when general custer made his
[34:54] fatal mistake now
[34:55] now i know we've all heard this before
[34:57] we listened to the message before but
[34:59] let's pay real close attention to what
[35:00] he points out when he's telling this
[35:02] story
[35:03] of general custer making his fatal
[35:05] mistake what was general custer's fatal
[35:07] mistake
[35:09] he said general kuster as i understand
[35:11] had orders from the government
[35:13] he had orders not to go into the land of
[35:16] the sioux indian
[35:18] he had orders don't go into the land of
[35:21] the suit
[35:22] so there's his first mistake he
[35:24] disobeyed the orders
[35:26] because it was a religious time for them
[35:28] it was a time of worship
[35:30] they were having a feast but custer got
[35:33] drunk
[35:34] and he thought that he would just do it
[35:36] anyhow
[35:37] he's rebellious he's just got i'm going
[35:39] to do it anyhow nobody going to tell me
[35:41] what to do
[35:42] he would cross whether it was orders or
[35:45] not
[35:46] orders and then they actually shot
[35:49] some innocent men shot at them
[35:53] now there's custer's fatal mistake he
[35:56] was unable to discern who was innocent
[35:58] and who was guilty so he shot an
[36:01] innocent man
[36:02] now you see if you don't have
[36:03] discernment you'll go to a church
[36:05] and you'll shoot the innocent man saying
[36:08] they're not preaching right
[36:09] when they're preaching the absolute
[36:11] truth of the message
[36:13] if you don't know if you're unable to
[36:15] discern you'll think you're doing right
[36:17] when you're doing wrong
[36:19] that's why you must take a step back and
[36:22] discern
[36:22] whether it is right or false you've got
[36:26] to discern the truth first or you'll be
[36:29] shooting an innocent man he said he shot
[36:31] at them i
[36:32] i think they hit some of them it was
[36:34] scouts but out hunting for food to feed
[36:37] their people
[36:38] while they were in worship my goodness
[36:41] i think how many people in the message
[36:43] of the hour around the message
[36:45] have done the same thing shot people
[36:47] that were there in worship
[36:49] trying to feed their people shot
[36:52] ministers of the gospel that were trying
[36:53] to feed people
[36:54] that were in worship and they and they
[36:56] talk about bad about them behind their
[36:58] back and they do all these things and
[37:00] say
[37:00] i'm not going to listen to that i'm not
[37:01] going to go to that church anymore and
[37:03] all those kind of things
[37:04] because they were unable to discern the
[37:06] truth from the
[37:08] false now see let me pause for a second
[37:12] because i know sometimes when you get to
[37:13] preaching like this people will say
[37:15] brother bob doesn't like me or brother
[37:16] bob's talking about certain things but
[37:18] see
[37:18] i am only reading what the prophet said
[37:21] in this message
[37:22] go back to the greatest battle ever
[37:24] fought and see whether i am
[37:26] only reading what he said or not so
[37:29] don't get mad at me
[37:31] get mad at the prophet for exposing
[37:33] things
[37:34] he said and that was the end of general
[37:37] custer because he didn't sit down
[37:39] and think first he didn't sit down and
[37:42] think first he had no business there
[37:44] he had no right to be there he had
[37:46] pushed the indians from the east coast
[37:48] all the way across the west anyhow and
[37:51] they had a treaty
[37:52] but he broke the treaty and when he
[37:55] broke the treaty then he
[37:56] lost the battle so you must be able to
[37:59] discern the truth from the false
[38:02] now now let me read this quote that
[38:04] brother wade has been reading
[38:06] and that is so important to the bride of
[38:08] christ and the church age book where
[38:10] brother
[38:10] said now remember this christ and the
[38:12] true church is a continuation of the
[38:14] book of acts
[38:15] but the book of revelation shows how
[38:18] that the antichrist spirit
[38:19] would come into the church and defile it
[38:22] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[38:26] so that's maybe a first step at
[38:28] discerning because the devil wants
[38:31] the church to be lukewarm
[38:34] formal and powerless what's lukewarm
[38:37] lukewarm is
[38:37] is where you're not really on fire for
[38:39] god you come to church and you just kind
[38:41] of
[38:42] you well it's another service i don't
[38:45] really want to read my bible this week i
[38:47] don't i don't really
[38:48] i don't understand anything and you just
[38:51] get become lukewarm
[38:52] you're going through the motions but
[38:54] you're not on fire for god
[38:56] and formal formal if you look up the
[38:58] definition of formal is where
[39:00] you've got to do everything by the set
[39:02] of rules that
[39:04] a governing body says that you've got to
[39:06] do it by
[39:07] if it's not done remember when jesus
[39:09] would raise the dead on the sabbath
[39:11] or he would do a miracle on the sabbath
[39:13] and the pharisees and the sadducees
[39:15] would say
[39:15] it's not according to our rules it's not
[39:17] done by the way that we think you should
[39:19] be doing it
[39:20] you've got to do it the way we say and
[39:22] but jesus was breaking their formal
[39:24] tradition
[39:25] he got out of their formal rule book for
[39:29] when you when you begin to get into your
[39:30] formal rule book and everything has got
[39:32] to be done
[39:33] the uh by by this structure
[39:38] then you you begin to squelch the spirit
[39:40] of the living god what if god calls you
[39:43] like philip to go witness to somebody
[39:44] over there and
[39:46] and it's it doesn't fall within the
[39:48] structure that you think it should
[39:49] and and powerless the devil wants to
[39:52] make the church
[39:53] lukewarm formal and powerless
[39:56] and what did brother branham say the
[39:58] power was the power
[40:00] is in the revelation of the word of god
[40:03] so when you deny the power thereof
[40:06] you're denying the word that is being
[40:08] preached from the pulpit
[40:09] that will give you power to overcome the
[40:11] devil
[40:13] and you that's exactly what the devil
[40:15] wants the church to be he wants
[40:17] the antichrist spirit wants you to be
[40:20] lukewarm formal and powerless so now you
[40:24] begin a step toward being able to
[40:25] discern
[40:26] if the devil wants you to just just uh
[40:29] have just a slack christian experience
[40:32] and
[40:32] not on fire and and not understanding
[40:35] what's being preached and
[40:36] not have a personal revelation of jesus
[40:38] christ for yourself
[40:39] that's getting to a place exactly where
[40:41] the devil wants you to be
[40:43] but the bride of christ will not be like
[40:46] that she will be able to discern
[40:47] and withstand that religious spirit now
[40:50] brother brown said in that quote he said
[40:52] it
[40:52] exposes satan revealing his works
[40:55] the attempted destruction of god's
[40:57] people and the discrediting of god's
[40:59] word right down to the time he is cast
[41:01] into the lake of fire
[41:03] he fights that he cannot stand it
[41:06] he knows that if the people get the true
[41:09] revelation
[41:10] of the true church and what she is
[41:14] and what she stands for and that she can
[41:16] do the greater works
[41:18] she will be an invincible army
[41:21] now isn't that what brother brown was
[41:23] talking about and the greatest battle
[41:24] ever fought
[41:25] the god is selecting soldiers he's
[41:28] training up an army
[41:29] he's getting them clothed right so they
[41:31] have the right dressing
[41:32] so they have the right army and then
[41:35] he's giving them the ability to discern
[41:37] the what they're fighting and to know
[41:39] what they're fighting and to know the
[41:41] tricks of the enemy
[41:43] brother brahman said in in the message
[41:45] all things he said the holy spirit
[41:47] warned us that in the last days that the
[41:49] church would get away
[41:50] from the sincerity and the faith they'd
[41:53] have a form of godliness but would deny
[41:55] the power that went with the right thing
[41:57] having a form of godliness but denying
[42:00] the power thereof yes sir god
[42:02] hates a powerless religion and any
[42:05] religion today that hasn't got christ
[42:07] in it is powerless but any religion that
[42:10] christ
[42:11] is in that christ in is under his blood
[42:14] and it's got power in
[42:16] it you say god hates a religion without
[42:19] power
[42:20] he said your solemn feast is a stink
[42:23] now now we think of power a lot of times
[42:25] as being able
[42:28] to get real loud be getting real loud
[42:32] but jesus was able to cast out devils
[42:34] without raising his voice
[42:37] the bible says that that you didn't hear
[42:39] his voice in this in the street
[42:41] he didn't he wasn't like a screaming
[42:43] preacher or anything
[42:44] he had but he had a revelation of who he
[42:47] was
[42:48] and what his purpose was and what he was
[42:50] doing there
[42:51] and that was the power that he had
[42:53] within him to overcome the enemy
[42:55] until the devil the devil tempted him
[42:57] three times and said cast you off this
[42:59] building
[43:00] turn these stones in the bread all the
[43:02] different things that he tempted him
[43:03] with
[43:03] and jesus didn't respond with loud
[43:05] noises but he responded
[43:07] with the word and that is how you will
[43:09] overcome the devil in this day now
[43:12] brother brown said
[43:12] there are two spirits trying to operate
[43:15] two spirits trying to find vessels
[43:18] and you can resist the devil in james
[43:20] chapter 4 7 it says submit yourselves
[43:22] therefore to god
[43:24] resist the devil and he will flee from
[43:26] you
[43:28] you know the devil has been tormenting
[43:30] so many people in the bride
[43:31] he's been tormenting so many people
[43:33] today and and i i want to just encourage
[43:35] you
[43:36] that you have been predestinated and
[43:39] called out by the message of the hour
[43:41] to torment the devil the devil is
[43:43] tormenting you but you
[43:44] have been called out to torment the
[43:45] devil and if you will resist the devil
[43:48] the bible says that he will flee from
[43:50] you he will get so
[43:52] fed up with trying to mess with you that
[43:54] he'll flee
[43:55] from you now of course he's going to
[43:56] come back a little bit later but that
[43:58] doesn't mean that you can't resist him
[44:00] again
[44:01] you just keep resisting him and how do
[44:03] you resist him the same way that jesus
[44:05] resisted the devil
[44:06] by the word it is written it is written
[44:10] it is written it is written that all
[44:12] things are possible to them that believe
[44:14] it is written that he will never leave
[44:16] you or forsake you
[44:18] it is written that he is with you all
[44:20] the time
[44:21] he's always he's a present help in time
[44:23] of need and in time of trouble
[44:25] he's a prison help it's written all
[44:28] these things it's written forget
[44:30] not all thy benefits my soul forget
[44:33] don't forget all god's benefits
[44:35] that he's a healer he's your healer he's
[44:37] your savior
[44:38] don't forget he gave the promise that if
[44:40] you're seeking the holy ghost
[44:42] the promise is under you and until your
[44:44] children and to as many as their fall
[44:46] far off even as many as the lord our god
[44:48] shall call the promise is to you
[44:50] and it's written it's written that god
[44:53] is able of these stones to rise up
[44:55] children unto abraham
[44:57] it's written and you can when you quote
[44:59] god's promises
[45:01] you that is how you defeat the devil by
[45:04] speaking god's word back to him
[45:07] now you see so so we've gone through all
[45:10] the requirement all the different
[45:11] things that god is doing as he prepares
[45:14] an army
[45:14] and and there's got to be a common
[45:17] meeting ground
[45:18] a common place where the battle can rage
[45:21] now maybe just to kind of illustrate
[45:23] this think of it in your mind about how
[45:25] when the israelites and the philistines
[45:27] met
[45:27] and david went over to the israelites to
[45:29] bring his family some bread
[45:31] at what night he looked down in the
[45:32] valley and there in the common meeting
[45:35] place
[45:36] was goliath making his bold threats and
[45:38] david said is there not
[45:40] anybody that's willing to go up against
[45:42] this goliath
[45:43] and so he was willing to go down into
[45:46] the common meeting place
[45:47] and do battle so first before you do
[45:50] battle you've got to
[45:51] you've got to be equipped right you've
[45:53] got to be trained right you've got to be
[45:55] able to tell the enemy
[45:56] and then you go into the common meeting
[45:58] place and what
[46:00] brother branham say the common meeting
[46:01] place where the battle rages
[46:03] is in your mind
[46:08] he said when this great battle started
[46:09] on earth there had to be a mutual
[46:11] meeting place
[46:12] now y'all don't go to sleep hang on i
[46:14] know a lot this is a
[46:15] a lot of background for a lot of people
[46:17] but some maybe haven't heard this before
[46:19] and i'm getting to a point here so just
[46:21] hang on with me for a little bit longer
[46:23] he said when this great battle started
[46:25] on earth there had to be a mutual
[46:27] meeting place
[46:28] there had to be a place selected for the
[46:30] battle to begin
[46:31] and for the battle to rage and that
[46:33] battlegrounds began in the human mind
[46:36] there is where the battle starts the
[46:39] human mind was
[46:40] chosen for the place of the battle where
[46:42] it was beginning that is because
[46:44] that decisions are made from the mind
[46:46] the head
[46:47] and he goes on to say decisions are made
[46:49] in the head
[46:50] there's where satan meets you and the
[46:52] decisions are because that god
[46:55] made a man that way now think think
[46:57] about that that god
[46:59] god did not make you to be a robot but
[47:01] he put in you the facility to choose
[47:04] this way or that way to say i agree
[47:07] with what that preacher is saying or i
[47:09] do not agree
[47:11] and there is the battleground the
[47:13] battleground in the old testament was
[47:14] they would take up
[47:15] uh stones and slay goliath that way they
[47:19] would take
[47:20] david took his sword and cut goliath's
[47:22] head off but the battleground
[47:24] now is you don't take up a sword you're
[47:26] taking up the sword of the word
[47:28] and you're doing battle that way you're
[47:30] taking up the shield of faith and the
[47:32] helmet of salvation
[47:33] and your feet are tr are shot with the
[47:35] gospel of peace
[47:37] and you've got your clothes right so
[47:39] that you can do battle and you take up
[47:40] that sword
[47:41] and you you lop off the enemy's head
[47:43] with it you can cut him and slice him
[47:45] with it
[47:46] and you see what that looks like is in
[47:49] practice as the preacher is preaching
[47:50] along
[47:51] and you can either your faith will
[47:53] either build and build and build as a
[47:55] service progresses
[47:56] by the preaching of the god of the
[47:58] gospel or you will reject it and reject
[48:01] it and get colder and colder and go
[48:03] further away
[48:04] because you have within yourself the
[48:06] faculty to either accept
[48:08] or reject the word as it's being
[48:11] preached
[48:13] brother brown said your womb of your
[48:15] spirit is your mind
[48:17] your mind is a channel you've got five
[48:20] senses that controls the body you've got
[48:22] five senses that controls the soul
[48:24] consciousness so forth now now this is
[48:26] where
[48:26] he's kind of flip-flopping the labels a
[48:28] little bit but he always talked
[48:30] five senses to the outside five senses
[48:33] to the inner realm
[48:34] one sense to the inner rim to the inside
[48:37] realm but
[48:37] he flops the label sometimes early on in
[48:40] his ministry
[48:42] now your body see there's taste filled
[48:44] smelling here but there's only one
[48:45] channel to the inside of that soul show
[48:47] that you are a seed
[48:49] your soul body and spirit and then the
[48:51] one channel
[48:52] avenue one way into that your own free
[48:55] moral agency
[48:57] that is you can receive or reject you do
[49:00] whatever you want to
[49:02] therefore evil's on the same basis she
[49:04] could take god's word and say
[49:05] god said not to do it and get away from
[49:07] here now now
[49:09] the reason i believe that he talks about
[49:11] eve is because now
[49:12] eve if adam and eve were one
[49:16] and then eve was taken out of adam's
[49:18] side and adam
[49:19] god breathed as brother brother dale was
[49:21] bringing out this morning in blasphemous
[49:23] names
[49:23] that god breathed eternal life into
[49:25] adam's soul
[49:26] so there you've got e adam and eve both
[49:29] with eternal
[49:30] life and yet now now this is the point
[49:34] just because you're born again does not
[49:36] mean you're turned into a robot
[49:39] well you're born again you can have
[49:41] eternal life down in your soul and god
[49:43] is not
[49:43] forcing you to to go home and read the
[49:46] bible he's not
[49:47] forcing you it's still a battle to come
[49:50] to church
[49:50] it's still a battle when you get up in
[49:52] the morning and you say i got a headache
[49:54] i just want to stay home and i just want
[49:55] to lay in the bed all day
[49:57] or whatever it is it's still going to be
[49:59] a battle you still got battles
[50:01] and that's why it's the greatest battle
[50:02] ever fought because you've got a battle
[50:04] in your mind
[50:05] it's going to be a battle when you get
[50:07] up in the morning and the kids are
[50:08] pulling every which way and
[50:10] and maybe you and your wife have a
[50:11] little spat on the way to church
[50:13] and it's a battle because the devil
[50:15] wants you to just be slack and be lazy
[50:17] and stay at home and not come to church
[50:20] but something on the inside will be
[50:21] pushing i
[50:22] gotta get that word i'm gonna be a
[50:24] little jacob and i'm going to get that
[50:26] word
[50:26] if it kills me if i have to beg bar to
[50:28] steal i'm going to get that word
[50:30] if i have to if i have to be a little
[50:32] shyster almost i'm going to have to i'm
[50:33] going to get it
[50:34] that's the kind of christian you got to
[50:36] be you got to be willing to get laid
[50:38] everything aside to get that word and
[50:40] somebody tells you i i wouldn't go
[50:42] listen to
[50:43] i wouldn't go listen to that preacher or
[50:44] whatever maybe maybe it's time to go
[50:46] check it out because
[50:47] like a little jacob you want that word
[50:50] above everything else
[50:53] you see you see when somebody says i
[50:54] just i just don't know about going to
[50:56] church all the time i just
[50:58] it makes you question whether the right
[51:01] thing is down on the inside because
[51:03] if you've got that real genuine boring
[51:05] and soul down on the inside
[51:07] you're going to be wanting that word
[51:09] above everything else
[51:10] you want that word because it's what
[51:12] gives you power over the devil
[51:13] you want that word because that's what's
[51:15] taking you closer and closer to the
[51:17] headstone
[51:18] you want that word because it is what
[51:20] gives you strength and feeds you
[51:24] now brother brown said if this church
[51:26] right now could be put together and
[51:28] knitted together with such that every
[51:29] person would be in one accord
[51:32] with not one shadow of doubt anywhere
[51:34] there would not be a feeble person in
[51:36] our midst
[51:37] in another five minutes
[51:40] there will not be nobody here desiring
[51:42] the holy ghost but what would receive it
[51:44] if you could just get that certain thing
[51:46] fixed now there is where the battle
[51:48] begins or ride in your mind
[51:50] whether you will now see that's where
[51:52] the battle is
[51:53] the battle is you're sitting here and
[51:55] you maybe you're battling with what i'm
[51:57] saying
[51:57] your body you've got all these quotes
[51:58] that are coming up and you're thinking
[52:00] well he didn't say exactly the way i
[52:01] remember
[52:02] and all these things and you're battling
[52:03] but see brother branham is saying
[52:06] if you can get the flus cleared out so
[52:08] that you're thinking right and you're
[52:09] meditating right and you're receiving
[52:11] the word and you're accepting it and the
[52:13] way that it's being preached
[52:14] and the way that it should be he said in
[52:16] another five minutes
[52:17] there wouldn't be nobody here desiring
[52:19] the holy ghost but what would receive it
[52:22] my goodness so how do you get the holy
[52:25] ghost
[52:27] how do you get the holy ghost you
[52:30] believe
[52:31] god's word all right
[52:35] you just accept it you just accept it
[52:39] now isn't that what a preacher's role is
[52:41] in a marriage
[52:42] the preacher comes up and the man and
[52:43] the wife come forward and he says
[52:46] is there anybody is there any reason why
[52:48] these can't be married
[52:49] is there any there's no doubt there's no
[52:52] they're believing
[52:52] they're doing right and see a minister a
[52:55] minister is actually
[52:56] performing a wedding ceremony even as
[52:58] you're seated here
[53:00] if you believe it there's no reason if
[53:01] the old man is dead if the old man
[53:03] you've been baptized and that old man is
[53:04] dead and there's no reason
[53:06] why you can't be married then just
[53:09] accept it
[53:10] just accept it and it will begin to be
[53:13] manifested in your life
[53:14] but but brother bob i got to go i got to
[53:16] do all these things i got to go do some
[53:18] novenas or whatever
[53:19] whatever else you think and and the uh
[53:22] you whatever your interpretation of the
[53:23] message is
[53:25] no the gospel is as simple as just
[53:27] accept it
[53:28] as is presented just believe
[53:31] because it is the birth of the word the
[53:34] word is what will give you power over
[53:36] the enemy
[53:36] and when you receive it then the holy
[53:39] spirit will come and anoint it
[53:41] now see that's another thing that
[53:43] brother brown brings out in the greatest
[53:44] battle ever fall
[53:46] the devil wants you to believe his lie
[53:48] so he can anoint
[53:49] that god wants you to believe the truth
[53:52] so he can anoint the truth
[53:54] and the devil wants you to believe his
[53:56] lie so he can anoint the lie
[53:58] so he can anoint it with that spirit of
[54:01] unbelief
[54:02] there's a spirit of truth and that is
[54:04] the spirit of christ
[54:05] and the spirit of unbelief is the spirit
[54:07] of the devil
[54:08] the spirit of the antichrist and both of
[54:11] those spirits are trying to anoint you
[54:13] even as you're seated here right in the
[54:14] church right now
[54:16] both of those spirits are trying to
[54:18] anoint the people
[54:19] the spirit of god is trying to anoint
[54:21] you and what is preventing that spirit
[54:24] from anointing you is that you won't
[54:26] believe
[54:27] and the spirit of the of the antichrist
[54:29] is trying to annoy his people too
[54:31] and when you accept a lie over the truth
[54:34] then he can come and anoint
[54:37] see overcoming power doesn't come by
[54:41] overcoming power doesn't come by people
[54:42] deep being nice to me and liking me
[54:44] that's a lot
[54:45] and this and this message brother ram
[54:47] said he said people think that coming to
[54:48] church is like being
[54:49] you want to be a good person and that's
[54:51] where people get so hung up so many
[54:53] times we want to come to church so that
[54:55] we can
[54:55] feel liked and loved and that's part of
[54:58] it part of
[54:58] the christian experience part of coming
[55:01] to church is showing love to one another
[55:03] being a lie to the world and all those
[55:05] things but
[55:06] just having people like you will not
[55:09] give you a home
[55:10] in heaven being comfortable and being
[55:13] well respected and
[55:14] being in the spotlight and having first
[55:16] place those are not
[55:18] the secret to overcoming the secret
[55:22] is what jesus said in matthew chapter
[55:24] 18.
[55:25] when he said and jesus called a little
[55:27] child unto him and set him in the midst
[55:29] of them
[55:30] and said verily i say unto you except ye
[55:32] be converted and become as little
[55:34] children ye shall not enter into the
[55:37] kingdom of heaven
[55:38] whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[55:41] as this little child
[55:43] the same is greatest in the kingdom of
[55:46] heaven
[55:46] to come into as a little child into the
[55:49] sanctuary of the lord and say
[55:52] teach me i'm willing to hear
[55:56] and do if you tell me if you tell me
[55:59] that i need to be baptized in the name
[56:01] of the lord jesus christ i'm going to go
[56:03] do it
[56:03] because you're a little child a little
[56:05] child just you tell a little child to do
[56:07] something and he's like
[56:08] he's just god has got his little bowl
[56:10] full empty empty holding it out
[56:12] ready to be filled give it to me and
[56:14] i'll do whatever you tell me to do
[56:17] in luke chapter 10 verse 21 it says in
[56:19] that hour jesus rejoiced in the spirit
[56:21] and said
[56:22] i thank thee o father lord of heaven
[56:24] that thou hast hid these things
[56:26] from the wise and prudent and has
[56:28] revealed them unto babes and brother
[56:30] brown would always quote that as unto
[56:31] babes
[56:32] such as would learn babes such as would
[56:34] learn
[56:35] even so far therefore it seemed good in
[56:37] thy sight a babe such as would learn a
[56:40] babe
[56:40] that will learn as somebody that will
[56:42] lay their pride down
[56:44] that will lay their ego down and say i'm
[56:47] willing to listen to what you have to
[56:48] say
[56:49] i'm willing to listen to the gospel
[56:51] priest i'm willing to see
[56:53] what this is all about that will just
[56:54] lay it down and accept it as a little
[56:56] child
[56:57] that's why the book of revelation says
[56:59] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[57:01] the spirit saith under the churches
[57:03] if you've got an ear to hear like a
[57:05] little child if you're willing to just
[57:07] listen if you can open up your ear and
[57:09] listen
[57:10] then then you will have that promise to
[57:12] him that overcometh
[57:14] him that overcometh is the promise to
[57:16] him that will hear
[57:17] that him that will just listen and be
[57:19] willing to be tall
[57:20] and willing to receive instruction do
[57:23] you know even in the book of revelation
[57:25] the word beast is trans the original
[57:27] word beast in the greek is the word
[57:29] theorem which means a
[57:30] wild or untamable beast a kind of beast
[57:34] that cannot be instructed the kind of
[57:36] beast that cannot be taught
[57:37] and we don't want to be that kind of
[57:39] beast we want to be a gentle lamb that's
[57:41] willing to be led willing to be
[57:43] instructed willing to
[57:45] have somebody say you're doing wrong and
[57:46] you need to go this way
[57:49] or maybe you think the new birth is like
[57:52] this
[57:52] but it's really like this you think
[57:55] let me say it like this you might think
[57:58] that the new birth is just
[57:59] feeling a presence feeling something all
[58:01] of a sudden and you didn't believe
[58:02] nothing but you just got in church
[58:04] and you felt something you felt a cold
[58:06] trickle down your back
[58:07] but that's not the new birth the new
[58:09] birth is when you've
[58:11] gone through a process of justification
[58:13] sanctification and a sanctification
[58:15] you pack the word in just like that
[58:17] middle rim and the tabernacle you sit
[58:19] there at that table
[58:20] of showbread and you pack that word and
[58:22] you study and you sit there trying to
[58:24] keep the lamps lit
[58:25] as they go out and they get foggy and
[58:27] dim and you sit there and lit it up
[58:29] until the holy spirit comes and anoints
[58:32] the word that you've held in your heart
[58:34] and makes it come alive and that's a new
[58:36] birth that's the baptism in the holy
[58:38] ghost when the
[58:39] when the spirit comes and quickens the
[58:42] word that you have held in your heart
[58:44] not just coming into church to our
[58:46] sensation not just coming
[58:48] to be amongst a group of people so that
[58:49] you can feel important or something
[58:51] but when the word of god is quickened by
[58:53] the holy spirit
[58:55] you've got to hear the word and receive
[58:57] it to be born again
[58:59] you've got to receive the word in your
[59:01] soul you've got to hear it and receive
[59:03] it and hang
[59:04] on to it hang on until something happens
[59:07] do you know that's what they did on the
[59:09] day of pentecost
[59:10] brother brown said they said well we
[59:12] already got it and peter or somebody
[59:14] rose up and said
[59:15] no there's a promise something's gonna
[59:17] happen now that we're hanging on to the
[59:19] word
[59:19] jesus said it was coming now let's wait
[59:21] until it comes
[59:23] and the holy spirit came and quickened
[59:25] that word well holy spirit
[59:27] the spirit that i'm talking about that's
[59:28] trying to quicken the word now
[59:30] if you'll receive it you see there's two
[59:32] spirits again there's a spirit of the
[59:34] antichrist that will quicken a lie
[59:36] that will anoint a lie and the spirit of
[59:38] truth
[59:39] the spirit of christ that will come and
[59:41] rest upon like a dove upon the word
[59:44] like like that dove coming down upon the
[59:46] word on the on the river jordan
[59:47] that wants to come down upon that word
[59:49] and quicken it and make it come to life
[59:54] do you believe that we're after a word
[59:58] birth not just a feeling or a sensation
[1:00:01] but something down on the inside that
[1:00:03] will give you confidence in this
[1:00:04] hour something that will give you a
[1:00:06] discernment to be able to know the truth
[1:00:08] from the false
[1:00:09] something that will give you give you a
[1:00:11] real genuine birth
[1:00:13] and that is the word if you will receive
[1:00:14] the worth the word for this day
[1:00:17] god will birth himself inside of you
[1:00:21] brother brother said in perfect faith he
[1:00:22] said we are taught to resist the devil
[1:00:24] and he will flee from us
[1:00:26] now to resist is to just simply turn him
[1:00:29] down
[1:00:30] just resist him that is just walk away
[1:00:32] from it
[1:00:33] god said a certain thing no matter what
[1:00:35] he's trying to tell you
[1:00:37] you don't even listen to him
[1:00:41] your ears are deaf to anything else
[1:00:44] but what the spirit says to he that has
[1:00:47] an ear that listens see what the spirit
[1:00:49] sayeth unto the churches the one
[1:00:52] that's god the listening post that
[1:00:54] catches what the spirit
[1:00:56] says to the churches if you've got that
[1:00:58] listening post down on the inside of
[1:01:00] your heart like the radio tower
[1:01:02] he's talking about a radio tower then
[1:01:04] you'll be able to hear
[1:01:05] what the spirit is saying to the
[1:01:07] churches if you don't have the listening
[1:01:09] post
[1:01:10] then all it sounds like is a bunch of
[1:01:12] clapping thunder
[1:01:14] that's why you begin to wonder what's
[1:01:15] going on in church and what the real
[1:01:17] revelation of the hour is and that's why
[1:01:18] there's so much confusion
[1:01:20] i believe because people don't have ears
[1:01:22] to hear they're not listening the right
[1:01:23] way
[1:01:24] you got to have the listening post so
[1:01:26] that you can hear what's being said
[1:01:28] if you've got that listening post you
[1:01:30] won't be confused
[1:01:33] but you know somebody somebody is going
[1:01:36] to learn
[1:01:37] how to turn down the devil
[1:01:40] now listen listen to this satan is
[1:01:43] trying to work through you
[1:01:46] through a word a lie he's trying to tell
[1:01:49] you
[1:01:50] like he told eve to give a word that's
[1:01:54] it's like twist one word off until it's
[1:01:56] twisted
[1:01:57] and then he'll give that to you that god
[1:01:59] is giving you his word the truth
[1:02:02] and the devil twisted a little bit and
[1:02:04] he wants to give
[1:02:05] that to you now before it can be spoken
[1:02:08] though it's a thought
[1:02:09] and many times the devil the devil will
[1:02:11] come first to you with a thought
[1:02:13] now what he might be attacking you with
[1:02:15] right now
[1:02:16] is a thought i don't know if that's true
[1:02:19] i don't know if that's right
[1:02:20] or or not just me preaching but any
[1:02:22] minister when you're listening to
[1:02:23] brother brown i'm like what did he mean
[1:02:25] by that i
[1:02:26] when he says in the statue of a perfect
[1:02:28] man that you've gone all this way and
[1:02:29] you still don't have the holy ghost yet
[1:02:30] well what did he mean and you begin to
[1:02:33] the the enemy will come and try to twist
[1:02:34] that and everything but you see somebody
[1:02:37] is going to learn how to turn down the
[1:02:39] devil
[1:02:40] while it's a thought while it's a
[1:02:42] thought before it even becomes a word
[1:02:44] while it's just a thought in your mind
[1:02:47] and you'll say
[1:02:48] you can't work through me i'm not going
[1:02:50] to listen to that i'm not going to
[1:02:51] listen to that lie against one of my
[1:02:53] brothers or sisters
[1:02:54] i'm not going to listen to that lie
[1:02:56] against somebody i'm not going to listen
[1:02:57] to that lie
[1:02:58] against the word where you're saying
[1:03:00] that that i'm gonna fail i'm afraid look
[1:03:02] how much of a failure you are i
[1:03:04] listen to that because god says greater
[1:03:06] is he that is in me
[1:03:08] that he is in the world i'm not
[1:03:09] listening to all those lies about how my
[1:03:11] my children are going to be lost to
[1:03:13] anything i ain't listening to that
[1:03:14] because there's a promise in his word it
[1:03:15] says contrary
[1:03:17] that this promise is unto you and your
[1:03:18] children i listen in another lies of the
[1:03:20] devil
[1:03:21] there's going to be somebody that will
[1:03:23] not listen to anything that the devil
[1:03:25] has to say
[1:03:27] listen when you don't put that when you
[1:03:28] don't listen to anything the devil has
[1:03:30] to say
[1:03:30] you put the devil out of a job when the
[1:03:34] devil can't use your thoughts
[1:03:36] and he can't use your voice and he can't
[1:03:38] use your body
[1:03:39] then the devil's out of a job and i want
[1:03:40] to put the devil out of a job tonight
[1:03:43] i want to put the devil out of a job so
[1:03:44] he's he's put out in the church
[1:03:46] out of our homes out of our lives so he
[1:03:49] can't come in
[1:03:49] and mess with our young people anymore
[1:03:51] mess with our old people
[1:03:53] when he comes and tries to put something
[1:03:54] in your head you just say i ain't
[1:03:56] listening
[1:03:56] i don't care because you know really the
[1:03:59] only way that you can do that
[1:04:00] that you've been is if you've been
[1:04:02] packing the word in and you've been
[1:04:04] packing the word and until you know what
[1:04:05] the word is
[1:04:06] and when you know what the word is and
[1:04:08] you know when something is one word off
[1:04:12] listen brother brother brown said the
[1:04:14] mind accepts the life
[1:04:16] which is the word of god now listen to
[1:04:19] this
[1:04:19] this is how the gospel works and it's
[1:04:22] contrary to half the stuff that's
[1:04:23] preached in the message
[1:04:24] if people would go listen to what the
[1:04:26] message is they find out how to get the
[1:04:28] new birth and how to grow in grace and
[1:04:29] knowledge and how to get the capstone
[1:04:31] he says the mind accepts the life
[1:04:34] which is the word of god and there
[1:04:37] brings the life
[1:04:39] just your thought doesn't do it but the
[1:04:41] word of god
[1:04:42] brought in the channel of your thought
[1:04:44] see it's not the thought that's
[1:04:46] christian science make it mind over
[1:04:47] matter
[1:04:48] that's that isn't it but your mind
[1:04:51] accepts it
[1:04:52] it grasps it what is your mind
[1:04:54] controlled by your spirit and your
[1:04:56] spirit catches the word of god
[1:04:58] and that's the thing that god that's got
[1:05:00] life in it
[1:05:01] the word of god jesus said my words our
[1:05:04] spirit and their life
[1:05:05] my words my words will actually give you
[1:05:08] life
[1:05:09] if you'll listen to my words you can
[1:05:11] have life and if you'll receive his word
[1:05:13] it will sanctify you sanctify them
[1:05:16] father by
[1:05:17] by thy truth my word is truth his word
[1:05:20] is what will cleanse you
[1:05:21] his word is what will give you life his
[1:05:23] word is what will change you
[1:05:25] that is how you tell the true and the
[1:05:27] false by his word
[1:05:29] that is how you get born again by his
[1:05:31] word his word
[1:05:32] is what will do it he said your mind
[1:05:36] accepts it grasp it
[1:05:38] your spirit catches the word of god and
[1:05:40] that's the thing that's got life in it
[1:05:42] it brings life into you when that takes
[1:05:45] place when life comes down that channel
[1:05:47] into you
[1:05:48] the word of god is manifested in you
[1:05:52] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:05:54] you then ask what you will and it'll be
[1:05:56] done for you
[1:05:57] then what does that do from the middle
[1:05:58] of the heart which is the soul
[1:06:00] from there goes forth feeding every
[1:06:02] channel the trouble of it is we're
[1:06:04] standing in here with a lot of doubt
[1:06:06] trying to accept what's out there you've
[1:06:08] got to stop that and come down that
[1:06:10] channel with the true
[1:06:11] word of god and then it goes out itself
[1:06:14] automatically
[1:06:15] it's what's on the inside that's the
[1:06:18] thing
[1:06:19] that's why jesus told nicodemus except
[1:06:21] you be born you must be born again
[1:06:24] be born again how by feeling a sensation
[1:06:26] or or seeing the pillar of fire
[1:06:29] we want so many times we want
[1:06:30] supernatural evidences
[1:06:32] but what greater evidence could there be
[1:06:34] than a revelation of jesus christ
[1:06:36] personally to you
[1:06:41] brother branham said in questions and
[1:06:43] answers 1959 he said the earth is full
[1:06:45] of the spirit of god but it's poured out
[1:06:49] it cannot operate until it comes into us
[1:06:51] we human beings to operate
[1:06:53] now think about that the earth is full
[1:06:56] of the spirit of god is poured out on
[1:06:58] all flesh
[1:06:59] but it can't operate into us until we
[1:07:02] human beings
[1:07:03] it can't operate until it comes into us
[1:07:05] we human beings to operate how does it
[1:07:06] get into you by you believing the word
[1:07:08] of god
[1:07:09] and is that just that simple and the
[1:07:12] devil wants to take us over to operate
[1:07:14] under him so he gets the mild form
[1:07:16] he starts in sin if he can hold them
[1:07:19] just a righteous man a good man and just
[1:07:21] let him go ahead
[1:07:22] and try to be good like that now see
[1:07:25] this is what the devil wants to do with
[1:07:27] you
[1:07:28] if he can hold him like that until he's
[1:07:31] dead
[1:07:32] that's just what he wants to do is to
[1:07:35] get a man
[1:07:36] in a predicament where he thinks he's a
[1:07:38] good good
[1:07:39] righteous man he's just a good
[1:07:41] churchgoer and just hold him like that
[1:07:44] until he's dead then that's what
[1:07:47] the devil wants to do with you
[1:07:53] and that's where brother brown tells the
[1:07:55] story of the chicken the eagle and the
[1:07:58] egg
[1:07:59] now let's let's really think about this
[1:08:02] when you're in an egg
[1:08:04] every one of this us when we started our
[1:08:06] christian journey you were in an
[1:08:07] eggshell
[1:08:09] it's like you're in an egg and that's
[1:08:10] where i get my title from breaking out
[1:08:12] of the shell
[1:08:13] the devil puts a cloak of blindness over
[1:08:15] your eyes so you think you're okay
[1:08:18] and you think you're all right you might
[1:08:20] be even coming to church and you might
[1:08:21] be doing
[1:08:22] going through the motions and everything
[1:08:23] you might have even been baptized
[1:08:25] but you didn't receive the word just
[1:08:26] right and you're sitting there in your
[1:08:29] eggshell
[1:08:30] you're sitting there in the egg and
[1:08:31] brother brown said one day
[1:08:33] one day you get tired of being in that
[1:08:36] egg you realize there's
[1:08:38] you're not supposed to be in that
[1:08:39] eggshell
[1:08:41] you're not supposed you're not where
[1:08:42] you're supposed to be
[1:08:44] and something on the inside begins to
[1:08:46] working
[1:08:47] and you begin to peck out now let's see
[1:08:49] how brother around says how you peck out
[1:08:51] we know he talked about the chicken
[1:08:53] the chicken picking out but how do you
[1:08:55] peck out
[1:08:56] that's what i want to know how to get
[1:08:58] out of the eggshell
[1:09:00] so whatever whatever your shell is it
[1:09:02] might be that you need to be born again
[1:09:04] or it might need be that you need to be
[1:09:06] birthed from faith to virtue
[1:09:08] it might be that you need to be birthed
[1:09:10] from brotherly kindness
[1:09:12] into the capstone but then whatever your
[1:09:15] shell is
[1:09:16] you got to do something and one of the
[1:09:18] things you got to do is you got to
[1:09:20] realize you got to come to the
[1:09:21] revelation
[1:09:22] by the preaching of the gospel that
[1:09:23] you're not where you're supposed to be
[1:09:26] that you're stuck inside of a shell and
[1:09:28] you know
[1:09:30] in the bible in second kings chapter 3
[1:09:32] it tells about how with samaria was
[1:09:34] besieged by syria
[1:09:35] and there was these two lepers that were
[1:09:37] sitting there in the gate
[1:09:39] and they came to the realization what
[1:09:41] are we doing
[1:09:43] sitting by this gate and they rose up
[1:09:46] from their place and they said
[1:09:47] if we go forward we're going to die we
[1:09:50] might die if we go back we're going to
[1:09:51] die because we're lepers and we're
[1:09:53] starving
[1:09:54] and there's something wrong we're not in
[1:09:56] our right place
[1:09:57] and so they went down to find that god
[1:10:00] had already conquered the battle for
[1:10:02] them
[1:10:03] that they didn't have to do nothing god
[1:10:05] had already fought the battle and won
[1:10:07] and all they had to do was pick up the
[1:10:08] spoils
[1:10:09] and if you come to that realization that
[1:10:12] you there's something that you need to
[1:10:13] do
[1:10:14] you'll find out that god has already
[1:10:15] fought the battle for you and
[1:10:17] won and all you have to do is pick up
[1:10:19] the spoil all you have to do is receive
[1:10:20] the blessings
[1:10:22] they said they says there were four
[1:10:24] leprous men of the entering into the
[1:10:26] gate
[1:10:26] and they said one to another why sit
[1:10:28] here why sit here
[1:10:30] we here until we die because you see
[1:10:33] you've got to make up in your mind that
[1:10:36] you're coming out
[1:10:37] you've got to set in your mind that's
[1:10:39] why brother brown preached that sermon
[1:10:40] desperation
[1:10:41] because you get to a place where you
[1:10:43] become desperate i am coming out of this
[1:10:46] eggshell
[1:10:46] i'm coming out i don't care if nobody
[1:10:49] around me is getting the holy ghost i am
[1:10:51] going to get it i don't care if nobody
[1:10:53] around me
[1:10:53] believes that you got to come to the
[1:10:55] capstone i'm believing what brother
[1:10:57] branham said about
[1:10:58] it and i'm coming i'm going all the way
[1:11:00] somebody is going to believe
[1:11:02] so far that the devil won't be able to
[1:11:04] do nothing with you and i'm going to be
[1:11:06] that one
[1:11:07] that's the kind of person that's going
[1:11:08] to accept that's going to step into
[1:11:10] all the promises that's going to walk
[1:11:12] into the promises of god
[1:11:14] and you see what what causes that
[1:11:16] eggshell to hatch
[1:11:18] to be in the right atmosphere right if
[1:11:20] you take
[1:11:21] if you take somebody that's been
[1:11:22] impregnated by the word of god that's
[1:11:24] been let's receive the word and you put
[1:11:26] them in the right atmosphere
[1:11:28] the songs begin to be sung and their
[1:11:30] mind begins to meditate on the scripture
[1:11:32] and the channel begins to open up and
[1:11:34] they begin to say i i accept the word
[1:11:36] i accept my healing now i accept the
[1:11:39] promise of god
[1:11:40] that god is going to fill me with the
[1:11:41] holy ghost because he's spoken
[1:11:43] and i believe that where it's written
[1:11:45] that written promises for me
[1:11:47] something is going to happen because you
[1:11:49] see brother brown said the atmosphere
[1:11:51] is your attitude toward the word the
[1:11:54] atmosphere
[1:11:55] atmosphere is not what you feel it's
[1:11:57] your attitude towards the word
[1:12:00] do you know you can create an atmosphere
[1:12:03] you can create an atmosphere by speaking
[1:12:05] the word when you say i believe it
[1:12:06] i believe it that's creating an
[1:12:08] atmosphere when you sit there and you
[1:12:10] say i receive it
[1:12:11] that's creating an atmosphere the
[1:12:12] atmosphere will hatch the egg
[1:12:15] that is what will cause that little
[1:12:16] chicken or that little eagle to come
[1:12:18] forth with that egg
[1:12:19] when you say i believe it i know it's
[1:12:21] true
[1:12:24] you see the wrong you can be in the
[1:12:25] wrong atmosphere the wrong atmosphere is
[1:12:27] when you say well i might fail
[1:12:29] when you begin to say well it might not
[1:12:31] be right what that preacher is saying
[1:12:33] when you begin to say i i don't think
[1:12:35] the preacher likes me
[1:12:37] or i i don't think he said that right
[1:12:39] that's that's the wrong atmosphere
[1:12:41] or i don't like the way this service is
[1:12:43] going that's the wrong atmosphere but
[1:12:44] when you begin to say
[1:12:46] i believe that that is the right
[1:12:48] atmosphere and it'll hatch
[1:12:50] it'll hatch if you're in a
[1:12:51] denominational surface it'll hatch if
[1:12:53] you're
[1:12:53] it doesn't matter where it'll hatch in
[1:12:55] the middle of a cornfield it'll hatch in
[1:12:57] the middle of a muddy spot in the field
[1:12:59] it'll hatch because you're coming with
[1:13:00] the right approach
[1:13:02] i believe god's word
[1:13:05] they see you got to get desperate when
[1:13:07] you get begin to get to a place where
[1:13:09] you say i
[1:13:09] am not satisfied where i am that
[1:13:12] something is beginning to move
[1:13:15] brother said you throw everything aside
[1:13:17] and open up the channel and say god your
[1:13:19] word is eternally true
[1:13:21] and it's for me if the whole church
[1:13:23] fails if the whole
[1:13:25] world fails yet i can't fail because
[1:13:28] i'm taking your word there's the battle
[1:13:32] listen listen to how the little chick
[1:13:34] comes out he comes
[1:13:35] out by his mouth he's got a little
[1:13:38] pecker on the end of his beak
[1:13:40] and he begins to peck and peck and
[1:13:42] that's how you come out
[1:13:43] by speaking the word do you see how it
[1:13:45] works well if you've got ears to hear
[1:13:48] then you will receive the word and it
[1:13:50] begins to produce something down on the
[1:13:52] inside of you
[1:13:53] and then your arm to begin to speak you
[1:13:55] can speak it and you can say i'm coming
[1:13:58] out
[1:13:58] i'm coming out i believe i believe the
[1:14:01] word i believe
[1:14:02] i believe his promises and you're coming
[1:14:04] out you see
[1:14:05] that's how you come out from the world
[1:14:07] that's how you come up through the
[1:14:08] promises
[1:14:09] that's how you come up through the
[1:14:10] capstone that's how you're going to take
[1:14:12] a body change
[1:14:13] by speaking what you have heard you've
[1:14:16] heard it
[1:14:16] and now you can speak it listen don't
[1:14:19] don't you ever let somebody say
[1:14:20] that you don't have a right to speak the
[1:14:22] word don't you ever let somebody say you
[1:14:24] don't have a right to be
[1:14:25] the voice of god in this age you the
[1:14:28] bride is the voice
[1:14:29] because she's heard the word and she can
[1:14:31] speak it you've heard it and now you've
[1:14:33] got a right to speak it
[1:14:35] you can say it because you know it
[1:14:37] because it's been revealed to you
[1:14:38] because you've heard it from the prophet
[1:14:42] you come out just the same way that
[1:14:44] little eagle chick comes out
[1:14:46] by his mouth by your mouth by speaking
[1:14:49] it
[1:14:52] well i might be the only one excited
[1:14:53] here tonight but that's all right
[1:14:56] brother brown said we just accept the
[1:14:57] word upon the basis god said so and sets
[1:15:00] a stream between you and god
[1:15:02] every channel comes open between you and
[1:15:04] god then
[1:15:07] he said and there is only one way
[1:15:10] provided by god for anything he said if
[1:15:12] people would just don't try to inject
[1:15:14] their own ideas
[1:15:15] but just take it the way god said it
[1:15:17] believing it
[1:15:18] see it it seems to be so hard
[1:15:22] for man just to get out of his own ideas
[1:15:25] just he's got to have something to do
[1:15:27] into it himself
[1:15:29] he's always gone up if you'd excuse the
[1:15:32] expression
[1:15:33] he's always gummed up god's way for him
[1:15:36] by his and by injecting his own way into
[1:15:40] it
[1:15:40] by jetting his own way well i got to see
[1:15:44] a pillar of fire i got to feel something
[1:15:45] i got to do this
[1:15:46] i got to come this way or that way or
[1:15:48] whatever any other way but by god's
[1:15:51] revealed word
[1:15:52] god's provided way is through his word
[1:15:55] his word that he's given to you if you
[1:15:57] believe it and accept it
[1:15:58] he said have they ever do you think they
[1:16:00] could find a better way for a chicken to
[1:16:02] be born
[1:16:03] than to peck its way out of the shell i
[1:16:06] just wonder if you could find
[1:16:07] any better way no sir he was born with a
[1:16:11] little pip on the end of his little bill
[1:16:14] and every time his little head knocks
[1:16:15] back and forth
[1:16:18] amen amen amen his head
[1:16:21] nodding back and forth amen i believe
[1:16:24] the word
[1:16:24] he scratches that shell until he
[1:16:27] scratches
[1:16:28] himself out yes sir you will never find
[1:16:30] a better way
[1:16:31] because that is god's provided way now
[1:16:34] here's the frustrating thing about this
[1:16:36] for ministers
[1:16:38] is the chickens got to pick his own way
[1:16:40] out
[1:16:41] i would love to be able to peg people
[1:16:43] out i would love to be able to just
[1:16:45] lay my hands on somebody and just give
[1:16:47] them the holy ghost like that
[1:16:49] but you got to pick your own way out
[1:16:51] you've got to pick your own way out
[1:16:53] and see if you're sitting here listening
[1:16:55] to me this
[1:16:56] this afternoon and you're saying i i
[1:16:58] don't believe anything that he's saying
[1:17:00] i don't believe that's right or arguing
[1:17:01] with it within yourself
[1:17:03] there's no way for you to pick your way
[1:17:04] out you've got to pick your way out it's
[1:17:07] like the saying goes that you can lead a
[1:17:09] horse to water but you can't make him
[1:17:10] drink you can lead him over there and
[1:17:12] say there's some water
[1:17:13] if you'll drink it your thirst will be
[1:17:16] quenched
[1:17:17] and you can tell you can tell a
[1:17:18] congregation full of people if you'll
[1:17:20] just accept god's word and believe it
[1:17:22] then you can have eternal life but
[1:17:23] they've got to pick their own way out
[1:17:26] you've got to pick your own way out of
[1:17:28] the shell
[1:17:29] he said poor little chicken you know i'm
[1:17:31] going to get a better way for you i'm
[1:17:32] just going to crack the shell and pick
[1:17:34] you out it would kill him
[1:17:35] that's right he would die he wouldn't
[1:17:38] live
[1:17:39] he's got to do that in order to build
[1:17:41] his strength enough to receive the air
[1:17:44] and things when he comes out he's
[1:17:46] provided with a tool
[1:17:48] he has got that little pip you've seen
[1:17:50] it little birds and chickens and
[1:17:52] as he nods his little head i believe him
[1:17:56] he scratches that egg back and forth
[1:17:58] until he peeps his way out if you'll
[1:18:00] take that as an example or in a way of
[1:18:02] making a point
[1:18:03] that's god that's god's way for
[1:18:05] christians to be born
[1:18:07] now walk up to the altar and give a man
[1:18:09] your right hand and put your name on the
[1:18:11] book
[1:18:11] but get down there and peep and cry
[1:18:14] and beg and plead and till god gives you
[1:18:17] strength
[1:18:18] then you come forth out of the shell of
[1:18:20] the world if somebody pastor just cracks
[1:18:22] the shell and takes you out say oh well
[1:18:24] that's all right we'll take you in
[1:18:25] anyhow
[1:18:26] you're dead that's all there is to it
[1:18:29] you got to like the bible says work your
[1:18:31] way work out your salvation with
[1:18:33] fear and trembling you've got to get
[1:18:36] down there and find out whether it's
[1:18:37] true or not
[1:18:38] you got to get down there and get
[1:18:40] serious with god and realize that
[1:18:42] there's something
[1:18:43] lacking in your life and and pray
[1:18:46] and see god and read your bible and all
[1:18:49] those things that are encompassed in
[1:18:51] pipping your way out of that shell
[1:18:55] i'm trying to find a stopping place now
[1:18:58] and this is hard this is hard to find a
[1:19:00] stopping place y'all
[1:19:01] y'all bear with me just a little bit
[1:19:03] longer are we doing okay i know there's
[1:19:05] some sleepy eyes in here but there's
[1:19:06] some that are not sleepy
[1:19:09] so some maybe are are getting something
[1:19:13] listen right here in the middle of this
[1:19:16] sermon
[1:19:17] brother brown's talking about the
[1:19:19] greatest battle ever fought and he
[1:19:20] begins
[1:19:21] he switches over to talk about
[1:19:23] ministering spirits why does he do that
[1:19:26] he begins to read in hebrews chapter one
[1:19:29] but to which of the angels said he at
[1:19:30] any time sit on my right hand until i
[1:19:32] make down enemies
[1:19:33] that footstall thy footstool are they
[1:19:36] not
[1:19:36] all ministering spirits sent forth to
[1:19:39] minister for them who shall be heirs of
[1:19:41] salvation
[1:19:42] and he begins to talk about the
[1:19:44] preaching of the gospel why did he do
[1:19:46] that right in the middle of this sermon
[1:19:47] well he's talking about how you got to
[1:19:49] pick your way out of the shell
[1:19:50] you gotta you you've got to believe the
[1:19:53] word
[1:19:54] that you're fighting a battle in your
[1:19:55] mind and right there in the middle he
[1:19:57] starts talking about preachers
[1:19:59] it's because preachers give you
[1:20:01] something to fight with
[1:20:02] that's why you come to churches because
[1:20:04] what you need to fight with
[1:20:05] what you need to overcome the devil is
[1:20:07] is the word of god
[1:20:10] now now wake up on me just for a little
[1:20:12] bit if you've got to pip your way out by
[1:20:15] speaking and agreeing with the word
[1:20:17] you've got to have the word and the
[1:20:19] minister there
[1:20:20] is not the minister is not there to hurt
[1:20:22] you like so many people think the
[1:20:23] minister's going to tell me that i'm
[1:20:24] wrong
[1:20:26] what greater blessing could there be
[1:20:27] than for a minister to tell you you're
[1:20:29] going about it the wrong way
[1:20:31] try this do this instead
[1:20:34] instead of doing like you've been doing
[1:20:36] and just beating your head against the
[1:20:38] wall
[1:20:38] try try getting into the bible try
[1:20:41] listening to the message on the way to
[1:20:42] work
[1:20:43] in school and in your car try getting
[1:20:46] along with god and meditating on the
[1:20:48] word
[1:20:48] and agreeing with it and not beating
[1:20:50] your head against the wall but agreeing
[1:20:51] with it
[1:20:52] it's the word that you're after a word
[1:20:55] birth
[1:20:56] the minister the ministering spirit is
[1:20:58] there to minister and
[1:21:00] now where this sermon in this sermon
[1:21:02] there's two spirits right
[1:21:03] so there's false ministers and there's
[1:21:06] true ministers
[1:21:07] and you've got to be able to tell the
[1:21:08] difference and the way that you tell the
[1:21:10] difference
[1:21:11] now maybe just in a baby form in a baby
[1:21:14] form the way that you tell the
[1:21:15] difference is a false minister
[1:21:17] will try to add something heaps
[1:21:19] something on your head that you got to
[1:21:21] do
[1:21:21] or take away a blessing from the bride
[1:21:23] of christ
[1:21:24] or you can't be the voice of god in this
[1:21:26] state or you can't have those bl
[1:21:28] the the the miracles and signs and
[1:21:30] wonders and those things those are from
[1:21:32] another day
[1:21:32] that he god is not hebrews 13 8 he's not
[1:21:35] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:21:37] works different in this day
[1:21:38] than he did back then and it becomes
[1:21:40] somebody robbing you of a blessing
[1:21:42] well i don't know if you can get your
[1:21:44] healing now because healing was for
[1:21:46] another day and they're robbing you of a
[1:21:47] blessing
[1:21:48] or somebody heaps something on your head
[1:21:50] well you got to go through all these
[1:21:52] motions and get emotional and stuff
[1:21:54] somebody's adding to you see if you add
[1:21:56] something or take something away you're
[1:21:58] taking
[1:21:59] you're just messing the whole plan up if
[1:22:01] you add
[1:22:02] or take away there'll be curses added or
[1:22:04] taken for curses added to you or your
[1:22:07] name will be taken out of the book of
[1:22:08] life because you're just messing up the
[1:22:10] whole plan of god
[1:22:12] that's why ministering is such a
[1:22:13] treacherous thing it's got to be brought
[1:22:16] in just a perfect way so that people can
[1:22:18] be born again
[1:22:19] by the word and brother adam said how do
[1:22:21] we know they are how do we know that
[1:22:22] they are ministering spirits
[1:22:24] the bible says that the word of the lord
[1:22:26] came to the prophets is that right
[1:22:29] these angels minister his word through
[1:22:31] his spirit
[1:22:32] minister the word through the holy
[1:22:33] spirit and the spirit and the word came
[1:22:35] to the prophets
[1:22:36] and the prophets had the word of god so
[1:22:39] you know
[1:22:40] that it's true because they're preaching
[1:22:41] to you the word of god and they're not
[1:22:43] taking away nothing from you
[1:22:44] and they're not adding anything to it
[1:22:46] they're just preaching a blessing to you
[1:22:49] they're preaching to you that you can
[1:22:50] still get the holy ghost how to get the
[1:22:52] statue of perfect man
[1:22:53] that these virtues are required that
[1:22:56] there's a capstone that you can grow
[1:22:58] into
[1:22:59] that brother brown didn't just preach to
[1:23:00] show you another way a better way to get
[1:23:02] the baptism in the holy ghost
[1:23:03] but he preached to get us out of here to
[1:23:06] take a body change
[1:23:07] and that is preaching the true gospel i
[1:23:09] believe
[1:23:10] but somebody that will take any of those
[1:23:12] things away from you and detract from
[1:23:14] you
[1:23:14] it becomes a twist of the truth and it
[1:23:17] will lead you off into a valley a gutter
[1:23:19] or a ditch
[1:23:20] how can the blind lead the blind if you
[1:23:22] can't see where you're going
[1:23:23] but if you can see where you're going
[1:23:25] you can lead other people
[1:23:26] to the right path and that's why he
[1:23:29] begins to talk about ephesians chapter
[1:23:31] four i love ephesians chapter 4
[1:23:33] why did he give some apostles prophets
[1:23:35] and evangelists and some pastors and
[1:23:37] teachers
[1:23:38] for the perfecting of the saints so that
[1:23:40] you would know that there's a statue of
[1:23:42] a perfect man that you're growing into
[1:23:43] so that you would know that there's a
[1:23:45] head that you're growing into into
[1:23:46] christ so that you would grow
[1:23:48] from a little babe that's tossed around
[1:23:50] and doesn't know which way he's going
[1:23:52] into the full stature of a perfect man
[1:23:54] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:23:56] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:23:58] every wind of doctrine
[1:23:59] by the slight of man and cunning
[1:24:01] craftiness whereby they lay it lie and
[1:24:04] wait to deceive
[1:24:05] that's why god sent a fivefold ministry
[1:24:08] so that you would not be deceived
[1:24:10] that's why there's such a thing as
[1:24:12] ministering spirits so that you will not
[1:24:14] be deceived and so that you
[1:24:16] could pick your way out of the shell so
[1:24:18] that you could be born
[1:24:20] out of this world into the promises of
[1:24:22] god into a higher reach
[1:24:29] anything to keep you in the egg is a lie
[1:24:32] from the devil
[1:24:33] anything to keep you trapped and stuck
[1:24:35] and thinking well i'm all right
[1:24:37] i must be all right i think i'm all
[1:24:39] right because i was so and so said
[1:24:42] that and so might be your grandma for
[1:24:44] years ago or your daddy
[1:24:46] or a false minister some little lie that
[1:24:48] was twisted to make you think you're all
[1:24:50] right but god sent a ministering spirit
[1:24:52] into the church to tell you the truth
[1:24:55] so that you would be born right so that
[1:24:57] you would know whether you're right or
[1:24:58] wrong
[1:24:59] that's why that i think one of the
[1:25:02] greatest things that god could give to
[1:25:04] the church
[1:25:04] is the gospel preached through men
[1:25:09] that's also why i believe that you if
[1:25:12] coming out of your shell by speaking the
[1:25:14] word
[1:25:15] is how to get out of that shell then the
[1:25:17] greatest form of
[1:25:18] worship would be the preaching of the
[1:25:20] gospel because the preaching of the
[1:25:22] gospel
[1:25:23] is the spoken word preached to free
[1:25:26] people from that shell
[1:25:32] oh my see what his tactic what he's
[1:25:34] trying to do i'm skimming through some
[1:25:35] of these quotes
[1:25:42] and then brother let me let me let me
[1:25:44] i'm close on this brother branham he
[1:25:46] ends with this dream that he has
[1:25:47] talking about the boatman and how he's
[1:25:49] going to store up food and he says in
[1:25:50] the dream i was just ordering all kinds
[1:25:52] of cabbages
[1:25:53] and turnips and radishes and things pile
[1:25:56] them in there like that
[1:25:57] and then i woke up why in the dream
[1:26:00] was he storing up cabbages because
[1:26:03] there's a shell for us to get out of
[1:26:06] and the way to get out of that shell the
[1:26:08] musicians can go ahead and come on
[1:26:10] the way to get out of that shell is by
[1:26:12] the word
[1:26:13] and that is what he was storing up he
[1:26:15] laid up he stored up for us
[1:26:17] not not just a better way to be born
[1:26:20] again but he stored up for
[1:26:22] us the fulfillment of the scriptures
[1:26:24] malachi 4 5-6

[1:26:28] all those things
[1:26:29] to turn his heart to give us the word to
[1:26:32] turn our hearts back to the original
[1:26:34] faith
[1:26:34] to the original faith of the pentecostal
[1:26:36] fathers to give us an understanding
[1:26:39] to break out of the shell to break out
[1:26:41] of the shell not just to the word but to
[1:26:43] the world but to break out of this shell
[1:26:46] of our
[1:26:47] of our mortal carnal body that we're in
[1:26:50] because when you receive the seven seal
[1:26:53] mysteries when you eat
[1:26:54] that kind of a food it's going to give
[1:26:57] you power
[1:26:58] to break out of the bonds of this flesh
[1:27:01] into
[1:27:01] it it's going to change your body you
[1:27:04] believe that tonight
[1:27:05] let's just stand and worship the lord
[1:27:14] yes sir i believe the word is actually
[1:27:16] claiming you as you hear it
[1:27:18] the word is staking claim on your life
[1:27:20] right as you feast on it
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:40] it'll make you a new creature in christ
[1:27:42] jesus
[1:27:43] it will open up your eyes so that you
[1:27:46] can see right
[1:27:47] it'll open up your ears so that you can
[1:27:50] hear right
[1:27:51] it'll cause your mouth to be able to
[1:27:53] speak right and cause your feet to walk
[1:27:56] right
[1:27:57] it'll put your hands to a different kind
[1:27:59] of work
[1:28:00] the word of god received and a pure and
[1:28:03] a contri heart will
[1:28:04] change you it will change your
[1:28:15] aren't you glad for that kind of change

[1:28:27] my hands used to do things of the world
[1:28:30] my feet used to do things of the world

[1:28:32] now i've been changed is that your
[1:28:34] testimony

[1:28:38] creature
[1:28:40] that old man is dead and now you're
[1:28:43] alive in christ

[1:28:52] afternoon i wonder if it's maybe time to
[1:28:55] break out of that shield

[1:28:58] desperate with god
[1:29:01] to come to the knowledge that you're not
[1:29:03] where you ought to be
[1:29:07] if you're not where you ought to be god
