there as well there's two in there as well so um so we're gonna go ahead and get started and let's just go to the lord in prayer before we get started and then we're going to turn to matthew 28 our heavenly father we thank you once again for the opportunity that we have lord to open back the pages of your word lord we ask father that that you were just lord intervene in our in our midst father god and lord just speak to our hearts father god lord here in this little second part of the presentation i pray lord that that you would just lord use it father god to speak somebody's heart and and lord maybe lord help them to see something maybe maybe they might get a revelation to to to go themselves somewhere father god lord jesus you know father god maybe some young person here lord jesus father maybe that's what you have them to do later on in life we don't know but you know lord god and so we pray lord jesus that you'd have your way this he this afternoon lord may you just continue to touch those that are sick amongst us continue lord jesus to have father god touching those that are not with us lord god so many needs and sick ones amongst us father but lord god you're the god of all these needs lord jesus you knew these needs before the foundation of the world father and we know that you're more than able and you're just as much healer as you was father god when you died on the cross of calvary lord jesus lord we love you and we appreciate you and when we commit the service into your hands now in jesus christ's name amen praise god amen let's turn to matthew chapter 28 matthew chapter 28 i i felt led to read this scripture very familiar scripture to us um and it's entitled in the in the uh in the bible as the great commission in verse 16. and jesus says jesus says some things here he says in verse 16 that says then the 11 disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them and when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power all power is given unto me in heaven and earth so all power at this point was given to him he had he had raised from the dead amen so he had conquered death hell in the grave praise god and so he said all power is given unto him amen and if all if he has all power then what is he he's god amen and when you have him in you then what do you have all power i believe that amen praise god and this is this is one of the things that i was trying to get across to the people while we were down there in honduras nicaragua there were several times where i used the scripture to talk to them about water baptism and the holy the holy spirit and uh when you show them that all power was given to him is it's like wow yes and he's in me well i got all power if you could if you could just come to that realization that all power amen praise god and then he says this he says this with all power he says go ye therefore and teach all nations amen in mark 16 he says go you tell the world preach the gospel amen but but it it it it's it's it's teaching preaching amen even when you're preaching you're still teaching because you're enlightening amen to people's eyes even an evangelist it's a form of teaching amen because then what's the next step to do to repent and stuff but i didn't know until the evangelist came through or to the teacher amen preach to preach the word you see so we need the faithful ministry go ye therefore and teach all nations all nations baptizing them in the name in the name of the father end of the son and of the holy ghost not in the name of the father not in the name of the son in the name of the holy ghost now in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them teaching them to observe all things all things amen whatsoever i have commanded you in other words teaching them to observe the word that i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen praise the lord you may be seated and i wanted to read this quote if the brothers can pull this quote up amen brother branham says here brother if you want to turn on the purple mic please thank you i couldn't get the the praise hey man i couldn't get the little head thing here maybe maybe next time but he says here in in the end time the message the end time 1954 but i am so happy to be here but the more was just telling me that they had taken up an offering for missionary work to be given over to me for missionary work i thank thank you may god bless you and that's what i say to each and every one of you i say to the church if it that offering that the church gave and the different times that you all gave really really helped and so we we just thank god amen they helped them it helped them i just don't know how to say it i it's just something about missionary and i believe he was going to say missionary work missionary that i that i know that what that i'm sorry missionary that i just i just love it and i just know that what you're doing you're doing god's will when you give to missions that is right it's not fair that one person hear the gospel twice when somebody hasn't heard it once see everybody should hear the gospel at least once and i want to do my part to try to take the gospel to everybody that i know how every place used to on the difference of the the re remunerations of the meeting and what i'd had left over i'd give it to the charity organizations and so forth now i have nothing at all against them not at all and i think they're all fine every one of them from the salvation army and the volunteers of america the red cross polio drives and many of those things it's good to give to those things but i thought the people that comes to my meeting are people who are usually poor people and they're interested in the kingdom of god while common run off people that doesn't go to church businessmen and so forth writes checks for them drives and so forth for thousands and thousands of dollars while a poor missionary suffers with a lack after all we know that we like to see everybody well we like to see people that's hungry be fed but you know the soul is the most important thing of anything in the mortal amen because that's the thing that lasts forever and you know when i believe that every christian is obligated to be a missionary i believe every christian is obligated now not so much as you have to go over in the old countries and preach or something but if you can't go you can help send somebody else you see what you do to send somebody else and did you ever think what jesus said about when the disciples asked him when he would return again why he said show us the sign that when he would return he said you'll hear of wars and rumors of wars let me ask you this is that are we hearing that all right you'll hear of fathers against mothers and mothers and parents against children and so forth do we hear that you could look in the news and you can see some terrible terrible incidents but that's not yet he says he said there'll be time when they'd be all different and the morals the morals you know how they are now today that mary and given in marriage and so forth it's not yet but he said when this gospel is preached to all the world then he'd return amen and where and where we have done and where we have done christian friends we've failed miserably is that right amen now that was in 1953 i believe it was and ever since then the gospel has definitely advanced amen this message has gone across the world and it's in such a in such a huge way through printing through um and now it's more advanced now it's going faster because you know because of the advent of the internet so it gets spread much faster and faster so i believe we're at the end time saints i believe we are at the end time and so if if we think in our minds well it doesn't matter what's going on in the country such and such or i'm not too concerned about what's going such and such amen those people need the gospel too people people need people need to hear the gospel and there's people that that that i that i came across that they hadn't even they hadn't even been to church so if you can at least say something to get them motivated to start coming to church you know hey it was worth spending a plane ticket to go there you know so i just thank you all amen appreciate each and every one of you i felt led to to read that because it's you it's you that did it amen and through your prayers you're the ones that did it all right here we go part two brother brother brother anderson he's our he's the one working back there all right so we're going to turn off the lights here again what's so funny oh brother the anderson did it remotely [Laughter] all right so last time last time we we stopped uh we we we were um we were in holland this is the holancho in honduras and so and so now we're we're um we're still there because a lot took place there so that's just wanted to give you a point where we're we're at next all right so here um after we had come from the mountains remember the trip we've gone to the mountains uh we went to brother elise church and he had asked me if i could help him with a with a wedding a couple that was getting married this couple they um they were just coming to the lord and so next this is the couple right here and um this is brother ellie he's right now the one in charge of the of this church right now he's not the pastor right now they're praying for a pastor but his call is missionary and he's an evangelist but uh so we were we were helping i was helping him marry this couple and uh this couple right there at the altar they accepted the lord jesus as their savior so not only did they get married to each other but they added a third person in there [Laughter] and that was the lord jesus christ amen later on the next day i got the privilege to baptize both of them in the name of the lord jesus next sideways so right here we're uh we're we're praying uh the the sinner's prayer with them amen and they came they came to the lord jesus there we go right there next all right here we are with them this is sister suwanee and brother gosh i forget i'm so terrible with names i was looking at my wife to see if i can get that help huh well he said no it's not moy says i know that next all right this is it they're after the the wedding this is some some food afterwards next all right and after we we had married uh the we had the wedding there we went to a brother's house there and he asked us to go there to see if we could pray for his home apparently there's been some paranormal activity in his home and he wanted prayer for his house so we gave them prayer cloths and told him to put it in corners of his house uh and uh me and brother ely who was there as well we we we prayed for his home that there's been some different situations that they were talking about next so here uh i'm i'm just telling them and this is the brother's house right here this is his wife and he's got three children next all right so we prayed for them and i told them one of the things and this this applies to you all as well you know a wonderful thing to do is to just have the prophet playing in the background have scripture playing in the black in the background the whole time you know because that warts off demons i believe that amen the word of god amen words off demons you know not the tape or not but it's the word of god i encourage them to do that you know in their home so this is the the church again the following day uh and so i knew that that we were going to have a baptism some baptisms that day so i felt led that day that morning to teach them about water baptism and and and just go in depth with it because they they hear water baptism in the name lord jesus christ and they know they don't they know it's it's in the word but when you actually give them the scriptures give them quotes and just really dig into it it helps solidify that even more you see next all right and uh right before right before um we had service this is the church this is brother elise church and they're getting ready to build unto the church right here so he was showing me the little parcel uh where they started the work right here um they have some they have some um some funds that were that were donated to them uh from one of the churches up in ohio and so they're gonna get that going uh some of the funds that you all gave went to help and pay some of those brothers that are going to be working on that church they're going to be working all week or two weeks in a row and they're going to be leaving their own job in order to work on the church so they're not going to be getting paid to feed you know help feed their family just because they're dedicating their whole time to the church so some of those funds went to help them and to help him and that and that so next all right this is the beginning of the of the service as i said a lot of them they usually they they have accustomed to go to the altar and just pray before before they get started which i i think that's wonderful and so as you as the parent does you know your children follow as well next all right this is if the brothers i don't know if there's this is a little at the song service you see this the church has grown a lot and it's it's it's very small so that's why they're gonna add on to it this is the sister that we married yet the the day before sister suwani okay next all right and this is me coming out all right next yes you must be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ next all right so this is after the service this is where we were walking to the to the river um go to the waters i don't know if you want to turn that up here are some of the brethren uh behind us i believe there's one or two people that are going to get baptized it could be four but i'm not i'm not totally sure careful but christine was walking in front of me so um so originally yeah i thought that there was going to be about two three people uh they were going to get baptized but then as we were baptizing more work more were coming more kept coming they wanted to get baptized or re-baptized so it was a total of seven people that we baptized next um [Music] yeah this would be second second week [Music] next all right the first sister we baptized as the sister uh she she was up from the mountains where we were uh where we were at and uh she she got baptized i think she's like 13 14 years old next then this brother came and he he wanted to get baptized as well next and that sister suwani the sister they got married the day before and so she she she wanted to get baptized and so we baptized her in the name of the lord jesus christ next uh and then little marquitos his name is marcos and he wanted to get baptized and so hey come come in next and then and then this is brother sister suwanee's uh husband and he wanted to get baptized as well so we went ahead and baptized him they have to get where we were at they had to get in their knees on their knees some of the taller ones and then i dip them that way because it was not a lot of water there next all right and then this br brother my brother roberto he came and wanted to get baptized as well actually he wanted to get re-baptized and kind of rededicate his life to the lord next and this young brother as well he wanted to get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ of them have already accepted the lord jesus but they just wanted to go on ahead and get baptized next and this is brother roberto right here if you want to turn it up a little bit and he wanted to put his stake down so the satan can see that this is it and so i baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of sins okay next all right and this is this little young brother getting baptized [Music] as you're baptizing their their you know sometimes they they kept playing and and and i would tell them something sometimes i would tell them to stop but they're like no no you go ahead we just keep playing they stop there his name is brother kevin [Music] amen next all right this is afterwards um they're at the river next all right and um and so we had a final prayer with some of the brethren and i gave them a final a final word in regards to uh how to continue uh you know because i explained to them some sometimes we kind of get an idea and the lord can do that he'd give you the holy ghost right there at that that in that water but sometimes it's it's a it's a fight you know it's a continual amen it's being born again the bible says and and i told him listen the way you you get the holy ghost is by receiving his word as you listen to the word as you go to church and you listen to the word and you read the word and you study the word amen that is you are receiving his spirit amen because his words are spirit and truth amen he said my words are spirit and truth so i was trying to explain that to them to tell them listen you don't you didn't have to feel anything you don't have to feel anything when you went down the water and now now it's the battle now it's a it's a fight for you to continue on amen as you're feeding on the word you're receiving that word amen and so we had a final prayer with them there and i encourage them in that way next all right so that evening uh we went and visited another brother's church uh brother uh naftali and uh in about an hour away in catacamas and and this is his little church there next actually it's not a small church it's a big church next this is uh some of them singing the special this is brother that got baptized this morning that morning [Music] all right that's that's the pastor brother neph dudley next and this is me uh preaching to them and i was bringing them that little thought from uh at this moment about james chapter four uh draw night unto god and he will draw an eye on to you amen it's not it's not you drawing i unto god and god's just there waiting for you no as you're doing your part he's doing his and so that's what i was trying to bring across to them [Applause] as well [Applause] and you might say well you you all may have heard me saying that here but to them that's important and the reason why is because to them they think that it's all about works what i can do to please god but they don't understand that god there's a part that he wants to do but when you do your part he does his you see so so and it's just a thing that that just trying to get him out of that mindset he's the one that does it for us amen we just we just get into it amen and ride as that as brother brandon would talk about that vision that he on the right i'm riding on it i'm riding on it amen he's the one who's in control amen praise god next all right and afterwards we had a prayer and we're there praying for the people next all right and we took uh we took on this trip about 20 um about 22 bibles they were donated from brother berry coffee they're in hickory north carolina and this is one of the sisters receiving the bible she doesn't have she didn't have a bible so we gave her a bible next this is a young sister who had a bible but it was it was it was a bible that the translation or the interpretation into spanish wasn't wasn't good and so we went ahead and gave her a new bible and next all right so now after all that hard day's work we get some leisure time and of course the dogs are looking at you there's dogs everywhere there so when you eat this is what this is what uh you got dogs there just looking at you of course you got beans right beans and rice we got plenty of that over there actually we ate so much of it it actually starts hurting you really bad next all right so the uh the following uh the following day we we took a break and then we went back to talanga where brother eric brother eric's house was we we we rested that monday and then on tuesday brother eric and some other or uh some other brothers we went up to uh they were gonna have a minister's meeting about three hours away from from talanga and uh this is a minister's meeting uh the day it started this is all ministers and pastors from around the country in honduras just meeting in one place and they usually do this bi-monthly they just have meetings together and just fellowship together and uh and they don't really talk about doctrines and things like that they just kind of have fellowship to keep that that going you see like we have fellowship meetings here so that that's that's good that they do that next and then at nights in those fellowship meetings they have a tent this tent was donated here from brethren in the united states and so in that tent anybody can go to those meetings and so they're more of evangelistic like so that that's that's when they started it's about four day meeting next next okay so they invited they asked me to speak on one of the nights i believe was out that week on that wednesday night and i got to preach to about 500 people there um and so there was a lot of there was a lot of people there the last night i would say about 600 or so people there and really wonderful time we had next next this is right after i had preached i had preached on blind bartimaeus and just talked about faith and just trying to get their faith and have faith in god and this is us worshiping afterwards [Music] no as i said you know they have that custom where where your sister sit on one side brother sit on the other side so that's why you see it like that [Music] okay so this time i'm going to ask my wife to come up and i'm going to ask zoe to come up as well so you don't have to hear my boring uh voice for for a little bit i want her to explain what's going on here because i wasn't there during during while we were at the minister's meeting three hours away my wife was back in talanga honduras and they were they were they used the funds uh they were given here to buy food for for people so i want her to explain about that so that was pretty much the trip he would be with us for a day or so and then he'd be out again so um the girls and i and sister rebecca she's a pastor's wife right there this is her mother-in-law this is her mom and we had started talking about because i know that people had given money and wanted to give some food also some clothes and after asking around i was finding out that people would actually sell their clothes for food so we just went ahead and got the food so this is around week two week three we initially had um budgeted for 16 bags 16 families but towards the end it ended up being 20 bags it wasn't gonna be for the whole church because the budget wouldn't i mean we could have done it but then we couldn't come back so the the pastor's wife she knew the people so she had decided she made the list of the people who needed it most so she was in charge of that it cost in total it went to about 400 to 450 dollars and rebecca and i went around town and we kind of negotiated with the the store the people that sold in bulk and you know i kind of had to say you know if you give us a deal we might just do this again in a bigger scale so but um so that's why we were able to get it down to that price um so it's pretty much the staples um you'll see that we had the stuff i'm trying to think of but it was beans we got at least 80 to 100 pounds of beans and we've got the rice the flour we've got pasta like you see them right there there's the rice sugar salt and their pasta sauces coffee we got them that also we got the laundry detergent for them dish soap powdered milk we got cooking oil there butter as well and even toilet paper which is yeah you don't you need food but it was nice to get on toilet paper but depending on the size of the family the bag i don't know if there is are there more slices can we get some more slides because we pack them up in um bags next so it was and we put a little bow later on and um depending on the size of the family it would have lasted them about two two weeks to a month so it's just you know it's just the staples but it went a long way and the testimony that goes with that this was just something that we wanted to do um so sister rebecca that friday night they have friday night meetings the girls and i decided to stay back because we weren't feeling too well after the service they came back and they called me i was upstairs and sister rebecca told me that a sister wanted to come and talk to me and she didn't tell the whole church that there were these donations she just told specific people and one of she told the couple sisters to you can either come tonight or tomorrow it's up to you like she was just telling them discreetly but that night right after service she wanted to come and she so i just thought she wanted to say thank you so you know that was that was great and but she came and told me actually that she was praying that day for god to give her some food because they didn't have any food the next day so that was the lord's answering her prayer so should i go ahead oh there's more pictures next so that's how they came they were they got pretty heavy but um the this match was pretty much dispersed in about three churches so it the plan was just for one church but um it just so happened that we were able to bring a few in this church and a few of the other churches can i go ahead and give my testimony so this is just pausing i wanted to going back to week two in honduras where we had the baptism you guys saw a little bit of the terrain that we had to go through to get to the water and then after the baptism after the baptism we were walking back i said i wasn't gonna cry so we were walking back the people were ahead of me luis was back there helping because there were a lot of people there were some elderly that came so he was helping them the terrain was really bad you had to really look at what you were walking on so i was just walking and i took a bad step and it was deeper than i thought no one was with me no one knew what happened and all i knew was my left foot popped and my vision went white and i felt pain shoot up my head and the thought that came to my mind was lord i need my left foot we still have five more weeks here i can't i can't be debilitated i need my foot so i just said thank you lord for healing me and i kept walking it hurt but each step i said thank you lord for healing me and i just kept walking and i kept saying thank you lord for healing me because i need my foot said i said i didn't come to honduras to lay in the bed for the next five weeks so it was still quite a bit of a walk and i was just by myself just kept saying and it took about 10 more minutes just walking but by the time we got to where the cars were i sat inside the car luis knew nothing the girls didn't know anything and but by then my foot was fine i didn't say anything to anyone and it was just that evening when luis found out about it but i didn't know that i would need that situation about two weeks later when we got to honduras the first sunday where it was too hot it was very very hot we were exhausted we walked we crossed the border by foot into nicaragua we crossed the border by foot it felt like we were a family that wanted a new life with new names with our luggage but we were we crossed by foot in the sun anyway that sunday we were exhausted and it was absolutely hot inside the church luis was preaching again he didn't know anything about it and i felt what they later told me i had a heat stroke i got up i was gonna go to the bathroom to just kind of cool off but by the time i got there they said i was sitting on the floor and they the pastor's wife got me and they took me to the office where they had air conditioning and all i can remember was louis preaching and they said i was mumbling but in my mind i was hearing myself saying lord you healed my left foot just two weeks ago i need that same healing now because i still need i still have two more weeks here and i just kept i remember just saying that in my head i thought i was saying it out loud but they said i was just mumbling they said my my lips turned green and my lips turned white but um after a while i just felt sweat and then i was okay after that but i remember thinking that's why i had i had to have that happen with my left foot to feel that that healing when when you didn't have anyone there and there's no doctor to help you but it brought me back to that time where i said lord you you healed my foot when i asked you so i need to be okay because look my husband's preaching and i need to be fine so here we are [Applause] do you remember the questions i'm sorry yeah i'm gonna get my phone here real quick so zoe zoe we have some questions for you and uh all right so zoe what was the hardest experience for you and i was about to faint you were about to faint yeah somewhere it was too hot was it honduras or nicaragua nicaragua it's very hot in the country of nicaragua that's where my wife where my wife was talking about and uh so it can get that it can get down to you know it can get to like you know 100 105 degrees every day every day is like that you know all right what was your best experience uh knowing that i walked up a mountain all the way to the top knowing that you walked up the mountain all the way to the top how long did it take to walk up that mountain four hours four hours and she did it all right when did you have the most fun uh i mean when i was playing with like some professional musicians when you were playing with professional musicians she said which th there's a lot of brethren there who just very talented a lot of gifts and she got to play with a lot of them uh all right what what did you what did you miss the most or what did you miss the most while you were down there uh two things um a keyboard that actually had keys that actually worked and high-speed wi-fi i think that was what bella missed too and after coming back home what are you most thankful for knowing that knowing that people over there they have harder lives and i should be thankful that i don't have a hard life like them we're all thankful for that amen well thank you very much we asked her she wanted to answer some questions so that was impromptu for her so thank thank god for that amen moving right along so we just thank god for this and you all you you all were part of this thank you lord next all right here's some of the sisters that are receiving some of the some of this food next all right so this back back where i was at this is the last night of the meeting under the tent and uh and brother miguel rubio who was there preaching he's uh he's a he's an evangelist he you can see more a lot more people here this tonight and it just a thunderstorm just came right through and it was raining pretty much almost the whole service and water was coming in into inside the tent and um and everybody but what it did is there was a lot of people gathered outside outside of the tent as well and what it did is it gathered people to go inside and uh we all just kind of huddled together this was a it got worse later and uh and uh next so this is that same night next so but that didn't stop from people wanting to get prayer i mean this right down here was flooded was flooded and just people worshipping the lord there was just a big puddle of water there in the front but and people were just sticking their feet in there i had to as well and just just worship worshiping the lord and and and you know and one in prayer and uh and just uh some of them uh giving them their lives to the lord right there and uh and so you can see it's still raining in the background but uh sometimes that that rain and the thunder i just some of the [Music] so lord blessed him amen because i didn't care about that i just wanted more closer walk with lord next i don't know all right so that was uh there after that the the meetings there the the ministers meetings we went to brother paco's house this is his his home here we spent the night that night there and brother paco uh this is uh he is full-time missionary there in honduras he used to he used to live here in the united states for a while and he he went to brother homer longoria's church for a while so he knows brother homer he's one of the interpreters in honduras because he speaks english and spanish and so when a lot of the brethren go down there he interprets he interprets for them so he's a very instrumental brother there here's brother robert he's a pastor there in honduras brother eric uh and then there's brother elie as well brother robert is brother eric's father-in-law next all right so that night we uh i i preached at brother uh eliseo's church which is which is about an hour away from brother paco's house where we were at and um and and so we ministered there that night next this is his church here next and this is a view from the platform next that's brother eliseo all right so the following that was that that was that day the following day we came back home and it was kind of like a a resting resting day we went to this uh place called cantaranas it's kind of like a ranch farm type place there but there was a there was a family member brother eric's who's a pastor there in honduras who was having his birthday he's an older brother and so they they wanted to celebrate his birthday up there and so we went there with them next this is just some of the some of the area next all right brother eric sister rebecca my wife and i next all right so i i say that uh you know sometimes some of you all see me and brother bob doing this number well brother eric is like my honduran brother bob we're always just laughing and cutting up but it's in spanish so uh we're that evening we're at a restaurant they're just just having a good time laughing cutting up next all right that was that same evening next all right and then and then that was that same evening there in a little in a little town a little park there that they had next all right and then the following day which was a sunday that was on a saturday the following day that brother that was having his birthday that we were celebrating there on saturday uh he wanted me to just preach at his church now he has the biggest church in all honduras and his brother melchizedek and uh but the brother is very old you know he's an older brother now and uh so he's kind of slowing down now he's not he's not preaching as much and so some other brothers are stepping up and so this is us preaching there the the following day next [Music] so i i preached to them that morning about the image of god the image of god in you [Music] [Applause] and i don't care what i was saying there so so next all right now that was sunday and then the following monday that monday the next day that's when we were going to go up to this uh place it was about the place that zoe was talking about it was about four hours away walking uh called mahala verde and we were going to deliver some food to them to those places some of those bags as well as uh visit a brother there that i was mentioning to you all last sunday who who never had anybody visit them before not anybody from the states and so we were going to visit that church next we left out that that morning and then that's that's us there's the food bags right here right behind them there's brother eric and there's brother estevan um brother estevan there's some more pictures of him brother steven he's about 21 22 years old and he was one of the ones who he actually last year two years ago was on um he was on one of those caravans of people coming in from from central america and he got you know he just wanted to take the opportunity to come and so he tried to come but when they got to around uh they got they went through guatemala they and they got to mexico and and when they got to the border of mexico in the united states he just gave himself in because he couldn't take it anymore he walked all that way from honduras and that was like i think it was 15 days that he walked just to get you know to to the states so he was one of those those that and he told me all about it and i mean the good thing is that he had age on his side he's 20 22 years old he was pretty young but uh next all right so now we got to a point to there in the mahara verde where where we couldn't take the truck up anymore that white truck so we had to we had to start walking and this is where the uh the three-hour trek was was that's me blowing my nose because i mean my allergies just really kicked in [Music] next all right and uh this right here on the left uh is brother esteban the brother now he he's walking with flip-flops on and he walked the whole way with flip-flops i hope he didn't walk to mexico that way either but next and it was it was hot but the views are beautiful now this is the truck trying to make it what what the truck would do this is like a 1982 little toy toyota and what what what if what the truck would do is we would go down i threw something in the truck and whatever try to do is try to get some speed you know so to make it you know to make it further and uh next so it finally got to a point where he couldn't go no more they would put rocks behind the tires to kind of hold it in and try to get you know to to get a so that when we push hopefully you know it would get it up next [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] this was us for about maybe 45 minutes and we sometimes would get it up a little bit further and then and so then he'd he'd roll it they'd roll it back down to try to start over again to you know to try to get a little push you know an impulse to go up and then back to level one next so finally there was a brother who had a motorcycle and this is the food that we were carrying the bags of food so we told them uh you know they were heavy so that's what we were hoping we could get the truck up there because we still had about another two hours and so the brother said well let's just put the food on the motorcycle so uh he got it on the motorcycle but that thing was so wobbly he about fell and so uh i don't know if i got video of that next um so some of us what we did and this is brother esteban you can see here by his flip-flops here and so that bag was heavy but he was carrying it carried it the whole way and uh so what a brother did is he got on that motorcycle another brother and he was able to to to write it up you know and was able to get the food to the to the people so thank god for that but there was at one point where he almost went back and i thought that seriously i have a video of it not here but i really thought that he was going to fall off the side of that mountain because that motorcycle was going back like this and by the grace of god nothing happened and the food was was saved as well next all right so this is the church we finally got to to the the church this is the pastor there and this this brother as i said this is brother rodolfo brother has been pastoring this church since 1974. he does everything there at the church and he doesn't have anybody really to to to help him and doesn't have a lot of vision doesn't hardly nobody no visitors to to you know guest ministers or anything like that uh one of the things that i wanted to mention is that his church is really worn out and uh it's actually it's cracking uh the foundations are really cracking and so he he was he was he asked for prayer about that and he also asked if uh monetarily if we could help so that he could fix his his church with the cracks and i have some some pictures and things of of that next this is up there in one of the areas uh when we were up there and we just went on to the side and took this picture of this little gorge usually there's a waterfall right here and there's a river down there uh believe it or not they told me the brethren that the people have jumped off there and committed suicide so it's a it's it's very easy for you to fall off and a lot of people know that and people that don't have the lord you know or you know they just want to end their life they've two or three people have committed suicide there that's what they told me next all right this is brother rodolfo's church we had we went to his house to eat first and then we went that's after a four-hour walk then we had we i had to preach so we all had service there and you can see in his church right there this is the where the church is cracking and so he's tried to fix you know uh right here you can see in the corners so he's trying to fix what they could you know but but it but but there's a lot of foundation problems and so uh they said that i'm at this very moment i told him to please get an estimate of how much things will cost and uh so we'll see because because there is still some some money left over from from what you all gave and and maybe we can send that to them next [Music] this is us having service there some of these people they're just they're just you know mountain people you know just all they know is farming ranching next all right we spoke to them that afternoon about um about when jesus said i am the vine and you are the branches next all right next all right afterwards we prayed for the people some of them came up and asked for for prayers the brother the pastor right there just a simple brother you know next all right and that's bella and zoe zoe sleeping there on the floor during the service after a four-hour walk next so i was praying for the people there next all right then afterwards a brother a brother went and grabbed the the bags of food and we went ahead and gave them some of the food there to some of those families there next now this is just some of the video of some of the of the church there so you can just kind of get an idea of of of what's going on with the church it's sideways this is an entrance one of the side entrances there there's just a very old building next this is the the the right there around the pulpit area so i don't know how much that that will cost to to to fix but um they know how to work with that all they need is just uh they need funds to buy the materials to next this is the walls and it's sideways as well the video but you can get an idea there next okay just giving them more food next and this is the pastor brother rodolfo just right before we were leaving see what time we got here i'm so sorry 3 26 okay we're still good all right next all right so as we were leaving uh we we got back on the truck there was another brother that went up there and met us so he had a better truck and so it got around much easier and uh zoe was entertaining him with something he was talking about a uh something a bug bite oh yeah bug bites on her arms and they were just intently listening to her [Laughter] next this is some of the video as we were going down the mountain a lot of all that that we trekked up walking is nice riding down now [Music] and this is just a very common thing you know they all just get on that back of the back of the trucks and just tightly and hang on all right next okay all right now the following day i preached at another church nearby this is brother lucas cardona's church and uh his his church originally is under this platform but they're building on top of it and and so they're they're there and they're gonna use that bottom part for something else so that's why it's kind of open because they're still not they're still not complete they're still not finished next and um just wanted to give a quick testimony as i was finishing ministering there they said that that evening a drunk man walks in into the into the into the service and he sets he sits there and starts listening of course the deacons they got you know make sure he wasn't going to do anything you know but afterwards i went over to him and i stood next to him and he said i really enjoyed your the sermon i said he said i really enjoyed what you had to say and so i i i told him thank you and i said can i pray for you and he said please that's why it came for and so we i prayed for for him there yeah and so hopefully you know we'll see where that led but i i we just thank god you know some somebody just randomly walking in in this church wanting wanting help you know why else would you walk into the church he's his life has come to a point now where i can't take this anymore and he smelled bad and everything but we pray for him you know so next this is during song service there that that day that same service next [Music] maybe even dead under the ground if it wasn't for the grace and mercy of god that's what i was telling next all right so the following day this is the following day we went to go and visit another church and uh crossing the river and there's about two hours away and so this is us crossing this river to agua blanca all right next all right and then some of the brothers were following us in that same little white truck and i mean they did so much to that truck on that trek uh he was having problems with his radiator uh i think that's the radiator right and uh so they they were carrying water you know to fill it up with water but eventually uh there was damage there that that had to be fixed a different way next and this is the church this is this is actually the church the the church that brother eric you uh was pastoring before that uh i believe we helped here in this church build this church here and they're still gathering there they still they they they need a pastor but brother eric uh was led to go to where he's pastoring now because that group really needed we needed his help so they have somebody in charge right now of the church but uh they they're praying for a pastor next uh and they're still adding buildings uh uh adding some things to the church there next this is uh inside next it was us holding service there that afternoon this was on this was on christmas eve by the way this was on the 24th they're thinking about going to church on christmas eve christmas day to them christmas isn't that big you know they don't really celebrate christmas you know so to them to them is just about going to church so so we had service christmas eve and christmas day next next sister sister maria came up for prayer after the after the service next this is us praying i i preached to them about uh the one thing that matters the most what is that one thing next all right now this is the fog the next day uh and we this is brother eric the church where brother eric is pastoring now where they voted him as pastor where the pastor of this church for for some reasons he left the church and so since brother eric lives only two blocks from this church he felt that that's where the where the lord was calling him to to to they needed they needed his help so he's pastoring there at this church now next all right this is the sister that we were praying for back in in agua blanca that was she's very special her name is sister maria so next and this is uh we took them some bags of food as well there and so this is a older sister they're receiving one of the bags of food next all right um i don't know if you can see right here i don't know if you recognize these people i don't know if they can zoom in or not anyways that's brother anderson and his family uh they sister anabra anderson they they they they wanted to give this gift box to the sister and the sisters like 94 years old and so she was looking at their picture of how they've grown next and so she really appreciated the gift sister anna i'm not sure but we gave her the funds next all right so uh that's uh this is christmas day uh well they're preaching preaching at uh at brother uh eric's church next [Applause] [Music] all right next okay so uh we left the service there there at the church very late and there was no no you know no restaurants open or nothing that we could get something quick to eat so we had there was only a gas station open and this is some of the things we had to eat there that that night a bunch of junk food next we were able to get some nachos from the gas station and uh back back at the brother eric's house they they fixed they had some leftover chicken because let me we're just so busy as you can see this is one day after another services services services service services and so even some of the sisters you know they didn't even have time to cook and things like that because everything was was concentrated on planning on what was going to happen in the church going here going here so but thank god for the nachos and pepsi next all right and this is you can turn it up brother and just give you an idea of what christmas day is like over there as soon as the clock strikes 12 on the 25th fireworks everywhere it's like christmas eve i'm sorry not uh new year's eve to them they it's it's about shooting fireworks to people you know and so that's it's just a loud you cannot sleep that night you you hardly get any sleep that night it almost looks like when uh to me it looks like that that scene when when we went to the gulf war when they were shooting the the rockets that's what it looked like to me it's like one of those scenes from the uh gulf war back in 1991 in iraq next they were shooting all right this is bella and zoe that that same night as the fireworks were going on bella was playing christmas music on her violin next this is outside [Music] yeah so you can see zoe's not always quite it's because she had eaten all that junk food too this is part of it you could get an idea of the streets at night there this is in talanga honduras next all right so this is here because where how much time we got all right give me about 10 more minutes and we'll be done not done with the with the trip but just done with this section um all right so from hondur from talanga honduras uh that following day after on the 26th december 26th we we rode down to right right down here which is choluteca and it's it's uh it's closer to the coast there it's very hot there very hot next this is us uh heading there it's about a five hour drive and i was just chilling in the back i didn't want to sit in the in the the brothers the brothers were like come on to the front you know i said no i want to stretch my legs out now you know so i'd sit in the in the back there with the girls next all right we got to our destination and it's up up in a it's up in the mountains there there's some mountains that go through there this is a brother josuekidos uh brother carlos quiroz's house he's a pastor there this is bella she's playing with this brother he's a brother alexis a brother talented talented brother with the piano next [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and uh you know that bella did a good job just really playing and blending in with the people there with as far as with the instruments and everything she got to learn their music really well next [Music] all right and they had a little parrot there as well uh this one this one was was was uh you tell it hola and he would say hola you know and other things what else he would say costa rica though is the parrot was there two years ago when we were there and it's still there hanging in the same tree next all right so this is brother carlos quidosa's church that sunday we traveled that saturday that sunday we we preached there and this is a brand new building that they just built next brother carlos quiroz he has a son who lives in florida he lives in jacksonville florida and so with the help of that of his son he they helped build this this building um brother carlos quiroz he's a precious brother uh wonderful brother next this is this is her song service that one [Music] brother eric was leading songs because he was they asked him if he could lead songs that next all right this is [Music] [Music] all right and then i preached there that morning and then that afternoon around three o'clock p.m uh we drove about another f about another hour hour 20 minutes or so to another church we were supposed to have service around five o'clock p.m that afternoon and this is uh this is this area is called el triumvo it's just the name of the area and that's the church you could see it from far off it just we thought that was just a pretty picture of the church surrounded there next this is the pastor there and uh he's an older brother now and he's not meant preaching anymore because he's blind i forgot what it was but he's blind now and he can't really minister he's up in age now and uh so some other brothers are are taking the reigns right now for for now as but he's still considered the pastor so you see a lot there some older brothers you know they're they're they're they just can't do it anymore so but this is a brother is wonderful though next and this is the church that afternoon service next [Music] [Applause] you have to take that word and say that word is mine it's for me it's personal it's personal to me [Music] i know that i make mistakes but i know that he said in his word if i confess my sin he's faithful and just to forgive me for my sin to cleanse me from all unrighteousness you have a door a door is open for you there's no no need for you to stay there and you're wallowing in your sin pretty much what i was telling them uh you know i was just praying and just the lord really helped me because i mean i was struggling with my with my health you know as far as i was getting colds and things like that constantly and i had preached that morning and and and i was just asking lord help me because i'm here to do a job and uh god help me amen next and that's that's that's the next day after that long that was my wife took that picture of us next all right this is in another area there in choluteca uh bella playing with some of the kids there [Music] this is uh now sort of this is another video i'm not sure what happened there this is some of the little girls there next and then we were there drinking some coconut water and if you've never had fresh coconut water in my it's good it's good next all right uh this brother right here and i really uh i'm so terrible with names i remember faces all day long but the brother uh he's an evangelist and he's been evangelizing for many years but i believe he told me that he's baptized over 300 something people during his lifetime and so i just thought that was amazing you know you know just just him where and he's still evangelizing he still goes around preaching the word of god through honduras still baptizing people adding to that number yes he fell off a motorcycle just had to recently before that and uh it was a terrible accident the one that he was riding in the back and the one that was was uh driving the motorcycle he he got hurt but uh he hit his head luckily he had a helmet but still it was still kind of bothering him so you remember that brother in prayer it's nothing but the devil trying to hinder and they were going to actually go and go to to preach the gospel when the accident happened so next all right okay we're going gonna stop right there and uh and i'll just what i'll do saints is wednesday i can continue and we'll just do what we can and then i'll just i'll just fast fast speed through through everything else and just get to the cut to the chase i guess you could say to nicaragua we'll go to nicaragua and costa rica in about you know maybe 10 minutes because this is all still in honduras see because we were there the longest so all right we'll stop it right there because we have communion so [Applause] hey man brother wade you want to come thank you all for your patience thank you for your uh uh for uh for your patience yeah for your patience appreciate you all just like that okay you got it okay i have to do it myself i know all right let's stand our feet let's uh let's sing i love him as they get ready for the communion it's

completely now i'm free amen thank god that we can have a brother a young brother that can go and and do these things amen to be able to his brother uh dan daisy always said and now brother joe green says if you can't go send somebody so that's what we do we send somebody and thank god for brother louise that he can uh i'm glad he came from columbia but i'm glad he didn't stay in columbia that ain't south carolina either they talk funny over there too but uh no offense but uh in the country of columbia he got over here and learned how to speak english you know how to speak english when you got over here did you you learned english here wow that's great but he does a good job god's anointed him to do a job amen god's anointed him do the job and i believe he's done a good job and we continue to support anybody that wants to go and and do any kind of mission work we sure appreciate it so let's read in the description first corinthians if you want to read along that's fine if you don't i'll read it here in chapter 11 verse 23 so for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament see that testator had to die there's a new testament coming in the old testament was under bulls and goats the new testament which there the testator had to die but he's writing a new testament in his blood that it was going to take blood to wash away our sins not to cover it take heed this is my body which is broken for you this dude remembers to me after the same matter he took the cup and when he stopped saying this cup is in new testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily amen the prophet of god said you need to be born again living the life of christ before you can take communion all right because if you do take it unworthy listen to what happens wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord now what do we say the body's what is the body it's not his body sitting up there on the throne it's this church body it's the body of christ that we're doing you know you do something wrong you're doing it against the body amen excuse me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself in other words stop we're going to stop here in just a few minutes examine yourself if you have an audience somebody the prophet of god said make it right amen but you can't just be clear because we're taking this in commemoration of somebody dying for us one man dying for our sins but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep it's pretty serious that ain't talking about falling asleep that's talking about dying amen many are sick many are weak and many die because you take this unworthily amen so we need to examine ourselves for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world thank god wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home did he come not together into condemnation and the rest will i set an order when i come let's just have a moment of silent prayer pray for you pastor pray for the sins that you've done this week and anything that's going on in your life just ask god to clear it out and you know what that's a good time good clear the slate get the slate clean and let's get started lord i ask you to bless and cleanse each one of us father thank you for our brother louise lord i pray that you give him a special blessing lord for the things he did for you i pray as we take this communion lord that it will rejuvenate us lord and strengthen us for the time not so much as human strength but spiritual strength lord that we can stand in the wilds of the devil that's coming against us in this end time and all that's going on in the world lord me you told us that you would be a shelter now you'd be a pavilion that we could run into lord well today we're running into that pavilion lord we're taking the body and blood and we're as a symbol we're receiving this lord that'll make us better people that'll make us better christians father in this world we ask these things in jesus name amen the bible said he took bread and blessed it dear lord jesus thank you for this bread and i pray lord that you would sanctify it lord that will nourish our bodies and they'll remember that it was you father that hung on calvary lord to release your life lord as you come back into us lord as believers father forgive us of our sins and bless us in jesus name amen you know as many many times every time like this happens and even when brotherdale would do it i could remember back when we were um in the baptist church where they would just take some old wafer that somebody bought and probably at that time it wasn't made in china no offense but it probably was not made with holy hands this needs to be made with holy hands this is not something we do that we buy grape juice and buy a piece of bread no sister lisa makes the bread made by holy hands brother dale makes the wine also made by holy hands so i believe we're doing you know if you'll do the right thing it'll come back to you the wrong thing too but if we do the thing right and do it right and get started right i've never had to ask forgiveness for something i did right right man just think about that yep you just asked forgiveness the things you did wrong but if we start doing things right maybe this adoption thing will not be so hard what we need to do further the gospel make each one of us and as we take this bread we'll remember remember that night when he was in that upper room he knew he was going to die that next day so let's start today by dying out to him die out to the lord let the lord do the work for us but like louise was preaching we got to meet him he's got to come here you got to make an effort but he'll come to your effort dear heavenly father thank you for this wine lord i just been made by grapes lord and made by holy hands and it's been run through a process lord with it'll ferment father and it comes to a place that it'll it'll not even it'll not even sour for years and years to come if it's held in the right place father we know that's a symbol of your word father that your word will never return void it will accomplish exactly what it said it would it'll never become old and moldy and stale father but lord i pray that we put today this new wine into new glasses into new bottles and lord that will show the world that we are the bride of jesus christ thank you for this time that we have lord and this opportunity that we can do this lord sanctify your people in this journey in jesus name amen come morning i'll walk by the river [Music] i'll rest need thee ever green tree i'll carry my cross through the midnight [Music] good morning glory for me sometimes i'm despised and rejected and i question oh father how long then i take one more look at mount calvary keep your eyes on him and it gives me the strength to go on [Music] come morning i'll wall by the river i'll rest need when this is all over we'll get to rest and take communion and commune with each other for an eternity this is just a little bit folks just a little bit of what we're going to have for an eternity i know we're creatures of time but we are eternal people we have an eternal purpose amen i don't want us to see that everything we do everything we do is taking communion foot washing when we have a time of prayer a time of fellowship when we have bible study revere that time take that time because i know there's different things we do during the during the week that takes up our time of other things but let's just take that little time and even like now could you imagine being in an upper room and and those 12 didn't know what was going to happen they really didn't understand but buddy i promise you on the day of pentecost they understood what was what was going on what jesus had told them and talked to him for three and a half years it all came to that moment to where peter says this is that that the prophet spoke of that i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh and you'll understand what's going on yo we'll understand we'll understand it better by and by by and by when the morning comes all the saints of god together at home we gonna tell the story of how we overcome and we'll understand it better by and by we're just getting enough just enough to get us started and then we're going to get out of here and then we'll have a eternity you know right now we're time brother john tomorrow we got to go to work tomorrow we got to do this tomorrow we got to do that it won't be a tomorrow then it won't be tomorrow it'll be unending joy but this is just a part of it he said do this until i come let's take communion hmm thank you lord father take it up though cups let's read if you want to follow me john 13 well jesus watches the disciples feet i want you to listen this real close and supper being ended the devil having been put in the heart of judas's carrot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand that he was come from god and he went to god he rises from supper and laid aside his garment and took a towel and girded himself after that he poureth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and wiped them with the towel for with he was girded then cometh he to simon peter and peter said lord thust thou wash my feet jesus answered and said what i do they'll know us not now in other words you don't have the new birth you're not going to understand what i'm doing but you're going to understand in just a few days after this what's going on but thou shalt know hereafter peter said unto him thou shalt never wash my feet listen to what jesus said he didn't say well that's okay peter you can get by with it he said peter if i wash thee not thou has no part with me boy that struck peter right in the heart because jesus didn't beat around the bush he said you're going to do this or you're not going to be of me so simon peter said lord not only my feet but my hands and my head he was just washed me all over jesus said now he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every wit and you're clean but not all we know that judas was still there for he knew who should betray him therefore he said ye are not all clean so after they had washed their feet and washed it taken the garment was set down again he said unto them know you what i have done to you that's a question mark know you what i've done to you you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master in other words if god can wash your feet you ought to be able to wash each other's feet that's what he's saying you call me mastering lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for i have given you an example that you should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are you if you do them let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day we appreciate the time that we have with brother luis lord bringing the part of the mission trip lord
