TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and your new year will be wonderful I told you last Sunday we were going to look over the 6 volt purpose because in dec six whole purpose if all of Daniel seventy weeks just like the book of redemption for us after pride like that hit the book of Revelation which to the variety shows from the redemption of all 17 changes I showed rapture chose to I mean a resurrection the rafters jobs us going to them going to millennium shows God and preventing this out to the Jews shows all that in that in that book of Revelation looks to me a book of Daniel is the same as the book of Revelation but the book of daniel is a book of revelation to the Jew all right but the revelations is to us to church and to the huge right goes remember the property God said brother branham brother around saying that the Bible says and he said that the bride goes up in Revelation for one and doesn't come back to Revelation 19 so anything in between there it's got to do with the Jews that's the part we're talking 770 weeks down but the 70 weeks a day you'll remember begins there 445 BC a time limit they bring out them did you have a time limit download book right to the day 1260 days they're getting preached to 1260 days all right so now let's turn the Daniel 9 24 and read this and I hope you understood the other day I want you to see the calendar make sure you understood calendar wise we got a calendar the other day that had to do discuss the Jewish holidays on it there at the house so many of them put that in there but you just don't read it you know you look at you see Yom Kippur you'll see though of one someone and someone have your Julian days so where where right now we're feasting under the feast of Pentecost 50 days that lad that number for feast right over there the feast of Pentecost which was 50 days after the resurrection okay all right when the day of Pentecost was fully come God came back as a promise and a form of the Holy Ghost into the people on the day of Pentecost it was the Jewish day of Pentecost so these things all happen on feast days they know you know Jesus was was in the temple in talking about being on a feast day Jesus being a temple on feast day why he was word he was though speed remember he said there were my face not your they're not Israel speech their gods people that one's got standing in their television and now those feast days had come from paper to a human flesh right so let's read our Daniel 70 weeks scripture Daniel 9 24 because what we're going to do is we're going to continue on man we go on and it will refer back to this when we get to that 70th week alright so okay tight back I'll roll it up alright long stay right there we don't need it later on alright so here we know what we're doing is we're showing where the 70 weeks begins we're going to show the time periods and then by God's grace will see when it ends ok we have someone you today he's your brother and you said that under your breath like using them ? yeah they'd smile now I know you like I know you know the girl I her I'm good to have you with us what's your name cuidate anyway it's just remember growing little tea yeah Wow okey-dokey then so maybe George are saying I read or talk don't want to come out you know but good to have you with us today so Daniel nine seventy weeks are determined upon by people who Jews and upon the holy city Jerusalem to do six things to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness and steal at the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy their six things we're going to continue know therefore and understand their from the going forth of the commandment to restore and rebuild and to build Jerusalem until Masada French there'll be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks seven weeks starting to get the temple down here seven weeks and watch three score three times two is six sixty two weeks so you got a seven-week period and a sixty two week period that the walls are going to be building in even in trouble this time all right and then after the three score after 62 weeks Messiah be cut off so we've come from 445 bc when they build the streets in the walls right got streets in the walls built come over come over come over there's no profits from Malachi's and Jesus is several hundred years in there right right so you come over here and you got Jesus coming on the scene at 4 BC and Dives 8030 mixing 33 years old and that's our mark according to the prophets message then according to the Bible I see the test that's what it is now what is 7-time remember one week equal flights seven years seven times seven is 149 all right now then you take 60 2 times 7 is 434 49 plus 434 is 483 years all right so that's your first two periods seven-week period in a sixty two week period makes 483 years when I last nine the full part or even it doesn't finish dangle 70 weeks right because what seven times seven is 490 so four hundred ninety minus 483 is what davin one week one week left after the massage cut off I don't know I don't see where they don't understand that to look what the Bible says all right but what is it going to do is going to finish the redemption of Israel during those 70 weeks right kasee verse 26 and after three score 2 weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself who would be cut off for us and israel and the people of the prince that shall come now that's a little tea and who was at Titus Titus destroyed Jerusalem in AD 70 Jesus told him when he was preaching the seals tune in there Matthew 24 he said don't be caught the city get out and there was no Christian caught inside that city they were all gone the women they remember they had a lot of reason they had to eat their babies and all that stuff goes Titus circled it he just stepped down and let them let him just absolutely destroy themselves all right because they turned them aside them okay now when we're done destroy the city in the sanctuary remember we talked about Titus he took all the menorah and he took all those things back to Rome the Catholic Church is sitting on all those things to build the temple with all right so he destroyed the city and the sanctuary and the end or else you'll be with the flood and then the end more desolations are returning they said the blood actually ran out of the when he opened the gates and when he Jerusalem they slaughtered and killed him on the blood just run out of the gates there was so much blood where they had killed all the people horrible when you turn word down and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week because see we got one week left we got a seven year period left one week equals seven years so we got 17 year period left and that he is the H a little age and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week so who's the heat the Pope the Antichrist after we're gone in between in between here and here God takes out a bride under the feast of Pentecost with just 7776 49-7 church ages okay then we go up in our Jubilee here I work not not anything to encounter our to believe years when we go up alright we go in a rapture and then God it turns to the Jews with that last week or seven years and he who the Antichrist younger from the co you say well that could be Christ he breaks it right here and in the next week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease God don't do something and then take it back he doesn't make a covenant and he breaks it well this man is gonna break it so they can't be another Bible but the devil okay and he shall confirm the covenant for one week so you got 69 weeks here so there's get one weight left after the rapture of the church because there's no guards not dealing with the juice now as a nation right he's dealing with the Gentile once the Gentiles go up guard go straight over start dealing in that last week for the Jews and then the midst of the week what's the midst of the week three and a half plus three and a half the seven right and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even unto the count until the consummation and that determine shall be poured out upon the desolate and there's your 70 weeks a day so let's go back to here though because this is what it's for seventy weeks are determined upon the Jews and Jerusalem to do six things because what happened right here at the cross they cried let his blood be on us and our children so God quit dealing with oh sure he dealt with them as Christians he didn't deal with him as you he dealt with him as Jewish Christian because look the 120 of the uppermost old youth so he wasn't just said but as a nation as a nation he could deal over the Jews because he told him he was going to that's it you're done you turn me down I'm not dealing in the morn because this price is going to come and he's going to destroy see that thing's never been rebuilt since 80 70 there's no temple over there wife's been scattered and destroying Rome has most of the parts to put it back together why you think that Covenant still be signed Rome is going to say here you can have your things if you'll give us a little s wrong don't ever give you something then and don't expect something in return you know so so seventy weeks are determined upon now people and the holy city to do these six things now what's the first now Israel transgressed and turn Jesus down at Calvary right but he died for them at count all right give me but these six things are going to bring not only the people but the city remember it's too is a two-part see we have no continuing City we're looking for a city whose builder and maker is God not one we built right but now they the Jews need a temple the total God set him if you get in trouble and you look toward a temple I'll save you remember that's what Jonah did in the bell well he turned he knew where that city was that some way somehow he knew and prayed and God delivered all right so to them even though they may be born again believers Christians that temple still got to be built according to Ezekiel 43 44 all right so that temples got to be built so seventy weeks are determined until it so whatever is going to happen this right here has got to happen within that 70 week period or that 490 year period because seventy times seven is for their name right remember in the Bible Jesus they told you said said do we forgive our brother seven times he said no he said seventy times seven he knew how long it is going to take he was telling Israel it's going to take you four hundred and ninety years to be restored back for me to forgive you he forgive important foundation the world I think I they got to realize it right our names are written allowed to apply for the foundations in the world but we got to come down here and realize all right and then received part up my brother tells preaching them but number one is to finish the transgression so let's go on our 1970 week's book to the sixth whole purpose was just end if you got your if you got your three books in one go to the six fo purpose of Gabriel visit that's the second that's the second book all right come see I'm gonna say paragraph 34 if you're in another book you all know what marine you gotta get in Gabriel constructions today on if you have a book like this is on page 51 but it's paragraph 34 I want to read that just for a second it's 44 someone makes 44 in that one all right 44 in the new book all right and then it plays 51 in the old book this book all right let Dawson's god I got this Johnny guy tale all right we're going to read it and then get started on the six volt purpose because I believe it's important because remember and here's a key because watch what we're going to read this is where people miss it in the message there's only seven years of redemption for Israel to be retained it's going to take four hundred nine years to get it accomplished Jesus preached three and a half years over that back there was no redemption here people in this whole 483 years God wasn't sure he was being with it but remember they didn't have a profit from right here all the way to here for 400 years the people just did what they wanted a right so God was not redeeming Israel at the beginning of the 70 weeks but yet he began the wheels turning he acted for what God is only going to deal with everywhere in their city are in their homeland right so we have together on back here but when this event when did the transgression get finished it's only going to be finished in that last week it's but it was finished account right here you got to understand so was yours Jesus died 2,000 years ago but I got saved in 1998 that's when I realized it okay 1998 year later right the same way with my brother and said Jesus died here for Israel baby wasn't applied why they rejected him they said let his blood be on us on our children that was the great transgression in sin and iniquity that created them Jesus actually did come to the Jews out of that Old Testament Jesus came right to the Jews he said I'm only going to the Jew well now he was doing two things he was saving both groups but he has to save Israel as a nation and Gentiles as a people okay he knew Israel wasn't sure they'd accept him as a nation only as individuals at that time remember he's when it wrote that script that's right Jesus in the form of the Holy Ghost wrote that script or through Daniel okay so he wasn't he wasn't surprised when he would read the Old Testament okay no he would read it and he said this day the scripture fulfilled right he knew what part he was to play in the Bible sure he didn't know about his coming why why do you know why was coming it is anything about any old testament to that degree it expels more into the New Testament right first Thessalonians second Thessalonians all in them Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout boys from RJ RJ arc angel but most of your old testament was what God trying to deal with Israel our always speaks about Gentiles coming in every once in a while but not like Israel then that Israel is the one he was looking for to begin with and then they what they transgressed okay there by all right with that we're to a point right here too we're gonna started dealing with him by bringing them back sure but he didn't finish your transmission in this part here nobody got that he finished it at Calvary but it wasn't applied so there's got to be that one week left to apply this six full purpose so I say the six full purpose will show you what's going to happen in that last week according to the Bible what about alright so now let's read one's probably said paragraph 34 in the stage for purpose says and we do understand that the city everybody got that that where everybody is okay everybody got you got okay all right okay and we do understand that that city which is now being occurs for two thousand years will be rebuilt and re-established again and the temple worship will be set up just like it was in the beginning that's right Jerusalem would be there'll be a sacrifice daily oblation offered again just like it was in the beginning okay nice talking about the Jews not 144,000 thereby understand that for 144,000 that's why they get mad and killed 144,000 feel they say we don't need that anymore all right now all right look let's read well let's keep reading 35 now I want you to know friend that striking on these things I'm certainly leaving out weeks of teaching but just kind of hitting that so that when the weather cools off a little later we'll get into the seals to buy all the trumpets all these things that I can refer back and say do you remember on the damaged every two weeks and he does that in sealed he said do you remember damage them to wait this is why we had to do talk about 9-10 the week he never said in the seals this is why I was wrong and am saying the weeks and I got correcting them all right do you remember the church age when it went up in that taken place and these seventy weeks of Daniel covers from the going up of the church who's that us until the coming back to the church well now we don't go up over here we don't go up over here we go all the way over here so he's taking the whole seventy weeks of Daniel and putting in that six more purpose in that last week everybody got that then you're going to understand that better when we get to that that's my brother ground come about Jesus is preached the first half a nice preaching the second half well he's not preaching the first half of any of this right here the word problem out it's inside of that he's showing us that reduction is only going to take seven years one week alright one week equal seven years go by and these seventy weeks of Daniel covers from the going up of the church until the coming back of the church hmm that space is what it covers now i'm now not all seventy weeks of Daniel part up he called itself and show that there is a part of the building up but really there's no redemption right here this is just getting the people ready just like in the seven church ages there's no rapture until the last church age but God's dealing with the people getting them ready to the last age we have such a fun day the weekend that we can live by so will the dude what these use that receive the Holy Ghost in that last week they're going to look back and think of what they're going to see all that where did you get those scars the Old Testament dip them too I mean the two prophets are going to be profit but they're going to go back in the Old Testament just like Jesus did on the road to mass he went back the Bible says went back and told them all about him through Moses and although they didn't understand he said old food and slow of heart what they have achieved whole don't yet they understand what he's known about its the message in Christ that's indeed impacted right three and a half back seat when he spoke correct Calgary that's right because she there was no message of redemption here this was the law this was one put you in jail there was no salvation in the law right nobody noticed the MacGuffin humor sure they were saved absolutely but they didn't have the new birth or they went acted like the deal all right but you still got see that the 70 weeks is getting them ready to come to calorie and and literally they turned all that down the counter so God said I'm not going to deal with you I'm going to deal with take a Gentile bride out but I'm coming back to deal with you to finish what I promise he promised seventy weeks are determined that's a promise of God that he's gone upon his people in the city to restore them back the man not too bright but to restore them back give them the Holy Ghost and put them in a rapture their rapture okay all right so not all of it part of it seventy weeks are determined now there's a six-fold purpose in this business visit telling him what was going to come to pass now there's a there was a safe full purpose of his coming right just like Jesus preach six seals when he was here brother Adam just opened them up because man had shut the book God opened the book through Jesus Jesus was the open book right Jesus was the open book he was trying to open it and tell everybody but they just kept happening night same way through the church ages he kept up revealing itself to certain people certain people would shut it up right now there's a fictional purpose of his coming now tonight I think we'll leave all scriptures are where he lets go him down seventy weeks are determined let's read the scripture he's reading the scripture here seventy weeks are determined upon by people now remember that is all that the journey of Israelites will have on this earth they are determined seventy weeks forgot that nine seventy weeks seven two weeks is just determined that's all that's allotted to the juice upon thy people and upon the holy city therefore now this is program problem therefore this seventy weeks now don't miss it it will reveal from that time to the end of the Jews and also to the end of Jerusalem until there will be a new city Bill Lee brings in the people and the city okay now hope we get into real good and deep tonight come on now this is uncle our determined upon down people and upon the holy city one to spread brown says what too so watch it to do to finish the transgression when he tell him what did he tell him now he was trying to find out how long it's going to be program from time at the end town Daniel was confessing to his people let's go over to paragraph 14 one let's explain few least when we go up now that was the sexual purpose of the visitation of Gabriel now let's start number one if you want to market you just got pencils number one to finish the transgression that's the first thing everybody got that here in this class yes now to finish the transgression of Israel who transgressed against God will be the turning away of the ungodliness Jacob now to find out let's turn to Romans 11 chapter and begin with the 21st verse of Romans 11 now we're going to watch finish the transgression and if God spared not the natural branches Romans 11 21 which was who Israel take heed lest also he spare not thee now I want you when you go home to read this whole dilemma chapter I'm just reading this so marked down the hole 11 chapter and read it brother I'm talking spare doubt they behold therefore the goodness severity of God on them once fell but toward the goodness if now continue in the goodness and otherwise now so because i'll also be cut off and they also if they abide not still and if they abide not stealing unbelievers you'll be grafted in regarding able to grab them in again see telling that there will be a time when the Gentiles would be cut out and here's will come back again because remember look this is me talking now the scripture says that there would be an in grafting of the Gentiles it would be a wild branch grafted into this what he's saying now he's showing the type that Gentile branch is going to be taking off and take it up and he's going back in with Israel again because remember he's not dealing with Israel now that's a nation okay here the time that when the Gentile will be cut out and Israel come back in again for if that if they were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature coming gentlemen of parentheses Gentiles princey and we're grafted contrary to nature brother Brandon this is his quote we were contrary to nature alien without mercy without guard no hope at all God by His mercy to give us a chance cut off righteousness row because the transmission then turns them aside the wild the tail olive tree and brought in a lot all the three contrary to nature know who you talked about us brought us in now let's talk about how you back out again and put an Israel back right now all right let's read on let's go down their reasons for I would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceit now this is Paul right this is Polly book Roman the blindness in part happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles come in that's my in your opportunity there all right until the paragraph 43 until God is finished with the Gentile Israel was blinded they went off into sin and transgression against God and because God blinded their eyes that we might be grafted in you get it 26 personnel and so all Israel shall be saved paragraph 44 God blinded them purposely for you and I they cannot see because blackguard blind to them and all israel true Israel shall be saved now do I understand that that's 144,000 not all of Israel okay true Israel okay what did the angle say glory to finish the transgression of Israel I've come to tell you that they will come a time when Israel transgression will be finished right now when is that going to be now remember he pulled them all over he pulled wall he pulled he put his hand over his real that's right yes blinded them yes I mean he came just by the scripture people he came just by the Word of God that they read every day in that temple and God purposely blinded their eyes so that you and I could come in that's right if you have a problem with that you can talk to God about though that's what the Bible said was promised mrs. C right right all right let's go to paragraph 49 save a little time here the only gonna get one done probably today I'm sweating like a horse up here God cut them off purposely and blinded their eyes so we could have a chance to see giving us an opportunity because we're blissing what's going to happen in this six full purpose is exactly what's happening to me and you what when he saved your soul he finished your transgression he made an end of your sins he made reconciliation for your Nikko's remember your sins is what blame on cross right so he's not just be speaking to natural people right here but he's also speaking to me and that's what my Redemption because remember he can't redeem Israel different than you redeemed us only only he takes them as a nation and us as an individual all right but we don't know how many god only knows how many Gentiles are going to be but you know one thing for sure once we leave this earth there's only one hundred and forty-four thousand twelve thousand from each tribe gonna be saved now that's just the way it is all right that's what God promised he would do okay because that's the nation the nation of Israel actually can be broken down to twelve tribes that's right right Israel is not nine tribes a try the Israelis 12 pride he told a friend right here at the arc thrift on this side of the art 30 on this eye dr 3m on this side of the art then you've got four heads of that of that group and that's what God wanted God wants order all right now better I 50 now remember he's not speaking of the Gentiles but truly i want you to see what do you do at your salvation he forgave your transgression made an end of your scent remember Christians don't have sins in their soul he made an end and Sam means there's no more alright sure but we have we sinned every day alright this got sins every day the reason I'm here and dying is a sin cuz the curse right all right anime Tran silly Asian for iniquity we knew better but we did it anyway that's what an equity is any what he makes reconciliation he reconciled us back passed out iniquity and brings us back to where Garden of Eden condition all right gents is 126 man you show all what well I hope we're living in everlasting righteousness my soul is that's right right look what I'm saying is the last three is in effect of the first three all right the first three is your Redemption the last three is the effect of God doing the redeeming everybody got that this is the this is this is the cause this is the effect okay the cause was he gave he just he restored us back complete Holden's right bring everlasting righteousness we're sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus honey still up to vision and prophecy guys think about the other night brother BAM open the seals but but he all but he also talks about sealing up the car and the Bible says you're sealed until the day of your redemption sure the seal is opened up but once they go inside of you the clothes you're a mystery so he God seals up the vision and prophecy in you that's what we're doing now alright and anoint the most holy it's when brother Brown says that Jesus Christ and the bride comes into the temple to a North to temple well this temple is not annoying to get this temple is not alone here but once got fully takes over then to me see that's what I mean this is our Raptor this is our body change right here all right now to the Jews it will be a physical happening of us coming back into a temple that they built because of what the Bible says but us is Christian it's when our bodies shame that's when we're truly going to be annoying when order they are sold st. anoints arrest us Oh psychonauts arrest I was not ever lasting right she's my sexy christmas is another well i was thinking yesterday I thought well everybody says well you now let's put Christ banking Christmas or so much you know on the internet was talking about put Christ back in Christianity but if Christmases comes to it's a Christ mass they say communion with Christ we have Christmas every day every night if it's Christ mass which that's when it comes up with Christmas Catholic Church come up with Christ max then go have mass what is communion with done so we have a Christ Mass every day so it's Christmas every day falls so but the last one to us here's where we get our rid our Redemption the Gentile well that's what the Jews get their Redemption and God can't redeem I'm different than us he's got the same design what alright so let's let's continue just for a minute we'll get one done anywhere peugeot 51 no 50 now he's not speaking of the Gentiles I'm just rowing this in here so you can see where the Gentiles had their chance but he come to finish the transgression make a finish of it what is finish means in okay when you finish something you stop alright paragraph fifty-one neff we now if we go back into Daniel again we'll find out that in Daniel if I the 24th worse all right to finish the transgression to finish what to finish Israel's transgression what is they transgressed it is to go against something a transgress against me is to do it wrong to me transgress against you is to do it wrong to you so Israel did a wrong to God and in this 70th week what's going to happen God is going to finish the transgression of Israel finish the transmission will be turning away the ungodliness from Jacob and when all Israel will be born again all of them will receive the Holy Ghost all right right got that yes let's just stop right there will we can't get onto another one okay but what's going to happen brother ground will go all the way back and he'll show where Israel said let his blood be on us and our children now if he said distally their blood be on us it would have just been that generation and God would start dealing be said on our children so that's perpetual generations right but there comes a time when God deals with the Jews when we're gone when the Gentiles are gone there's no other Gentile will be safe God is turning right straight and he's going to finish that last week yes to the Jews all hell's gonna break loose everywhere else but he's going to protect and be with those will approve that show and we'll show you in those feast days where god comes in and does the exact same thing he does the spiritually he does to them naturally ants fiercely fought on the earth so let's go you can can this week read the stage full purpose over again so that you'll kind of get a discrete right there where we started through number six you know don't read too preliminary read those 60
