[0:35] got a few things to cover and then what
[0:37] we'll do is we let what you hear from
[0:39] Bara Barbara's in she's Inver D no he's

[0:52] brother going to
[0:54] Dan right sister bar yeah sister bar all
[0:59] right so let's read the um let's
[1:03] background a little bit on the first
[1:04] seal and then we're going to read in
[1:08] second seal and kind of start into it a
[1:09] little
[1:11] bit and what I want you to see is U we
[1:15] were discussing last
[1:17] night um and some brought up the point
[1:22] of of what we you know what do we need
[1:25] to do
[1:26] to you know get this thing going or you
[1:29] know make this thing
[1:31] more
[1:33] um other words get it going get it going
[1:37] so if
[1:39] uh's pH he's turning it
[1:44] off but that's good thank you brother
[1:47] mine rang upstairs in church
[1:52] and I was thinking this morning you know
[1:55] I I don't want to get have the wrong
[1:58] impression of people that don't need to
[2:00] study or read or do anything anymore but
[2:03] with all the things that we have going
[2:04] on I mean honestly look if you work a
[2:06] 40-hour work week or 48 some of them
[2:09] work 50 Rebecca maybe 60 hour work
[2:11] week there's got to be time set aside
[2:14] for God sure but now once you do that
[2:17] though and you get home and you sisters
[2:19] have to take care of the kids and wash
[2:21] and cook and clean and we Brothers have
[2:24] to cut the grass and do this and do that
[2:27] keep the car going you see what I'm
[2:28] talking about that's just everyday
[2:30] things I was thinking this morning and
[2:32] here's a real good example show me one
[2:35] place in the Bible that Abraham
[2:38] asks God to let him be the one that
[2:43] would produce the promised
[2:47] child find one place in the Bible
[2:50] there's no place that Abraham started
[2:52] crying out to God God I want to have the
[2:54] promised child Abraham or Abram didn't
[2:57] have a
[2:58] clue but God knew the end of Abraham
[3:02] Abram going to Abraham's journey and
[3:05] listen Abraham is a type of a True
[3:08] Believer right we must have faith but
[3:10] now watch him in his normal everyday
[3:13] life he was trying to produce what God
[3:16] Said and he messed up he was trying you
[3:19] hear what I said trying to
[3:21] produce promis child here's Hagar I can
[3:24] perform Sarah's de she had children
[3:26] since she was you know we've never had
[3:28] children before let's try this let's try
[3:30] that I'm going to give her away you see
[3:32] all the human things that he did but God
[3:34] wasn't looking at that and when a when
[3:37] uh the Bible doesn't say that when God
[3:40] in the former mezc came down to Abraham
[3:42] and said
[3:43] Abraham now you're going to have this
[3:45] child through Sarah so he knew that he
[3:47] got a revelation through his journey but
[3:49] still Abram Abraham never said God I
[3:53] want the child I want to be able to
[3:54] produce a child it was God knowing that
[3:58] Abram would turn into Abraham that would
[4:00] produce the child all the way through
[4:03] the Journey so that's our that's our
[4:06] example to go by I was telling the folks
[4:09] last night that uh
[4:13] um to live a good normal Christian life
[4:16] is what Jesus did but he lived such a
[4:20] life that the Pharisees and the
[4:22] Sadducees the religious World thought he
[4:25] was a
[4:27] devil he wasn't in he was in in the
[4:29] temple sure but he wasn't in the temple
[4:32] like they were in the temple in other
[4:33] words they didn't see him go do the
[4:35] things that they did so they considered
[4:36] him Bel above but he was almighty God
[4:39] right he didn't have to get up in the
[4:40] morning and say I'm God I got to act
[4:41] like God no he got up in the morning you
[4:43] know what he done he was hungry so he
[4:44] eat
[4:45] breakfast I'm sure he helped his daddy
[4:47] in the carpenter shop for a while till
[4:49] he started his ministry but we got to
[4:51] understand that we cannot Abraham or
[4:54] Abram was no superhuman somebody it was
[4:57] just that God saw that Journey
[5:00] come to an end a fulfillment of that
[5:04] Journey was that Abraham had that child
[5:08] Abraham and Sarah all right so that's
[5:09] the same way with you and I same way
[5:11] with these seals I think sometimes like
[5:13] brother Dale's been preaching you know
[5:14] you say adoption and everybody goes way
[5:16] up to manifest the sons of God well we
[5:18] got to get
[5:19] there we got to get to manifest the sons
[5:22] of God and I believe some were at
[5:23] manifested sons of God
[5:25] but do we have to say that is the
[5:28] criteria
[5:30] for us to be adopted children of God no
[5:33] we're adopted in a family when we're
[5:34] born again right so the same way with
[5:37] these seals I think sometimes
[5:39] we especially as preachers and and Bob
[5:42] knows what I'm talking about Aon knows
[5:43] what I'm talking about you try to come
[5:45] to a a point in your sermon that you
[5:48] that you build
[5:49] up and then boom you you know you lay
[5:52] the hammer down you know or you are you
[5:55] you you try to end with a point that
[5:58] kind of fulfills all the
[6:00] sermon do you have to do that no you
[6:02] don't have to do that same way with the
[6:05] seals these seals were broke to the
[6:08] prophet of God in a room he went out and
[6:11] preached it to the people and then he
[6:12] told them on the Sixth Seal he said
[6:14] you're not even getting
[6:16] this it's not even for you that's right
[6:19] so what was he telling them now he
[6:21] wasn't telling them not to be Christians
[6:23] this has nothing to do with Christianity
[6:25] baby form Christianity okay there's
[6:29] going to be let's say billions there's
[6:31] going to be billions of Christians in
[6:33] heaven that never got the opening of The
[6:35] Seven
[6:36] seal there's only going to be a certain
[6:39] group of people that's going to get the
[6:40] true revelation of this and take a body
[6:43] chain very minute small like one in a
[6:45] million as brother Brown said or or two
[6:49] two out of what one in a million two out
[6:51] of two
[6:52] million um Israelites Joshua and Caleb
[6:55] ever understood what Moses were talking
[6:57] about the rest of them didn't have a
[6:59] clip
[7:01] but they were counted the generation
[7:02] that came up now they they went over in
[7:04] Promised Land right that's right they
[7:07] believe what Joshua and Caleb said so
[7:09] they come up through Joshua and Caleb's
[7:10] Ministry and went over into the promised
[7:12] land right so that's what you and I are
[7:13] doing we're coming up through the
[7:14] ministry of brother brandom but we have
[7:16] to go through like we were talking about
[7:18] last
[7:19] night is you know we can quote quotes
[7:23] like it like I said we haven't read many
[7:24] quotes in the seal book when brother
[7:26] Brown preached the seals he had a Bible
[7:29] and a tab
[7:32] and I was just reading here and I I
[7:34] didn't I'll flip through it I'll find it
[7:36] but brother Brown said you say you have
[7:38] those seven Thunders it must compare
[7:40] with every scripture in the Bible you
[7:42] can't say that brother Brown's message
[7:45] was an extension of the Bible or an
[7:48] addition to the Bible cuz if you add or
[7:51] take
[7:52] away your name will be taken from the
[7:54] book of life and the plagues will be
[7:56] added to you so be
[7:58] careful read feel careful when you start
[8:00] saying that brother bram's uh message
[8:03] should be in red letter I don't agree
[8:06] with that that that's not that's making
[8:08] him too much God
[8:11] okay now we can take the red letter what
[8:15] is red letter it's just something man
[8:18] did yeah it's just something man did the
[8:20] whole Bible should be R yeah God spoke
[8:23] it from the beginning to the end right
[8:25] but they but but when the scholars come
[8:27] down and said okay that's God in human
[8:29] flesh in human form let's punctuate it
[8:33] by putting it in red letter does
[8:34] everybody understand what I'm saying so
[8:36] they going to come a time people I'm
[8:38] going to tell you something there going
[8:38] to come a time where if you don't have
[8:40] it in
[8:41] here even up here you got to have it up
[8:43] here before you have it done here you
[8:44] got to have it up here cuz they're going
[8:47] to take the Bibles away and they're
[8:48] going to take the message away and what
[8:49] we were talking about last night even if
[8:51] you were to have the message on your
[8:53] phone or in on an iPad if you don't got
[8:56] no power right right God either going to
[8:59] have to supernaturally turn the power on
[9:01] which you
[9:02] can but you got to have it inside you
[9:05] got to pack that thing inside of you so
[9:07] much pack that word so much inside of
[9:09] you that what can God do he can Quicken
[9:13] right what you need when you need it
[9:16] that's right right right now why let me
[9:19] give you an example why didn't Jesus as
[9:20] soon as the storm came up why didn't he
[9:22] just stand up and say peace be still the
[9:25] Bible says that they all almost tore the
[9:27] boat apart before they woke him up right
[9:30] water was this deep in the boat why
[9:32] didn't Jesus just get up right at the
[9:33] beginning and say peace be still
[9:35] somebody had to cry out for somebody to
[9:37] help them it's the same way with you and
[9:39] I Jesus was in our boat but he's got to
[9:42] wait till you cry out for him and when
[9:43] you going to cry out for him when you
[9:45] can eat steak and potatoes all day and
[9:47] eat what you want to and drive what you
[9:49] want to and you know go to your home and
[9:51] turn on the heat and turn on the air
[9:55] no but you got to remember you got to
[9:57] have Christ there before he'll come in
[10:00] honor his word that's the same that's to
[10:02] me that's what the seals were when
[10:03] brother brandom got a revelation of
[10:05] these seals it was not an addition to
[10:07] the Bible that's right it was what was
[10:10] hidden in the Bible from the foundation
[10:12] of the
[10:15] world it was
[10:17] there it was always in in the in the
[10:20] writings but man had not been able to
[10:23] open it because man can't open it when
[10:26] man tries to open it guess what happens
[10:29] when Abraham Abram tried to help
[10:32] God he got a wild child he got an
[10:34] ishmail right but you still got to give
[10:37] him an a for effort he tried he tried to
[10:40] produce what God Said but it wasn't what
[10:43] the provided way that God has now we
[10:45] have a provided way the provided way is
[10:48] the message of the hour but face final
[10:50] resting place of prophet said is in the
[10:52] word of God so that's why we've been
[10:53] reading the scriptures reading even some
[10:55] scriptures that maybe brother Brown
[10:57] didn't read because look he didn't have
[10:58] time he preached the first seal in one
[11:00] night two and a half hours and the
[11:04] greatest opening of the Bible there ever
[11:06] was and he did it in two and a half
[11:07] hours well inside all that is the
[11:10] Revelation that we need to
[11:12] what get the Revelation break it down to
[11:14] the people and then you got to have a
[11:16] revelation you got to understand what
[11:18] the prophet said what we can do is is we
[11:21] can it's like the old saying you can
[11:22] lead the horse to water but you can't
[11:25] make him drink it that's right he's got
[11:27] to be thirsty enough to want drink it
[11:30] right so the first seal we went through
[11:31] it and we we've combed it over this is
[11:33] number 11 I
[11:35] think and I think we've covered about
[11:37] every
[11:38] Avenue I was thinking
[11:40] yesterday that's why I was telling them
[11:42] last night you know sometimes you just
[11:44] you just meditate the Bible says
[11:47] meditate I think David meditated David
[11:49] meditated on what God had done and
[11:51] thinking about the things of God and and
[11:53] and all that and I was just meditating
[11:55] on some things and I thought
[11:57] well brother favorite scripture was what
[12:00] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[12:01] and forever well I think we can
[12:04] punctuate at the end of each seal you
[12:06] got to see Jesus Christ the same
[12:09] yesterday today and forever you got to
[12:12] see and then what is that Jesus Christ
[12:14] it's in you the hope of glory amen right
[12:18] right I believe Christ came down not in
[12:21] a physical form but the word open you
[12:23] know sometimes we
[12:26] use we use those symbols and we have to
[12:28] because were humans and God knows that
[12:30] we're human but the mighty Angel come
[12:33] down now that didn't mean that Christ
[12:34] was way up Y and didn't come and he just
[12:36] came down in 1963 no he was with the
[12:39] prophet the whole time he was with um
[12:42] irenius and Martin and Columba and
[12:44] Luther and Wesley he was here the whole
[12:47] time but man had shut him out in
[12:50] denominations he had they had shut him
[12:52] out and he was outside trying to get
[12:55] back in right well the mighty Angel
[12:58] which is Christ came down
[13:02] here because you can't take a body
[13:06] change saying he's up there right it's
[13:10] like I saying last night we always pray
[13:11] we look up why do we look up God it's
[13:14] not up
[13:16] there and and we should respect by
[13:19] bowing our heads and closing our eyes
[13:20] but why do you have
[13:22] to you said oh
[13:24] you Jesus said at the tomb of Lazarus he
[13:27] said father I'm I'm going to say a
[13:28] prayer but it's not for me it's not for
[13:30] you and it's not for Lazarus it's for
[13:34] the people around me that I'm going to
[13:36] say this but other than that he would
[13:37] just walked up and said Lazarus come
[13:39] forth brother Brown said one time and I
[13:41] really like it said that Jesus was
[13:42] prayed up before the foundation of the
[13:43] world well see that's what you and I if
[13:46] you like last last night brother devil
[13:48] was talking about two
[13:50] Souls the two Soul Doctrine is that you
[13:53] get a soul God gives you a soul and
[13:55] Satan gives you a
[13:56] soul but I read some quotes from brother
[13:59] Brown said that Jesus was the only
[14:01] person that came to Earth knowing what
[14:02] he was right cuz he was back there our
[14:07] we were back there in that form but not
[14:09] this form we were back there in the form
[14:11] of Jesus Christ but our mind was
[14:13] blackened what our mind was blackened to
[14:16] that but now that the seals have come
[14:18] and been revealed now that the prophet's
[14:20] message has come I can look back and see
[14:23] that I was back there before the
[14:24] foundation of the world in the attribute
[14:27] of Jesus Christ called bride cuz he
[14:30] didn't just develop right attributes he
[14:34] always
[14:34] had but he wanted to display them so he
[14:38] added the way to display them is the
[14:39] perfect Plan of Redemption and salvation
[14:42] that we have
[14:43] today so we come to a place to where we
[14:46] look at these seals and we go man it's
[14:48] the greatest message has ever
[14:50] taught and it's true but we've got to
[14:53] get the like I was talking about last
[14:55] night we got to get the essence of this
[14:56] message this message is not do and don't
[14:59] hair and dress do this don't do that
[15:02] sure we had to start with that that's
[15:03] where you start with the foundation MH
[15:06] but Paul says leaving the principles of
[15:09] doctrine of Christ let us go on into
[15:10] Perfection right not leaving again in
[15:13] other words going back and all and it's
[15:16] okay to preach that there's a fine line
[15:17] there you can't say well we're not going
[15:19] to do this anymore no you you have to be
[15:21] led by the Lord to do the things you do
[15:23] because everybody's in different right
[15:25] different levels everybody's in
[15:27] different levels so you have to go back
[15:28] some time but why do we have to
[15:31] continue it's like brother Dale said we
[15:34] got to get them Born Again get them born
[15:36] again and they won't do the things that
[15:38] they that that they did back in the
[15:41] world same thing with this this was
[15:43] something like brother Brown said he
[15:44] said it's not something that God had to
[15:47] rewrite that's right this is what he
[15:49] wrote and this is the way it's been for
[15:51] in his
[15:52] mind it never was it never did have a
[15:56] beginning that's right right it always
[15:59] was Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[16:01] today and forever all right so that at
[16:04] the end of each seal so what first seal
[16:06] when open the lamb when the lamb opened
[16:08] one of the seals now watch the lamb had
[16:10] to open it man can't open it so the lamb
[16:13] had to open the seal right and I heard
[16:15] it was a noise of Thunder one of the
[16:16] four beasts stand come and see now what
[16:18] Beast was that the lion cuz we're going
[16:19] to go back and cover that when we get
[16:22] what we're going to do is we're going to
[16:23] cover the first four seals and then
[16:24] we're going to stop cuz brother BR said
[16:27] the Rapture takes place on the four
[16:28] seals
[16:29] right you said oh there's 5 six and
[16:31] seven we we'll explain it don't worry
[16:33] it's where you got to see that if you
[16:35] take a
[16:37] quote and live by one quote you'll die
[16:41] by one quote okay that's right Paul said
[16:43] to letter her kill it now he knew every
[16:45] law cuz he was the Pharisee of the
[16:47] Pharisees right actually he actually
[16:50] listen Paul this is what's so strange
[16:52] Paul could walk into the temple and be
[16:56] blameless and being um uh a born- again
[16:59] child of God but God Almighty they
[17:02] chastised him for walking into the into
[17:04] the temple and he always was telling him
[17:06] how F he wasn't you see what I'm saying
[17:09] M Paul had a basis of the law though
[17:11] behind him they knew who Paul was at the
[17:13] beginning so Paul could go in and do the
[17:15] things that he did and that was good
[17:18] because see Paul could reach the people
[17:19] that was in those in those
[17:21] congregations right cuz he had Jesus in
[17:24] his soul now I knew that one thing for
[17:25] sure Paul knows that more than anybody
[17:29] that's why I believe the first church
[17:30] age
[17:32] messenger was Paul being that he was
[17:35] that he had that Lon attitude l i o n
[17:37] lion like roaring of a lion because he
[17:40] knew that what he thought was life was
[17:43] death what he thought what he thought
[17:46] and lived by for probably 40 or 50 years
[17:50] he thought that was life and that was
[17:52] actually killing
[17:53] him until God come and said hey I'm
[17:56] Jesus who you persecuted and he said
[17:59] I didn't even know you lived on Earth
[18:00] you know in other words I heard about
[18:02] you but he knew then that that was
[18:05] Christ in you that's why Paul could
[18:07] say Christ in you the hope of glory he
[18:10] knew exactly where Christ was well see
[18:12] that's what you and I have to do well
[18:13] you say well brother is in me right then
[18:16] he's got to reveal the same thing that
[18:18] he revealed to the prophet he's got to
[18:20] reveal the same thing that he revealed
[18:22] while he was on the face of the Earth
[18:23] Christ himself because remember this is
[18:26] the son of man Ministry
[18:29] this is the son of man ministry right
[18:31] here these seals was the opening of God
[18:33] in human flesh back on the Earth again
[18:37] to you and
[18:39] I and I saw Behold a white horse and he
[18:42] that s on him had a bow I was thinking
[18:44] this morning too watch watch
[18:48] Satan right at the get-go now remember
[18:51] just like we went we haven't went
[18:53] through it yet but in Joel talks about
[18:55] the Palmer worm Locust caterpillar and
[18:57] cankerworm
[19:00] all right brother B said it's the same
[19:02] bug with different stages right this is
[19:04] the same thing CU I read a quote just
[19:06] this morning brother Brown said these
[19:09] four horse riders are the same as those
[19:13] four um bugs that eat the church down
[19:16] cuz what's the first thing he's doing
[19:18] he's got to get in
[19:20] church Satan had to ride into church he
[19:23] didn't ride out in the bar joint he rode
[19:26] right into church like what we're
[19:28] talking about the N Council he rode
[19:30] right into church and that's where he
[19:31] started his work right and he hasn't
[19:33] stopped he just keep eating and eating
[19:35] and eating and eating but like the
[19:38] prophet of God said he said four
[19:40] Messengers ate it down four Messengers
[19:42] have to bring it back all right we'll
[19:44] get into that when we get into that in
[19:47] after the fourth seal but we got to see
[19:48] what these seals are then we'll stop on
[19:50] number four then we'll back up and prove
[19:53] to you why that it has to be the Rapture
[19:55] happens on the four steel but that
[19:58] doesn't mean 5 6 and 7 is not open to
[20:01] you that means that 56 5 and six won't
[20:04] happen till after we're gone basically
[20:07] right knowing exactly where that come to
[20:09] through two prophets all right so when
[20:11] two prophets are on the earth we're not
[20:12] here so that's the reason that he could
[20:14] see that the Rapture would go and you
[20:17] say well that's justification
[20:19] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost that's
[20:21] only three brother Bram brings in
[20:23] invisible Union or somewhere in there he
[20:24] brings in one more called the word see
[20:27] you can have the Holy Ghost
[20:29] yes and not understand all the word
[20:31] that's right but you can't have the word
[20:33] and not understand the word that's right
[20:36] with with all these others if you come
[20:37] the right way those who is Justified
[20:39] we've already said the Bible say Paul
[20:41] says whoever whoever's been truly
[20:43] Justified will come to that
[20:45] glorification which is after the four
[20:48] cuz see when the Rapture takes place
[20:49] we're already in glorified bodies right
[20:52] so see you say well is that written
[20:56] somewhere brother R it don't have to be
[20:57] written down if if we go in rapture we
[21:00] are not going to be in these flesh
[21:03] bodies does it have to say that no it
[21:05] doesn't but that's what's hidden the
[21:08] revelation of that fourth seal is is
[21:11] that Redemption is
[21:13] done redemption's over for the Christian
[21:16] believer justification sanctification
[21:18] baptism HH and the word of God the word
[21:21] of God being fully revealed all right
[21:23] right and I saw and
[21:25] behold a white horse and he that s on
[21:28] him had a boat
[21:29] and a crown was given unto him now we
[21:31] went through all that talking about they
[21:33] were they started as a saying and then
[21:35] see at the end of this seal to open up
[21:38] the next seal they had to Crown somebody
[21:41] to give it a
[21:44] voice you understand what I'm saying to
[21:45] give it a voice they had to they had to
[21:47] Crown you can't Crown a spirit that's
[21:49] what brother Brown was talking about you
[21:50] can't Crown a spirit so he had to come
[21:53] into flesh
[21:56] listen why do you think that s waiting
[21:59] for me and you to take a body chain he
[22:02] doesn't know how that's right he doesn't
[22:05] know how but he's fixing to know how
[22:07] right cuz he's a copycat he copies after
[22:09] remember not original that's right so
[22:12] when he sees God incarnate himself in a
[22:15] group of people and they start living
[22:18] and speaking bodies come out of the
[22:20] ground and he can't stop
[22:24] it what a mighty God we serve What a
[22:27] Mighty God when he can't stop it he
[22:30] can't stop this from happening
[22:32] somebody's going to physically stand on
[22:34] this Earth one day and say Bride come
[22:37] out of the
[22:38] ground somebody's going to do that
[22:41] whether you believe it or not I believe
[22:43] somebody's going to stand there and say
[22:45] not Graves open up like the
[22:46] denominations you know the graves are
[22:48] going to open up and Jesus is going to
[22:49] come down through split the skies you
[22:52] you done way over somewhere else we
[22:55] talking about that last night this has
[22:56] got to be a secret going on
[22:59] when the bride comes back out of the
[23:00] Grave I don't believe everybody in the
[23:02] world is going to see him I do not
[23:05] believe that I believe only the elect
[23:07] that's right that's left alive that
[23:09] calls him out of the ground they're the
[23:11] only people that's going to see brother
[23:13] Tatum sister Tatum brother mo mo oh I
[23:15] believe we're the only people that can
[23:17] see them and if you can't see
[23:20] them what are you going to do you're
[23:22] going to say brother Aaron brother
[23:24] Aaron's going to come say man did you
[23:25] see brother Gary and brother you know
[23:29] Richard and all see all you see all them
[23:31] and I'm
[23:34] going if I'm here I know one thing's for
[23:37] sure yeah I ain't got Holy Ghost yeah
[23:41] okay and I'm either going to be mad
[23:42] about it and persecute you call you
[23:46] crazy and have you put in prison you see
[23:48] what I'm saying how this is all this is
[23:49] way I see it's going to develop right
[23:52] and then all these preachers in the
[23:53] messages ain't going to see anything
[23:55] that ain't got the Holy Ghost just
[23:57] preaching the message by the
[23:58] that's right they're going to look out
[24:00] and they're going to not see anything
[24:01] that you see and they're going to what
[24:03] they're going to Brand you a heretic and
[24:06] have you put in prison what stop their
[24:09] mouth is that what Paul was trying to do
[24:11] with the Christians what was PA what
[24:12] Paul trying to do he said I put them in
[24:15] prison and caus them to blaspheme that's
[24:17] right all
[24:19] right that's a little bit off the
[24:21] subject but this what's coming through
[24:23] this message that's what's coming that's
[24:26] right dead in Christ shall rise first MH
[24:29] we want your Al and remain to be caught
[24:31] up to meet the Lord together in the air
[24:34] so we'll see them the whole world will
[24:36] not see him this is going to be a secret
[24:38] catching away so much to where brother R
[24:40] said people will go on to church
[24:42] thinking they're getting saved and
[24:44] getting the Holy Ghost right that's
[24:45] quote that's right right
[24:47] so to me that shows that everybody's not
[24:50] going to see what we see right that six
[24:53] Dimension is going to come in through
[24:54] here brother R going to come into this
[24:56] Dimension but we're the only ones going
[24:57] to be able to see it just like brother
[25:00] brandham you know he could he could see
[25:02] spirits and things because of being a
[25:03] prophet well Jesus could see the same
[25:05] thing right what that was another
[25:07] dimension he was looking in another
[25:10] dimension but standing in this one
[25:12] that's the same thing you and I we have
[25:14] that coming to us but we've got to get
[25:16] these seals together for the Redemption
[25:18] of this body because let me ask you a
[25:21] question what's the only thing holding
[25:24] us to this
[25:27] earth what's the only thing that's
[25:29] holding me from walking through that
[25:31] wall is one thing and that's the body
[25:34] that my mom and daddy gave
[25:36] me right you don't have to open door for
[25:38] a soul to leave what he just Steeps over
[25:41] in another dimension I can't do that
[25:44] with this now Jesus did with a glorified
[25:47] body when we get a glorified body we'll
[25:48] do the same thing but I'm talking about
[25:50] a human flesh body even listen here's a
[25:54] big key that should help you brother
[25:56] brandom couldn't take his body
[25:59] into that sixth
[26:00] Dimension
[26:02] hello he said I looked back and saw my
[26:05] flesh or my body laying in the bed
[26:07] that's right he couldn't that flesh is
[26:09] the bar that's holding us here right
[26:13] when Adam and Eve did what they did in
[26:15] flesh it didn't mark their soul it
[26:17] didn't Mar their soul they were Eternal
[26:19] right but it marred that body so much
[26:21] till God had to put them in a dimension
[26:23] to where they can't get out except what
[26:26] death is the only thing that leaves us
[26:28] that gets us into another place my
[26:30] brother R said death is our it's our we
[26:32] use him it's something we use it's our
[26:35] slave that we Ed to get out of this into
[26:37] another dimension but with a revelation
[26:40] of the word though when brother Brandon
[26:41] went across a current time they're
[26:43] they're telling
[26:44] him we in other words go back and preach
[26:48] a message because we're not complete we
[26:50] don't eat or drink here that probably
[26:53] baffled brother Brandon for a little bit
[26:54] but when he come back God showed him
[26:57] that that glorified body or that
[26:58] theophany body doesn't eat but they're
[27:01] coming back to get their human body
[27:03] connect make it glorified and then like
[27:05] Jesus listen Jesus had a glorified body
[27:07] when he ate fish right right he had a
[27:11] glorified body when he ate that fish and
[27:13] like I said many times that I
[27:15] Illustrated he didn't eat it and it hit
[27:16] the floor right it went somewhere it had
[27:19] some substance to it his body had
[27:21] substance to it so that's the same way
[27:23] with these seals what's coming forth of
[27:24] these seals is is to show us that our
[27:27] body is all already
[27:29] redeemed yes Amen to Wi the Redemption
[27:34] of our body to Wi to witness or to
[27:37] understand Paul already said it those
[27:40] who he is Justified he is
[27:42] already glorified he never said that
[27:45] glorification is coming he said it's
[27:47] already here because if you're born
[27:49] again today like I said you're already
[27:50] in rapturing condition that's right you
[27:52] just got to get your body lined up amen
[27:54] and if you have to go by the grave
[27:55] that's okay because that will purify
[27:57] everything you'll come right back
[27:58] but those that are alive and remain are
[28:00] going to stand with those seven Thunders
[28:02] I believe with the opening of the word
[28:04] the full opening of the word and stand
[28:06] and call the dead out of the
[28:07] ground but Satan starts right in church
[28:11] they then who crowns him remember who
[28:13] who Crowns Who crowns the devil who
[28:16] gives him his
[28:19] power right we do that's right cuz
[28:22] remember when we get into the Millennium
[28:24] what's the first thing brother R say
[28:26] Satan's Not Dead
[28:29] the spirits or the the the evil spirits
[28:31] are not dead right what they're just put
[28:33] in another dimension because he has
[28:36] nowhere to work what our minds are going
[28:38] to be pure yes Hey listen if we can
[28:41] stand and take a body change and then
[28:42] take a Rapture and go over in another
[28:44] dimension while the world's getting
[28:45] blown to
[28:47] Pieces Satan's not going to bother you
[28:49] anyway he'll be finished bothering the
[28:51] bride that's right now there'll be some
[28:52] that he'll try to work through which I
[28:54] don't understand completely I'll be
[28:56] honest with you but as one thing for
[28:57] sure the bride and the 144,000 can't be
[29:00] touched okay Satan can't touch them
[29:03] anymore when you get a glorified body
[29:05] you can't be touched that's right by
[29:07] Satan right I'm not saying you can't be
[29:08] touched you can't be you can't be
[29:11] influenced by Satan let's put it that
[29:13] way you can't be influenced by Satan and
[29:15] he went forth conquering and the conquer
[29:16] so what did he do he rode out in that
[29:18] church age conquered everything that was
[29:20] to conquer except what the True
[29:23] Believer okay that's why the dividing
[29:26] line is somebody ask
[29:29] was talking about foolish virgin or
[29:30] something foolish virgin
[29:33] is is closer to
[29:37] this as Satan is close to being real I
[29:41] mean being in the church sort of the
[29:43] foolish virgin but now you got to
[29:44] remember the foolish virgin they had a
[29:47] place to put oil they just didn't have
[29:49] the
[29:50] oil right all right that a place to put
[29:53] it because the on that had it said you
[29:55] need to go buy it
[29:58] your lamps are empty you don't have
[30:00] anything in your lamp in other words you
[30:01] don't have the Holy Ghost
[30:04] right and they're going to be so
[30:06] close but they're going to be in a
[30:09] deception because here's two things I
[30:12] want you to see this in all that you
[30:15] do if you're ignorant of what you do
[30:18] you're ignorant to me it's it's it's not
[30:21] bad to be ignorant because ignorant is
[30:25] just you don't know better you need to
[30:27] learn
[30:29] okay like we were talking about last
[30:31] night the definition of
[30:32] insanity definition of insanity is doing
[30:35] the same thing over again expecting I'm
[30:37] talking about expecting a different
[30:39] result right the drunk gets drunk he
[30:42] throws up he goes well next time I
[30:43] probably won't throw up well does the
[30:45] same thing you understand what I'm
[30:46] saying it's the same thing over and over
[30:47] again but now to be ignorant is not bad
[30:50] to stay ignorant is the problem so to me
[30:54] foolish virgins are are ignorant and not
[30:58] been
[30:59] taught cuz to be ignorant is not being
[31:01] taught now if somebody stands up and
[31:03] teaches you something and you turn it
[31:05] down whole different ball game yeah
[31:08] that's a word rejector okay all right so
[31:11] let's keep that in mind if you know
[31:12] better right and you do it remember
[31:16] that's the first deal iniquity that's
[31:18] right iniquity that's no one to do
[31:20] better and not doing it or no one to not
[31:22] do it and you do it anyway right but to
[31:25] me the foolish virgin is just going to
[31:26] be blinded by false Shepherds and not be
[31:30] told the whole truth right so that's the
[31:33] big difference and that's same thing
[31:34] with you and I if we've ever been made
[31:35] not if it's ever been made known to us
[31:37] cuz look this is the greatest message
[31:39] that ever come right right now um let's
[31:44] go to Wesley cuz there was Bibles for
[31:47] sure in Wesley's age in Luther's age
[31:48] they were putting it together and
[31:49] starting it but in Wesley's age he could
[31:51] read the Bible he read this right here
[31:54] but was ignorant to that yes is that
[31:58] okay he was ignorant to the fact that
[32:00] this was going to change his body yes
[32:03] right so but now does that make John
[32:06] Wesley lost no no he was ignorant to
[32:10] that right but see I think that's why
[32:12] brother Brown said being so important
[32:13] when you come up to a place to where
[32:15] everything's been made
[32:17] known it's either right or wrong right
[32:20] there's no gray area in between that's
[32:22] right all right so that's why that you
[32:25] see white white white church they had to
[32:28] be a real white church so that there
[32:29] would be a white righteous looking
[32:31] Church looking church so they could come
[32:36] together cuz look Satan deceived
[32:40] everybody even Luther and Wesley the
[32:42] deception was still there father son
[32:45] Holy Ghost baptism um no eternal hell
[32:47] and all the things like
[32:49] that you don't think it's so strong you
[32:51] listen whatever started back there is
[32:53] still going on today and 99% of the
[32:57] world Roman Catholic Baptist Methodist
[32:59] Pentecost all except a few believe that
[33:04] hell's Eternal that there's three gods
[33:07] and there's this and there's that and
[33:08] the other so look the deception is not
[33:11] over in a corner that's right the
[33:13] deception is worldwide when he gets on
[33:15] this horse it's like the prophet of God
[33:17] said he gets off this horse but it keeps
[33:19] going that's right where's it going in
[33:22] the people that's right that's where
[33:25] it's going in the people and they're
[33:27] taking off with it they become what was
[33:30] sitting on that
[33:31] horse I hate to say that but that's
[33:33] what's the truth that's why we need to
[33:36] see that that horse is going in that
[33:38] direction not this
[33:40] direction okay got it I don't want to be
[33:43] too loud start preaching we got to start
[33:44] teaching teaching all right so we found
[33:48] out all these and the seventh seal was
[33:50] his coming which I said was Jesus Christ
[33:52] the same yesterday day and forever but
[33:54] you must see then on this first seal
[33:57] that that God even that God that came to
[34:00] you 30 years ago if you got born again
[34:01] 30 years ago that when that God came to
[34:04] you that was God Almighty have you ever
[34:07] thought about
[34:08] this there's a man named God that named
[34:11] Jesus Christ but he's almighty God right
[34:13] right there's not three people sitting
[34:14] up there a daddy and a son and a spirit
[34:17] there's one man that's right that one
[34:19] man before the world was ever formed
[34:21] before you was ever formed okay he knew
[34:24] everything you would do from birth to
[34:26] death or birth to to change he knew
[34:29] everything you would do plus he knew if
[34:31] you made a choice to go this way what
[34:32] you would do that's right now that's
[34:34] just you what about the billions of
[34:37] people been on the face of the Earth he
[34:39] stood back in eternity Brother Ray which
[34:41] is eternity so he didn't have to he
[34:42] didn't have a time limit he stood back
[34:45] in eternity and he knew every person
[34:48] that would ever live every move they
[34:50] would
[34:51] make I can't fathom that one man did
[34:55] that one man
[35:00] and that he would come down and take on
[35:03] my flesh flesh like me and die on a
[35:07] cross yes to save my soul
[35:10] amen what a mighty God we
[35:13] serve he's so he's so infinite we can't
[35:17] understand it that's right we just can't
[35:19] I can't understand I mean even the
[35:21] little things that we do understand that
[35:22] we
[35:23] understand right I mean our our brain
[35:26] has they say you only used about a tenth
[35:28] of it but even if you used 100% of it
[35:32] you still not standing at the place
[35:34] where this great creator that created
[35:36] everything and wrote every one of these
[35:37] words before they ever were written on a
[35:39] piece of paper he knew every word that
[35:41] was going to be written and who would
[35:43] write it who would be born what do you
[35:45] tell Jeremiah before you were
[35:48] born I knew who you were I see when we
[35:51] come to that place that God has so much
[35:54] control
[35:59] cuz see if we see this as a mystery of
[36:01] iniquity it's that I'm hiding something
[36:04] that God don't know
[36:08] about
[36:10] hello cuz Satan sure did hide something
[36:13] that the people didn't know about that
[36:15] all right yeah right here if you read
[36:18] this what a lot of the commentary says
[36:19] oh that's a white horse that's the Holy
[36:21] Ghost right even the prophet preached
[36:24] that way for for a while but we know
[36:27] that true understanding is is that never
[36:30] was the Holy
[36:32] Ghost that was the
[36:34] Antichrist all right so see to me then
[36:36] the to me then what the what the U seals
[36:41] what the seals should do to you is it
[36:43] should make you more aware of what's
[36:45] already going on not what's been not
[36:47] what's coming what's already here and
[36:50] working yes these four horses are still
[36:53] here until we leave amen amen that's why
[36:57] we leave on the four seal that's the
[36:58] whole key is all the four horse riders
[37:00] are
[37:01] finished brother R you see said he said
[37:03] you see no more Beast which is the Beast
[37:06] are to help us right that's right four
[37:08] beasts L ox man and Eagle are to help us
[37:12] which is the Holy Ghost right so the
[37:13] Holy Ghost is talking to John saiding
[37:16] hey write this down and then I'm going
[37:18] to seal it up M until the time of the
[37:23] end right and then at the time of the
[37:25] end I'm going to open it up
[37:27] all right Revelations 10:7 you know all
[37:31] all those things and the days of the
[37:33] voice when all this is to be revealed so
[37:35] we come down to the end of the first
[37:37] seal and you know it's like I said
[37:39] you're looking for some big Crescendo
[37:42] you know you it's like an orchestra but
[37:44] really it's not it to me it's going to
[37:46] be the quietest thing that ever
[37:48] was cuz it's not a public show right the
[37:52] only thing it's going to be is is it's
[37:53] going to be obviously Christ in you the
[37:56] hope of glory and you and Christ talking
[37:59] together not more volume than you ever
[38:02] have before that's what I was saying
[38:05] before you say well God don't I want God
[38:07] to talk to me
[38:09] more well he talks to you all the time
[38:11] if you just
[38:13] listen tells you what to do what not to
[38:16] do sometimes we just don't listen we let
[38:17] this guy continue writing right here
[38:22] right continue
[38:23] riding and then he gives us what like
[38:26] brother Jill fory said he gives you a
[38:28] box of rattlesnakes and you just take it
[38:30] that's right you just take it somebody
[38:33] hands you a box of rattlesnakes you just
[38:34] take it no you better not especially if
[38:36] you know what's in it now we know what's
[38:38] in the box amen see now we know what's
[38:40] in the box okay same way with the first
[38:42] seal to me the first seal is the
[38:44] greatest seal because it shows God's
[38:46] love for us he's opening up something
[38:48] that he's never opened before never
[38:50] opened
[38:51] before even when Jesus preached it
[38:54] Matthew 24 for many shall come in my
[38:56] name and say I am Christ and shall
[38:58] deceive many now that is exactly what
[39:02] happened as soon as Jesus went
[39:05] up Satan came down and he started riding
[39:10] and like the prophet of God said that
[39:12] horse continues on and it's continued on
[39:14] right to this day right here all right
[39:17] to deceive
[39:18] now I want you to understand mystery of
[39:21] iniquity the mystery of one true and
[39:23] living God the mystery of justification
[39:27] cuz to be really to be truly
[39:30] Justified to go into glorification to be
[39:33] justified how can God hold
[39:37] anything what's the scripture how can
[39:39] God how can anyone hold the charge of
[39:40] God's elect okay right how tell me how I
[39:46] didn't do that right that's right yeah
[39:48] you did well well yeah you did in that
[39:51] old life but I was thinking the other
[39:54] day the things that I did
[39:59] remember the song of the things I do I
[40:01] do them no
[40:02] more we don't do them anymore but the
[40:05] thoughts are still there that's right
[40:07] because Satan has that one hold on you
[40:09] and really it's not your body it's your
[40:11] mind your memory right it's your it's
[40:14] what goes through your brain is what is
[40:16] killing you and me that's right but
[40:20] we've got to come to a place to where
[40:22] God you've got to put it back from Satan
[40:24] if he takes it and tries to give it to
[40:25] you like the box of rival tonight
[40:27] I don't want that that's right Satan you
[40:31] may know I did it I may know I did it
[40:35] but God doesn't know I did because he
[40:36] can't stand he can't stand here today
[40:39] and judge you that's right for what has
[40:42] been truly justifi that's right
[40:46] right that's the point you cannot if you
[40:50] get if you come to this end of this
[40:52] first seal you've got to see what you
[40:55] are God made manifest Amen in another
[40:59] form called a bride amen not your body
[41:02] that's
[41:03] right your soul right your soul we got
[41:07] to get this amen your soul never did
[41:10] wrong if there's any little speck like a
[41:15] like a a a black pepper you take one
[41:17] Speck of black pepper and put it in the
[41:20] ocean there still a black Speck out
[41:22] there somewhere but not with God it's
[41:25] gone it's fin finished and done right he
[41:29] sees you white and righteous that's
[41:34] right but now remember you can't say
[41:37] well I don't have to that that means cuz
[41:41] see a lot of people say the opening of
[41:42] the seals is we're already in the
[41:43] Millennium so we don't have to do right
[41:45] it's just this bodies what's doing it
[41:47] see how that's real close yes CU it is
[41:49] that
[41:52] really I mean we're all adults here your
[41:55] soul is not what
[41:58] you and your wife do when you know you
[42:00] that's true that's not your soul doing
[42:02] that that's your body doing that that's
[42:05] your flesh doing that right not your
[42:07] soul so you got to realize that that
[42:09] Soul inside of you if it is born
[42:12] again it never had a bad thought it
[42:15] never had a memory of what I used to do
[42:19] that's right cuz if God has a memory of
[42:21] what you used to do you can't be
[42:25] justified that's right
[42:27] that's good that ought to make you
[42:29] excited that's to me that's the end of
[42:31] that seal is is that but now listen you
[42:35] going to prove who you are that's right
[42:37] you can suppress it and suppress it and
[42:39] suppress it though that's true just like
[42:41] the woman that taught Sunday school but
[42:42] when she got ready to pass away what
[42:45] happened brother Bram said the real
[42:47] person what the thing she had pushed
[42:50] down for all the real person came up and
[42:53] she knew she was black inside right but
[42:56] if you're pure inside today if you got
[42:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your
[43:02] soul you're just as Eternal as
[43:06] God and listen the Bible says you don't
[43:09] have need of nothing and but see that
[43:10] now see people will go in the opposite
[43:12] dress and go well I don't have to go to
[43:14] church no more I don't have to study I
[43:16] just go do what I want that proves who
[43:17] you are right proves who you are right
[43:21] right you going to we're going to prove
[43:23] who we are but that white righteous
[43:25] church that the real one the real white
[43:27] righteous church is White has no spot
[43:31] Bible says have no spot or
[43:33] wrinkle the Bible's already told us what
[43:36] we what what we are we just not
[43:38] believing it what we're doing is we're
[43:40] running it through this filter that's
[43:42] right and this guy is still doing his
[43:45] job amen well you're okay you don't have
[43:49] to right so when you come to the end of
[43:53] this it should be a
[43:55] revelation that I am just as Eternal as
[43:58] God is and what's inside of me came from
[44:01] him and what's inside of me is going
[44:03] back to him all right but now what I
[44:05] done now same way with Jesus when Jesus
[44:07] said I come from God and go back to God
[44:09] that flesh never was up there with God
[44:11] that's right right so he picked up a
[44:13] flesh down here that's right is that
[44:15] what we're doing that's right we just
[44:17] have sin problems that's right we're
[44:19] blackened by that he never was so we
[44:22] don't have to worry about that we have
[44:23] to worry
[44:25] about this part here that's true but if
[44:29] you don't see that you're just as
[44:30] Eternal as God is that seal really has
[44:32] not open that's right cuz to see one
[44:35] true and living God is like brother R
[44:37] said the Oneness of God is God and Adam
[44:40] and Eve back in the Garden of Eden like
[44:42] they used to be you say no that's three
[44:44] to God is one that's right right one the
[44:47] Revelation one true and living God is
[44:49] God with his CH with his family that's
[44:51] Revelation one true Living God not that
[44:53] we're just they're just going to be one
[44:55] person no no we're a many membered body
[44:58] amen we didn't choose that that's what
[45:00] he chose that's right we just got to see
[45:03] that that's what we're chosen for we'll
[45:05] start on the second seal next time now
[45:06] look this
[45:08] one this one here shows
[45:11] you there's a mystery there that we
[45:13] still have to see you you can't just say
[45:15] it cuz you know what soon as you leave
[45:18] this room Satan's going to test you on
[45:20] it amen and then tomorrow he's going to
[45:23] test you on it the next day he's going
[45:24] to test you on it and he's going to keep
[45:26] testing because he has one thing that
[45:28] that could work through and that's
[45:29] through your brain that's right the best
[45:31] thing you do is resist the devil and
[45:33] he'll flee from you and then let's go on
[45:35] to Perfection as Paul said and start on
[45:37] the second seal all right let's go
