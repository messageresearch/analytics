========================================

yes thank you all right now we were discussing last Sunday we were talking about false bit on Christ what we were doing I hope you understood what I was talking about I was thinking more yesterday the being the greatest deception if you if you can't see one true Living God if you can't see means to understand right don't mean you got to see you got to understand one true and living God and that Jesus Christ is his name there's no other God before him nor other God after right but that there are three manifestations of that same God but if you watch the devil knows the weak part and the word's not weak people are weak right he knows the weakness what I was thinking about yesterday he knows every one of your weaknesses before you do before you know it so he has already developed a plan I say just like the Catholic Church the Catholic church plans 30 years in advance oh yeah governments plan years in advance I I think we sit here sometimes and we go we we make God so small and then we make the devil so small well yeah the devil is not he doesn't have any power but he does have to work to us and I was also thinking yesterday that um uh you know what does a Creator need with us he self-existing he needed no one to begin with that's right but his desire is just like our desire is is to have friends and family that was his desire so whatever God's desire is the problem with us we have a desire to do something and then we we you know a lot of people you say boy I got big plans I got these plant um and then they get Qui yeah a little bit but that's okay I'll step over here um you know I've got big plans but now a lot of times those plans don't come to pass why we don't know the future we don't know every Avenue but now not God his thoughts are Eternal so whatever he thought that's what's going to happen that's right and it's going to develop into a reality cuz listen God's not a fantasizer you understand what I'm saying in in the you know sometimes we sit and go boy what can I do with a million dollars and what can I do with see that's human thoughts and ideas and and fantasizing and things that that maybe never come to pass don't tell me you've never sat and thought about something that never come to pass oh yeah millions of times you know well why we're finite we don't know the journey you say what's this got to do with the seals that horse rider took a journey yeah right he rode where did he ride through me you he's not out here riding it would be wonderful if he was out here riding on the highway we would let him continue where he's going that's right but we're like Brother Gary Atkin said we we give him bows and and I'm telling you another thing this is this is for me we pull the rains and bring him back toward us yeah you know how you pull the horses range and you turn them around that's what we do we get that fellow like brother R was talking about riding away from us and then we go well no I don't know me say about that you bring him right back you know bring him right back but we must see that power go away and stay away now with God like I said with God he's in a journey predestination listen like Brother D has been talking about predestination is very simple and that's why the steals takes every Avenue and puts it right in line predestination is a predetermined destination that's what predestination means pre before you get here pre Destiny is a journey determination your determination has been destined by God but it was not just that God put you in a tube and pulled you through it and said you're going to do this and this and this right he gives us guidelines right to go by but he knows why do you think he put him out there why do you think he put the guideline out there somewhere down the road you'd need it that's why he put that in the word he put every scripture in that word to where if you have a problem you can go right to it well how do you know that he's infinite we are finite but heading toward an infinite amen heading toward you yeah listen if we have the mind of Christ I thought we had it already here that's right we have the infinite one inside of us that's right and having the mind of Christ we can look through and and not exactly listen we can't predetermine tomorrow nobody knows what tomorrow is going to be that's right humanly that's right but if we pray to God he knows whether we'll pray for something or not he knew before the foundation of the world if we were going to pray for a certain thing to happen or not pray for a certain thing to happen right so that way he could predetermine that destination by for knowing everything that's going to happen from your life to your death or change of the body of whichever happened first right so as God's in a journey Satan rides out in a journey also where did he attack first he didn't attack no you don't need to be a prostitute you don't need to be that no one God he knew if he could break that Doctrine down and see 606 ad they tried it in 303 took 300 more years wow that's slow development but buddy when Satan put it out for the people they accepted it even the Christian Believers accepted it right so it must have been pretty good you know it's like brother R says he Satan presented his product he presented a product that's right and they bought it right because you know why he knows your Humanity just like God knows your Humanity why do you think he waited till Eve and Adam got put in flesh before he did what he did in the garden he couldn't touch them while they were in that theophany that's he couldn't touch them that was God that was God in another form but when God put him in human flesh to be attached to the Earth Satan said all right I found the weak spot okay I found a spot to get into now right so honestly to be to be real to go way back Satan started riding as soon as he fell from Earth it wasn't that he just rode in the church age no man he was way back he he was the one in the Old Testament in in U theila and and the Giant and all the opposition that was Satan riding and presenting his plan and program listen it's so good his program is so good till it did almost deceive the very left right right that's how good it is it's not that it's bad cuz we going to read right here you talking about false Christ Anointed with the true Holy Ghost but false now that don't make the Holy Ghost false that's right all those is true amen now what happens between the truth Purity um unprecedented truth that has that that never ever can be changed but one it's filtered through your brain and Satan's tactics they come out with a trinity wow to me that's what's outstanding about that first seal when it opened it shows me and I believe it showed the prophet of God and any True Believer it shows what's false and what's true you got to start with that first if not if you would have started with a white horse rider four seals later that's the white righteous Church that's Satan working no God had to expose him right at first right yeah and expose that doctrine of hey we got to get back to one true and living God like the Bible says about zerubabel which we know that that's the type with brother Rand he came he didn't make a New Foundation he didn't make a new Bible right what did he do he swep off that foundation and built on it all right so what was it was it Satan's Foundation no it's God's Foundation mind built on Satan's Foundation that's right got it and he was so intertwined with God that's what to me is is is hard for my human brain to understand how Satan and God can I I don't say they work together but but they're real close right him being the most evil of evil of evil of evil yet he can stand right there beside God wherever God goes He just moves right there next to him wherever God moves he just moves right there next to him I that's hard for me to see because of all the when we see filth and things it looks like it takes us further away from God right we we feel dirty I mean just the little things we do we feel so away from God but there's Satan he's causing us to do that well who's causing us to do that actually who listen who's the root cause of this whole thing we are we are okay so when you see a when you see brother Rand and and what an outstanding statement here's a lamb with a book in his hand he had the book of redemption now brother R was not Jesus Christ he wasn't God but he was a representative at the time the only Prophet on the earth God can only speak through a prophet right and bring a word which was a pure word it wasn't a it's like brother R said he said I don't filter this through my brain right God brings it and he said sometimes he speaks things that he don't even understand himself why because it was God passing right through all that yes stuff Humanity error um Trials of life things that gets us all muddled up inside when brother Bron preached those deals he knew that God was speaking see God was speaking all along but he knew right then that what something was happening right there that had never happened before right God had loosed something that had never been that had been bound the prophet of God said by Creeds and dogas what was Creeds and dogas Catholic Church presenting father Son and Holy Ghost um um Trinity hell was eternal you see what I'm saying he was tearing the word down but what how was he tearing the word down through religion he wasn't tearing the word down through prostitution ranks and and and you know all this he was tearing it down in the church you know why Satan knew that he knew if he could get into the church it would be real easy to get out there think of that if he can get in here it's real easy to get out there cuz they have nothing to combat it with I'm talking about the world they have nothing to combat it with so if Satan can get in that's why it talks about in uh we're talking about the seat of Satan where he's sitting in the temple of God sitting in the temple of God that's right that's right showing himself to be God but when that prophet of God that first seal open to him he saw something move away from him right see now he had the doctrine of one true and living God correct but I believe once the seals open that it it brought it down to me and you so that you and I can understand that there's only one true and living God cuz see brother R preach one true a living God way back in the 40s and the 50s right he said but he said serpent Sav one go all these doctrines were revealed in the seal you say revealed I say completely revealed okay it was imp partiality all the way up through okay he never listen he never came up to the first seal and said now what baptism I've taught it as father son Holy Ghost now I'm going to teach the Lord Jes no he T father he taught Father Son and Holy Ghost was false from the beginning yeah but remember in the seals if you're reading any of the seals in the second or third seal he says I've always wondered why I was against now he preached why I was why I'm against organized religion in 1959 4 years before the seals open he said but now I understand why I was so against that thing what did it do it revealed something to him right that had never been revealed before and then what did he do he passed it to you and I right right and I like what brother Clark said one time he said brother Bown said I can't keep a secret well thank God he can't keep a secret God knew he couldn't keep a secret that's why he told him the secrets of the Bible so he could tell you and I amen and we have it in Book and Tape form and then we have to take it and running through our filter because we're individuals that's right all right but you see what I'm talking about you see why that first seal opening was so important is to is to go ahead and separate that thing now that we see this separation we see that Satan is so close then when the second seal opens it should be easier to see that red horse him getting on a red horse and riding that second horse it should be easier cuz we know who he is we know what the horse is we know what all the symbols are but we just got to get that underlying meaning of that seal that's right you say well I've always belied one true and R of God can you sit and explain it you ought to be able once that seal broke brother Bram he was able to explain things that no had ever explained in their entire life okay you got to know how to you what the Bible say you got to give a reason of the hope that's in you you got to be able to tell people well we believe in one true and living God so does the Baptist they'll tell you right they got a song out now by Steven Curtis Chapman is the one true God Jesus Christ the one true God now that's that's out in the secular or the um yeah ecclesiastical world Right singing about one true God and Jesus is his name you see what I'm saying you see how close one word off I'm telling you one word off in all these seals I don't believe brother Randon was one word off he was spot on he knew what he was talking about he had the confidence that God was doing the talking and that he had nothing to do with it okay to me I believe that's why he said I'm working in such a spiritual realm mhm I'm just letting go and moving out of the way but Now look for years he had done that he'd always tell he said I got to get myself out of the way so he can come but that was for The Healing Ministry what about a man standing there with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Manifest the Son of God and he still got to wait on something the an anointing to tell the people what their problems were well I was you know I was thinking I did a lot of thinking yesterday we didn't just do a lot of selling we did a lot of thinking I did a lot of thinking but you take that scripture where it says that the word is a discerner of the thought you think well that's brother brand is it did he just tear that piece out and take it with him we have when we bring in the true word of God that's what brother R was trying to do when we bring in the true word of God that word you don't do it you and I will make a mistake that's right exactly but that word will divide what goes on in your soul that's right you notice it said nothing about your body that's right M cuz your body is nothing that's right your body never boy when brother Dale gets into this I hope he gets into this real good cuz your body never sin that's right do like your preachers do they go amen preach it Brother come on your body never sin a day in his life oh yeah it did no it didn't Adam and Eve were told to multiply and replenish the Earth before they were put in flesh bodies now we know what happened to Satan what he do he perverted it right right amen but your spirit and your soul is the two most wi is it say that's why I was thinking why does it not say body the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart dividing us under the soul and the spirit didn't say a thing about the body listen your body came here only as a product of sin to get your soul inside of it so that God can work on it amen just like I was talking about um uh God is was encapsulated in that flesh called Jesus Christ yes but remember the capsule that you take has a hard lining around it but what inside's good for you but you got to take it that's right for it to dissolve hello somebody for it to dissolve right but it's gotten dissolved once you take it in that outside piece has gotten dissolved and let what's inside out exactly that's been our problem but see Satan knows that's what's our problem right that's why he beats on this thing yeah all the time we're a product of sin don't get me wrong this is a sinful body yes but it has not sined that's right what's inside of me is what's making me Smoke Drink curse my vocal cords don't curse on their own right does it no it just lays there it just it's just there it's just like brother R said it's just twitching muscles cuz Hey somebody mentioned it the other day and I really enjoyed it an animal's got life right it breathes it thinks to a degree that's true right right it and you know what it was having um it was multiplying and replenishing in those bodies sure was in the garden yeah the animal kingdom was procreating before Adam and Eve that's right that's right okay and that you're right that was okay for the thing it was given for so what did Satan do Twisted it uhhuh he said B he said as soon as God puts him in that flesh body I know where I'm going okay I know where I'm going and that's what he did but now what we got to do we got to reverse that out right if our soul is redeemed right if you're born again your soul is redeemed that's right we're waiting for the the Redemption of the body what are we waiting for we're waiting for that to filter through the spirit to get to the body but really it's the spirit realm that's cuz this thing like I said this thing's not sinning right all this does is a mechanism for your spirit and soul to work through Daddy was talking about to it we're coming to I I believe we're at that place to it we are understanding the Redemption of the body that bring it to pass that's correct I want you to think of something else too the word wit does mean understanding but if you'll keep looking what's the first word first what's the first syllable in witness can I say it wi to wit or to witness we're going to be a witness that's what w is to understand witness is well if you're a witness of something what do you do you saw it you understand what happened and you tell somebody about it right you're a witness so wit starts it with wit the syllable wit so Paul could say both to understand and to witness the Redemption of the body now when you witness the Redemption of the body you're either being redeemed or you're lost okay but the lost ones are not going to see I don't believe they're going to see us now let me let me I'm getting off the mark a little bit but when our bodies when we're changed in the moment in twinkling of an eye right I don't know that will disappear but I don't think the world's going to be able to to to what I'm saying is if Sister Trudy gets she gets changed and we're waiting that 30 to 40 days your if if your sisters were alive or your kids or whatever if they don't get changed they not I don't believe they're going to be able to to bother us or cuz remember Jesus said don't touch me I'm not yet sended there was a process going on in that in that glorified body but now once he did they could touch him but remember he didn't hang around him a lot he disappeared what I'm saying is you get a glorified body and and it's going to be hard for somebody to be around you that doesn't have a glorify body that's why I believe brother rown said we'll all be gathered together now who who cares where it is but I think we'll all be gathered together before we go up I really do where who knows if we're in a glorified body we can travel like I thought anyway that's right okay you can take a trip to Alaska and be back and you don't even know you went that's right you say boy that's real that's real um that's what you call fantasy no that ain't fantasy that's reality but we're going toward the witnessing the be the beginning of the change of the body yes because if your Soul's redeemed God's working on your spirit and your body he he's not working on the soul the soul is redeemed that's right right right those who he has Justified he has already glorified now he didn't say now not your flesh that's right did he not did he say that he never said that that's right those who he justified he's already glorified so you went from a Justified condition in your baby form if you wish all the way through the stages and you know how we teach it here three stages of justification three stages of sanctification just a higher order of the same justification right all right we know we did it in this justification I'm doing this for the younger on we know we did it the justification when you got saved told God ask God to forgive you of your sins he forg gave you of your past right then amen but not your future sin right but now when you get born again MH then he starts working justifying you through the statute of perfect man and then now as brother Dale and we're getting in the seals talking about adoption you're going to turn and be able to look and see that scripture those who he has Justified he's already glorified and that justified is see yesterday there was a there was a bank robbing in Atlanta now this morning they called and said I did it mhm I was inaz for yesterday I didn't do it that's right right I was accused of doing it that's right so whose problem is it the accuser that's why I said with these seals once you see to me the seals gives you little more ammunition to know what the devil's coming at you with and you can fight it amen yes I believe that's what the seals are for because if the seals are for the Redemption of the body it's got to be working in that Spirit Realm memory reason conscience affection and Imagination that's what we got to deal with cuz like I said the body is just it's just a structure for your soul and spirit to live in yes sir yes sir I was just reading that Jesus said clearly he said it's not the things on the outside that def follow man but the things that within that's correct that the Father the man the fornication and everything comes from within the man that's right cuz he said he said you eat something and it goes out the drop goes you know natural thing see Jesus went right straight to our Natural Body he told you what you eat goes out to go out the bathroom part that's right he was pretty plain he said don't worry about that that's right right that's right that's okay and that's been permitted that's that that's why you were given that that's right okay amen but the inside person is the one that that's got a fact that's right is that inside guy all right so it's just it's it's really bringing it to me it's bring it more down to um focusing on what's going on in our spirit if you're born again now if you're not born again you need to get born again then God can work on your spirit cuz if not if you got Satan inside kind of hard for God to work on the spirit part that's right right it's real hard that's right okay but with these seals this like I said it's it's no more than your new birth amen being made manifest more than it ever has before that's right brother bram's New Birth was to me was made manifest so much more when he was bringing the the operation of the seals the Holy Ghost was operating through that Prophet bringing the seals and opening them up okay because if you say they're closed then see you can't talk about this that's why I said the people that say that that the seals are closed they can't talk about this if you say the seals are closed I don't know if you're born again or not you know you understand what I'm saying yes cuz you don't understand that's right you you read that two with of redemption of the body and you know what you do you go well one day okay that's right and most people most denominational people now not so much in me most most denominational people believe that there's just going to be a date on the calendar that God's going to come want me at least in ter talk about they have a new Left Behind to move so you going to be left behind twice I get money but's see money some but Kirt Cameron bless his heart he ain't made it to Heaven yet he's Left Behind twice but in the movie though and the way denomination say that there's going to be a Rapture mhm I guess of the ones that deserve it first I'm not trying to be faist I'm trying to understand what they're talking about cuz they have a Rapture then after that they had a left behind and these people get saved after the Rapture takes place before the tribulation the foolish yeah they they're foolish foolish version but now I don't know about this next layer I don't know about that left behind but you understand it we laugh about it but we should cuz they sincerely believe it Hey listen a sincere Catholic will outlive you any day as far as going to church and work right yes but watch Satan he's work work work work work work work make them work so they won't think yeah that's what it is really it is this's been in it she knows the whole system work with work don't worry about God let the priest worry about God you know what a lot of times we do the same thing that's right that's right yes brother Dale save our children brother Dale teach us A good sermon come on brother but I'm going to go home and anyway hello somebody they say hello somebody brother Keith read I like it when brother Keith start doing that and brother dick goes hello hello somebody di goes hello please answer me back he said hello somebody so he said but look watch brother brand watching go to Matthew 24 now that's where the seals are right that's where the seals came into be he didn't say that shise false Jesus is right right false Christ look what it says no you get a Pentecostal that's a real Pentecostal say itself he is Jesus no words he said you they ain't going to take it you get a false Methodist or a Baptist or somebody like that or one of the organization say we are Jesus they know better than that and who's they Satan and his demons they know better than that right they ain't going to do that but the Bible said it would be false Christ not Jesus's but false Christ they won't they wouldn't recognize say I'm Jesus Oh No but they're false Christ and don't know it right because they're contrary to the word that's right if you really read anointed ones of the end time it'll about scare you to death really that how close it is that it's so close that it could why would the Bible even you know put that sentence in there that it could deceive the very if it were possible and then brother Rand comes through here into the sermon and he says but it's not possible but now it is possible to deceive this guy and go into the spirit realm that's right he does that every day that's right hello somebody he does that every day but he can't get to that soul that soul is the most important thing it's like brother Lis is saying don't worry about the man that can kill the body right that's right worry about the man that can kill the soul there's only one man can kill the soul and that's God Almighty cuz he created Soul Satan can't kill us all he perverts it so God has to kill it got it cuz look I would that all be saved Bible says Jesus Christ came to save everybody on the face of this Earth but knew who would and who wouldn't that's right so there's a chance there an opportunity right but once they turn it down once Satan gets them to seal theirself away then God can't get to them anymore because he has to go by his law yeah in the Bible That's where this come from that shall arise false Christ right false anointed ones that's why he talking the anointed ones at the end time all right let's see there's one more want to reading then we I want to see if anybody has any questions there one I was reading this morning right here let's see right here all right now no they wouldn't stand he's he's reiterating what he said f Jesus if they wouldn't be stand call Jesus certainly not that's too plain anybody knows that anyone know it wasn't Jesus I don't care they had all on their back and blood on their hands and up and down their eyes and that was going on during his time yeah that was a man that that had U he had a a bile of oil underneath his U thing right there and he would he would shake it and there would oil come out on his hands you know but now look see that to me that's not that deceived a few but it didn't deceive the real Christian that's right okay it didn't it didn't deceive the real Christian it deceived others and blood on their hands well that's what he had the guy had a bow and had some blood that was like right here and he would break it you have a little bile he' break it and blood would run out on the hand and oil on the back now he saw all that anybody that's got good sense no it wasn't Jesus they would stand for him but they call themselves the anointed and they do signs and wonders almost to deceive the very elect but false Christ anointed one shall arise and shall deceive the elect if it were possible now don't miss this statement because it's worthy to listen so I think we ought to listen he's putting tape on the microphone notice not Jesus is false Christ they believe they're anointed but they know they're not Jesus right that's too plain if man went up and said look at the scars on my hand look at my brow I'm Jesus well now we know that's wrong remember Jesus Jesus never said that them guys them guys would appear he said they would appear false Christ Christ plural that's right meaning denominations and so forth it's not just denominations and so forth all right anointed ones Anointed with the denominational spirit IR now see a denominational spirit is what happened back here at 606 was a denom what's a common denominator it's a division it's it's dividing they ought to know right off that the denomination was a divider that's right right it was a division right that's right and so forth but they were deceived anointed ones Anointed with the denominational spirit and not the word you follow it not false jesuses false Christ then he's talking about three classes of people ham sham which is what the believer the mate believer and the unbeliever now the unbeliever is the one that we were talking about last Sunday that they don't have sin they're Sinners they just don't believe they don't believe yeah right but these people right here are M believing they're they're believe trying to believe something that's that's make believe listen where is a father son Holy Ghost any kind of Doctrine right anywhere in God's word anywhere but that's where they find it at when they're make believer that's right where do you see that there's um a trinitarian Doctrine in the Bible it's not written there that's right but yet they get it out of the Bible so they're mate believing that it's true what's a mate believer a mate believer is an impostor somebody that thinks they're this but they're not or even trying to act like that's true okay but now you you got the True Believer that now watch now you say well we're going to cast these away and we're just going to be Believers go back up where it said would almost deceive the very elect so that that Doctrine and that demon is right there right with the believer right that's what false anointed is that's what false anointed ones is that's right right here with the Believers yes two spirits in the framework of what this church cor that's right yes that's why it's kind of scary but when you get a revelation that that thing I say thing that demon part of that doctrine that you've had before is going away from you right you better have confidence in one thing that God is doing something in your life okay that's why I think brother BR when he saw that when he saw that Doctrine unfold where he had taught many years that the Holy Ghost was a was a white horse rider when he realized that that God come back and gave him a revelation contrary to what he had okay M right that that was residing so close to that prophet and he sees it leave him right I believe i' had a shot in that I mean really don't you think when you well when you see a revelation I know I know some people act different but and it excites you but it also humbles you yes you know why it humbles you because you know one thing for sure it wasn't the devil that brought itre so brother C you know one thing if you get a revelation then God it's like Brother D always said if you get a revelation of what's going on just claim whatever say whatever you need that's right cuz cuz it is true it's not a fantasy God is so close right there amen right cuz if he brings a revelation like I said the devil has to move out of the way that's right devil can that's one thing he can't stand he can't stand the word that's right now he can stand all of our little quirky ideas and all of our little things we do in life he can he can he can stand that that's right but when God brings a revelation which is the power of the word he has to move out and that's what brother Bram he said here stands the Lamb with the book his hand well that Christ had come down Revelations 10:1 the mighty Angel come down with a book in his hand that was open man and it wasn't brother brandom he wasn't Christ he was a filter he it's what he said he was a trumpet what does a trumpet do trumpet you sit it down and never makes a noise that's it right it don't make its own noise right that's right right but there is a capability inside that trumpet to make a noise if the person picks it up and blows it same way with brother Brown he and that's our problem we we're not able to be a prophet like he's being a prophet and get ourselves so far out of the way till it's it's God just completely taking over what to show visions and to show the thoughts and intents of the heart I believe we can still do that I mean we have discernment we there was a guy yesterday that was right beside of us and he's he's a nominal Christian guy but he said they were at a festival one time they were kind of in a a low place and he said and it was supposed to go on like Saturday and and it was Friday night and they were doing good and he said something spoke to him and he is he's a good Christian guy I mean tries tried the best he can real humble brother and we met him twice we met him up here little but um he um he said something spoke to me and said get out close your stuff and he said it just like a man spoke right in my ear he said I didn't know nothing there was nothing going on there was no storm he told his wife he said let's pack up and go to a motel M so they packed up one the motel that night it rained like 4 and 1/2 in flooded the whole CGR wow blowed everybody's stuff down in the river they had left their stuff there blow it down in the river and it took them days to find the stuff wow so now you say well he just a no God speaks to the people that will listen that's right that's what he and he was he was glorifying God he wasn't glorifying himself he was glorifying God that God would speak to him and say get your stuff and move and right where he was at just went down the river wow and all the people that didn't hear from God they lost everything they had so you know thank God for that that he moves but now take that though and bring that into a higher level for you and I but I'd rather listen and hear it here right yeah amen yeah not just in this building you understand but but when we go upstairs and we hear God speak to us that should be God speaking to us resonating resonating every week every day just have little thoughts in your mind I have become and that is the same way he's not a prayer Warrior and I'm not a prayer Warrior he don't study seven days a week neither do I but I'm always thinking about something something's always coming or something will happen like that man that's what I thinking about last night that guy said that and I said well if you can speak to that man yes and give him a revelation to move then you can speak to me and give me a revelation for the people today that's what I was saying so he's not a respected person he's not the guy humbled himself enough to where that that God spoke to him and he listened right that's the same way with this you don't if you're an unbeliever then you're lost we we got to categorize this thing if you're an unbeliever you're lost that's right you need salvation amen you don't need to move over in here you move over here you're a Believer cuz a m believer is somebody that believes they got it and they don't that's fa but there's so close see I Satan's Satan's Satan's not an unbeliever no no he's not an unbeliever he makes people unbelievers that's right but he's not an unbeliever he's a m believer that's right that's right but he really believes he's a Believer he thinks he can take God some way and you know go around the corner and oh got him but he can't that's the that's what you and I got to realize he can't do it false Christ will come they are here now that's right yes been here since Paul's day that's been 2,000 years and they've been honing their skillsa right for one word off that's what's coming to the battle the battle brother rown said it's not we don't go to the battle of Armageddon right right we don't have a a mount trans configuration battle Jesus fought that out right we have a Mount Zion okay battle what where was Zion on top of the hill that's right that's where we're going to have to worry right here when we get up there to where that that um uh God's going to start moving and either you're going to move in or you're going to move out and I'm not saying in and out of a building I'm saying in or out that's right okay or we're going to start like Brother D said we'll just keep going by the grave uhh because we are not um I say not believing enough they don't that don't make you an unbeliever that's don't call yourself an unbeliever cuz you say well I just don't see that no you just don't understand it yet yes that's right and I always say yet I put a comma never put a period put a comma that's right put a comma that's right cuz brother R was talking about something one time he said don't put a period there put a comma yeah that's right I believe one true Living God comma but there's more for me to there's more for me to understand that's right cuz somebody will challenge you if you stand up and say I believe in one through and Liv of God somebody's going to walk up and say explain that would you about how that a father can talk to a Son and the Holy Ghost is overshadowing and this then you see all these parts going into different places and what are you going to do okay that's what I'm not asking you you got to ask yourself that question what are you going to do because that false Christ brother Brandon saw that going away on that first Feld now next Sunday we'll take the second seal but we're going to lap back to the first and then go a little bit further on to the second so read the second seal if you wish but read anoyed ones at the end time it'll really make you realize that you know before we leave it's real obvious when we do things wrong yes yes right we're condemned we feel bad we we ask for forgiveness or or what more but what about those little things that are still inside of us that we don't that we don't know is wrong yet yeah like brother bandam he walked several years with that Doctrine not in his soul that's right not in his soul okay but in his his Spirit realm that's right his memory takes him back to a mighty conqueror okay Jesus on a white horse and all these things and he put that together himself okay God didn't but when you come to these seals God put it all together yes so what did it do it wiped out that part okay that's why he was rejoicing God wiped out a part that had a little bitty Black Spot somewhere that Satan had a little bitty hold and then now he's gone that's what you and I got to work on let's go oh
