bibles let's um turn to the book of ecclesiastics chapter 12. ecclesiastics chapter 12. hey man and we're gonna start reading that verse nine if you haven't say man the bible says and moreover because the preacher was wise he still taught the people knowledge yea he gave good heed and sought out and set in order many proverbs the preachers sought to find out acceptable words and that which was written was upright even words of truth the words of the wise as the words of the wise are as golds and as nails fastened by the master of assemblies which are given from one shepherd and further by these my son be admonished of making many books there is no end and many study is a weariness i mean much study is a weariness of the flesh verse 13 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man for god shall bring every work into judgment which every secret with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil amen lord bless reading of his word you can have your seats you know i want to use for a subject today uh just as a statement now what now what you know church um if if if we're talking to the young people or even if we're talking to just people in general you know as believers if you ask the question now what if you think about life and what you're trying to achieve and after you achieve it then what then what you gonna do you know if you say well i'm gonna serve god you know after i get married after you get married now what you say i'ma serve god after i get my house after you get the house now what you say i'ma serve god after that give me a good job god gives you the job now what the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear god and serve him amen well not just to come to church play ties and play instruments no fear god with a reverence that you will give your life yes so i say you know now what you say brothers why you come up with that particular thought now what because i want to show you uh the life of solomon now we know that according to the scripture solomon was one of the most wisest men that ever walked the face of the earth you know uh uh he god basically he went to god he asked god for wisdom to lead his people amen i hope young people i hope you read in your bibles he asked for wisdom to lead his people and god said because you asked for wisdom i'mma give you everything that your heart desires you know because the scripture says seek ye first the kingdom and then everything else that you need will follow you so god will answer you now what if you're seeking the kingdom so church we don't want to young people we don't want to just let our own goals or our own aspirations or desires get in the way of what god has for us you know i've been there you know i wanted to be as a young man i wanted to be a professional football player and would have made it if god's will wasn't in the way hallelujah did y'all hear how i put that hallelujah god honest faith and you know i had faith enough to believe in myself and was on my way had trophies after trophies but then god said that's not what i got for you so god directed my path put me exactly where i needed to be and allowed me to have cancer in my brain just to keep me in a proper place you know i'll tell her by the way that even when things happen that i can't explain i never say the devil did this all right the devil did that or the devil didn't no i don't do that because then i put the devil in control of my life i always say god what are you doing i'm looking for an answer from god if we are god's children if you are god's tripping children the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by god so anything you go through if you're asking now what you have to say god did this and people may look at your trial of what you're going through and don't understand it but do not confess the devil is doing this even pharaoh was under god's control church now for those of y'all who know me ain't nothing change coleman hallelujah not changed the joy of the lord when we all get together hallelujah we got a song we're saying dang you know what i'm talking about when we all get together get together we're going to be shouting hallelujah oh my god but if you look at solomon solomon had great wisdom but before we get into his life i want you to understand the wisdom solomon had was the wisdom of god hallelujah in his lifetime the things that he did hallelujah he wasn't being tricked he everything he did was according to the knowledge and wisdom of god everything that he partook of everything he laid his hands on he did it all in wisdom the devil couldn't say i tricked him like eve no he knew full well what he was doing and some of you young people are here today full well know what you are doing don't be gullible that's my angel your angel knows what she is doing [Applause] that's my little soldier your soldier knows what he is doing many times if you send your child to school to go to public school and because we christians hallelujah we think spirits can't get on our children different things happening yo yo the teacher report the child and the first thing you say is not my baby yeah your baby your baby if your baby you don't have the holy ghost there's something to do anything let me get back up here i'm preaching to the parents hallelujah you young people pull and god have something tasty for you but church you young people i wanna i wanna challenge you hallelujah to not be a weakling anybody can just go with the flow of the world but it takes somebody strong to look at their peers and look at the people in school and say nope i ain't gonna do that nope i ain't gonna do that because if i do that now what after you smoke some weed now what after you need a boyfriend now what have you have sex for the first time now what there's always going to be a question based upon what you do but if it's something spiritual but if it's something of god god will always direct the what and the what won't condemn you but the what will take you higher in god [Music] i love that song i'm no longer a slave to sin but i am a child of god holly you have chosen me from my mother's womb your blood hallelujah runs warm through my veins hallelujah [Applause] young people i want you to understand something god got a humble of me hallelujah in such a way when i was 15 years old whether i had the holy ghost or not i'd never be able to deny that he's real hallelujah like i said he healed me from cancer in my brain hallelujah with no radiation no chemo treatment nothing else they had to offer you know what it was it was isaiah 53. god has to deny what you know deny what was he's healed now what he's going to live by that healing entire testimony for the rest of his life by the way i just went to the doctor again and every year we fight about this holly i just went to the doctor again and they said hey mr deez you got diabetes i say no i don't hey man you know they think i'm crazy like some of you do no i ain't crazy i'm just free i'm free to believe in the word of god no matter what the instrument might say god says by your stripes i'm healed holly and this ain't the first time this is probably the fourth time they tried to give it to me so you got that beat i said no i don't well yeah you ain't got a lot of sugar well i'm sweet i supposed to have some sugar in me ain't nothing sour about my experience god has been good to me i ain't got time to be walking around with my head down talking about what i'm going to do i'm going to serve god that's the conclusion of my life young people let that be the conclusion of your life hallelujah because let me tell you something the temptation you're going through somebody's already defeated it that's right they say well mr d's we gonna we uh uh uh um your diabetes you just and i let them talk i said i got a diabetes come on man young doctor you know fresh out of school i hate the buses

believe the scripture believe the scripture no matter what the devil says believe the scripture and some of you going through things right now let me give you a scripture the bible says with every temptation god has made no matter what you're going through god has made a way of escape hollywood maybe it's a young man at school and you're looking at him he's tall dark and handsome let me tell you something god can help you escape that hallelujah if you really show him that you mean business he can make help you escape that it's his word god is obligated to his word and young men if you

was time for me to preach that night i felt 100 good [Applause] the only thing sickness can do is what you allow it to do the only thing a child can do is what you allow it to do you know like i said they hooked me back up hallelujah to the same machine that said negative let's say it positive got to working again then the nurse looked at me after the test was always she said oh my god you don't have high blood i said i told you i went back round there to the doctor signed my paperwork and i jumped in my closet god you so powerful you made an instrument that has no ears that has no mouth that has no mind to hear what i'm saying obey my confession [Applause] the words out of our mouth are gonna crank up dead engines gonna create limbs [Applause] i'm sorry i know it's supposed to be for young people young people i want you to believe that god is real you say now what the conclusion of the whole matter is to believe god church look after this last time to do what time it is okay okay all right last time this this doctor this fresh meat he a fresh meat he didn't know what he was getting into he's gonna challenge everything he's been taught holly come on we got it he said well miss d we can't find it everything good i'm standing there like yeah i know with a smile i wouldn't be an arrogant i'm like yeah okay i appreciate you he says okay i'm saying people worry signing paperwork and you know this he's signing paperwork it's supposed to be for two years so it's supposed to be 20 24. he put 20 32. [Applause] so if i got to go through a trial it won't be in two years hallelujah the rapture might take the place before i had to go through this again hallelujah so i say to you young people when you believe in god god will take care of the now what yes sir i called my brother cause he was a truck driver too hey bro check this out i just got a d.o.t exam and the man gave me 10 years we laugh and laugh at last but god is in control young people god is in control if you're going through something right now it's because god wants to strengthen you let me get out of here church i'm not a long-winded preacher i believe in hitting the point getting to it and moving out of the way because you necessarily got to preach 45 minutes when you catch it that's good enough oh look remember the woman at the well jesus probably spoke down 15 minutes dealt with us talking to a little bit look at the conversation he's talking to a little bit she going back like a version he probably said he was contacting the spirit hallelujah once he got that he dealt with her sin he shined the light on the problem hallelujah hey man you have five of us and the one you got in charge and jesus was saying here i am let me complete you here i am hallelujah next thing you know she running down there come see a man who told me all things so don't get in your head i got to read 20 quotes and and and go back and forth up and down the bible now will you believe operating your faith i can't understand why we don't have a hallelujah running through the church hallelujah is the highest praise if you want something from god it's two words you got to have in your vocabulary in church just two words hallelujah you ain't got to be able to break the seals down all you know it's two words that get god's attention one is hallelujah and the one that really makes him back up is amen [Music] [Applause] [Applause] did you just hear them say so be it devil get out the way when you say amen make god stand up cause you know he's sitting on the throne but when you say amen he get up you said that hallelujah all hannah wright said was that ain't nothing but the truth god said give him whatever she asked for right now [Applause] and y'all sitting in here and don't want god to move amen we'll make him move here it's it's just crazy to me people come to church they know the word the word has been preaching it down for 45 minutes amen because the word is true [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah even if it's somebody else's testimony i will still say amen cause i believe he can do the same thing for me hallelujah oh my god let me get out of here church back to solomon something you know i got testimonies for days that was saying don't like me each other people you know you'd be doing me going to god just like you know in the bible you got to find the parallel of your life remember remember the the woman in memphis tennessee she said eyes just like that shooting and since i'm just like that shoot i'm like where's my light since she found her place in the scripture but you know what everybody want to be in abraham or or a paw hunter they won't they want demonstration in it like i want to be a peter or something like no i realize i'm joke i'm joke i'll be going through things that there's no explanation the only explanation is god is saying to the devil watch it ain't gonna quit his friends go forsake him but he ain't gonna quit hallelujah hey man they're gonna talk about his family but he ain't gonna quit hallelujah he's gonna look like he's calling in anointing no more but he gonna quit god is saying i got somebody on the earth who still will believe through everything that's right and maybe some of you girls are sarah hallelujah when it looks like you're not able to bring forth life god said it at a point in time it's going to come forward maybe some of you young girls are ruth when they're just standing around nothing but death god will lead you to your boy ass [Applause] maybe some of you young girls all right esther hallelujah when all the rest of them are getting tatted up getting earrings and nails and all these other things done after saying i come as i am because i'm the queen i've been chosen out in the queen i've come to replace somebody i'm the replacement see i keep coming over here because these three girls right here they pull it y'all might not see it but they pulling holly on the inside is something connecting hallelujah don't get it twisted everybody gotta be ah no sometimes just there y'all don't see what i see i got to be careful you might do that the bible says welling and gnashing your teeth hallelujah we're going to spiritually grab only god church look brother everything solomon did was through wisdom but let's look at it we're going to hit this thought now what are we going to get out of the way hallelujah look the bible says back in ecclesiastes the first chapter i don't know if y'all putting that up there but if you can it will be a blessing because i like to show the people that what i'm saying is not brother dee's thoughts what i'm saying is two places i'm pulling from i'm pulling from the scripture or i'm pulling from the prophet's message and the prophet's message if you really understand it's the scripture they are one entity they're not two yeah that's right hallelujah god clearly said this is not bro this is not william branham just like every other prophet said paul was saying it's not high but it's the law follow me as i follow christ isaiah said hallelujah who will you sin lord he say lord send me hallelujah god told moses i've heard the cry of my people and now moses i've come down what was god in moses it's not two different entities it's one when god comes on the scene hallelujah that's why we don't look at ourselves as us and god no it's one entity he said i am my people are one hallelujah but i feel the holy ghost moving up in here i feel the powers of deliverance in this place some some young people some people have these young people today after the service they're going to walk out of here like a rooster y'all know what the rooster does he controls the whole yard i know you want to get an amber dude i'm an ego right now we talking about a rooster we talk about what he eat we talking about his character you know all the women walk around he runs around like he running the yard anybody else coming at y'all he stick his chest out and he runs to it cause he's controlling the yard and i know some of you young people if you catch it today you can walk out of here with your chest huh believe in god tell the devil i ain't got to be subject to that i'm a child of god hallelujah stay away from them because you see because i know the life of job i know that some of my friends who say they were friends ain't really friends as soon as i go through something that they can't explain i told you told you he was just he was that but that's a part of it amen i can't get mad at them they can't see what i see you know there were people traveling with paul they couldn't see what paul saw hallelujah he said some sort of liberal didn't hear the voice someone heard the voice but didn't see the light hallelujah but did that change how god thought about paul yes sir see so you can't get caught up in friendship and all that stuff no find your place in god listen everybody all right y'all know i'm about to close right now see i say that because the words got power y'all know about the clothes got power let me say it again i'm about to close i got

somebody else's cup got too if your cup is not running over in god that means you drink it from somebody else i said boy that's heavy right there i don't know about y'all but my cup running over god

chapter 12. i want you to leave this up there while i finish up chapter 12 verse 11. now i'm gonna read you something look listen to me good young people this is the prophet saying in in in the message come follow me he says you make yourself when you're young you set your ambitions to what you want to be and what you're trying to achieve in life you think of it and and as you think of course your mind it presents into your mind by an unknown something that dominates your mind as you're thinking on it there's an unknown something that dominates your thoughts to get you to believe you can be what you're thinking he says and then when it becomes in your mind then you speak it that you're going to do that and then your ambitions drive you to it you make yourself when you're young you hit people football players basketball players here all the time they say i just knew i was going to the nfl i just knew i just knew i was going to be the greatest player ever i just knew i was gonna be the best singer i just knew i was gonna be a rapper see their ambitions drove them to that they got that in their spirit when they were young and they set their eyes to meet that goal when they were young and i'm saying to you you can do the same thing in god hallelujah you can set your goals to be a godly woman you can set your goals to be a godly man get it in your mind to get on the word and you will become your thoughts come on musicians i'm closing look before musicians come let's read it one more time all together now what after all that now what after all of these solomon did now what right i'ma tell you what then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labor that i had labored to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no prophet under the sun next verse and i turned myself know that what i want 12. i want chapter 12. ecclesiastes 12 and 12 and 11. in the words of the wise uh are as goals and as nails fastened by the master of assemblies which are given from one shepherd let's go and further by these my sons be admonished of making many books there is no end and much studies weariness of the flesh let's go let us

everything that he thought was going to give him real joy now let's hear the conclusion let's hear the now what from solomon the wisest man upon the earth who was it being tricked he knew full well

back to us you say brother i wish i lived in paris the city of romance is still going to come back to us [Applause] i wish i could marry an italian man it's still going to come back to this let's hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man everybody in here meets this requirement amen next verse for god shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good god is gonna judge your good so you might have some worldly family members some worldly friends come on musicians some worldly family members

feeling in their heart about to meet god they money don't mean that they press these don't mean that it brings them all back to this now what and you know what they start doing they be trying to make everything right then in the last moments of their life they'd be trying to clear up their mistakes and give their children money in the wheel and you know and bless their wife and even some of them give half of that money to the church i know a church in florida one of one of my friends to work at i think when somebody died he gave that church 25 million dollars because he came back to now what
