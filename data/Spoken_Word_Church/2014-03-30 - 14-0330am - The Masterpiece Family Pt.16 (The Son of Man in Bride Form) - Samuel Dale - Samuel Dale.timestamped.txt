[9:14] everything would be okay we love you and
[9:16] we thank you but God each one as we read
[9:19] your words you come and bless us
[9:21] together in that Grace in Jesus name
[9:23] amen
[9:25] Matthew 16. good to have her not a
[9:29] visitor she's been here many times
[9:31] before
[9:32] she's an alabamian but some way she got
[9:34] over here on 20 I guess and was able to
[9:37] come and visit with us but good to see
[9:39] you Matthew 16.
[9:42] and when Jesus came into the coast of
[9:44] caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples
[9:46] saying whom do men say that I the son of
[9:49] man I am
[9:51] and they said some say that thou art
[9:53] John the Baptist whom Elijah and others
[9:55] Jeremiah are one of the prophets
[9:58] now he made it personal see then he
[10:00] saith unto them but whom say ye that I
[10:03] am so evidently pointed to Peter you
[10:06] know or something in doing it
[10:08] and Simon Peter answered and said dark
[10:10] to Christ the son of the Living God and
[10:12] Jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[10:14] art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and
[10:16] Blood hath not revealed it unto thee but
[10:19] my Father which is in heaven and I say
[10:21] unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon
[10:24] This Rock I'll build my church and the
[10:26] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[10:29] it and I will give unto thee the Keys of
[10:33] the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever
[10:35] Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound
[10:37] in heaven and whatsoever thy shalt loose
[10:40] on Earth shall be loosed in heaven all
[10:44] right now let's go over to Psalms
[10:49] we'll go to chapter 8. verse 4.
[10:54] notice the reading now
[10:57] what is man
[10:58] the dark mindful of him
[11:01] and the son of man that thou visits him
[11:03] now we know that happened right all
[11:06] right for thou has made him a little
[11:09] lower than the angel who the son of man
[11:11] okay
[11:12] and has crowned him with Glory and Honor
[11:15] now watch Thou made us hymn to have
[11:18] dominion over the works of thy hands
[11:22] thou Hast put all things under his feet
[11:25] all sheep and oxen yea and the Beast of
[11:28] the field and the fowl of the hour and
[11:31] the fish of the sea and whatsoever
[11:34] passes through the paths of the sea all
[11:37] right so we could easily read then
[11:40] uh Genesis 1 26 and 27 couldn't we
[11:44] because that would relate to the man
[11:46] that he made and the son of man then
[11:49] come into that so you may be seated the
[11:51] Lord had his Blessing to the reading of
[11:54] the word now we have some
[11:56] quotes for today
[11:57] yeah they're different these are
[12:00] a separate ones sold out to me we uh
[12:05] kind of want you to uh
[12:07] you know to read these things and store
[12:10] these away because it saves you a lot of
[12:12] trouble
[12:12] uh we went through the series on the
[12:16] um the corn of wheat dying falling into
[12:19] the ground you know and gave you those
[12:21] quotes and we went through then the the
[12:24] prophet saying that the bride would be
[12:25] the fullness or the godhead bodily so we
[12:28] gave you those and then if somebody
[12:29] comes along and says well we hear y'all
[12:31] believe so and so so we're here and it's
[12:33] red
[12:34] now we're talking about and we've been
[12:35] talking about uh last Sunday in the
[12:39] services we talked about the son of man
[12:42] and in that then we gave you a lot of
[12:46] quotes
[12:48] well if you take these and keep them you
[12:50] know then like I say you don't have to I
[12:53] put things in my Bible carrying case
[12:55] that if something comes up and somebody
[12:58] said something well I just
[13:00] roll in there and said well here read it
[13:02] you know and because my memories not
[13:05] that excellent so you know I can can do
[13:08] it that away a whole lot quicker what do
[13:11] they say the shortest pin is greater
[13:13] than the longest memory or something
[13:14] like that you know and uh so then we uh
[13:18] we appreciate the ability to be able to
[13:21] to do that
[13:23] no
[13:25] we spoke this past Sunday and dealt with
[13:28] the son of man
[13:30] all right and I pray that that would
[13:33] that helped you to understand and we
[13:36] will re-quote some things through the
[13:38] service today and if I can get through
[13:41] this afternoon uh then the Lord
[13:44] willingness coming Wednesday we will
[13:46] have questions and answers comments Etc
[13:49] uh I may try to if I get through today I
[13:53] may try Wednesday to just give you an
[13:55] overview of the whole thing all at one
[13:57] you know and gets our minds into the
[14:00] channel and then we can have the uh the
[14:03] questions and answers and comments
[14:05] because I appreciate your comments and
[14:07] and doing and you know uh because I
[14:12] don't give everything because there's no
[14:14] way to do it we we you know we never get
[14:16] through
[14:17] but
[14:18] I
[14:20] this morning sometimes I've got to
[14:22] thinking about
[14:26] and what I was thinking about was Paul
[14:28] in his statement when he said to let her
[14:30] killeth
[14:31] what the spirit giveth life
[14:34] all right and you know that really we
[14:36] create
[14:38] life or death
[14:41] by our words
[14:43] we create life or death
[14:47] by our very words that we use
[14:49] now the word create there is not meaning
[14:52] that we're so powerful of what we do we
[14:54] just it's what we are and what's taking
[14:57] place see death is actually
[15:01] perverting
[15:02] the word
[15:04] all right so then the word we use that's
[15:07] why we should be so careful in the the
[15:10] word
[15:11] in everything of trying to bring it
[15:13] because the word that we uh you know
[15:17] cherishing things we can take that and
[15:20] we can create with it are we you know
[15:22] either good or evil in our own selves
[15:24] and and that way you know I won't
[15:28] explain all of the other of what it was
[15:30] because it was related to a dream that I
[15:32] was having about something and I saw
[15:35] that we can take the word and we can
[15:38] destroy with it
[15:40] or we can take the word and we can exalt
[15:43] with it so that's one thing for sure
[15:45] that I want to do is try to exalt the
[15:48] Lord Jesus Christ because that's that's
[15:51] our purpose all right but
[15:55] think about it now
[15:59] we've been studying in the Book of
[16:01] Revelations Revelations 1.
[16:04] and uh getting that out of the the way
[16:08] of understanding and talking about that
[16:12] where it says on Revelations 1 12 and 13
[16:14] you know did he uh he turned to see The
[16:17] Voice
[16:19] and when he turned to see The Voice
[16:22] then he saw one standing in the midst of
[16:25] the seven golden candlesticks like unto
[16:27] the son of man
[16:29] it didn't say it was the son of man it
[16:31] was it was like unto the son of man
[16:34] all right and then that meaning that
[16:37] it's the son of man in another form when
[16:41] you're using the word lightness I went
[16:43] through all of that you know then it's
[16:45] it's the son of man in another form
[16:48] all right and that being the form it's
[16:51] in what it's in Bride form the prophet
[16:54] called it
[16:55] all right trying to find the day that
[16:59] we're living
[17:01] now this seems to in other words when I
[17:04] bring that out and try to express a
[17:06] little about undoing I'm maybe it's just
[17:09] me but I feel a pullback
[17:12] uh you know from you of what I'm trying
[17:17] to do
[17:18] and and I don't understand why you would
[17:22] do that because
[17:24] um every age
[17:26] the prophet said and I've got these
[17:28] laying here if you want them every age
[17:31] there's been a word for that age but
[17:34] there's been a prophet to bring the word
[17:36] of that age
[17:38] all right but there's been a people to
[17:41] make alive the word of that age brother
[17:43] random calls Martin Luther a prophet
[17:45] because he was a church-aged messenger
[17:47] all right now he wasn't a prophet like
[17:51] brother Brown no he wasn't a prophet
[17:54] like Paul Etc maybe but yet he was
[17:57] called a prophet you know I got in
[17:59] trouble trying to explain that one time
[18:01] but I can't help it run around and said
[18:03] it and I believe it that he was more
[18:05] than just a a FireFold Ministry man
[18:08] Martin Luther he was a church messenger
[18:11] he was an angel of that age all right
[18:14] but it wasn't and I said Luther that
[18:17] you know
[18:19] challenging the Catholic Church on a
[18:21] doctrinal issue
[18:22] that wasn't the problem of the day
[18:25] you know in what was going on it's when
[18:27] the people
[18:29] begin to believe
[18:31] what Martin Luther was teaching contrary
[18:34] to the Catholic church and what they had
[18:37] all been taught all right then they
[18:39] began to make manifest what Martin
[18:41] Luther was saying all right the church
[18:43] got upset
[18:45] why because they begin to lose people
[18:48] all right but that was the word of that
[18:51] age
[18:52] Moses was the word of his age right
[18:56] there's always been somebody
[19:00] a prophet brought
[19:02] and we believe that God sent us a
[19:04] prophet here in the last days we thank
[19:05] God for it
[19:07] and but now the point is if there was a
[19:11] prophet sent then there is a message to
[19:16] be made Alive by someone
[19:20] and it's not just that God sent a
[19:23] prophet God sent a prophet and and
[19:25] that's all we believe God sent a prophet
[19:27] all right amen we believe that
[19:30] right but it's when the people
[19:33] begin to say his brother around and said
[19:36] what when you begin to say I and my
[19:38] father won
[19:39] he said the shot's going to pull away
[19:42] when you begin to say we believe that
[19:45] God sent us a prophet in the last days
[19:47] and thank God but we believe that
[19:50] somebody's got to make manifest that
[19:53] word that he brought
[19:55] because that's what he was pointing to
[19:58] spoken words original seat said he'd be
[20:00] pointing to a word born bride
[20:03] all right see then that way then we
[20:06] believe and thank God for the the word
[20:09] that's been brought to us amen because
[20:11] we be junk without it that's just that's
[20:14] my common way of saying it we wouldn't
[20:16] be anything
[20:17] and we believe that God sent that
[20:19] prophet and he sent it to he'd send a
[20:21] prophet to every age
[20:24] now Moses was the prophet right
[20:27] but what was the point of being why did
[20:31] he send a prophet
[20:32] to lead the people out of Egypt right
[20:36] and take them to the promised land all
[20:38] right
[20:39] so Moses had his place his position but
[20:42] once the people got there
[20:45] to show the point of what I'm getting at
[20:48] Moses couldn't take him into the land
[20:52] right
[20:54] you had to raise up with Joshua from
[20:57] among them that had been in the service
[20:59] with Moses the whole time read your
[21:02] Bible
[21:03] Moses was right I mean Joshua was in the
[21:06] temple when they dedicated he was in
[21:08] there doing all of this that and the
[21:09] other all the things he was right there
[21:11] with Moses the whole time all right
[21:14] and when it did somebody had to take him
[21:17] over all right we know that Joshua
[21:19] represents who the Holy Spirit right
[21:24] all right
[21:25] see no man could take you in because
[21:29] you know
[21:30] right all that man can do is point you
[21:32] toward
[21:34] s right he can't take you into the land
[21:36] so there had to be a Joshua come up
[21:39] to represent the holy spirit that would
[21:40] take the people in all right so has it
[21:44] been in every age
[21:46] we just lose use Luther because
[21:49] everybody wants to well Luther ain't
[21:50] worth nothing you know there was nothing
[21:53] down through there well
[21:55] like I said you explain what the Bible
[21:58] says that God stood in the midst and you
[22:01] count your church ages and see where
[22:04] Luther name was at
[22:06] so if you want to make you know
[22:07] carnality out of it then he'd be greater
[22:09] back there than he is now
[22:11] see but see that's just a point of
[22:14] interest to you but yet to see that the
[22:17] word of each age
[22:18] has got to be made Alive by somebody
[22:23] Schumer brother random stirred up the
[22:26] world religious system yes he did
[22:31] but now suppose I'm just giving you an
[22:34] example because this is what came to me
[22:36] and I I just pulled the notes off while
[22:38] ago and looked at it
[22:39] six times brother random says that
[22:42] there's a word for each age just that
[22:45] wording just word for each age all right
[22:48] a portion of the word and a prophet to
[22:51] to bring the word that the people can
[22:53] become the word all right now it's not
[22:56] in your notes because I didn't give it
[22:57] to you okay
[22:59] but see
[23:02] where you and I are at then
[23:05] well we're just sitting down waiting you
[23:07] know just kind of waiting on something
[23:09] to happen well what's going to happen
[23:11] that's right
[23:13] but
[23:15] the prophet said win the Bride come on
[23:18] realizes who she is
[23:21] and what she's here for
[23:23] Satan's gonna get all upset
[23:27] well 40 something years now folks
[23:30] it's about time we're starting to
[23:32] realizing
[23:33] us don't explain you could take the
[23:35] whole message and put it on the internet
[23:38] around the world which is and on every
[23:41] radio station around the world and run
[23:43] it 24 hours a day
[23:47] did you start picking it apart because
[23:49] that's what they're doing
[23:52] right but when the people
[23:54] starts believing it
[23:58] you remember
[24:01] when they went to went overseas to the
[24:03] guy to find out where the Revival was
[24:04] you know and the police officer was
[24:06] standing there you know
[24:07] we want to know where the Welch Revival
[24:09] everybody was and he says you're looking
[24:11] at it
[24:14] all right when we begin to realize Who
[24:17] We Are
[24:18] we don't have to run out
[24:20] we're not going to empty hospitals we're
[24:22] not going to do all kind of thing
[24:24] because that's not in the line for today
[24:27] all right
[24:29] but we're going to have to be what he
[24:31] taught
[24:33] not just talk about it
[24:37] that's right but to be it
[24:41] we don't have any problems associating
[24:44] with the message do we
[24:48] all right I mean do you back up when
[24:49] somebody said what do you believe well
[24:50] you know I'm kind of a I kind of work
[24:52] anyway no uh and I don't land by action
[24:56] holler and scream you know he said what
[24:58] do you believe I believe that
[25:00] God sent a prophet for this day
[25:04] what yes you believe Luther come don't
[25:07] you you believe Wesley come don't you
[25:09] you'll be the Baptist come by
[25:12] John Smith or whatever
[25:14] well then I just believe that God sent a
[25:17] prophet
[25:19] amen all right but see somebody now has
[25:22] got to make the word alive
[25:24] not just talk about it
[25:28] not even just say well we're in the
[25:30] message
[25:32] but to just become the message
[25:35] and as I said we're not going to empty
[25:36] hospitals
[25:38] no but it don't mean we can't go in
[25:40] there and empty some rooms
[25:43] right it don't mean we can't pray for
[25:46] the sick
[25:49] because we believe it we believe in
[25:51] what's being happening
[25:54] all right but you get what I'm driving
[25:56] at
[25:57] and I've always taught you how long has
[25:59] it been I've taught this to you
[26:02] that in the Book of Revelations the book
[26:04] that they told us to stay out of because
[26:06] we could not understand it is the very
[26:08] book that we find ourselves in the most
[26:13] right because you never find Jesus in
[26:16] The Book of Revelation by himself
[26:20] he's always with somebody in somebody
[26:25] delivering and doing
[26:27] all right see that that's all I've tried
[26:30] to teach
[26:32] that's all I've done for 40 something
[26:33] years and just try to if you and I to
[26:36] realize
[26:37] the day and the hour that we're living
[26:40] and to recognize your day in this
[26:43] message
[26:44] amen we've got the quotes
[26:47] we've got the prophet's message all
[26:50] right but what about recognizing Who We
[26:52] Are
[26:58] I won't say it so you may not like it
[27:00] but even the ones that believe brother
[27:02] Brown was deity sometimes a whole lot
[27:04] stronger than you and I are about the
[27:06] word
[27:09] come on right even them that believe the
[27:12] falsies that they claim about his
[27:14] message they're out doing things
[27:18] you know
[27:20] I mean there's going overseas they're
[27:22] sending out all kinds of things and then
[27:24] turn around and tell you they didn't
[27:25] believe all he talked but at least
[27:27] they're doing something
[27:29] instead of just well I believe the
[27:31] message now
[27:33] all right
[27:35] but listen folks
[27:38] we talked about last Sunday
[27:42] as the son of man we'll get back to this
[27:45] in a little bit we'll run around and
[27:46] says I am not the son of man
[27:50] he said Jesus is the son of man the Son
[27:54] of God the son of David
[28:00] and even in my teaching if you'll watch
[28:03] it what I'm trying to hold it
[28:06] I never declared that you and I as the
[28:09] bride of Christ would be the son of
[28:10] David
[28:11] because that's the wrong dispensation
[28:13] wrong time
[28:16] that's the Millennium in the things
[28:20] but just trying to recognize the day
[28:23] that we're living
[28:26] and realize that we
[28:29] have to become the word
[28:32] and to become the word then
[28:36] Luther was the word made flesh for the
[28:39] day he was in
[28:40] the people that really believe that not
[28:43] the fanaticism
[28:44] but the real true Lutheran
[28:47] they were the word made flesh of that
[28:49] day
[28:53] well that's all I'm talking about you're
[28:54] an opinion
[28:56] if you want to know what I'm teaching
[28:58] that's what I'm telling I'm just trying
[28:59] to get you and I to realize who we are
[29:01] and what's going on
[29:04] because nobody has ever been worth
[29:06] anything in the Bible until they realize
[29:08] what was going on
[29:10] right
[29:13] right the best Moses could do would
[29:16] 16 years or 20 years or whatever he was
[29:19] with his mama and her saying you're not
[29:25] that is that Egyptian Pharaoh's son
[29:30] you're a Jew
[29:33] you know and you're chosen for a special
[29:35] job
[29:36] which you know that didn't do him no
[29:38] good got him a dead Egyptian
[29:40] right
[29:43] but five minutes in front of the burning
[29:46] bush the prophet said
[29:48] meant more than all the years of his
[29:50] teaching
[29:53] I become personal unto him
[29:57] he wasn't afraid
[29:59] I mean come on you know yourself you're
[30:01] going to the movies to make the movie to
[30:03] make it look good but you know yourself
[30:05] that I told him not to come back to
[30:07] Egypt
[30:08] you know that because they really didn't
[30:10] figure he'd live you know when they sent
[30:12] him in the desert
[30:14] which you know they told him not to come
[30:16] back
[30:17] well you know for 40 years he didn't go
[30:19] back
[30:20] all a mom was teaching couldn't put him
[30:22] back
[30:24] the five minutes of that burning bush
[30:28] he goes home tell his wife get ready
[30:32] we're going we're going to Egypt
[30:35] we're going to take over
[30:37] I imagine she probably the poorer I
[30:40] remember
[30:41] she probably fussed with him a whole lot
[30:44] you know on the way
[30:46] but you know what it happened he went
[30:48] down took over
[30:51] but now get down to the point
[30:55] was it Moses they was scared of
[31:01] sure the stick the different things but
[31:04] they they
[31:06] manufactured them things
[31:09] you remember they could do everything
[31:10] Moses done except take away
[31:17] but when the people begin to Rally
[31:19] around a message that Moses was bringing
[31:23] the Egyptians got concerned
[31:28] that's all I want you and I to see
[31:32] we find our place in the word
[31:35] all right
[31:36] The Book of Revelations is where you're
[31:38] going to find yourself
[31:40] because somebody else has already made
[31:42] all these others manifest
[31:46] but they never made the things that's in
[31:48] the Book of Revelations manifest
[31:51] sure they're a part of it
[31:53] I've talked to you that away we don't
[31:54] teach the son of manage just to be the
[31:56] end time people
[31:58] it's a bride down to all the ages
[32:01] because it's one like another son of man
[32:03] is shown standing in the midst of the
[32:04] seven golden candles Revelation 1 13.
[32:07] amen
[32:08] amen all right
[32:11] they were the word for their hour but
[32:13] what are we to be the word of the hour
[32:17] there's a talk she's been trying to just
[32:19] review just a point
[32:22] in the Book of Revelations you don't see
[32:25] him as a physical being
[32:30] right
[32:33] he's always in a symbolics
[32:37] right
[32:39] You Don't See
[32:40] John didn't turn to see the son of man
[32:43] standing there the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:47] but he turned to see The Voice
[32:50] now he was expecting to see Jesus when
[32:53] he turned
[32:55] I imagine it was a little shock to him
[32:58] he wrote the symbol he knew what it was
[33:01] he knew that voice
[33:04] so then when that voice spoke from that
[33:07] seven golden candlesticks he knew
[33:10] you know what was going on that was not
[33:12] a physical Corporal standing it was a
[33:14] symbolic form
[33:16] but as we'll try to get to today now we
[33:19] talk about the son of man last Sunday
[33:20] but they will talk about the son of man
[33:23] in Bride form
[33:28] in the form of the word
[33:31] the message that you and I have received
[33:35] as I've said to you for 40 something
[33:37] years
[33:39] Paul and them didn't I keep saying that
[33:41] for you to think about it Paul and them
[33:43] didn't speak of Son of Man
[33:48] no
[33:49] but as quick as running around and
[33:50] started
[33:52] in the 40s he he was talking about the
[33:55] son of man
[33:58] all right
[34:01] being revealed
[34:03] of course everybody you know there he is
[34:07] we've seen it then but we don't see
[34:09] nothing now
[34:10] you know we're just waiting around until
[34:12] Obama takes over Earl Hootie comes after
[34:15] or what's what's the Palin and what's
[34:18] the girl woman's name
[34:22] Hillary
[34:23] maybe when Hillary and Palin takes over
[34:26] and we get a new profile
[34:28] stage
[34:30] boy we're going to heaven then
[34:32] like I told him in a fellowship meeting
[34:34] if we don't hurry up and do something
[34:35] we're going to be having Fellowship
[34:37] meetings or services in the nursing home
[34:41] right
[34:43] because it's going to be more of us dire
[34:45] than they are here
[34:51] but that'd be great
[34:55] wouldn't it be great to be sitting in a
[34:57] nursing home
[34:59] what are we going to do tomorrow we're
[35:00] going to talk about the message
[35:03] what are we going to do the next day
[35:05] we're going to talk about the message
[35:06] and you know what we'll all have such a
[35:09] problem of memory do we won't remember
[35:11] we talked about it today before
[35:14] right
[35:15] I mean I'm honest come on
[35:21] do you think about it see I don't have
[35:23] nothing but this message I mean that's
[35:24] all I've got
[35:26] you know
[35:28] but think about it now
[35:33] that was in while we're not a
[35:35] denomination where brother Brown said he
[35:37] turned to see The Voice
[35:39] he said it was a bride standing
[35:42] right there
[35:43] a bride
[35:46] right
[35:47] all right
[35:49] but then he went into the seventh the uh
[35:52] seven Church ages It Was Written you
[35:54] know 54 now
[35:55] 412 I think it is
[35:58] where he saw not a man but he saw a
[36:02] woman
[36:03] or about to perhaps
[36:09] feminish
[36:11] bride form
[36:14] a bride's standing there
[36:16] are
[36:18] standing in the Mist
[36:20] see who is this the prophesive
[36:23] his bride
[36:25] huh he lived through the church ages as
[36:28] Son of God
[36:30] but then he's to be revealed in the last
[36:32] days of the son of man the word made
[36:34] flesh we went through those things right
[36:37] now but look let's make sure because I
[36:40] don't want you to misunderstand me but I
[36:42] don't want to harp to death about
[36:43] something
[36:44] but you know I'll sit down with people
[36:46] and they'll start talking they'll say I
[36:49] didn't see that till you went over it
[36:51] well maybe that's a problem with my
[36:54] memory I don't remember what I preached
[36:55] so I preach it over again
[36:57] so that's all right we get in a nursing
[36:59] home we went on no problem
[37:01] you know all right but they won't have
[37:03] to give us a bunch of pills
[37:05] because we'll be peeled upon the word
[37:07] but now come on folks 1969 in Athens
[37:11] Georgia I tried my best to explain that
[37:14] the bride by the quotes of the Prophet
[37:16] would be the son of man
[37:20] in the last days
[37:23] all right
[37:24] you know how hard it was then to say it
[37:26] because that voice well he's missed a
[37:29] brother Branham was the son of man
[37:32] I gave the quote just like I give them
[37:34] to you the other day
[37:35] questions and answers from 64. he said I
[37:39] am not the son of man
[37:41] I am not the son of man
[37:44] but a son of man
[37:47] he said there's quite a difference
[37:51] now remember what it was shown in the we
[37:54] gave the quotes the other day where in
[37:55] Revelation 1 13 and we're going on down
[37:58] brother Branham says this is not a
[38:00] prophet
[38:02] this is God
[38:05] all right
[38:07] see a prophet can can represent us John
[38:10] represented us on Patmos as being raised
[38:12] up yes
[38:14] but there has to be a people follow that
[38:16] one day
[38:18] all right
[38:21] what you see
[38:22] it comes down then to the point of where
[38:24] he's saying I'm not the son of man
[38:28] we went on into and we've been through
[38:30] it on anointed ones at the end times
[38:32] they want to throw these up pick up
[38:33] number two where you can read some of
[38:35] them if you don't you got the notes
[38:36] laying there and they got them on the
[38:37] Internet
[38:38] in the very day there's a son of man is
[38:40] revealed Revelations 10 1-7
[38:43] read it when you get home the seventh
[38:46] Angels message opening up the seals what
[38:49] is it not the angel is the son of man
[38:54] but the messenger is revealing the son
[38:57] of man can you get it separated now he
[39:00] says
[39:04] that's where it seems to be so hard for
[39:06] you
[39:07] you see not the son of man himself
[39:11] but the seventh angel
[39:13] the seventh messenger is revealing to
[39:16] the public the son of man because it's
[39:18] left to shook
[39:20] Now where's that at all of the message
[39:22] about the grain the corn of Wheat and
[39:24] the son of man is to return in the last
[39:26] days all right
[39:28] and it's the grain itself again but here
[39:32] we go
[39:34] that's what I said that that blank stain
[39:36] hits me when I get there and maybe it's
[39:39] blank me instead of blank you but
[39:41] I just don't see nothing going on
[39:47] and we believe we was that we would we
[39:49] would be seeing however kind of signed
[39:51] and wonder I believe we are around the
[39:54] world
[39:55] and then you want to argue with a little
[39:57] little about it because we can produce
[39:59] the tapes even from years ago where the
[40:03] Dead's been raised the six been healed
[40:04] storms just went out of existence rain
[40:07] has come when it hadn't rained how many
[40:09] more things can we go to
[40:11] but I don't see nothing going on
[40:15] well it's not going to change anybody
[40:18] but you see Church
[40:20] he goes on to say on the mark of the
[40:22] beast in 61. see that goes up 65 back
[40:25] 61.
[40:27] the angel of the Lord set with his back
[40:29] turned now now I hope you
[40:33] I hope you all get this I am not the
[40:37] angel of the Lord
[40:38] I'm William Branham
[40:42] right
[40:44] now what's he talking about he wasn't
[40:46] denying denying that he was the seventh
[40:48] Church age messenger was he wasn't
[40:50] denying that he was the angel of the
[40:52] Lord to say he's talking about that
[40:54] angel
[40:57] I'm not that I
[41:00] I'm William Branham I'm not that angel
[41:03] what'd he say he said I just wanted to
[41:05] use this
[41:06] right
[41:07] that angel is the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:11] and the Lord Jesus Christ is the son of
[41:13] man
[41:18] when are we going to get it down to
[41:20] where we can lay it in order
[41:23] and say this is what we believe
[41:28] you know what we can't make it manifest
[41:31] do what you want to you can't manifest
[41:33] nothing I can't either
[41:39] if God used you to call life back it
[41:42] wasn't you
[41:44] it was God
[41:46] same ways right over here in the church
[41:48] right beside of us today
[41:50] if something happens over there it's God
[41:55] right
[41:56] see that's the way it's supposed to be
[41:58] all right but now listen
[42:01] look what he says when we get over to
[42:03] the in order to end time paragraph 26.9
[42:05] number four on the notes and we'll
[42:08] we'll start from this point and then
[42:09] we'll
[42:10] we'll try to move on this is
[42:13] paragraph 269.
[42:16] he's talking about trying to come down
[42:18] about myself you know see
[42:21] he said you know people think he's
[42:22] talking about himself
[42:25] when he said and I was listening to him
[42:27] last night
[42:28] and he said
[42:30] there's a man back here behind me
[42:35] he said his name is so-and-so
[42:40] wonderful it happened right we believe
[42:42] it
[42:44] but that wasn't him
[42:48] that wasn't brought around him
[42:51] well he's describing the son of man was
[42:53] and he said he wasn't the son of man
[42:58] the son of man's the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:02] well now there you are trying to make
[43:04] the bride no if he becomes one with the
[43:07] bride
[43:08] he's making himself
[43:10] right
[43:12] come on that's all I'm talking about
[43:14] being that I was packing the message I
[43:17] have no more to do with it then nothing
[43:19] no more than just a voice and my voice
[43:22] even against my better judgment
[43:25] I wanted to be a Trapper
[43:27] but it's the will of my father that I
[43:29] declared to that I declare to do and
[43:32] determine to do
[43:34] I wasn't the one that appeared down on
[43:36] the river I was only standing there when
[43:38] he appeared I'm not the one that
[43:41] performs these things and foretells
[43:42] these things that happens as perfect
[43:44] they are
[43:47] I'm only one that's near
[43:49] when he does it
[43:51] I was only a voice that he used to say
[43:55] it wasn't what I knew it's what I just
[43:58] surrendered myself to that he spoke
[44:01] through
[44:01] it isn't me
[44:03] it wasn't the seventh angel oh no
[44:06] it was the manifestation of the son of
[44:10] man
[44:13] see if you make him become a man you're
[44:16] going into deity and that's what people
[44:17] don't realize
[44:19] he said well wait a minute we got you
[44:21] because you believe the bride is the son
[44:22] of man that's right and I believe she's
[44:23] deity don't you
[44:26] come on
[44:28] I may just read these after we get
[44:30] through with a I thought we believed
[44:33] that we were
[44:34] little Messiahs
[44:36] I thought we were the little eaglets
[44:39] I thought we were the deity made
[44:41] manifest
[44:44] that's where I thought the prophets
[44:46] taught us
[44:47] but that don't make us nothing that
[44:50] makes him something it wasn't the
[44:52] seventh angel no it was a manifestation
[44:55] son of man it wasn't the angel his
[44:57] message it was the mystery that God
[44:58] unfolded
[45:00] so that's a mystery they were sealed up
[45:02] in the Bible it's not a man it's God the
[45:05] angel was not the son of man he was the
[45:08] messenger from the son of man the son of
[45:11] man is Christ he is the one that you're
[45:13] feeding on you're not feeding on a man a
[45:17] man his words will fail but you're
[45:19] feeding on the unfailing body word of
[45:22] the son of man so he's talking about the
[45:24] word right
[45:26] come on look at the next one it's rising
[45:28] in the sun preaching 65 4 18.
[45:34] now who is this son of man
[45:39] he's asked the question
[45:41] and look what he goes to
[45:46] in the beginning was the word
[45:49] and the word is with God
[45:51] and the Word was God and the Word was
[45:53] made flesh and dwell Among Us
[45:57] why because he was the son of man the
[45:59] son of God
[46:02] and he'll beat the son of David
[46:06] what is the Lord Jesus Christ it's not
[46:08] brother Branham
[46:09] it's the word
[46:13] it's the message
[46:16] that's why most people don't even read
[46:18] enough to go to like future home and and
[46:20] uh at least on the Rapture too he was
[46:23] talking about you know his message
[46:24] didn't begin until 63.
[46:27] the rest of it was a restoration back up
[46:29] to where we had lost away
[46:33] then he began to bring his message
[46:38] but look look at him as we get to prove
[46:41] in his word
[46:44] 64. paragraph 221 and then we'll go to
[46:46] 222 and we'll get through it
[46:50] he's coming down and he's bringing it to
[46:52] the lady'll see an age and promise it's
[46:54] promised in Luke 17 30 that this same
[46:57] son of man he promised it would be
[46:59] revealed in the days like it was in
[47:02] Sodom upon the Earth
[47:05] all right now what happened in Sodom
[47:10] two men went to Sodom
[47:13] right
[47:15] but that was the son of man because they
[47:17] were in that form bringing it a Sodom
[47:21] all right now in bringing it then
[47:25] now it's like that
[47:28] those two men was not Jesus Christ's
[47:31] human flesh
[47:35] but yet he was inside of a created flesh
[47:39] right
[47:41] well all right thank God look I said do
[47:45] you get it
[47:46] did it have to come to pass it's
[47:48] impossible now remember you come in
[47:49] three names the son of man a prophet Son
[47:52] of God the spirit the son of David for
[47:54] the Millennium but in between this
[47:56] conjunction ain't what he's getting over
[47:57] to the last age right now according to
[48:00] his own words in the day when the son of
[48:03] man shall be revealed revealing himself
[48:05] that's what not Son of God Son of Man
[48:09] will reveal himself in a different way
[48:12] now what does that make
[48:14] Malachi 4.
[48:17] all right
[48:19] come on we got that right
[48:22] the messenger bringing the message the
[48:25] prophet bringing the word amen
[48:30] we got in the right order
[48:33] but there's a little more to read all
[48:34] right
[48:36] see the son of man will reveal himself
[48:38] not in a whole big denomination of
[48:40] things as we've had Through the Ages but
[48:43] he would manifest himself as son of man
[48:45] again to make manifest Malachi 4.
[48:49] and in that day I'll send to you Elijah
[48:51] the prophet and he shall turn the heart
[48:52] so the children back to the face of the
[48:54] apostolic fathers away from all these
[48:58] denominations and come back to the
[49:00] original word again to draw out
[49:04] what
[49:05] that last day bride the tree that he
[49:09] promised in the evening time it shall be
[49:11] light
[49:14] not through the Misty days when they've
[49:16] been in the evening rolling up to
[49:18] paragraph 222.
[49:20] which is the next
[49:22] that was 221 go to 222 and look
[49:26] and the son of man is revealing himself
[49:28] in the same power that he was
[49:31] not down to the church ages through
[49:34] justification sanctification and these
[49:37] things here but the son of man see none
[49:39] of those ages had a prophet standing to
[49:43] declare
[49:45] the resurrection sign because that is
[49:47] the son of man
[49:50] the son of man is a resurrection sign
[49:54] and that's why it had to wait till the
[49:56] end time all right
[49:57] who is this son of man the word
[50:00] the word is quicker than powerful than a
[50:03] two-edged sword and discern the thoughts
[50:05] that's in the heart
[50:06] what did he have to do he has to prove
[50:09] that word what would he do
[50:13] notice of it when we see it happening
[50:16] look at it in the same form that he was
[50:21] here in the beginning the pillar of fire
[50:24] my proving
[50:27] that he's Hebrews 13 8.
[50:30] proving it
[50:32] see we look back and we see brother
[50:33] around and when we know that had to be
[50:35] God used now even like all of these
[50:38] people that are are trying to prove him
[50:41] so wrong
[50:42] right they still say he had the gift
[50:47] they still say God used the man
[50:52] right
[50:54] right you don't hear in all of these
[50:55] things that he was wrong
[50:58] that that he was off the they say he's
[51:01] off the word but they never said he
[51:03] didn't have the ministry of Jesus Christ
[51:06] right
[51:09] right come on Church
[51:11] look
[51:12] he comes on down what do you say that
[51:14] was Christ when Paul was speaking here
[51:17] today and you believe that in the New
[51:19] Testament then the son of man the same
[51:22] Christ in the last days all right it was
[51:26] on through John 14 12. not in Luther's
[51:29] age not in Wesley not Pentecostal age
[51:31] not Baptist not Presbyterian age we went
[51:35] right down through it and proved it by
[51:38] the history in the Bible but what in the
[51:41] age of the son of man being revealed to
[51:44] breathe these things to fulfill the word
[51:46] when all must be fulfilled you see it
[51:49] it's true
[51:51] his age this time look where you and I
[51:54] are standing
[51:58] look at him as it goes on and proving
[52:00] his word
[52:01] paragraph 235.
[52:04] excuse me wait a minute
[52:07] you know how many of these down wrong I
[52:09] got a 6A and a 6B but we'll have to make
[52:13] sure we get this
[52:14] paragraph correctly all right you
[52:16] believe that
[52:18] he promised these things to happen in
[52:19] the last days
[52:21] that the same son of man will be made
[52:23] manifest
[52:24] now remember that was not Jesus talking
[52:26] to Abraham there
[52:29] Now read it
[52:32] that could discern the thoughts of
[52:34] Sarah's mind behind him he said that was
[52:36] not Jesus
[52:38] well that's not the flesh man
[52:42] who was it it was the Christ come on
[52:45] it was not Jesus talking to Abraham
[52:47] there that could discern the thoughts
[52:49] and Sarah's mind behind her that was not
[52:51] Jesus he had not yet been born look at
[52:54] it but it was a man in human flesh
[52:59] right
[53:00] that Abraham called Elohim
[53:03] the great Almighty Jesus said it wasn't
[53:06] a day to Sodom now what's close in the
[53:09] days of Sorrow so will it be at the
[53:10] coming of the son of man when the son of
[53:12] man is being revealed
[53:14] not no more as a church
[53:17] the
[53:18] not no more the bride is called
[53:23] in that day there son of man will be
[53:25] revealed what to join
[53:28] the church and the head
[53:31] who was the job that done that run
[53:33] around them right
[53:35] come on he was the man that brought the
[53:37] message to join the head and the body
[53:39] together
[53:40] how much more could we give him and a
[53:42] great honor
[53:49] you're not the marriage of the Bride
[53:52] bride room will come right down through
[53:53] this
[53:55] when the son of man will come down and
[53:57] come in human flesh do you not the two
[53:59] together
[54:00] the church has to be the word he is the
[54:03] word and the two unites together and to
[54:05] do that it takes the manifestation of
[54:08] the revealing of the son of man not a
[54:10] clergy
[54:13] I don't know not a clergyman clergy man
[54:16] or I don't know do you see what I mean
[54:20] the son of man Jesus Christ will come
[54:24] down in human flesh Among Us
[54:27] and will make his word so real that
[54:30] it'll unite the church and him as one
[54:32] the bride and then she'll go home to the
[54:35] wedding supper
[54:37] I believe that
[54:39] the prophet brought the message to you
[54:41] now that was the man standing there was
[54:43] a human flesh
[54:45] well God was inside of there like I said
[54:48] called a man out behind him
[54:52] that wasn't brother Brown
[54:55] he'd stand there he said you know what
[54:57] I'm waiting on
[54:59] I'm waiting on him
[55:01] huh
[55:03] go ahead it's the wrong way look what
[55:04] you're making
[55:05] he goes on to tell she's already United
[55:07] but then go ahead
[55:08] when the word here unites with the
[55:10] person
[55:12] and they too become one
[55:15] and then what does it it do then
[55:18] it manifests
[55:20] the son of man again
[55:23] are you reading when the word hear
[55:26] unites with a person
[55:29] 's part
[55:32] come on
[55:33] and they too become one then what does
[55:36] it do it manifests the son of man not
[55:38] the church theologians the son of man
[55:41] the word into church becomes one
[55:45] whatever the son of man done he was the
[55:48] word the church does the same amen
[55:55] it's not going to be me and you
[55:58] it's what he
[56:00] himself
[56:03] makes manifest
[56:06] there is nobody
[56:09] can heal the sick no human being
[56:14] there is nobody can raise the dead
[56:16] there's nobody can do all these things
[56:21] we're giving all the honor and glory to
[56:23] Jesus Christ
[56:24] wrote a random dead right
[56:27] and you know why that God would come on
[56:29] the scene is because he gave him all the
[56:32] honor and Glory
[56:33] do you think God would have come on the
[56:35] scene had he walked out there never got
[56:37] something behind so just remember when
[56:39] you're thinking
[56:40] if he'd walked out there and said look
[56:42] what I can do
[56:44] yeah
[56:46] now do you think God would work if he
[56:49] did it would have been like Elisha with
[56:52] a she-birth
[56:54] right
[56:56] around said it was not God it was a gift
[56:59] of the prophet in other words
[57:01] you remember they said to brother
[57:02] Branham
[57:03] show us where that oil is
[57:06] and we will give the money
[57:10] he said he knew they wouldn't do it
[57:14] he said I knew in other words or maybe
[57:16] not those exact wordings but he knew
[57:18] where it was at he said they dug all
[57:21] around over the place and didn't do it
[57:22] he said then somebody else come in set
[57:24] up on one well and hit a gusher
[57:28] see he knew where to tell him
[57:31] we'll see God told him not to tell him
[57:33] that's what's wrong with Balaam right
[57:34] what a problem with Balaam he was a
[57:36] prophet but his problem was he wouldn't
[57:37] listen to God
[57:40] right
[57:42] what are you understanding
[57:45] let's read a little bit more then we'll
[57:47] quit and we'll pick us up this evening
[57:48] but go to the restoration of the Bride
[57:50] tree number seven
[57:52] uh 62 422 paragraph five
[57:55] forty one
[57:58] then he's talking about making himself
[57:59] known and all like that and then he says
[58:01] you promised to do it in the evening
[58:04] time
[58:05] you've promised to do it in the last
[58:07] days you said and so shall it be in the
[58:10] coming of the son of man
[58:12] was in the days of lot so shall it be
[58:15] God living in human flesh
[58:18] moving Among Us
[58:20] in the form of his church
[58:24] okay
[58:27] in the Holy Spirit performing the same
[58:30] sign
[58:32] now there you go see
[58:34] but we don't see the signs
[58:39] as I said while ago if he's over in that
[58:41] Baptist Church right here beside of us
[58:43] and something happens that's God
[58:49] yeah we want to see this and we want to
[58:51] see that
[58:54] now let me ask you a simple question
[58:56] that bears on my heart all the time
[58:59] I've taught you all the time I believe
[59:01] the ministry of Jesus Christ is around
[59:03] the world I got a whole bunch of notes
[59:05] after this I don't know maybe I'll
[59:06] preached on the same Ministry one of
[59:08] these days
[59:09] but listen folks
[59:12] they surround the world
[59:17] amen but you'd say well well brother
[59:18] Dale why am I sick
[59:23] why don't you just speak it and I'll get
[59:25] well
[59:26] I like what they said Jack Cole said
[59:30] now I'm just quoting I don't know it but
[59:32] he said the man said if you got what you
[59:34] think you got get me up off this chair
[59:36] he said if you think you got what you've
[59:38] got you get up
[59:41] that's it right you get up right
[59:45] but see I believe the ministry of Jesus
[59:46] Christ is around the world
[59:50] but the point is how can he be a Healer
[59:53] if ain't somebody's sick that's it
[59:56] I thought we believe adoption the word
[59:58] it would be that we would need rain and
[1:00:01] somebody would call for it and we've
[1:00:03] seen that happen
[1:00:05] but you know what you don't pray for
[1:00:07] rain in a monsoon season
[1:00:12] so he's got to allow these things to
[1:00:15] happen
[1:00:19] come on
[1:00:21] you've got to allow it to happen he's
[1:00:23] going to allow us to be sick
[1:00:25] where he can heal us
[1:00:28] what
[1:00:30] come on folks you know
[1:00:34] I mean this out there and it's raining
[1:00:36] and it's two foot deep and you say we
[1:00:37] need to get together today and Pray For
[1:00:38] Rain where we manifest Son of God
[1:00:41] no we needed for the rain to quit
[1:00:44] and let it be manifest
[1:00:47] all I'm trying to do is get you and I to
[1:00:49] see where God is around the world
[1:00:51] working in his bride and you put
[1:00:54] together all the things that he's doing
[1:00:56] and you got the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:01:00] the same as he was Dire
[1:01:02] none of us are trying to be what brother
[1:01:04] random was
[1:01:09] there was only one Elijah
[1:01:14] right
[1:01:15] but there's a bride to believe it
[1:01:18] in the form of his church he just said
[1:01:22] look at Christ and Mr God revealed
[1:01:27] paragraph Force 57. as it was in the
[1:01:31] days of Noah so shall it be in the
[1:01:32] coming of the son of man
[1:01:34] and as today's a lot when a mother and
[1:01:36] Billy Gray or more Roberts went down and
[1:01:39] Sodom and preached into them sodomized
[1:01:40] and blinded her eyes see with the gospel
[1:01:43] you know it's so odd that we can't
[1:01:47] accept
[1:01:49] what the man would say
[1:01:52] oh we do I believe everything you see
[1:01:56] I want you to read that and tell me you
[1:01:58] believe it
[1:02:00] that God was in Oral Roberts and Billy
[1:02:02] Graham
[1:02:07] oh well you put it in a different way no
[1:02:10] I didn't
[1:02:12] oral Robertson Billy Graham was just
[1:02:14] part of my messengers do we believe that
[1:02:18] well you know what God was using them
[1:02:21] no if they had anything they'd be in
[1:02:24] this message I mean it
[1:02:29] is it in you
[1:02:30] it's all I asked okay look one Angel
[1:02:33] stayed back a messenger with Abraham and
[1:02:36] the elected group and what kind of a
[1:02:38] sign did he do see and what did Abraham
[1:02:41] call him Elohim God manifests in flesh
[1:02:46] Jesus showing that he himself God in him
[1:02:50] will be manifested in his bride in the
[1:02:54] last days
[1:02:59] oh my my just no end to it it's a
[1:03:03] revelation of God it's Eternal just keep
[1:03:06] moving on and on and on
[1:03:08] that God would be manifest in his bride
[1:03:11] in the last days
[1:03:15] let me read one more and then we'll quit
[1:03:19] take it up this evening
[1:03:21] sir as we would see Jesus number nine on
[1:03:23] you
[1:03:24] paragraph 161.
[1:03:27] Jesus was God in flesh
[1:03:30] and if Jesus is in you tonight
[1:03:33] it's still God manifest himself in the
[1:03:36] last days the son of man revealing
[1:03:39] himself in his church
[1:03:44] now I didn't say these things
[1:03:47] the human flesh making himself known you
[1:03:51] get it God down here in his church
[1:03:53] making himself again the word the son of
[1:03:55] man being revealed in the last days as
[1:03:57] it was in the days of Sodom
[1:04:00] you see everybody's hung on
[1:04:04] brother random son of man
[1:04:08] right
[1:04:10] we know his position his place and what
[1:04:12] he was
[1:04:15] we honor that
[1:04:18] we're quoting what he says there the
[1:04:21] unit's not saying all of it well come on
[1:04:25] bring you quotes
[1:04:31] show me something contrary to what I've
[1:04:33] taught for 40 something years
[1:04:38] but you know people think you're exalted
[1:04:40] you're you're some kind of doing
[1:04:41] something when I say that in 1969 I
[1:04:44] preached that the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:04:46] would be the son of man in the last days
[1:04:50] who you think you are I'm me who are you
[1:04:52] where was you at in 1969 playing around
[1:04:55] Walmart
[1:04:57] they had them back then
[1:05:00] I guess might not have had them it was
[1:05:02] five and ten cents store Woolworth
[1:05:06] okay Marsh was there
[1:05:09] I'm not being sarcastic I'm telling the
[1:05:12] truth
[1:05:13] you talk to people I don't know whether
[1:05:16] he said that or not
[1:05:18] why don't you know
[1:05:21] you know all about Obama you know all
[1:05:24] about oh Francis
[1:05:27] right
[1:05:28] you can tell every time he done anything
[1:05:30] and all he done well I don't read them
[1:05:33] things
[1:05:37] I don't have time
[1:05:39] the fool with junk
[1:05:42] I told him in a fellowship meeting in
[1:05:43] Alabama I'm pretty sure it was over
[1:05:44] there years ago when they were talking
[1:05:46] about it for the for Obama was elected I
[1:05:48] said I was talking about everybody was
[1:05:50] talking about this and everybody talking
[1:05:51] every preacher got up said something
[1:05:53] about it I got up and I figured they
[1:05:54] probably knew I was going to say
[1:05:55] something smart you know
[1:05:57] I got a fire set y'all won't know who's
[1:05:59] gonna be president
[1:06:02] I said you want me to tell you tell you
[1:06:04] who's going to be president
[1:06:07] nobody wouldn't say yeah I said would
[1:06:09] you like for me to tell you who's going
[1:06:10] to be president
[1:06:12] somebody said yeah
[1:06:15] I said the Bible said I put in Kings and
[1:06:19] I take out Kings I said ever who God
[1:06:21] wants to be president of the United
[1:06:23] States whether it be a woman or whether
[1:06:26] it be an Obama or who it be it'll be
[1:06:28] what God has placed in there for the
[1:06:31] reason to bring you and I to the place
[1:06:33] that we need to be
[1:06:37] if McCain had got it we'd have probably
[1:06:39] been in worser shape
[1:06:41] go to an older man he wouldn't have put
[1:06:43] up with a lot of the young junks
[1:06:47] I told you my thoughts are they put in

[1:07:44] come on Church wake up I'm just trying
[1:07:47] to get us to see the hour that we're
[1:07:49] living what does it matter who's going
[1:07:51] to be president
[1:07:52] what does it matter a profile of the
[1:07:54] United States
[1:07:56] it'll be when God ordains it to be
[1:08:01] but if you and I are not ready
[1:08:06] we're gonna fall for it
[1:08:12] right
[1:08:14] what's going to happen they come up one
[1:08:16] day and cut out your Social Security
[1:08:19] oh they can't do that
[1:08:26] you know everybody's talking about Obama
[1:08:28] says when you're about 70 something you
[1:08:30] know if you got something just give him
[1:08:31] drugs
[1:08:33] let him die I don't try to treat him you
[1:08:35] know whatever you know
[1:08:39] we're seeing what the prophet stood back
[1:08:41] there
[1:08:42] 50 years ago and talked about
[1:08:47] a day when it would become that you'd
[1:08:50] belong
[1:08:51] as I was bringing out the other day
[1:08:54] statue of perfect man where he says keep
[1:08:57] your home
[1:08:58] belong to the Catholic Church
[1:09:01] well brother Dale explain that keep your
[1:09:03] home belong to the Catholic Church
[1:09:08] I just explained it
[1:09:10] what if you keep your homes you belong
[1:09:13] to the Catholic church because that's
[1:09:14] what he said
[1:09:19] but come on folks I've told you a lot of
[1:09:21] things he said he said if you know what
[1:09:23] you had in your pockets you'd take out
[1:09:24] burn it but he didn't take his and burn
[1:09:26] it
[1:09:29] right
[1:09:31] why cause you're a human being
[1:09:35] so he wasn't telling us to do them
[1:09:36] things
[1:09:38] he's just telling us what we had
[1:09:41] the money in your pocket is connected to
[1:09:44] the Catholic church because they got the
[1:09:46] gold to back it up
[1:09:48] what if they demand right now what is
[1:09:50] China
[1:09:51] come on musicians
[1:09:53] what is China right now demanded all of
[1:09:56] their payment that we've borrowed from a
[1:09:59] third world country
[1:10:00] to be able to exist on Social Security
[1:10:07] I mean I'm looking at my own kids I'm
[1:10:09] looking at my own
[1:10:11] what would happen if they said no more
[1:10:13] Social Security
[1:10:14] no more General Motors paychecks
[1:10:19] is my kids going to jump in and take
[1:10:20] care of benman Nanny
[1:10:27] it's gonna cost you
[1:10:29] if you do
[1:10:33] right
[1:10:35] you realize what a stroke of the pen
[1:10:36] could cause
[1:10:38] Mass confusion
[1:10:41] you realize you have no food in storage
[1:10:44] the food is from the farmer to the
[1:10:46] market it is not stored up my Lord back
[1:10:51] in the 60s we gave Russia all of our
[1:10:53] wheat I remember that when I was in
[1:10:55] school
[1:11:01] see there's a stroke of the pen they can
[1:11:02] do anything they want to
[1:11:04] you say oh they can't do that to me I'm
[1:11:06] bride
[1:11:09] what if that's what God is going to
[1:11:11] allow to happen
[1:11:13] to bring you and I to our knees
[1:11:19] the dean I talked a while ago about
[1:11:20] brother Ryan talking about desperation
[1:11:23] you know there's a lot in desperation
[1:11:24] you go study well you take some people
[1:11:26] they just take desperation one time they
[1:11:28] will never quote the other
[1:11:29] but around the city you're going to be
[1:11:31] desperate to perish
[1:11:32] he turned around says you can't get
[1:11:34] desperate that's right
[1:11:36] he said God got to make you desperate
[1:11:39] right
[1:11:41] and he'll explain a person healed in the
[1:11:44] church or to throw the whole church into
[1:11:46] desperation
[1:11:50] why don't you say all he says
[1:11:53] on a topic
[1:11:55] instead of just one thought
[1:11:58] can you take anything you want to make
[1:12:00] him say anything you want him to say
[1:12:03] but take it all
[1:12:06] you see a church we have had a wonderful
[1:12:09] marvelous message
[1:12:12] that's why I believe there is nothing
[1:12:14] wrong with the message the messenger he
[1:12:16] was a human being that had problems
[1:12:19] in his life
[1:12:22] the messenger the carrier the man
[1:12:24] William Branham could had wrongs
[1:12:27] but his message is the saith Lord I'm
[1:12:31] not talking about the stupidity of
[1:12:33] people oh he repeated himself God don't
[1:12:36] repeat itself
[1:12:39] he don't
[1:12:40] verily verily I say unto thee
[1:12:46] verily verily is two times early
[1:12:50] right
[1:12:53] come on get it right
[1:12:58] but you see Church we're going to have
[1:12:59] to be we're going to have to have
[1:13:01] ourselves mentally prepared for what is
[1:13:04] to take place in the last days
[1:13:07] what is it the Mormons or Jehovah
[1:13:09] Witness one has a year Supply Foods
[1:13:11] toward it
[1:13:12] Mormons
[1:13:14] that's not too bad of an idea
[1:13:16] you know I think you ought to have
[1:13:18] something stored up in your house so
[1:13:20] what are you going to do if the power
[1:13:21] goes off what are you going to do if the
[1:13:23] if it comes with snow
[1:13:27] what are you gonna eat
[1:13:29] you can't eat the grass because it was
[1:13:31] snow
[1:13:40] but I don't think you have to do like we
[1:13:42] done we had enough in our house at one
[1:13:43] time to fed this whole church for over a
[1:13:46] year
[1:13:49] well you know it got getting pretty old
[1:13:52] you know what we've done with it
[1:13:54] somebody give I think Terence a pig I
[1:13:56] don't remember where he bought it or
[1:13:57] something wound up he got a pig you know
[1:13:59] what we've done we took that food and we
[1:14:00] fed that pig
[1:14:02] and that was a fattest pig he was so fat
[1:14:04] he couldn't stand up and eat he'd sat
[1:14:07] down in Eagle
[1:14:09] he couldn't even stick his own head down
[1:14:12] like a normal Pig
[1:14:13] you know what we hate that booger you
[1:14:16] know what he could
[1:14:18] but you know what we got cam stuff in
[1:14:20] our basement
[1:14:22] we can pinto beans
[1:14:26] come on sisters makes it a whole lot
[1:14:27] easier on you because how many of you
[1:14:29] have pinto beans you got to cook them
[1:14:30] four hours right or Black Eyed Peas you
[1:14:32] got to cook them four hours if you're a
[1:14:34] count them in a pressure cooker you pop
[1:14:36] them up warm them and they're ready to
[1:14:37] eat
[1:14:40] yeah white said it's gonna happen
[1:14:43] why not be prepared against that day
[1:14:48] that's right but just remember
[1:14:50] you got to remember a lot
[1:14:52] because you start cooking and somebody
[1:14:54] next door is going to come find out what
[1:14:55] you've eaten
[1:14:58] so it might be that we will have to
[1:15:00] speak on the table while we eat and ask
[1:15:02] the Lord say Lord make sure it ain't no
[1:15:04] smell to these pinto beans
[1:15:08] I know I'm silly but is it right
[1:15:11] I mean is it right you know
[1:15:15] and Lord just don't let nobody else see
[1:15:16] how fat we are
[1:15:22] the prophet says we're not
[1:15:25] but he said we'd go through a
[1:15:26] persecution
[1:15:29] not a tribulation no way
[1:15:34] what do we got brother let's stand
[1:15:35] number 98 98 it's probably
