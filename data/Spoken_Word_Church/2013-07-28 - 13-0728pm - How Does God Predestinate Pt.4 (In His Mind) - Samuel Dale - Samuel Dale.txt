have a good time and we do tape it so if you want to request it you can talk to brother Joe and and can get you know a copy off of it or something but now we we get pretty pretty informal and we we call names in that one you know we we try to be nice here you know because you're doing but in there we might tell you who's preaching What doctrine but you know we try to be fairly nice anyway all right but amen Romans 8. any other announcements I really enjoyed the kids really appreciate them kids that are doing because that's that's training them up to where that they're doing their jobs early wouldn't like us without doing the wrong things so we're doing with that amen Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this day and your love unto us and thank you for all things truly thank you Father for these children who have the desire in their heart to serve you and to sing and to worship and talk about you and we pray that you'd bless them in all their doings or schoolings their life to things you take care of them Lord we commit them into your hands believing that you are the protection The Shield all that's ever needed and we just pray you've got each one have your way now in the service as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and direct us into what to say to your people we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen verse 28. Romans 8 and we know that all things work together for good to them who love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no now I tell you that when I read the scriptures I read it as understanding of fitting it together with the entire Bible so even the scripture itself will tell you if you read it correctly see for whom he did for no for knowledge see all right he also did predestinate after he knew what to be conformed to the image of his son here on Earth all right see that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate already then he also he called in whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against us and then you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we've spent three messages on foreknowledge and bringing it down because I swear I believe that the prophet of God is explaining it to us but then we can say you know and and I think this way so forgive me uh we can say brother random said it the Bible said it and and we can do that because of a um influenced by somebody or something that has directed our thoughts uh into certain channels and ways of thinking you know and and and that's that's good because we need that but see I think what we need is a revelation see Dennis if you've got a revelation you don't care what anybody says you know I mean you can bring me any quote or anything you know that brother randomly said on predestination and things and let's see how it goes in with the the entire picture and we'll paint a picture but when you just have something that you bring in and say well well you know that he must have been wrong there or he wouldn't have said it like that you know well the Bible says over here to be baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost so Peter that was Jesus but Peter said you know over here he said well I'm going to take what Jesus said well that's the way people think and see when you're doing it like that then you're in Mass confusion because you cut off the complete revelation but to us see then we believe what father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ no problem is it very simple in the word of God once it's revealed to us so then I pray to God that he'll speak to your heart and I've always said I don't even try to get my wife to believe what I believe I don't try to get my kids to believe what I believe you know the grandkids the great grandkids and all of them all of that I I but daughter-in-laws and son-in-law I want them to have their revelation and then if pop goes on then you don't have to worry about it but if you're only built on pop then when Pop Goes you go right so then that's what's caused the confusion around the message if people are built on one certain person and then when they pass on or something happens they go into sin or something then it's just flop you know because the people don't have the revelation all right now but I want you to think about this afternoon I want a background just to her and then we'll move on with a thought that we've been covering that God does not predestinate even by his own desires because he desired to all be saved all right but he predestinates by his foreknowledge okay and by that for knowledge he can see who would be saved and who wouldn't and thereby then he could write down and put in his word you know what Jacob would do and Esau would do that way he's not predetermining it the person that made the choice is predetermining their outcome are you with me see what we choose the way we think and the way we do we choose our destiny right God won't override your free moral agency I'm a firm believer in that a lot of people in the message even say we don't believe in three more agency well then you're out of the word of God and you're out of the prophet's message because he said he believed he said he believed it so why can't we believe it all right see then that way we we take what we want you know and leave aside what we don't want and you know and like a man was telling me one time he said you ought to just take it um they really call it might have been reading close this morning but is he the First Corinthians or one up in there you know where it talks right close where it talks about the gifts in a different thing he said you're just tired that out of the Bible I said okay just let me have your Bible well he wouldn't do it you know he knew me and I'd have done it I'd have just took them pages and pulled her out I went and bought him a brand new Bible but uh if that's what he meant then we'll do it you know see I believe all of the word of God is perfect and correct I believe it's got to be revealed it's not just how many quotes we can have right it's not how many thoughts we can have is what God can reveal to you and I all right see then we we got down this morning now this is I say a background just a little bit on the afternoon because every service I try when I get into series I try to keep backing up on to the point bring it through because that way I want your mind to stay on the uh the thought and you can make the choice me you know the Bible does say choose you this day all right but we were looking down where the Prophet will bring these up that we were looking where the Prophet said from the resurrection of Jesus in 1956. that predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to Destiny they got these up so they'll bring them he didn't want well let's just read it they got it up and God in the beginning could see all things the way it would happen therefore he could tell this will be this way and that'll be that way and this will be this way in that that way because he by foreknowledge he wasn't willing that the left side would be wrong that this would be he didn't want that to happen but being God he knew it would happen that way so therefore he could foretell what would be he knew the end from the beginning amen he could foretell it now think about this and you'll see it Garrett gaining ground in a moment he could foretell it um not just foresee so he would foretell it now I believe this is what he's talking about foretelling the Bible so God could foretell it could have it written I also believe that this Bible was written before the foundation of the world Amen all right then it came to Earth to be written by mankind see that would make the word Eternal you said well man which version do you have brother Dale I like those uh I'm accused of being sarcastic so I like that you know people being sarcastic which version do you want to use well I'm sorry this is just the way I think God came down through a prophet and Vindicated the King James version because that was the one he used it now what you like about it I don't give a hoot I'm just telling you what I think he Vindicated that he didn't vindicate good news for Modern Man you didn't vindicate those but he Vindicated to King James Version well you know what none of the ends and the butts the prophet sits in the right place so why couldn't we believe that the King James version was what was in heaven you know got a couple of servers and if you hit it knotted but you know I just tell you what I believe that well you don't have to worry about it but see I believed in God could write down now he didn't have to pin it that's what we look at like God wrote before the world you know he didn't have to pin things down he brought mankind upon the Earth he put the Bible in the Stars right then he brought it on down to the prophets writing the word what was in God's mind the prophet said is now in the bride of Christ all right now which is the word of God all right so that's how much I believe it I don't I know I say things sometimes that are I guess hard to understand I don't mean that because I'm so smart it's just how dumb I am but see what do you believe about for knowledge well I believe it was God for you well you know if we believe that he's infinite we know everything is right and works and it'll be that way but you don't never try to think about the mind of God and how great it is you know I believe that God in his foreknowledge knew that I would marry my wife we would have three children five grandkids we got two great-grandkids now I believe he knew that and I believe that it's transpired but you know what we had to live the life to make it fulfilled all right but what about an infinite God I'm sorry but this is the way I think I've tried to explain this before and people laughed at me I believe God knows and would have the capability of knowing that if I didn't marry my wife and I married another woman and had kids he could know that are you going to limit his in in infinite but we know it's not going to happen why because it's the way it happened me but see we limit him by making our thoughts try to line up to something he then we we we get into a situations as we were talking about this morning and where the man asked for time and God gave him 15 years that's right God knew we know that now he knew he was going to give him 15 years before the world he wrote that in the word right but you know he knew what would have happened if that man would have died and the prophet said it would have been better if the man had died he said cause he put Israel in a bad place see we don't you know the infinite mind we don't allow him to be able to know everything and we think we pull things over on him you know but we're not gonna pull anything over on God he knows but he's infinite forgive me for that if you don't like that illustration that's all right I'm just telling you how I believe infinite is that that way I put no limit upon the God that I serve I ain't trying to figure it out either I just live my life I've enjoyed you know just being who I am and and coming in this message and believing it and giving that opportunity I I just I see the god that that when I was about 11 years old I saw women always wanted to see him after then but when the prophet began to talk about God I begin to see the one I saw you know it's all right it doesn't make anything out of me one of these days I'm going to preach on the gifts and callings of God being without repentance and how faithful Ministry is predestinated eternally okay because see I believe the word but foreknowledge the prophet said predestination looks back to foreknowledge see then that means foreknowledge is before predestination now that clears up to me now that clears up the problem of whether or not he stamped it is that's the way it's going to be and I can't change it see then I see that sister Gail that it's a life that I've lived is my foreknowledge you know and through this life that I lived which has been a very horrible one as far as Christianity I would agree with you but yet still I've searched for God along for a God that always believe was real not just satisfied with going to church you know and be good and I want you to see God for yourself and seeing that away that you can see that you can look back in your life sit down sometimes and just think of your life we've got to think about the horrible things that we've done in life to go along with it yes but we don't want to dwell on the horrible side we want to dwell on maybe somewhere down through there a little contact was made a little something that you saw and and then I wouldn't take a thing in the world far I've used this to Gail because I know she doesn't mind it because she was vacuuming one day and and she just saw one God that's that to me that's greater than anything you could ever think of in your life a million dollars what good is that anymore you know he said well I'd like to have it next week it might be gone you better enjoy it if you get it you know but think about it see then for knowledge is a greater thing than predestination because by that foreknowledge he can predestinate and he doesn't choose as we read her in one of the messages this morning he doesn't choose we are doing the choosing yes but brother Dale that don't make me feel good because the heat show that makes me feel real good to know that I did want him I did desire him I wanted to know about him yes no maybe it comes because it raised up the way we was because you know was raised forward and then you know didn't have ability to get an education no but you say Well it wouldn't do you no good it might not have but I had more sense maybe I could explain myself a little better if I'd got an education but I can't so you just have to put up with that but what about it now God didn't say I'm going to choose you and I'm going to send this person to help he didn't do it that way he wanted all to come to Heaven that's in Abraham's in his seat after him he wanted all of us to come to heaven but he knew that's where I tell you the doctrines and people look at you and wonder we'll go check them out the Mormon Doctrine is an odd Doctrine because in the Mormon Doctrine you have Satan and you have Jesus as two opposings and they're presenting to God a plan to bring all mankind to Earth because we were all up there with God dwelling that's their Doctrine and uh Satan had an idea or doctrine to save everybody well Jesus had a Doctrine to save only certain people well that would make the devil a whole lot more greater than than God you know see that's their Doctrine not realizing you exalt Satan to the Apex instead of God but God wouldn't all be saved he never created one person that he didn't want to be saved and that's why I love the prophet where his explanation he said every person we read this one ever son in the world was a son of God that doesn't mean by New Birth that means the fact that we were created her mom and daddy didn't create us even if they had brought bodies it wouldn't have been no good the soul in the spirit couldn't dwell you know wouldn't add anything God wants everybody to be saved you say he hated Esau did he hate see we read the word as we are talked to find it is that word that God just hanging you know I just hate him no how can God hate what is in there in God that he can hate he said he knows good and evil now how can he know evil other than knowing about evil he even said he created maybe evil how can he do that where's anything out of him to be able to create where's it any hatred that he could have for Esau the greatest hatred God could have would be the smallest amount of love you and I could think about but see we think well the word says that look where can you put anything like that in God I just I wonder about them he says in the message adoption for knowledge therefore if he by foreknowledge knew who would be saved who and who would not be saved he could predestinate you remember all the others where he was using he said that predestinate was a bad word look what he says here 1965-22 he said the word's not sure such a bad word after all see once you understand it's not a bad word all right but we need to lay everything as he said on down there aside and look straight to God all right just getting a little background go to the next one while you bring them up patma's vision of Atmos Vision 60 1205 1204. evening I truly believe that the remnant is chosen by God I believe it that God chose to Remnant before the foundation of the world and has by his foreknowledge not the word now watch the predestinate the God is a stingy little word amongst the people see but God before the foundation of the world in his great infinite mind shows the bride chose Jesus chose the church and could predict at the beginning what it would be at the end he if he says when it there's nothing what he did not know he knowed every fly everfully excuse me never be on earth and how many times as bad as I go out all the time and I don't like fleas and flies and mosquitoes which is everywhere excuse me and he thought he knowed every one of them and you know what probably if you run a record back to find out they would every one of them have a some personality or some part about them that would be different you know and all the snowflakes that fall in the world there's never too identically the same always amazed me how that a little old gnat come from a germ and a big old elephant come and adjourn another same size at the beginning that was amazed me but listen God being infinite he knew the end from the beginning therefore he knew what people would do so he could foretell that's all for the faith of Abraham 55 11 18. he could foretell what would take place for he knew what would be for knowledge it's the point of four knowledge the next one go ahead and pull up number six that's what I'm talking about this morning the little bird and that little bird thought he could you know why he's just as smart as the human you know but when the man coming around using the big words he found out he didn't know very much and he's Compares that with us thinking about the infinite Mind Of God is so far beyond human intellectuals until it would never be the best we could do would compare with nothing of his infinite mind so we just got to believe and let it go from there all right now the mind of God what do you think about the mind of God and before I start with anything I want to say this point as I've ended and mentioned a little this morning Judah says Garrett was in the mind of God but that didn't make him eternal Esau I was in the mind of God so we're going to read in a minute the mind of God is the Bible the word so Esau was in the mind of God just as well as Jacob right then it doesn't make you Eternal just to be in the mind of God that's what everybody in the message preaches we're in the mind we were in the mind of God so that makes me eternal it doesn't make it Eternal because you're in the mind of God because everybody'd ever be in the world was in the mind of God and in that mind now here's what we got to deal with so hold on a little bit in God's mind is his foreknowledge correct your mind is what you are right what you think so now all of laying down going back to foreknowledge here we stand for knowledge all right that is the mind of God his foreknowledge so in that way he could look down through time you can see everything he could predestinate everything predetermine it for ordain it because he would be dealing with his foreknowledge now so hold this afternoon the thought I told you we're going back further in another message or so but holding your thought the mind of God and in that way you can see that just because we're in the mind of God don't save us right right that's right because everybody'd ever come in the world was in the mind of God and the prophet of God said every person that ever come into the world was born with this great inward part of him he called it Faith one time that made him search for God you go to the foreign countries where they've never heard of Jesus in their worshiping idols right why because we are creation we know no matter what no matter how mean you are or what thoughts you are you you still got something in back in there a desire to serve God is what we were born with is that the way the prophet describes it everybody not just a bride I said whatever well I come with this desire to serve God so did everybody I mean did Judas join the crowd as a dirty crook now I know what the word says about it so don't worry about it that he was a thief from the beginning I know that was your thief the first day ready to become a thief as he went along Adolf Hitler is a little baby which is like any little baby no matter how mean the person you could think of they're born with us with this longing within them to find the god that created them so why is there so much put on but I come in the world Desiring to find him amen so did everybody why there's so much talked about in the mind of God well in the mind of God with every person they would ever be in the world he thought of Judas this carrot this much he thought of you the same time he thought of Jesus coming on the earth he thought of Judas coming on the Earth well see we say if I was just in his mind that makes me eternal Now where's that in the prophet's message I know what he says about the Eternal talks of God I've got them at the end of the message but I'm just trying to lay something down to you to think about then take the four knowledge as we said here is from here that away where we're determining thanks to be and it comes out to be in the way that he thought of it but back up to where he was at in his thinking and in his mind at the same time that he thinks of you he thinks of everybody else that's in the world yeah but you just don't understand because God loves me according to my Bible he loves everybody I'm just sorry but that's the word was he talking about the mind of God he's got to look back as to something that you're wanting to to make his mind oh bring forth things when in his mind he just thought about what would be there's your foreknowledge his foreign in his thinking right he just sat down one day and he thought I'm going to create a world I'm going to create people and he said well what do they be well I'll create them as perfect as I can because he did Adam and Eve but in his mind he was thinking at the same time how can I display the attributes I have they ended up saying this morning he didn't gain attributes down through time he had attributes before the world ever give a gun even back when he was Elohim which the prophet gives the definition of Elohim is what self-existing when he existed alone all right now if he existed alone we didn't exist with him foreign eternal life existed with him and we'll get to it eventually the prophet said it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it's the word or seed so when Martin Luther's are saying this morning when that crossed that path in time that God had seen it Martin Luther caught that message there was the seed of God coming to a man the man caught by Revelation and became what he was preaching or the just shall live by faith so then time and God's Eternal thoughts ran together what do you think is going to cause the end of the world or or the Rapture in a thing for 40 something years past the prophet bringing his message why are we here is because we haven't caught the message rights yet now we're waiting on somebody else oh ain't you nice I believe it was brother Branham I'm pretty sure he said if you want to find out how valuable you are he said take a bucket of water stick your finger in it and pull it back out and says you won't find no hole no man up and do all the cotton meal and a couple of boys he thought they'd run the plant years ago they got mad at him he just got his boy and walked out and said we'll shut this place down he went outside now this happened you know suppose the story was told he went outside to look and they just still working he told his boy you know we're not as important we thought we was but you see we try to build everything to to connect to something within us why not believe it's what's in him the Bible said he chose us in him it doesn't say he chose him and us the Adam come here with Eve in him but we want to preach that we come here with God in us oh I always was eternal you better start dealing with the fact that we're in Jesus Christ but get the point the word of God is God's mind placed in letter form and by that we can see the picture that he saw in his mind right right we can see that before the world he sat down he thought it out we'll read where the Prophet said in God it was not like a man with a blueprint that would finally become into being it's his thought but he knew when he created Adam and Eve the Dead Fall now he couldn't make them fall and display his attribute of a Healer or savior that'd make him wrong but he knew if he made them oh that Adam and Eve they had a man if if he just made me first I know everybody don't like me I'm not no politician anybody said man look what we've done voting Obama in if you'd put McCain in we've probably been in worser shape ain't nobody pull this out you want the profit put a George Washington Abraham Lincoln every office in the country you can't pull it out we just want to blame it on somebody let's just enjoy being here and have a good time don't worry about it because it ain't gonna be too well you know ain't long I think things are going to run out don't you but now think about it that God before the world he just looked down through time and he's seen everything that would ever transpire hers is foreknowledge you go any other way you're going to predetermine it now so in his mind Judas says Karen existed that didn't make him eternal but in his mind William Branham existed but that didn't make him eternal he had to come to Earth and receive the new birth see then that's the only way you can become Eternal is by the new birth but see then the mind of God is his foreknowledge I don't know I don't even know where I'm at in a note so forget it that mind is his foreknowledge or what else are you going to call it he foresaw for new then by foreseeing and foreknowing he could foreordain for things to transpire the Earth to be like it is and you and I to be sitting here today because this is a display of God's mind where we're at now see then he wrote of it put it in a book and gave it to us and watch what he said let's get it this is one yeah go ahead with number eight we'll do number seven but I like it he said he seen my baby sitting back under is he never a hungry person in India he's seen every preacher in the pulpit he's seen every hypocrite walking that's that's all the message word become flesh he's seen the whole thing all right but look of the message Perfection 56 16. e19 now look before he ever put the printed word and watch him he evidently held up the Bible because when we get down here he said and this is the mind of God here it is this is the mind of God that he thought before the foundational world was overlaid it is that's the reason he could put it on printed word and say what would be because he saw it before the foundational world and you just what it would be and spoke it out and then he handed down his knowledge to the prophets and they wrote it so he handed his foreknowledge knowledge to the prophets and they wrote it then the Bible is God's mind if you want to know anything about life or anything just read the Bible well I wonder about this and what about read the Bible now don't be dumb and stupid as some people are you know I ain't gonna turn over to acts 13 so and so and go buy me a car with it's got to have the serial number 13 in it we're not silly because they know that's not but getting the point of what he's saying the word of God is the mind of God been given to you and I that's why Paul could say he said I believe I held the mind to Christ what by the new birth that was within him come on he had the alive word living within him and thereby that's why he could take and was chosen to write basically the New Testament because of his knowledge of the Old Testament that's what he brought around says it and what about Paul now being chosen to write communion message and wasn't even there when they performed it looks like it'd have been Peter or some of them but no they couldn't take it and put it back in that word Paul could stand there and go right back in that Old Testament and bring that right down out of there and bring out that mind to them Prophets now brother random says that those prophets built the body of Jesus Christ you remember that he said you got everything Joseph is a foundational Masterpiece go to it he said then you got the prophets that built the body he said life was John the Baptist to come to introduce the head and the head was Christ all right so that's the mind of God that's how Moses could write of what happened in Genesis why because he picked up the mind of God he didn't just go out and sit down and hear all these fabled stories and and then he can cut him up away writing down things he picked up the mind of God I always say about tithing them Abraham told Melchizedek he said I'll give you a tenth well I guess God up in heaven said amen that's good I'm glad he said that that's a good point no that was before the world that he knew that was going to happen see that's the way I believe the word of God I believed that we don't need a new Bible when the prophet came he didn't come to give us a new Bible we didn't have to get a different versions and things we had it I have a ability to search uh 30-something translations 36. and I use it a lot because I like to see if they keep it together in their definitions from whey and Rheem and and and all the different ones you know because it helps me you get on marriage and divorce especially and then you want to see if those writers kept that right because they're not translating a lot of times from the King James they're translating from a lot of other things and that that way I see I believe we have the mind of God if you want to know anything start reading well I'd like to know what God has in mind for me start reading hmm I don't invite you to use it as a Ouija board but I do invite you to read it and you might even be able to figure out what you're doing by reading the word because he may speak to you from it to see something in life I believe that but I believe that's God's word that's God's mind that he's placed in there and that way then ours is for knowledge come on this is God's foreknowledge it tells before the world right it tells about that he was self-existing you know not in the words that we use but it gives you the wording and it tells all the way through and tells out to the end and the future home why do you won't know anything else what is anything else to know what a man sit at the house one day he said we believe we go out Beyond brother Brown okay okay you've got my own brother random okay brother random ass priest was all the way to the Future home I bet you telling me anything past there I'm honest I wasn't being hateful with him I was grinning I said tell me what's pie star if you're going to go beyond him he's done priests just to there he said ah you're just a smart alec well that's all right but listen folks do you see what I'm talking about you don't get nothing get the thought to see the Bible as the word of God it tells the beginning and the ending and even into eternity and tells us even what is right now taking place in heaven it tells us what's taking place in hell as we call it Shogun 80s it tells us everything and that's God's foreknowledge what's your thought brother Daley my thought is one thing if we back up to four knowledge and then we go out and we predetermine from that foreknowledge then we haven't messed up yet have we everything's based on these four knowledge that he foreknew now take the Bible and see that he wrote it to give it to us to show us his mind that was from the beginning to the ending the beginning to the ending don't worry about it we ain't run out of a lot but run them on Christ the Mr God revealed he said let's go back into the back part of God's mind so we ain't run out of something to preach on we're just getting ready to preach but the mind let's get in his mind and see where we're at look at number nine this is questions and answers 1959 6 28 evening but before the foundation the world our names when the lamb was slain our names were put on the book what book now when in God's own mind he foresaw us and predestinated Us by his full knowledge before the foundation of the world oh brother if that wouldn't make the church get up and run through the aisles I'm not quite like the brother was at the fellowship meeting kept on pounding on us the other day it's all right that's his business his way he kept on trying to get us all to stand up when he got to that I could see to stand up the rest of us too old to stand up I said if I get a chance I won't talk to your boy they won't tell him hey when you're too old you don't stand you know I try to be comical without being hateful laughs but look what he says he said when in God's own mind he foresaw us and predestinated Us by his foreknowledge so now keep your thought what I'm saying mind of God is the foreknowledge of God that's where it exists that's why Judas could be in the mind of God yeah Cody's in the word of God but that don't make him eternal why because God saw he would never accept it amen so the mind of God keep it is what for knowledge and does away with a lot of the doctrines of the message oh I was in his mind so was Judas and like I tell you a lot of people don't like me either but I just try to tell it like it is and forget it everybody says he saw me there that's right he was in hell and he was in heaven which were we at right he said he saw me there he might have seen you in hell yeah but that's it everybody likes to make the little things to get you catchphrases to get you involved with them I just don't have much catchphrases you know I just don't have enough sense to do that but listen said when in God's mind he foresaw us and predestinated Us by his foreknowledge before the foundation of the world all right his mind is his word he wrote it out Armand Neville's to remember the prophet your name is written in the book he said now an arm and that was not written in the Bible but said while armored Neville is on Earth is written in the Bible what would take place he said thereby that puts your name in the book why can't we believe it that way why can't we believe in the seal book where the Prophet said what he said the book is sealed I said you're sealed with a book you know he had to take a seal off bus in the last days the worst problem is the words he used as we brought out the other week the Holy Ghost has been bound Feast of the trumpets for 2000 years at the door of Creeds and dogmas so that means the Holy Ghost has never worked effectively it didn't in the book of Acts so we want to stay there for a while everybody brags on what they've done right they've done great things but they would also the Antichrist already come in but what I love about it he said he's to be in the Holy Ghost is to be loose wow by the end time message in other words you know what that means that means you and I have got to become the word right not just talk about it we've got to become the word well what's wrong then with bringing out and exposing things when running around and said if he'd be glad when they'd stand up like they did to Paul and say you're not saying what Paul said he said you'd be glad to see him when he comes to that I don't have any troubles anybody out there I've always made it you see me off the word come show me because I want to be right but don't bring me no fight little sugar tits save you time show me where I miss it in the word you know that's all I want because I want to be right my brother random goes into something and watch go ahead the number 10. excuse me let's go to number 11. questions and answers 59 628 paragraph 165. may go on to another paragraph he's talking about if we were saved before oh we don't want to stop here if we were saved before the foundation of the world were we he said yes yes sir Revelation 13 8. said that you were saved and your name was put in the lounge book of life before the foundation the world ever was ever created you see it's in Ephesians 1. so were we saved before the world well that means we come into World eternal life yeah you better back up a little because you're not saying what he's saying because it says blessed the father of our Lord Jesus Christ all right according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundational world that we should be holding Without Blame if there's anything Eternal about us it's got to be in Christ then he goes on to having predestinated us unto adoption of children all right just keep rolling it because it'll go into the next one paragraph 167 the same message questions and answers in 59 were we Spirits then he's explaining about how we were for the world we're with Spirits then he said no we were not even nothing then but in God's mind we were and he spoke it and it materialized Jesus was slain and he knows that the Bible teaches that Jesus was the last name before the foundation were my God spoke it and when he spoke it it was as good as finished amen and when he saw me he saw you before the foundation world we were only figurative in his mind so we were any were we anything back there you better remember people wants to keep going back into God's mind well you better remember that if you step too far back from his mind that you could predestinate yourself out of existence you know what because when you go back to him being Elohim self-existing now that was not the word god it was Elohim it's self-existing the word god means an object of worship you got to have something to worship him before he could be God so there was a time that there was nothing to worship him oh he was up in heaven just running all over the place bring it over to his mind and foreknowledge and you're right back up a little bit where are you at you just take yourself clean out of existence because if you go back to self-existing which I don't believe God will ever do that again he was at in the beginning and when he created us he'll never go back to being Seth existing um that's why they tried to use the word Jehovah because Jehovah which is the Lord God when he brought it over in Genesis Lord God simply means Jehovah Elohim that's what it means Lord God means Jehovah that means Elohim their self-existent has come down and created a family and no longer will he ever be self-existing I love him for that he made angels and they worshiped him in that call that's made him God we still wasn't there think about it look at number 12. the word became flesh and India trip 54 1003 the morning service and he went on the way and the next day coming back a tree had withered you know the background story God's mind the mind that in the beginning that was a thought before it was a word that expressed Jesus Christ the same one one was expressed that word back again the and every word in the Bible is God's thought laid in seed form it's the word of God 's talks laid in seed form that if received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible brings the things to pious what made the Bible manifest God's thoughts now where are we at look at the next one number 13. get these couple real quick this is Page 338. it's comes down it's from 30 37 if you're looking in the book because it'll be divided but when they got it in the computer they brought it 338 just telling you that in case you look in there say this ain't in the Church age book you know go over a little bit more and you'll find it this verse is not given to an individual it is given to the church he is talking to the church furthermore if you will just keep the word in mind you will recall that no word does it say we are in the mouth of God it may not mean a thing to you but it means a great thing to me because he said I'll spew you out of my mouth but the bride was never said talked about and been in the mind we are engraved in his palms we are carried in his bosom way back in the unknown ages before time we were in his mind we are in his Sheepfold in his posture but never in his mouth but what is it in the mouth of the Lord why but what is in the mouth of the Lord the word is in his mouth but we're never talked about as being in his mouth everywhere else but not in his mouth because he Spears out it's like I've always said to you know I'll give you this before we get back and most of you know the statement you talk about being in the mind of God I don't want to be now listen very carefully I'll read the next when we're thoughts and all like that I don't want to be a thought in God's mind because that could be a Judas is character if there's anything I want to be is I want to be part of the Thinker okay I want to be part of the Thinker that way I can get an eternal part to me you can see we are father got to go back a little bit aren't we just because we were in his mind doesn't make us eternal that we can be a part of the Mind that's why Paul didn't say I think I have he said I have the mind of Christ he said he had to bind to Christ the mind of Christ was in Paul let this mind me and you that was in Christ Jesus it'll make you a new creature right so I don't want to be just in his mind as a thought go back just a little bit further I want to go back another step from foreknowledge look at your life when we'll quit paragraph 149 Church age book the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God eternal if you see this you'll see many things what God is unchangeable in both absence and behavior now think of that and then you'll see why it could be the Eternal God could think of you being lost because he knew what you would do when you got here and he can never think of another thought about you right right so if he thought of you being lost it means you come to the world and never accepted him problems down here not up there but the thought can never be changed Jacob he saw have I hated that's in God's word come from his mind for knowledge because of what they would do and he thought of Jacob and Esau would never be changed the thoughts of God are eternal he said well that's that borderline and on predetermining ain't it no you didn't listen but it's foreknowledge he could predetermine it and by that means you are going to be that because he saw you do it there's no way to plead the case when we get there right is it not even in the Bible it we see him preachers right comes up before him and says have not I cast out devils in thy name done Mighty wonderful Works what'd he say depart for me I never knew you didn't say he never knew of him huh but he knew in his foreknowledge and in his predestination that that preacher would never come to having a born-again experience a relationship with Christ we never knew him right the thoughts of God to enter eternally can't be changed once you stand here in his mind could you rewrite the Bible and save Judas uh is not that what they're trying to do is it not movies made of Judas now come on I don't go to movies but I do hear and read they've made a movie that Judas wouldn't such a bad guy he was really trying to help Jesus so you can write anything you want to and then people go to the movie and they'll say it's in the Bible I saw it you know says be the meals done at that you know people swear by right Edward tub will set on its own bottom that didn't work but people swear about my Grandmama read it she told me she did are you calling my grandma no you are and like the way brother would be said anything he said I Love My Mama but said if my mom was a liar said she's a liar like any mom was a liar that's where he used to say it years ago but the thoughts of God he's unchangeable in that behavior we studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his abilities so therefore he as God must be omniscient he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if you can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient the best you could say is that sometimes he will be but that's not the scriptural that's not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because of all of his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he's God thus the thoughts of God are eternal they're real they're not simply like a man with a blueprint is drawn up in which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of God can't add to it can't change it we don't come to Earth and change God's mind that doesn't work we are living his mind even my brother's Methodist preacher he says well at least there's a few things in the Bible he said I guess what's predestinated but said I don't believe the rest of it was you know I said well it wasn't predestinated like you think 12 14 years College but you see he says I don't even believe that Jesus was virgin born I said so you're out of the word of God forget it he said while we had a neighbor down there one time that had a baby and said she never know the man I said yet she lied she's alive but listen Church do you understand what foreknowledge that God he predestined he's predetermining was over on this side his foreknowledge was back here looking out then he could predetermine are write it in this book and it would be that way and that's not him choosing because he knows our choosing amen now we back up to the mind in the thought that in his mind was a foreknowledge that he could say that Jesus Christ stood as a lamp slain before the foundation of the world ever named ever be written in the Book of Life land Book of Life the sister brought this up at lunch so let's cover it just a second then in the Book of Daniel that's books The Book of Revelation it talks about books plural all right so there's a book of our Natural Life there is a book of life and there's a lounge Book of Life The Book of Life and the Lamb's Book of Life is one book the two sections I'm in the prophet's message bring it right two sections one book Judas is carrot's name was in The Book of Life but it was removed if you don't see predestination my full knowledge from that ain't something wrong with you to see that God made in his book Little Brian said and then he mentioned a group of people that their names he said are not written over then he goes on he says but I'm not saying that they wouldn't have record made you know this Bible is a record you think Judas can plead his case I got his own sign stamped certificate he can't plead his case why because this tells me what he's doing what he done but you see there's a books there's a book of your natural life where you're living doing what we're doing and then we must be saved to become in The Book of Life section the prophet said you've got to become Church age book a part of a religious order centered around the worship of God for the day he said go by thereby Judas his name was written in the Book of Life but the lounge Book of Life was written before the foundation of the world as to all of those that would want salvation and receive it so nobody can complain or gripe the case is closed you and I are living the foreknowledge of God Amen let's stand we're living the mind of God why can't you take it like that and be wonderful to think about I think that that when I first heard that Prophet one day and he was talking he said even as bad as Israel was he said God never stayed up in heaven said he come down to busy himself with the people always they're making sacrifice you know Francis and those people say well my God's not real like you think well whatever you want to think about God he tore skins off of an animals and made Adam and Eve some clothes now that's according to the Bible so he must be pretty real he's just a spirit must be pretty real it wasn't Adam making their offering you have no record in the Bible where Adam ever made an offering come on Cain and Abel's when it started off the offers God made offering for Adam and Eve pull the skins off of them animals he said but that makes God a murderer what is all this today about the animal rights they'd be after him wouldn't he would he might have sacrifice to keep from killing because he had to where we got Brothers page 299 let's sing
