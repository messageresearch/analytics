«  72       †        Then along come the Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and they cabbaged down on that. Now, there cannot be no more ages. That's all of it; that's the Philadelphia, or the--not--the Laodicea Age. But then the... We found in the studying of the Scripture that the messenger to the age come right at the end of the age every time. Paul come at the end of the age. We find out that Irenaeus come at the end of the age. Martin, end of the age. Luther, the end of the Catholic age; and what?--Wesley, at the end of the Lutheran age; and Pentecost, at the end of the age of sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
    And at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive, according to the Word, as God help me tonight to show you through here, that we are to see--receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of God for the rapturing of the Church.

«  261       †          Revelations 10, said, "In the days of the sounding of the seventh angel." Now remember, seventh, Laodicea Church Age. "The sounding of that angel," when that church age is done denominated and become a church age, when it's done in its Pentecostal organization; when the messenger to that...
    What was each messenger? What was Martin Luther? A rebuke to the Catholic. What was Wesley? A rebuke to them Lutherans. What was the Pentecost? A rebuke to them others. Where has the Life gone now? Away from an organization. No more shuck; it's the Grain. What is it? A rebuke to the Pentecost, see, to fulfill the Scripture of this hour. See?

you'll find him he'll be somewhere it amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you'd like turn in your scriptures turn back where we were this morning Revelations 3 and John 14 we didn't get to the message this morning so we just made a little addition in and you know hope it helps you to understand a little bit where I am and what I do and try to do do and maybe it'll open her eyes to something because there's no way that a human mortal can interpret the word of God I don't care if it was brother brandom or who it was he couldn't interpret the word but he said when it comes to Pi there's your interpretation so then we know and believe what we're talking about what that nobody can interpret but what we do we try to explain what we see and then God takes that and can reveal himself to you from what we're trying to explain not what we're trying to interpret cuz you can't do it the interpretation is the revelation of it so we're we're tied to that point I hope you follow that this morning right father we thank you for this day and we pray that you would just be with each and every one of us this afternoon and that you'd open our eyes to that understanding Lord of Thy word that we may see you and want to walk in your love forgive our sins and cleanse us and keep us Lord and help us to walk in you be with those that are not with us some sick different things Lord and know and just bless each one just have your way Lord with each and every one of us be with the Thomas family there and the loss of the brother and just remember the family there Lord and take care of them and just have your way with each one of us we love you and we thank you and we commit it all to you now in Jesus Jesus name amen amen Revelations 3:14 and then we'll go to John 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the lady oan right these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness who is he the beginning of the creation of God all right let's go to John 14 and begin about the 11th verse believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake verily verily I say unto you he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also now what when he say up here for what believe him for the work sake The Works was proven who he was right now look what he says verely verely I say unto you he that believeth on me the works what that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and that's the reason it can be done and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another your comforter that he may abide with you you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not see because you don't have Christ in you you can't see what Christ is doing right because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you watch and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I won come to you yet a little while the world seeth me no more but you shall see me because I live you shall live also at that day this day right this day not we'll pick us more Wednesday night but at that day how why would he say at that day meaning this day you mean they're not supposed to understand until this day no that's not the point right it's not what he's saying at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing now what day would be that day the prophet said on Christ The Mystery of God revealed I believe it is he said the day of this Revelation that's right well now that would mean forever age and every time right so that's why I said now watch what he's saying he's explaining the whole Kingdom to come down into being not just this day but to be every day and every age would be to that place and that would be that day and it would find up wind up in its finality as what in this day the day the Revelation comes forth really that you can see what he's saying what he said I and you that can be understood that's the new birth but what about you and me he's he's emphasizing more something else that we've got to understand in our Christian Journey all right and as I said this morning I hope you will take that message and listen because you know people say uh well I can't understand brother Dale he's just so deep he's into these deep things that's I said this morning I've studied the message now for 50 years and every day it's becoming more simple every day it's becoming more simple it's not becoming deeper that's what we think because if it's becoming deeper where are you going to run into it because Jesus said what did I say in this morning reveal it unto babes which would learn if it's deeper you ain't got a pro I mean you got troubles but if it's more simple then it just keeps coming down and coming to that point and after studying for 50 years it's more simple today in any time has ever been in my life to be able to see God's word and really see what it means because it means what it says and says what it means see we say but now I think this what who give us the right to think well that's the way you interpret it that's what I'm talking about this morning that's why I hope you listen nobody has a right to interpret God's word the interpretation is when it's made manifest when he said a virgin shall conceive that was never made manifest for for 4,000 years well we'll say 2,000 years that scripture was not fulfilled but one day a virgin conceived you know what fulfillment of that scripture bringing it into a basis of reality so when the word is revealed to you there's your revelation of it so I hope you follow that thought and then maybe you'll get away from thinking well that's just too deep for me to understand what it means is you're trying to figure it out that's right I don't mind saying that because I've raised that I'm I'm born and raised in that human mind all of us was to try to figure things out that's what that we think is supposed to be we think the preacher he just supposed to figure it out a little different from the congregation I didn't know that I've never found out in the word of God I've always found that the minister was to be the servant amen I didn't know he was to be this the one to be served D yeah I thought he was supposed to be the servant to everything so that means I'm supposed to be the smallest there is right see you've got a whole week to read and study and listen to texes I can do that to a degree but I have to be thinking what's next see I'm set on a channel I'm having to think what's coming next then I have to study in that thought and pattern where you can just read and study all you want to and just have a wonderful time that's right and why not why wouldn't you want to do that I wish you would uh go back in especially because a lot today would be out and I've been a lot of I wish you would go to the Philadelphian Church age and listen to that one and then take the lady you'll see an age right after that and listen because that is a great understanding that was explained to us about a lot of things things and that's what we want to get into today cuz what I want to do is just kind of look at the things and see where we're at and we'll call it you know and I do this every once in a while but we'll call it review and preview cuz I like to review where we are to make sure cuz I'm like Paul it doesn't bother me to say things twice right you ought to know that by now it doesn't bother me to keep saying things over and over I do know a little bit about the human mind I hope I got one somewhere in the between the ears and you know what it is repetitive things can be remembered right that's the whole thing of schooling repetitive repetitive repetitive repetitive you know and it just becomes a part of you well that's all I want to do is to just this word of God to be so in inside of me until that it'll all be based upon what he says then we'll find out what the scripture says ask the father in my name because who's it asking is it you asking or is the father in you asking we do a lot of asking ourselves but if we get down to the basis of letting him he he's never turned down of prayer yet okay now let's get into a thought back a few weeks ago we begin to deal with some things of thinking about in the stature of a perfect man and I've asked you to listen to the messages like the adoptions to hear ye himm uh all of those get into uh Masterpiece se's not out with a Shook and those messages because we're going up to something in our understanding and we're climbing slowly into that position to understand all right and I I do that deliberately because that's the way I understand is I come up slowly and one thing picks up to the next and the next and and that's what I want to do all right but what what have we been talking about we was in the stature of a perfect man and trying to understand there in second Peter where it says add to your faith virtue knowledge temper patience godliness brotherly kindness and then the love of God and we went through through uh many services talking about that brother brandham when he made that drawing he made the drawing and he added to as we would look at it to the scriptural point because instead of going Faith virtue knowledge temper patient godliness the Bible says in brotherly kindness and in love see he draw it out Faith virt knowledge temper patience godliness brotherly kindness Holy Spirit and then love all right but then he'd turn around and he'd say but there's only seven ads you know that's right remember that there's only seven ads so we found out there was some keys there and the reason that the prophet was putting it there because that's exactly what it is the holy spirit is sealing these things into you as you are coming up and then it seals in then the head can come down they don't have to come down cuz that's what we're doing now what do we tell tell you the last few messages we're building up that filling that up with the message of the hour instead of trying to bring the head down we're filling up with the message of the hour we're letting the prophet bring the things and just build it up to where it's supposed to be all right so we found out then this say seven ad so we found out that birth the B New Birth is Faith so that's not an ad it does doesn't say add faith it says add to your faith virtue knowledge so then looking at the pyramid it's exactly right we have seven ads but there's eight manifestations of God in that that you're doing cuz what do you start the new birth is God made manifest in you first vir then come out to love the top and the bottom has got to be the same Stone because it is the chief Cornerstone let's see the prophet said in the church it's the Cornerstone in the complete church it's the fullness it's The Headstone all right so the the Cornerstone and The Headstone is the same Stone it's just the difference in position we'll get to that the Lord willing Wednesday and you'll see that the Cornerstone could only make manifest certain things or else why would you have a headstone waiting that's right we'll get to those things Wednesday and trying to understand a little bit all right then we went through the church ages because the prophet saying that the the individual comes up the same way the church ages comes up all right so he brought it out and we covered in the in the church ages that there were seven Church ages and seven only seven angels Messengers to those Church ages right but then we found out that there's eight manifestations of God now some of you that wasn't here I'll try to Endeavor to do a little bit but there's eight manifestations of God all right see then you got what Paul irus Mar clo and then you come up to this being the last age the lady of seean age but there's eight manifestations of God through those ages we cover that in a whole sermon I'll get back and read it in a minute to you because that is the key to understanding the Bible you know the end time the message that we talk about is to see that God manifest himself Through the Ages through the individuals as he's building a body for him to dwell in all right see because that's what it's made manifest for all right see then we got up to talking about moving up now what that the messenger would always come at the end of the age and that that would be the key to understanding I was thinking the other day about well let's see this morning I was thinking about you know as I tried to explain one day that John on patmas was told about the churches right there was a church out there there were seven churches out in that area that God used to express to John his thoughts okay all right now so as he brought them see we can understand how John knew the churches and he would call it the ages but I ask you how would brother brand how was it that he knew the messenger well I got thinking about something else on there how did Brother randam know the time wise how did he know the TimeWise he could pick up thoughts from different ones and bring in at this that or the other but it's like I said remember Columba was not even in the age period right but yet he was picked as a church age messenger I got to thinking about that this morning while I was waiting on my wife to get ready to come and I I thought Lord the prophet said the pattern was the one that stayed closest to the truth all right now we dealing with the messenger the one that stayed the closest to the truth and I thought how was it that and I told you he had some help in reading some things and picking some dates but yet he was the one that gave the dates right of how long those ages lasted and I was sitting there thinking I said Lord there's got to be a key there you know what that key is let me examplify it as one why would uh Elias be called a lady of cnh H why would it be that because it would perfectly fit the times right right what is it people's rights perfectly fits the age right read your church ages and look at the message to that age and look all it all God had to do was to take that man's thinking and place it right into watching them scriptures and he'd look at that scripture and he'd say this age ends right here in this age starts right here cuz he would know the condition the existence and the things that happened during that period of time right and see you come over to what is it Columba that was the longest one of those come through the Dark Ages a thousand years or 1500 years right it of Dark Ages see the holy spirit says you see that that's the Dark Ages and he says yes that fits right here and that's this man's message I I I like it when he opens up things to where that I can see what is transpiring and see then the man was not sitting picking it himself that's right it would be the scripture related for whatever the age is right we'll get to it in a minute bringing it down Paul come at the end of the age to rebuke right and read that first church age he said you have left your first love it's Revelations is it 2:4 some we're right in there it's in the first church yet that identically places the time and what was taking place and shows right where we're at okay but now we went through it to show what that there's seven Church ages so we count out on the per individual Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience Godly brotherly kindness and love makes eight manifestations of God in your life but then you back up to seven ads and you realize that faith is not an ad it does say add love there's your key it doesn't say love will just it says add love that's your seventh one which is love all right so looking at the church ages what do you got you got seven Church ages but you got the headstone left off you say well where's the eight manifestations of God that's what I showed you your Prophet tells you how it is God was manifested in those things and then when it come down to the last age in the last Church age you had a wonderful thing happen that ausa street brought the message the prophet said no Messenger to the age he said CA the Holy Spirit came itself he said then after all at the End of the Age the messenger sent so now you got eight manifestations of God cuz you got to have that to make eternal life that don't mean nothing probably to you or your thoughts but it really does to me to hold a whole point all right now we'll get back in a minute to some of this and we'll reread but what I want you to see is what what was we dealing with the past couple of services how that when you say age you know an age a Time Philadelphian age you know ladies see and age the word age means time right you're not talking about how old you're talking about the word age is a word signifying time aging is time it takes time to age you know all right see then as it's doing then there's been the seven Church ages right but the bride has never been in an age that's right you can't put the bride in an age physically speaking yes physically speaking every age was an age with time and recordings of it and 24 hours a day and we're living now in the lady oan age cuz there's not another age Beyond this age but that's physically speaking but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the new birth in your soul your soul is already in the Eighth Day by that new birth are eternal life well don't you believe Paul's birth don't you think Paul had a new birth don't you think irenius had a new birth don't you think think don't you think all them people down through there had the new birn well see that how can you put the bride in an age you say well that don't mean nothing to me about a bride in agel it certainly does to me amen it means a drastic thing CU it means that here I am while I'm in lady yosia getting older every day but yet inside of me is one being formed he ain't getting younger right he was young to start with cuz he was eternal all we got to do is get them two together and that's why the ages had to be like they were to bring it out to in this age in this age comes to a wonderful time but yet it's believing what the prophet says like I said there's big men big people people preachers that'll tell you zeusa Street they didn't have nothing they had the gifts brother brandham said they had the Holy Ghost in his fullness in the baptism that's not an interpretation okay you see one of that thought this morning was laying on me it's not an interpretation it's a revelation and the Revelation is eternal it's not an interpretation to think about the bride being in each age being in the bride Paul and them was in The Bride right called out of the age right that's right into eternal life right right body was still in time going to the grave but I thought we believed there was going to be a time that somebody wouldn't do that so there has to be some reason for it to take place and it does in this age so had to have the key to that all right now the bride is called out of the age because she's called into eternal life by the new birth right all right now see then that's why you see that brother says on 49 future home believe that's right he says the soul is redeemed but said we're waiting the Redemption of the body now that don't need interpreting does it right you believe your soul is Redeemed by the new birth okay then we know for certain we're still in time and tied up with this getting older that's right right you ain't look in the mirror when you get home okay look the next day you'll start seeing chicken fingers and line marks and things that'll show a whole lot of things getting older all right but listen by the new birth I said this would be a review preview by the New Birth the bride is in eternal life in her soul but in her body she's still in time yes all right now that's why watch that we've been dealing with why the messenger would always come at the end of the age right right that's what your Prophet said over and over right you don't believe it going into pH left in age and you'll find 90% of what I'm talking about see the messenger always came at the End of the Age all right and brought the message to the people so he called him out right he called him out you have been called out of this age if you just believe it don't try to interpret the thought just believe it well I just don't see how that come on see that's what I mean take what he's saying that's right why can't we believe what brother randam has said right well I believe it but why are you always trying to figure it out that's right right if you believe it why are you trying to figure it out it don't need to be interpreted that's right all right now listen when the messenger came at the end of the age is the key to eternal life that is present to you and I in the soul for one thing but then to step into eternal life physically someone's going to have to do that right why don't we contend we are one of them all right but see we we don't listen we want to figure out I watch some of you some are sitting and looking and wondering what's he saying some are saying yeah he going to go in yeah got and I said don't don't read just listen what you think that's human beings and I'm not beating on you I'm just telling you I got in trouble one time I said put your pencils up and quit writing don't tell me I can't right I didn't say that it's almost virtually impossible to write while you're thinking you see you think but you better be thinking about what you're writing right come on uh sister where's she at Sister Louise she's po yeah she yeah she's back out Christine I can't never remember her name so I call her sister Louis but she's she's taking off the seals that I preached in ' 82 and and putting it into book form you know we're getting them ready to be made into that brother Mark is doing that well you're sitting there typing and listening to what's coming off that tape you can't be listening to something else around you right my Lord you make enough mistakes hey in the old days we didn't have no computers we were run our own computers you ever tried to sit down and take a tape and take it off verbatim word by word I want you to do that and you get home you will get three words right and the rest of it will be wrong till you back up and repeat yourself and go back over that and you'll have him saying thing he ain't never even thought of let alone say it right all I said is just we got the tapes they're there you can you can do I do I jot down a little thing you watch me up here I'll go I just jot a thought this is two words put them in my pocket cuz it'll bring it back to me later see I'm just asking you to listen and this morning was what I was saying not to try to interpret but to listen what a the man would be bringing to us and you might find out it's not such a big mster you might find out it's something simple see the messenger coming to the end of the age well you go one way you go the other way which way you do we put the drawing up we had that we won't do that but Paul came at the end of what age see you'd say well Paul came end of Ephesus well how could he bring the message to Ephesus if he came at the end of Ephesus right and who did he rebuke that's right right I gave this the other day I had a bunch more but I wonder if you thought about what brother BR said Paul done pull up number one and let's just read a little bit is this the sign of the end sir Paul was the first messenger the first trumpet sounded the first seal broke Lo Paul was the first Messenger as we found and what did he do declared war on what did you read that when we was doing it other day I said just a few words and went on what is the Orthodox Church oh so brother R said he declared war on the Orthodox Church he rebuked the Orthodox Church oh I know all about politic but who was he rebuking now you watch him he's going to do two things with carry that on over till Wednesday night he's going to rebuke two groups Orthodox Church who is that for not believing the Messiah sign that Jesus had produced to them so that's the Old Testament Church right the Orthodox don't worry about it I got them here right now okay don't say well I don't know what that means I not well I got them right here here so we'll read them in a minute okay so take my word until we get there all right so who does Paul rebuke he rebukes the Old Testament Church for not believing the Messiah sign of Jesus Christ Paul was a great man no wonder they hated him no wonder they tried to kill him every time he turned around look what the man was doing you realize in those synagogues churches and things that while Jesus was alive and preaching you ever read your Bible you know that it says a lot of the Pharisees or believed him in the read your Bible a lot of them believed him but where where were they later on as he begin to say I and my father is one right you know I've often wondered about we think about the the synagogues I wonder sometimes how that's handled because we think that it must have been a a set strict run of case evidently it wasn't you remember Jesus as his custom was never went to school today in his life be learning how to read somewhere and he says as his custom was he went into church and read to them don't you know what he must have been a pretty popular reader maybe they like the way he read come on they didn't come in just have a church and they looked at their they looked at this they do no evidently every group was a little bit different evidently had some pretty good discussions read the book of Acts how Paul would go into those Sy OG right you remember Paul one time was going along with them until they asked him to shave his head yes he backed out study your Bible then when the prophet says something it'll ring a bell who was Paul rebuking who did he declare war on cuz a messenger rebukes the age or time prior and brings a message right Paul was rebuking the Old Testament people from getting away from the Messi sign that Jesus had brought they should have known him remember Paul came at the End of the Age all the messengers come at the end of the age it's at the end time when these things are brought forth Paul knowing the scriptures and knowing that Jesus was Messiah and he blasted those synagogues from place to place with the scriptures and was put out of every one of them who did he rebuke the Orthodox Church who is the Orthodox Church go ahead number two questions and answers law having a shadow we'll see in a few moments she's the Jewish Orthodox Church the wife of God the begotten who was the wife of God the begotten the Old Testament Saints people the Orthodox Church hey I've got a little bit I can read there's 22 times R around and talks about Orthodox and one or two of those times he brings Orthodox over into our day cuz Orthodox means a group of people that are set to a Doctrine or idea okay but who's he talking about who's Paul rebuking go going well stay in that one run it on up now there's the Jewish Orthodox Church as the law is fading out the gospel is coming in so now you know what it is right so was everybody satisfied with the fact that Paul rebuked the Orthodox the Old Testament people you see yeah but he was way on over he he was over a little bit P Calvary but let me ask you a question why was it he finally turned it we'll read in a minute and he said you can't unworthily he said lo I turn to the Gentiles the seven Church ages are Gentiles I don't care if they're Jewish descendants or whatever but they're Gentiles right right I don't care if the biggest portion of that age was Jew it's Gentiles Gentiles means Nations that's why you had the secrets of Paul writing and them about the age and the doing but you everybody understand before Paul could do this he wanted to give the people something he had to leave a high position he had in the church of his day to stay with the word that's right who is Paul rebuking the Old Testament Saints the people the Old Testament people the rabbis the priests the guys and with him and he finished his message to them cuz come on Paul was a Jew he went to his own the same as Jesus that said he went to his own his own Paul went to his own yes right Paul stayed with the Jews and and stayed with them and stayed with them but then one day he say lo I turn to the Gentiles roll that up where they can read 3A acts 13 40 6- 48 look you count yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles you know that there was a lot of argument in the book of Acts read the book of Acts there were a lot of argument among the Believers socalled in the book of Acts they were arguing who was the greatest they were arguing who was this and over that a few years after Calvary a few years after Jesus Christ they were already arguing over who was to be in charge read the book of Acts that's right Paul comes in the book of Acts Paul begin to nail that Orthodox Church behind there for not believing Jesus Christ to be the Messiah right but then what did he turn to when that scripture started to be fulfilled who did he turn to why does it bring it that way he said that the word have should have been spoken to you Paul and Barnabas whacked bold and said it was necess that the word of God should first have been spoken to you to the Jews right but you but seeing you put it from you now this man's in the New Testament he's rebuked the past right for not believe in Christ now who's he rebuking who's Paul rebuking now those in the book of Acts that's come on that's why he comes at the end of the age he didn't come at the end of Ephesus he come at the winding down of the Old Testament and the book of Acts and then he declared his message even brother brandham stating the fact that he started in 53 ad as the time because he said that was when Paul started his missionary journey probably when this started I don't know cuz that's no business no word but he said that's right you judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life he wasn't just talking to the Old Testament people he was now in the book of Acts rebuking those in the book of Acts what cuz what could he do the Corinthians even after coming on over later what were they Corinthians means book of Correction they want to know who the father ain't it kind of like you here you know what it was when we first come in the message who do we follow the prophets G 6768 who do we follow the prophet's gone who's the messenger to take us over some of you older ones remember that but look you count yourself Unworthy of the Gospel Lo we turn to the Gentiles watch him why did he turn that look it was necessary it happen you judge yourself unworthy so so for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee be a light to the Gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord as many as were ordained to eternal life believed who was Paul rebuking if you get him anchored then the rest of the ages and the things will fall in place and you'll see it come out perfect but if you bring him down here at the end of Ephesus you got him a lot of problem trying to do and brother Brandon won't line you up if you don't understand what I'm saying brother Brown was lining it up all right you remember this quote that we gave I said this is preview review and preview go ahead to number four you remember this from the first seal then Along Came the Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's why I kept on that so much to all of these saying oh they didn't have nothing brother R said they had the Holy Spirit you can talk to him do what you want to it's nothing to me look and they cabbage down on that now there cannot be no more ages that's all of it that's the philadel or the not the the ladies in age but the we found in the study of the scripture that the messenger to the age come right at the end of the age ever time Paul come at the End of the Age watching we find out irenius come at the End of the Age Martin End of the Age Now watch him place it Luther the end of the Catholic age there is no Catholic age listed in ages Luther come at the end of the thousand years of the dark ages of the Catholic church right well look and what Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age now Wesley come at the end of the Lutheran age then that's place in your ages see we want to make it back here trying to go now make it right with the prophet and then you got it right and at the end of the Lutheran age watch and Pentecost he puts it he don't tie the two at the end of that age of sanctification through the baptism of the Holy Ghost at the end of the Pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the scriptures a messenger now your messenger comes at the end of the age you say well that doesn't mean anything to me then Christianity doesn't mean anything to you either oh but you're just being sarcastic well what are you don't you want to know the truth you said well how in the world is that going to help us to do anything help us to find out where the messengers at cuz we got to be where the messengers at remember that we got to be where the messengers at in Martin Luther's age it was no good to stay in the Catholic age prior and claim to believe Martin Luther's message we got to be where the messenger was at where's the messenger I thought according to the Bible that he was put out of the lady you see in church age that's right that's what I thought well where are we supposed to be TimeWise living in lady oia wordwise we at least be confessing where we're at now listen I'm going to say it so listen for three messages I've been trying to drive a point and that point is if we don't recognize right exactly where we're at and what we're doing then don't talk about the message if we don't start saying who we are then why don't you start saying who you ain't because that's what you're doing if I call the names of the brothers that preached at Pentecost was false most of you would get mad at me get up and walk out but yet they're the brothers all right but look when brother brandham explains that Wesley come at the end of the Lutheran age that's enough right there to explain the ages and that Paul came to rebuke the Orthodox church and the people in the book of Acts for getting away from God's word and he turned to the Gentiles thank God he turned to the Gentiles right amen because he turned to me and you okay go ahead to the next one which is 4 a this is Anointed ones at the end time read this one real careful you see church I try to bring prizes to you and bring things you know prize parts to point for you to see it I don't go and bring you ever quote I wish you would go read Bob Bo a go come and handed me a piece of paper where I talking about the other day how that one Prophet always lined up his message with one prior you know what he landed me a copy we know I like that I like that Joe brought me a list I asked him to this morning to look up a few things about something that had been questioned you know what he brought me a list I like for you to get involved right you know what your soul is involved okay listen Revelations 10 said in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel I'll reread this in a minute but I want the rest part now remember seventh latest in church age the sounding of that angel when that church age is done denominated and become a church age when it's done in its Pentecostal organization when the messenger to that now watch you what was each messenger what was Martin Luther a rebuke to the Catholic and watch him what was Wesley a rebuke to them lutherans so to be a rebuke to the lutherans he comes to end of the Lutheran age yeah but but if he's in the Lutheran age he's wrong age you don't get the overlap you don't get the point the prophet explains an overlap for us right you see do you believe what he says do you believe go ahead to the next one what is it it rebuke the Pentecost so he's going through the Shu the Grain and all we're going to rebuke this whole Pentecostal thing when we become the grain The Messengers done Del delivered his message go ahead to number four number five I've read this over and over to you but do you believe it you see each one of those ages only taking a dip into the Holy Spirit justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit that's the reason it took reason that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down that's not brother random keep reading no Messenger to the age right C the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism and know you know yourself that a lot of people said Zeus didn't have anything go talk to some of these preachers about and you know what they're saying and some of you know it for certain that they're saying we don't have what they had at Pentecost talking about back under now if we don't have that we're not born again that's right that's right you know what I said to a man that told me that he said brother Dale what do you think is wrong cuz he just got through telling me that we didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost like they had in the book of Acts he said what do you think's wrong I said I'm going to tell you exactly what I think wrong most of the people in this message don't have the baptism with the Holy Ghost I still hold that today if they had the baptism with the Holy Ghost it wouldn't have so many twisted up ideas look see that's the reason it took he's talking about the bapt sanctification work but the baptism is the holy spirit where did the baptism come Luther Wesley Pentecost that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down no Messenger to the age because the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism zeusa Street with the fullness of the baptism just like the book of Acts because if not what is it like look but at the end of the age as it always ends upon the others we find in there the Messenger s and all these Scruples and things are to be placed in their places like that then the Rapture comes for the church W who was to come and to tie up all the Loose Ends the messenger that we claim to be Willam Brad right well I just can't place that together that means you're trying to figure it out so you're not reading it to take what he says the same way we read acts 238 and Matthew 28:19 and swore by it and baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost devil don't change his tactics but listen I ain't going to be able to read a lot of it cuz I've read it to you before so I'll scan down and read and you just listen if you want these I gave them to you last Sunday You're supposed to have them I ain't going to ask for whole show hands of how many kept them we see the messenger always comes at the end of the age he comes back to rebuke them each age like that that makes a lap over in each one of the church ages Philadelphian Church age I'm reading from a lap over why lap over between each age listen folks the bride is not in the age even the drawing that was made by brother brandom after what was put on the wall at the Tabernacle the last one showed it total darkness he said I left a little light right that wasn't no bride was it Brides were the lights at you remember it started off big went down and my no bride's ever been in the age folks she's been into the bride age for her age she's been in the overlap between the ages listen in between the open door was set in between the last two ages it wasn't was not in Philadelphia I mean it was not in yeah Philadelphia and it wasn't in lady OA it was in between in the lap over the lap over is where you messenger stands your lap over is where your bride better stand but you see we're not looking at it like that what was that open door that comes in each one of those leftovers that we covered the other day Philadelphian Church age what is the open door the revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ you remember how the prophet in the Philadelphian age said it he said he started off in the first age declaring to them his name y he said he comes back in the sixth Church age declaring his name the name of Jesus he said begin to be restored not in lady oia he said in the lap over between now let me say it like this who's standing in that lap over between lady Osa I mean Philadelphia and lady oia you better put what he said that the Holy Ghost came himself who's the one to bring his name back like I said we're so carnal though we fight with words we said well the name of Jesus was lost I guess they call it Jim Joe Charlie it wasn't the name spelling of the name it was the revelation of the name and who that was the open door standing there the angel of the lady oan Church to end it up and on down P the end of the age and on down End of the Age the lap over End of the Age End of the Age that's what makes it lap what makes a life over uh what's the lap over he talking about on the ladder rungs of a ladder right right right rungs of a ladder where's the rungs of a ladder I mean you got a bottom you don't put a rung right you don't put one down on the bottom right they raise up about that far and you put a step and you call that a rung on the ladder where's it at it's between the bottom and the next part right it's like climbing a ladder to Prophet said you step up on the first rung of the ladder don't do like brother H and come down and decide you don't need that to below and just step off you'll get your leg broke we better come back down the way we go up all right rather than an Abrupt end and a clear-cut start you have an overlap where one Church age just Fades into the other one I told you and you don't listen and pay attention to it CU it took me a long time for that to sink in brother brandham said God dwelt with Israel 40 years after Calvary do you need that quote he was still dealing with Israel until Titus destroyed Jerusalem now I told you what don't try to figure it out cuz you will he didn't have salvation to him but he was still healing them fighting for him right you know what they don't believe him now you know what he's doing he's healing them you know what he's doing he's fighting for them right why because they're his people see church we need to be called out into the lap over between each age and you'll see then Paul came right here irenius Martin Columba Luther Wesley here the Holy Ghost came right here on theusa street and then right here your Elijah comes to stand between Time and Eternity you said brother Brown was a messenger to Lady oia he said that wasn't correct on the Feast of the trumpets if I come with a message of Pentecost I would be in the ladyo church age and that wouldn't be right I gave you these quotes but listen do you follow it yes Have you listened to what I've said about him yes that brother Brandon's message was in two parts according to 327 Church age book One turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father two reveal the seven Thunders which is a revelation contained in the seven seal it'll be these divinely revealed truths that literally turn us back so the only way we're going to get turned back to Faith of the fathers is for those seals to break to you and I right righten two things he's doing two things Paul was doing Paul was rebuking That Old Testament people but then he turned to those people in the synagogues and the thing that was claiming to believe Jesus Christ claiming to believe the New Testament message but they wouldn't have it correctly and Paul said I turn to the Gentiles what about brother brandham when he said that that the last day message would have to have the identification as Elijah had it would turn the hearts of the people not to the denominations but back to the original Apostolic fathers back to the word trying to do God a service without his will then M them Mysteries will be revealed in the last days when the seventh Angels seventh Angel's message when he not when he starts out doing this but when he begins to sound his message them Mysteries are to be revealed and here they are not knowing them and you people are a witness of that so brother randam what did I say the other day he did he had to turn the people back to the faith of the fathers before he could talk about the seals he rebuked the Pentecostals for getting away from their message and his message began in the seals right go on and read Rapture top of the seven Church ages when in Revelation 10:7 that the great mystery of the book was to be unfolded by the seventh angel message now there's a messenger above always and a messenger on Earth the English word angel means a messenger and in the seventh Angel's message while he was making his proclaiming his ministry then when he began to sound forth his ministry not when he started out what about it Rapture he gets on later and he says talking about his message he said all the time knowing backd under the healing and so forth like that was just to catch the people's attention knowing the message would come and here it is and them Seven Seals opened those Mysteries showing those things is what happened he said I didn't know it right come on let's be honest brother randam preached the seals in in 56 or somewhere there where he preached on them you when he came down it's about 56 where he was doing and he said I preached them like four he said like put four of them together you know and he we see then God showed him that that wasn't right cuz you know what he preached the white horse rider was the Holy Spirit that's right why because the seals had never been broke that's he thought they had that's why he come up with the idea that there was Seven Seals in the book and Seven Seals on the outside the book he said until I found out later that couldn't be he said because you'd be adding to the word so it had to be just the Seven Seals the Seven Seals was his message to bring to you and I and then like I've asked you to do I've asked you to just sit down and read the titles of the sermons after the seals broke and they're all dealing with eternal life why because he came right here to stand between man and eternity this message is to stand between all right he said not in the Pentecostal age this is not the P you remember the last on I gave you this is not the Pentecostal age this is the bright age this is the evening light this is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled we're not in l we're in Lady oia Lady oia physically but we're not in lady oia we're not in the Pentecostal age we got something different the word now watching listen to this one you remember it listen real careful the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day pull that up if you want to Invisible Union number 22 and they can read it no sir that was for Pentecost watch him this is for the bride going home with the bride we got something different the Pentecostals represented that again we're in the bright age who did the Pentecostal represent According To Masterpiece and Seed not a with a sh brother randam says Mary was not the seed that's right but she was a carrier amen he said Mary represented Pentecost that's right amen the Pentecostals is the Mary he's talking about the Pentecostals represented Mary because they were carriers but we got we've got to become the word huh we got something different do you want to hold on in that denomination because your mother and grandmother held on that she comes out of something to come into that that was the light of that day that like in the times of Noah modern events made clear by prophecy what about at church he says on that message paragraph 3:17 may want to find it look what he says this is not the day of Pentecost the Pentecostal age is passed Pentecost is gone this is the Harvest Time Harvest Time no longer an age very close to eternal life physically but just needs a couple of more steps right why because the combine has got to come together the wheat but you know what the combine also does brother B said I hear the coming of the combine the World Council of churches you need that quote that's direct he said I hear the coming of the combine cuz you know what a combine does it does two things it gathers the wheat right and it binds the to stock the stock and everything goes out the wheat comes and you run another vehicle right alongs side of and it falls over in there I can hear the coming of the combine he said the World Council of churches why cuz they're going to push us into that one day that's right are you looking forward to times no but I just wish it come on cuz I am getting tired of this situation what are you looking for then brother Brandon brother BR well that's what brother R what he's looking for go to L by him the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up just exactly like that even the Dead he said that's dead in Christ what are you looking for I used to quote this statement and I've quoted it and I'll keep quoting it probably the same way but I had to correct a little difference in a wording I always said it like this I said the prophet said one day there'll come s a baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll fill over fiber of your being and take you in the rapture I still believe that I just looked it up to make sure cuz sometimes you're quoting from what you had in your memory for 50 years ago I wish you would pull the last two which is 25 and 26 off the message called Oneness 1962 what is it you got to get with the word get yourself killed out I'm persuaded that many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost but we just receive enough holy ghost in us to make us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we want to don't want to do anything now that's your Prophet but God wants to fill every fiber of his church now watch him he wants to fill your thinking he wants to fill your mind he wants to fill every bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself or to your thinking your so surrendered in God till his word's just living right through you you don't know nothing else but God's word just stay right with his word it is his life but he wants to fill every fiber of the church now go on to the next one it's the same message that was paragraph 189 is paragraph 298 209 here we are in the end time coming from the East and West North and the South what are we doing getting ready for that Rapture getting ready for holding ourselves steady for a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost then she'll go up I misquoted it as saying youever fi of your being and take us in the Rapture so I said okay I'll go back and make sure everybody understands you know but is that what he said feel every fi of our being Amen to take us out of here you so are you looking for that I've always look for that from the day I read that well it don't sound like I listen to you preach it don't sound like you're looking for something I will tell you something right now that next that Wednesday and from there after you're going to think I'm not looking for something to come as long as you're you're looking for something to come you cannot have faith in what is taking place but if you'll get in what is taking place then you can have faith for what is to come did you catch the what I said it if you're in what's going on you can have faith for something but if you're not in what's going on you can't have faith for what's coming you're only taking what somebody said you know if we're not the people that God fills every fiber of our being evidently we're not going to be there that right so you know who that's left up to you and I to make ourselves available to where God can fill every fiber of our being with his word just remember that until Wednesday if you're not looking at what's taking place and you can't see what's taking place now and I ain't talking about Hillary in the White House I made my statement to my wife and some of them if she have picked a woman for vice president that have throw her out she now picked a man to be her vice president she's smarter than you think she wanted a woman for a vice president but the big guy says don't do it ain't time I've said I hope she gets it if she's the one if not I hope they pick somebody else cuz I want to get out of here right but you see that's what I've always been the prophet said a woman in the white house everybody's waiting on a woman in the white house right you know what I am too but you know what all these years ain't been sitting down well when the woman gets in the white house I'll start reading I'll start studying because you be ready no because you won't be in the word of the age that's right if we're in the word of if we're not in the word of the age there's no need to worry about anything else you can have all the quotes right you can have all the statements right and still be as lost as anybody can be you see what I talking about this morning if it ain't revealed is a quote and if it's revealed it can be made manifest but if it ain't revealed it can't be made manifest that's senseful so you say but I don't understand cuz you'll say this and you try to make it look like it was the emphasis do you know where you're standing do you know where you're standing no just we're in the message is the message in us come on Brothers come on musicians we appreciate these kids for singing and doing their part really appreciate them but it's part of the work we're having to work on now make a plunt plain plunt we're working on getting another Sunday school class worked in because we got so many kids now until we don't have the room we need another church with 10 Sunday school rooms anybody got the money no so we'll make out what we got so we're going to have to start moving some things around and whether you like it or not it ain't going to be on basis what you like it's going to be on the basis of the best thing that we can do I'm known for being arrogant and hateful somebody's got to do it we were sitting out here at the church one day and we was talking about how to redo inside in here we was all out there eating dinner well there was a bunch of Brothers they was all sitting out there eating away and they were talking about what we was going to do and one w't do it this way one won't do it that way and you'd be surprised what a lot of people can want right after a while he looked around they said where Sam Nanny looked at him and said he's upstairs said he's doing it his way because he's up there doing it yes if I'm going to be responsible I'm going to stay in control like that so if you get your feelings hurt put them in the seat in you Brites and forget it right but we're doing the best we can do to try to work we're going to have to put a locking key on the downstairs part cuz a lot of you bring your food in and thing we're going to have to put a class within that room to where we eat at so then we're going to try to make it the best you can if you come in late if it's very late you'll find a door locked I don't understand that now I don't understand how come people can't be on time I'm going to leave brother Lis out of that cuz they done told me he's never at work on time so then I might as well leave him out of it right Joe where they at where where Richard he's never there what are you Richard's at 5:30 he's there at 10:30 maybe not that late maybe 10 okay 11 oh okay but I don't understand how you can be at work on Monday right on time and you can't get to church all time I don't understand that that's just okay that's beyond me sorry comes I'm always the first one here 90% of the time well that's that's just me I just want to be that one CU I want to serve the Lord he doesn't bother me never bothered me to cut Grace work in the building never never bothered me at all cuz I want to serve the Lord in every capacity that I can if it's warm in a bench I don't want to warm it good I want to do my part for Christ what about you shouldn't that be all of our goal and our ideas and thoughts yes but you just don't understand want to say my husband he's late getting up we'll leave him at home amen amen but my wife on the other side she's always late leave her at home but that's being hateful no I like the way old brother Tom FB told Sister Hazel she's fussing at him said you always going to that church going over here and doing it he said honey he said Sunday morning you have your hand on that door that van and get in you can go with me I said if you don't I'm going on by myself well he come by himself a lot but you know what I had a while she figured out she's going to go with him she'd have to have her hand on that door finally it gets to you don't it let's stand together what we got um no turning back number 477 anybody have a need the AL is open remember sister Anna traveling going up to her sisters and

Lord I want or we're going to give in I want the brother Rand said it will be such an easy thing he said it will think maybe he said multitudes or something easier to go in the framework of organized religion than to not go at Allon he said to believe Satan's lie is to serve Satan no go with me still will I fall oh all we got to do is just not say nothing I do the best I can to not use offy [Music] words you know what as a sinner I never did like to use offensive words de you know I didn't like to make fun of people because of their beliefs or what they wanted to be if I could be that as
