[20:35] had before father we pray in Jesus name
[20:38] amen now we believe that we believe that
[20:42] God is in his Bible amen God is in his
[20:45] word everybody with me all right and we
[20:48] know that God being in his word he gave
[20:50] it to a group of
[20:52] people cuz he said he wouldn't return
[20:54] void so he gave us a Bible he gave us
[20:57] something a standard to go by man's
[20:59] tried to go by other stuff but we have a
[21:01] standard to go by and it's called the
[21:04] Bible all right everybody with me all
[21:06] right so being that then we're going to
[21:07] start we've been starting talking about
[21:09] the church ages in the Book of
[21:11] Revelations and we've been several
[21:12] sermons on it so now we're at the church
[21:15] of Sardis are the sardian church age I
[21:18] want to read you this found this this
[21:19] morning watch happiness cannot be travel
[21:23] to Owned earned worn or consumed
[21:28] happiness is the spiritual experience of
[21:30] living every minute with love Grace and
[21:33] gratitude amen think about that
[21:36] happiness can't be traveled to you can't
[21:37] buy it can't wear
[21:40] it but with love Grace and gratitude
[21:43] you'll have happiness happy people build
[21:46] their own world unhappy people blame
[21:48] other people in the world wow that's
[21:51] profound but let's read Revelations 1:10
[21:54] then you can be seated I know some of
[21:55] you older ones are want to sit down
[21:58] actually the one in the suit in the back
[21:59] Revelations 1:10 says I was in the
[22:02] spirit on the Lord's day now this is
[22:03] John the Revelator and I heard behind me
[22:05] a great voice as of a trumpet saying I
[22:08] am Alpha and Omega the first and the
[22:10] last and what thou seest right in a book
[22:13] and send it unto the seven different
[22:15] churches which are in Asia Ephesus samna
[22:19] pergamus thyra Sardis Philadelphia and
[22:22] Lea now we know for a fact if you read
[22:25] and we're going to get to the lean
[22:26] Church age sometime before the r takes
[22:29] place maybe not I hope not but um we're
[22:31] going to talk about that age that you're
[22:33] sitting in right now cold
[22:37] formal you're neither hot or cold God's
[22:40] going to spew you out of his mouth he
[22:43] stand at the door and
[22:45] knock and I turned to see the voice that
[22:47] spake to me now John turned to see the
[22:48] voice now he heard it as a voice of a
[22:50] trumpet he turned around and he saw
[22:52] somebody he saw a symbol and being
[22:55] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[22:57] and in the midst of the seven
[22:58] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[23:01] man clothed with a garment down to the
[23:04] foot and G about the PS with a golden
[23:07] girdle you may be SE in the Lord as his
[23:08] Blessing I'll read the rest of it here
[23:09] in just a minute but look at the
[23:11] symbolism to this he was gir about the
[23:13] paps which is feminist which is here in
[23:16] other words John is seeing Christ in
[23:18] Bride form because we will not see him
[23:21] until he comes back we meet him in the
[23:23] air and we go into what we go to the
[23:25] wedding supper and then we come back
[23:26] here and live on the earth for a
[23:27] thousand years
[23:28] and that's when we'll see him physically
[23:31] but his body can't be on the earth
[23:33] physically with his bride being here
[23:35] because that would be two bodies he said
[23:37] we're the bride we're the body we're the
[23:39] church we're the one we're the chosen
[23:41] we're the ones that supposed to what
[23:44] portray him so there he is he's telling
[23:47] us he's showing us that there's a person
[23:49] standing there but he's in a form called
[23:51] a bride and we just really believe that
[23:53] we believe that that everybody's not
[23:55] bride I only have one wife
[24:00] God's only got one wife that's right he
[24:02] don't have several he has one he has one
[24:04] wife and we believe that it is his bride
[24:08] down Through the Ages from Paul to today
[24:11] still building that body that body we
[24:14] know that some of them has already gone
[24:15] on and they've done their they've run
[24:18] their race they've lived their life
[24:19] they've done what they're going to
[24:22] do and it was told what they were going
[24:24] to do in the Bible that's right by these
[24:27] seven Church ages because remember there
[24:29] was seven
[24:30] stars in the hand of God so remember
[24:33] that was seven unique people that God
[24:36] used because those were Messengers all
[24:39] right there was one Messenger to every
[24:41] Church age not several God is not the
[24:44] author of confusion he is not the author
[24:46] of anything but Purity and he is
[24:51] precise in what he does cuz he's did we
[24:54] ever not discuss that God don't make a
[24:56] mistake we ever oh that's okay all right
[24:59] right group then he doesn't he doesn't
[25:02] make a mistake at all we must we and if
[25:03] you don't put your faith in that you've
[25:05] lost you're lost cuz we're not going to
[25:08] understand a lot of things that God does
[25:10] that's right but he's perfect but he's
[25:13] Eternal but if you're his child I'm not
[25:15] going to start preaching I'm going to
[25:16] teach Revelation 3 verse1 said to the
[25:19] angel of the church in Sardis now
[25:20] there's an
[25:22] angel a
[25:24] messenger not an angel with wings we
[25:27] don't believe that there's nothing
[25:28] nothing no such thing as angels with
[25:29] wings all right but there are angels but
[25:32] this Angel is a specific Angel this is
[25:34] one that god holds in his hands
[25:36] according to Revelations 1 and he gives
[25:39] that person a message all right and we
[25:42] see that this Angel the church in sest
[25:45] these things sayith he that hath the
[25:46] seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars
[25:50] I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name
[25:53] that thou livest and art
[25:55] Dead all right you got a name that you
[25:57] live by right but you're dead all right
[26:00] we'll we'll look at that in just a
[26:01] minute Be watchful and strengthen the
[26:03] things which remain that are ready to
[26:05] die for I have not found thy works
[26:07] perfect before God all right remember
[26:11] therefore how thou Hast received and
[26:12] hurt and hold fast and repent if
[26:15] therefore Thou shalt not watch I will
[26:16] come on thee as a thief and thou shalt
[26:18] not know what hour I will come upon thee
[26:20] thou Hast a few names even in Sardis
[26:23] which have not defiled their garments or
[26:25] a group of people they took the word of
[26:27] God for day and lived it yes all right
[26:31] lived it all right and they shall walk
[26:33] with men white for they are worthy he
[26:36] that overcometh he shall be clothed in
[26:37] white rment and I will not blot his name
[26:39] out of the book of life but I will
[26:41] confess his name before my father and
[26:43] before his angels he that hath an ear
[26:45] what let him hear what the spirit says
[26:48] not what man says not what the letter in
[26:49] the book says not what you see on TV or
[26:52] come on right you hear what the spirit
[26:55] says to the churches
[26:58] and then we we took this diagram and we
[27:00] see that that it was broke down thank
[27:02] God he sent us a prophet in the end time
[27:04] to tell us these things and to to take
[27:07] all the confusion out I mean I you know
[27:11] we we've been
[27:13] confused and God's not the author of
[27:16] confusion and and Terry's here today and
[27:18] he knows that the methodists they
[27:20] sprinkle the Baptist they baptized well
[27:23] I'll promise you one thing John Westley
[27:25] didn't
[27:26] sprinkle the founder did not sprinkle he
[27:28] baptized so what happened there's a
[27:31] confusion somewhere between that and
[27:33] today all right thereby with me they did
[27:36] not teach a baptism in the name of the
[27:39] father Son and Holy Ghost until the
[27:41] Catholic Church did it right we proved
[27:44] that the other day we believe that right
[27:46] it was in the name of the Lord Jesus
[27:48] find me one place in the Bible you got a
[27:50] Bible in front of you find me one place
[27:52] where any person was ever baptized other
[27:54] than the name of the Lord Jesus or Jesus
[27:56] Christ in the Bible amen not one person
[27:59] that's right so what was Paul confused
[28:01] or was Peter confused no they had
[28:04] Clarity Father Son and Holy Ghost is not
[28:06] names amen I'm a father today I'm a son
[28:10] and I'm a spirit but what am I I'm
[28:12] Samuel wayale II I have a name and now
[28:14] you identifi that name with me so the
[28:17] same way with the Lord Jesus he said
[28:19] baptized in the name of the father and
[28:21] of the son and of the Holy Ghost Peter
[28:23] comes on the day of Pentecost he's got
[28:24] the keys yes sir he's got the keys Jesus
[28:27] said you've got the keys whatever you
[28:28] open I'll open in heaven whatever you
[28:31] bind I'll bind it in heaven Peter had
[28:32] the keys now Peter goes over there and
[28:34] unlocks the door and I was thinking the
[28:35] other day brother colie you know there
[28:37] was there was the other of course Judas
[28:39] had already hung himself by the time
[28:41] they got to Pentecost to the upper room
[28:44] but then you got the other
[28:45] 11 you got 11 Peter plus 10 and they
[28:49] didn't argue with Peter they got that
[28:52] same
[28:53] Revelation they didn't argue with Peter
[28:55] I never seen that till the other day
[28:56] thank God they didn't say now Peter hold
[28:58] on hold on Peter now I heard Jesus
[29:01] say they knew exactly what Jesus said he
[29:04] said in the name the Bible says the
[29:06] whole family in Heaven and Earth got a
[29:08] what a name Jesus Christ and we're mes
[29:12] Jesus Christ that's why we're not a
[29:15] denomination we don't believe in them
[29:16] I'm sorry but they're just they're dead
[29:18] they're formal
[29:20] cold so are we
[29:22] sometimes come on so I'm not preaching
[29:25] to these walls I'm preaching to
[29:26] everybody right but there was Paul was
[29:29] the first church age messenger we
[29:31] established that irenius was the second
[29:33] Martin was the third Columba was the
[29:35] fourth Church age messenger and Martin
[29:37] Luther the one we're talking about now
[29:39] the Lutheran are the are the um um
[29:43] Luther Luther come in and then Wesley
[29:46] which is the wesleyian doctrine or are
[29:48] the Methodist Doctrine and we'll get
[29:50] into that next Sunday how that that
[29:52] Methodist came about is because John
[29:55] Wesley established a method of worship
[29:59] all right he had he had a method of
[30:02] worshiping but now here we come and we
[30:04] see that according to
[30:07] history there in that middle Church age
[30:09] with where it says Columba we know that
[30:13] the Catholic Church according to Nia we
[30:16] read the book you read up some of you
[30:18] read it too the Nan Council they went to
[30:21] that council with a man that was
[30:25] supposed to be the great guy named
[30:27] Constantine and he was going to bring
[30:28] church and state together and he did and
[30:30] he gave them power and gave them power
[30:33] so much till they killed 68 million
[30:36] Christians the Roman Catholic Church
[30:38] they will tell you they killed that many
[30:40] read Fox's book of martyr they killed 68
[30:43] million Christians because they would
[30:45] not convert to
[30:47] Catholicism all right everybody with me
[30:49] on that so now what did Martin Luther do
[30:52] now Martin Luther was a Catholic he was
[30:55] a he was a monk he went into the
[30:57] monastery he studied the the Church of
[31:00] Rome he he went with some of their
[31:02] things all right I say things they
[31:04] doctrines they went he went with some of
[31:06] that but then God got a hold of him one
[31:08] day and showed him that the just shall
[31:11] live by faith not by Penance not by
[31:13] dragging yourself down the street not by
[31:16] not by beating your head up against a
[31:17] wall but the just shall live by faith
[31:21] all right is everybody with me on that
[31:23] all right and that's this is total
[31:24] history okay so let's get started
[31:28] now we know one thing for sure when we
[31:30] look in the Bible when it says woman we
[31:33] know that means Church all right so now
[31:36] what is a female supposed to do
[31:38] according to Paul setting up the
[31:42] headship she's to be subjective to her
[31:45] husband not a
[31:47] doormat but subjected to her husband
[31:50] because our head is Christ all right
[31:55] Christ is the head we're the body but we
[31:58] The Head and the woman the female is the
[32:00] weaker vessel or we're going to talk
[32:03] about a little bit about this though
[32:05] that when they change roles they become
[32:07] a dominating female and we see that
[32:09] because what happens in in the Catholic
[32:12] Church they have as we looked before
[32:16] they um they elevate Mary and put Jesus
[32:20] down read it it's called
[32:23] mariology pray to Mary because she's
[32:25] really nice and sweet don't pray to
[32:27] Jesus he he's he's
[32:29] mean that's
[32:31] garbage Mary didn't resurrect Mary
[32:34] didn't Ascend Mary had to go to
[32:35] Pentecost to get the Holy Ghost all
[32:37] right so we're not going to talk about
[32:40] that
[32:40] foolishness but the female somehow
[32:43] became dominant like Eve did in the
[32:45] garden she took Satan's lie over her
[32:48] husband's truth everybody with me so
[32:51] that created something to that it's a
[32:54] pattern that there when you become a
[32:55] dominating female then God departs from
[32:59] you all right now look the Bible says in
[33:02] first Timothy says but she she that
[33:05] liveth in pleasure is dead while she
[33:09] liveth oh I we listen this is life man
[33:13] we get to go do whatever we can drink
[33:15] smoke cuss we can do whatever we want to
[33:17] do that's the
[33:19] life that's
[33:21] death she that liveth in pleasure is
[33:24] dead while she
[33:25] liveth she that liveth out inside the
[33:28] word of God is
[33:30] dead spiritually dead you may be as
[33:32] alive as I'm standing here today but
[33:34] spiritually As Dead As a door knob cuz
[33:38] God will not dwell in an unclean vessel
[33:40] God will not take the garbage of the
[33:42] world he wants us to what he wants us to
[33:45] conform to His Image
[33:48] not not him conform to ours that's what
[33:52] everybody wants in this end time they
[33:53] want everybody to conform to their image
[33:55] whatever they you know pride month and
[33:57] all these different they want you to
[33:59] conform to their image no Jesus said
[34:01] conform to my image cuz somebody told me
[34:04] one time that God was
[34:06] perfect okay all right just want to make
[34:08] sure I still live
[34:09] everybody and he doesn't make mistakes
[34:12] right he didn't have to change his Bible
[34:14] the Mormons had to change their several
[34:15] hundred times but God will never have to
[34:17] change his Bible it was perfect when he
[34:19] started it he wrote it before the
[34:20] foundation of the world everybody with
[34:22] me yes sir okay cuz the Bible said he
[34:25] stood as a lamb slain before yes sir the
[34:28] foundation of the world so now let's
[34:30] look and see I know this may be strange
[34:32] to some
[34:34] but we believe that God opened the Seven
[34:37] Seals in the end time so that we can see
[34:40] what was behind them when you see
[34:42] something sealed up that means that you
[34:44] can't see what's inside but there must
[34:46] be something inside that's important or
[34:48] you wouldn't seal it up listen if if
[34:50] there wasn't like your gun cabinet you
[34:52] don't put your gun cabinet in the living
[34:53] room with no doors on
[34:55] it you seal it so that no one can get
[34:58] what's in behind there all right so God
[35:01] sealed this up till the end time because
[35:03] he said he said many times he said I'll
[35:05] restore I'm going to do this I'm going
[35:08] to give you Revelation I'm going to show
[35:10] you mystery Paul said there's a
[35:12] mystery which is Christ in you the hope
[35:14] of glory and we see that now manifesting
[35:17] itself to a bride of Jesus Christ so the
[35:20] opening of the first two seals when that
[35:22] seal opened there was a Ministry loose
[35:24] now many people I say many people
[35:28] many
[35:29] denominations do not see this because
[35:32] the Seal's not been open to them I I saw
[35:35] when the lamb opened one of the seals so
[35:37] now he's fixing to open something I'm
[35:38] going try to slow down just a minute
[35:41] this is not going to be a 15-minute
[35:42] method of sermon I'm promise you that
[35:45] y'all are used
[35:46] to yeah M and I heard if you need to
[35:50] take a break go take a break as it were
[35:52] the noise of Thunder one of the four
[35:54] beasts now who what's he talking about
[35:56] this is John John joh was commissioned
[35:58] to write what he saw he saw the lamb so
[36:02] he saw Jesus Christ standing in a
[36:05] position and he was going to tear the
[36:07] seal off that's what the Bible says and
[36:10] he heard the noise of Thunder one of the
[36:11] four Beast so something else come into
[36:13] view to John yes now we see this it
[36:18] correlates back to the Book of Ezekiel
[36:20] where you see the four living creatures
[36:22] in several other places in the Bible one
[36:25] had the face of a lion one had the face
[36:26] of an ox one had the face of a man one
[36:28] had the face of a flying eagle and those
[36:31] were the four powers are beast that are
[36:35] in you and me today by the Holy Ghost it
[36:37] helps us overcome the line of the tribe
[36:39] of Judah the ox that the labor that that
[36:42] does the work you know go to work and do
[36:44] your job and and labor in the Lord and
[36:46] wonder why we're still
[36:48] here and then the man intelligence not
[36:51] intelligence of man intelligence of God
[36:54] to know what's right and wrong to know
[36:55] if a man says something you go that
[36:57] ain't nothing but the truth or I don't
[36:58] believe that amen and then the Flying
[37:02] Eagle is up so high till till man can't
[37:05] get there other birds can't get there so
[37:08] we had a
[37:09] lion an ox a man and an
[37:12] eagle according to Ezekiel in the end
[37:15] time because the son of man is supposed
[37:18] to be here Jesus Christ is supposed to
[37:19] be here in our flesh today is everybody
[37:22] with me amen don't lock up you can say
[37:24] amen I know y'all believe
[37:25] that okay so one of the four Beast says
[37:29] come and see John come here I want to
[37:31] show you something what was it it was
[37:33] the Holy Ghost in John but what did John
[37:35] do John was only commissioned to write
[37:36] what he saw right all right and I saw
[37:41] and behold a white horse looks kind of
[37:43] pretty doesn't it and he that sat on him
[37:45] had a bow and a crown was given unto him
[37:50] and he went forth conquering him to
[37:52] conquer everybody with me yes all right
[37:55] so this looks really good but if you dig
[37:58] in a little bit further you see that he
[38:01] has a bow but no arrows
[38:04] right how many of you would go hunting
[38:06] without your bullets let's go all go
[38:09] bear hunting let's go grizzly bear
[38:11] hunting brother Tim and and we're not
[38:13] going to take any bullets we're just
[38:14] going to take a gun or we're going to
[38:16] take a bow but we're not going to take
[38:17] any Arrows with
[38:18] us no so this man right here must be
[38:21] crazy he must be anti come on he must be
[38:25] a bluff yes sir cuz he's Bluff ing the
[38:27] people so it's not almighty God he
[38:29] doesn't Bluff he tells you straight and
[38:31] that's what it's going to be amen so
[38:33] whoever this person is a white horse and
[38:35] he that sat on him had a boat which had
[38:39] to be the devil because the devil's the
[38:40] biggest deceiver there ever was he knows
[38:43] how to deceive don't try to deceive him
[38:45] cuz he's already got you deceived right
[38:47] and a crown was given unto him so he was
[38:50] given a crown and he went forth
[38:52] conquering into conquer so in the first
[38:54] three Church ages he bluffed his way
[38:56] into the true now there was a true white
[38:59] righteous church we realize that from
[39:01] Paul Paul wrote 80% of the Bible that's
[39:04] why I have a problem with people I have
[39:06] a problem with people saying well you
[39:08] believe this you you've got you believe
[39:09] this man William Brandon was a prophet
[39:11] yeah I do he's he's identifying the
[39:16] Bible but if we quote Paul it's okay but
[39:18] if we quote him it's not
[39:21] okay if we quote Billy Graham it's okay
[39:23] but we quot will Bram is not okay no
[39:30] sorry I'm quoting Paul right now I'm
[39:34] quoting what John saw right now
[39:37] amen but the he bluffed his way into the
[39:40] true church there was a true church in
[39:41] the in the beginning and what happened
[39:43] was Satan got in with just a little
[39:45] saying like do you really believe that
[39:48] that um you know God God God couldn't be
[39:52] God and Jesus couldn't be the same
[39:54] person we saw Jesus he cried he had to
[39:57] go to bathroom and he hungered and and
[40:00] uh he he got angry that can't be God oh
[40:03] that's a light substance of God so they
[40:05] pulled him apart they said well the Holy
[40:07] Ghost has got to be a third person so
[40:09] here we are with a trinity not even in
[40:11] the Bible anywhere listen it's so easy
[40:14] to realize behold oh Israel your God is
[40:19] one and he has many manifestations of
[40:22] father son Holy Ghost healer savior
[40:25] revealer he's all those he's my husband
[40:28] he's my he's my God but he's only one
[40:31] person you're not going to heaven and
[40:33] see three people come on are three
[40:36] personalities that's schizophrenia my
[40:39] God's Not schizophrenic my God's one now
[40:42] he does in morphe into different forms
[40:46] right now I'm looking at his last name
[40:48] morphe it's in his bride you're not
[40:50] going to see Jesus Christ anywhere
[40:52] except in his bride those that have the
[40:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul
[40:56] does what the Bible tells them to do
[41:00] amen yes sir with no
[41:04] compromise but that was a saying went
[41:06] out in the first couple of church ages
[41:08] that white horse rider he rode you know
[41:10] Satan didn't Satan today is not in the
[41:16] barroom he got here before you
[41:18] did and he's sitting right beside
[41:22] you are with
[41:25] you so Satan's religious
[41:28] very he's a second to God he's a worship
[41:31] Angel he doesn't look he ain't red with
[41:34] a with a forky tail now he may have a
[41:36] forky tongue but he's the most beautiful
[41:39] angel that God made he made Satan
[41:42] beautiful so you look at this we're
[41:44] going to see in a minute that John saw
[41:46] this sorry we speak plain here
[41:49] because that's what the Bible says we
[41:50] saw he saw this he admired her so
[41:53] much the angel had to say John um get
[41:55] away from that yeah right yeah cuz it
[41:58] was so beautiful look at churches
[42:00] they're
[42:02] beautiful all the colors and tapestries
[42:05] and gold and silver and all this stuff
[42:08] the Catholic church just throws all that
[42:09] out there and makes you you know kind
[42:12] like
[42:14] Hollywood give me an
[42:16] oldfashioned preacher that knows the
[42:19] word of God I don't care if you preaches
[42:22] here or on the corner
[42:25] somewhere so that white
[42:27] righteous
[42:29] church was infiltrated by a white
[42:32] righteous
[42:34] impostor he wanted to look just like it
[42:36] remember he said in the Bible I want to
[42:37] be like the most I want to be God yes I
[42:39] want to be the one and and then God
[42:42] tells us in the church agent he says you
[42:43] ought to know where Satan's seed is the
[42:46] Satan's seed is not in the barroom Satan
[42:48] seed's in
[42:50] church and he wants to infiltrate here
[42:53] he's got them out there he wants to
[42:55] infiltrate us yes as Believers come on
[42:59] come on but praise God if you're sealed
[43:01] by the holy ghost in your soul he can't
[43:03] touch you he can play with your body all
[43:05] he wants to remember he did with job
[43:08] right but remember through that tragedy
[43:12] became a man that we see and talk about
[43:14] Job even from 5,000 6,000 years ago we
[43:17] still talk about job that went through a
[43:19] tragedy and made it through and come out
[43:21] on the other side twice as good as he
[43:23] was before all right so we think our
[43:26] problems are like that you didn't lose
[43:27] all seven kids and all your house and
[43:29] all your whole living and everything and
[43:31] have boils from the head of your feet
[43:33] from your head to your feet joob did but
[43:36] you know what he said he said I know my
[43:37] redeemer liveth yes sir and in the last
[43:40] day I'll stand on my feet and I'll see
[43:43] him for myself what a
[43:47] revelation so when he had opened the
[43:49] second seal so now we see the lamb he's
[43:50] opening another seal up I heard the
[43:53] second beast so another Beast comes
[43:55] which is the ox which is the the labor
[43:57] or the one that does the works says come
[44:00] and see and there went out another horse
[44:03] so there was a white horse rode out with
[44:06] a man on it then there's now is a red
[44:09] horse and pile was given to him that sat
[44:11] on that horse to take peace from the
[44:14] earth yeah and that they should kill one
[44:17] another and there was given unto him a
[44:18] great sword now the the first time he he
[44:20] saw that it was a bow with no arrows he
[44:23] was a bluff he couldn't do anything it's
[44:25] like Brother Gary Atkins always said he
[44:26] said he said Satan has no Arrow to shoot
[44:30] at you but you give him a whole bunch to
[44:32] shoot at you every day we give them to
[44:35] it yes
[44:37] sir everybody all right the Bible says
[44:41] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[44:43] how powerful is
[44:44] that didn't seem like much but it's
[44:47] pretty powerful and power was given to
[44:49] him that sat on to take peace from the
[44:51] earth and that they should kill one
[44:54] another he's going to be so much into
[44:56] these people well they going to hate
[44:57] each other now right and there was given
[45:01] unto him a great sword now we know what
[45:02] a sword means in the Bible it means a
[45:04] word yes so he was given a word he was
[45:07] given something that he wanted the
[45:09] people to live by and he made it so
[45:13] outstanding like Constantine we we read
[45:16] about him in the in the U in the history
[45:19] books and he's this great man worst
[45:21] thing ever
[45:22] happened he joined church and state
[45:25] together took down a pilus and put up
[45:28] Paul took down this and put up that they
[45:30] started worshiping
[45:31] Mary we saw through these Church ages
[45:34] remember every Church age every city
[45:35] that we mentioned there was a there was
[45:38] worship of a
[45:40] woman worship of a woman is what did
[45:43] away with their
[45:45] power and then here then here the
[45:48] Catholic Church brings Mary up and
[45:50] elevates her to a
[45:54] god well they'll get theirs and there
[45:57] was given to him a great store so now
[45:58] he's got a word he's got a word to say
[46:01] now so he's going to what he's going to
[46:02] start killing with that word let's read
[46:06] here just a
[46:07] second where the Prophet tells us the
[46:09] second calf was what it was a calf like
[46:13] Beast the first was a Lon the next was
[46:15] an ox all right when the lamb opened the
[46:17] seal so let's continue on so a red horse
[46:19] goes forward now what is red red is
[46:22] blood he rode that horse in the ox age
[46:25] which is that middle Church age which is
[46:27] the age of they call it the Dark Ages or
[46:31] the age that where that there was Roman
[46:34] rule over everything and they would kill
[46:38] you they killed
[46:40] Christians they put crosses on their
[46:42] back they said they were on a crusade
[46:44] the only Crusade they were doing was was
[46:46] killing true Christians because they
[46:48] wasn't conformed to the Catholic church
[46:50] and let me tell you something they're
[46:52] killing billions of people now
[46:54] spiritually by the same identical thing
[46:57] Satan is just hid now he's got out of
[46:59] that killing over there in the red now
[47:01] he's over here and he's going let's all
[47:04] be one let's all come
[47:07] together oh let's all be
[47:10] one divide and
[47:14] conquer they'll get
[47:16] theirs they're going to kill each other
[47:19] now he had a bow with no arrows but he
[47:22] has a great sword now he done his
[47:24] killing later and changed from White
[47:26] Horse to Red the same Devil with a sword
[47:28] now and red is what like I said red is
[47:31] blood now he's got a sword in his hand
[47:33] riding red waiting through the blood of
[47:35] every 68
[47:38] million you take the what was it Josh C
[47:42] State of California the state of Texas
[47:44] two of the biggest states in the United
[47:45] States there 68 million people lives in
[47:47] those two states you wipe those two
[47:49] states completely out that's how many
[47:51] people the Catholic Church killed during
[47:53] that 900 years of persecution that's how
[47:56] many they killed you think the Jews
[47:57] killed 6 million or the the Germans
[47:59] killed 6 million Jews in in four years
[48:02] 900 years 68 million people were killed
[48:06] because the Catholic Church says you
[48:07] either do this or you
[48:11] die they'll get theirs John saw her over
[48:14] there a little bit further riding on a
[48:16] Scarlet colored Beast with a cup full of
[48:19] the blood of the Mars of the Saints
[48:22] she'll be she'll be giving her
[48:24] reward the riter and all his Kingdom
[48:27] subjects that are slain down Through the
[48:28] Ages that's draw all this Blood of the
[48:30] martyrs of the Saints will be slain By
[48:32] The Sword of Jesus Christ when he comes
[48:34] and praise God we can draw a sword now
[48:36] and we can get those people out of that
[48:38] delusion we've got several people
[48:40] sitting here that were in the Catholic
[48:42] Church they know what's going
[48:44] on and they saw a light and got out
[48:48] amen but now
[48:50] remember she had
[48:53] daughters she had prostitutes she had
[48:56] daughters that took her same
[49:01] name the only difference in the Catholic
[49:04] church and all the other denominations
[49:05] is is they say that it's what that
[49:08] transubstantiation that when they give
[49:10] the when they give the communion it
[49:12] turns into the literal body of Jesus you
[49:14] know they get people to believe
[49:15] that that the priest by some power he's
[49:18] got can take that wafer look it up
[49:21] Google it he takes that wafer and when
[49:24] he puts it on your tongue that turns
[49:25] into the literal body body of
[49:28] Jesus and they believe
[49:33] that there a lot of things they believe
[49:35] but that's one I don't think I'd ever
[49:36] believe uh Sister Jesse I don't know if
[49:38] God could you know God can get you out
[49:40] of that but Satan what a
[49:42] delusion what a delusion and to say that
[49:45] the pope has more power than Jesus
[49:47] Christ to be able to change whatever he
[49:48] wants to change start a war and end of
[49:52] War but remember he's got daughters he's
[49:54] got people in his system that are
[49:56] working in the same way yes all right so
[50:00] let's skip through here a little bit
[50:01] more let's look at the sardian church
[50:03] age just for a second he said I Know Thy
[50:06] works I know your Works amen that thou
[50:09] has a name what that thou livest and art
[50:11] dead they took on
[50:17] names for I've not found thy works
[50:20] perfect before
[50:23] God but there are a few people that made
[50:25] it through that church age there are a
[50:27] few people even though the 68 million
[50:29] that were killed in that other Church
[50:31] age that came into this sardian church
[50:34] age there was a few people left that
[50:36] held on to the true word of God they
[50:38] held on to what God has said not what
[50:41] man has said all right and you're going
[50:44] to overcome look you'll be clothed in
[50:45] white rment praise God and I will not
[50:48] blot his name out of the book of life
[50:50] you know there was a name that was
[50:51] blotted out of the book of life you know
[50:52] that don't you man's name was Judas
[50:55] Bible said his name was BL it out but
[50:57] yours can if you're in the Eternal
[50:59] section of the Book of Life yours never
[51:01] will cuz actually you're the
[51:04] book remember the old saying I can read
[51:06] you like
[51:07] a Bible says written Epistles known and
[51:10] read of all men your life is a book
[51:13] that's why when we live out there we
[51:14] live different we're not like the world
[51:17] we don't mingle with the world we have
[51:19] to go to
[51:21] Walmart okay so we don't have to but we
[51:24] go but um
[51:27] but we don't mingle with
[51:29] them listen God is a separator abolutely
[51:33] he said separate yourself from unbelief
[51:36] and I'm going to read your scripture
[51:37] here in just a minute where he says come
[51:38] out of her her a church come out of her
[51:41] my people my people yes
[51:45] sir I'll read it to you in just a minute
[51:47] so the word Sardis means the Escape ones
[51:49] there were some that escaped out of that
[51:51] Jezebel religion that came up in the
[51:54] Catholic church that you worshiped woman
[51:57] all right you're worshiping a
[52:00] woman it's called a doctrine of
[52:02] mariolatry and what it is is that they
[52:05] elevate her and you worship her and you
[52:07] don't worship Jesus cuz she's nicer than
[52:09] he is if you don't believe it ask
[52:11] somebody you ask the Catholic who do you
[52:13] pray to they'll say we pray to
[52:16] Mary
[52:18] wow but now watch Martin Luther praise
[52:21] God stood up and said I'm not going to
[52:24] deal with that no more amen God filled
[52:27] him with the Holy Ghost in that
[52:31] Monastery by
[52:33] telling well actually what happened was
[52:35] it it let me give you a real short
[52:37] summation of Luther Luther was a
[52:39] Catholic Luther was in this monastery
[52:41] Luther was doing Penance Luther was
[52:43] dragging himself across the the um um
[52:47] Cobblestone and and and you know
[52:50] whacking himself with those little
[52:52] things that they have and he wasn't
[52:54] getting anywhere he still was oh man
[52:57] that I
[52:57] am but one day he was take he took the
[53:01] Bible he learned Latin he was a German
[53:03] he learned Latin so the Latin Vulgate is
[53:06] where the Catholic church has the Bible
[53:09] written during the Dark Ages it's
[53:10] written in Latin so you can't understand
[53:13] it what about going to church and
[53:15] listening to somebody preach and don't
[53:16] even know the word they said that's what
[53:18] they do they may change now but that's
[53:21] what they do that's what they have been
[53:22] doing because we've got the truth and
[53:25] you just listen no I want you to have
[53:27] the truth yourself please do not build
[53:29] yourself on a man you better build
[53:31] yourself on one man Jesus Christ you
[53:33] better not build yourself on your
[53:34] neighbor or your friend or your mama
[53:36] your daddy you got to have your own
[53:38] experience with God and that experience
[53:41] will take you to the word of God every
[53:43] single time have I ever preached to
[53:45] y'all that God's perfect oh don't make
[53:47] mistakes come on okay he does not that's
[53:51] right we must conform to His
[53:54] Image this is his image the only image
[53:57] we got is this have anybody ever seen
[54:01] Jesus no he's in
[54:04] here you've never seen him in person you
[54:07] might have seen him in a vision you
[54:08] might have seen him in a
[54:10] picture but You' never seen the physical
[54:12] man cuz he said I'm going to go away he
[54:15] said but I'm going to come back what he
[54:16] do he IMM morphed into the Holy Ghost
[54:20] and give itself out and divided itself
[54:22] among the people Jesus standing on Earth
[54:25] he was one man
[54:27] if the devil would have left him alone
[54:28] he'd have died a man just an old guy but
[54:31] Satan had to kill him to get you and me
[54:34] out of there oh when that side opened up
[54:36] you and I rushed out the Holy Ghost came
[54:39] out and came on 120 on the day of
[54:41] Pentecost we still believe in the
[54:43] Pentecostal experience
[54:45] amen and on the day of Pentecost he
[54:48] divided himself into 120 people so Satan
[54:51] didn't have to fight just one Jesus he
[54:53] fought 121 jesuses then on the day that
[54:56] same day that was 3,000 little jesuses
[54:58] that were birth listen we're M Jesus
[55:01] Christ we're him yes made manifest in
[55:03] another form called a bride he's imorph
[55:05] into the bride that's why we act
[55:07] different that's why we talk different
[55:09] that's why we dress
[55:10] different that's right
[55:13] amen we don't dress different cuz
[55:15] somebody told us the Bible tells us
[55:17] that's why I told that sister the other
[55:18] day I said look if you tell me in the
[55:20] Bible show me the Bible where you can
[55:22] cut your hair
[55:26] I can show you where Paul said that your
[55:28] hair was your glory and and the
[55:30] translation the original translation is
[55:31] uncut hair we know that and we know that
[55:34] the hair is our glory and we do those
[55:36] things because of what like June said
[55:38] many times she said if if if Jesus
[55:41] Christ could hang on the cross for three
[55:42] hours and die literally
[55:46] die God died in the flesh God can't die
[55:48] but God died in that flesh that flesh
[55:51] was dead if he can hang there for three
[55:53] hours for me I can do what he said by
[55:55] not cut in my hair I can do what he said
[55:58] by wearing clothes that don't wear
[56:01] pertain clothes pertaining to a man you
[56:03] so that's Old Testament so is so so is
[56:05] The Ten
[56:06] Commandments
[56:08] amen I've had that and throw it at me
[56:10] too well that's the Old Testament well
[56:11] so is the 10 commandments so don't take
[56:13] them off your
[56:14] wall listen either throw it all out or
[56:16] live it all one of the two
[56:21] amen as Luther crystallized the doctrine
[56:24] of justification by faith nothing you
[56:27] done not by works lest any man should
[56:29] boast nothing you and I are saved by the
[56:32] grace of God the faith that we put in
[56:34] him that he's already done it for us
[56:36] he's already died that's the only way
[56:38] you can be
[56:40] justified Bible says justify freely it's
[56:43] a free gift it's free for you to have
[56:47] it's not something you have to pay you
[56:48] don't have to pay
[56:51] penants and if you come to church
[56:53] because you have to you're paying
[56:54] pennant
[56:57] cuz you think I got to go because
[56:59] somebody will say no I want to come here
[57:02] sir I want to do this on Sunday that was
[57:05] a time I didn't that was a time you
[57:08] didn't there a time we ran on
[57:12] Sunday I told you many times my Mama
[57:15] Tried to save me but where'd that piece
[57:16] of paper
[57:17] go oh my Mama Tried to save me but she
[57:21] can't right Jesus Christ is the only
[57:24] salvation there is
[57:26] no other man no other
[57:29] name see there there's the name there's
[57:31] no other name whereby you must be saved
[57:34] and that's Jesus Christ but it's not
[57:36] just Jesus Christ now that hung on the
[57:38] cross died went into a tomb came out
[57:41] praise the Lord
[57:44] hallelujah he's alive today yes sir in a
[57:47] group of Believers cuz he said I'll be
[57:49] with you and in you I'm going to come
[57:51] back I pray father that they be one as
[57:53] we're one how was Jesus and God one they
[57:56] weren't two they were one yes Jesus was
[58:00] an amorphia of God yes to save your soul
[58:04] cuz God can't die Jesus had to Jesus had
[58:07] to die that body had to die to release
[58:11] the life inside of it to release me and
[58:13] you watch the song when he was on the
[58:15] cross what I was on his mind I was his
[58:18] very
[58:20] heart the Bible says we're engraved in
[58:22] the palms of his hand well praise God
[58:24] when that nail went through that finger
[58:26] when that went through that hand it went
[58:28] through my name I don't know about you
[58:30] went through mine you got to you got to
[58:31] say it went through
[58:34] yours but there's more to it than just
[58:36] that it Jesus said what he said I'll be
[58:40] in you with you in even in you and he
[58:43] said in one place he said and I'll show
[58:45] you things to come I'll give you more
[58:47] Revelation than anybody's everever got
[58:50] Paul said there's Mysteries there's
[58:51] great mysteries in this Bible that
[58:53] people have not even tapped into too but
[58:56] you and I have when no seals open we saw
[59:01] that Satan was a master deceiver we saw
[59:05] where he was he was in the church he
[59:06] wasn't in the
[59:11] barroom and there's only two
[59:14] Spirits God and Satan there's no other
[59:17] there's no other uh there's just
[59:19] two belief or
[59:22] doubt so now listen
[59:26] Luther crystallized the doctrine of
[59:28] justification by faith they held the
[59:30] works penants prayers other unscriptural
[59:32] means and as the freed Christians
[59:35] glorified the son that's us the Roman
[59:38] Catholics increased their deification of
[59:40] Mary until the 20th century saw in
[59:42] opposition to most ranking Roman
[59:44] theologies Pope Pi literally exalted
[59:46] Mary to glorification in a resurrected
[59:49] body you know they believe Mary
[59:50] resurrected just like Jesus
[59:56] that Doctrine is absolutely babylonius
[59:58] one of the son carrying the mother
[59:59] bodily into heaven which was Pagan if we
[1:00:02] look at all these Pagan ideas we know
[1:00:04] that the Catholic church and the Pagan
[1:00:06] ideas are just exactly the same and they
[1:00:08] swallow that but you know what they do
[1:00:11] they make it so
[1:00:12] beautiful this may not be beautiful to
[1:00:14] some people this may be just
[1:00:18] plain couple of songs and
[1:00:21] worship get a little loud every once in
[1:00:24] a while
[1:00:26] but this is what God
[1:00:28] wants this is what God wants he do want
[1:00:30] that he he didn't want that he wants
[1:00:32] this the Martin Luther was German he was
[1:00:35] a priest Theologian he wrote hymns he
[1:00:39] was a frier but what he done though was
[1:00:42] he
[1:00:43] started the Protestant movement or the
[1:00:46] Protestant
[1:00:48] Reformation all right or what does that
[1:00:50] mean Protestant means protest he
[1:00:53] literally stood against a worldwide at
[1:00:56] that time religion called
[1:00:59] Catholicism he was part of the system
[1:01:02] but he came out and he's one of the most
[1:01:04] influential figures in Western and
[1:01:06] Christian history this is a letter he
[1:01:08] wrote to the Pope the first and chief
[1:01:10] article is this now this is this is the
[1:01:13] pope he's God to them right everybody
[1:01:16] with me so you don't question
[1:01:19] him you don't question the Pope the
[1:01:22] first and chief article is this Jesus
[1:01:23] Christ Our God and Lord died for our
[1:01:26] sins and was raised again for our
[1:01:27] justification Romans 3 he alone is the
[1:01:30] Lamb of God who takes away the sins of
[1:01:32] the world John 1 and God has laid on him
[1:01:35] the iniquity of us all in Isaiah all
[1:01:38] have sinned and are Justified freely
[1:01:41] without their own works and merits about
[1:01:44] this time Pope P's face is turning so
[1:01:47] red cuz this guy is going against
[1:01:50] everything that he
[1:01:54] upholds and when without the without the
[1:01:57] the the hand of God they would have
[1:01:59] killed Martin Luther cuz they were they
[1:02:00] sent out to kill him right after he sent
[1:02:02] this letter out but they couldn't find
[1:02:04] him he actually went to a castle and
[1:02:07] lived in a castle deep in a big old
[1:02:09] castle somewhere over there in Germany
[1:02:11] he lived over there in a castle for
[1:02:12] several years and and actually put the
[1:02:14] Bible together during that time they
[1:02:16] couldn't find him they had assassins out
[1:02:18] want to kill Martin well he went he went
[1:02:21] against their God right this is necess
[1:02:24] now look
[1:02:26] all have sinned and are Justified freely
[1:02:28] without their own merits and works by
[1:02:30] his grace through the Redemption that is
[1:02:32] in Christ Jesus in his blood this is
[1:02:34] necessary to believe well he's fixing to
[1:02:38] get it now this cannot be otherwise
[1:02:40] acquired or grasped by any work law or
[1:02:43] Merit or beads or whatever you know
[1:02:45] buying a candle and all that other stuff
[1:02:46] they
[1:02:48] do therefore it is clear and certain
[1:02:51] that this faith alone justifies us well
[1:02:54] he's coming against the pope now
[1:02:56] nothing of this Artic article can be
[1:02:58] yielded or surrendered you see what kind
[1:03:01] of stand he took can we take that same
[1:03:07] stand even though Heaven and Earth and
[1:03:09] everything else
[1:03:11] Falls then he wrote a letter to his
[1:03:13] followers in these sermons he hammered
[1:03:15] home the primary the pracy of core
[1:03:18] Christian Valu such as love patience
[1:03:20] charity freedom and reminded the
[1:03:21] citizens to trust God's word rather than
[1:03:24] violence to bring about NE necessary
[1:03:29] change let's go to Romans 1:1 17 and
[1:03:31] we'll finish right
[1:03:33] here we'll finish the rest this
[1:03:35] afternoon Romans 1 ver1 17 for therein
[1:03:37] is the righteousness of God now this
[1:03:40] listen the people put yourself back in
[1:03:43] that like third or fourth Church age
[1:03:45] where there was no print and press there
[1:03:46] was no all you had was verbiage if
[1:03:48] somebody preached something you you
[1:03:51] heard what they said and if somebody
[1:03:53] else wasn't there they had to tell them
[1:03:54] what he said there was no recorders
[1:03:56] there not like we're recording going
[1:03:58] around the country right now recording
[1:04:00] we're recording and we're live streaming
[1:04:02] both all right wasn't like that but when
[1:04:06] Martin Luther takes that Latin vgate and
[1:04:08] he starts translating what you see now
[1:04:11] as the Bible into German first so he
[1:04:14] could read it and then later on tendale
[1:04:17] did it for the English people and you
[1:04:19] know what they did the tendale they drug
[1:04:20] him through the street and killed him
[1:04:22] cuz he put the Bible together that was a
[1:04:23] Catholic they didn't want you to have
[1:04:24] this
[1:04:26] cuz you'd know truth if you had
[1:04:28] this Jesus said the truth will set you
[1:04:32] free so I can I can see just for a
[1:04:35] moment before we close here's Martin
[1:04:37] Luther he's dragging himself along and
[1:04:41] if you watch the movie you see me I mean
[1:04:43] just he just beats himself up every bad
[1:04:46] thought he has every everything you know
[1:04:49] he just can't get he he just condemned
[1:04:52] God hates me I do all this bad and and
[1:04:55] and you know even Paul had that problem
[1:04:57] Paul said the things I do I would not
[1:04:59] the things I do I would not oh this
[1:05:00] Wretched Man that I am all right we've
[1:05:03] had our conversation in times past and
[1:05:05] this guy right here amen is everybody
[1:05:07] with me but God wants to look at your
[1:05:10] soul he
[1:05:12] doesn't he doesn't save your
[1:05:15] body he said I come to save your soul
[1:05:18] amen but your soul is going to tell your
[1:05:20] body what to
[1:05:22] do if you say I'm a Christian and I do
[1:05:26] what God says then your body's going to
[1:05:28] show
[1:05:29] it if you happy and you know clap your
[1:05:32] hand Happ you hand you know I can sing
[1:05:35] too know it clap your
[1:05:42] hand so I can see Martin Luther one day
[1:05:45] sitting in the in the monastery and he's
[1:05:49] he's pulling out the old Latin Vulgate
[1:05:51] and he's translating it he comes to
[1:05:53] Romans 1
[1:05:55] he starts writing it down in his German
[1:05:59] language he said for there is is the
[1:06:01] righteousness of God revealed from Faith
[1:06:04] to Faith at is WR as it is written the
[1:06:07] just shall live by faith for the wrath
[1:06:11] of God is revealed from Heaven against
[1:06:13] all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
[1:06:16] men now watch who hold the truth in
[1:06:20] unrighteousness the Catholic church had
[1:06:22] some truth when they began but they're
[1:06:24] withholding it from the people people
[1:06:26] and Jesus right here of course this is
[1:06:28] God he's
[1:06:30] talking through Paul telling
[1:06:34] us that if you hold the truth and
[1:06:37] unrighteousness no you live by the faith
[1:06:41] of God watch Galatians now I can see old
[1:06:43] Martin Luther he said man that sounds
[1:06:44] good something Sparks in his
[1:06:47] heart he kepts writing he keeps writing
[1:06:50] he goes to the book of Galatians and he
[1:06:51] start he's writing that wasn't printting
[1:06:53] presses back then it wasn't computers he
[1:06:54] had to write them with his hand
[1:06:56] all right Galatians 3:1 he comes with
[1:06:58] that verse and he says but that no man
[1:07:00] is justified by the
[1:07:02] law
[1:07:04] Penance no man is justified by the law
[1:07:06] in the sight of God it is
[1:07:09] evident for the just shall live by faith
[1:07:14] and I'm sure he probably said
[1:07:17] amen he probably said I've been looking
[1:07:19] for that then he goes to the book of
[1:07:22] Hebrews and he's writing and putting
[1:07:23] Hebrews together and he says Paul's
[1:07:26] writing says now the just shall live by
[1:07:29] faith but watch but if any man draw back
[1:07:32] in other words and if you listen to this
[1:07:36] and you don't do it you withdraw
[1:07:39] yourself from what I'm saying today not
[1:07:41] me God if you withdraw from that my soul
[1:07:45] shall have no pleasure in you Martin
[1:07:48] Luther if you withdraw yourself because
[1:07:51] after this you know what he did but we
[1:07:53] are not of them who draw back under PR
[1:07:55] but of them that believe to the saving
[1:07:58] of the Soul he stood and wrote 95 thesis
[1:08:02] he put it on the wall of the Catholic
[1:08:04] church and he said there I stand the
[1:08:07] just shall live by faith not by Penance
[1:08:10] not by what the pope said not by what
[1:08:12] you wrote down in your book but what God
[1:08:15] Said through Paul and the different ones
[1:08:18] the just shall live by the faith of God
[1:08:22] Luther was a
[1:08:24] reformer he to and brought the
[1:08:26] Reformation
[1:08:28] in musicians come on we'll stop right
[1:08:31] there I'll finish the rest of it this
[1:08:33] afternoon but now watch let me read this
[1:08:35] real
[1:08:39] quick Revelation 17
[1:08:42] verse5 now remember a her is a female
[1:08:45] and a church all right is everybody with
[1:08:47] me we we all know
[1:08:49] that and upon her forehead was a name
[1:08:53] written mystery Babylon the Great the
[1:08:56] mother of Harlot so it must be a mama
[1:08:58] and some
[1:08:59] kids and Abominations of the earth and I
[1:09:02] saw the woman Church drunken with the
[1:09:06] blood of the Saints and with the blood
[1:09:08] of the martyrs of Jesus what it come
[1:09:09] through that Dark Age and when I saw her
[1:09:12] I wondered with great admiration John
[1:09:14] got caught up in what it was go what was
[1:09:16] going on it looked so
[1:09:17] pretty and the angel said unto me
[1:09:20] wherefore John hey slapped him beside
[1:09:24] the head said John
[1:09:26] that thing's death right what you saw
[1:09:29] I'll explain it to a group
[1:09:32] later praise God and the angel said unto
[1:09:34] me wherefore Dost thou Marvel I will
[1:09:37] tell thee The Mystery of the woman or
[1:09:39] the mystery of this church and of the
[1:09:41] Beast that carrieth her because you what
[1:09:43] is a beast in the Bible a beast is a
[1:09:45] power it's something that carries you
[1:09:46] somewhere all right that's why we have
[1:09:48] four combat Beast that combat the Beast
[1:09:51] of the devil we have combat Beast The
[1:09:53] Lion oxman and the eagle that comes
[1:09:55] together and the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:56] Ghost that helped you overcome in your
[1:09:59] daily life and overcome as a
[1:10:01] Christian the Beast that thou sawest was
[1:10:04] and is not what one Pope comes one dies
[1:10:06] another Pope pops up one dies another
[1:10:08] Pope pops up one dies another one pops
[1:10:10] up oh the Beast that thou sawest was and
[1:10:14] is not and shall Ascend out of the
[1:10:16] bottomless pit and go into predition and
[1:10:18] they that dwell on the Earth shall
[1:10:20] Wonder his names are not written in the
[1:10:23] Book of Life from the foundation of the
[1:10:25] world World when they behold the Beast
[1:10:27] that was and is not and yet is
[1:10:32] Constantine looked and he saw a church
[1:10:33] that was floundering didn't have any
[1:10:35] money they didn't have any they didn't
[1:10:37] have any um hardly a place to
[1:10:42] worship he looks over here and he's got
[1:10:44] this big church I mean he's got this big
[1:10:46] building he's got he he owns the you
[1:10:48] know he owns a lot of the things over
[1:10:50] here and he he takes the state and the
[1:10:53] church and puts them together
[1:10:57] and he instills into
[1:10:59] him not the religion of the old Paul
[1:11:03] irenius
[1:11:04] Martin he brings their own
[1:11:07] ideas and he marries them together just
[1:11:10] like Jezebel and Ahab were married Ahab
[1:11:12] was a Jew he should have never married
[1:11:14] Jezebel but when he did you saw what
[1:11:16] happened the dog licked her blood and he
[1:11:18] died
[1:11:20] too so let's stop right here let's stand
[1:11:22] our feet Revelations 181 and after these
[1:11:25] things I saw another Angel come down
[1:11:27] from heaven having great power and the
[1:11:29] Earth was lightened with his glory and
[1:11:32] he cried mightily with a strong voice
[1:11:33] saying Babylon the great is Fallen has
[1:11:35] fallen become the habitation of devils
[1:11:37] and the hold of every foul Spirit and
[1:11:39] the cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:11:41] bird for all nations have drunk of the
[1:11:44] wine of Wrath of her
[1:11:46] fornication and the kings of the Earth
[1:11:48] have committed fornication with her and
[1:11:50] the merchants of the Earth are waxed
[1:11:51] Rich through the abundance of her
[1:11:53] Delicacies must be pretty powerful
[1:11:55] powerful
[1:11:57] thing you know the pope could have
[1:12:00] stopped read your history the pope could
[1:12:03] have stopped the killing of the Jews
[1:12:06] during World War II but he wouldn't do
[1:12:10] it he wouldn't do it popes can stop
[1:12:13] start a war and a stop a war Popes are
[1:12:16] really powerful but they're going to
[1:12:17] find out one day it's all
[1:12:20] superficial there's only power in the
[1:12:23] name of Jesus not in the church and I
[1:12:26] look now watch I heard another voice
[1:12:28] from Heaven saying come out of her come
[1:12:31] out of
[1:12:32] her my people that you be not partakers
[1:12:35] of her sins and that you receive not of
[1:12:39] her plagues for his sins have reached
[1:12:41] into heaven and God hath remembered her
[1:12:44] iniquities reward her even as she
[1:12:46] rewarded you and double unto her double
[1:12:48] according to her works and the cup which
[1:12:50] she hath filled fill to her double
[1:12:55] how much she hath glorified herself and
[1:12:59] live deliciously so much torment and
[1:13:01] sorrow give her for she saith in her
[1:13:03] heart I sit a queen and have no Widow
[1:13:06] and shall see no sorrow therefore shall
[1:13:09] her plagues come in one day death
[1:13:11] mourning famine everybody still believe
[1:13:14] the Bible's right God Don't Make
[1:13:16] Mistakes right he's going to judge her
[1:13:19] don't worry but
[1:13:21] remember he's judging us right now
[1:13:24] that's right
