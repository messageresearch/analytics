Do you have the words here? Whe day or night, rain or shine, he's still the way. Oh, he's still the raing storm of my life. Give me peace, perfect peace. No one can do what the Lord has done.

Whe day [singing] or night rain or shine. [music] He sold the way. He sealed the ram of my life. He gave me peace, perfect for peace. No one can do what the Lord he has done. He shed his blood for me. Oh, [singing and music] what a friend. What a friend. Yeah, that Jesus shed his blood. What a friend that Jesus is. May the Lord [music] encourage all of us. Amen. God bless you. Appreciate. Amen. God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; Brother Tom, [snorts] come on, brother. Greet the people. You brought a 100 singers, so You all [snorts] can sing. I know you can. So don't be smiling at me. &gt;&gt; I know you can. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. Good to see you, brother. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Good to be here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Good to see the saints of God gathering together. It's been quite a time in the message. Some of the old ones have seen quite the changes. &gt;&gt; And uh I'm it's counted the greatest honor in my life is to be a minister in this message. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, Brother Brandham said that's the officers of the battle. And I liked it. We're not on a cruise ship. We're on a battleship. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a time when we are finding out what the message really is. &gt;&gt; Because we're seeing the fulfillment of the accuser of the brethren come out. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; And so we are people now that are facing the accusation. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; Just like our Lord Jesus faced the accusation. You broke the law. You healed on the Sabbath. You told people to drink blood. And the scripture says, "Don't drink the blood of the sacrifice." And here we are now in this time facing accusation again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I have good news for us. &gt;&gt; This was necessary. &gt;&gt; Don't be angry at them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't be angry at Judas. Judas said to fulfill his part. &gt;&gt; Don't even be angry at the Pharaoh. God hardened his heart. &gt;&gt; The message truth. We are coming to the understanding of it and the acknowledgement of it more and more as the days go by. &gt;&gt; We're finding out just what it is. And we we we now come we know it's more than a man. &gt;&gt; It's more than a church building. Nice building here. This building will be dust. &gt;&gt; Great man. Brother Brandham. Brother Brandham's gone on and his his body lays in the dust and his his heart and soul's up in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the word would last. &gt;&gt; Amen. My heart's been turned &gt;&gt; always. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it took a it it's going to take these things for us to become better warriors. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; One of the reasons why the accusations against the truth is hits us so hard because I'm used to dealing with brother Wade Dale, with brother Tony Oboa. They won't lie. You won't lie. But I want you to know the people speaking against the message have not that real brother Garland. They can say whatever they want. &gt;&gt; They can say, "Hey, brother Brandon was right next to a rocket ship and up it went and that made the cloud." &gt;&gt; And they can be convincing. &gt;&gt; They can even be emotional. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because they can lie and it doesn't matter to them. &gt;&gt; So, we must do the same thing we did when we all got computers and we saw junk mail. We learn to delete it and to ignore it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever has turned your heart to the Lord Jesus, cling to you like the precious pearl of truth and life that it is. &gt;&gt; My heart got turned. &gt;&gt; I can't turn it back. &gt;&gt; I love this message. &gt;&gt; It seems sweeter to me than ever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I always wondered why Brother Brandham was so nice even to the bad people. &gt;&gt; And I thought, well, that's almost like a weakness. You know, he should be. He's the prophet. You know, Elijah called fire down from heaven. Elisha, you know, but brother Brandham, he had the spirit of Jesus Christ on him so much &gt;&gt; that he didn't see those people as enemies. He saw them as potential Christians and he he loved them. &gt;&gt; True, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we love them? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; If we battle carnal against carnal, we'll have a great carnal battle. &gt;&gt; Be so sweet and so loving to him. What is the message of the hour? &gt;&gt; It's my favorite question in the whole world. It is what God is doing inside of you &gt;&gt; and how you are able to express it to others. That's it. &gt;&gt; It is the epitome of love and love doesn't get offended easily. &gt;&gt; We [snorts] must be so strong within that we were able to express the love of God. And what was the love of God? We saw a lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The lamb of God. And we are part of that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And to me, it just identifies the scripture. The falling away is taking place in our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Israel's become a nation in in our life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We heard prophecies and brother Bram just speaking all say oh he says in Tiffan Georgia he says oh when the wall comes down this is what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; We didn't even know what that meant until it come down. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Then we oh my we are seeing things that the world is astounded at. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. True. &gt;&gt; And the world has a worldly nature. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. And our flesh has what stuck to it? A little bit of that worldly nature. So it hurts us. &gt;&gt; That's why we had to be born again. We had to be revived by the word of God. &gt;&gt; The word would actually come into the womb of our soul and begin to to create a new nature, a new life. Yes. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What's happening with all of this mess around the world, both political, military, educational, spiritual, is we are stepping into that life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This world is not my home. &gt;&gt; I'm just a passing through. It's never been more true. So, as a minister, as a officer of the battle, my request is don't hate them. &gt;&gt; Don't try to get back at them. &gt;&gt; We must love them. &gt;&gt; Amen. We must actually nurture them. &gt;&gt; If they need a a coat, give them two coats. If they need you to walk a mile with them, walk two miles. &gt;&gt; Express the love of God to them. &gt;&gt; I I can't imagine how our Lord Jesus was able to take that kiss on the cheek. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Where Judas walked up to the door of heaven, kissed that door, and turned around and went to hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. So may by the grace of God &gt;&gt; we pull back that one sheep hanging out of the end of the cliff almost fallen. May we be able to reach down. That's the message I think for today. And we do have singers here. Our church is doing great. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is flourishing. &gt;&gt; We've been able to bring money out to the Ukrainian believers over to the Africa in Uganda. We've been able to help India. The work still goes on. We're still getting people asking questions. The gospel of the message is still producing the same thing it always has. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The rumor of the messages demise was greatly exaggerated. &gt;&gt; So, God bless you. Glad to see you here. Uh, musicians, come on up. Do you guys have a song? &gt;&gt; You do and David does. You want to go first? &gt;&gt; Come on up first. Ruth first. God bless you. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm very happy to be here again and I Pray that in this blessed song. [music] [music] [music] Not because I've been so faithful. Not [music] because I've been so [singing] good. You've always been there [singing] for me, [music] to provide my every need. [singing] You were there when I was lonely. You [singing] were there in all my pain. [music] Guiding my footsteps, [singing] shelter from the rain. [music] And it [singing] was you who made my life complete. [music] You [singing] are to me my everything. And that is why [singing] I sing. [music] Jesus. I love [singing] you. Because you care. [music] [singing] I couldn't imagine if you weren't [singing and music] there. Jesus, I love you. Oh, because [music] you care. I couldn't imagine [singing] [music] if you were there.

You are alpha [singing] and omega, the beginning and the end. [music] my strong tower, [singing] my dearest and best friend. And it was you [singing] who made my life complete. You are to me my everything [music] and that is [singing] why I sing. [music] Jesus, I love you. Oh yes, I do because you care. I [singing and music] couldn't imagine. Oh no, if you weren't there, Jesus, I love [singing] you. I love you. I love you [music] because you care. there. [singing] I couldn't imagine if [music] you weren't [singing] there. Jesus, I love you. I [music] love you. I love Jesus, I [singing] love you. I love [music] you. I love you. Jesus, I love you. I love you. I love because [music and singing] you care. Jesus, I love you. [singing] [applause] problem. I don't know. Hear it. Praise the Lord. Can that thing hear me? You hear me? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Through everything Satan ever tried, COVID and everything else, we're all still here today for a reason, &gt;&gt; for a purpose. difference. What is the message? It's a people that Satan can't stop, denominate, change, or pervert. We're still here serving the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. This song was sung in a choir over almost 12 years ago when I got the Holy Ghost at Louisiana camp. Jesus rescues me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm not just singing it because it's a song. I'm singing it because it's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. going through so many changes. [music] What's the news for today? [music] Somebody's hurt. [singing] Somebody's aching. Somebody's trying to find a [singing] way. A heavy heart can break your will. A troubled soul leaves time [music] standing still. [singing] So if you're hurting, please don't hide. [music] [singing] Lift up your head. I'm on your side. When every mountain seems too high and every river [singing] looks too wide. When my ship is lost at sea. That's when Jesus rescues me. My faith is strong [singing] and it carries [music] me. Sometimes weak, I still believe. My life is built on [music] this desire. [singing] Through the flood and through the fire, Jesus rescues me. I know you're looking for an answer. [singing] Searching for some hope to hold. Empty hands leave you waiting [music] and praying for a miracle. [singing] Jesus hears your every cry. [music and singing] He sees those walls you can't climb. He will heal your hurting soul [singing] and lead you safely to his home. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; When every mountain seems too high [singing] [music] and every river looks too high. [singing] [music] When my ship is lost at sea, that's when Jesus [singing] rescues [music] me. My faith is strong and [singing] it carries me. [music] Sometimes we still believe in the message. My life [music and singing] is built on his desire. Through the flood and through the fire, [music] Jesus rescues me. Sing it with me if you know it. When every mountain [singing] seems [music] too high, every [singing] river looks [music] too wide. When my ship is lost [music and singing] at sea, that's when Jesus rescues me. My faith is strong [singing] and it carries me. [music] But sometimes we still believe. My life is built on this design. Through the flood and through the fire, Jesus [singing] rescues me. Amen. [music] [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Man, where' them little kids go? You used to have good grief. What do you feed them people up there in Sweetwater, Tennessee? Little old kids used to sit on the front row and they never would look at front and they always looking at people in the back. They're always making funny faces. And don't you laugh, David. usually the one that did it. Your others were better than that. [laughter] I'll take $10 after the service. That'd be kind of appreciate that. But uh good to have them with us. They have grown up. We've seen we've watched them grow. And we sure watched them growing in the Lord, too, and do some miraculous things. And we sure appreciate the Lord working in their life because they sure are a good example. Brother Martin, come on up here and greet the people. If you got some singers sing, you can sing. I know you can't. He can sing you some songs and good to have brother Martin Varel from I guess Lawrenceville. Wouldn't we say Lawrenceville? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Always good to have him. Good friend. God bless you, buddy. &gt;&gt; Appreciate you. Love me. Just take it liberty. Good to have a young man here with us. &gt;&gt; He speaks good English. [cough] [laughter] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brothers. And it's a pleasure to be with every single one of you. &gt;&gt; You know, I could do this in English, &gt;&gt; but I also see many Hispanics here. &gt;&gt; And I said this, well, I'm going to say it in Spanish. &gt;&gt; I want you to turn around, you know, and this is the priority that the message has. You know this is the variety that the message has and anywhere that you go brother and that family that people they believe the message you know they're not going to ask you what do you believe because they know that you believe the message and I like what brother Thomas was saying there's many things in the message you know brother told me when to take the time [snorts] you know he told me here in the year so nobody could hear [laughter] &gt;&gt; you know today I don't have any singers with me &gt;&gt; and if I sing you everybody's going to leave. So therefore, I'm not going to sing, you know. But I do have a a quote here of the message &gt;&gt; that helps every single one of us, you know, it can help us even more &gt;&gt; and to straighten up a little bit more &gt;&gt; and to obtain more strength. Because in this time that we're living in, &gt;&gt; you know, it's a very dangerous time. &gt;&gt; Very dangerous. &gt;&gt; There's many liberals. &gt;&gt; There's many religious. &gt;&gt; There's many legalists. &gt;&gt; But you need to stay where? You have to stay right there in the middle. &gt;&gt; You have to stay in the word of God. You know the messenger says &gt;&gt; and the message &gt;&gt; you know and the messenger of the evening &gt;&gt; the messenger says this &gt;&gt; but Godivids you know God always works with the individual &gt;&gt; and we go to church &gt;&gt; and we listen to the word of Godual and many of the times we see that the other individual you know it doesn't put any effort but if that individual doesn't put any EFFORT WE also don't put IN ANY EFFORT YOU KNOW BUT THIS is an individual thing you know and God speaks to every single one of us &gt;&gt; you know it speaks to the pastor &gt;&gt; it speaks to the minister speaks to the one that is sitting there. &gt;&gt; You know, it speaks to every single one of us. &gt;&gt; But God always works when an individual, &gt;&gt; you know, he does not save you, you know, right here he's speaking about the denominations, you know, BAPTIST, you know, but now we are FAR AWAY FROM THAT, BROTHERS. YOU KNOW INSIDE OF THE message there are denominations now INSIDE OF THE MESSAGE AND you can name them. &gt;&gt; And when you name that denomination &gt;&gt; that is within the message like OUR BROTHER SAID HERE WHERE WAS JUDAS? &gt;&gt; He was INSIDE OF THE MESSAGE THERE WAS JUDAS THERE. WHERE WAS THAT? A CRAWL &gt;&gt; INSIDE OF THE ARK. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, there they were, every single one of them, &gt;&gt; you know, and denomination is not going to deceive you. But let someone come with a little book give you their interpretation of it. do not have the Holy SPIRIT because that is the main focus that we should have if you do not have the Holy SPIRIT AND you're going to be out there listening to any type of VOICE AND you're going to be there all the time and he speaks here about denominations. &gt;&gt; You know, Baptist doesn't save you. because you are a Baptist. You know, if you say that you believe the message, this you're not going to be saved because OF THAT. PENTECOSTAL. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE SAVED because you're Pentecostal. And he saves you BECAUSE he has dealt with you personally. &gt;&gt; Personally with you, &gt;&gt; personally, you know, I want all the pastors to send up, please. and all the pastors. &gt;&gt; All the preachers, &gt;&gt; all the preachers &gt;&gt; and all the preachers that now all the people that is sitting down and look what the messenger says here. And therefore, when God sent his prophets, you know, his uh messengers of the testament, he only spoke to one man, &gt;&gt; BUT WE AGREE ON THIS. &gt;&gt; HE ONLY SPOKE TO ONE man and that man had to bring forth the message. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But from there, some other came out OF FROM THERE &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; THEY CAME OUT OF THEIRS OTHERS &gt;&gt; FROM WHERE THE VERY SAME MESSAGE &gt;&gt; from the very same message. &gt;&gt; And they came out of THERE EVERYWHERE and bringing the MESSAGE THAT other message. And why did the message OF THE PROPHET CAMEOS &gt;&gt; AND TO TAKE us out &gt;&gt; and to get LOST &gt;&gt; NO TO TAKE US OUT &gt;&gt; AND PUT US IN WHERE HE was going TO PUT US IN TO THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO MANY VOICES. BUT I GIVE THANKS TO GOD. BECAUSE THERE'S MEN &gt;&gt; that still WANT TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; Now you see those things. &gt;&gt; AND SOMETIMES WE DON'T SEE THE THINGS EYE TO EYE. &gt;&gt; BUT [screaming] THE LOVE THAT THE LOVE THAT WAS WITHIN JESUS CHRIST AND EVERY SINGLE one of us. CAN WE GIVE AN applause to the pastors and ministers? [applause] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, GIVE GIVE THEM SUPPORT. &gt;&gt; PRAY FOR THEM &gt;&gt; as you struggle. THEY STRUGGLE EVEN MORE. YOU KNOW IN THE head &gt;&gt; you know if the head hurts &gt;&gt; you know the hands doesn't work doesn't work that's why the enemy that's why the enemy wants to touch them REACH THEM AND they're still standing up by your prayers &gt;&gt; may you have a seat brothers So it says &gt;&gt; bringing the same message, &gt;&gt; but it says that to be a main headquarter &gt;&gt; from all the pastor that stood up. &gt;&gt; Who is the leader? &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO LEADER &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S only one leader &gt;&gt; and that is who. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we all know this. &gt;&gt; There is no leader among us. &gt;&gt; That's why there's fellowship because we do not belong to a denomination inside of the message, not outside. NOW YOUNG PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; Now this man, &gt;&gt; they're advancing age. WE HAVE TO PASS ALONG THAT BIBLE. &gt;&gt; Someone else needs to stand up for this message as well &gt;&gt; with this very message, &gt;&gt; THE OTHER MESSAGE, &gt;&gt; the very same message. And here to wrap it up, there also needs to be a main headquarter of God. &gt;&gt; And he's always had one &gt;&gt; and he say I am sure I'm sorry. says, "I am thankful that he has it here tonight." And that is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And we all know. &gt;&gt; Now look at this. It's not a group, but is the Holy Spirit. It is the main headquarter of God. THAT is the messenger of God IN THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; The messenger, &gt;&gt; not William Brandom. &gt;&gt; He was a vessel. &gt;&gt; The messenger that was within William Brandham, you know, he stayed in the tomb, [clears throat] &gt;&gt; BUT THE MESSENGER IS STILL HERE. NOT IN ONE MAN ONLY, &gt;&gt; BUT IN A BODY OF A BODY of believers. &gt;&gt; And not only just in the pastors of the preachers, [clears throat] but in every SINGLE ONE OF YOU, IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU. AMEN. She &gt;&gt; she HAS THE VERY SAME AUTHORITY &gt;&gt; to pray for for someone that is sick. THAT'S RIGHT, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; WE AGREE ON THIS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE everyone the body OF CHRIST &gt;&gt; OF THE LORD Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; May the peace of the Lord be with every single one of you, brothers. [applause] [applause] He makes me tired just listening to him. Good to have our brother with us. Um you want to um the brother standing up here. Um your dad the dad's here.

We are happy to be amongst family. I believe that all of us are washed in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. because his grace has reached out unto us in this dur in this time &gt;&gt; and has brought us a message to restore our faith. We are happy because we're preaching the same message, &gt;&gt; the true apostolic message that was originated there on the day of Pentecost because that was the mission that brother Brandham brought to return back to the faith, the original faith of the apostles and the prophets. &gt;&gt; So, God bless you, brethren. And once again, I'm very happy to be here with you all. &gt;&gt; And that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ may be with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

So God has allowed us to have a wonderful group of people &gt;&gt; from all over the world that that like brother Martin said that loves one message. one message, &gt;&gt; one prophet, &gt;&gt; but many powerful ministry &gt;&gt; and many people individuals &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost.

And &gt;&gt; I went to a singing one night down in Planeville, Georgia, Planeville, Georgia, &gt;&gt; great big old church. &gt;&gt; And there's Baptist folks. &gt;&gt; And they'd hear heard me on the radio. This is my theme song. &gt;&gt; They said I would never sing that song there. But they didn't know God's plan. I did. &gt;&gt; And the pastor stood up &gt;&gt; and said, "This is a Baptist church and we your respect." &gt;&gt; Well, I respect them, but I ain't going to deny my God. That's right. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If you ashamed me, &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So, I'll try. I got a daughter here somewhere. &gt;&gt; If I fall over, she can get me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I went to Guyana, South America one time. Not quick. I wasn't a missionary. &gt;&gt; They treat us like royalty. Best I'd ever been. &gt;&gt; But when I got off that plane, if I got back on it, I would. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; But I've been happy to be living in the United States all these years. And uh you know we're living in the best times a man could ever live in. &gt;&gt; All the forefathers down through looked for our day. And God so loved us. &gt;&gt; See I come out of Pentecost and the theme there was bless God. There ain't no man telling me what to do. God wants me to know something. He could tell me. I got the limited him a whole lot. &gt;&gt; But you know, and but we're living in a time that people's look for. We're living in a time where God is going to take a bride home. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the church is going through tribulation. Prophet said the bride church is justified. &gt;&gt; And friend, I tell you, I'm 88.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Is an old building in Jonesburg, Tennessee in December the [clears throat] 21st, 1981. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd been out drinking the night before. It's about 2:00 on a Sunday afternoon and all at once, I felt his presence come into the room. And &gt;&gt; I knew it was him because I felt him when I was a boy. And he spoke to me. And right there, I knelt down by myself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Gave my heart to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A couple years went by and I went back to college and was witnessing. I went back on the GI Bill and was witnessing to people and they kept saying, "You're a preacher." And I said, "No, I I ain't no preacher. I just like to tell what the Lord did for me." &gt;&gt; Amen. So about 1985, I was in a church service and this voice spoke to my heart and I took Monday off to the riverbank and I went in there and I prayed all day and I said, "Lord, if you want me to preach, if you open the door, I'll walk in it. How do you I don't know how to start preaching. I but if that's what you want me to do." And and I came in that evening and my wife said, "Brother Phillips," he was my pastor at the time, Brother Roy Phillips said, "Brother Phillips called want you to call him." And I said, I called him. I said, "Brother Phillips, this is Brother Daryl." He said, "Yeah, Brother Daryl said, I I was praying today." I said, "The Lord put on my heart to ask you to take the service Wednesday night." &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; that was did that for a few years. And then in the Lord told me when I turned 30, I'd start traveling. And so, he's been faithful. &gt;&gt; And this is my 26th year full-time in the ministry. &gt;&gt; And I I know you've all heard some good preaching. You've already been here for a while. I promise you I won't I won't keep you long. And after hearing all that good preaching, I could just say amen and we could go eat. Amen. But I certainly can't preach like that. But we'll do the best we can if the Lord would just help us. If you have your Bibles, turn with us this afternoon to 1st Samuel chapter 17:4. And while you turn in there, we greet in the name of the Lord Jesus. And kind of it's such an honor to to be with you. And I was just telling brother Wade that one year ago today, we stood here in this pull pit and preached. And how fast a year goes. I I remember when I was a young boy, I told my mom, I said, "I can't wait till I get 20." And she said, "You better wait cuz you get 20, it'll be 30 and 30. &gt;&gt; My was she ever right." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You young people listen to your mama, but they know what they're talking about. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. A year. It just goes by so fast. But that just means we're one year closer &gt;&gt; to going home. Amen. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe we've heard the message that'll take us there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I do too. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1st Samuel chapter 17 verse4. May the Lord bless you this afternoon. [snorts] The Bible says this. And there went a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gaith, whose height was six cubics in a span, which is 9 foot 9 in tall. And he had a helmet of brass upon his head. And his and he was armed with a coat of male. And the weight of the coat was 5,000 shekels of brass about 150 pounds. And he had grieavves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders. So the only thing he exposed was his face. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam. And his spearhead weighed 600 shekels of iron. And one bearing a shield went before him. And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are you come out to set your battle in array? Am not I a Philistine, and ye the servants to Saul? Choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. And if he be able to fight with me and to kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then ye shall be our servants and serve us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Philistines said, "I defy the armies of Israel this day." &gt;&gt; That was the wrong thing to say. &gt;&gt; I defy the armies of Israel this day. Give me a man that we may fight together. And when Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistines, &gt;&gt; they were dismayed &gt;&gt; and greatly afraid. &gt;&gt; God's army &gt;&gt; afraid. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us bow our heads. &gt;&gt; I want to speak for just a few minutes today on why David one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why David won. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we love you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We are so grateful for what you have done for us. And Lord, it's such an honor to stand here in the presence of your people, Lord. &gt;&gt; Great man of God, that we see in the audience today. But Lord, I pray that you would take this little feeble effort of ours, Lord, and speak to the hearts of your children to encourage them, Lord. For we're living in such an hour of such giants in the land. &gt;&gt; But oh God, there is a David among us. &gt;&gt; And Lord, I pray today that there be any sick. May they be healed. If they would be any weak among us, be they may they be made strong. And Lord, if there would be some that would be weary, renew their strength, oh God, we pray &gt;&gt; that when we leave this building, may we say, "Did not our hearts burn within us?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the God that was with David is the God that is with us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, we commit this congregation and oursel into your hands for your glory in Jesus name. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." God bless you. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Now, this scripture that we read this afternoon is very familiar to us all. And no doubt we've heard it time and time again, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That when I even started reading it, you already knew the outcome. You already knew what was going to happen. &gt;&gt; But you know, no matter how many times that we've heard it, it's still just as true. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, David was a boy facing a giant, &gt;&gt; facing opposition much stronger than him, much bigger than him, and yet he overcame his enemy. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "Every time the devil produces a Goliath, God's got a David somewhere." &gt;&gt; Just always remember that. Every time there is a Goliath, there is a David. Every time the devil produces a Goliath, God produces a David. Oh, hallelujah. And let me say in this day of Goliath of cancer, Goliath of pandemics, Goliath of evil critics that's come against our message, there is a David somewhere. [applause] &gt;&gt; Who will meet the challenge of THE HOUR? AMEN. GOD'S always had a David. He's got him today. And you see, if you look at human reasoning, human reasoning would tell you that Goliath should have won this battle. &gt;&gt; He was tall. David was short. He was a warrior. He was a champion warrior. He had trophies. A champion warrior. David was a sheep herder. Goliath was covered in armor. &gt;&gt; David was covered in sheep skin. &gt;&gt; Who do you think Vegas would have put their money on? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, the world looks at the natural part with what they can see with the eye. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, you think, how could this woman walk? The prophet said, "How could that one man ever get up out of a wheelchair, how could that man that's fixing to die in the next few days with heart trouble? How could he be made well?" Amen. &gt;&gt; And I like to add something to THAT AND SAY, "HOW COULD A LITTLE GIRL THAT WAS IN A TRAIN ACCIDENT WHEN EVERYBODY IN THE CAR was killed from her and they said she'd never walk again, NEVER SEE AGAIN, BUT GOD OPENED THAT LITTLE GIRL'S EYES?" [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It's unreasonable. You can't reason it OUT BECAUSE GOD'S NOT KNOWN BY REASONING. GOD IS KNOWN BY FAITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You see, Satan leads a man, but what he could see with his eyes, but God chose to lead man by his heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The eyes of the heart sees the unseen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; David had a slingshot. GOLIATH HAD A CHALLENGE. BUT DAVID HAD A GOD WHO COULD NOT BE DEFEATED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, the setting of the showdown was a valley between two hills. On one hill was the Philistines who serve gods. On the other hill was the army of Jehovah, the army of Israel. And they were trained. They were armed. THEY WERE GOD'S ARMY. &gt;&gt; And it came to pass that the Philistine army had a big challenger, a big champion by the name of Goliath. And the prophet said he was 9 foot uh 9'4 in tall. And what a fellow he was. had 14 inch fingers. &gt;&gt; From the bottom of his hand to the tip of his fingers was 28 in. &gt;&gt; This man could slap you on one side of the face and hit the other at the same time. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Guy walk up with red jaws said you got slapped by Goliath. What a hand that he had. AND HE COME OUT MAKING THIS BOAST. THERE'S NO need for both armies to SUFFER LOSS. JUST SEND ME OUT A MAN. YOU SEE, WHEN THE DEVIL thinks he's got the edge on you, he'll sure poke IT ON YOU IF YOU'LL LET HIM. &gt;&gt; And this big Goliath, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE OF HIS ATTITUDE AND BECAUSE of his his statue, HE SAYS, "LET'S HAVE IT LIKE THIS. SEND ME OUT A MAN WHO'LL FIGHT ME." YOU SEE, GOLIATH WANTED a man. &gt;&gt; God gave him a boy. [laughter] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES THAT TELL US? GOD DON'T NEED SOMETHING BIG. HE JUST NEEDS something yielded. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I just think Goliath wanted a man. God said, "Watch this." He gave him A BOY, A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY. THEN WHAT DOES THAT TELL? IT TELLS ME OUR YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO GROW old before they can do something for God. YOU CAN DO SOMETHING FOR GOD RIGHT NOW. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You see, now if any man in the whole army of Israel was able to go up against this man, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAUL. &gt;&gt; HE WAS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE EVERY MAN IN THE ARMY. &gt;&gt; He was closer to Goliath's size than any man in the army. He knew how to fight. He knew how to maneuver a spear. He knew how to raise a shield to knock the lick off. He trained men. He was a bishop. He knew what he was doing. &gt;&gt; So if anybody should have went up there, it should have been Saul. Y &gt;&gt; BUT GOD NEVER CHOSE SAUL. GOD CHOSE DAVID. &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD HAS CHOSE YOU TO DO SOMETHING, THEY NOBODY CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IF GOD'S CALLED YOU TO PREACH, PREACH. IF GOD'S CALLED YOU TO AMEN. AMEN. IF GOD'S CALLED YOU TO SING, SING FOR THE GLORY OF GOD. BUT BE WHAT GOD CALLED YOU BECAUSE NOBODY CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; You was born for a purpose. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And when Saul and all the of Israel heard the words OF THE PHILISTINES, THE BIBLE SAID they were dismayed and greatly afraid. &gt;&gt; How can that be? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE GOD'S ARMY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY REPRESENT. HOW COULD THEY BE SCARED? HOW COULD THEY BE SO DISMAYED? &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY LACK SOMETHING. THEY DIDN'T HAVE WHAT DAVID HAD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; They failed to see who they were in the word. &gt;&gt; You see, JESUS HAD PERFECT FAITH BECAUSE HE KNEW WHO HE WAS IN THE WORD. AND WHAT DID GOD SEND A PROPHET FOR IN THIS HOUR? NOT JUST TO TELL US WHO BROTHER BENHAM WAS, BUT TO TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, do you love him today? &gt;&gt; THEY LACKED WHAT JOSHUA AND WHAT CALEB HAD. YOU SEE JOSHUA AND CALEB, THEY HAD A REVELATION. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. When they went over and they came back with the report, you know, oh, we're like grasshoppers in their eyes. It's it's too big. They got walled off cities and oh, it's just too much. And the people WAILED AND CRIED, THEY ALREADY GAVE UP. BUT JOSHUA AND CALEB STAND THERE SAID, WE CAN DO IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THIS IS OUR LAND. GOD PROMISED WE COULD DO IT. GOD SAID WE COULD DO IT. GOD PROMISED OUR FATHERS WE WERE GOING OVER. THIS IS OUR LAND. IT BELONGS TO US. &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO TELL THE DEVIL WHAT BELONGS TO YOU. EVERYTHING JESUS DIED FOR AT CALVARY IS IN YOUR POSSESSION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; It don't matter if they got walled cities. It don't matter how big they are. IT DON'T MATTER how trained they are. ALL THAT MATTERS IS YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You see, when you quit looking at the giants and start looking at God's word, but the devil always wants you to get your eyes off the word and to LOOK AT THE GIANTS. As long as as long as your eyes see the size OF THE GIANTS, THAT'S all the devil wants you to see. &gt;&gt; As long as you look at the cancer, THAT'S ALL YOU'LL EVER HAVE. AS LONG AS YOU LOOK AT THAT MARITAL TROUBLE, THAT'S ALL YOU'LL EVER HAVE. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO QUIT LOOKING AT THAT. YOU'VE GOT TO QUIT LOOKING AT THE SYMPTOMS and look at the word. &gt;&gt; The word says you're already healed. Every person in this BUILDING IS ALREADY HEALED RIGHT NOW. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Every man knows today. Oh my. He can take the name of Jesus. Why? Because all things are subject to Jesus and Christ. The prophet said when men and women quit looking at their sickness and their diseases and start looking to what God said about it, they will take over. I SAY IT'S TIME WE TAKE OVER. AMEN. &gt;&gt; All things are subject to Jesus Christ. And all things are subject to you in prayer when you ask in the name of Jesus and believe. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO ASK. YOU'VE GOT to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. How do we know? How do we know Noah believed God when God said it was going to rain? How do we know he believed him? BECAUSE HE BUILT THE ARK BEFORE THE RAIN FELL. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; It's not enough to say, "I'm a believer." YOU MUST PUT THAT INTO ACTION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. All things are subject to you in prayer. When you ask in his name and believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ask what you will in my name, it'll be done. That's right. Whatsoever thing you desire when you pray, receive it, you shall have it. &gt;&gt; God said so. Let nothing stand in YOUR WAY. STOP LOOKING AT THE things you're looking at here. Look at the unseen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "HOW DO BROTHER, BROTHER, HOW DO YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO RAPTURE?" GOD SAID WE WAS. &gt;&gt; That's good ENOUGH FOR ME. WELL, I DON'T FEEL IT. HE NEVER SAID, "DID YOU FEEL IT?" He said, "DID YOU BELIEVE IT?" &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU BELIEVE IT, YOU ACTUALLY MAY START FEELING IT. [laughter] &gt;&gt; LORD, &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; LOOK, God gave Moses a stick. How ridiculous that was to the world. He gave Shabgard an ox goat. He gave Samson a jawbone. &gt;&gt; But he's gave us &gt;&gt; his name. &gt;&gt; What did Satan do? The first thing he done, he took the name of Jesus out of the church and GAVE THE CHURCH TITLES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But what HAS GOD DONE IN THIS DAY? HE SENT A PROPHET TO RESTORE US. WHAT? BACK TO THE WORD. AND WHAT DID HE BRING BACK TO US? THE NAME OF JESUS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "You take on the characteristics of that name." &gt;&gt; Abram would have never been father of nations UNTIL HIS NAME WAS CHANGED TO ABRAHAM. [applause] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Elvis means cat and Ricky means rat." And that boy named Ricky the prophet said, "CHANGE HIS NAME AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS to him &gt;&gt; because you take on the characteristics of your name." So if we TAKE ON THAT NAME OF JESUS, &gt;&gt; we are not an organization. We are not a denomination. WE ARE NOT A MAN FOLLOWER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE ARE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, do you love him? &gt;&gt; There's power in the name of Jesus. Every man today knows he can take the name of Jesus Christ and meet any foe, any place, any time, and he will be defeated. &gt;&gt; I've met witch doctors. I've met demons of all sort. And I've never seen a time by what they bowed to the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I tell you friends, when the church lost the name and the power of the name of Jesus Christ, they lost it. &gt;&gt; When Moses went down to Egypt, if they had ever got that stick out of his hand, that had him whipped. But in that stick was where the power laid. If they ever got the stick out of his hand, they had him whipped. Remember, IT WAS THE STICK that smoked the rock. It was the stick that held in the air. It was the stick that he held over the water. IT WAS GOD'S JUDGMENT ROD. AND WHAT THAT STICK was in Moses HAND. THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST IS TO THE BORN AGAIN CHURCH TODAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. You can take that name. THE NAME OF JESUS SAY, SATAN, GET OFF MY PROPERTY. &gt;&gt; GET OFF MY FAMILY. &gt;&gt; GET OFF MY CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, do you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, the name of Jesus. Take the name of Jesus with you, child of sorrow and of woe. When temptation rounds you gathers, breathe that holy name in prayer &gt;&gt; and watch demons scatter. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You see, we meet our giants in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; I don't meet them in my ability. I ain't got no ability. I don't meet him in my education. I ain't got no education. BUT I MEET HIM. HALLELUJAH. In the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And when THAT NAME WAS FIRST EVER SPOKE, A BABY THAT WAS DEAD IN ITS MOTHER'S WOMB, leaped inside the womb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You meet me, Philistine, with armor and a spear, David said. But I meet you in the name of the Lord, God of Israel. And the Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the Old. He only changed HIS MASK FROM SPIRIT TO MAN. &gt;&gt; David knew where he was standing. He knew how to meet him. Amen. And we know how to meet OUR GOLIATH IN THIS HOUR. WE MEET HIM IN THE NAME OF JESUS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; David said, "You meet me as a Philistine with armor and a spear, but I meet you in the name of the Lord, God of Israel." He had five stones, five fingers, and a sling wrapped in G J su f a i t h faith in Jesus. And here he comes. SOMETHING HAD TO HAPPEN. I TELL YOU, when you turn that stone loose, the spirit of God called into that stone and slew Goliath and cut his head off. And all the other Philistines was weakened down. &gt;&gt; And the armies of Israel took courage and they cut the Philistines PLUGGED TO THE WALL. AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TONIGHT IS SOMEBODY WHO'S GOT AN EXPERIENCE TO STAND UP AND TO PROVE THE POWER OF THE resurrection of Jesus Christ. You see it's listen to me. It's not ENOUGH TO SAY I'M IN THE MESSAGE. THE MESSAGE MUST BE IN YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. The rest of them will take courage. And here they'll come. Some of you on the CS, he said the prophet said some of you in wheelchairs JUST TRY IT ONCE AND WATCH THAT GROUP FOLLOW YOU. TAKE COURAGE. OH, brother saints of God. I was in Oklahoma and we had at the end of the service we just had a prayer for everybody and the sister had a tennis elbow and she couldn't clap her hands because it hurt real bad and so the people just laid hands on one another and she was the people prayed and when they got done and said amen she said the people started clapping and she started clapping her hands she go it don't hurt &gt;&gt; it don't hurt I couldn't do that before and she started praising GOD CUZ GOD HAD HEALED HER RIGHT THERE AND THE DOOR OPENED and people started stepping in it and a cancer disappeared off OF A WOMAN'S LEG WHY BECAUSE THE DOOR WAS OPEN AND IF FAKE AND RADIATED IN THIS BUILDING TODAY. I TELL YOU THERE IS NOTHING. AMEN. [applause] &gt;&gt; What God will prove himself to be the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. The reason David won, when David went to meet Goliath, Goliath looked at him and laughed at him, &gt;&gt; made fun of him. Sound familiar? &gt;&gt; And he said, "WHY AM I A DOG? YOU COME out to meet me. A little old ruddy looking boy. Probably said the little rucky, you know, Saul called him a strap. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's what Saul said. Who is that strap out there? Just that little old kid like, you know, little old looking fell probably shoulder stooped over. Think about this. Saul, THE CAPTAIN OF THE ARMY. AND Goliath was in agreement about David's &gt;&gt; qualification. Amen. &gt;&gt; Never take sides with the devil. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; You talk about discouragement. He was the Saul, the leader OF THE ARMY, WAS TRYING TO DISCOURAGE. WHAT? DAVID, YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOURSELF KILLED. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Think about that. But let me tell you, young people, let me tell you, mama, daddy, DON'T LET NOBODY DISCOURAGE YOU. KNOW WHO YOU ARE. KNOW WHAT GOD DID FOR YOU. STAND ON IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let them laugh. LET THE CRITICS SAY WHAT THEY'LL SAY. YEAH. &gt;&gt; God will prove his people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Saul said, "Take my armor. It's the best made. It was so good. Oh my. You if you're going to go out there, take this. I've got the best helmet. I've got the best shield." Well, if it was SO GOOD, WHY DIDN'T he use it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh. &gt;&gt; He tried to give it to David. &gt;&gt; Dressed him all up in that big old heavy armor. IT DIDN'T FIT DAVID. &gt;&gt; DAVID SAID, "TAKE IT OFF OF ME." I'VE NEVER PROVED THAT. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'LL STAND ON WHAT GOD HAS PROVED IN THIS HOUR TO BE THE TRUTH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [panting and gasps] [sighs] They said, "Just let me go. I know what I'm about. I know what I'm talking about." &gt;&gt; And that's what we need today. &gt;&gt; You don't have to have a great big education to know a whole lot of things. The only thing you have to know is the power of the resurrection OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; LET ME GO WITH THAT. THAT SAVED ME FROM SIN. IT HEALED ME OF MY SICKNESS. THAT'S ALL I NEED TO KNOW. I WAS A DRUNK AND HE SAVED ME. I WAS LOST AND HE FOUND ME. COME ON, SOMEBODY. THAT'S ALL I NEED TO KNOW. IF GOD DONE IT ONCE, HE CAN DO IT AGAIN. IF GOD HEALED ME ONCE, HE CAN HEAL ME AGAIN. IF GOD DELIVERED ME ONCE, HE can deliver me again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then why do I HAVE TO WORRY? WHY DO I HAVE TO FEAR? I CAN STAND HERE KNOWING THAT MY GOD IS TRUE. [gasps] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Oh my. Amen. [clears throat and sighs] know him in the power of his resurrection. Be his witness. David said, "Let me go." He took off all that old armor. I don't need that stuff. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Walked out there, crossed over a little branch, PICKED UP FIVE STONES. Five smooth stones. But I want you to understand, David didn't pick up five stones in case he missed four times. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; He picked up five stones because Goliath had four brothers and David said, "I'll just kill them all." &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of faith we need today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I'll just TAKE THE WHOLE BUNCH of them. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD'S METHOD IS TO CAST OUT EVIL. CAST DOWN REASON. CAST DOWN SUPERSTITION. CAST DOWN WEARINESS. CAST DOWN DISTRESS. AMEN. WE'RE ABOVE IT. RESURRECTED IN CHRIST JESUS SAID IN HEAVENLY PLACES with every devil under your foot. &gt;&gt; Did you hear WHAT THE PROPHET SAID? THE PROPHET SAID, "EVERY DEVIL IS UNDER YOUR FOOT." AMEN. &gt;&gt; Then what do you need to do? Stomp him down. &gt;&gt; Here a few years ago when my daughter Ally was a little old girl, I was preaching up in Kentucky. We standing outside and I she's standing beside me about like this and I was talking to the brother and Ally goes and I looked at her. I said, "What?" And I said something else. She goes, and she goes, I said, "Ally, you're ruining my ministry." I said, "What are you doing?" She goes, "It's a bug, daddy. It's a bug." And I looked down, this bug was running around and she's trying to stomp it. And you need THAT'S MY THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND. THE DEVIL AIN'T NOTHING BUT A BUG. YOU NEED TO PUT HIM UNDER YOUR FOOT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WELL, IF I WAS A PREACHER, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A PREACHER. WELL, IF I WAS A PROPHET, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A PROPHET. JUST BE A BELIEVER IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause] &gt;&gt; Every devil, whether we're young, WHETHER WE'RE OLD, WHITE, BLACK, RED, YELLOW, IT DON'T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE. EVERY DEVIL IS UNDER our feet. Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to tell the devil, "Hey, oh boy, you are under my feet." &gt;&gt; Amen. He wrapped that little old sling around five fingers, dropped that stone into it. Here he come. Goliath made a mockery at him. Said, "Am I A DOG?" &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; "AM I A DOG THAT YOU'D SEND THAT A BOY?" [panting] David goes, "Bow!" Wow. [gasps] Amen. [panting] &gt;&gt; Here he come with a sling. Here he come with a sling against the man who had over 200 lb of armor &gt;&gt; and A CHAMPION WARRIOR, 9 FOOT 9 IN TALL, 28 IN HAND. &gt;&gt; And here David come with a slingshot. Not an M16, not a grenade launcher, a piece of leather with a stone in it. &gt;&gt; But little AS MUCH OF GOD IS IN IT. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; AMEN. What was the difference? HE WASN'T TRUSTING in the leather. HE WASN'T TRUSTING in the stone. HE WAS TRUSTING IN THE GOD HE KNEW. &gt;&gt; AND THIS GOD SAID, "YOU WILL REIGN AS A KING." HOW CAN HE DIE BY A GIANT AND REIGN AS A KING? SO HE TOOK WHAT GOD SAID OVER EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [snorts] AMEN. OH, do you love him today? &gt;&gt; Here he come. that probably sit with this little sling, but he knew God. That's the main thing. He was a believer. Here's why I believe David won. He was a believer. He was elected. He was called. He was anointed. And he was placed. &gt;&gt; Yes, he was. &gt;&gt; And no matter whether you're young or old, TALL OR SHORT, IF GOD HAS CALLED YOU FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS, YOU ARE UNDEFEABLE. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST WILL NOT BE DEFEATED. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T SURVIVE LEONA. WE OVERCOME LEONA. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. CALLED, CHOSEN, ANOINTED, placed for such a time as this. &gt;&gt; He didn't put me in Luther's DAY. HE DIDN'T PUT ME IN WESLEY'S DAY. HE PUT ME IN THIS DAY, THIS HOUR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Whenever Satan comes at you, Satan tries to put something at you, you know where you're at. When you realize God has revealed this truth to you. When you REALIZE THIS GOD, THIS MESSAGE THAT WE SERVE IS THE MIND of God. THINK ABOUT IT. THE PROPHET SAID, "WHAT WAS ONCE GOD'S GREAT MYSTERIOUS SECRET THAT WAS IN HIS MIND, BUT IT AIN'T IN HIS MIND NO MORE, IT USED TO be in HIS MIND, BUT IT AIN'T THERE. SO WHERE IS THAT MYSTERIOUS SECRET?" THE PROPHET SAID, "IT'S IN THE HEART OF THE BELIEVER TODAY." [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; When Jesus ascended with the open book, what did he do? He gave THE BOOK TO JOHN. WHO DOES JOHN TYPE? THE BRIDE. AND WHAT DID JOHN DO WITH THE BOOK? HE DIDN'T PUT IT UP ON THE BOOKSHELF. HE ATE THE BOOK AND HIM AND THE BOOK became one. &gt;&gt; Somebody could have said, "What happened to that book?" Said, "John got it. What did what what did it say?" ASK JOHN. HE ATE IT. &gt;&gt; Him and the book became one. And the revelation of Jesus CHRIST HAS BECOME ONE WITH US. &gt;&gt; ALL GOD WAS HE POURED INTO CHRIST. &gt;&gt; And all Christ is, he has poured into his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ is the mystery OF GOD REVEALED, BUT THE BRIDE IS THE REVELATION of where Jesus Christ is. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother D, I can only see Jesus. I'm trying to tell you, he's sitting right beside you. &gt;&gt; He's just changed his mask. [gasps and sighs] &gt;&gt; Well, glory. [panting] &gt;&gt; There's nothing in the world going to defeat you in it. That's all. You're absolutely undefeable. Not you, NOT THIS, &gt;&gt; BUT THE GOD that's in me. &gt;&gt; Not Christ, not the body, BUT THE WORD THAT WAS IN HIM. &gt;&gt; THE WORD THAT WAS IN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Not Mary, but the word THAT WAS BORN FROM HER. Oh my. [clears throat] Them fellas up there, they couldn't understand it. BUT DAVID HAD THE ANOINTING ALL UPON HIM. HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS STANDING. &gt;&gt; OH, GOLIATH STOOD OUT THERE WITH A BIG BOAST. [sighs] But David [laughter] had a revelation. &gt;&gt; DAVID WAS ANOINTED BY A PROPHET WHO GAVE HIM A REVELATION OF WHAT HIS PURPOSE WAS FOR BEING UPON the earth. AND THE BRIDE &gt;&gt; HAS BEEN ANOINTED BY A PROPHET'S MINISTRY WITH THE revelation &gt;&gt; of what she is upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my. [gasps] God stood out with this big boast. He said, "Oh yeah, brother. I did it in them days, but the days of miracles has passed. Oh yeah, he done it brother Brandham's day, but but he ain't doing it no more. That's a lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Didn't stop with brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; It's now in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Elisha, it represents the church. AND WHAT DID THE CHURCH RECEIVE? A DOUBLE PORTION. &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU TELL ME HE CAN'T DO IT. THERE'S SOME Jehovah some some Church of Christ boys wanted to debate me over divine healing. I said you come too late to tell me God DON'T HEAL NO MORE. IF YOUR GOD CAN'T HEAL IF HE'S too puny TO HEAL, I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU. BUT MY GOD STILL HEALS. &gt;&gt; I've seen cancers disappear. I'VE SEEN BLINDED EYES COME OPEN. I'VE SEEN THE LAME WALK. AMEN. I HAD NOTHING TO DO with it. I was just a witness when it happened. I'VE SEEN THE DEAD RAISE. THERE IS NOTHING THAT MY GOD CANNOT DO. [applause and cheering] I was in a meeting in New Mexico and my back went out on me and I laid two days in a in a hotel room on the floor on a bag of ice with my feet up in a chair and I I set the door so brother Juel Fory could bring food to me because I wouldn't even get up and go eat and I had to preach and brother Jules said, "Brother, if you can't preach," he said, "I'll take your service and you can and I preach Saturday night. It'll give you a couple more days to heal up." I said, "Let me pray about And I text a few brothers and asked him to pray and they just came on my heart and I told brother Juel I said I'm going to preach tonight. He text back. He said, "Oh boy." And I was laying on the floor and I began to cry and I said, "God, don't make me stand in front of you people like this." [panting] And it come time to go. It was all I could do to get up and get in the car. And when I got to the church, had to climb steps to get to the study. I was hurting so bad. I couldn't stand it. And the brother, you know, was talking to me. And when he went out, I took my shoes off and laid in the floor, put my feet up in a chair trying to get some rest. Kind called me to the pull pit. I come to the pull pit. I turned around. I was white knuckled just I was afraid to let go, brother Wade. I afraid I was going to fall. &gt;&gt; And all at once, GOD IS MY WITNESS. I FELT a hand touch me on the back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I thought it was a song leader telling me that my microphone wasn't on. And I turned around and when I did, there was nobody behind me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it WAS A HAND. I FELT THE HAND. I THOUGHT THAT'S ODD. AND I TURNED BACK AROUND. IT WAS LIKE TWO warm vials of water JUST POURED DOWN. IT WAS OVER. [applause] &gt;&gt; I KNOW. HALLELUJAH. GOD'S ABLE TO TOUCH EVERY PERSON IN THIS BUILDING THIS AFTERNOON. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We went from two days laying in the floor to a prayer line that night by the power of a God who cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. It may be over for some people, but it not for David. Not for the David of the day. He knew where he was. He knew he was positionally placed. He know where he was at. Hallelujah. Every David SITTING HERE TONIGHT, YOU'RE POSITIONALLY IN CHRIST. GOD HAS CONFIRMED IT. ELECTION, CALLING, ANOINTING, PLACING. He elected you and called you. HE ELECTED YOU AND CALLED YOU. THEN HE ANOINTED YOU WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT. And now he's PLACED YOU IN THE BODY OF CHRIST. AND EACH ONE OF THESE DAVIDS. &gt;&gt; OH, we need a David OF THE DAY, BROTHER D. WHERE IS THE DAVID OF TODAY? IT'S NOT ONE MAN. IT'S A BODY MOVE. &gt;&gt; The David OF TODAY IS YOU. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Where's that Goliath? Where's that cancer that's eating you up? That tumor's hanging on you. Them cataracts, that crippled arm, everything looks at it and says it can't be done. &gt;&gt; But when they say it can't be done, God says it can be. [panting and sighs] [gasps] &gt;&gt; Amen. Devil says you might as well keep believing. You might as well settle down cuz you ain't going to get no more. Well, &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Your doctor said so. All the rest of them said so. You can't get well. &gt;&gt; But with God, &gt;&gt; nothing shall be impossible. [panting] &gt;&gt; God says you're healed. God says you're healed. The doctor says, "I'm sorry." The doctor says there's nothing more I can do for you, but God says you're healed. Whose report will you believe? &gt;&gt; People put so much faith in a doctor. I worked for doctors 18 years in surgery. STOOD RIGHT BESIDE THEM. DID ALL KINDS OF THOUSANDS of operations. Need your gallbladder out? See me downstairs. [laughter] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, doctors can be wrong. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Doctors bury their mistakes. &gt;&gt; Are you listening to me? &gt;&gt; PEOPLE PUT SO MUCH AND I'VE GOT NOTHING. IF I'M S I WENT TO A DOCTOR THIS week cuz I pulled a muscle in my leg. I BELIEVE IN DOCTORS. BUT WHEN THE DOCTOR SAYS HE CAN'T HELP YOU, I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO CAN. AND THE THING ABOUT A DOCTOR'S REPORT, IT CAN BE 100% RIGHT OR it can be 100% WRONG. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD'S WORD IS ALWAYS RIGHT. AND HE SAID, "I AM THE LORD THY GOD WHO HEALTH THEE." &gt;&gt; SO I'LL TAKE WHAT GOD SAID OVER WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; The Christ that made you stop drinking, stop smoking, stop lying, stop stealing, that saved you from a life of drunkenness, from morale, and from sin. And if he can do that for you, can't he save you from TB? Can't he save you from cancer? Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's a Goliath. DON'T TAKE HIS BOAST. STAND IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS AND CHALLENGE HIM TO A SHOWDOWN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Positionally in Christ. If every believer knew his position, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'd have it. &gt;&gt; Then don't you see what the devil wants to do is keep you from recognizing who you are. Keep you from realizing what your position. Well, I'm too young. I'm just a young person. It don't matter &gt;&gt; if you're positionally placed in Christ. believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If every believer knew his position, he'd have it. God's great spirit is here AND THE HOLY GHOST IS READY TO FALL ON ANYBODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That will believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Then you can have it. GOD HAS PROMISED IT. GOD WILL DO IT. WE'RE IN CHRIST. That's right. &gt;&gt; My people, my mama's people were Melunian. Anybody know what a Melundian is? Never heard of it. Melundians is a tri-racial people. Black, white, and Indian. That's where my mama's people were. I can go to any continent on earth and be at home. [laughter] And so there's a group called Melundians. And so they having a big reunion up in Chillhawi, Virginia. And me and my brother went up there. Anybody ever remember Alfred? You remember Alfred Hall, don't you? Brother David. &gt;&gt; Brother Alfred Hall. Probably one of the darkest white men I've ever seen. And so me and my brother was walking up there in Chill how where the Melenian reunion was and we was talking. I said, "I tell you right now, if anybody's here today, it'll be Alfred Hall." And we turned the corner and guess who I saw? I said, "I knew you'd be here." He started laughing. He had a book under his arm and the guy Brent Kennedy wrote this book called Melundon, the resurrecting of a proud people. And he's there signing autographs. And so, Brother Hall had got the autograph of that book and he's walking down through there with his under his arm. I said, "I knew you'd be here." He started laughing. He said, "THE MAN THAT WROTE THE BOOK SAID I'm one of them." [laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want the devil TO KNOW TODAY. THE MAN THAT WROTE THE BOOK SAID, "I'M ONE OF THEM. I'M CHOSEN. I'M ELECTED. I'M POSITIONALLY PRAY IN THE BODY OF CHRIST." AMEN. THAT'S WHO I AM. THAT'S WHAT I COME FROM. THAT'S MY PURPOSE FOR BEING BORN. &gt;&gt; I wasn't BORN TO BE A DRUNK. I WASN'T BORN TO BE A LIAR. I WAS BORN TO BE A SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "I didn't come up and mix up a doctrine, but to straighten one out, to get away from this fear and scare that you don't know WHO YOU YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE, BUT YOU ARE NOW SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. YOU ALWAYS WERE sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Election, calling, anointing, place, and he elected you, called you, he elected you, called you, then he anointed you with the Holy Spirit, and he's placed you in the body of Christ. Each one of these Davids, who is the David of today? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need to be like a little boy looking in the mirror say, "Why, mama? &gt;&gt; That's me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's me. David stood up there and faced that giant knowing he was anointed by a prophet. &gt;&gt; God's word. God is in his word. God confirms his word. God keeps his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God had come to him by a prophet and anointed him and told him what he was GOING TO BE. SO DAVID WAS SATISFIED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SAINTS, a prophet has stood IN THIS GENERATION AND HAS PROPHESIED OVER YOU. &gt;&gt; The word of God was on him. How can I die by John and reign as a king? [panting] How could he? It's impossible. YOU CAN'T DO BOTH. SO, I'LL TAKE WHAT GOD SAID. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. David knew what he's talking about. That's the reason he wasn't afraid of Goliath. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the rock that David had in the sling that killed Goliath. It wasn't that sling that he had in his hand that killed Goliath. It wasn't that stone that he had IN HIS POCKET. THAT WASN'T WHAT DONE IT. WHAT DONE IT? IT WAS HIS HIDDEN POWER, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THAT blessing of God when David let loose of what HE HAD. GOD TOOK IT AND BLESSED IT &gt;&gt; WITH A hidden power. So it wasn't David, it wasn't the stone, it wasn't the slingshot, IT WAS THE BLESSING THAT WAS ON HIM. &gt;&gt; WHAT MAKES US WHO WE ARE? WE'RE THE SMALLEST GROUP IN THE WORLD. BUT WHAT MAKES US WHAT WE ARE? [applause] &gt;&gt; IT'S THAT HIDDEN BLESSING THAT GOD HAS PLACED UPON US. HE HAS PROPHESIED OVER US. DON'T YOU SEE? GOD'S DONE SAW YOU IN A RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [panting and gasps] That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David of today, as we're coming to a close, you have a hidden power, the anointing of the Holy Ghost. As David was anointed to meet his Giant, so are we anointed to meet ours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every man and woman this afternoon that wants to go on with God, don't pay any attention to what the world says. Whether we can or whether WE CAN'T, GOD PROMISED IT. &gt;&gt; THAT settles it. God said so. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when God says so, that settles it forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That settles it forever. &gt;&gt; Do you love him, friends? &gt;&gt; Do you see who we are in this hour? We're not an organization. We are not a denomination. We are the bride of Jesus Christ chosen for such a time as this to meet the challenge of this hour. The giants that are raising their hand. Those who used to walk among us now criticize us and put trash on the internet about us. But it don't phase me one bit cuz I know who I am. I know where I come from. I know what the man who wrote the book said I was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I figured the man that wrote the book knew what he was talking about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So my faith is not my ability. &gt;&gt; It's not my education, but is in the God who found me in Jonesburg, Tennessee. &gt;&gt; I wasn't looking for God. &gt;&gt; He came looking for me. You weren't looking for God. Well, I sought God. Bur said you never sought God. It was always God seeking you. &gt;&gt; Don't you see that hunger for you, God? That hunger, that desire that you had for God. &gt;&gt; That was God looking for you. &gt;&gt; Who come looking for the first lost son? &gt;&gt; He didn't send an angel. He didn't send a prophet. God came himself. &gt;&gt; Who found the FIRST LOST SON? GOD DID. THEN WHO FINDS EVERY LOST SON? &gt;&gt; God does. &gt;&gt; David for today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Recognize who you are when you walk out that door. Recognize with this revelation, I am a son and daughter of God, and no giant can stand before me. &gt;&gt; Do you love him today? &gt;&gt; Do you believe him today? &gt;&gt; Oh, I trust I've not preached too long. I know you're tired. You've been here a long time, but let's just bow our heads. Oh my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just something maybe to encourage your faith just a little bit. Certainly no kind of a preacher, but oh hallelujah. I just know in whom I've believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why would I worry when giants come calling my name? [singing] My God is so much bigger. Troubles I face. And why would I hunger for power or riches or fame? Cuz my God is so much better than all of these things. So I won't be shenen. I won't be moved. My God is faithful. His promise is true. So I'll speak to the mountain. Tell him it's time to move. Cuz my God is bigger, [music] better, stronger, greater than you. My enemies scatter cuz they know the battle is [music and singing] done. My God is stronger. The victories already won. Yes, he died for my ransom and rose up on [singing and music] the third day. Cause my God [singing and music] is greater than death. Hell and the grave. So I won't be shed. I won't be [singing] moved. My God is faithful. His promise is true. &gt;&gt; So I'll speak to the mountain. [singing] Tell him it's time [music] to move. &gt;&gt; Cuz my God [singing] is bigger, better, stronger, greater than you. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Just play it softly now, brothers. Whoever heads bowed. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know it's just a simple message. But you see, God will hide and reveal himself [music] in simplicity. &gt;&gt; And it does no good to talk about the message. It does no good to talk about the Holy Ghost. The hours come that we must apply the Holy Ghost. [music] For when I see the blood, I will pass over you. And God has placed the blood shill upon every true born again believer. &gt;&gt; You can stand here with this confidence that your God will not fail you. We're living in such a troublesome time. Wars and rumors of wars, pestilence, earthquakes, and diverse places. Just had one yesterday. I believe it was out in Oregon off the coast. 6.0 earthquake. She's shaking loose. Everything's pointing. Oh my. But God said in this hour when you see these things begin to come to pass, he didn't say give up, walk away, but he said lift up your head. Your redemption draweth nigh. And as we see the world coming into their position, coming into their anointing for destruction. So is there another group of people who's coming under a different anointing? It's an anointing for deliverance. Oh my. Or are you under the blood, friend? Mom, dad, brother, sister. It's not how long you've been in the message. We've seen people in this message for years, preached it, now they've [music] turned and walked away from it. It's not enough to say you're in it, but is it in you today? You see, God God don't want just to be above us. He don't want to just be with us, but he wants to be in us. &gt;&gt; Well, can we yield oursel to him today? Can each of us and each believer, every preacher, brother, sister, mama, daddy, boy, girl, young people? You say, "Brother, I I realize this message is maybe more towards the young people, but we're all young at heart. &gt;&gt; But each of us, are we willing to surrender? Are we willing to come into our position? Just be what God made me to be. That's all he wants me to be. He made the oak tree because he wanted an oak tree. He made the maple tree cuz he wanted a maple tree. And he made you because he wanted you that way before he was ever born, before the foundation of the world. He knew the color of your skin, the color of your eyes, the color of your hair. Oh my. He even knew your name. [music] Lord, do you love him today? And if you're here, friends, [music] and maybe you let the devil beat you down. Maybe you're like Saul in his army that you're dismayed. But I say, little David. Oh, little David, realize who you are today. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to meet the challenge. Don't be afraid to meet that devil and back him off your [music] property, trying to take your children, trying to take your family. Stand your ground today. [singing] &gt;&gt; Defy, &gt;&gt; oh my the lies of Satan. If you're here today and you have that need, whatever the need would be, you said, "Brother D, I realize what you're saying. I am a David. He has called me for this. I will not back down. Oh, I will take my confession." What is a stone? It's a confession. I'll take my confession today and I'll bring it to the eye of the enemy. Oh my. Don't you see, brother, sister, when David let go of that stone, where did it hit? The only place that wasn't covered, right between the eyes. Oh my. God knows how to hit the mark. Don't be afraid to [music] let the sling go. &gt;&gt; If you're here today and you have that need, I wonder if you would just slip up to your feet and say, "God, [music] I have a need today." Maybe it's it's sickness. I don't know, friend. Maybe you're weary. &gt;&gt; Maybe you feel like just quitting. You know, you're coming into a new year and seem like everything's [music] going wrong. But if you're here and you have a need, I just wonder if you stay if you just want to get closer to God in this 26. This fellowship is so good for the churches to come together. We're a body of believers. We need one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Toronto 25 years they tried to catch him and they couldn't. He finally just surrendered and the White Mountain Apaches that tracked him down. They put him on the same train with Dono shipped him down to Florida. And while they was on that train, one of Dono's warriors said it was wrong to trust the white man. Everything he said to us was a lie. And one of Geronom's warriors said to the to the Apaches that tracked them down, he said, "I hate you." AS LONG AS THERE'S BREATH IN MY BODY, I'll hate you. Why didn't you leave us alone? This was our land. WE WERE SERVING our God. He gave US THIS LAND. WHY DID YOU TRACK us down like that? I'll hate you as long as there's breath in my body. And they said, Geronimus spoke up and said, do not hate him. There's too few of us left to hate one another. &gt;&gt; Oh, little bride. We may not go to the same church, but we're in the same body. &gt;&gt; We need one another. I need you. You need me. We need each other. [music and singing] Here's what I want us to do. &gt;&gt; Maybe that person standing beside you really has a need today. But here's what I want us to do. Just reach over and lay handsh on the person beside you. brother to brother, sister, sister, husband, family, whatever it would be. And I want us to pray. Oh my, you're God-given right. The man that wrote the book said, "The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much." Recognize who you are today. Exercise your God-given right. Pray for that brother. Pray for that sister. Oh, that they'll be drawn closer to God. That they'll be healed. That their families will be saved. Whatever's in their heart, how you feel, just lay pray for them this morning. Will you do it? [music] Amen. Almighty God, we stand before you today in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh God, we come, Father, knowing that there's no greater name than the name of Jesus. And we speak that name today over our brother, over our sister. And God, I don't know what they have need of, but thou knowest all things today, Lord. And God, if they're here, if they're sick, if they're weary, if they're having marital trouble, financial trouble, whatever the need would be today, if they need MORE OF YOU, GOD, I PRAY BY THAT ANOINTING THAT raised my Lord from the grave. May that anointing fall among us right now, oh God. And may you move from one to the other to the other. It's not based on a sensation. IT'S NOT BASED on a goosebump. It's based upon believing your word. And today we believe, oh God, you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. Move [snorts] up on my brother. Move up on my sister. SATAN, I ADJURE THEE BY GOD. YOU ARE DEFEATED. YOU'RE NOTHING BUT a bluff. I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ. LEAVE MY BROTHER. LEAVE MY SISTER for the glory of God today. The son of God has made us free. And who the son hath made free is free indeed. I am free to worship my God in spirit and in truth. I AM FREE TO STAND UPON MY GODGIVEN RIGHT. The man that wrote the book said so. The man that wrote the book said, "I'm an overcomer." The man that wrote the book said, "I'm predestinated." The man that wrote the book said, "I'm anointed. I'm chosen. I'm called. I'm elected. I'm placed for such a time as this." &gt;&gt; And I receive it today in the name [music] of Jesus Christ. For the glory of God. For the glory of God. In Jesus name. Say something. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I [singing] won't [music] be shamed. I won't [singing] be moved. [snorts] My God is faithful. [singing] His promise [music] is true. So I'll speak to the mountain telling [singing and music] it's time to move. Because my God [singing and music] is bigger, better, stronger, greater than [singing] you. [music] Listen, when my daughter was hurt real bad, two of my family [music] was killed. I went down to the chapel at the hospital and I laid in the floor of that hospital chapel and I cried out to God. I didn't care who heard [music] me. I didn't care who saw me. My baby was dying. And I said, "Lord," I said, "If you was here like you were 2,000 years ago." I said, "All I have to do is touch the hymn of your garment and I could go upstairs and get my baby and take her home." I said, "But Lord, you're not here like that today in that body that you were 2,000 years ago." And God is my witness. While I was laying on the floor, something spoke to my heart and said, "BUT MY BRIDE IS HERE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; If you touch her, you've touched me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I jumped up from that floor because I realized all I had to do was get this brother, this brother, this brother, this sister to COME AND LAY HANDS UPON MY DAUGHTER. IT WAS JUST THE SAME AS JESUS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE HE FAILED TODAY. &gt;&gt; Do you realize who you are? Do you realize who you are? &gt;&gt; We're sons and daughters of the most high God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. Let's sing it again as we turn the service over. Hallelujah. Oh, why would I worry when giants come calling in my name? [music and singing] &gt;&gt; My God is so much bigger. Troules [music] I [singing] would [music] hunger for power or riches or fame. [singing] Oh my God [music] is so much better in all of these [singing] things. [music] So I won't be shen. I won't be moved. [singing] &gt;&gt; I trust it was okay. &gt;&gt; My God is faithful. [singing] His promise is true. [music] the line out to the mountain. It's time to move cuz my God is bigger, [music] better, stronger, greater than you. Let's sing it one more time. So I won't be shaking. [singing] I won't be moved. My God is faithful. His promise is true. So I'll speak to [singing] the mountains. His kind. [singing] [music] My God is bigger, better, stronger, and [music and singing] greater than. &gt;&gt; One more time. Take sing it to him. &gt;&gt; I won't be shamed. I won't [music and singing] be moved. &gt;&gt; You're saying that to the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's hearing what you're confessing. [singing] &gt;&gt; His promise is true. So I'll speak to the mountain. [singing] It's time to move. My God is bigger, better, stronger, greater [singing and music] than you. Yes, he is. Amen. God bless you. Enjoy that. Let's give our brother a hand. [applause] [music] You know, the devil can't get anything over on God cuz God the he's the originator and Satan's the impostor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan just didn't know, brother Tony, when he anointed that big old giant to walk down into that field [music] and he created that rock before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; And that rock was predestinated during the flood. God just took his finger and he draw a a little line and here comes the water. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. And over all the years, all that water flowed over those rocks for one [music] purpose. &gt;&gt; Goliath didn't know he was looking at what it was fixing to destroy him. And God had already prepared it. He prepared the smoothest stone. Brother David, five of them. Left them right there after the flood. They stayed there forever how long it was. And they stayed there until David picked them up. And when he picked him up, he had fulfilled God's plan that he saw before even the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; So that rock was a mountain at one time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So when the flood happened, it just tore pieces of that rock off and laid her down in a valley. Brother Martin laid him right in that valley, stopped five stones right where David walked across. He picked up the five stones God saw before the foundation of the world that was going to do Goliath in. Goliath just didn't know he was defeated before he was even born. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Satan is defeated before he was even made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can't do anything but fail. &gt;&gt; There's nothing he can do but fail. &gt;&gt; Boy, what a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. [music] &gt;&gt; That's right. And to know that David standing there and he he looked at that giant got it. He looked at that giant and he knew that a prophet had anointed him several years before that. &gt;&gt; And you know what he done? He believed his prophet. That sound familiar? He believed what his prophet said about him. You will be king. Now, the only way to be a king in Israel, you have to have a crown and [music] a throne. A crown and a throne. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; David didn't have that yet. He was still in his early journey. &gt;&gt; So, whatever your Goliath is, you must see yourself sitting on the throne. Hello, somebody. Revelations 5 said, "We priests and kings." &gt;&gt; Amen. And Revelation's over there in about 20 says there's thrones &gt;&gt; and we're sitting on those thrones. Why? Because we've defeated the Goliath [music] in our life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what David was looking at. He was looking He was looking right straight through Goliath and looking at at at Jerusalem where that throne was and he was going to sit on that throne. You got to see that. Remember brother Ram told us he said he said Abraham saw the baby before it was born. Remember he said he went ahead and bought the birdies and the booty eyes and he brought everything. He got everything ready before there was even one one feeling he was making ready. So today let's make ready this year. Let's make ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That this year we're going to see something we've never seen before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's going to work more powerful than he's ever worked before. But he's going to work through me and you. But we've got to believe that we are that David that has already been anointed &gt;&gt; to be priests and kings. If you believe what your prophet said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That God's in his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if God's in his people, you've already won. &gt;&gt; I like that song. We've already won. &gt;&gt; It's already done. We just got to go through it. We got to go through the game, but we've already won. &gt;&gt; We appreciate all of you coming. God bless you. We love you with the love of the Lord. Please stay and eat with us. We got plenty of food downstairs. If you don't have anywhere to go tomorrow, Brother Daryl will be here in the morning at starting at 10:00 with the sorry with the Sunday school class at 10:00 and then uh just pray for us all. Pray for brother Daryl tomorrow as he goes back home. It's supposed to be snowing up there a little bit. So So just pray for them him as he travels. [music] It happened the last time he was here. He was here last year at this time. Same thing happened. It was 3 in of snow when he got home. So, let's just pray that the Lord will keep the roads open for him. But I want him to be back tomorrow so he can give us some more of that. &gt;&gt; I want some more of them stones. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Stones revelation, right? I want some more of those stones. &gt;&gt; David, show up tomorrow. Let's get some stones and let's defeat any giant that you have in your life. &gt;&gt; He'll do it for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord. Let's bless the food and and and thank you all for coming. If I missed anybody, I'm sorry. Uh, I think everybody's been here before. So, God bless you. Let's [clears throat] bow our heads. Dear heavenly father, Lord, what a message. What a message we have, Lord, that as our brother said before the even before the foundation of the world, this plan and purpose was in your mind. And the prophet of God told us that you saw something that you wanted to achieve. So, you made a plan and you made a purpose. And we know you can't change. Lord, we just got to realize we're a part of that plan and put the pieces together, Lord, down here on this earth where we are. You saw us come to a place, Lord, to where Satan can't have any hold on us. For, Father, we're heading to that. We must listen to the word of God. The prophet said, he said that that our glorified bodies being built around our born again experience that as we become the word as we eat the word. So, Lord, there's nothing else for us to eat except the word of God. But Father, we got natural food downstairs that we have to eat because we're in these old human bodies and we have to have fuel. And Father, I pray that you'd sanctify it, Lord, and it nourish our bodies. Be with the ones, Lord, that have to travel afterwards today. Father, I pray that you'd be with each one, Lord, that has a need. I believe there was a lot of needs met tonight, Lord. And I believe that we're continuing to believe that you are the great physician, the great Lord Jesus Christ. We ask these things in your precious name. Lord, go with us now in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You're dismissed. &gt;&gt; Oh, listen. We've got a uh we've got our Valentine's banquet coming up uh February 21st at 3:00. If you look on our website, you'll see the um you'll see the flyer. Everyone's invited. If you come to this church, it's free. If you don't come to the church, it's $30. But we want you to come as a as couples and we'll have a a wonderful time. So, God bless you. Love you with the love of the Lord. Thank you. You're dismissed. [music] Death [singing and music] has to flee. Now there [singing] is light [music] where darkness used to be. Now there is hope. [music] There's [singing] no more doubt. Praise his name. Praise his name. He's [singing] in the house. Death has to flee. Now there is [singing] light where darkness used to be. [music] Now [singing] there is
