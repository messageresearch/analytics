[50:31] or shoot them before they get there so
[50:33] praise the Lord some of y'all ought to

[50:37] Arrow we got several here today that
[50:39] shot bow and arrow at competition today

[50:45] brother-in-law back here they have their
[50:47] family so get the kids involved what are
[50:49] you saying well you know kids are kids
[50:51] let's get them involved in something
[50:53] let's get them involved in something
[50:55] that they can do I thank God that that
[50:57] our sisters and and young men especially
[51:00] our sisters do things with their with
[51:02] their dresses on and they're not ashamed
[51:04] of it and we see them playing basketball
[51:06] I got no problem with that at all you
[51:08] know go do what you need to do if you
[51:10] can do it in a dress
[51:11] um you're fine just just do it for the
[51:14] glory of the Lord and and um I believe
[51:16] God will honor you because uh his
[51:18] brother William and I were talking just
[51:19] a few minutes ago
[51:21] you know there's a lot of things about
[51:23] church and all but but you know if we
[51:26] don't have another generation
[51:28] if if the Lord does tarry another 10
[51:30] years
[51:32] we got another generation that's going
[51:34] to have to take over from the older
[51:35] generation
[51:37] if not brother Ravi there's going to be
[51:38] a big gap there God's never going to
[51:40] have a gap
[51:42] he's going to have a group of people
[51:43] that's going to continue and you see it
[51:45] as as 50 Years brother Dale's been here
[51:47] we see how that would come in and become
[51:49] you know deacons we got brother Michael
[51:51] he'll be here tomorrow but you know come
[51:54] in grow up in the church and become
[51:55] leading singing and then become
[51:59] teaching the young adults in Sunday
[52:01] school class so I like to see
[52:03] each one developed like that good to see
[52:05] brother Levi you know graduating high
[52:07] school there was a time when I was
[52:09] growing up in the message in the 70s
[52:11] that it was taboo
[52:13] to graduate high school
[52:16] because they said brother Brown said get
[52:17] them out of you know educations of the
[52:20] devil so they start pulling them out at
[52:21] 16 years old and putting them to work
[52:23] well guess what
[52:25] that don't work I believe in education I
[52:29] believe you ought to get an education
[52:30] you ought to get a good education
[52:31] because without it you're not going to
[52:32] be able to survive in this world you're
[52:35] going to need a good education and then
[52:37] you need somebody like brother John
[52:39] Durant to teach you how to use your
[52:40] money and then but good to see brother
[52:42] John back he got in last night good to
[52:44] see you back buddy

[52:53] to go to Poland for his job and he got
[52:55] back and it was surprised to see him

[56:30] it

[56:33] God's grace is sufficient we certainly
[56:35] appreciate each and every one of you
[56:37] we're happy to to be with you again we'd
[56:39] like to thank brother Wade for having us
[56:40] brother Sammy Adele and all the ministry
[56:43] team here we certainly love and
[56:44] appreciate each and every one of you I'd
[56:46] like to thank brother Bob and sister
[56:47] Monica for putting up with us this
[56:50] weekend and then My Brother Sam sister
[56:52] Sharon driving up from Kentucky and uh
[56:54] you know as I was going to mention the
[56:56] same thing as brother way to mentioned
[56:57] you know we kind of had a little mini
[56:59] family reunion there and then we come
[57:01] here
[57:02] and the family reunion continues the
[57:05] family of God that's the greatest family
[57:06] that is the real family brother Ben so
[57:09] good to see you my dear brother that is
[57:10] a real family is a family of God Amen so
[57:14] we're so thankful for each and every one
[57:15] of you in the stand that you take here
[57:16] and you know this is the only message
[57:18] church I think by the way that has
[57:19] banjos that I know of but I love it I
[57:23] love it I love the banjo so we're
[57:25] thankful for that and we just bring you
[57:26] greetings from the home church amen
[57:28] brother Ron bro they injuring all this
[57:30] in their love and appreciation to you
[57:32] all and brother Ron we thank he thanks
[57:35] you for all the prayers he's just
[57:36] fighting the good fight you know Satan
[57:38] attacks us all in different ways and
[57:40] um you know and he's just standing
[57:42] standing strong God is great sufficient
[57:44] giving him strength he preaches every
[57:46] Sunday and so we're thankful for that
[57:48] and uh Satan sometimes thinks he just
[57:51] kind of attack us and what it does is it
[57:53] actually just squeezes the character of
[57:55] God right out of our Lives there's
[57:57] things in you brother Aaron that you may
[57:59] not realize is there and God will allow
[58:01] that trial come by allow Satan to maybe
[58:03] touch your life a little bit make you
[58:05] cry out to God and it just gets more
[58:08] character right out of you the character
[58:10] that is laying there and because that's
[58:12] the only way it comes out is through
[58:13] trials and sufferings none of us look
[58:15] for it none of us ask for it none of us
[58:17] jump up and down that a trial has come
[58:18] our way but God has a purpose and a plan
[58:20] for each and every one the Bible tells
[58:23] us that it's more than pure gold
[58:26] you think about that pure gold because
[58:27] the gold will perish but the the
[58:30] character that you have my brother will
[58:32] you will have throughout all eternity
[58:34] you can't Reign without suffering
[58:37] amen so we'll just not keep you standing
[58:40] here if you'll just turn with me with
[58:41] Romans 8 31
[58:45] . amen praise the Lord with the help of
[58:46] as your turn with the help of the Lord
[58:48] I'd like to speak to you on more than
[58:50] the conquerors
[58:52] amen a few Brothers in the back could
[58:54] turn it up just a little bit or do I
[58:56] have the microphone high enough is this
[58:58] good brother wait okay
[59:00] all right so Romans chapter 8 verse 30
[59:02] 31 will begin reading what shall we save
[59:06] into these things
[59:08] if God before us who can be against us
[59:11] he that spare not his own son but
[59:13] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[59:16] not with him also freely give us all
[59:18] things who shall lay anything to the
[59:21] charge of God's elect it is God that
[59:24] justifieth
[59:26] who is he that condemneth it is God it
[59:28] is Christ that died yea rather that is
[59:30] risen again who is even at the right
[59:32] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[59:35] for us who shall separate us from the
[59:37] love of Christ shall tribulation or
[59:40] distress or persecution
[59:42] or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword
[59:44] as it is written for thy sake we are
[59:46] killed all the day long we are accounted
[59:48] as sheep for the slaughter nay in all of
[59:51] these things we are more than conquerors
[59:54] through him that loved us for I am
[59:57] persuaded at neither death nor life nor
[59:59] angels nor principalities nor powers nor
[1:00:01] things present
[1:00:03] nor things to come nor height nor death
[1:00:06] nor any other creature shall be able to
[1:00:09] separate us from the love of God which
[1:00:11] is in Christ Jesus our lord amen let's
[1:00:14] bow our heads the gracious Heavenly
[1:00:15] Father we thank you Lord Jesus for this
[1:00:17] assembly
[1:00:18] we thank you Lord Jesus for each and
[1:00:20] every one that's made their way to the
[1:00:21] house of the Lord and father we've
[1:00:23] gathered here Lord not to hear from man
[1:00:24] but to hear from you we just pray Lord
[1:00:27] now as we look to you father both
[1:00:28] speaker and here alike we ask that you
[1:00:30] just move us out of the way Lord not
[1:00:32] only I as a speaker but the hearer
[1:00:34] themselves father may they hear from you
[1:00:36] and we'll all in turn give you all the
[1:00:37] praise honor and Glory meet each and
[1:00:40] every need father touch the sick and
[1:00:42] needy father and have your way in this
[1:00:43] service in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:00:45] and ask all these things amen amen God
[1:00:47] bless you may be seated
[1:00:49] as you're seated I'll also read
[1:00:51] Ephesians 6 verse 10 very familiar text
[1:00:54] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:00:56] Lord and in the power of His might put
[1:00:59] on the whole armor of God that ye may be
[1:01:02] able to stand against The Wiles of the
[1:01:04] devil
[1:01:05] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:01:07] blood but against principalities against
[1:01:09] Powers against the rulers of the
[1:01:11] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:01:13] wickedness in high places wherefore take
[1:01:17] unto you the whole armor of God that ye
[1:01:19] may be able to withstand in the evil day
[1:01:22] we're living in that evil day so the
[1:01:24] scripture tells us if you want to be
[1:01:26] able to withstand in the evil day and
[1:01:29] having done all you can to stand
[1:01:31] stand therefore
[1:01:33] having your loins gird about with the
[1:01:35] truth and having on the breastplate of
[1:01:37] righteousness in your your feet shot
[1:01:39] with the preparation of the gospel of
[1:01:41] peace above all taking the shield of
[1:01:44] Faith wherewith he shall be able to
[1:01:46] quench
[1:01:47] some of the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:01:49] does that sound right no all of the
[1:01:52] fiery darts of the wicked
[1:01:54] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[1:01:56] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[1:02:00] God Amen you know the word of God is
[1:02:02] eternal and it doesn't matter what how
[1:02:04] the world changes the word of God never
[1:02:06] changes so to you young people it
[1:02:08] doesn't matter in what stage and age and
[1:02:11] season of life that you're in the word
[1:02:13] is still the same
[1:02:14] the generation your parents are of
[1:02:16] another Generation Well when your
[1:02:18] parents were your age they were reading
[1:02:20] the same scriptures and drawing strength
[1:02:23] from the same Promises of God and help
[1:02:25] them overcome the enemy in their age
[1:02:28] and now the same word gives you the
[1:02:30] strength to overcome the enemy in this
[1:02:33] age
[1:02:34] because remember just because we're we
[1:02:37] may be older doesn't mean that we quit
[1:02:39] fighting the devil
[1:02:40] the battles may change but the enemy is
[1:02:44] still the same and we depend on the same
[1:02:46] word of God
[1:02:48] now there was a man Alexander Hamilton
[1:02:50] he's actually on the ten dollar bill and
[1:02:52] he was one of the founding fathers and
[1:02:54] he's uh he's quoted as saying
[1:02:56] if you don't stand for something
[1:02:59] you'll fall for anything
[1:03:02] and that's that's Humanity in a nutshell
[1:03:05] when they don't know where to stand they
[1:03:06] don't have a truth they don't even know
[1:03:08] what's truth many of them don't even
[1:03:10] have the desire for truth the enemy
[1:03:13] blows Every Which Way the influences of
[1:03:15] the world come the pulls of the world
[1:03:17] come and drags them in every different
[1:03:19] direction it's where they don't even
[1:03:20] know what gender they belong to anymore
[1:03:22] because they don't stand on anything to
[1:03:25] be able to say this is the truth if you
[1:03:27] know what truth is then you can discern
[1:03:30] what's not truth
[1:03:32] but if you don't even understand what
[1:03:34] the truth is then the enemy can battle
[1:03:36] you and get you to reason
[1:03:39] against the word of God in first John 4
[1:03:42] 4 ye are of God little children and have
[1:03:45] overcome them because greater is he that
[1:03:48] is in you than he that is in the world
[1:03:53] now the importance is very important
[1:03:55] this is for both young people and old
[1:03:57] and older people like old people doesn't
[1:03:59] matter your age is that you see that we
[1:04:01] see ourselves through the eyes of the
[1:04:04] word
[1:04:06] now this is important in two ways that
[1:04:08] I'm going to dwell a little bit here
[1:04:09] because you can be a holy ghost
[1:04:11] Christian elect of God on your way to
[1:04:14] heaven but because you're not looking
[1:04:16] because you may have a little spiritual
[1:04:18] Amnesia and you're not looking at
[1:04:20] yourself through the word of God you
[1:04:21] think that you're a sinner you don't
[1:04:23] feel safe you feel so terrible because
[1:04:25] you're not looking at yourself through
[1:04:27] the word of God and on the flip side of
[1:04:30] that someone like the Pharisee can have
[1:04:32] or a spirit of a Pharisee
[1:04:35] and feel that they're so religious and
[1:04:37] they're so self-righteous but they don't
[1:04:39] search the scriptures to see that they
[1:04:41] even need God
[1:04:42] and that is where the danger can even
[1:04:44] come in when we're raising the message
[1:04:46] is that no matter that you've never done
[1:04:48] drugs it doesn't matter that you've
[1:04:49] never been hooked on pornography it
[1:04:51] nothing matters the fact that you're
[1:04:54] born you need Lord Jesus Christ it
[1:04:57] doesn't matter that you've never done
[1:04:58] that that you can't come up with a list
[1:05:00] of sins you need to be saved you need to
[1:05:04] be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:07] so it's important that we see ourselves
[1:05:10] through what God says about us if God
[1:05:13] says we're forgiven then we're forgiven
[1:05:15] if God says that we're Justified we're
[1:05:18] Justified
[1:05:19] and no devil in hell can change that
[1:05:23] now
[1:05:24] I was listening to a tape in the sermon
[1:05:26] here on what is the Holy Ghost the
[1:05:28] prophet of God I love his honesty
[1:05:31] whenever we we you know he's just so
[1:05:34] honest he tells his he he talks about
[1:05:37] his life and his life as an open book
[1:05:39] and it begins to tell a story here
[1:05:42] and it says there is nothing that will
[1:05:44] ever defeat Satan there has never been
[1:05:47] nothing on the earth yet that would ever
[1:05:49] defeat Satan like the word of God Jesus
[1:05:52] used it in his great battle he said it
[1:05:54] is written he said in this morning while
[1:05:56] I've been listening a few days ago to a
[1:05:58] broadcast that seemed to want to tell
[1:06:01] that creation just come from some ashes
[1:06:02] blowing together
[1:06:04] and some phosphate and a few chemicals
[1:06:06] of the earth and the warm sunshine
[1:06:08] created The Germ of life and brought out
[1:06:10] life how ridiculous when the sunshine
[1:06:12] will kill any germ of Life lay a germ
[1:06:14] out there in the sunshine it'll kill it
[1:06:16] immediately and there was no such a
[1:06:17] thing but Satan trying to punch at me
[1:06:21] the seventh Church age messenger and
[1:06:25] Satan is trying to punch at him
[1:06:28] and after I had taken my little Rebecca
[1:06:30] to school this morning
[1:06:32] he just still had his Monday morning
[1:06:34] chores
[1:06:36] okay and on the road back I started to
[1:06:39] turn the radio on again and I thought I
[1:06:41] would not get into that stuff so I'll
[1:06:42] just turn it back off and I was going up
[1:06:44] the street Satan said to me he said do
[1:06:48] you know that this man that you called
[1:06:50] Jesus was just a man like one in his day
[1:06:54] like Billy Graham or Oral Roberts
[1:06:57] here you have the prophet of God and you
[1:07:00] have Satan cometh to him and he's trying
[1:07:02] of all the Miracles that he's seen
[1:07:04] brother Bob see the angel of the Lord
[1:07:06] meeting an angel in a cave and Satan
[1:07:09] still comes to him and said you know
[1:07:10] this Jesus that you preach about he was
[1:07:12] just a man
[1:07:14] he started to form a little click and
[1:07:16] then all of a sudden it spun and it spun
[1:07:17] and it grew and he was just a man and
[1:07:19] you're worshiping a man
[1:07:21] Satan was punching that at him
[1:07:25] he was just a man
[1:07:27] and they began to have a few people to
[1:07:28] gather around him and say he's a great
[1:07:30] man and after a while become greater and
[1:07:32] then I become a God to them and now it's
[1:07:34] scattered all over the world since he's
[1:07:36] dead and that's all Satan fighting him
[1:07:39] brother Brown was having a mind battle
[1:07:43] I thought how a liar that you are
[1:07:48] he said I said Satan you that's talking
[1:07:51] to my conscience I'd like to ask you a
[1:07:54] few things now notice the prophet of God
[1:07:56] took the same example that Jesus gave
[1:07:59] when Satan tempted him
[1:08:00] the prophet did not say Satan remember
[1:08:03] that person that was healed remember the
[1:08:05] angel met me in the cave remember when I
[1:08:07] was baptizing on the Ohio River he
[1:08:09] didn't refer to a single miracle that he
[1:08:11] experienced Satan took Satan brother
[1:08:14] Bram took Satan right back to the word
[1:08:16] of God
[1:08:18] so how should that encourage you how
[1:08:21] should that encourage me we can't take
[1:08:23] we can't say Satan I met the angel of
[1:08:25] the Lord
[1:08:26] while in a cave I baptized I've seen the
[1:08:30] Miracles but yet you can take listen now
[1:08:32] you can take the Satan right back to the
[1:08:38] same experience that brother Branham had
[1:08:41] amen not the experience of meeting an
[1:08:43] angel in a cave but meeting the same
[1:08:45] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:47] so you have the same born-again
[1:08:50] experience that the prophet had
[1:08:53] and you're able to then take the enemy
[1:08:55] back to your own Burning Sands back to
[1:08:58] your burning bush so here you have the
[1:09:01] prophet that begins to bring up out of
[1:09:03] his entire Ministry he brings up the
[1:09:05] word to Satan
[1:09:08] he said I said Satan you that's talking
[1:09:11] to my conscience I'd like to ask you a
[1:09:13] few things
[1:09:14] who was it that the Hebrew Prophet spoke
[1:09:17] that would come who was the anointed
[1:09:19] Messiah what was that what was upon
[1:09:21] those men that foresaw him and told his
[1:09:23] life thousands of years and he goes on
[1:09:25] through and then he promised the Holy
[1:09:26] Ghost and I've got it
[1:09:30] so you just might as well get away from
[1:09:33] it because it's written in the word and
[1:09:35] every word is true
[1:09:37] then he left
[1:09:41] just give him the word that does it he
[1:09:45] can't stand the word for it's inspired
[1:09:49] out of everything he gave him the word
[1:09:51] test he has the same word he had the
[1:09:54] same word to fight the enemy with that
[1:09:56] you do brother Zach
[1:09:57] now now listen
[1:09:59] Satan try that to him about the Bible
[1:10:03] Satan will try that with you about the
[1:10:05] Bible
[1:10:06] but he'll also try that with you about
[1:10:07] the message
[1:10:10] remember because if he can get you away
[1:10:12] from the message well you get you to
[1:10:14] doubt that but then take this and he's
[1:10:17] getting you in your mind to separate the
[1:10:19] two he's got you off your ground
[1:10:22] he's got you wobbling
[1:10:25] right and while you're wobbling like
[1:10:26] they do in boxing that's the time when
[1:10:28] the boxer goes in and finishes him off
[1:10:29] when he's wobbling
[1:10:33] so Satan will come to you and he'll try
[1:10:35] and cast out maybe it won't begin with
[1:10:37] the prophet maybe it'll begin with your
[1:10:38] pastor maybe it'll begin with your
[1:10:40] parents and he begins to try and get you
[1:10:43] off of your ground
[1:10:46] and once you're off the ground and you
[1:10:48] begin to doubt the prophet then you
[1:10:51] begin then you begin to doubt the word
[1:10:53] and there's no bottom to it
[1:10:57] because if you remember if the message
[1:11:00] was wrong
[1:11:01] it would not only it it would not only
[1:11:04] not produce what it's saying
[1:11:06] but Satan wouldn't attack it
[1:11:09] Satan don't attack the other religions
[1:11:13] because there's no truth to it
[1:11:15] remember in in Genesis 28 Jacob only
[1:11:19] knew God as the god of Abraham and Isaac
[1:11:24] he did not know God as his God until
[1:11:27] later until after he wrestled with an
[1:11:30] Angel
[1:11:31] and when he wrestled with an angel even
[1:11:33] the scripture at first whenever he's
[1:11:34] talking when he when they record the
[1:11:36] story of Jacob it's always the god of
[1:11:37] Abraham and Isaac the god of Abraham and
[1:11:40] Isaac made this Covenant but after Jacob
[1:11:42] had an experience with the angel he then
[1:11:45] became the god of Abraham of Isaac and
[1:11:49] of Jacob
[1:11:51] after he wrestled with the angel and you
[1:11:54] have to wrestle with the mighty angel
[1:11:58] not with the prophet messenger you have
[1:12:00] to wrestle it out with the angel the
[1:12:02] mighty Angel Revelations 10 1 and then
[1:12:05] it won't just be the message of your
[1:12:07] parents it won't just be the message of
[1:12:10] your pastor it won't just be the
[1:12:12] prophet's message it'll be your message
[1:12:16] it'll be the message it'll be Jesus
[1:12:19] Christ your Jesus Christ your message
[1:12:23] it won't just be do's and don'ts it
[1:12:25] won't be just things I've got to do it
[1:12:28] will be your message and then Satan can
[1:12:31] never take that away from you
[1:12:35] the Lord Jesus Christ will make this
[1:12:36] message yours
[1:12:38] then it's not just Doctrine it is the
[1:12:41] literal life of Jesus Christ
[1:12:45] there's natural elements that we're all
[1:12:47] a part of there's natural jobs that we
[1:12:49] have and natural livings in schools and
[1:12:50] in events but we cannot lose the focus
[1:12:53] that the real thing
[1:12:56] is what's behind the veil
[1:12:58] the message people see people see a lot
[1:13:01] of impersonation
[1:13:02] and people see hypocrisy and they try
[1:13:04] and throw the whole thing away but there
[1:13:06] is reality and remember the true message
[1:13:09] the true message believer had to be
[1:13:12] there first
[1:13:14] before a scandal in a message Church
[1:13:17] made you down
[1:13:23] there's lots of counterfeit money out
[1:13:25] there
[1:13:26] but it doesn't stop any of us from
[1:13:28] making transactions does it just because
[1:13:31] there's counterfeit well I'm not I've
[1:13:33] got a thousand dollars in my pocket to
[1:13:35] buy to buy this I need it a hundred
[1:13:37] dollars or whatever but I'm not gonna
[1:13:38] buy it because there's so much
[1:13:40] counterfeit and this may be counterfeit
[1:13:44] this message is reality and it is the
[1:13:47] only reality that produces a real
[1:13:49] husband
[1:13:50] it is the only reality that produces a
[1:13:52] real life
[1:13:54] it is the only reality that that
[1:13:56] produces a true friend
[1:13:58] there's good people out there you've got
[1:14:01] good neighbors you've got good people in
[1:14:02] your community and they're wonderful
[1:14:06] but this message produces exactly what
[1:14:08] it's spoken
[1:14:12] the world has no Godly control tower
[1:14:15] but the Holy Ghost in US is what is the
[1:14:18] control tower
[1:14:19] because you see Satan is a devil
[1:14:22] and Satan don't care about you
[1:14:27] God cares he's proved that
[1:14:31] right Satan don't care
[1:14:33] Satan will pretend that he cares until
[1:14:36] he draws you away
[1:14:39] right from those that you love from
[1:14:41] those that really care
[1:14:43] he'll make you think they don't care and
[1:14:46] make you think he's the one that's
[1:14:47] caring and when he's got you surrounded
[1:14:50] then he'll leave you
[1:14:54] right you won't feel so care then you'll
[1:14:55] feel used and abused
[1:14:58] now Satan will never come around to tell
[1:15:01] you that you need Jesus
[1:15:03] but he will say you don't need him
[1:15:06] you know years ago there's people you
[1:15:08] know you can go on the internet and look
[1:15:09] this up and and just take it
[1:15:12] for whatever it is but people can have
[1:15:14] near-death experiences and they've got
[1:15:16] experiences of Heaven and Hell and
[1:15:17] they've got their different their
[1:15:18] stories behind it
[1:15:20] there was this one man on the internet
[1:15:21] and he was talking about having an
[1:15:23] experience of hell and he might have
[1:15:24] even been an Atheist I don't remember
[1:15:25] the story but the point I'm trying to
[1:15:27] make is he's he went there and he's seen
[1:15:29] that there were and when he came back he
[1:15:31] became a Christian but when he went
[1:15:32] there he's seen that demons were
[1:15:34] tormenting people
[1:15:36] souls in hell and as these demons were
[1:15:39] tormenting them the demons what he kept
[1:15:41] hearing because he kept hearing the
[1:15:42] demons say you stupid stupid humans
[1:15:46] you stupid stupid we tricked you
[1:15:50] you see that's what Satan does he is a
[1:15:52] Deceiver
[1:15:53] and he'll make you he'll give you a
[1:15:55] mirage and make you think that that you
[1:15:57] just have the World by the tail and in
[1:15:59] reality you want to be led by god of
[1:16:02] what kind of life you should live you
[1:16:04] want to be led by a god what person that
[1:16:06] you should marry
[1:16:08] you God cares about the little things
[1:16:12] because you see Satan will focus his
[1:16:14] attacks
[1:16:15] on the young people
[1:16:17] and specifically
[1:16:19] because they're pure
[1:16:21] they're innocent
[1:16:23] and as they begin to mature into
[1:16:25] teenagers and as they begin to ensure
[1:16:27] and mature they have a lot of energy
[1:16:29] they get Ambitions they get plans and
[1:16:31] they get choices and Satan will get into
[1:16:33] them details
[1:16:35] and he'll get the energy and the passion
[1:16:37] that a teenager or young person may have
[1:16:40] and instead of using it for God's glory
[1:16:42] in the Zeal and Lord what do you want me
[1:16:44] to do where do you want me to go lead me
[1:16:47] he'll then misuse that and send them out
[1:16:50] in the world
[1:16:52] and spend their energies
[1:16:55] on the world
[1:16:56] because Satan tries to infiltrate the
[1:16:59] desires and choices that you have to
[1:17:01] make
[1:17:02] to bring you down a bad path
[1:17:05] all the decisions our lives are full of
[1:17:07] decisions
[1:17:10] he'd like to take your passion and
[1:17:11] energy and re redirect it to sinful
[1:17:14] things and a lot of times that can begin
[1:17:16] with a disrespect of parents
[1:17:19] in first Samuel 15 23 the Bible says for
[1:17:22] Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft
[1:17:24] and stubbornness as iniquity in idolatry
[1:17:28] that's why it's so important to lean if
[1:17:31] you have holy ghost-filled parents to
[1:17:33] lean on them
[1:17:35] because they've been through it despite
[1:17:38] of what Satan will tell you that your
[1:17:40] parents don't understand or that you
[1:17:42] don't understand what I'm going through
[1:17:44] they have they have in fact but maybe
[1:17:47] they've got some scars in their life
[1:17:48] they're trying to protect you from
[1:17:52] right so if Satan can get in the details
[1:17:54] of your life and get you to rebel and
[1:17:56] not listen to your parents
[1:17:58] then that's only setting yourself up for
[1:18:00] failure
[1:18:02] it's important to surround yourself with
[1:18:03] holy ghost film mentors with people in
[1:18:06] the church and in your community that
[1:18:08] are filled with the Holy Ghost that you
[1:18:09] can lean on for wisdom
[1:18:12] remember Satan is one of his biggest
[1:18:14] tactics is that they don't understand
[1:18:18] but greater is he
[1:18:20] that is in you if you have the Holy
[1:18:22] Ghost then he that is in the world
[1:18:26] we just have to make sure that he's in
[1:18:27] US
[1:18:28] because he does the overcoming
[1:18:31] no matter who you are and what you are
[1:18:33] you will never be able within yourself
[1:18:35] to outsmart the enemy
[1:18:37] he's slick he's been at it for six
[1:18:39] thousand years he in fact has been
[1:18:42] watching your DNA your ancestry coming
[1:18:45] all the way down
[1:18:47] he no in other words he knows you better
[1:18:50] than you know yourself
[1:18:52] you may not even know your family
[1:18:53] history past your grandparents and
[1:18:55] there's a lot you may not even know
[1:18:56] there
[1:18:57] but he knows for six thousand years he's
[1:19:00] known the weakness of your natural
[1:19:02] abilities what gets you
[1:19:04] is it temper is temper so ran in your
[1:19:07] family he knows and he'll know just went
[1:19:10] to strike
[1:19:14] Satan is very smart
[1:19:17] but he's he can never outsmart the Lord
[1:19:19] Jesus he can never win he can never
[1:19:22] outdo the Holy Ghost so no matter where
[1:19:24] you are in life and how much money you
[1:19:25] want to make and what wonderful career
[1:19:27] you're pursuing and all the plans you
[1:19:29] have for the future get the Holy Ghost
[1:19:31] first
[1:19:33] because I promise you all that success
[1:19:35] without the Holy Ghost is misery
[1:19:38] getting married without the Holy Ghost
[1:19:40] leads to misery leads to disappointment
[1:19:43] leads to pain
[1:19:46] seek ye first the kingdom of God
[1:19:50] because we all have a purpose in life
[1:19:53] God has called it doesn't matter you
[1:19:55] don't have to be a song leader you don't
[1:19:57] have to sing specialist you don't have
[1:19:59] to play instruments if you do that's
[1:20:00] God's extra blessings on you but don't
[1:20:02] feel like just because you don't can
[1:20:04] can't ever maybe you know put a finger
[1:20:07] on something that you do God has called
[1:20:09] you for a purpose in life
[1:20:12] and there's also you know he's called us
[1:20:14] all and there's an importance of
[1:20:16] stepping into that purpose
[1:20:18] God has a realm of influence for each
[1:20:21] and every one of us and it's just as
[1:20:22] important to step into that position and
[1:20:26] it's just as important to step into it
[1:20:27] as not stepping out of it
[1:20:31] I want to do everything God wants me to
[1:20:34] do
[1:20:34] but not a single bit more
[1:20:37] do you understand you want to step into
[1:20:39] what God has for you but not out and be
[1:20:42] so zealous that you're trying to do
[1:20:43] someone else's job
[1:20:46] because that's not good either
[1:20:48] you've got to stay into that because
[1:20:51] we're all given a realm a world or a
[1:20:54] realm of influence that God has given
[1:20:55] you
[1:20:57] God has given you an influence if you're
[1:20:59] assuming you go to school you're on the
[1:21:00] job and you're the only believer there
[1:21:02] God has given you an influence to shine
[1:21:05] the light right there
[1:21:07] right that all the preachers in your
[1:21:09] church can't do
[1:21:11] you go to school
[1:21:13] all the every person you know the only
[1:21:16] believer in that school you're the only
[1:21:17] one in your grade or whatever the
[1:21:19] situation everyone else in your church
[1:21:22] can I spread the influence The Godly
[1:21:24] influence that you have been given the
[1:21:26] opportunity to do as you can
[1:21:32] it may be even the influence of
[1:21:34] spreading
[1:21:36] reflecting Jesus Christ to your younger
[1:21:38] siblings
[1:21:39] your friends at church
[1:21:41] because even your friends in church need
[1:21:43] you to be a light
[1:21:45] just because you're at church don't mean
[1:21:47] to turn the light off that's the time
[1:21:48] you keep it on a Christian never turns
[1:21:51] their light off well bless God I'm at
[1:21:52] the church house so I'm gonna just turn
[1:21:54] my light off
[1:21:55] you keep that light shining because
[1:21:58] there's people there's somebody who's
[1:21:59] always watching so when they look at
[1:22:01] whenever one young person looks at
[1:22:03] another maybe they're struggling and
[1:22:05] because you're a young person sister Zoe
[1:22:07] and someone else could be struggling
[1:22:08] saying okay
[1:22:10] Satan makes me think that my parents
[1:22:12] don't understand
[1:22:13] but here's someone my age that's on fire
[1:22:16] for God
[1:22:20] you see so they know okay there's a
[1:22:23] teenager I know that they feel the same
[1:22:25] pressures as social media is it okay if
[1:22:27] I put this down
[1:22:28] they they feel the same pressures of
[1:22:31] social media they may feel the same
[1:22:33] pressures of school and Temptation and
[1:22:36] peer pressure and because you're letting
[1:22:39] your life shine you're then giving them
[1:22:41] strength
[1:22:42] in a realm of influence and as you grow
[1:22:45] in life in spiritual maturity your
[1:22:47] influence can then change God can lead
[1:22:49] you on
[1:22:51] from the influence of your school you
[1:22:52] graduate and then you begin to influence
[1:22:54] people in the workplace maybe you begin
[1:22:56] to influence people in college maybe
[1:22:58] then you get married and you can then
[1:22:59] influence husband and wife can can can
[1:23:02] give each other
[1:23:04] um
[1:23:05] can give each other strength
[1:23:07] they're going through a hard time the
[1:23:09] husband helps the wife the husband goes
[1:23:11] through a hard time the wife helps the
[1:23:12] husband
[1:23:14] and then you begin to have children and
[1:23:17] then the children are looking for
[1:23:18] reality
[1:23:20] so then it's then all of a sudden your
[1:23:21] influence has now spread to children
[1:23:23] that are going to look to you for
[1:23:26] reality and look for the right influence
[1:23:28] in your home
[1:23:31] because if if a couple is always
[1:23:34] bickering and fighting and that's just
[1:23:37] their lifestyle
[1:23:38] then their children are subjected to
[1:23:40] that then they will be in that wrong
[1:23:42] atmosphere
[1:23:46] in First Corinthians 7 24 the Bible says
[1:23:48] Brethren let every man wearing his call
[1:23:51] therein abide with God
[1:23:54] it's in this realm that God has called
[1:23:55] you
[1:23:56] that you must keep the enemy out
[1:24:00] because he will constantly you have to
[1:24:02] guard your testimony
[1:24:03] we have to keep ourselves covered by the
[1:24:06] blood constantly
[1:24:08] first John chapter 2 for all that are
[1:24:10] all that is in the world the lust of the
[1:24:12] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[1:24:14] of life is not of the father but is of
[1:24:17] the world and the world passeth away and
[1:24:20] the luster of the he that doeth the will
[1:24:22] of God abideth forever
[1:24:25] we live in a really dark town
[1:24:27] darkness that can be felt
[1:24:30] it's getting so evil
[1:24:33] there's even you know there's nowhere
[1:24:35] else to go but you don't even feel like
[1:24:37] staying here anymore
[1:24:39] what it is is God has taken out all them
[1:24:41] rabbit skins in the far right out of the
[1:24:43] nest because it's time to take a flight
[1:24:45] it's getting uncomfortable it's getting
[1:24:46] sticky we try and move over here and
[1:24:48] it's nasty and then we go over here and
[1:24:50] it's just so dark
[1:24:52] because it's time to go home
[1:24:55] people don't know which way to turn
[1:24:58] every Church age has had its own
[1:25:00] Temptations
[1:25:01] every Church age you think of the
[1:25:03] Temptation Of the Dark Ages to just you
[1:25:05] know to unimaginable tortures in just
[1:25:07] one recampment
[1:25:09] can make your flesh so comfortable
[1:25:13] that is a serious temptation
[1:25:16] that's a whole lot harder than
[1:25:18] turning your head
[1:25:20] can't be but God anointed them for that
[1:25:25] and the Holy Ghost anoints you and
[1:25:27] strengthens you to shun sin to not be
[1:25:30] able to stomach it and remember it's not
[1:25:32] a sin to be tempted it's a sin to be
[1:25:35] heed to temptation
[1:25:37] but God will always equip
[1:25:40] his elect to overcome every obstacle
[1:25:43] if this is the most evil age that's ever
[1:25:45] been then he's equipped us with the most
[1:25:47] powerful message that's ever been given
[1:25:50] the most powerful message because
[1:25:53] remember the scripture says that when
[1:25:54] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:25:56] spirit of God raises that standard
[1:25:59] against it raises that standard remember
[1:26:02] you can't do it by yourself
[1:26:04] you can't just March out and say I'm
[1:26:06] gonna overcome this devil I no
[1:26:09] it's God you have to do it
[1:26:14] but there comes a time where you have to
[1:26:17] be tired of living with the thing
[1:26:22] there's a point where brother Graham
[1:26:23] said that Legion
[1:26:26] had to fight himself
[1:26:29] to get to Jesus
[1:26:31] he had to fight past them evil spirits
[1:26:34] to get to Jesus
[1:26:36] and he delivered them
[1:26:37] he got Deliverance
[1:26:41] Philippians 4 13 I can do all things
[1:26:44] through Christ
[1:26:46] which strengtheneth me
[1:26:48] now see that's the key is that you can
[1:26:50] do all things but it's only through
[1:26:53] Christ
[1:26:54] that strengthens you
[1:26:56] and see you have to watch the enemy
[1:26:58] because he's so slick we live in an age
[1:27:01] where they you know they'll say you can
[1:27:03] do anything you can do anything be who
[1:27:05] you want
[1:27:06] be identify with whoever you want to be
[1:27:08] whatever just do it
[1:27:10] that's Satan's perversion
[1:27:13] when I was in school we were taught you
[1:27:16] know shoot for the stars be if you want
[1:27:17] to be an astronaut you just be an
[1:27:19] astronaut and you know do what you want
[1:27:20] to do but there's a little parentheses
[1:27:24] to that because through Christ you can
[1:27:28] but without Christ you'll fail
[1:27:31] and even if somebody just always
[1:27:33] remember this young people too
[1:27:35] just because you look out and you may
[1:27:38] see something oh if I can get that I
[1:27:41] know I'll be happy if I can only be like
[1:27:44] that person I know I'll be happy when
[1:27:47] you get there without God
[1:27:50] my own it'll actually be further
[1:27:53] this is not quite like I thought so
[1:27:55] actually no no it's when I get this
[1:27:58] and then you get this
[1:28:00] and then you're still not happy and when
[1:28:02] you get this then I'll be happy
[1:28:05] and then you realize that you've done
[1:28:07] spent your life away
[1:28:09] but see if you had him the entire time
[1:28:12] then it don't matter what state you're
[1:28:14] in if if you have a plan and you're
[1:28:16] planner for your future but you've got
[1:28:17] him you're happy here
[1:28:20] but you're just if the Lord tarries I'm
[1:28:21] looking to that but you're happy and
[1:28:24] then God blesses you here you're still
[1:28:26] happy
[1:28:27] maybe you want to go there and he closes
[1:28:29] that door you're like hmm
[1:28:32] still happy
[1:28:33] then he actually leads you this way
[1:28:36] you're still happy
[1:28:37] he leads you this way you're still so
[1:28:40] happy
[1:28:41] then about the time you get over here
[1:28:42] you're gonna look and say oh man I'm so
[1:28:44] glad that door was closed
[1:28:48] but you are happy from there to there to
[1:28:51] there to there you have the joy of the
[1:28:53] Lord
[1:28:54] because he's the real happiness he is
[1:28:57] Ultimate success
[1:29:00] when you receive the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:29:02] when you get the Holy Ghost then you
[1:29:04] have a ride then you begin to grow in
[1:29:07] him
[1:29:11] but when you're testifying that you're
[1:29:13] in Christ the enemy will come in and say
[1:29:15] you can't do it
[1:29:16] but that's the time to say Satan Kitty
[1:29:19] behind me because the Bible says I can
[1:29:21] do all things through him
[1:29:25] in Philippians 4 8 finally brethren
[1:29:28] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[1:29:31] things are honest whatsoever things are
[1:29:34] just whatsoever things are pure
[1:29:36] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[1:29:39] things are of good report if there be
[1:29:41] any virtue if there be any praise think
[1:29:45] on these things
[1:29:48] in other words don't think the enemy's
[1:29:50] thoughts
[1:29:53] you can live a Victorious overcoming
[1:29:56] life you can
[1:29:58] through him you can
[1:30:01] you can remain pure for a future spouse
[1:30:06] through him you can't
[1:30:09] you can shun Satan's offers
[1:30:12] now as you see through him because he'll
[1:30:15] make it look so good maybe he'll make it
[1:30:17] look so good but
[1:30:19] it'll get you out of church
[1:30:21] but it gives you everything you ever
[1:30:23] wanted
[1:30:25] it'll give you maybe if I can just get
[1:30:27] this uh he'll make you an offer and
[1:30:30] it'll look so good
[1:30:33] damn right
[1:30:36] but watch it
[1:30:38] pray about it
[1:30:40] and that goes back to having Godly
[1:30:42] mentors and Godly Parents you can go to
[1:30:44] and say brother sister pray with me
[1:30:47] about this I've got this kind of offer
[1:30:48] and I'm not really sure what to do
[1:30:50] pray with me and God will lead you
[1:30:53] you can be the only one living for God
[1:30:57] in your school in your home in your
[1:31:00] family it doesn't matter
[1:31:03] you can
[1:31:05] through Christ you can do all things in
[1:31:08] John 15 abide in me and I in you as a
[1:31:10] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:31:12] except that abide in the vine no more
[1:31:14] can ye accept that ye abide in me
[1:31:19] I am the vine ye are the branches he
[1:31:22] that abideth in me and I in him the same
[1:31:25] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[1:31:29] ye can do nothing
[1:31:32] see he's the Energizer
[1:31:35] all of that your brother and your sister
[1:31:37] sees are the actual fruit of your lives
[1:31:39] because by your fruits you are known
[1:31:41] but what's behind pushing is that life
[1:31:44] of the vine that's causing you to live a
[1:31:46] Victorious Life
[1:31:48] do you realize brother and sister what a
[1:31:50] miracle that you are to be standing and
[1:31:53] living and standing for the truth in
[1:31:55] this age
[1:31:56] in the most darkest ungodly age here you
[1:32:00] are you're holding up a standard
[1:32:03] come what may you're holding up a
[1:32:06] standard you're you're believing the
[1:32:08] truth
[1:32:10] that is you are the Fulfillment of God's
[1:32:12] word
[1:32:13] you are the standard
[1:32:15] Hey Brother Wade said there's not going
[1:32:17] to be a gap God is going to have a
[1:32:21] church without bribe without spot or
[1:32:23] wrinkle he's going to have that bride
[1:32:25] she's going to be there she's here she's
[1:32:28] all across the world
[1:32:30] and you can only imagine how that
[1:32:32] infuriates the enemy that no matter what
[1:32:34] he throws at you
[1:32:36] no matter how much it just it just
[1:32:38] disappoints you and how the
[1:32:39] disappointments of Life take you this
[1:32:41] way or that way you refuse to back upon
[1:32:43] the word
[1:32:45] but that vine is what feeds the soul
[1:32:49] in Saint John 16 33 these things I have
[1:32:52] spoken unto you but that ye in me ye
[1:32:55] might have peace in the world ye shall
[1:32:58] have tribulation but be a good cheer I
[1:33:01] have overcome the world
[1:33:04] now the world would always produce their
[1:33:06] own fruit
[1:33:08] it'll always be mixed maybe there'll be
[1:33:10] some goodness in there but it'll always
[1:33:12] be mixed and it will always bring death
[1:33:16] in Revelations 5 9 and they sung a new
[1:33:18] song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the
[1:33:20] book and to open the seals thereof for
[1:33:22] that was slain and has redeemed us to
[1:33:24] our God by thy blood out of every
[1:33:26] Kindred and tongue and people and nation
[1:33:28] and has made us unto our God Kings and
[1:33:32] Priests
[1:33:33] and we shall reign on the earth so
[1:33:36] before we can come back and Reign on the
[1:33:38] Earth
[1:33:39] you we have to Reign this Earth
[1:33:43] you've got to rule over your own Earth
[1:33:46] not someone else's Earth not your
[1:33:48] neighbor's Earth you have to rule over
[1:33:50] your Earth I have to rule over my own
[1:33:53] Earth
[1:33:55] because remember God is an expert at
[1:33:59] being outnumbered
[1:34:01] but coming out with the victory
[1:34:05] you the gene seed of God
[1:34:09] are fighting ten
[1:34:12] your senses
[1:34:14] Against One
[1:34:16] think about that you have all these
[1:34:18] senses of the spirit you have all the
[1:34:20] senses of your body that are that many
[1:34:22] times tell you things that are contrary
[1:34:24] to the word
[1:34:25] and you have to stand there Toe to Toe
[1:34:28] with the Devil
[1:34:29] and stand on the word
[1:34:32] you can't see the Promise come to pass
[1:34:34] God could speak to your heart and he
[1:34:36] tells you something is coming but you
[1:34:37] can't see it you can't reason it out you
[1:34:40] have no idea how it's going to happen
[1:34:43] you think of Abraham prime example but
[1:34:46] yet he stood there he had in his soul
[1:34:49] he believed God and his faith was
[1:34:52] counted him for righteousness and
[1:34:54] despite what not only his own ten senses
[1:34:56] he had a fight but he had to fight all
[1:34:58] the naysayers all the mockers all the
[1:35:00] people that made fun of him
[1:35:03] and yet he had to stand firm
[1:35:05] we have to stand firm in an age of more
[1:35:07] unbelief than ever
[1:35:10] Joshua was fighting enemies in the
[1:35:12] Promised Land
[1:35:14] and the land belonged to them it was
[1:35:16] promised to them
[1:35:18] God told them it's yours but they had to
[1:35:20] fight for every inch every foot
[1:35:25] foreign
[1:35:26] you think about that
[1:35:27] God gave us a promise he gives the word
[1:35:30] full of promises but you have to fight
[1:35:32] for it
[1:35:35] if if sickness has struck your body we
[1:35:38] can't just sit back and say well God
[1:35:39] promised me healing
[1:35:41] I'm just gonna wait on it to come you
[1:35:43] know maybe it will maybe it won't I
[1:35:45] don't know you've got to fight
[1:35:48] every morning when you wake up and you
[1:35:50] feel sick every every time you look in
[1:35:53] the mirror and you may still see the
[1:35:54] Affliction you have to fight past what
[1:35:56] you see you have to fight past what you
[1:35:59] feel
[1:36:03] the only way to possess it was to fight
[1:36:05] they could have never settled in the
[1:36:07] land had they not fought for it
[1:36:10] right they could have sat there right on
[1:36:11] the edge of Jordan and said that is the
[1:36:13] most beautiful land I've ever seen
[1:36:16] I bet I could grow some beautiful grapes
[1:36:18] I can just imagine my children for
[1:36:20] Generations running out there that land
[1:36:23] will always belong to us my goodness it
[1:36:25] is exactly what God Said
[1:36:29] well let's go over no
[1:36:31] no I can't my friend won't so my friend
[1:36:34] ain't gonna do it so I can't do it
[1:36:38] get out and fight
[1:36:41] and there's a military strategy not just
[1:36:44] fighting but as you're fighting you
[1:36:45] possess you keep pushing back the enemy
[1:36:48] off of your land remember it's your land
[1:36:50] the enemy is squatting
[1:36:53] it's not his land that you're taking
[1:36:54] over the land belonged to them and all
[1:36:57] them civilizations God allowed to raise
[1:36:59] up to just keep it
[1:37:01] nice and trim for them
[1:37:03] to plant a lot of the crops for them
[1:37:06] so it's not it wasn't their land it was
[1:37:09] God's land
[1:37:10] that he promised to Abraham and this was
[1:37:13] his seed coming back to take possession
[1:37:16] of what was theirs
[1:37:19] your health is not the Devils it belongs
[1:37:22] to you
[1:37:23] your sound mind does not belong your
[1:37:25] mind don't belong to the devil it
[1:37:26] belongs to you
[1:37:28] so if Satan keeps coming to you you we
[1:37:32] have to fight it out
[1:37:35] the sound mind belongs to you
[1:37:38] a Godly marriage belongs to you
[1:37:43] a Godly home Godly families Belong To
[1:37:46] You amen
[1:37:47] and they don't always look like you know
[1:37:49] there's that song way maker even when I
[1:37:51] don't see it
[1:37:53] he is still working
[1:37:56] when I don't even feel like he's working
[1:37:59] he's working
[1:38:02] just because then the children of Israel
[1:38:05] were circling circling and walls of
[1:38:07] Jericho
[1:38:08] just because on every day the wall they
[1:38:10] didn't go back to the camp and see the
[1:38:11] walls falling down
[1:38:13] did not mean God wasn't working
[1:38:16] but there finally came a day when the
[1:38:17] walls Came Crashing Down
[1:38:21] every promise in the word of ours is but
[1:38:23] we must fight to obtain it everything is
[1:38:25] a fight life is a fight
[1:38:30] in first Timothy chapter 6 verse 12
[1:38:32] fight the good fight lay hold unto on
[1:38:35] lay hold on eternal life where and to
[1:38:38] thou are also called and has professed a
[1:38:40] good profession before many witnesses
[1:38:44] in Joshua 10 24 and it came to pass
[1:38:47] when they brought out those kings
[1:38:49] because Joshua was fighting he was in he
[1:38:51] was in the promised land he was fighting
[1:38:53] and Ten Kings went and hid themselves in
[1:38:55] a cave
[1:38:56] to get away
[1:38:57] and Joshua said seal up them caves
[1:39:00] I'm gonna deal with them in the right
[1:39:01] time so when he was done killing all the
[1:39:03] enemy he comes back and he said now take
[1:39:05] the stone away and you bring them Ten
[1:39:07] Kings right out and in Joshua chapter 10
[1:39:10] verse 24 and it came to pass that when
[1:39:13] they brought out those kings and to
[1:39:14] Joshua that Joshua called for all the
[1:39:17] men of Israel and said unto the captains
[1:39:19] of the men of war that went with him now
[1:39:22] notice this Joshua was not the one that
[1:39:24] was going to do this
[1:39:25] he when he said to all the Warriors that
[1:39:28] fought with him Joshua is the type of
[1:39:30] Jesus Christ
[1:39:31] and we're all Warriors we're all Gentile
[1:39:34] Warriors we're captains we're fighting
[1:39:38] killing devils
[1:39:39] killing the influence of the enemy
[1:39:41] whenever the enemy tries to come in and
[1:39:43] and you know and and strike your home
[1:39:45] attack your loved ones you you stand Toe
[1:39:48] to Toe with that devil and you apply the
[1:39:50] token
[1:39:52] you're fighting your men and women of
[1:39:55] War
[1:39:55] that went with him and Joshua said come
[1:39:58] near
[1:39:59] put your feet upon the necks of these
[1:40:03] Kings
[1:40:05] put your foot I'm not gonna do it you do
[1:40:08] it
[1:40:09] amen the devil that's attacking your
[1:40:12] home
[1:40:12] put your foot on his neck
[1:40:18] depression put your foot on his neck
[1:40:25] whirly friends they're trying to take
[1:40:27] you away from God
[1:40:29] not literally but the spirit that's
[1:40:31] trying to do it put your feet on their
[1:40:32] neck
[1:40:34] because it's not them it's the spirit
[1:40:36] it's Satan because remember he'll try
[1:40:38] and attack you through other people and
[1:40:40] other avenues too
[1:40:43] so you put your foot on that King
[1:40:48] and they came near and put their feet
[1:40:51] upon the necks of them
[1:40:55] remember that's what David did when he
[1:40:56] killed Goliath
[1:40:58] and Joshua said unto them fear not nor
[1:41:01] be dismayed be strong and of good
[1:41:03] courage for thus saith the Lord
[1:41:07] for the and be a good courage for thus
[1:41:09] shall the Lord do to all your enemies
[1:41:11] against whom you fight
[1:41:16] we are to put our feet on their necks
[1:41:21] because remember if it's only
[1:41:23] in the mind
[1:41:25] if it's only intellectual Faith Satan
[1:41:27] will overtake you
[1:41:30] Satan is a whole lot better at the
[1:41:33] intellectual game than anyone could ever
[1:41:35] be
[1:41:36] but when it's in the heart then you're
[1:41:38] like Samson
[1:41:40] then though you'd be surrounded by a
[1:41:42] thousand devils
[1:41:45] if he did it with a Jawbone of a mule
[1:41:47] how much more can you do it with an open
[1:41:49] book
[1:41:51] but see it a lot of times because it's
[1:41:54] spiritual and you can't see it it comes
[1:41:56] back to challenge you
[1:41:59] but because you maybe take authority
[1:42:01] over the devil in your home it don't it
[1:42:03] can be a church it can be at home you
[1:42:04] say look
[1:42:05] and you declare war on the devil
[1:42:08] literally declare war
[1:42:11] you find the promise of God that he's
[1:42:13] attacked he's attacking you he's
[1:42:14] attacking your home find the promise of
[1:42:16] God that'll fix it
[1:42:19] he's attacking your mind he's attacking
[1:42:20] your body whatever you find the promise
[1:42:22] of God and you take your family
[1:42:26] you open the word
[1:42:29] and you say now Satan
[1:42:31] here's a word
[1:42:33] you read it
[1:42:36] and you declare war and say you are not
[1:42:39] welcome in our marriage
[1:42:41] you're not welcome in our home you're
[1:42:43] not welcome in my situation you're not
[1:42:45] welcome in my mind you're not welcome in
[1:42:47] my body
[1:42:49] and you then be you let that faith that
[1:42:52] God put in you that Revelation that
[1:42:53] drops you let that be the strong man
[1:42:56] that holds the door now see the
[1:42:58] challenge is brothers and sisters that
[1:43:00] after you say that you close the Bible
[1:43:03] and you may not you won't you may not
[1:43:06] most of the time see some mighty Angelic
[1:43:08] Warfare going on
[1:43:10] but something happened
[1:43:12] when Jesus went to the Fig Tree it was a
[1:43:15] fig tree something he created and he
[1:43:18] spoke and said let no fear come forth
[1:43:21] he didn't sit there and yell at it and
[1:43:23] do everything else he spoke the word
[1:43:25] he knew who he was he knew it had to
[1:43:27] come to pass and it was settled in his
[1:43:29] mind
[1:43:30] but see that is where the struggle is
[1:43:34] because we claim the promise of God
[1:43:37] upon a situation and then we go out and
[1:43:39] in two hours it looks like the whole
[1:43:41] thing blows right up
[1:43:44] You Prayed For A sound mind you prayed
[1:43:46] that God will deliver you from
[1:43:48] depression
[1:43:49] but in an hour from then
[1:43:52] you feel more depressed than you've ever
[1:43:54] felt
[1:43:57] that's the time to be a Samsung
[1:44:04] that's the time because you know Satan
[1:44:06] calls out for help
[1:44:08] he likes to you know sometimes he likes
[1:44:10] to think that he's he's the big bad
[1:44:11] devil
[1:44:14] but when the spirit of God comes in to
[1:44:16] deliver
[1:44:18] he's not so big and bad anymore when the
[1:44:20] prophet of God will begin to discern an
[1:44:22] epilepsy and different things well he
[1:44:24] could see in the spirit the streaks evil
[1:44:26] spirits calling out for reinforcements
[1:44:28] calling out for help
[1:44:31] when they came in the presence of Jesus
[1:44:35] what do they say
[1:44:37] have you come to cast us out before our
[1:44:39] time what have we to do with you thou
[1:44:41] Son of God all these different examples
[1:44:42] in the scripture they knew when they
[1:44:44] were in that presence
[1:44:46] so don't be discouraged by the by by
[1:44:49] what looks like a natural blow up from
[1:44:52] what you just claimed
[1:44:54] your back hurts and you're sitting in
[1:44:56] church and these brothers are preaching
[1:44:57] the word and they're they're preaching
[1:44:58] Faith and Healing and you take out and
[1:45:00] you receive it and you walk back and
[1:45:02] come Monday morning you can't even get
[1:45:04] out of bed
[1:45:06] that's a challenge to you
[1:45:08] and that is the moment where you say oh
[1:45:11] man I guess I didn't right there you
[1:45:13] just come right back to you
[1:45:15] but when you stand there like Samson you
[1:45:17] stand there like shamgar
[1:45:20] when darkness tries to creep into your
[1:45:23] atmosphere when darkness tries to creep
[1:45:25] into your realm that God has given you
[1:45:27] your realm of influence
[1:45:30] that you catch you discern that as a
[1:45:32] high priest of your home us fathers
[1:45:35] and you catch that Spirit trying to slip
[1:45:37] in through that book through that friend
[1:45:39] through that movie
[1:45:41] and you catch it
[1:45:45] it's our job
[1:45:47] when the enemy tries to raise his head
[1:45:49] you have to take control
[1:45:51] Leviticus 26 and he shall Chase your
[1:45:53] enemies and they shall fall Before You
[1:45:56] by the sword
[1:45:57] and five of you shall chasing hundred
[1:46:00] and a hundred of you shall put ten
[1:46:01] thousand to flight and your enemy shall
[1:46:04] fall Before You by the sword
[1:46:06] when Joshua routed the enemy whenever he
[1:46:09] stopped the sun he needed more light
[1:46:11] that was his purpose of stopping the
[1:46:13] song we're all very familiar with that
[1:46:14] story we'll understand that as sister
[1:46:16] Sharon sang that song arise and shine
[1:46:18] that light has come the light has been
[1:46:20] has been shown in every devil has been
[1:46:23] exposed
[1:46:25] we don't have to shout Sun stand still
[1:46:27] the s-o-n has stood still
[1:46:30] and his light has shined in this day and
[1:46:33] has exposed every work of the enemy
[1:46:35] every trick of the devil
[1:46:38] now what was the purpose of the of the
[1:46:40] sun standing still so Joshua could kill
[1:46:42] his enemies
[1:46:46] the scripture says that he that can
[1:46:48] can't control his spirit is like a city
[1:46:50] with no walls
[1:46:54] in Proverbs 25 28 he that hath no rule
[1:46:57] over his own Spirit there it is it's
[1:46:59] like a city that is broken down and
[1:47:00] Without Walls
[1:47:03] so in the old days you know they built
[1:47:06] walls around the city
[1:47:07] so if the city did not have walls it was
[1:47:09] easy for the enemy to come do hit and
[1:47:11] run tactics pillage and run pillage and
[1:47:13] run so if we can't control our own
[1:47:15] spirit and we're tempted to maybe flare
[1:47:17] up about this or maybe we're tempted to
[1:47:18] be discouraged or whatever attacks our
[1:47:20] human Spirit if we're not fortified by
[1:47:23] the word then Satan will come hit you
[1:47:24] and run
[1:47:26] then you'll maybe go down to the next
[1:47:27] and then you'll get hit and run again
[1:47:29] and Satan will have you in an awful fix
[1:47:34] because the enemy will gonna come and
[1:47:36] he's going to test you
[1:47:37] the word that you've received that you
[1:47:40] receive every service the word that
[1:47:41] you're receiving now you're going to go
[1:47:42] out the doors and the enemy is going to
[1:47:44] test you on it
[1:47:47] that's what he does
[1:47:50] now here's the quote I was looking for a
[1:47:51] few minutes ago
[1:47:53] talking about Legion he had to fight
[1:47:54] past the Devils brother random said and
[1:47:57] he cares do you care he cared when the
[1:47:59] neurotic called Legion cared enough
[1:48:01] under opposition to wiggle out from
[1:48:03] under those tombstones of devils to go
[1:48:06] out to meet Jesus and throw himself
[1:48:08] prostrate
[1:48:09] he had to fight past the Devils that
[1:48:12] were trying to keep him from Jesus the
[1:48:14] Devils knew Jesus was
[1:48:16] so the Devils were trying to keep Legion
[1:48:19] back from Jesus
[1:48:21] so Legion had to exercise enough faith
[1:48:24] in who Jesus was himself even though he
[1:48:27] himself couldn't deliver himself of it
[1:48:29] he knew if he could at least get to
[1:48:31] Jesus Jesus could deliver him of the
[1:48:34] Legion of devils he was fighting
[1:48:37] he says when Legion them Devils would
[1:48:40] have never come
[1:48:42] if Legion hadn't have pushed his way out
[1:48:45] there to meet him
[1:48:46] and if Satan fights you young people
[1:48:48] middle-aged people it doesn't matter
[1:48:50] what your age old people if he fights
[1:48:52] you the wrong
[1:48:54] approach is to stay at a church
[1:48:57] because Satan has attacked me or Satan
[1:48:59] has done this to me because that's what
[1:49:01] he's trying to do is he's trying to
[1:49:02] isolate you
[1:49:05] here's where you can get help
[1:49:09] the brothers preaching don't know what
[1:49:11] you're going through
[1:49:14] but yet the spirit knows
[1:49:16] so as he's preaching the the word just
[1:49:18] comes forth
[1:49:20] and it begins to discern what you're
[1:49:22] going through
[1:49:24] but Satan can sit in your ear and say
[1:49:26] somebody told them that
[1:49:29] so see how he then robs you of a
[1:49:32] blessing instead of saying Lord that man
[1:49:34] didn't know why I'm going through that
[1:49:37] he'll then say that somebody told them
[1:49:40] and that's why they're saying it
[1:49:43] see how sneaky he is
[1:49:46] because it's in the when the changes of
[1:49:48] Life brother talks about like every
[1:49:50] seven years from teenage and then you
[1:49:52] grow you know as you grow older and then
[1:49:54] you hit menopause and for the sisters
[1:49:56] and midlife and the elderly there's
[1:49:58] different seasons of life and with each
[1:50:00] season there comes weakness
[1:50:03] a certain weakness the teenagers may
[1:50:05] have a weakness that maybe those going
[1:50:07] through midlife do not or elderly or
[1:50:09] whatever season of life we're all in
[1:50:11] seasons of life
[1:50:12] so Satan will sit there and it's an in
[1:50:15] crucial seasons of life that we must
[1:50:18] stand strong
[1:50:20] that is when we should draw nearer to
[1:50:22] God
[1:50:23] because remember he promised that he
[1:50:25] would never always rest on this he
[1:50:27] promised he would never put more on you
[1:50:29] than what you could handle
[1:50:31] sometimes we go through things and like
[1:50:33] lord it's getting real close
[1:50:35] I'm getting real I I don't I don't I
[1:50:38] can't really well maybe even say this in
[1:50:41] prayer God I can't handle this no more
[1:50:46] but you see as I said when I started you
[1:50:49] have to look at things the way God sees
[1:50:51] it
[1:50:52] God's looking at you and saying you've
[1:50:53] got a whole lot left in you you've got
[1:50:56] this but yet you're looking in a natural
[1:50:58] and we get caught up and beat up in the
[1:51:00] natural because we're all natural
[1:51:03] and so we we get caught up in the
[1:51:04] natural light lord I can't take this no
[1:51:06] more I'm at my end I I don't I don't see
[1:51:09] no change coming I don't I don't see no
[1:51:11] change
[1:51:13] but he's looking at you through a
[1:51:15] different set of eyes
[1:51:18] now see
[1:51:20] Satan God has his desire for you
[1:51:24] and Satan has his desire
[1:51:28] Satan has a desire for you and your life
[1:51:34] he'd like to get that talent you have
[1:51:37] and you have you sell it to him
[1:51:40] he'd maybe like to get the looks that
[1:51:42] you have
[1:51:43] and sell it to him
[1:51:45] he liked to maybe get the money that you
[1:51:48] have
[1:51:49] and sell out to him
[1:51:53] because remember as I said we can never
[1:51:55] outsmart him now in Luke chapter 22
[1:51:58] if the brothers can pull this up
[1:52:01] and the Lord said
[1:52:03] Simon Simon behold Satan hath to desire
[1:52:07] to have you
[1:52:10] that's Satan's desire he desired to have
[1:52:12] you
[1:52:14] that he may sift to you as wheat
[1:52:18] he can take you just do what he wants to
[1:52:20] do turn your life upside down
[1:52:21] any direction
[1:52:24] that was Satan's desire for Peter and
[1:52:26] Peter had no idea
[1:52:28] Peter was living his life and even even
[1:52:30] being a disciple of the Lord Jesus but
[1:52:32] even before that fishing had his
[1:52:34] business going had his family all these
[1:52:37] things and had no idea that Satan
[1:52:40] desire to get them
[1:52:44] and remember young people
[1:52:46] it's not necessarily what it's not just
[1:52:49] what God has saved you from or delivered
[1:52:52] you from it's what he saved you from
[1:52:54] doing
[1:52:57] right you see that is very powerful
[1:53:01] even if we all made mistakes but it
[1:53:04] doesn't matter what you did
[1:53:07] that doesn't matter anymore it matters
[1:53:09] what you're doing now and where you're
[1:53:11] going that's what you need to
[1:53:13] concentrate on don't look in the back
[1:53:15] That's what Satan wants you to do he
[1:53:17] wants you to be so confused and so tore
[1:53:20] up about your mistakes
[1:53:23] that you never turn around
[1:53:26] and forget those things that are behind
[1:53:28] forget them
[1:53:29] Satan brings them back yeah that's
[1:53:32] that's just Cannon father that's just
[1:53:34] that don't matter
[1:53:36] just because he brings them back and
[1:53:38] tries to fight you with a memory does
[1:53:41] not mean that they're still attached to
[1:53:43] you
[1:53:45] it doesn't matter
[1:53:47] so we have to we have to realize that
[1:53:49] even it doesn't matter what you did God
[1:53:51] forgave you and at the moment that you
[1:53:53] turned your life around God saved you
[1:53:55] from so much heartache
[1:53:58] he saved you from Hell most importantly
[1:54:01] but even between the journey from Earth
[1:54:03] to what would have been hell God saved
[1:54:06] you from so much trouble so sometimes
[1:54:08] because the God's not going to override
[1:54:09] your free moral agent God presents you
[1:54:12] eternal life God is presenting this to
[1:54:13] you and you choose to go the other way
[1:54:17] well he's not going to lose you because
[1:54:18] you're his number one but what you're
[1:54:20] doing is you're creating more scars
[1:54:23] you're still because the Bible said all
[1:54:25] that the father is giving me shall come
[1:54:27] to me
[1:54:28] no man can pluck him out of my hand but
[1:54:30] you're creating more scars
[1:54:34] but Satan would have deserved would have
[1:54:37] desired rather
[1:54:39] to have you
[1:54:40] he desired to have me that he may sift
[1:54:42] us as we but listen to these beautiful
[1:54:44] words he said but ah have prayed for you
[1:54:49] that thy faith fell not
[1:54:53] the hardest trial of your life but he's
[1:54:56] prayed for you
[1:54:57] that your faith won't fail
[1:55:01] Peter wasn't aware of Satan's desire for
[1:55:03] him but Jesus knew it and even prayed
[1:55:06] for him ahead of time
[1:55:09] already done
[1:55:12] and young people
[1:55:14] Satan
[1:55:16] hath greatly desired to have you
[1:55:21] he loved to mistress you
[1:55:25] he loved to misuse you
[1:55:29] to pervert you
[1:55:31] and to make you a trophy of hell
[1:55:34] that's Satan's desire for you
[1:55:40] he wants to buy your soul
[1:55:43] that's his desire
[1:55:46] he loved to put a bid on your soul and
[1:55:48] that and that could be in the form of of
[1:55:50] the lust of the eyes the lust of the
[1:55:52] Flesh and the pride of life
[1:55:54] but you've already been bought and paid
[1:55:57] for
[1:55:59] you've already the I am has already
[1:56:01] prayed for you when you get home you
[1:56:03] should read John 17.
[1:56:06] he said I have prayed for either thy
[1:56:08] Faith Hill not he knows your struggles
[1:56:10] he knows your complexes he knows your
[1:56:13] fears
[1:56:15] but you've already been bought
[1:56:17] you've been bought with the precious
[1:56:19] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:56:22] and once you're sealed
[1:56:24] in the Kingdom
[1:56:27] Satan can't touch you
[1:56:30] he's defeated
[1:56:32] he can snarl
[1:56:33] he can snap he can bark
[1:56:37] but he's got nothing on you
[1:56:39] but see yet he is an expert at making
[1:56:41] him at making you think he's got
[1:56:43] something on you
[1:56:47] and if it's not under the blood
[1:56:49] he does
[1:56:51] but as soon as it's under the blood
[1:56:55] Satan loses his hold
[1:56:59] it doesn't matter what you've done
[1:57:03] it's under the blood
[1:57:07] we have we are through him
[1:57:10] more
[1:57:13] than a conqueror
[1:57:15] he is the mighty conqueror
[1:57:18] but we through him
[1:57:20] conquer the enemy
[1:57:22] you conquer your Temptations you conquer
[1:57:25] the trials of life
[1:57:29] because nothing can separate you think
[1:57:31] what a beautiful scripture that is
[1:57:34] nothing can ever separate you sister
[1:57:36] Lilia from the love of God
[1:57:39] that's enjoy that's in Jesus Christ Our
[1:57:42] Lord
[1:57:44] aren't you thankful for the blood
[1:57:46] aren't you thankful because see brother
[1:57:48] Bob the blood is like the great
[1:57:50] equalizer
[1:57:52] if I can say that and not it sounds
[1:57:54] sacrilegious it doesn't matter how what
[1:57:57] a what a scoundrel somebody was on Earth
[1:58:01] or in what a sanctimonious home they
[1:58:03] were born in one needed the blood just
[1:58:05] as much as the other
[1:58:06] you did Jesus doesn't have a very
[1:58:08] concentrated amount of blood for this
[1:58:10] person and he just needs a deluded
[1:58:12] amount for this one
[1:58:13] without him we'd all be going to hell
[1:58:18] and so the blood of Jesus is more than
[1:58:21] enough it ain't just barely enough it's
[1:58:23] more than enough
[1:58:27] so so young people it doesn't matter
[1:58:29] what plans you have for your future and
[1:58:31] what what different
[1:58:33] stages you're in life whether you're

[1:58:47] comes in use the word to defeat him
[1:58:52] if you literally have to open the word
[1:58:55] and show the devil
[1:58:57] he knows it's there but show him that
[1:59:00] you know it's there
[1:59:02] and do you declare war on the devil
[1:59:04] and you hold the faith despite of what
[1:59:08] the circumstances look like
[1:59:09] circumstances are a big enemy to us
[1:59:13] the ah what we see and how we feel and
[1:59:16] and what we think is a big enemy and a
[1:59:19] big hindrance to us but take what you
[1:59:22] know to be the truth
[1:59:23] and hold it

[2:09:27] when God didn't give us spoons and forks
[2:09:30] he did that for us to eat right but he
[2:09:33] gave us swords to fight with he gave you
[2:09:35] everything you need all all the
[2:09:38] equipment he's already given to you like
[2:09:40] our brother said we ain't got to wait
[2:09:41] for something to come it's here
[2:09:43] I mean why would he why would we wait
[2:09:46] and be equipped
[2:09:47] after the battle no you got to be
[2:09:49] equipped before the battle gets here and
[2:09:51] you got to be trained
[2:09:53] you got to be able to know what you're
[2:09:55] doing that's right you got to be able to
[2:09:56] do like David now David didn't want to
[2:09:58] wear that armor that saw had because he
[2:09:59] never proved it before it actually
[2:10:02] weighed him down yeah right because Saul
[2:10:05] was a great big guy and David was a
[2:10:06] little ready guy he probably was like
[2:10:07] you know if you put somebody in a in a
[2:10:09] suit of armor you couldn't move no he
[2:10:12] said get that stuff off me he said I
[2:10:14] don't know that he said but there's one
[2:10:15] thing I do know
[2:10:17] he said there was a bear
[2:10:19] put that in your life oh yeah there was
[2:10:22] a line put that in your life he said God
[2:10:25] help me do that and he said now listen
[2:10:27] that guy's made a challenge against the
[2:10:29] people of God
[2:10:30] all right and Satan's made a challenge
[2:10:32] to some of you
[2:10:34] you're the children of God Amen all
[2:10:36] right pick up your sling pick up those
[2:10:38] five Stones exactly and don't wait for
[2:10:41] the preacher to do it for you
[2:10:43] he didn't wait till Samuel got there
[2:10:47] he didn't wait till he didn't wait on
[2:10:49] Saul
[2:10:50] he ain't went on the army yeah he went
[2:10:54] out there by himself
[2:10:55] and he slew a man
[2:10:57] nine feet tall
[2:11:02] with a spear that was like 14 feet tall
[2:11:04] and as my brother said unsurmountable
[2:11:08] odds to me that's when I looked for God
[2:11:12] because Satan's just going to keep
[2:11:13] piling out on you but God's gonna say
[2:11:15] that's okay I can take one I don't need
[2:11:18] but one and that brother around said he
[2:11:20] said he said give me one
[2:11:22] give me one person that'll believe what
[2:11:24] I say tonight give me one person that'll
[2:11:26] believe what our brother said today
