TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i feel like when david said i was glad when they said let's go to the house of the lord so we're reading in hebrews chapter 4 uh about about rest and uh the difference between labor and rest and kind of going into that movement moving from labor to rest let's just ask ask the lord's blessing before we begin studying lord we just thank you so much for your grace to us and for your many blessings and for being able to gather around your word and we just ask your blessing upon the services today and upon this this little study that we're about to embark on we pray lord that you will just help us now in your name so in hebrews chapter 4 verses 1 to 5 it said let us therefore fear lest a promise being left left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it we which have believed to enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world excuse me for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my wrist so we're talking about rest and you know rest is when you um when you uh you know you first hear about the gospel and you and you you're you're you you kind of beg you become interested in it and you become begin to become convicted that you need to be saved that something's wrong in your life and you begin to start working things out like the bible says work out your salvation with fear and trembling and you begin to labor and you you're you're trying to you're you're trying to work out how things work and and you're laboring to enter into that place and we'll dive into that a little bit more but rest rest is where you when god reveals to you that that the work is finished and you're at a place where of course we're resting what are we resting and we're resting in his promises we're resting in the word what what god said but sometimes it what's what's hard for us to do is to is to to really understand um what is laying there in the page but when the holy ghost lifts it off the page and reveals it to you and it makes it plain to you then that's something you can rest on like like you know whether that be healing or you know if you know you labor to to be healed in your body and you're praying and you're you're you're go searching through scriptures for for for scriptures you know something to give you faith but then when god speaks to you that you're healed then you're you're rest you're at rest you're resting on that promise and it's it's something that you already got maybe it's not yet manifested in your body but you're resting in that so rest at rest is a place that god brings us to not by not by some feeling or sensation so much but because that god reveals something to you that reveals it and it's made plain to you in your heart and down on the inside of your soul even though the rest of the world may be in turmoil the rains and the sleet and the snow and all that but down on the inside you're at rest so so we've got to follow this pattern of labor and then rest it you know we looked at in genesis when god created the world he he labored for six days and then he rested after after six days he had done everything so now he just stepped back and took a look at his work and he you know marveled at you know he was satisfied and all that he had done and he rested and so you see these same patterns repeated through the scripture and i think you know you want to look for patterns because that helps us to understand uh what we're doing here and where we're going and where we are in the road map of of of life and so that's why in colossians chapter 2 it says um it says that you know these old testament patterns and things they're given for us as a type as a shadow of of the real thing which is why paul said um let no man therefore judge you and meet her and drink in respect of a holy day or the new moon or the sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body the body or the thing that that's that's you're looking at the shadow of is of christ so in the old testament you're looking at the shadow but the body is the thing being uh that's casting the shadow the body is of christ so when you get in the new testament you're looking at the thing you're looking at the real thing the substance that in the old testament you're just looking at the shadow of now brother brown said in the message shalom he said the holy ghost is our sabbath or our rest the sabbath the place where you come to it you're you're resting the bible said so come unto me all you that labor there's that word again i'm gonna keep i'm gonna keep stressing labor labor before rest coming to me all you that labor and heavy laden i'll give you sabbath to your soul not a day paul said you that keep a day i'm afraid of you see that's right see there remaineth a rest unto the people of god a sabbath keeping for we which have entered into his rest have ceased from our labor from our works as god did from his now now on the you you look at rest when you know kind of compare now before the before the before the day of pentecost peter peter was doing a lot of laboring he like he uh when when uh he made that declaration to jesus said i'm i'm never gonna be offended of you and he was he he was trying to work it up within himself but on the day of pentecost it was different it was not his own righteousness that he was trying to work it was not his own things that he was you know he said i i'm not going to deny you i'm going to do everything i can he strike he strove within himself all night long as the people asked him about uh weren't you with this man and and and and like jesus said you're going to deny you're going to not deny me three times before the grows because he you know he didn't uh he wasn't he wasn't at rest yet rest is what happened on the day of pentecost where he came forth and he was doing what he could not do before now he was coming out proclaiming by revelation by the thing that he was resting in a revelation of jesus christ he said he began to identify by the scripture what what was happening these are not drunken as ye suppose this is that this jesus hath god raised up and he now where before he was afraid to testify that he had been with jesus now he boldly proclaimed where they were before they were hiding in that in that upper hiding away from everybody now he went out on the street boldly proclaiming because his soul was at rest he said therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made that same jesus whom you have crucified both lord and christ so so brother i'm saying awakening jesus you say you're a christian i believe you are i think he's talking to somebody in the prayer line he said you believe what are you resting in some day he will raise our bodies up after they've absolutely completely perished if you don't believe that why'd you go to church see if there's no resurrection aren't we amongst men most miserable so what he's saying is we're resting we're resting in his word of promise we're resting that that's that's what we rest in not not that we feel something not that we feel good or don't feel good or or um that we're in church or not in church or anything like that but we're resting in what god said his word of promise he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live i am the resurrection in life he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and i'll raise him up the last days we're resting in that revealed promise when the holy ghost reveals to you his word that is a rest and we would see jesus she said our soul rests solemnly upon his word and faith cannot be based anywhere else all theology and man-made isms are sinking sands and faith cannot find its resting place upon the shifting sands of man's or theology other words what man's idea of the message or the bible is we're not resting on on an intellectual understanding we're resting on a spiritual revealed revelation it's got to find his solemn resting place on the immovable rock of almighty god's word there's where it anchors god said so that settles it that's forever the truth now see when you look at god's word and it says like like we were just listening to brother brown say there's a promise that that if you repent and are baptized in the name of the lord jesus you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost you can rest in that you can take that and rest in it until he gives you a spiritual revelation that has been accomplished and then you got rest you can rest that god has done something right when you when god's word is it leaps off the page and you begin to see the things fit together and identify yourself in the scripture then that's a rest now the promise the promise of rest jesus gave this promise to to those that labor so first you gotta you gotta have that that that time where you're laboring he said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest now you can you go back and you can compare that story with uh so many so many types in the old testament so many shadows of the thing to come like the story of ruth now brother ram said he told us that you you look at that story of ruth her journey that she started off under justification she said i'm going to go with you naomi i'm going to go with you and i'm i'm you know i'm forsaking all of my past life and i'm going to go on you with a journey just justification now now under sanctification she started what did he say she did laboring and what is laboring a legalist so what are you doing your your mind and your thinking is actually being transformed you start off you're going to start off as a legalist why because you think you begin to think that the things that you do are the things that save you you begin your your mind is you're looking at like your your actions and things are being transformed you're now you want to be a christian you're coming to church and you think well now now i'm you maybe maybe you might even begin to say well i'm better than other people because look i'm in church and i'm doing things i'm laboring but but you're not at rest yet ruth under sanctification laboring a legalist and then ruth resting now she was laboring there in that field going what's she doing she's going through like you do you you you come to church and you hear things preached and maybe you don't understand it so you if you're laboring now you go home and you'll go study things out and you open up your bible and you go now what what were they talking about when they preached on ezekiel 36 what does it mean that god will take that stony heart and soften it up and give you a new spirit and you go studying it out and and what what what stage am i at and you begin to labor through the scripture like the bereans like ruth there in the field picking up the little sheaves of wheat she's laboring and she's trying to uh you know i i'll take what i can get i take i take what what falls off the masters table i walk behind these preachers and i'll get i'll get if i can't get the whole bundle at once i'll get the little bit that i can but then there came to a place where she was there rest she she came to a place where she she she laid down at boaz's feet and he threw his skirt over which is a type a shadow of the holy ghost that was thrown over you claiming your life and then he said you know you you wait you rest and i'm going to take care of everything and that's for resting when god gives you a revelation that he's the one that is in control that he's the one that's living the life through you that it's not it's not you you know you you're trying to do and trying to work and trying to you know you you come to church and you pay your tithes and you you're like i'm doing it i'm do i'm paying my tithes i'm doing the things that are required of a christian but then there comes a day where it changes the changes where you're it's christ and he's really he's really living in you and he's really doing it and it's not that you're just doing it because you're trying to follow a rule book or you're trying to follow the list of things that are you think are required but it's christ living in you that's rest now now see look look at this journey as we go through the the tabernacle i'm just looking at this little cross section of the tabernacle a lot of times we we focus a lot on the holy the holy of holies but most of your christian journey is going to take place in this holy place where there's a lot of labor going on and you see in this in this uh follow the bottom right justification you start off this you you change your direction you start going in the direction of god and and you alter this you you recognize that the sacrifice has been altered and then you move into the holy place of sanctification where there's a lot of labor going on what do you mean labor well you see that you look at the priest lighting the the candlesticks he goes up and he and he and he's because the candle it gets smokey in there and then you got to go tend to it you're constantly tending to the light you're trying to trying to keep the fire burning you go to a special meeting and you get real excited and you go home and you read about the word and everything but then the fire starts dying down a little bit and things start getting smoky in there and you got to go tend to a little bit more you got to go trim the lamps you got to keep tending to things and and and then you go over to the all the table of showbread and you're trying to study things out and you go over to the altar of incense and you pray and you're you're oh god forgive me of what i did today and you're you're laboring constantly because you're trying to get dressed you're what are you laboring for because there's thing there's things that are not clear to you there's things that you don't understand you're you're you're working toward your your your your labor into a place where god can reveal to you that there's enough word packed in that god can reveal to you his plan now look what the brotherhood said in revelation chapter 5 he said the luthers believed it by faith and come into the land but the methodist taught sanctification which was the legalistic standpoint of it see you got to do something now now see see how it's it's a little bit difficult to express because there ain't nothing wrong we got to there's got to be a change in your life there will be a change in your life when you begin to come to church and you start your sisters start wearing their hair longer and they and and your dress changes and and those kind of things you start looking like well look at me what i'm doing look at what i'm doing and that's you're looking at it wrong when god reveals to you that it's not you doing it but he is life in you making the word alive and he's the one doing it that's your rest but then you won't be looking around at others saying look what i'm doing but see a real revelation will humble you a real revelation brings you down now see he said the methodist taught sanctification which which was a higher revelation than the lutherans which was the legalistic standpoint of the cease you got it you got to do something i got to quit i got to let my hair grow out said the women of course they don't do it anymore but they did do it let their hair grow out they had to quit wearing the paints in their faces they didn't wear their skirts wrong and are short like the other seat he's see it's almost like he's he's preaching vote two ways you gotta do it but look it's a legalistic standpoint of it you gotta do it but don't look at the things that you yourself are doing it's christ in you they had to do something see that's what she did the state of justification the state of sanctification legalism legalism is when we base our justification on our own law keeping like we say where i'm keeping this list in other words this this is the now we're going back to labor now labor before rest labor you're going through this place of labor where you think that you're justified that you're good that you are righteous because you are keeping a list rather than based on the finished work of christ legalism exists when people attempt to secure righteousness in god's sight by good works instead you're it's what you're looking at instead of looking at what christ did on the cross for you you're looking at what you're doing legalists believe that they can earn or merit god's approval by performing the requirements of the law so you work and you do and you're laboring like an ox laboring trying to get to that rest and then god like on the day of pentecost comes and quickens the word that you've packed in while you're laboring and now it's alive brother adam said now you've got to be perfect jesus said be there for perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect now how are you going to be when you're continually sinning when you're continually doing what's wrong he said now this will kind of put a little kink in the legalist but notice it isn't what you do it's what god has done it's not what you do it's what he done you can't be perfect you can't be in yourself but in christ you are perfected you're not trusting in your own good works or your own church you belong to but you're trusting in the shed blood of the lord jesus there you are that's what makes you perfect there's what anchors your faith and what is rest faith rest is when god reveals it to you that's what you're resting in so in hebrews chapter 4 if we keep moving on through our study paul says sing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached enter not in because of unbelief again he limiteth a certain day saying in david today after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts or if jesus had given them rest and we he would he not afterward have spoken of another day he would have blocked out a day there remained therefore rest to the people of god there's a rest for he that has entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god did from his let us labor therefore you gotta labor you gotta have that place where you're laboring to study things out there for to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief and now through the let the rest of these slides i'm gonna i got this ox because the ox is a symbol of labor and i want that just to kind of be burned into your mind because that's going to come up later as you study the scripture burn into your mind the symbol of an ox with labor an ox is laboring because when you're going through this place of labor it's like an ox plowing in the field and it's just it's it's going through a place of uh you're just moving and and and ox is it's like a beast of burden in it and it's um you know things are hard to be preached and and you just keep moving on through and i got over here hebrews chapter six verse one therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ will just go on unto perfection not laying in the foundation of repentance from dead works because dead works is when it you're just you're laboring you're doing it to satisfy the like you're the requirements of your list of the requirements of what you think righteousness really is but not having yet come to a place of rest but it dead works is different from liv a living christ in you living it out amen so let's let's think about this now now when you're born again the labor doesn't stop it just changes it changes into something else a change is now you got you got a sword in your hand and you're you've got a a a you're a trowel thank you brother a trial in the other hand and you're you're ready to go building something something's being built that's why preachers can preach the gospel they're laboring people in there and they're abused they're laboring they're they're listening to the word and they're then and then you you know maybe you hear some things preached about the seven seals that you don't understand and or maybe and you go home and you begin to study it out or maybe you're you're you're you're going through all these uh you're working through the growth of the stature of a perfect man and you maybe you come to a place where you say well i seems like i'm patient seems like i got temperance and then god will let something come along to prove that out that maybe you don't really have the patience or the temperance that you do and until finally you come to a place where it's you realize that christ is living in you and you're resting because it's christ living in you not something that you're doing but it's christ now look at what philippians says wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling you got to labor you got to work out now i think this is something that sometimes we we kind of balk at because we want somebody to do all the work for us many times but paul's saying here he's saying i'm gone i'm not with you i'm not there to do all of the studying for you you're gonna have to do something on your own work out your own salvation it's time for you to get to work like an ox to labor in the field and go to plowing now now then he couples that though with for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure now so there you got almost this paradox of of you got to every morning when you when when when it's time to come to church you maybe maybe you don't feel like it sometimes but you gotta you gotta labor when you don't feel like it you you do it but it's god doing it in you it's god working it in you because you're born again and christ is the one that puts that he he's changed your motives and he's changed you so that now you want the word but then when you don't feel like it you you know you you're you're you you don't feel like maybe praying but you go pray because there's something in you that's longing to do that and you and you're laboring that's why ii peter says wherefore the rather brethren give diligence when peter's talking about going up the statue of a perfect man give diligence to make your calling in election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall it it's almost like a paradox that it's it's automatic but you got to do something what does diligent mean diligence is careful and i got this ox up here because i want that to be burned into your mind and ox laboring careful and persistent work or effort constant in effort to accomplish something attentive and persistent and doing anything that's that's why paul peter is saying that you get these virtues laboring done or pursued with persevering attention painstaking for example a diligent search of the files or we'll say like a diligent search of the scriptures laboring so that's why jesus said and well this will be a great place to stop he said coming now let's meditate this is fantastic look you before let's say before before you start on your on your christian journey you're trying to you're going through that place of late baby form sanctification trying to get to that place of rest studying scriptures going through church going through the like painful times and and you're like an ox with that that yolk on your neck and jesus said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest and now he says take my yoke upon you so now where you before you are trying to do things on your own now take my yoke upon you he's going to you're going to yoke yourself with him and he yokes yourself because this double yoke is one where he's imagine when you get born again you you're trying to understand scripture and you're trying to understand things but now you've got christ to help you to open these things up and you know when a ox if you you ever you ever seen somebody you know they're trying to push a car out of the ditch or something maybe there might be somebody that's that's kind of joking around and pushing with their finger or whatever while everybody else does the work well when you're yoked up with christ that's really that situation he's really he's the one doing the work and you're yoked up with him but he's the one that's pulling the load you know in one place jesus actually brother brown said that that when you're yoked with christ it's like the scripture says take up thy cross and follow me but now when you're yoked up with him that cross is lined it's got it's padded so it's not as bad anymore because you're doing it with a from a place of love and the musicians can go ahead and come forward take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light what was hard before when you get the new birth and the scriptures begin to come open and become plain and what was what was hard before and what was a labor now becomes easy because you're yoked with christ you're at rest god bless you [Applause]
