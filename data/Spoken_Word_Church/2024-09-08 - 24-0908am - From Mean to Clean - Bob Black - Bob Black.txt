Realm that gives us our Victory amen hallelujah we're going to ask um I believe it's brother Ben you have a testimony this morning right okay yeah if you would like to make your way up here we'll go ahead and have you to come up here and and tell your testimony Hallelujah good morning y'all morning I came here today as a newcomer to this church it's my fourth time this year and Jesus found me I'm going to say that first and foremost Jesus found me especially over the course of the summer especially as a young person who's just now turned 20 years old I've definitely lived a life of hardship as everyone here has I'm sure but it was these experiences these past few months that well it showed me that God's love is real am through all the times that I've done stupid things as a young person with some people that I used to consider friends doing things that I know I felt disappointed God but I know that in the end I'm saved by his grace his love his Mercy In The Name of Jesus I've been saved and I recognized that in April when he when I believe it was him that put this thought in my head because before I was a Christian I was someone who used to believe that all paths lead to God and well that's not necessarily an evil thing to say but it's not that truthful thing to say so it's misleading a thousands astray he put the thought in my head of if Jesus is in every Holy scripture in the Quran in the Torah as he is in the Bible it wouldn't be too crazy to say that he is telling the truth and he is who he says he is in that Bible and after reading a little bit of the word admittedly I'm new to it myself so I can't really give any verses off the top of my head without butchering all of them and probably saying all of it wrong but I do know one thing though after the promises I made to like do right and then just breaking it just trying to like please other people that I used to consider friends he definitely did show me that the holy spirit is still there and it and it grew even larger that day cuz instead of like having this anger in my heart I just felt more upset but God told me forgive and move on don't never forget but don't hold that anger in your heart and he let me know that long after I was baptized and especially like the events I'm talking about a trip in Florida with my old car 2002 Nissan X Terror as y'all probably know that car probably won't be able to run it as good but that's besides the point um it had a lot of problems but it still was able to get me there and back home safe and I especially knew that God was looking out for me when he told me to stop by a gas station cuz my phone was almost dead and it had the map for directions the moment I parked one of the hoses to my car it broke off it caused the engine to overheat but I thank God for that happening and I'm going to tell you why it could have happened anywhere it could have happened to me on the highway in the woods where I would have had no help but it's the fact that it happened there and immediately afterward a gentleman came and helped me out and I learned a lot more about cars that day I'll say that but it was that moment that I knew that God was real I knew that moment that he was looking out for me as he does for all of us cuz some of us especially as a young person we leave we leave away from God but what I want to say especially to the younger people here and the young people anywhere that may watch this if this is recorded he is real and you may not believe it now but he is real he's watching over your life and one day you will realize that he does love you and as long as you surrender your faith into into jesus' name who can stop you who can who can hate you well the world can but Jesus never will that's right even if you hate yourself as I once hated myself Jesus said no you're meant to do something great in this world putting that faith in him surrendered everything to him I think of this quote that this one man said forgive me as I can't remember all of the words to it but it went along the lines of what do you gain from praying to God and he said I didn't gain anything but I'll tell you what I lost depression anger anxiety fear doubt all of that and I'll definitely say that's definitely been the truth in my life so it's definitely good to be with here y'all and God bless what a testimony you know the scripture says they overcame by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony always hold that testimony tell someone how your candle got lit and um I tell you we we really appreciate that brother thank you for sharing that was very faith building amen Let's uh let's sing this song uh before our brother comes out the word of God ever true it's changing me changing you and this goes along right with the the testimony it's the word that changes us I remember I heard brother BR say one time he said as you receive the word you become the word and so we accept it believe it confess it receive it and just say Lord help us help me to conform to that word and he will just have that heart plowable flesh and he'll come on the scene amen oh holy words long preserved for our walk in this world they ReSound with God's Own heart oh let the word of God impart Words of Life words of Hope give us strength and help us C in this world whever we roll the word of God will guide us home word of God ever true changeing me change in you we have come with open heart oh let the word of God and holy words of our faith hand it down to this age came to us through sacrifice oh he the faithful Words of Christ holy words long preserved for our walk in this world they ReSound with God's Own Heart oh let the let's all stand this morning there for other comes oh word of God ever true changing me is changing you we have come with Open Hearts oh let the word of God in bless oh word of God ever true change in me change in you we have come with Open Hearts oh let the word of God in amen let's just bow our heads in our hearts Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word this morning Lord Jesus and we've come from truly the the East and the West driving from different places Lord and we've come Lord not to see one another but to see you Lord I pray God that you'll open up the eyes of our hearts this morning Lord Jesus to be able to look into your word and receive something Lord Jesus that will give us strength and edification in the hour that we're living in Lord God help us Lord Jesus Lord as we come expecting Lord Jesus I'm expecting to be changed I want you to keep changing us Lord Jesus we're looking to your word Lord God so that we're not stay we don't we don't want to stay the same we want to be changed from glory to glory I pray God that you'll just bless this service and bless our hearts Lord Jesus as we look into your words and receive strength in your name amen this morning we want to look as the musicians take their seats we're going to look at Luke 7: 36 and I was uh I was trying something new this morning but it doesn't seem like it's working Josh so we'll we'll fix it some other time let me get unplugged here Luke 7: 36 and uh we'll take we'll take a the a topic um from mean to clean and I just something I you know sometimes you listen to um to to ministers we were up there in Ohio and I and and brother Josh Bennett just said something just struck my heart and I just got to studying it and studying these things out and you find some real little nuggets so Luke chap 7 verse 36 it says and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees home Pharisees house and sat down to meet you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now brother random would use a scripture like he used it in the in the message pride and he used it in in the message um the the meanest man that I ever knew and you start studying out what what mean really is you know if you look in this story you know we've got we've got a man that gave an invitation to Jesus to come and come into his uh come into his house and sit down and this man this Pharisee you know he had been schooled in all of the the letters of the law and all the understanding and he he knew uh you know the Old Testament scriptures and understood things and was schooled in the the understanding of the Pharisees of that day and he invited Jesus into his home knowing that when he got there he just put him over in the corner cor wouldn't clean him up and just laugh at him now you you talk about meanness and then you contrast that with a little prostitute who you know maybe a lot of the church people in the world would look at and say well there's nothing good can come out of her and she had the heart that she was willing to get down at Jesus's feet and wash his feet and see it's that's the story that you know maybe maybe just I want to encourage people maybe in the back you start just running quotes when you get home run quotes and see how many times brother R mentioned meanness and what that how terrible that is meanness think about think about Jesus sitting there over in the corner and that Pharisee being so mean that he wouldn't give him the give him the time of day get the the person that greeted him at the door didn't didn't pay him any mind but he just shut him over in the corner and you think about how sometimes it maybe escapes us how terrible meanness is but meanness meanness is absolutely horrible if you start studying it out what brother Randon would say about it he'd say like uh you know you go into the woods and you look watch a bear come out of the woods and a bear a lot of times you just have that nature where it's just mean and instead of it'll go rumaging through your fish and rumaging through all your your food and everything and and and and then maybe he said it'll get caught up in something like a he used the example stove pipe and and he said it doesn't have nothing to do with food but the bear just out of meanness will just go to beating on that stove pipe and just out of meanness just because it wants to it wants to beat on something now that's that's meanness another example brother R will use is that that Maniac of gdar how Jesus cast those Devils out of that Maniac of gdar and they wanted to go into the the the chief devil wanted to go into the into the pigs and he said the reason why that Chief devil wanted to do it was just out of meanness he he he wanted to well if I if I can't be mean to this man that I'm possessing I I I want to go and and be mean to these farmers and get them all riled up and stir up a lot of trouble and you see that's where meanness meanness is just it's so cruel because there's no purpose to it it's just you know and you think now going back in your life when you're sit there in school and somebody in school will say well uh where'd you get that sweater from well I got it from Walmart that's where the poor people get their sweaters from and and and all that you know it's mean and and people in school where'd you get those shoes from those are girl shoes and and there's no purpose to it but they're just saying something to be mean and you know that's young people and everything but But as time goes on it it'll grow on up until wa you got a Pharisee that's sitting there and and he's mean so mean that he can't be hospitable to Jesus Christ now brother Brandon when y when he tells these stories he'd always start off the story with that Courier now the Bible don't really go into about The Courier that much but it he he'd say he'd go on T it's it must have been about Sundown when The Courier arrived and he he was searching all over from capernium to Nazareth and finally he met the one that he was searching for Jesus of Nazareth and he say that Courier now you think about if you're in the position of that Courier looking he he was in the service of this mean fell of course he'd got maybe caught up in the in the atmosphere of that home and the atmosphere of his employer and maybe he he because of those things he just didn't recognize the one that he's he's coming to deliver a message to and he come you know and brother Brown would frame it up that philli was outside of you know keeping watch and so the Courier meets philli and Philip brings him on into Peter and Peter takes him on into the presence of Jesus and Jesus he he you know brother R dramatizes it Jesus was tired and he'd been preaching all day and his voice was husky husky with the soreness and the dust of the day and here comes this Courier approaching Jesus in in this kind of a frame in this kind of a scenario Jesus Jesus is tired Jesus is weary his voice is Husky and and he said he's looking out upon them and seeing how that they were hungering and thirsting would explain to them how God brought about all of this this great works and and brother Brandon would to frame it up like this perhaps maybe he' just got through with a sermon of Jesus Jesus Jesus's first Doctrine you must be born again now now we're on kind of the topic of of of meanness and cleanness a a and and you begin to well let's meditate this morning let's just think about these things why is it so important to be born again why is it so important I think sometimes it escapes us you know when we're talking to our young people and or maybe your children and you and and it I feel like it sometimes escapes you know we just don't we kind of devalue being born well you can go ahead and get married before you're born again everything will just work it work itself out and now it might eventually maybe years down the load 20 30 years down the load road you you you'll finally come to the Lord and get and get born again get saved but but I tell you what it matters to be born again and why why does it matter so much we we know what being born again does it's it's the life of God in you and he gives you of his faith so that you can really believe and the world begins to open up to you and you your eyes become open so you can see things more plainly than because that you that before they were cloudy but but what is being born again doing it's it's changing your nature amen you might ask the question well how do I get born again this morning well you know uh we're we're we're expecting our first little grandbaby and we're you know we're thinking about a baby being born and and you know it in the natural it works very similar to the way it does in the spiritual you start believing and and you don't you don't get the baby right then when you believe have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed you believe and it starts a process and before long you got the twitching muscles and the mama can feel some something's growing but and and there's a life in there but it ain't it ain't the life that you want yet it's not that life and and before long after nine months then all of a sudden the baby comes out after labor labor pains just like in the spiritual how can you have a a birth in the spiritual without a lot of Labor and and all of that pressure and Desperation and all those things trying to trying to work things out and then the life comes into the baby now in the natural it's a life the life that's that's wrong we're born wrong we're born with all this meanness and hatred and Malice and and we can't even get along with the kids at school hardly we can't get along with our brother and sister and then of course mama and M and daddies wonder why your kids are acting up sometimes it's because we need the we need the Holy Ghost we need to be born again and we need to be born again so that we can put up with ourselves and so we can put up with one another and so we can communicate with God right so we need we need oh we need the life of God that God would come and Tabernacle Le himself in us and change us and bake all the meanness out bake all that stuff out of us that ain't supposed to be there and change our nature I'm talking this morning about not just knowing a lot of things but being different amen acting different now now isn't it some strange that we'll we'll preach a lot of time we'll preach now when you get born again they can see you coming and going your life has changed you'll be a living billboard and all those kind of things and then on the other side we'll go away and we'll say well I can't really tell people can't you can't really know you can't really tell it's just a secret it's just now come on now if you're if there's a change it's going to be apparent and you on the one side well oh the seals are written on the back side on the inside the backside and and everybody will know but on the other side well you just you just can't really know now I I I believe that God has given us the ability to know and and and not just it's going to be apparent come on now it's going to be apparent to the people that you work with the people are going to that you work with will see that there's something different now I I went through it myself when when I was born again I know that there's a change uh we went through it watching our children be born again we know there's a change when you come staggering in from driving home from work and you're staggering around around like a drunk man praising God in the living room and and telling a testimony about how how that something happened on the way home and then your life begins to change there's something something changed and and oh nobody's going to convince you otherwise nobody's going to say something different something changed and that's what I'm talking about it's not where well bless God I now I've got a right to be mean and hateful and no more than you and and all this kind of thing but no your your nature is changed and that's what I'm talking about this morning you got to be born again you you've got to be born again now young people you you need to be born again before you get married and and we're going to lay this out what brother Bram said about the little German boy and things you need to be born again because why what happens if you're not born again if you're not born again you get married to somebody and and you're just your whole your whole the whole stage is said for a bunch of yelling and screaming and and sleeping on the couch and and arguing about what kind of music you listen to and how you should dress and arguing about this and that and there won't be any peace and you won't be able to come come to the right conclusion about how to raise your children or or or or whether or not to go to school or whether or not to stay at home and and and bake breakfast for your husband and you won't be able to agree on anything first of all cuz you can't even read the Bible right and you're going to be looking it through it with a looking at the Bible with your eyes uh closed over and you won't be able to look at things right so you everything CH everything changes when you're born again the Bible changes your life changes the way that you look at things changes when you're born again now maybe maybe sitting here if you're not born again you might not be able to really place the value on it because and and oh but if oh if you just do like that little do that little prostitute woman and just humble yourself at the feet of Jesus and say I I'm willing to do whatever if it I'm willing to humiliate myself I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get to you amen now that's the birth process that's the birth mama mama wakes up in the middle of the night and she's got to go I I got to get now I'm I'm going to preach on my daughter a little bit she she she she worried us a little bit she'll say she'll wake up wake up in the middle of the night and she got to go get a LongHorn steak like okay but you see there's things there's Cravings within you that you you something there's a a desperation within you that you got to have it satisfied and there's something working within you to be birthed and you're believing you're beling but you see it's a gift of God you don't get it because because you did something or because you prayed enough or something but all you can do is believe and along and along the baby will be born so so if the baby ain't born the second you believe right now you just keep believing and you just believe with a steadfast assurance and just keep walking ahead hang on to that promise of God and by and by God will do something now see it takes a while for a baby to be born God will walk you through justification and sanctification he'll clean you out and you start studying the word and doing the things that a Christian is going to do and then and then he gives you his life and and and you couldn't better believe that his life is going to change you his life is going to change you and everybody will be able to see it everybody will be able to see it say it again everybody will be able to see it and brother Brown would say he might have went back to Genesis and began and said in the beginning God said let there be in the beginning and there was framing it up that God spoke and it caused something to happen and he said let everything that I have spoken for bringing forth of its kind and it did then he might have brought something like this saying well now and it brings forth and he's laying out how that you plant a seed and it's going to bring forth of its kind in other words you you preach the word of God and it's going to produce a change in your life it's there's going to be something different it's going to change you and he said but yet you can take these seed and you can mix them together and you can get what's called a hybrid product beautiful very nice but it isn't the original you let it go it'll go back to its kind again now he's talking about an original life now we sing that song the original Life The Original Seed and and that's what we want we don't want something hybridized by denominations or hybridized even by our own thinking but we want to go back to the original life and you see it all comes down to the life the life will manifest the characteristics of that life and and God is ident identified by his characteristics how how you it's identified you look at a mule you look at a mule and it's it's identified by the life that it has now you could put a costume on it and a parade or something but you can still identify it but that's well that's a mule because it's stubborn it's is hateful it you know get into a situation and it start that it just doesn't know how to handle it and it gets all aggressive you know it starts kicking and popping people upside the head with it with his Hooves but it it to take it back to the original life is going to act different the original life now it might have come from a a thoroughbred horse and a donkey but if you could take that life of the thoroughbred horse and put it in that mule then you got a thoroughbred horse again and by and by its ears are going to start changing and it's fur is going you know it's hair on its body it's going to start changing and and it its eyes are going to start changing because the life is what controls how it acts it controls its characteristics the life on the inside of that thing brother B said he might have said you see really your lives are hybrid that's that first birth your Li you come here with with all that stuff wrong that we need to have corrected he said father said don't touch the tree but Satan said it won't hurt you so therefore your life now is in a hybrid condition and that life cannot go back to itself breathe back now we've tried we tried for 7,000 years had we people scientists are trying to to to change the DNA and fix the tel miror so that you don't age anymore so you can live forever and all these kind of we we've tried to to to get to get things fixed but there ain't no fixing it outside of the Holy Ghost that's why you got to get the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost takes you back to the original so that your inside is different and it starts working from the inside out starts changing you so that so that by and by our bodies will be changed it's changing us from the inside changing our spirit to align with our with our soul changing us over time until our whole being is changed now now look what brother R was talking about a hybrid we're talking about fake we're talking about meanness versus cleanness a hybrid he said can never stand the roughness and the treatment that the original can stand a hybrid just can't stand it when people you know at school or or work start making fun of you for living a real clean life they they make fun of you for for for dressing different and and not drinking alcohol and make fun of you for not cussing what you don't don't you don't cuss you don't smoke or drink you and but a hybrid a hybrid can't stand that but by and by they just can't put up with it they'll just go right back out but he said an old Longhorn would starve one of your heers to death out on the Prairie in the winter time she can make her own way like a deer now that's the real the or original can just just in the roughness and the toughness can just make its own way I I'm I ain't giving up original is like I ain't I ain't giving up I ain't backing down I'm I'm here for the Long Haul if I have to go scrimp for some food and and and grab through all the sand and all the brush and all the briers and all the Thorns I I I'm I'm keeping on because there's an original life in there that'll keep you moving but your hybrid Herford your hybrid Brahma Angus he' die out there he said you you have to Baby him so he saying hybrids have to be baby they got to have constant care and attention got to constantly be catered to constantly giving them exactly what they want and what they need constantly well oh I I'll give you if you want to do this I'll give it to you just just don't leave please don't if you want if you want this I'll give it to you just don't just stay just stay with the word just stay but but a real a real genuine you don't have to do all that to H Birds got to be baby they they they you know they got to give a be given some kind of a a thing in church that they might not be really be suited for but just to keep them involved that's the the like brother Dale used to say give somebody a hamburger or a hot dog or something just to kind of keep them around but but you don't have to do that to a real genuine cuz what they want they they just want to worship God they want the word of God they're there for for for uh because they're being CH changed and brother R would say they have to be soft soap to encourage them to hang around to hang around and soft soaping is trying to Coke someone through flatteries or gentle words rather than presenting the hard truth of a matter that's right that's all the ministers have is the truth that's the merchandise we're selling is the truth and we don't soft soap things just to kind of keep people keep the church full and and and keep things keep things uh keep the building going but the truth of the matter you know is that just not many are willing to be a doormat if necessary in Psalm 84 uh David said I'd rather be a door Keeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness you know there's seasons in life where you have to just you just got to you got to take what God gives you in that moment and that season that you're going through a and that's what a real a real Longhorn will do is just willing I'm I'm keeping on I'm not giving up I'm willing to take whatever but instead of that hybrid Viewpoint if the me Methodist don't treat me right then I'm going to go to the Baptist now the balance is though that we should treat it each other right now now there's the balance a lot of times we get so caught up in well we just got to endure that we we we don't realize that we should be treating each other right we should be we should be speaking in kindness and dealing with one another in love because it shouldn't be that Christians like Paul told the Corinthians are biting and devouring and scratching each other's eyes and faces and clawing each other out and and and just calling each other liar and calling each other is but we should be living in love and harmony and unity Amen brother Brown will say hybrid Behavior has to be constantly defended excuse is constantly made for the behavior I can I can do that because society says it's all right I could I could treat how others however I want because God will forgive me anyway you realize what a terrible statement that would be and what are we talking about this morning we're talking about meanness I can do whatever I want cuz God's going to forgive me in the end and you got to forgive me cuz you're a Christian so I can just do whatever to you any way I want but and you got to forgive me cuz you're a Christian God has blessed me with special gifts and talents so I deserve more recognition than others or my anger is righteous anger just like Jesus showed in the temple people just can't handle my passion that's what we try to oh you know that's that's a real evil when you'll take an use something that Jesus did as an excuse to be mean to be mean and horrible and hateful but you know I don't want somebody to have to make excuses for my behavior like somebody on a playground that comes home and they they they run to the teacher and and they they're title telling on well they they were on the playground and they punched somebody in the nose and then the parents say well the reason they did that and they lay out all these kind of excuses oh I don't want have to some somebody to have to beg me to be different or beg me to be changed brother R say you don't have to beg a real Christian around because he is a genuine plan of God he's got something in him that Wars something in him oh there's a fire down on the inside that Wars and he ain't going to give up so you don't have to beg a Christian to pray you don't have to keep begging a Christian to ask for forgiveness you don't have to beg a Christian to love am you don't have to beg a Christian to help others you don't have to beg a Christian to give up to God and just yield themselves now we're talking about being born again now and and it's that's different from learning I think you know sometimes people look at the problems that maybe their family has or their children has and they're like well if I can just get my kids to this seminar or get them to this program over here that they can learn how to be different but but that's not what it is is it it's not you How you going to learn not to be mean how you going to learn to love you can't learn those things it's something in eight that happens from the inside I I I I have that's a big problem I have sometimes with people it seems like we're trying to get real educated educate ourself into changing but CH being changed comes from a real Born Again experience where the life of God has birthed into you and that's what changes you genuine Christians are going to have strength and resilience and the life is what makes a genuine believer in the Old Testament they had offer up the lamb or whatever and the the life of that animal could not come back back on the believer so their sins were taken care of in that moment but going forward they go right back out and do the same thing all over again in other words there wasn't a change there was no change but now since Christ died on the cross his blood dripped down the life was released and the life was released to come back on the believer on the day of Pentecost to change the church to begin changing us cuz the life is in the blood you take a donkey and breed it brother Brown would say to the horse and the mayor and it will produce a mule the mother mule and father mule cannot have a baby mule you have to keep hybrid so you know you you you take a mu and you wrap it up in sheep skin and a mule just can't do what a sheep can do a mule cannot be a horse or donkey or sheep no matter how much it tries because the life is different you look at the life of a mule and you're going to find out it's ignorant and hard-headed it it it doesn't know anything about hardly where it's at and all of a sudden d danger comes on it and it's just going to start reacting aggressively it it you can't teach a mu nothing it's resistant to learning you can't teach it you can you can take it to all these seminars but it just won't learn it it it because there's something in it life is different and its whole nature is unyielding a mule is not going to form positive relationships a mule is not going to form a relationship with with some a good happy relationship ship it there's just something in its life and brother brand would say a mule is the dumbest thing that I know of maybe if you look at a mule Square on in the face and it'd be all crosseyed and everything and and and and he said no matter whatever you do you can't teach him anything you just can't teach a mule something now what what are we talking about that you've got to have the new birth so that you can be taught because when you're Life Changes then then now you're teachable now things are different see you can't teach a mule nothing but now what what if you could take a mule and return it back to the original take a mule and change it back so that it's like the original back to the original God promised the spiritual Eve as same as he did the natural Eve that again the word would be restored to her that's what we've been preaching on the I will restore sayith the Lord that the original teachings will be restored back and he said if you always want to know what's truth go back to the beginning go back to the original you know you go uh to to to an art shop or something and and they'll have a lot of copies you can go to Costco and you can get you a copy of of an artwork and it' probably be worth maybe a couple hundred bucks or whatever that you could spend on but if you if you want to go back and get an original Picasso or an original Dy that there it'd be countless thousands of dollarss because it's beyond price you go back to the original and something's different we want to get back to the gospel again he say brother Rand will say that the reason people want to want to go back to like Renfro Valley and things is because there's something in us that's craving to return back to the original return back to like like we used to say that I want to be old school I want to be the old time and old school symbolizes that like that old way of thinking where you stood for something you you represented something right I I I I want to go back to the the right the old school way of doing things back to the original life the original Faith the original love the original Power and you know in this modern time it seems like some of Twisted Old School in have mean is something different because we've seen so much different old school doesn't mean mean and crabby and hateful will there be old school cuz they're mean and crabby and no old school means to go back to the original the original life the original where your nature is right now this morning I'm glad that God can change our nature that's what that message the Paradox is about so many others that I'm glad that God can take our nature and change it and make us different that we don't have to stay a stubborn old mu and we don't have to stay a contous old Billy Goat it's willing to butt heads with anything that comes by we don't have to stay an old vulture right we don't have to stay some some old crabby animal that all it wants to do is just throw out insults well I don't like that sweat where'd you get that sweater you know somebody was telling me at school that that their kids got so bad at school that they would go and and just grab your shirt and flip it open and look at the tag on the inside to see where you got your clothes from because if you got it from the wrong place if you didn't buy it from a place where your shirt was $150 and they were going to make fun of you now that see that's mean that's mean that's what we're talking about and meanness brother brandham said comes from the Devil yeah when you're when you're poking fun at somebody and just and and and you're you're you want to make them feel bad to think why would you want to make somebody feel bad now now look at all these animal animals brother Brown compared he's a lamb and a goat a lamb's real Meek and it's real innocent and it just constantly sacrificing itself why because it's life the life of that lamb but but now goats going to be real f it's just full of lies and deception and a goat will lead you to the slaughter acting like it's the real thing and all the Sheep following along well he's taking us where we're supposed to go and a goat is deceiving lying you look at a goat with those little slit eyes and it's like there's so that's why the The Satanist use that as an example of of of the devil because it's it that's what it represents something wrong it represents selfishness and a lack of sensitivity a lack of sensitivity now aren't you glad that when you get in to a real Holy Ghost fill meeting that you can feel the presence of the Lord but but now a goat a goat just can't don't know what's going on Harley it's just it's not sensitive to nothing it don't care about anybody else all it cares about is itself brother Brown would say it takes a real Sheep Man to know the difference between the bleet of a wolf and a bleet of a lamb and a goat they both bleed alike you you just about can't tell them apart but there's there's still a difference in nature still a difference in the life look at a dove and a crow the dove is real gentle and it's it's just committed it's committed to its partner it's it symbolizes Purity and peace and the Holy Ghost and it cannot stomach anything unclean now that's that's what a real Holy Ghost filled believer is like and brother that's that's what the Holy Ghost is like brother R said if you want the holy ghost in your life be like a real gentle lamb so that you can be a little lamb l led by the led by that little Dove and on the other hand though you got a crow that's just a symbol of hypocrisy and that dual nature you know we we don't want no dual Natures where you're living different at home than you are at church and you come to church and your wife or your kids are like you don't know the real them what what if I could yank my glasses off I you don't know the real them what does that mean we we want to be living the same way at home that we are at church the same way at work no no duel nature where we're when we're at home when when we're our family then we can really throw our arms back and let loose that temper and let that vein pop out but at church at church we're really we're just real Pious everybody we're only here a couple hours so we can we can fake it for that long and see that's what we're talking about a mule with a sheep skin on it a goat with a sheep skin a crow sticking a peacock feather in and you could fake it you can you can see somebody else living a real Holy Ghost filled Christian Life and and see some virtue and you going to take that peacock feather that symbolizes virtue and just jam it in real quick just for long and it it'll come out looking like it's right on the outside but we're talking about down on the inside are you changed and if you're changed it'll take the meanness away it'll take that take that away where you just want to be cruel to somebody right an eagle and a vulture an eag Eagles got that strength and the vision the ability to rise to Great Heights a symbol of God's great heritage of power and a vulture that it it don't mind eating anything dead and and it sure can't it it sure can't get up to the heights of true Revelation amen a vulture can fake it for so long but you start talking about the seals and the Thunders and the and and the Deep things it just it is only so high it can go it just can't get up it it can might get up as far as you can go by intellectual understanding but to really truly understand it can't climb that high a and an eagle is going to eat live meat it's got to eat live meat because it needs some blood in it it needs some life it it wants something that's going to because we're talking about life and an eagle an eagle wants life it wants something that's going to help it to sustain look at that pig that nature that returns to dirt and uncleanliness or somebody that just keeps going back to sin despite claiming to be something else a pig you know my uh my brother-in-law used to raise pigs and that was the nastiest thing you you to wash wash wash them out real good clean up their pen and come back the next day and it just be just as filthy again and and that's how a pig it's C the nature of that pig it'll just keep going right back to where it came maybe come to church and get in a good Revival and then right back it goes and right back it goes right back it goes maybe maybe if you're comparing it to uh somebody in church maybe in secret maybe nobody knows that you're going right back to where you come from on the Internet or something but it's that nature you got to get your nature changed it's a nature change that you can't fake fake cuz you can't you can't fake real virtue and real Temperance and real godliness and real brotherly kindness brother R say it would be like a crow trying to put a pigeon feathers in or a peacock and saying you see I'm a beautiful bird see it's something manufactured but a peacock don't have to worry whether he's going to have peacock feathers or not a dove don't have to worry whether he's going to have Dove feathers or not as long as his nature is a dove he will have Dove feathers now see that that means that it's not works I'm not saying these things like you you got well you better go home and get those feathers straightened out no we go home and get the life straightened out we go home and get back into the word and get get that part straightened out because if you get the inside right then the outside will take care of itself and what is what is the outside inside you do for God your faith outside you're living for others and therefore you can take all of the law and all the prophets in the all the Old Testament and just steal it all up and to just do for your brother like you would like them to do to you brother Brown said or Jesus said therefore all things whatsoever you would that men should do to you do you even so to them for this is the law and the prophets now that's what that's what that Pharisee got wrong he's sitting over there with that with Jesus over in the corner and and he ain't treating him like he would want to be treated he's not showing him Hospitality he's not he's not giving him the very best he's not robing him putting on those nice soft sandals and and oing him and anointing him up but he's shoving him over in the corner and being mean right being mean comes from the devil you know that scripture I just read whatsoever you would do that men you would that men should do to you that means that we should treat others the way we want to be treated with empathy and kindness and fairness by putting ourselves in the shoes of other people guiding us to act with love and respect not with mean you know all these animals we just looked at all these animals that that brother Brandon would teach us that in the church you're going to have scarecrows and that's what all these animals are you you come to church and you'll see what looks like a mule and it throws people off well we're not going to church anymore we're going to just stay home and listen to tapes all because there was a mule in church somebody that just hadn't had a life change well I'm going to stay home because I saw a vulture I I'm not going to get around the people at church anymore because I saw a goat that somebody just you know they they buted me over in the parking lot and they just run ran and trumped all over me so I'm just going to stay away but all of these copycats are put there it's almost like they're tools of the devil to act as scarecrows to see if you what you going to do are you a real genuine that are you really going to power through and and and do like a real Longhorn a real thorough bread and just keep powering through no matter what comes your way and brother Ram said don't let the Scarecrow bother you that's right if there's a scarecrow that only means there's something good behind it and you can believe that there's a lot of scarecrows around the message there's a lot of strange things strange doctrines strange people we'll go ahead and say it strange all kinds of strange and it'll keep you away if you're not willing to just power through Power past it cuz I guarantee you there's some good stuff behind the scarecrows there's some good stuff in that field if you can just look past all the fakeness there's some good stuff in the field and he said I'll admit it it's being tramped on made fun of misinterpreted misrepresented and everything else like that that's only the devil counterfeiting but there is a real genuine baptism of the holy spirit that brings the same results that they had on the day of Pentecost God can change our nature there's a lot of mean a lot of crabby a lot of backbiting a lot of all that kind of stuff but God can still change your nature if you just look past all of that to Gentle and meek and kind and loving now there's a lesson there too other people ain't my example on how to live and they can't be yours either you live according to what the word of God says the word of God is my metric for what I want to live up to not other people and the word of God says that God is going to restore all these nine spiritual fruits and nine spiritual gifts and part of that is gentleness meekness longsuffering love and those are the things that you can't fake you can't fake love you can't fake love you you know look down through history and see people they will sever relationships just because somebody said a harsh word toward them when Jesus said father forgive them they're on the cross they were crucified and see you you can't you can't manufacture it you can try to fake it all day long but there's no faking that kind of love amen God is going to change our nature in Matthew 7 7:16 he said ye shall know them by their fruits did men gather Grapes of thorns or figs of thistles in other words you're going to know people by their life amen by the way that they treat others by the way that they respond to God by by the way that they react to the word you're known by that you're known that so much till you know if they lower you down in the grave at the end of your days you're going to be remembered people remember you by the way that you treated them by the way that you spoke it's sad to say but they'll remember you by the way that they they made you feel when you were around them were you mean or were you clean were you mean and brother brand was say like this your life speaks so loud that I can't hear your testimony we might you know I might preach a long really nice sermon but if I go out in the parking lot and I just treat everybody like dirt then what does that say about my life it's my life your life is your testimony what we are how we walk no matter what we say our life speaks louder than our words do you know that's what the seals are about tell me brother Bob what the seals are well they you got a genuine and a fake and brother R said that's just how the how the how the devil wants to do he wants to see God do something and then he wants to copy it here comes a dove and he's going to copy it with a crow here comes a lion and he's going to copy it with a white horse rider and because all he knows how to do is fake he wants to watch and see the genuine and then just come along behind it and just fake and try to copy it but if you got a real something real genuine people what is the Thunders what is the the Thunders it's a real genuine life of God reflecting the word that you've eaten brother an would say how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out and sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil now that's real Thunder is a life live by the word we need a life change you know brother Ram told that story in the in the message the Paradox about that little that stubborn little German boy that we use as an example for why you need to be born again before you get married before you start off on life and he talked about that little stubborn German boy was was uh he'd go to church he'd sit there in church but there was something wrong with his nature and it come from the way he was born his his all of his family was like that they were they had that strain in all of the family where they just could not ask ask for forgiveness now now brother brandham is making this case that it's something really that needs to be dealt with and and see what I'm trying to I'm trying to uh to to stress a sense of urgency to let's not just deal with things if if you can't ask for forgiveness if oh to think about what a what a terrible situation it would be for a couple to live for 20 30 years and neither one of them could ever ask for forgiveness neither one of them could ever seek reconciliation you're raising up kids and you can never get down by their their bedside and say I'm sorry I shouldn't have talked to you like that I shouldn't have talked to your mama like that and brother Bram said the reason it was was because there was a strain in the family there was a genetic strain that the the all of that family was like that and you know sometimes you get around at Family reunions and things and you're like well okay now I know why my nose is like this or my ears are like this now I understand well well they this wasn't something visible this was something in their nature right and see we're talking about changing your nature now your whole family might might have a certain strain and have a certain makeup where they're just unwilling to do certain maybe maybe like this case unforgiving unwilling to apologize stubborn it ain't my fault I'm not admitting wrong it ain't my fault it's anybody's fault but mine and you'll just cow cow toow down and and but see brother brandom said there was some somebody in that family that was different the mama had got a hold of God or God had got a hold of her and and had changed her nature and and he said you're the only one of all your sisters and brothers and you are sweet kind and forgiving you out of all your brothers and sisters are sweet kind and forgiving what does that and your true part of that family tree yet you have received the Holy Ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet is the Holy Ghost oh the Holy Ghost can change your nature and he said it's not your people anymore it's your Christ that lives in you now that's why sometimes you know we preach so hard against horoscopes and things because you know if you're born again from that first that first birth the horoscope might do you some good you can figure out what time of year you're born and what your Nature's like you know I'm going to do I'm going to be a real hard worker on this day I need to all this kind of stuff but but when your Nature's changed there might still be some leftover as far as you like fishing and and maybe you're real studious and those kind of things but but your nature is going to be changed from mean to clean and you're not out to be cruel to somebody anymore but now you're out to help am it's a nature change you would think in that sermon the meanest man I ever knew that brother R would mentioned that that uh Bert KY but he never mentions him he mentions them in the sermon why and in that sermon why he also said that was the meanest man that I ever knew remember that Burke Kyle that he went out hunting with and he said there was a man up in New Hampshire by the name of Berke Kyle and one of the finest Hunters I ever met but he was the meanest man I ever met oh he was cruel in heart he was cruel he said you know how people get just want to make you feel bad do something you know cruelty is one of the inherent aspects of sin because cruelty is a deliberate infliction of pain suffering or distress it's a deliberate inflection let me see that tag on your shirt and then I'm going to make fun of you cuz you don't have enough money in the bank to buy the right kind of shirt let me see those shoes you got on and I'm going to make fun of them because you didn't buy them from the place that I think you should buy them from and here's Burke call who will try to make brother brandham feel bad by shooting a little deer now cruelty is inflicting mental anguish through verbal abuse or humiliation in other words you know the words that we say can have such a profound effect on people's lives well you just want to be popular you're you're a liar you're a failure you wish you had Temperance you're the Problem Child you know you think about the these words that they cause scars over time the words that people say and and listen now y'all y'all don't draw up on me I'm I I I I feel like this I I I don't I I'm trying to work out what what what's happening here you're you're you're looking at the floor and falling asleep but surely you can recognize that these things are are helpful because God's God's got he's going to change us he's going to change us or we'll perish he's going to change us or we'll be left here and you see that we we getting we're get in that mindset just like that scene that's playing out if we don't have that mindset of that little prostitute woman will'll never be able to get something from God because a mean hateful attitude will never be able to come to the Fountain and get anything that's what that Pharisee had that Pharisee had that old well I I was I was reading through the the message why and brother brand it seemed like he was in such despair he said I go overseas and people receive it but you come to America am and about all you're going to get in America is money to take overseas to preach it it's just like people in America they don't want it he said I can be in a prayer line and I can be talking to somebody about their their disease and revealed to them all their backstory and then I can just feel from every corner of the building well he said even from Christians well I guess that's right I guess that's right it's because is there's something something wrong spiritually wrong with this nation and we've got to fight against that don't let the thing that's spiritually wrong with this nation creep into the church and into your home life until you get all cold there's a promise in eel 36 that God will take that old C Stony heart and soften it up soften it up so it's pliable and so it's sensitive to the moving of the Holy Ghost In other words God will take a cold Stony heart and change it change it so he can talk to it amen I I want to be changed that's what I'm expecting when I come to chur church is I want God if there's anything wrong with me and at the end of this sermon brother brandom starts laying out all the things wrong with him I should have I wish that I had more power in my life I wish I had a more Pentecostal experience I wish this and that there's always something else that we can do for more for God there's something else that we can do that's lacking in us and I tell you one thing I think that's lacking in US is how we don't guard our words maybe we value too much how plain we are but you know being real plain it will will cause lasting scars you know people come up to you and say well you're you're the bad twin and you're the good twin people have come up which one is the good twin and and you know you think about things will not have an effect on people's life but the words that you say have a profound effect I can say something good to my wife uh the other day I I I made a mistake I was trying to just kind of joke around about the baby and I said boy y'all better get to praying they're going to be teenagers before long and I cuz why you you say something negative and it affects people's thinking and the the words that you say matter and if you'll if you'll surround yourself with a positive confession if the doctor says something something wrong just say something positive back these words and James told us that behold also is the ships that your tongue is like like the Helm of a ship that your tongue can actually guide your life and he said even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a little matter how great a matter a little fire kindleth in other words your tongue we use the Expression sometimes oh you're going to throw Another Log on the Fire and that's how we throw a Log on the Fire is that there a situation arise and we'll that underneath your tongue is the fire of hell and we'll use that tongue to Throw Another Log on the Fire to cause somebody hurt to cause somebody pain right but if we'll clean our heart out our tongue will work differently cuz Matthew 12:34 says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh what's in your heart is going to come out in your mouth and if in your heart is meanness and hatefulness it's going to come out in your mouth that's that's that toxic speech you know that that I we keep labored on the kids go to camp and they come back and all this drama gets stirred up on Instagram or whatever and it's because they don't have a life change and then you come to church and sometimes the adults are in the same predicament and out of their mouth out of their heart spews toxicity why why are you dressed like that why this why this because there's something something lacking down in the heart that's right an unclean heart will say I can I can say anything I want as long as I'm honest but if we'll think about it if we'll think about it think about what our word words mean like James is instructing us to do you know I there's this story uh it's a table quote where brother brandom was advising this couple and and you know he he actually saw a vision about how they were meant to be together and so forth and and he used an analogy of like a golden vow and he was counseling the brother and he said you you better guard your words because there's like a when you get married there's like a golden vow that the more harsh words you say sooner or later The Vow gets depleted more and more and more until all that's left is just a lot of resentment and once the vile is emptied it's never going to be able to be filled up again and see we we think we we just take so lightly the words that we say to each other there's there's a limit in other words what I'm saying is there's a limit to hurtful words before The Vow runs out God can forget but but we remember now that's the the sad state of the thing is that we remember remember we remember when if you loan somebody money and they don't pay you back we'll forgive them we'll release that hurt but the next time they want money you're still going to remember we we it's just part of humanity God can forget he'll throw all these things in the sea of forgetfulness but we remember and there's just no getting away from it we remember we remember all the times that somebody told you you're ugly or how could you be so dumb or that dress looks terrible on you I don't even want to look at you all those things build up so let's not speak from a place of meanness and hurt meanness is important now there's there's Jesus sitting on the chair in the corner and a mean old hateful Pharisee that ain't going to get nothing from Jesus cuz he can't even treat him right get down on your knees and wash him like that dirty old prostitute that everybody's looking at but the Pharisee with all his background all of his all of his word all of his teaching that he's supposed to know but he can't have the right attitude and brother Brian will say B call was just a fine fell but the meanest I ever seen in my life he used to F shoot little phones just to make me feel bad why would anybody want to make somebody feel bad he said you know there's people like that in the world will just make fun of you just to make you feel bad say something evil about you I'm sorry church but that is straight up evil to make fun of somebody just to make them feel bad you sit sit somebody over in the corner have a little family gathering and then you're going to put one of the adults over with the kids so you can laugh at them like Jesus over in the corner just to make them feel bad cuz you don't care about them you just care about you care about your own selfish desires and your own selfish motives you'll put somebody over in the corner and laugh and make fun of them make fun of the way they're dressed and make fun of all these things he said there's people like that in the world it isn't a person it's the devil in that person that's all that person loves his wife just the same as you love yours and so forth likes to eat and sleep and drink and be sociable and things but they do it just because the devil has control of them it's the devil in that person he said now I don't think it's wrong to shoot a phone I'm sorry y'all but I ain't looking at the time I'm holding y'all prisoner this this morning sorry he said now I don't think it's wrong to shoot a phone if the conservation says for you to shoot a phone that's all right Abraham killed a calf and fed it to God so the phone parts all right but not just to be mean now look what Theo the lesson he's explaining here the law said it was all right to shoot the phone but the spirit is what was mean in other words how how the Spirit Matters just as much as what and many times you know you can look at the word of God and say well I I got a right to do this thing I got a right to do whatever and you think that it's right right to do it but the how will be wrong your spirit won't be right am you can approach something with meanness or the the wrong kind of an attitude or something and it it will make the right thing wrong because of the spirit brother R would say this he'd said it's not what you do it's the way you do it so sometimes it's not what you say it's the way you say it I want to think about that that you can say you can say the same thing differently and it'll have two different meanings the right way and the wrong way and what is it the spirit gives it the meaning when Jesus was laying up there in that grave and the spirit entered his body it come out the spirit gave it life the spirit takes the word and makes it live and the spirit will take your words and give them meaning the spirit gives your words meanings he had a right to kill the phone by the law but his Spirit was wrong I think about that story that brother RAM used over and over about Micah being called to the scene by Jehoshaphat and Ahab and Jehoshaphat visited Ahab and they discussed they they wanted to Ahab wanted to go reclaim Routh Gilead and the word said he had a right to go reclaim that land because Joshua had given it to him Joshua prophesied he said you you got a right it's yours but ahab's claim to ramothgilead was invalidated because his Spirit was wrong he wasn't going to listen to to a prophet he wasn't going to listen to the word for his day so Ahab had a write by the word but Jehoshaphat wanted the right spiritual interpretation the Spirit Matters the spirit in which we do things matter matters we we need the right kind of a spirit that's why brother Ram said we said well we got all this word but he said well it doesn't do good to have the word the car up on the blocks you got to have a spark in it to make it come off and ride on the road and fire on the same 16 cylinders it's the life in the body that makes it move it's the life in that car the spark in that car that makes it ride down the road it's the spirit it's the spirit that makes things that makes it return back to the original life God made a way for us to return back to the original life and Jesus would tell that Courier he said in order to get back to the original God has got to speak again that's what he does when he gives you the new birth your old life is gone and you're back to the original word of God you're back to the original when God speak to your heart that's what makes the difference you know this morning that's what we're trying to do to create an atmosphere of Faith where we can begin to grasp a hold to the word of God and and we can begin to hear things differently because brother ran would say you don't hear with your ears you hear with your heart so Faith cometh by hearing according to Romans 10:17 and hearing by the word of God which is why you need to be born again because you're not going to be able to hear right if your heart is not changed your heart your the life in you brother Brown would say when God speaks his peace and the Holy Spirit then you're back in the original family of God again you don't have to be baby then you're a rugged Christian who can stand it what can a rugged Christian stand a rugged Christian can stand persecution and Temptation and isolation and criticism and all those all all the fake all the fake and all the hypocrisy it can power right through it and you know what the hypocrisy and the fake will help you it will help you because it will mold you it will mold your way you think to to look to to run back to the word and find out what's true and what's real it will help you navigate all the trials and tribulations and life changes and he would say that rugged word of God stays right there when he spoke that original voice into your heart you are mine or when you hear God speak to your heart not the minister not the Deacon not the Elder but God speak to your heart not somebody that you're hanging on to their coattails waiting for something to change but God speak into your heart and that's what changes everything God has to speak again he'd say that career perhaps thought this was a time this journey was over and he said so he invited him and so forth and and brother R would say that Jesus always goes where he's invited you know I was meditating on this this this is this is where my problem is I I don't like meanness I you know brother Wade has many times used the example of how sometimes there's people that you don't really want to go on a car long car ride with and and and people that you just can't sit long with and talk and I I feel like that I can just about put up with just about anybody but I just can't hardly stand meanness but Jesus would go to the Pharisees house and maybe that's something that I need to struggle on because it just it just tears me up to see somebody being bullied or somebody being mean to somebody else I don't want to sit in a car on car ride for six hours with somebody that's mean and insulting but Jesus did Jesus would go where he was invited even if it was by an old meanie like Pharisee this Pharisee he he Jesus will go whenever he's invited he'll come he went to a line then one time he came to a fiery furnace even David said if I make my bed in hell he will be there that if you invite him he'll come and and this morning that's something to meditate on if you want God all you got to do is invited because you've got a promise laying there that if you draw nigh to him if you'll just open your heart up an invitation that Jesus will come Jesus will come even if you've got meanness in your heart if you'll just invite him or to think about that he he'll come just open up your heart even even if he knows you're going to make fun of him when he gets there even if he knows you're going to sit him over in a corner he'll come Jesus brother Brown said no matter what your conditions and positions and life is he will still come that's what makes him God to me humble I'll be there and when he got there you think about you think about that situation now if you're a little lamb sitting here today surely you've had many experiences where maybe you were put over in a corner and everybody was laughing at you you can put yourself in that situation and think about Jesus sitting over there in that corner and everybody poking fun of it and making fun of the way he was and well he says he's a prophet he says he's this he he says he believes this message all of those different kind of things and those Pharisees didn't like Jesus they hated him now now look we're this is a lesson in discernment you watch the devil the devil all the time will make fun of the thing that's real will make fun of the thing that's true he's going to mock it he's going to scorn it and this little woman as The Story Goes On I'm trying to wrap it up here when she come around she observed that this Pharisees attitude was Jesus was like that and it picked her entrance interest is what brother rown said oh that's that's that should strike us you know when you hear somebody say well I wouldn't listen to that brother over there I wouldn't listen to that Prophet well if that's what the church world is saying of this day I should piak our interest like it did this little prostitute she know she knew something of them was real you know Jesus and this Pharisee didn't have any fellow they couldn't have any Fellowship because there was their Spirits were different right that was there was no commonality and I'm sorry y'all I gotta I gotta hit this before we close y'all bear with me just a little bit longer look when you see brother Brown would lay it out that when you see young people and old people together something's wrong cuz you can't how can you going to have Fellowship in common when you when you see somebody fellowshipping with somebody that's telling dirty jokes and hanging around their Spirits should be different amen people that like Darkness depression and drama like hanging around other people like that that's right now that's why Christians don't like being around someone that likes all the homosexual jokes and death and suicide and mocking and bullying and all all that kind of perversion and that's why this Pharisee and Jesus could not have communion because their Spirits were different amen aren't you glad this morning that you're out of place in a bar on a honky tonk in a skating rink or in the wrong part of town or that you're out of place in a cold dead Church oh but when the Holy Ghost is is moving you feel right at home you feel right at home amongst other believers amongst other little sheep amongst other little doves amongst other Little Eagles all where the spirits moving aren't you glad that you feel right at home in the house of the Living God where we can praise and worship where we can just turn loose and be be ourselves and I'm going to end on that as the musicians come forward that Pharisee over at Jesus and he just left him with his dirty feet mocking him and scorning him how did he get dirty brother Brandon would say because he come down and got dirty with us he come down in Old Dirty manger and come down on a on a old dirty cross come down and they nail them old dirty nails into his feet and into his hands and he got dirty for us and that's mean that's why he would say that's the meanest man I know somebody that wouldn't feel for a man like that that would come down from glory and pay the price for us come down from glory and and die for us so that we could have his life what a reaction that would be to put him over in the corner and not do for him you know that that doorma was supposed to have put the soft slippers on his feet and anointed him washed him up got him cleaned up and got him got him all presentable but to to think that the god of Glory was left over in the corner there and a little prostitute woman if we'll stand to our feet a little prostitute woman was willing to do more for Jesus than a man that had been Ed educated in all the religious thought of the day that mean man sitting over in that corner that mean man watching in Jesus oh won't we open up our hearts to him today I wonder if we could say like like brother brandom I I wish that I was more Pentecostal I wish that I had more of God I wish that I prayed more I wish that I was less prideful I wish that I could do like that little prostitute woman and just forget about what anybody else thinks about me that's what I wish won't you just lift your hands up to [Music] him Lord God you see every hand that's raised I believe this morning that we're raising our hands because we want more of you we want to be changed I know how I used to be Lord I know how I I was yesterday a week ago a month ago and I know you're changing us Lord Jesus I'm not like I used to be but I'm still not where I want to be and I want to be more changed Lord Jesus God I want you to bake all the meanness out of me I don't want to be a mean man I don't want to be somebody that's all coar so cold inside until I don't care what anybody else thinks like that till while I can just throw out hurtful words and hateful words words and mock what's real and mock what's true Lord God I want you to just take all of that out of me Lord Jesus Lord Jesus I know that Lord there's others with me in this cuz their hands are raised up to you Lord Jesus we've come expecting this morning Lord expecting you to do something for us and Lord I believe that you're on the scene brother Ram said that that little woman come closer she come closer to see that man she come closer to Jesus and I believe Lord that we want to come closer to you to see that you're still the same yesterday today and forever you're still the same God that you always were and you're still in the heart changing business Lord I wonder Lord Lord if you'll just call and reach out to any Lord hearts Lord that need a special touch from you Lord Jesus we need to be changed touch us now Lord God as we worship you let's let's just worship him now let's just praise him give it all over to him you know that little woman when she came to Jesus she broke that Alabaster Box thought she didn't leave it intact but she broke it cuz there ain't no refunds where she was going there ain't no going back she was ready to leave it all behind leave all of her Pride leave all of her meanness on the altar Maybe this morning you're ready to leave all your cigarettes and all your alcohol and all of your hateful speech and all that all the altar so that God can change you if you're willing God's willing God's willing to meet you right where you are if you'll just invite him in if you have a need this morning we'll be happy to pray for you I believe that the word of God is still true the prayer of faith shall save the sick they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you alone
