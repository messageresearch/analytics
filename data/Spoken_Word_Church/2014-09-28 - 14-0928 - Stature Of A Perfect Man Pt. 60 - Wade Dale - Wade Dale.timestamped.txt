[0:01] now he wasn't a man after God's gonna
[0:03] wait
[0:04] because my ways are not your ways and he
[0:08] did all that with Bathsheba but that's
[0:09] because
[0:12] Holy Ghost and his soul to keep him from
[0:14] doing it
[0:15] uh you know brother random thing
[0:22] right
[0:23] and that's what he did he just really
[0:25] he sought repentance he saw Esau wasn't
[0:29] quick enough you know because remember
[0:30] he saw salt repentance
[0:32] but he didn't seek repentance till later
[0:34] on he didn't seek repentance quickly
[0:37] because the Bible even says he saw saw
[0:39] repentance with tears and God didn't
[0:42] hear him because you know why God knew
[0:46] he wasn't serious about it
[0:48] he knows whether you're serious or not I
[0:51] mean you know you you repent and all
[0:53] that and if you're not serious God knows
[0:54] that God knows it and somewhere it'll
[0:57] all come up sometimes um
[0:59] we repent too I mean I mean
[1:03] all right when it's good for us to
[1:06] repent not because it's the right thing
[1:08] to do right well most people repent
[1:09] because they get caught yeah
[1:12] yeah I really honestly you repent
[1:14] because you get caught you know so or
[1:17] like you need God you know and you're
[1:19] desperate that's why David says I seek
[1:22] Him daily so see David there was not I
[1:24] don't believe sure David handed up now
[1:26] but I believe David went by the precepts
[1:29] he went by the Commandments he went by
[1:31] what the priest said you know he had his
[1:33] he had his Earthly problems in his flesh
[1:35] but but as far as as being a man after
[1:38] God's Own Heart he did just like I said
[1:40] that right there I have done thy precept
[1:42] well now if he hadn't been doing it he'd
[1:43] been lying and it would have been in the
[1:44] Bible
[1:45] you understand what I'm saying it
[1:47] wouldn't have been written in the Bible
[1:48] if it would have been a lie so God knew
[1:49] that David kept those precepts every day
[1:52] of his life
[1:53] still living in human life and all that
[1:56] but
[1:57] he knew that if David had a new birth
[1:59] like we do that it would have kept him
[2:01] from doing a lot of those things but of
[2:02] course you know it hadn't been given at
[2:04] that time so I'm sorry we don't have
[2:06] technology today to put anything on the
[2:08] board
[2:10] iPad
[2:13] become a i flop for a mo just for a
[2:16] moment momentarily momentarily
[2:19] charges that no no
[2:22] they got they had a new operating system
[2:25] which I loaded a couple of days ago and
[2:27] it had so many boo-boos in it they came
[2:29] out with
[2:31] 8.2 or 02 and they're loading it now
[2:34] because it something's not right because
[2:37] I'm not working
[2:38] I'm not working and it's not operator
[2:40] error no I'm just done not this time
[2:45] I leave the door open
[2:50] those of you that clapped you can leave
[2:52] now
[2:56] but amen
[2:59] Francine Reed with us today
[3:03] are you drove a long way to get here
[3:04] today
[3:07] so good to have good to have them with
[3:10] us today you'll be blessed by brother
[3:12] Keith I'm sure
[3:13] if he just read the scripture
[3:15] go home it'll be a good it'll be a good
[3:17] day so but what we're what we were
[3:20] talking about what we were going to talk
[3:22] about was we're running around comes to
[3:24] this part right here
[3:26] where he says we've come up this bar and
[3:29] now the holy spirit's going to seal this
[3:31] in
[3:33] it's not a different Holy Ghost like
[3:35] we're talking about remember last Sunday
[3:36] it's not a different Holy Ghost it's the
[3:38] same Holy Ghost but there the degrees
[3:40] are with you and me
[3:43] and you know I may have I may have
[3:45] stated that wrong the Holy Ghost doesn't
[3:46] have degrees only goes to the Eternal it
[3:49] has everything you need we are the ones
[3:51] that give it the degrees right do you
[3:54] understand what I'm saying yeah because
[3:55] remember brother
[3:56] that's all you it's if that's all you
[3:58] can believe that's all you're going to
[4:00] get now the holy ghost that you've got
[4:01] is full of this right here
[4:04] right right the Holy Ghost is full of
[4:06] divine love you don't get the new birth
[4:07] down here and don't get Divine love no
[4:09] you get the you get the headstone
[4:12] but what we have to do as humans we have
[4:15] to process it here right right then it
[4:18] has to drop down here our problem is
[4:19] that we see in a lot of the ministry is
[4:22] honestly they get it here they can read
[4:26] a quote they can take a scripture and
[4:28] like mama said they can just make a good
[4:30] dissertation just like a college
[4:31] professor they can put information
[4:32] together
[4:34] and then they can speak that information
[4:37] and you know you with the Holy Ghost
[4:39] though it can Quicken but they can be
[4:41] standing In a Pulpit and not have one
[4:43] lick of the Holy Ghost that's the
[4:45] anointed ones at the end time because
[4:47] they're Anointed with the true Holy
[4:49] Ghost
[4:50] but they have nothing in their soul but
[4:53] God can anoint them like
[4:55] Caiaphas
[4:56] Caiaphas listen kindness
[4:59] until Jesus came Caiaphas was the man
[5:03] right
[5:04] right catfish was the high priest gone
[5:06] when he went back one year for the sins
[5:09] of the whole of Israel when he went back
[5:11] and put that blood on the altar God
[5:13] accepted that but he knew down inside
[5:16] countless was going to turn him down he
[5:18] knew that were the foundation of the
[5:19] world
[5:20] right
[5:21] I've always wondered and I looked in the
[5:23] end time but you look at Balaam
[5:27] Balaam could get an audience with God he
[5:30] knew how to approach God
[5:32] but that man was evil yeah and it's all
[5:35] he was evil because what he done was he
[5:39] wanted to destroy Israel but he said I
[5:42] can't speak except what God tells me so
[5:44] he honored the gift
[5:46] but remember
[5:48] Satan came in and give him an idea to go
[5:51] around that gift right right
[5:53] and say oh let's just get them to marry
[5:56] among each other and then you'll have
[5:58] your purpose fulfilled whether you think
[6:00] it's got to come right here we're just
[6:02] going to go around it now once the devil
[6:03] always done right God put Adam and Eve
[6:05] in the garden to fulfill this purpose
[6:08] Satan just goes right around Dog's
[6:09] Purpose comes right up here and starts
[6:12] in Eve right but now God's purpose
[6:14] remember will never fail right because
[6:16] when God purposes something it's going
[6:18] to happen
[6:19] so it didn't it didn't disrupt God's
[6:21] plan in the garden being they don't
[6:23] didn't disrupt God's plan but Balaam did
[6:26] destroy a nation
[6:30] he did remember when Israel went whoring
[6:33] with other women and other gods God
[6:37] divorced them he turned them away so he
[6:39] destroyed a whole
[6:41] Kingdom of Israel
[6:43] by what he'd done but
[6:45] Balaam could get an audience with God
[6:48] Balaam knew how to put the quotes
[6:50] together let me put it that way Balaam
[6:53] knew how to put the clothes together
[6:55] knew how to put the scriptures together
[6:57] because remember seven Bulls seven seven
[7:00] rounds yeah see he knew that you had to
[7:03] put this quote with this quote this
[7:05] quote with this quote hello somebody
[7:06] exactly right right he knew how to put
[7:10] all that together and you know what God
[7:11] comes down right and says what do you
[7:14] need
[7:15] he said I want to curse Israel he said
[7:18] you can't do that
[7:21] and you know what they don't goes back
[7:22] to balance and says I can't curse them
[7:24] but in balaam's mind
[7:27] he was thinking
[7:29] how can I get by this because remember
[7:31] brother random city was a hireling
[7:32] prophet he wanted that money he won
[7:34] money remember money women in popularity
[7:36] is the three things that will get you if
[7:38] you standing in any position so you be
[7:40] careful with it
[7:41] and um
[7:43] so Balaam wanted the money part so he
[7:45] just kept going and you know he he kept
[7:48] even pressing God and God said no
[7:50] no
[7:54] the German yeah
[7:59] and God honors respect that's right at
[8:02] that point when they wanted something
[8:04] even a sinner no no and the knew how to
[8:07] respect God for what he said
[8:10] sure that's what he was talking about I
[8:12] was trying to find the word but it was
[8:13] respect because your parents had respect
[8:15] and God so God you know he has respect
[8:17] back to you just like with David David
[8:19] had respect for what word he had right
[8:22] but we have to watch that in the end
[8:24] time because
[8:26] without these virtues
[8:29] without these virtues
[8:31] we are deceived
[8:35] one more time without these virtues
[8:37] working in your life there is deception
[8:39] you say you can be deceived yeah I will
[8:42] to be so close
[8:44] the Bible said it'd be so close till it
[8:47] would try to deceive the very left when
[8:50] I see the very last it's right here
[8:53] so there's a dissection that comes but
[8:55] the Holy Ghost should raise up and say
[8:57] no that's not right right no that's not
[8:59] you know the Holy Ghost should come up
[9:00] and say no that's not right now you not
[9:02] be might not be able to do like me now I
[9:04] can come up and explain that error
[9:06] you understand I can explain that error
[9:09] brother Dale can explain that error that
[9:11] comes forth right but you may have a
[9:13] question in your mind you may even be
[9:15] deceived yourself for a moment of time
[9:16] but I've said in many services
[9:19] we're a Manny Services sorry to say
[9:22] message Services is that when a preacher
[9:24] would say something there'd be something
[9:25] in me go
[9:27] and it would just be a click it'd be
[9:29] just like it was an uncertain sound
[9:32] that's right see you're sitting there
[9:34] dinging now a preacher can preach two
[9:36] hours
[9:38] and be right for an hour and 55 minutes
[9:41] right
[9:45] and preach five minutes of error and
[9:47] brother Brown said it's all wrong
[9:49] right one word off
[9:52] so that's why we have to be careful as
[9:54] preachers we have to we have to not just
[9:56] put quotes together and just put
[9:58] scripture together we have to see what
[9:59] the spirit says and I'm getting
[10:01] somewhere with this it's not it's not
[10:02] because of recent event but it is part
[10:05] of it but right here this right here
[10:08] this is where the Bell Rings the loudest
[10:12] you understand what I'm saying you'll
[10:14] get a little knock from God you'll get a
[10:16] little but when those disciples came to
[10:18] a place
[10:19] to brother Brown said just one little
[10:21] nod from God and they'd go do it
[10:24] one little just a little nod from God
[10:26] they go good see that's why we all have
[10:28] to be led that way they all have to be
[10:30] led by the Lord that if something does
[10:32] you know we were sitting in a meeting
[10:34] one time there was 600 people there and
[10:36] a preacher was preaching away and he
[10:38] made just a you know uh talk about Jesus
[10:41] wanting God and all these things you
[10:42] know and they all all of them get up and
[10:45] shout except me Jim daddy Mama Richard
[10:49] Wilson sister Wilson a couple others we
[10:52] sat there because we didn't agree with
[10:54] it I'm not going to agree with something
[10:55] I don't agree with him
[10:57] and when I think it didn't just stunt me
[10:59] itched Like a Knife stuck in my heart
[11:01] I'm like no wait a minute see they said
[11:03] uncertain sound you hear that and you go
[11:04] okay everything's fine
[11:07] like you're going down a road driving a
[11:09] car and not all eight cylinders are
[11:11] going like this and all of a sudden your
[11:12] cargo boom
[11:14] you go okay what's wrong yeah there's a
[11:16] problem somewhere right so you go back
[11:18] into your
[11:21] memory reason conscious reflection
[11:22] imagination which is where these were
[11:25] remember she taste still smelling here
[11:27] doesn't have anything to do with it
[11:28] that's right she taste spill smelling
[11:31] here is given to everybody to contact
[11:33] the world
[11:34] but now remember they can be deceiving
[11:36] right
[11:38] magicians can prove that magicians can
[11:42] do things to make your your site
[11:44] see something you don't want to see or
[11:46] not see something you do see because the
[11:48] hand's quicker than the eye but the but
[11:50] when you get into memory reading
[11:52] conscious face and Imagination
[11:54] this is where you have to bring it into
[11:56] control in the spirit Realm because
[11:59] remember
[12:00] excuse me if you're born again there's
[12:03] only one sense in your soul right right
[12:05] that's Faith it's not faith and doubt
[12:08] right right that's right that's too Soul
[12:11] right it's not Faith or doubt
[12:14] you're either black
[12:16] or why right right but now what happened
[12:19] with the old Indian was what happened
[12:22] with the old Indian the old Indian the
[12:24] black dog was driven out of the soul but
[12:26] he was still in the spirit because we
[12:27] still that's where we have our problems
[12:29] the problem is the word of God is
[12:32] getting us to because remember the first
[12:34] round see taste still smelling here is
[12:36] everybody
[12:37] Center Saint whoever doesn't matter all
[12:40] right but memory reason conscious
[12:42] affection and Imagination that's where
[12:44] the devil plays and that's where God
[12:47] uses the same thing because God has has
[12:49] to use my memory to bring this back to
[12:51] you right but Satan will bring something
[12:54] to my memory that I did 30 years ago and
[12:57] I'm like where'd that come from well I
[12:58] know where it come from
[13:00] it come from that Fallen condition of
[13:03] Adam
[13:04] the adamic nature is done away with an
[13:08] assault so it's not faith and doubt so
[13:10] faith is in there and doubts cast out
[13:12] but
[13:14] I like what um brother Michael team said
[13:17] no remember Ryan you got next Sunday
[13:19] right okay Coach brother Bob and I'll be
[13:21] in uh
[13:23] that brother um
[13:26] Matthew I want to call him Mike Matthew
[13:28] Brady
[13:30] but remember
[13:32] when you come to a point
[13:36] in the gospel where
[13:39] there's questions
[13:41] I hope this helps you with that you've
[13:42] got a question in your mind
[13:45] the best thing to do is it's not over
[13:46] not overdo it no you know don't press
[13:50] don't press into anything
[13:52] just kind of brother Brown said one time
[13:54] he said just kind of lay it on shelf
[13:56] right so brother Mike holty he had a
[13:59] good example he said if your soul is
[14:01] eternal
[14:02] idiot your soul is easy to turn if
[14:04] you're born again this morning
[14:06] Eternal as God is you have the potential
[14:08] of all this actually you have this
[14:11] but remember what the scripture just
[14:12] said it's in a baby form it's the it's
[14:15] the it's the it's down here at the at
[14:17] the bottom
[14:18] at the Cornerstone
[14:20] the foundation stuff it's got to be
[14:22] built up this is not a statue
[14:26] this is that your hype development that
[14:28] jury is growth up to here all right
[14:31] Robert he said look he said still he
[14:34] said if you're Eternal in your soul now
[14:37] that doesn't ever disagree with the word
[14:38] that's right
[14:40] it can that's right because it is the
[14:43] perfect word but now we have questions
[14:45] in our spirit realm and that Spirit lays
[14:49] so close to that Soul because you can't
[14:51] separate them you know brother Brown
[14:52] drew the circles that's okay that's for
[14:55] reference points just like this is
[14:56] forever
[14:58] but it's not that there's not you fill
[15:01] up with virtue like a tank of gas you
[15:03] fill up with virtue and then you stop
[15:04] and you fill up with knowledge and you
[15:05] stop no it's all intertwined right but
[15:09] your spirit is laying so close to your
[15:10] soul that Spirit still has that Holy
[15:12] damn it nature and I love what he says
[15:14] he said because once you hear has to go
[15:17] through that filter first right
[15:20] right it goes through the spirit realm
[15:23] first that's right goes down into the
[15:25] soul right the soul gives it a positive
[15:28] or negative that's right agree or
[15:31] disagree and when it comes back out if
[15:34] you're not trained right that's right
[15:36] have the virtues working in your life
[15:38] because remember without the purchase
[15:41] then it's a stumbling block to the
[15:43] unbeliever but it's also satanic if you
[15:45] can't handle them what happens is is
[15:48] that that
[15:49] Point comes back out
[15:52] because remember it's got to come out of
[15:53] the heart proceed of all things out of
[15:55] the heart which is not this it's the
[15:57] heart of you
[15:58] when it comes back out to that filter of
[16:00] memory reason conscious faction
[16:01] imagination the devil's sitting there
[16:04] and he starts plugging those fluids up
[16:07] right yeah well he might be right if or
[16:12] this might remember when we all go
[16:15] through it I've just never heard it
[16:16] explain that well because really your
[16:18] spirit does lay so close to your soul
[16:19] you can't separate them
[16:21] you know there's not a circle inside you
[16:23] that's just got your soul and a circle
[16:24] that's just got your spirit no it's all
[16:27] intertwined take the soul out of a
[16:29] person you die
[16:30] close the spirit goes back to God
[16:33] what's the Bible said all right so that
[16:36] sometimes we have to take in the spirit
[16:38] realm this is where these come in into
[16:41] effect
[16:43] because they're already in your soul but
[16:45] it's that it's that part that comes back
[16:47] out
[16:48] that's trying to get out and manifest
[16:50] itself definitely understand what I'm
[16:52] saying it's the part that gets out like
[16:54] when you get a revelation
[16:56] a water baptism
[16:58] that's wonderful
[17:00] but what you got to do is you got to let
[17:01] that come back out
[17:04] not so that you can explain it to others
[17:06] but so that that can live yeah that's
[17:08] right see God doesn't want us just to
[17:11] pack it in our soul and not live it out
[17:12] that's right we need to live it out and
[17:15] to live it out is this this is life like
[17:18] he said one time and I really appreciate
[17:19] what he said he said these are the
[17:21] trials of life
[17:23] these are the trials of Life the these
[17:26] are the things that I deal with every
[17:28] day of my life
[17:30] you should too that's right you should
[17:32] be so conscious that you are virtuous
[17:35] enough that somebody wants to come to
[17:36] you for prayer or come to you to ask you
[17:39] a question or one more and then you
[17:42] gotta have it to give it out
[17:44] but now a lot of times though we sit
[17:46] upstairs or we sit somewhere and we have
[17:48] to filter things that comes down through
[17:50] here
[17:52] down into here I mean it really adhere
[17:54] to here then down to here then when you
[17:57] got that Soul which says yeah that's
[17:58] right well wait a minute
[18:02] you still got that contact coming out of
[18:04] those final senses memory reason I want
[18:06] you to look those up sometimes and read
[18:07] about them you just in a common world
[18:09] just just what the world says about
[18:11] memory reason cons inspection
[18:12] imagination because remember that
[18:14] affection is not affection for God
[18:17] totally
[18:18] remember that's
[18:20] feel your love
[18:21] adopted love is what's in your soul
[18:25] which means that it's not exactly what
[18:27] this is right brother Brown said this is
[18:30] love for your family for your children
[18:31] for your wife This Is The Love for God
[18:34] right right because remember brother
[18:36] round says he said it comes from agape
[18:38] love to feel your love to lust to
[18:41] fornication you know just it keeps
[18:42] getting worse it goes all the way down
[18:44] you see you got to filter all that other
[18:46] out
[18:47] brother Brown priest thinking man's
[18:48] filter right he didn't talk about
[18:51] stopping the flu though we'll watch the
[18:52] flu stopped up and your flu is not
[18:54] stopped up in your soul right
[18:57] I see the Cardinal as God is that is
[18:59] though that is the Genesis 1 26 man
[19:01] that's the one that's preserved before
[19:03] the foundation of the world that's the
[19:04] one that never sinned today in its life
[19:06] right he never had a problem with the
[19:08] word
[19:10] it's just when you bring it down through
[19:11] those filters of memory reason
[19:13] conspection and Imagination where the
[19:15] devil is standing there waiting on it to
[19:17] come right right
[19:20] you ought to all agree with this because
[19:21] it's all happening in your life that's
[19:23] where the devil plays is the memory
[19:25] reason because remember CJ still
[19:27] smelling here it's just how this reacts
[19:30] to that amen this should you know take
[19:33] the Soul and Spirit out and this thing
[19:34] lays there and you can't accuse it of
[19:35] nothing you can't accuse it a dead man
[19:38] of wine that's right he's dead
[19:42] when you say when it comes back out or
[19:46] are you talking about like all the
[19:48] action to it well or like more like your
[19:51] revelation of because what happens is
[19:54] let me give you an example here's a
[19:55] perfect example when I was 14 years old
[19:57] you know we were we come up in a message
[19:59] 1968 well in 1974 I was 14 years old
[20:02] well I started really studying the word
[20:04] of God and I started studying the
[20:05] message of the hour well I had a real
[20:07] good understanding of water baptism I
[20:10] had a real good understanding of serpent
[20:12] seed I knew there was only one God
[20:15] but now I wasn't born again
[20:17] I know that because 20 years
[20:20] Gap in there proved that I wasn't but I
[20:23] had got enough of it in me
[20:25] to where when I did get born again God
[20:27] quickened it real fast
[20:30] I went through justification
[20:31] sanctification and the baptism of the
[20:32] holy ghost in a very short time I was
[20:34] almost like a disciples and I don't make
[20:36] myself nowhere close to disciple but
[20:38] remember the disciples for three and a
[20:39] half years Jesus sat there and preached
[20:40] to him every day
[20:42] so brother Brown said what happened in
[20:44] the day of Pentecost all that they had
[20:46] taken in
[20:48] was quicker so they went right up to
[20:50] here
[20:51] because they all that came back to their
[20:53] memory what Jesus had been telling them
[20:55] remember they didn't understand it
[20:57] before but now on the day of Pentecost
[21:00] Peter's the first one that stood up and
[21:02] he didn't stand up and say men and
[21:03] Brethren repent and be baptized in the
[21:05] name and follow us on hold though just
[21:06] like Jesus said
[21:07] no he gave him the true Revelation that
[21:10] what Jesus had in his mind yeah he gave
[21:13] him that true Revelation on the day of
[21:15] Pentecost but now remember like I said I
[21:18] could have that in my heart I mean in my
[21:20] spirit
[21:22] but that wasn't in my soul my soul still
[21:25] was doubt that is true okay that Soul
[21:28] was not born again so I had it in my
[21:31] spirit because what I could remember
[21:32] right I could reason I had conscious
[21:36] that brother right on was a prophet the
[21:38] devil knows that
[21:40] all those five senses I had those senses
[21:43] of that word
[21:45] coming this far
[21:47] but not here this is the salt it comes
[21:50] this box
[21:51] but now remember when I was born again
[21:54] all that I had here was quick and coming
[21:57] back out
[21:59] and it wasn't to quit it was sure it was
[22:01] to quit smoking drinking and all that
[22:02] stuff but it was that I could take now
[22:04] serpent seed and not just say well it
[22:06] was Eve having sex in the garden with
[22:08] the beef
[22:09] no I can see serpent seeds still
[22:11] affecting us today
[22:13] and see the Revelation that brother
[22:15] Branham preached well see that to me
[22:17] that's the new birth the new birth shows
[22:18] you it never stops unfolding it never
[22:21] stops revealing one God it never stops
[22:23] revealing water baptism
[22:25] it never stops revealing the son of man
[22:27] it never stops revealing things when
[22:28] that thing comes down in that soul and
[22:30] that soul is nothing but God
[22:32] it's got to come out but he's got to go
[22:35] back through them same flus that it came
[22:37] down through
[22:39] everybody understand that it's the same
[22:41] the same word comes in but when it
[22:44] quickens in your heart it's going to
[22:46] have a different reaction when it comes
[22:47] out now if you allow it
[22:52] you say well I I don't think I can have
[22:55] temperance
[22:56] then you won't so you'll stop that flu
[22:58] up God can't work anymore above that
[23:04] right God can't work any more about that
[23:08] but now you come up here and you say
[23:09] well now I got Temperance I'm getting
[23:11] patience I'm getting God I'm getting
[23:12] brotherly kindness then
[23:15] this comes
[23:17] not as another remember there's many
[23:20] refillings there's one baptism that's
[23:22] when God burns the old you out burns the
[23:25] nature of you away and doesn't put
[23:27] another soul in he brings his soul
[23:31] yeah it's not the two Soul people is
[23:32] like you know he kills one and he brings
[23:34] you another one no it's you you're you
[23:37] until the day you die the day you were
[23:39] born you got the same soul
[23:41] in essence you have the same life amen
[23:45] but God Burns that old nature off just
[23:48] let you say well how do you how can you
[23:50] explain that brother Brown said in
[23:52] future home that God does the world the
[23:54] same way he does us
[23:56] so what did he is he going to destroy
[23:58] this world now we believe before
[24:00] see there we go through our filter
[24:03] We Believe before with our eyes reading
[24:05] the Bible that this world was going to
[24:07] be annihilated and we were going to
[24:08] heaven right most denominations believe
[24:10] that you're this is going to be done
[24:12] away with annihilated Bible theft and
[24:15] we're going to go to heaven we'll see
[24:17] when brother Brown preaches a future
[24:18] home he says now that word's not exactly
[24:21] what it seems to be
[24:24] he said God's just going to burn the sin
[24:27] off of this world
[24:30] right and we're going to come live on
[24:32] the earth amen now what same way with
[24:34] the stole a man
[24:37] if the Earth is the center of the
[24:38] universe then you're the center of God
[24:39] Center
[24:41] if you have a new birth you're the
[24:42] center of God well now he's not going to
[24:44] kill that he's not going to kill your
[24:46] soul he's going to burn off that old
[24:48] adamic nature that when you were born
[24:49] that adamic nature attached itself to
[24:52] you and you did wrong
[24:56] right brother Brown I got a quote uh he
[24:59] pulled it up he says
[25:00] Adam Even Adam Adam's Soul was covered
[25:04] with Blackness when he did what he did
[25:06] now he was the son of God so see we can
[25:09] still have trouble and trials and
[25:10] tribulations but it's not in the soul
[25:12] that's right it's in that Spirit realm
[25:14] that's where the devil can play
[25:17] but the Earth is just like us remember
[25:19] we go before the Earth the whole world
[25:22] is groaning and waiting Romans 8 waiting
[25:25] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[25:27] in other words when we come to hear so
[25:29] it's waiting on God to burn off us yes
[25:32] first because see Adam fell and
[25:34] everything fell under him so now we got
[25:36] to start and go back up remember
[25:38] Redemption is not replacement whatever
[25:41] fails got to come back so when Adam fell
[25:43] all nature the Earth
[25:46] fell with it right
[25:48] so now what's going to happen this has
[25:50] got to come back to full manifestation
[25:52] shown in a prophet a little while with
[25:55] the with the squirrels and with Hattie
[25:56] riding with the storms different things
[25:58] there was God or the or the second Adam
[26:01] back in power again
[26:03] everybody got that but remember he was
[26:06] here
[26:07] he wasn't groveling around on the ground
[26:10] crying down here no he was up here at
[26:12] full manifested Son of God yes
[26:15] that's the way I believe it on Sunset
[26:17] Mountain brother Brandon was adopted
[26:19] that's right just like the Lord Jesus
[26:20] the Lord Jesus didn't need to be adopted
[26:22] but he went through the act of adoption
[26:24] right everybody understand that amen so
[26:26] brother Brown went out there when those
[26:27] angels came down and said go back to
[26:29] Jeffersonville dog was saying this is my
[26:31] beloved Son hear ye him right and he
[26:34] could bring us then see somebody had to
[26:36] come to that Jesus had to come to it
[26:38] Jesus was it but he grew in Grace and
[26:40] knowledge that's what we said before but
[26:42] somebody hadn't come to it any end time
[26:43] to draw the rest of us up okay so he's
[26:47] give us the full message of the hour to
[26:49] draw us up
[26:51] so here we are
[26:53] we got to come to here not here we gotta
[26:56] come to here but this is not a this is a
[26:58] refilling this is a more of this is a
[27:03] this is a I now have my memory reason
[27:05] conscious faction imagination under
[27:07] control you're not gonna ever do away
[27:09] with him he's going to be under control
[27:12] right right because you're always going
[27:13] to have a memory you're going to have
[27:14] memory right up to the chain right and
[27:17] even when you get over and changed
[27:20] Bible even says the form of things will
[27:21] be passed away God's going to have the
[27:23] Wi-Fi memory bank out of the bad things
[27:25] I believe we'll remember the good things
[27:27] but all the bad things all the horrors
[27:30] that we went through will never remember
[27:31] that again
[27:33] former things will be passed away all
[27:34] things will be made new okay and we
[27:37] thank God for that what he's going to do
[27:38] for us but seeing your soul that soul
[27:40] never did it to start with that's what
[27:42] brother man could say your soul you the
[27:44] real you never did it in the first place
[27:47] that real one that came from God see
[27:49] brother Brown said God comes down
[27:51] here you are remember the the Bible says
[27:54] that the house is sweating garnished
[27:56] what cleans the sand out but that's just
[27:59] justification the sanctification because
[28:01] if you don't fill it with God that
[28:03] unclean spirit is going to come back and
[28:04] go right back where he was before
[28:07] make you seven or eight times the center
[28:08] that's right religious
[28:12] but if God feels that
[28:14] the good man of the house is in there
[28:16] and nobody can come back
[28:18] nobody can come back in that soul but
[28:20] that doesn't mean they can't come into
[28:21] that
[28:23] Fairgrounds he's going to come back into
[28:26] that Spirit realm and he's going to try
[28:28] to figure out a way to get back into
[28:29] your soul because the same can get in
[28:31] your soul he got you all right that's
[28:33] right but you take that memory region
[28:35] conscious affection
[28:37] and you got your soul as Eternal as God
[28:39] is it never did Sin so what you got to
[28:40] do is you've got to believe this is
[28:42] where our believing's got to come from
[28:43] that's why I think this is so important
[28:45] we've got to believe that when we come
[28:48] to this spot right here it's not that
[28:49] we're not going to have any trouble it's
[28:50] not that we're not going to have any
[28:51] trials no we're gonna have memory like I
[28:53] said right after the change of the body
[28:54] you're gonna remember the bad things you
[28:55] did
[28:56] because the devil's going to be right
[28:57] there brother around right before the
[28:59] chains he said you're gonna throw
[29:01] it's always not my thought was one time
[29:04] is well it's going to get better as we
[29:06] get closer now Jesus didn't get better
[29:08] as he got closer that's right he got
[29:11] worse right the hour not he didn't get
[29:14] worse the things that were upon him got
[29:16] worse he died on a cross he was beat
[29:19] like hamburger meat you know I mean that
[29:21] was his crowning moment right so our
[29:24] crowning moment's not going to be that
[29:26] we're going to walk around here with
[29:27] sinless perfection
[29:29] because we're always going to have
[29:31] memories and conservation imagination
[29:32] and Satan's always going to be able to
[29:34] at least come into that part but when
[29:36] God comes in down the statue of perfect
[29:37] man brother Brown said God comes down
[29:40] and vulcanizes remember he talks about
[29:42] the rubber he only talks about
[29:44] Vulcanizing one time God comes in and
[29:46] brings his soul that Genesis 1 26 man
[29:50] that's right that's what he brings he
[29:52] brings that Genesis 126 man that Eternal
[29:54] not you as a separate person that's
[29:56] right but it's God and brother Brown
[29:58] said this is my eye God gave it to me
[30:00] so now I can say this is my Holy Ghost
[30:02] God gave it to me it's not God's anymore
[30:04] it's mine but it is God that's right
[30:06] that's right it's not God's giving me
[30:08] something it is God coming that's right
[30:09] it's God coming and putting his soul
[30:12] brother Ram said soul to soul
[30:15] see that's where he brings man back then
[30:17] what we have to do though is work our
[30:19] way out
[30:20] about this right here this is the only
[30:22] way we're going to get it it's the only
[30:24] way we're going to keep it kept keep it
[30:26] under
[30:27] um surveillance
[30:29] not gonna be able to do away with it but
[30:30] you're going to be able to survey what
[30:33] happens make a Choice a decision or a
[30:37] judgment
[30:38] by what's in here versus what's out here
[30:41] so we need to go yes ma'am
[30:48] oh yeah the mind is where the memories
[30:51] of conservation of imagination
[30:53] everything all five senses go through
[30:55] the brain memory do your brain reasoning
[30:57] do your brain conscience is in your
[30:59] brain prevention is in your brain first
[31:02] then imagination is always in your brain
