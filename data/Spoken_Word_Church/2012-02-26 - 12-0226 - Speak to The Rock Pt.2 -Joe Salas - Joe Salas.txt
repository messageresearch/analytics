TRANSCRIPT
========================================
not pick onebody I got a few scriptures written down over here so if you want to start with let's start with Exodus 17 1 through 7 and I'm going to continue my thought on speak to the Rock since uh by the way going to be up there so I might have to do is speak to the Rock maybe 100 times or something I don't know one second okay let's start uh 17 verse1 and all the congregation of the children of Israel Journey from the Wilderness of s after their Journeys according to the Commandment of the Lord and pitch in the Great Ria and there was no water for the people to drink where wherefore the people did CH with Moses and said give us water that we may drink and Moses said unto them what shall ye with me wherefore do you tempt the Lord and the people thirst there for water and the people murmur against Moses and said where is this that thou has brought us up out of the Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst and Moses Cried unto the Lord saying what shall I do unto these people they almost ready to Stone me and the Lord said unto Moses go on before the people and take with thee of the elders and thy rod wherewith thou smoke the river take in thy hand and go behold I will stand before thee there upon the rock in herab and thou shalt Smite The Rock and there shall come water out of it that people may drink and Moses did so in the sight of the Elders of Israel and he called the name of the place Mah Mar be because of the CH and of the children of Israel and because they tempted the Lord saying is the Lord among us or not amen last time I read a different scripture so this one's a little bit different the Masters that Rod take the rod and gather the people brother says uh and the rod that Moses had in his hand it was not the rod of Moses it was a rod of God God's judgment Rod Moses held it out over Egypt and flies came he held it out and fleas came up wherever he dumped his Rod it was a judgment Rod it brought judgment Upon A disobedient people and the rod was Christ the substitute for sin and sickness and Moses took the Judgment rod and smoked the rock to bring forth water therefore he said it was a judgment Rod of God that smokees Jesus and killed him the innocent one and brought him from him flow the Holy Spirit to the perishing people now that we may have life said no more do we Smite The Rock but we speak to the Rock I was just thinking uh he said U uh Moses wasn't supposed to Smite The Rock he was supposed to talk to them about the rock they need a little washing of the Water by the word I was just thinking if God was going to destroy them why didn't he just let them die in the desert of thirst but then the lord gave me the answer right away uh then God and Moses will stood in the Gap that's in U number vers 14 11 to 20 and the Lord said unto Moses how long will this people provoke me and how long will it be they believe me for all the signs which I have showed among them I will Smite them with a pestilence and disinherit them and will make thee a greater nation and migher than they and Moses said unto the Lord then the Egyptians shall hear it for thou broughtest up this people and they might from among them and they would tell it to the inhabitants of the land for they have heard that thou thou Lord are among these people and thou Lord are seen face to face and that thy Cloud stand over them and then th goes before them by day time and a pillar of cloud and a pill of Fire by night now Thou shalt kill all these people as one man then the nations with the heard the fame of thee will speak saying because the Lord was not able to bring this people onto the land which he s swear unto them therefore he has slain them in the wilderness and now I beseech thee let the power of my Lord be great according as thou has spoken saying the longest s long as longsuffering and have great Mercy forgiving iniquity and transgressions and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation said pardon I beseech thee iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of their mercy and as thou has forgiven this people from Egypt even until now and the Lord said I have pardoned according unto Thy word I guess Moses was standing together say don't don't don't kill him in the message without money or without priz brother said what would be the children of Israel have given all the The Spoils of Egypt when their lips were bleeding when their tongue was hanging from their mouth they would give all the gold they spoiled the Egyptians for for one for one good cold drink of water their leaders of the Wilderness had led them from oases to Aces from ditches to Springs but they were all dry then there come there they come without money or without price said the voice spoke to the prophet and said speak to the Rock he said the driest thing in the wilderness the farthest thing from water their thirst was quenched without money without price said speak to the Rock not pay the rock but speak to the Rock just imagine he was trying to get water of this thing right here in the message uh making the valley full of ditches brother said said uh drin Gamble I'm going to kind of talk a little bit about water says drink gamble a lot of places allow the kids to smoke in the church or the school just before semester and so forth to quiet their nerves they ought to had a prayer meeting that's the best thing I know to quiet your nerves but you know hungry people has got to fill that longing with something he said if they won't drink from the Fountain of the Waters of Life the devil will give them a St ated sistern Wiggly tails in it it's not sister remember I'm not picking on you guys sisters in it that's right so they'll drink from somewhere say you'll spend that long and either on a devil or a God never was a person ever went to one of those places or done any of those things except it was a hungry hearted person that refused to drink from The Fountains of the Waters of living freely I tell you I feel sorry for them because of the let down and pollution our modern churches that's one of the things they related to the Social Gospel that people preach the water water is a type of the Holy Ghost uh Jesus first miracle was uh he turns water into wine now there's a lot of types and shadows with the the the Holy Ghost you know it could be a seal a sign all kinds of things you know so that's what brother said when you read your Bible don't read it like a newspaper he said uh if you if you don't find Christ in every verse you better go back and read it because you missed something it could be anything Eagles water whatever you know so in the message broken sister brother read the scripture on Jeremiah chapter 12 Jeremiah 2 Jeremiah 2 12 and 13 vers vers it said said be astonished oh heavens at this and be horribly afraid be ye very desolate said the Lord for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me for they found of Living Waters and have fed them other sisters broken sisters that can not hold no water he said Israel had done two great evils God said they had turned him from turned from from him that P on a live it of Life had heue themselves sisters to drink out of it now this is what a sister is said a sister is a place a thing that's dug in the ground to take the place of a well where people doesn't have a well then they get a sister in other words a sister is a man-made tank or a man-made well in the ground that man they out to catch the water to use it some of them use it for wash water and some use it for drinking water and different way maybe all the water sometime that we used to get was on a system used to have an old thing you had to wind around around around to get the water up had little buckets on it to pump the water of a system well we notice one thing about a system that's different from a well now a SST will get empty the SST cannot feel itself it's not reliable you cannot rely upon a SST it has to rely and depend upon the rains and the fall in the summer or in the winter whatever it is usually in the winter time when there snow and rain comes then it runs the water off into the system if it doesn't get that water then you don't have any water it's all it's all dries up it can refill itself the only sister cannot refill itself it gets his feeling from the rains that fall he said I want you to know there's another thing of a sstem you usually find or the way it was out our place the system usually the barn is about twice the size of the house and they usually run the water out of the barn to the sister so every remember the old system while out there when we had when the rain pip rush into it often the off the barn it fills from the barn so then the water is carared from the roof of the barn where all the animals stepping around it through the Stables yard all the filth of the Barnard saddles on top of the barn in dry in dry times and then the water comes and washes it all on off the roof into a trough that's manmade then in into a man-made spout and into a man-made sister if you haven't got a MK I don't know what you got when you got a sister your sir it's all man-made and just as dirty as it can be you know we used to call we had a filter rag on one did you ever know what that was had to put a filter rag on it to catch all the bugs and things that come off the top of the root Barn all around the place and pour her from one place to another into the sister and we used to put a filter rag on to catch all that scum and stuff that we could course that would catch the real dirt that would not catch the real dirt he just cut the big missiles that came down and fell into it he said the bug might fall in but the juice of the bug went on with the water like he cut the bugs but the juice still went over the water so you were still drinking the juice I like that part so you really had a mess when you had an old dirty sister in a few days you let that water stand there and it becomes stagnant it you let the water stand in the sister it becom stagnant and it gets full of frogs and lizards and snakes and we used to call it Wiggy Tails little bitty I don't know whether they're not a par parasite there I cannot I don't know what to call them but some little thing gets in the water that they that we call WIIL you know what it is I me knows what I'm talking about I don't know what you're talking about good drinking water these lovers are stagnation comes with it it just actually comes because it's stagnant and because it's stagnant it draws the animals that they they like stag stagnated things you see that's a whole lot of uh our churches today I think that we have left one of the great things that the church has done today just like Israel then it left him a Fountain of Living Waters and they sh themselves at a manmade sisters and they became a habitation everything that loves that kind of water lizard frogs all kinds of unclean germs live in it because it's a man-made tank and in his tank these things stay a perfect simple of our denomination today same my message that's exactly what the people does today they refuse a word to take a Domin denominational system because in that they can do what they want and and get get by with it but you can't do it in Christ you got to come clean and clear in order to be in Christ leaving the Artisan well for man-made system or sister could you imagine someone doing that could you imagine a manal condition a person that could drink at a fresh arasan well and Rel leave that for a manmade sister with frogs and lizards and Wily Tails he said by the Fountain of Living Water gives it out free without pumping joining anything else I'm glad for that Fountain yes sir he need needs no strainer in it to take the parasites out for his coming so deep down there in the rock until there's no parasites there so they don't eat no filter no strainer no pumping no jerking no nothing else it's just there bubbling up they don't have to depend on local rains to fill it up he said rains are revivals where that Fountain that's a fountain Al but the carcass is the Eagles will gather the Eagles will gather you don't have to pump up a Revival you don't have to pump up nothing only thing you have to do is just come to the Fountain it's always full of good fresh water and there's no end to it it just keeps on bubbling now I'm going on water a little bit and no uh the flood talk about the flood and stuff and brother brother Dale been talking on U The Plan of Redemption so it's kind of I don't want to go into this message but I want to talk about water said in the future home uh brother said now the one that is the present world we live in now call it a world the old world that stood out of the water Genesis 1:1 now in a world that is now present and then again he refers to another one the world that is to come the new world three worlds three three stages of the world and notice how God makes his plan to us his Plan of Redemption oh this just Thrills my soul when I saw it how he makes plan plain to us here now his Plan of Redemption now compare with what we see with our eyes what God has done to redeem his world he's done the same plan to redeem his people for the unchangeable god changes not any of his plans or anything such a glorious thing how he led us to himself to a Tabernacle in Us by three stages of Grace just like he's L the world in three stages come through the world as God will come to the world after it's gone through three stages stages of purification that's exactly how he comes to us through three stages of Grace I I thought that the thought that at the beginning I'll never change since it's since it's God's word he said you had to keep your threes together your sevens your twelves he say your number must be run perfectly on your you get your picture or else you'll be all mixed up if you can't understand it it just keep just keep praying you watch you'll cut right and exactly god is perfect in three he said now the anavian world he after he had repented but through the bride that day Noah he gave it a water baptism covered with water and justification show that he's on his road to call his Fallen World from Eden back to his restoration again then Christ came and shed his blood upon it cleansing it and claiming it see that's the world that we live in now he said see how Satan here in the scripture tried to make him break God's plan to receive it said he said give it to him when he took him up on the mountain tried to give it to him without purchase of the blood he said notice the baptism are for to cleanse it from sin from sickness from disease germs from sinners from the devil and all of his groups each to be cast out in the Lake of Fire Holy Fire from God and come down from God out of heaven and burns it up to make it ready for God to dwell in for God in the new world that is to come is to dwell in the earth CA you say God he dwells in the human heart because he and his bride come one and they go to their home in a new world and the same Plan of Redemption is used to redeem both world and the person that we live in he's talking about cleansing the Earth brother say it doesn't burn the whole Lord just the atmosphere the devil the sin and everything said uh no was a type of the remnant that scared over not that translate a bunch Enoch one man went in the Rapture Before the Flood came showing that the church does not go into the tribulation or anything in it you was transl translated one man oh the church may be a number but the bride is going to be a very small group they'll make up the bride now the church may I say you compare eight with one eight times less will be the bride than the church and the righteous scarcely be saved where will where will the Sinner and the ungodly appear those who know better to do it and go ahead and do it anyhow those who follow the rules of denomination instead of work where will they appear at you call Christians yet call Christians taking the name of the name of Christ he said I perfectly known was the type of those cared remember when Noah came out H was with him sin was still in there sin went right on over through the ark unbelief doubt went over in the ark carried above the Judgment but but Enoch went higher than the ark he went on into the presence of God but Noah went through and came out and there was still sin a type of the mum of the world's condition and the mess speak to the Rock said uh let's look at some people that spoke to the Rock let's find out what taking place the first man that ever spoke to a rock was a man that gu got tied up in some theology he made himself a set of fig leaves and he thought they would do just as good as anything but when he came face to face with God he found out he was naked what did he do he spoke to the Rock and the rock made a way escap for him the rock that was in Eden you see there was Noah another man who had preached and the people ignored and laughed at him one day he spoke to the The Rock and The Rock took him in the ark and tucked him away in his arm rode him above the storm and drowned the persecuting world yes sir he said there was a man named Daniel once he who was in The Lion then he went out into Babylon and he said he said in himself that he was not going to defile himself with the king's meat he wasn't going to have anything to do with the world though he had to live among those people he but he wasn't going to defile himself he purposed in his heart he wasn't and one day the king threw him into the lion's pit because he was walking in the line of duty but he spoke to the Rock and that Pillar of Fire came down kept the Lions off of him and all night because he spoke to the Rock before he went to the pit he said uh notice Hagar she been put out of her home she had a little little nursing boy is ishma she went out into the desert no place to go the water had run out what could she do she'd been raised in a home that was acquitted with a rock what did she do she didn't want to see the baby die so she took the little fellow and laid him under a tree and went off a bow shut and fell down her on her knees and she spoke to the Rock and The Rock poured forth his Waters and the baby was saved and to this day for she could stand there at that Fountain said all right to God who has seen me she spoke to rock for her dying baby oh we and speaking terms with a rock and do we listen to when when the Rock speaks to us and tells us right sister Jun was saying what is the rock up to you do we listen any questions any comments you know what then people sitting out there no water and the Lord just let him stew for a while look imagine looking at your kids and your animals yeah dying Noah sitting there in the ark and you know his own family was doubting him doubting the Lord are we any different my kids sister June's daughter your kids I mean it wouldn't be nothing for the Lord to bring them all and to the alt well we like said we got to apply the toen to to well they do every day but still they got to see that they're lost I thank the Lord every day that he showed me I was lost until he showed me that I couldn't get nothing said want they're over in your roof you're you're responsible but once I leave what what can you do like Amy and Jeffrey what can we do growing up kids you know the Pharisees couldn't say they was lost the Pharisees they couldn't see they was lost when they appear before Jesus cuz they thought they was all R so they didn't say don't need and they they're very uh religious people right and they put they we supposed to be religious people too but we all like brother been talking all that stuff going on and that message with people going this doct or that do that do he say he going to be a smar very small group so you got to say I'm the one that's going amen amen amen that's all I got thank you
