[0:24] me about 53 years ago is there a
[0:26] difference between this book in the
[0:27] other book no
[0:29] no not your perfect man book it should
[0:31] be
[0:32] uh you may have got one that wasn't many
[0:34] in the 70s it was a bridge but the
[0:36] unabridged ones
[0:38] like that one
[0:40] and all the others
[0:42] abridged means that they took the uggs
[0:44] and the odds and the ease out you know
[0:46] brother man would go uh uh uh well they
[0:48] took that out well then they put it on a
[0:49] bridge where if he said it that's
[0:51] exactly what they put down right
[0:53] i like that which is better that way
[0:56] yeah so it's more let's turn to the
[0:58] second
[0:59] peter
[1:02] and for some of y'all i want you to i
[1:03] want you to listen to this
[1:05] we had a great
[1:06] uh bible study last night
[1:09] i endure you in the name of the lord to
[1:11] be at the next one
[1:13] right whatever you've got on saturday
[1:14] night that's important it ain't as
[1:16] important as the word of god
[1:19] sorry the word of god is more important
[1:21] but we're studying on adoption and the
[1:22] status of perfect man and man we're
[1:24] getting into some real boy last night it
[1:26] was 8 30 before we got finished
[1:29] we just kept going
[1:31] anyway
[1:32] and he wasn't finished we had to just
[1:34] stop him right you know i got a call
[1:36] today
[1:37] so
[1:38] so just just really i mean there's
[1:39] really
[1:41] um
[1:43] there's nothing more important i i don't
[1:45] see that there is i mean there's things
[1:47] you have to do in life sure
[1:48] but
[1:49] this coming
[1:51] month
[1:52] in may or april april
[1:56] try to be here try to be here just try
[1:58] to be here because we really got into
[2:00] some things last night
[2:02] and you know what it cleared up a lot of
[2:04] things that even
[2:06] the older ones got out of it plus the
[2:09] younger ones
[2:10] but folks this is a requirement this is
[2:13] not something that you might do
[2:15] or could do
[2:17] or an option
[2:18] in the end time this statue of birth
[2:20] man's not an option it's a requirement
[2:23] you've got to go up that statue of a
[2:25] perfect man or
[2:27] you're facing death
[2:29] because of
[2:32] being in the end time this is what it
[2:34] requires what we were reading last night
[2:36] so let's turn to second peter
[2:41] because see last sunday was kind of a
[2:43] shocker to you which is good that it
[2:45] shook you up you know why
[2:48] you gotta know where you are before you
[2:50] can start somewhere
[2:53] you got to know where your mind is
[2:54] before you can start
[2:57] okay
[2:58] so maybe i hope i took your hard drive
[3:01] and destroyed it destroyed your hard
[3:04] drive so now what you start adding
[3:06] information that you need
[3:07] because of misinterpreted theology which
[3:10] is anti-word right
[3:12] we had these thoughts and we had these
[3:14] ideas and we had these well as long as i
[3:16] said in a message church i'm okay
[3:18] that's the most damnable place to be if
[3:21] you're not born again
[3:23] but now look
[3:25] some have expressed
[3:28] uh and not just one but
[3:30] several have expressed they're
[3:32] uh wondering if they have the new birth
[3:36] and if you don't
[3:37] if you don't have the new birth
[3:39] you can still learn these you say oh how
[3:43] the disciples
[3:45] were not born again right
[3:47] but for three and a half years god sat
[3:49] there and he pounded that word into him
[3:51] through jesus christ he sat there but
[3:53] when the holy ghost fell guess what it
[3:55] done
[3:58] it shot him up to here right back from
[4:00] there
[4:01] brought back the remember things which
[4:02] because that's what the holy ghost said
[4:03] it would do it will show you things to
[4:05] come bring back to your remembrance
[4:06] whatsoever i've said
[4:08] and show you things to come all right so
[4:10] if we all realize that we're right here
[4:14] and this thing is anti-word which it is
[4:16] this is anti-word all right
[4:19] dad just
[4:20] dad just lifted it right up when we went
[4:22] upstairs sunday if you heard what he
[4:23] said about martin luther
[4:25] and the soul martin luther was right
[4:27] but in his mind he was the anti-word
[4:29] that's what i said and you know a lot of
[4:30] y'all have a problem with it but that's
[4:32] okay if you got a problem with it i
[4:34] don't mind
[4:35] but just realize one thing we are
[4:37] anti-christ until we're in christ
[4:41] our mind our intelligence our thinking
[4:43] is anti-word
[4:46] we were born wrong
[4:48] born wrong
[4:49] but now look you say well i don't like
[4:51] you say that why not let's start right
[4:54] there though because god has made a way
[4:56] that's right to make it right
[4:58] he's made a way to keep us from being
[5:00] anti that's right
[5:02] see but you got to get a foundation
[5:03] first right you got to do what is
[5:05] removable
[5:07] in the book of zechariah zerubbabel
[5:09] cleaned off the foundation right
[5:12] you can't just go you see this old house
[5:14] back here that this man's tearing down
[5:16] now he didn't just build a house right
[5:17] around that or on top of that what do
[5:19] you do he cleaned off the trash
[5:22] got it down to the foundation and i'll
[5:24] guarantee he's probably going to build
[5:25] him a house or something but he had to
[5:26] get all that trash out of the way all
[5:29] right
[5:31] i was just going to say it
[5:33] why have a problem with being born wrong
[5:35] but i mean you can't get right if you're
[5:38] not wrong
[5:40] and to realize you're wrong to realize
[5:42] you're wrong then god can help you to be
[5:44] right i wasn't trying to leave everybody
[5:45] hanging last sunday we but we're born
[5:47] anti-war but there is a way back
[5:50] there's an entrance we read it last
[5:52] night we're going to read it right now
[5:53] so let's read this
[5:54] then we'll let the prophet read it
[5:57] everybody see that now
[5:58] joe can you see it okay
[6:00] okay good all right
[6:02] thank god for

[6:17] yeah okay i don't have the thing i'll do
[6:20] it
[6:21] they can't hear me
[6:23] we can get it off that recording okay
[6:27] i'm loud enough don't we sing
[6:28] yeah somebody read this yeah
[6:31] yeah you don't need them peter chapter
[6:33] one let's read it now let's go and let's
[6:34] read i want you to read it like we did
[6:35] last night in the bible study
[6:38] simon peter a servant and an apostle of
[6:40] jesus christ to them
[6:42] so that's a special group i circled that
[6:44] in my bible
[6:45] to
[6:46] them if you're one of them then you're
[6:49] like peter which had the baptism of the
[6:51] holy ghost all right
[6:52] to them
[6:53] that have obtained
[6:56] that word obtained means entrance
[6:59] all right you've been you've obtained
[7:01] something all right
[7:03] light precious faith with us
[7:06] through
[7:07] there's another entrance through there's
[7:08] a door been made open through the
[7:11] righteousness of god and our savior
[7:12] jesus christ grace and peace be
[7:14] multiplied unto you through the
[7:16] knowledge of god and of our lord jesus
[7:18] christ our jesus our lord
[7:20] according as his divine power now look
[7:22] at all these divines
[7:24] hath given unto us all things that
[7:26] pertaineth unto life
[7:29] look life lessons that's what we're
[7:31] learning about right
[7:33] we're not gonna be need to talk this
[7:35] statue of a perfect man when we get to
[7:37] glory but we are gonna be at different
[7:39] places that's what we're talking about
[7:40] last night and levels of understanding
[7:43] but this is to get us through
[7:45] to this requirement
[7:48] see to understand the seals you got to
[7:49] be right here at the faith of the
[7:51] fathers
[7:52] all right so now
[7:55] we'll get into that later on because
[7:56] that's a long ways after we get finished
[7:58] with all the virtues
[8:00] to life and godliness so it's pertaining
[8:03] to life what you do in life
[8:05] and it's pertaining to your godliness or
[8:07] your christian walk
[8:08] through the knowledge of him that have
[8:10] called us to glory and virtue
[8:14] whereby are given now what does the word
[8:16] given mean gift he give these all right
[8:19] unto us exceeding not just a little
[8:22] exceeding
[8:24] overflowing great and precious promises
[8:27] that by these the prophet said these
[8:29] promises we'll read the man
[8:30] you might be partakers
[8:33] of the divine nature
[8:35] this statue of a perfect man is the
[8:37] divine nature of almighty god it is god
[8:40] himself living through human flesh right
[8:42] all right
[8:44] but you got to start somewhere you got
[8:45] to start by cleaning the thing out
[8:48] and then later on we're going to read
[8:50] about sister shepard's dream maybe not
[8:51] today where she dreamed and and the
[8:54] pyramid was there and there was water
[8:56] flowing out and brother brown said there
[8:58] was trash coming out
[9:00] you still got trash in you at the new
[9:02] birth yeah you still got trash in you at
[9:04] the new birth
[9:06] or we wouldn't need this growth
[9:07] development all right
[9:10] remember just like
[9:12] jonas jonas has every faculty he needs
[9:16] to drive a car he's not going to gain
[9:18] any new parts or eyes or hands or feet
[9:21] but he's going to grow in coordination
[9:24] he's going to grow in development of
[9:27] learning knowledge of being able to
[9:29] drive a car
[9:31] but he's still got the brain right there
[9:32] that he's always going to have
[9:34] so when you're born again when the
[9:35] baby's born you got what you need
[9:38] like i was telling bob this morning
[9:40] brother ramsay when you become born
[9:41] again you got enough power in you to
[9:43] create a world
[9:45] and go live on it
[9:47] but there's a bar holding you what is it
[9:50] memory reason conscious affection
[9:52] imagination of this world
[9:55] this world
[9:57] it has
[10:00] encased or
[10:02] like a capsule all the stuff you need is
[10:04] inside the capsule but this stuff is
[10:06] holding the capsule together
[10:08] which is called us and that's why we
[10:10] have to do this
[10:11] or we have to go by the grave remember
[10:13] we preaching on purging
[10:16] you're purged two ways you're either
[10:17] purge when you're alive or you purge
[10:19] when you die
[10:20] death purges
[10:22] the old
[10:23] you
[10:24] because when you resurrect you're not
[10:26] going to come back up the same
[10:28] listen to me the same
[10:31] person you were
[10:32] right that samuel and peggy dale brought
[10:34] forth right
[10:36] you're going to be made new a new but
[10:38] you're still going to have this
[10:40] but it's going to be made new that's why
[10:42] the bible says that we can't see god in
[10:44] this flesh we can't take this flesh to
[10:46] heaven this flesh to heaven right right
[10:48] it's got to be changed that's right
[10:50] so that's what it's doing now because
[10:52] this is anti
[10:53] but we're going to be changed because
[10:55] the bible says we plant them in
[10:56] corruption this is corruption but we
[10:58] raise them in incorruption what death
[11:00] destroys the effect of the fall because
[11:03] once a christian resurrects he's never
[11:07] going to fall again
[11:09] but see we're in a fallen condition
[11:11] but there's going to be a group of
[11:12] people that's going to stand on the
[11:13] earth and death is not going to be able
[11:15] to hold this and we're going to be
[11:16] changed in the moment in 2012 that's the
[11:18] promise
[11:19] but it's not going to happen right here
[11:22] it's not going to happen in virtue no
[11:24] it's temp no
[11:26] no those people die they have to be
[11:28] purged god wants a full stature right
[11:30] right
[11:32] okay never understand he wants a full
[11:33] stature right here at the headstone
[11:35] that's what he wants that's what he
[11:36] requires because listen to this watch
[11:38] excuse me
[11:40] whereby are given unto us
[11:42] exceeding great and precious promises
[11:44] that by these
[11:45] promises you might be partakers of the
[11:47] divine nature
[11:49] having escaped the corruption that is in
[11:51] the world through lust all right
[11:55] and besides this what besides the new
[11:57] birth
[12:00] that's what he's saying besides because
[12:01] he's giving you the divine nature
[12:02] besides this add to your faith so see
[12:05] there's seven as but it doesn't start at
[12:06] faith
[12:10] if you do there's eight
[12:12] there's eight it's not really look at
[12:14] somebody we got the chart last night it
[12:16] says add to your faith one two three
[12:18] four five six number seven is love right
[12:21] add to your faith well right there it is
[12:23] i'm sorry yeah add to your faith one two
[12:26] three four five six seven
[12:29] all right add to your faith sure faith
[12:32] is
[12:32] faith is the foundation right and to
[12:35] your faith
[12:37] and to your faith
[12:40] i need to postpone that
[12:44] i don't want that to happen right now
[12:45] all right
[12:46] and besides this what besides this new
[12:49] birth that you just received
[12:52] giving all diligence
[12:55] now that doesn't mean
[12:56] dilatory
[12:58] that means diligence that means you got
[13:00] to get up and do it
[13:02] add to your faith
[13:05] is something you have required it's a
[13:07] gift god's given you the new birth so
[13:09] add to your faith
[13:12] in other words what i said last night
[13:13] add this to the bible it's not an
[13:15] addition but listen it's between the
[13:16] lines add to what you believe
[13:20] virtue
[13:22] and to what you believe knowledge
[13:26] see add to what you believe you got to
[13:27] believe those who believe yes the bible
[13:30] says believe it
[13:31] and do knowledge temperance temperance
[13:33] patience patience godliness godless
[13:34] brother kindness brother kindness
[13:36] charity or love which is the top
[13:39] for if these things be in you
[13:43] in you
[13:44] not on you not an anointing but in you
[13:50] and abound
[13:53] and abound abound means that if you
[13:56] didn't just get
[13:58] four apples off your tree you got 400
[14:00] apples off your tree you're free
[14:02] abounded with fruit
[14:04] that's the same thing with you and i
[14:06] they make you now that word mate there
[14:09] means just like i'm gonna make jim get
[14:11] up and go to town tomorrow
[14:13] there's a requirement that you go to
[14:15] town and i'm the head so i'm going to
[14:16] say you need to go it's going to make
[14:18] you but if she has these virtues in her
[14:20] if we have these virtues and it's going
[14:22] to make us do this
[14:24] you see what i'm saying it's going to
[14:26] make you be
[14:27] fruitful because if it doesn't look they
[14:29] make you that you shall neither be
[14:32] barren
[14:34] or unfruitful
[14:36] so if you do that it's going to make you
[14:39] productive
[14:41] and very fruitful all right
[14:44] automatically automatically it's going
[14:45] to make you that's worth making i've
[14:47] underlined it for years that's what it's
[14:49] that's what it's telling us it'll make
[14:50] you do these things all right
[14:53] it'll make you that you shall neither be
[14:54] bear nor fruitful in the knowledge of
[14:56] our lord jesus christ
[14:59] but he that lacketh these things is
[15:01] blind
[15:02] that word blind is gross darkness all
[15:04] right you're blind if you don't see
[15:06] these things you're blind yes and cannot
[15:08] see it far off what revelation
[15:11] all right
[15:12] and have forgotten
[15:14] that you were purged
[15:16] from your old sins
[15:19] no words backslid you forgot where you
[15:21] came from
[15:23] so this is written to christians
[15:24] remember this is people with like
[15:25] precious faith
[15:26] so he's not jumped over and talked to
[15:28] sinners he's still talking to christians
[15:30] all right
[15:30] everybody got there
[15:32] but either lack of these things is blind
[15:33] even if you're a christian you can be
[15:35] blind how many of us become newborn
[15:37] christians and then we see more and more
[15:40] right right that's right that means we
[15:41] were blind to it that's right right yeah
[15:44] man okay
[15:45] but now once light's been given to you
[15:50] if you still are blinded then you need
[15:52] to go back and get born again right see
[15:55] that's where you realize whether you're
[15:56] born again or not it's whether the word
[15:57] that you see now you may not see
[15:59] everything but god just shows you little
[16:01] things along the way
[16:03] and he'll help you with the little
[16:04] things along the way to make sure that
[16:05] you know that you're a christian but
[16:07] don't forget that you were purged from
[16:08] your old sins don't forget where you
[16:10] came from that's what i said last sunday
[16:12] that's what this says
[16:14] and forgotten that he was purged from
[16:16] his old sins
[16:18] wherefore the rather brethren
[16:21] in other words don't be in darkness
[16:22] rather do this
[16:24] give diligence to make your calling an
[16:26] election sure sisters and brothers it's
[16:29] not just preachers and deacons
[16:31] 120 in the upper room that were that
[16:34] were at the faith of the fathers there
[16:35] were some women there amen
[16:38] there was some women in that
[16:40] wasn't just 120 men
[16:43] no
[16:44] the lord jesus's mama was there mary was
[16:47] there
[16:48] she received virtue knowledge
[16:49] temperatures goddess brother countless
[16:52] right sure she did
[16:54] because they went out a very mildly
[16:55] church
[16:56] you got to have the sisters involved
[16:59] also
[17:00] you just if she just knew her place mary
[17:02] didn't jump out and start preaching the
[17:03] word of god that's right sounds right
[17:05] she ain't getting a pulpit and get her a
[17:06] church
[17:08] no she got the sisters together
[17:10] she told her sisters about god she told
[17:12] the sisters about this she because
[17:13] brother brown said a holy ghost-filled
[17:14] woman can help you if you'll listen to
[17:16] her all right
[17:18] wherefore the rather brethren give
[17:20] diligence to make your calling and
[17:21] election sure
[17:24] now here's a promise i triple underlined
[17:26] this and wrote promise
[17:28] for if ye do these things
[17:31] ye shall never
[17:33] fall
[17:35] now is that a promise or what
[17:37] you shall never fall
[17:39] sure we'll do things wrong sure what but
[17:41] you shall never fall what fall away from

[20:27] okay
[20:31] let's see grace all right the outside
[20:33] world this is to the church
[20:34] those that are in christ grace and peace
[20:36] be multiplied unto you through the
[20:38] knowledge of god and through
[20:39] of our lord of our jesus of jesus christ
[20:42] our lord according as his as his divine
[20:44] power has given unto us all things his
[20:46] divine power now has given unto us all
[20:48] things that pertain into life
[20:50] godliness through the knowledge of him
[20:51] that has called us to glory and virtue
[20:53] whereby
[20:54] are we given unto given unto us
[20:57] exceeding great and precious promises
[20:58] that by these prophets said these
[21:00] promises
[21:01] he might we might be partakers of the
[21:03] divine nature
[21:05] now let that soak in real deep now not
[21:07] preaching this morning we're just
[21:08] teaching divine nature let me read that
[21:10] fourth verse again so you won't miss it
[21:12] whereby we are given whereby we are
[21:14] given unto us exceeding great and
[21:16] precious promises that by these these
[21:18] promises we might be partakers of the
[21:20] divine nature having escaped the
[21:21] corruption that is in the world through
[21:23] lust see the world
[21:25] we've escaped that now
[21:27] he's addressing this to the church
[21:29] that's why we're here this morning is to
[21:30] find out what is the way
[21:32] what is god's requirement
[21:36] that's his requirement
[21:37] all right
[21:39] so brother branham is opening a door
[21:41] like peter did an entrance for us to get
[21:43] back to the statue of a perfect man to
[21:46] the faith of the fathers all right
[21:48] there's not a person in here that loves
[21:50] god but wants to become more like christ
[21:53] now it's laid out here every christian
[21:56] i'm an old veteran look at brother and
[21:57] sister kid here they're probably the
[21:59] oldest in the building but if i'd ask
[22:00] them what is your heart's desire to be
[22:02] closer to god when you learn of christ
[22:04] there's something about him that's so
[22:05] loving you just try to get right into it
[22:08] then he told his wife he said i'd like
[22:10] to
[22:11] that's where he says here he says i love
[22:12] you so much so i'd like to take you and
[22:14] pull you inside of me so we could just
[22:16] be really be one
[22:18] more now that multiply that by a hundred
[22:20] million
[22:22] and then you'll find out how that the
[22:24] believer who falls in love with christ
[22:26] wants to get into him because it's a
[22:27] love
[22:29] and here he's going to show us how that
[22:31] through these promises
[22:33] we might be partakers of christ's divine
[22:35] nature these mortal body
[22:39] how that we can be protectors
[22:42] mortal body
[22:43] this is what's supposed to be working
[22:45] outside from the inside working his way
[22:47] outside all right
[22:52] he's talking about soul mating which is
[22:54] he didn't agree with that so and i don't
[22:56] either
[22:57] i'm not getting married to such a such a
[22:59] girl but that's that's the way it is
[23:01] with christ we got to be so in love with
[23:03] him until we ask for something and he
[23:05] doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake
[23:07] us a bit right everybody understand that
[23:09] yes remember god's nose are the best
[23:11] answers you'll ever get yes that's right
[23:13] cc why and the only way you can do that
[23:16] is to become partakers of his divine
[23:18] nature
[23:19] then you'll understand the reason
[23:22] see god doesn't have to really give us a
[23:24] reason
[23:25] he's almighty he can just say no but he
[23:27] gives us a reason he tells us why he's
[23:29] not going to give it to us
[23:31] he says
[23:33] why become takers you'll understand the
[23:35] reason he can't give it to you
[23:38] that's what i want to see because
[23:39] sometimes we get
[23:41] we get all something we do we get all
[23:43] pouty with god
[23:45] yeah we do we do we get pounding with
[23:47] god
[23:49] i was just thinking when you were
[23:51] reading that that kind of correlates
[23:53] with
[23:54] a woman's role
[23:56] like being subject i mean it's kind of
[23:58] like the same thing like
[24:01] you should be able to subject totals
[24:03] sure right
[24:05] and if the husband says no he has a
[24:06] reason
[24:08] but if you're a little baby about it
[24:10] okay little baby about it
[24:14] we go pouty we that's what he's saying
[24:16] right there we go kind of pouty but now
[24:19] with this divine nature though with us
[24:21] with a sister that's under subjection to
[24:23] her husband and true subjection not as a
[24:25] slave but true subjection that you to
[24:26] live as one you'll understand the reason
[24:29] he can't give it to you
[24:30] and if we don't
[24:32] we just accept it we should accept it
[24:34] just like it is right because to be
[24:36] partakers of his divine nature he knows
[24:38] what you need before you ask for it so
[24:40] he knows that we can ask amiss but he
[24:43] can't ask amen
[24:45] and the holy ghost can't ask a miss a
[24:47] lot of things we do is in the flesh
[24:49] right a lot of things we do in the flesh
[24:52] it don't prosper
[24:55] right right but if you ever seen though
[24:57] to ask something of god and you get in a
[24:59] channel
[25:00] that god will answer that prayer
[25:03] and man you go well thank you god yes
[25:05] you know you say thank you god you
[25:06] answered that prayer but you know what
[25:09] he answered it in his time that's right
[25:12] see and in his place there's nothing
[25:15] you know we want there's a lot of things
[25:16] we want in this room you look at that
[25:18] right back there on that wall there's a
[25:20] lot of people we want in this church
[25:24] and we pray but do we pray diligent
[25:26] enough
[25:28] do we sign cry like daddy said for the
[25:30] abomination well that's an abomination
[25:31] that they're not here to me that's an
[25:33] abomination that those kids and people
[25:35] husbands and wives brothers and sisters
[25:37] are not in this church today right to me
[25:40] it's an abomination and i'm part of that
[25:41] i'm not saying i'm i'm over here and
[25:43] everyone no i'm an abomination
[25:46] see we go back to the end time part i
[25:48] realize every day when i get up i'm
[25:50] anti-word
[25:51] sorry i'm just i'm just against god even
[25:53] getting up in the morning you're against
[25:55] god because we're not going to go to
[25:56] sleep over there
[25:57] you're just thinking it's god
[25:59] does everybody understand that i don't
[26:00] care whether you believe it or not but
[26:01] do you understand what i'm saying you're
[26:03] always against god
[26:06] but now we can start though there's an
[26:08] entrance been made a door has been
[26:09] opened that we can take this divine
[26:11] nature
[26:13] and get rid of that
[26:15] i'm not saying we're yeah we'll have
[26:17] this thing until we die or be changed
[26:20] but it's going to be changed
[26:22] right brother brown said the greatest
[26:24] battle ever fought is not in here it's
[26:26] right here
[26:27] right here now if y'all don't agree with
[26:29] that you're
[26:30] you're lost
[26:32] if you don't agree that this right here
[26:34] is against god you're just you're just
[26:35] kidding yourself
[26:37] because when i knew when god came to me
[26:39] when you same way with everybody when
[26:40] god come to you
[26:42] you were so anti that's right until you
[26:45] didn't want god
[26:47] we weren't seeking god god was seeking
[26:51] so you weren't trying to press your way
[26:54] into god no you weren't
[26:56] now god did little things in your life
[26:59] to show you where you need to go but
[27:01] there come a point in time when god's
[27:03] going to go
[27:03] thunk
[27:04] i'm talking to you
[27:07] it's me
[27:08] yes i'm talking to you now
[27:11] and then what do you do god knew you
[27:13] would accept it or reject it there's
[27:15] your predestination he knew you would
[27:17] come to a point yes lord and he would
[27:20] say one word from the pulpit or one word
[27:22] from somebody testifying to you and
[27:24] you'd go
[27:25] oh i'm so wrong
[27:28] i'm so wrong everything i do is so wrong
[27:30] to god right
[27:31] that's not the way you started that's
[27:33] the way everybody should have started
[27:34] you know we all start with different
[27:36] experiences but it's always the same
[27:39] it's always
[27:40] i'm wrong
[27:42] what's repent repent means to turn
[27:45] around because i'm wrong
[27:47] and i need to go that way all right
[27:50] go ahead i remember when i got mine i
[27:53] was on my way i had listened to tate
[27:55] that night and i was on my way to work
[27:57] and i was facing the world trade villain
[27:59] and i walked across the street and it
[28:01] came to me
[28:02] god chose me i felt so good all that
[28:05] time i was thinking i chose god and when
[28:07] i mean it was just a revelation i went
[28:09] down the elevator i said god show me and
[28:11] when i find out that god told me
[28:13] thank you
[28:17] but god knows that that's the reaction
[28:20] we as humans
[28:22] how much more would it be that we know
[28:24] that this infinite man
[28:27] has chose you from seven billion people
[28:29] that's right
[28:30] and he come and found you that's right
[28:33] that gives me cold chills
[28:36] he come and found you
[28:38] you didn't go find god
[28:40] there's not one human thing you can do
[28:43] to find out
[28:45] not one
[28:46] but he found here and he knew though he
[28:48] knew those sister journey when you that
[28:50] was revealed to you you'd accept it yeah
[28:52] well then right then what did brother
[28:54] brown say about the the brother that
[28:55] said well brother graham i don't know if
[28:56] i'm born again or not
[28:59] he said when you pick that track up
[29:02] boy how simple is that
[29:04] when you pick that track up
[29:06] and turn from whatever way you were
[29:08] doing you accepted that
[29:10] what was on the track just a little
[29:12] simple probably john 3 16. when you
[29:14] accepted that
[29:16] that's when you turned and you received
[29:18] god
[29:20] didn't understand that
[29:21] but is that the baptism of the no no
[29:23] wait a minute
[29:26] that's the same thing when he was saying
[29:29] you know the man said he lost god and he
[29:31] didn't go back where he found him right
[29:32] right and laid me down to sleep right
[29:34] now i'm sleeping
[29:36] just free
[29:37] go ahead but when when brother man was
[29:39] given an illustration
[29:41] and he and that's where he said that's
[29:43] not the baptism of the holy ghost well
[29:44] that's his journey that's where he begun
[29:47] but you got to remember one thing if
[29:49] you're truly justified
[29:52] let me make it real let me be this kind
[29:54] of a gray area but let me if you're
[29:56] truly justified right
[29:59] now you're justified
[30:00] god forgives you your past sins you're
[30:03] not born again in the family of god but
[30:05] if you're truly justified the bible said
[30:07] you're already glorified correct you
[30:08] will go on you will go on you have begun
[30:11] here and you will end here god saw if
[30:13] it's a true justification
[30:16] if it's truly that you were going in
[30:18] this direction and god turned you
[30:20] started going in that direction but 15
[30:22] years later
[30:24] you turn around and go back in that
[30:25] direction you never got it to start with
[30:27] you just gotta you just got a feeling
[30:31] and the devil loves to give you feelings
[30:34] he loves to give you feelings but if god
[30:36] truly justifies you then he's already
[30:38] glorified you
[30:40] okay so that was his journey so we can
[30:43] say that's why brother brown said you
[30:44] can come up to the altar except jesus
[30:46] christ is your savior and you're a
[30:47] christian that doesn't mean you're born
[30:49] again
[30:51] that's right come on that doesn't mean
[30:52] you're born again that just means you're
[30:54] justified that means that right then if
[30:56] you died you'll go to heaven but you'll
[30:58] not be bribed because bride is only the
[31:00] ones that the holy ghost has come inside
[31:02] and you've accepted him
[31:04] in your walk that's right of
[31:06] justification sanctification about the
[31:08] holy ghost you've accepted that and
[31:09] you've walked in god
[31:10] he's showing you the word but if you go
[31:12] up um
[31:14] say
[31:15] no i'm gonna kill you okay nala is going
[31:17] to go up today and she's going to repent
[31:19] of her sins and she's really sorrowful
[31:21] but she gets killed in a car right going
[31:22] down the road god forbid that's going to
[31:24] happen we know it's not but if it does
[31:26] then then we can't say she's not a
[31:28] christian that's right no in god's eyes
[31:31] she's been forgiven chopped off
[31:36] that's what that is it chopped off
[31:37] everything from there back so where you
[31:39] stand completing god in the position
[31:42] you're supposed to be in
[31:43] completing god now if she continues on
[31:46] another five years and she's still doing
[31:48] what she was doing back here
[31:51] she just got a feeling
[31:53] she just got a
[31:54] a a religion an emotion
[31:58] but if you truly repent
[32:02] god's going to give you the holy ghost
[32:04] remember repent
[32:06] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[32:08] christ for remission your sins and you
[32:10] shall
[32:11] receive the gift of the holy shout which
[32:13] means it don't have to happen right then
[32:14] but it shall i didn't receive it when i
[32:16] first was baptized yes
[32:19] it took a little while
[32:20] but i sure felt clean when i came out of
[32:22] that water i sure felt god had
[32:24] took everything that i was before and
[32:26] thrown it in the sea and he can't bring
[32:28] that up no more
[32:29] but see remember if we continue to go to
[32:31] walking justification that same unclean
[32:34] spirit that made us do it it's still
[32:35] right here
[32:36] you may still smoke a cigarette that's
[32:38] true
[32:40] you may still drink a beer that's right
[32:42] right but there's going to come a time
[32:44] of sanctification where that's got to go
[32:46] out that's right the unclean spirit then
[32:49] will go out of a man
[32:51] right
[32:52] he walks in dry places he can rest find
[32:54] us none but he's going to come back
[32:57] and he's going to make you very
[32:58] religious
[32:59] all right so that's very you got to be
[33:01] careful with that that's the
[33:03] the sanctification part is a is a tough
[33:05] part to be in because remember judas is
[33:07] carrot
[33:09] was in the stage of sanctification
[33:11] he cast out devils he preached the
[33:14] gospel
[33:16] he did
[33:18] and he was sanctified
[33:19] but he never went on to receive
[33:22] you know what he did he did not believe
[33:25] what christ was saying
[33:27] all the way
[33:28] he believed part of what he was saying
[33:30] all right
[33:32] and that put him
[33:34] not in the body so he was able to do
[33:36] what he did he was able to deny god
[33:39] and
[33:40] become forever judas
[33:42] juditarian
[33:44] attitude that helped me you want to look
[33:47] at it yeah that really helped me
[33:51] which one do i need to count down the
[33:53] highlighted one okay
[33:55] countdown and the new birth as people
[33:57] talks that the baptism and holy ghost is
[33:58] in your birth now that's wrong
[34:02] the baptism of the holy ghost is
[34:03] different from the new birth the new
[34:04] birth is when you're born again but the
[34:06] holy ghost is when power comes into that
[34:08] birth for service now remember it's not
[34:10] totally two different acts it's the same
[34:12] act
[34:13] just showing you because you can have
[34:15] the baptism of the holy ghost every day
[34:17] of your life on your spirit and die and
[34:18] go to hell all right everybody else that
[34:21] would give you the anointing to cast out
[34:22] devils preach the gospel heal the sick
[34:25] right right and still be just as smutty
[34:28] inside as you always have been
[34:30] all right that's hard to understand but
[34:32] you got to remember joel said that the
[34:34] anointing
[34:35] that he says i'll pour out the holy
[34:37] ghost on all flesh
[34:39] in the end time it's on all flesh
[34:40] everybody
[34:41] that's why you get these people with
[34:43] anointings to do the things they do
[34:46] write songs which are evil but that's an
[34:49] anointing it's an anointing to do that
[34:50] the new birth you have the new birth by
[34:52] being believing on the lord jesus christ
[34:54] by having faith and accepting him as
[34:56] your savior that's birth see because you
[34:58] pass from death into life
[35:00] he hears my word and believe it see he's
[35:02] got life because he believes and that
[35:05] same group had to go to pentecost to be
[35:07] baptized with the holy ghost see what
[35:09] he's saying he's saying they had to go
[35:10] on further right all right
[35:12] holy ghost is power for service
[35:14] all right you shall receive the new
[35:16] birth after this what now you shall
[35:18] receive power acts 1 8 after this holy
[35:20] ghost has come upon you and they had
[35:22] already believed to eternal life and so
[35:24] forth but they had to have the holy
[35:25] ghost for power
[35:27] you shall be witness unto me after the
[35:28] holy ghost come upon you because the
[35:30] holy ghost is the witness of the
[35:31] resurrection showing that you have
[35:32] become
[35:33] an adult
[35:35] in christ
[35:36] not a newborn baby but an adult all
[35:38] right
[35:40] so
[35:40] brother brown and that's where a lot of
[35:42] people say well brother brown says the
[35:43] new birthing holy ghost is different
[35:44] well there's a quote
[35:45] but you got to remember he's separating
[35:47] it
[35:48] it's the same act right if you're born
[35:50] again then something died
[35:52] right
[35:53] something died that's right but then
[35:55] brother branham
[35:57] clearly shows you that the holy ghost
[35:59] comes with power
[36:01] because in the upper room in the upper
[36:03] room they didn't just get eternal life
[36:04] and then get the holy ghost they got it
[36:06] all right they got all and they were
[36:08] adults in christ that's what he was
[36:10] reading acts 180 what that's acts 1 8.
[36:13] jesus said when the holy ghost come upon
[36:14] you it'd be well acts 2 38 when all that
[36:17] happened or acts 2 1.
[36:18] so they've become babies and you got to
[36:20] remember brother branham is talking
[36:22] about two different groups of people
[36:25] right
[36:26] we gotta go
[36:27] we're right in the middle of something
[36:30] but remember the holy ghost fell the
[36:32] holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost
[36:34] on two different sets of people
[36:36] the ones in the upper room had been
[36:38] tutored by god himself and that fell on
[36:41] the word they held the three thousand
[36:43] downstairs just became babies right here
[36:46] same holy ghost
[36:47] but they started as babies
[36:49] okay okay
[36:52] we'll get into this
