[0:09] hello amen God bless you Saints it's
[0:12] good to be in the house of the Lord
[0:15] happy to have family from across the
[0:17] country with us today so glad they're
[0:20] here amen let's turn to uh if you have
[0:23] your Bibles let's turn to 1 Timothy
[0:25] chapter
[0:28] 4
[0:40] all right let's let's uh bow our heads
[0:43] dear father Lord we thank you for this
[0:44] morning Lord thank you for this
[0:46] opportunity Lord when we walk in these
[0:48] doors just to commune with you and learn
[0:50] more about you Lord that you edify our
[0:53] souls and just touch us Lord in our
[0:55] personal lives and and where we need
[0:57] guidance Lord and where we need healing
[0:59] and help just pray for all the
[1:01] afflictions of the Saints Lord and all
[1:03] the the members of the body Lord who are
[1:04] struggling Lord just give them strength
[1:06] and give us strength here Lord to listen
[1:08] to what you have to say and that we take
[1:10] these words in and we really put them
[1:11] into our lives Lord just pray that
[1:13] everything that you said will be
[1:14] edifying just forgive us of all things
[1:16] Lord move us out the way as we come here
[1:18] to worship you in your person name of
[1:19] Jesus Christ I pray
[1:22] amen amen so 1 Timothy
[1:26] 4 now the spirit speaketh expressly that
[1:29] in the latter times some shall depart
[1:32] from the faith giving heed to seducing
[1:35] spirits and doctrines of devils speaking
[1:37] lies and hypocrisy having their
[1:40] conscience seared with a hot iron
[1:42] forbidding to marry and commanding to
[1:45] abstain from Meats which God hath
[1:47] created to be received with Thanksgiving
[1:49] of them which believes and know the
[1:52] truth so here Paul is talking
[1:55] about you know he's realizing the need
[1:58] for for guidance in the church the need
[2:00] for you know people to have a he he's
[2:03] writing this to Timothy and talking
[2:04] about the need need of for guidance in
[2:05] the church and that Timothy you know
[2:08] he's seeing the issues and he's seeing
[2:10] you know what can happen when people you
[2:11] know don't follow the word and they
[2:13] don't they don't follow it closely and
[2:15] then they they go off so he's saying
[2:17] those these seducing Spirits these
[2:18] doctrines of devils and all these things
[2:20] the lies and
[2:21] hypocrisy and and you even see you know
[2:24] he pointing out doctrines that still
[2:26] exist today when he says you know
[2:27] forbidding forbidding to marry
[2:30] and those things and uh forbidding
[2:33] commanding not to eat meat and all those
[2:34] things and even we know today there's
[2:36] that uh the Catholic idea that you get
[2:38] married to the church and know priest
[2:40] can't get married and we see what the
[2:42] result of that is is that you know the
[2:43] wrongful desire that was in them wasn't
[2:45] cleansed out by God they were just
[2:47] trying to repress it through the the
[2:49] orders of the church and the orders of
[2:50] this and making things up that weren't
[2:52] in the Bible so you can't just repress
[2:54] things you have to let God cleanse those
[2:55] things out of you it's not a repression
[2:57] because when you repress things they
[2:59] actually come back back worse so it's
[3:01] not just that you know we just try
[3:02] really hard to do what we're supposed to
[3:04] do but we need to just let God cleanse
[3:06] those things out of us and and not be
[3:08] you know wooed by these these wrongful
[3:11] spirits and these wrong doctrines and
[3:13] and that's what Paul is seeing in the
[3:15] church and verse four every
[3:19] creature of God is good and nothing to
[3:22] be refused if it be received with
[3:25] Thanksgiving for it is Sanctified by the
[3:27] word of God and prayer if thou put the
[3:29] brethren in remembrance of these things
[3:32] Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus
[3:34] Christ nourished up in the words of
[3:36] faith and of good Dr Doctrine whereinto
[3:39] thou Hast
[3:43] attained so this is for all of us to be
[3:46] good ministers I love that scripture
[3:47] that brother Brandon teaches on where
[3:49] it's you know we has made us Kings and
[3:51] Priests so it's not just that you know
[3:53] we come here and then we we you know
[3:55] listen to a pre preacher or Minister and
[3:56] then we go home and we do what we want
[3:58] but we have to live the life as well we
[3:59] have to also read we have to study
[4:01] ourselves and it's not that you know
[4:03] well the minister does this and The
[4:04] Minister's Wife does that but we're all
[4:06] Kings and Priests we're all priests and
[4:08] we're all supposed to you know do what
[4:09] we're supposed to
[4:10] do in verse S but refuse profane and old
[4:16] wives tales fables and exercise thyself
[4:18] rather unto godliness for bodily
[4:20] exercise profiteth little but godliness
[4:22] is profitable unto all things and having
[4:24] promise of the life that now is and of
[4:28] that which is to come this is a faithful
[4:30] saying and worthy of all
[4:33] acceptation for therefore we both labor
[4:36] and suffer reproach because we trust in
[4:38] the Living God who is the savior of all
[4:40] men especially of those that believe now
[4:42] he's saying that bodily exercise profit
[4:44] little but there's many things that you
[4:45] know that that can be beneficial to us
[4:47] that might profit a little you know you
[4:49] can be a good businessman you can make
[4:50] some money but it it might profit but it
[4:52] would profit little and there's things
[4:54] you can do you can be a good person you
[4:55] can try and be a good neighbor but it
[4:57] profits little if you're not a seeking
[4:59] to Godliness if you're not exercising
[5:01] you know unto godliness and that's what
[5:03] we want to exercise on that's what we
[5:04] want to work towards in our daily lives
[5:06] not just you know to be upstanding
[5:08] citizen or upstanding person of the
[5:10] community but to be to exercise
[5:12] godliness and to following the footsteps
[5:14] of Jesus
[5:18] Christ and verse 11 these things command
[5:20] and teach let no man despise thy youth
[5:24] now that is a scripture that a lot of
[5:26] people stop there you they say let no
[5:29] man despise thy Youth and you can't
[5:31] judge the young people you can't say
[5:32] anything to us but you know no man
[5:35] despise thy youth but the scripture
[5:36] doesn't stop
[5:37] there
[5:39] so let no man despise thy youth but be
[5:43] thou an example of the Believers in word
[5:45] and conversation in charity in spirit in
[5:49] faith in Purity so it's not just that
[5:53] you know we we shouldn't let people
[5:56] despise our youth but it's also that we
[5:58] don't give them a reason to
[6:00] you know the way same way they tried to
[6:02] F find fault with Daniel they saw Daniel
[6:04] and they couldn't find fault with him so
[6:06] they actually had to change the rules in
[6:08] order to find fault with them so you
[6:10] know even as young people or just as
[6:11] Believers you know when we see other
[6:13] people looking at our lives and looking
[6:15] at how we live we want to always be you
[6:18] know living accordingly so that we don't
[6:20] get caught off guard we don't get caught
[6:22] you know in the wrong place in the wrong
[6:23] situation but we want to be living Our
[6:24] Lives accordingly we want to be examples
[6:26] in the church examples in all things so
[6:30] that you know when when it's our time to
[6:31] be be called when it's our time to be
[6:33] used by God that we're we're where we're
[6:34] supposed to
[6:36] be amen so and I'm sure we all want that
[6:40] for our young people it' be examples in
[6:41] the church and and and and Paul is
[6:43] telling this to Timothy who's maybe he
[6:45] doesn't want to overstep boundaries and
[6:47] maybe he's you know there's there's a
[6:49] lot of leadership and eldership in the
[6:50] church and he's wondering like you know
[6:52] maybe I'm not even like old enough to do
[6:54] this or whatever he's thinking but Paul
[6:56] is saying no you have a gift and you
[6:58] need to use that gift and regardless of
[7:01] you know your age you know God doesn't
[7:02] work by age he doesn't work by money he
[7:04] doesn't work by height he doesn't work
[7:06] by any of those things but he works by
[7:08] you know exercising yourself under
[7:09] godliness and if you're surrendering
[7:12] yourself and that's the type of you know
[7:15] leadership and and that we want to see
[7:17] in everyone as well as the young
[7:21] people
[7:25] amen and verse 13 till I come give it
[7:29] tendance to reading to exhortation to
[7:31] Doctrine neglect not the gift that is in
[7:34] thee which was given thee by Prophecy
[7:36] with the laying on of hands of the
[7:38] presbyter meditate upon these things
[7:40] give thyself holy to
[7:43] them that thy profiting may appear to
[7:45] all take heed unto thyself and unto the
[7:48] doctrine continue in them for in doing
[7:51] this Thou shalt both save thyself and
[7:54] them and them that hear thee
[7:57] so and and that's a big part part of the
[7:59] Christian experience is that we do these
[8:00] things for ourselves for the edifying of
[8:02] ourselves but also to edify those around
[8:04] us and to help those around
[8:06] us
[8:09] and you see a lot of
[8:12] um a lot of things going around
[8:15] sometimes in the message
[8:17] and you know it's sometimes people just
[8:20] need uh good leadership and good
[8:22] examples in the church but there's also
[8:24] things where that we want our young
[8:26] people to do well and to succeed there's
[8:28] also things that our young people can't
[8:30] control and I remember I was talking to
[8:33] a friend and they asked me you know and
[8:35] there was youth camps going on and
[8:37] there's always you know some Youth Camp
[8:38] going on and and you know think it was
[8:40] are good and people can get experiences
[8:41] there but he was asking me you know what
[8:45] do you think the young people need the
[8:47] most and I thought about it and I
[8:49] thought you know I think what the young
[8:50] people need the most is surrendered
[8:53] parents and I think that's
[8:58] really
[9:00] Hallelujah cuz they can go to youth
[9:01] camps they can go to meetings they can
[9:03] go to all these places but if they come
[9:05] home in that Christian environment isn't
[9:07] there you know it's it's much harder to
[9:09] succeed it's much harder to to get
[9:10] through you know of course nothing is
[9:12] too hard for God so there's I really
[9:14] pray for young people who go to meetings
[9:15] and they they don't have believing
[9:17] parents and it's it's really hard for
[9:19] them to to stay on the right path but
[9:21] you know it's it's always a blessing if
[9:23] to have Godly Parents if young people if
[9:25] you have Godly Parents and and parents
[9:26] if you're setting that atmosphere for
[9:28] your children to to receive something
[9:31] you
[9:34] know and you know we see these issues
[9:36] with you know people always talk about
[9:38] the generation and the schools and and
[9:40] how kids are always struggling growing
[9:41] up and every generation has its issues
[9:43] but of course we know everything starts
[9:45] in the home and even brother Brandon was
[9:47] talking about how it's not always the
[9:49] children but sometimes it's the parents
[9:51] who are not you know teaching them right
[9:52] and raising them the right way and doing
[9:53] these things and they'll they'll stray
[9:55] off and do these things because there's
[9:56] not a Christian you know guid guidance
[9:58] and Leadership at
[10:05] home and that's why I love when brother
[10:09] Dale talks about how um we all need to
[10:11] when we dedicate a child we dedicate
[10:13] ourselves to live in front of them you
[10:15] know we need to be examples of the word
[10:17] examples of those
[10:19] things and you know I've talked to many
[10:22] people I have many friends who are in
[10:24] the message some who aren't you know
[10:25] some who were and they left and and you
[10:28] know the ones who left they always see
[10:30] it as like you know just rules they see
[10:31] it as rules they don't see the love and
[10:33] I
[10:34] wonder you know if maybe no one ever got
[10:36] to them no one ever showed them that it
[10:37] was the love of God and it was it was
[10:39] that you do these things because you
[10:40] love God and because of the goodness
[10:41] that he's done and that you know it's
[10:44] it's and I noticed this with the people
[10:46] who stay is that they see God in their
[10:49] parents and that's where they see him
[10:50] first you know it's going to be hard for
[10:52] your child to deny God if they're being
[10:54] raised by God in flesh and you so it's
[10:57] going to be hard for them to deny what
[10:59] what's right in front of them what
[10:59] they've been raised by what they're
[11:01] seeing right in front of them when they
[11:02] see that spirit and when they see you
[11:04] come home and they see you worship and
[11:05] there's a tape playing in the background
[11:07] and and you're singing to the lord it's
[11:09] those different things and and the main
[11:11] reason I can say that is because I know
[11:14] that the number one thing outside of God
[11:15] himself is the reason I'm here is
[11:17] because I had a Godly mother and she
[11:19] showed
[11:24] me it was her setting an example for me
[11:26] and her adhering to the word and not
[11:29] just you know going to church on Sundays
[11:31] but but Wednesdays you know listening on
[11:33] Wednesday and listening to tapes
[11:34] throughout the week and singing through
[11:35] the house and all these different things
[11:37] and that environment needs to be set you
[11:39] know and my mom doesn't know what I'm
[11:41] going to say when I come up here
[11:44] so so pray for
[11:46] her but um you know and and she might
[11:49] not even believe I'm going to say this
[11:51] but I'm in the Pulpit so I'm not going
[11:53] to
[11:55] lie but but I know that if I could go
[12:00] back in time and control who was going
[12:01] to raise me I would pick her because I
[12:04] know that she has a real experience I
[12:05] don't know what anyone else does at
[12:07] their house or what what goes on but I
[12:09] know that my mother has a real
[12:10] experience and that I know that real
[12:11] experience led me to Christ and I
[12:13] believe it will lead me to Christ again
[12:15] if I had to go
[12:17] back amen right and I think that is
[12:21] essential for the for the young
[12:23] people and I'm I'm just speaking from my
[12:25] own experience you know but I remember
[12:28] there was uh you know your family who
[12:31] doesn't believe this they they can get
[12:33] critical sometimes and I remember there
[12:35] was a
[12:36] conversation where you know it's like oh
[12:38] milka doesn't let those boys do anything
[12:39] they just go to church and back and I
[12:41] was I thought that's the worst thing she
[12:43] ever did that was I think that's pretty
[12:47] [Applause]
[12:52] good and and like I said you can't you
[12:54] can't deny God when you see him when you
[12:56] see him living in someone and if the
[12:58] brothers can pull up that quote from uh
[13:00] doors and
[13:02] doors that I gave
[13:06] him and brother Brenham talks about you
[13:08] know letting the Lord in your
[13:10] heart and he says but what but what then
[13:14] when Jesus comes into the heart many
[13:15] people accept him because they don't
[13:17] want to go to hell but when Jesus comes
[13:19] into your heart he wants to be Lord not
[13:20] just savior but Lord also Lord is
[13:23] rulership he comes in to take
[13:26] over now you say is that right brother
[13:28] Brandon sure what if I invited you at my
[13:31] house and you come in the door and
[13:33] knocked on the door and when I looked
[13:34] inside you said yes come on in if you
[13:36] can help me well you do so but now when
[13:40] you come in now I don't want you
[13:41] meddling around in my house you stand
[13:43] right there at the
[13:44] door remember our text is doors inside
[13:47] door
[13:49] now inside the human heart there's many
[13:51] little doors and them little doors
[13:53] covers up a lot of things just to let
[13:55] him in that isn't all of it when he
[13:57] comes in
[13:59] when I come in your house if you're
[14:00] welcome me at the door why you'd say
[14:02] come in brother brandom I'm so glad to
[14:04] see you I'd say well it's a privilege
[14:06] for me to come into your house oh won't
[14:08] you come over and sit down brother
[14:10] brandom go through our house make
[14:11] yourself at home oh my I'd go over to
[14:14] the refrigerator get me one of those
[14:15] great big sandwiches about like that
[14:17] take off my shoes and go in the bedroom
[14:19] and I lay down and I just have a a real
[14:21] gastronomical
[14:24] Jubilee so it's it's just letting the
[14:27] Lord in your heart and letting him be
[14:28] your ruler ERS ship and not just you
[14:29] know being scared cuz if there's one
[14:31] thing if anyone's going to know about
[14:33] your experience it's going to be your
[14:34] kids you're not going to hide anything
[14:36] from your kids you can come here and and
[14:38] pretend to us and you can pretend at
[14:39] work and you can pretend but at home
[14:41] they're going to know and that's why you
[14:42] invite company over and they start
[14:44] saying things you don't want him to
[14:45] say because that's the life you're
[14:47] living so sometimes that
[14:49] happens but you know
[14:54] we they need they need that that's why
[14:56] it's so important I was even talking to
[14:58] my uh Sunday school kids last week about
[15:01] how you know you being an
[15:04] example and you letting the Lord in your
[15:06] heart is going to what's what's going to
[15:07] edify the Saints you know there's
[15:08] there's we can say oh Lord don't hinder
[15:11] anything because of what I've done or
[15:12] what I what I'm doing or my life but
[15:14] really you just need to get that cleaned
[15:15] out of you so then there's no there's no
[15:16] issue to there to begin with there's
[15:18] nothing to hinder in the first place so
[15:21] once that's out and then you can you can
[15:23] be a true example to
[15:25] others and you know one of the
[15:29] um I don't I don't want to come off as
[15:31] too critical to parents but it's it's a
[15:33] it's a very important job it's a very
[15:35] crucial job and and one thing about it
[15:38] is that you know for our own personal
[15:40] experience when we purify ourselves it's
[15:43] only by the blood of God that we purify
[15:45] ourselves that we were saved that we
[15:47] come through these things and we we
[15:49] throw away our past life and we we
[15:51] accept him and we become an
[15:52] instrumentality of God and we fully
[15:54] Embrace him and make him Lord and
[15:56] rulership of our life we let him in
[15:57] those doors we let him in the house we
[16:00] we let him just put his feet up we let
[16:02] him go wherever he wants there's no door
[16:04] that's locked off there's no door that
[16:06] you know brother Randon talks about the
[16:08] door of Pride and your private life and
[16:09] the sermon and all these different
[16:11] things where there's a door that you
[16:12] kind of you know God you can come in
[16:14] here but oh this this little door right
[16:16] here that's where all the bad stuff is
[16:17] so I'm going to lock that door off but
[16:19] and like brother B said he's not going
[16:20] to break in he's not going to try and
[16:22] push his way in it's going to be you
[16:24] have to let him in because he's a
[16:25] gentleman but it's also that when when
[16:28] when we had faults and failures and
[16:30] parents in your own lives and own
[16:31] mistakes when you had uh you know sin
[16:34] and it was by the blood it was cleansed
[16:36] so even if sometimes you make a mistake
[16:38] as a parent you know that that can cover
[16:40] by the blood too there's nothing too
[16:41] hard for God there's nothing that he
[16:43] can't fix and and amend there's nothing
[16:45] that's too broken for God
[16:48] so just understand and trust that God is
[16:51] is working and and and if your child's
[16:53] not here then they'll be here amen
[16:56] because that's covered by the blood too
[16:58] so all your mistakes that God covered
[17:01] when you got saved those same mistakes
[17:02] will be covered as a parent and those
[17:04] same mistakes will be covered if you
[17:05] claim the blood and you watch your
[17:07] children walk in here amen God bless
[17:10] [Applause]
[17:20] you
