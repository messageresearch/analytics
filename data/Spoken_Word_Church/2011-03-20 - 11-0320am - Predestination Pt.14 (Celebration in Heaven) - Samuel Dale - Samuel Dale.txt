========================================

so you know you you say well BL God I'll just go well you get sick one of these days I'll come and barding you all day long just to get eaten with you okay but no that's you shouldn't be uh you know there are concerns of the patient is more than anything else is to try to help someone to to be able to get knitted back together so try to abide by these things and limit your visitations like she said about 30 minutes CU Brother Dean likes to talk about the Lord and and that's good but uh he needs his rest right now so remember that just remember the other sick ones Among Us brother Tom and all these other brothers and Brother Don and brother George and all and sister Thomas so remember these and just pray that the Lord would would lead each one Rebecca sick this morning so remember her amen father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for Lord giving us an opportunity that we can come to you and we can pour out our petitions and believe that you you Lord will speak to each one of our hearts and lives and you'll give us Lord of your understanding because that's we desire what we desire thank you for the healing atonement of Calvary and we ask you to just bless these that are sick and just be with each one that we may all walk together in you forgive our sins lead us by thine understanding hand and keep us Lord and as we read your word you come and you speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen Ephesians 1 we've been reading verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now remember he chose us that's it all right so just keep that in mind cuz that's what we're still on all right having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved and whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he ha purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him now keep that in mind is to be gathered in him to be gathered into one amen now this is a many membered body of Christ but remember we're one all right keep that in mind and then it will help us to understand in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ now let's go back and we'll read from John verse chapter 14 we'll begin reading verse 16 and I will pray the father and he shall give you a another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live ye shall live also at that day now the prophet said that's this day okay so at this day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word as always say we can look back and we can see and say well I believe that he was in the father okay I'm put it in back the paper will be laying in the back back there wait it to for you to do because people will be getting them and you make sure and get it to be right there where the priority Quest or things is at all right but as I said now it's easy to be able to in this day to comprehend and believing in one true and living God that we can say that I in my father all right and then the it's easy to say it I in you because you know by the new birth it can be I in you all right we see he was in the father then we can see now he's dwelling in us but what about ye in me ye in me now that's uh a little different to what we we think about you know what we're trying to consider but we've been on the word predestination and you know trying to cover uh some things of predestination and uh seeing that we've come down this is about the 12th message then we've come down to begin to talk about a possibility or a probability of us having existence before the world all right and uh we say oh no we didn't we didn't exist we W this that well there's a lot in the Bible and a lot in the prophet's message it talks about it so by that we can uh go back and see those things but now remember one thing please we are not talking about bodies you know human being bodies mortal beings now that's a Mormon Doctrine of pre-existence that's right all right and we don't believe in that we don't believe in the existence of human beings before the world right all right now and in being that then we don't believe in uh perverted bodies perverted Spirits perverted Souls Lost you know Etc we don't believe that was back there before the world see and that's what everybody wants to go to because you watch their doctrines and and I've watched this closely over the years of of the the time being in the message and you get all of these seed doctrines and and ideas and and two souls and and all of the different things like that and and it'll always lead right out into where the F the um beginner of that message or whatever winds up into uh some form of polygamy that's right or or adultery you know or whatever then you can see that man is looking back at his flesh and trying to make something out of that that's right yep and uh you can do all you want to you can go down and you can get that face lift and Tommy tucked and and everything build up and do all you want to and I'm not saying nothing about it I'm just saying my point you can do every B of that and you can take your little peel bottles and claim you're all Soul filled as you did when you was 20 and you can talk all you want to but you're just looking in the mirror messing things up you know just go ahead and say hey I'm getting old and I'm enjoying this it's what I told him last night about at the fellowship meeting I was talking to this brother outside and he said you know he said I had seen you which we didn't we were missing the the last couple of Fellowship meetings you know one because we were out in in Kansas preaching and one because of the snow and things so the brother said I I haven't seen you in a long time I said yeah that's right brother we need to start seeing each other more I said because you know the older we're all getting is we're getting to where we can't remember who people are and I said first is you can't remember who other people are then you get where you can't remember who you are you know and all like that so you can do all you want to to take your younger and live out of your peel bottles and do what You' p and and take all of your herbal tonics and all that's good amen right but just remember you're getting older that's right you're going back to the ground that you come from so don't never think that this body here will will touch just a man thing today of when we're talking about it on the body and and you know just kind of drop it in and leave it for later on and all because in the word redeem now I gave you these Wednesday but I gave them back today to where we could look at it and uh the word redeem see it means that to be brought back all right it means to bring back yep all right it means to be brought back from where you once was right all right now I'm reading what brother Brandman say scanning down over the things and you've got them 1 2 3 4 uh of your notes it means to go back to redeem anything is to bring it back to its original place all right so now if we're looking at a human mortal and things like that we're to have enough common sense as I was trying to express to be able to realize that these bodies are not Eternal right all right so then we're trying our best to get it to a place to where not as everybody keeps saying you know I'm going to get me a new body and then the people this message see they kind of leave it dangling because they'll say we're going to get a new body but then you question them and they'll run backwards because they don't want to really Express what they're meaning by it and see you know you say well brother I believe in this body here being made new and oh yeah that's what I'm talking about well I don't think that's what they're talking about before then but that's all right that's their business but I don't believe that your body was ever Eternal right right see now we'll show where was at when the prophet covers it in a little while in the message you know but that body is not Eternal but one day we'll be made Eternal because we're not going to get a new body it's this body made new or made Eternal am right all right see then that way you know it will catch up with us at a time all right see then I don't believe that your spirit part of you or that Satan can tempt and work with us and do things like that I I don't believe that's Eternal right you know and and I believe it's still in a condition of God working on it but it's not Eternal right now but see the Soul by the new birth is eternal amen all right now in that then we can talk about redeemed then but not talk about redeem in the the bases of the body and not talk talk about redeem in the bases of our spirit right part but we can talk about redeem in the bases of the Soul right all right because now that way we can see it better and uh that's what we were trying to get across our Wednesday of how that the word redeem it means to go back see to where you come from right all right now so then as far as our body IES can go we'll read it in a minute the prophet said they was in this world y That's Right CU I I tried to tell you that and tried to prove it over and over throughout many many messages where the Prophet we even put a couple there where he had the question you know if you have eternal life right the eternal life you have always was eternal am but there was a time we didn't have that and see this plain common this one little simple illustration should make every one of us consider if if brother brandom is saying that we came into the world with eternal life well he said it I believe that you know right but he he's always saying in the same message the future home where he said you come into the world with eternal life you always was eternal you wouldn't saved on no certain day he uses that statement if you have eternal life that's right you always was eternal all right now because if you have eternal life now then why do you talk about Redemption right what's the purpose amen right you know amen and you would have an eternal sinner right see but everybody wants to to do something with a seed you know well well that's all right because we've been through it and through it the prophet covers about being born with a seed in you but then he covers that as being what your representation of predes from predestination or to predestination right or far whatever you know it's it's not something that you said but I come into the world with this little spot in me what are you trying to say right you're doing away with salvation just shoot the people everybody goes to heaven y that's what I told him with the two Souls that's what I told the people that was teaching the two Souls that's 40 years ago I said all we need to do is do like the Church of Christ man said you baptized people I told him I've told you before I talked to one I said I'll meet you on Lake ler we'll fill up the kingdom is Sunday if all it takes is water baptism right we'll just go out to there and everybody that's there don't matter they got bikinis what they got we just put them in the water well he well you know I said of course we're going to do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ oh no it's Father Son and Holy Ghost I said you Church of Christ get you baptized correctly right but you see we try to put something there and that's what I told the two so people I said if you was born with eternal life and the devil in there together my Bible says God won't dwell in an unclean vessel I said where you at right I said all we need to do is just kill the person well they didn't like that right you they didn't like the ideas that I had a lot of people don't like the ideas I've got you know you said well we got laws for this I I've told you what I believe some man goes out and rapes a young girl or or a baby or something like that just casorate the sucker you'll take care of the rest of his life put him in jail and leave him there that's right people don't like that but that's plain language and they don't like for you to talk like that but it's true and I believe in the gospel like brother said last night it's about time to start doing things you know I think it is it's about time to say it like it is and forget it you know people don't like it don't worry about it they ain't going to educate me none and they ain't going to pay me nothing no ain't going to worry about it but you see I believe in being able to redeem back to where you came from right amen right but if you redeem too far you're going to redeem yourself out of existence and that was not the plan God's plan was to have children that's right his offspring y but he was going to bring them in a basis to where that he could display himself and I'll get to it more this evening he could display himself as a father amen you know if he was a father we we l real good on the Healer part right that he's a Healer savior Etc but what about laying the emphasis on that he's a father well if he's a father he's got have children am that's right does that need a big light book turned on you know right does that mean something I got to do something to make you really think about it a father means he's what he got children right me and my wife got married I wasn't a father I was just a husband you took my wife to bring in to the point of being a father well see it actually the way God wanted to be a father it took the fall right to bring it into condition right that he could be the the father he wanted to be right he created Adam as we covered the other day sure gave him eternal life in his soul right but his body and his Spirit wasn't Eternal that's right but he was looking at something that he was wanting to take place in the whole human race but still of that we sin in my pasty but see then if we can see the part of redeem then I'm like this you say but but you're walking on thin eyes Brother D to walk back and do the way you do or you know as long as I can say what the Bible says and what the prophet says I don't worry about the thin I right I'd he rather be out on the thin I and be standing on the bank saying we can't do it we can't do it you know I just don't want to get confused I don't want to get all tied up in doctrines we'll read one in a minute where the Prophet said this is the oldest Doctrine that's ever been he said this not a new doctrine the oldest one that's ever been what the Plan of Redemption all right but you see there's no way to do it and I've got one in here get to it in a minute where the prophet of God said God didn't come to redeem the devil's children that's right amen he come to redeem his children see then what are we we was born I thought now that we were born kin folks to the devil right I thought he was the closest King in the Book of Ruth right I thought that was Bible but yet we don't want the Bible we just want something to tell us how to make us feel good and just well that's wonderful but remember feeling good you won't face the devil with it either you can shout around the devil all you want to and he just laugh at you that's right am he ain't going to move but he going to move when the word comes cuz that's the one thing he can't handle that's right all right now so then get what we're talking about if we talk about redeemed and redeem being able to go back to a place position condition whatever you want to make it make it is to be able to go back to a place where you came from all right now we covered last week or this past Wednesday the point and I gave it back to you where we we'd have it on the uh number five of you notes that brother randam was talking about and who is this mzd that Jesus Christ the son of God now not Jesus the flesh Jesus Christ the son of God the Christ the anointing the Loos the theophany the the all in all came in a word formed body stood there in that body and was able to create the world Etc the many things it was brought into being all right in a word form are IM morphe body okay but he said we bypass that to come straight to the Earth that's paragraph 67 who just melt Jes we came straight to the Earth to be tempted by sin amen all right now so we never came like he did no all right see we didn't come in that word formed body right now I kept trying to say that Wednesday and I hope you get it and then you can see how we came all right now he came in that word form he stood there in a body y you said what kind of a body was it no it wasn't 16 elements it was better The Prophet it one time y he said a better hand a better eye better ears better than what we are he stood there in a theophany word formed body all right but he said we bypass that that's right and we become that here upon the Earth we become the word here all right but here's the way people preach it and that's what I told you that they're not saying it correctly you read what the prophet says people are say see there we byass the word well then brother brandham said if you wasn't part of the word before the world you never will be amen so now what are you saying well I don't know I just believe we byass the word see now you won't answer me and one thing about this old boy you look at I tell you what I believe I don't play around I don't try to trick you into anything I don't tell you I'll try to tell you both sides of it and at least you know what I believe but about 90% of the preachers in this message you'll never get them to tell you what they believe they'll Bice every way they can to get around it but then let say we don't believe like you yeah my wife and I talking today coming up in other words if you tell me so now brother Dale you may not agree with me about what I believe it means exactly that you you got some idea right you got a concept that you know I don't believe or you wouldn't be making that statement right right right but see why don't people just tell what to believe right am I believe Jesus Christ Jesus Christ not the flesh now I say Jesus Christ and you know why I say it Jesus is the only name God ever had who was that back there that created the world it was God in another form called a son right you agree that's right or else you're trinitarian right that was God Almighty in another form called the word are the Son of God Amen Son of God is not God in two forms or three I mean you know another God right that's why I believe that we if we have the new birth today we are the children of God Amen called the Sons and Daughters of God but we're only called at because of the element we live in but we're really God made manifest yes sir in a form called son well now that's going a little bit too far now I think it's about time to say it like it is amen right well you think you're God I didn't say that your Prophet said it amen the Bible says it so you go argue with them then I'll say it so if you want to get me with it I believe anybody that's Born Again believer that have eternal life that's God dwelling in you that's right now you tell me it's not am if it's God dwelling in you who are you your God in human flesh again upon the Earth right well that's just a little well see there that's why you don't believe it you don't believe what the prophet said you don't believe what the Bible say but you say they'll say we B pass the word now what do you mean brother R said if we wasn't a part of the word before the world we never will be a part of it that's right you believe those quotes is Right amen all right so then what did we do we bypass the word formed body right see that's the way we should have come he came in a word formed body and stood out there we should have stepped out there in that same way right but yet it would have never brought a fall into condition it would have never brought the fatherhood in condition that he wanted to be you know wanted to really be it would have never brought the Savior the Healer the deliverer it would have never brought his attributes so it wasn't going to happen right but don't think you become the word here right see cuz you wasn't the word there if you wasn't part of Jesus Christ when he was on this Earth you never will be a part of Jesus Christ am all right that's simple that's right you see that's eternal life amen now see if you have eternal life eternal life never had a beginning right amen but there was a time we didn't have it that's right there was a time we didn't possess it oh but brother Dale I just believe down inside of me with that eternal life and I believe that quote of the Prophet what is a prophet saying is he contrary to the Bible then you don't need to be born again right you just need to die cuz you'd automatically go to heaven but that you know I mean I'm sorry I get on to that and that's just the way I talk and that's PL language but see but is it true or not that's right I believe you must be born again I believe you must receive eternal life cuz I believe you was born in sin shepher of iniquity spouse your mother's womb and went forth a li doomed and lost and on the way to Hell amen that's what I believe amen and you must receive eternal life amen Prophet said you begin it right here at the altar all right that's where it came to you amen but if I wasn't a part of that eternal life before the world I can't have eternal life today except by like the foolish virgins Etc one of these days will have cuz they'll have it by just an impartation for amen that's right Y and actually Adam himself was just by impartation he didn't go through a new birth that's why you and I must have the new birth we must go through that to receive eternal life all right then it always was eternal what the eternal life you have that's simple to mean now it just you know it but get to point of what I'm saying Jesus stood there in a word form body yep that's right when he appeared over to Moses brother Rand said it look like a man that's right I believe the one who stood there and created the world was not a spook or or something it's a glob or something no it was the man Christ Jesus that's right that Ste from an eternity down into that and it's not you go back and show me let's see if it's right brother Brandon would call that theophany like a baby playing before the father's door right but what if he mean he was like a baby oh like a baby when did he grow up right that's an example folks that's not a point that he was just a baby laying there and his goo goo gaga and a 4,000 million years later he finally got to crawling and then he got to finally coming up and he got to you know and they finally become a man no it's it describing right it was just like a child playing before the father's door cuz you know what I believe as much as we get of eternal life on this side we're just little babies I don't care who you are and how much you think you know about the message and whatever it is we just still little babies that's right amen we're still playing with Rattlers sucking our thumbs you know and pacifiers as far as spiritually speaking right get off of that brother DL okay thank you now so let's go take some illustrations in the Bible in the prophet's message and let's see how far we can go back but we covered then Wednesday night that if we can believe that we was in him when he stood in that word formed em morphe body and if we don't believe we was in him we cannot be redeemed because the prophet said it's only the predestinated is considered in Redemption that's right all right that's in one of the quotes up and down in front of you right only the predestinated so we can't look and see that we had to be in him all right now that's how we can be redeemed that far but I'd like to ask you a question there I wrote my own a note for express it to be able to redeem us back to a place where he stood there you know in one word one body all right he stood in a body okay right now we had to be in him so we certainly know we was not people right mortality Etc because at that position he wasn't an immortal body either right that was a theophany right am a word body that was a whole lot greater than this old nasty garbage can we love to fix up you know and do everything you all right do we believe we was in him then how was we in him how was we in him and the prophet said if we don't believe we was in him we never will be there how was we in him we had to be a part of his own life that's right amen yes that's right and then the fall brought us into this condition of lost and doomed and thing but to redeem can bring us back to the place of his life now see here's where that you know I try to explain something to you that I see and I know it's hard but see when people say redeem we want to run away over under you know you know when that day that you receive that new birth and that Soul you know that soul is redeemed future home I think it's 49 the prophet said your soul is redeemed right he said but you're waiting Redemption of the body right right so now don't worry about the body it'll take care of itself later we just worri about the other if you you have eternal life the eternal life you received was what was in him amen that's what I trying to get across wi to see that's right all right now I'm looking at Redemption right here right amen so I believe the change of the body is going to be right here amen that's right it's not going to be we got to go up into heaven somewhere to be changed it's going to take place here we become Eternal bodies spirit and soul right here and go meet him in the air that's right that's the plan of redemption so don't when I'm talking about Redemption now keep it to the place that I'm talking about here is where we received eternal life if you have eternal life today you receive that eternal life one day there was a day you didn't have it God was looking at you and saying he's got it but we looking back at God said I don't have it that's right amen all right but one day see it got caught up with us amen the day you receive the new birth your soul was redeemed that day as redeemed as it will ever be redeemed amen is eternal as it'll ever be Eternal amen that's right because we receive God's own life amen that's right thank you Lord amen amen now so let's talk about Redemption here but I thought we going to be redeemed back there well if we can't see it here right you got problem trying to go back there that's right right but you see you say I always was eternal the eternal life you have always was eternal amen that's a simple statement amen all right now putting that into a mortal human being gives that human being Soul eternal life that's right amen so we're not waiting to Redemption of the Soul if you have the new birth it's redeemed right now this growth developments is all kind of things cuz we're not through in Ephesians we' got to go into adoption we got to go into the to the The Inheritance we got to go into the to the things with it when we get through what we're trying to bring but I'm trying to get us to see that see we we we want to look back there you know or we want to look over there you say well brother D you was the one that told us thank you if you can't go as far that way in your Redemption forward and you can't go back as far in Redemption to meet eternity then you don't know what eternal life fish all right now but you see if we can look back up into what we would call heaven and we would see it in heaven all right then we know for a certainty that as the prophet would say we were not Spirits we were not anything what were we he said we in the mind of God now the mind of God is the mind of God Eternal you got to agree it is amen but everything he thinks of is not Eternal right amen but everything he thinks of is eternally set that's right right all right that's the difference amen but now listen so let's go back and we see we can go back in our Redemption to where Jesus Christ stood so we got it all in him so we're we're right with the scripture that the Bible says that we just read in Ephesians that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that's right now is that what he said amen all right chosen in him before the foundation of the world right all right now if we can see that we were chosen in him then it's not really us trying to deal very much it's only coming to the basis of accepting that he had already accepted us right right amen all right now if we can do that then we can go back now to another situation existence position Etc that we can talk about so let's go back and let's read it now go to Job 38 Job 38 is a beautiful part of the scriptures okay you like me that's hard to find so you get Esther turn on over get over right before you get this TW Esther and Psalms and you could find it you got a scoffield Bible it's 594 all right now while you're getting there we'll start in verse one 38th chapter then the Lord answered job out of the worldwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge in other words he'd been up there talking about the things he had been talking even about God if you go back before and he's talking about all of the say you know and the clouds and the the all of the things right so who is this that darken the counsel by words with without knowledge G up now thy loins like a man for I will demand of thee and answer thou me where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou Hast understanding okay see of course today we've got all that understanding Bless but now just remember come on verse two says who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge right job was the smartest man in the world and he said and people come and sit at my feet and listen to me talk that's just paraphrasing it you know he could explain this and explain that and and all and the stars and the moons and the skies and the things right people just sat down and listened to him because just marveled at his great understanding so God just asked as him a simple question where was thou when I laid the foundation of the world declare if thou H has understanding letting us know and he was not he wasn't being derogatory to job's understanding because job's understanding come from God Amen you know about the things but he was just simply saying do you think your understanding can get this all figured out right that's it that's all I say to you and me or anybody else just listening well listen way I believe it bless God I believe it you ain't going to change me I agree with you I ain't going to try that's right just click off your computer turn off your tapes and forget it cuz I'm not going to try to convert you right cuz only God can give understanding that's right we can't do it as human Mortals it won't work all right so watch you answer me now if you you got to Great understanding who has laid the measures thereof if thou knoweth or who hath stretched it stretched the line upon it where upon are the foundation there are fashion in other words where where's the foundation of the world fashion we're out here in the space we're floating around around where's it all fing I guess it's on a Skyhook but now listen are who laid the Cornerstone thereof now so when this Cornerstone I notice verse six are who laid the Cornerstone there of when the morning Stars sang together so when was the Cornerstone Lake right exactly something took place now is he talking about the Cornerstone of the world or what's Cornerstone he talking about when the morning Stars sang together now the morning Stars according to page 48 of why we're not a denomination stars are angels so the morning stars are angels okay right all right now notice what they do when the morning star sang together all right and conjunction and all the sons of God shouted for joy all right now the morning Stars I said are angels okay so now the prophet said the first celebration and that's what we'll call this message celebration he said the first celebration was in heaven right the first time Angel sang there was in heaven when they were sing then the next time they sang was when Jesus Christ came on earth right you know the angels singing all right so now the angels we know who they are they're the the created beings and at this time see Angels had already been created at this position that God is speaking of because they begin to sing okay so Angels would was the first ones created right right and then from there came the other creations coming down see so he told him said g up yourself he come down in a in a whirlwind and he says job was deflated in other words he got where he seen the fact that he didn't understand right right I think they're getting a little too cool way everybody's raing up so but the first time Angel sang was at a c celebration right and it was in heaven so now we can go back that far right amen because the Bible declares it amen that there was a time position condition existence whatever you want to college you just put it all together I don't have the education but there was a place there and a Time took place and the Angels were singing mhm that's right now but then the sons of God were shouting for Joy so remember Angels Sing son shout amen all right right all right now brother brandom are you trying to preach some form of new religion now remember the story that is behind this that brother Ram in his early Ministry he runs into the uh Oneness I guess Jesus name people and he he's just a young Baptist you know and he goes there and he listens and he said here they was and he said these preachers and said this wonderfully marvelous he going through the scriptures and showing you know Jesus and the things and he says said they said well we going to have Elder so and so preach this evening and he said they brought this old man out black man had a big old long cat on right now I invite you to go look at this because see sometimes you know we have thoughts and uh you know you know somebody's preaching and we have thoughts right well you don't run around stalk brought this old man out he said he had a little white rim of hair around the big old Overcoat on he wasn't making fun of him he's describing him and uh he said now what in the world with all of these these young preachers is out here right why in the world would they put that old man up here now if you'll notice he tells that in almost every time cuz I looking the other day and I looked at probably 10 or 12 of them and every time that he'll tell it he'll say and I thought why in the world did they bring this old man up yeah said why didn't they get them young preachers to bring the message you remember the old brother he theyve all been preaching on Earth about what it took place in Jesus on Earth and Through the Bible and showing him said the old brother took his text over here in job and said where are you when the morning start saying together and Shout sons of God shouted for joy and he said there he come and his he brought him in his down the horizontal rainbow and he brought the second coming he just he just covered you could take that what he was saying there about the old brother done he done a wonderful job preaching you know said in a little while said he jumped up and clicked his heel and run off the platform said you ain't got enough room up here for me to preach brother random statement was then see it changed him pretty quick what did he say he said Lord if that can do that for that old man what could it do for me you know right well see he he was bragging about it but the point was like I said you don't ever have thoughts while somebody's preaching to you but see he turns around and he brings it right all right right but see people asked brother brandham in what he was preaching said is this some kind of a new religion he said no sir right he said this is the oldest religion there ever was amen all right that's number seven probably number eight along in there he said this is when the Morning Star sh together and the Suns of God shouted for Joy millions of years before the foundation of the world right he said the oldest religion y there's ever been little lady was asking him I like to tell things not bad about brother bandom but I like to tell them because we're we don't think brother randam was human yeah how many of you remember and you'll go over to number 14 and that's not the only one that's on but if you look at number 14 of your notes you'll find brother brandham saying that he was in the hospital he had to get shots for going overseas and the nurse comes in and says sir do you want me to rub your back now brother Bram was sit you no I don't want you to rub my back I'll get my wife to rub it and he never said it he just turned over and let him rub his back y brother brand yeah it was just a human just like all of us you know I'm sure that 90% of you women sitting 90 101% of your women sitting here would get offended if you went to the hospital and found a nurse rubbing your husband's back right anybody going to do that I'll do it but you know brother Brandon that's not making him to be where that you try to De demote him no he's just human that's right you know he's just a human you've seen the videos of him where he's out there with his pistol swinging it around you know and do it got the alligator by the tail you know running it around and this he was just a human being that's right but it was God's Prophet amen that brought the work amen see people don't want to bring him down to that point they think you're making him too low no I'm making him what the Bible says about Elijah that he was a man of like passion as we are all right but listen the oldest religion in the world now that's what your Prophet had to say about it look at number eight on your notes there they said brother brandom that's that new kind of religion it's just a new case of the old religion is this old time why God asked job where was you when I laid the foundation of the world when the morning started saying together and the sons of God shouted for Joy before the foundation of the world that was ever laid this ain't something new it's something old it's the beginning the oldest religion that's ever been in the world started in heaven I right when the Angels sang and the sons of God shouted that's right now the devil's children ain't there foolish virgins ain't there right people that have to be given eternal life is not there that's right this was a special group of people that's right well brother Dale you're making us back there no I'm sorry your prophet in the Bible is right mhm yep I'm just trying to make sure we don't run off from the wrong end of the scale right what was back there so wasn't her body this is not a bodily form that's right amen wouldn't our spirit cuz it's surely not a perverted messed up thing that's right and this is not our mortal human soul I said that in a minute exactly what it said not our mortal human soul that we received we'll get to that this evening just trying to get a point to see that we were there to see we were there in the right way right well the the people preach this they they no they didn't say it that way because I've listened to him I said not your body Brother Gary not your spirit and not your mortal human being soul but if you have eternal life the part of you that has eternal life was there yep right amen that right amen cuz remember now we've already brought it down to Jesus standing as a one word form IM morphe the theop so if we brought it down to there and you start becoming this way then if we back up into the mind of God don't try to back up with garbage can St right you know what I mean by that don't get your own ideas involved just just relax and listen and then ask God to reveal it all right so now brother brandom what was back there said it wasn't my body you said well I don't know about that well let's just read number nine on your notes while we are not a denomination 1958 927 and then before there was one Speck of Life on this Earth listen our bodies were laying here hallelujah amen before one drop of moisture ever come on the Earth we were laying here when Adam walked up and down in the Garden of Eden I was laying there amen yes sir Oh Glory when the Cherub beams the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy I was laying here just waiting for the Breath of Life to come I was here he made me here had my body laying here yes sir it wasn't where you come from listen now it wasn't now they should have changed that and put periods and question mark something because read the statement the statement is totally confusing if you read it like just plain if you read it yes sir it wasn't where you come from M how did it get here see if you if you read that you're not getting what he's saying in other words he's saying yes sir if it wasn't another words you if your body wasn't in the world where did it come from huh you get it right you say but you added what he saying Heaven help you too in other words he's saying if it wasn't here in this world where did it come from how did it get here God had it laying here God made it we're made out of 16 elements petroleum said we were laying here okay now that's what I said we touched that about the body so they're showing the body is not up there right while the shouting was going on in heaven a world could be created our bodies were laying in that world if not where' they come from where did they come from if they wasn't in the world so when the world came our bodies were down why because of 16 Els that's right I like the one let's see I'll get it in a minute but I know where the prophet he said said we eat her way here but you know you know mom and daddy ate brought us exactly right Grandma Grandpa all that they ate ate and ate you know beans and ters and something and here comes a baby down later that come right out of the Earth right absolutely and that's where we came from okay but we'll get back to that one I just brought that to get you the point to where you'd see that your body wouldn't back there not up in heaven it was on Earth laying in the world when the world was created all right now well let's go back there and see what went on in heaven number 10 on your notes serpent seed 1958 928 P page 11 he's talking about I want to ask you who is this job 27 there when he said where was you when I laid the foundation of the Earth when the morning starts saying together and the sons of God shouted for Joy who were those sons of God that were shouting for Joy who were those sons of God that were shouting for Joy Jesus told them now he's talking about the disciples right Jesus told the disciples I had Joy with you before the foundation of world we're not creatures of time we're creatures of Eternity no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that comes to me I'll give them eternal life and raise him up at the last days no one can pluck them from the father's hand he gave them to me how you going to lose see you're scared you're afraid you'll run around here and that's one of the best evidence in the world that you haven't being nowhere yet that's right you want to be scared do you have eternal life amen what are you afraid of right you're afraid the economy is going to take all your money and you're going to be hungry ah you're talking about you Bailey right what are you worried about the main thing is you've have eternal life amen but listen he's asked the question who were those sons of God that were shouting for Joy then he tells you Jesus told them who was the one shouting for Joy Peter James John was that the ones he talking to when Jesus was on Earth wasn't he talking to the disciples then he was telling the disciples they were the sons of God that were shouting for Joy right yeah the Angels were the cherubims the Angels right see the one singing you know the the morning stars now I know you can go down with morning Stars brother around does too he takes morning Stars right over to Jesus Christ come on down we're the morning Stars I know that but just get the story you can't preach it all in one beginning and ending in dis Gentile dispensation 5519 the evening service see we come out of Eternity we was before there was a world did you know that God made man in his own image where was you he said to Job when job thought he had some wisdom said where was you when I laid the foundation of the world before I laid it when the sons of God shouted sang to sons of God sang together and The Morning Star shouted for Joy now he's crossing the two ain't he that's all right cuz I think they shouted we shouted they sing We Sing the morning Stars shouted for Joy them shining ones shouted for Joy when that seen that some day to a tabernacle here on Earth now you're reading with me what did those back there see the reason they sang and the reason they shouted what did they see them shining ones shouted for Joy when they seen that someday through a tabernacle here on Earth and the king mzd would come into the come in the righteousness of God and give his life to redeem us to God back again and to outshine the Stars forever and ever right number 12 on your notes 12 a is the one where you see that he never came to redeem the devil's children he came to redeem his own children right all right then you get into Israel in Egypt and you got about three paragraphs and the three paragraphs he's covering that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world right in the middle 59 paragraph least we had a little time to go to job 7:39 which is 8 you know and see that there where he said where was you when I laid the foundation of the world before I laid the foundation of the world declare to me where their fion that or where was you when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy telling to job buckle up yourself like a man I want to speak to you and Paul says he chose us in him the church before the foundation of the world all right serpent seed page one de God the Great and Mighty God who formed All Things by the power of spirit and has brought Jesus Christ his only begotten son who freely died for we sinners the just for the unjust to reconcile us back into this marvelous Fellowship that we have again with God and as we are taught in the Blessed word that we had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy way back before the foundation of the world how do we know that that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain that when God in his great thinking seen us shouting and rejoicing in our Salvation through Jesus so if I can shout here about my salvation they me I shouted there right you understand right now let me make this statement if you're listening you'll follow it real close everybody awake listening so if we brought it back in our last message trying to hurry if we brought it back in our last message that there was a time that the great Eternal Elohim self-existing almighty God stepped down in another form called a word not another God the same God stepped down in a form called the the word and he began to create and if we wasn't in him at that time we will never be there right the but the eternal life that he had is now in Us by the new birth so we're just as Eternal as he is all right then don't try to go back any further as little bitty pieces cuz we were in him so this existence that we're talking about where the morning Stars s together and the sons of God shout it for Joy there's only one God there's only one Elohim there's only one self-existing there's only one eternal life so the eternal life that you're talking about exist did before the world he was standing there now listen watch it tie together now when he was standing there before the world in that word form the ofing he was a many membered body right because we were in him amen he was a many membered body but there was only one person that's right right a many membered body stood there and was one person I thought we believe that ever that David could have a th wives orever have many had but none of them wives could ever have another husband right cuz that was a type of what Christ and the church and Christ and the church is a what a on membered body amen with many members one body with many members is that what we're talking about that's right one body with many members so when he stood there before the world in that word theop body and we were standing there in him there was a one member body right I mean one body with many members so this is not the no new religion this is the oldest there is in the world rejected King number 14 on your notes and I said no ma'am she talking about some religion he said that's only about 200 years old that organization but this organization started when the morning star sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy when they seen the coming of a savior to redeem mankind where was we at when we saw that manifested sons of God 69 that's 19658 no wonder well so beautifully displayed in the prodical son I was lost this is my son he he was lost and now he's found he was dead and he's alive again bring forth the fatted calf the best robe a ring and put it on his finger and let no wonder when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy when they seen the Plan of Salvation God putting your name on the book before the foundation of the world what was the other they seen the coming of sat to redeem now is what's he saying when you put your name watch's this one spiritual Amnesia 1964 411 and to be a true Christian you have to be the same we don't want to forget that all that he was I'm identified with him I'm identified with him notice and he is in me and I in him notice then ever Christian that's a real genuine Christian Christian was with him when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal reals with God 10 million years before the world was ever formed I was back there with him if I've got eternal life I was there with him I was identified with him when the the Morning Star say together and the sons of God shouted for Joy I was with him when he called Abraham at the age of 75 I was with him when he took his stand with the phone of thus sayith the Lord I'm going to have the baby where was we at who was this that was with Abraham mzc who was mzc almighty God right if we've got eternal life I was there with him amen cuz you see see that's where people getting it wrong those that have tried to go back with their Plan of [Music] Redemption have went back there and tried to put something back there that wasn't there you when we get to the next message you're really going to have to think may be about 2 hours this evening now I'm telling you ahead of time so if you want to go home go ahead I want to finish what I got it took me 4 hours to write but listen in no form or whatsoever can you go further back as people than to go back there and get ourselves out of the way and back up into eternal life and realize the eternal life that you have was that word formed body word formed body that body that word that Bible that you are that word that you are by the new birth was what was in God before the world and it was there as one person right so now you can be redeemed he said well if you do then you're going out of existence now that's where you've missed the whole story see because here upon Earth we become the word right you agree that's right amen here upon Earth we become the Sons and Daughters of the Living God you agree that's right and here of on Earth we become a one many membered body of Jesus Christ you get it here on Earth we become identically what was there before the world wouldn't that be redeemed then you see we had took oursel out of existence CU I told you redeem go just as far one way to goes the other so if you go too far back you went too far back stay within the realm of eternal life I thought we believe that we were member members of his body I thought we believe the scriptures I thought we we believe that we were the sons and daughters of living God a many membered body that was dwelling on Earth that each member in particular supplying what they have need of and I thought as I said that David had many wives but they couldn't have but one husband right so how many wives did David have one right it's just many members of it how many brides does Jesus have one of them just many members of it we're members in particular one of the other y we have eternal life come on Brothers just sing a verse we have eternal life tonight today than that eternal life always was that's right so we're standing now back on the portals of life and looking down and see as we stood there in him now I'm going to say it so you go ahead and do what you want to he revealed his plan of what he was going to do to his little Min membered bride that's right I thought we read what the prophet said that's right see are you reading what he said amen we shouted for Joy when we seen the Plan of Salvation so if I can shout now then I know I shouted then but you see we want to make it little bitty people running around up in there that's the point I've tried to bring there stood one man almighty God the creator of all things and we had to be in him if not we can't get eternal life today we could be given it somewhere as a foolish virgin existent later on but you don't have it now but if you're a member of the body of Jesus Christ why would we want to go any further than where he stood there's where we were shouting is when he revealed that plan and he told us what he was going to do you want scripture for it Abraham is called what the friend of God but you know he's just a servant right am but he thought so much of Abraham till he said can I withhold anything from Abraham seeing he's the heir of all salvation and he come right down and reveal the whole thing to Abraham right right y can he withhold anything from the body of Jesus Christ no there's where we were shouting for Joy he let us know what he's going to do that we were going to fall but we could be redeemed that's ain't God good anybody that's what we are we to thank him for and praise him little more today whole lot more tomorrow God you anybody have a name give us so many blessings of we're a many membered body only one body never had but one body in that body with his children we had to come forth in a lost condition pass away so we can be redeemed what do you think about you just me m the service father we are Joy will we are people of his kingom And We Are Family We Are One a God good to give us so many blessings ofering that's what we are God to thank him for love and praise is more whole lot more tomorrow got well I'm a new creation I'm my BR you man all things have passed away I've been born again more than a conquerer that's what I am I'm a new creation
