[17:43] world but then we don't want to come and
[17:46] and uh just fellowship with Believers
[17:49] you know and know that it's just always

[17:54] right Revelation 1 Jude 1 1

[18:01] unto us thank you for all things and we
[18:04] ask you that you would just guide us in
[18:06] your love and we know you give us all
[18:08] things freely so we can depend upon it
[18:11] and we commit everything into your hands
[18:13] this day that you would speak through
[18:14] our hearts and our lives that Lord we
[18:17] may see you and want to walk in the
[18:20] light of Your Love forgive our sins cuz
[18:23] that's the main thing keep us covered
[18:25] Lord let that seraphim with the the
[18:28] burner Lord to keep us clean may he do a
[18:31] work today in each one of our hearts and
[18:33] lives as the word is revealed it it
[18:36] would burn out all the things that would
[18:38] be in us that we may walk in you we love
[18:41] you and we thank you in Jesus name
[18:48] amen Revelations 1 1 the revelation of
[18:53] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[18:55] show unto his servants things which must
[18:57] shortly come to pass and he said and
[19:00] signified it by his Angel unto his
[19:02] servant John who by record of the word
[19:04] of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ
[19:06] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[19:09] he that readeth and they that hear the
[19:11] words of this prophecy and keep those
[19:14] things which are written therein for the
[19:16] time is at hand I just turn back one
[19:19] page and you'll be right on Jude uh only
[19:22] has one chapter in verse n says Yet
[19:26] Michael the Archangel MH when contending
[19:30] with the devil he disputed about the
[19:33] body of Moses does not bring against him
[19:37] a railing accusation but said the Lord
[19:41] rebuked thee now he didn't argue with
[19:43] him right he didn't fuss with
[19:46] him you know he
[19:49] didn't you know we'll find out a little
[19:52] bit later that the reason why and we
[19:54] know you know the truth of it but let's
[19:57] go to uh 1 Thessalonians 4:16 very
[20:00] familiar for the Lord himself shall
[20:02] descend from heaven with a shout with
[20:04] the voice of the Archangel and with the
[20:06] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[20:08] shall rise first you may be seated the
[20:11] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[20:14] the
[20:22] word now we've
[20:24] been quite some time speaking on these
[20:27] things
[20:28] and we want to uh you know do as the
[20:32] prophet said he said hold up something
[20:35] until the people see it and I would sure
[20:38] like to go on Into the Book of
[20:40] Revelations and all of that but uh you
[20:43] know we stay where we feel necessary
[20:47] until we finish the point and then so
[20:51] you can say well everybody here sees it
[20:53] but one well that's me I guess and
[20:55] that's the one we're waiting on it's for
[20:57] me to get it and then we can move on but
[21:00] U you know that's just the way but
[21:07] now we've covered how that there's many
[21:10] many different kinds of angels okay and
[21:14] it's not just a half a dozen of
[21:16] them Jesus could have prayed and it
[21:18] would have been 12 Legion of angels He
[21:20] called could have called for and that
[21:22] would have been at least 240,000 and
[21:25] then over in the Book of Revelation you
[21:26] find that there was four Ang Els
[21:28] controlling the other Angels which would
[21:31] be the demons Etc you know uh that fall
[21:34] that fell after Satan's line they was
[21:38] 200,000,000 which would be 200
[21:40] million and that was what fell so they
[21:43] like about 400 million didn't fall well
[21:46] you know we could spend a lot of time
[21:49] talking about angels and not exhaust the
[21:52] uh point of what we're we're trying to
[21:53] get to but I'm want you to
[21:56] see that to become more
[21:59] conscious you know of the angels and
[22:03] their jobs their positions their their
[22:07] things that they're doing and one day
[22:09] the prophet said like this he said we
[22:11] get over there one day he said angel
[22:13] will be just as real as we are well see
[22:15] that's our Point we've always looked at
[22:17] angels as just being some kind of a
[22:20] spirit floating around well brother
[22:22] randam saw the angel that came to him
[22:24] and he said he looked like a man even
[22:26] described his height and his hair and
[22:28] his his garments that he was wearing and
[22:32] all and uh you know so why why worry on
[22:37] that I'm I'm trying to get us to see
[22:39] that they are things that they
[22:42] do that are related to you and I because
[22:46] according to Hebrews 1 and 14 1 14 1314
[22:50] they're called ministering Spirits the
[22:53] angels of God who minister to unto the
[22:55] ARs of salvation all right they have
[22:58] something to do with you and I right
[23:01] Psalms what 34 and7 where it says that
[23:04] the angel singular and that has a reason
[23:07] for being that way because it takes all
[23:09] the angels to make the angel and brother
[23:13] Brandon will quote it most of the time
[23:14] Angels plural and and he's not
[23:18] correcting the scripture he's just
[23:20] showing that the scripture is right you
[23:23] know that there's Angels not just one
[23:26] Angel you know all right see then
[23:29] remember we went through it where
[23:30] brother brand said people will say well
[23:32] we don't need Angels today cuz we've got
[23:35] the Holy
[23:36] Spirit he said well Peter had one Paul
[23:40] had one well he had one and like I said
[23:44] he had he had the Holy Spirit brother
[23:46] randam had the holy spirit for a long
[23:48] time
[23:50] right but yet he couldn't preach the
[23:52] seals until he met an
[23:54] angel that told him those things so then
[23:58] that's you know and like I've emphasized
[24:00] on that why wasn't that this is the
[24:03] angel that was with him from the time
[24:05] that he was born why wouldn't just that
[24:07] angel be able to tell him right cuz
[24:10] there different jobs for different
[24:12] Angels wormwood was to destroy the world
[24:15] with water right well like I said then
[24:18] you think he just went off and sat down
[24:20] now he's got nothing to do so he just
[24:21] ping his thumbs and he just walking
[24:23] through Heaven he said my job's done you
[24:25] know no he's controlling
[24:28] the waters to keep them from destroying
[24:31] the world again because he said you know
[24:34] remember brother brand in the emphases
[24:36] he said wormwood said let me go down
[24:38] there and I'll put that fire out you
[24:40] know no no you control it you don't put
[24:44] it out all he had to do that W that
[24:46] thing would have been full of water you
[24:48] know and they' have been floating out
[24:50] but see the angels have their jobs to do
[24:54] but my problem is mine is at least and
[24:57] you listen to me talk about my own self
[25:00] that I'm always getting in the way yes
[25:03] where the angels of God want to run me
[25:06] to the Tree of Life see all right and
[25:10] I'm always getting in the way not
[25:13] allowing them to do their job okay and
[25:16] and that's where our problem is we say
[25:19] well each born again Christian has an
[25:22] angel well that's true but it's not just
[25:24] one it was not just one there with with
[25:27] Elijah and them you know they would just
[25:30] he said there's more for us than they
[25:31] are for them the Angels it says are in
[25:34] Psalms
[25:35] encampeth and that means to lay Siege or
[25:38] in other words to enclose to shut up
[25:41] it's got many different meanings but it
[25:43] it it it means that they're there and
[25:45] brother rown said they stay there he
[25:47] said they don't go and come they
[25:50] stay he said well he said the Holy
[25:53] Spirit had to go out yeah he said out on
[25:54] the limb so how far is that right but
[25:58] just remember on this just calling him
[26:00] back he's all right right so just keep
[26:03] in mind what we're trying to say all
[26:05] right now as I said angels have their
[26:08] jobs uh ministers are angels amen you
[26:12] know uh of church AG Messengers those
[26:16] are angels we went through investigating
[26:19] judgment angels all right and see we say
[26:23] well we don't believe in angels because
[26:24] we never seen
[26:26] them that's our
[26:29] problem I gave you where the prophet of
[26:31] God said the reason we don't see Angels
[26:34] is because we're not
[26:35] dedicated now that's the way he said it
[26:38] he said that angel appeared to him when
[26:40] he was fasting and praying so he gave
[26:43] you the key see it's not just something
[26:45] to where that we we say well we don't
[26:47] believe in it cuz that's where a lot of
[26:50] people is you know a lot of people think
[26:51] there reason that if they don't believe
[26:52] in something that means it don't exist
[26:55] everybody else in the world can believe
[26:56] in it and be right riding in a Cadillac
[26:58] down the highway and here's a guy
[26:59] sitting up in the mountain somewhere I
[27:01] don't believe in
[27:03] cars well you know what he thinks he
[27:05] thinks he's controlling the world but
[27:07] you know he's got a problem a he but you
[27:09] let him want a day to go to tangon and
[27:11] he'll you know the Amish and menites and
[27:14] the things you know they want to ride in
[27:16] the cars but you let them move from one
[27:19] place to another one and they don't
[27:20] drive their buggies 4,000 mies they put
[27:23] all their stuff in the things and you
[27:24] know they jump in and ride with them and
[27:27] and do things you know but that's where
[27:29] see we we we don't believe in things and
[27:32] we think they don't exist because we
[27:33] don't believe in
[27:34] them but now we were talking about even
[27:37] like cherubims and
[27:39] Sims and brother random covering how
[27:42] that the seraphim was the the burner
[27:44] right next to God to keep the worshipper
[27:47] clean you know and we gave the quotes
[27:49] where he was talking about the the uh
[27:52] the lips of of Isaiah and he was talking
[27:54] about even it dealing with you and I and
[27:56] our our new birth right because it
[28:00] something has to come and burn us
[28:02] out to get us clean for the Holy Ghost
[28:05] can come in well see they have a major
[28:08] things for them to do you know and and
[28:11] they're doing their job you say well why
[28:13] couldn't it just be the Holy Ghost well
[28:16] because God didn't do it that
[28:19] way you know I mean he didn't do it that
[28:24] way he didn't leave it to just be the
[28:26] Holy Ghost to do and this and that and
[28:28] the other now what have we been talking
[28:31] about all of those angels the prophet I
[28:33] gave it to you where he said they were
[28:35] in degrees
[28:37] right so they're all have their job y
[28:41] but one don't overpower and do the other
[28:44] right but it keeps gr Higher and Higher
[28:46] and Higher and Higher and Higher right
[28:47] on into the presence and and the prophet
[28:50] of God talking about Jesus Christ being
[28:53] the angel of the Covenant come on all
[28:57] right the Bible doesn't have any trouble
[28:59] talking about angels and and their
[29:01] doings but we're the ones that have our
[29:03] trouble because we don't believe in them
[29:05] because we never seen
[29:07] them
[29:09] you but see how many times have you
[29:11] entertained angels onw amen that's what
[29:14] the scripture says
[29:15] now but see we don't recognize it you
[29:19] know I've told you about the time I went
[29:21] in the basement of the church and the
[29:23] Baptist Church there and and undone the
[29:25] doors and things and everything was
[29:26] locked up and I got inside and walked
[29:28] downstairs and there was a man walking
[29:30] around he said well I just well okay
[29:33] it's all right I'm just telling the
[29:36] story and I talked to him a minute and
[29:39] said will I service in a little while he
[29:41] said I just checking things out and I
[29:43] got to go on down the road well he just
[29:45] went on out went up towards gains you
[29:47] know that was the way we went when we
[29:48] heard of this message we walked right
[29:50] out of that church and went right up
[29:51] that same road he was walking right you
[29:53] know so we entertain angels on aw that's
[29:56] right because we don't uh we don't
[29:58] believe they're real but that's what I'm
[30:00] trying my best to get you and I to
[30:02] believe in the Angels being real yes
[30:06] amen now we spent so much time on it I
[30:09] don't want to I we should go back and
[30:10] listen to the the messages prior you
[30:13] know and and and pay attention to what
[30:15] I'm trying to sayen but now we want to
[30:18] talk about
[30:20] archangels
[30:22] now there's only one mention of
[30:24] Archangels in the Bible and that's
[30:26] Michael
[30:28] now we'll get back to that in a little
[30:30] while but brother brandom calls Gabriel
[30:34] right an archangel now the Bible is not
[30:36] in the Bible to go and say Gabriel the
[30:39] archangel it's not written out in there
[30:42] so don't go try to find it so that's why
[30:44] we're glad to have a
[30:46] prophet now when I can't find it I
[30:50] believe he knew where it was at amen cuz
[30:53] he got it out of the Bible I don't
[30:55] believe he got it out of his own head
[30:57] well we need a couple more you know we
[30:59] can read
[31:01] Michael but we want to read one here
[31:03] about getting all I don't think he did I
[31:05] think he knew the Bible all right so
[31:08] then that way we can depend on what he
[31:10] had to say about it and all and and see
[31:13] it now don't get confused with today
[31:16] when I keep bringing out when go we'll
[31:18] go into Gabriel and don't get confused
[31:21] now I know the quotes where the Prophet
[31:23] said that Gabriel was a messenger to the
[31:26] Jews
[31:27] I agree with you 100% he was but your
[31:31] Prophet said that the one that announced
[31:34] the first coming would announce the
[31:35] second coming and I know that's to
[31:38] Israel amen but what about me and you
[31:42] okay we'll get to that later but brother
[31:44] brandom
[31:45] said on the message believest thou
[31:50] this that there were great angels and
[31:54] things and that
[31:55] archangels and he said now
[31:58] Gabriel right Gabriel had a job to
[32:03] do Gabriel was the announcing
[32:07] Angel he was the one to come to Daniel
[32:10] Daniel 8:16 9:21 on through into 121 and
[32:14] and all in the Book of Daniel and you'll
[32:17] find that related together with Michael
[32:20] all right and you'll see there that to
[32:23] show you what I'm trying to say that
[32:25] there has to be degrees and level
[32:27] right and uh you know uh you may have a
[32:32] guy that's working in the uh you know
[32:36] you got a shop and you may have a guy
[32:38] working in the shop he may be stronger
[32:40] than everybody else but he's not the guy
[32:43] that's running the printing
[32:45] press right he's the guy sweeping the
[32:48] floor but he's got his job so don't get
[32:52] into how big who's what and how strong
[32:54] what it just just forget all about it
[32:56] and just you know just listen a little
[32:58] bit and let's talk about it
[33:02] because Gabriel was coming to
[33:07] Daniel but he was hindered there if
[33:09] you'll read your
[33:11] scripture for 21 days
[33:15] yep by the Prince of Persia which was
[33:18] Satan right now and he says your
[33:23] prince he calls him the great Prince and
[33:26] all he he said Michael came to my Aid
[33:31] yep but see Gabriel then couldn't defeat
[33:34] Satan right so there wouldn't be an
[33:37] angel under Gabriel anywhere all the way
[33:40] down to what the Angels would be would
[33:42] not be capable of defeating Satan right
[33:46] is that sensible sure because he said he
[33:49] said Michael came to my
[33:52] Aid and and and he was there with it see
[33:55] all right now Gabriel as I said is the
[33:58] announcing Angel he come to tell Daniel
[34:02] of the future of
[34:04] Israel see all right he came to
[34:08] Zacharias in uh Luke
[34:11] 1 and he told him about John the Baptist
[34:15] that was going to
[34:16] come all right you know Elizabeth and
[34:18] and all and she'd conceived and you
[34:22] remember Zacharias is about like me and
[34:25] you and he he said well what kind of a
[34:27] sign do I have of it he said okay you
[34:31] don't believe me so you just won't be
[34:32] able to speak till the baby gets here
[34:35] you know that's what happened that's
[34:36] right y you know that when he first
[34:38] opened his mouth he was able to tell him
[34:40] what the name the child that's right you
[34:42] know John which it should have been
[34:44] Zacharias or something like that the
[34:46] prophet said but he was able to tell you
[34:48] know what the name would be all right
[34:51] now remember that the angel Gabriel
[34:54] looked to connection I want you to
[34:56] follow this especially into the
[34:58] afternoon message all right that Gabriel
[35:01] would tell uh Zacharias what the name
[35:04] his
[35:07] son so it's more than just to deliver a
[35:10] message it has a lot more to do with it
[35:13] he appears also to
[35:16] Mary in telling her that she will
[35:19] conceive and have a child and who it'll
[35:21] be Etc and that was his denouncing of
[35:25] the first coming of of Jesus Christ and
[35:29] he even tells Mary what to name the
[35:32] child but now remember he's an
[35:36] angel all right y he was told her to
[35:40] name him Jesus right but that didn't
[35:43] make
[35:46] Elizabeth you know John to J Jump in the
[35:49] wound of
[35:52] Elizabeth because Gabriel said it but
[35:55] when Mary a human being said the name
[36:00] Jesus then John received the Holy Ghost
[36:03] in his mother's womb see now that ties
[36:05] down to earth and we ought to realize
[36:07] that and we'll get back to that more as
[36:10] we go along but just keep those things
[36:12] in mind see Gabriel then he had a
[36:15] special
[36:17] job he was to announce like a great
[36:20] event like Israel and all of their
[36:22] Journeys and all their things he made
[36:24] known to uh Daniel all of the things
[36:27] that would
[36:28] transpire then he announced you know the
[36:31] great coming of the person to Zacharias
[36:34] of John the Baptist and and then he
[36:37] would announce to to Mary about the
[36:40] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ now I
[36:42] wrote it like this I'll cover more in
[36:44] detail probably this afternoon all right
[36:47] but I want to jump over and just just I
[36:49] wanted that in your
[36:51] mind because Gabriel could not handle
[36:54] Satan right
[36:57] for 21 days he was hindered I know the
[37:00] biggest portion of that hindrance was in
[37:02] the mind of of Daniel sure you know sure
[37:07] but that's still he couldn't handle the
[37:09] situation right he had to have help to
[37:13] come well you know the Angels don't
[37:15] worry about hollering for help when they
[37:18] need it but sometimes we don't want to
[37:21] we think we can make it on our own but
[37:24] now just remember what I've been trying
[37:26] to get you to
[37:27] see that the angels of God are sent to
[37:32] minister only to the Airs of Salvation
[37:36] we don't believe in little Gloria
[37:38] sitting over in the manger scene you
[37:41] know it couldn't be decent enough to put
[37:44] a man Angel there because we don't
[37:46] believe in female angels and things are
[37:50] but see each one has his
[37:53] job the seraphim he keeps the work
[37:56] worshiper clean
[37:58] right the cherim and brother R said the
[38:01] word is interchangeable in other words
[38:03] he used it as the
[38:05] sign but if you'll go back and study it
[38:07] we will more this evening but if you'll
[38:09] go back and do it brother brandom would
[38:11] use cherubim and serim as the same Angel
[38:15] but then he would def divide their jobs
[38:17] throughout the Bible like in the Old
[38:20] Testament it wasn't a cherubim that was
[38:22] made you know the the S seraphim excuse
[38:26] me wasn't that made it was cherubims
[38:28] that were made and placed over the altar
[38:31] right uh you know and in Ezekiel you'll
[38:33] find see because seraphim is only used
[38:35] two times and that's in Isaiah 6 whereas
[38:38] cherubim is used a whole lot more and
[38:41] and related to it and but just take your
[38:43] Chim sometimes and relate his job and
[38:46] you'll find it has something to do down
[38:49] here
[38:50] right whereas the seraphim is keeping us
[38:54] clean in heaven yeah the worshiper clean
[38:57] all right so they got their own job all
[39:00] right I just want to make sure you
[39:01] follow that I'm not trying to talk about
[39:04] just Angels Etc I'm trying to get you
[39:07] and I to see how they actually are for
[39:10] the erors of
[39:11] Salvation so then just keep that in
[39:15] mind all right
[39:20] now Moses as the said made cherubims
[39:24] Ezekiel Saw cherubims You remember what
[39:26] brother rown described Ezekiel when he
[39:28] talks about the wheel in the middle of
[39:29] the wheel and how that they had four
[39:31] faces and had this and that and the
[39:33] other and he comes all the way down to
[39:34] the church ages and it comes all the way
[39:37] down so then you'll see cherubims have
[39:38] the dealing with more or less the
[39:40] Earthly form right of what we're doing
[39:43] but keep that in mind but now let's get
[39:45] on this Archangel and and get off of
[39:47] that what's the order of their
[39:50] work that they
[39:53] do now I I've always said this
[39:57] if I owned a company and the kids you
[40:00] know they came along well they would
[40:02] start cleaning the
[40:05] bathroom and cleaning the
[40:07] floor but now where do you see a CEO or
[40:10] a president doing something like that
[40:13] now I just wouldn't have
[40:15] one if I had a company my CEO or my my
[40:19] plant
[40:20] manager he better know how many
[40:22] bathrooms there are in there and whether
[40:23] there toilet paper in them or not he
[40:26] said well that ain't his job why not
[40:29] he's in charge of
[40:33] everything I used to work there at
[40:35] dville and and we had 40s something uh
[40:40] employees well you know on that line the
[40:43] group we were in with brother dick KN
[40:46] you know well lot even brother dick now
[40:48] he was good but he didn't know the
[40:50] 40something
[40:51] jobs brother Al he didn't know the
[40:54] 40something jobs but you know what I was
[40:56] out to replacement I had to know all 46
[40:58] of them me we had I had to be able to go
[41:02] get them and go to work on them without
[41:04] being trained even if I had run them in
[41:06] a year all right my point is what I'm
[41:10] saying watch the order coming downward
[41:14] or going upward either way you want to
[41:16] make
[41:18] it because even like the burners you
[41:20] remember when when Jacob laid down head
[41:23] on the Rock looked up there was Angel
[41:25] ascending and descend
[41:27] sending they were carrying up his
[41:29] prayers and his doings and all and
[41:31] bringing back things to him all right
[41:36] look at it as them doing that for us
[41:40] amen and then you won't be just say well
[41:42] that's the Holy Ghost well see that's
[41:45] what we doing so you say well why do we
[41:47] need to know it's all about God it's
[41:49] just
[41:51] God well who is your
[41:54] god what is your God's
[41:58] name all right see we need to know a lot
[42:01] of things don't we amen all right let's
[42:04] get down to
[42:06] it
[42:08] now Gabriel is used to
[42:12] announce but whereas Michael according
[42:16] to Daniel you want to read it you know
[42:19] Daniel
[42:21] 8 and Daniel 9 and then Daniel 12 you'll
[42:25] be dealing with
[42:27] Michael because now remember even though
[42:30] Gabriel announces to
[42:35] Israel Michael must come on the
[42:39] scene all right and just like it is in
[42:42] the Book of Revelations because you
[42:43] remember we're showing you how the whole
[42:45] Bible was written that in the Book of
[42:47] Revelations the reason we keep reading
[42:49] that the Revelation that God give to
[42:51] Jesus to give to John S and signified it
[42:53] by an
[42:54] Angel all right
[42:56] but that angel you see that angel as a
[43:00] delivering Angel to speak to
[43:05] John but about two verses later you find
[43:08] it in red letter you see that Christ
[43:10] come on the
[43:12] scene right right whatever we try to
[43:16] deliver to you if Christ don't come on
[43:17] the scene hey we've done missed it
[43:20] anyway you
[43:22] know if Christ don't come on the scene
[43:24] and take you and I out of here then what
[43:26] we believe is wrong
[43:30] right I said what we believe is wrong I
[43:32] didn't say the message was wrong right I
[43:34] said what we believe because see our
[43:36] believing of the message could make us
[43:38] miss it amen of what we believe well
[43:42] it's not important to know we just need
[43:43] to know about Jesus that's exactly what
[43:46] I'm talking about what the world say
[43:48] that's what I'm trying my best to get
[43:49] you to see even though Daniel would be
[43:53] able to come and tell I mean Gabriel to
[43:57] Daniel and tell him even of the 70 weeks
[44:00] of Daniel but things like that and I'll
[44:03] go ahead and say it for many weeks down
[44:06] even though the angel of God could be
[44:08] able to come to brother randam and tell
[44:10] him what the seals were he couldn't
[44:12] reveal it right
[44:14] right and you show me where he said you
[44:17] could cuz he said only the Holy Ghost is
[44:19] the Holy Ghost the only revealer of the
[44:20] word amen you know you going to make him
[44:22] the Holy Ghost see you're going to mess
[44:25] up
[44:26] all right so what was the
[44:28] job that Michael is to
[44:32] do all
[44:35] right
[44:37] Michael his major work is to defeat
[44:47] Satan okay he was defeat Satan the great
[44:51] Archangel yep
[44:54] okay that's where I've always said
[44:58] that we're not looking at it in the
[45:00] correct order and we'll get to it in the
[45:02] minut about Michael being
[45:05] Christ but you
[45:07] see
[45:09] Michael brother random
[45:13] said that he wasn't a
[45:16] man
[45:19] right he was an
[45:24] angel h
[45:27] see
[45:28] now I hope this will unlock our
[45:31] minds as to when you're when you say
[45:34] Michael is Christ your mind is saying to
[45:38] you Jesus is
[45:43] Michael now unlock it that's right
[45:46] because you have no way of saying
[45:49] that no
[45:52] amen Jesus wasn't Michael right
[45:57] Michael is
[45:58] Christen right okay so unlock your
[46:03] mind think with
[46:05] me yeah but it's just Jesus see that's
[46:08] what I'm
[46:10] saying that's where the two Soul people
[46:12] was they said brother R said the soul is
[46:15] the nature of the spirit and they said
[46:16] ah the soul is just the nature of the
[46:18] spirit see they added the word to it
[46:20] right it's made it nothing you just the
[46:23] nature of the spirit it's just just
[46:26] no it's the real you amen you see all we
[46:29] got to do is take one
[46:31] word add it or take it away right all
[46:35] right now what was Michael's job to
[46:38] do in the Book of Daniel you'll find him
[46:41] coming on the scene
[46:44] right and he is
[46:47] actually
[46:49] fighting for
[46:52] Gabriel to where Gabriel is loose to go
[46:55] on down to Daniel I read
[47:00] it Daniel says you're
[47:04] Prince
[47:07] Right the great
[47:09] Prince over in in Michael 12 I mean
[47:13] Daniel 121 it says the great Prince
[47:15] Michael will stand up and
[47:18] fight and Michael will stand up in the
[47:20] end time and fight for
[47:23] Israel we know that's true
[47:26] H see in other words he's the one that
[47:29] can defeat Satan y amen and I've always
[47:33] said it this way to you and how many
[47:34] remembers it for how many years 40 that
[47:38] I said
[47:39] this that when God was standing there
[47:42] and Satan being his right-hand man now
[47:45] brother ROM says that he was his
[47:47] right-and man you know Satan the
[47:49] anointed Church
[47:51] y well he can see all these angels
[47:54] coming out
[47:56] but he can't
[47:58] understand what happened when that
[48:00] little Halo of light came out and walked
[48:03] around and begin to say Let There
[48:08] Be and
[48:11] remember that was Michael right
[48:18] amen CU Michael's
[48:21] Christ you said well I don't know where
[48:23] I agree with you or not well okay
[48:28] I gave you some
[48:30] quotes to where you would see what I'm
[48:32] talking about but we go over we don't
[48:33] have to read it Revelations 12 1-9
[48:37] you'll find that Michael cast Lucifer
[48:40] Satan Out of
[48:42] Heaven all right now that's a twofold
[48:46] right and brother Ram said and I can be
[48:49] glad to find you these I might have put
[48:51] it in there but surely you order to know
[48:54] it he said that was back in the
[48:57] beginning when Michael cast Satan
[49:01] out all right now but it also has to be
[49:06] in a fold in you and I amen
[49:10] right and then it must be in a point to
[49:13] Israel Amen in the tribulation after we
[49:16] leave out of here because he's going to
[49:19] have to deal with
[49:21] that and see that's why people are say
[49:23] well we just we got the Holy Ghost they
[49:25] get the
[49:27] Angels well I'm
[49:30] sure we need every bit of the help we
[49:33] get that's right I can get right all
[49:36] right cuz the battle didn't start on
[49:38] Earth cuz sin even didn't originate on
[49:40] Earth greatest battle ever
[49:44] fought it began in heaven when Michael
[49:48] and his angels fought with Lucifer and
[49:52] his angels what kind of a battle that
[49:54] was I have no comprehensions and don't
[49:57] even try to consider it
[49:59] right I don't think they were karate
[50:02] experts you know and the other people
[50:05] wouldn't and this that the other and you
[50:07] know a great big
[50:09] battle you know punching around and no
[50:18] right these brothers it was in karate
[50:21] you're supposed to never fight your
[50:24] mentor that's an honor but how many do
[50:28] it everybody wanted to whip the guy that
[50:30] wanted to whip
[50:33] them or somebody else
[50:36] right but you see it's supposed to been
[50:38] an honor you're supposed to bow out to
[50:39] your
[50:40] Mentor because he taught
[50:43] you and a good Mentor is just like a
[50:46] good preacher he never tells you at one
[50:49] time all he
[50:51] knows right I talked to Brother Gary
[50:54] there the other day about some something
[50:55] that I've spoke about but how it
[50:58] preached
[51:00] on you never let out everything because
[51:03] why it's not that people get so way
[51:05] ahead of you but they just don't
[51:07] understand
[51:08] you right they don't understand you
[51:11] right you got to come to way that you
[51:13] understand all right so now Michael's
[51:16] job is to fight or defeat Satan
[51:22] right that's his job he's got a position
[51:29] there and he does that
[51:32] job sin originated are said in
[51:36] heaven but Gabriel couldn't cast him
[51:40] out y it took
[51:45] Michael now who is this great
[51:51] Archangel who is this great one that
[51:57] he didn't even argue with the devil over
[51:59] in the book of Jude right he just says
[52:02] get out of
[52:06] here Michael knew what happened to the
[52:09] body of Moses and brother randam says I
[52:12] gave you one where he said he went in
[52:14] Rapture you brother R said frankly I
[52:16] don't think Moses died he said I think
[52:19] he just stepped on the rock well the
[52:21] Bible says he did but that's I believe
[52:23] what brother randam said don't you he
[52:25] ain't correcting it he died in the
[52:27] extent he left this Dimension right he
[52:31] left this realm that we're in and he
[52:34] stepped out in a
[52:36] Rapture and he just went on off right
[52:40] and when Satan wanted to know about
[52:44] it he knew the one guy that he could try
[52:46] to talk to about it was
[52:48] Michael Michael said I ain't even going
[52:51] to talk to
[52:52] you and boy you know that tore the devil
[52:54] up
[52:55] MH right you
[52:57] know we used to have a brother here and
[52:59] I'm not throwing off on we had a brother
[53:01] here that that all you had to do is just
[53:03] say uh you know like man that used to
[53:07] work down there dville all he had to do
[53:09] was you go up to him and say you're not
[53:10] feeling too
[53:13] good and you know with a couple hours
[53:15] he's gone
[53:17] home why because he took that power of
[53:20] suggestion you know and it kept working
[53:22] and kept working with him so Michael
[53:26] knew not even to allow Satan to even
[53:28] have any pirate
[53:30] suggestion he just says get out of
[53:34] here just go
[53:36] on but you
[53:38] know you can't never figure out the part
[53:42] of a angels and things cuz they're like
[53:44] humans in the express of this I told you
[53:47] about it we we had a boy at dark gills
[53:49] he had a 57 chevret and this other guy
[53:51] had a Pontiac and that boy that 5 said
[53:55] chevret wanted a drag race every week
[53:57] and that old Pontiac could just go just
[54:00] run off leaving the boy in the Chevrolet
[54:02] would go and he would rebuild cators and
[54:04] put on brand new cators and four four
[54:07] barrels and two four barrels and man
[54:09] he's fixed the transmission he done
[54:10] everything he' pull up side that old boy
[54:12] and he said I want to try you again he
[54:14] just just run off and leave him he
[54:16] spending on tell him what back then
[54:18] trying to outdo him
[54:20] right wonder what he order done it went
[54:22] and bought him a
[54:24] Pontiac
[54:26] you know right but see he didn't have
[54:28] that much
[54:30] sense and that's the way the human
[54:32] element is and I believe that's the way
[54:35] the Angels
[54:37] work I believe Angels work in a degree
[54:40] that like brother Brandon says if he
[54:42] can't get you for drinking what did he
[54:44] do he said he'll get you smoking all
[54:46] right so there's a drinking
[54:49] Angel you know there's a smoking
[54:54] angel yeah and it was amazing cuz I've
[54:57] never really seen that and I found about
[54:58] three or four of them gave it to you
[55:00] where brother Ram called the angel that
[55:01] come to him a healing Angel right I've
[55:04] never seen
[55:05] it he called him the healing
[55:08] Angel H see they got a job to do right
[55:12] but our problem is is when we won't do
[55:14] our
[55:15] jobs we won't do everybody else's
[55:19] job you
[55:20] know just doing our
[55:23] job h
[55:26] and let everything work in order and the
[55:29] whole thing goes all the way through but
[55:31] see I'm trying to get a point
[55:34] there
[55:36] Satan could not defeat
[55:40] Michael now what kind of a special angel
[55:44] or or being was that that Satan couldn't
[55:51] defeat the only one I know that Satan
[55:54] can't defeat is almighty God right so
[55:57] we're getting closer and closer together
[56:00] to what we're talking about
[56:03] right that
[56:05] Satan he don't
[56:09] understand I gave you a couple of quotes
[56:11] there beginning and end of the Gentile
[56:13] Gentile dispensation number seven on
[56:15] your note brother says Michael was
[56:20] Christ he saids on paragraph or page 78
[56:23] Christ of mystery number8 on You not
[56:25] Christ of mystery 1963 728 I think he
[56:30] said Michael
[56:32] Christ he said Satan tried to have a
[56:35] better Kingdom than
[56:38] Michael than
[56:40] Christ all right now let's talk a little
[56:44] bit if Michael is
[56:47] Christ now remember the statement I made
[56:50] a moment ago brother random doesn't say
[56:53] Michael is Jesus right that's a human
[56:56] element right Earthly person being
[57:02] right now and brother Ram if you'll run
[57:05] the references I gave them to you he'll
[57:07] call the Angels
[57:10] persons
[57:13] beings see we look at them as like
[57:17] Spirits no they're
[57:19] beings but they're not human beings
[57:23] right and Michael being Christ wouldn't
[57:28] be counted a human
[57:30] being but he would be Christ
[57:35] right right now who's
[57:43] Christ I gave you number nine on your
[57:45] notes he said Michael is not a man
[57:48] yep he's an
[57:52] angel so we not talking about about
[57:55] Jesus right
[57:57] right he's talking about Christ
[58:02] right Michael is
[58:05] Christ
[58:09] okay so your mind should be unlocked
[58:13] enough to stay away from the fact of
[58:15] saying that Michael is Jesus no brother
[58:18] R doesn't say that
[58:20] right he says Michael is Christ right
[58:24] amen
[58:26] now who's
[58:29] Christ now brother randam
[58:32] says number 10 Pillar of Fire Christ is
[58:36] the lost that went out of
[58:41] God all
[58:45] right the message number 11 my angel my
[58:49] angel shall go before thee Christ is the
[58:52] Loos how many do you need
[58:58] Christ the Loos that went out of God
[59:00] show us the father
[59:03] 1953 Christ the logos that went out of
[59:06] God El Shad
[59:10] 1959 Christ the Loos now let's read that
[59:13] last one and
[59:16] then let's just read it where they asked
[59:18] brother brand the
[59:22] question okay
[59:25] number 14 which would be the last one of
[59:27] you
[59:28] notes this is questions and answers 1964
[59:32] 8830 paragraph
[59:35] 11:58 brother random what is the
[59:38] difference if any between the angel of
[59:42] the Lord and the Lord
[59:48] himself the angel of the Lord is a
[59:51] messenger from the
[59:53] Lord
[59:55] and the Lord himself is that
[59:59] person
[1:00:01] okay now he's explaining it
[1:00:03] right not the person of the
[1:00:06] Angel the angel from the Lord let me
[1:00:09] show you Earthly speaking he must have
[1:00:12] laid something up and done some here's
[1:00:13] an angel from the
[1:00:16] Lord Earthly speaking here's an angel
[1:00:19] from the Lord Earthly speaking here is
[1:00:20] an angel from the Lord how do we know
[1:00:22] then that they are angels from the Lord
[1:00:24] how do you know whether an angel is
[1:00:26] talking to you and telling you what's
[1:00:27] right or not whether it be a preacher
[1:00:30] whether it be a church age messenger or
[1:00:32] whether it be anything that you see how
[1:00:35] do you
[1:00:38] know y That's he tells you when they
[1:00:42] bring the word of the
[1:00:44] Lord but when they try to pervert it
[1:00:47] it's not from the Lord then try to make
[1:00:50] it say something that doesn't
[1:00:52] say just say whatever
[1:00:55] then there's a supernatural Angel comes
[1:00:57] down from the Lord a messenger like
[1:00:59] Gabriel and Michael and wormwood and so
[1:01:02] forth their
[1:01:03] names all right and brother random what
[1:01:05] are you telling
[1:01:07] us the angels of the Lord are not the
[1:01:11] Lord right it's an angel from the Lord
[1:01:16] all right so Michael is
[1:01:19] Christ Christ was the
[1:01:21] logos the pillar of fire the Halo Etc
[1:01:25] that we've been on for a
[1:01:27] while that came out from
[1:01:31] God that was a part of God right so
[1:01:35] we're going to have to deal a little bit
[1:01:37] with Michael being Christ instead of
[1:01:39] just saying he's an
[1:01:40] angel but I like the way the prophet
[1:01:42] said that he said he's not a man right
[1:01:45] he's an
[1:01:48] angel Michael is
[1:01:52] Christ Christ is the creator of God
[1:01:55] y That's why it said all things were
[1:01:58] made by him and without him is not
[1:01:59] anything made that was Jesus Christ
[1:02:01] right right see when you say Jesus
[1:02:04] Christ you're not referring to the human
[1:02:06] element Jesus
[1:02:09] right like I said Gabriel brings the
[1:02:12] message
[1:02:13] to Mary and brings a message to
[1:02:17] Zacharias of even the
[1:02:21] name of the person that's going to be
[1:02:24] born
[1:02:25] right now that's how great those angels
[1:02:28] stand but Michael is greater cuz he's
[1:02:32] Christ right but R doesn't call Gabriel
[1:02:37] Christ he calls Michael
[1:02:40] Christ Satan could never figure that
[1:02:43] out I said he knows that he was made the
[1:02:47] right-hand man with a right-and man
[1:02:49] supposed to be second in
[1:02:50] command he come to find out that a part
[1:02:53] of God went out which was the logos the
[1:02:56] word the Christ the son of God theophany
[1:03:00] all of those
[1:03:03] words and he began to
[1:03:06] create and Satan can't handle him right
[1:03:10] why because it's not just a regular
[1:03:16] Angel it's Christ
[1:03:19] amen and brother R said Christ is the
[1:03:22] Angel of the Covenant now he never said
[1:03:24] Jesus Jesus is the Angel of the
[1:03:27] Covenant he said Christ now he'll say
[1:03:30] I'll make sure you understand me or you
[1:03:33] won't think I'm running it all he'll say
[1:03:35] Jesus Christ is the Angel of the
[1:03:36] Covenant yeah cuz that's true amen Jesus
[1:03:40] Christ because Jesus is the name of
[1:03:42] almighty God right right
[1:03:46] right that's the only name God ever had
[1:03:48] that is his name
[1:03:51] Jesus but see that name was delivered by
[1:03:53] Gabriel
[1:03:58] but now where do we get this afternoon
[1:04:00] on something to move into the message a
[1:04:02] little further to where we can look at
[1:04:05] it and see what has really taken place
[1:04:08] even in our
[1:04:11] day amen y I do not believe brother
[1:04:15] brandom was Christ I do not believe
[1:04:18] brother brandom was Michael I do not
[1:04:20] believe none of that now right but he
[1:04:22] was the anointed right
[1:04:24] Amen in the basis of saying Christ that
[1:04:28] way but not the
[1:04:30] Christ he said if you do that he said
[1:04:33] you messing me up but it's better to say
[1:04:35] that he's God than it is to say he's the
[1:04:38] devil right amen that's closer he's
[1:04:42] closer to being God than he is being you
[1:04:44] to call him the devil so we have to get
[1:04:46] it in the right place but you understand
[1:04:48] what I'm saying yes I just want this
[1:04:50] point to
[1:04:51] you Christ come out from God in the
[1:04:55] beginning
[1:05:00] right and that was
[1:05:06] Michael see we've dealt with it being
[1:05:08] Christ and we've preached on it many
[1:05:10] many sermons about
[1:05:12] Christ and how that a part of God went
[1:05:16] out brother R said now you know it's not
[1:05:18] part like a part it's like a spoonful
[1:05:21] out of the ocean being the same as the
[1:05:23] rest of the
[1:05:26] ocean all right so then when that part
[1:05:29] of God went out that was Christ
[1:05:34] amen Christ didn't become
[1:05:39] Michael that was who was able to defeat
[1:05:42] Satan No Angel can defeat him cuz he's a
[1:05:45] second in
[1:05:48] command I hope you're listening Gabriel
[1:05:51] couldn't do
[1:05:53] it
[1:05:56] but look at all the things Gabriel has
[1:05:58] done and look what's happening wormwood
[1:06:00] couldn't do it those angels couldn't do
[1:06:03] it they couldn't defeat
[1:06:07] Satan right but Michael
[1:06:10] could because see then Michael would be
[1:06:13] Christ which would be God in another
[1:06:15] form right amen right call an angel why
[1:06:19] is there any problem with brother
[1:06:20] brandom saying that Jesus Christ is the
[1:06:23] Angel of the C
[1:06:24] why is there any problem in the book of
[1:06:26] Acts about what is it seven or whatever
[1:06:29] the book of Acts where it talks about
[1:06:30] that Jesus Christ was in the burning
[1:06:33] bush y who was that that spoke to Moses
[1:06:37] in the burning bush Jesus Christ amen
[1:06:39] and not Jesus the flesh right
[1:06:43] no like I said when we say son of God we
[1:06:46] think of it being 2,000 years
[1:06:49] ago when Son of God was the first form
[1:06:52] of coming out from God
[1:06:54] because anytime that you take that spoon
[1:06:56] full of water out it's got to be the
[1:06:59] same Essence chemical and thought as
[1:07:03] what you have in the whole ocean and all
[1:07:05] you're doing is giving a job or a way or
[1:07:08] something for that to be done
[1:07:12] right so Michael then is
[1:07:15] Christ went over in Jamaica and preached
[1:07:17] that years ago and I thought they'd
[1:07:20] wrote a song Come find out they'd been
[1:07:21] singing it for 20 years
[1:07:24] one this people used to sing that song
[1:07:27] Michael on your side and I thought they
[1:07:30] wrote a song while I was preaching you
[1:07:33] about Michael and I was having a
[1:07:35] rejoicing time like they was and you
[1:07:37] know come find out they've been singing
[1:07:39] that song they had it wrote down you
[1:07:42] know but it was good Michael on your
[1:07:46] side who do you want on your side that's
[1:07:50] right well what do you mean brother Dale
[1:07:52] I've got Christ which which is the Holy
[1:07:56] Ghost that's in me what do you need
[1:07:59] angels for then if that's the way you're
[1:08:02] going so you're not seeing that all of
[1:08:05] those angels that didn't fall are under
[1:08:09] complete control of the Holy
[1:08:12] Spirit I said that from day one now mhm
[1:08:15] right all of those angels are under
[1:08:17] complete
[1:08:19] control and as I said a while ago if I
[1:08:22] had a company my kids would start
[1:08:24] cleaning the bathroom and when they
[1:08:26] wound up being president or vice
[1:08:28] president or whatever it was you could
[1:08:30] go in and ask them said how many
[1:08:32] bathrooms we got in this
[1:08:34] place they said come on I'll show you
[1:08:36] where they're
[1:08:38] at why because they would
[1:08:42] know then what to be
[1:08:45] done right right right what is it in the
[1:08:49] the president of United States what is
[1:08:51] it is V president vice president
[1:08:54] and then who is the speaker of the house
[1:08:55] is number three see if something happens
[1:08:58] to these two the Speaker of the House
[1:08:59] automatically becomes
[1:09:01] president why cuz they're supposed to
[1:09:03] know right y right right those people up
[1:09:09] there see that's where the trouble's at
[1:09:11] I'm not against Obama I'm not against
[1:09:13] anybody I don't have no problems with
[1:09:15] anybody but when you elect a guy that
[1:09:17] don't even know how to do nothing and
[1:09:18] then you put him in there as president
[1:09:21] and he turned around and said what I do
[1:09:23] I mean honestly come on that's what he
[1:09:25] done he didn't know what to do he
[1:09:27] doesn't know what to do now amen
[1:09:31] right that's right the president of the
[1:09:33] United States should have to come from
[1:09:35] the bathroom cleaning all the way up
[1:09:37] through the House and Senate before he's
[1:09:39] ever elected right right where he'd know
[1:09:42] something about what's going on right
[1:09:45] I'm not a politician I don't care right
[1:09:48] cuz it wouldn't matter like brother
[1:09:49] brandham said you put George was and
[1:09:50] Abraham Lincoln never office in the
[1:09:52] country it wouldn't pull it out
[1:09:54] they going to change nothing that's
[1:09:58] right you see right well why wouldn't
[1:10:00] you want a company brother Donnie and I
[1:10:02] were talking the other day about why
[1:10:04] wouldn't you want a company where
[1:10:05] everybody in the company was Christians
[1:10:07] oh absolutely really CHR
[1:10:12] amen now if you couldn't trust them
[1:10:14] they're not Christians
[1:10:17] okay you said we can't hire 50 people
[1:10:21] why not if they're Christian
[1:10:25] you mean you come in church here and my
[1:10:28] wife will go to town with her pocketbook
[1:10:29] and she holds it real close well if I a
[1:10:31] crook I'd tap her on the shoulder and
[1:10:32] snatch it out of the other side and run
[1:10:34] with cuz she's holding it so tight cuz
[1:10:37] she'd loosen it
[1:10:40] up you but you see why couldn't we as
[1:10:44] Christians set our pocketbook down here
[1:10:46] just leave and S up here
[1:10:52] right why would we be worried if we were
[1:10:55] Christians that's right now it wouldn't
[1:10:58] take long to find out who was a
[1:11:00] Christian and who wasn't amen like
[1:11:02] brother Donnie told him before he came
[1:11:03] up here he don't know him and his dadd
[1:11:07] and his daddy used to talk and Donnie
[1:11:09] said you send them Big Fellas over there
[1:11:11] and let me handle them just a little bit
[1:11:13] I'll tell you whether they're Christians
[1:11:14] or
[1:11:16] not you know why cuz they all come over
[1:11:20] there I'm Pastor so and so Church how
[1:11:22] about fixing my car for
[1:11:24] nothing oh my
[1:11:27] right oh my you understand no he found
[1:11:32] out brother Dale don't do that away amen
[1:11:34] that's
[1:11:36] right by the way re L you you got to
[1:11:39] write him a
[1:11:42] check okay I'm think of
[1:11:48] that but listen folks that's not a joke
[1:11:50] I just happen to think
[1:11:52] of but listen
[1:11:54] listen Michael is
[1:11:57] Christ amen and Christ is the Son of God
[1:12:01] Amen the part of God that went out that
[1:12:04] later brother Brandon said became flesh
[1:12:08] that's it right there upon
[1:12:12] Earth the
[1:12:17] crash that Son of God that come out back
[1:12:20] there came all the way down through the
[1:12:21] Bible right amen
[1:12:24] now I'll say something but I'm not going
[1:12:25] to preach on it till
[1:12:26] later and you can't find the soul of God
[1:12:29] in the Old
[1:12:32] Testament I ain't saying no more that's
[1:12:34] right I've said that to you hundreds of
[1:12:36] times across this pull
[1:12:39] pit one of these days I'll preach on it
[1:12:41] amen you can find Christ all the way
[1:12:44] through right
[1:12:48] right we'll find out one of these days
[1:12:50] Satan was what was it he would upset in
[1:12:52] heaven cuz he could
[1:12:55] not have a greater Kingdom that's what
[1:12:57] he wanted right a greater Kingdom y than
[1:13:03] Michael y amen once he saw who was in
[1:13:06] command he knew he couldn't defeat him
[1:13:09] that's right so he backed off and wanted
[1:13:10] to set up a kingdom that he wanted to
[1:13:12] try to keep getting more and more amen
[1:13:17] right and Satan today that's why he
[1:13:19] still don't think he still thinks as I
[1:13:21] said want to go about to the chevet and
[1:13:23] P Satan still thinks today that he can
[1:13:26] defeat you and
[1:13:28] me and you know as long as we don't
[1:13:30] yield to Christ he can he's already got
[1:13:33] us defeated but if we get Christ on our
[1:13:36] side then you don't have to worry about
[1:13:40] him why do you pray over your food
[1:13:43] that's
[1:13:45] right well bless God it don't matter I
[1:13:47] just go eat it anyway why why don't you
[1:13:50] pray over your food that's
[1:13:52] right yes sir cuz you want Christ on
[1:13:55] your
[1:13:56] side are you
[1:13:58] listening Christ is the logos that went
[1:14:01] out of God the Son of
[1:14:03] God and Michael is
[1:14:07] Christ he's not a
[1:14:12] man no he's an anointing of Christ right

[1:14:28] what about you come on Brother come on
[1:14:30] end it right there cuz that's as far I'm
[1:14:32] not going into this evening's message
[1:14:34] cuz if I get into it we would be here
[1:14:37] midnight
[1:14:39] but just
[1:14:41] remember there is an
[1:14:43] archangel right if you notice I didn't
[1:14:47] mention
[1:14:49] Thessalonians but he is tied to that
[1:14:55] because there's only one
[1:14:57] Archangel right listed in the Bible come
[1:15:01] on and that's
[1:15:04] Michael and it says the Lord is say
[1:15:06] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:15:08] voice of an
[1:15:11] archangel and
[1:15:15] TR we get back to
[1:15:17] that we just go a little bit at to time

[1:15:22] you up your
[1:15:26] curiosity let me say it like this where

[1:15:32] Gabriel announced the first coming of
[1:15:34] Jesus Christ and Gabriel will announce
[1:15:38] the second
[1:15:43] coming so we got to get back to Gabriel
[1:15:46] now God wanted us to go to Christ
[1:15:48] because he is the great Archangel amen
[1:15:52] and if what we talk about if Gabriel
[1:15:54] doesn't line up with
[1:15:58] Christ we've missed it right amen

[1:19:19] from take not th Holy Spirit
[1:19:23] from me you believe
[1:19:28] itto
[1:19:33] me David he didn't have any he said th
[1:19:39] salvation you just think of those Old
[1:19:42] Testament people when those angels would
[1:19:44] come to them and they would go out and
[1:19:46] Conquer a whole
[1:19:49] Army who was that the angels of God
[1:19:54] the prophet said there's more angels in
[1:19:56] the New
[1:19:57] Testament than there was in the
[1:20:00] old see really we are the ARs of
[1:20:04] Salvation they're only under the basis
[1:20:07] of what's going to be given unto us we
[1:20:10] are in the
[1:20:13] Kingdom look out there now look at the
[1:20:16] beautiful kingdom that Satan is
[1:20:20] making oh wonderful
[1:20:24] beautiful
[1:20:26] churches multi-million dollar
[1:20:31] buildings what are they going to do when
[1:20:33] the money keeps titing them
[1:20:39] down oh of course they're going to push
[1:20:41] for
[1:20:50] money just think about it
[1:20:55] look what's been revealed to You and I
[1:20:57] by a
[1:21:02] prophet look what's been made to you
[1:21:04] unknown to you and I about a
[1:21:07] prophet see even though that Prophet can
[1:21:10] make it known he cannot reveal
[1:21:14] it but neither can the Holy Spirit
[1:21:17] reveal it if the prophet don't make it
[1:21:21] know why would be you're afraid of
[1:21:23] anything in the prophet
[1:21:30] me God is send us a
[1:21:37] message why can't we depend on
[1:21:40] it well that's your idea and I got my
[1:21:44] idea that's not in the
[1:21:49] Bible come and show me where I missed it
[1:21:53] but now you'll go talk to everybody else
[1:21:55] remember that's not a good Christian to
[1:21:58] go talk to everybody else about whether
[1:22:00] I've missed it or not a Christian's
[1:22:03] supposed to come to the
[1:22:06] person and tell the person they missed
[1:22:09] it Jesus and your life will never
