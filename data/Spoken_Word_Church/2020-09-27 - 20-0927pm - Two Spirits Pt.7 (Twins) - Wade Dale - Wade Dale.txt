shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy [Music] holy holy holy holy [Music] amen god bless you good to be in the house of the lord good to be back good to be alive good to be well amen all right by the way of announcements let's get all that out of the way and i've got about six questions that have been asked by some of the some of you in the sanctuary so i'm going to answer them today on what we've been speaking of because i believe if you have a question in your mind you really can't go much further than that than that question if you don't get an answer because that question's always going to be right there and you know who's going to step in and he's going to try to give you an answer and he's always right there first you know that other guy and i did make a boo-boo last sunday and i'm glad y'all caught it i i said god is here to deceive and i meant the god of this evil age is here to deceive so i'm glad you picked that up if you didn't then just take it to my ignorance you knew what i was talking about i was talking about the deceiver god will never deceive you zero i think i said that in the sermon god will never deceive you he's not in a deceiving business he cannot deceive but the other guy can and that's his job is to deceive so i guess you know now brother dale's got uh tested positive for kobe so he's going to be about 10 days quarantined uh so brother aaron will be speaking wednesday night i'll be doing both services next sunday and um i think the next wednesday will be 10 days so we'll we'll we'll find out and see how that goes pray for brother louise he's at brother burley's preaching today and pray for him on his way back uh brother dale called and wants to go back to phase 1.2 which means these people are the only people to be in the sanctuary or in the building on wednesday and probably sunday that would be brother joe canada brother anderson brother bob brother aaron obviously if he's going to greet myself and brother terrence brother luis josh brother boyd brother john durant and brother richard roberts and brother danny fountain so that will be the only ones that will attend wednesday night just to make sure that uh we shake this thing out a little bit more there are several churches brother william borlavon just sent us a text and said that their church is shut down they've got 35 or so people something like that that have it now brother tim pruitt's had to close his church because several of them have it brother jason jackson's church had like 40 or 50 people that had it they're doing better i just uh text brother jason back there he's always been asking about mom and dad so i told him about um his wife still has it but she's getting over it so um and he had it so he's got over it so um i think if we'll just i'm just my opinion here we go i'm like trump i'll get myself in trouble don't inject yourself with clorox but if we'll get this thing out of here i think we go through it one time and we'll get it all done instead of us being it's like a pinball machine you know but we serve a god we serve a god that said whatever you need i've already got a cure for there's a bomb in gilead brothers and sisters and i'm telling you that's where i think like brother uh brother bob was saying this morning that's something god wants us to rely on him doctors are good medicine is good but we know who the healer is and he said he'd never leave us or forsake us he said he would take care of us if we go through these things it's for our good amen if you're a child of god it's for your it's for our good so all these things will be for our good so just remember brother aaron we'll be preaching wednesday night and um and these brothers um will be here on wednesday okay so god bless you um these are trying times but you know what it's not it's not um it's not just us it's all around the world and as brother chris was talking about wednesday night the whole world's grown in now yes not just united states not just little george not just church every country in the world is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god amen so that's me and you so there's got to be something we've got to do amen so and it's all found in the word of god it's not in the creed it's not in the dogma it's right here in the word of god amen and thank god he sent us a prophet to filter that through and to give us the exact answer to whatever we need so god bless you let's bow our heads we'll read first john four um before we get started hey you like that black background t can y'all see it better back there i think you can it just kind of pops out so this is good i don't like to use black darkness but to bring light out brother brown said what the law of contrast the light shines brighter when there's darkness so we're going to read it just like this i think i like that good so let's go to the author and talk to him for a second the heavenly father we thank you lord for this day you've heard all the requests lord we thank sister cleeda there lord for being among us for this period of time lord you give her good health and i pray that you just continue to touch her lord what a what a monument of of faith lord to have being in in that part of her life lord and still being able to function and do the things lord you've been really really really good to our father and we pray that you'd continue that be with each one of us just take care of lord brother dale give him strength lord your jehovah jairo jehovah rafa you're all the compound names of jehovah lord but you're more than that you're inside of each one of us ready to do what we ask lord and i pray that you would just according to your word lord that you would take that thing away from him lord and everything will be fine we know man tells us we have to do the little things that we do of the quarantine and the washing of hands and masks and all that lord but we know that you are the healer when it comes to the very end you are the healer nothing else healed except you father we pray that you'll just be with us now and take care of us in the furtherment of this service be with a low bride around your world lord the ones we just mentioned brother ron sister connie lord now we hear sister nancy bless your heart lord that you just touch your father up there in in virginia be with each one lord brother jason's wife and brother frank mccommons lord he's having a little trouble with it and all the brothers lord the brother there brother ogles being the different ones from brother tim pruitt's church lord we pray that you would just sanctify us lord we got a journey we got we got this thing we got to get this thing done and it's going to take your little bride lord and we may be bereft we may be physically bereft as you said we may be out of food but lord make us strong in our bodies lord lord lift us up lord and we'll lift you up for your honor and glory in jesus name we pray amen so we're going to read this first john and we're going to if we get to it today but we'll get to it if not we'll get to it next week i want to s we want to talk about twins now remember if we just preached on having a revival and we had a revival and each one of which there's revivals in each one of them if you get an opportunity brother luis doesn't promote this but i would like to tell you he has a podcast called ten thousand worlds remember brother brown said one soul is worth ten thousand worlds so he has a podcast and he has different brothers on the podcast to speak and to give their testimony well he did one with brother zach black and brother michael panungway and just you need to watch him amen you need to watch it and see what god's done in these young brothers lives but it's ten thousand worlds and you can find that uh uh podcast i think it's on youtube isn't it is it on youtube yeah it's on youtube so watch that i would and he's had several different ministers and brother keith brown he does a lot of ministering to people overseas too in spanish um but he does talk you know interview people here in the united states so brother burley williams and different ones so first john 4 verse 1 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they be whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world hereby know you the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh it's not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world year of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he this in you than he that's in the world satan can do nothing to the soul of a born-again believer can't touch it it's like a hot burning coal hotter than he's ever felt in his life if he tries to do anything to us but you know what we're sealed in they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god hereth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of arab and now you may be seated in the lord that is blessing we'll stop right there and then read the rest in a little bit we'll answer some of these questions and i think they've got them where they pull them up on the screen but i was to finish my comment we been preaching on revival and i think we've been having a revival in certain people certain certain homes and different things and and brother brown said what when you have a revival it always produces twins okay so we've got twins here today if we if we confess that we're in a revival then the other guy's gonna be here there was two twins born and remember those twins you can't birth twins out of two different wounds every twin that's born comes from the same womb amen eve esau and jacob all the different twins now we know when you come down to jesus and judas that didn't happen but that's a type okay but now all the ones that we're going to talk about in a little while come from the same womb brother brown said a holy mother and father and here comes jacob and esau jacob i love these all have i hated it came from the same womb so it's not that it comes from the womb it's just that they have two different spirits that what affect each one all right so here's here's five questions and i want to answer these and i tell you if you ever have a question write them down because questions to me helps you move forward with god if you sit there today with a question in your mind then what's going to happen you're going to stay right there that question is going to be right there until god either answers the question or he brother brown said he would put somebody in the pulpit to answer your question all right so let's remember now when we get started i want you to remember one thing i should have spoke on this to begin with because the bible is written in symbols amen remember somebody preached on that not too long symbols and allegories now let me read what an allegory is an allegory is a story a poem or a picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning typically a moral or political one pilgrim's progress is an allegory of the spiritual journey all right so when we look and we see that moses wrote the book of genesis and the exodus and all the different ones he did speak and write in symbols and allegory look at the book of revelations the book of revelations is brother brown preached the book of symbols and that symbol represented something else amen same way with an allegory so if we look at these allegories and symbols in the book of genesis to me it was to hide it from the wise and prudent and to reveal it just as you and i know for a fact what happened in the garden i knew what happened in the garden when i was 14 years old i was coming of age and i read what brother brown said and i read what the bible said and i'm like no they ain't there's no fruit apple apricot pear gonna mess me up except i eat too much of them and that's just brother you know brother jesus you know what he said he said it's not what goes in because it goes out through the draw amen but it's what goes in here amen so we're talking about allegories and symbols here today because some of the questions are like number one how did god form the process man from his spoken word now we can answer that by hebrews 11. hebrews 11 1 says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by the elders obtained by by it the elders are tamed a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear listen we serve a god that he doesn't need uh he's he's so far above a scientist because a scientist needs what needs something yes some kind of chemical some kind of this some kind of iron some kind they need something to put together to create a reaction god does not the same way he formed man is the same way he formed the world by the spoken word of god and that formed and and i want to say this too if you want to this comes from genesis 2 7 and thank god for a prophet now if you read what the prophet said you'd answer that question for you talking about genesis 2 7 god formed man out of the dust of the earth he said adam looked like a tree with his feet like roots i can just see i've been to the um well that pottery place is right across the road and i grew up in the pottery business because that was my first job was getting the the uh padre out of the kill but you watch them they take this big wad and they just throw it down on a wheel turn the wheel on and they start forming it with their hands and you know what they'll they'll mash it like this and then when they start here that brings up the side of the of the of the bowl and they form it well see i can see god do the same thing same way that god walked up one day and said all right i want to take uh michael and gabriel and we're going to go visit moses brother brown said god just took 16 elements and just kind of sprinkled it and walked through it when he did it just formed a body to me that's the same way adam was adam was there god formed this body and then he put adam inside that body it's human body just like this but you know what where did we come from we were formed in the womb but we were formed by what was eat by your mama and your daddy amen so there's nothing new under the sun you came from the same earth adam did basically the same except god formed adam and then as a grown man you and i had to come as a baby because of what we're talking about because of the fall so everybody got that so god formed a man the same process as hebrews 11 and then the bible tells how can we talk to the potter how can we tell the potter why'd you make me this way he's the former he's the one and you know why he forms you the way you are because if you're a child if you're a son and daughter of god that's the way you looked in his attribute and brother chris was talking about wednesday night that he saw you you and i as men and women we didn't see our children before we had them because we're what we're finite but he's infinite he knew that michael paneuway would wait till he was 19 years old or whatever age he is and that's the way he's going to look and that was what god had in his mind and as brother bob was talking about the miracle that we're keep talking about of how god had that image in his mind and he had to bring great great great great great grandma grandpa all the way down get them over here to make him to form that image that god already saw before the foundation of the world boy what a wonderful god so how did god form the process he formed him was the same as what brother brown said he said it looked like adam was like roots because remember i told you the bible said men i see men as trees we're upright beings there's trees and that god just i believe he just twisted some 16 elements of the earth and he just put a soul inside that man called adam and he just started walking around how simple is that but you and i had to be formed a little different we had to be formed in the womb is that okay now i think this second question was i never said god didn't form lucifer knowing what he would do god did form lucifer knowing what he would do there's nothing god doesn't know amen so if that question may have been asked a little bit wrong or or something or or misrepresented but there's nothing god didn't know so you can't say that he didn't know lucifer would be that way he knew and lucifer was an attribute of god but he was not that attribute of the person of god everybody got that because the angels and all that they were attributes of god he made them to worship him yes right he made them to worship him lucifer was included he wanted lucifer to be the head guy you say well why why why why he made adam to be the head guy god likes to give us like moses moses you take too much on yourself well just go divide yourself out on the day of pentecost he didn't just put the holy ghost in one man and put him in 120 people women and men included and sent them out into the world to what make more of him all right so god didn't form lucifer not knowing what he would do he knew what was going to happen but he made lucifer he made lucifer perfect i don't read that it's in the bible he's perfect he was beautiful until iniquity was what found in him not even not in god he gave was given a choice just like you and i have given a choice just like all the other angels but he was an attribute of god but he was not an eternal attribute of god there is only one eternal attribute of god there is only one lounge book of life eternal section the prophet said and that's what brother chris and i we were talking about the other day and he spoke on it wednesday that's the part satan can't stand he can't touch god has set that aside and there's no way that lucifer can touch that it's going to happen his children are going to come that's the way god had it planned and that's the way they're going to come and lucifer can pervert all he wants to but there's one group of people he cannot get and that's that genesis 1 26 man the bride of jesus christ he cannot get us doesn't matter it doesn't matter if we everyone have to die except one person if one person stands and says i'm not gonna die i am going to speak and all these are going to come out of the grave it doesn't matter if it's one person satan's not going to win because guess what i don't i don't think i think satan can go anywhere he wants to except that sixth dimension because remember that's what brother brown said that's perfect love satan don't have that satan doesn't have perfect love isn't perfect love he's a perverted love that's why he's down here in the dimension one two three and four doing what he's doing he cannot get in that sixth dimension well no i love it when when you know you do a funeral i i did part of richard um by richard marlow's funeral you know you take the death angel and you know most time death angel he's going to take him to the fifth dimension because that's where the biggest path is if you don't believe that you need to believe brother branham said you have an angel a death angel and you have an angel that comes and takes you across the river you have an angel that does this because you're breaking over another dimension your body's still here yes but what about when a saint that's why the bible says we need to rejoice when the saint goes home we need to rejoice why because he's going or she's going over into a place that satan knows nothing about he knows all the other ones but he doesn't know anything about that one and when the death angel shows up the you know i believe then all of a sudden here comes this white light in and says no i think i'll take this one um this one's going where uh i don't think you even know where it's at yeah i'm taking this one in the sixth dimension you you can you have all those other ones you want but i'm taking that one what a what a mighty god we serve even in death that's why paul says death where's your sting grave where's your victory why brother brown said i was afraid of death at one time he said but when i went across that curtain of time he said no never again well i'll be afraid of death all right so god did know he did form lucifer knowing what he would do but he didn't form lucifer to do what he did everybody got that if he did listen god is a judge he's a righteous judge and to be a judge you have to have two opposing views right a defense and a prosecution all right so everything when when when you walk up to the white throne judgment we don't have to but if somebody walks up there's going to be a time where god says i've contacted you and you turned me down he's already saw what lucifer's done so lucifer that's why the bible said he's already judged he's just going straight into the lake of fire why because back before time he did what he was going to do and he took part of the angels with him and they're going with him also all right so everybody got that say amen so that was number two i think that was just a slip of maybe i said it but i don't think i did but god did form lucifer knowing what he would do so there's nothing god doesn't know if not he's not god amen all right now number three i need to explain that because i told i told you last sunday that the apex of both spirits are setting here today now what is the apex of both spirits let's go to uh matthew 24 24 let me read this for there shall arise false christ and false prophets shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect see that's the apex you're so close here in the end time i i've been studying a little bit more and man you ought to get a little bit closer to where where you know like i said judas judas stood right there at the night before the crucifixion and nobody knew he was the devil only jesus christ knew only the son of man and then we look at this we see this same you say apex sitting here so the apex of both is sitting here what is the difference in the other ages let me just go through that real quick because jesus christ was the son of man is that all right say amen there's nothing else on there you've got to listen to me jesus christ is the son of man he was the headstone to the church he was the one that established the church and he was the headstone amen which is what headstone the apex that's that little pyramid right up there at the very top but he had to become the chief cornerstone on the day of pentecost as the son of god yes everybody got that same man as the son of god through the church ages through the baptism of the holy ghost but in the end time he's got to come back as what the son of man so instead of being just the cornerstone he was the you know upon this rock i'll be on my church he built his church on what revelation so you come up to right here and this elijah as we were talking yesterday or today one this elijah is supposed to turn our hearts back remember this messenger of maokai forced to do two things restore back what restore us back to here because you've got to go back to the foundation of the faith of the fathers go up this pyramid of me and brother talking joseph somebody was preaching on it thank god people are preaching on the statue of a perfect man after all these years but right here's where you and i that's the apex what's the what was the apex of god jesus christ you say no no the father it was the father made manifest you and i didn't get saved by the father we got saved by the son which is the same person but just in another form but we look to him knowing that that son of man had to come on earth die in human flesh because remember god can't die as a spirit so the son of god can't die the son of man died and we can relate to that and we relate to that man hanging on the cross and that's the apex of god his whole plan and purpose was to die so that you and i could be saved but all during the other church ages it wasn't required i was listening this morning brother bradley was preaching on satan's eden you know all satan's got to do is he he can quote you now 100 of the word because you know what he says he says okay you need to do like wesley and just quit your drinking and smoking and make sure you come to church sell them front row leave a little singing and you're fine see now that was fine in wesley's age that's what brother brown was talking about that was fine in wesley's age and if satan can get you to believe that that's where you need to be and that's your holy ghost he's got you quoting you a hundred percent of the word but he placed it in the wrong place because sanctification under wesley will not even get us born again so see we have to move now doesn't it doesn't say that that you know the the satan denied the word no he said oh yeah you're good you know what you come here with this eternal thing in you and while you just come to church and you just believe brother branham was a prophet and just believe that and and just sit right there this statue of perfect man now once saved always saved you got it everything's fine you you you're you're born again see how close that is but if you're born again in this age you're not only going to have the new birth but you're going to desire and have to go up that statue of a perfect man because the apex of all the word what is apex mean as far as you can go here as far as we can go on this earth folks is this message yes and if we're not in it a hundred percent we can't be in luther we can quote them but we can't be in luther wesley our pentecost we've got to do what brother brown said this messenger malachi 4 does two things turns a heart back to the original faith and brings what the seven seals the seven thunders what is that who was the seal jesus christ he was the head we're looking at headship now we're looking at the headstone not sure we're the body of jesus christ but we've got to bring the bible says bring the headstone crying what grace grace unto it that's what this age is for i'm telling you as brother bob was saying this morning just sitting here even having the new birth is not good in this age it's okay you're born again but you can die a baby will die if you don't feed it but if you'll feed it good food and then work its way up to meat from milk work its way up to meat then what you can be a fully developed human being using an allegory same way with your new birth you start as a little baby when when right when the baby cries listen zoe and kaylee i remember when they were born i remember actually went afterwards zach too me and mom was talking about the other night oh lord but anyway um now how did you grow up though you was a cute little kid and so were they they're all just a cute bunch of little kids but you know what if they would have just took them and set them over in the closet and said prettiest set of twins you ever seen in your life and they were put them in a closet and shut the door they would have died because they didn't get fed and then when zoe and kaylee started crying you didn't shove a piece of steak in their mouth you fed them milk because you ain't got no teeth but paul said he said eating strong meat having left all that let's go to the apex now remember paul didn't reach the apex he was looking to it we use his words which is the word of god we use his words his sermons his all the different writings in the new testament to reach the apex but he never reached it but he was looking at it he said looking to the altar and finisher of our faith he said i know there's a people that's coming amen and we're here this is it there is no other person besides us so that's why we're the apex even when god goes to the jews he's going to reveal himself as jesus christ but not in the way of us because he's our husband we are intimate with him now that's the intimacy between the head and the body uniting not going to happen in israel they're not going to get him as husband they're going to get him as a redeemer now we get him his redeemer but we learn to know him as husband amen and so that's wonderful that we are looking at the apex of all things and the apex is sitting here even in the even in the other part the other guy because it's so close he's not out there he's right here telling you you're fine yeah it's just you're good you're you're good don't don't you just feel good today boy that sermon brother bob this morning man that was of course some of you slept through it but that's okay but you know it wasn't that so good that was good but what did it do for you eat it john eat the book see there's another allegory we're going to get to a question down here why does the bible say the woman saw the tree was good for food come on we gotta quit being so carnal food is a sustainer we eat spiritual food brother brown preached a message spiritual food in due season now what are we gonna do with it throw it in the corner no we're gonna eat it i planted a wonderful garden this year we're eating we're feasting off of that garden brother dale has planted many many wonderful gardens and we're eating that food that's come off of it brother brown preached 1100 gardens that things could grow out of that we can what eat we come to church every sunday to eat all right so let's but let's finish down let's get down through so that's number three the apex number four why did eve need to go get her husband if they were equal let's read genesis three verse six that they don't have it here but i'm gonna read it we're gonna read it in a minute if we ever get to it and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eye remember allegories symbols there's not a tree that's good that's pleasing to the eye and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did it and the eyes of them both this is the answer question number five too and the eyes of them both were opened so they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons now let's read the question why did he need to go get her husband if they were equal now remember she was still a female and he was still a male anybody got that even in the form before the fall they walked around on the planet earth naked and he had his part and she had her part but they had the holy ghost veil over them to keep them from being what carnal like i said before you take a two-year-old boy and a two-year-old girl put them in a bathtub they can play all day long and they have nothing to fear and you have nothing to fear wait about 15 years later and don't ever do that right what changed their carnal mind the carnal minds what changed cause they still had everything they needed right then everybody understand what i'm saying all right so why did eve need to go get her husband why she wanted to present him remember the devil preached her sermon and beguiled her well he went and she went and said told the same thing to adam because remember what happened when god came down god said adam what have you done who told you you were naked he said my wife and then she said well what's wrong with you she said the beast see they went down the line well they had to come this way in the line to start with everybody got that and brother brown even makes it so specific he said she was with the beast in the morning and with adam in the afternoon now you go talk to him if you need to talk to him about that okay but i believe what a prophet said then he takes it to the to the uh case in 1964 i think it was or somewhere where the the white lady had relations with a black man in the morning and her husband in the evening and they had a set of twins and they were not the same one was black one was white everybody we knew that all right so why did he need to go get her husband she was giving him some revelation that's what got him in trouble it should have went reversed the other way everybody got that adam like what brother brown said adam had the intelligence now it wasn't that easy was an idiot but adam was adam was what the son of god i believe god talked to adam when he did eve i just say that because he formed adam first then eve because remember eve was deceived adam wasn't so when she presented the product to him now i don't agree because i have a quote either here at home and i always keep it there because you know you hear these people with these with these doctrines of the two seed lines and adam's seed was righteous no adam's literal seed is what polluted the world come on people so you can't run seedline natural seed lines adam's seed polluted this entire world because he kept procreating too god done away with the beast it was adam you say no seth yes seth represented righteousness but he wasn't righteous he needed a sacrifice too every person since adam needed a sacrifice why did abel need one if he was so righteous now i know the bible says that he was righteous you got to look at that though he's not so righteous that he was perfect and didn't need to sacrifice because that's what got him killed was he presented the right sacrifice why do you need a sacrifice for if he was perfect he got a revelation of what happened but eve produced the product to adam and adam said oh buddy but now remember like i said he didn't do the natural act to preserve eve i believe he knew what he did and she was so much a part of him he didn't want to lose her they didn't know what jesus christ did he didn't sit here and ask you a thousand questions why you didn't why you didn't get born again when you was 12. no he knew when he was going to get born again and that's the intimacy between you and god because god knew when you wanted it when you wanted him to be your husband your lover amen so adam couldn't destroy eve just like christ couldn't destroy listen he didn't destroy israel when israel went whoring and did all those bad things god didn't destroy her he put her away he's coming back to get 144 000 out of that amen same way with me and you lord look at rahab look at all the different things that he brought out of all that talk about this natural line lord rahab was in pitiful shape she was a prostitute she knew everybody in the whole city every man but what did god do he just wiped the whole city out and said wow where's your accuser she said no i don't have none i don't know yes rahab anymore you're my bride why did eve need to get her husband because he wanted to present she wanted to present what she had done and once she did present because remember she was so deceived she thought she was doing what god said everybody got that that's what the prophet said she was deceived the bible says she was deceived and not adam because when she present produced i think brother brown said produce the product to adam he knew if he didn't do something that god would kill her so he took her and shielded her and had the act with her knowing he was selling out the human race but he had so much love just like jesus christ didn't put you away when he was out there doing all your whoring and i don't mind if you say oh yeah we all were we were to the devil amen but christ didn't hold out against us he said you're my bride paul said the things i would not i do the things i do it would not that worry but not in the soul your soul is either born again or it's dead white or black and if it's white then yeah satan can play with that like he did with leave he can play with her memory reason conscious effects and imagination and what happened was as eve took in the womb of her mind first two wombs boom of the mind and the natural one the womb of the mind mary had to accept it in the natural womb first because she had to believe it she had to believe something that never happened before but when she said be it unto me according to thy word it dropped down and god said okay i'll use you same way with me and you when you got born again i believe that's what you said you said god be it unto me according to that word you said if i do all these things and get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ that you would fill me with the holy ghost and here i am be it unto me according to thy word and then boom he placed that seed spiritual like it should have been had there not been a fall because i believe adam and eve would have come together not sexually but where did adam come from where did adam eve come from they come directly from the mind of god they didn't come from the mind of their mom and daddy they didn't have one they came from the very creator himself they were part of the creation amen and by the new birth you did the same thing now genesis 1 26 man is unfolding as we speak right here right here any of the new ones thank you let us make man in our own image it's okay michael i know you got to come through your mom and your daddy because of what happened because what it done it made a chasm and we may not get to it today but in genesis 3 15 he says i'll put enmity a division remember when lazarus was was dead and the rich young ruler died too what did the rich young ruler he said i want to go over there and the bible says there's a great gulf fixed what was that golf choice they should have made it on the other side like who was preaching another about the people you look down at hell they're crawling all over hell trying to get back so they can make one more choice see what i'm saying you cross that chasm so in genesis 3 15 god made a chasm he said i'm going to put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman but what he was telling him was that that seed of the woman which a woman doesn't have a seed so he was going to create again a part of himself and he was going to bridge the gap back what a mighty god we serve he's going to put that thing right back together so that it doesn't matter if you come from a prostitute and a drunk that doesn't matter it's knowing who your daddy is from the eternal side i wish people would get that together in the message when brother brown talks about you always were eternal you always wear this seed that is the mind of that genesis 1 26 and 27 man not what came from your natural parents because you were born dead abel was born dead cain was born dead seth was born dead moses was born dead may i just continue on william branham was born dead now in the mind of god there was a place a spot like brother said talks about that button that button's not inside you you have no eternal life inside you because you came under your first birth why'd you need a new one but look how close it is though satan says well i think you were just something special and you you came with this little special something no you were born in sin shaping an iniquity spouse from your mother's womb a liar but i got a quote oh listen you can fight quotes all day but the bible says you were born in sin shape and iniquity you were lost and needed a savior now whatever quote you want to mix into that that's fine with me but i'm going to tell you what the bible says and i believe william branham knew what the bible said but what brother branham was doing he was at that apex he was up there in the mind of god telling us because the bible does say if the seed remains in you you can't sin what if the seed remains in you the seed that you received when you got the new birth not the seed and when you were born with a little baby why was the bible saying newborn babes oh to me see then it makes it so simple but then everybody in the message gets it so convoluted who is doing that the apex of the other guy he's got a headstone too he wants it to be him talking about satan and he wants to deceive you by less than one word now it's a hundred percent but it's in the wrong place amen what brother batman say he said don't what misrepresent or or put a put a word somewhere where it don't need to be all right that's all you got to do and to be one word off like we proved the other day satan said not he quoted everything god said but though he put that word not in it all right that not head well that still didn't wake any of you all right so why did he need to go get her husband why because she wanted she thought she was right she wanted to produce the product to him and say look this is what we're supposed to do and then adam's going oh man but you're my wife i can't take another one this is this is me because she was literally him literally that was of his body so you and i by the new birth are literally the body of jesus christ amen that's hard to swallow but you need to okay so five is basically the same thing why did eve not realize she was naked she didn't realize she was naked until adam and her got together if you read what the bible says the bible says and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons all right so that's eve didn't realize she was listen remember eve was deceived just put it there the bible says eve was deceived i read it last sunday but not adam so she in her deception she thought she was doing the right thing so she was just running around like it's like people getting born again you know everybody needs to get born again everybody all know this message why in the world don't you know what this message is you know brother brown was a prophet so eve was the same way but she had took wrong the wrong road she took the wrong road she thought she was right but when she presented to adam adam said look what you've done so he sold us out adam sold us out he could have he could have said no don't worry no more give me another one but he couldn't because she was him same way with the type of christ and the bride so that's number five number six and i have now remember question number six why does the bible say the women's woman saw that the tree was good for food all right everybody got that because remember genesis 3 verse 6 says that when a woman saw the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eye remember allegories there's a story here that moses is trying to tell us without saying that it was sex but i want to read this right too listen to this this will answer the question psalms 34 verse 8 says oh taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him taste and see allegory we're eating off the body word of the son of man here we need to know that we should have known these things but that's okay now that we know them move a little move a little further move a little higher everybody okay all right are we good with this now listen to this one john 6 53 says then when jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you you're dead unless you eat of me jesus looked up one day in the temple and he said i am the bread now what do you do with bread just look at it no you eat it amen taste and see that the lord is good eat this bread what allegory john 6 54 whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life must be an allegory or we're all vampires we gotta go get jesus body and eat it right we're eating off the body where the son of man listen the tree was good for food because she thought she was doing what god said that's why she thought it was good food if you'll understand what happened in the garden you'll understand why she said it was good for food hello all our adults are going amen okay why does the bible say that the woman saw that the tree was good for food it's an allegory jesus said 6 50. john 6 55 for my flesh is meat and deed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him now boy if you just take that as natural then we all got to be vampires but if you take it as an allegory that he was telling them he was good food to eat as satan was telling the woman this is good food right here jesus christ is saying i'm the bread i'm the food you need to be eating listen i'm going to tell you something folks you and i eat off of something every day now i'm not talking about natural food we feed off some kind of food every day satan will feed you food and god will give you food what is our food the word of god yes what's this food everything else amen and it might sound good look good and tastes good but it's not so everybody okay with that why does the bible say the woman saw the tree was good for food why she thought she was doing something she thought she was progressing she thought she was doing what god said that's why a woman can't preach or urge up any authority because the weaker vessel i'm just telling you what brother brown said and you should know that your sisters should look at each other and know that you lean to emotions all the time rather than a man that's the head of the house and he has to think about all the other things okay so that's why god told him said now you'll be under headship listen i love it if i was a sister i don't have to be a deacon i ain't got to be a preacher i won't be like what brother bob said uh what sister in the message had to call her husband and ask her if she could buy a dr pepper or a mountain dew now that's a bit silly stupid brother dale those downs stupid no but if you you know what if everybody stays in their place it's a wonderful picture if she if the if that woman which is eve remember she wasn't even until after that that's why the bible says a woman that woman if she had stayed in her position she would have been just like you and i are the bride of christ she would have produced christ by spiritual seed not by natural seed everybody okay with that amen because there's no there's no sex involved in in the union between christ and the bride it's all spoken word the spoken word is original seed see how clean that is it comes from the word of god he's standing there and he spoke the word and you materialized his seed is his word period that's why you weren't born with a seed in you of god because you weren't born with the word of god listen you were born contrary to the word yes right number one you were born contrary to the word because you were born by sex but number two you were contrary because of the carnal mind it's what the bible says the carnal mind is enmity there's that enmity there's that division between god and man when what happened in the garden god didn't destroy adam and eve we'll read it here maybe just a few minutes we're not going to get to the twins we'll just review a little bit but when god stood there in genesis 3 15 he made a promise he said look adam and eve i cannot fellowship with you like i have before that's right you've done a bad thing i'm not going to kill you but i'm going to set in motion what's going to bring you back amen i'm going to set it in motion because he said i'm going to put enmity and like brother bob said from from abel to john the baptist that enmity stayed there inside the soul of man now we know in the old testament their their lives were covered by the blood of bulls and ghosts now remember covered and they will be you might say children of god moses elijah even all those great but listen folks those people were not part of genesis 1 26 that's why that's so special that's an eternal part moses was not an eternal person while he was on earth zach black yes all of you with the new birth today you are an eternal person walking in time by the new birth because you received an eternal part of god that genesis 1 26 moses never received that oh now john the baptist brother wade he received the holy ghost he wasn't born again because jesus told them he said the least in the kingdom was greater than john the baptist now john the baptist received an anointing everyone listen all the old testament saints they received anointings to write the word of god the mind of god came down dropped down to them but listen it lifted off and moses could make a mistake david could make a mistake all these different ones could have flaws in the old testament but when you come up to the day of pentecost peter walks out and he says silver and gold have i known but such as i have he couldn't say that when jesus was there remember he was scared running he was trying to whip people and cut their ears off and he was trying to take stuff you know with a natural sword but what happened right after the day of pentecost peter didn't walk out with a sword he walked out with the word silver and gold have i none but such as i have that i got up in that upper room i'm fixing to give it to you rise up and walk he didn't have that before but look at the mighty miracles that was in the old testament many many mighty miracles by people that were not the children i'm talking about the progeny you're the progeny of god if you're born again today you are the project you have a peace of god yes inside of you that was that gene that chris was talking about wednesday that screamed out we're gonna be lost but i'm gonna save you we're gonna be sick but i'm gonna heal you how wonderful he wasn't talking about a separate person he's talking about what was groaning inside of god what was groaning inside of god was me and you to be released into this world to show the world that he could do it and satan hates that because he can't do it he can anoint anoint anoint anoint annoy annoy but he can't get inside of that soul once you're born again talk about a seal see when we see this when the seals open it reveals christ but where does it reveal christ is in you that's the whole seal grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of your redemption satan can't get there he can't open that box car you know why because michael's standing at the lock and it michael's already whipped him one time he can whip him again satan knows that he just kind of turns and walks off and goes what ghost tried to find because remember what did he tell what did he tell god when he talked about job he said where he been satan he said i've been up and down the earth you know to what you've been doing trying to get james colley trying to get kathy gabriel he's high too much man i ain't never felt fire like that before but he'll find somebody because he'll have his subjects and that's all right but you and i were born by the breath of almighty god and satan can't touch that all right let's now since we answered those questions for almost an hour but that's good if you got any more questions write them down because what happened in the garden is really important for us to understand how god that was part of his plan and brother brown said he had a plan and a purpose and he wasn't he was going to achieve it now remember he was going to achieve it in the garden of eden if adam if eve hadn't done what she did but all it done was put enmity because remember god didn't come out and say all right eve you're destroyed adam you're destroyed know what he do he said all right adam from this day forward you're gonna have to dictators eve you're going to have to be under subjection to adam and you're going to have his children and you're going to be in sorrow and childbearing and you're going to have your 28 day cycle and you're going that that's your fault but he didn't destroy him he cursed the ground he cursed eve's body but he couldn't curse your soul god can't curse your soul if you're born again today curse has been dismissed i wish we could realize that you say no i'm still looking at yeah you're looking at part that come because of the curse but what about that guy inside we are not fallen man anymore it's been reversed the chasm has been crossed god in man as brother dale said has kissed yes but what happened when they reunited me and you came when god and man when god came down and become a man is when he reunited with me and you because genesis 3 15 said i'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman who was the seed of the woman christ he bridged the gap back he said oh satan you may bruise my heel you can't kill somebody by bruising them in the hill but he said i'll bruise your head he give old satan a whack across the head when he come out of that tomb and said all power in heaven earth's been given unto me satan was like what where did that come from i thought i had him down there in that other dimension he said now he said actually you know what he said i own that too said i got the keys i got the keys i you don't really own anything down there buddy you just stay down there with your anyway see how god done that for us he sent us a prophet to tell us exactly what the word he sent us a prophet to tell us i was thinking the other day you know the quote and i can't remember all of it where brother brown where he goes into the scripture and he says till he be taken out of the way now nowhere in the bible you would think well now that especially like genesis i mean revelations 10 verse 1 the mighty angel well you would think god would be a capital a and it would be this he said oh that's christ he said so he be taken out of the way and he even talks about the bride he who letteth will let until he be taken out of the way no we didn't have a clue with him he's were but brother brown brings it right in there and tells us exactly and once you see it you go there ain't no other way it could be that's why brother brown i believe he tapped into that mind of god but when he left this earth folks he didn't shut it because remember it's an open book john eat an open book and you and i are that open book amen so now let's continue with the sermon now for another we got about six more pages of notes but thank you for asking the question if you have any more please bring them and we'll try to answer them there's always a bible answer to everything you go in the bible but you have to look at the allegories and like brother dale told me when i first started reading daniel 70 weeks he said look he said this is kind of like an allegory or or this is a story but it has an underlying meaning well see the whole bible's that way when you talk about rahab and you talk about her marrying an israeli general well you can take that and type it all the way over where jesus was talking to the woman that they threw her down and said this woman's been caught in adultery well what jesus do he just got rid of her accusers and he said what have you done she said where's your accuser she says i have none he said in other words i didn't see you do it so go and sin no more that's what he did with you the new birth you throwed all your sins down and once he forgive you zach of all your sins buddy don't lay em back down there again you've already laid them down god says i didn't see you do them i'm looking through the blood i hear you crying out to me for forgiveness he doesn't see our dirty sin he hears our voice our voice that says forgive me lord. and he instantly does the same things he did with rahab and all that he got rid of your accusers who's your accuser that number spirit number two he's always going to accuse you of everything all right let's go to we let's don't go to ezekiel let's go genesis 1 26 let's read the first quote and that's position of the seven church ages i'll get to the twins sunday all right look christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless now see that started in the first church age when paul said grievous wolves will come among you and are already here in other words but look how satan has developed over 2000 years since the day of pentecost he's had 2 000 years to perfect his game god god's plan has already been perfected before the foundation of the world but watch i said it exposes satan revealing his work the attempted destruction of god's people and discrediting of god's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is she's the bride she's the eve that's been restored she's perfect she's white she's sinless she don't even have a wrinkle in her skirt i'm just i'm quoting bible amen telling you what the bible's already said about you he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church that's what i'm i'm telling you we're reading this every time because that spirit is not out younger it's right here but if we can what withstand that and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her that's why i said a couple of sundays ago uh and i want to if i don't take any more time than this i want to tell you one more time it will revolutionize revolutionize your life if you'll get the sin out of your life oh i've been in a message 45 your that attitude is a sin amen if we get all that out of our life call a brother up if you think you've talked about him or don't like him sisters quit gossiping brothers you do the same thing i'm just throwing it out there because i'm telling you i i'm still in my body i got something going on but in my soul it is at rest because when you clean that baby up and you start on the inside let god start on the inside you know satan's right here so you ain't got you don't have to wonder where satan is sometimes we have to wonder sometimes when lord where are you brother claude the other night he called me and he said he was hurting so bad with that gallbladder he said lord where are you at i just want to see you just for a second he was crying like a baby he said please take me out of this world but you see that he had to get to a place to where he said be it unto me according to thy word lord i'm here for some purpose you haven't taken me out of the world i may have to lose my gallbladder i may have to lose my mind but you understand that's the same way you and i have to get if there's something that's bothering us in our life you need to get it out you say oh it hurts yeah but boy once they take claude's gallbladder out in a few months oh it's gonna feel so much better but as long as that thing's in there festering telling you it will make you feel better on the inside whether you feel better on the outside that's up to god to help you do that but like bob said like brother dale's even said before this thing is subject to a lot it was born in sin it's getting older i got pains where i never had pains before i got gray hair but what does that matter if we know where we came from that we came from that genesis 1 26 man and if you take a picture of me when i was 20 years old that's what i am to god that's what i am to god and that's what you'll see that's what we'll all see we'll all see is not not old anymore i i thank god thank god that brother tatum don't have to walk in here with his if most of you some of you didn't see him but he arthritis had turned his fingers sideways i can't even do it but these fingers will turn sideways and he couldn't do nothing but just barely shake your hand you'll never see that again that was because of the fall but because the decision he made probably 50 or 75 years ago that young man is going to come back into this dimension and he's not going to have nothing to worry about he can walk in right in the middle of a nuclear explosion nothing no weapon form will destroy you and you will not leave this world just like i said before if the footsteps of the righteous are ordered to the lord you cannot leave this world until you're done i don't care what it is i don't care if god lays you on your back for years until your walk is done until your last thing you have to do is done you're going to be here that's why i believe brother branham said death don't bother me no more look where i'm going and he was only 56 years old and he was ready to go home but you and i we get a true revelation look at number two the greatest battle ever fault the great first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when michael and his angels fought against lucifer and his angels it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin didn't originate on earth it originated in heaven so then it was thrown down from earth that's why the bible says heaven and earth will pass away then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven it's got to be clean not done away with but clean same thing as the earth and fell on human beings then the battle see that's our battle the greatest battle ever falls where right here right here all right an expedition of the seven church ages let's continue down through let me get to one point and then we'll stop an exposition i bob went an hour and 40 minutes i think i can y'all started sleeping on me 10 minutes after that so did you get it there are those twins again it's always going to get talked about twins but we'll get to it next sunday there are those two trees again growing side by side in the same earth partaking of the same nourishment drinking in the same rain remember the tares and the wheat and benefiting by the same sun but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of god exactly as god give it and loves it and obeys it the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word of god and changes it where it wants to you know you you talk to people about the message and talk about the different things in the scripture and if you start quoting scripture to them they'll try to quote you some back right because they're going to fight they're going to fight if especially if it's dress and hair and and baptism in them lord jesus christ they're going to fight why at that time they're from a different seed than you are i said at that time that doesn't mean that they can't be saved but see you can't walk away though and say well that old serpent seed no give it some time give it some time let them run it around and you know what if they're truly part of that genesis 1 26 that mind of god god's obligated to go get them he's obligated to get his children he won't let that god will not there won't be a child left behind of god's children on this earth when we take a rapture they won't be one he said i got every one of them engraved right here in the palm of my hand what a surety that we should have the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word of god and changes it where it wants to that's why i believe when brother brown started preaching this is the exposition of the church ages and when the seals opened he knew that antichrist spirit was in those denominations out there but remember it come into here now we're fighting quotes with quotes we're wondering whether brother branham was the prophet of the end time and i'm not saying we but i'm saying there is two opposing forces now in the message of the hour you can't hardly get three or four people together without an argument beginning over what quotes they can quote just as much as you can quote but i'm telling you the true seed will always show its fruit by their fruit you will know them all right it substitutes its own crease in dogmas for the living true word exactly as did cain who ended up killing abel but fear not little flock stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil eve did not do that and she failed and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of satan that's to me that's pretty powerful when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness what is the darkness of satan oh it's because this prostitute drunk and the very darkness of satan jesus said that light that's in you if it be darkness how great is that darkness if you think you've got light because remember satan is what he's the he's light he's changed into an angel of light ministers of light what's the most deception me get up here one today and preach that that jesus was the second person of the trinity that's not gonna fool you especially if you've known what's going on if you've been in the message more than two or three weeks but what if i bring a doctrine in here that's just about that much off oh you were already always that's you were you were born with an eternal seed in you and and boy don't that just ma and it does it makes people shout and feel good makes feel good that you listen i believe in eternal security but i believe you got to receive it and i know you do too but think about what's going on in other parts of the message world satan is here like i said the god of this evil age is here to deceive try to deceive us it deceives the very elect if it were possible if you're the very elect then he's got his guns trained right on you all right now let's go and look remember the law of reproduction that's what we're talking about because remember when we get to those two twins the law of reproduction has to take over every seed will bring forth of its kind because the first set of twins that were born were of two definitely different male seeds everybody got that cain was the bee seed literally literally because the beast had an act with eve and injected in her and then adam had relations and here comes cain and abel but that's that's the to me that's the apex then that we look at and we see that jacob and esau i mean yeah jacob and esau came from what isaac and rebecca can't get all that right but anyway they came from the same mom and daddy but it was two spirits see then you you bring from natural see you can't run natural seed lines because remember tyro babel all these different things the sons of men the sons of god saw the daughters of men they started intermingling and everything got all messed up and convoluted and then all of a sudden here they come out on the other side of the flood and you've got ham sham and j-path and they repopulated the world so you got all that mingled in so forget the natural seed line forget about it right now we are we are we cannot none of you decided that you were going to get here not a person i'm talking about from bill gates donald trump i don't care who it is we all got here the same way and we didn't know who we were before but once we get here once i grow once i develop and i remember i grew up in a house of man called samuel dale and i grew up in the house of a mama called peggy dale so i hope i'm part of that family i am because you know what i look like my mom and daddy by your fruits you'll be known but see if you say well now i don't know who my daddy was and some of you may not that don't matter it doesn't matter god used a man and a woman to get together to get you here then you got a choice to make i don't care your mom and dad is full of the baptism of the holy ghost but you sure weren't right you weren't either you weren't either and you weren't either you got to make your own choice once you come forth out of the womb you're a person and you got to make a choice well my mama and daddy was william brennaman and and media i don't mean one thing to god he does not keep a natural log book but he knew that he needed to use what a branham a drunk quoting brother branham come from a line of drunks that fought and got died with their boots on ignorant but you know god said i got to bring them together because that's what he looked like that genetic makeup has to match what's inside because you're going to look just like you were at 20 years old you're not going to lock somebody else so god had to bring um what was the date william brandon what was his daddy's name huh charles and ella that's why brother brown one day he says he wasn't denied his natural birth he said i found out i wasn't the son of charles and elephant why but remember that was in almost the last message that he preached in 1965 he figured out and i say figured out he had a real revelation that that wasn't his real mom and daddy though he genetically was tied to them that genetic part matched what the genetic part of that genesis 1 26 man well i wish y'all could get that those sermons that daddy preached about 40 of them back in 1995 on matching pieces about how this had to match this that's what we're coming to you got to get to a place where you match what god saw and when you match what god saw that's it the one just passed on you know what they they matched what god saw and they couldn't go any further because god saw that in his mind you say well then we don't have a choice yeah you do have a choice you have a real choice amen sorry you do everything is made by choices so let's read genesis five verse one the law of reproduction sorry the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself so we understand the law of reproduction is that if there is a seed planted in good ground our womb or wherever you want to say it's going to come forth of what that seed is genetically made of why do you think now we're into this dna and genetics and my you can even go now and they can test you and see if you're susceptible to cancer or heart attack just by your dna why because you're connected to that natural line of man i say man but mankind you're you're directed to that natural mankind and they can track oh if they can do that if they can track naturally where you come from and what you're susceptible of getting or not getting why can't we believe that god's already protected us knew where we come from knew where we were going to be here and knew where we were going that's the law of reproduction and then by your first birth you died but by your second birth you died i'm sorry by your first birth you will die sorry by your second birth you died so you're dead you're dead to the world the bible says dead to the world alive in christ amen that's what it that to me and see that's the whole plan when you were born from your mama and daddy good parents you were born dead because you're going to die eventually if you keep going on and if you just keep doing what you're doing me and you both would have died at an early age but god didn't want that he preserved for some silly reason but anyway so you come to that birth it doesn't how much your mom and daddy loved you and they took care of you you come to a place where you had to make your own choice right here because you know what god didn't see them to i mean he saw them too but he saw you too but you didn't realize it until you received the new birth and then you can connect back to your parents or or anybody your uncles aunts whatever you want to call it and this is your family now when you got born again you opened up a whole nother family have you ever went to a family reunion and and get born again and go to a family union you ever remember that when you go to family reunion you go well everything's kind of strange around here and they're looking at you going what happened to you where's that long hair where's that beer in your hand and a cigarette in your mouth you understand what i'm saying why because you were reborn this is my whole point we'll close right you were reborn by a spiritual seed there no way your mother and father on this earth could ever give you but when you're reborn it doesn't do away with your first birth totally you're still in this shell but it turns it to where that same hand that used to hold the beer and throw them signals up that same hand you use to hold that microphone to sing the praises of god and that's what god wanted that's that was that's the gap that he's feeling back in and satan cannot understand that how many times when you got born again same thing happened to me did the devil just leave you alone oh he didn't you mean he gets caught right there and oh brush your heart well you did me too buddy because brother brown said he takes every gun he says all right you used to do what i wanted to do now you're not what's the problem phil's you full of everything he's done every one of us the same way but he cannot touch that soul by the law of reproduction you have changed and been transformed into the image of god and listen folks to me that's all he sees that's all god sees he sees you have been re-gened paul said follow me in the regeneration what is regeneration it regenered you it gave you that one genesis 1 26 gene of eternal life right here that is so simple folks but so profound that the devil is probably he may not be right here he may be right here but he can't understand that and i like it that way if it makes him mad that's okay because you know what he can't get you again he got you here by deception the first time and god allowed that to happen because of what happened in the garden he didn't say now hey adam and eve you can't touch each other again no he had to still go by that right there the law of reproduction and satan knew that that's why he could get into the human race he knew that if there was a seed planted something had to come out and there had to be given life to it god had to give life to cain it doesn't matter how he was born or what happened act was a seed went into the bedding ground and god had to give it life he knew that same way with me and you he knew he had to give us life but he knew on the in that plan and purpose that when you match what he saw before the foundation of the world it changed you back into that genesis 1 26 man oh it didn't make us younger except on the inside it gave you eternal life by the law of reproduction every seed must bring forth of its kind you love the lord we'll put this off and we'll start right there on sunday if you'll stand to your feet musicians come remember everything musicians come up everything started in the book of genesis so if you want to look back and see i can see do you know i can see where i started in my natural birth in the book of genesis and i can see where i started my spiritual birth because my spiritual birth came first in the mind of god genesis 1 26 let us make man our own image when he said that it couldn't be taken away from but god was projecting it down and then here comes adam in a body of flesh and then takes out even a body of flesh to reproduce adam because she was woman man with the womb but where was mary's womb involved men's natural womb was not involved until her spiritual wound was contacted first same way with eve satan knew if he could get eve to listen to what he said listen to what he said that he by her emotion would do exactly what she did and god knew it too but he couldn't stop her because he she wouldn't be a female agent amen listen god don't stop you from doing things he puts the word in front of you he puts the word in front of you and then what'd brother brown say so you gotta walk over calvary to get to hell crawl over calvary to get to hell so you and and think about that every person that comes to the white throne judgment he'll tell them the day the hour i came to you and you turned me down so therefore you go that way but oh what about that time though when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost you didn't just receive the new birth you received the judge [Music] because the saints will judge angels the saints will judge the world and when you look in revelations 21 or 2 it says that there we were and the books were open and we were all standing there and everybody was judged out of that book you and i we're not judged out of that book we are the book we are the book the eternal section that nobody can touch you you listen if you're born again you're not foolish virgin you're not a cup of water in my name you're not you already have eternal life and that seed remains in you and you cannot sin why god can't make go god can't make you sin brother brother said if we sin we sin on our own he said we have to go out to the devil if we're going to sin right let's stay behind the word of god but that law of reproduction i want you to think about that we have been regenerated and regenered by the baptism of the holy ghost you are a different person you're a new creature i'm quoting scripture you're a new creation in christ old things have passed away behold all things have become new we're sitting in heavenly places do you know that soul that you got is not sitting in this world it's just caught by what's on the outside because of the law of reproduction your mom and daddy got you here and then god come down one day and said hey you're a part of my family i want you to be a part of my family no he didn't say that he said you are a part of my family he said i just want you to realize that and then what do you do you say what brother brown said papa god be it unto me according to thy word nothing involved but the womb of your mind accepting the seed word of god this is the only seed god's got he don't have natural seed he has he's a spiritual seed the spoken word is the original seed please get that in in you and you'll understand what what we're doing we're trying to understand where we came from because ask a person on the street i'm sorry ask a person on the street where'd you come from they're going to save my mom and daddy you're saying no where did your life come from your life didn't come from your mom and daddy your mama produced that you dated produced the the uh sperm and your mama produced the egg and you had a body that came here but where'd your life come from oh it just it just somehow it now come on but you and i you and i somebody i wish somebody would ask me that question i'd take them back to genesis 1 26. and i'd say right there is where i came from that's why i'm doing here and that's where i'm going back to we're the only people that know that nobody in this world they've walked through this world just oblivious to where they came from or even where they're going but you and i don't because we have a purpose we are the true church that understands what we're doing here when we do that we'll be an invincible army let's sing a song god bless you [Music] heaven are open the blessings are falling tonight what page is it [Music] i like this song everything right listen to this i gave him my old time i want you to [Music] [Applause] [Music] and that's why i'm happy tonight listen now oh the windows of heaven are open the blessings are falling tonight for there's joy joy joy in my heart for jesus makes everything right i gave him my old tighter [Music] [Applause] and that's why i'm happy tonight the windows of heaven lord the blessings [Music] we pray that you'd touch him now amen he gave me that's why i'm happy tonight the first time i heard that song was it brother claude they sing it all the time it's just so neat the windows of heaven open jesus makes everything right i gave him my old tattered garment what's the old tattered garment this thing right here and he gave me a robe of pure white i'm feasting today i'm eating the food the spiritual food in due season i'm feasting today on the manna and that's why i'm happy tonight oh listen folks i'm telling you this the world has given us a pressure but god told us that we could take this pressure he told us we were built for this we were astronauts we were built for the pressure of the day and satan is a liar he can't tell the truth he can twist it but what's going on in the world today take it positive because it's moving us to get out of here amen and i was thinking you know when they said about brother dale on different ones well if you know you go ahead and have the thing get it over with ain't going to happen no more and he's fine there's no problem everything's good same way with all the other brothers and sisters everything's good just things that we have to go through because we do still live under the curse but greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world so we pray that the overcoming power of god will take over and that we'll walk in the light of the world and of the word of god and feast on the manna because look what else is left what else have we got we can't depend on the government we can't depend on our doctor we can't depend on the hospital we can't depend on the health care system we can't depend on the economy [Music] who are we going to depend on brother um darny for all your life you've depended on god so we just need to keep dependent on god depend on him he's the one that gives life he's the one to give you breath and he's the one that's going to sustain you until your walk's done and we're praying that our walk will walk us right out of here and that we don't have to go by the grave if we don't go by the grave guess what we have overcome everything there's not a disease that's going to bother us there's not a coronavirus strong enough unless god's finished with us [Music] and i don't believe god's finished with brother dale i don't believe he's finished with none of us amen because we have a purpose for being here i believe we all do everybody you have a purpose you everybody has a purpose in this building to do what proclaim the fruit of the seed that was planted in you at your new birth and if it come from god it's going back to god amen that's why you are god's your god made manifest in another form called bride we got to realize that we got to realize that oh i'm feasting today and that's why i'm happy tonight [Music] joy
