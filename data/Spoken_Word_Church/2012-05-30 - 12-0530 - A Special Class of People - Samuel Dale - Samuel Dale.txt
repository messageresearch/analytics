word and father we love you and we thank you and forgive our sins mainly because that's where we want to stand compl complete in you and have nothing between my soul and my savior as the song goes and let everything be right we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 1 through3 is the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by a record of the word of God and the test of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of the prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you remember years ago I preached on that I believe the time is at hand to understand this is the day and the hour to understand you may be seated Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we said we we're going to try to get over to and uh mainly see what I'm doing if you'll catch it and watch it you'll see that we've already done what I'm going to do when I get over Revelations 5 so then if you watch what's this is not just play pry messages you know this is getting ready to be able to understand Revelations 5 and what I want to see for this day and the hour and if you'll listen and check what's being said now you'll see then what the truth of it really comes out to be all right now I'll just give you that in advance where you can do it all right we've talking about there uh this past Sunday on the This Book of Revelations and how that it was a revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John and and he delivered that down uh By An Angel and brought it to John and then it was to be brought unto you and I and we covered and just saying a few words about it that man kind couldn't understand the Book of Revelations until this end time when God would send the prophet yeah to understand you you see writings of the things and all but see the Book of Revelation was actually written uh in ad 95 and 96 or therea you know and uh so that way uh the writings of the other books were of the gospels and then some of Paul's writings earlier than that so basically everything would have been about finished and then that would have been the last writing you know the finishing of of the Apostles and things of their thoughts so then the Book of Revelations I've told you to me is a very special book but what's made it special is that God gave us the ability to understand it that's what makes it special to me all right and then it would would be there in the Book of Revelations would be the bride's book because it would be speaking about the bride and I will mention this basically every message and then you'll see when it fits in what we're talking about that nowhere in the Book of Revelation do you see Jesus by himself you see him in in Bride form or you see him with the bride like say Revelation 19 coming back riding you know with him and and things but you never see in the Book of Revelation anywhere that it's speaking just of Jesus and him by himself it's it's the it's the book to show us the future that would come to pass and you know and we could see those things and and have an understanding said then it would be our book for this enti and very special then to you and I to where that we can follow that book but we we got down to seeing that the Book of Revelation is one of the books that Satan hates he hates the Book of Genesis and he hates the Book of Revelations because it shows his beginning and it shows his end all right we covered that Sunday trying to to emphasize a little bit about it if Satan tries to tell you that you're lost just tell him no way in the world he'd ever be saved you could get a a white Throne judgment but he can't get it there's no white Throne judgment for Satan we could go there you know and do things but I don't want to but I mean it's just that way he he's lost out totally and and what I like about it is that even that the Satan and the f prophet and the Beast and is cast into the Lake of Fire before everything else is so it's going he's going to be annihilated one day and he hates that and he tries to discredit the word because he knows that as we were getting down to the end that if a bride gets a revelation of who she is all right and really of the two Spirits among the church and I told you then you go and you look at across the the message thing and you you'll see that there's uh definitely two Spirits at work right because any spirit that denies that Jesus Christ is com in the flesh is Antichrist and then when you see people off the word that it does not compare with Hebrews 13:8 then you know for short that that that's the other spirit all right so then the the thing of it is Satan will always attack the word amen right that's that's his way uh he doesn't care how much you shout and how much anointings you have and how much you know the moving of the spirit among you and the the different things he doesn't care about that right he's right in there with it he loves that himself he he likes to rejoice and have a good time but he's against the word being revealed right right and that's where I've always said to the people and you know it that why is people afraid of the seals uh the Daniel 70 weeks the the things you know uh that they want in in any way most of the time even attempt to speak on let alone anything else is to do you know they'll just uh pass it off I remember one church and some of you with our you know that they thought that well boy this brother is going to preach on the seals and he's going to play the tapes and he's going to preach on the seals what he did he played the tapes and and then he just went right on with his regular messages you know because I guess it didn't mean anything but he said you've heard the seals you know and all but that's fine that's well and good but I don't believe that's for you and I right that's all right maybe for somebody else that's that's fine that's that's good uh some people likes to eat some odd exotic foods but I kind of like to taste it and see whether I want it or not and don't just put it down there all at once and PMA plate up with it I'll get a little bit and try it because I I'm not the one to be gullible you know on all things all right but now there two Spirits we ended up by doing that brother R said one of them was the Holy Spirit we know that the other one is the Antichrist and don't look for the Antichrist in the last days to be like we've always thought you know I remember my brother-in-law was talking about the that the Beast would be a great big animal you know and it would just you know across the Earth and and to everybody and everybody worshiped it and stuff like that well it it's got to be something religious right it can't be just something uh you know a great big Monument of some form or some man or some point it's got to be a spirit that's there to create to make those people believe those things and express it you know in their own doings but then that way he hates the Book of Revelations because it shows his beginning and we went through that of this this Des scripture to show you there where it's the Deeds of the nians that was his beginning in the The Book of Revelations you know now we know he was there but I mean just giving a point that was his beginning of the Deeds of the nicians to conquer the Ley all right now you see that still prevalent among the ministers you know uh that they try to conquer the Ley by saying if you don't believe what I believe then you know do what you want to uh you're lost if you leave and that's the way a lot of people are told that if they leave the the certain churches they're lost well I've never told anybody that and the only thing I've ever said to anybody that leaves if you find any more word anywhere else than what we have here let me know I want to go with you right and that's a serious matter or get those people to come here you know to to give us understand standing to what we can do all right but now remember the point then the Book of Revelations will show the bride right right and that's Christ in the church and we'll read it in a minute that brother R said that Christ in the church was a continuation of the book of Acts right all right now we'll pick up where we read the last quote and get our thought for tonight you know of where uh that we were at so if you have the uh number five on the the board and some of you that didn't maybe keep yours we we didn't run off any to give you an extra copy tonight U you know but uh sister Julie you you just have to read the ones you took home when you get there okay all right but we just didn't run anymore cuz we just had all of these and then we'll pick up here all right now let's pick up the thought from where we left off on there on Sunday afternoon and continue there on with it all right this is page 16 of the church age book The revelation of Jesus Christ all right now watch you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church now I I may I say it the best way that could be possible and I hope you understand it especially of people out there cuz you haven't heard me speak in the way I do speak I don't believe the Book of Revelations now listen added any great uh understanding of the godhead now listen to what I'm saying now very careful I believe Paul and him covered the godhead in the basis of where it was to be and the things and and that's why brother Brandon would go back and read those things to to reference from there and speak on that and you know he would do that now what I mean is all right see now what I mean by the point that what the book Book of Revelations does is show you where Christ is right right not as much as showing you a a a deeper Revelation except for the point of where he's at I think that's the depth of the Book of Revelations and I think that's the greatest thing that could ever be thought of that would be the Capstone revelation of the entire Bible would to be and to see that God would uh finally in finality reveal himself in his church all right and that you would see the church the bride not the world church now the bride all right you would see it in Bride form and that would be the Capstone of the entire Bible right all right and it would be that that even Paul and them understanding the godhead see look at Paul to come and to say that he was the uh you know Immortal Eternal almighty God and being who he was he would know the correct understanding of the Hebrew uh terminologies and do logos theophany uh whatever words would would come down he would know that all right and see brother randam come and stood upon what he said but to me the the Book of Revelations and you'll see this now when you get into Revelations 5 that the the the seals is the revealing Christ in the church that's where people are looking for the wrong way see Christ in his bride upon the Earth all right now that even Paul would speak of but not be able to comprehend and I don't mean that wrongly cuz you know what I'm saying see but we look for this message to bring us some kind of a um an understanding that was not in the Bible right we look for some Supernatural revelation that would not be in the book and then we try to make it to seven seal mystery you know and make it something that nobody had no idea well I don't agree with that never have never taught it that way and don't agree with it I believe it's more showing where he's at and what's taking place than it is to try trying to bring us some uh great Revelation they said to brother Rand said with your ability you could write a 23rd chapter you know Revelation he said see they was trying to trap me he said but you can't add to the word right so the Book of Revelations would not be adding to the writing of the other Apostles that would be a mysterious hidden secret coded something until you come in the end time and the prophet would tell us these things it would be what it's already spoken about well now if that's misunderstood I I tried I didn't mean to speak that way about it but uh that's a little premature to what I want to speak about 6 months down a row all right but I want you to think about it so look what he's saying now it's the Revelation this the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church now and his work in the future ages now what did I mention that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation or we'll fail to get it right all right now the Bible cannot be understood except the Holy Spirit be there to reveal right now no man can call Jesus Christ excepted be by the Holy Ghost all right baptism of the Holy Ghost okay now so then it's it's not a book it's not something added that's a secret coded it it's the actual showing where he's at and what's taking place all right I hope you're following the point now on that if not write down a thought on it and we'll talk about it see he said it takes a holy spirit to give us Revelation or we failed to get it now bringing these two thoughts together you'll see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can be revealed this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people now that's what I'm talking about tonight a special class of people the the titles will be for until we get there it'll be uh a study on the Book of Revelations but then we'll give you secondary titles all right now watch what he says it can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people all right right it will take one with prophetic insight right and now immediately when you're reading that your mind pulls into to the point of yes the prophet came he's got the prophetic Insight thank God that's what I've just said it couldn't be understood had God not sent us a prophet right there was no way to understand the Book of Revelations had God not sent a prophet unto us amen and we're definitely not not looking for another when to come are thinking that we're something we're telling you what the prophet said of course right everybody that's got a Doctrine says they're saying what the prophet says well all right one day that'll be decided right and that'll be finished so we don't have no problems you know we just walk on down the road believing what we believe all let the Holy Spirit reveal it see a special class of people it'll take one word prophetic Insight yeah but we're not prophets brother Dale no but we're in a prophetic age like I said Sunday why is the Eagles over everybody's door why is this called like an eagle age when even the world testifies because it's a prophetic age right now so you got your four combat Beast as we'll get back to later in what the line the ox the man the eagle all right everybody then wants to say the line was the word down in the ear Church ages do all the people the ox was the spirit of God among all the peoples the man was the spirit of God among all the people but then when you say eagle and brother Bram only like the brother said if you say you believe that Mark 16 is to be made manifest you're in bad shape he said because that's only for brother randam and the Lord Jesus now I wouldn't say that if I had heard the man say it but the point is see how could you make him Hebrews 13:8 right see then you see why people are just sitting waiting on a bus to pull up or they're sitting waiting on Ro ROM to come back driving the bus you to pick us up instead of believing and getting ready because how would you know what bus to get on cuz you better believe Satan's going to drive a bus up if that's what you think but if you don't know what the prophet has taught how are you going to know what he would teach if he did come back I man that's where I've always been that way I'm looking for him to to profit to raise one day and he can preach to us for 30 40 days I said that to you over and over but somebody's got to get him out of the Grave right so that's our job right to get into the faith sure don't look like it well exactly the way it is you can't see it without the holy spirit amen thank you now that's my whole point of tonight that you cannot I cannot we cannot comprehend the Bible without the Holy Spirit it takes a holy spirit to interpret that word unto us he said brother R interpret it well why is there so much problems with it right come on I'm as open as can be about what I say why is there so many different versions and splits among the people of the message if it was solely brother brandom was to tell us what it is I mean we got the books we got the the tapes what's the problem see but the problem is that people who say that don't mean what they're saying right right but see this is the age of the eagle age this is the prophetic age where do we get to it in the minut where the Prophet said the Holy Ghost came on a zeusa street in a great prophet now he call the Holy Spirit on the day of ausus streets 1906 the great prophet then the messenger was to come after them and see that's the basis of what I want you to see tonight see if you don't believe the holy spirit is here like it was on the day of Pentecost then how can you understand the Book of Revelation cuz you can't even understand the book of Acts without the Holy Spirit Come on right you can't understand Matthew Mark Luke and John without the Holy Spirit they're still arguing over whether the where Jesus said the the kingdom is within they're still arguing whether it was in him or in the people or somewh sitting out there Earth they can't get all that figured out they're still arguing over it but see church it's going to take a special people right we were chosen for this job amen I like that where he saved the best theas you know I have 13 kids I was a li one daddy save the best for Li but you see Church Why Can't We Believe well we don't want to get too exalted in ourselves don't you worry about getting exalted that's what a brother tell me one time I had corrected this brother and he said you better be careful about correcting that brother I said why why be careful about correcting him if he's wrong well you know how it is you could get all them demons all them spirits and to bother you I said don't worry about they plenty of them around they plenty of them bother me now I ain't worried about the rest as but think about it now a special class pull it back up brother I don't never know who's back there so now I'm going to start saying brother one of the sisters go back there I'll get in problem CU I can't never remember who's doing it thank God for all these brothers I do thank God for you there on the internet section if it wasn't for them you wouldn't have it I was going to announce something I forgot okay we're going to start as of Sunday playing about 8 to 10 minutes of music mus when they singing now now the singing will start right on 10:00 every who's going about: or whatever you'll start at 2:00 you'll start at 7:00 singing no singing we're just going to play and and do that now if you get happy in the Lord and worship that's fine all right but see the one reason is and I asked brother Joe to make sure see I had watched brother Pinkston we did the other night to see the brother that was preaching our Saturday and uh you know they started about 15 20 minutes early and just play that was fine that was good people coming in and all like that but my point was as I'd forgotten i' asked brother Joe I said uh when do you start putting this on on internet you know to go on live streaming or every how you say that I can't never get it streaming or Screaming most of the time I'm screaming and they're streaming I guess but sounds the same to me but anyhow I asked you and he said well we we put that at 9:45 they start as quick as that video camera set up it it is on internet so that gives people an opportunity and that's what I was doing see I didn't know exactly how to get all this brother Joe and him had set it up to where I could get the the things but I'm still I'm sorry I'm a dummy so I called Brother Ray to make sure to find out and the reason I wanted to start early just say that so is see I figured it' take me 15 minutes to get the thing on you know I'd have to call him did I do this I do this I do this I do this I do this he yeah do this now you done that wrong you know all so I wanted to know and see brother Joe puts it on 15 minutes early every when that camera goes up it comes on 15 minutes early and that way people connecting on has a 15minute gap period that they can connect so we're going to have the playing 10 minutes early and then start to singing right on the period of time you know not sitting now and and you musicians and things don't start singing singing with it unless the congregation starts singing now if the congregation and I don't mean one person I mean the congregation starts joining in that's fine we all join in together that's okay but you know just having the the live music is what I'm wanting to do and also while I'm at it there is some announcement here from KS division about the camps and a testimony of a boy in here uh that was converted in a camp meeting and things and if you want these make sure you get them after service okay we get back back to where we were thank you huh now watch what it says it will take one with prophetic Insight now a special class of people with prophetic Insight people that have the ability to receive now you say well what makes us any different than anybody else it don't make us any different we'll get to that it's been the Holy Ghost in every Church age it's always been the Holy Spirit if it's not where's Hebrews 13:8 coming at that's right see you would would you would mess up with that one scripture it's always been the holy spirit in every church has everybody had a new birth had the Holy Spirit CU that is the new birth all right see then in doing that then it ends in the end time with a special people to when they receive the Holy Spirit and how the message to be able to get into the word no one ever had to message brother Joe had a good point the other day you notice it says in the voice of the the seventh angel you know when it begins to sound and see there's never been an age that they had a voice of their messenger now they may have had a little something because they was old systems back there of maybe but I'm talking about even the great Billy gram you don't have uh all of the messages he ever preached so it's something that God has captivated and made it into a voice a voice to where we can hear it see like those people said you know on the the TV thing about the the uh brother brand and everything there from Indiana you know and they said well you know they still play them same old tapes over and over well I thought Brother Joseph done a good job in his actually back to him we haven't heard any more from it I don't know but Brother Joseph said well we still read that same old Bible over and over and over I thought that's a good point you know that was good see but that won't go won't go in our way they'll cut off all they they will you know to do it but watch now I maybe not preached enough to get you settle down to listen what I'm talking about but one with prophetic Insight I believe the bride has to have prophetic Insight that's right I believe the baptism of the holy ghost that comes into the bride of Christ cuz this is the only age that we could reach the full maturity of adoption right all right you can come up and down through these ages and the things and the apostles had it right here but they didn't have the headstone now that's what your Prophet said all right he said The Headstone hadn't come yet all right so then the headstone but what is The Headstone I I believe Jesus Christ was The Headstone to you right I believe the headstone was riding on the White Donkey going into Jerusalem right right but who understood that's what it was who understood that was the fulfilling of all the Bible one man walking you know riding on a donkey fulfilling the Bible but who could understand and comprehend and believe that a bride of Christ on the earth in the end time standing with the prophet's message believe it not trying to interpret it or anything but believing it and accepting what's said to come to find out to realize who she is I believe the headstones got to be in the bride in the end time yes sir see we got a long ways to go to get there where I want to talk about it but see we are we are even going to be the anointing according to the prophet that we will be the anointing to the temple that goes into the Millennium you and I the bride will be the anointing but now that'll be all the bride that won't be just the end time bride it be all the right because it's the holy spirit it's always been the holy spirit all right so then what is it now it will require the ability to hear from God okay we got the prophet's message the Holy Spirit to teach us the message teachers in the body of Christ five-fold Ministry to bring her to the Perfection so we have all that is needing that's why it's a special class of people no one else has ever had it like this right all right and the tapes the books to compare it like brother Mo them used to say that they hear Brother brandom he'd say brother Mo was referenced to it one time he said he they heard brother brandom talk about said look at Adam and Eve walking out the garden well you know what they thought Adam and Eve was lost until they got the next message that brother R brought which might have been months before they got the next tape you know but when they got the tape they said see there Adam and Eve going out of the garden but said they had an atonement they wasn't lost amen I see but we have it all we just running the computer you want to know what the prophet said just type it in didn't said start reading all right listen you the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instruction that's something in it Supernatural instruction you don't believe the holy spirit is Supernatural Well that's the only thing that is Supernatural That's right there almighty god listen Supernatural instruction what's not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but her M requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know all right now special class of people so nobody can't take your place Paul had his place Iranians Martin Columbo those people down through there had their places brother brother R never tried to take FF bosler's place he always gave him honor and Glory CAU him the old shade tree know one man there you know got converted said go sit under the old sh Tree on Divine Healing he said the man know more about Divine Healing anybody some way something close to it anybody he know of was FF B brother never tried to take his place he didn't try to take Billy Graham or or Robert's place he didn't go after the multi-million dollar buildings and schools and things to to put them in there and pop out preachers to to deliver this message that's what old Robert's done right send them to school all but you see he settled down with one thing the word right right amen yes sir and when he did he comes out with that one thing the holy spirit because the holy spirit will always come to the word okay all right now as we start our point this is what we're talking about I believe the Holy Spirit has been the spirit that gave birth to every individual in any church age whatsoever my wife always said years ago it is not the spirit of God that was eaten down show me that anywhere in the prophet's message or in the Bible now that's an open challenge to the world come all right I'll admit it and go with brother ROM he said it's been trampled on sure has he talking about the Holy Spirit but there's nowhere where the Holy Spirit was ever taken away the word was what was eat down then had to be restored right brought back would the Holy Spirit had to be restored it was the Holy Spirit that revealed to Martin Luther that to just shall live by faith this the Holy Spirit has been there in every age so now let's just pick up a few and watch what is the holy spirit well brother Dale uh you know who is the prophet let me answer that people would say William Mary and Brandon right but who's the prophet simple question for him to be Hebrews 13:8 now who's the prophets so go ahead and pull up the next one and watch this is off the message 6 65725 the anointed ones the end time paragraph 98 99 on 100 the holy spirit is the prophet of this hour right now who's the prophet of the hour he of vindicating his word proving it the Holy Spirit was the prophet of Moses hour the Holy Spirit was the prophet of Mah's hour The Holy Spirits which wrote the word comes and confirmed the word all right now who is the prophet that was to be looked for in the end time I told you about it years ago and going off on the brother that's fine that's whatever believes but brother M brought this brother over to house and we were sitting out on the front porch and and uh we started talking and brother Mo said to the brother said just tell brother D what you believe the brother said yes said I believe that Malachi 4 is coming okay what else you believe he said well he said what I believe is that John the Baptist brought John the B just into it that he was Malachi 4 I said well who was Malachi 3 he was all confused and what I found out that he finally believed and he maybe even hear this tonight he sometimes he canect on evidently because they showed up in a in a a Bible study we having one time and the only way could have known it was an announced but anyhow he said well don't you believe brother brand no let let me get it right what he said he said brother Brandon was Malachi 3 let me get that right Malachi 3 said he was Maliki 3 I said well I thought that was John the Baptist you know and then brother Brown would be Miki 4 he said no no no said said brother Brown was Miki 3 I said in other words you're saying that somebody else to come he said yeah well see I didn't know it but it was told later he finally as he believes he was that one to come you well that's what I told him I said I'll just tell you to your face said I didn't know it's what he believed but I said If You Think You're Malachi 4 I just tell you you ain't him that's right I said even if brother Bram would have been Malachi 3 the one brother brandom was looking to come was the Lord Jesus Christ he said what about the great one I said that is a great one the Lord Jesus Christ brother R pointed to a great one to come the Lord Jesus Christ but he told you about Malachi 4 and where it was at in his ministry John the Baptist of Miki 3 well of course it didn't change his mind it ain't going to change yours or anybody else listening out there of what they believe it's not going to change what I say but there's one thing about it they will day a day that these things will face awful of us right amen sir Now who is the prophet of this power the Holy Spirit right now remember in Revelations 1910 go ahead brother I think he's got it on there CU we had these on him if you'll just fall it down Revelations 19:10 and says I fell at his feet to worship and said unto him see thou do it not am thy fellow I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus Christ worship God for the testimony of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy that's Revelations 19:10 the testimony that Jesus Christ is a spirit of Prophecy all right so then who are we looking for to come and take over the Holy Spirit right not another messenger not another person to come along you know with an anointing of Elijah or something the next Elijah that is to come according to my understanding will be one of the two witnesses to Israel all right cu that'll be number five to finish it all up but the thing of what I want you to see tonight is one thing for certain now this is my whole point now you can differ with me whatever you want to do believe or not believe but if we do not have the new birth as it was on the day of Pentecost then we don't have the new birth right simple we don't have it we don't have it they don't need interpreting you know I liked it Sunday that sister would here visiting went outside and I tried to get her to write it down blood she she tried to get her husband prick his finger and he wouldn't do it but she said brother Dale said that was the most simple thing she said I can understand you I said would you mind writing that down where I can read it everybody says I'm some kind of an intellect seual he said well it wouldn't said I understood what you were talking about I thought okay that's good you know all right but listen God is the prophet even Jesus himself in the line of what he was doing he was born Lord the Christ the Messiah now he couldn't go and die for you right there right right 2 3 years old no no way all right you had to wait to a place to enter a Ministry and to bring forth the things and the River Jordan Etc and all of that now well then him being born Lord the Christ he could have prophesied at 2 or 3 years of age might have seen Visions at 2 or 3 years of AG brother around here but he didn't enter a prophetic Ministry form or style until the River Jordan right so then there was where he literally came into being as the son of man the prophet if You' ask Jesus are you the prophet he'd say God is the prophet I am a prophet I a man that God is using right brother random was not the prophet he was a prophet that's right it was a man that God was using to bring us to work if you make him the prophet he would be God so then you see how close you're going CU I know all the quotes I can quote with you anybody out there come on I know brother random would say about Moses said he was God to the people which you better quote that correctly he said while he's delivering his message but said when he stepped back he was Moses right so you better keep it straight I believe brother Brandon when he was speaking I believe that was almighty God voicing through a man when he said on marriage and divorce go home as you are everything I believe that was the voice of God right but that wouldn't brother R he couldn't say that until the holy spirit said to say it all right the prophet of the day is the holy spirit all right now let's get this in the right order so go ahead and pull up number seven on the notes brother this is take from questions and answers on the seals 1963 324 I love this quote cuz it ties together the entire Bible and thinking you see each one of those ages only take a dip took a dip only taken a dip into the Holy Spirit justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit right now watch it that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down now see everybody reads that and say that's brother brand you you better read on I was listen that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down no Messenger to the age what he talking about zeusa street right because the Holy Ghost came himself in its fullness of the baptism that was on zeusa street but at the end of the age and it always ends upon the others we find there then the messenger sent there brother brown right and these Scruples and things were in a Rapture come for the church all no messenger of the age cuz the Holy Ghost came himself now the the oneeyed black man Seymour that his name daddy Seymour see right now even brother Brown said he was the messenger to the lady of CN now he called him that if you want that quote I'll be glad to find it but he said really was no messenger that's what he's explained there was no Messenger on the zeusa street you said but that was just gifts brother Dale that was the Holy Spirit right come on when they got all script that's not the holy spirit's problem that got all scrupled that wasn't him that made it scrupled come on it was the people right the Holy Spirit never brought the Scruples the Holy Spirit hadn't brought all the Scruples around this message that's right but yet everybody says the Holy Spirit or God told them this great Revelation I got you know well if it won't compare with the rest of the word what is it supposed to be if it won't say Hebrews 13:8 that he's the same yesterday today and forever then it cannot be of the spirit of God it must be that Antichrist Spirit we were talking about a while ago well you saying these people no I'm saying the spirit that's motivating them that's guiding people I'm not against people it's the spirit that's guiding them right look what he says now on this that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down no Messenger to the age because the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism he's talking about what let's do this Street go right back up read it but the baptism is the Holy Spirit you got justification you got sanctification and then you got isusa Street baptism of the Holy Ghost all right if you'd read sometimes about isusa Street I've tried to tell you many many people don't even think about it that was theusa Street was trinitarians that was not the Oneness Doctrine the Oneness Doctrine started about 1912 somewhere in there and as it started they started throwing Rotten Tomatoes at them the ones who claim to be Aus the street Originals why because they didn't believe they were trinitarians right so if the Holy Spirit could call on fall on trinitarians and give them the new birth you say you can't do it I wish you hadn't said that I want to ask for a raise of Hands by ask how many here has the baptism of the Holy Spirit me and 90% of you got it before you come to the word or the message right so you better back off your statements right right but you see Luther's justification was a work of the holy spirit that was the new birth of their age brother Rand even calls Wesley sanctification New Birth of sanctification then the baptism of the Holy Ghost came on zeusa street he said come in his fullness you argue the point of what you know you say well that's what the messenger within I don't want that part well that's what I said the other day about marriage and divorce you want marriage and divorce the grace and you'll gladly hold on to that with all you can stand because you needed it but then when it comes to the rest of the message well I don't believe that well I wouldn't believe the marriage and divorce then right because if it's Antichrist what he taught in one place come on if he didn't teach it correctly and it would be Antichrist it would be Antichrist in the marriage and divorce Grace right come on that's sensible but you see that's where people are well now I've preached this to you before so it's not a new thing not a new doctorine idea that the baptism of the Holy Ghost that came on isusa Street the prophet of God said I met people with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was preaching way before he come on the scene he said with a baptism of the Holy Ghost just like on the day of Pentecost now you see where the trouble is at is what I've always tried to explain to you if you take the upper room experience experience of the 120 and say ausa street was a restoration of the upper room experience of the 120 that had the faith of the fathers you got a problem I'll agree with you there that's not correct but you see on the day of Pentecost there was two things happened the upper room fell on 120 that had been tutored for three and 1/2 years right that's why they could teach us to become into their ways of do it that's why novice was not chosen to write the word you know a baby a beginner right but then the scripture says that when you and I receive the holy spirit it's an Earnest right so then the 3,000 outside 120 been tutored for three and 1/2 years but the 3,000 outside had only heard one sermon basically and they got born again there's your Holy Spirit in a new birth there's why a prophet could say of zeusa street was the baptism of the Holy Ghost we have it just like the book of Acts see because that's where it's written about out of the Holy Spirit coming in the book of Acts you said that's just your idea I've been through that don't worry about it don't it don't offend me for you to think that had a great great brother friend of mine at least I thought he was but that's what he told me one day he said you ain't nothing but a badst you have to been there to know what I talking about he said you just figured it out intellectually in other words you can calculate upper room and that's down here and then you can make a discourse to explain the difference in the two well you go ahead and do what you want do with it but let's hear your definition that's open to the public let's hear your definition ain't going to argue with you about it send me a note but listen church either the prophet's right or something's messed up somewh right now then let's read a few quotes what brother random says about this baptism of the Holy Spirit right and I want you to notice we'll be going early Ministry later Ministry early Ministry later Ministry so that you won't come up with the idea that he changed his mind after the opening of the seals but remember on the opening of the uh on the future home he said I've taught three processes from the beginning as a boy it's all right all solves a problem case ended go ahead to the next go ahead to number eight this taken 1954 8:14 the unconditional Covenant that God made with the people e44 what a beautiful picture of God making his Covenant with the church when Jesus Christ went to Calvary who was God Emmanuel God ripped him apart at Calvary toward the Covenant in two took the body up to his right hand and sent the Holy Ghost back on the church and The Same Spirit was on Jesus Christ is in the church today and the same holy ghost that was back there has to be the same Holy Ghost when we come together making Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and today we have the same baptism that they had on Pentecost when our part of the Covenant was thr thrown back you believe iten he said we have the same baptism so now every how you want to take what I said about trying to help you understand the uh the existence or whatever took place on the day of Pentecost you can't deny the quote right and it's no good to say well I don't know there's no excuse for that that's right not in this day all right now watch these as we go along look at number nine a this was an added one to our today in the church age book there is a section that's when it starts in the samon church age um somewhere about page 13839 or something it says the holy spirit in ever AG then it starts talking about it so watch what he says this is this is page 143 the Samaran Church age which is church age book all in every age and every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer right never age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer okay so is the Holy Ghost in every age all right now I didn't give them this one to give to you but on the uh Taran Church age 1960 1204 1208 paragraph 73 brother Randon said in other words I've been studying it he's went through and he's talking about Methodist Baptist uh and all like that he says I've been days and days now those his histories digging them into all I can find everywhere and it's the flame of Pentecost that stayed alive from Pentecost down to this time yes sir it's been pushed out it was a holy spirit never aged right all right so that's what he's saying here now he goes into the evidence then those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and there were the group that heard the message of his age and took it and lived it now if you go on reading through you'll see that he's telling you what that that group that Holy Spirit is the teacher that is the same evidence in never Church age every Church agent got the same evidence right what whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word right right the teacher inside of you teaching you the word that's the evidence of the holy spirit all right now keep that in mind so all right on to number nine now which is U acts of the Holy Spirit 1954 1219 paragraph 66 the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost of today I'll admit it's been tramped on made fun of misinterpreted misrepresented and everything else like that that's only the devil counterfeiting listen to it but there is a real genuine baptism of the holy spirit that brings the same results that they had on the day of Pentecost that's right and you say well where's your signs and wonders people that's what they'll say where's your signs and wonders well come up this church I invite you here you want to see where signs and wonders has been here or not and let's just let a few of these people that sitting here talk to you that's right not about little things that are I've heard people years ago call the third pool because somebody come along and pay their taxes well I'm just as honest as I'll ever be you go out here and go walking down through the city of Gainesville and you stay up there long enough and you'll find somebody that you can talk in to pay your taxes cuz you'll reach some heart that'll pay them for you is that the third pool now that's a sorry lazy bum it won't work problem solved you going to call those things I'm not talking about those kind of things I'm talking about sick heel dead raised right storm spoken out of existence rain call far and come didn't talk about my own Ministry around St you don't come around tell me in the days of Miracles and P I got a quote in here in a minute if I have time I want to read it would you see it's the Holy Spirit he said it's been trampled on right because people's misunderstood it they misinterpreted it you know they misrepresented theyve done all kind of things with it zeusa Street yes was a great example but the Holy Ghost it fell was the Holy Ghost that's right it was genuine it was real am they were the ones that made it speaking in tongues right they were the ones that made it those things but I've got a book at home that wait is his if if you want to read some it's these are testimonies of people if you want to read it not supposed to be something of any but testimonies of people that said didn't say that it was don't lay it all this on speaking in tongue daddy SE more said that he said don't put it just start speaking in tongue he said this is Jesus Christ he were sure there was fanaticism went with all that why because it wasn't our come on one more time I love it like this what kind of fanaticism was you in before you heard the truth don't make light of nobody whether you want to call that hateful or arrogant or whatever you might ought to call it the Holy Spirit don't make fun of nobody in their beliefs because remember we had a right sir see I don't like you brother that's Praise of God I don't like me either but the truth is the truth right amen right it's time to stand on that brother said I'll be glad when it comes a time they'll say you ain't saying what Paul said well why not come on what's number nine acts of the Holy Spirit paragraph page paragraph 66 did I read that one have I done read that one yes I'm down on I've done read that okay go up to the next okay this is the the message of the lady CN Church age 1958 609 paragraph E43 we've had enough life to join Church build an organization to find churches we've had that for 2,000 years but God promised in the evening time it would be light and what is the same light that fell on the Orient the same holy ghost that fell at Pentecost bringing the same results is falling on the western people today bringing the same results it brought back there it'll be lighted that was what I was trying my best to express our Sunday I know you don't understand me I kept repeating over and over and over and over we brother around was talking talking about Sunday morning morning work no Divine Healing no Resurrection no Divine Healing no Resurrection in the time of the greatest worldwide Revival that the man could stand and guantee you healing for 24 cases and he was the one saying it no Divine Healing no Resurrection oh he just throwing off on everybody else your business I'm just saying it was in those years that he was saying those times when he saying the same the Holy Ghost was it just in his ministry you know that he prayed for a man's nose to be restored and it was two or 3 days before it restored and he told I don't know where it was brother Bosworth believe it's right I'm getting a head shaking out of it as brother bosor prayed for one and it was immediately who was it Smith Wigglesworth that Wade was talking about the other day that seen 11 12 or 13 people raised from the dead one man had already been inbombed one man had no legs and no feet and Smith I've read that in the history readon I knew when he was saying that I've read it in his own books I got it the house he told a man to go down and buy him a pair of shoes the man didn't believe it that much he just took him down there right told him give him a pair of shoes he didn't even have no feet right but when they set the shoes down the foot came down brother Mo said he was sitting when I may miss it my believe it was a alen I don't know about that but I know brother Mo told me that he was sitting in this this Minister a Pentecostal Minister and this man's leg was one shorter than the other well you know you can do that and fake it I okay brother Mo said when he said bow your head he said I didn't bow mine I wanted to see he said I sat there and looked and he said that leg grow out just straight As H those things were real Church those people believe God and great healings and signs and wonders took place that's get with dick brother dick there and talk about the method that's going over in the jungles over there and the people being raised from the dead but you see we don't want to believe we don't believe it's the same Holy Spirit go to the next one this would be the rejected King 196 610 paragraph 55 and the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost which we all know that that was the birth of the new church if that same Holy Spirit don't bring the same experience to you then you've got a different Holy Spirit than what that was that's as blun as can be right that's right exactly right if it don't make you live a sacrificial life and a and a life full of joy and pleasure and the baptism of the spirit leading you into signs and wonders and miracles and things there's something happened Jesus said these signs shall follow them same Holy Spirit go to the next which is believest thou this 19 51:15 e51 how beautiful it is on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell down from heaven our Mana after we've come through the blood and we've been saved been cleansed from our sins and the Holy Ghost fell brother Peter said on the day of Pentecost it is for you and for your children and for them that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and every person that enters into this baptism of the Holy Spirit can have the same kind of holy ghost that they got on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah I believe it's God's truth right okay go to the next this is questions and answers on Genesis watch these two now watch these two quotes real close questions and answers 1953 729 okay he said you will lay hands and ask God to bless us and give us the Holy Ghost okay now he believe he's talking about it you can read the whole thing about it this is about what look what happened and I said I will and we knelt down on the floor and I prayed and laid hands on them now watch and Holy Ghost didn't come immediately read it and about a few weeks after that both of them received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when this doctor redhead receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost come through speaking in other tongues yes sir but them two men didn't receive the Holy Ghost immediately brother rown he said oh what in about a few weeks everybody thinks you lay hand got to be right there immediately that's where you miss it say it's mine I've got it healing Holy Ghost New Birth whatever say mine I've got it don't walk away I didn't get it I didn't feel nothing that's right you didn't get it sensible Sensible what do you feel and I walk away say thank you God thank you I got it I'm Healed thank you I'm Healed thank you I'm saved amen if you few weeks later come to you in middle of the night maybe well what the baptism of the Holy Ghost look at the next one but I said now remember these these two now that first one was he's referring to Dr Reed head in 1953 729 questions and answers on Genesis this is 1964 47 Jehovah J real to paragraph 75 when Morris rehead read ahead a very fine scholar come to my house he received the baptism of the Holy Spirit fell across a little coffee table in the house he said brother Brandon he goes on to explain then he said what have we got all right going backwards and forth in it going to the next Matthew 63 12:16 we have seen his star in the east and come to worship Him paragraph 145 for the promis is unto you and to your children and to them that's far off and as many as the Lord PR of God shall call as many as ever called the same Holy Ghost tonight is just the same it was then to the honest heart if it doesn't is it too unusual for you to believe God if it don't come look at the next influence 1964 215 paragraph 171 that's right here tonight if God is still calling that's the prescription you can still receive the same holy ghost that they receive there you can receive the same thing tonight just follow true that's all you do all right go to the next 17 the Mighty God unveiled before 64629 paragraph 159 and that's right to bring him back exactly like he was at the beginning his same Ministry the same Jesus the Same power the same Holy Ghost the same one that come down on the day p cost is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested today from glory to glory from Glory unto glory to glory and it's back to its original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same sign same Wonder same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power the same sensation is from Glory un glory and next will be changed from this Glory into a body like unto his own glorious body when we shall see him Abraham saw the son like there's two more 65919 a message called thirst paragraph 125 we got a living God not one that died 1900 years ago and stayed in the grave now listen to him see some people believe he was fine already up a few ages but then something happened well he's saying it is not one that died 1900 years ago and stayed in the grave but one that raised again Hebrews 138 say he's this says he's the same yesterday today and forever the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's here now one more now these are not all that on these just some I chose to bring this drops backward then to show you 59405 it was not so from the beginning or E12 and then when someone said says that the word of God does not teach Divine Healing now listen they're saying something that the word does not say okay now what you amen that one now listen to this one and when they say the word does not teach the baptism of the Holy Ghost for believers in all ages they are saying something that the word does not say they're substituting something to take its place oh I'm trying to get you to see tonight is one thing the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been in every age that's right but it finishes in this age in the basis that it is to be a restoration of the original and in this age we are expected to come back to where the apostles were right and everybody that received the new birth of other than the 120 in the upper room received it as a baby Earnest right brother brandom received it as a baby as an Earnest oh no he was a prophet that don't have anything to do with a new birth bam was a prophet and never got it never had it right right anointed ones at the end time can be anointed on their Spirit right amen right not be born again right great signs and wonders can take place but listen if we don't have the new birth like they had in the upper room I mean in the uh the 3000 will'll never come to the upper room experience cuz that's the adoption that's adding to your faith virtue that's what Peter was doing Peter knew the people people that were being birthed under him were babies that's why Paul spent two two whole books First Corinthians 2 Corinthians correcting little babies he never said he wouldn't born again but they were babies he said Desiring the sincere milk of the word as Peter would say if you're born again you're born again as a baby you're not born again at the top of the pyramid right you're born again as a baby that's where the trouble people don't like for me in the way I preach it say bless God when I got it like I told you one brother told me one time said when I got the baptism of Holy Ghost I was adopted manifested son of God right there I don't agree with you I didn't get mad at him I didn't come preach far as I AC to I get mad at other brother said that we didn't have nothing just had an anointing I didn't get mad at him I had him to come preach for me it's kind of hard I Ain never preached to any one of their churches that's all right but you see I still let them come preach Butz I thought you were good Brothers but just remember you're not born again by the new bir birth you know the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth coming into the body of Christ that don't positionally put you at The Headstone just because you're born in this age M no it gives you the new birth the mind of Christ as a baby form and then we must be taught how to come up the stature of a perfect man that's right and to come out where the apostles were then we can talk about the seals the Daniel 70 weeks the things that the prophet brought to us and see that it's not an addition as I started off talking to the Bible it's just an unfolding of the truth that was laying there that light had never shined on those things in the word wasn't something added we don't believe in Revelation but if we don't have the new birth tonight it's not God's fault cuz he's made it known unto us that's right yes but brother Dale how am I going to do because I've confessed all these years that I was born again I did too for 10 years in the Baptist Church become a deacon at 23 years old taught all the Sunday School glasses and everything but when I come in this message I saw I didn't have the new birth well how did you see it because the man that was talking about the Life of Christ the supernatural God was not talking about an intellectual conception or a thought that we had maybe that's why he let me me see him when I was about 11 years old where I realize there was something Supernatural about God but I don't claim that to be my new birth when I come in this message I said I don't have the new birth I got baptized I got straightened up and all of that what little bit I had to get rid of I tried to get rid of it still am trying to get rid of it lot of things we didn't have to get rid of we just we were already controlling our kids in the Baptist Church we left there in 57 we were already controlling what our kids watched on TV before we come in this message tried to walk in the light of the love of God but I knew I didn't have the new birth so i s out I started seing for seeking for God people told me said what do you mean you had to you you was led to the message had to be the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost LED Judas too the Holy Ghost gave Judas a Ministry to raise the dead and heal the sick and cast out Devils that's right make your calling an election sure do you have the new birth the prophet said that's the most important thing in the world if whether or not you're born again amen right what a Val it Church well I don't really know whether I'm born again or not we don't stop seeking God then right amen well if I said if I if I didn't confess I got it you just said want to go I got a confession that's exactly right go confess it but remember there's a difference in a confession and a possession that's right confess it until it becomes a possession and you don't have to worry about it then right it'll be a reality what about it a special class people God chose us in the end time to finish up the work that he gave for us to do R said he didn't finish all of what he came to do he said he allow left that for the bride what that quote left that for you and I to finish we got to conquer get away from that conquering Spirit has tried to conquer us you know conquer the leoty we got to get out m that right we got to get into the word and eat that word until we become the word right I've never said I had all the answers but I tell I've always said I know where to go get them what about it a prophetic people the prophet said one with supernatural abilities to understand what else could you want I want to see this and I want to see that that's that's good but you can't see that until you believe it and get born again now I know this is going to been a very offensive statement and I'm sorry I have to make if I have the Holy Spirit I cannot deny the word right right if you have the Holy Spirit out on the internets or anybody that ever hear this or whatever if you have the Holy Spirit you cannot deny the word amen right it don't make us automatic Giants to where we know everything no it just makes us the children of God I love to watch these little kids as they grow up and watch them and knowing that you think they're sound asleep you think they don't know what in the world's going on you just say something contrary and watch him cor you and tell you what the truth is abig Grace can still tell you the day that Matthew and she's about 2 years old or somewhere close to three but Matthew Ronnie Redlight in where I guess was down in Augusta was somewhere she'll tell you today that Matthew run that red light cuz she saw it but then I told you she told her nanny the other day to quit confessing wrong that was wrong for her to say she wouldn't healed 5 years old now these children are a whole lot smarter than you think they know a whole lot more than you think they know right if you don't think they don't you just don't think they know a lot then the next time that Josiah asks some questions I'm going to give them to you all right I'll let you have them you'll be responsible for that answer that if Jesus created Mary how could Mary be his mother that was a question he asked what 5 years ago four years ago or something been a while back good question and you know that these little children can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes when they reach that age of accountability and that's so adults can deny and walk off the away from they can be the children of God think on these things come on think on these things a special class of people chosen especially for this end time God knowing that he would need a group of people that wouldn't fall for all of these things wouldn't go after all of these doctrines and ideas and opinions and they would just be simple enough to say the prophet said it and I believed it would be that simple to do those things let's Stand Together 72 in the spiral book anybody has a need 172 spiral book anybody has a need the AL open if you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost remember you may have a lot of head knowledge it will never the flowers are bling forever and the sun it will never go down I can't believe will never down I feel I sh the power forever and the sun it will never go the star will never go down in that City the sun it will never go down the flowers are bling forever I feel like Trel feel like traveling I my travel for you and will never thank you I feel am anybody else my sh I do the are moving forever and it will never go down here like tring on my TR theow for and the you will never go down so we will never go down in the it will never the flowers are bling forever and the sun I feel like I home the power forever and you will never go down I feel like shouting so I sh if we don't have the new birth we can't understand God right and if it's not the same holy spirit that was original from the day
