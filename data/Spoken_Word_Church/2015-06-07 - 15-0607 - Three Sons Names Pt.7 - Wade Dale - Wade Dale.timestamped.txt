[0:00] now we got it marked that's way we'll
[0:01] know that's where we start next time
[0:03] yeah right I got that marked I figured
[0:06] that out last night in Bible
[0:09] study all right
[0:11] let's read well I tell you what we're
[0:14] going to do we don't have to read
[0:16] scripture everybody knows in the
[0:17] beginning was word with God Word was God
[0:20] the same was in the beginning with God
[0:23] all things were made by him not anything
[0:25] made that was made okay that all
[0:28] right is that okay okay that thing on
[0:36] yes so we know what that comes from
[0:39] we we ought to be getting kind of a
[0:42] double dose with brother Dale upstairs
[0:44] and and then here to me
[0:48] showing all of you can see that I think
[0:51] but we started we're talking about the
[0:53] Son of God we haven't got the son of man
[0:55] we're on the Son of God and the Son of
[0:57] God is what the logos are the logo or
[1:00] the poster child or the somebody asked
[1:02] me the other day what a poster child was
[1:05] well you look at marchad diam you look
[1:08] at all they have a
[1:10] person on their ad or on their
[1:15] logo and that poster child now and don't
[1:19] get me wrong I'm not belittling anybody
[1:21] but you wouldn't want to have a poster
[1:22] child for muscular distrophy and have
[1:25] Arnold Schwarzenegger standing there you
[1:27] see what I'm saying cuz it would give
[1:28] you a false reason of what the march of
[1:31] diamonds or whatever would be but most
[1:33] of the time the poster child for the
[1:34] March of diamonds is a real small child
[1:36] sitting in a wheelchair that's
[1:38] all okay so that what does that do that
[1:41] brings to your mind as a human being
[1:43] that brings to your mind what the march
[1:45] of di is about and what it does it draws
[1:48] you to make a commitment or whatever
[1:52] okay that's what a logo does a logo gets
[1:55] you into the place all right or an
[1:58] advertisement gets you into into the
[2:00] place well the logos is is the only
[2:02] thing and I was thinking about this the
[2:04] other day you said well this is a hard
[2:07] way to understand god listen if there
[2:10] was any other easy way to do it God
[2:12] would have given it
[2:13] to okay so so what's our problem we are
[2:18] our problem that's right okay God has
[2:21] laid it out so simple that a person that
[2:23] can't even read he can just hear what's
[2:25] going on and he can understand what God
[2:29] is so if say I can't understand then
[2:31] it's not that God made it so hard
[2:33] because remember he knew what you'd be
[2:35] thinking right
[2:37] right right but still you're a premoral
[2:40] agent you can you can block it off or
[2:42] you can take what God's already said so
[2:44] these words that people get all you know
[2:46] say well this person's so deep listen if
[2:49] a man's preaching the word of God if it
[2:51] comes out of the word of God if it comes
[2:52] out of the prophet's message and it's
[2:54] not something weird that they come up
[2:56] with then what is that that's the mind
[2:58] of God that's made so simple but the
[3:01] problem is is we blocked our mind with
[3:03] all these other
[3:05] things everything else we're thinking
[3:07] about well my idea or I thought no if
[3:11] you believe the preacher's preaching the
[3:12] word to you then that's God speaking to
[3:14] you and you know what God knew that'd be
[3:16] the only way you could get it yes or
[3:19] he's not God right he would have brought
[3:21] it some other way to make it simple you
[3:24] say that's so hard it's not hard
[3:28] right it's not hard it's hard if you
[3:31] don't have the new birth that's the
[3:32] problem with a lot of people they sit in
[3:34] a congregation and they hear a preacher
[3:35] preach and they say well he just
[3:37] preached so deep that was over my head
[3:38] you know what they're saying I don't
[3:41] have the mind of Christ cuz the mind of
[3:43] Christ ought to be able to understand
[3:44] the mind of Christ right and a and a
[3:47] true minister is supposed to be there
[3:49] that and surely they are some people
[3:50] that are preaching that are not called
[3:52] and they make it so dark and and
[3:56] mysterious that you can't understand it
[3:57] well that's not God remember all Israel
[4:00] is not Israel all preachers in this
[4:02] message there are some preachers that
[4:03] are preaching this message that don't
[4:05] have the Holy
[4:10] Ghost a lot of
[4:13] them okay and you have to decide am cuz
[4:18] they can't I mean they think they got it
[4:20] like brother said about that woman she's
[4:21] so anointed you can't tell her not to
[4:23] put on a pair of pants or a pair of
[4:25] shorts right she's anointed she's
[4:28] Anointed with what a false anointing so
[4:30] if they're Anointed with a false
[4:31] anointing anointed ones at the end time
[4:34] is not the Baptist and the Methodist
[4:35] against the message
[4:37] people no it's the Believers in this
[4:40] message that set under a false Shepherd
[4:43] or or somebody that doesn't bring the
[4:45] whole word of God and I know there's
[4:46] degrees there are born again preachers
[4:48] in the message sure that preach simple
[4:51] but that's you know what they've done
[4:53] they've limited their self to
[4:56] that and God knew that God knew that
[4:58] that's all they' know and that's all
[5:00] they could preach but there's no way
[5:02] they can further the people any higher
[5:05] so if you have a desire to go higher
[5:08] that's why people move to different
[5:09] churches right so and that's okay that's
[5:12] all right as long as you're moving
[5:15] higher as long as you're moving up not
[5:17] back right you say well I'm going to go
[5:19] over here to this brother cuz he's
[5:23] simple what does that telling me you're
[5:26] simple or you don't have the new birth
[5:28] one of the two because to me I thinking
[5:30] about this other day and if you get a
[5:32] revelation of this you'll really
[5:33] understand this is the only way God
[5:34] could explain it to us or he would have
[5:37] been explained in another
[5:39] way he knows somebody's going to get
[5:42] this he knows somebody is going to get a
[5:45] revelation of who God is and it Quicken
[5:48] their heart and they'll take a Rapture
[5:50] or take a body chains and then a Rapture
[5:52] okay so this is but they also God knew
[5:55] you know some people can
[5:57] only brother Bron priest
[6:00] some can only come to here some can only
[6:01] come to here some can only come to here
[6:03] and here and here but whose fault is it
[6:07] it's your fault our brother brand said a
[6:10] false
[6:11] teacher that won't bring you to that now
[6:14] how can somebody that's that's not even
[6:16] a born again preach the statue of a
[6:18] perfect man and help you up the statute
[6:21] of perfect man there's no way that
[6:24] somebody it's like Peter Peter had to be
[6:27] right here before he could say add to
[6:29] your faith virtue knowledge Tempest and
[6:32] then he preached it and people came to
[6:35] that place right it's a draw it's it's
[6:38] what's drawing us if you're only if your
[6:41] pastor's only at knowledge or or
[6:43] whatever then he can't preach to you
[6:46] about brotherly kindness cuz you ain't
[6:47] got it yet okay
[6:50] so but now somebody that's up here and
[6:52] and preaching the true what everybody
[6:55] calls the third pull or the message of
[6:57] the hour cuz really the message of the
[6:59] hour is the
[7:00] headstone this is not the message of the
[7:02] hour this was preached by Peter Peter
[7:04] Paul James
[7:06] John uh
[7:08] irenius Martin they preached this they
[7:12] had this working in their
[7:14] life right so brother R didn't come to
[7:16] bring this message he come to restore us
[7:20] to where this could come on top of this
[7:23] remember a message of preparation it was
[7:26] restoration then
[7:28] preparation cuz this is not going to sit
[7:30] down on this if you're only to here it
[7:32] won't fit see that it goes down to about
[7:33] right there it won't fit you got to be
[7:35] up here for that to fit on all right so
[7:38] and that's a little bit further down the
[7:40] road cuz that's back into the son of man
[7:42] what we're talking about the son of man
[7:43] dispensation but the Son of God
[7:45] dispensation
[7:47] is the one that carries you
[7:51] from what the beginning of before the
[7:54] Eternal right before the Eternal all the
[7:57] way through to the to the Future home
[7:59] that Holy Spirit or that theophany
[8:03] always was there that logos always was
[8:06] there that word always was there
[8:09] right that's why the Bible says Heaven
[8:11] and Earth will pass away because it was
[8:13] created that part of it will pass away
[8:16] what the part that's the sin the sin
[8:18] part God's not going to destroy this
[8:20] Earth remember brother brandom to me he
[8:23] he brought it so plain speaking to the
[8:26] the denominational world that thought
[8:28] that this world was going to blow up and
[8:30] we were going to go up to heaven
[8:32] somewhere and live on a cloud or or go
[8:35] up there you know it ain't up
[8:38] there Heaven and Earth will pass away
[8:40] but my word will not pass away why
[8:45] because the word's Eternal all right so
[8:48] we we found out by a prophet that all he
[8:50] done was is went right back into the
[8:51] Greek and saw where that word uh pass
[8:55] away does not mean Anni it means to
[8:59] reshape or burn just like you you got
[9:01] the same body you got that you were
[9:03] sinning in but now you got the new birth
[9:05] in the same body right okay God just
[9:08] burnt the sin out and he came in to live
[9:11] same way with the Earth God can't put
[9:13] his feet on this Earth because there's
[9:14] so much sin he cursed the Earth right so
[9:18] God can't come down on a cursed Earth
[9:20] but when the curse is lifted then God
[9:22] can come down and stand on the earth
[9:24] just like he did in the Garden of Eden
[9:25] because remember God came down the
[9:26] Garden of Eden and walked with Adam and
[9:28] Eve
[9:29] in the garden that's exactly what's
[9:31] going to happen we're going to have a
[9:33] Garden of Eden condition read the future
[9:34] home brother brand to me that's why I
[9:36] said if I if they gave me one book and
[9:38] sent me to prison it'd be the future
[9:40] home CU it gives you the new birth talks
[9:43] about the Earth your Earth if you get a
[9:45] revelation your Earth it talks about
[9:48] Redemption talks about us going all the
[9:50] way into the future home and explaining
[9:52] all those things because remember the
[9:54] Millennium and and the new Heaven and
[9:55] new earth is two different
[9:58] things the he new Heaven and new earth
[10:00] and the Millennium is two different
[10:02] things right the Millennium is time the
[10:05] new Heaven and new earth is eternal
[10:07] that's back to the Eden condition the
[10:09] Millennium is not going to be sure it's
[10:11] going to be Eden condition for us cuz
[10:14] we're already changed we're already but
[10:16] there's still going to be the devil here
[10:17] there's still going to be that little
[10:19] spot somewhere that Satan is going to be
[10:22] but now when that new city comes down
[10:25] and everything's finished everything's
[10:26] annihilated all right so the millennium
[10:29] Still Still In Time right right
[10:31] Millennium still
[10:33] time so the Millennium is not the new
[10:36] Heaven and new earth but the Bible can
[10:37] call it a new Heaven and new earth cuz
[10:39] you know what it'll be new to
[10:41] us atomic fire is going to burn this
[10:44] thing off we're going to step down here
[10:46] Jesus is going to step down here and
[10:47] we're going to live and that's where
[10:49] we're going to talk about the son of
[10:50] David so we're not too far we're not
[10:51] getting off the subject we're just
[10:53] getting a little ahead of time cuz the
[10:54] son of David is where that Millennium is
[10:56] going to take place right okay and he's
[11:00] not the son of David to us right we're
[11:02] not Jews EXA he's not the son of David
[11:06] he's what he's the son of God we are the
[11:09] son of
[11:10] man amen we're the son of man on the
[11:14] Earth but the son of David is a promise
[11:17] that God made to his children Israel
[11:19] somebody was talking last night about
[11:21] um Ryan was talking about how could how
[11:25] could Adam take Eve back knowing what
[11:27] she did and knowing it would do well
[11:31] because and then he made the point of
[11:34] the law says that if you marry a woman
[11:37] and she commits
[11:39] adultery you're supposed to do away with
[11:41] her right not marry or B right right or
[11:46] if she's caught in the act of adultery
[11:48] the adulterer and adulteress are both
[11:50] stoned yeah you can't get away from that
[11:53] but remember Christ is the end of the
[11:55] law because there's Grace R is first so
[12:00] Adam took Eve back showing that God was
[12:03] going to take me and you back because
[12:05] you know what we done when we were born
[12:07] on this Earth we were not God's
[12:11] wife right we were the I mean we were
[12:14] actually running around on him if my
[12:16] point here's my point Israel he was
[12:18] married to Israel and Israel went whing
[12:21] you know what he should have done he
[12:22] should have watched him my face the
[12:23] Earth according to his law he should
[12:26] have divorced him and never called him
[12:28] back well there going to be called back
[12:30] but not back to being a son and daughter
[12:33] of God but he said I can't forget Israel
[12:36] remember Israel was the first that was
[12:38] who he come that's even who Jesus came
[12:40] to the son of man the first people he
[12:42] came to was the Jews CU he said I'm
[12:44] coming to my
[12:45] people right coming out of that Old
[12:47] Testament he was still looking back so
[12:50] that's the same way with Adam and Eve
[12:52] Adam there's no way Adam could destroy
[12:54] Eve because the agoy love you'll
[12:57] understand that one day cuz I didn't
[12:59] understand it until just you know
[13:00] several months ago that wasn't filo love
[13:03] that Adam had for Eve when he took her
[13:06] back cuz mine and your filo love would
[13:08] have killed her I'd never take a woman
[13:10] back if she'd been with a beast right
[13:13] but the agape love the Holy Ghost Inside
[13:16] of that of Adam being a Son of God he
[13:18] said the only way that she's going to
[13:21] survive is that I take her back and he
[13:24] couldn't see her killed same way with us
[13:27] God couldn't see us killed he couldn't
[13:28] just cast us off and say well y'all were
[13:30] a bunch of Sinners yeah we were
[13:33] Sinners but he called us and we come
[13:36] back remember he called us and we come
[13:38] back to him right so so let's not go so
[13:41] far as to that Adam and you would see
[13:44] see in your fio love you would look at
[13:46] that and
[13:47] go how could he take that woman back
[13:51] yeah Hey listen folks she was literally
[13:53] him right right exactly she was
[13:57] literally and you know when we
[13:58] understand understand that we're
[13:59] literally God made manifest in another
[14:01] form she was literally Adam there's no
[14:04] way we can die that's the Death part
[14:07] that we have to do away with where
[14:10] here cuz your new birth will never die
[14:13] the Holy Ghost will never
[14:14] die Adam didn't die he just moved over
[14:17] into another dimension right right same
[14:21] thing with with you and I with Christ in
[14:22] the church we have to be the Bible says
[14:25] bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh
[14:27] now if Adam said said that to Eve Christ
[14:30] says that to us we must become yes
[14:34] that's why the Bible says we'll have a
[14:35] body like into his body we'll be changed
[14:37] in the atoms our atams will be so
[14:40] changed to we'll go right back to what
[14:44] God saw his children look like before
[14:47] the foundation of the world right he's
[14:49] not done away with us listen if you go
[14:51] to hell you reject
[14:53] God God didn't reject you you reject God
[14:57] all right so same thing with
[14:59] with uh with Adam and and Eve you see
[15:01] Christ you see that agape love take
[15:04] over cuz remember hey when Jesus was
[15:07] hanging on the cross if he had filio
[15:09] love he would have probably called
[15:11] 10,000 angels to get him off he said
[15:12] they don't nobody love me that's us in
[15:15] our Humanity Ain nobody loves me I'm
[15:17] just going to do away with this whole
[15:19] thing no agape love took over knowing
[15:22] that the bride was inside of him and
[15:24] there's no way for her to come out and
[15:26] for him to have fellowship with his
[15:28] bride
[15:29] then for him to die to release that life
[15:32] there a lot of things went on on that
[15:33] cross that that of course the common
[15:36] World sees I say the common world but
[15:38] most people see that Jesus died for our
[15:40] sins but man when you start breaking it
[15:42] down and seeing that I was literally
[15:45] inside of that man yes I was inside of
[15:47] Jesus Christ by what exactly
[15:51] yes I was in Jesus cuz the L God was
[15:55] what walked on the face of the earth now
[15:56] that's in the son of man we got got to
[15:58] get back to the Son of God we're still
[16:00] talking on son of man son of David now
[16:03] but the Son of God everybody understands
[16:05] the logos is the word so there's only
[16:07] one way to understand God and that's
[16:09] right here 66 books of this Bible
[16:12] there's no other book being
[16:14] written you just got to get the
[16:16] mysterious part that's in there and it
[16:18] is mysterious to the known
[16:21] world right but it's not mysterious if
[16:24] you have the one that wrote it inside of
[16:25] you right okay which is what the Loos
[16:28] the word the actual word I I wish people
[16:32] would see that that that the word you
[16:34] needed to be born again with God knew
[16:38] that he looked down through time and saw
[16:39] it and then he what he spoke to Isaiah
[16:42] or he spoke to in my case he spoke to
[16:45] Moses and Moses
[16:48] wrote and God said let us make
[16:51] man in our own
[16:53] image for way Dale sake I'm writing this
[16:59] because to me that come that was the
[17:01] Striking realization of where I was now
[17:03] see your scripture may be something else
[17:05] you may be e John 3:16 or you may be
[17:07] this or you may be that whatever your
[17:09] scripture is you know what God put that
[17:11] in there just for you just for you you
[17:15] say well 100 people may so what you're
[17:17] the only one in the
[17:19] matter I was birthed by the word I
[17:22] wasn't Birth by something else I wasn't
[17:23] bth bir by a good feeling or a book or
[17:27] or you know reading in something else I
[17:29] was birthed by the word of God because
[17:31] I'm a word child and a word child has to
[17:34] come through the word everybody got that
[17:38] everybody got that there every one of us
[17:40] you say well I don't have a favorite
[17:41] scripture that's okay you have a
[17:44] favorite series of scriptures I'm sure
[17:46] right you may not just have one but you
[17:49] have a series that you can put together
[17:52] in the Bible you know what that was put
[17:54] there for you right just for you just
[17:57] for you to where you look down there and
[17:59] you see it that's why that that Peter on
[18:02] the day of Pentecost when he stepped out
[18:04] there and that Son of God came down into
[18:06] that group of people what he do he
[18:08] preached them a word sermon this Jesus
[18:12] who you've
[18:14] crucified I mean he went right straight
[18:16] to the person but what was the first
[18:18] thing he done though he went back to
[18:20] Joel he went back in the Old Testament
[18:23] he said this is that what he went back
[18:24] he had to go back into the word he went
[18:26] back into the word he said this is that
[18:28] that was spoken by the prophet Joel
[18:30] there's nothing else he could have done
[18:32] Paul the only way Paul could write 80%
[18:34] of the New Testament is go back into the
[18:36] Old Testament get the Revelation that
[18:39] they did not have during that time of
[18:41] the Old Testament get that Revelation
[18:43] and do what bring it over run it through
[18:46] the filter of the holy ghost in a man
[18:49] cuz we're going to read it right here in
[18:50] a
[18:50] minute it goes right into the man and
[18:53] then
[18:54] what same thing that happened when God
[18:57] said let there be life
[18:59] yeah
[19:00] thought
[19:03] voice same
[19:05] thing God speaking through a
[19:09] man he can't speak through nothing else
[19:12] that's right col IU prove it to you
[19:14] right here in just a
[19:16] minute all right he's talking about now
[19:18] what we're going to do is we're going to
[19:19] drop down we're going to we're going to
[19:21] look remember this is brother say King
[19:25] theophany all of us by the new birth
[19:27] have the same the because we have the
[19:29] same if you and if you and and and your
[19:33] spouse are one you don't have the same
[19:37] DNA but now in God's eyes we all do if
[19:40] we're born again all God's children have
[19:42] the same DNA because my DNA and and
[19:44] Terence and and Anna they can all be
[19:47] traced back to that right so the same
[19:49] way with all of us if we're born again
[19:51] we have the same DNA makeup the same
[19:53] thing it makes us up goes right back to
[19:56] our father right right all right and
[19:59] then the father comes and shows
[20:02] us where we come from remember brother
[20:05] Brown said the seal shows what that
[20:08] which was which is and is to come what
[20:12] he opened up that mind of God to go back
[20:15] so far to tell that that we come from
[20:17] logos we come from the word theophany
[20:20] and remember he also called it the holy
[20:22] spirit so if the holy spirit's in you
[20:24] today then what do you have you have all
[20:27] this inside of you that's why that's why
[20:30] that the the Bible and God wanted it to
[20:34] be pronounced the Son of God cuz the Son
[20:37] of God is the
[20:38] spirit right there's no flesh body in
[20:42] here at all right now right that we know
[20:44] flesh body that's right got it this is
[20:47] Spirit right but not Spirit like Ghost
[20:51] spirit right has a
[20:53] form it has
[20:56] substance right
[20:58] yes how did God kill those animals in
[21:01] the old in the in the Garden of Eden if
[21:03] he didn't have some substance about it
[21:06] right but that substance could if he
[21:09] needed to go through a wall when he was
[21:10] in a glorified condition he went right
[21:12] on through a wall and it never bothered
[21:14] him the Holy Ghost same thing with me
[21:15] and you if we fell dead right here you
[21:17] wouldn't have to open the door to let
[21:19] the spirit out that's right no it just
[21:22] steps over into another dimension Right
[21:25] This falls and it's dead all right
[21:28] same way with God course he don't die he
[21:30] just steps in another form so he comes
[21:32] from logos speech so whatever is written
[21:35] down that's what we need to understand
[21:37] I've always said uh and you get
[21:40] sometimes you get preachers it's like
[21:42] brother Brown said sometimes you get
[21:43] around a bunch of preachers he said
[21:44] that's where he makes his mistake get
[21:46] around a bunch of preachers but a b
[21:48] bunch of preachers were talking this has
[21:49] been 10 15 years ago when I first come
[21:53] back to the Lord and they were you know
[21:55] it says some of these writing and then
[21:58] it says um Blank Spot on
[22:02] tape right says Blank Spot on tape or or
[22:05] or they couldn't understand it or
[22:07] they'll put a little parentheses and
[22:08] then brother keep I wonder what he said
[22:10] I said don't
[22:13] matter they like well it might be well
[22:17] if it was for anybody it was for
[22:19] somebody sitting there in that
[22:20] congregation that heard it because
[22:22] brother Brown said Rapture in faith does
[22:25] not lie in the Gap right
[22:29] right that's good brother brother R said
[22:32] Rapture and faith lies in these books
[22:34] and Tes not in that see because see when
[22:38] man's mind begins to think that that's
[22:41] the devil that's right that's another
[22:44] Spirit trying to form a see you can form
[22:47] any Doctrine you want to in that black
[22:50] space right that's right you can form
[22:53] any Doctrine you want to I wonder what
[22:55] he said well I believe he said something
[22:56] about
[22:58] believe he did believe he said polygamy
[23:00] was all right but he just the Lord hid
[23:03] that from everybody but
[23:05] me you better run away from them kind of
[23:08] people so rapturing faith lies in this
[23:11] word right here that's right all right
[23:13] what you can read and comprehend that's
[23:15] where lack Rapture and Faith now brother
[23:17] BR didn't say Rapture and faith lies on
[23:19] these books and table he said in so you
[23:21] got to look in between the lines sure
[23:23] there's a mysterious part that's not
[23:25] written but it's got a coincide with the
[23:28] word here and here both plac all places
[23:31] all
[23:31] right can't have polygamy in a gap and
[23:34] then you know brother R say polyam is
[23:36] wrong you can't have that so it's just
[23:38] the lust devil that gets in there gives
[23:40] you more than one life bless their
[23:43] heart but look Moses did nothing it was
[23:48] the angel of
[23:50] God what did it look like that led
[23:52] Israel a pillar of Fire by night and A
[23:55] Cloud by day I believe he's still
[23:58] leading on right so God didn't do it CU
[24:01] what brother Brown's doing is is he is
[24:03] getting these people ready for a prayer
[24:05] line where that angel of the Covenant
[24:08] Jesus Christ himself the the what the
[24:11] theophany the Lo he'll call it in a
[24:13] minute I'll show it to right there it is
[24:15] it was the Loos or the Christ what' he
[24:19] say I believe he still we know that that
[24:22] was the angel of the Covenant so we can
[24:25] add one more the angel of the Covenant
[24:28] cuz the Holy Ghost was leading them on
[24:31] the
[24:32] outside remember brother R said God come
[24:36] three times above
[24:38] us Old Testament with us in the New
[24:41] Testament and now in us okay above us
[24:46] with us and in us so he was above pill
[24:50] Fire by night and the cloud by day now
[24:53] I've always said Moses saw a burning
[24:56] bush but if he would have had a deeper
[24:59] Revelation he would have seen Jesus
[25:01] standing there the theophany of Christ
[25:04] standing in that but remember the only
[25:07] way and you say well why didn't it
[25:08] happen that we a minute let's go back
[25:11] the only way Moses could understand it
[25:13] was the way he came yeah or he would
[25:15] have come another way that's why when we
[25:17] s here we go why in the world did he
[25:20] well that's the only way Moses could
[25:22] have saw God was that pillar of fire the
[25:25] burning bush or he would have come
[25:27] another way God don't go this way and go
[25:30] well I don't know if Moses will
[25:31] understand that so I'll no this is the
[25:34] only way Moses is going to come but
[25:36] remember but remember watch Moses's
[25:41] Revelation he accepted all this for a
[25:44] while and then he said God I want to see
[25:46] you he knew God was a man
[25:48] yeah he had he had enough Revelation so
[25:52] close to God till he knew he was the
[25:55] angel of the Covenant he knew he was a
[25:56] pill of Fire he knew God spoke to him
[25:59] all the time lip to ear it wasn't God
[26:02] somebody else and Moses no it was God
[26:05] and Moses cuz he used Moses as a special
[26:09] man didn't have the Holy Ghost but he
[26:11] had that anointing on him cuz remember
[26:12] when he had the anointing on him they
[26:14] had to cover his face it Shin so bright
[26:16] why the anointing of the Holy Ghost was
[26:18] on him but it never went in Moses or he
[26:21] would have not murdered that Egyptian or
[26:22] he wanted not have done the things that
[26:24] he did all right remember he smoked the
[26:27] water and the speaking to the water all
[26:28] right that was Moses brother said Moses
[26:30] gotten away cuz God said speak Moses you
[26:34] know he got
[26:36] what he got a little
[26:39] temperamental must I fetch you rebels
[26:43] water and instead of speaking to it he
[26:45] hit it well you know what but remember
[26:48] brother R said that set up a
[26:49] denomination that set up another what
[26:52] something that God allowed the water
[26:55] came but it was not it was under a
[26:58] permissive will of God not the perfect
[27:00] will of God cuz remember what we've come
[27:02] back to now is a spoken word not the
[27:05] smiting of this and the smiting of that
[27:06] we've come right back to what the word
[27:08] the spoken word is the Original Seed
[27:11] that's what God's always wanted was was
[27:13] Adam to speak and and and now you and me
[27:16] right but Moses but God knew this okay
[27:19] God knew this this the only way we can
[27:21] get this Moses was an
[27:25] example it was the angel of the Covenant
[27:27] is that right it was the
[27:29] logos or the Christ he's still the same
[27:32] Leading the People day today as he was
[27:36] then all right now let's go to gifts and
[27:39] callings now look people this is
[27:41] 1950 brother brandham had this
[27:44] Revelation not 1963
[27:48] 1950 cuz you know why he had a new birth
[27:50] and he was a
[27:52] prophet for the reading of the word
[27:53] found in Exodus he said behold I sent an
[27:55] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[27:57] way
[27:58] bring thee into the place which I have
[27:59] prepared beware of him obey his voice
[28:02] provoke him not for he will not pardon
[28:04] your
[28:06] transgression for my name is in him so
[28:09] who was it there's only one name of God
[28:11] that was Jesus Christ in spirit form not
[28:15] in flesh yet but if thou will indeed
[28:18] obey his voice do all that I speak then
[28:21] will I be an enemy to thy enemies and
[28:24] adversary to thy adversary for my Angel
[28:27] shall go before
[28:29] thee all
[28:37] right
[28:39] now that's one we read I missed the
[28:42] first one I'm
[28:43] sorry now let's go back to this one this
[28:46] was the first one I was going to read
[28:47] I'm actually wrong one God doesn't fall
[28:50] upon denominations God doesn't fall upon
[28:52] Mechanical
[28:55] Devices right he uses
[28:58] man God the Holy Spirit fell upon
[29:03] men man is God's agent this is one I
[29:06] wanted to read I'm sorry I'm pressed the
[29:07] wrong one first man is God's agent and
[29:11] the hardest thing that God has ever had
[29:13] to do was to get one mortal to believe
[29:17] another and that's true yes it do you
[29:21] believe that they couldn't believe Moses
[29:23] and God gave him two signs to prove to
[29:26] the people that he was sent from God for
[29:28] their Deliverance you believe that well
[29:31] isn't he the same yesterday day and
[29:32] forever do you believe the angel that
[29:34] talked to him in the burning bush is the
[29:37] Angel of the Covenant so that was God's
[29:38] voice that was
[29:41] Christ that's why Jesus could say before
[29:43] Abraham was I am and then he says if you
[29:45] had have known Moses you would have
[29:47] known
[29:49] me cuz he was back there that's why what
[29:52] brother Dale's saying if you'll
[29:54] understand what brother Dale's saying
[29:56] Jesus come were word first he was back
[29:59] before he was right
[30:02] here not the flesh but that man Jesus
[30:05] what was inside of him doing the talking
[30:08] was the word of God that said let there
[30:10] be that said all these things that
[30:12] that's why that that's why that all your
[30:15] your writers in the Bible knew Jesus
[30:18] Christ was the
[30:20] creator that Creator was inside that
[30:22] flesh body he was the angel of the
[30:25] Covenant that's why Paul PA could look
[30:28] at that light and say
[30:30] Lord he knew that angel of the Covenant
[30:33] back in the Old Testament was Lord God
[30:35] Almighty Jehovah right do you believe
[30:39] the angel that talked to him in the
[30:40] burning bush is the Angel of the
[30:42] Covenant was that right all right he's
[30:44] the same yesterday and then and forever
[30:46] and he's he does the same things today
[30:50] that he did then still perform signs and
[30:52] wonders now what's brother Bram doing
[30:55] he's getting the people to believe the
[30:56] signs that's coming cuz he's fixing to
[30:58] do a prayer line he's fixing to go
[31:00] through a prayer line all
[31:02] right now what here we go on this one
[31:06] and then we'll
[31:11] stop this word that we have just read
[31:13] was God sending Moses Moses was born an
[31:16] odd peculiar birth it was just time for
[31:18] the prophetic will of God to cause then
[31:21] it to move up and to have something to
[31:23] come to pass that he had promised
[31:24] Abraham to take his people out and he
[31:26] did
[31:27] God always moved just in time you
[31:29] believe that now we're at the day we're
[31:32] in the last day just how close to the
[31:34] end I do not know no one knows not even
[31:36] the angels are the Son of God the Father
[31:38] only knows but we're in the last days
[31:40] and he promised that these signs and
[31:42] wonders will be done in the last
[31:46] days all right now look so if God raised
[31:50] up a man by the name of Moses had him
[31:52] born into this world for that specific
[31:54] Pur to purpose to deliver the people
[31:56] that were in bondage that couldn't help
[31:57] them brought them out through his not
[32:00] Moses Moses never performed one
[32:05] Miracle Moses can't perform
[32:08] Miracle what brother brand was telling
[32:10] him he's separating himself from that
[32:11] angel the Cen he said I can't perform
[32:13] Miracle right Jesus never performed a
[32:17] miracle he'll he'll be here in just a
[32:19] little while he said if Jesus was
[32:22] standing here tonight he could not heal
[32:26] you that's what he said if Jesus was
[32:29] standing here he said if Jesus was
[32:30] standing here in a suit he said there's
[32:33] no way he can heal you he said he healed
[32:34] you before the foundation of the world
[32:36] you just got to believe it right all
[32:38] right Moses never performed one Miracle
[32:41] it was the angel of God that went before
[32:44] Moses right but now remember the angel
[32:47] of God didn't speak to the people the
[32:49] angel of God spoke to Moses Moses spoke
[32:51] right so it had to be man that it went
[32:54] through it was the angel of God that
[32:56] went before Moses it was a pillar of
[32:57] fire at night the cloud by day and when
[32:59] you see the picture that we're going to
[33:00] show you short shortly which one is he
[33:02] going to show them the one in
[33:05] 1950 this was right after the Sam
[33:08] Houston Coliseum when the when the the
[33:11] amber light appeared over brother bram's
[33:13] head all right that's the angel of the
[33:15] Covenant that's Jesus Christ it was the
[33:17] angel of God that went before Moses that
[33:19] would pill a fire at night Cloud by day
[33:22] and when you see the picture that we're
[33:23] going to show you shortly if we haven't
[33:26] I believe your feel that it's the same
[33:28] Pillar of Fire that's Leading the People
[33:30] today the angel of God which we know the
[33:33] angel that led Moses was the angel of
[33:36] the Covenant which was Christ the son of
[33:39] God or the low God that came out of God
[33:41] was the son of
[33:42] God actually you put all that and look
[33:46] today God's people are not in bonded
[33:48] spiritually for they're they're
[33:50] delivered by the power of the Holy
[33:54] Spirit the Holy Spirit brings him from
[33:56] the bond of sin all right so what
[33:59] brother brandham is saying is what he
[34:01] brings the angel of the Covenant now
[34:02] what is that angel of the Covenant many
[34:04] times you see him appear in the Old
[34:06] Testament and we'll talk about that next
[34:08] Sunday what form he appears in in the
[34:11] Old Testament cuz remember he appeared
[34:14] what in
[34:16] MDC he appeared as the U captain of the
[34:20] host
[34:22] Joshua right right he appeared in a in a
[34:26] in fire
[34:28] at the um three Hebrew children remember
[34:31] the Bible says it was the son of God
[34:33] right he appeared in a another fire to a
[34:37] group of some people there's all these
[34:40] different things that he appeared but it
[34:41] was the
[34:42] same cuz I see when Paul when Paul saw
[34:46] that light he said
[34:48] Lord he knew that was that angel of the
[34:51] C he was so versed in the Old Testament
[34:53] scriptures he knew that if it was that
[34:56] kind kind of a light that struck him
[34:58] down spoke to him and nobody else heard
[35:01] it but him right all they heard was a
[35:04] noise right right they just heard a
[35:07] noise that's what people are doing now
[35:08] you come to church you're hearing a
[35:09] noise if you're not born again you're
[35:11] just hearing a noise but the people that
[35:13] are born again God's speaking to them
[35:15] right that's right that's just the way
[35:17] it is I'm sorry that's the way it is it
[35:19] it's uh brother Brown preach an
[35:21] uncertain sound and that's what it is
[35:23] you get an uncertain sound now if you
[35:24] get a preacher up there it's got an
[35:25] uncertain sound
[35:27] something's going to ding something's
[35:28] going to ding in here that that's not
[35:31] right you know what that's the holy
[35:32] ghost telling you to
[35:34] beware right that's the holy ghost
[35:36] telling and you ought to thank God yeah
[35:38] that's right when that comes in here and
[35:40] that little you think well you know you
[35:42] think well I could be wrong there's 600
[35:45] people in this congregation and I'm the
[35:47] only one that's not amening I'm a no you
[35:51] give it the word test you take it right
[35:53] back to the word right and if it ain't
[35:55] the word
[35:58] spit it out that's right well what the
[36:01] Lord just revealed to me is that in the
[36:04] beginning was the word and from from
[36:06] that word everything else has come to
[36:10] this day to this very minute that's
[36:12] right that word BL it all Heaven and
[36:15] Earth will pass away but my word that's
[36:19] what we're going to live in in the
[36:21] future
[36:23] home now that's about 6 or eight months
[36:25] down the road
[36:27] but that word is building I go to
[36:30] prepare a place for you what they don't
[36:32] up there with hammer and nail the word
[36:34] built it for us every bit of this I've
[36:36] always said your future home the place
[36:38] you're going to live in the future home
[36:40] is in you right now that's right even
[36:43] before he said in the beginning was the
[36:45] word the word was the word sure that was
[36:49] his even before that cuz remember it's
[36:51] going to be it's got to be
[36:54] spoken yeah yeah to come to pass because
[36:57] remember like we said before watch God
[36:59] move Jesus was in God's mind he was
[37:03] slain brother Brown said that did it
[37:05] that did it for Adam and everybody else
[37:08] but there's one day it literally had to
[37:10] happen right on Earth to what I've
[37:13] always said the reason we're doing what
[37:15] we're doing and the Reason God done what
[37:17] he done was witness to the devil yeah
[37:20] cuz remember the devil is the right hand
[37:21] he's the next person to God God to me
[37:25] and forgive me if I'm wrong God is
[37:28] obligated to show the devil where he's
[37:30] wrong and he's proven he's wrong by me
[37:33] and you because remember all he got to
[37:34] say
[37:35] is to the Devil he's just going to all
[37:38] he's got to do is say go back to where
[37:40] you come from I created you I can do
[37:43] away with you but what is he doing he's
[37:45] bringing Sons and Daughters of God to a
[37:47] place to prove to that next guy in
[37:49] command that number one he's in control
[37:52] but number two he can be in control in a
[37:54] group of people we got to go
[37:59] and that is by the word because we're
[38:01] word born people
