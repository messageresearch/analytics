[0:04] let's add a wonderful wait you're
[0:06] talking about it we have a wonderfully
[0:13] good we good we yeah well we did more
[0:21] than that you gotta get out you can't do
[0:23] something from try it I'm sorry all
[0:31] right revelation 6 1 we're going to
[0:34] start now don't you look right here what
[0:37] I got Mohammed there is uh this is this
[0:44] is what we need to look at all right
[0:46] it's what I wanted to talk about or
[0:48] talked about last Sunday well we're
[0:50] talking about this Sunday yeah I'm
[0:53] single all right because there's a big
[0:56] contention in the message on some people
[0:58] now sometimes when we say that you think
[1:00] high informations believe that knowledge
[1:02] you're certain little pieces or parts of
[1:04] people they believe that the seals are
[1:06] close of course that's the group that
[1:08] believes that brother grounds got to
[1:10] come back and open them in that little
[1:13] room and open the sealed and we get the
[1:14] Holy Ghost when we go on the rafter
[1:16] night that's just an overview all right
[1:19] but now I truly believe that close
[1:25] because if it's not revealed to you it's
[1:28] closed run ok so the seals are open /
[1:32] close because the lemme and you say well
[1:37] they're open to me let me ask you a
[1:39] question I thought the seals were for
[1:41] the redemption of the body and as soon
[1:42] as we see all seven seals in our bodies
[1:45] change back so as the seals all open to
[1:47] you yeah
[1:52] right why I tell you when we read these
[1:57] when brother Brad preached them if the
[2:01] if the if the Rennick the full
[2:03] revelation had come into part at that
[2:05] time into being at that time then one of
[2:09] a rapture taking place okay so now we're
[2:16] 50 years down the road we're still
[2:18] reading the seal book we're still
[2:20] listening to the seals we have a pretty
[2:22] different preachers brother Claude
[2:23] preaching on it now he's preach 67
[2:25] Thurman zones and he's only honest thing
[2:27] sealed so he's he's you know diggin
[2:32] being pretty good pretty deep Odell next
[2:34] 60 some herbs in 1982 so we've got
[2:36] people that are preaching them but the
[2:39] revelation is there but having us told
[2:42] you last week let's read around here and
[2:43] then I'll then I'll explain something to
[2:45] you and maybe it'll help you because
[2:47] that we need some help and I saw when
[2:50] the lamb opened one of the seals
[2:51] revelation 6 1 and I heard as it were
[2:53] the noise of thunder right one of the
[2:57] four beasts saying come and see and I
[3:00] saw behold a white horse and he the
[3:01] sound of him had a bow and a crown was
[3:02] given unto him and he went forth
[3:04] conquering and to conquer all right that
[3:07] is the opening of the steel in the Bible
[3:12] right that's the opening of the seal in
[3:16] the Bible oh my god thats a man because
[3:19] what and i saw when the lamb opened one
[3:22] less thing on the Bible tells you it was
[3:23] open okay and I heard it worth north of
[3:27] thunder program watch that one is the
[3:28] thunders the voice of God when the seal
[3:31] is being made known or broke okay at
[3:34] Eric tour back all right there's a
[3:36] thunder go down hey and heard it was a
[3:42] noise one of the thunder and one of the
[3:44] four be so see what is one of the four
[3:46] beasts saying what is one of the four
[3:48] beef doesn't matter which one it is we
[3:51] know the lion with the
[3:52] per stage company agent but there had to
[3:55] be something come from the Beast to join
[4:01] being a top John top of his bride right
[4:05] the lamb didn't say John come and see
[4:09] the lamb broke the seal the thunder went
[4:15] out and one of the four beasts which is
[4:18] the type of the black not really a type
[4:21] it is the holyoke the four beasts is the
[4:23] Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost has to tell
[4:26] you come and see then what you John dude
[4:29] and I saw now John wrote when he saw
[4:33] that John had the baptism of the Holy
[4:34] goat but he was not commissioned to give
[4:38] the revelation of this right right okay
[4:41] he was commissioned to write what he saw
[4:44] right John brought these things and give
[4:47] them to the seven churches okay and
[4:49] that's what he did and I saw and behold
[4:51] a white horse and he had sent him how to
[4:52] vote crown get on him went for cup and
[4:54] incumbent there's your symbols many down
[4:58] through the ages have probed at it clams
[5:01] Larkin did preach that this was the
[5:04] Antichrist okay but remember the others
[5:08] listen what I said clamps like the one
[5:11] the problem to the end time he didn't I
[5:12] loose ends together he was still a
[5:13] Trinitarian he still had Trinitarian
[5:15] idea he still see his background was
[5:19] denominationalism so he didn't he come
[5:22] out to a degree but he didn't come all
[5:24] the way out remember brother Brown said
[5:26] they come out through the ages but they
[5:27] didn't go all the way out what they
[5:28] didn't have enough to change buddy so
[5:31] Claire so I can look at this and through
[5:32] the Holy Ghost he got a revelation okay
[5:35] but then when the prophet of God comes
[5:37] he gets the full revelation because
[5:41] brother Brown said one co ty the entire
[5:43] Bible together all right right here this
[5:48] will kind of the entire Bible you will
[5:49] see Clarence Larkin wasn't one that
[5:50] would say this is going to tie the
[5:53] entire Bible together and I
[5:55] no brother branham was commissioned by
[5:57] God himself to come back to
[5:59] jeffersonville and to preach these seals
[6:02] right okay and I believe they open to
[6:06] the product okay but they did not open
[6:10] to the people he be preaching to right
[6:11] man they didn't open to the people
[6:15] who've recently they thought they might
[6:18] of got some a living but we're 50 years
[6:20] down the road and peeling it back you
[6:27] know the onion peel so the lamb opened
[6:31] the seal then we see that the Holy Ghost
[6:36] has to tell you to come and see right
[6:40] that's the whole year I proposed in
[6:42] there cuz rook the steel is the Holy go
[6:45] hey we're not tearing physical sealed
[6:48] off a book okay what you're doing so is
[6:52] the book where the book and the Holy
[6:54] Ghost is revealing what us what we are
[6:57] revealing to us do we are what we are
[6:59] what we're doing here front which is
[7:02] which was which is which is to come
[7:04] night and for one of the four beasts
[7:07] being the Holy Ghost said coming see and
[7:10] I saw jon said he wrote down a white
[7:14] horse that went out goddammit like say
[7:16] we come down to Clarence Larkin who have
[7:18] a revelation of his town and then we
[7:22] have that man pretty much you know
[7:26] sealed it back off and denominational
[7:29] ideas then we had to have a profit come
[7:31] along and give us all the way out of
[7:33] that mess the brand's all the way out
[7:35] okay but for the ones you just came in
[7:41] there's contention in the message that
[7:43] the seals are closed and the program's
[7:45] got to come back and open them to us I
[7:48] agree with that to a degree brother
[7:51] Graham don't have to come back but he
[7:53] lays laying in the message that he
[7:55] already creek and the seals are open
[7:58] because the Bible says and I saw when
[8:01] the lamb opened one of the seals so we
[8:05] oh that the seals according to what God
[8:08] is looking at are open correct but
[8:11] brother Louisa I was telling them asking
[8:13] them before the question this was
[8:14] preached in 1963 if the full revelation
[8:17] of the seals had been made known in 1963
[8:19] the rapture order took place in the 92
[8:22] the seventh seal on the next morning
[8:25] that's what this for program safety
[8:28] sales are for rapture in faith all right
[8:33] why are we still here 50 years later
[8:35] because they are closed until you get a
[8:39] full revelation they're open we know for
[8:42] a fact it's in there we're not waiting
[8:44] for some person to come and open a force
[8:48] front because no man can open that book
[8:52] except that lamb if you don't how to
[8:55] ollie go you know to understand them
[8:57] anyway and even with the Holy go man has
[9:02] been confused down through time and now
[9:04] we come down to the end time and we have
[9:06] the filter of the ministers coming out
[9:09] which is the for beef the line aux man
[9:12] illegal the holy ghost in the believers
[9:15] now trying to not reopen them but
[9:20] explain one open web rodel come about
[9:24] not interpret man is interpreted and got
[9:27] it wrong but if it comes from God
[9:30] straight from God to the Holy Ghost your
[9:33] filter into you there's an explanation
[9:36] of what's going on what God's already
[9:39] done okay he's explaining himself
[9:41] because you're not going to change the
[9:43] word where I'm going to change the
[9:45] prophets message just like in am 70
[9:48] weeks we never change the Bible we never
[9:50] change the properties message we have to
[9:51] take a quote output one end we didn't
[9:53] have to skip a Bible verse alright we
[9:57] truly understand I believe now Daniel 70
[9:59] weeks and how it all ties together so I
[10:02] hope and praises we can do that with the
[10:03] seals right and it's not it's like I
[10:06] said before you got to give you a
[10:08] revelation I don't want brother brown
[10:10] now look honestly
[10:11] brother branham's revelation of these
[10:13] seals all right his revelation of these
[10:18] seals is the true revelation of god
[10:20] there's no one else we need to come and
[10:22] bring in young tell ones thing but he's
[10:24] in a grave waiting on somebody to catch
[10:27] that revelation have enough wrapped ring
[10:30] faith to take him and all the other
[10:32] cages out of the ground yes overwhelmed
[10:35] the grave and braver layout death will
[10:38] be swallowed up the model seven
[10:40] victories swallowed up in victory
[10:42] alright so that's what we've got to see
[10:46] so truly they are closed but you gotta
[10:50] remember we're looking at an open book
[10:53] so it's not something we're waiting for
[10:56] somebody to come in reopen the bandstand
[10:59] that we're not reopening or are
[11:02] redefining or redesigning the Bible in
[11:06] the seals we just got to understand what
[11:09] are you talking about yes and then we
[11:13] got to understand what you ought to take
[11:14] that is that like that onion peeled you
[11:16] know it is open but if you don't get too
[11:19] real the truth i'm talking about the
[11:21] full revelation to me if you get the
[11:23] full revelation the seven seals that's
[11:25] the entire Bible revealed as it should
[11:27] have been had they not been fall okay
[11:31] that's just to me that to me that's what
[11:33] the seals mean to me if they're all
[11:35] broke and they're all open and the full
[11:38] revelations come out then to me that's
[11:40] Adam standing back in the garden before
[11:43] the fall the man the Holy Ghost ruling
[11:47] and reigning over the earth through a
[11:48] man named Adam right a man in Jesus
[11:52] Christ the second out then where were to
[11:54] be the what the second date the man and
[11:57] then brother Brown said that he was
[12:00] going to prove to Satan that this eve
[12:02] width all okay something there would the
[12:07] fall so you never felt the truly you
[12:10] never felt that Genesis 1 26 men never
[12:13] found a man that's what we got to
[12:15] understand that when we
[12:16] down at the end of time we come all the
[12:19] way down here and we've got to see
[12:22] something not different than everybody
[12:24] else soft same Bible it was whoo you
[12:28] know thousand years ago they put
[12:29] together a thousand years ago for a man
[12:31] to read same Bible man has ready to
[12:34] script for millions of times but there's
[12:36] somebody going to catch the true real
[12:38] revelation of what the prophet of God
[12:40] was saying and not just that the white
[12:43] horse riders Antichrist now if that's
[12:44] the only revelation of this first feel
[12:46] their brother Graham you can read it on
[12:48] a piece of paper there right this book
[12:54] contains the opening of the seals while
[12:58] I was doing while we're still here be
[13:02] revealed we must get a revelation for
[13:05] ourself of what these seals mean not
[13:08] contrary to the Bible not contrary to
[13:12] the prophets message we can't make it
[13:14] polygamy or our seventh under virtually
[13:18] all those different doctrines we can't
[13:20] make Norman the mega twin brother sorry
[13:29] and that brings up a point because to me
[13:32] the seals have no carnality of man in it
[13:34] I mean really has no car I mean if you
[13:40] take seven sent over the Seventh Seal is
[13:42] polygamy listen that's that's a natural
[13:48] act done in a sinful world and you think
[13:53] that's got something to do with them and
[13:54] that's the purest opening of the word
[13:56] has ever been and you're going to throw
[13:57] you know your bodily lust and all that
[14:03] you know I mean you know one thing if it
[14:06] drives you to the flesh it's definitely
[14:08] not a god very hidden commander collide
[14:11] always gonna have to deal with this guy
[14:13] and turn him back turn him back or her
[14:18] back to the original where Adam tables
[14:20] in the garden and walking in the cool
[14:22] didn't talk right so if you take
[14:25] anything of carnality of this message
[14:27] and you put it in here 0 NE of opening
[14:29] of whatever and you hear somebody talk
[14:31] about well it's eating grapes and this
[14:33] having four wives in this is you know
[14:36] it's do you know something carnal or
[14:37] something natural now this is the most
[14:40] supernatural message that's ever been
[14:42] that's right brother Brad said I never
[14:44] worked in any realm supernatural realm
[14:48] there's nothing natural about these
[14:49] seals because the natural seals remember
[14:52] the natural seals break while we're gone
[14:58] night tribulation if you get that heart
[15:03] right so that's not to us in the natural
[15:08] form you shall wait a minute ok let me
[15:11] the lab brother Graham said from
[15:13] revelations 412 revelations 1921 but
[15:17] stood whom the Jews not to us he said
[15:22] has nothing to do with us that's what
[15:26] throws people off as you why what about
[15:27] ten seven what about well it is we get
[15:30] the supernatural element of it and then
[15:33] we get the supernatural part i read you
[15:35] that quote together down i'll read it
[15:36] again
[15:44] so my the mystery a mystery of scripture
[15:47] and the previously hidden truth down
[15:49] divinely revealed that's what happened
[15:52] in 1963 it was divinely revealed hidden
[15:59] truth right here got it the wheel Miriam
[16:03] brown because over here will read it
[16:06] next Sunday I got it mark brother Brown
[16:11] says and questions and answers now
[16:12] remember questions and answers was right
[16:14] before he preach the seven seals you pre
[16:15] six seals stops had questions and
[16:17] answers an increase 77 gut paragraph
[16:20] nine I am just positive you don't see it
[16:27] paragraph 10 I'm supposed this is just
[16:31] tape for ourselves but let me say it see
[16:34] that you don't you don't get and you're
[16:36] not supposed to get all those whole six
[16:40] knots that he preached the most
[16:42] wonderful message that he have ever
[16:43] brought in the purest form had ever been
[16:45] brought in and he says you don't get it
[16:48] don't try and put your interpretation to
[16:50] it you only get further away just take
[16:52] my advice if you believe me as God has
[16:54] given me favor in your sight don't put
[16:56] your own interpretation to it and all of
[16:59] your conscious and know that there's
[17:00] something mysterious happening and is
[17:03] happening and I know what it is now I'm
[17:05] just not saying that it's the grace of
[17:07] God that lets me know what it is is
[17:09] something that's tremendous and it's
[17:11] gone right now it's gone and there is
[17:16] not a way in the world for you to see it
[17:19] reading questions and answers right here
[17:21] I got it I got right there you don't see
[17:24] it but so help me with the Bible in my
[17:29] hand I know what it is it's been told
[17:31] you before don't try to put any
[17:34] interpretation to it you don't see
[17:41] when they get they got the red
[17:43] environment I mean I was sitting there
[17:48] when rather Brown was preaching the wild
[17:49] horse rider was the Antichrist and they
[17:51] were having a wonderful time in and
[17:54] honest-to-goodness I some people got a
[17:56] revelation of that but they didn't get
[18:00] the full revelation because it was gone
[18:04] because there wasn't the right kind of
[18:06] people to get it because it's got to be
[18:08] total revelation all with the statute
[18:12] with perfect man and all these things
[18:13] I'm just reading what the prophet said
[18:14] I'm not telling you here so that's what
[18:16] brother Brown said they didn't get it
[18:18] okay but right now is the time for us to
[18:21] get it right that's right man guy it's
[18:25] that that right one button he said down
[18:28] on seventh seal will read it later this
[18:31] way on down the line a mystery in
[18:34] Scripture and they previously hidden
[18:36] truth now divinely revealed but which is
[18:42] a supernatural element still remains
[18:44] despite the revelation so we have got
[18:47] the revelation of the seals one is
[18:52] Hannah Christ to the Antichrist three in
[18:55] the enterprise for Jenna craft in four
[18:57] different ages 5 is the fifth seal jus
[19:00] not the regular bride diet st. seal is
[19:05] the two prophets that we're talking
[19:06] about in Daniel and a seventh seal is
[19:09] Jesus Christ Himself are over 9y week
[19:11] why was killed by me wait we got to
[19:13] change this morning it's almost was
[19:14] after 10 when I went to Lamar between
[19:16] six and nine will give it to party tank
[19:18] and go home don't be i'm being funny but
[19:21] that's not funny we've got the divinely
[19:25] revealed truth but there's a
[19:28] supernatural element still rich remains
[19:31] despite the revelation that's the part
[19:34] you not have to get we have the divinely
[19:37] revealed truth right
[19:40] the whole lotta the property God brought
[19:43] brother branham took Brock from Genesis
[19:45] to Revelation and he opened the
[19:48] previously hidden mysteries in the Bible
[19:52] wanna look still here there's a
[19:56] supernatural element nine different from
[19:59] his revelation not different from the
[20:02] Bible but there's a supernatural element
[20:04] that is what it's got to be personal to
[20:07] you everybody that was sitting there in
[20:13] the 60s that got the divinely revealed
[20:15] truth probably took him back and
[20:18] preached his people and it helped them
[20:20] and it made them better Christians but
[20:22] that's what he said he said just
[20:23] continue on the way you are be a
[20:26] wonderful Christian but there's a
[20:29] supernatural element that's not going to
[20:31] be revealed to you because let's just be
[20:35] honest ninety percent them people that
[20:36] were sitting in that service high stone
[20:41] that's been 50 years ago George they
[20:44] were 20 there 79 if they were 30 they're
[20:48] 18 m young say one thing so most of the
[20:52] people is that he preached to that great
[20:54] revelation of the seals are already in
[20:57] glory waiting on somebody to watch catch
[20:59] the revelation i think that's what
[21:00] brother ground he caught that he caught
[21:03] that he said it's not for you going live
[21:05] good Christian life you you're going to
[21:07] in other words you're born again you're
[21:09] around were you supposed to be you're
[21:10] going to go into that sixth dimension
[21:11] but right around becoming the Lord
[21:13] something's going to happen there's a
[21:15] supernatural element that's going to
[21:16] come out of these seals it's going to
[21:18] literally change its my brother tells me
[21:19] preach and literally change our body
[21:22] we've been turned back I hope you kids
[21:25] when he said we've been turned back
[21:27] right the Omega bride is now connected
[21:31] with the Alpha bribe because the Alpha
[21:33] bride remember the Alpha Prime there was
[21:35] no Trinity there was no water baptism
[21:39] phone somehow all those things all
[21:41] eternal hell that wasn't in the first
[21:43] three ages that are the Alpha the Alpha
[21:46] ride it came down in
[21:49] was filtered through man's idea
[21:51] tradition through the church ages but
[21:54] the Holy Ghost was still there don't dis
[21:56] clin the Holy Ghost it was in every age
[21:58] but you come down to the Omega bride and
[22:01] the Omega bride has to be turned back by
[22:05] Malachi 4 right the mountain dump though
[22:09] Omega bride has to be turned back to the
[22:11] Alpha by now that doesn't mean we go
[22:12] back that means all the revelation from
[22:16] those six sir changes come up to this
[22:17] one okay because we still need that ox
[22:22] lai program said we still need that hops
[22:24] anointing to get us through a daily job
[22:26] and daily work they went to the gallows
[22:29] for it you and I go to work and then a
[22:32] hot gets this through be our daily walk
[22:36] so that was the Holy Ghost in every age
[22:38] or the type of but now there's a
[22:40] supernatural element coming to this age
[22:43] you show this is so mysterious know it's
[22:45] going to be what's written in this Bible
[22:48] and written in this prophets message
[22:50] we're not going to get it we don't have
[22:52] to go to class marking to get it anymore
[22:54] tell us what makes everybody so well
[22:57] with clams larkin that he had it first
[23:00] and brother drowned him didn't have it
[23:01] clamps larkin had a revelation right he
[23:06] had revelation but he went the full
[23:08] revelation brother Adam had the full
[23:10] anointing the full revelation he was a
[23:13] prophet glass Michael was not a prophet
[23:16] but listen not me but if anything was
[23:20] part of the fivefold ministry in there
[23:21] the whole job don't you think Duncan for
[23:23] real things to it amen he did hey if he
[23:28] come out of reach the wild horse rider
[23:29] was he and I cried he must've had a
[23:32] revelation because nobody else did that
[23:34] was totally contrary everybody's believe
[23:36] okay so he understand what I'm saying
[23:39] I'm not saying Claire's Larkin was was
[23:41] the man like most of them you ask what a
[23:43] lot of people would leaving the message
[23:45] for this and I'll brother branham just
[23:46] read clamps Larkin and then he just came
[23:49] over and wrote the same thing but clamps
[23:50] Larkin did and got got something from
[23:53] him
[23:57] well brother branham read a lot of
[24:02] things that he got a lot of but he had
[24:03] to have a personal revelation right
[24:06] you're not a read a lot of things but
[24:08] you got to have a personal revelation we
[24:11] got to leave all that together right and
[24:15] get it free self so I said I don't want
[24:17] brother branham's revelation I want to
[24:21] use his revelation for me to see
[24:24] something out of them yeah right I can't
[24:27] go take a body change with his
[24:29] revelation 13 I can't take a body change
[24:35] for both elf revelation for rubber I
[24:37] said this is a personal relationship
[24:38] with God and you gotta get it personally
[24:42] for yourself now if I get política man
[24:44] he gets not eating meat on Sunday and he
[24:47] gets you know he gets them they get milk
[24:50] you got a problem that's right in front
[24:53] right either one person is right another
[24:55] 12 wrong oryou airliner oh ok take me to
[24:59] rights that's him in the in the message
[25:02] of the hour and that's what's the
[25:04] problem being being man has not got the
[25:06] supernatural element he's got a
[25:10] knowledge of the truth because look like
[25:14] I said one more time before you can read
[25:16] in that book you're reading that seal
[25:19] book program breaks down all the seals
[25:21] right but you know he turns around he
[25:24] says you know Jesus already previously
[25:26] and Bob's your the scholars are like
[25:29] what in the world i mean the scholars
[25:32] thought well man this is what's been
[25:33] sealed up through all the ages and no i
[25:36] can understand it little brother branham
[25:38] he goes by says let's go to Matthew 24
[25:40] and he brings all the skills to help all
[25:43] six that when he breaks them right down
[25:44] in the Bible and says Jesus is already
[25:47] priestly we just didn't get the
[25:50] revelation you know what he was saying
[25:51] we didn't get to Revelation then just
[25:54] like we're not getting to the river
[25:55] Chanel right but now okay so then you
[25:59] take Matthew 24 there is a divinely
[26:01] revealed truth brother Branham brought
[26:03] all them and put every steel in them in
[26:05] Matthew 24 right but yet nobody got a
[26:11] decent we said I just read it to you
[26:15] nobody got the true supernatural element
[26:18] of what was going on nobody got it right
[26:23] hmm that's right well if the Apostles
[26:28] woulda got it they have interacted back
[26:30] to end if they got the full revelation
[26:32] yesterday what I'm saying right the
[26:34] fullness you and I have to have the
[26:37] fullness and my program said beyond any
[26:40] man's knowledge so don't dig for for
[26:45] natural knowledge of them be quiet like
[26:50] I talk to you yes because there is a
[26:52] supernatural element now if it's a
[26:54] supernatural element it can't be given
[26:59] to a group
[27:03] it has been given to an individual you
[27:08] can't give yourself I mean I can't give
[27:11] such a journey revelations I can preach
[27:14] and let God open her eyes let what let
[27:18] the let the one of the beasts say come
[27:21] and see right one of the beasts they
[27:25] come and say I want to show you what
[27:26] this this made that right the man so
[27:30] that's what we're waiting on we've
[27:32] always been with everybody and honestly
[27:34] everybody been waiting on some great
[27:35] somebody to raise up progressive the
[27:39] great one is here that was in nineteen
[27:41] sixty-two degrees that the great one is
[27:43] here what what we looking for yes we're
[27:47] looking for it to run this through our
[27:49] filter and not be a humanized filter
[27:52] I've just watched right on the piece of
[27:54] paper mm-hmm like I said one more time
[27:56] the seals has been opened he showed us
[27:59] what ever see it was in this book and we
[28:01] read it I read this become any time to
[28:03] ready ready kept ready read read read
[28:05] read read more the other one out and got
[28:08] this one one of the old hardback sorry
[28:11] and help me absolutely got the
[28:17] supernatural element don't think
[28:18] something maybe we can start putting
[28:22] that supernatural element together okay
[28:24] maybe we can see see not I'm not see
[28:28] with our eyes see because you can see
[28:30] where your eyes this right you see the
[28:34] seal I see you book I see the pages that
[28:39] man has put in a book all the tape the
[28:43] brother branham made but am I really
[28:45] seeing the revelation okay that's what
[28:49] we've got again we've got to see the
[28:50] revelation or we're going to just keep
[28:53] on dying going by the grain and then it
[28:57] was
[28:57] team and nothing wrong with that that's
[29:03] why I said there's only a small portion
[29:05] is going to really get the supernatural
[29:07] level he said what does that mean that's
[29:11] the unwritten park you asked what the
[29:15] supernatural element is not written in
[29:17] the Bible if it was written in the Bible
[29:20] Satan could read it he can interpret it
[29:23] but he had only interpreted letters he
[29:27] can't get a supernatural revelation he
[29:31] can't get the unwritten part so program
[29:34] said the seven thunders not written
[29:36] anywhere in the Bible Diana but it's
[29:40] contained in the hobo the seals and help
[29:43] the seals is not going to come from a
[29:45] new book that somebody's gonna find it
[29:50] would be this new book give me this book
[29:54] made you more and more and more making
[29:57] you you said well what are we waiting on
[30:00] listen Paul said what in Thessalonians
[30:04] we which are allowed in our main he's
[30:07] already told you that somebody's not
[30:08] going to the revelation is right there
[30:13] we which are alive and remain to the guy
[30:16] award will not prevent or hinder those
[30:18] who are asleep but the trumpet of God
[30:21] shall sound the supernatural element
[30:24] because look you say what's the
[30:27] supernatural element alright hollow on
[30:29] the road to Damascus he's riding his
[30:33] horse all of a sudden boom he falls off
[30:39] his horse God is speaking straight to
[30:42] that man it's also why that persecutors
[30:47] me he said oh I'm Lord who art thou you
[30:52] persecuting me why are you kicking
[30:53] against the Kree why and they had a
[30:54] conversation but those men around him
[30:57] what the model say they heard the noise
[31:01] it's all the way they didn't hear the
[31:04] voice that's right that's why I'm
[31:06] brother branham when he went to Serbia
[31:07] canyon and stood on that rock and he
[31:09] threw that rock up in the air they said
[31:11] that came down a thunder they'd knocked
[31:13] all the rocks off you know Owen 33 sided
[31:16] rocks that they'd pick them all up there
[31:17] but what came down they saw the cloud
[31:22] they saw up heard the thunder but God
[31:26] was speaking straight to brother ground
[31:28] and said judgment will strike the west
[31:30] coast now they didn't hear that they saw
[31:35] they heard apart but they didn't get the
[31:39] supernatural element who was not
[31:41] speaking to though he went speaking to a
[31:42] group of people he spoke to one person
[31:45] when he spoke to Paul he spoke to one
[31:48] person a man so that's your supernatural
[31:51] element we we have William God the books
[31:54] we got to take we got this room up
[31:55] wonderful we carry this with us we move
[31:58] it around we can read it and we can sit
[32:00] here and we can keep looking at this
[32:01] blue player I got our parents their
[32:03] supernatural element but until we catch
[32:05] the revelation that we're still going to
[32:07] be here well I was just gonna
[32:10] say in regards to the supernatural
[32:11] revelation of it it's not even though
[32:14] brother brother Brennan preached the
[32:16] seals it's not like he went all right
[32:19] like an instruction manual step one you
[32:21] need to do this step two you need to
[32:24] know there's no it was just all kind of
[32:26] but then it has to be supernaturally
[32:28] gathered to try you know in a
[32:30] supernatural way because I mean it's
[32:32] like you say the devil would be able to
[32:34] drive it too if it was a remember when
[32:35] he said 10 Seventh Seal he said he said
[32:38] hold something in your hearts they can't
[32:39] get he said but once he comes out he
[32:42] said saito start trying for her well
[32:44] that's the supernatural element to me
[32:46] that's the supernatural element that you
[32:48] and I are gonna have to catch ourselves
[32:52] to get us out of here or to even get us
[32:55] toward a body change to make us where we
[32:59] can make it may be our or we problem out
[33:02] last night about you know things
[33:04] having a conversation about you know
[33:06] survival pretty much just bottom line
[33:09] about survival and what we're going to
[33:11] do I just feel that that there's nothing
[33:15] we can do naturally to keep the squeeze
[33:19] from coming nothing everything we got
[33:27] they can track every move we made them
[33:30] are you to it you say well what about
[33:32] them we have cash you back our twin old
[33:35] bill I would let me get lucky boy yeah
[33:38] well me too I didn't hear what I said is

[33:44] it Lisa hand me one there when I bill
[33:45] please try to make okay I got the blue
[33:54] minutes don't matter it's got that strip
[33:57] in it right there cash-strapped that
[34:00] strip tells them where it come from
[34:02] where it was made and what it is now how
[34:05] they know that I scan it they can scan
[34:10] that you should all go put this in the
[34:12] woods and hide under up you know you put
[34:19] it in you know it is waiting put it in
[34:22] your pocket you put in your pocket or
[34:25] you go hide somewhere turn the scanner
[34:29] on there oh we don't wear that
[34:33] twenty-dollar bill there thank you i'm
[34:35] gonna even with cash see we all thought
[34:38] by longtime goal if your head if you had
[34:40] cash that's how you get that maybe I
[34:44] cash it was okay huh you know what so
[34:49] come with
[34:55] it's gonna take that right there that's
[34:57] right to keep us to the body chain
[35:03] brother Brad I mean we're going to read
[35:05] it as we continue on come at the third
[35:07] pull the third pull brother Brown said
[35:10] it's dormant everybody's gone about the
[35:11] third full he said it's gone from you
[35:17] what the ability to make this come to
[35:21] pass can I can I say that and not be
[35:25] using my own words brother I was telling
[35:28] them you can't use what I'm giving you
[35:31] right now Yeah right you can't use it
[35:35] it's gone from you in other words it's
[35:36] been withdrawn brother ground said the
[35:39] third pool is now laying dormant what is
[35:42] the third Pole speaking the word he said
[35:44] but when the squeeze comes in other
[35:46] words will bring goes quote when the
[35:48] squeeze comes that's when you'll be able
[35:50] to use it but you gotta have it in
[35:51] storage before you can use it because
[35:54] remember i was reading the other day and
[35:56] Lord showed me a little bit more about
[35:58] the five wise and five foolish virgins
[35:59] we'll get into that maybe later on but
[36:02] if you look at the five wise virgins had
[36:04] the oil now what happened to the five
[36:08] foolish when the call came listen to me
[36:12] he's all efforts work hanging in when
[36:15] the call came behold the bridegroom
[36:18] coming they all woke up listen they all
[36:25] woke up all 10 of them woke up because
[36:29] the file says we're going in and the
[36:31] file that didn't realize they didn't
[36:33] have it because of the call because they
[36:39] were there I must have been in the same
[36:41] building church message hmm
[36:46] and by all right with that okay because
[36:50] the file go to the file foolish go to
[36:55] the five wise so they're not separate
[36:59] their together because the call woke
[37:03] them all up the prophets message won't
[37:07] even foods version problems mentions
[37:09] woken up yes but there's five to have
[37:12] supernatural element and this file that
[37:15] didn't but they didn't say well we
[37:18] really get know that you were to go to
[37:19] find it they came right here and said
[37:23] give us of your oil holy those give us
[37:26] of your revelation we got a revelation
[37:29] no man they had a revelation judge finds
[37:32] things if I back to me is there a
[37:33] revelation but they didn't have the
[37:36] supernatural element because these five
[37:39] went on in that's right these five state
[37:41] because they didn't have the Holy Ghost
[37:43] they had me they said they had a reading
[37:48] interpretation that's what I had my was
[37:51] 14 years old I had a reading
[37:53] interpretation of the message but I
[37:56] didn't have a supernatural element
[37:58] revelation cook I knew I didn't have the
[37:59] Holy Ghost because I proved that years
[38:01] later you know the one out in the world
[38:03] I proved that so it's got to come down
[38:08] to the supernatural element to finalize
[38:10] and five foods burdens all heard the
[38:13] same call it's not like this one heard a
[38:15] special different call and these hurt a
[38:18] different car Bible says word went out
[38:21] behold the bridegroom cometh they all
[38:25] can look up so they must have heard he
[38:28] too but remember they didn't hear what
[38:31] these five her right because they wanted
[38:34] to go and find out what these five had
[38:36] heard that they had heard commander
[38:38] think about that ye so comfy we separate
[38:41] them foods further than the wide no they
[38:43] were all together and to be in the same
[38:45] barren building church because when the
[38:49] call came everybody woke up
[38:51] but what happened is somebody got a
[38:53] supernatural element and went on in and
[38:56] these have to stay so they didn't have
[38:58] that supernatural so next time you will
[39:00] start on the co-branding steelbook and
[39:02] we'll start reading the seal and what
[39:04] will do is it will read the natural part
[39:07] of it the revelation then we'll start
[39:12] talking a little bit you know make us
[39:14] watch the listening we got a few more
[39:16] years anyway
