[24:57] every one of you good some good playing
[25:00] good singing got some good musicians it
[25:09] always sounds better when they know what
[25:10] they're playing for now right amen what
[25:15] we're sit down and we'll read this again
[25:17] that Martin Luther said just in case you
[25:20] didn't get it this morning more read
[25:21] until you say good time all right you
[25:23] ready Martin Luther dealing with the
[25:26] Black Plague that was in that time of
[25:29] the the I think it was probably the 17th
[25:33] century or somewhere it killed millions
[25:34] of people and here Martin Luther's right
[25:38] in the middle of it and I would say
[25:42] being a man of God he's seeking wisdom
[25:44] of God and I'm sure he didn't just say
[25:46] this to the wall I'm sure he said this
[25:47] to this congregation and the people that
[25:50] were listening he said I shall ask God
[25:52] mercifully to protect us
[25:54] then I shall fumigate help purify the
[25:57] air administer medicine and take it
[26:00] I shall avoid places in persons where my
[26:03] presence is not needed in order not to
[26:05] become contaminated and thus perchance
[26:08] inflict and pollute others and so caused
[26:11] their death as a result of my negligence
[26:14] if God should wish to take me he will
[26:17] surely find me and I have done what he
[26:20] has expected of me and so I am not
[26:23] responsible for either my own death or
[26:25] the death of others if my neighbor needs
[26:27] me however I shall not avoid place or
[26:30] person but will go freely so Martin
[26:32] Luther was cautious but he wasn't scared
[26:34] at all but I will go freely as stated
[26:39] above see this is such a god-fearing
[26:41] faith because it is neither brash and
[26:43] our foolhardy and does not tempt God
[26:46] thank you you got that this Luther's
[26:49] Luther's works volume 43 page 132
[26:53] written by Reverend dr. John Hess that
[26:56] was one of the his disciples right after
[26:59] right after he was so either went off
[27:02] the scene or we're still on the scene
[27:04] but that's that's something we need to
[27:06] live by you know faith is not foolish
[27:09] either faith is not foolish we don't
[27:12] tempt God we don't walk out here in the
[27:14] middle of the road and say look you know
[27:15] I God you know you're gonna stop that
[27:19] 40-ton well no he just might let your
[27:23] stupidity kill you but like Martin
[27:27] Luther said he transferred that he saw
[27:28] if God wants to take me but I don't want
[27:30] to do anything to make it any worse you
[27:33] know to forward that and make him doing
[27:34] any quicker but he was living under the
[27:38] promises of God just like we are and he
[27:40] was living under the baptism of the holy
[27:42] ghost that's what that's what makes the
[27:45] Holy Ghost person say during a time like
[27:48] this instead of being scared and our
[27:49] teeth rattling and all these different
[27:51] things so we hold to the truth that
[27:53] God's gonna take care of us we believe
[27:57] in his promises we believe in his
[27:59] benefits and we believe these here and
[28:03] he's real and then and he'll put nothing
[28:06] on us that we can't stand he don't
[28:09] promise that he can put us no more on us
[28:11] then we will put no more on us than we
[28:13] can stand so if you got your Bibles you
[28:15] turn back to Galatians and we'll try to
[28:16] we'll try to get the sanctification I
[28:20] believe it was it was fruitful that we
[28:23] spoke this morning a little bit more on
[28:25] justification because that's a that's a
[28:28] part that's that's your foundation that
[28:31] gets you going that's your start that's
[28:33] your beginning that's where God is going
[28:35] to meet you and become close with you
[28:38] even though you're still a dirty rascal
[28:40] you know like like brother Branham said
[28:42] you know he God picks the bottle up out
[28:44] of the mud and it still got mud all over
[28:46] it but yet he's gonna he's got a purpose
[28:48] for it he did pick it up so he is gonna
[28:51] have a purpose for it so we've got an
[28:54] update on brother Donnie Reagan and I
[28:55] didn't read it I've got leaning younger
[28:57] but
[28:58] he's okay they're still running some
[29:00] tests on him his heart's fine from what
[29:02] they from what they know so far so let's
[29:05] just keep him in prayer there him and
[29:06] brother on brother Dale and all the
[29:08] different ones but Homer I hear he's got
[29:11] to have some test run
[29:14] Devil's trying his best he's trying his
[29:18] best but he can't he might win a battle
[29:22] but he ain't winning the war he can't
[29:24] win the war we already wrecked we
[29:27] already read the battle plan we always
[29:29] we know who the generals are we know who
[29:32] the winners are and we know who'd losers
[29:33] are so and if it's an ever if it's an
[29:37] ever changing Word of God can't fail
[29:41] can't family and the battle plans not
[29:44] gonna change either this is still it
[29:46] this is the way we get to it through
[29:48] justification sanctification baptism the
[29:50] Holy Ghost there'll be battle battle
[29:51] battle battle battle but the war has
[29:54] already won
[29:55] Amen so I also remember next Sunday will
[29:58] be a brother clods April the 18th the
[30:01] Spring Fling April the 19th one service
[30:03] brother Dale's birthday dinner will be
[30:05] that Sunday and we will have it will be
[30:07] catered by the church June 18th to the
[30:09] 20th remember the Father's Day fishing
[30:11] trip the sisters were going somewhere
[30:13] too and Jim reminded me just a minute
[30:16] ago brother you remember brother Murphy
[30:19] the the Chinese brother that did the
[30:21] work brother Bissell's he's up there now
[30:23] but he reported back that six believers
[30:27] in China have been arrested for
[30:29] distributing Bibles in that country
[30:31] three of them have been released in
[30:34] three of them are still in jail so we're
[30:36] going to pray that God's gonna he's
[30:38] gonna he's going to take a pall in Silas
[30:40] and he's gonna we pray they praying and
[30:44] the doors of that prisons gonna open and
[30:46] they're gonna walk out so you say well
[30:48] they're halfway around the world it yeah
[30:55] so what I hope God I hope your God is
[30:58] close to you and can get to you in the
[31:02] time of trouble you can hey man he's
[31:05] naughty he's over there with him now and
[31:06] I believe he'll bring them out I mean
[31:09] there's not a governor government can
[31:11] dan against the Word of God not one not
[31:15] one thing can stand against the Word of
[31:17] God so we just believe that so let's bow
[31:18] our heads and get started

[33:25] could you imagine being an Egyptian and
[33:27] looking over into the country of Goshen
[33:29] and you go I think I'm gonna be within
[33:32] people over there
[33:34] there's plagues over here why because
[33:37] God told him God told him where to go
[33:41] put him in the land of Goshen even in
[33:43] joke during Joseph's time when Joseph
[33:46] came about he put them in Goshen so that
[33:48] was the promise or the time of them to
[33:50] use while the plagues were going on so
[33:53] pray that God put us all in Goshen as
[33:55] this plague continues on the face of the
[33:59] earth the Galatians 3 16,000 to Abraham
[34:02] and his seed were the promises made he
[34:04] saith not in the seeds of the many but
[34:06] as of one and to thy seed which is
[34:07] Christ so there's only one seed we're
[34:10] dealing with it's not natural genealogy
[34:12] it's spiritual genealogy I'm am and this
[34:15] i say that the covenant that was
[34:17] confirmed before of god in christ the
[34:19] law which was four hundred and thirty
[34:20] years after cannot dissin all that it
[34:23] should make the promise of none effect
[34:24] in other words bringing the law in
[34:26] bringing all anything you brought in is
[34:29] not going to dissin oh the Covenant that
[34:32] God made with himself because he didn't
[34:35] make with another Hebrews 6 verse 13
[34:37] let's go to that where when God made
[34:39] promise to Abraham because he could
[34:41] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[34:42] we're gonna read in just a minute he
[34:44] says I will I will I will saying surely
[34:47] blessing I will bless them multiplying I
[34:50] will multiply thee so after he had
[34:52] patiently endured he obtained the
[34:55] promise you may be seated in the Lord at
[34:56] his blessing to the reading of the word
[34:59] brother Brahim said as he just
[35:01] Melchizedek I'm gonna read it this
[35:02] afternoon when Abraham met him he was
[35:05] Melchizedek he unfolds here what all the
[35:08] attributes will do now now who's an
[35:10] attribute all born-again believers are
[35:13] attributes of God ma'am all right so all
[35:16] attributes will do in the final end he
[35:19] unfolds in other words what's he saying
[35:21] he unfolds in the walk or life of
[35:24] Abraham what all of us are gonna go
[35:27] through at the final in so today we look
[35:31] every son of Abraham every son of the
[35:34] faith will absolutely do the same thing
[35:37] no I
[35:38] want you to watch here what we have
[35:39] become in other words he's preaching the
[35:41] message of who is this
[35:42] Melchizedek we know that that wasn't
[35:45] many people I've reading a few comment
[35:47] commentaries they argued that it's a
[35:51] priesthood they argue that it's of this
[35:52] but the Bible clearly says the man the
[35:56] man no Cassady didn't have father a
[35:59] mother didn't have beginning of days and
[36:02] then and the wife brother Brown said
[36:04] Christ is the only person that could be
[36:06] a man so we're looking at now that in
[36:09] our journey with with Abram God didn't
[36:12] appear in that form to him as we look in
[36:15] the Bible we see in Genesis 12 and all
[36:18] the different verses he says Lord Lord
[36:21] and the Lord said and the Lord appeared
[36:23] now if you look in the different in
[36:25] margins in your Bible especially we got
[36:27] Scofield Bible it says theophany so so
[36:30] God met Abram in different forms but he
[36:34] didn't never met him in human flesh
[36:36] until he come to Melchizedek well we
[36:39] were just reading that in the scripture
[36:40] this morning where he met him in
[36:42] justification and like I said before you
[36:46] know you and I meet God in human flesh
[36:50] according to the prophet of God us
[36:53] living under an open book now knowing
[36:56] where Melchizedek is and what he's doing
[36:59] he's inside of all of us
[37:01] he's inside of all of us a man so who is
[37:05] this mill Cassady well it's the bride of
[37:07] Jesus Christ brother Branham revealed
[37:08] him is showing me that it was Christ but
[37:11] war is Christ now the Bible says it's
[37:14] Christ in you the hope of glory and
[37:15] where does the priesthood come from
[37:17] where is all judgment going to come from
[37:19] all judgment is not going to be by Jesus
[37:22] Christ himself
[37:23] the Bible says while all will be jumping
[37:26] it's gonna be judged by you you're the
[37:30] one the Bible said the Saints will judge
[37:32] the earth by what by the crisis inside
[37:35] of you and you cannot you and I can
[37:38] judge because of what Christ has already
[37:40] done to me that's the great
[37:42] justification see that's justification
[37:44] that goes on up higher in the pyramid
[37:46] that not we know and we can go through
[37:50] many many stages were
[37:51] the RAM talks about justification and
[37:53] then he gets to the point where we come
[37:56] to the highest form of justification
[37:58] that the real you didn't do it to begin
[37:59] with
[38:00] but now we got to stay a baby for him
[38:02] justification because the real you did
[38:04] do it well we can't blame it I want a
[38:08] devil we can blame on we can blame him
[38:12] for one thing and that's he anointed us
[38:14] to do it but we went ahead and did it
[38:15] anyway just like we were telling the
[38:17] young adults by last weekend you know
[38:21] it's you talk about predestination well
[38:23] predestination is really easy it's you
[38:26] know God predetermined your journey but
[38:28] he predetermined by your choice
[38:30] he knows that you and I Adam and Eve if
[38:34] they were put on free moral agency all
[38:36] of us are still put on free moral agency
[38:38] we can press play when we won't do we
[38:41] can stop what we're doing what we want
[38:42] to now we can be influenced by these
[38:45] different things and under justification
[38:47] you watch Abram Abram coming from an
[38:49] idol worship and daddy and he comes and
[38:51] he walks he gets into Canaan and he
[38:54] likes it pretty good but then he has a
[38:56] little bit of a trouble and then he has
[38:58] to move out he has to get it there's a
[39:00] famine in the land so he has to move in
[39:02] to eat it well he moves into Egypt and
[39:05] he starts having problems well that's
[39:07] the same way you and I on our
[39:08] justification journey of justification
[39:09] listen you gonna have problems right up
[39:11] to the day your bodies change but you
[39:12] should not be able to you should not let
[39:14] the problems that you had before
[39:18] determine what you're gonna do this is
[39:22] just simplest for the for the I'm
[39:23] telling you for everybody but we all
[39:25] need this and I hope and pray that
[39:28] somebody today our or wherever you are
[39:31] wouldn't understand one thing if you
[39:33] haven't went through this journey don't
[39:35] fool yourself you're not born again it's
[39:40] all I've been in a list listened
[39:45] justification true justifications when
[39:47] God justifies you the list is gone your
[39:51] slate is wiped clean you have no more
[39:55] problems yeah well you've got problems
[39:56] in your brain but you have no more
[39:58] problems you don't have to ask
[40:00] forgiveness for what you did 20 years
[40:01] ago
[40:02] if you've truly been joy
[40:04] Steff I'd say nobody we can't do that
[40:07] and Satan can't do that he remembers it
[40:10] cuz he was there we were in partners
[40:12] with him right but now God has wiped out
[40:16] from his memory and all I wanted to do
[40:18] is be wiped from his memory not mine I
[40:21] can handle I can handle my human memory
[40:25] because it's there and seems like the
[40:29] things we forget we shouldn't forget and
[40:32] the things we don't forget we should
[40:34] forget so everybody got that yeah me too
[40:39] every day so justification though is is
[40:43] God forgot it and he's never gonna bring
[40:45] that back out so be be and I'm satisfied
[40:50] in and I was thinking the other day we
[40:53] the other night we were discussing
[40:55] something here and I went home and I was
[40:58] like lord I I used to be you know X Y Z
[41:02] you need to see you do the same thing
[41:03] you ever sit around it's the Lord I used
[41:05] to well are you having a conversation
[41:08] with Regina oh you have a conversation
[41:12] with you not having a conversation with
[41:15] God because he's the he's like surprised
[41:17] it ever happened
[41:18] what do you mean but see even in that
[41:22] when you speak it it never goes into his
[41:26] memory and it never goes into your your
[41:28] slate
[41:29] even at justification your slates clean
[41:32] from their back but now brother Brown
[41:35] said though the root of evil is still
[41:36] there we'll tell me this morning and as
[41:38] you continue to walk it adds back up
[41:40] again they got that same man because
[41:44] you'll go right back into doing the
[41:46] things that you did before even truly
[41:48] justified but you won't do that for a
[41:50] long period of time now don't tell me
[41:52] God justifies you 20 years ago when you
[41:54] smoked drank cussed had four wives three
[41:57] husbands and blah blah blah and say well
[41:59] I'm still justified well you were twenty
[42:01] years ago but you've your inventory has
[42:05] caught up with you everybody got that so
[42:11] that's why we need to do like Abram
[42:13] Abram kept walking and he stepped into
[42:15] sanctification
[42:17] what's cleaned him up and got him ready
[42:20] to be put in service he had to make a
[42:22] next step you and I we're you know we're
[42:25] in a journey and a journey as always one
[42:27] foot in front of the other the man we
[42:29] all adjourn E is one if you ever stop
[42:33] remember god doesn't stop so if you stop
[42:36] guess where you're at you're way behind
[42:38] all right
[42:40] so God's gonna start here we're gonna
[42:41] start in now in Genesis chapter 15 let
[42:47] me just run through justification just
[42:49] for a minute to catch them up but
[42:51] remember this covenant is unconditional
[42:53] if you're connected to this covenant you
[42:57] can't lose because God said I will and
[43:00] and don't go to it now I'm just gonna
[43:02] read it because we're gonna come right
[43:03] back to it in just a minute listen God
[43:07] never has a hard way of doing things
[43:11] even when he came here on earth in human
[43:16] flesh he said he'd spate like a common
[43:17] man he sent us a seventh grade education
[43:20] prophet not some highly-skilled
[43:23] psychologist that had 42 years of
[43:25] degrees no he sent us an ain't and it
[43:27] ain't in the hate preacher that we can
[43:31] all understand everybody can understand
[43:33] what he said
[43:33] alright so God's not you know who's
[43:36] confusing the devil alright so in June
[43:40] in Genesis chapter 12 when God starts
[43:42] this journey or Abram starts this
[43:44] journey with God he says I will make
[43:46] thee a great nation I will bless thee
[43:49] make thy name great and I will bless
[43:52] them that bless thee and curse them that
[43:53] curse thee so it was always God in this
[43:56] covenant he's going to do it now you
[43:57] don't hear that much anymore
[43:59] but when we get over here a little bit
[44:01] further we see when we get into the new
[44:04] birth if we get into it this afternoon
[44:05] for naught we'll get it to it later
[44:07] in Genesis 17 he starts right back in
[44:09] verse 6 and I will make the exceedingly
[44:11] fruitful and I will make nations of the
[44:14] and I will establish you so you see it's
[44:16] God doing the work the whole time it's
[44:17] God doing the work all the time and you
[44:20] have got to respond to that event our
[44:25] response to that is what happened right
[44:29] how'd y'all get here so quick
[44:31] don't stand don't stand back I like
[44:33] senators get in the building
[44:36] they peeking through the window yeah
[44:38] this is the place you're supposed to be
[44:41] you're looking for a church brother good
[44:45] to have you back hey man thank you that
[44:48] God give you a say I don't think y'all
[44:50] all fit on there hello mercy mercy it's
[44:57] good to have them back that's good y'all
[45:00] fly down here yeah I'll fly down here yo
[45:02] you make second service yeah let's see
[45:03] yeah
[45:06] cheeseburger through the drive-through
[45:07] and come on down right okay they were in
[45:12] a journey but we see Abram Abram is one
[45:16] thing to me is Abram listen his whole
[45:21] journey was full of circumstances but he
[45:23] never he never stopped and said well
[45:25] because of that I'm just gonna quit
[45:27] because of this I'm just gonna quit I'm
[45:31] 80
[45:32] well I'm 75 years old fixing to be 86
[45:35] and have a kid with Hagar and he never
[45:38] said well I've done all I know he's okay
[45:43] Lord here well here we go because God
[45:46] told him you know be that he was going
[45:47] to be a father of many nations and then
[45:49] we're gonna read in just a minute where
[45:50] where God says Abram quit looking at
[45:55] your age quit looking at the numbers God
[46:00] don't work in numbers he no more with
[46:01] one person then the devil can do with 75
[46:04] billion people doc can do more with one
[46:06] person he took this one person called
[46:09] Abram that was coming out of a house of
[46:12] idol worship and coming into a place to
[46:14] where now every Christian that is a
[46:17] Christian has to walk in that same
[46:19] journey water an important man and I
[46:28] hope he can say that about all of us
[46:29] that our journey connects with that
[46:33] journey of Abram to Abraham because
[46:36] that's what if we if Abram would have
[46:38] never got to Abraham we wouldn't be
[46:40] using his name because Abraham is a
[46:44] there many nations Abram was just high
[46:46] father that was no promise in that name
[46:48] there was no promise in Sarah's name her
[46:51] name had to be changed to Sarah your
[46:53] name had to be changed to Christian for
[46:56] your journey to be worth anything ma'am
[46:59] that all right so justification in Roman
[47:04] streets is being justified freely by His
[47:05] grace through the redemption that is in
[47:07] Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to
[47:10] be a partition participant sorry
[47:12] perpetuation I got to slow down through
[47:14] faith in his blood to declare his
[47:16] righteousness never declare yours
[47:19] declare his righteousness if I live
[47:22] under his righteousness then
[47:24] everything's going to be okay to declare
[47:27] I say at this time his righteousness
[47:29] Paul says Romans 3 verse 26 that he
[47:31] might be just and the justifier of him
[47:34] which believeth in Jesus
[47:36] no one can justify your past except God
[47:40] no one because your past is not worth
[47:43] justifying that's why he has to clear it
[47:47] off but remember like I said before if
[47:50] you don't continue on to that next walk
[47:54] then you're just piling your sin back on
[47:57] top of itself it's a new thing it's the
[48:00] new sin that's coming now okay cuz I
[48:05] listen I believe truly God forgives
[48:07] people because the Bible says believe on
[48:09] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[48:10] saved they didn't say believe on the
[48:11] Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be born
[48:13] again you saw oh there's a difference
[48:16] there's a definite difference in being
[48:17] saved and born again brother mom tells
[48:19] us that that's the difference in that
[48:20] you can be saved one - where people get
[48:23] it all mixed up you can be saved one day
[48:25] and not the next you can get a lack of
[48:27] justification because if you you truly
[48:29] said God forgive me of what I'm doing
[48:31] for you me and my sin he's just to
[48:32] forgive that person
[48:34] but that person hasn't been caught
[48:35] enough to go on to sanctification where
[48:38] they stand that's why the you know them
[48:40] the Baptist once saved always save you
[48:43] you go to a funeral to a guy that had
[48:45] darkened the doors in the Baptist Church
[48:47] for 30 years but that letter sitting in
[48:49] the file that 30 years ago right that he
[48:53] came up and made a what like a decision
[48:58] it comes up and makes a decision shakes
[49:00] their hand with the preacher turns
[49:01] around they get you letter of
[49:03] recommendation out and then that saves
[49:06] you once they'd always say now see
[49:08] that's a lie if it's done that way you
[49:11] heard what I said
[49:12] because once saved always saved that's
[49:14] where justification of the
[49:16] sanctification to the baptism the Holy
[49:17] Ghost to a glorification so if you once
[49:20] truly saved you'll go on to be
[49:23] sanctified and you'll go on to be filled
[49:25] with the Holy Ghost so that all right
[49:26] say man all right so now we as message
[49:29] believers just don't believe in being
[49:32] saved save just part of the journey now
[49:35] if that person comes and does and and
[49:38] truly confesses their sin and God knows
[49:40] us as far as we're gonna go and they die
[49:42] tomorrow they will be given eternal life
[49:44] but they're not bribed
[49:45] they don't come under the blessings and
[49:48] benefits of being a child of God they
[49:51] come under the lock benefit and then you
[49:55] got that they come under the lock
[49:57] benefit where lot gets eternal life
[50:00] because the Bible says it makes his
[50:02] righteous soul he just nicked what what
[50:04] what he didn't have enough word to get
[50:06] him out of Sodom and Gomorrah he didn't
[50:10] respond enough to God to get him out of
[50:12] Sodom in the world but he's going to be
[50:15] saved and that's okay but I want to be
[50:17] brown I want to be called a son and
[50:20] daughter of God because if I'm called a
[50:23] son and daughter of God I don't it's not
[50:25] what I do
[50:26] I don't ever stand in judgment cuz
[50:30] that's the whole thing I'm telling you
[50:31] that's one of the Lord I believe the
[50:33] Lord really if he'll reveal it to you
[50:35] the great one of the greatest
[50:36] revelations in this message is is that
[50:38] you never have to stand judgment hey
[50:43] don't scare me anymore don't scare me
[50:47] anymore
[50:47] why because you've been born again God's
[50:52] not just eradicated the old you he don't
[50:55] even remember the old you the whole you
[50:58] is gone but now remember in
[51:01] justification though the real you still
[51:03] here are the person that did it made you
[51:06] do that that root of evil he's going to
[51:08] make her heart
[51:10] more pliable though so we can begin to
[51:12] deal with because he begins to deal with
[51:14] Abram but when we get to this next
[51:17] journey of sanctification we see that
[51:20] that steps up into a little bit higher
[51:22] level we sees there there's more of an
[51:25] intimacy between Abram and God there
[51:28] should be more of an intimacy between
[51:30] you because remember he's gonna eat you
[51:33] can't clean yourself up but if the Bible
[51:37] says the unclean spirit goes out of a
[51:39] man walking dry places now how's that
[51:40] unclean spirit get out he doesn't leave
[51:43] of his own accord and at that point
[51:46] you're not wishing that it's gone
[51:49] hello you still like that old devil but
[51:54] under the power of the word of God and
[51:56] doing what God says and and the benefit
[51:58] of that is is that Satan don't like
[52:01] Corey's hat anymore
[52:04] so he gets out he gets out he can't
[52:13] stand to be around a good Christian and
[52:17] when you start bringing yourself into
[52:19] this environment and reading your Bible
[52:22] and studying and Being Earnest talking
[52:24] to brothers and sisters forgetting the
[52:27] things that are past read the Bible
[52:29] about what he's already said about you
[52:31] all the benefits Satan hates that I like
[52:35] what brother what was his name the
[52:39] brother that was here that was a brother
[52:42] Richard Wilson's church the older man
[52:45] anyway he would read the Bible and he'd
[52:48] have a headache or something means he's
[52:50] okay devil we're fixing to read the
[52:52] Bible if you want to read it through my
[52:55] eyes go ahead but I'm fixing the read
[52:57] where God says by His stripes I'm healed
[53:00] brother straighter thank you my brother
[53:02] straighter old brother straighter he
[53:03] said now devil if you go to play you
[53:06] gonna look through these eyes right here
[53:08] then we gonna read the Bible because the
[53:12] devil is not gonna ever tell you to read
[53:14] the Bible he hates that thing he hates
[53:17] that book so get that thing out
[53:20] now don't do like my aunt nervy she
[53:23] always made her boys ride with a Bible
[53:26] in her car when they had a wreck the
[53:29] Bible just got tore up I'm here they
[53:31] didn't I don't think it helped much at
[53:33] all
[53:33] by having it right here but if you'll
[53:36] take it out and read it and let it
[53:37] become a part of you yeah that's the
[53:39] difference so that's Abram moving higher
[53:43] toward Abraham in this journey of
[53:47] sanctification let's read Ezekiel 11
[53:49] verse 17 this is kind of where we ended
[53:51] I think we'll stay in sanctification
[53:55] today and then we'll just move to the
[53:57] Holy Ghost next next time with preach
[54:00] therefore saying thus saith the Lord God
[54:04] I will even gather you from the people
[54:07] and assemble you out of the countries
[54:08] where you have been scattered and I will
[54:10] give you the land of Israel now he's
[54:12] talking about unnatural people and also
[54:16] in when we get and read Ezekiel a little
[54:19] bit later on Ezekiel 36 remember you
[54:21] remember the story of the dry bones you
[54:24] have bones and they're not together
[54:26] they're just laying out in the field
[54:28] then the dry bones begin to come
[54:31] together and then there has to be a
[54:34] breath to make them living and see
[54:39] that's why you're you're dead until
[54:40] you're alive in Christ you're just a
[54:42] dead bunch of bones walking around all
[54:44] you really are brother Ram said
[54:47] cannon-fodder
[54:53] listen we really have no worth as a
[54:56] human being unless you're born again
[54:57] what worth do you have oh you can be you
[55:00] can be Bill Gates and you can be Donald
[55:02] Trump or you know any famous person yet
[55:05] but there's nobody more famous than the
[55:06] bride of Jesus Christ nobody nobody
[55:09] there's nobody walk the face of this
[55:11] earth more famous than you guys are
[55:12] nobody I mean you're talking about the
[55:15] Hall of Fame this one goes for an
[55:17] eternity all these other ones are gonna
[55:19] be dust and they're gonna be done away
[55:21] with and literally be ashes but you and
[55:27] I will not there's an eternal quality
[55:30] that man cannot give you notoriety and
[55:34] Fame on this earth is okay everybody
[55:36] likes to have their back padded and all
[55:37] that stuff but I'd rather be a child of
[55:40] God than in your laughs and they shall
[55:45] come thither and they shall take away
[55:47] all the detestable things that's what
[55:49] you're doing
[55:49] everything that you're doing in
[55:51] justification is a detestable thing
[55:54] don't tell me you did anything while you
[55:57] were out in the world that was that was
[55:58] nice and good and sweet oh yeah like I
[56:03] said before even you you take that all
[56:06] that list I showed you you're born again
[56:10] you know you don't have to you have to
[56:12] go around the line to your wife and you
[56:13] don't have to lie to your husband you
[56:14] don't lie to your kids
[56:16] people are the kids all the time then
[56:17] why they have to make up stories and
[56:18] things you know I'm not my Christians
[56:20] I'm talk about people in the world so
[56:22] you just it's just a snowball of sin and
[56:24] you just can't get out of that rat race
[56:26] that Satan's got you in and the sin just
[56:28] keeps piling up until you move over and
[56:32] get out of that thing and once you get
[56:35] out of that thing you start walking with
[56:37] God and everything he does is a blessing
[56:39] to you and they shall come through them
[56:43] they shall take away all the detestable
[56:45] things thereof and all the abominations
[56:46] therefrom see what what's God doing he's
[56:49] cleaning you up he's taking all the
[56:52] detestable things all the Obama all the
[56:54] abominations and I will give them one
[56:57] heart and I will put a new spirit within
[57:00] you now we're fixing to talk about
[57:01] justification
[57:02] I mean sanctification and I will take
[57:04] the Stoney heart out of your flesh
[57:06] what's a stony heart hard we all were
[57:12] hard-hearted before we got what into
[57:15] this walk of God come on we all were so
[57:19] God gives us a what a heart of flesh
[57:20] that's liable that God can mold and use
[57:24] because you know what if you're on the
[57:25] real journey of God he's the Potter
[57:27] you're the clay he's the one doing the
[57:30] molding he's the one doing the making
[57:32] and you know why he may have to start
[57:34] over again but it's the same lump of
[57:36] clay you know why he starts over because
[57:41] we decide to jump off the wheel
[57:43] have you ever watched somebody make
[57:45] pottery well we lived there I mean with
[57:47] you
[57:48] the pottery center of the United States
[57:50] of America and you watch them do that
[57:52] they throw this thing on there that just
[57:54] look it so muddy and filthy and it's
[57:59] just a pile of mud laying there but in
[58:01] the Masters hand he can make a beautiful
[58:04] design just with his fingers you don't
[58:07] have to go get this and that in the
[58:08] other and you know how to get it to God
[58:10] give him the tools he needed right here
[58:11] and he was starting he matches that
[58:13] thing in the middle then he reaches and
[58:15] gets it on the side and he brings the
[58:17] walls of that part up and then he makes
[58:19] a lip that's all he has to do makes a
[58:21] beautiful pie
[58:22] but then you got to put it in the keel
[58:24] then you got to put it in the fire cuz
[58:26] that's what we're fixing to get to with
[58:27] Abram Abrams got to go through the fire
[58:29] we all have to go through the fire but I
[58:33] will put them one heart and I will put a
[58:35] new spirit within you and I will take
[58:37] the Stoney heart out of your flesh and
[58:38] we'll give them a heart of flesh all
[58:41] right so let's go and let's look at
[58:45] sanctification we're gonna start in
[58:47] Genesis 15 but I'll read these two
[58:49] scriptures first if you want pull those
[58:51] up brother Joe Hebrews 2 verse 11 for
[58:55] both he that sanctifies and they who are
[58:58] sanctified are all of one you see how
[59:02] close we're getting with God now you're
[59:03] not one with God and justification
[59:05] you're starting your beginning but you
[59:07] still he can't he can't God will not
[59:10] dwell in an unclean vessel and you're
[59:12] still unclean at that period of time
[59:14] everybody got that all right now listen
[59:18] he's getting ready to reach in that soul
[59:21] and take that a damning nature that
[59:24] ungodly unclean nature and he's fixing
[59:26] to change it but he's got to go through
[59:28] a process everything's got to go through
[59:31] a process oh I wish that God would have
[59:33] in 1998 just Lois I wish God would have
[59:37] just said boom you're born again you're
[59:39] going to be preaching in 2020 and the
[59:42] roses start being thrown and the and and
[59:45] the party starts and we have cake and
[59:47] ice cream and you're right it's been a
[59:52] hard 20 something years but thank God
[59:55] for it because it's the journey
[59:59] for both he that sanctifies and they who
[1:00:01] are sanctified are all of one for which
[1:00:05] cause he is not ashamed to call us
[1:00:07] brethren a he he was ashamed to call you
[1:00:09] brethren even in justification because
[1:00:11] you still had that old Adamic nature you
[1:00:14] still had that old root of evil and you
[1:00:16] still were evil you are just coming into
[1:00:19] a place to where God can use you saying
[1:00:21] I will declare thy name unto my brethren
[1:00:23] in the midst of the church while I sing
[1:00:27] praise unto thee alright so now let's go
[1:00:30] to the next one ezekiel 36 verse 24
[1:00:32] through 26 for I will make you from take
[1:00:37] you from among the heathen oh did he not
[1:00:40] did he not take us from among the
[1:00:42] heathen hey man
[1:00:44] he took a heathen and brought him out of
[1:00:46] the heat of them heathenism
[1:00:47] for I will take you from among the
[1:00:49] heathen gather you out of all countries
[1:00:51] and will bring into your own land then I
[1:00:54] will sprinkle clean water upon you oh
[1:00:57] boy and you shall be clean
[1:01:00] sanctification cleaned and set aside for
[1:01:02] service for all your filthiness and from
[1:01:05] all your idols will I cleanse you what a
[1:01:10] promise a new heart also will I give you
[1:01:13] and then you spirit will I put within
[1:01:15] you now that's not the Holy Spirit amen
[1:01:19] I'll I'll read you're quoting them and
[1:01:22] if you need one a new heart also will I
[1:01:24] give you and a new spirit will i put
[1:01:26] within you and i will take away the
[1:01:29] stony heart out of your flesh and i will
[1:01:31] give you an heart of flesh so let's go
[1:01:33] to genesis 15 let's see what happened to
[1:01:36] abram now remember he's still abram now
[1:01:39] remember still in your journey through
[1:01:42] justification you're not a born-again
[1:01:44] believer at that time your soul is still
[1:01:47] dark and black thereby got that same am
[1:01:49] during sanctification when you come to
[1:01:51] your first part of sanctification the
[1:01:54] unclean spirit is still there it has to
[1:01:56] be driven out by the washing of water of
[1:02:00] the word by your journey he has to
[1:02:03] continually how you washed by the water
[1:02:05] of the word you listen to the word I
[1:02:09] don't want to hear no church sermons
[1:02:11] when I was in the world
[1:02:12] I avoided them now you can't avoid them
[1:02:19] now you can't avoid them because you
[1:02:23] want to know more about God you want to
[1:02:24] know more they say after these things
[1:02:26] they look that keyword right there that
[1:02:30] key phrase we went through Genesis 12
[1:02:32] through 14 in justification in the life
[1:02:35] of Abram and the Bible says after these
[1:02:39] things so in other words you've got to
[1:02:42] do them but after you do them this is
[1:02:45] what the next part of your journey is
[1:02:48] after these things the word of the Lord
[1:02:50] now listen there wasn't no word of the
[1:02:53] Lord back then look there was no word of
[1:02:56] the Lord
[1:02:57] in other words Abram didn't walk over
[1:02:59] and pick up a Bible there was no such
[1:03:01] thing he didn't even go and pick up the
[1:03:03] scroll they weren't written yet so the
[1:03:07] word of the Lord came spoken to Abram
[1:03:12] and said in a vision look it's come
[1:03:16] closer now in a vision
[1:03:17] fear not Abram whatever is fixing to
[1:03:20] happen I'm on the scene and I'm gonna
[1:03:22] take care of you because you're fixing
[1:03:23] to go because remember sanctification
[1:03:25] see justification you're still you know
[1:03:28] you're one guy in you you still got that
[1:03:30] unclean spirit in you but you like I
[1:03:32] said you got that little halo of light
[1:03:34] you got a little something that's
[1:03:36] churning it's not in here yet but it's
[1:03:39] right here and it's working Satan hates
[1:03:43] it he don't even like to feel that thing
[1:03:46] not that true that true no he ain't
[1:03:51] taking them personate lights and the
[1:03:53] winnings and all that stuff but that one
[1:03:55] that's fixing to make you a born-again
[1:03:57] believer he hates it told us Jesus
[1:04:00] Christ himself
[1:04:02] in the form of the Holyoke hey man
[1:04:06] everybody got that cuz I'm gonna read it
[1:04:07] to you in a minute what happens to Abram
[1:04:09] in his journey
[1:04:10] so here's Abram he keeps walking so fear
[1:04:14] not Abram something's fixing to be tore
[1:04:17] out of you
[1:04:19] sanctification is when God tears that
[1:04:22] unclean spirit out of you and it's
[1:04:25] violent
[1:04:26] didn't Jesus tell us he said I didn't
[1:04:29] come to bring peace I've come to bring
[1:04:31] violence because the kingdom has of God
[1:04:35] has to be taken by what no no no no no
[1:04:45] no no no no no Michael goes oh wait did
[1:04:59] tickle they shouldn't tickle should've
[1:05:01] hurt where's my real knife but that's
[1:05:04] what happens because you know what Satan
[1:05:06] is comfortable inside you that's where
[1:05:10] he's been for a while he's comfortable
[1:05:13] yeah but when you get to where you start
[1:05:15] listening the Word of God and you start
[1:05:18] doing the things of God tell me what
[1:05:20] happens it's a battle and it's not it's
[1:05:24] bloody it's force it's not that no the
[1:05:31] Lord comes and says I've come to take
[1:05:33] over that's mine and I've come to take
[1:05:36] over so what does he do fear not Abram I
[1:05:40] am thy shield and thy exceeding great
[1:05:46] reward what a promise and Abram said now
[1:05:52] if you'll boy brother Dale long if we go
[1:05:55] back to this it'll take another sermon
[1:05:57] brother Dale preach a sermon about this
[1:06:02] the the wording of Lord and God and the
[1:06:04] capital and all that but when I get into
[1:06:06] that but watch what that's never been
[1:06:09] spoken from 12 till now everybody got
[1:06:14] that
[1:06:15] those of you that have been through all
[1:06:17] this before all the years you know that
[1:06:18] that position now puts Lord God it
[1:06:22] brings closeness even even Scofield
[1:06:27] picks it up if you got your Scofield
[1:06:29] Bible here it says hang on a minute yeah
[1:06:35] I lick my fingers start about there I
[1:06:37] don't wash my hands
[1:06:39] Lord God even Lord God Lord is a tone I
[1:06:45] and Lord God is Adonai Jehovah which
[1:06:51] brings that he's never called that
[1:06:52] before so here is what are you saying
[1:06:55] brother way God's getting closer and
[1:06:57] closer and closer to having that full
[1:07:02] dominion over you Lord Jehovah I don't I
[1:07:05] I am I in other words I've come to take
[1:07:08] over a neighbor and said Lord God never
[1:07:10] said that before
[1:07:11] he always said Lord and the Lord
[1:07:13] appeared and God appeared and all these
[1:07:15] different things but if you want to get
[1:07:16] that sermon maybe Joe can find it it's
[1:07:17] been long mercy 10 or 15 years ago
[1:07:20] because that means something the capital
[1:07:23] Ord the capital capital al the little
[1:07:25] Ord are the big G little Oh luli it all
[1:07:30] means something it's not just it's not
[1:07:31] just somebody made a mistake there's a
[1:07:35] position in there and the scholars when
[1:07:37] they translated the Bible they noticed
[1:07:40] that position that God was in so you'll
[1:07:43] see sometimes capital L capital o
[1:07:45] capital R capital D like you see in the
[1:07:47] in the Book of Revelations you see king
[1:07:49] of kings and Lord of lords
[1:07:51] you see capital K but a lowercase but
[1:07:54] when you go over to revelations 19 I
[1:07:56] believe it is when he rides back in the
[1:07:58] Millennium with us
[1:07:59] all capital letters why it's in his
[1:08:01] fullness and then you ought to listen to
[1:08:04] that because brother down don't beaten
[1:08:05] watch your hand watch your weekend he's
[1:08:09] he said I'm taking for myself okay
[1:08:12] don't shake your shoulder up there too
[1:08:14] much but that means that's the position
[1:08:17] in other words that never happened in
[1:08:20] justification in his walk
[1:08:21] it was either Lord or God glory calf
[1:08:23] there's a position now watch as God is
[1:08:27] coming and brain
[1:08:28] more revelation more vision right saying
[1:08:34] fear not Abram in other words you're
[1:08:36] fixing to go through something that
[1:08:39] nobody else's went through before you're
[1:08:41] fixing to go through something that's
[1:08:43] going to look horrible but I'm in it and
[1:08:47] Abram said Lord God what will they'll
[1:08:51] give me seeing I go childless now Abram
[1:08:54] is bringing the promise that God made
[1:08:55] back to him he said now God I was 75 now
[1:09:01] I'm in my eighties it's not looking real
[1:09:04] good but what God say fear not Abram I
[1:09:07] got this thing handled seeing I go
[1:09:10] childless in the store to my house as
[1:09:12] this Eliezer of Damascus and Abram said
[1:09:16] Behold to me thou hast given no seed and
[1:09:19] lo one born in my house is my ner scroll
[1:09:24] all the way up to the top so think see
[1:09:25] now look and behold the word of the Lord
[1:09:28] now here we go wasn't into what written
[1:09:30] in the book God had to tell Abram saying
[1:09:33] this shall not be thine heir he tell
[1:09:35] Minnelli's or not God God said Abram I
[1:09:38] told you what I was gonna do so let me
[1:09:41] handle it okay let me handle it because
[1:09:44] if you start handling it you're gonna
[1:09:46] mess up and he did cuz remember God said
[1:09:51] he would have a promised son he said all
[1:09:53] these things but he never he never
[1:09:54] reveals the whole plan to us because we
[1:09:56] can't stand it it's like somebody was
[1:10:00] talking about in the Youth Bible studies
[1:10:04] they was talking about the seals and the
[1:10:05] different things and explaining the
[1:10:06] third pull you know
[1:10:09] let's get them born again first you can
[1:10:13] explain I've had the third pull explain
[1:10:15] to me since I was 14 years old and I
[1:10:17] hardly know much more about it than I
[1:10:19] did then but you do know more but that
[1:10:22] wasn't part of my salvation that wasn't
[1:10:24] that's not going to get you in the
[1:10:25] rapture now you will be a recipient of
[1:10:28] it but knowing it will not get you there
[1:10:32] at this point
[1:10:34] this point in Abraham's life listen
[1:10:38] remember that that time when you were it
[1:10:42] was a tender parting a lot in your
[1:10:44] journey to me it was a tender part
[1:10:46] because man you you're getting this
[1:10:48] unclean spirit you're getting it driven
[1:10:50] out of you something that's really
[1:10:52] comfortable that you really enjoyed and
[1:10:54] you really humanely don't want to get
[1:10:56] rid of it hello somebody be honest but
[1:11:01] then you come to a place like you said
[1:11:03] you come to place and said get rid of
[1:11:06] this thing you've tried to do it
[1:11:09] yourself your mama tried to do it your
[1:11:11] sisters tried to do it extra would love
[1:11:14] that try to beat it out of ya and she's
[1:11:17] going
[1:11:20] see that's Catholicism penance you don't
[1:11:28] have to do none of that
[1:11:29] just let go and let God let go of that
[1:11:32] demon cuz you're pulling on the demon on
[1:11:34] this side Thank You Damon and and hear
[1:11:37] hear and God God pull it over on this
[1:11:40] side i'ma rip that thing but here's the
[1:11:44] devil and I want this guy but what's God
[1:11:46] saying he's mine somebody's gotta let go
[1:11:51] hey man so you finally decided who was
[1:11:55] gonna let go and it was you cuz you were
[1:11:58] the one that was holding both of them
[1:12:00] they weren't holding you you were
[1:12:01] pulling on them hello you was the one
[1:12:06] who had the struggle God did have a
[1:12:08] struggle he knew what she's gonna do the
[1:12:09] devil was struggling cuz he was fixing
[1:12:11] to lose you but you just let go and took
[1:12:18] God he said don't worry Abram I still
[1:12:22] got you don't worry about I know I told
[1:12:25] you you gonna have a promise sir I told
[1:12:27] you you're gonna have all these kids
[1:12:29] that you can't even you can't even count
[1:12:30] the sand on the on the on the ocean what
[1:12:33] about that you ever tried to count just
[1:12:35] that much of a saying in the ocean can't
[1:12:37] count it so God said Oh Lord what and
[1:12:41] you do that in sanctification you come
[1:12:43] to a place you feel like a baby that
[1:12:44] just come out of a womb you're like
[1:12:47] it's cold I've been in this warm place
[1:12:49] and everything's been alright and I've
[1:12:51] been floating in water for nine months
[1:12:53] and now I gotta breathe enough oh good
[1:12:56] grief I need to eat yeah that's what
[1:12:59] happened you've been put in a different
[1:13:02] environment
[1:13:03] that's why environment is very very
[1:13:06] important
[1:13:06] Abrams Abrams environment was very very
[1:13:10] important where he went where he went
[1:13:12] and when he come out of and when he went
[1:13:14] and come out of like I said before he
[1:13:16] went down there and helped blot and got
[1:13:18] a lot out of the situation he was in but
[1:13:20] he didn't stay down there he went back
[1:13:21] up to his property and then okay and he
[1:13:25] brought him forth abroad instead look
[1:13:27] now toward heaven he brings Abram right
[1:13:30] back around tells him the same promise
[1:13:32] he told him cuz you know what sometimes
[1:13:34] we have to be told over and over and
[1:13:37] over again Amanda that still now and he
[1:13:45] brought him forth abroad and said look
[1:13:46] now toward heaven and tell the Stars if
[1:13:49] they'll be able to number them he said
[1:13:50] unto Him so shall thy seed be now what
[1:13:56] look in Abraham's humanity he probably
[1:14:01] was still doubting cuz we always doubt
[1:14:04] our first deal is to doubt our first
[1:14:09] human thing is is why who when where how
[1:14:13] the Bible says he believed in the Lord
[1:14:16] and the Lord counted to him for
[1:14:19] righteousness
[1:14:19] right there he believed that God
[1:14:23] whatever you're gonna do I can't do it
[1:14:26] you're gonna have to do it and he said
[1:14:28] unto him I am the Lord and hers that I
[1:14:30] am I am
[1:14:32] the Lord that brought thee out he goes
[1:14:35] back and tells him said look you
[1:14:36] remember that journey you just started
[1:14:38] in a few years ago I'm still the same
[1:14:40] person
[1:14:41] I'm still the same guy that's gonna
[1:14:43] bring you out of all this I am the Lord
[1:14:46] that brought thee out of ur of Chaldees
[1:14:48] to give thee this land to inherit it
[1:14:52] what's the land we're inheriting not
[1:14:54] physical land but the baptism of the
[1:14:56] Holy Ghost the promise is what you and I
[1:14:57] have claims to sure we're going to
[1:15:00] I can live on this earth but if you
[1:15:02] don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:04] it's gonna be tough to get back to this
[1:15:06] piece of property and he said Lord God
[1:15:09] here he is again Lord God and I'm
[1:15:11] intimately talking with whoever this
[1:15:14] person is now whereby shall I know that
[1:15:17] I shall inherit it and he said to him
[1:15:20] take me an heifer now watch this is
[1:15:22] where it gets a little tricky and watch
[1:15:26] what God makes Abram go through and
[1:15:28] without a prophet we would just read
[1:15:31] over this and wonder what in the world
[1:15:33] does a why is he going through all this
[1:15:35] but I'm gonna read you some quotes
[1:15:37] afterwards
[1:15:38] what brother Brown said about this part
[1:15:41] of Abraham's journey but we're gonna
[1:15:42] read it just like it is in the Bible
[1:15:46] now watch and he said unto Him take me
[1:15:47] an heifer of three years brother and
[1:15:49] says watch that three three years old
[1:15:52] and a she-goat of three years old and
[1:15:56] you know what a she-goat was used for in
[1:15:58] the Bible
[1:15:59] remember rams was made for sacrifice for
[1:16:02] Jesus like was a type in Jesus Christ
[1:16:06] you know what does she go this she goat
[1:16:13] according to numbers 15 27 was an
[1:16:17] ignorance offering if you ignorantly
[1:16:21] done something and didn't know the law
[1:16:23] and didn't know the you know the what
[1:16:25] you know the law of the land you could
[1:16:28] take a she-goat and kill a she-goat
[1:16:30] for an ignorance offering and God would
[1:16:32] forgive you for your ignorance praise
[1:16:36] God we're all pretty ignorant
[1:16:43] give me a she-goat but what's he doing
[1:16:47] ever a she-goat
[1:16:50] so there's his ignorance offering a ram
[1:16:54] typing Christ if three years old and a
[1:16:57] Turtledove and a young pigeon now you
[1:17:00] bring the Turtledove and a young pigeon
[1:17:01] in a little bit later but do you know
[1:17:04] what that's an offering for we'll get to
[1:17:07] it in a minute
[1:17:08] and he took into him all these and
[1:17:11] divided them in the myths
[1:17:13] now Abram all these pieces of these
[1:17:17] animals are laying on this altar cut up
[1:17:21] in pieces but the but the birds divided
[1:17:26] he not that is an offering for healing
[1:17:37] signifying that it's not going to be
[1:17:39] torn apart well well let brother branham
[1:17:42] explain it later
[1:17:43] he took unto him that now what are you
[1:17:45] doing brother listen Abraham's journey
[1:17:48] this is his sanctification journey this
[1:17:50] is where God's gonna clean him up and
[1:17:52] put him into service so he's got to go
[1:17:54] through all these sacrifices listen
[1:17:58] folks honestly it's a sacrifice to come
[1:18:01] to church I know we want to come I know
[1:18:02] there's something in my heart that wants
[1:18:04] to come to church but it's a sacrifice
[1:18:07] never brother Branham told that guy he
[1:18:09] said you had a you had a horrible fight
[1:18:11] between church and here and he said
[1:18:14] brother what happened he said I got into
[1:18:15] church but he just didn't see that the
[1:18:17] demons and everything else and he had
[1:18:18] all these problems and like I was
[1:18:20] telling y'all last Sunday they the
[1:18:21] church that's where the guy kept seeing
[1:18:23] the husband a wife before they walked in
[1:18:24] the door they would hold hands and they
[1:18:26] would pray and they said all that's so
[1:18:27] sweet and so wonderful said brother
[1:18:29] that's good that you pray to getting
[1:18:30] right he said brother we prayed to get
[1:18:32] that spirit off of us cuz we've been
[1:18:33] arguing since we left the house so at
[1:18:37] least they didn't bring it in here how
[1:18:39] many of y'all do that
[1:18:45] hmm they won't stop and have a drink of
[1:18:49] water on now if you don't bring it in if
[1:18:58] you don't bring it in here it makes the
[1:19:01] service go a whole lot better
[1:19:03] that's why singing drives unclean
[1:19:06] spirits out David always played and Saul
[1:19:12] spirit was quieted because of the that's
[1:19:14] why we have a song service all right so
[1:19:16] he took all these now watch the here's
[1:19:18] Abraham's walk with God hearing
[1:19:19] sanctification and I'll let brother
[1:19:21] Brahm explain all this but I'll come in
[1:19:23] as we go through and then we'll stop
[1:19:25] here in just a minute on we will do the
[1:19:27] Holy Ghost later on and he took unto him
[1:19:30] all these and divided them in the midst
[1:19:32] and ladies peace one against another but
[1:19:35] the birds divided he not and when the
[1:19:37] fowls with them foul spirits and they're
[1:19:47] right there when them foul spirits come
[1:19:50] Abram drove him away because you know
[1:19:52] what them foul spirits are gonna keep
[1:19:53] trying to come back remember the unclean
[1:19:56] spirit goes out of a man walking Dry
[1:19:58] places seeking Fred finest none turns
[1:20:00] right around and wants to go back to the
[1:20:02] comfort of his house but Abram had
[1:20:06] enough about him in his journey where
[1:20:08] Abram stood there and drove those foul
[1:20:11] spirits off of those carcasses because
[1:20:14] those carcasses were sacrifices all
[1:20:17] right everybody okay with that we're
[1:20:19] getting somewhere with this this is we
[1:20:21] look this is the more intimate even at
[1:20:24] this point when you see Abraham's
[1:20:26] journey he had nothing to do with it now
[1:20:30] God is going to bring Abram to a place
[1:20:33] to where he's going to need him to do
[1:20:34] these things but then he's gonna put him
[1:20:36] to sleep watch this and when the Sun was
[1:20:44] going down brother Braun said it was in
[1:20:45] the evening time when the Sun was going
[1:20:48] down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo
[1:20:52] a horror of great darkness fell upon him
[1:20:54] and he said unto Abram
[1:20:57] no of a surety that thy seed shall be a
[1:21:00] stranger in the land that is not theirs
[1:21:02] and shall serve them and they shall
[1:21:05] afflict them for hundred years what say
[1:21:07] what's he telling Abram you're can't
[1:21:09] your people the children of Israel are
[1:21:11] gonna go in bondage for 400 years nobody
[1:21:15] got that right and also that nation whom
[1:21:19] they shall serve will I judge and
[1:21:20] afterwards shall they come out with a
[1:21:22] great substance that's Moses bringing
[1:21:24] the people out of Egypt remember because
[1:21:26] what is Redemption coming out and going
[1:21:28] in and thou shalt go to thy fathers in
[1:21:31] peace as I shall be buried in a good old
[1:21:32] age what a promise some of us are
[1:21:37] reaching that pinnacle but in the fourth
[1:21:40] generation they shall come hither again
[1:21:42] for the iniquity of the Amorites is not
[1:21:44] yet fulfilled now remember what did the
[1:21:47] angel tell brother Branham when he was
[1:21:49] getting ready to go to Israel he said
[1:21:51] you can't go there because the iniquity
[1:21:54] of the amorite is not full yet he said
[1:21:57] but it's getting pretty full so that
[1:21:59] prophecy has come right down to today
[1:22:02] and it came to pass that when the Sun
[1:22:04] went down and it was dark and behold a
[1:22:07] smoking furnace and a burning lamp that
[1:22:10] passed between a light a burning lamp
[1:22:13] passed between these pieces in the same
[1:22:15] day the Lord made a covenant with Abram
[1:22:17] now he'd made one with him before it was
[1:22:21] unconditional I have no watch but he
[1:22:24] says look this is the land grant in the
[1:22:27] same day the Lord made a covenant with
[1:22:29] Abram now see that capital is L capital
[1:22:31] L capital old capital R capital D maybe
[1:22:34] brother Dale will preach that again
[1:22:36] maybe maybe brother della preached that
[1:22:38] again and those of us that have not been
[1:22:40] around for a while okay all right
[1:22:44] he'll preach whatever y'all want him to
[1:22:46] write that's what brother Braun said you
[1:22:50] pull on the preacher and you make him
[1:22:51] preach what do you want what you need in
[1:22:53] the same day the Lord capital L or D
[1:22:56] made a covenant with Abram saying unto
[1:22:59] thy seed have I given this land from the
[1:23:01] river a to the great river the river
[1:23:02] now this is natural land he's giving him
[1:23:06] this natural land so you got to keep the
[1:23:07] natural story in there some all right
[1:23:10] the K Knights cannot
[1:23:11] catamites Hittites / sites refuse
[1:23:14] amirite Canaanites
[1:23:16] gege site Jeb shots web sites those web
[1:23:25] sites is the ones we got to get rid of
[1:23:27] then web sites all they might okay
[1:23:30] though that you've not heard that you
[1:23:33] haven't been around a while now look
[1:23:37] let's explain now if you want to stop
[1:23:40] that brother Joe let's read what brother
[1:23:42] Brown says about this because I want him
[1:23:43] to explain it and it won't be me
[1:23:45] explaining it to be him brother Brown
[1:23:47] preached on the unconditional covenant
[1:23:50] 1954 there you go thank you
[1:23:53] what's closed now when he then when he
[1:23:56] came down the Holy Spirit to talk to
[1:23:59] Abraham in the garden out there where he
[1:24:01] was laying on the hill he put a burr ham
[1:24:03] to sleep now Abram it should be Abram
[1:24:07] but we hear brother Brown says Abraham
[1:24:08] you haven't got one thing to do with it
[1:24:11] alright you lay here now and Abraham
[1:24:13] went to sleep you're out of the picture
[1:24:16] and the next thing now what's God go to
[1:24:20] do
[1:24:21] he's confirming and given an evidence
[1:24:24] when you come to sanctification God is
[1:24:27] obligated to give you an evidence of
[1:24:29] where you're at because you unclean
[1:24:31] spirits going out something I mean
[1:24:32] you're you're standing there completely
[1:24:34] empty God's got to come in and show you
[1:24:40] what he's doing he did me I don't know
[1:24:42] you gonna have to realize he did it for
[1:24:44] you he's given an evidence or a proof to
[1:24:49] Abraham how he's gonna do it how he's
[1:24:53] gonna do it listen if you want to be
[1:24:55] healed how he's gonna do that this then
[1:24:59] Abraham I'm shutting you out of the
[1:25:01] picture I'm putting you to sleep then
[1:25:04] before Abram came a black thickness
[1:25:06] after look every sinner deserves to go
[1:25:09] to hell because remember you're still a
[1:25:10] sinner until you're born again you're
[1:25:13] still a sinner God does not reside in
[1:25:17] your soul until the new birth everybody
[1:25:19] got that same man
[1:25:22] so you're not out of the woods yet Abram
[1:25:25] was not out of the woods he was still in
[1:25:26] trouble he still needed a sacrifice he
[1:25:28] still needed a light to appear every
[1:25:33] sinner deserves to go to hell blackness
[1:25:35] then after that of smoking burning
[1:25:38] furnace every sinner deserving in other
[1:25:40] words hell
[1:25:41] Abraham that's what you deserve but
[1:25:44] beyond that when a little white light
[1:25:48] that little white light went right
[1:25:51] between those pieces of sacrifice right
[1:25:53] back and forth the white light moving
[1:25:55] showing making a confirmation showing to
[1:25:59] Abraham that he would do someday through
[1:26:02] his seed Isaac bringing on Christ for
[1:26:05] the supreme sacrifice now hidden life in
[1:26:08] Christ 1955 let's read that one you see
[1:26:14] people it's nice people because remember
[1:26:17] the unclean spirits going out right at
[1:26:22] sanctification the unclean spirit goes
[1:26:24] out of sanctification and then God
[1:26:25] brings you to a position watch what he
[1:26:27] does you've seen people that was nice
[1:26:29] people but you just couldn't hardly
[1:26:30] stand to be around them there's some
[1:26:32] there's something about them they got a
[1:26:35] creative power around them that just
[1:26:36] seems to be different how I'd like to
[1:26:39] stop here if I was possible and tell you
[1:26:41] some things on that you're a little
[1:26:42] created yourself he said he'd give you a
[1:26:46] new spirit now we'll go back to Ezekiel
[1:26:47] he said he'd give you a new spirit now
[1:26:50] that spirit isn't God's Spirit everybody
[1:26:53] got that that's your spirit God gives
[1:26:59] you a new spirit then he says I'll put
[1:27:02] my spirit in him that's that the new
[1:27:04] birth we'll cover that a little bit
[1:27:06] later but the thing God has to do is
[1:27:09] give you a new spirit Abram he has to
[1:27:12] tell you the sacrifice has already been
[1:27:15] made it's laying out here before you and
[1:27:18] I'm gonna pass that little white light
[1:27:20] that's been following you I'm gonna run
[1:27:23] it through these sacrifices and I'm
[1:27:25] gonna tell you that I'm the one that's
[1:27:26] gonna do it not you because what happens
[1:27:30] to that light at the new birth it goes
[1:27:33] inside
[1:27:34] I'll put my spirit in him but the thing
[1:27:36] God has to do is give you a new spirit
[1:27:39] maker now look it's it doesn't say
[1:27:41] change your nature it says make your
[1:27:43] nature a little more gentle and settle
[1:27:46] down or he couldn't even live with you
[1:27:49] so he has to get you fixed up first
[1:27:52] Thank You Kentucky English so he have to
[1:27:56] get you fixed up first before he can
[1:27:58] come in in other words God's just not
[1:28:00] going to take and say well alright
[1:28:02] you're justified you start your journey
[1:28:03] you still got the unclean spirit but I'm
[1:28:05] fixing to write inside of you know you
[1:28:09] don't work that way you know what you
[1:28:12] wouldn't know how to handle it you
[1:28:14] wouldn't know how to handle I've always
[1:28:15] said the reason that God sent
[1:28:17] justification sanctification baptism the
[1:28:19] Holy Ghost is to see how to communicate
[1:28:21] with God and how God is going to deal
[1:28:23] with you and brother Branham came on the
[1:28:25] scene right after the Pentecostal church
[1:28:27] if he would have came on the scene right
[1:28:28] after a lucre nobody would have accepted
[1:28:30] me they thought he's crazy but but
[1:28:33] coming up with the Pentecostals God had
[1:28:35] moved out into the Pentecostal age so
[1:28:38] that was Pentecostals everywhere so
[1:28:40] brother I'm just slid right in and fit
[1:28:41] right in with him if he didn't went in a
[1:28:43] Lutheran Church at first no so I same
[1:28:48] way with God he's getting you ready to
[1:28:52] dwell inside of you because God's not
[1:28:54] gonna dwell in an unclean vessel so he
[1:28:57] has to get you fixed up first before he
[1:28:59] can come in I'll give you a new spirit
[1:29:01] then you take him anywhere you go all
[1:29:05] kinds of places he's got to get you
[1:29:07] fixed so you can entertain him right
[1:29:12] you're an entertaining God right where
[1:29:14] you neither was I a man but we come to a
[1:29:17] place to where now we entertain God the
[1:29:20] right way let's go to number four the
[1:29:23] Intervale notice you put a new spirit
[1:29:28] God has to give you a new spirit or you
[1:29:31] couldn't even get along with him you
[1:29:34] can't get along with yourself
[1:29:39] that old devil spirit you had in you
[1:29:43] sweet little sweet sweetly sweetly look
[1:29:50] out sweet devil devil yeah all the way
[1:29:56] at least my own nose that was the truth
[1:29:59] if you'll admit it God can help you wow
[1:30:05] that's confession that's why that's why
[1:30:10] the confession is good for the soul you
[1:30:12] had to confess cuz you know what you
[1:30:14] were harboring all that illness Nolet
[1:30:16] junk your that was inside of your nose
[1:30:19] eating you up but get it out confess
[1:30:25] your faults one to the other even few
[1:30:27] Christians get faster Falls one or the
[1:30:29] other
[1:30:30] you don't like me as your problem sorry
[1:30:37] mmm just kidding so he's got to put a
[1:30:42] new spirit in you so you can get along
[1:30:43] with his spirit amen
[1:30:46] oh here man to self I will put a new
[1:30:49] spirit in them and I will put my spirit
[1:30:51] in them now that's not the plaintiff
[1:30:53] ocation that's going on to put when he
[1:30:55] says my who's writing the Bible God and
[1:30:59] he's the my I'm gonna put my spirit in
[1:31:02] them and he said look but he said after
[1:31:05] he's give you a new spirit that's you
[1:31:09] don't get it confused with God's Spirit
[1:31:12] it's not it's your new spirit so you can
[1:31:17] get along with the Holy Spirit if he
[1:31:19] ever gives it to you oh brother Branson
[1:31:23] if he ever gives it to you but that's
[1:31:26] that unclean spirit and we see if we
[1:31:30] could keep on but we'll stop right there
[1:31:31] oh because remember Sarah Sarah gets
[1:31:34] involved and although Sarah is the womb
[1:31:42] that that's got that the child's got to
[1:31:44] come through naturally speaking you got
[1:31:47] that she was not a believer at first
[1:31:51] and she talked to Abram and said Abram
[1:31:56] you and I have been listen this is devil
[1:31:58] logic you and I have been living
[1:32:00] together for 40-something years and we
[1:32:02] ever produced a child but I got this
[1:32:04] right here I got this woman Hagar and
[1:32:06] it's lawful it's legal under what they
[1:32:09] were living under it's legal but it
[1:32:11] wasn't legal Dov God because God is
[1:32:15] going to bring that promised son through
[1:32:17] Abraham and Sarah not Hagar so you see
[1:32:24] what happens even in sanctification we
[1:32:26] still make mistakes we still miss the
[1:32:29] direction of God we still do things
[1:32:31] wrong but we're one step a little bit
[1:32:33] closer to what to get in that new spirit
[1:32:37] so that God can work on that new spirit
[1:32:40] because brother Ram tells us in
[1:32:41] sanctification you become into a
[1:32:43] religious order where you become
[1:32:46] religious you become thinking more
[1:32:48] religious but be careful otherwise I've
[1:32:50] always stated be careful in that
[1:32:53] position because Satan can say oh that's
[1:32:57] the new birth you shouted you've read
[1:32:59] forward message books this week hadn't
[1:33:01] you so it's the devil if I'm read more
[1:33:04] now oh I've been in the message for 50
[1:33:07] years I'm sitting here I listen to tapes
[1:33:10] every day that don't mean one thing to
[1:33:12] go not one because that would be by
[1:33:17] works that covenant was not by works
[1:33:21] that covenant was by grace are you saved
[1:33:25] through what faith the faith of Abraham
[1:33:27] that is now working in you and I but if
[1:33:30] you stay in that sanctified condition
[1:33:32] because remember the unclean spirit goes
[1:33:34] out God doesn't put his spirit in yet so
[1:33:38] you're kind of sitting there empty in
[1:33:40] limbo because the Bible says that he
[1:33:43] goes and not only goes back into the
[1:33:45] vessel he brings seven more of his demon
[1:33:47] buddies with him and he enters into you
[1:33:50] and makes you religious now cuz Satan
[1:33:52] knows that there's something changed you
[1:33:55] want to go to church okay it's fine you
[1:33:57] go to church but you think about all the
[1:33:58] other things you want to do and you can
[1:34:00] you know you can say well this prophets
[1:34:02] wrong and he's this and this and that
[1:34:04] you
[1:34:04] just keep piling up and you sit there
[1:34:05] all time it's happening all over the
[1:34:07] world people send a message churches but
[1:34:10] there's got to come a time that Abram
[1:34:13] had to make a decision to become Abraham
[1:34:16] and his decision was God I'm gonna just
[1:34:20] keep walking I'm gonna just keep going
[1:34:24] I might that's okay Sarah let's have a
[1:34:28] child over here well Hagar that's okay
[1:34:30] I'll do that naturally but that had
[1:34:32] nothing to do with the promise of God
[1:34:34] that was just a side note because the
[1:34:38] Bible says talks about the bond woman in
[1:34:42] the free woman you and I were born under
[1:34:45] the bond woman we were bound but when we
[1:34:50] were born again of the free woman free
[1:34:55] means a lot different than bound because
[1:34:58] we remember you are bound until you're
[1:35:02] loosed you're bound by Satan until God
[1:35:06] comes in and looses you of that and then
[1:35:09] you become free Oh young people even
[1:35:12] adults listen you're never you say oh
[1:35:15] I've got freedom you did
[1:35:17] I got freedom I go whatever I want to do
[1:35:20] and I yeah I can do whatever I want good
[1:35:21] gun I'm gonna put on the feeling I'm
[1:35:25] good I'm I'm fine I'm all right no you
[1:35:29] ain't all right you dead you're dead
[1:35:31] you're dead you got so many demons on
[1:35:34] you don't even know what to do but Abram
[1:35:37] said okay that's all right if I got all
[1:35:39] that you name them all you want to but
[1:35:40] uh and I might have a little side note
[1:35:42] over here you know Hagar we got it okay
[1:35:45] well it was until God changed his name
[1:35:49] till he come to a place in his journey
[1:35:51] to where he looked at God and he said
[1:35:53] god I can't do this no more I'm sick and
[1:35:58] tired of being sick and tired
[1:36:02] I'm sick and tired of being sick and
[1:36:04] tired I'm sick and tired of somebody
[1:36:06] telling me that this demon is better
[1:36:08] than this one that this person says all
[1:36:10] you need to go you know feeling
[1:36:12] fulfilled the promise of God you didn't
[1:36:14] go to another Church you you need to you
[1:36:20] let go and let God so that's what Abram
[1:36:26] did Abram did sure he listened to Hagar
[1:36:30] but what became of that Union it was not
[1:36:33] a promised son
[1:36:34] it was Ishmael the wild child that God
[1:36:39] you know what God did give him a promise
[1:36:43] it's not one you won't but he gave him
[1:36:47] all the promise he said you'll be a wild
[1:36:49] child and everybody will be against you
[1:36:51] and you won't be against everybody now
[1:36:53] he didn't give that to Isaac Isaac was
[1:36:56] the promised son not Ishmael it's why
[1:37:01] you got that fight going on it's most
[1:37:04] thought he was a wild child he fought
[1:37:06] everything and everybody let me steer
[1:37:09] him he shall be a wild man his hand will
[1:37:13] be against every man now that don't
[1:37:15] sound like a Christian and every man's
[1:37:17] hand against him and he shall dwell in
[1:37:21] the presence of all his brethren in
[1:37:22] other words you know I'm gonna be able
[1:37:23] to get rid of him that Damon that came
[1:37:26] out of you he's not dead he just moved
[1:37:31] over in another place called your
[1:37:34] brother or your sister and that's where
[1:37:38] you persecution I'm talking about that
[1:37:42] one but that's what I mean but you come
[1:37:49] to a place to where you just deal like
[1:37:50] Abram and say look Lord there lays all
[1:37:53] the sacrifices there lays everything the
[1:37:56] turtledoves to the I've done everything
[1:37:59] you've told me to do this and I've
[1:38:00] killed all these animals I've laid them
[1:38:02] out here and now Lord if you don't come
[1:38:04] on the scene I'm good as a dead man so
[1:38:07] he puts Abram to sleep and he shows him
[1:38:09] that that's what he deserves
[1:38:11] he deserves hell every one of us deserve
[1:38:14] but now we're seeing the difference is
[1:38:16] if we do the right thing of God then we
[1:38:18] don't have to go there so when Abram
[1:38:20] wakes back up what does God do God
[1:38:22] brings that light he brings that eternal
[1:38:26] light and he runs it in between all them
[1:38:29] sacrifices like brother Brown was saying
[1:38:30] he said that showing God I'm Abraham I'm
[1:38:34] Abram I'm showing you that I'm gonna
[1:38:36] send a promise son and he's got to die
[1:38:38] on a cross and he's gonna be the
[1:38:40] ultimate sacrifice and people are going
[1:38:43] to get born again because of that
[1:38:45] now Abram you're in another time you're
[1:38:47] not you're going to be a comparison of
[1:38:50] their journey but you're not ever going
[1:38:52] to experience what they experienced I've
[1:38:55] put your sleep you're in you're in
[1:38:56] another dimension you're in another as
[1:38:59] we were talking about the other day
[1:39:01] we now have an updated revelation Abram
[1:39:06] had a revelation but he really didn't
[1:39:07] know who God was the person the person
[1:39:11] the person of God never was inside of
[1:39:13] him the person of God now though is
[1:39:16] inside of each and every one of us that
[1:39:18] Lord God that Abram talked to was
[1:39:22] standing on the earth one day and they
[1:39:24] looked at me and you look fifty years
[1:39:25] old he said before Abraham was I am
[1:39:33] now they look to him and probably went
[1:39:37] eight hundred years now
[1:39:39] you ain't her ears old know what inside
[1:39:42] of him we're standing there and said
[1:39:45] Abram get up and walk and Abram communed
[1:39:50] with that same theophany that was
[1:39:52] standing in Jesus Christ so you and I
[1:39:55] have a better situation though that same
[1:39:57] theophany is not just talking to us it
[1:40:00] now by the new birth is residing inside
[1:40:02] of us but it all begins being the faith
[1:40:12] seed of Abraham that's where it all
[1:40:16] begins
[1:40:17] next time we preach we'll start in
[1:40:21] Genesis chapter 17 which shows the new
[1:40:25] birth Abram was ninety years old
[1:40:27] 9 sister value not at all because
[1:40:33] Abraham Abrams started his real journey
[1:40:36] at 99 when God came to him and said
[1:40:41] you're not gonna be able many more I you
[1:40:44] can't bring a promised child as Abram
[1:40:48] contentious Sarah sure can't bring it
[1:40:51] I'm gonna change your name I'm gonna
[1:40:55] make you a Christian I'm gonna make you
[1:40:58] like me I'm gonna make you christ-like
[1:41:01] and that spirit that I gave you that's
[1:41:05] been hovering around you and that's been
[1:41:07] helping keep the foul spirits off of
[1:41:11] those sacrifices I'm now gonna enter
[1:41:13] inside of you and I'm not gonna reside
[1:41:16] with you I'm gonna reside in here and
[1:41:19] I'm gonna help you through this journey
[1:41:20] you know what the devil can beat your
[1:41:22] spirit up and the devil can beat your
[1:41:24] flesh up but the devil can never beat
[1:41:26] the soul up your soul is as protected as
[1:41:32] the almighty is protected it cannot lose
[1:41:35] it cannot diminish it has to grow it has
[1:41:40] to be so the broom said a creator if he
[1:41:49] got the Creator inside of you folks and
[1:41:52] my last point Abram had a name change
[1:41:58] and then God said finally he said now
[1:42:02] Abraham you're going to take Sarah your
[1:42:07] wife you see all the pieces are fitting
[1:42:09] together now and you're going to have
[1:42:11] about 28 days from now you're gonna
[1:42:13] something's gonna happen to you
[1:42:15] this never happened before I'm gonna
[1:42:18] change you so that you can have that
[1:42:22] promise kid I'm gonna change you and I'm
[1:42:27] not just gonna change you I'm gonna
[1:42:28] change your wife so when I so when
[1:42:31] Melchizedek left somewhere about 28 days
[1:42:35] later about the time of life you ladies
[1:42:37] know we understand
[1:42:38] Abraham woke up one day
[1:42:49] Wow
[1:42:53] my god I'm in the wrong place and then
[1:42:58] he looks at his hands I look at my hands
[1:43:03] and my hands were new I looked at my
[1:43:08] feet and they were too won't it be time
[1:43:14] huh
[1:43:19] it broke Jules here he was looking for
[1:43:22] you but I'm not gonna try but that's
[1:43:24] what it was and Abraham looked at Sarah
[1:43:28] and said you know you can think all you
[1:43:31] want dude he looked at Sarah and said
[1:43:35] honey God will never lie to you he's
[1:43:40] never lied to me in my journey he told
[1:43:43] me this is the spot that I'm gonna be
[1:43:46] standing in right when we have this
[1:43:48] promised child he said I would say it oh
[1:43:51] I'm a 90 years old and we've been having
[1:43:53] relations for C you know laundry list
[1:43:56] then finally God walks up and
[1:43:59] Melchizedek he meets God in human flesh
[1:44:01] and Melchizedek says you and Sarah are
[1:44:05] gonna have this baby you and Sarah and
[1:44:14] you know what Abram Abram said that now
[1:44:17] is Abraham you know what he said he said
[1:44:20] the same thing they said he said be it
[1:44:23] unto me according to thy word and when
[1:44:26] you receive the new birth guess that's
[1:44:28] what you have to do there's nothing you
[1:44:29] can't cry scream shout all that
[1:44:31] beforehand you can't do any of that you
[1:44:33] know they don't know how but when you
[1:44:36] just drop back and like brother Zack
[1:44:39] said I got tired of being tired and I
[1:44:43] come to a place that I can't do it
[1:44:45] God you gonna have to do it for me I'm
[1:44:48] 99 years old Abram I've now been changed
[1:44:51] to Abraham God's giving me a revelation
[1:44:53] now
[1:44:54] and he really gave me a revelation when
[1:44:56] I woke up with my new bride now I know
[1:44:59] how to get this done that's the same way
[1:45:01] you've done when you receive the new
[1:45:03] birth when you truly become born-again
[1:45:05] in this end time remember what brother
[1:45:10] Browne said brother Branham says she
[1:45:11] will know what to do with the word the
[1:45:16] bride of Jesus Christ in this end time
[1:45:18] is going to produce the promised son and
[1:45:21] she will know what to do with the word
[1:45:22] when it comes Sarah knew Abraham knew
[1:45:26] Sarah didn't look at Hagar no more and
[1:45:28] say well let's use this one and Abraham
[1:45:30] didn't make a hundred thousand excuses
[1:45:31] they come to a place to where they knew
[1:45:34] they were going to produce what this
[1:45:38] Bible had said they were going to
[1:45:40] produce that's what you and I got to
[1:45:42] come to that place to where it's not my
[1:45:45] brother not my neighbor not my sister
[1:45:47] natural but it's you and I it's late oh
[1:45:53] nice and God's waiting on us have you
[1:45:56] ever heard that sermon before God's
[1:45:58] waiting on us to white let go
[1:46:02] ain't let God do it but you've got to do
[1:46:06] what God tells you to do rose axes
[1:46:11] here's sorry that bro Zack says I'm a
[1:46:15] changed man I'm a changed man I'm a
[1:46:16] changed man I change men I'm going
[1:46:18] testify testify testify sister I'm a
[1:46:20] changed man change man I get up here
[1:46:22] three months later and I go where's that
[1:46:24] black oh he decide to stay out of church
[1:46:29] today I think he went somewhere with his
[1:46:30] friends uh oh oh oh everybody the
[1:46:37] building knows what happened setbacks
[1:46:40] don't the Devils the Devils got him
[1:46:43] stuck in sanctification and he thinks
[1:46:47] he's okay I think slip out you can't
[1:46:49] slip back out in the world folk not
[1:46:51] being born again you cannot slip out
[1:46:53] back into the world we make mistakes
[1:46:56] upon mistakes upon mistakes but you will
[1:46:59] not you will not go backwards and God
[1:47:06] [Music]
[1:47:10] because that spirit now that brought you
[1:47:15] to church and everything's fine
[1:47:17] everybody looks up is that black he's
[1:47:19] changed he's a changed guy he's a
[1:47:22] good-looking kid too
[1:47:23] he's changed guy but they keep watching
[1:47:27] you to make sure that that change
[1:47:30] because remember our change is eternal
[1:47:34] it's an eternal change it's not a change
[1:47:37] that goes up and sure we have our up and
[1:47:38] down I'm somebody in humanity but that's
[1:47:41] not gonna come up three months from now
[1:47:43] and say well I don't have to go to
[1:47:45] church the more I just go I just go back
[1:47:47] with my buddies and I have a beer - I
[1:47:51] know if the desire is gone I don't say
[1:47:56] if because of you I say if the desire is
[1:47:58] gone
[1:48:00] we don't have to worry about looking for
[1:48:02] our children anymore if we can get a
[1:48:04] born again you'll know where they are
[1:48:08] let's stand to our feet you'll know
[1:48:11] where they are why because they've
[1:48:13] received the same spirit you got birds
[1:48:16] of a feather Eagles of a feather flock
[1:48:20] together twice acts the first one on the
[1:48:23] stage look at that goat he's on the
[1:48:26] front row for the fire follow the
[1:48:38] journey of Abraham now the next part we
[1:48:41] got to come to it's really hard because
[1:48:42] you know what happened to Abraham
[1:48:43] Abraham at ninety nine years old he had
[1:48:46] to take a knife which probably wasn't
[1:48:47] very surgically sharp at that moment and
[1:48:49] he had to circumcise itself and what the
[1:48:53] circumcision do it cuts off the old
[1:48:55] excess skin it cuts off the old excess
[1:48:58] flesh and that's the type of the new
[1:49:01] birth that we you can you can't reverse
[1:49:03] the process there's no reverse process
[1:49:08] in circumcision 1n done right let's
[1:49:13] watch the type in the new birth you
[1:49:14] can't go back
[1:49:16] who wants to put flesh back on take it
[1:49:20] off but you love the Lord
[1:49:24] you gotta learn love the journey of
[1:49:27] Abraham I every time I speak on this I
[1:49:30] think of Jimmy Gibson brother Jimmy
[1:49:32] Gibson passed away good many years ago
[1:49:34] but I'm telling you I thought I think he
[1:49:37] was Abraham's brother blood brother
[1:49:38] because he preached on Abraham buddy he
[1:49:41] would take it from the Erb child deeds
[1:49:44] and he'll take him all the way into the
[1:49:46] Promised Land and I mean he did a really
[1:49:48] good job but brother Jimmy god bless him
[1:49:50] he's he's watching over the balcony
[1:49:52] maybe today and going you know why cuz
[1:49:58] you had a new birth so we know where
[1:50:00] he's at even when people pass away we
[1:50:03] know where they're at
[1:50:04] there's no wandering there's no worry we
[1:50:07] know we're there
