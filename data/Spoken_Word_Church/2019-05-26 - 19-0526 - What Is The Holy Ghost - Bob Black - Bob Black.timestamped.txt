[0:00] but there's a little bit but it's God
[0:02] that does the drawing if any said if you
[0:06] love me keep my Commandments and I will
[0:09] pray the father and he shall give you
[0:11] another comforter that he may abide with
[0:14] you forever
[0:14] even the Spirit of Truth whom the world
[0:17] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[0:19] neither knoweth them but you know him
[0:21] for he dwelleth in you with you and
[0:23] shall be in you I will not leave you
[0:25] comfortless I will come to you and so
[0:28] you can see that the new birth is a sign
[0:30] it's a seal it's an assurance it's all
[0:32] those things but it's also a comforter
[0:35] it's the comforter because it will give
[0:37] you comfort when all all the things
[0:38] around you go straight gonna write
[0:41] everything in the world seems to be
[0:42] falling apart
[0:43] your kids are stretching you out maybe
[0:45] your home life is fish through out your
[0:47] job and everything but it's a comfort to
[0:49] you because you know that God has a body
[0:51] with you that he's with you and he
[0:52] promised that he would see you yea
[0:54] though I walk through the valley of the
[0:55] shadow of death I won't be with you I
[0:57] will fear no evil because God is with
[1:00] you he's covered in you he's in the
[1:02] comfort is the comfort is that God has
[1:04] given you a revelation and that is your
[1:07] comfort there is no comfort outside of
[1:10] the word of God
[1:12] when you take your Bible and you open it
[1:14] up and you realize that you can see your
[1:16] name written in the pages of the
[1:17] scripture and then you know that God you
[1:20] were written in him before the
[1:21] foundation of the world or what greater
[1:23] comfort could there be than that but all
[1:25] the world begins to fall apart and you
[1:28] can you can look back into the scripture
[1:29] and know that you were with God before
[1:31] the foundation of the world in his mind
[1:33] they thought of you that he knew of you
[1:35] that is the greatest comfort that I
[1:37] could ever think that I could even
[1:39] imagine and he said I'll not leave you
[1:41] comfortless but I will come to you see
[1:43] he's not just sitting some other things
[1:45] but he's himself his own life coming in
[1:48] to dwell inside
[1:50] well outside of the believer I'll not
[1:52] leave you comfortless I will come to you
[1:54] who is that spirit then what is the Holy
[1:57] Ghost its Christ in you cautions 120
[2:00] selling the comforter that's the Holy
[2:02] Spirit and when the comforter has come
[2:04] he will do the same things that I've
[2:06] done while the comforter is in me I'll
[2:08] pray the Father and he'll give you this
[2:10] comforter you know the comforter the
[2:12] world won't know it never will but you
[2:14] know him because he dwells now with you
[2:17] and how do you know it how do you know
[2:20] because he has revealed himself to you
[2:22] he's made himself known he's open up the
[2:25] word to you and he's speaking to you in
[2:27] a spiritual way a way that the world
[2:30] cannot understand because he's speaking
[2:32] words of comfort and affirmation to you
[2:34] just like he spoke to Moses at the
[2:36] burning bush I am the God of Abraham
[2:39] Isaac continue and there's another thing
[2:44] the Holy Ghost is mother of children at
[2:47] first John chapter 2 he says my little
[2:48] children these things write unto you
[2:50] that you send on they'll sing but now
[2:55] mister this is where it gets beautiful
[2:57] and if any man seen if you do sin we
[3:01] have an advocate with the father Jesus
[3:03] Christ the righteous and he is the
[3:06] propitiation for our sins and not for
[3:09] ours only but also for the sins of the
[3:12] whole world so when you do make mistakes
[3:15] remember that story the brother and
[3:16] talked about how he was looking judging
[3:18] it that woman sitting in there and that
[3:20] bar with us to meet and he was sitting
[3:22] there looking at look at that and God
[3:23] took him over he said come over here I
[3:25] want to talk to you for a minute and he
[3:26] took the mother behind the door and they
[3:28] begin to show him how there was a bump
[3:30] of blood over a bun all around the earth
[3:33] and every time that brought around
[3:34] anything wrong that that that God would
[3:37] kill them except that bumper blood it
[3:39] would just bounce right off of that
[3:40] because what the holy ghost is it is a
[3:42] it is an advocate with the father an
[3:45] advocate is like an eternity that speaks
[3:47] upon your behalf and if the attorney is
[3:49] the same one to sit behind the judgment
[3:51] seat that you can't lose
[4:03] let it down make anybody much you can't
[4:07] lose I see we get all tossed about
[4:10] because we make mistakes and we do
[4:12] things wrong
[4:17] goodness gracious y'all may win then one
[4:22] we'll finish up here in a minute
[4:27] so he says you sittin up don't see him
[4:29] but if you do skin you got somebody
[4:32] somebody down the inside you got that
[4:35] blood covering to represent you because
[4:40] that Jesus Christ is on the inside
[4:42] representing you back to the Father
[4:44] saying he didn't mean to do it he got
[4:46] deceived into that he got pulled off
[4:48] into that and God is there to be an
[4:50] advocate to you to be a propitiation for
[4:52] your sins and the profession is that he
[4:56] doubted he already died on the cross he
[4:58] died on the cross for that you'll have
[5:00] to he died on the cross so that you
[5:02] don't have to go to hell he is the
[5:04] propitiation he's the one that already
[5:06] paid the price for you he already paid
[5:10] everything for you and when you do
[5:13] anything wrong God is looking at that
[5:15] he's looking at that judgment already
[5:17] paid like that grass serpent and stand
[5:20] up in instead of what you've done
[5:21] he's not looking at you like brother
[5:23] have said all that he hears as your
[5:25] voice cried out to the Father for
[5:26] forgiveness he doesn't even cease for
[5:29] the blood all he does he just hears your
[5:31] voice coming out to it what does the
[5:35] only goes to sin advocate what is an
[5:38] applicator what does it do it makes that
[5:40] advocate it hasn't mercy it stands in
[5:43] your place
[5:43] it does things that you can't do because
[5:46] you you can't advocate yourself you
[5:48] can't represent yourself but he can
[5:50] represent you he can be your lawyer your
[5:54] attorney
[5:54] it's a propitiation for your sins it's
[5:57] your righteousness
[5:58] it's your healing it's your life it's
[6:00] your resurrection that's all that God
[6:02] has for you he's an advocate how we
[6:04] could go into details with that and
[6:06] bring that back around
[6:07] it makes intercession for our ignorance
[6:10] sometimes we got the Holy Ghost we can
[6:13] you atleast anger into something the
[6:15] Holy Spirit is there to make advocate
[6:17] for us he is
[6:18] applicator he stands he's our attorney
[6:20] he stands there and pleas for us we
[6:23] don't plead for ourselves because the
[6:25] Holy Ghost in us pleads for us the Holy
[6:28] Ghost giving an utterance sometimes the
[6:29] words you can't understand and he makes
[6:32] intercession for us that's what the Holy
[6:35] Ghost is that's what listen sometimes
[6:38] you get down and you begin to pray you
[6:39] better get to call out to God and you
[6:42] come to a place where something within
[6:43] you because to do the speaking on your
[6:45] behalf
[6:46] my Paul says making other others and
[6:48] groanings that you don't even realize
[6:50] what's being saying like that time the
[6:52] program said he will be begin to pray
[6:54] and he heard somebody speaking and he
[6:55] thought it was a German out in the hall
[6:57] when somebody speaking in another
[6:58] language but it turned out that it was
[7:00] his own voice calling out for that
[7:02] little sister that was in trouble there
[7:04] was the Holy Ghost in him crying out
[7:06] somebody the Holy Ghost funnier than you
[7:09] pity us to cry out listen when the Holy
[7:12] Ghost begins to call out for your family
[7:14] and it's not you something will begin to
[7:17] happen it's the Holy Ghost it's an
[7:19] advocate for you it's the Holy Ghost is
[7:21] that advocator for your church for your
[7:23] family and that's what the Holy Ghost is
[7:25] the most important thing and they're
[7:27] willing for the Holy Ghost then we just
[7:30] become the church out of a family out of
[7:32] just just come to church just to be here
[7:34] we need the Holy Ghost and I may
[7:37] interrupt there
[7:45] [Music]
[8:04] [Music]
[8:28] could be a hassle lower this morning so
[8:32] this morning I thought I would just kind
[8:36] of go through I went through the I was
[8:56] going through all the sermons that Bill
[8:58] Graham preached on what is the Holy
[8:59] Ghost and why was it given for
[9:00] everything with my kids we just kind of
[9:02] get together in the evenings and whatnot
[9:04] and they they really enjoyed it
[9:06] themselves I just kind of wondered do it
[9:09] little exercise a little background
[9:20] [Music]
[9:31] y'all just remember brother Wade in them
[9:33] and all the special needs everything
[9:37] we're going to explore especially that
[9:40] he yes I'm gonna feel good about you

[10:00] you can regulatory to the hospital and
[10:03] whose prayer yet and they did a heart
[10:05] cath Saturday afternoon and put a steel
[10:08] [Music]
[10:20] in fact let's just go to the Lord in
[10:23] prayer this morning Lord Jesus were so
[10:25] grateful together to be able to gather
[10:27] together around your word would you just
[10:29] once again and we pray O God that you'll
[10:31] give special grace to brother Louisa
[10:33] someone that sees pre-printed labels
[10:34] word the Lord
[10:35] y'all grin and I played on the children
[10:37] give them power or Jesus to speak
[10:38] whatever you lay upon his heart or not
[10:41] to hold back this morning when he's away
[10:43] it out there Morris Lord we ask Lord
[10:45] Jesus that you just be with all of the
[10:47] day before the river brother Claude I'm
[10:48] gonna wait and all the situation up
[10:50] there knowing where they are or what all
[10:52] the different needs of the people with
[10:53] Jesus and bigger that's one job because
[10:55] we know that you're you made us a needy
[10:58] people or that we hunger and cry for you
[11:00] the Lord Jesus and we need so many
[11:01] things from You Lord and you're here and
[11:03] able to deliver us and give us
[11:05] everything that we have need up Lord
[11:07] granted Lord as we look into your word
[11:09] Lord Jesus that you open it up to us to
[11:10] love God and cause us to see more about
[11:12] who we are who you are in the place in
[11:14] the hour that you've made for us to
[11:16] manifest your word today Lord grant
[11:18] authority just that you'll be with
[11:19] office alternator the services we ask in
[11:22] your name amen all right now what is the
[11:26] Holy Ghost
[11:28] court you know up as you kind of look
[11:31] into some things that brother Brennan
[11:32] said about what the Holy Ghost is you
[11:34] realized it that if it was not for the
[11:36] Holy Ghost then we would just be coming
[11:39] together to just kind of gather around
[11:40] like I could have done in Atlanta I
[11:42] worked they've got that big Christian
[11:45] science building this big monolith and I
[11:47] was walking over there and there that
[11:48] kind of get something to eat the other
[11:49] day and I saw they had the big sign that
[11:51] gets in Christian Science reading room
[11:53] and you see if it wasn't for the Holy
[11:56] Ghost we would just kind of be going
[11:57] together together
[11:58] have like a reading room and this is
[12:00] going to help us to read some quotes and
[12:02] just to kind of be I have an
[12:03] understanding just from from our
[12:05] intellectual standpoint what may be a
[12:07] good way to live and everything is but
[12:10] the gospel is about it's about more than
[12:12] just kind of a good moral system you
[12:15] just find kind of following people and
[12:17] just kind of come to church and gather
[12:18] together and being nice good citizens
[12:20] it's more than that and what makes it
[12:22] different what what makes it what it is
[12:25] is it is the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[12:27] Ghost is the life of God actually moving
[12:30] in the church movement in his people
[12:32] it's the life of God himself and you
[12:34] think about what kind of grace it is for
[12:36] the god of glory the god of creation
[12:39] that created everything that we can see
[12:41] everything that it is that spoke the
[12:43] world into existence to be able to come
[12:46] down and abide in our flesh to be able
[12:49] to live in in us and allow us to take
[12:51] part in in preaching the gospel and
[12:54] witnessing to others and in the whole
[12:56] plan of redemption and so the Holy Ghost
[13:00] is the is the most important thing that
[13:03] there is it's more important than then
[13:05] choosing a spouse is more important than
[13:07] choosing a job it's more important than
[13:09] your job is more important than all the
[13:11] earthly pleasures all that all the
[13:13] things that makes this tactic is the
[13:14] most critical most important thing that
[13:16] there is and so I believe that we should
[13:20] if there's any doubt in your mind any
[13:22] doubt at all that whether you have the
[13:25] Holy Ghost or not you should lay aside
[13:26] and everything else and dig into the
[13:29] word dig into a little bit just lay
[13:30] aside everything else until you're sure
[13:32] that you have those because like I
[13:34] believe that you can know whether you
[13:37] have the Holy Ghost
[13:38] you can you know about I've heard just
[13:40] growing up you know different ministers
[13:42] and whatnot they get up and talk about
[13:44] how that the devil comes and battles
[13:45] them about whether they've got the
[13:47] and you know I believe that's true the
[13:50] devil can come and battle you and put
[13:51] off the thoughts and things in your mind
[13:53] but if the rebel if the baptism and Holy
[13:56] Ghost is a personal revelation of Jesus
[13:58] Christ personally to you then God can
[14:00] reveal to you he will reveal to you
[14:02] whether or not you have it or not and
[14:04] you can make it so real to you that it's
[14:06] that something that is like a rock that
[14:09] your whole life is ground little that
[14:10] you know that you know that you know
[14:12] that you are sealed away that it's the
[14:14] sign that you as a sign that others
[14:16] you've been sealed away even a signed
[14:19] sealed and delivered
[14:21] and there's nothing in the whole world
[14:22] can take that away from you when God
[14:24] gives you a revelation he can take
[14:26] somebody might be able to take away an
[14:28] emotion from your I might take away some
[14:30] some kind of little feeling or maybe
[14:32] that maybe you you've seen the pillar of
[14:33] fire so that somebody can make a reason
[14:35] that I weigh from you but if God gives
[14:37] you a personal revelation of who he is
[14:39] and nobody can give the gates of pain
[14:40] okay prevail against that and so let's
[14:44] let's uh I don't way set up I don't want
[14:48] to get the priest
[15:00] you'll see that okay and he says now I
[15:04] want to talk on it as the holy spirit
[15:05] being a sign so it's a real realm in the
[15:07] in the message what is that what is the
[15:09] only ever see he goes through all the
[15:11] different things that the Holy Ghost is
[15:12] and he does things about by one by one
[15:15] and the next message he talks about why
[15:17] was it given for so let's just take some
[15:19] of these things that will end and talk
[15:21] about it as the Holy Spirit being a sign
[15:23] for it is a sign we realize that all
[15:26] promises is given to us by Abraham was
[15:29] the father of the promise because God
[15:31] gave the promise to Abraham and to his
[15:33] seed after him the promise was made to
[15:35] Abraham into his seat and this son is to
[15:38] Epona people now there is a vast
[15:41] difference between just a Christian and
[15:44] a Holy Ghost filled Christian and now
[15:47] we're going to get this from the
[15:48] scripture and placing just exactly in
[15:49] the scripture the first place there is a
[15:52] Christian profess to be a Christian but
[15:54] if this Christian has not yet been
[15:56] filled with all the notes he's only in
[15:58] process of being a Christian see Peters
[16:01] profess to believe it he's working to it
[16:04] but God has not yet given him the spirit
[16:07] of the Holy Ghost he's not yet reached
[16:09] that goal with God that God has
[16:12] recognized me and now you see that's
[16:14] what brother brother they all have been
[16:16] talking about that that there's a
[16:17] process that you work through by by
[16:20] through faith by grace through faith are
[16:23] you safe because the Holy Ghost what it
[16:25] is is the Holy Ghost is drawing you
[16:27] through this process and there is an
[16:29] actual point where you get the baptism
[16:31] the Holy Ghost as you go through this
[16:34] process and the process begins with
[16:36] justification sanctification the baptism
[16:39] only goes and then it doesn't it doesn't
[16:41] end at that it just keeps growing and
[16:44] growing because the baptism and Holy
[16:46] Ghost as the river laid the revelation
[16:48] just keeps unfolding and as it keeps
[16:50] unfolding if it keeps ceiling in the it
[16:53] sails in virtue that seals in knowledge
[16:55] and temperance until until you come up
[16:57] all the way getting a little bit deeper
[17:00] maybe the identity but you come up all
[17:03] the way to receiving the message for
[17:05] your day which brings you back to them
[17:08] till that
[17:09] touken the baptized baptism in the holy
[17:12] ghost according to Malachi 4:5 6 which
[17:15] is a capstone baptism taking you all the
[17:17] way back until to God has completely
[17:19] taken over your being which will see
[17:21] brother branham gets into this he gets
[17:24] into this and walk back toward the end
[17:25] of the message he starts talking about
[17:27] how the the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[17:28] was given to completely take over the
[17:31] beings so that God can have complete
[17:33] preeminence in you but it's a process
[17:36] that you have to go through and he said
[17:39] the circumcision is a type of the Holy
[17:41] Ghost and God gave Abraham the
[17:43] circumcision signed after he accepted
[17:45] God on his promise and walked out into a
[17:48] strange country see it was a sudden and
[17:50] all his children and his seed after him
[17:52] should have this sign in this ended in
[17:55] the flesh because it was a distinction
[17:57] it was to separate them from all other
[18:00] peoples this sign of circumcision and
[18:02] that's what God uses today is the sign
[18:05] of circumcision of the heart the holy
[18:07] spirit that makes God's church a
[18:09] separated church from all other Creed's
[18:12] faiths and denominations now this is
[18:15] where it gets real clear that sickness
[18:17] in the Old Testament the sign was in
[18:20] your flesh and the man's flesh and in
[18:23] the New Testament the sign is in the
[18:25] man's heart and it's in the heart but it
[18:27] works its way our so you can see yes a
[18:30] sign to you but to others it's also a
[18:32] sign because people can look at you and
[18:34] you are assigned to them Europe like the
[18:36] Bible says that be salty
[18:38] don't be salty to one another when
[18:41] somebody sees you it makes seize your
[18:43] life that sign and manifests you're so
[18:46] salty that makes them thirsty to have
[18:48] the same thing that you do and becomes a
[18:51] sign to others that they know that there
[18:53] is a Living God because of the patience
[18:55] that you have of the temperance that you
[18:57] have of the virtue that when they talk
[18:59] to you strength flows out from you and
[19:01] there
[19:01] to receive strength and help and you
[19:04] don't just talk negative to improvise
[19:06] everything that you you speak of faith
[19:08] and you're able to to help people along
[19:10] their Christian journey and it becomes a
[19:13] sign and that's what brother said you
[19:14] let me talk to a man two minutes I can
[19:17] tell you whether you've received the
[19:19] Holy Ghost or not
[19:20] so can you my goodness what a statement
[19:23] and what way brother Branham can you
[19:25] tell that somebody has received the Holy
[19:27] Ghost how can you tell that now he
[19:30] didn't see doesn't spell this out so if
[19:32] you want if you want to give me some
[19:33] grace I'm just going to tell my
[19:35] revelation but the rent is the Holy
[19:37] Ghost if the baptism the Holy Ghost is a
[19:39] personal revelation to you then that
[19:41] revelation will work its way out and so
[19:44] you the way that you tell if somebody
[19:46] has the only ghost or not is give it the
[19:48] word test like brother I'm saying you
[19:49] lay the word of the measuring stick like
[19:52] through bubbles measuring line up to it
[19:54] and if the revelation that they have
[19:56] does not compare with a revelation of
[19:58] Scripture if they say well God is not
[20:00] God it's not still the same yesterday
[20:01] today and forever god still cannot hear
[20:04] all that line all the words and then you
[20:06] know something's wrong but you talk to
[20:08] somebody and out from there out from
[20:11] there barely out from them comes a
[20:12] wellspring of everlasting life and the
[20:15] faith that they have bears record with
[20:17] the same with the word that's written on
[20:19] the page and it matches up perfectly
[20:21] then you know that something has taken
[20:23] place in that believers life I can take
[20:26] you whether he's received all of us or
[20:27] not something you get separates them
[20:29] it's a mark
[20:30] it's the Son and the Holy Spirit is
[20:32] assignment that I'll stress on this to
[20:36] my kids
[20:36] and you can see if you told me somebody
[20:40] and they said well I know that I have
[20:42] the Holy Ghost because one day I got in
[20:44] the spirit and I felt a great big
[20:46] sensation which lets me be real honest
[20:49] we were watching videos of these little
[20:51] children testifying actually
[20:52] to a certain camp then I'm not gonna
[20:54] name just about every one of them they
[20:56] got up and they said well I know that
[20:58] something happened to me people thought
[21:00] I felt it I know that something happened
[21:01] to me because I felt a sensation I know
[21:04] I was in the I was in the atmosphere I
[21:05] was in I was in the atmosphere of just a
[21:08] lot of jumping around a lot of things
[21:09] you know Paul said bodily exercise
[21:12] profiteth a little and brother Brennan
[21:14] said the meaning of that bodily exercise
[21:16] profiteth little was was that just
[21:18] public exalted hopping around everything
[21:20] doesn't necessarily profit that much
[21:22] it's good and everything but what will
[21:24] profit you is to have a revelation of
[21:26] Jesus Christ personally to you and
[21:29] that's how you know that you have been
[21:30] born again because God has revealed it
[21:33] to you and see that a revelation is
[21:35] different it's different than just an
[21:36] intellectual understanding that's
[21:38] different than the intellectual
[21:39] understanding that st. Augustine had
[21:41] where he studied the scriptures until he
[21:43] thought all the sudden what if they
[21:44] won't believe without this force them to
[21:45] believe it and begin to kill known as
[21:47] intellectual understanding that's
[21:49] different than people that just got to
[21:50] go to our seminary everything and they
[21:51] get an idea that that you need to be
[21:53] baptized in the name of the Father Son
[21:55] and Holy Ghost those those three that
[21:57] they don't have a revelation of what
[21:59] that is and that's so they just kind of
[22:01] skip stay stuck on that that then
[22:04] there's three there's three different
[22:05] gods but a revelation is God himself
[22:10] real feeling him to you and and that is
[22:12] what you can place everything up so I
[22:16] feel like we need to just keep hammering
[22:18] it because it's it's almost it's almost
[22:21] something that you can explain to people
[22:23] but then when you when God really
[22:25] reveals himself to you then you almost
[22:27] have an aha moment you look back and say
[22:29] oh that's what those ministers were
[22:32] talking about that's what they've been
[22:34] preached for all these years and maybe
[22:36] you know maybe this morning you might
[22:38] look back to your own life and realize
[22:40] with the data that God made him to call
[22:42] you began to deal with you he was he's
[22:44] revealing himself through justification
[22:46] he's revealing
[22:47] dealing we used to through
[22:49] sanctification because you can sanctify
[22:51] yourself is that God moving upon his
[22:54] word moving the point administering it
[22:56] ministering his word to you to produce a
[22:59] sanctified life in you and then he comes
[23:01] and puts his own soul inside of you and
[23:04] it becomes a revelation because the
[23:05] revealer is now inside of you and he's
[23:08] teaching your worries he's teaching you
[23:10] the word he's bringing he's bringing the
[23:13] word that he's that you've read that
[23:14] you've heard to your remembrance and
[23:16] he's tying it all together so you can
[23:18] have a perfect understanding of it and
[23:21] then it will produce works in your life
[23:23] it will produce the actual life of
[23:25] Christ in you and that's what he said
[23:29] here at in paragraph 47 when you are
[23:32] circumcised of the Holy Ghost it does
[23:34] the same thing to you it makes you do
[23:37] things that you didn't think you would
[23:39] do it makes you take God's promise and
[23:42] believe you God and so there's there's
[23:45] the evidence it makes you believe God
[23:49] when you got the baptism at all because
[23:51] you cannot help but believe God because
[23:53] the believer is inside of you that's
[23:55] Galatians 2:20 the life that I now live
[23:57] I live by the faith of the Son of God
[24:00] because he is inside of you doing the
[24:02] believing he is inside of you is his
[24:05] faith doing the work and I think that's
[24:07] another thing that so many of us stumble
[24:09] everybody think well well I've got to
[24:12] let go of this problem that I have I've
[24:14] got to let go of all these things I
[24:17] don't like to you know really struggle
[24:19] and everything but it's not you doing it
[24:22] it's Christ doing it inside of you it's
[24:24] Christ living on the inside of you it's
[24:27] him doing it and all you do is you just
[24:29] let go you're just open the door that
[24:31] allowed him to come in and and the only
[24:33] way that you can open the door is not by
[24:35] your own ideas but taking God at His
[24:37] Word and believing it and so that's why
[24:39] it's so important to get into the
[24:41] we'll get into the message and find out
[24:42] what do you really say find out what the
[24:44] holy ghost really is get to church have
[24:46] some money preach the true baptism but
[24:48] all that goes through the pulpit because
[24:50] if it's not if it's not taught correctly
[24:52] how can you get born again if you don't
[24:55] know what it is then how can you how can
[24:57] you be mourning even if you think it's
[24:58] just the motion of things then then
[25:01] that's what you'll be seeking if you
[25:04] think it's just look at it at lights or
[25:07] whatever or just just maybe even looking
[25:08] at a man I know that I'm born again
[25:11] somebody might say because my pastor is
[25:13] boring in all I know that I'm born again
[25:15] because my husband is born again that's
[25:17] not the way that the gospel works you
[25:19] must be born again for yourself you must
[25:22] receive the bathroom and all good for
[25:23] yourself and so I want to clarify too
[25:26] that when I say the baptism the Holy
[25:27] Ghost as for the parlor is a lesson I'm
[25:29] talking about the new birth because you
[25:31] can the program said you're gonna have
[25:32] the Baptist nobody was there every day
[25:33] of your life and die and go to hell and
[25:36] that confuses people also what do you
[25:37] mean that you can have advantages only
[25:39] those own you own you I think own your
[25:41] spirit you can have an anointing and
[25:43] that's that's what you see so many times
[25:46] that you know you can have an anointing
[25:47] on your spirit and a preacher can and
[25:50] and down from their soul they're not
[25:51] converted the revealer is not down on
[25:54] the inside of their soul and so when
[25:55] they get up behind the pulpit their
[25:56] preacher they're saying things a little
[25:58] bit off they're saying things taking you
[26:00] to another God taking you to something
[26:02] that that's not quite right because they
[26:06] have an annoyance the G when anointing
[26:08] of the baptism only goes its own their
[26:10] spirit and owning their life like Judas
[26:12] to cast out Devils to preach and to do
[26:15] all those things but down on the inside
[26:16] something has not been converted and you
[26:19] know you can tell when you get the
[26:22] new birth down on the inside of your
[26:24] soul there's a difference between the
[26:26] anointing on your spirit and that gene
[26:29] that's the germs see coming to life in
[26:32] your soul there's a difference
[26:38] now notice but in this EE ghost is a
[26:41] sign and I mean and the Holy Ghost is
[26:42] the seal so he talks about it's a sign
[26:44] and it's also a seal it's a sign that
[26:47] God gave to his chosen children to
[26:49] reject it is to be cut from the people
[26:51] and to receive it is to be finished with
[26:54] the world and all the things of the
[26:55] world and to be a product that God has
[26:58] put a seal of approval on so the seal
[27:01] means the seal means that he has
[27:04] accepted your faith you believe you
[27:07] believe you say see it's not it's not
[27:08] the moment that you believe but have you
[27:10] ever seen a little cinch to believe
[27:12] because you believe you keep believing
[27:14] and then he comes and says yes that is
[27:16] genuine faith and gene one faith is
[27:18] based upon the Word of God not just to
[27:21] pull man's ideas but when you come to a
[27:23] place where you genuinely believe in God
[27:25] comes and inspects it and looks you over
[27:27] and says yeah now the redemption the
[27:30] part of this little Redemption process
[27:33] like for your soul is complete and he
[27:35] comes and baptize you with the Holy
[27:37] Ghost become the seals you all seals off
[27:40] and so that's why as you keep growing up
[27:43] he's sealing you off he's expecting you
[27:46] to see why are you shaking a little bit
[27:48] loosen your paint chips and he comes in
[27:49] seals at all he said yeah this person is
[27:52] patience his patient he keeps stealing
[27:54] you off you've got godliness aspects
[27:56] your gives you a little bit of trials
[27:58] everything else really hi brother
[27:59] Branham said then he left
[28:00] Jesus Jesus just live for 30 years and
[28:03] then then all of a sudden it came time
[28:05] for 3 years of really hard trials and at
[28:08] the end of that really hard three years
[28:10] of trials of preaching that everything
[28:12] all just just constantly being hammered
[28:14] by the devil constantly people
[28:16] challenged him and all those things then
[28:18] then he could seal off this whole life
[28:20] on my Transfiguration to see that's the
[28:23] same thing that he does with you he's
[28:25] he's inspecting you constantly he's
[28:27] expecting you to see if you have these
[28:29] virtues in and to see if that real faith
[28:32] is made manifest in your life to see
[28:34] what what's there and he steals it and
[28:36] and it's sealed until the day of your
[28:37] redemption until the day that the whole
[28:40] process is completed that's what's the
[28:46] matter we don't get sealed so much so
[28:48] we're too loose about things when the
[28:50] inspector goes through to inspect your
[28:52] life to see if you're not just too loose
[28:54] about things little loose about your
[28:55] prayer life little loose about that
[28:58] temper little loose about that tongue to
[29:01] talk about others you'll never steal the
[29:04] caller he's talking about that box car
[29:05] that has to be inspected to make sure
[29:08] everything is tight and fastened down
[29:09] and then he puts the seal that cannot be
[29:12] broken until he reaches its destination
[29:13] look on that box car some dirty habits
[29:16] some vile things some vulgarity mind he
[29:19] can't seal the car but when he's found
[29:21] everything in this place
[29:23] the inspector then he seals it dary
[29:26] anybody opened that seal until that car
[29:28] has reached its destination to where
[29:30] it's sealed form there it is touch not
[29:32] my Nona do my prophets no harm for not
[29:35] saying you to be better for you and in
[29:37] keeping it goes on but see a seal is the
[29:39] Holy Ghost is a sign to you and to the
[29:42] world that you have been redeemed and
[29:44] it's a seal that everything that has
[29:47] been required you have met all of God's
[29:49] requirements and the requirement is that
[29:51] you believe God's work and when you
[29:53] believe God's Word he comes and seals it
[29:55] and that's why this token this token of
[29:57] the true baptism the Holy Ghost could
[29:59] not come until this day that requires
[30:01] full obedience to the word full
[30:03] obedience to the word how could that
[30:05] come until this day when we have all of
[30:07] the word when you have all the word that
[30:09] God could come and seal up your life
[30:11] because you have made ever you come to
[30:12] full of medians to all of the wording
[30:15] God seals your complete life amen
[30:20] this may contain if I kidding
[30:24] and and this is this is really good
[30:27] that's what that's what the Holy Spirit
[30:28] is it's your assurance
[30:30] it's your protection this your witness
[30:34] it's your seal it's your son they didn't
[30:37] that wonderful to have an assurance to
[30:40] have an assurance that God has paid the
[30:42] price for you you've accepted and he's
[30:44] given you the baptism the Holy Ghost as
[30:45] a son that he's accepted as a son that
[30:48] he's accepted you that he's is your
[30:51] assurance that that price has been paid
[30:53] as your token that you can wave at the
[30:56] game to say I got a pass I got a free
[30:58] pass that I can go through because the
[31:00] price has already been painted I know it
[31:02] you see why it's a revelation because
[31:04] when it's revealed to you it's revealed
[31:06] to you that you have an assurance
[31:09] it's your protection is your protection
[31:11] against the devil and all the things
[31:13] that the devil can throw against you and
[31:15] it's your ways it's your seal then I'm
[31:19] heaven bound don't care what the devil
[31:21] sense I'm heaven bound why he civilly
[31:23] gave it to me sealed me and it's Kingdom
[31:25] and I'm glory bound
[31:26] let the winds blow let Satan do what he
[31:29] wants to God has done sealed me till the
[31:32] day of my Redemption I said I like
[31:36] preaching only goes that you can know
[31:37] that you gotta die that always bothered
[31:41] me when I was growing up if your people
[31:42] say well you know sometimes a devil met
[31:44] the devil one mess for you the devil
[31:47] will mess with you he'll mess with you
[31:48] read about your healing and everything
[31:50] he'll try to try to get you to
[31:51] disbelieve that's the devil's job is to
[31:53] poke at you and prod and try to get you
[31:55] to doubt God's Word but if you've got
[31:57] the Holy Ghost if you get the revelation
[31:58] of Jesus Christ inside of you then that
[32:01] is a that is the thing that God has
[32:03] given you to withstand every fiery darts
[32:06] of the wicked one that is the thing that
[32:08] God has given you a rock down on the
[32:10] inside that the gates of Hell cannot
[32:12] prevail against and so I believe that
[32:14] when you get to the baptismal oligos god
[32:16] Kendrick will
[32:18] you that you got it and now the Spirit
[32:22] of God the Holy Ghost what is the Holy
[32:24] Ghost it is the Spirit of Christ in you
[32:26] now before we read I just like to say if
[32:29] you come any word to what is the Holy
[32:31] Ghost is a seal it's a covenant it's a
[32:33] sign it's the spirit of Jesus Christ
[32:36] team you see a little while since Eva
[32:39] said the world sees me no more yet ye
[32:41] shall see me for I will be with you even
[32:44] in you to the end of the world ye shall
[32:46] see me because why when you come like in
[32:49] the Old Testament it says every every
[32:51] every donkey or whatever that come came
[32:53] forth through the matrix must be
[32:55] redeemed by Lamb when you come forth
[32:57] through that spiritual matrix your eyes
[32:59] become open to a new world and you begin
[33:02] to behold like a child coming forth for
[33:04] the first time you begin to look at the
[33:06] father you see the father you begin to
[33:08] realize that you did not come from your
[33:10] earthly mother and father but you came
[33:13] from above you were falling from above
[33:16] and that's why I says you the world does
[33:19] not see him anymore but when you're born
[33:21] again your eyes become open but listen
[33:24] that's what a lot of times when you
[33:25] begin to talk to somebody that is not
[33:27] born again the discussion almost becomes
[33:30] an argument and you have to watch
[33:31] yourselves because they cannot see what
[33:33] you can see they can't see they're not
[33:36] beholding the father's face with
[33:38] spiritual eyes but come listen when you
[33:40] get the new birth you have an act like
[33:42] the eye of your soul that is looking to
[33:44] a realm beyond the things that you can
[33:47] see with your next rise you're looking
[33:49] to the unseen you're looking with eyes
[33:51] for faith to see things that you cannot
[33:53] see with the natural eye and that's what
[33:56] the new birth it is when we say it's a
[33:58] revelation it's almost more than that
[34:00] word to even explain more than you can
[34:03] even comprehend just from that ball in
[34:05] an oven at Dover
[34:06] elation because of the revelation it
[34:08] means that when you are born again you
[34:09] can see like the holiday when Elijah
[34:12] said god I pray that you will open up
[34:14] his eyes and he looked around and all
[34:16] the angels all the angels were gathered
[34:18] around it's an S it's like you begin
[34:23] that's what brother Ed said when the
[34:24] seals begin to open up when the word
[34:27] begins telling went up to you you can
[34:29] look into the Bible with new eyes and
[34:31] see things that you never saw before
[34:33] because it's God revealing it to you and
[34:36] this is so different than an
[34:38] intellectual revelation is not an
[34:40] intellectual understanding do you have
[34:42] to see you have to understand you have
[34:44] to you have to receive it in your brain
[34:45] you have to read it for yourself but
[34:48] when God reveals it to you and elevates
[34:50] it beyond just something that you
[34:52] understand with your carnal mind it
[34:54] becomes a spiritual knowledge to you
[34:56] that nobody can take away then jesus
[35:01] said to them again in John chapter 20
[35:03] peace be unto you as my father has sent
[35:06] me even so send I you attended programs
[35:10] that explains they said the Jesus that
[35:12] sins you goes with you and is in you and
[35:14] if that spirit living in Jesus Christ
[35:17] make him do and act the way he did you
[35:20] will have some general idea of how
[35:22] that'll do when it's in you because that
[35:24] life cannot change it will go from body
[35:27] to body but it cannot change his nature
[35:30] for it is God does he see God since God
[35:33] seems you and I the same way that he
[35:36] sent himself he didn't couldn't he
[35:38] didn't send somebody else to go down on
[35:39] the cross he came himself he put his old
[35:42] wife the life of Jesus Christ and walked
[35:45] to that cross himself that was God
[35:47] Almighty in that man that died on the
[35:49] cross and the same way that he sends you
[35:51] a night to preach the gospel to minister
[35:54] others to be helping others as he puts
[35:56] his life inside of you and he goes
[35:58] himself and that's how
[36:00] since that's how he sins and when he
[36:08] goes and lives inside of a believer
[36:09] it'll make the believer act the same way
[36:12] that it did when he was in Jesus Christ
[36:15] that's how you know what the Holy Ghost
[36:17] is John chapter 14 it says verily verily
[36:22] I say unto you he that believeth on me
[36:24] the works that I do shall he do also and
[36:26] greater works than these shall you do
[36:28] because I go into my father either
[36:30] believeth on me and brother Tom kept
[36:32] explaining that he didn't believe that
[36:34] continues in that process I bleed from
[36:37] justification sanctification the new
[36:39] birth coming in and make you late in
[36:41] Christ and continue don't believeth
[36:44] believeth on me and if somebody you know
[36:47] falls away you it's proof that they
[36:50] never even started their journey
[36:51] correctly because once you start that
[36:53] journey correctly God it's God moving
[36:55] you and calling you and drawing you up
[36:57] and if it's God doing it he will see you
[37:00] to the end but whatsoever ye shall ask
[37:02] in my name that while I do that the
[37:04] father may be glorified in the son if he
[37:07] shall ask ask anything in my name I will
[37:10] do it let's talk about that for a little
[37:12] in my name when you had been a name of
[37:16] represents the characteristics of that
[37:18] thing like Adam and Eve in the garden
[37:21] adamant and in the garden he began to
[37:22] put a name to things he put a name to a
[37:25] parent because it marked something else
[37:27] they would just repeat other words he
[37:28] put a name to a sheep but it's a sheep
[37:31] because it at all warm and it had the
[37:32] nature of established of a lamb but when
[37:35] God puts God came and
[37:37] his name on him said the name of Jesus
[37:40] Christ represents that the nature and
[37:42] the characteristics of God himself were
[37:44] in that person and so when you become a
[37:47] Christian when you take on the name of
[37:48] Jesus Christ that means the life of that
[37:51] person the characteristics that make up
[37:53] that person is now living inside of you
[37:56] and so if you ask anything in my name in
[37:59] the name because you have baptized into
[38:01] him you're part of his life the
[38:03] characteristics of that person are now
[38:05] in manifesting themselves in you and us
[38:08] in his name of opponent revelation of
[38:11] who that person is I will do it cuz
[38:14] you're not asking based upon your own
[38:15] desires you're not asking based upon
[38:17] some kind of mental understanding or
[38:19] anything like that but you're asking
[38:21] based upon God's Word that you know that
[38:23] he promised it that and then you can ask
[38:25] for your kids because you know that the
[38:27] promises that as many as are far off you
[38:30] can ask it believe me you can ask
[38:32] believing and calling out to God that he
[38:34] will come and draw your children just
[38:37] like he drew you
