[28:05] Saturday
[28:07] and uh wrote a few things down I didn't
[28:09] have a thing to speak at brother claud's
[28:12] and this little thought came to my heart
[28:15] so we'll uh see how the Lord leads
[28:19] here um Ever every sermon is the same
[28:23] but every sermon is different and you
[28:25] preach the same sermon in five different
[28:27] places and go at it five different
[28:30] ways you know you can get to New York by
[28:35] by I 95 or 81 or 82 or so you can get
[28:41] you can get to a lot of different things
[28:42] a lot of different ways tonight we're
[28:44] going to look at the
[28:46] thought
[28:48] predestination the mystery Satan can't
[28:52] stand
[28:55] right let's bow our heads before we
[28:57] start
[28:59] dear heavenly father we pray Lord that
[29:01] you would come Among Us in a special way
[29:04] not be Lord just a bystander but be an
[29:06] active participant in the service father
[29:08] that you would take total preeminence
[29:10] and that you would be the one that does
[29:12] the speaking father not be a man Lord
[29:15] but be you Lord taking this word that is
[29:17] truly before the foundation of the world
[29:19] that's that's tried and tested and true
[29:24] and bring it to the hearts of the people
[29:26] father we ask you that you just bless us
[29:28] now as the pilgrims long time ago sat
[29:31] down tomorrow Lord with with the Indians
[29:34] and and bless the food of the the
[29:37] Bountiful Harvest that they had and
[29:39] thank you Lord for a new country that
[29:42] they had moved to well father we're
[29:44] moving to another country not this
[29:47] United States of America father but
[29:49] we're moving to a country a kingdom that
[29:52] you've set up without hammering nails
[29:54] that you promised Lord that you would
[29:56] come back and get us that you would
[29:57] build this place father we believe that
[30:00] you're building it now in the heart of
[30:02] the believer not up in heaven somewhere
[30:05] fixing something up but you're fixing up
[30:07] the hearts and minds of the Believers so
[30:10] that we can be the part of that City
[30:13] father we pray that You' just touch each
[30:14] one if there's any sick here Lord you
[30:16] said you sent your word and healed them
[30:18] and delivered them from destruction so
[30:20] Lord as the word Goes Forth May the eyes
[30:23] of the Holy Spirit just smooth things
[30:25] over may they people be blessed Lord by
[30:28] just being here father may we be blessed
[30:30] just by reading your word be with the
[30:32] ones that are not here that are
[30:34] traveling the ones that are homesick

[30:39] father just be with us and bless us and
[30:40] keep us forgive us of our many sins and
[30:42] our mistakes we ask these things in
[30:44] Jesus name amen the book of Jeremiah 1
[30:49] verse 5 before I formed thee in the
[30:52] belly I knew
[30:54] thee and before thou camest forth out of
[30:58] the womb I Sanctified thee right
[31:03] wow and I ordained thee a prophet unto
[31:07] the Nations right then said I oh Lord
[31:11] God behold I cannot speak for I'm a
[31:14] child but the Lord said unto me say not
[31:16] I am a child for Thou shalt go to all
[31:20] that I shall send thee look at those
[31:24] eyes before I form thee in the belly I I
[31:28] knew Thee I I I who's doing all this God
[31:31] Jeremiah didn't have one thing to do
[31:32] with it amen and whatsoever I command

[31:47] thought Romans 9:13 and then you may be
[31:50] seated as it is
[31:52] written Jacob have I loved but
[31:56] Esau have I hated right you may be
[31:58] seated the Lord add his Blessing to
[32:00] reading of his word now folks God is not
[32:04] a respector of
[32:06] persons but it looks like in these two
[32:08] scriptures Brother Ray that God is a
[32:10] respector of person that he actually
[32:12] picked these people before they even
[32:14] breathed the breath of air they were
[32:17] chosen to do a job God had already wrote
[32:22] in his word what was going to
[32:25] happen there wasn't one thing had to do
[32:28] with it Jeremiah or Esau or
[32:31] Jacob
[32:33] but the Bible says God is not a
[32:36] respector person
[32:38] amen now tonight we're going to remember
[32:40] brother random said the word
[32:41] predestination was not a good word to
[32:43] use in the
[32:44] congregation maybe he said in a
[32:47] congregation he was trying to say that
[32:48] was a little
[32:50] unlearned but I think we're sitting in a
[32:52] congregation that's a little bit
[32:54] learning so let's talk about
[32:56] predestination because the word
[32:58] predestination means that your destiny
[33:01] was determined before you even got
[33:04] here
[33:07] predestined Destiny predetermined before
[33:11] your destiny was determined before you
[33:13] even got here everybody not just Jacob
[33:16] and Esau not just Jeremiah right so
[33:20] let's look at this and
[33:22] see and look that back before the world
[33:25] God knew what was going to happen happen
[33:28] amen all right now but Satan was there
[33:34] but Satan was not in the mind of God
[33:37] right so we're going to we're going to
[33:39] speak a little bit and then try to put
[33:40] two services in one to get to the point
[33:42] but this is the mystery Satan can't
[33:44] stand he can't stand how how that God
[33:48] has already picked you chose you stamped
[33:52] you and put you already in the future
[33:55] home
[33:58] hold on just a
[33:59] minute but God is not a respector of
[34:02] persons he can't say I pick Timothy and
[34:05] don't pick brother deck right so how can
[34:08] he predetermine that all this was going
[34:11] to happen before we got here when we say
[34:13] all that's for knowledge oh well that's
[34:16] true
[34:17] amen but I thought God's thoughts were
[34:19] Eternal and cannot change
[34:23] right so predestination is
[34:28] like
[34:30] this a line I got something thank
[34:36] you predestination is a line God cannot
[34:40] change his mind about what he's already
[34:43] said God cannot go back on his
[34:47] word God cannot go back on what he's
[34:49] already saw because what he saw is
[34:52] eternal right
[34:54] amen so that's why I think brother
[34:57] brandom was trying to get it to the
[34:59] people that predestination is not a real
[35:01] bad word if you know what you're talking
[35:03] about right all right but now
[35:06] predestination in a in a in a in a baby
[35:10] form is Brother Gary it's it's more like
[35:13] you say there's nothing I can do about
[35:16] it God just knew I was going to you know
[35:20] be a sinner all my
[35:22] life you know it always bothered me that
[35:25] that that I could see how God could
[35:27] could take Adolf Hitler and if he gave
[35:30] Adolf Hitler a million
[35:32] years he'd never repent exactly he could
[35:36] give him 2 million years he'd never
[35:38] repent right he'd give him 3 million
[35:41] years he'd never repent exactly so Adolf
[35:44] Hitler done what he did and went off the
[35:46] scene and God knew that's exactly what
[35:48] he's going to do he knew Adolf Hitler
[35:50] would never ever ask for forgiveness
[35:53] never would come to the knowledge he may
[35:55] come to the knowledge of God but not to
[35:57] the very Mind Of God cuz that's what
[35:59] we're going to try to get to that's the
[36:01] mystery Satan can't stand Brother D he
[36:03] can't get into the mind of God right
[36:06] even the prophet told us one time he
[36:08] said if I speak it watch Satan he'll try
[36:12] to copy oh yeah but he said but if I
[36:13] keep it in my mind or Heart Right heart
[36:16] not in this thumping gizard heart right
[36:18] here but in my heart in the heart of my
[36:20] being right okay if I can keep it right
[36:23] here Satan won't do can't do anything
[36:26] about it well what about
[36:29] God God's got secrets in his mind that
[36:32] he wrote us a
[36:34] letter and tonight across the country if
[36:37] they're having services in the Baptist
[36:39] and the Methodist and the Presbyterians
[36:41] and the Catholics and Brites or whatever
[36:43] right you want to
[36:47] claim same
[36:49] words right and they can preach
[36:52] predestination is that God did choose
[36:54] one and didn't choose the other yeah or
[36:57] they can do like some do and say well
[37:00] it's already pre-planned there's nothing
[37:02] I can do about it I'm just going to go
[37:03] right on through with
[37:05] it but what about a prophet that came
[37:07] and gave us this book or we're talking
[37:10] about tonight we're talking about the
[37:12] perfect will of
[37:13] God because the perfect will of God will
[37:16] never change that's that line that will
[37:19] never
[37:20] change the perfect will of God will
[37:22] never waver it will never
[37:26] falter but now
[37:28] the permissive will of God is what you
[37:31] and I work in a lot of times and that's
[37:34] not the string that you pull across that
[37:36] we call eternity because that's the
[37:38] things listen to this this came to my
[37:40] mind I think while I was on the on the
[37:42] plane but the way for me to understand
[37:45] the perfect will or the permissive will
[37:47] of God is write this down or put it in
[37:50] your mind the perfect will of God he saw
[37:54] it would happen right
[37:57] the permissive will of God let it happen
[38:01] yeah
[38:03] right by your choice
[38:08] exactly the perfect will of God God saw
[38:11] it would happen standing in eternity he
[38:13] saw this was going to happen tonight
[38:15] just this same cting but in permissive
[38:18] will he let it happen by one thing and
[38:22] that's your choice right right exactly
[38:25] so perfect will of God is never going to
[38:27] change
[38:27] right God don't change his mind about
[38:29] his word I was looking up in the
[38:32] back we talk about
[38:35] will brother Dick's going to like this
[38:37] one when I tell him but remember we say
[38:41] well the perfect will of God we say what
[38:43] is what is Will well it's a desire if
[38:45] it's a if it's a verb or if it's a a
[38:50] noun it is the word of somebody or what
[38:53] somebody desires or something that's
[38:55] going to be said that's going to be done
[38:57] but listen to this we always say the
[39:00] perfect will of God or the permissive
[39:01] will of God but have you ever looked at
[39:04] the will of God as a
[39:07] document
[39:09] Y what is a will right
[39:12] right a will is a legal description of a
[39:16] person's wishes regarding the disposal
[39:20] of his or her property yeah or estate
[39:24] after his death
[39:27] that's why the prophet could say that
[39:29] God's will is his word yeah not just
[39:33] that he will it to happen he wrote us a
[39:36] will amen he wrote us this will that's
[39:39] right and out of this will after he died
[39:42] come on had to be the death of a
[39:43] testator right had somebody had to die
[39:46] to give you a will right now this is the
[39:48] perfect will of God right the perfect
[39:52] will written right of God right and I
[39:56] looked up the word self
[39:58] will you know what the word self-will
[40:00] mean
[40:02] Bullhead
[40:04] yeah told you
[40:08] bullheaded but brother randam
[40:11] said there was
[40:14] either what 5 cents is outside 5 cents
[40:17] is the next Rim one cents in the middle
[40:19] Rim which is what self will
[40:23] right bullheaded yeah one way or the
[40:27] other right you can be bullheaded for
[40:30] God or you can be bullheaded for Satan
[40:32] right but we look at well a little bit
[40:35] different way though we say well okay
[40:37] this is the perfect will of God this is
[40:38] the way it's going to happen this is the
[40:40] way God sees it and it is it's his
[40:42] purpose and it is eternal because it is
[40:44] his word this Bible was written brother
[40:46] Bram said your name was written before
[40:47] the foundation of the world so guess
[40:50] what in a in a in an eternal sense it's
[40:53] done and over with
[40:55] finished Paul picks it up and says
[40:57] sitting in Heavenly places because if
[41:00] you go to work long enough you'll
[41:02] realize one thing you're not sitting in
[41:04] Heavenly places down
[41:11] here but everybody's Destiny is
[41:13] determine before they get
[41:15] here but now the perfect will of God is
[41:19] the standard right Eternal cannot change
[41:22] the permissive will of God is what we do
[41:24] with this that's right they understand
[41:27] that the perfect will of God is this but
[41:30] what we do with it right is the
[41:32] permissive will of God right God permits
[41:34] us right he actually permits the Baptist
[41:37] to preach a sermon out of this book
[41:39] right Methodist bramit whoever
[41:43] right but there's only one Mind Of God
[41:46] right one right and it's not a Baptist
[41:48] Faith or a Methodist Faith or a bromite
[41:51] faith you understand what I'm saying
[41:52] putting everything together right it's
[41:55] what he said and saw would happen right
[41:59] hey brother Tom how you doing buddy
[42:02] appreciate that song I knew that's what
[42:04] she was going to sing I asked brother
[42:05] boy didn't get you saying and I knew
[42:06] that's what you going to
[42:08] saying but we were
[42:10] guilty we we were guilty but we were
[42:13] guilty by this right here but what did
[42:15] we do we picked up the will one day read
[42:18] where that if you'll accept the death of
[42:20] something sure see if Daddy died and had
[42:24] a will for me unless I go accept that
[42:26] will
[42:27] right right right unless I go accept
[42:30] that will it'll lay there for centuries
[42:33] amen and nobody can touch it right but
[42:36] if you say okay I claim because I am the
[42:39] son of I am the daughter of come on if I
[42:43] can prove my lineage my
[42:46] genealogy that's what's happening to us
[42:48] now amen we're proving our genealogy
[42:51] that's right
[42:52] right whether we're going to lean toward
[42:55] Mama and Daddy on the Earth
[42:58] our mom and daddy in heaven
[43:00] right perfect will of God Amen but it's
[43:03] all going to work back to this perfect
[43:05] will but in permissive will we can work
[43:07] around in here a little bit let me read
[43:09] you a quote brother R says I'm not going
[43:11] to read all these cuz I read them for
[43:13] two services but we'll skip through some
[43:15] of them brother Brown said does God
[43:17] change his mind
[43:19] 1965
[43:21] 427 so we really believe that God never
[43:24] changes his mind about what he said
[43:27] yeah he always keeps it true but he has
[43:30] a permissive will now there where the
[43:33] trouble lay we try to work on God's
[43:35] permissive will and he will permit it
[43:39] yes but also if we take his permissive
[43:42] will though it's not right he will make
[43:47] his permissive will to work together to
[43:50] glorify his perfect will glory right in
[43:53] other words he's going to let us have
[43:55] permissive will but it's always going to
[43:57] work back to this right here all right
[44:00] so you got your perfect will God let it
[44:02] drop down because of the fall and the
[44:05] things that we've done wrong and he's
[44:06] letting us Roll Along in a permissive
[44:08] will but it's going to always go right
[44:10] back up to the perfect will of almighty
[44:13] God if you hook yourself to
[44:16] that if you become part of the family
[44:19] right we know we can write wheels for
[44:22] people that's not in the family but but
[44:24] let's get it right right brother dick I
[44:28] have absolutely if he were to pass away
[44:31] you know here I go right in the middle
[44:33] of Brad Laur and all them here I go
[44:35] sitting down right in the middle of a
[44:36] whole
[44:37] thing I know you wouldn't you
[44:41] might dick wouldn't like for me to get
[44:43] his
[44:45] money but here I am sitting in front of
[44:47] the judge though I know she's got it
[44:50] all look how I finish my point so I'm
[44:54] sitting here in this room with all these
[44:56] Addison
[44:57] and I'm a Dale right and the judge looks
[45:00] at me and goes what are you doing here I
[45:03] said well I knew brother dick I went to
[45:05] church with him for 20 years roding his
[45:07] car he and him me and him kind of think
[45:09] Al like a little bit judge said that's
[45:12] good anything
[45:14] else no he said well I don't see your
[45:16] name in the whe
[45:19] right I I don't see you were a part of
[45:22] the don't take me out if fam um I don't
[45:26] see him in the in the
[45:28] will why cuz I wasn't a part of his
[45:31] family
[45:33] right I wasn't part of his family
[45:35] exactly so I have no right in claim to
[45:38] anything that brother dick has exactly
[45:41] because I'm not in the will that brother
[45:44] dick made amen right do you understand
[45:47] that exactly and that's the same way
[45:49] with the rest of us if we're not if we
[45:51] don't hook oursel to the right
[45:54] family get the right genealogy right
[45:59] this becomes a judgment book right oh my
[46:02] right because remember permissive is
[46:04] always going to work to the perfect will
[46:05] of God right out here at the end we're
[46:08] going back to that same line again
[46:11] everybody understand that it's not a
[46:13] different line that started here God
[46:15] thought it he knew it he loved Jacob and
[46:19] hated Esau right he loved Jeremiah he
[46:23] knew what Isaiah was going to do made it
[46:26] available for for them and they accepted
[46:29] it Jacob took it Esau turned it down God
[46:32] saw it so
[46:34] now just keep that in mind God's word is
[46:37] always
[46:38] Eternal it's all in the Bible everything
[46:41] in this Bible is predestinated right all
[46:44] right but now he's not going to make you
[46:46] do it let's read Romans 9 while we're
[46:48] right here at 9:13 because um as you've
[46:51] seen Paul's writings he he brings out a
[46:54] thought and then he finishes it so in
[46:56] verse 13 he saying as written Jacob have
[46:58] I loved and Esau have I hated Paul
[47:00] didn't leave it there Paul explained why
[47:03] right verse 19 to save time thou will
[47:06] say then unto me why do he yet find
[47:09] fault right for who hath resisted his
[47:13] will nay but oh man who art thou that
[47:18] repliest against God right Cain
[47:21] did remember Cain did
[47:24] right Cain said am I my Brother's Keeper
[47:27] right shall the thing
[47:30] formed he's talking about he's still
[47:32] keeping the thought of Jacob and Esau
[47:34] right shall the thing form say to him
[47:37] that formed it why hast Thou made me
[47:40] thus
[47:42] right somewhere people like it or
[47:46] not God's going to come to every person
[47:49] in the world and tell them the time and
[47:54] the
[47:55] day that he tried to get them to become
[47:59] part of this well exactly because if not
[48:02] he'd be a respector of persons that's
[48:04] right now we know that the little babies
[48:06] that's why praise God that the prophet
[48:08] could could tell us that that babies
[48:11] before the age of accountability why
[48:12] they have nothing to go on Amen they're
[48:14] automatically in the will right you
[48:17] thought of all I thought of that sister
[48:19] Gil a long time you know about the how
[48:21] many little babies have died we think
[48:24] boy Heaven's going to be so empty
[48:26] Heaven's going to be
[48:27] full this Earth is going to be full the
[48:30] Bible says full it won't be overflowing
[48:34] everybody will have their place but it
[48:35] will be full right CU think of all the
[48:37] babies down through the centuries of
[48:39] time that's died that will be given
[48:41] eternal life there in heaven so so it's
[48:44] not going to be that we going to have to
[48:47] search out and look for somebody no it's
[48:50] going to be full
[48:52] right but
[48:53] listen we bring in a little word called
[48:56] election
[48:57] because we have to bring election in
[48:59] because of one
[49:00] thing God is not a respector a person
[49:04] right and by election he said we'll
[49:07] we'll read it in a few minutes and we're
[49:08] going heading toward Ephesians you know
[49:10] should know that by
[49:12] now but God has set up a a thing called
[49:15] an election we just went through one
[49:18] correct what did you do when you went to
[49:20] an election you cast it a vat right all
[49:24] right and the prophet explains it very
[49:26] simple he says God voted for you the
[49:29] devil voted against
[49:31] you a two to one vote wins this
[49:36] thing got it right vote for this guy you
[49:41] going in his Direction vote for this guy
[49:44] you're going in his Direction so the
[49:45] Bible says by election election looks
[49:48] back we'll read it in just a few minutes
[49:51] God saw what you would elect to vote for
[49:54] who you would elect to vote for
[49:57] all
[49:58] right but now remember people God's not
[50:01] going to make you do anything right
[50:03] that's one thing God will not do he
[50:05] limited himself enough to know one thing
[50:07] that when he put Adam and Eve on free
[50:09] moral agency he put Satan on free moral
[50:11] agency right everybody's on free moral
[50:13] agency and I believe I got a quote
[50:15] somewhere where brother Brown said God
[50:17] was on free moral agency cuz he could
[50:19] choose he's got he made a choice but he
[50:22] makes a
[50:23] choice by what you choose yeah you
[50:26] talking about Jesus doing some things
[50:28] that I mean we doing things Jesus can't
[50:30] do there one thing God can't do he can't
[50:33] make you go to heaven right
[50:35] right he can't make you go to heaven
[50:38] right now before the age accountability
[50:40] don't get me wrong but he can if you're
[50:42] a same person tonight he can't just say
[50:46] I'm going to put you in heaven or he' be
[50:48] a respect your person so he has to go by
[50:50] your
[50:51] choice all right let's read another
[50:53] quote get through real quick
[50:57] but if and does God ever change his mind
[50:59] same same
[51:02] uh book but and if the people won't walk
[51:05] in his perfect will he does have a
[51:07] permissive will he will let you walk in
[51:09] notice he permits it all right but he
[51:11] will make it work out for his glory in
[51:13] his perfect will yeah all
[51:16] right number two now listen father of
[51:20] Abraham 1955 11:18 and predestination is
[51:24] a hard word word among a congregation of
[51:27] people because predestination really
[51:30] forn knowledge is a better word right
[51:32] and predestination looks back to forn
[51:34] knowledge and for knowledge looks on to
[51:36] Destiny that God being infinite in the
[51:40] beginning knew the end from the
[51:41] beginning therefore he knew what people
[51:44] would do right so he could foretell what
[51:47] would take place for he knew what would
[51:50] be therefore before Esau or Jacob either
[51:53] one was born God could say Esau I've
[51:55] hated and Jacob I've loved
[51:57] because he forew what they could be he
[52:00] never made Esau the way he was right he
[52:03] wasn't willing that Esau would be that
[52:06] way but Esau by choice God knew what
[52:10] would take place they what would take
[52:12] that way so that's how he knows us today
[52:14] he knows your heart you might be able to
[52:16] fool your neighbor you might be able to
[52:18] fool your pastor but you'll never be
[52:20] able to fool God that's right cuz he
[52:22] knows your heart and that's the thing
[52:24] about God God knowing your heart I
[52:26] believe believe there'll be a lot of
[52:27] people be giv eternal life cuz God knew
[52:30] remember brother Bram said you and I are
[52:31] going to give an account right for the
[52:33] people we can't get
[52:35] to and God won't hold that against them
[52:38] all right pretty tough right but that's
[52:42] what he said right faith of Abraham same
[52:46] same um book
[52:48] chapter paragraph E20 therefore he by
[52:53] election I like this one he chose
[52:56] Abraham now remember I don't think he
[52:58] just spoke just to Abraham right I think
[53:01] he spoke to a lot of people right
[53:03] Abraham's the only one that said I'll do
[53:06] it right that's how simple that is Mary
[53:08] was the only one that said in her heart
[53:11] right be it unto me according to Thy
[53:13] word now she many of them probably could
[53:16] have said that listen to what he said
[53:18] about Abraham listen to this Prophet you
[53:20] remember when he called him out there
[53:22] and said he had not keep a thing a
[53:24] secret from him when he was going down
[53:28] to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah for he
[53:31] said now this is not verb Adam in the
[53:34] Bible but listen to what brother what
[53:35] brother R said about it this is his
[53:37] quote he said from about God for I know
[53:41] that Abraham will teach his children
[53:46] Amen in other words he knew what Abraham
[53:48] would do with it right when God give it
[53:50] to
[53:51] him he knew what he knew that maybe
[53:54] maybe John Doe the the neighbor of
[53:56] Abraham wouldn't do that right he keep
[53:59] it to himself or wouldn't do but listen
[54:01] for I know that Abraham will teach his
[54:03] children I know it God himself I know
[54:06] that Abraham will send this message on
[54:09] down from one generation to the other
[54:13] right brother dony that's what he saw in
[54:16] Abraham he saw that Abraham would be the
[54:18] father of our faith but he would not
[54:20] keep it to himself but he would pass it
[54:23] down from generation to generation
[54:28] God's covenant with Abraham sou Falls
[54:29] South Dakota
[54:32] 1956 now Jesus didn't come to Calvary
[54:34] just for a halfhazard thought well I'll
[54:36] die up there perhaps maybe somebody will
[54:38] feel sorry for me and come down and get
[54:40] saved no no God don't run his office
[54:43] like that you don't run your office like
[54:45] that Jesus came for one specific purpose
[54:48] that was to redeem those that God forne
[54:52] would be redeemed right now listen
[54:54] brother Ram told us
[54:56] and it shocked the people in
[54:58] Bartlesville because they didn't
[55:00] remember the quote but dad's preached on
[55:02] it several times Jesus never come to
[55:05] give you an inheritance right
[55:10] exactly Jesus never came to give you an
[55:13] inheritance
[55:16] am your inheritance was before the
[55:18] foundation of the
[55:20] world Jesus just came down here to take
[55:23] you back to
[55:25] it right now I don't like that word just
[55:28] cuz that limits everything you know
[55:30] Jesus didn't just come to do that I mean
[55:32] come to save those that that were lost
[55:35] but he had a specific plan and it was
[55:38] not to bring you an inheritance right
[55:42] you're inheritance was before the
[55:43] foundation of the world God wrote your
[55:44] name in the
[55:46] book God just came down here to tell you
[55:49] you're written here somewhere in this
[55:51] book that we call a
[55:54] will but it kind of shock people when
[55:57] you when you when you quote that to them
[56:00] because they said ma'am Jesus had to
[56:03] come to do something exactly and let me
[56:05] see if I can find it he made the way
[56:09] exactly let me see if I can find it I'll
[56:12] just read it
[56:15] now and if I don't I'll get to it in
[56:17] just a
[56:24] minute position in Christ
[56:26] 1960 522 inheritance by predestination
[56:31] see that's what Satan can't stand he
[56:33] looks down here and sees us working in
[56:36] permissive will of
[56:38] God sinning doing things
[56:41] wrong we're humans he can't understand
[56:45] though that God he knows that God had
[56:47] some plan or he wouldn't be doing what
[56:50] he's doing but he's got some plan for
[56:53] you and
[56:55] I but but Satan can't understand that
[56:58] he's still accusing us of things right
[57:01] but listen inheritance by predestination
[57:03] position in Christ 196
[57:05] 522 now Joseph's got all these copies so
[57:08] they'll be on the internet if you need
[57:09] them inheritance by predestination I
[57:12] inherited something what inheritance
[57:15] there had to be somebody leaving me an
[57:16] inheritance why you say Jesus left you
[57:19] an inheritance beg your pardon Jesus
[57:22] never left me an inheritance Jesus never
[57:25] left you an inheritance
[57:27] he only came down and paid for your
[57:29] inheritance brought you to your
[57:32] inheritance remember we were in to
[57:35] inherit eternal
[57:37] life that was our inheritance to live on
[57:41] this Earth Body Spirit and soul
[57:43] Eternal right right brother Gary amen I
[57:47] believe that 100% but remember what
[57:50] happened the separation came
[57:53] right Adam couldn't get back to God God
[57:56] couldn't get to Adam so it wasn't that
[57:59] that Adam totally lost
[58:03] everything the inheritance was still
[58:06] there right remember brother re said it
[58:08] wasn't that God didn't annihilate the
[58:10] inheritance he just took it away from
[58:12] Adam and said you're not going to be
[58:13] able to produce this will
[58:16] anymore I'm going to have to come and
[58:18] die because remember Adam couldn't die
[58:20] for mine and your sins right so
[58:23] somebody's got to die to give you a will
[58:25] amen right that's right so that's what
[58:28] God did God Jesus didn't come to to to
[58:31] give you a new inheritance he came to
[58:33] say look believe in
[58:37] me become part of my family and I'll
[58:40] give you this what my father the will of
[58:42] My
[58:43] Father which is the word of God all
[58:46] right beg your pardon Jesus never left
[58:48] me an inheritance Jes Jesus never left
[58:50] you one he only came down and paid for
[58:53] your inheritance brought you to your
[58:54] inheritance but but your name was put on
[58:57] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[58:58] foundation of the world God give you
[59:00] your inheritance your inheritance was
[59:03] first right there's that line Brother D
[59:08] there's that line that's that perfect
[59:10] will of God right that I'm going to have
[59:13] children right I'm going to have a
[59:17] family and this is the way it's going to
[59:19] be right now we choose to get to that is
[59:24] where the choice comes in sure
[59:26] we dropped down here brother R said to
[59:28] make a choice right but God knew what
[59:31] choice he was going to make before you
[59:32] even got here amen Jacob have I loved
[59:35] Esau have I hated now let's go on
[59:40] through but remember we were back in God
[59:44] before the foundation of the world in
[59:46] what not in a body form no not in a in a
[59:50] theophany as
[59:52] individuals but in what God Said right
[59:55] right
[59:56] but now
[59:58] remember before God said
[1:00:01] it he had to think it right right I
[1:00:06] going to try to find it I'm kind of
[1:00:07] getting a littlee because I'm trying to
[1:00:08] produce two services in one but that's
[1:00:10] okay okay here we go number
[1:00:14] three God's power to transform you were
[1:00:17] in your great great great
[1:00:19] grandfather you were in the loins of
[1:00:22] your father but your father could not
[1:00:24] have any fellowship with you until you
[1:00:26] were transformed into a body of Flesh
[1:00:30] right my son there was in me I wanted a
[1:00:33] son but he was in me then he was in me
[1:00:36] then but through wedlock he was
[1:00:38] transformed into a man like me and then
[1:00:41] he became like me amen and you become
[1:00:44] like your parents CU it was in you to
[1:00:46] begin with now if you are the Son of God
[1:00:48] his attributes which you are an
[1:00:50] attribute of your father not your mother
[1:00:52] your father The Germ lays in the father
[1:00:54] now your mother was an incubator that
[1:00:55] bears you you Bears the seed of your
[1:00:58] father read on down just skip a few more
[1:01:01] um paragraphs same God's power to
[1:01:03] transformed and the Earth in flesh is
[1:01:05] also the incubator incubator that bears
[1:01:08] the seed of God not the world how great
[1:01:11] the world is is how great the god that
[1:01:13] made it Glory now if you are a son and
[1:01:15] daughter of God then you were in God at
[1:01:17] the beginning you're his attribute if
[1:01:19] you wasn't there then you never was or
[1:01:23] you never will be right keep reading
[1:01:26] now then now you can fellowship with him
[1:01:28] in other words you're you're out now you
[1:01:30] couldn't back there because you were
[1:01:32] just a word in him right right a seed
[1:01:38] Jesus said a sore the seed goes out all
[1:01:41] right what the son of man do he sowed
[1:01:43] the seed what he slded the foundation or
[1:01:44] he solded the the way for you and us to
[1:01:46] you and I to get
[1:01:49] here I'm like Daddy we went out to
[1:01:51] Kansas and we didn't have a bit of
[1:01:52] problem with our voice or or sinuses or
[1:01:55] nothing we come back home and it's got
[1:01:57] both of us but anyway praise the lord we
[1:01:59] got back so it's okay amen you couldn't
[1:02:02] back there because you were just a word
[1:02:03] and him a seed but now he's manifested
[1:02:06] in you and now he wants you to
[1:02:08] fellowship with him see the perfect
[1:02:11] Fellowship right oh my them deep
[1:02:13] mysteries of God how wonderful God could
[1:02:16] not Fellowship in spirit so God became
[1:02:20] man right Jesus Christ was God himself
[1:02:24] manifested cuz he was a son because he
[1:02:26] was begotten but it was just a
[1:02:28] tabernacle for him to live in that's
[1:02:30] right glor praise the Lord for that amen
[1:02:33] but now what can he do he can now be our
[1:02:36] brother to do what to be a brother put
[1:02:40] you in the family right right then it
[1:02:42] puts you in line for the
[1:02:45] will sometimes we look at perfect will
[1:02:47] permissive will and we look at a God
[1:02:49] that says all right that's the way it's
[1:02:50] going to be which that's
[1:02:53] true but he knows what it was before he
[1:02:56] started all right try to get back to
[1:02:58] that I know it's very very
[1:03:00] simple but we were in C germ 4 and
[1:03:02] brother brandham said God thought
[1:03:07] it and then when he spoke it it had to
[1:03:10] become material right all right so he
[1:03:13] started bringing all these things forth
[1:03:14] and guess what
[1:03:16] happened you and I were an attribute in
[1:03:19] his
[1:03:20] thoughts and if you are if you were if
[1:03:23] you're born again tonight if you're born
[1:03:26] again if you have the new birth you have
[1:03:28] that same
[1:03:32] theophany that was before the foundation
[1:03:34] of the
[1:03:35] world dwelling in your
[1:03:40] soul the very
[1:03:43] Creator folks let me tell you this is
[1:03:47] why without the new birth you can't
[1:03:49] understand these things but with the new
[1:03:51] birth I actually you can go into that
[1:03:55] very mind of the man that made this
[1:03:58] thing right and you can glean things out
[1:04:01] of this will that a lot of people are
[1:04:03] not going to ever get out of it right
[1:04:07] because let me tell you one
[1:04:08] thing this is a good
[1:04:11] point if I come and I write a
[1:04:14] book about my life
[1:04:19] yeah I can't use any of the family take
[1:04:22] brother Joe Solace he doesn't know all
[1:04:24] of my past
[1:04:26] than brother Joe Solace I write a
[1:04:29] book and I hand that book to brother
[1:04:32] Joe I'm the author yeah and it's a
[1:04:35] biography of of a true story of my life
[1:04:39] and I hand it to brother Joe and brother
[1:04:41] Joe reads it and he says oh that's a
[1:04:45] good
[1:04:47] story but if some
[1:04:50] way my
[1:04:52] personality my being my vision could be
[1:04:56] transformed into Joe
[1:04:58] Solace now when Joe Solus reads that
[1:05:01] book it's as if he lived it
[1:05:05] right but Tom that's what this book that
[1:05:07] we call a Bible is right it can be read
[1:05:10] as a good story book it can be read as
[1:05:14] just some good like brother Tom said War
[1:05:15] Stories right brother
[1:05:17] Tom it can be read to say oh somebody is
[1:05:20] over there somebody over here somebody
[1:05:22] over there but what about when the very
[1:05:24] author of the book come
[1:05:26] on takes a hold of your
[1:05:30] being not the being your Mom and Daddy
[1:05:33] brought in the world but that being
[1:05:35] inside of you that Supernatural part of
[1:05:38] you and he takes that little speck of
[1:05:42] himself and he places it in your
[1:05:44] heart right and he don't give it to you
[1:05:47] to take it away from you exct right when
[1:05:51] he gives it to you he
[1:05:54] vulcanize he takes that rubber and melts
[1:05:57] it to rubber right he takes that old
[1:06:00] Stony heart out which is made of
[1:06:04] stone and he puts a heart of Flesh and
[1:06:08] then what does God do he takes his
[1:06:09] spirit and puts it in that man now
[1:06:13] brother joose Solus can read that
[1:06:16] book and enter into the
[1:06:19] same life that the author lived right
[1:06:24] that's what we got to do people amen am
[1:06:26] amen that's what's going to get us out
[1:06:28] of here I believe that that's the only
[1:06:31] thing that's going to get us out of here
[1:06:33] because that book is read by billions
[1:06:35] and billions of people sermons are
[1:06:38] preached by billions and billions of
[1:06:40] people there's no telling how many
[1:06:41] sermons that that been preached since
[1:06:43] brother bram's been dead right just out
[1:06:45] of the 1160 sermons right of the
[1:06:48] interpretation of the Bible that's right
[1:06:50] right amen but how many interpretations
[1:06:52] they had they never entered into the
[1:06:55] heart of the
[1:06:57] composer those little stories brother
[1:06:59] Brown told was not just little stories
[1:07:01] to fill in till God give him something
[1:07:02] to say I believe that was what God was
[1:07:05] giving him to say cuz he'd say if I was
[1:07:08] bethoven tonight what would I do I'd
[1:07:11] write a
[1:07:14] symphony if I was God Almighty tonight I
[1:07:18] could understand this book
[1:07:20] right now we know we're limited by our
[1:07:22] human ability so was Jesus
[1:07:27] but he chose it that way right you and I
[1:07:29] didn't have a choice we were born this
[1:07:31] way am but we do have a choice to get
[1:07:33] back right to that part amen right
[1:07:38] right I like that amen you enter in to
[1:07:44] the very it's not that you're reading as
[1:07:46] a second
[1:07:50] person cuz remember brother Bram always
[1:07:53] said if it's two right one's God one's
[1:07:57] the devil that's right so if you read
[1:08:00] this and not get what the author was
[1:08:05] saying that's how close Christ and
[1:08:09] Antichrist is in this end time right if
[1:08:12] you can't read it in the heart of the
[1:08:14] composer that wrote it it's
[1:08:17] Antichrist it's anti- word amen cuz it's
[1:08:21] just a letter right it's just a
[1:08:24] form but you know what if we take it as
[1:08:27] a
[1:08:28] will that makes us part right if it it
[1:08:32] says on top of that will somewhere it
[1:08:33] says
[1:08:34] Dale right I'm going to be sitting at
[1:08:37] the in the lawyer's office right you
[1:08:40] couldn't stop me don't thing stop me be
[1:08:45] Church lot of you wouldn't stop you
[1:08:47] there
[1:08:53] right but we got here
[1:08:57] but now
[1:09:00] look when we got
[1:09:03] here our
[1:09:06] choice was whether to stay the son of
[1:09:09] who you were naturally
[1:09:11] born by or through right or like Jesus
[1:09:16] told Nicodemus the same sitting is you
[1:09:19] say well poor Nicodemus we all were the
[1:09:21] same
[1:09:22] way carnally we said or we just shake a
[1:09:27] hand take the right hand of
[1:09:30] Fellowship a lot of people get the left
[1:09:32] foot of Fellowship but a right hand of
[1:09:35] Fellowship that's what Nicodemus was
[1:09:37] saying if I got carnally he said if I
[1:09:38] got to go back and get in my mother's
[1:09:40] womb in other words we got to do this
[1:09:43] same birthing process over again what
[1:09:45] did Jesus say he said no he said
[1:09:48] Nicodemus you can't you're already born
[1:09:50] down here Born Again means it's the
[1:09:52] second time right right you got to be
[1:09:55] born from above right same way with you
[1:09:58] and I you say oh poor Nicodemus that's
[1:10:00] the same way you and I have a choice to
[1:10:02] stay the son of Samuel and Peggy Dale
[1:10:05] are become the son of Jesus Christ
[1:10:08] exactly all of us all right now
[1:10:13] look for knowledge we spoke a little bit
[1:10:17] about but let's go into forn knowledge
[1:10:18] just for a second because you have to
[1:10:19] bring in for knowledge or people say
[1:10:23] well God did just just pull me through a
[1:10:26] cube now let's listen Book of Exodus
[1:10:30] 1955 the word predestinate that's not a
[1:10:32] good word to use the word forn knowledge
[1:10:34] is better better you know what the word
[1:10:36] for knowledge means very simple
[1:10:39] knowledge before it happens right
[1:10:42] knowledge of what's going to happen
[1:10:43] before it happens that's simple as you
[1:10:45] can make for
[1:10:47] knowledge predestination looks back to
[1:10:49] for knowledge why God can't
[1:10:53] predestinate and be
[1:10:55] giving you a choice if he didn't go by
[1:10:59] for knowledge cuz he had to see it first
[1:11:02] therefore he could predestinate all
[1:11:04] right so predestination looks back to
[1:11:07] where he was at in for
[1:11:08] knowledge
[1:11:10] okay for knowledge looks to destination
[1:11:13] God saw your destination exactly very
[1:11:18] simple but God not making set it in
[1:11:21] order a little hole that you have to go
[1:11:23] through and can't go no other way
[1:11:26] but God in order to be God he know the
[1:11:28] end from the beginning so he could
[1:11:30] predict it and set things in order going
[1:11:33] happen where I think Pentecost failed
[1:11:35] 1955 1111 now the word is used here in
[1:11:39] the fifth verse of predestination
[1:11:41] predestinated it's not a very good word
[1:11:43] for an evangelist or minister to use
[1:11:44] because it kind of confuses the people
[1:11:46] when you say predestinate predestination
[1:11:48] speaks looks back to for knowledge for
[1:11:51] knowledge looks to destination
[1:11:53] predestination goes back to forge
[1:11:55] knowledge for knowledge goes to
[1:11:57] destination in other words God didn't
[1:11:59] say now I'll make this man be this and
[1:12:02] I'll make this man be that but in order
[1:12:05] to be God he had to know the end from
[1:12:06] the beginning right so in order to forn
[1:12:09] knowledge that he knew I'm reading this
[1:12:11] what he said he could say this would
[1:12:14] happen and that would happen because he
[1:12:15] was God and knows where everything would
[1:12:17] be placed and therefore he could ordain
[1:12:19] certain things for certain ages right
[1:12:23] you say well how in the world
[1:12:28] somewhere God saw
[1:12:33] you before the foundation of the
[1:12:38] world had to see
[1:12:40] you had to know what age you'd
[1:12:43] be and had to some way brother BR said
[1:12:47] through this one through this one
[1:12:48] breeding this one with this one this one
[1:12:49] this one this one this one to get you
[1:12:51] here no all right not of you're choosing
[1:12:54] to get here but after you got here God
[1:12:58] knew what you'd do okay Jacob have I
[1:13:00] loved Esau have I hated look Ephesians
[1:13:03] parallels Joshua predestination looks
[1:13:06] back to for knowledge I mean election
[1:13:08] election looks back to for knowledge and
[1:13:10] predestination looks to Destiny don't
[1:13:12] forget that election looks back here
[1:13:15] here it is I was a cucklebur I was born
[1:13:17] in sin shaped in iniquity come to the
[1:13:19] world speaking lies now this quote right
[1:13:21] here a lot of people can't stand right
[1:13:24] they hate this quote because brother
[1:13:25] Bram said I was an eagle I always was an
[1:13:27] eagle I always was this eternal life or
[1:13:30] this seed or whatever but listen to
[1:13:33] this I was a cuckle bar right I was born
[1:13:37] in sin shaped in iniquity come to the
[1:13:39] world speaking lies born among Sinners
[1:13:42] father and mother and all my whole
[1:13:44] family were Sinners right I was a
[1:13:46] cucklebur right but all of a sudden I
[1:13:50] became a wheat Jour amen
[1:13:56] I thought God's power to transform did
[1:13:58] that
[1:13:59] yeah I became a wheat grain how did it
[1:14:02] happen what was it
[1:14:05] election God knew what you choose was an
[1:14:08] election you're choosing an officer to
[1:14:10] fill a position right you elect him
[1:14:13] because you vote more votes for this guy
[1:14:15] than you do for this guy like I said you
[1:14:17] voted you know God voted for you devil
[1:14:19] voted against you you swing the vote God
[1:14:21] before the foundation of the world
[1:14:23] elected that that c was to
[1:14:26] become a grain of wheat by for knowledge
[1:14:29] he seen that I would love him so he made
[1:14:32] a pritu through his own son that through
[1:14:35] him I might become from a cleur to a
[1:14:38] grain of
[1:14:40] wheat we were all born in sin going in
[1:14:44] One Direction Right Prophet priest our
[1:14:46] King doesn't matter it's like brother
[1:14:48] Ryan asked uh here tonight ask in the
[1:14:51] Bible study that how it looked that that
[1:14:54] God did um was a respector persons by
[1:14:58] telling brother Brandon before he even
[1:15:00] begin to to to come to a knowledge of
[1:15:02] anything he said told Brother Brom he
[1:15:04] said now don't smoke Don't drink don't
[1:15:06] defile your body
[1:15:08] right you'd think well boy he if he done
[1:15:11] that to me maybe I'd be different no or
[1:15:14] he would
[1:15:16] have sorry that's just the way God is no
[1:15:20] sorry you say boy if I was back there
[1:15:22] when Jesus was crucified no you'd have
[1:15:24] been just the rest of them exactly
[1:15:27] that's why God had you in this age to
[1:15:29] believe this all right but brother Ryan
[1:15:32] said that looked more like a respected
[1:15:34] person but daddy said in great wisdom he
[1:15:38] said well son he was not protecting
[1:15:41] William brandham he was protecting the
[1:15:43] gift right because look brother brandham
[1:15:47] picked up the
[1:15:49] bottle it wasn't that he said I never
[1:15:51] done those
[1:15:52] things I never smoked never drank never
[1:15:55] defile my body no he picked the
[1:15:57] cigarette up and was going to smoke it
[1:16:00] he picked the bottle up and was going to
[1:16:01] drink it right he said I was going to
[1:16:04] drink it right he said I was going to
[1:16:06] kill them boys I was going to kill that
[1:16:09] man that pour in my dog
[1:16:12] right I put a gun to my head to commit
[1:16:15] suicide right I was going to do those
[1:16:18] things he didn't say I thought about
[1:16:19] doing them he said I was going to do
[1:16:21] them exactly but God protected the gift
[1:16:24] that the a man had he had to Glory cuz
[1:16:28] that gift had to come but it came
[1:16:30] through that man because it molded
[1:16:31] itself together same way with you and I
[1:16:34] I got a quote here brother bam said said
[1:16:36] God knew he said he didn't just make you
[1:16:38] a preacher because he want just to fill
[1:16:40] a place right he knew you could handle
[1:16:43] certain things he knew others couldn't
[1:16:45] handle certain things that's why it's
[1:16:47] not a it's not a shame to not be a
[1:16:51] everybody wants to be a
[1:16:53] preacher everybody wants to be preacher
[1:16:55] why why yeah I'd love to come in 5
[1:16:59] minutes before the service
[1:17:02] starts or
[1:17:04] later and sit in the front Pew and just
[1:17:06] say praise the
[1:17:08] Lord can't do that right I can't do that
[1:17:11] right I'm constantly thinking about you
[1:17:14] people amen constantly thinking about
[1:17:15] all the people I go speak for constantly
[1:17:19] just thinking about now God knows I
[1:17:21] don't 24 hours a day I don't think about
[1:17:23] it I'm sorry got a job got kids and the
[1:17:25] family you know but I do it's on my mind
[1:17:29] right you know what does the people need
[1:17:31] right I wish I could go home and lay
[1:17:33] down at night and just
[1:17:35] say Lord bless
[1:17:37] them I can't do that cuz we all got
[1:17:41] problems we all got things that we got
[1:17:43] to deal
[1:17:44] with but God by for knowledge
[1:17:48] knew that you know you somebody people
[1:17:51] say well how can you handle things like
[1:17:53] brother Dale he how do he handles things
[1:17:55] maybe different than I do and there's
[1:17:57] some things I disagree that he that he
[1:17:59] handles but I see telling me from his
[1:18:01] face but I'm not the boss right I'm just
[1:18:05] the secretary come on it's like Claud
[1:18:07] said Claud said if I want to talk he
[1:18:09] called me he said where's your daddy at
[1:18:11] I said well he so and so and so and so I
[1:18:12] said what do you need he said well I
[1:18:13] need to ask him a question and I started
[1:18:15] to say one time I said well just ask you
[1:18:17] know I ask me I'll see if I can answer
[1:18:19] it he said I don't want to talk to the
[1:18:20] secretary he said I want to talk to the
[1:18:22] boss I said okay I give his number don't
[1:18:25] call me
[1:18:29] back dick he just knows we're highly
[1:18:35] opinionated he may listen to this but
[1:18:37] that's
[1:18:39] okay but listen God had us in his mind
[1:18:43] right knew what age we would fit in
[1:18:46] there's no other age we could be a lot
[1:18:49] of us would be scared cowards if we were
[1:18:51] in that fourth age we may not have made
[1:18:54] it oh
[1:18:55] that's right come on people we may not
[1:18:57] have made it right but God put us in
[1:18:59] this age to do a certain
[1:19:02] thing that's what I want to get to I'm
[1:19:04] going to skip a little bit and get down
[1:19:06] to right
[1:19:08] here let's go to Romans no let's don't
[1:19:10] let's let's forget that we got to get
[1:19:12] through well it's just 8:15 Lord yall
[1:19:15] who got to get go to work
[1:19:18] tomorrow Sarah you can slip out if you
[1:19:20] need to and sister Trudy if you nod your
[1:19:23] head fall asleep that's okay the rest of
[1:19:25] us don't have to get up in the morning
[1:19:26] praise the Lord so we can go on a little
[1:19:29] bit further can we do that Romans
[1:19:32] 8 you love the Lord amen I do too love
[1:19:35] you guys too miss you while we were
[1:19:38] gone sure did Romans 8:28 and we know
[1:19:42] that all things work together for good
[1:19:45] to them that love God to them are who
[1:19:47] are the called according to his purpose
[1:19:51] see we were called according to his
[1:19:53] purpose not our purpose right we were
[1:19:55] called according to his purpose he
[1:19:57] called and we answered his purpose he
[1:20:00] didn't call and we answered our own
[1:20:01] purpose right those he may have
[1:20:05] called did and they didn't respond like
[1:20:08] Abraham's time he probably asked a bunch
[1:20:10] of people hey would you must believe me
[1:20:12] and probably a lot of people said no
[1:20:15] probably a lot of people had other
[1:20:16] things to
[1:20:17] do but listen to this excuse me for whom
[1:20:21] he did Forno in other words he had to
[1:20:23] know you before that's what forn
[1:20:25] knowledge is for them whom he did for
[1:20:27] know he also did
[1:20:30] predestinate there's the key
[1:20:33] right set in
[1:20:36] stone but your name's not right there
[1:20:39] unless you believe it's right there
[1:20:41] right exactly you make the choice to put
[1:20:44] yourself in this scripture right here
[1:20:47] right see because way Dale's not right
[1:20:50] here but I can say I am because why he
[1:20:53] also did predestin
[1:20:55] to be conformed right right not to the
[1:20:58] image of the son of Samuel and pegy day
[1:21:01] right
[1:21:03] right but it said the image of his son
[1:21:06] right that he might be the first born
[1:21:08] among many many Brethren moreover whom
[1:21:10] he did
[1:21:11] predestinate ly drawn Eternal no way you
[1:21:14] can get out of it
[1:21:17] why moreover whom he did predestinate
[1:21:20] them he called right right and whom he
[1:21:22] called right not Mama call and daddy
[1:21:25] sent they like that Daddy was in
[1:21:28] Barbersville and they really got a
[1:21:29] chuckle out of that Mama called and
[1:21:31] daddy sent moreover whom he did
[1:21:33] predestinate them he also called and
[1:21:36] whom he
[1:21:37] called them he also Justified and whom
[1:21:41] he justified look at all them he nothing
[1:21:44] we did we just accepted it he justified
[1:21:48] them he also glorified what shall we say
[1:21:50] then to these things repeat after me if
[1:21:54] God be for us who can be against
[1:21:58] us Happy
[1:22:00] Thanksgiving cuz that's what God give
[1:22:04] you but now
[1:22:07] look if we're not born
[1:22:10] again we're going to come to this
[1:22:13] perfect part of we're going to meet this
[1:22:15] part exactly that's
[1:22:18] perfect does everybody understand that
[1:22:21] if we don't accept the pardon if we
[1:22:23] don't accept this will if we don't
[1:22:26] attach oursel to this economy or this or
[1:22:28] this uh family of God you're going to me
[1:22:31] it's not like say well well if I don't
[1:22:33] choose to accept then I'm okay no if you
[1:22:36] don't choose to accept then you've got
[1:22:38] to meet that perfect again and God is
[1:22:41] going to ask you why right you didn't
[1:22:45] exactly and when you turn that
[1:22:47] down that brings the Judgment right
[1:22:51] that's why that we're already judged now
[1:22:54] and don't have to be judged
[1:22:56] later okay and has passed from death
[1:23:00] death and life now let's go to Ephesians
[1:23:04] 1 if we don't come to this word
[1:23:07] birth or the old adamic nature must die
[1:23:11] right then we've got to give an account
[1:23:13] for that old man
[1:23:16] right but just like I told him in in in
[1:23:19] Oklahoma my grandfather Daddy's Daddy
[1:23:22] has been dead since 19
[1:23:27] 45 there's no way I could go out
[1:23:30] tomorrow and go to and get me a lawyer
[1:23:32] and go to court and tell the whole Court
[1:23:36] my grandpa robbed a bank
[1:23:39] yesterday why he's dead right been dead
[1:23:46] right go show you where he's
[1:23:49] buried that's the same thing's got to
[1:23:51] happen to me and you right because if he
[1:23:54] was alive alive I'd have a case
[1:23:58] right if he was alive I'm telling you if
[1:24:01] he was alive I'd have a case right right
[1:24:04] but if he's
[1:24:05] dead there's no case in the court of the
[1:24:07] land going to ever accuse a dead man of
[1:24:10] doing something after he's already
[1:24:11] died same way with you and I that old
[1:24:14] adamic Nature has to die now Ephesians
[1:24:20] 1 I hope you knew that's where we were
[1:24:22] coming to
[1:24:33] now remember the mind of god is perfect
[1:24:37] amen the mind of God was back before the
[1:24:39] foundation of the world the mind of God
[1:24:41] was way up here up here all
[1:24:45] right and then we had to come down here
[1:24:49] to get into the permissive part all
[1:24:51] right but even getting into the
[1:24:53] permissive part there's a way back amen
[1:24:56] okay this is the simple part but let's
[1:24:58] watch
[1:24:59] Ephesians chapter
[1:25:03] 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the
[1:25:06] will of God to the Saints which are in
[1:25:09] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[1:25:11] Jesus so it's not to the
[1:25:14] world it's to the saints that are in
[1:25:18] Christ Grace be to you and peace from
[1:25:20] God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[1:25:22] Christ blessed be the God and Father of
[1:25:24] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed
[1:25:27] us with all spiritual blessings in
[1:25:30] Heavenly places in Christ according as
[1:25:32] he has chosen
[1:25:35] us with
[1:25:37] [Music]
[1:25:40] him oh what did that
[1:25:42] say in not with in where were we we were
[1:25:48] in him amen before the foundation of the
[1:25:50] world Amen chosen Us in him before
[1:25:54] for the foundation of the world that we
[1:25:58] should be holy and Without Blame before
[1:26:01] him in love that cannot be talking about
[1:26:05] tonight in a natural
[1:26:08] form none of us are
[1:26:10] holy we're holy if we're in Christ
[1:26:14] right and Without Blame oh NOP
[1:26:19] sorry I saw you do it you saw me do it
[1:26:25] so this must be in heaven this must be
[1:26:27] what God has
[1:26:29] stamped that's going to be this is the
[1:26:32] mind of God this is
[1:26:36] eternal before the foundation world that
[1:26:38] we should be holy God took a picture of
[1:26:41] you before you ever got
[1:26:44] here and that's what you're going to
[1:26:48] Glory Without Blame before him in
[1:26:52] love having pred destinated us unto the
[1:26:57] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:26:59] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:27:02] of his will that's nothing in that's
[1:27:05] permissive his will is perfect right to
[1:27:09] the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:27:12] wherein he hath made us
[1:27:14] accepted in the Beloved all let's say it
[1:27:18] like this wherein he ha made
[1:27:21] us accepted
[1:27:24] in the
[1:27:26] attribute Brother G is that okay in the
[1:27:29] attribute cuz if you weren't in that
[1:27:31] attribute you're never going to get down
[1:27:33] here to this verse 7 through 14 exactly
[1:27:37] so verse 1-6 is what God has already
[1:27:40] said about us that perfect will of God
[1:27:44] that can never be
[1:27:46] changed can never go
[1:27:48] away listen people if we're holy and
[1:27:51] Without Blame
[1:27:54] Satan's blaming us already we understand
[1:27:56] that but this part of God is what he's
[1:27:59] already
[1:28:00] saw that's going to happen now look at
[1:28:03] verse
[1:28:06] seven he's dropping down to tell you how
[1:28:09] yeah that we're going to get back up to
[1:28:13] verse 3
[1:28:16] through6 in whom we have
[1:28:21] Redemption through his blood
[1:28:24] the Forgiveness of
[1:28:26] sins according to the riches of his
[1:28:28] grace right now I believe that's right
[1:28:30] here now wherein Heath abounded toward
[1:28:33] us look at all those uses and we and all
[1:28:37] wisdom and Prudence having made known
[1:28:40] unto us
[1:28:42] right now that wasn't before the
[1:28:44] foundation of the world we were already
[1:28:45] in him we were
[1:28:47] there but look at this having made known
[1:28:50] unto us what reading of his will
[1:28:54] after the death of the testator shedding
[1:28:57] see look say in Redemption through his
[1:28:58] blood we know he died 2,000 years ago
[1:29:01] but we know he died before the
[1:29:02] foundation of the world but brother
[1:29:03] brand said if if he didn't die 2,000
[1:29:06] years ago and shed his natural blood
[1:29:09] there was no 4,000 years ago that he
[1:29:11] died in the mind of God exactly so he
[1:29:13] had to come here and do it so we look to
[1:29:15] that amen that he absolutely came on
[1:29:17] this Earth and did what he said he was
[1:29:19] going to do Glory shed through his blood
[1:29:23] that's right having made known unto us
[1:29:25] the mystery of his word will when not
[1:29:31] before the foundation of the world right
[1:29:33] here right glory after you've heard the
[1:29:37] word trth of Salvation truth we'll get
[1:29:39] to that that's what he's saying right
[1:29:40] here Paul is going to bring us take us
[1:29:43] from Heaven show us it's already done
[1:29:44] and finished bring us down on Earth and
[1:29:46] tell us how we're going to get to that
[1:29:48] amen because look having made known unto
[1:29:51] us the mystery of his will according to
[1:29:53] his good good pleasure remember it all
[1:29:55] works back to his
[1:29:56] pleasure which he has purposed in
[1:30:01] himself I am going to have a bride amen
[1:30:05] look I am going to have this string
[1:30:07] right here that's called eternity I am
[1:30:10] going to have what was in my mind
[1:30:12] there's nothing going to stop that right
[1:30:14] the reason he can do that though he saw
[1:30:17] what we would want and we would want
[1:30:19] that right the Eternal part so he had it
[1:30:23] there for us a fish he could have never
[1:30:26] brother R said a lot of times you know
[1:30:27] he say well the sulfur the the sulfur
[1:30:30] had to be there in the rubber the had to
[1:30:32] be there before the child had a desire
[1:30:34] same thing with you and I yeah there had
[1:30:36] to be a God in heaven there had to be
[1:30:38] eternal life there had to be shed of the
[1:30:40] blood for us to want it for that desire
[1:30:44] to be drawn to that right can't be drawn
[1:30:47] you know water can't if there's no water
[1:30:50] there why do you need a fish right but
[1:30:52] since we got water now we have a
[1:30:55] fish all
[1:30:57] right that in the dispensation of the
[1:31:00] fullness of times now when is that now
[1:31:03] this is the dispensation of the fullness
[1:31:05] of all things amen right he might gather
[1:31:09] together in one what one
[1:31:11] mystery all things in Christ right both
[1:31:16] which are in heaven and which are on
[1:31:18] earth even in him in whom also we have
[1:31:23] obtained
[1:31:24] an inheritance
[1:31:26] am what being predestinated according to
[1:31:29] the purpose of him who worketh all
[1:31:31] things after the counsel of his own will
[1:31:34] amen are the for knowledge of his word
[1:31:37] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:31:40] glory who first trusted in Christ L now
[1:31:43] 13 13- 14 Paul's going to sum it all up
[1:31:48] he's going to put this all together in
[1:31:51] whom you ye also Trust
[1:31:56] after I told him that word after after
[1:31:59] and if are two big words yeah if may be
[1:32:02] a little word but if is a very big word
[1:32:05] right if you
[1:32:07] believe if you have eternal life
[1:32:11] tonight that eternal life always was
[1:32:13] eternal amen
[1:32:15] if but if you don't then what you
[1:32:18] weren't right in whom ye also trusted
[1:32:21] what you had Faith trusted yeah if I
[1:32:24] trust Brother Gary I got faith in it in
[1:32:27] whom also you trusted after that you
[1:32:30] heard the word of truth right look in
[1:32:32] the book of Acts no one received the
[1:32:34] Holy Ghost without a message being
[1:32:35] preached to him there was a message
[1:32:38] preached the Holy Ghost
[1:32:39] fell after that you heard the word of
[1:32:42] Truth The Gospel of your salvation
[1:32:45] right in whom also there's that word
[1:32:48] again after Paul said come to those
[1:32:52] those Brethren and said that you receive
[1:32:54] the Holy Ghost since you
[1:32:56] believe also after that you believe you
[1:32:59] were sealed with that Holy Spirit of
[1:33:02] promise
[1:33:03] right which is the
[1:33:09] earnest of our inheritance right until
[1:33:15] the Redemption of the purchased
[1:33:17] possession amen unto the praise of his
[1:33:21] glory are his perfect will
[1:33:25] right Paul takes you to heaven shows you
[1:33:27] what the mind of God said showed us how
[1:33:29] it was going to happen to the shedding
[1:33:32] of the blood that we after that we heard
[1:33:35] the word of Truth after that we
[1:33:39] believed and then we receive an
[1:33:41] Earnest now if you put money down it's
[1:33:44] been explained before but listen to
[1:33:46] this if you take your earnest money and
[1:33:49] say you've got three payments which we
[1:33:52] got a lot more than that that's 30 years
[1:33:53] most of
[1:33:54] us but you take this earnest
[1:33:57] money and you go to the bank and the
[1:33:59] bank says there's no way you can have
[1:34:01] this loan without this earnest
[1:34:04] money but now after you put this earnest
[1:34:07] money
[1:34:08] down if you meet the requirements
[1:34:11] through your term of your loan the house
[1:34:13] is yours right though the earnest money
[1:34:16] be only a maybe
[1:34:19] 5%
[1:34:22] 10% and you get a $200,000 house that's
[1:34:27] $220,000 you say man that's only you
[1:34:29] know 10% of the of the purchase of the
[1:34:32] purchase price cuz the price is
[1:34:35] $200,000 but now which is more
[1:34:38] important the
[1:34:41] payments or the earning
[1:34:43] money if that Banker says you've got to
[1:34:46] put 20% or 10% down or you Ain got to
[1:34:50] worry about these payments right
[1:34:57] you got to make this first earnest money
[1:34:59] right here think it so which one's more
[1:35:02] important right earnest money or getting
[1:35:05] the full possession right it's it's more
[1:35:07] important or just as important as any of
[1:35:10] these payments that you make and if you
[1:35:12] make that earnest money you then are
[1:35:16] given a payment
[1:35:19] book and in God's economy brother Ram
[1:35:22] said God gives you a checkbook
[1:35:24] amen how do you pay for most of your
[1:35:27] payments most of us used to be by cash
[1:35:30] but they don't do that anymore they
[1:35:31] don't know what cash is
[1:35:33] anymore
[1:35:35] check
[1:35:36] check brother Brown said God gives you a
[1:35:39] check but with his name on it when you
[1:35:41] start but said when you get up to a
[1:35:43] certain part you know when you get up to
[1:35:44] a certain part you're paying a lot of
[1:35:47] interest but when you get toward the end
[1:35:49] of that loan you're paying a bundle of
[1:35:51] principal then
[1:35:54] then God finally he says hey I trust
[1:35:58] you here's you some blank ones yeah make
[1:36:02] the full payment
[1:36:04] right make the full payment right amen
[1:36:06] what is the full payment Body Spirit and
[1:36:09] soul Eternal GL not just walking around
[1:36:12] here with with with with um you know
[1:36:14] with troubles and trials and
[1:36:17] problems no it's knowing what God wants
[1:36:21] right knowing what God is and knowing
[1:36:24] what God is doing listen to this quote
[1:36:25] right here then we'll then we'll we'll
[1:36:29] kind of wrap it up Blasphemous names
[1:36:35] 1962 now let me read this one first cuz
[1:36:37] this this one's kind of cute Brother
[1:36:39] brownman spoken words Original Seed
[1:36:41] 1962 well that's the same thing from
[1:36:44] predestination you were supposed to be
[1:36:46] here in the right way at the beginning
[1:36:47] but being that you came the way you did
[1:36:50] you're subject to the fall right but
[1:36:52] being that you're predestinated and you
[1:36:53] hear the word and it brings you right
[1:36:55] back where you were predestinated right
[1:36:59] amen never saw that before amen right
[1:37:03] never saw that before brings you right
[1:37:06] and what makes you believe the word of
[1:37:07] God and turn down these other things is
[1:37:09] because there's something in you way
[1:37:11] back y you were supposed you what you
[1:37:13] may you are made to live here forever
[1:37:16] now Blasphemous names
[1:37:19] 1962 I believe there is a bride that's
[1:37:22] predestinated
[1:37:24] I believe God said he would have a
[1:37:25] church without spot or wrinkle I believe
[1:37:28] in predestination he didn't have a
[1:37:30] problem saying it then right he didn't
[1:37:33] say that wasn't a bad word to say he
[1:37:35] said I believe in predestination right
[1:37:37] that the bride is
[1:37:39] predestinated she's got to be there I
[1:37:42] hope I'm with her see I'm with her now
[1:37:45] it's up to me to work out my own
[1:37:47] salvation with God until these things
[1:37:50] are approved of God and then sealed into
[1:37:53] theing kingdom of God there's the Holy
[1:37:55] Spirit brother Donnie there's the
[1:37:58] genuine works of God it's sealed until
[1:38:00] the day of redemption that was her dream
[1:38:02] he's talking about the sister that had a
[1:38:03] dream the church is
[1:38:06] predestinated to be
[1:38:09] there right there's a bride there's
[1:38:12] going to be a bride right gu what God
[1:38:14] everybody said well well then it seems
[1:38:16] like it's stamped no there are certain
[1:38:17] things that God said he was going to
[1:38:19] have but that he purposed in his mind
[1:38:22] I'm going to have children right I'm
[1:38:24] going to have a
[1:38:25] bride I'm going to have a future home
[1:38:27] whatever's in this book right here that
[1:38:29] that through what what happened Moses
[1:38:32] picked up the mind of God then what did
[1:38:33] he do he wrote it in a book well who was
[1:38:36] it Moses writing it no Moses wasn't in
[1:38:39] the Garden of Eden who was in the Garden
[1:38:41] of Eden the one that was helping Moses
[1:38:43] right right he was just using Moses's
[1:38:46] hand right CU Moses wasn't in the Garden
[1:38:48] of Eden right but the one that was right
[1:38:50] in he had got into the what
[1:38:55] he got into the mind of the composer
[1:38:57] come
[1:38:58] on Amen and he and the composer became
[1:39:01] one right but now remember Moses That
[1:39:04] Couldn't reside and stay on Moses that
[1:39:06] had to come away from Moses and he was
[1:39:09] just a mortal man right but what about
[1:39:11] you and I come on folks we're supposed
[1:39:13] to be that that thing comes on us and
[1:39:15] stays in us not that it just and I know
[1:39:19] there's different anointings that we
[1:39:20] have but we're supposed to be the mind
[1:39:23] of God all the
[1:39:24] time now
[1:39:27] listen there's one other
[1:39:30] thing Jesus said in Matthew
[1:39:34] 28:18 he said all
[1:39:36] power in Heaven and
[1:39:38] Earth has been given to me like we
[1:39:41] talked about the other night this is
[1:39:43] what sparked his old thing we were
[1:39:44] talking about that me and brother dick I
[1:39:46] believe that we've got to come to that
[1:39:48] place Amen to where we stand not just
[1:39:51] not just say I believe what he said
[1:39:55] right we can't just believe what he said
[1:39:58] right we got to become what he said amen
[1:40:01] and when Jesus stood and said all power
[1:40:02] in heaven and earth been given unto
[1:40:04] me where's the power of death and Hell
[1:40:07] where's the power of anything all power
[1:40:11] has been given unto me both in heaven
[1:40:13] and on Earth glory and where is that man
[1:40:18] tonight he's in the heart of the
[1:40:20] Believers hallelujah amen that is what
[1:40:24] Satan can't understand he can't
[1:40:27] understand that even all down through
[1:40:29] those Church ages there was a group of
[1:40:31] people that come to an understanding of
[1:40:33] God and it looked like that God wasn't
[1:40:36] even with those people like in the
[1:40:37] fourth age look like God had done like
[1:40:39] the author said stood back with his arms
[1:40:41] folded but all those people had to come
[1:40:44] there had to be a falling away there had
[1:40:45] to be a dying off for the for the uh the
[1:40:48] sheeps to come back up and to get the
[1:40:49] grain back out but let's one more thing
[1:40:53] let me see for my
[1:40:55] book we'll be
[1:41:01] done this little message called the word
[1:41:03] became flesh in India trip now brother
[1:41:05] Joe you don't have these this is 1954
[1:41:08] brother brandom just got back from India
[1:41:11] October the 3rd
[1:41:12] 1954 and he's speaking about the India
[1:41:15] trip and then he preached a little
[1:41:16] message because of the word becoming
[1:41:18] flesh this is
[1:41:20] 1954
[1:41:21] right page 26 paragraph 124 and every
[1:41:26] word in the Bible is God's thought laid
[1:41:28] in seed form that if received into the
[1:41:32] human being and spoke by the same
[1:41:35] thought that materialized the Bible
[1:41:38] brings the thing to pass right thank
[1:41:41] you amen hard to swallow
[1:41:46] amen let me read that one more time how
[1:41:48] big does it make you
[1:41:51] not and every word word in the Bible is
[1:41:54] God's thoughts laid in seed form that if
[1:41:58] received into the human being and spoke
[1:42:02] by the same thought that materialized
[1:42:04] the Bible brings the thing to pass
[1:42:08] Glory that's the speaking of the word
[1:42:12] right see what I mean how powerful could
[1:42:15] the church be this is 1954 right
[1:42:20] right the Bible said let this mind that
[1:42:22] was in Christ be in you as a man
[1:42:25] thinking in think in his heart so is he
[1:42:28] now your thoughts if they become
[1:42:30] expression like God said let there be a
[1:42:34] world before it could be a word it had
[1:42:36] to be a thought right so God in the
[1:42:39] creation created the world by his
[1:42:43] thought
[1:42:45] first then he spoke it right right and
[1:42:49] the thought
[1:42:51] expressed became material
[1:42:54] see what I
[1:42:56] mean now he didn't stop there listen to
[1:43:00] this now if that same spirit that said
[1:43:03] let there be
[1:43:04] light and there was
[1:43:07] light that said let there be trees and
[1:43:09] there was trees and if that if that same
[1:43:13] mind that was in Christ be in you oh how
[1:43:16] much could it say let there be no cancer
[1:43:20] oh my and it would be gone come on GL
[1:43:24] let the blind eyes be opened yes and it
[1:43:27] would be so
[1:43:32] right so it's your thought Jesus said
[1:43:36] verily you said that was Jesus but wait
[1:43:38] a minute he said have faith in God for
[1:43:40] ver verily I say unto you if you shall
[1:43:43] say to this mountain right be moved and
[1:43:47] plucked and cast into the sea and don't
[1:43:48] doubt in your heart but believe what you
[1:43:50] say it'll come to pass
[1:43:54] you'll have whatever things thou sayest
[1:43:56] is that right you shall have it not me
[1:43:59] you shall have it what power has been
[1:44:01] given to the church now you can express
[1:44:04] it by mental conception that's right
[1:44:07] read
[1:44:09] right or you can quote it
[1:44:14] right listen to this I'm going to read
[1:44:17] it
[1:44:18] slow but if let me read the the sentence
[1:44:21] over again now you can EXP express it by
[1:44:24] mental conception
[1:44:26] period but if it becomes a real
[1:44:28] revelation of God
[1:44:30] glory that you see it before it happened
[1:44:36] yeah and express it in word form come on
[1:44:40] that word takes a hold oh my and becomes
[1:44:45] material come on think about it a
[1:44:49] thought expressed right if your heart
[1:44:52] and your mind mind is so filled with
[1:44:54] God's spirit until your thoughts become
[1:44:56] his thoughts amen there you are when
[1:45:00] your mind and your leading and your
[1:45:02] guiding becomes a direct place or a
[1:45:05] direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:45:08] that's moving your mortal being oh my
[1:45:12] what kind of people should we be if the
[1:45:15] very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or
[1:45:18] empowered that you don't use your own
[1:45:21] thoughts oh thank you Lord you don't use
[1:45:23] your own mind you don't use your own
[1:45:26] opinions but the Holy Spirit as you so
[1:45:29] build until your thoughts and your being
[1:45:32] is God's spirit expressing itself
[1:45:36] through you what kind of a church would
[1:45:40] we
[1:45:42] be paragraph 131 I'm not finished it's
[1:45:45] get get it's good and they that are sons
[1:45:48] of God are led by the spirit of God then
[1:45:50] when the human element goes out
[1:45:53] and the spirit of God fills that vacancy
[1:45:56] where you empty yourself
[1:45:59] amen then will be when the church in its
[1:46:02] power of the resurrection of the Lord
[1:46:04] Jesus will walk in his steps in his
[1:46:08] power in his thoughts in his being in
[1:46:12] his moving you see what I mean then your
[1:46:16] thoughts then your thoughts will become
[1:46:19] words right and words will become
[1:46:23] material amen look how many times he
[1:46:25] said that I believe it's on its road
[1:46:29] that when the church will be so wrapped
[1:46:30] in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so
[1:46:34] away from theirselves that they don't
[1:46:36] see themselves they don't have no Blank
[1:46:39] Spot on tape but to serve God and their
[1:46:41] thoughts move on they refuse the things
[1:46:44] of the world they just move in the
[1:46:46] spirit live in the spirit move in the
[1:46:49] spirit walk in the spirit so fulfill the
[1:46:52] law of Christ
[1:46:54] then the love of Christ in the human
[1:46:56] heart moving in the Holy Ghost that
[1:46:59] great wonderful church will go forth
[1:47:02] with power and deity
[1:47:07] amen because deity will be revealed in
[1:47:10] human beings amen but by the Holy Spirit
[1:47:14] bringing to pass the thoughts of their
[1:47:18] mind right let's stand
[1:47:24] he said our thoughts run different right
[1:47:28] A lot of times we walk up and say how do
[1:47:30] you do brother and you don't mean it in
[1:47:31] your heart and a lot of times we say I'm
[1:47:33] this and I'm that you don't mean that in
[1:47:34] your heart I don't mean it in my in my
[1:47:37] heart but when you can become so dead to
[1:47:39] the things of the world that Christ is
[1:47:40] first Christ is all that your entire
[1:47:43] makeup is of the spirit of the Lord
[1:47:44] Jesus Christ he has full control that's
[1:47:47] when your thoughts will be clean your
[1:47:49] thoughts will be pure your heart your
[1:47:52] heart
[1:47:54] and you know what brought all this
[1:47:56] on let me tell you what brought all this
[1:48:00] on cuz you get over to the end of the
[1:48:03] book and brother Brenham is
[1:48:07] praying he said
[1:48:09] Lord page 40 and I recognized the other
[1:48:13] day a selfish Spirit coming up in me oh
[1:48:19] my of saying this man's wrong I ought to
[1:48:22] tell him about it that's
[1:48:24] wrong God is the one to tell him about
[1:48:27] it it's none of my business but my
[1:48:30] business is to preach the gospel and
[1:48:31] love everybody and move on and love my
[1:48:34] enemies as Jesus Christ loved me when I
[1:48:36] was his enemy that's right when I was
[1:48:39] unlovable he loved me to his bosom and
[1:48:41] anybody that's unlovely let me love him
[1:48:44] the same let the spirit that was in
[1:48:46] Christ be in us I love him I love him
[1:48:49] and there several times in this book
[1:48:52] that when he got back from
[1:48:54] India a saving is to the last a
[1:48:57] prophet so so reading this word that I
[1:49:01] just read to you how gripping that was
[1:49:03] to me yes and he says all that came
[1:49:06] about because I had a selfish Spirit
[1:49:09] coming upon me and I was critical about
[1:49:11] about people yeah that's why he was
[1:49:14] coming I believe he was preaching the
[1:49:16] gospel and he was actually asking God
[1:49:19] said look that was in my mind so I I
[1:49:22] want that out of my mind s Gil I want
[1:49:25] this spirit that I've been reading you
[1:49:29] where so much of God is in my mind that
[1:49:32] I don't have a problem with somebody
[1:49:34] right that I don't have somebody's wrong
[1:49:36] brother R said if they're wrong let God
[1:49:38] deal with them but he had a selfish
[1:49:40] Spirit on him is what caused him really
[1:49:43] if you'll read this whole book it's a
[1:49:44] good book word become flesh in India
[1:49:46] trip 1954 read that book that's where
[1:49:49] these Quotes come
[1:49:51] from he want want the mind of Christ
[1:49:53] that's what I wrote here cuz that's what
[1:49:54] he wanted he said God I want your mind I
[1:49:56] don't want my
[1:49:58] selfish attitude my selfish spirit that
[1:50:02] I'm so selfish that I can't love my
[1:50:03] brothers right
[1:50:06] amen all power in Heaven and Earth has
[1:50:10] been given unto
[1:50:12] me and where did he give that power to I
[1:50:15] thought on the day of Pentecost he give
[1:50:18] it to the
[1:50:19] people the will sin is Will
[1:50:22] [Music]
[1:50:24] this wh and now guess what I'm
[1:50:27] bullheaded I'm bullheaded to the gospel
[1:50:31] want to be more bullheaded to the gospel
[1:50:33] but I don't want to be so have a so
[1:50:35] selfish Spirit though that I'm arrogant
[1:50:37] about it's like brother dick when I was
[1:50:38] reading that on the plane I was like

[1:50:51] he's at
[1:50:53] if he shows you where he's at then he's
[1:50:54] got enough Grace to get you to where

[1:56:20] flesh this thing right here is got to
[1:56:22] put Flesh on it right without putting

[1:56:28] condemnation cuz it's going to be laid
[1:56:30] before us right if we're not in

[1:57:10] was blinding her that's what God wants
[1:57:13] cuz Satan is blinded us to this exactly

[1:57:22] Satan can't stand this mystery of
[1:57:26] predestination cuz he can't become a
