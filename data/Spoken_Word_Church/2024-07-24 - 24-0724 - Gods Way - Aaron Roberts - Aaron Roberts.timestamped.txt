[7:41] one says then job answered and
[7:44] said even today is my complaint bitter
[7:47] my stroke is heavier than my groaning oh
[7:50] that I knew where I might find him that
[7:53] I might come even to his seat I would or
[7:56] order my cause before him and fill my
[7:59] mouth with
[8:00] arguments I would know the words which
[8:03] he would answer me and understand what
[8:06] he would say unto me will he plead
[8:08] against me with his great power no he
[8:12] would put strength in me amen there the
[8:15] righteous might dispute with him so
[8:18] should I be delivered forever from my
[8:21] judge behold I go forward but he is not
[8:24] there and backward but I cannot perceive
[8:27] him on the left hand where he doth work
[8:30] but I cannot Behold Him He hideth
[8:32] himself on the right hand that I cannot
[8:34] see him but he knoweth the way that I
[8:37] take when he hath tried me I shall come
[8:39] forth as gold my H my foot hath held his
[8:43] steps his way have I kept and not
[8:47] declined neither have I gone back from
[8:49] the Commandments of his lips I have
[8:51] esteemed the words of his mouth more
[8:54] than my necessary food amen God bless
[8:57] you this evening you can be seated I
[8:59] want take a little thought tonight
[9:02] and try not to be lengthy but I want to
[9:06] think just take this little thought
[9:07] God's
[9:08] way and
[9:11] uh you
[9:13] know Jesus said in in John chapter 14
[9:18] you know Jesus said I am the way the
[9:20] truth and the life no man comes to the
[9:23] father but by
[9:24] me and the
[9:26] message
[9:28] identification Christ of all
[9:30] ages brother R says a man he knows he
[9:34] comes from the Beyond and a dark shadowy
[9:37] curtain that hangs between him and where
[9:39] he was before he comes here and he knows
[9:42] he must go behind that curtain and he
[9:44] has always wanting to know where he come
[9:46] from and what he is and where he's going
[9:49] he said we have millions of volumes
[9:51] that's been wrot I suppose on the
[9:53] subject but there is only one book and
[9:56] that's 66 volumes in itself that can
[9:59] tell you where you come from who you are
[10:03] where you're going and that is this
[10:05] Bible it's the word that tells you where
[10:07] you come from who you are and where
[10:09] you're
[10:11] going and uh I I just want to take a
[10:13] little thought and just look at a few
[10:16] things tonight but um you know God has
[10:20] given us his word to lead us and you
[10:24] know when when we realize that where we
[10:26] come from and you know as brother
[10:30] brandham said before God was God you
[10:32] know he was eternal he was Elohim you
[10:34] know he dealt dwelt alone with all of
[10:37] his attributes and he had all this that
[10:39] he wanted to express he wanted to
[10:41] express his word and you know he began
[10:43] to condescend and began to express these
[10:46] things and said let there be and be to
[10:48] create all these things everything that
[10:50] he he
[10:51] created that was in his mind everything
[10:54] that came was created and it was created
[10:57] in the way that he wanted it to come
[11:00] everything came in a divine order and
[11:03] there was a there was a process that he
[11:05] had and he began to speak and he had
[11:06] these great thoughts and he began to lay
[11:08] all these things out and he thought of
[11:10] you and I and he knew that because we
[11:12] were a part of him and brother BR said
[11:14] that's the reason that we were chosen in
[11:16] him before the foundation of the world
[11:18] because we were in his thinking we were
[11:20] a part of God and so we we were a part
[11:23] of that he said that great Master
[11:26] intelligence that began to set
[11:27] everything in a divine order everything
[11:29] came into existence is set in in the
[11:31] right way and there's you know when you
[11:33] look at the when brother R was talking
[11:35] about the moon and the stars and the
[11:37] solar system and you look at all the
[11:38] things that are in in set in order and
[11:40] you look at this the vast solar systems
[11:44] and galaxies and everything how
[11:46] everything works and you know you know
[11:48] man has tried to build a clock and tried
[11:50] to come up with a way that they could
[11:52] keep time and you know God set a solar
[11:54] system just by speaking it because it
[11:57] was his thoughts he set everything in
[11:58] motion and even today we go back and
[12:00] look through history and we can see how
[12:02] the Stars the planets line up we know
[12:05] when these things took place what
[12:06] happened all of these things and it was
[12:09] just because God had all this in his
[12:12] plan he set it all up and we're still
[12:14] using that today because we can see how
[12:16] all these things take place and know
[12:17] what's going to come in the future by
[12:20] because it works such a such has such
[12:23] order to it that everything works
[12:25] exactly and nothing's out of cater and
[12:27] it all works the same and you know it's
[12:29] amazing and then we see these great
[12:31] great men have great intelligence they
[12:34] they spend their life studying these
[12:36] things and looking through great
[12:38] telescopes and understanding all these
[12:40] things that are uh way over my head but
[12:43] you know you you think of all this and
[12:45] they look at all these things and say
[12:46] there is no God there is there is no God
[12:49] and you know brother BR said that a man
[12:51] walk over a blade of grass and not
[12:53] understand where it come from or how it
[12:54] came into being and and all these things
[12:56] and not realize it was a creator that
[12:58] set all these things in motion and
[13:00] created us and set us where we are today
[13:03] and had all this thing and set up in a
[13:05] in a divine order and everything works
[13:07] just the way God wants it to there's
[13:09] nothing out of cater but sometimes we
[13:11] realize that you know when God created
[13:14] man and he created man in his own image
[13:17] when all of these things were set in
[13:18] order and when he began to create all
[13:20] these things when it come into that
[13:22] divine order you know God set you as
[13:26] created Adam and Eve set them in the
[13:28] garden and gave them dominion over the
[13:31] over the Earth and all those things that
[13:33] he said because he said well let us make
[13:35] man in our own image and after our
[13:37] likeness and he had dominion over all
[13:39] the over everything he was able to speak
[13:42] and do what he wanted to with it because
[13:43] he had control of it and God had given
[13:46] him this power had do it because he was
[13:49] the son of God and he set all these
[13:51] things in motion for for a for a reason
[13:54] for to express himself and if we
[13:57] understand that God said all these
[13:58] things in motion and said from the
[14:01] beginning everything came in a divine
[14:03] order and we realize that it's still the
[14:05] the order is still there amen God's
[14:08] still in control as we were talking
[14:09] about last time everything still work
[14:11] just the way God set it up
[14:14] and because you know God didn't lose
[14:18] control of anything and if he and if he
[14:20] set anything in order and it said has
[14:24] power and this order has been started
[14:26] then when as Paul says here in Romans 8
[14:29] you know he says who can separate us
[14:31] from the love of God because if God set
[14:33] this in order and as we look at at
[14:36] through the scriptures here he says so
[14:38] tribulation or distress persecution or
[14:40] famine or nakedness or Peril or sword he
[14:44] said that is written if for thy sake we
[14:45] are killed all the day long we are
[14:47] counted as sheep for the slaughter he
[14:48] said nay in all things we are made more
[14:51] than conquerors through him that loved
[14:53] us he said for I am persuaded that
[14:55] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[14:57] principalities nor powers nor things
[14:59] present nor things to come nor height
[15:01] nor death nor any other creature shall
[15:03] be able to separate us from the love of
[15:05] God which is in Christ Jesus our lord so
[15:08] we realize that when God set all these
[15:10] things in in motion and he set
[15:13] everything in order and he gave man
[15:15] dominion over the over the Earth and
[15:17] everything that was upon the Earth and
[15:19] and had dominion over could rule it
[15:20] because that's what God wanted to have
[15:22] he wanted to have someone that could
[15:24] have dominion that he could work through
[15:26] that had control and he gave it and he
[15:29] gave it to Adam and we know that
[15:31] when when he set Adam and Eve out there
[15:33] he he knew what was going to take place
[15:35] but you know he was he was so gracious
[15:37] because he put them on free moral agency
[15:39] and allowed them to do what they wanted
[15:40] to do and give them the opportunity but
[15:43] he knew what was going to take
[15:44] place so when he when he allowed that to
[15:47] take place he knew what was going to
[15:48] take place and he knew that the fall was
[15:50] going to take place because he knew that
[15:53] when Eve began to listen to the Ser
[15:56] Serpent's sermon when when he began to
[15:59] have fellowship with the serpent she was
[16:02] going to take the word that was not
[16:04] right she was going to take a word that
[16:06] was not right when she had had when she
[16:09] had heard the word and she everything
[16:12] was in in divine order everything was in
[16:15] Divine motion and everything was just
[16:17] perfect and then when she began to hear
[16:19] something what God had already told them
[16:21] listen don't partake of that because in
[16:23] that is death that will that will not
[16:25] take you to anything but death it will
[16:27] take you exactly out of the place that
[16:29] you're in right now it would it would
[16:31] take you right out of the garden
[16:33] everything would be in
[16:35] chaos but all of a sudden she wanted to
[16:38] be she wanted to hear something that
[16:40] that she thought might put her closer
[16:42] but she didn't realize she was in the
[16:44] place that God wanted her to be she was
[16:46] in the place that God wanted her to be
[16:48] and she began to listen to The Serpent's
[16:51] word you know as he began to speak to
[16:53] her oh you know if if you'll be just
[16:55] like God if you'll just listen to this
[16:57] how wonderful it is and and she began to
[16:59] listen to this and she bought his
[17:03] lie and she committed an
[17:07] act and here was Adam that took part of
[17:10] the same thing right and turned his back
[17:13] on God and walked right out of the
[17:14] garden God put him
[17:16] out but you know he L he loved Eve but
[17:19] you know you know they they God knew
[17:21] what was going to take place but they
[17:23] walked away from the word they turned
[17:24] their back on
[17:26] him and you know it's the same way with
[17:28] you and I God has given us his word but
[17:30] you know it takes the same thing is that
[17:33] we have to take What God Says whether we
[17:36] like it or not whether fit you know and
[17:39] you know they here they are and they go
[17:41] through this and as one of the brothers
[17:43] was speaking you know talking about um
[17:46] Cain and Abel and you know here they are
[17:48] God began to speak to them outside the
[17:50] garden and here it was when they begin
[17:52] to talk about what was going to take
[17:53] place brother Wade was talking about
[17:55] that you know when you're talking about
[17:56] what took place and understanding what
[17:58] their re reation was when God gave Cain
[18:02] the opportunity when Abel had a
[18:05] revelation from god of what it was going
[18:07] to require and he went out and had done
[18:09] exactly what paid the made the sacrifice
[18:11] exactly what God had told him to do and
[18:13] he walked right out there and no doubt
[18:16] Cain had had to heard the same message
[18:18] preached to him had the same
[18:20] understanding but when God came to and
[18:22] stand in front of Cain and began to
[18:25] speak to him and and you know direct me
[18:28] message directly to Cain and told him
[18:30] listen you don't have to have a
[18:32] revelation but the one thing that's
[18:33] going to require that's going to be
[18:34] required of you more than anything is
[18:36] you're going to have to have obedience
[18:39] and it's what's required if you're going
[18:40] to have to obey the word that's what it
[18:43] takes full obedience what brother R say
[18:46] full obedience to the word entitles you
[18:49] to the Token it takes a full obedience
[18:52] to the word and exactly what but what
[18:54] did he do he turned it down he had his
[18:57] opportunity God not God's not an Indian
[19:00] giver God God's not a Shyer God's God's
[19:03] not some trickster but he gave everybody
[19:05] the opportunity but somewhere along the
[19:07] way you're going to turn God down
[19:09] because as as brother Wade was speaking
[19:11] you know God God was meant to speak to
[19:15] can and made it made the opportunity
[19:17] give him the offer but he's the one that
[19:19] turned it down and he's the one that
[19:21] walked away from God but God give him
[19:23] the opportunity uh to make it make his
[19:26] way known and then after the fall and we
[19:28] know how all how all these things took
[19:30] place and and Cain walked away and man
[19:33] began to seek the face of God but you
[19:35] know in in course of time you know we
[19:37] know that uh Man became more wicked and
[19:40] all the things that took place in the
[19:41] earth but you know there was always God
[19:44] was always reaching out to man he was
[19:46] always trying to find a way to back to
[19:49] to bring man back into fellowship and
[19:51] you know when when the Wicked Rose up
[19:53] and how the Earth got so wicked that God
[19:55] couldn't even stand the Earth but you
[19:57] know what he brought a message to man
[19:58] named Noah and he began to speak to Noah
[20:01] and tell him listen I'm going to give
[20:03] you a message to the people because
[20:06] listen there is there is a message of
[20:08] mercy and grace to the people listen
[20:10] because you know what it's not going to
[20:11] stand the way it is right now it can't
[20:13] stand the way it is right now but I'm
[20:15] going to tell you there's a way
[20:16] out because listen there's there's a
[20:18] judgment coming there is death coming
[20:21] but there's a way out amen and we see
[20:24] all the way down through history God
[20:25] always making a way was always making a
[20:27] a call to the people to try to bring
[20:29] them through but there was only a
[20:31] predestinated group that actually
[20:33] listened to the message actually came
[20:34] through that but you know God always
[20:36] made a call and you know he all the time
[20:39] making all the way through as he as the
[20:41] scripture tells us he always sent the
[20:43] prophets to the people and he began to
[20:45] speak to them and show him he began to
[20:47] make himself known through the prophets
[20:49] and through the through the word began
[20:50] to speak to the people and began to UND
[20:53] let man know who he was and and show all
[20:55] these things but you know they were the
[20:57] ones that turned him down and only only
[20:59] a group a certain group caught those
[21:01] things that God had spoken to them but
[21:03] there were so many that walked right
[21:05] past that and did not because it did not
[21:08] tickle their fancy it was not it was not
[21:10] in the way they expected it to come it
[21:12] didn't it didn't meet their status quo
[21:14] but it was still God speaking to them
[21:16] and making himself known to them and and
[21:19] you have to you know God brings you to a
[21:22] place where you have to realize it's God
[21:23] speaking to you it's God's word to
[21:26] you because you come to a place you've
[21:28] got you got to face it full on fa and
[21:31] you got to come realize hey this is God
[21:32] speaking to
[21:35] me and and because as you know even when
[21:38] speaking of the the Rich Young Ruler
[21:39] when he realized who Jesus was and he
[21:41] stood there and he spoke to him good
[21:43] Master what do I have to do to inherit
[21:45] eternal life see he knew who Jesus
[21:47] Christ was when he stood there and began
[21:50] to speak to him and Jesus loved him and
[21:54] Jesus began to speak to him exactly what
[21:56] he had need of in his in that moment
[21:58] moment he knew what he had to do there
[22:00] was there was a requirement made before
[22:02] him and all he had to do is accept it
[22:05] but he turned it
[22:07] down and all the way down through
[22:09] history God was all the time wanting to
[22:10] make himself known and and deliver the
[22:13] people and show himself but you know
[22:15] they were the ones that turned him down
[22:17] but he continued and continued to show
[22:20] himself and you know he began to in the
[22:23] garden you know he made the
[22:25] promise that a deliverer would come
[22:27] there would be one
[22:30] that would crush the Serpent's head that
[22:33] would bring bring man back into
[22:35] fellowship and all the way through we
[22:37] see how all these things took place and
[22:40] but you know there was a a a battle that
[22:42] took place we always know there was a
[22:43] battle between Satan and and God all the
[22:46] way down through history Satan has
[22:48] always been fighting the plan of God all
[22:50] the way from the beginning but you know
[22:51] he came but in the in the course of time
[22:54] we know that Jesus Christ came in the
[22:56] fullness of the word that was spoken
[22:58] Spen of him all the way down through
[23:00] history we know that he's the word that
[23:02] was spoken of by the prophets the
[23:04] prophecies that were made he began to
[23:05] walk and he began to show the people
[23:08] exactly what was prophesied of him and
[23:09] what was going to take place because he
[23:11] pointed them back to the scripture and
[23:13] he said search the scriptures in them
[23:15] you think you have eternal life but they
[23:17] are they that testify of me so he began
[23:19] to point the people right back to the
[23:21] scripture to show them the day and hour
[23:23] which they were living that's right and
[23:25] he began to show them and he and he
[23:27] began to tell them listen of all the
[23:29] things that have taken place in the past
[23:32] when he began to speak of the the
[23:34] prophecies that were made in the Old
[23:35] Testament there were lots of prophecies
[23:37] that nobody understood but Jesus came
[23:40] and he began through his life and even
[23:41] in his ministry began to point them back
[23:43] to the scriptures and the Old Testament
[23:45] and began to bring them forth into the
[23:47] present day and showing them these are
[23:49] the scriptures that were spoken of and
[23:51] this is the day and hour which they live
[23:53] that's right and he when he began to
[23:55] speak the word and he began to identify
[23:57] the day in which they they were living
[23:59] then that it began to show them what was
[24:01] taking place there was only a group that
[24:03] that would only a certain group that
[24:05] would take that and there was many
[24:07] people that he began to speak to even
[24:09] when Nicodemus came to
[24:12] him came to him by night and he said you
[24:15] know we know you're a teacher sent from
[24:17] God because nobody can do these things
[24:18] unless God be with him he began to
[24:20] identify the
[24:22] scripture but you know what Nicodemus
[24:24] didn't take all the word that God that
[24:27] Jesus had presented to him
[24:29] right why because he he understood where
[24:32] he was standing but you know what he
[24:33] didn't he didn't follow it all the way
[24:34] through
[24:36] am because if he actually had sold out
[24:38] and actually believed he should have
[24:39] been on the day of
[24:41] Pentecost he should have continued all
[24:43] the way
[24:44] through but see God made a promise that
[24:47] what was going to take place that there
[24:48] was a judgment
[24:49] coming and there was a way to bypass
[24:52] that judgment there was a way made and
[24:55] he came into the scripture that to show
[24:57] them how they were going to be the
[24:58] Fulfillment of all the scripture that
[25:00] had been had been spoken of and he began
[25:03] to teach the the disciples and and the
[25:06] ones that were following him he began to
[25:08] teach them the word and he began to show
[25:09] them all these things that God wanted
[25:12] them to know what the scripture had
[25:13] spoken of them or what of the day in
[25:15] which they would live of what what would
[25:17] take place and not just some idea but
[25:19] you know and and because you know when
[25:22] you look at it there was so many that
[25:24] didn't didn't believe it because you
[25:25] know it didn't didn't come the way they
[25:27] wanted it to but you know what it come
[25:29] to the to the humble believer it come to
[25:32] the lowly the the ones that just took it
[25:34] by simple childlike Faith because it
[25:37] wasn't it wasn't who they were it was
[25:39] who God was it was who God spoke to them
[25:42] because when you look at at Peter and
[25:44] them being ignorant and unlearned and
[25:46] you know what they didn't have anything
[25:48] that would match anything that that
[25:50] would that would Merit any of God's
[25:52] grace but you know what God spoke to
[25:54] them why because he knew that they would
[25:55] receive it they would believe what God
[25:57] told them
[26:00] yeah and we know that you know in the in
[26:03] the time as he began to speak these
[26:05] things and he told him listen he said
[26:08] Terry when he when he when he told him
[26:10] that he was going to die and he rose
[26:12] again he told him he said listen Terry
[26:14] in Jerusalem till you be endued with
[26:15] power from on high amen why because he
[26:18] told him he said listen he said I got to
[26:19] go away but the comforter will come unto
[26:21] you and said and he will teach you these
[26:23] things and what was going to take place
[26:25] in the future and all of a sudden you
[26:27] know the a lot of the confusion and the
[26:29] doubt and and all these things that they
[26:30] had to go through in their life and they
[26:32] didn't understand all these situations
[26:34] and why things took place but you know
[26:35] what when the Holy Ghost came there was
[26:37] a there was a boldness there was there
[26:38] was a knowledge that came to them that
[26:40] quickened the word to them and they they
[26:42] understood what was going to take place
[26:45] they knew what they were going to take
[26:46] place when when when Peter walked out
[26:49] there you know he he knew that listen
[26:51] Jesus gave his life for us here he is
[26:55] dying and because he's fulfilling the
[26:57] scripture you know what and and if he
[26:59] would if they would do that to him if he
[27:01] would lay down his life and that's what
[27:03] he would have to face then you know we
[27:05] may have to face the exact same thing
[27:07] but you know what they had
[27:08] boldness they they they counted to All
[27:11] Joy when they had to go and face the
[27:14] persecution and the and the death
[27:16] threats and the bodily harm they thought
[27:19] it was a great rejoicing because what
[27:21] God had done for them that was a small a
[27:23] small price to pay for what God had done
[27:25] for them and you know they listen I
[27:27] counted all joy when I fall into diverse
[27:29] Temptations when I fall into all these
[27:31] problems and everything like that I
[27:32] thank God for that why because God is
[27:34] making something out of me it's
[27:36] something that if just like we were
[27:38] reading here in job when when he began
[27:40] to speak of job and you know all these
[27:42] things when when he saw that job was a
[27:44] great man a godly man that he would
[27:47] stand these things that he could stand
[27:48] the the pressure and the testing that he
[27:50] went through and you know we understand
[27:52] that every child as brother R was
[27:55] talking about every child of the faith
[27:57] has to go through that same Journey
[27:59] still has to walk that same road has to
[28:01] go through the same trials and
[28:02] tribulations why it's going to bring you
[28:04] into the fullness of Christ into the
[28:06] measure of Christ he wants to bring you
[28:08] into the place where you're more like
[28:10] him and everybody's got to go through
[28:12] that testing and trials and and you know
[28:14] and he was talking about brother BR was
[28:16] talking about how how your uh in the Old
[28:19] Testament how they had tutors to bring
[28:21] them up and rais them up to be the right
[28:23] kind of son to bring them into the place
[28:26] and you know you know the father there
[28:29] in the Old Testament you know he want to
[28:30] find the right kind of tutor he that
[28:33] would that would mold that son into the
[28:36] image of the father what the father was
[28:38] would expect what the father would be
[28:41] proud of what he would honor that's the
[28:43] kind of tutor that he he just wouldn't
[28:45] get some anybody any fly by night or
[28:47] anything like that but he wanted
[28:48] somebody that could actually mow that
[28:50] stun into the right kind of person and
[28:53] you know and they and so it was you know
[28:55] they had to bring him up and you know
[28:56] there was a lots of times where you know
[28:58] it's a lot of difficulty and painful
[29:01] experiences and and struggles and
[29:03] heartaches but you know what it was
[29:04] bringing that son up to be into the
[29:07] place because if his father wanted
[29:09] somebody that could step into the place
[29:11] where he was at and and do the and do
[29:13] the father's business and be in the same
[29:15] place as his
[29:20] father and how it is with
[29:24] us brother Brown said that we had
[29:26] received the Holy Ghost the tutor the
[29:28] right kind of tutor in our lives to
[29:30] bring us to this place because we go
[29:32] through the same thing because he brings
[29:35] us on this journey it comes through
[29:37] justification sanctification the baptism
[29:40] of the Holy Ghost but it it brings us
[29:41] the tutor in our life to bring us to the
[29:43] same thing to go through those same
[29:45] Journey the same walk that they had to
[29:47] go through bring us to the same place
[29:49] that we can be worthy amen of the life
[29:53] that Jesus lived that it's no longer us
[29:57] living but he said said it's him am it's
[30:00] no longer I but Christ Living in me amen
[30:03] and how we go through these these hard
[30:05] times and and difficulties and all these
[30:07] things but you know it's God bringing us
[30:09] through and it's you know because he
[30:10] knows what we need and what it's going
[30:12] to take to bring us to the right kind of
[30:14] place and you know all the all the
[30:19] the lessons that we have to go through
[30:21] we all don't have to face the same thing
[30:23] but it brings us to the same place it
[30:25] brings us closer to God
[30:28] and so you know we as we work through
[30:30] these things see it's the Holy Ghost
[30:32] brother said it's the Holy Ghost to
[30:34] raise the church and and to nurture it
[30:36] and honor and respect to the father in
[30:38] his word he said what a son grows got
[30:42] now God I'm say what a son God's got now
[30:45] he said but we've we've but we've
[30:47] adopted some men and their Theology and
[30:50] some of their man-made Creeds and you
[30:52] see where it's put it he said you holler
[30:54] about Sin and about communist are
[30:56] churches that are polluted he said pot
[30:58] can't call the kettle black it's exactly
[31:00] right he said I know that's oldfashioned
[31:02] preaching but it'll save you it'll make
[31:05] you
[31:06] different see they they go back and
[31:08] because they don't want to hold to what
[31:10] God brought you know he's bringing them
[31:12] to a place then you know brother R was
[31:14] talking about you know you preach on
[31:15] something and you try to show people the
[31:17] truth and he said you know they you
[31:19] preach on something he talk about the
[31:21] about the way they act and they're the
[31:22] way they're dressed and all these things
[31:24] and he said I come back the next year
[31:25] and it's worse the next year than it was
[31:27] before and it's just continuing on and
[31:29] on but you know there was a certain
[31:31] group of people that was going to catch
[31:33] that they were going to go and they were
[31:34] going to understand that was the word
[31:36] for their day they were they saw the
[31:37] light and you know it was for them it's
[31:39] not for everybody because you know you
[31:41] begin to speak to people and you begin
[31:43] to talk to people about the word and you
[31:45] know when when people bring things up
[31:47] and you begin to show people and you
[31:48] begin to just show just a little bit of
[31:50] things in the scripture and and you you
[31:52] know just pull a little bit out and you
[31:54] want to show people things and you know
[31:56] and you can just see how
[31:58] because people well they don't mind
[32:00] reading the Bible and they and they
[32:02] don't mind going to church but all of a
[32:05] sudden you start bringing things out
[32:06] because as soon as you bring things out
[32:09] that start showing where they're at and
[32:12] all of a sudden you because when you
[32:14] start to show them the truth of the word
[32:17] and it's like well you know I don't I
[32:19] don't try to condemn people but I'm but
[32:21] I don't mind telling you why I believe
[32:23] what I
[32:24] believe and I'm going to tell you why
[32:26] why I believe what you know and it's
[32:27] it's not to put anybody down but I'm
[32:29] going to show you this is this is what
[32:31] the Bible says and this is why we
[32:33] believe it amen because you know in the
[32:36] in the scripture you know I I was I was
[32:38] listening to these men talk the other
[32:40] day it was a little thing on on
[32:43] uh I think it was on Facebook but I'm
[32:45] sure but anyway you know they were
[32:46] showing this little clip and you they
[32:47] were talking about how way back went
[32:51] even even people today I mean they
[32:53] understand when you when when you look
[32:55] back people understand that the petarian
[32:58] Doctrine didn't come into like the the
[33:00] 4th century and there was and nobody
[33:02] nobody in the in the in the early church
[33:05] when in the time of the disciples in the
[33:07] time of the Apostles nobody believed in
[33:09] that Doctrine that's right abely and he
[33:13] was talking he was talking about he they
[33:15] were they were Pentecostals he said you
[33:17] know he said you know that everybody
[33:19] that wrote the uh anybody that wrote
[33:21] anything in the New Testament was a
[33:24] Pentecostal they come from Pentecost
[33:27] they had a p costal
[33:29] experience and so when they began to
[33:31] write the scripture they didn't have any
[33:33] of that stuff when you trace it back and
[33:36] and and the one man was a was a
[33:37] trinitarian and he was talking about how
[33:40] when you look at the word they didn't
[33:42] even have any of that till the fourth
[33:44] century and it's like well how in the
[33:46] world if if if that's what Paul wrote if
[33:49] that's what Peter wrote if that's what
[33:51] James and Jude and all them when he told
[33:53] him he said contend for the faith that
[33:55] was once delivered to the Saints then
[33:57] how in the world are you following
[33:58] something that's contrary to the
[34:01] scripture when you're standing there and
[34:04] knowing that this wasn't anything the
[34:06] Apostle Paul when he wrote about the the
[34:08] Lord and savior of our Lord and savior
[34:11] of Jesus Christ as the scripture says
[34:13] there I got that wrong but y'all know
[34:15] what I'm talking about yes
[34:17] sir but when he when he's speaking of
[34:19] that he's not
[34:24] trinitarian when so when he began to
[34:26] speak of these things why because he
[34:27] understood what the godhead was and how
[34:29] it fit together how there were offices
[34:32] not people not
[34:34] persons but when he began to speak this
[34:37] thing and there's a trinitarian scholar
[34:38] standing there saying yeah that's not
[34:42] right but you know what they get up
[34:44] every single day and Blessed Trinity
[34:47] here's here's we we believe this Blessed
[34:51] Trinity well you know what if it was
[34:53] wrong back there and there was no
[34:54] scripture for it then guess what today
[34:57] there there still no scripture for
[35:01] it and it's like you know and when you
[35:04] you know it's like listen when when when
[35:07] Jesus stood there and he said baptize
[35:09] them go into all the world preach the
[35:11] gospel baptize them in the name of the
[35:13] father and of the son and of the Holy
[35:15] Ghost when he said go baptize him in the
[35:18] name I said well tell me where the
[35:19] name's at that's right
[35:21] amen but there's one scripture in the
[35:23] Bible that gives us a name when it's a
[35:26] tied to baptism amen Glory there's only
[35:29] one scripture there's two scriptures in
[35:31] the Bible and one actually has a name
[35:33] tied to
[35:34] it when he go when Paul stands out there
[35:37] on the day of Pentecost when the Holy
[35:39] Ghost comes and quickens the word to
[35:40] them and the drunk men stumble out the
[35:42] door and Peter stands up with the 11 and
[35:44] goes out there and begins to preach to
[35:46] them that these people aren't junk as
[35:48] you suppose but this is the Fulfillment
[35:50] of Joel am this is the Fulfillment of
[35:53] Joel's prophecy and he's putting them
[35:56] right there in the word and showing that
[35:57] this is what was going to take place I
[35:59] would pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[36:01] and here they go and what do they do
[36:02] when he begins to speak to them and tell
[36:04] them of this scripture and it begins to
[36:06] bring Jesus Christ in there that this is
[36:09] the Fulfillment of the ministry of Jesus
[36:11] Christ and they're pricked in their
[36:12] heart and he said well don't you
[36:14] remember what Jesus
[36:17] said no he knew exactly what Jesus said
[36:20] because the Holy Ghost had quickened it
[36:21] to him and he said he said repent and be
[36:25] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[36:27] amen right for remission of sins and he
[36:31] said and you shall receive the gift of
[36:32] the Holy Ghost he said for This Promise
[36:36] is unto you and to your children and to
[36:38] them that's a far off even as many as
[36:40] the Lord Our God shall call so you know
[36:42] what if he started that on the day of
[36:44] Pentecost then guess what it's still in
[36:46] effect today because he hadn't
[36:51] changed or Peter was wrong right
[36:56] amen but that's interesting
[36:59] cuz Peter was the one that Jesus gave
[37:01] the keys to that's
[37:04] right he's the one to put this thing in
[37:07] order and send him out there here Peter
[37:10] take this and it's exactly what he began
[37:13] to do he began to take the scripture and
[37:15] fulfill that and began to preach that
[37:17] and it's still the same way today and
[37:19] it's like well how do you how do you
[37:20] know that's the same you know how I know
[37:22] it's the same you know how I know it
[37:23] works because I have taken the word I've
[37:27] taken God at his word and and fulfilled
[37:29] the word I went to the water and I got
[37:31] baptized and you know what I repented
[37:33] and I followed the prescription and you
[37:34] know what I can say that I got the I got
[37:36] the Fulfillment of it because because
[37:38] God honors his word if you take God at
[37:40] his word he's got to honor his
[37:44] right and if you're afraid to take God
[37:46] at his word then how is he going to
[37:48] honor his word but if you take him at
[37:51] his word just simple childlike Faith
[37:53] then he will honor his word
[37:58] said brother says now we are in the body
[38:00] of Christ First Corinthians 12 he said
[38:03] by one Spirit we're all baptized into
[38:05] one body he said by what he said that's
[38:07] the earnest of our inheritance he said
[38:10] we already got the down payment on it he
[38:12] said that we know that we've passed from
[38:14] Death unto life he said we look back and
[38:17] see where we once were and where we are
[38:19] now amen he said there's sin in the
[38:21] world down there and we've raised above
[38:24] it sitting with him our King in Heavenly
[38:26] places in Christ Jesus what an
[38:29] Evidence see God has brought us to the
[38:32] place to bring us beyond all these
[38:34] things to let us sit in Heavenly places
[38:36] in Christ Jesus and you know and when
[38:39] when we look at our lives sometimes you
[38:41] know it's it's what the scripture says
[38:42] it's not what we think or what what we
[38:44] feel or how things look around us
[38:46] because you know there's lots of days
[38:47] when I wake up and I I look around and
[38:50] say I don't feel like I'm sitting in
[38:51] Heavenly
[38:53] places it's like I this this just don't
[38:55] look like Heavenly places to me right
[38:57] true brother but you know but that
[39:00] that's part of the plan of God to go
[39:02] through these things and and understand
[39:04] God's leading us and in the right way
[39:06] and he's leading us a certain way and
[39:07] wanting us to go through these things
[39:09] and you know God brings us the Victory
[39:12] and here we just keep following God on
[39:14] the way that he wants us to go and just
[39:16] continue to walk because the same one
[39:18] that started you on your journey is
[39:20] going to continue to lead you on your
[39:21] journey and lead you all the way because
[39:23] if he's LED you to the place where
[39:25] you've gotten baptized and you've gotten
[39:27] born Bor again you're born into the
[39:29] family of God and you're born into this
[39:31] Kingdom if you're in the kingdom of God
[39:33] and you and he said we he's made us to
[39:35] sit in Heavenly places and you know what
[39:37] then that's then that's our benefit
[39:39] that's what God has given us and you
[39:41] just continue to walk in that because
[39:42] it's the same one that started you on
[39:44] your journey it'll lead you all the way
[39:47] it's the same it's the same thing
[39:50] amen we just continue to walk and just
[39:53] keep walking in the same thing because
[39:55] the word will begin to open up to us and
[39:58] it begins to express itself because as
[40:00] the word as brother rown was talking
[40:02] about a a child being born when a when a
[40:05] child is born you know because the of
[40:07] them being a human and being born they
[40:09] begin to grow they begin to express
[40:11] these things they go through all the
[40:12] same things that children go through and
[40:14] all the things that they have to do
[40:16] learn to walk and all these things
[40:17] because it's part of the human
[40:19] experience and it's the same thing with
[40:21] a with a son or daughter of God when
[40:23] you're born into this Kingdom you begin
[40:25] to do the exact same thing because you
[40:27] begin to express the word that's birthed
[40:29] into you you begin to go through the
[40:31] same things and show why because it's
[40:33] not something that you can hide because
[40:35] you know when you're born and you begin
[40:37] to grow and you begin to be a human as a
[40:41] child you begin to grow up you know I
[40:43] didn't I didn't have I I tell everybody
[40:45] you know I didn't have to be like Dell
[40:47] Roberts why because his DNA is inside of
[40:49] me and it just began to express itself
[40:52] you know I began to people began to see
[40:55] hey we know who you are
[40:59] you're Dale's boy nobody nobody had
[41:02] nobody had to had to guess
[41:05] that but you know what because it was on
[41:07] the inside and it began to express
[41:09] itself and it's the same way because as
[41:12] they were there the the ones that there
[41:13] on in the day uh where was it Antioch he
[41:17] said he said they they called them
[41:19] Christians because they began to
[41:21] identify because their actions who what
[41:23] they done identified themselves to be
[41:25] Christlike and it began to express
[41:28] itself and they begin to see all the all
[41:30] these expressions of Christ and it's the
[41:32] same way with you and I if Christ is on
[41:34] the inside then you know what it can't
[41:36] help but Express itself why because just
[41:39] like a seed that goes into the ground if
[41:41] it's under the right conditions and it
[41:42] begins to bring forth and you know what
[41:44] that same seed when it becomes to bring
[41:46] bring forth then you know what it can't
[41:48] help but manifest what it
[41:50] is you go out there and plant plant
[41:52] crops in the ground and expect something
[41:54] else to come up right right you know
[41:58] you're out there planting corn and hoing
[42:00] the ground and getting everything
[42:01] prepped and you figure out what kind of
[42:03] fertilizer you need and put everything
[42:04] in the ground put all the seed in there
[42:06] it's
[42:07] like why didn't get any green
[42:11] beans well you know what if you it's
[42:13] what goes in the ground so if if the
[42:16] word of God's being swn and that's what
[42:17] brings forth then that's what it's going
[42:18] to manifest because if it's in you then
[42:21] Christ in you then that's what it's
[42:22] going to manifest your life is going to
[42:24] manifest Jesus Christ
[42:28] right even even in spite of ourselves
[42:31] and our and
[42:33] our our rotten ways sometimes we still
[42:35] Express
[42:37] God you know we still we still battle
[42:40] this old
[42:44] flesh well like brother Dale always
[42:47] said you know it would take more Rapture
[42:50] in faith for me than the rest of you but
[42:53] y it takes takes a lot more to overcome
[42:57] because there's more of me to
[42:59] overcome but you know what I expect that
[43:01] amen but you know I understand that that
[43:03] is what God is that's that's the promise
[43:06] that he made but that's also the battle
[43:09] that's also the conflict that's made
[43:11] that I'm going to have to
[43:15] overcome but you know what he's he said
[43:17] greater is he that's in
[43:20] us why because we battle this
[43:22] world the condition that the world is in
[43:26] all the things but you know what greater
[43:28] is he that's on the inside to overcome
[43:31] this world and all the things that
[43:33] that's in it and all the problems that
[43:35] we face all the
[43:38] troubles but we see all these things how
[43:40] they come all the problems that we face
[43:42] and all these things just like job when
[43:44] he was standing there and he was going
[43:45] through all this these hard times and
[43:48] but God knew who what God was you know
[43:50] what he was doing he was showing job job
[43:53] didn't understand what he was going
[43:54] through and you know how he struggled
[43:56] through all these things and brother Ram
[43:57] talks about you know job was on those on
[44:00] those sacred Sands you know back there
[44:03] going through all all that conflict as
[44:06] brother Bob was talking about you know
[44:08] out there scraping bows and all those
[44:10] type things and you know you couldn't
[44:12] you couldn't get a a breath of fresh air
[44:14] and you know because there's nobody
[44:16] around to give you any comfort you know
[44:18] all people that come by you know you
[44:20] like I wish y'all just go home y'all
[44:23] y'all ain't y'all are Physicians of no
[44:25] value y'all ain't helping me at all
[44:28] you know you don't find anybody you know
[44:30] even your even your wife tell you you
[44:31] know if if the best thing for you to do
[44:33] is just curse God and
[44:35] die it's like well you know you're
[44:37] you're not helping
[44:40] either but you know all those things you
[44:42] know but he was there on and brother
[44:44] Brown said every son and daughter of God
[44:48] has to go through that same situation
[44:49] those same be on the backside of the
[44:52] desert on those sacred Sands where it's
[44:54] just you and God Alone
[44:57] you have to go through all that you he
[44:59] was talking about all the different ones
[45:00] that had to go through their Moses and
[45:02] the different ones where they had to go
[45:03] through all of those battles by their s
[45:06] and it looked like well I don't
[45:08] understand why all these things have
[45:10] happened but you know that's what God
[45:12] wanted them to do to see and job
[45:15] understanding the condition that he was
[45:16] in and understanding why why he had to
[45:19] face these things but you know brother
[45:20] random said you know he he puts every
[45:22] believer on those sacred SS he said he
[45:26] has to take every real child there he
[45:28] gets you on those places where there
[45:32] where there's no devil can ever come
[45:35] there's no teacher can explain it away
[45:37] he gives you something on those Sands
[45:40] back there that an experience that
[45:42] you'll never forget as long as the ages
[45:45] roll on so there's a situation that you
[45:48] got to go through but it brings you to a
[45:50] place it brings you to an experience
[45:52] that you you get to a place that nobody
[45:55] can talk you out of it when you go
[45:57] through all these things and you wonder
[45:58] why things happen the way they do but
[46:01] you know God wants us just to follow him
[46:03] and listen just just just follow the
[46:06] leading of the Lord you know we don't
[46:08] have to understand but you know just
[46:10] follow what God wants us to do you know
[46:13] and and I I I can say that you know
[46:17] there's been many times in my life where
[46:18] I I fa many experiences in my life and I
[46:21] was like it takes many years down the
[46:22] road before I get an answer to it and I
[46:25] I've kept these answers I was telling
[46:26] brother Brother Richard and when I
[46:29] brother Richard's church I was talking
[46:30] about you know they I I heard I heard a
[46:32] man preach one time about Jesus wasn't
[46:34] God to the River Jordan and you know I
[46:36] carried that for years I didn't
[46:38] understand that for years but you know
[46:40] there was something that struck me and I
[46:42] and I told him I said I told the Lord I
[46:43] said if this is truth you're going to
[46:45] have to show it to me because I don't
[46:46] understand it it just don't make
[46:49] sense I'm
[46:51] confused e everybody if this is right
[46:54] and I'm confused or they're wrong or
[46:56] something
[46:57] but you know it took years and it's like
[46:59] well Lord I don't understand it but you
[47:01] know I never never put that down I
[47:04] always kept that before the Lord you I
[47:05] want to know and it's like well you know
[47:07] what the Lord didn't come the next day
[47:10] he didn't come the next
[47:11] year but you know I I carried that for
[47:14] years didn't understand it I had people
[47:17] talk about it I've heard other people
[47:18] preach on it and it was and it didn't
[47:20] make any more sense it did the first
[47:21] than the first
[47:23] time but I was telling them I met a man
[47:26] one
[47:28] day and it was brother
[47:32] Dale and it took me years to carry that
[47:35] all those years and I was telling about
[47:37] but brother Dale was the first person to
[47:38] sat down and began to explain that to me
[47:41] exactly I didn't understand it but you
[47:43] know that was God put somebody in my
[47:45] path right because you know what that's
[47:47] what he said he said he's
[47:51] obligated and you know and and he he
[47:53] said put somebody behind the pull pit
[47:55] well let me tell you sometimes you pull
[47:57] pit is a kitchen
[48:00] table it's where where were the word's
[48:02] coming
[48:03] from we were sitting at we were sitting
[48:05] at their
[48:06] house at the kitchen
[48:10] table and he began to speak to
[48:14] me
[48:16] and it opened up the word to me amen
[48:19] something that I had carried all those
[48:21] years I didn't
[48:22] understand and just just a few moments
[48:26] is all
[48:28] cleared and I was like well praise God
[48:30] now I understand but you know the other
[48:32] thing is is I didn't feel like I was
[48:34] crazy because you know everybody else
[48:35] like woo look at this great Revelation
[48:37] like
[48:38] no but you know it's not it's not just
[48:41] going after something but it's holding
[48:44] something before the Lord and and
[48:45] wanting to know what God what the word
[48:48] is and said well Lord I don't understand
[48:51] this like well brother don't you
[48:53] understand no I
[48:55] don't and there's like I like I told him
[48:58] there's there's things in the scripture
[48:59] I don't understand there's things in the
[49:01] message I don't understand and you know
[49:03] what I don't I don't mind I tell you I
[49:05] don't understand
[49:07] it but you know the problem is is is
[49:10] people they they think they they know
[49:12] they think they understand something but
[49:13] the problem is they
[49:16] don't just like just like brother Dale
[49:19] always said he said you get people they
[49:21] they won't talk about the seals they
[49:23] know all about the seals they can answer
[49:24] all the seals and they don't know one
[49:25] thing about Daniel 7
[49:27] weeks well you know what like brother
[49:30] Dale said he said I didn't say it the
[49:33] prophet said
[49:35] it and he said you ought take it up with
[49:37] him can't take it up with me cuz I'm GNA
[49:39] tell
[49:40] you the prophet said you don't
[49:42] understand this you're not going to
[49:43] understand the seals amen you're not
[49:46] going to understand all these other
[49:48] things and he say why is it so
[49:51] important because you got to understand
[49:53] the word amen
[49:55] right and so you know when you see it's
[49:58] so important because if you've got to
[50:00] have the right heart you you've got
[50:02] you've got to come to the right place
[50:03] Lord I need this I need
[50:05] help but if you come to the I I know it
[50:08] no you don't know it brother and that's
[50:10] and that's the problem people people
[50:12] can't humble themselves to the place and
[50:13] realize listen I need I need help am
[50:16] right and just just admit it I don't
[50:19] know and you know what if if that's
[50:22] that's that's the first thing you got to
[50:23] come to is realize I need help I don't
[50:26] understand that's right you know I was
[50:28] looking at some things where brother R
[50:29] talk about you know he didn't there was
[50:31] a lot of things he didn't understand in
[50:33] his life you know he would sit there
[50:34] Lord I don't understand this I don't
[50:36] understand I don't understand
[50:37] that you know I was I was reading
[50:39] something the other day I thought was it
[50:41] was really good you know when when that
[50:43] when that black sister in in Memphis
[50:46] when when she was out praying for for
[50:49] God you know she's like I'm just like
[50:50] that sh sh woman God gave me a son and
[50:54] he's over here dying and he said you
[50:55] know I'm just like like her said but
[50:57] where's Elijah she began to pray for Eli
[51:00] where where's your Elijah because if if
[51:03] I'm this person then the other one in
[51:05] the in the scripture is Elijah he's got
[51:07] to be here somewhere that's who I
[51:09] need and you know what and she had Faith
[51:11] to believe that she didn't know where he
[51:13] was going to come from or what was going
[51:15] to take place but you know what she had
[51:17] Faith to believe and you know what she G
[51:18] she began to pray as a brother R talks
[51:21] about you know she began to pray all
[51:23] night because she got to desperation she
[51:25] began to pray all night for her answer
[51:28] amen and all of a sudden God didn't
[51:31] speak to brother brandom he spoke to her
[51:34] amen some illiterate wash woman some
[51:38] some auntie in Memphis living in a shack
[51:41] God spoke to her and showed he her what
[51:43] he looked
[51:46] like she knew exactly what was going to
[51:48] take place and and the Lord told her you
[51:50] go stand out by the
[51:53] gate now here he is he's up there at the
[51:56] PE body Hotel getting ready to mail some
[51:57] letters out and all of a sudden the Holy
[51:59] Spirit talks speaks to him and said
[52:03] walk and one time I was reading in the
[52:05] in the thing brother BR said he walked
[52:07] for an hour and a
[52:10] half just

[52:15] where am I going I don't
[52:17] know I just keep getting further and
[52:19] further further away from where I'm
[52:21] supposed to be what he's
[52:23] thinking and all of a sudden he walks
[52:25] down through there and it's lady with a
[52:27] with a man's shirt tied around her head

[52:57] and and so she went so he went in and
[53:00] and because she was telling him that her
[53:01] son was dying and and began to speak to
[53:03] the scripture now you know what it was
[53:05] fulfillment of the word to her she she
[53:07] was walking in a different realm but you
[53:09] know brother brandom stand there saying
[53:11] I don't know I don't understand many
[53:14] times when brother Brandon begins to
[53:15] when he get when he kneels down to pray
[53:16] for that boy brother brand says Lord I

[54:16] of the bed and brother brandom runs out
[54:18] the door and heading toward the plane
[54:20] and the plane's on the ground the whole

[54:56] walked by faith just following the
[55:00] leading just about just like just like

[56:19] sight and that and that man got up and
[56:22] him and his wife was all the way in
[56:24] Camden Arkansas he said he said Parson
[56:26] BR him he said I've never met you before
[56:28] he said I don't know anything about you
[56:29] but he said my M never lied to me while
[56:31] she was on the earth and she was the one
[56:33] that come to me and she said I'm
[56:35] here he said I'm here because that's
[56:38] what she told me to
[56:40] do he come all of 200 miles to Camden
[56:44] Arkansas and here brother Brown the Holy
[56:46] Spirit leads him over there to that man
[56:49] and he begins to speak to him and he
[56:51] begins he hears this testimony you know
[56:52] what brother brandom said he he began to
[56:55] lay his hands on the man and began to
[56:56] pray and the first thing he says is Lord
[56:58] I don't understand
[57:01] this he said Lord but I'm just following
[57:03] the leading of the Holy Spirit I don't
[57:05] understand why I'm here or what's going
[57:06] on but you brought him all this way and
[57:09] why why is all these thousands of people
[57:11] are sick why is it coming to this one
[57:14] man but he lays his hands upon this man
[57:17] and he begins to pray for him and all of
[57:18] a sudden he receives his
[57:20] sight and he says later on he said I got
[57:22] a letter from that from that same man
[57:25] and he be after he got his sight he
[57:27] began to preach the
[57:29] gospel began to travel and preach the
[57:32] gospel why because it was the leading
[57:35] because God didn't always give brother
[57:36] brandham the answers didn't always lead
[57:38] him the but all he done was follow the
[57:40] leading of the Holy
[57:42] Spirit oh if if if we could if we could
[57:45] have a brother brandham experience you
[57:46] know if we could just have a prophet you
[57:48] know experience like the prophet had
[57:50] well you know what there was lots of
[57:51] times that brother brandham didn't know
[57:52] what to
[57:53] do brother how many how many times that
[57:56] talk about having hundreds of plane
[57:59] tickets on the table and all kinds of
[58:01] invitations to go everywhere and preach
[58:03] and everybody's sick and they want you
[58:04] to come and he said all I can do is
[58:08] pray and he said but but he said because
[58:11] if if it wasn't for the Holy Spirit if
[58:14] it wasn't for God leading me he said
[58:15] you'd become neurotic
[58:19] Y and we say oh I wish I wish I had a
[58:22] you know I wish I had an experience like
[58:24] like brother brandham had boy I well you
[58:26] know what you
[58:28] can when the Holy Spirit begins to to
[58:31] lead you and he begins to guide you down
[58:33] a road and you say well Lord I don't
[58:35] understand well guess what you're having
[58:36] the same experience brother brandom
[58:41] had amen all the way through the
[58:43] scripture there's many of them that
[58:45] didn't didn't understand
[58:48] right you know I mean how many people
[58:50] would like to be like ananas was out
[58:54] there the Holy Spirit spoke to ananas
[58:56] ananas we got this great man named
[59:01] Saul he strikes fear in people's
[59:04] hearts nobody wants to be in the same
[59:06] town where he's
[59:09] at but all of a sudden he said ananas
[59:13] I've got a man a servant he's going to
[59:15] do great work for
[59:18] me I want you to go over there and pray
[59:20] for him that he can receive his
[59:24] sight we got ananas jumped up said
[59:27] praise the Lord I do
[59:30] it no he
[59:32] didn't he's like you want me to do
[59:35] what Lord do you know what kind of
[59:37] person this man
[59:40] is no he's had a conversion
[59:45] amen it's like well you know might might
[59:49] might have took a little
[59:51] praying like Lord is that really what
[59:53] you want me to
[59:54] do but you know it it took the moving of
[59:57] the spirit but all of a sudden Here
[1:00:00] Comes Here Comes ananas to pray for
[1:00:03] him here he sees Saul laying there
[1:00:07] blind all hunched down and he said
[1:00:10] brother Saul he said the Lord sent me to
[1:00:12] pray for you that you can receive your
[1:00:14] sight
[1:00:16] amen because God has a work for you to
[1:00:21] do you know and all of a sudden here he
[1:00:24] here he goes and he begins to speak
[1:00:26] and he begin to pray over and all of a
[1:00:28] sudden Saul raises up and you know he
[1:00:30] goes by the name of Paul and and it
[1:00:32] continues on well you know the first
[1:00:33] thing that he does is he don't run out
[1:00:35] and tell everybody what took
[1:00:38] place but he took the scripture and he
[1:00:41] spent three and a half years studying
[1:00:42] the scripture he got right into the word
[1:00:45] because it was something that took place
[1:00:46] that something was Quicken to him that
[1:00:48] day and he began to open up the the
[1:00:51] scripture began to open up and then he
[1:00:52] began to preach the
[1:00:54] gospel what the Lord had showed him all
[1:00:57] of those years that he had studied all
[1:00:59] of the Old Testament all those Scrolls
[1:01:01] knowing every word that the prophets had
[1:01:03] to
[1:01:04] say and all of a sudden in a in a short
[1:01:07] period of time it began to open up and
[1:01:09] he could see Jesus Christ in every part
[1:01:11] of it see if you can't see if you can't
[1:01:13] see Christ and never he said go back and
[1:01:15] read it again and here he he began to
[1:01:18] preach all those things all even even
[1:01:20] when he began to talk about the
[1:01:21] Tabernacle and all the different minute
[1:01:24] things and all kind of different things
[1:01:25] he be began to see Jesus
[1:01:28] Christ what a wonder what a wonderful
[1:01:30] thing it was that all those things that
[1:01:32] he had went through now back when he
[1:01:35] when he went through all those things
[1:01:36] and and he suffered all these
[1:01:39] things lots of times there's there's no
[1:01:42] he didn't God didn't give him an
[1:01:44] answer you know how many times how many
[1:01:47] times did Paul Get
[1:01:48] Shipwrecked beat stoned yes that's right
[1:01:53] you look at all the things he went
[1:01:54] through the scripture says I spent a
[1:01:55] night and a day in the
[1:01:59] Deep that's a long time to be out
[1:02:01] treading
[1:02:04] water but you know he counted all
[1:02:08] joyen all of it every bit that he went
[1:02:12] through just just just doing just doing
[1:02:15] my part he said I'm the I'm the least in
[1:02:18] the
[1:02:18] Kingdom I'm the least of all the
[1:02:21] saints and look look what he went
[1:02:23] through amen bold
[1:02:27] all the things that he had he had to
[1:02:28] face and fight then he stood up and said
[1:02:31] and and and there is his testimony you
[1:02:33] know he said he said I I prayed to God I
[1:02:35] had a I had a thorn in my flesh that
[1:02:37] Satan used to Buffet me that's right and
[1:02:41] he said I prayed to
[1:02:43] God I kept praying to God that he'd
[1:02:45] deliver me of this thing and you know
[1:02:48] what God didn't deliver him of it but he
[1:02:51] brought him his
[1:02:52] word and said my grace is sufficient
[1:02:56] he said then I glory in my
[1:02:59] weakness goes in strength it's made
[1:03:04] perfect see here as he was talking about
[1:03:07] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:03:11] however he went to go through all these
[1:03:12] things and realize you know I still batt
[1:03:13] all these things but you know what God's
[1:03:15] made me a Victor he's made me strong to
[1:03:18] overcome these things and I I will glory
[1:03:20] in my infirmities amen all the things
[1:03:23] that he had to face all the way he went
[1:03:24] through see all those things that we go
[1:03:26] through we wonder why we're in the world
[1:03:29] the condition that we're in today but
[1:03:31] you know he all wants all of us to have
[1:03:34] our time brother BR said all of us have
[1:03:36] to have our time on the ash Heap to go
[1:03:39] through all those times sitting on the
[1:03:41] ash Heap and why because God bring it
[1:03:43] brings us closer to him you know we
[1:03:46] don't always understand why we have to
[1:03:48] go through these things but we know God
[1:03:50] brings us to these places but you know
[1:03:52] he always brings us through and he says
[1:03:55] brother R says I I we don't know what
[1:03:58] will what will come he said what will
[1:04:00] take place but we know one thing that
[1:04:02] we're on the ash Heap the nations's on
[1:04:04] the as sheep the world's on the as sheep
[1:04:06] and because the world is on an as sheep
[1:04:08] I'm so glad that the spirit of God can
[1:04:10] come and we can say My Redeemer liveth
[1:04:13] and at the last day he'll stand on the
[1:04:15] earth someday he will come see we go to
[1:04:18] see all these things while the world is
[1:04:20] in the condition that it sinned but you
[1:04:22] know what he's still in control amen and
[1:04:26] he's brought us and put us on this ashy
[1:04:27] but you know what he will bring us
[1:04:28] through just like he did job we don't
[1:04:31] know what what's going to take place in
[1:04:33] the future but God's the one that's in
[1:04:34] control he's all the time that he will
[1:04:36] bring us through these
[1:04:39] things that we because God wants us to
[1:04:42] have these a certain type of experience
[1:04:44] that we know God can bring us through
[1:04:47] because if we don't go through these
[1:04:48] things we don't know what we can
[1:04:51] stand you go through these things and
[1:04:53] you wonder why you go through these
[1:04:54] heartaches and troubles and tri and
[1:04:56] problems but you don't know what God
[1:04:58] will bring you through and when you go
[1:05:00] back and you look back of all these
[1:05:01] things that you've been through then you
[1:05:03] realize you know it's not
[1:05:05] me God's brought me through all these
[1:05:09] things you know I was I was telling
[1:05:11] sister Esther we were talking about
[1:05:13] Abraham Lincoln and and I was showing
[1:05:16] her one of my favorite quotes of brother

[1:05:27] one of my one of my heroes Abraham
[1:05:29] Lincoln I was born on his birthday uh
[1:05:32] and so uh I always admire him and uh
[1:05:37] brother Brown had a lot of good things
[1:05:38] to say about him so our greatest
[1:05:41] president and a real godly man but you
[1:05:44] know at the end of at the end of toward
[1:05:46] the end of his uh Administration you
[1:05:48] know he made he made a comment I I
[1:05:50] always loved it he saidou know he said
[1:05:52] when it comes my time to lay down the
[1:05:54] Reigns of power'
[1:05:56] and he said you know I I want to conduct
[1:05:58] my Administration that he said he said'
[1:06:01] if I have lost every other friend in the
[1:06:04] world he said I will have one friend and
[1:06:08] he's down inside me
[1:06:10] right amen and you look you look at all
[1:06:13] the things that that he went through in
[1:06:15] his life he had a lot of of contentions
[1:06:17] and you know a lot of people didn't
[1:06:19] agree with a lot of things that he done
[1:06:20] and how he handled things but you know
[1:06:24] what people look back and they say well
[1:06:25] what a man of wisdom yes amen what a
[1:06:28] what a man of of great learning and and
[1:06:31] you you read his writings and it's like
[1:06:33] man how how amazing this man was amen
[1:06:37] but you go back and look at his
[1:06:39] beginning a humble beginning being born
[1:06:42] in a l cabin
[1:06:44] amen
[1:06:46] reading Pilgrim's Progress Fox's book of
[1:06:49] Martyrs the
[1:06:52] Bible that was his beginning of his
[1:06:54] education right reading reading that the
[1:06:58] scripture was was the foundation of his
[1:07:01] life and the other thing was that he had
[1:07:04] somebody he had a stepmother that stood
[1:07:07] there and knew that God had a call on
[1:07:09] his life and she wanted him to learn as
[1:07:12] much as you
[1:07:14] can to learn all that learn all that you
[1:07:17] can and you know she she wanted him to
[1:07:19] read and study and be you know because
[1:07:22] of his because of his great love for
[1:07:24] learning you know he become a lawyer and
[1:07:26] all those things but you know it was
[1:07:28] something that she saw there was a gift
[1:07:29] in his life that God was going to use
[1:07:31] him and there was somebody there that
[1:07:33] stirred up that gift and encouraged him
[1:07:36] to go that way when there was nobody
[1:07:38] else that really was trying to help him
[1:07:40] and you know they just well you're just
[1:07:42] you're just a tall lanky fell from
[1:07:43] Kentucky we don't expect you to
[1:07:46] maybe become much or or do much but
[1:07:51] there was somebody that crossed his path
[1:07:52] and told him said listen right go has a
[1:07:55] work for you to
[1:07:58] do and it's like well I just want to go
[1:08:00] this
[1:08:01] way I don't know what I don't know what
[1:08:03] the future holds or what's going to take
[1:08:05] place but I know God is leading me amen
[1:08:08] and that's the way you and I are we just
[1:08:10] take what I want to go God's
[1:08:13] way every day whichever way it goes
[1:08:17] there's there's a way for me and I want
[1:08:18] to follow it amen as job said he knows
[1:08:21] the way that I take and when he has
[1:08:24] tried me I'll come for as gold because
[1:08:26] he said I have not
[1:08:28] strayed from his from his way amen the
[1:08:32] way that God shows me that's the way I
[1:08:34] continue to walk and that's that's our
[1:08:36] goal I'll walk the way God has shows you
[1:08:39] to walk even if you don't see it you go
[1:08:41] through Dark Times cloudy
[1:08:44] days because if you see the the dark
[1:08:47] clouds and all that doesn't mean God's
[1:08:48] not with you that doesn't mean that God
[1:08:51] doesn't love you
[1:08:52] right and just because it's sunny and
[1:08:54] bright and everything looks great that
[1:08:56] doesn't means God's
[1:08:58] approval but you know we're if you're a
[1:09:01] child of God you know what if he loves
