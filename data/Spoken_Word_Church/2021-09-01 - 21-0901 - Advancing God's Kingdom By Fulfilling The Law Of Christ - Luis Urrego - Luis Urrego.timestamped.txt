[7:56] prayers you just continue to remember
[7:58] all the other ones that are struggling
[8:00] and
[8:01] many sick people we know it's nothing
[8:02] but devil
[8:04] nothing but satan attacking his people
[8:07] but at the same time i believe god is is
[8:10] allowing us to be able to
[8:12] uh use this this time to to look at
[8:15] ourselves and to look at our own walks
[8:18] with god amen and to uh
[8:21] as i will be talking here in just a
[8:22] moment you know to about uh looking at
[8:26] at our lives in order to advance this
[8:29] kingdom even further you see because i
[8:31] believe the kingdom is still amen is
[8:33] still advancing it's still growing it's
[8:35] still the kingdom hasn't stopped because
[8:37] of covet
[8:39] the kingdom is still advancing there's
[8:41] people still coming in the holy spirit

[9:08] our best to not you i'm trying not to
[9:10] keep you all along tonight
[9:13] so we're going to go to john chapter 15
[9:16] john chapter 15.
[9:18] now i want to talk this
[9:19] i want to start maybe this this might
[9:22] end up being like a little series
[9:24] um because i don't think i'll be able to
[9:26] get done tonight but um
[9:28] but maybe uh we'll we'll
[9:31] we'll finish it out in a few different
[9:33] services
[9:35] but um
[9:37] this um
[9:39] this
[9:40] this really impressed me the other day
[9:42] well actually yesterday
[9:44] as i was looking
[9:46] looking into this about what the law of
[9:48] christ is
[9:49] and
[9:52] and so we're living in the time saints
[9:54] where where
[9:56] we need to fulfill the law of christ
[9:59] we need to fulfill the law of christ
[10:02] and
[10:03] where the world is trying to divide us
[10:05] amen god is calling for our unity
[10:09] you see the world is trying to divide
[10:11] their own and they're also trying to
[10:12] divide the people of god as well and we
[10:15] know it's nothing but satan yet god even
[10:19] at the end time even towards the end of
[10:21] his ministry where there was
[10:23] even division
[10:24] amen god was trying to bring unity among
[10:27] his people he even prayed for for for
[10:30] his children and for and for even those
[10:32] that those
[10:33] his disciples was going to reach amen
[10:36] and what did he call for for unity
[10:38] amen and
[10:39] satan knows that if if we're not unified
[10:42] and if there's no love amongst one
[10:44] another and if we allow the elements and
[10:46] if we allow the governments and if we
[10:47] allow the media to to to to to divide us
[10:51] then he know he he has us conquered
[10:54] no matter with what with what it is what
[10:56] political thing that they throw at us if
[10:59] it causes division you know it's not of
[11:01] god
[11:02] it's got to be from satan
[11:04] so so we want to we want to look at
[11:06] something here and just
[11:08] and hopefully i hope you receive as much
[11:11] of a blessing from it as i've been
[11:13] receiving because i've been certainly
[11:15] enjoying looking at looking at this so
[11:17] let's look here at john chapter 15 verse
[11:19] verse 8. the bible says
[11:22] herein is my father glorified that you
[11:24] bear much fruit
[11:26] so shall ye be my disciples
[11:29] as the father hath loved me
[11:32] so have i loved you
[11:35] and then he says here continue ye in my
[11:38] love
[11:39] now watch if you keep my commandments
[11:42] ye shall abide in my love
[11:45] even as i have kept my father's
[11:47] commandments and abide in his love
[11:51] these things have i spoken unto you that
[11:53] my joy might remain in you
[11:56] and that your joy might be full
[11:59] verse 12 this is my commandment watch
[12:01] this is my commandment that ye love one
[12:04] another
[12:06] as i have loved you
[12:08] and we'll talk if the lord gives us some
[12:11] time we'll we'll we'll talk about that
[12:13] some more in more detail
[12:15] about something that he did
[12:17] amen that proved that that showed that
[12:20] greater love verse 13 greater love hath
[12:22] no man than this that a man laid down
[12:25] his life for his friends
[12:28] amen
[12:29] you are my friends
[12:31] i hope you can say that to me
[12:34] you are my friends amen
[12:37] if ye do
[12:38] whatsoever i command you jesus says you
[12:41] are my friends if you do whatsoever i
[12:42] command you
[12:44] verse 17. now we'll skip down to verse
[12:46] 17. watch these things i command you
[12:49] that ye love one another so it wasn't a
[12:51] suggestion
[12:53] it wasn't as it wasn't you know uh just
[12:56] a thought it was a commandment
[12:59] these things i command you that ye love
[13:01] one another amen now let's look at verse
[13:04] uh galatians chapter 6 verse 2.
[13:08] and we appreciate the brothers because

[13:16] hope you pay attention
[13:18] i hope that this is something that that
[13:20] will bless you
[13:22] it says bear ye one another's burdens
[13:24] and so fulfill the law of christ

[15:28] amen so
[15:29] i want to talk this evening advancing
[15:31] god's kingdom by fulfilling the law of
[15:34] christ amen
[15:35] and i know that each and every one of us
[15:37] has probably heard the phrase uh a new
[15:40] world order amen well the world they
[15:43] have that phrase they they use that
[15:45] phrase politicians and and and and big
[15:49] uh people of this earth who who call
[15:52] this earth their home and this current
[15:54] uh uh uh this current situation that
[15:57] they're in you know call it their home
[15:59] but see god has his own new world order
[16:03] amen and he established that when he was
[16:05] here on earth amen
[16:07] and uh it's been advancing ever since
[16:09] praise god
[16:11] it's it's it's an order that satan can't
[16:13] put can't put his finger on amen it's an
[16:15] eternal order amen their order is
[16:18] something that they think that they're
[16:20] obtaining eternal life by however way
[16:23] they they want to they they look to
[16:25] machines they look to they're trying to
[16:27] find the source of eternal life when we
[16:29] already have eternal life
[16:31] and there's nothing that we had to do we
[16:32] had to create no ai's
[16:35] anything inject ourselves with anything
[16:37] or anything like that amen all we have
[16:39] to do is believe upon what god said in
[16:41] his word amen
[16:43] and we have his eternal life in us amen
[16:47] praise the lord amen so i want to start
[16:50] off this this uh evening with
[16:53] with uh what matthew chapter 24 verse
[16:56] 9 through 14 says and i wan i want to
[16:59] put it i want to look at this here about
[17:01] about the love of many shall wax cold
[17:04] amen when we were listening to uh
[17:06] brother uh brother claude the other day
[17:08] and uh it struck me it struck me that
[17:11] that he mentioned something there when
[17:13] he was talking about this part with
[17:15] regards to uh
[17:19] that the people towards the end time
[17:20] amen there will be a people that will
[17:22] suffer for his namesake
[17:25] and now who who suffers for his namesake
[17:27] well it's either the jews who've
[17:29] accepted christ or it's us
[17:31] that's the gentiles because we're the
[17:32] ones who take his name amen or jews amen
[17:35] there's messianic jews out there who
[17:37] believe that jesus christ is the messiah
[17:39] amen and uh so they they there will
[17:42] there will be a persecution even for
[17:44] them as well but um
[17:47] but in looking at this
[17:49] at this here we we see the different
[17:52] conditions and what's happening here and
[17:54] we're seeing it clearly even now in the
[17:56] end time that we're living in so if we
[17:58] start there in verse 9 it says then
[18:00] shall they deliver you up to be
[18:01] afflicted and shall kill you and ye
[18:03] shall be hated of all nations for my
[18:06] name's sake
[18:07] and then shall many be offended
[18:11] and we're living in that time aren't we
[18:13] because everybody gets offended for
[18:15] everything now
[18:17] you just it's it's snowflakes everywhere
[18:19] you go
[18:21] you can't say one thing anymore you
[18:23] can't joke around anything because you
[18:25] have to be politically correct about
[18:26] everything nowadays
[18:28] so the bible was talking about it and
[18:30] then shall many be offended and shall
[18:33] betray one another
[18:36] and we're seeing that
[18:38] and we're not careful amen we'll fall in
[18:40] line to maybe even possibly let in that
[18:43] direction too because who was the one
[18:45] that betrayed jesus
[18:46] it was one of his own
[18:48] it was one that followed him
[18:50] that's who betrayed jesus and shall
[18:52] betray one another and shall hate one
[18:55] another
[18:57] those are strong words and this is jesus
[18:59] speaking
[19:00] verse 11 and many false prophets shall
[19:03] rise and shall deceive
[19:05] many
[19:07] many people amen you
[19:09] you can turn on you can turn on youtube
[19:11] and you can listen to anybody you want
[19:12] to
[19:13] and be deceived
[19:15] amen
[19:16] in verse 12 and because iniquity now
[19:20] watch this and because iniquity shall
[19:22] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[19:27] now it doesn't say that the love shall
[19:30] completely go away but that the love of
[19:33] many
[19:34] not all but many
[19:36] shall dwindle shall get cold
[19:39] and when you look at that word love
[19:41] there is the word agape
[19:43] amen
[19:44] which means brotherly love god's love
[19:47] amen
[19:48] because iniquity shall abound now how
[19:50] many believes that we're living in a in
[19:52] an age right now where iniquity is
[19:55] abounding
[19:56] i mean if you
[19:58] you don't even have to watch cnn or the
[20:00] news or anything to know that something
[20:02] is wrong with this country something is
[20:04] going on something is wrong with this
[20:06] world
[20:07] iniquity is abounding
[20:09] you don't even know what to believe
[20:11] nowadays
[20:12] something is happening there's a shift
[20:15] taking place and we're in the middle of
[20:18] it
[20:18] amen
[20:21] it's iniquity
[20:22] because men are just the whoever
[20:26] whoever
[20:26] these these men are just going for broke
[20:29] doing whatever they need to do amen to
[20:31] bring out what they call their new world
[20:33] order
[20:34] and so
[20:35] the love of many shall wax cold now
[20:38] it will wax cold if we keep looking at
[20:40] that
[20:43] if we keep looking at those things and
[20:44] we keep looking at the at the at the
[20:47] at the heartache the carnage the
[20:49] destruction everything that's going on
[20:51] our love will eventually wax cold
[20:53] if we stop looking at that stuff and
[20:55] just keep our eyes on the word keep our
[20:58] eyes up up amen where our redemption
[21:00] draws now amen then we should get warmer
[21:02] in that love amen we should get harder
[21:05] in that love and not just for coming to
[21:08] church and and doing what you need to do
[21:10] but also for for a love for one another
[21:14] because it's connected
[21:16] amen how can you say you love god and
[21:18] you don't love your brother that you see
[21:21] and you say you love god that you don't
[21:23] see
[21:24] that's what the bible says
[21:26] right
[21:28] and and
[21:29] and and sometimes you know we come to
[21:31] church and and we do what we're supposed
[21:32] to do and we sing and everything like
[21:34] that but we can we don't have patience
[21:36] with one another
[21:39] we fail in such simple areas
[21:43] amen patience with one another the way
[21:45] we deal with one another the way we
[21:46] handle each other
[21:48] amen
[21:50] i think it's time for us to look at
[21:51] ourselves and see amen
[21:53] letting doubt letting go amen these
[21:56] little weights amen that are hindering
[21:58] us from keep moving forward
[21:59] that's that's draw that's making us are
[22:02] making our love wax cold
[22:04] but he that verse 13 but he that shall
[22:07] endure unto the end the same shall be
[22:10] saved
[22:11] amen and this gospel of the kingdom
[22:14] shall be preached in all the world for a
[22:16] witness unto all nations that's that
[22:18] wasn't that wasn't possible back during
[22:20] the time of the the disciples when jesus
[22:23] was here on
[22:24] earth it's possible now
[22:27] especially with the advent of the
[22:29] internet
[22:31] it's possible now
[22:33] the uh last when was it saturday
[22:35] saturday night i was preaching from my
[22:37] house i was preaching to the philippines
[22:40] about me i saw maybe 75 people listen
[22:43] listening under to brother royale's
[22:45] church
[22:46] just trying to pitch in helping them out
[22:48] you know that brother royal is out and
[22:51] uh it was just it dawned on me man
[22:53] that's amazing to think that i'm
[22:55] preaching from uh winder georgia in the
[22:58] manila philippines
[23:01] all across the ocean
[23:03] and i'm not there they're just seeing me
[23:06] and people are saying amen and things
[23:07] like that
[23:08] that's quite incredible
[23:10] and so this scripture this gospel of the
[23:12] kingdom shall be preached you see it
[23:14] shall be preached
[23:16] in all the world for a witness unto all
[23:18] nations and then
[23:20] shall the end come amen so that that has
[23:23] to be fulfilled now
[23:25] i want to i want us to look closely at
[23:27] verse 12 again and i want us to to look
[23:29] it says and because iniquity shall
[23:32] abound now what is iniquity let's look
[23:35] let's look here just a moment what
[23:37] iniquity is and we have heard the
[23:39] definition from brother branham and
[23:41] we're going to read that here in just a
[23:42] moment but let's look at at iniquity
[23:44] here
[23:45] at what the what the dictionary says it
[23:47] is it's it's gross immorality
[23:51] or injustice
[23:53] wickedness
[23:54] a grossly immoral act a sin
[23:58] lack of equity gross injustice
[24:02] unrighteousness wickedness
[24:05] amen and and look what it says here the
[24:08] condition of one without law
[24:11] or lawlessness
[24:13] amen if you don't think that we're
[24:14] living in that time now
[24:17] people don't care what what what anybody
[24:19] says they don't care what a church they
[24:20] don't care what a pastor says they don't
[24:22] even care what their parents say they
[24:23] don't even and most they don't care what
[24:25] their parents say most surely they don't
[24:27] care what what the government says they
[24:29] don't care what any any authority says
[24:31] i'm going to do what i want to do
[24:34] you saw it last year in the last summer
[24:36] amen with all the rights taking place
[24:38] and everybody they don't respect
[24:39] authority
[24:41] burning buildings and all kinds of stuff
[24:44] in the name of i don't know what cause
[24:48] you see if you and me were out there
[24:49] doing that we'd be we'd be jailed right
[24:50] away
[24:53] those people they got to get out quickly
[24:56] the condition of one without law
[24:59] lawlessness amen and we know speaking
[25:01] about that law amen the law of christ
[25:04] amen abiding in the law of christ praise
[25:06] god
[25:08] and so here's what the prophet the
[25:10] prophet's definition of what iniquity is
[25:12] amen there's four attributes that i
[25:15] looked at and reading some of what the
[25:16] prophet was was uh talking about
[25:18] iniquity there's
[25:20] four things that i noticed were
[25:22] attributes of iniquity amen and brother
[25:26] bran one of them is hypocrisy
[25:29] and brother brahman says here what is
[25:31] iniquity in the spoken word is the
[25:33] original seed he says something that you
[25:35] know that's wrong and you do it anyhow
[25:38] and you know that that god's word is
[25:41] right why do you play the hypocrite
[25:44] because of your organization
[25:46] and pick a little bit here and won't
[25:48] take the rest of it
[25:50] you worker of iniquity
[25:54] so that that's that's one one aspect of
[25:56] iniquity another aspect is blatant
[25:58] disobedience
[26:00] and brother brown says here iniquity is
[26:02] something that you know that you ought
[26:03] to do and you won't do it you know
[26:05] better
[26:06] but won't do it it's iniquity see you
[26:08] know they should stay with the word of
[26:10] god but for their church sake or
[26:12] somebody else's sake or something else
[26:15] you'll stray for from the word of god
[26:17] and do what the organization says
[26:20] well i don't know my church says we
[26:21] should do it this way and i believe it
[26:23] this way see and it's right before you
[26:26] that you shouldn't do it
[26:28] it's just blatant disobedience
[26:30] just just i'm just gonna just do it
[26:32] anyhow
[26:33] amen
[26:35] another attribute of iniquity is is
[26:37] pride and self-centeredness
[26:39] and and and and ram says here in the
[26:42] message influence iniquity what is
[26:43] iniquity iniquity is something that you
[26:45] know it's wrong and still holding to it
[26:48] when you know your creeds are wrong and
[26:50] you still hold to it that's iniquity
[26:54] amen
[26:55] you know it it's wrong
[26:56] but because you don't want to admit that
[26:59] you're wrong amen
[27:01] become you become prideful and you're
[27:03] you become self-centered now i i'm i'm
[27:07] looking at these because i want us and
[27:09] what we're going to look at in john
[27:10] chapter 13
[27:12] uh
[27:14] at a character there in just a moment it
[27:16] all applies to him exactly amen and then
[27:21] it begins uh this iniquity the fourth
[27:24] thing is it begins in the heart before
[27:26] it manifests outwardly
[27:28] and it says what is iniquity brother
[27:30] brown says in the harvest time it it's
[27:31] something that you know that's right and
[27:34] you concede it and won't do it in your
[27:36] heart
[27:38] when you know that the bible teaches a
[27:39] certain thing and you won't do it that's
[27:41] iniquity and david said if i hide
[27:43] iniquity in my heart god will not even
[27:46] hear my prayer
[27:48] amen
[27:49] but see we live in a day nowadays that
[27:52] because i don't get struck by lightning
[27:55] nothing happens to me
[27:57] i just keep doing what i'm doing
[27:59] i keep sinning i keep with my filthy
[28:01] mouth i keep lying i keep cheating i
[28:03] keep doing anything and nothing's
[28:05] happening so that just you know i'll
[28:07] just keep doing it
[28:09] that's iniquity
[28:11] because at one point you knew that it
[28:13] was wrong you just keep doing until your
[28:15] mind is just completely seared and it
[28:17] just becomes like nothing's wrong
[28:19] anymore
[28:20] i believe this is how the condition of
[28:22] this world
[28:24] and if we're not careful it spills over
[28:26] into our chur into the church
[28:29] it's a spirit saints
[28:31] it's a spirit young people
[28:33] amen
[28:35] because they're natural amen types of
[28:37] spiritual amen a lot of times amen
[28:39] what's happening in the world if we're
[28:41] not careful it will affect us amen and
[28:44] we drag those spirits right in here amen
[28:48] and we affect one another
[28:51] praise the lord
[28:52] amen so
[28:54] i want you to keep those items in mind
[28:56] for for future reference and just i
[28:58] don't know if we'll have time tonight
[28:59] but we'll we'll we'll get that i'm just
[29:01] going to take my time
[29:03] i'm going to take my time you know like
[29:05] i said this might be several parts so
[29:09] and like i said i just hope you see it
[29:10] the way it's it
[29:12] the way you see you know sometimes we as
[29:14] ministers we get so excited about
[29:15] something oh my gosh you know and this
[29:18] is wonderful this is amazing i feel like
[29:20] jumping and shouting and running around
[29:22] in my study and and
[29:24] and and then you're like oh man but if
[29:26] they can just see it the way i see it
[29:28] but the dale you've been there
[29:32] and and so i hope hopefully just ask god
[29:35] for revelation amen
[29:37] praise god so the love of many shall wax
[29:40] cold now
[29:41] again and because iniquity shall abound
[29:43] the love of many shall wax cold
[29:46] now in looking at this verse let's just
[29:48] look at some obser observations there
[29:51] one iniquity will be abundant so there's
[29:53] plenty of iniquity
[29:56] right
[29:58] that's what the word abound means it
[30:00] means it's abundant
[30:02] would you just have plenty of it two the
[30:04] love will dwindle
[30:06] but not completely go away
[30:08] amen you see
[30:10] when brother branham drew when the angel
[30:12] of the lord drew that light there when
[30:14] on the church ages it was originally
[30:16] drawn as dark complete gross darkness
[30:18] in this day
[30:20] but god allowed amen for the prophet to
[30:22] be able to add that little bit of light
[30:24] amen that's you and me
[30:26] amen
[30:27] you and i amen in this dark and wicked
[30:30] hour you thought the uh the uh during
[30:32] martin luther's age was dark and it was
[30:34] evil and it was gross and it was
[30:37] this is his age is worse
[30:40] because there's attacks at least you saw
[30:42] the attack coming at you amen you see
[30:45] the attack came in as a in the form of a
[30:47] lion
[30:48] and what did what did the christians do
[30:50] man they would just huddle next to each
[30:52] other and lord receive our spirit amen
[30:54] we've believed upon you we've done
[30:55] everything we could amen and they just
[30:57] gave right in
[30:59] i believe god protect
[31:00] god allowed for them to not even feel
[31:02] any pain i believe that
[31:05] they stood for christ god will stand for
[31:07] them
[31:08] amen
[31:10] no we back then you saw the the attack
[31:13] coming at you now you just don't know
[31:15] where the attack is coming from it's so
[31:17] gray
[31:18] it's it's so shadowy it's so it's it's
[31:21] so uh uh um mysterious now we know it's
[31:25] there but
[31:27] satan is just working in every way now
[31:31] internet
[31:32] uh uh uh just all kinds of spirits
[31:34] everywhere now it's just
[31:36] it's just so so so uh uh if you're not
[31:39] careful you can be the seed
[31:44] another third observation there in that
[31:45] verse the love of many not all will
[31:48] dwindle
[31:49] amen i trust that that's us
[31:52] amen the love of many shall wax cold but
[31:55] not all
[31:57] and the love described here as i said
[31:59] earlier is the agape love now agape the
[32:01] word agape is is a is a feminine
[32:04] i thought that was interesting it's a
[32:06] noun a feminine noun
[32:08] love that is affection or benevolence
[32:10] specifically a love feast charity dear
[32:14] love affection good will love
[32:16] benevolence brotherly love
[32:18] love feasts and most important is the
[32:20] love that god loves us with
[32:23] amen
[32:24] god loves us in the agape love it's an
[32:27] unconditional love
[32:28] amen
[32:30] because
[32:31] maybe brother don may see things
[32:32] different a world a different world view
[32:34] or or political worldview maybe than i
[32:37] do amen it doesn't matter i still love
[32:39] my brother
[32:40] and he loves me because what what does
[32:42] what does unite us amen politics know
[32:45] the word should unite us
[32:46] amen
[32:48] what does
[32:49] what should unite amen and if you're
[32:51] allowing politics and world views amen
[32:54] to divide you amen then you don't have
[32:57] the love of christ dwelling in you you
[32:59] don't see that brother you don't see
[33:01] that sister amen as part of the body
[33:03] that you dwell in
[33:07] that's
[33:08] iniquity and the love of many shall wax
[33:11] cold the bible says
[33:14] see satan nowadays what what he's trying
[33:17] to do is again like i said earlier he's
[33:19] trying to divide each and every one of
[33:21] us
[33:22] i know i know people i've heard reports
[33:24] of even
[33:25] uh uh churches being divided
[33:28] with their current events and the
[33:30] current things amen
[33:32] being divided about the vaccinated and
[33:33] the non-vaccinated
[33:35] i mean if say if satan can do that
[33:39] nowadays
[33:40] man we we got it we need the holy ghost
[33:44] and we don't have the holy ghost
[33:46] amen how in the world can something like
[33:48] that divide us but it's happening it's
[33:51] happening in south america amongst
[33:53] message churches
[33:57] and we're not careful we'll allow those
[33:59] things to come and creep in here
[34:02] and you know
[34:03] is that the spirit of god
[34:06] no that's the spirit of satan
[34:09] because what satan tries to do is he
[34:11] tries to divide then conquer
[34:14] that's exactly what he does
[34:17] now brother branham here's a few things
[34:19] that brother branham speaking of of love
[34:21] wax and cold brother brown says here it
[34:23] used to be a long time ago when when the
[34:25] neighbor got sick or something we went
[34:27] over and cut his corn cut him some wood
[34:30] if it was winter time and today the
[34:33] neighbor can die and you don't know it
[34:35] till you read it in the paper
[34:37] well the first time i heard that i just
[34:39] laughed
[34:41] back when i first came into the message
[34:43] but it's true
[34:45] there is neighborhoods with houses right
[34:47] next to each other and they don't know
[34:49] one another
[34:51] that that's sad
[34:53] i mean
[34:54] in toronto canada i mean the houses are
[34:56] just so close to one another you know
[34:58] and different
[35:00] and and they don't know each other
[35:02] hardly
[35:05] no friendship among one another anymore
[35:07] that's awful brother branham says
[35:09] love because the iniquity shall abound
[35:12] the love of many shall wax cold said
[35:14] jesus in
[35:15] the 24th chapter that's true
[35:18] he also says a long time ago when we
[35:19] used to run out of money we'd go over to
[35:22] the neighbor and borrow fifty dollars to
[35:24] hold us over
[35:25] while we didn't have no we didn't have
[35:27] to sign any notes we trusted one another
[35:32] you think you could go do that today
[35:36] you don't you can't trust anybody
[35:38] anymore
[35:40] you can't borrow five dollars now
[35:42] without a ten dollar security on top of
[35:44] it
[35:44] that was a lot of money back then
[35:48] that was 1951 when brother brown said
[35:50] this
[35:50] that's right no love
[35:53] the bible said because the love shall
[35:54] wax cold the love because iniquity shall
[35:57] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[36:00] and he says here he continues to say
[36:02] that's what's the matter with the world
[36:04] they're dying for love
[36:07] they want to see love
[36:10] we got plenty of teaching plenty of
[36:12] plenty churches but we need a love of
[36:14] god
[36:16] amen
[36:19] i've said i've said before the world
[36:21] wants to see something genuine
[36:24] and they don't see it therefore
[36:27] everything uh they they get uh
[36:30] uh like they they just they they just
[36:32] believe in their mind they'll never get
[36:33] to see it
[36:35] but it's it's up to you and i saints
[36:38] because even when jesus prayed for us
[36:40] there in john 17
[36:42] he says he asked for unity
[36:45] so that the world can see
[36:49] we're the only true people that can show
[36:52] the world what love is all about
[36:55] but if we hate one another and bicker
[36:57] amongst each other and fight amongst
[36:59] each other and and and and and and and
[37:02] all these things
[37:04] then what are we going to show to the
[37:05] world
[37:07] we're just like them
[37:10] amen
[37:12] praise god
[37:13] brother branham says now i see her
[37:16] my just happy and rejoicing and she
[37:18] heard about elizabeth this is speaking
[37:20] about elizabeth when she was pregnant
[37:22] with john the baptist and she wanted to
[37:24] share
[37:24] the blessing that's usually the way
[37:27] christians do
[37:29] right up into judea she went to share
[37:31] the blessing with mary or with elizabeth
[37:35] and i see her getting up there in judea
[37:37] you know to share the blessing i can see
[37:39] elizabeth setting maybe doing her
[37:41] knitting and when she seen mary coming
[37:43] maya she threw aside the croc
[37:46] crocheting or knitting ever what it was
[37:48] and run out there and grabbed her in her
[37:50] arms and began to hug her and kiss her
[37:54] well they had feelings
[37:58] so she
[38:01] many times
[38:03] you know the other day uh

[38:06] are you doing we we

[38:12] how how's because i knew that he works
[38:14] for the same school district that i work
[38:16] for
[38:17] and it's like you you bother them asking
[38:19] them stopping them from what they're
[38:21] doing to ask them a question
[38:23] they just don't want to be bothered
[38:25] people don't want to be bothered
[38:28] hey you just want to be nice
[38:30] i had some neighbors that
[38:32] that that just moved out from our house
[38:35] and i was just trying to be nice
[38:37] and you know maybe hopefully get to
[38:39] share the gospel with them you know and
[38:42] and i was we were trying to set a a a
[38:44] day where we could go to their house you
[38:46] know or they come to ours and and we
[38:48] have you know pizza they had little kids
[38:50] and you know and uh just fellowship with
[38:52] them you know i don't mind
[38:54] fellowshipping with anybody if i have
[38:55] the opportunity to share the word with
[38:57] them
[38:58] you see you know i i'll drink coffee
[39:00] with you eat a piece of cake you know i
[39:03] don't care you know you may say a few
[39:04] bad words around me but hey i'm not
[39:06] gonna i i know where i'm standing amen
[39:09] let my life try to influence you i'm not
[39:11] afraid to hang out with you if i can win
[39:13] you for christ but some of us don't are
[39:16] not like that we're not around the
[39:17] believers i don't want to be around the
[39:19] world though i'm scared
[39:21] we're not like that why are we supposed
[39:23] to be a light to the world
[39:26] amen what's the world going to see
[39:27] they'd see their own they know their own
[39:29] they already got their own amen they
[39:31] want to see something different you're
[39:32] the ones who could show them something
[39:34] different
[39:36] so we set you know a time for them to
[39:38] you know and and the day came
[39:40] and uh i texted they texted me oh you
[39:44] know my wife doesn't think that we can
[39:45] get you know get together we'll just let
[39:47] you know when we get together you know
[39:49] we can get together again they never
[39:51] text it back
[39:52] they're right next door to us
[39:57] my wife's like you just feel bad you got
[39:59] your feelings hurt
[40:02] i just want to be nice
[40:05] but people don't want to be that way
[40:07] people don't have feelings anymore
[40:09] amen
[40:10] you know what's the matter with the
[40:12] people today brother branham he said
[40:13] we're getting away from that you don't
[40:16] feel for one another
[40:17] amen
[40:19] i want to ask you something and i'm
[40:21] being serious and asking you all what
[40:23] what is the spirit that would cause us
[40:28] to
[40:28] be afraid to come to church
[40:32] and
[40:33] shake one another's hand
[40:35] and
[40:36] and not even look at each other like
[40:38] we're a walking virus
[40:41] what is the spirit that would cause us
[40:43] to to to to view each other that way
[40:47] is it the spirit of god
[40:49] to be afraid to look at you know you
[40:52] know
[40:54] doing this number
[40:55] with everybody
[40:57] because you can't shake people's hands
[41:00] what spirit would cause you to do that
[41:05] just think about it
[41:08] because what what what what the lord
[41:11] wants is what the lord wants is unity
[41:15] i understand you know if you want to be
[41:17] careful and i respect that you know i
[41:19] understand that that's fine
[41:22] but i still want to hug you
[41:25] i still want to shake your hand
[41:27] and you
[41:28] and what what i'm saying is these little
[41:30] kids that's all they've learned for the
[41:32] past year and a half that's all they've
[41:34] taken with them i believe eventually
[41:37] it'll damage them mentally
[41:39] seeing people doing all this little fist
[41:41] bumping and all this kind of stuff i
[41:43] want a good old shake shaking of the
[41:45] hand
[41:46] get back to that
[41:48] that's normal to me
[41:50] and all this social distancing and all
[41:52] this stuff
[41:53] that's not normal
[41:55] that's satanic
[41:58] and everywhere we go i mean we're you
[42:01] looking at everybody like they're a
[42:02] biohazard
[42:04] that's what the world and and the people
[42:06] that that think they're going to live
[42:08] here eternally without god's eternal
[42:10] life in them want you to do
[42:13] that's what satan wants you to do
[42:17] i don't god doesn't want you to do that
[42:20] that's not the spirit of christ
[42:23] and you know what that is that is that
[42:25] that's that's fear
[42:27] and you know what fear is it's a lack of
[42:29] love
[42:31] that's what the bible says
[42:33] because look that's what first john says
[42:36] first john 4 18 says there is no fear in
[42:39] love
[42:43] does the bible say that
[42:45] there is no fear in love i don't know if
[42:46] they got it or not but perfect love
[42:50] casteth out fear
[42:53] you should be so trusting in in god so
[42:56] much amen that
[42:59] that
[43:00] god will protect me
[43:04] perfect love casteth out here because
[43:05] fear hath torment
[43:08] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[43:11] love i didn't say that the bible says
[43:13] that
[43:15] that is what satan is trying to bring
[43:17] upon the people nowadays is fear fear
[43:20] fear
[43:21] fear
[43:22] if we're not careful amen it starts
[43:24] making us
[43:25] lose
[43:26] and wax cold in our love
[43:30] do you see how those two are connected
[43:33] at what point saints are we going to
[43:35] quit with the fear
[43:37] it's got to be
[43:39] you know we're not going in a rapture
[43:41] with all this
[43:42] you know all this stuff and stuff i
[43:43] thought we're going to be hugging one
[43:44] another and stuff like that
[43:47] fish bumping and all this stuff
[43:49] well
[43:51] and and first john 4 1 says their
[43:53] beloved believe not every spirit
[43:57] we should rightly discern every spirit
[44:00] believe not every spirit but try the
[44:02] spirits whether they are of god
[44:05] i told people last year when all this
[44:07] cobot hit and some of you all may
[44:08] remember that when all this cobit stuff
[44:10] hit and we started with all this mask
[44:12] wearing and all this stuff all this
[44:13] stuff that this was going to affect
[44:16] people mentally
[44:18] we see the results of that now
[44:21] mental health has increased
[44:23] the damages have increased
[44:26] anna you probably know
[44:28] you can you can talk to doctors i've
[44:30] heard testimonies of doctors of of
[44:32] little kids
[44:33] they have been they have been so uh uh
[44:38] their minds have been so twisted now
[44:40] that they go and see a doctor and the
[44:42] doctor says it's safe you can take your
[44:44] mask off it's okay honey the mom takes
[44:46] the mask off but the kid keeps the mask
[44:48] on and and the doctor says why don't you
[44:51] want to take your mask he says i'm
[44:52] afraid i might kill mommy
[44:57] what kind of spirit would tell a kid
[44:58] that
[45:00] that's not the spirit of
[45:02] god and so we have to be discerning of
[45:06] every spirit the bible says
[45:08] believe believe not every spirit but try
[45:12] every but try the spirit and i know if
[45:14] you continue reading it talks about
[45:16] false prophets have come into the land
[45:18] but it says try every spirit
[45:21] amen
[45:22] now brother brown continues saying why
[45:24] it used to be when i was a kid if the
[45:27] neighbor got sick
[45:28] while we went over there and coat wood
[45:30] for them and and help them fill the silo
[45:32] cut their corn and mama would go down
[45:35] and wash up the kids and get their
[45:37] breakfast for them when somebody was
[45:38] sick but now you don't even know your
[45:40] neighbor is dead unless you're dead you
[45:42] read in the paper there's no feeling the
[45:44] bible said because iniquity
[45:46] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[45:48] there it is why when my daddy would need
[45:50] 50 he'd go over and borrow it from the
[45:53] farmer friend he'd pay him back when
[45:54] he's he sold the crop while you couldn't
[45:57] borrow five dollars now without a 50
[45:59] security that's right no feeling no
[46:01] trust god have mercy on a people falling
[46:03] away
[46:04] and he continues saying affection love
[46:07] for one another that's right
[46:09] they go around here not long ago
[46:11] you go downtown you see somebody and
[46:13] instead of saying howdy do or something
[46:15] like that they just pass a little silly
[46:17] grin
[46:18] look over there like a possum that's
[46:20] been in a blackberry patch somewhere
[46:22] [Laughter]
[46:25] looking over like that
[46:26] you
[46:27] you know just a little old silly grin
[46:32] hello maybe like that oh you know what i
[46:34] like i like an old-fashioned pump handle
[46:36] handshake
[46:38] amen what happened to that
[46:41] i haven't seen a good whole
[46:43] handshake in a year and a half
[46:48] but hey look if you don't want to
[46:50] honestly if you don't i'll respect that
[46:53] but just telling you that's how i feel
[46:56] amen because i'm not going to fear this
[46:58] thing i'm not going to fear the devil
[46:59] i'm not going to fear jesus amen to make
[47:01] somebody else happy
[47:05] amen
[47:07] john 15 10
[47:09] tells us again going back to
[47:11] going back to
[47:14] what we were reading at the beginning
[47:15] john 15 10 if you keep my commandments
[47:18] ye shall abide in my love
[47:21] even as i have kept my father's
[47:23] commandments and abide in his love
[47:26] amen now
[47:32] let's look at let's look at the
[47:33] commandments here just a moment we know
[47:35] that in the even in the ten commandments
[47:37] with it that that the lord gave to moses
[47:40] amen in exodus chapter 20
[47:43] verses one through six it says in god
[47:45] spake all these words saying and you can
[47:47] read on down
[47:49] and then in verse six
[47:51] it says and showing mercy unto thousands
[47:54] of them that love me and keep my
[47:57] commandments
[47:58] amen so god was concerned about about
[48:01] about love and you can read the whole
[48:03] commandments there as well as in
[48:05] deuteronomy chapter 5
[48:07] verses 6 through 10. but now jesus comes
[48:10] in in mark chapter 12 and he talks about
[48:13] the greatest commandment
[48:14] because it's asked of him lord what is
[48:17] the greatest commandment
[48:19] and and let's read this here real quick
[48:21] in mark chapter 12 i told you we're
[48:23] going to do a lot of reading so just
[48:24] bear with me mark chapter 12
[48:27] verse 28 and one of the scribes came and
[48:29] haven't heard them reasoning together
[48:32] and perceiving that he had answered them
[48:34] well asked him which is the first
[48:37] commandment of all
[48:38] and jesus answered him the first of all
[48:40] the commandments is hero israel the lord
[48:43] our god is one lord
[48:46] and thou shalt love the lord thy god
[48:48] with all thy heart and with all thy soul
[48:52] and with all thy mind and with all thy
[48:55] strength
[48:56] this is the first commandment
[48:58] and then he continues and says and the
[49:00] second is like namely this thou shalt
[49:03] love thy neighbor as thyself
[49:07] and then he says there is none other
[49:08] commandment
[49:10] greater than these
[49:13] he didn't go mentioning you know thou
[49:15] shalt not steal thou shalt not amen
[49:17] because if you have love in your heart
[49:19] you won't do those things
[49:21] he put those at the beginning because he
[49:24] knows if you have love amen the love of
[49:26] god if you love god the way you need to
[49:28] love god amen and you love your neighbor
[49:30] the way you won't steal you won't commit
[49:32] adultery you won't cheat you won't lie
[49:34] you won't do these things
[49:35] amen
[49:39] and verse in verse 32 and the scribe
[49:41] said unto him well master thou has saith
[49:44] the truth for there is one god and there
[49:46] is none other but he and to love him
[49:48] with all the heart and with all the
[49:50] understanding and with all the soul and
[49:52] with all the strength and to love his
[49:53] neighbor as his self is more than
[49:56] all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
[50:00] and when jesus saw that he answered
[50:02] discreetly
[50:03] i want you to notice this because look
[50:05] what he says he says
[50:07] and he said unto him thou art not far
[50:09] from the kingdom of god
[50:12] and no man after that there's ask him
[50:14] any question amen jesus tied this love
[50:17] amen to the kingdom of god
[50:19] this is part of the kingdom
[50:21] amen the love of god is part of the
[50:23] kingdom
[50:25] amen
[50:26] now let's look at
[50:28] let's look here just a moment at and we
[50:30] got a few more minutes i promise you i
[50:32] won't leave you here too long tonight
[50:35] let's look at some things here in john
[50:37] chapter 13. amen
[50:40] and i want you to look at there's some
[50:41] interesting points here in john chapter
[50:43] 13. we know that 13 represents a woman
[50:47] 13 apostles
[50:48] but had to be 12.
[50:52] amen uh so so when judas died and then
[50:56] matthias i think he was selected after
[50:58] after judas died there
[51:01] so it became 12. amen
[51:03] judas he we in this chapter we see judas
[51:06] he shows his true colors
[51:09] and we know that the u.s shows her true
[51:11] colors
[51:12] give herself completely over to the
[51:14] beast in revelations chapter 13.
[51:18] complete apostasy
[51:19] amen
[51:24] so this is all turning saints this is
[51:26] all eventually we'll turn to religious
[51:29] one to one man worship
[51:31] at some point in time
[51:33] at some point in time
[51:35] i don't know what all the details will
[51:36] be but at some point in time
[51:39] the uh antichrist is going to be make a
[51:42] a a a
[51:44] a pact with the jews and
[51:46] and and you we shouldn't be bad here at
[51:48] that time
[51:50] amen
[51:51] and everybody will wonder after the
[51:53] beast the bible says those that are not
[51:55] sealed upon their forehead
[51:58] so i want us to i want us to read john
[52:00] chapter 13 but we're gonna we're gonna
[52:03] read it and i just wanted to look at it
[52:05] verse by verse and and but i want us to
[52:08] read it here so that so that everybody
[52:10] can understand it i i tried to compare
[52:12] both from the king james version and the
[52:15] contemporary english version and
[52:18] everything seems to be following it's
[52:20] lined up so i want to read in the cv
[52:23] version the contemporary english version
[52:26] and uh
[52:27] let's look at this here so in verse in
[52:29] verse 1 it says
[52:31] it was before the it was before passover
[52:34] and jesus knew that the time had come
[52:37] for him to leave this world and to
[52:39] return to the father
[52:42] he had always loved his followers in
[52:44] this world and he loved them to the very
[52:46] end
[52:48] even before the evening meal started the
[52:50] devil had made judas the son of simon
[52:52] iscariot decide to betray jesus
[52:56] amen
[52:57] in the king james version it says in
[52:58] supper being ended the devil having now
[53:01] put into the heart of judas iscariot
[53:04] simon's son to betray him so now here we
[53:06] go we're talking about iniquity while
[53:08] ago
[53:09] and here comes amen iniquity coming into
[53:12] the heart
[53:13] of judas
[53:15] right so
[53:16] you know satan comes and sly
[53:18] he doesn't come in amen just he doesn't
[53:21] come in just like that because it'll be
[53:23] just too obvious
[53:25] he comes in very slightly he starts
[53:26] working with the heart because it's the
[53:29] deeds of the nickelodeons right
[53:32] that and it starts with the deeds
[53:35] or it starts with the saying there was a
[53:37] saying
[53:38] then it goes into the deeds
[53:41] eventually it gets in into the people's
[53:43] minds
[53:46] and so
[53:48] that's where that iniquity started amen
[53:49] so that true iniquity begins in the
[53:51] heart before it manifests outwardly amen
[53:54] what you know what about all these all
[53:56] the people leaving the message today
[54:02] what
[54:02] at some point in time they had something
[54:04] that was speaking to their heart
[54:07] some some seed of doubt
[54:10] crept in
[54:12] and eventually it manifested externally
[54:15] outwardly
[54:18] now now saints uh you know
[54:21] we're not the we we're not supposed to
[54:23] be the judges of anybody
[54:25] i've heard i heard even of a testimony
[54:27] here lately of someone that had
[54:29] supposedly left the message and then now
[54:31] they're back
[54:32] somewhere up north and they're serving
[54:34] the lord they they they're sorry that
[54:37] they did that they they repent so so we
[54:39] we really can't rule somebody out when
[54:41] they say i don't believe brother branham
[54:43] anymore we have to be careful with that
[54:46] because you're not the judge
[54:48] but now you know
[54:50] when you start pushing and pedaling
[54:53] amen to everybody when you're supposed
[54:54] to be doing your own thing going to
[54:56] church if you're so right
[54:59] and you're so just go to church serve
[55:01] the lord and let others serve the lord
[55:03] too
[55:04] but they they get on their on their on
[55:06] their marketing and and they got books
[55:08] and they got videos and and they're just
[55:10] busy 24 7. and that's all they do i
[55:13] don't even know if they spend time with
[55:14] their family i don't even know if they
[55:17] get to eat or go to the bathroom or
[55:19] anything because i mean they have a new
[55:21] publication every
[55:23] every day
[55:24] just about
[55:26] now there's something wrong then
[55:29] something's happened to you
[55:32] you've become a judas
[55:36] now verse three jesus knew he had come
[55:39] from god and would go back to god
[55:42] he also now i want you to pay attention
[55:44] to this he knew
[55:45] at this point
[55:47] at this point he knew that he had come
[55:49] from god and would go back to god he
[55:51] also knew that the father had given him
[55:54] complete power
[55:58] so watch so during the meal
[56:00] jesus got up
[56:02] verse 4
[56:03] removed his outer garment and wrapped a
[56:06] towel around his waist
[56:11] i want you to pay attention
[56:13] because a lot happened here in this
[56:14] chapter and it's similar to what's
[56:17] happening in our day in our day in time
[56:21] he put water into a large bowl then he
[56:23] began washing his disciples feet
[56:26] and drying them
[56:28] with the towel he was wearing
[56:31] man what a great act of humility
[56:35] the master the king of kings the creator
[56:38] of the universe
[56:39] the one who created the disciples the
[56:42] created judas
[56:45] created their souls
[56:49] he got down
[56:50] to wash the disciples dirty feet
[56:55] and told us that that should be an
[56:57] example for each one of us
[57:00] he really loved them
[57:05] now
[57:06] that within itself is not just for us
[57:09] when we do
[57:11] foot washing
[57:12] but it was a it was a
[57:14] it was a lesson that jesus was trying to
[57:16] teach us that if we do love one another
[57:19] that was the way you say you love god
[57:21] and the way you say you love your
[57:22] brother amen what would you not would
[57:25] you really give up your life for your
[57:27] friends
[57:28] would you really give up your life for
[57:30] your brother would you really give up
[57:31] your life for your sister
[57:33] if you if you've really received a
[57:35] revelation in your heart that that's
[57:37] your brother and that's your sister
[57:40] you would humble yourself
[57:42] and you would not do anything amen to
[57:44] hurt amen that their their trust their
[57:48] uh their uh
[57:50] you know of who they are because you
[57:52] know they're part of the same body you
[57:53] belong to
[57:55] if we start looking at each other that
[57:56] way
[57:58] my goodness that would we would go we
[58:00] would go so far in this walk with christ
[58:03] amen
[58:06] see he knew he had this power all power
[58:10] was given to him and yet he still
[58:12] humbled himself
[58:14] to wash their feet i just want us to
[58:16] think about that
[58:17] because the scriptures here don't put
[58:19] that there just to have that there that
[58:22] he knew that he had power and that all
[58:25] everything belonged to him and then he
[58:26] goes and washed his feet
[58:29] one of the lowest things that you could
[58:30] do at that time
[58:32] you know to be a foot washed
[58:34] flunky to watch the dirty manure and the
[58:37] sweat coming off the streets and
[58:39] everything like that
[58:41] amen
[58:42] you can just imagine
[58:44] the smell and everything
[58:46] jesus just
[58:47] nobody told him did he just
[58:49] just did it amen
[58:52] now the word humility let's look at the
[58:54] word humility real quick it says it
[58:56] means the quality or condition of being
[58:58] humble
[59:00] the state or character of being humble
[59:03] freedom from pride and arrogance
[59:07] lowliness of mind
[59:09] a low estimate of oneself self-abasement
[59:14] when you when you look at yourself amen
[59:16] in a low state
[59:18] amen that you're not bigger than
[59:20] somebody else you're not better than
[59:21] somebody else
[59:22] amen then your humility is working in
[59:24] you
[59:25] but when you think you're better and
[59:27] bigger than somebody else
[59:30] god's got to do some work in your life
[59:35] and watch where and then the other thing
[59:37] is it's an act of submission
[59:40] that's what humility is you submit
[59:43] jesus submitted himself to the disciples
[59:47] when he was their master
[59:50] he was their their lord he was their
[59:53] rabbi he was their god
[59:56] he didn't ask for their permission he
[59:58] just went and did it
[1:00:00] and he did it with all his heart because
[1:00:02] he really loved them i want us to
[1:00:05] remember that love love love love that's
[1:00:08] all part of the kingdom
[1:00:10] that's what we're talking about that's
[1:00:12] the law of christ
[1:00:14] amen
[1:00:15] now continuing in verse six
[1:00:18] it was just a few more minutes but when
[1:00:20] he came to simon peter this disciple
[1:00:22] asked
[1:00:23] lord are you going to wash my feet
[1:00:27] so peter asked him are you going to wash
[1:00:28] my feet jesus answered you don't really
[1:00:31] know what i am doing but later you will
[1:00:34] understand
[1:00:36] and in verse 8 you will never wash my
[1:00:38] feet peter replied
[1:00:40] you're not going to wash my feet
[1:00:43] just like some of us you know
[1:00:44] we think we know better than jesus
[1:00:49] you ain't washing my feet because you
[1:00:51] think you're doing a good deed
[1:00:54] if jesus said in his word if he knows
[1:00:56] better than you
[1:00:59] it's best to you just let him do what he
[1:01:00] wants
[1:01:02] a a a a lamb a man a sheep my sheep hear
[1:01:06] my voice the bible says
[1:01:08] a lamb submits
[1:01:10] a goat kicks and butts
[1:01:13] right
[1:01:15] so whatever god wants to do with us amen
[1:01:18] just let them
[1:01:20] lord uh uh just do with me whatever you
[1:01:22] want to do and and peter eventually
[1:01:25] caught on to it then because watch what
[1:01:27] he says in verse 9 peter said lord don't
[1:01:29] wash just my feet
[1:01:32] wash my hands and my head now now jesus
[1:01:34] before that he says and if i don't wash
[1:01:36] you jesus told him you don't really
[1:01:38] belong to me
[1:01:40] that's what he told them
[1:01:45] in other words if you don't let me do
[1:01:46] what i know it's best and you don't
[1:01:49] really belong to me
[1:01:51] so peter said lord don't wash just my
[1:01:53] feet wash my hands in my head too
[1:01:56] just all right lord just i'm all in then
[1:01:59] amen that's why we should all be just
[1:02:01] all in
[1:02:02] let god and let god let go and let god
[1:02:04] have his way in our lives
[1:02:08] jesus answered people who have bathed
[1:02:11] and are clean all over need to what need
[1:02:14] to wash just their feet
[1:02:17] right he was talking about a a a
[1:02:20] physical bathing right
[1:02:22] they just need to wash their feet
[1:02:24] when they come in and you know if they
[1:02:26] bathe at home they've walked from one
[1:02:27] place to another and then when they get
[1:02:29] there all they need to do is just wash
[1:02:31] their feet that's what jesus was talking
[1:02:32] about but watch what he says here and
[1:02:34] you my disciples are clean except for
[1:02:37] one of you now he's turning into
[1:02:39] spiritual
[1:02:43] because remember they were they were
[1:02:45] justified sanctified
[1:02:48] under the word of jesus
[1:02:50] right
[1:02:51] you are now amen uh
[1:02:53] by the washington of the water of the
[1:02:55] word the word that they received amen
[1:02:56] for three and a half years during jesus
[1:02:58] ministry amen it justified and
[1:03:01] sanctified them
[1:03:04] jesus said at one point he said sanctify
[1:03:06] sanctify them by the by thy truth thy
[1:03:08] word is truth
[1:03:11] amen
[1:03:12] in verse 11 jesus knew who would betray
[1:03:15] him
[1:03:16] that is why he said except for one of
[1:03:18] you
[1:03:19] one of you right now is unclean one of
[1:03:21] you has a devil one of you not just has
[1:03:24] a devil in one place he said it is a
[1:03:26] devil
[1:03:28] in matthew chapter 10
[1:03:30] and verse 12
[1:03:31] after jesus had washed his disciples
[1:03:34] feet and had put his outer garment back
[1:03:36] on he sat down again then he said do you
[1:03:40] understand what i have done
[1:03:42] and i want to ask you that do you
[1:03:44] understand what
[1:03:46] what he has done
[1:03:48] or are we just floaters
[1:03:50] we just come to church
[1:03:52] we just do what we're supposed to do and
[1:03:55] but we don't know exactly this plan of
[1:03:57] redemption for ourselves
[1:04:00] do you
[1:04:02] because we need to
[1:04:04] if we're to have the love of god in us
[1:04:06] amen we need to know what redemption is
[1:04:07] about
[1:04:09] we need to get saved and get born again
[1:04:12] if we're going to have the love of god
[1:04:13] in us
[1:04:14] do you understand jesus wanted them to
[1:04:16] understand what i just did to them and
[1:04:18] that was the foot washing so it's
[1:04:20] important for jesus for you to
[1:04:22] understand what he has done for you what
[1:04:25] he did on the cross
[1:04:26] what does that mean
[1:04:27] the significance of that
[1:04:30] all those things that we easily can take
[1:04:32] for granted
[1:04:34] if we're not careful
[1:04:37] jesus says in verse 13. i hope you're
[1:04:38] still with me amen
[1:04:41] you call me your teacher and lord and
[1:04:44] you should
[1:04:45] because that is who i am
[1:04:47] and if your lord and teacher has washed
[1:04:49] your feet you should do the same for
[1:04:51] each other
[1:04:53] and that's where we get the commandment
[1:04:54] for us to actually do it doing it
[1:04:57] that's where we do it physically
[1:04:59] you see
[1:05:00] it's not that that it it's an act of
[1:05:03] humility but it also brings us back to
[1:05:05] what jesus did
[1:05:07] amen it doesn't doesn't doesn't wash us
[1:05:09] of our sins or anything like that but
[1:05:11] it's you amen saying i believe what
[1:05:13] jesus i understand what jesus did
[1:05:16] amen and now this symbol is symbolizing
[1:05:20] amen what i need to be doing every day
[1:05:25] not just the day we come and wash our
[1:05:26] feet
[1:05:30] you see
[1:05:31] i i should be willing again we were
[1:05:33] reading i believe it was in galatians to
[1:05:35] be able to carry one another's burden
[1:05:39] you know
[1:05:41] if your bird and brother boyd is your
[1:05:43] feet are dirty amen let me see what i
[1:05:44] can do about that
[1:05:48] i don't know if i'll you know
[1:05:50] go ahead and
[1:05:51] pedicure and everything if you need it
[1:05:54] [Laughter]
[1:05:56] or your wife can take care of that
[1:06:01] but you look at each other and you see
[1:06:03] you know
[1:06:04] as
[1:06:05] as in the bible it says you know how how
[1:06:08] what kind of person would you be if you
[1:06:10] see a brother in need and you just just
[1:06:12] pat him on the back and you say you just
[1:06:13] go on
[1:06:14] go on brother go on sister lord bless
[1:06:17] you you see that they're in need
[1:06:20] and you just
[1:06:22] i'll pray for you but you forget to
[1:06:27] is that carrying your brother's burden
[1:06:30] is that is that carrying your sister's
[1:06:31] burden
[1:06:33] oh my
[1:06:36] you see it goes it goes further
[1:06:39] than just you know
[1:06:41] you just think about those things
[1:06:47] okay verse 14 if your lord and teacher
[1:06:49] has washed your feet you should do the
[1:06:51] same for each other i have set the
[1:06:53] example and you should do for each other
[1:06:56] exactly what i have done for you god
[1:06:58] help us
[1:07:00] god help us to to serve one another in
[1:07:03] this way i tell you for certain that
[1:07:05] servants are not greater than their
[1:07:08] master and messengers are not greater
[1:07:10] than the one who sent them
[1:07:13] and you see in the world there's
[1:07:14] positions there's ranks
[1:07:17] there's the masters and there's the ones
[1:07:19] that serve those masters and but jesus
[1:07:21] is trying to tell them here he just he
[1:07:24] pretty much just kind of threw a little
[1:07:25] curveball at them amen
[1:07:27] in other words to tell on them think
[1:07:28] about what i just now did
[1:07:31] i am your master i am your creator you
[1:07:33] call me lord and so i am and yet i got
[1:07:36] down to do this for you
[1:07:39] he wanted them to think
[1:07:40] because later he said that you won't
[1:07:42] understand it now but you'll understand
[1:07:44] later
[1:07:45] amen verse 17 you know these things
[1:07:48] and god will bless you if you do them in
[1:07:50] in in the king james verses are happy
[1:07:52] are you if you do these things
[1:07:55] amen
[1:07:56] and verse 18
[1:07:58] it says i am not talking about all of
[1:07:59] you i know the ones i have chosen
[1:08:02] but what the scriptures say must come
[1:08:04] true and they say the man who ate with
[1:08:07] me has turned against me
[1:08:10] that's what the scriptures say
[1:08:16] so he's talking about jesus he's talking
[1:08:18] about judas there
[1:08:20] now we're almost done we just got just a
[1:08:22] few more things and he's talking about
[1:08:23] judas now let's look at judas for just a
[1:08:25] moment
[1:08:26] judas was was was with him for three and
[1:08:29] a half years and saw the miracles
[1:08:32] he cast out devils maybe healed the sick
[1:08:34] and and all those things he had power to
[1:08:37] do those things as god as jesus gave
[1:08:39] them
[1:08:41] but
[1:08:42] notice he did not he did not eat jesus
[1:08:47] he ate with jesus but did not eat him
[1:08:51] he didn't think of him as the bread of
[1:08:53] life that he was
[1:08:57] amen
[1:09:00] because that's what jesus said the man
[1:09:01] who ate with me has turned against me
[1:09:03] there's so many people that have eaten
[1:09:05] with jesus
[1:09:08] have been in the message
[1:09:10] have lived in this word have rejoiced in
[1:09:13] it have enjoyed the good word
[1:09:16] and then turn against him
[1:09:18] later on
[1:09:20] and by turning and by them turning
[1:09:22] against you they're turning against god
[1:09:25] amen in hebrews chapter 6 verse 4
[1:09:27] through 6 it says for it is impossible
[1:09:29] for those who were once enlightened it
[1:09:32] is
[1:09:32] impossible
[1:09:34] it is impossible for those who are once
[1:09:36] enlightened have tasted of the heavenly
[1:09:38] gift tasted and were made partakers of
[1:09:41] the holy ghost
[1:09:43] and have tasted the good word of god and
[1:09:45] and the powers of the world to come if
[1:09:47] they shall fall away to renew them again
[1:09:50] unto repentance in other words if they
[1:09:52] fall away it's impossible to renew them
[1:09:55] back to repentance
[1:09:59] seeing they crucified to themselves the
[1:10:01] son of god afresh and put him to an open
[1:10:03] shame
[1:10:05] and we see that a lot going on
[1:10:07] now the last two verses here in john
[1:10:09] chapter 13 i am telling you this before
[1:10:11] it all happens jesus says
[1:10:13] then when it does happen you will
[1:10:15] believe who i am
[1:10:17] i tell you for certain that anyone who
[1:10:19] welcomes my messengers also welcomes me
[1:10:22] and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the
[1:10:24] one who sent me
[1:10:27] amen
[1:10:28] and we'll just leave it right there and
[1:10:30] we will continue because i got plenty of
[1:10:32] more content
[1:10:34] this all ties in very well with other
[1:10:37] things
[1:10:38] maybe
[1:10:39] next time we minister
[1:10:42] but it's important saints amen to abide
[1:10:44] by the law of christ
[1:10:48] because listen
[1:10:49] god jesus said this commandment i give
[1:10:51] you this new commandment i give you
[1:10:54] now he's not doing away with his
[1:10:56] commandments
[1:10:57] but this is the commandment i give you
[1:10:58] get love
[1:11:01] love and you'll be able to fulfill it
[1:11:03] with all the other ones
[1:11:05] amen he was not doing away with the
[1:11:06] commandments he was bringing in amen the
[1:11:09] only thing that you have to worry about
[1:11:11] is loving one another
[1:11:13] loving him loving one another that's
[1:11:15] what he said
[1:11:17] but it's one of the most toughest things
[1:11:19] to do
[1:11:22] especially amongst the family
[1:11:24] sometimes even with things the family is
[1:11:27] hard
[1:11:29] but if you can't even love your own
[1:11:31] family members how are you going to love
[1:11:32] the brother that goes to church
[1:11:37] you're always fighting and bickering
[1:11:39] amongst one another in within the family
[1:11:42] how are you not going to do that in the
[1:11:44] church
[1:11:47] amen things to think about
[1:11:49] i like throwing little curveballs like
[1:11:50] that make y'all think
[1:11:53] i hope it helps because you know it's
[1:11:55] the little foxes that spoil the vine
[1:11:57] that we neglect
[1:11:59] i mean we can explain daniel 70 weeks
[1:12:01] and everything that's wonderful we need
[1:12:03] all of that but then these little things
[1:12:05] we neglect
[1:12:07] and they all tie in together right it's
[1:12:09] not like they're separated from each
[1:12:11] other they all tie in
[1:12:12] i'm just maybe sent here to to kind of
[1:12:14] throw the little curve balls to you
[1:12:18] but god help us amen god help us so
[1:12:22] let's stand to our
[1:12:34] feet are you saying this song uh created
[1:12:37] me a clean heart
[1:12:40] i don't know

[1:12:47] we leave

[1:12:56] something to think about
[1:12:58] oh buddy

[1:13:01] feelings that's not what i want that's
[1:13:03] certainly the word hurts i mean that's
[1:13:05] the word then
[1:13:06] but uh that wasn't my intention i just i
[1:13:09] just really i want us to look at
[1:13:12] ourselves as that's just so impressed me
[1:13:15] this this week
[1:13:16] you know the love that we have for one
[1:13:19] another is waning cold
[1:13:22] that we just so quickly just insult one
[1:13:25] another and instead of feeling for one
[1:13:27] another
[1:13:28] you know we just quickly just say things
[1:13:30] and
[1:13:31] you know and
[1:13:33] in such
[1:13:35] you know
[1:13:36] where's the love
