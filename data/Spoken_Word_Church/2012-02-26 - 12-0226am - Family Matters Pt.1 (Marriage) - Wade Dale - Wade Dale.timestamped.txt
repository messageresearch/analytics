[2:03] a man say one time the greatest thing
[2:04] he'd ever heard old farmer preacher done

[2:45] the Eyes of My Heart and the way he
[2:47] comes to his ministering the word unto
[2:49] his estate
[2:59] I want to see
[3:09] don't put in the Eyes of My Heart
[3:44] I everything
[3:54] your power
[4:09] is Holy
[4:13] holy
[4:22] you want to see him I hope he didn't
[4:24] come to see me today I hope you came to
[4:26] see him
[4:27] for him to be an active participant in
[4:29] this service not just a bystander as we
[4:32] always say that because there's going to
[4:34] be bystanders to record what we're
[4:36] saying but we want God Almighty to be
[4:38] the active participant in the service
[4:40] and if you brought him with you then you
[4:43] must be the active participant in the
[4:45] service right all right there's not a
[4:47] separation right brother Richard there's
[4:49] no separation it's urine you ain't got
[4:51] in there together as personally amen you
[4:54] love the Lord amen well finally
[4:57] this is the Sunday
[5:00] I was going to fool all of you and wear
[5:02] blue jeans and a and a T-shirt and let
[5:05] you guess again
[5:07] but brother Chris got the Revelation and
[5:09] he decided to dress up
[5:13] he might be able to help me this
[5:15] afternoon so you got your Bibles let's
[5:18] go ahead and start I know the ones of
[5:20] you that were at the uh
[5:22] um
[5:23] my enrichment ceremony or Valentine's
[5:26] banquet that we had you kind of got a
[5:29] little snippet of what was gonna what I
[5:32] was going to bring but
[5:33] I want to kind of give you a just kind
[5:35] of a little background I had been
[5:37] thinking about this actually since about
[5:39] probably uh when we went to Kansas
[5:42] hunting kind of sitting on the deer
[5:44] stand you know thinking about things and
[5:47] thinking about life and and you know
[5:49] Dad's been through this many many times
[5:51] but we got a lot of new ones
[5:53] that maybe have not heard it and I
[5:55] surely am not gonna I'm not going to to
[5:59] go into the wisdom of it like he has
[6:01] because he's been around a lot longer
[6:02] than I have
[6:03] but maybe by now being married to the
[6:06] same woman for 32 years I've learned
[6:08] some things
[6:10] a lot of things
[6:12] and maybe we are able to since since our
[6:17] life has been full and Rich that maybe
[6:19] we can help you have your life make your
[6:22] life full and Rich because that you know
[6:24] God doesn't want us to be separate
[6:26] that's right we're going to find out and
[6:28] go through the scriptures that that God
[6:31] fully expected us to be man and woman
[6:34] amen what a surprise in the garden he
[6:37] actually separated us to have fellowship
[6:39] with each other husband and wife
[6:41] man and woman all right but there's
[6:43] institutions that come in of marriage
[6:45] and of things that I mean covenants that
[6:48] comes in and vows and we're just going
[6:51] to try to break that down and and read
[6:53] it now to First Peter 3 kind of First
[6:55] Peter 3 kind of covers from one to seven
[6:57] covers the whole a scope of of what
[7:01] we're going to be speaking on and and
[7:03] just bear with me and and bear with them
[7:05] in the back we got a lot of quotes and
[7:07] we got a lot of scripture so
[7:08] Tim asked me was I going to move around
[7:11] a little bit well maybe not so much
[7:12] because we're going to read what the
[7:14] prophet has to say and like Dad said
[7:17] this is not this honestly this was not
[7:20] done because of one person or one
[7:22] situation now I've been thinking about
[7:24] this since November and and just kind of
[7:27] run it over in my mind and and reading
[7:29] in that book of courtship and marriage
[7:31] and all that that brother put out in
[7:33] Canada and he just kind of sparked an
[7:35] interest to go back through and and just
[7:37] kind of go over because I'm going to
[7:39] read you quote in a minute where brother
[7:40] Branham says without
[7:43] without these primary
[7:47] primary yeah primer he calls them
[7:50] without these basic things you are not
[7:53] going to understand Heavenly things okay
[7:56] and I was telling them this week I said
[7:57] we don't want to we don't want to
[7:59] spiritualize this thing let's don't go
[8:00] up in the clouds
[8:03] clouds I know we're supposed to commune
[8:05] with the Lord I know the Lord's always
[8:06] with us but you see your life your wife
[8:09] and your family more than you see Jesus
[8:12] you live with your family come on Amen
[8:15] let's just be honest I get a visitation
[8:17] from God just every once in a while yeah
[8:19] but I got to go to home to my wife every
[8:21] day I gotta deal with problems in my
[8:23] family every day I gotta deal with
[8:25] problems in my life every day so you can
[8:27] think about Christ in the church if you
[8:29] want to but we got to get past this guy
[8:30] right here
[8:31] right here's where it starts right now
[8:33] we're gonna we're gonna take in and use
[8:35] some spiritual applications but but
[8:37] don't go off in the heavenlies no we got
[8:40] problems right here right you know
[8:42] brother Brown said one time or somebody
[8:43] made a quote then and sometimes we're so
[8:45] heavily minded or no earthly good and
[8:48] then we're so Earthly minded we're no
[8:50] heavily good so there must be a balance
[8:52] in there somewhere Laurie that we can
[8:54] live and be honorable and and you know
[8:57] we're going to find out some things
[8:58] maybe that you didn't know
[9:00] but this is the way we're gonna do it
[9:01] we're going to call it Family Matters
[9:04] not Family Matters Family Matters
[9:09] the Family Matters
[9:11] part one is going to be marriage part
[9:13] two will be roll of the male part three
[9:15] will be role of the female so we're
[9:16] gonna
[9:17] separate it part four is going to be
[9:20] family all right so we start in First
[9:23] Peter 3 verse one and while you read it
[9:26] in the uh King James version I'm going
[9:28] to read it in the in emphatic dog life
[9:32] because it brings out a few more things
[9:33] that uh
[9:35] maybe the
[9:37] the King James version does not so let's
[9:40] just think about natural lives
[9:42] will use some spiritual applications and
[9:45] we know this all goes to Christ in the
[9:46] church but if we can't live together as
[9:49] husband and wife nurture each other and
[9:51] grow as a family you can forget
[9:54] you can forget about being married to
[9:56] Christ right all right all right amen
[9:59] all right amen all right chapter three
[10:03] of First Peter let's pray before we
[10:05] start dear heavenly father we lord you
[10:08] know in our heart that we when we sat
[10:10] down last night
[10:12] it was a presence coming through
[10:17] that I hadn't felt in a long time
[10:19] I wanted to know if this was right
[10:22] and I think you confirmed it
[10:26] thank you Lord for our families
[10:28] thank you for our church family
[10:30] thank you for all the things you've done
[10:31] for us you've done so much for us even
[10:33] though we didn't want it to be done you
[10:36] just overflowed us with grace and mercy
[10:38] and and that's what we're going to try
[10:39] to not be so hard Lord and but we're
[10:42] going to see how that you instituted
[10:44] many things that we're supposed to do
[10:45] and and and it's not do's and don'ts but
[10:48] it's out of love
[10:50] and how love came together and brought
[10:53] us into the Garden of Eden and how that
[10:55] that Satan came in and separated us and
[10:58] Lord he's trying to do that again he's
[11:00] trying to separate the very Foundation
[11:01] of of marriage and vows and things on
[11:04] the earth Lord and Satan is so deluded
[11:07] and and perverted the things that we're
[11:10] supposed to hold most sacred
[11:12] and that's our lives and our families
[11:14] and our wives and our husbands and our
[11:16] children Lord and also our church family
[11:19] Lord made this series bring us all
[11:21] together and one is you as you were one
[11:24] Lord you and Christ one Lord may we all
[11:28] be one and the same you prayed that
[11:31] prayer in John 17 Lord that we may be
[11:33] one with you like you are with the
[11:35] father
[11:36] we pray now Lord that she would
[11:37] strengthen us give us the mind of Christ
[11:39] and the knowledge
[11:41] to be able to speak the words that you
[11:44] want spoken Lord to be an active
[11:46] participant Lord in this service not to
[11:47] be a bystander but Lord take over and
[11:49] have preeminence in all of our lives and
[11:51] our hearts bless us and be with us Lord
[11:54] that we not say anything that would
[11:56] hinder Spirit Lord not say anything that
[11:58] will hinder you father but that we will
[12:00] be obedient children and not bash their
[12:03] children and not want to change anymore
[12:05] and not want to to do the right thing
[12:07] Lord because you told us we were that if
[12:10] we weren't able to change that we were
[12:11] just Pastor children
[12:13] father that's a hard statement but it's
[12:15] the truth we want to be obedient
[12:17] children Lord to be changed into your
[12:19] image father
[12:20] bless us today Lord let us be better
[12:22] husbands and better wives let us be
[12:25] better children and better servants for
[12:26] you father
[12:27] we ask your blessings Lord and the
[12:29] people that are listening that they will
[12:31] listen attentively and and be Lord
[12:35] active participants also in the service
[12:37] Lord to give Glory To You Lord if we
[12:40] were at a ball game and our favorite
[12:42] team was winning we'd be shouting and
[12:44] and glory and and here we are with
[12:47] eternal life being spoken and we just
[12:49] sit and sleep father I pray that you
[12:51] just make us quick enough make us more
[12:54] alive Lord to you father not the things
[12:57] of the world
[12:58] father just give us of your Holy Spirit
[13:00] today bless us and keep us we love you
[13:02] in Jesus name amen
[13:05] all right chapter three I'm going to
[13:06] read the dog lot
[13:08] you just read along there
[13:10] my brother didn't walk by me the other
[13:11] day and said how in the world can you
[13:12] see this well it's kind of hard
[13:15] especially when your contacts are wet
[13:18] all right let's read first Peter
[13:21] 3 verse 1.
[13:23] in life manner let wives be subject to
[13:26] their own husbands
[13:28] so that if some are disobedient
[13:31] to the word
[13:32] they may without a word be gained
[13:35] through the conduct of their wives
[13:39] we're gonna re-quote them a minute you
[13:41] wise hold of hold a very sacred part in
[13:43] this whole thing
[13:45] having seen your conduct chased with
[13:48] fear
[13:49] are chased or clean
[13:52] whose decorations let it not be
[13:55] that external one of braiding of the
[13:58] hair and putting on of gold chains or
[14:00] wearing of apparel
[14:02] but decorate the hidden man of the heart
[14:04] amen with what is
[14:07] incorruptible
[14:09] a Meek and quiet Spirit which is very
[14:13] precious in the sight of God
[14:16] for thus formerly also those holy women
[14:18] who hoped in God adorned themselves
[14:21] being subject to their own husbands
[14:23] right as Sarah obeyed Abram Abraham
[14:27] calling him Lord whose children you are
[14:30] become doing good and not fearing any
[14:34] Terror
[14:35] in light manner now here's going to be
[14:38] our our Focus right here in Lake Manor
[14:41] husbands dwell according to knowledge
[14:43] with the female as the weaker vessel
[14:46] yeah bestowing honor as being also
[14:50] listen to the dog light
[14:52] as being also joint heirs
[14:57] of the gracious Gift of Life
[15:00] in order that your prayers may not be
[15:03] hindered have you ever read that before
[15:05] I know in the marriage enrichment we
[15:06] were you know I read that that's going
[15:08] to be the whole theme of this thing the
[15:10] underlying thing do you read that again
[15:12] in order verse one through seven if you
[15:15] do this
[15:16] your prayers will not be hindered but if
[15:18] you don't
[15:21] that your prayers
[15:23] be not hindered your conduct between
[15:25] each one of us hinders our prayers to
[15:28] God right you sure I get all to think no
[15:31] you don't
[15:32] no you don't I was thinking this morning
[15:34] you'll be seated you know we always make
[15:37] that quote we live below our privileges
[15:39] we live below our privileges well you
[15:40] know what we've been saying that for 40
[15:42] years
[15:44] someday we're going to have to say we
[15:46] are now living our privileges man amen
[15:49] because if we don't and we keep saying
[15:51] that what are we going to do we're just
[15:52] saying a prophecy we're just prophesying
[15:54] right
[15:56] and that's going to put us
[15:58] in an early grade
[16:00] but there it says joint heirs and Peter
[16:03] join heirs
[16:05] see in the in the in the King James it
[16:07] just says being heirs
[16:09] but see join heirs
[16:10] because we're not doing heirs now
[16:13] husband
[16:15] has rule over the wife yeah
[16:19] everybody's Fanning so and I'm hot up
[16:22] here so you'll just have to bear link
[16:23] for a minute
[16:24] the first Peter 3 verse one through
[16:26] seven kind of brings everything together
[16:28] now
[16:30] let's look let's go to you're gonna have
[16:32] to get in your Bible though or you no
[16:33] you don't have to you can just you can
[16:34] read up here
[16:37] let's go to numbers 30 because
[16:39] everything starts with a vowel
[16:43] now marriage is a union between a man
[16:45] and a woman not a man and a man
[16:48] a woman right all right I hope we're
[16:50] totally beyond that
[16:52] but it starts with a promise or an oath
[16:55] or a vowel until death do you part now
[16:57] do we have to go back through that again
[16:59] I don't think so but in numbers 30
[17:03] verse 2 it says if a man bow down to the
[17:06] Lord a swearing oath to bind his soul
[17:08] with a bind he shall not break his word
[17:10] he shall do according to all that
[17:12] proceeded out of proceedeth out of his
[17:13] mouth
[17:14] if a woman also battle into the Lord and
[17:17] bind herself by a bond being in her
[17:18] father's house and her Youth and the
[17:20] reason I'm reading this because we're
[17:22] going to get to that
[17:23] I'm gonna have to bring some things
[17:24] together and I was telling the brothers
[17:26] that backstage back stay up back there
[17:28] back in the thing that I'm going to read
[17:30] some quotes two or three times because
[17:31] we're going to pick certain things out
[17:33] because we're going to stay today with
[17:35] marriage amen then we're going to break
[17:37] it down to the role of the mail break it
[17:39] down to the role of the female and then
[17:41] bring it back together as a family so
[17:43] we're going to be using sometimes the
[17:44] same quotes and the same scripture
[17:46] because right here this proves that the
[17:49] father is the head of the child as long
[17:52] as that child is at home all right so if
[17:55] and her father if a woman also bow down
[17:57] to the Lord
[17:59] being in her father's house in her youth
[18:03] and her father hear her vow and her bond
[18:05] when she has bound her soul and her
[18:07] father shall hold his peace then all her
[18:09] mouth shall stand and everybody she has
[18:12] binded bound her soul shall stand but if
[18:15] her father disallows her in the day that
[18:17] he hear it
[18:18] not six months not six years brother
[18:20] Dale's already been through this so we
[18:21] don't have to go through this again not
[18:23] any of her about Harvard bonds for which
[18:26] she had bound her soul shall stand and
[18:27] the Lord shall forgive her
[18:29] because her father disallowed that's
[18:31] what I told you before as long as the
[18:33] the boy as long as the girl is at home
[18:35] you're their Holy Ghost amen amen you're
[18:38] their circumcision they they come under
[18:40] the circumcision of the household of the
[18:42] male
[18:43] but the females can't be circumcised
[18:45] right all right now let's go to
[18:47] Deuteronomy 23
[18:50] these brothers got a boatload to do this
[18:52] morning
[18:52] so just bear with them
[18:58] all right listen to this
[19:00] thou shall not bring the higher of a
[19:02] or the price of a dog into the
[19:03] house of the Lord thy God for any vow
[19:05] see how safer this thing is for even
[19:08] both these are Abominations to the Lord
[19:10] thy God thou shall not land upon archery
[19:12] what is our three interest right telling
[19:16] brother Donnie this yesterday you're not
[19:17] supposed to charge the interest to your
[19:19] brother
[19:20] Christian r
[19:22] Christian are real brother you're not
[19:24] supposed to charge the interest no
[19:25] brother
[19:26] Nursery
[19:27] habituals anything you not you're what
[19:30] you're supposed to do is lend them the
[19:31] money or give them the money and don't
[19:33] expect nothing in return
[19:35] use usury of anything that is land upon
[19:38] Nursery
[19:39] unto a stranger though we got to make a
[19:42] living
[19:43] you can charge interest
[19:44] praise the Lord unto the stranger that
[19:47] Mass Land upon archery but unto thy
[19:49] brother thou shalt not lend Upon Our
[19:51] stream that the Lord thy God May bless
[19:53] thee now here's a blessing
[19:55] that the Lord thy God May bless thee and
[19:58] all that thou setestime hand into the
[20:00] lamb whether that goes to possess it
[20:01] look at verse 21 when thou shalt bow a
[20:04] vow unto the Lord thy God Thou shalt not
[20:07] slap
[20:08] to pay it for the Lord thy God will
[20:11] surely require of thee and it will be
[20:15] sin in other words if you don't do it
[20:16] right there is that okay it'll be sin if
[20:20] you don't do it exactly all right now go
[20:24] to Ecclesiastes five
[20:29] for a dream coming through the multitude
[20:31] of business and a Fool's voice is known
[20:33] by multitude of words not about that
[20:35] when thou violence of violence did God
[20:38] defer not to pay it
[20:40] for he have no pleasure in food
[20:43] pay that witch thou has fouled amen
[20:46] better is then that thou shouldest not
[20:48] even make the bow in other words
[20:50] than to make the bow and not keep it
[20:53] right same way with the vow of marriage
[20:56] amen the bow of marriage is the same way
[20:58] when you vow a vow yes until death do us
[21:02] part amen all right now I know I'm not
[21:04] going to get into marriage and divorce
[21:06] so don't get all squirmy
[21:07] because I know a lot of us have not kept
[21:09] that battle
[21:10] but that's between you and the Lord and
[21:12] I'm just telling you in a marriage that
[21:15] you're in right now we've got to deal
[21:18] with just I'm going to deal with them
[21:19] here that's brother Dale's part of the
[21:21] deal with American divorce not mine
[21:23] not yet anyway
[21:25] but that seems to be not mine and you
[21:28] know what
[21:29] we all have problems
[21:31] I always have problems with that so
[21:34] that's what Dad said there's no there's
[21:36] no one person we're pointing out no no
[21:39] one group or no I just want us to see
[21:42] what marriage is and and what it can be
[21:45] more you say well I have a good marriage
[21:47] do you
[21:50] do you have a good marriage does that
[21:53] marriage convert over into your
[21:57] relationship with God
[21:59] that's it because remember if your
[22:01] marriage is not right your prayers will
[22:03] be hindered then you say you're Superman
[22:05] I don't care who you say you are you eat
[22:07] tall buildings in a single bounce yeah
[22:10] I don't care the Bible says your prayers
[22:12] will be hindered exactly if you can't
[22:14] live with your wife or your husband
[22:17] in holy matrimony amen as unto the Lord
[22:20] now some of you I'm not there's no
[22:23] finger pointing to some of you that know
[22:24] what your wives are not here some of
[22:25] your husbands are not here
[22:27] I'm sorry this I'm just going to read
[22:29] you what the prophet said and I'm going
[22:30] to read you what the Bible said okay I'm
[22:33] not against nobody I love every one of
[22:34] you you know you should know that by now
[22:36] and this is this is not this is not a uh
[22:39] you know Regina Arline bashing or you
[22:41] know she don't care if I use her name
[22:43] I'm not bashing people I just want us to
[22:45] to realize right
[22:48] you know I was looking up the quote Val
[22:52] every time well 99.9 of the time brother
[22:55] Brown used the word bound he went to
[22:57] that woman
[22:58] remember the woman that committed
[23:01] adultery with the man while her husband
[23:03] was in service there's about 87 times he
[23:07] uses that story
[23:09] he said that got so deep he said into
[23:12] the Gable part of her soul yeah you know
[23:15] what a Gable is on a house he said it
[23:17] got into the Gable part of her soul and
[23:20] she forgot about it right
[23:22] and nobody could bring it out
[23:25] no he said no psychiatrists he said no
[23:28] drug
[23:29] nothing was going to bring that out
[23:31] except the Holy Spirit went back in her
[23:34] life saw that she had been untrue to her
[23:36] vow but remember her husband was also
[23:39] but she had left that get so far back
[23:43] that's right
[23:44] you know like Aaron said you know you
[23:45] got things in your house you hadn't used
[23:47] for seven years well you shouldn't you
[23:48] don't need them if they've been there
[23:49] for seven years you never used them yeah
[23:51] but what you do you just keep pushing
[23:53] boxes on top of boxes right what had
[23:55] happened she had she had let that go for
[23:58] so long until it had went so far back
[24:01] into her soul yeah
[24:03] because she forgot about it really
[24:05] so the Holy Spirit brought him back out
[24:07] remember what happened though she said
[24:09] you got to go tell him well he'll
[24:10] divorce me well he'd done the same thing
[24:12] to you so they come together brother
[24:13] Brown said they came together and become
[24:15] a very happy couple amen why they
[24:18] confess sin unconfessed sin is why we're
[24:20] still here right exactly Amen brother I
[24:24] ain't confessing is why we're still here
[24:26] amen all right
[24:28] I want to see if we can dig some of that
[24:30] out
[24:31] let's go to the very origin of marriage
[24:33] Genesis 1.
[24:36] my favorite scripture
[24:41] because you Bow Wow
[24:44] you better keep that vowel
[24:47] now listen
[24:50] brother Brown now this is what he said I
[24:53] just looked at it back there and I
[24:54] didn't have time to run it off
[24:55] brother Brown said one time a foolish
[24:57] King in the Bible made a vow
[25:01] now the Bible don't say it was a foolish
[25:02] King but brother Brown said it was a
[25:04] foolish King remember he said the first
[25:05] thing comes through my door I'll
[25:07] sacrifice remember it was his daughter
[25:09] he said now listen guys he said don't be
[25:11] making no foolish valve if you know
[25:14] better and you vowed anyway you've
[25:16] committed iniquity and we're gonna get
[25:17] to that
[25:18] you committed iniquity God's not going
[25:20] to hold you if you tell 14 women you're
[25:22] going to marry him
[25:27] thank you
[25:30] but which one you gotta have one true
[25:32] and you can't have 14 nothing's gonna
[25:34] happen
[25:35] but that's foolishness to walk up and
[25:37] say we're brother now I promised 14
[25:38] women on marry her marry them
[25:41] they're stupid sorry I don't use that
[25:44] word an office We're Not Gonna use it
[25:46] here that was foolish
[25:48] unless don't be foolish
[25:50] we bow about you better think about it
[25:53] amen and when you start up we start
[25:55] again to get to the family we're going
[25:57] to get into the young adults we're you
[25:58] Sisters You Remember You vow Val to that
[26:01] boy brother Brown says you're married
[26:02] right and that don't mean you can go off
[26:04] and live with them right no no no this
[26:06] is where that begins right here in the
[26:08] Pulpit all right we'll get all into all
[26:11] that and I found some quotes the other
[26:12] day that that that's really good but
[26:15] we'll get into that a little bit later
[26:16] God said let us make man in our image
[26:18] after our likeness and let them
[26:21] them
[26:22] have demand over the fish and see and
[26:24] follow the air cattle herb
[26:27] over every creeping thing that creepers
[26:29] upon the Earth right so God created man
[26:32] in his own image and the image of God
[26:33] created he him
[26:35] male and female created he them that's
[26:37] what he wanted amen you women are not a
[26:41] mistake right
[26:43] you were in the plan all along amen
[26:46] right right you were not a mistake
[26:49] you actually were created to reproduce
[26:53] amen
[26:54] I didn't uh verse 28 can y'all pull 28
[26:58] up if not I think I can just about quote
[26:59] it and be fruitful and multiply and
[27:02] replenish the Earth amen ask them do it
[27:04] that's right if you don't have it don't
[27:05] worry about it guys okay so why did he
[27:09] put us in
[27:10] this agreement to do
[27:13] to create
[27:15] or to procreate all right now we know it
[27:18] was supposed to be done by
[27:20] spoken word amen now let's go to Genesis
[27:23] 2 7.
[27:29] God didn't want us to stay in spirit
[27:31] by the fellowship with you want somebody
[27:34] to kill the ground
[27:36] because he says and the Lord God formed
[27:38] man of the Dust of the ground and
[27:39] breathing those noxles the Breath of
[27:40] Life a Man became a living soul
[27:43] God wasn't happy we just fellowshipping
[27:45] with Adam in spirit right right amen
[27:48] exactly good thing boy that would be
[27:50] great no this is what God wanted amen
[27:53] what do you think it is or not this is
[27:54] what God wanted God wanted to make a man
[27:57] with this right here on him right right
[27:59] and then put that that he wanted to
[28:01] fellowship with inside so he could talk
[28:03] to it all right
[28:05] now let's go to
[28:08] Genesis 2 18.
[28:13] and the Lord God said it is not good
[28:15] that the man should be alone because
[28:16] remember God created man for what
[28:18] Fellowship amen but now then the one he
[28:22] created
[28:24] not lonely yeah
[28:25] and he needed Fellowship amen
[28:29] what he had something inside of him they
[28:32] wanted fellowship and the Lord God said
[28:33] it is not good
[28:35] if a man should be alone I will make him
[28:37] a help me we'll get into that in just a
[28:39] little bit
[28:40] and out of the ground the Lord God
[28:42] formed every beast of the field and
[28:43] never found the air and brought them to
[28:46] Adam
[28:47] now I want you to keep this in your mind
[28:50] Adam had no fear whatsoever oh yeah on
[28:54] the face of this Earth amen he did not
[28:57] fear the leopard he did not fear the
[28:59] line right he did not fear the weather
[29:02] he did not fear tornadoes he did not
[29:05] fear earthquakes there was no fear in
[29:07] this man at this point in time exactly
[29:10] man he he plead Fellowship amen with the
[29:13] Almighty
[29:15] you said boy that's a long way out of
[29:17] the way I'll read you a quote in a
[29:18] minute and out of the ground the Lord
[29:19] God formed every beast in the field
[29:21] family and brought him to Adam
[29:24] so there was communication
[29:26] to see what he would call and whatsoever
[29:27] Adam called him that was it
[29:30] right look at the authority
[29:33] and Adam gave names to all the cattle
[29:35] and follow the air and every beast of
[29:37] the field right but for Adam that wasn't
[29:39] found to help me for him
[29:41] right and the Lord God caused the Deep
[29:43] Sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept
[29:45] he took one of his ribs and closed up
[29:47] the flesh instead thereof and the rim
[29:50] which the Lord God had taken from man
[29:51] made him woman
[29:53] and brought her unto man that's right
[29:56] and Adam said this is now bone of my
[29:59] bone and Flesh of My Flesh
[30:01] she shall be called woman
[30:04] because she was taken out of man right
[30:06] therefore shall a man leave
[30:10] leave his father and mother amen
[30:13] amen hello
[30:15] oh you parents say hallelujah
[30:19] therefore shall man leave his father and
[30:22] mother and shall cleave remember with
[30:25] that word cleave we'll look at in just a
[30:27] minute that word cleave in the
[30:29] in the translation that comes from
[30:31] English it's actually in the Hebrew it
[30:35] means glue
[30:37] g-l-u-e that's the word they use cleave
[30:40] in the Hebrew for the word cleave is
[30:44] glue
[30:45] right yeah therefore man shall leave his
[30:49] father mother and shall be glued
[30:51] that's right and through his wife
[30:53] and they shall be one flesh right now
[30:56] there's a lot of implications there you
[30:58] can go to where you know it talks about
[30:59] cleave
[31:00] because you can't come unclude go back
[31:03] to your mom and daddy you've got to stay
[31:04] glued to that wife
[31:08] and all the parents say hey man
[31:13] now look
[31:16] Adam didn't say
[31:18] she is now a lesser part of me and she
[31:21] is a separate person from me which all
[31:24] right hold on no
[31:26] she is actually a man given to Adam
[31:30] part of the man called a woman a man
[31:33] with a womb to reproduce himself right
[31:35] all right she shall be called woman her
[31:37] name wasn't even Eve her name was Adam
[31:39] right they were co-equal they were going
[31:42] there exactly together amen that's the
[31:46] first Covenant right all right because
[31:49] they're going to look at there's another
[31:50] there's a double Covenant got to come
[31:51] into this thing and that's why we're
[31:53] under the place we are now
[31:54] but still even in that single Covenant
[31:58] he wants you to get married yeah
[32:00] there's the first marriage vow right
[32:03] right Adam said
[32:05] and this is Adam Bowen Dave amen our
[32:07] woman
[32:09] this is now bone of my bone and Flesh of
[32:11] My Flesh and he named her
[32:14] no I didn't he named her woman amen
[32:16] right
[32:18] right because she was taking out a man
[32:19] therefore shall a man leave his father
[32:22] mother shall cleave unto his wife and
[32:24] they shall be
[32:26] one flesh all right now put up
[32:29] quotes one and two
[32:31] this is Brother Brown called This is the
[32:33] first marriage vow
[32:34] invisible Union of the Bride 1965
[32:41] . marriage was performed first and
[32:43] instituted
[32:45] in the Garden of Eden right now all the
[32:48] rest of this we're going to come back to
[32:49] this with the characteristics of the
[32:51] woman but let me read it
[32:53] because this is what Eve was entrusted
[32:56] with
[32:58] right
[33:00] we didn't change the characteristics of
[33:02] a woman right even after the fall
[33:08] a woman is entrusted with certain
[33:10] characters that she must not defile
[33:13] a woman is trusted to that now now a
[33:16] woman was trusted with that right
[33:18] capital W we're talking about the one
[33:20] standing beside of that right a woman is
[33:23] trusted to that there's not a creature
[33:24] on earth like woman there's no female
[33:26] dog no female of any kind trusted with
[33:29] the character that a woman is Right a
[33:31] woman was not even in the beginning of
[33:33] the creation because God know that she
[33:35] would fall all other females could not
[33:37] commit adultery amen she is the only one
[33:40] that can commit adultery if she had been
[33:42] made like the original that would have
[33:43] been this complementary
[33:45] to God's great wisdom right exactly
[33:49] pretty strong
[33:51] see she was made of byproduct of a man
[33:53] not a lesser form
[33:55] that's right but because she was cast
[33:58] over in that side in other words the
[34:00] fall right
[34:01] she has also been given a sacred charge
[34:03] from God for Redemption
[34:05] amen
[34:09] here we can spiritualize a little bit
[34:10] that's the reason Christ had a bride
[34:12] that's right Christ didn't need
[34:14] redeeming right right the bride needs
[34:17] redeeming amen but through her will come
[34:20] Redemption right
[34:22] but because she was cast over in that
[34:24] side she had been given a sacred charge
[34:26] from God for Redemption she's got
[34:29] characters that must not be defiled
[34:31] right if she would marry them she is
[34:33] defiled for a lifetime well see now he
[34:34] did the same thing or when she become me
[34:36] woman did the same thing no matter how
[34:39] much she is Forgiven she can't be
[34:40] justified right I'll strike that in a
[34:42] little bit got a scripture on that in a
[34:44] few minutes she can be forgiven for her
[34:46] defilement absolutely but she cannot be
[34:49] justified in other words she can't say
[34:51] no I'm a virgin
[34:52] she's had four men sorry she's not a
[34:55] virgin she's had one man she's not a
[34:56] virgin right all right I'm sorry I'm
[34:58] just gonna be playing she can be
[35:00] forgiven you can be forgiven in your
[35:02] slate white clean but you'll never
[35:04] forget it right right not in this life
[35:07] anyway exactly that's what we're working
[35:09] on this life right here we'll get to
[35:11] heaven I promise you but let's work on
[35:13] this one down here first amen amen not a
[35:15] script on that a few minutes she can be
[35:17] forgiven for her defilement but she
[35:19] cannot be justified in this life right
[35:21] it's always weather notice now she's
[35:23] been given this she may be forgiven
[35:26] but not justified Amanda right in other
[35:29] words
[35:34] men and women you give up your virginity
[35:37] and it's life exactly finished can't get
[35:40] it back okay I'm gonna read your quote
[35:42] here in just a few minutes
[35:44] my brother's around him said it doesn't
[35:45] matter if you've been married 60 years
[35:46] if you've never had just one husband and
[35:48] one wife he said you're just as pure as
[35:50] the day you're a virgin amen exactly
[35:52] even though you've had relations for 60
[35:54] years
[35:55] why because of this sacred wedding vow
[35:57] amen all right
[35:59] everybody okay amen
[36:02] now the first thing in the origin of
[36:05] marriage we saw now what God has done
[36:08] God has given man and woman to reproduce
[36:12] theirself that's right even
[36:15] before
[36:17] tax was involved right right
[36:19] spoken word that's what we got to come
[36:21] back to the spoken word all right which
[36:23] is the spiritual part which didn't
[36:25] happen but it was supposed to happen
[36:27] right that's what he's saying right here
[36:29] there's the battle the woman was given a
[36:31] a sacredness right
[36:33] that she was only supposed to be with
[36:35] Adam
[36:36] but Eve was found with
[36:40] committing adultery
[36:41] so that put her down in the Lesser form
[36:43] right all right but now
[36:46] just as God is going to restore
[36:48] everything else he's going to restore
[36:51] that right he's got to restore perfect
[36:53] Fellowship
[36:54] so God created us to what fellowship
[36:57] with him let's look at quote number
[36:58] three
[37:02] number three
[37:06] goal number three
[37:09] okay
[37:13] now let's read now they're okay they
[37:15] have a lot to do I give them about 10
[37:16] pages of quote so fellowship with God
[37:19] through reconciliation
[37:22] every nation is trying to get an atomic
[37:24] bomb now over room power to say all
[37:26] nations will bow to my
[37:28] you can't do it but God laid down a
[37:31] program in the beginning how that man
[37:33] can have Fellowship one with another
[37:36] and we'll have to come to God's terms on
[37:39] it that's all
[37:40] in the beginning when man used to walk
[37:42] in the early age with God in the Garden
[37:44] of Eden when first
[37:45] when the first Man was created in the
[37:47] great Cathedrals Under The Palms he and
[37:49] his wife
[37:52] when the cool of the evening come along
[37:54] they came out and worshiped God had a
[37:56] perfect Fellowship God Longs for
[37:59] Fellowship he learned he yearns he wants
[38:01] people to speak with him
[38:03] to talk with him he said you might do
[38:05] one thing you might do this too much of
[38:06] that too much but there's one thing you
[38:09] won't overdo and that's prayer amen
[38:11] that's the way you fellowship with God
[38:12] you commune with God through prayer all
[38:15] right
[38:16] talking with him excuse me and also
[38:20] brothers and sisters
[38:23] you can raise it you can go on if you
[38:24] want to
[38:27] you'll never be able to have too much
[38:29] fellowship with God Amen amen and got
[38:31] long fresh creature who he created in
[38:34] His image to fellowship with him
[38:35] wouldn't you love to have lived in that
[38:37] time when the Great Fellowship God had
[38:39] with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden
[38:41] to come down to the cool of the evening
[38:43] and talk with him and fellowship with
[38:45] them wouldn't that be marvelous we all
[38:47] would like to have that time now listen
[38:49] to this now I Believe by God's word I
[38:53] can prove to you that we can come right
[38:55] back on them turns again with God
[38:57] tonight
[38:59] not tomorrow not in glory not at the
[39:03] wedding supper he said tonight right
[39:05] straight back to that kind of Fellowship
[39:07] right so we established now let's go to
[39:11] Genesis 3
[39:15] in the garden
[39:18] and there was no fear
[39:20] right they walked straight up to
[39:23] almighty God and spoke to him because
[39:24] there was nothing in their mind there
[39:27] was nothing that had muddled their mind
[39:29] up their their bodies were they were
[39:31] naked
[39:33] but had no problem
[39:35] they were covered with what we said
[39:37] before brother Brown said they were
[39:38] covered with the Holy Ghost Veil amen
[39:42] Satan got to that Holy Ghost Veil and
[39:44] made it to the lust Veil
[39:46] into that in a little while maybe
[39:47] tonight or this afternoon
[39:50] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[39:52] beast of the field which the Lord God
[39:53] and made
[39:54] he said unto woman you know Satan was
[39:57] having Fellowship
[40:00] but is it in the right kind you got to
[40:04] determine that you on every eat of
[40:06] every tree of the garden the woman said
[40:08] to the serpent
[40:10] shut up talk to my husband yeah that's
[40:13] what she should have said amen
[40:17] all the woman yes I always gotta say
[40:20] something
[40:21] hey man and a woman sitting in the
[40:24] serpent we may eat in the fruit of the
[40:26] Trees of the garden but of the fruit of
[40:28] the tree which is in the midst of the
[40:29] garden God said You shall not eat a beat
[40:32] me to shall you touch it unless you die
[40:34] right all right she got up on her Pulpit
[40:36] probably said and the surface said
[40:38] another woman you shall not
[40:41] surely die one word not
[40:44] for God doesn't know the day that you
[40:45] eat their own then your eyes will be
[40:46] open and you shall be as God knowing
[40:48] Good and Evil
[40:49] and when the woman saw
[40:51] what what Satan was talking about the
[40:53] Revelation that he was bringing to her
[40:55] when she saw that the tree was good for
[40:57] food because listen sisters are more
[40:59] emotional sisters and more uh the easy
[41:03] to be deceived because you take your
[41:04] emotion every time right you do that's
[41:08] just the way you were made that's why
[41:09] the feminist part of Adam came out into
[41:11] woman or Eve and she had the emotional
[41:15] part and he said and listen
[41:19] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[41:21] good for food it was pleasant to the
[41:22] eyes and treated me desired to make one
[41:24] wise
[41:25] she partook of what the serpent said and
[41:27] did he and gave also unto her husband
[41:29] with her and he didn't eat all right so
[41:32] you understand we didn't know what went
[41:33] on brotherdale just went through all
[41:35] that
[41:35] and the eyes of them both were opened
[41:38] and they knew they were naked and they
[41:40] sold big leaves together and made
[41:42] themselves aprons
[41:44] and they heard the voice of the Lord God
[41:46] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[41:47] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[41:50] from the presence of the Lord God
[41:51] amongst trees in the garden and the Lord
[41:54] God called unto Adam and said Where Art
[41:56] Thou listen to this
[42:00] Fellowship broke right here
[42:04] he said I heard thy voice in the garden
[42:09] and I was afraid yeah
[42:11] that's right clear
[42:15] all right fear broke Fellowship that's
[42:19] right fear
[42:21] he said out no I wasn't afraid before
[42:24] before he walked right up to God not a
[42:27] problem he could hear God coming
[42:29] feel that anointing he walked right up
[42:30] to God but now what happened
[42:35] and I heard thy voice in the garden and
[42:38] I was afraid because I was naked and I
[42:41] hit myself amen
[42:43] no words the Lord said who told you that
[42:45] you were naked
[42:52] now brother Brown you know how he says
[42:56] because man because Adam should have
[42:58] said God I knew what I was doing
[43:01] but see it's not our nature right
[43:04] and the man said the woman thou gave us
[43:06] me and she gave me the tree and I didn't
[43:08] eat the Lord said unto the woman what is
[43:10] that that was done and the woman said
[43:11] the serpent beguiled me and I did eat in
[43:13] other words they were passing the boat
[43:14] down the line
[43:16] yeah watch
[43:17] man
[43:19] Adam woman and the Beast all live
[43:21] together in Perfect Harmony without the
[43:24] devil right they had Fellowship right
[43:26] right there was no fear amen yeah there
[43:30] was no fear in that Fellowship that's
[43:32] right that's why in the New Testament
[43:33] you see where it says come boldly to the
[43:35] throne that's why we can get back right
[43:37] we can get back to God all right and
[43:40] it's okay to remember that these things
[43:41] are spiritually minded that we'll
[43:43] remember these things but still look how
[43:46] now that God's gonna have to deal with
[43:48] this
[43:50] and making another Covenant
[43:52] Covenant was
[43:55] man and woman
[43:57] God
[44:00] multiply and replenish the Earth yeah
[44:04] no nothing muddled up in there
[44:05] everything flowed just perfect right
[44:07] right but now what happens you bring
[44:10] fear in it and when you bring fear in
[44:12] you break Fellowship you tell me
[44:15] before you were born again when you were
[44:18] first married to your husband or your
[44:20] wife
[44:21] everybody has this fear
[44:23] of them not loving them are this fear of
[44:27] this happening or this fear of that
[44:29] happening what's Jesus when he comes
[44:31] back in the New Testament what's the
[44:33] first thing he said
[44:34] he walks right up he says fear not
[44:36] because the Fear Factor is coming up
[44:38] because you're human right just like he
[44:40] did in the garden hey he was the one
[44:42] standing in the garden talking to Adam
[44:43] man right so it wasn't any different
[44:45] when he came down here human flesh when
[44:47] the man walked up to him he said fear
[44:49] not well he saw that fear raising up in
[44:51] the people right and it was killing them
[44:53] because it what if it destroyed
[44:54] Fellowship
[44:57] if it destroyed Felicia because of fear
[45:01] how's it going to restore Fellowship
[45:03] doing away with fear right right because
[45:05] Adam said I was afraid so that broke
[45:07] fellowship and then instead of going
[45:09] well
[45:10] God it was all my fault I knew what I
[45:13] was doing
[45:14] no he said she did it so that broke
[45:17] Fellowship because Eve turns around and
[45:19] gets mad at Adam and she says hey no it
[45:22] wasn't that it was me it was him yeah
[45:25] the surfing so here they go they start
[45:27] passing the butt right Fellowship just
[45:29] starts pulling apart well Adam don't
[45:31] fellowship with animals no more
[45:37] separated
[45:39] but God thought so much of that marriage
[45:42] vow though
[45:44] and there was so much of God and Adam so
[45:47] he didn't want to throw Eve away because
[45:49] he was a part of him he remembered that
[45:51] vow he made
[45:52] he said we too shall be one flesh I
[45:55] actually like brother Brown said God
[45:57] would have had to kill Abraham because
[45:59] Sarah was part of Abraham right and they
[46:01] weren't literally a part of each other
[46:03] Adam and Eve were literally amen DNA
[46:06] wise bone of a bone flesh of Flesh amen
[46:08] all right but now tell me
[46:11] you say well well I married my wife and
[46:13] she wasn't part
[46:16] if you're born again
[46:19] you and your wife should have the same
[46:20] DNA if you're both born again right
[46:22] exactly right and when we get to heaven
[46:24] we're going to have the same DNA right
[46:25] so there's a lot of things you can say
[46:28] about that how close that gets to
[46:30] putting us back into the right order but
[46:32] we'll leave that for another time so now
[46:36] this
[46:38] let's go to Genesis three we got three
[46:40] let's do 14 through 17. so God says well
[46:45] I can't fellowship with you no more
[46:47] not like I used to
[46:49] Adam you can't fellowship with animals
[46:51] like you used to if you have done what
[46:54] you've done and you can't Fellowship
[46:56] either way
[46:58] much and the Lord God said unto the
[47:00] serpent because now has done this that
[47:02] are cursed above every candle right
[47:04] every beast of the field and upon your
[47:06] belly you'll go and thus shall you eat
[47:07] all the days of your life you know how I
[47:09] tell you about that the dust the serpent
[47:11] eats is this thing right here oh yeah
[47:13] that's what he's eating he's eating this
[47:14] dust right here this is what he's eating
[47:16] serpent don't eat dust and left this is
[47:18] what he eats right here but here's the
[47:21] promise in 15 to put it back together
[47:26] Genesis 3 15.
[47:28] is the entire Bible
[47:31] entire Bible written in one verse
[47:36] that's what it was written for yeah and
[47:39] I got
[47:40] another word to Adam you can't do it but
[47:43] I can't
[47:44] and I will put in in between thee and
[47:47] the woman talking about The Serpent and
[47:48] the woman that's right what is enmity
[47:51] division
[47:53] God started dividing it up but he begins
[47:56] after that to start putting it back
[47:57] together
[47:58] because enmity is division so God is
[48:01] saying this is the way it's going to
[48:02] have to be now there's got to be another
[48:04] Covenant entered in brother Brown calls
[48:07] it a double Covenant and I will put
[48:09] enmity between being the woman right and
[48:11] between thy seed and her seed so there's
[48:14] division between woman and animal it
[48:16] shall bruise thy hand and thou shall
[48:18] bruise his heel in other words
[48:20] it what it is the woman's seed amen
[48:25] all day long they don't kill him
[48:29] and that's what Satan's been doing see
[48:31] it says Thou shalt bruise his heel now
[48:33] in other words Satan is taking us down
[48:35] to the Grave
[48:37] but her seed the woman seed will bruise
[48:39] thy head who serpent he's going to kill
[48:42] that thing hit it in the head
[48:43] really but the serpent still got a
[48:45] little bit of hold because of what he's
[48:47] doing right here because see that woman
[48:50] was standing in verse 16 and had
[48:53] two seeds in her right the serpents the
[48:57] the Beast natural and Adam right
[49:01] so he couldn't kill her
[49:03] watch this until the woman he said I
[49:05] will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[49:09] here's your Covenant sister
[49:12] did you win it and I will greatly
[49:15] multiply thy sorrow
[49:17] and die conception yeah
[49:20] what is your sorrow
[49:22] you're unclean every 20 you know 28 days
[49:24] you're unclean so it might just that's
[49:26] just the way it is yeah all right I will
[49:28] greatly multiply that sorrow and by
[49:31] conception and sorrow Thou shalt bring
[49:33] forth children in other words you're
[49:35] going to hurt it's going to be painful
[49:37] thank God men don't have to have them
[49:39] that's right amen amen but now look
[49:41] that's why God said a woman the way she
[49:43] was okay
[49:44] the way your hamster formed the way you
[49:46] were formed God didn't just have to redo
[49:48] the whole thing
[49:49] he made you right to start with right
[49:51] okay another woman he said I would break
[49:53] and multiplying my sorrow and my
[49:55] conception and sorrow Thou shalt bring
[49:57] forth children and thy desire this is
[50:00] the one that people don't like I love
[50:01] the women anyway
[50:03] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[50:07] and he shall rule over thee right that
[50:11] wasn't in the first Covenant right right
[50:13] that's not in the first code it was Adam
[50:15] and Eve together
[50:18] co-equal amen right join air that's why
[50:21] in First Peter if you'll read that's
[50:23] what the restoration is back to join
[50:25] heirs and the glory of the Lord right
[50:27] right remember we just read it in
[50:28] chapter in chapter 3 verse 7 of Peter
[50:31] until the woman he said I would greatly
[50:33] multiply I saw on that conception and
[50:35] sorrow you'll bring forth children
[50:37] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[50:40] and he shall rule over thee
[50:42] he's not finished
[50:44] guys we got a part two right and to Adam
[50:47] he said because thou has hearkened and
[50:49] to the voice of thy wife
[50:53] and hath eaten of the tree of which I
[50:55] commanded you thee
[50:58] saying Thou shalt not eat of it curses
[51:01] the ground for thy sake and sorrow shall
[51:04] thou eat of it all the days of our life
[51:07] and it keeps going on to dust you go
[51:10] back to the dust because that's where
[51:12] you came from thus Thou Art that's the
[51:14] shall return what death
[51:16] so we come into a double Covenant now
[51:18] look
[51:21] this Covenant was not made out of hatred
[51:24] right
[51:27] God didn't hate that the woman did this
[51:31] because he knew she was gonna do it yeah
[51:33] he designed her so that she could do it
[51:36] because she didn't make her in the
[51:37] original creation
[51:38] now he didn't design her to make her do
[51:41] it right he knew she would do it
[51:43] therefore he made her where she could
[51:46] yeah all right
[51:48] anybody said because now has hearken of
[51:51] the voice of thy wife
[51:54] now God listen
[51:56] God had to bring this New Covenant in
[52:00] to restore Fellowship right right
[52:03] Fellowship was broke before this was
[52:05] this was just an act afterwards this is
[52:08] what God told him now you got a double
[52:10] Covenant the man is going to be a ruler
[52:12] over the wife
[52:13] right
[52:15] thy desire shall be to thy husband and
[52:17] he shall rule over thee all right there
[52:21] was a new coming up between man and
[52:22] woman now
[52:24] but I wrote it here it's not out of
[52:25] hatred because look
[52:27] what was the first Covenant
[52:30] the Old Testament
[52:33] we're going to spiritualize a little bit
[52:34] now okay yeah click click
[52:38] because we couldn't keep the Old
[52:39] Testament
[52:41] right right that was the first Covenant
[52:43] in other words you said one nice note we
[52:45] got a neighborhood now listen
[52:47] God give us do's and don'ts through the
[52:49] Old Testament right yeah right right
[52:52] that's where I started do this don't do
[52:55] that do this don't do that way come in
[52:56] with the Ten Commandments yeah I know it
[52:58] goes into Grace but we couldn't keep
[53:00] remember Paul said you can't keep the
[53:02] law
[53:03] you can't keep it the law was given
[53:06] because of your transgression why not
[53:07] because you couldn't do the do's and
[53:09] don'ts
[53:10] but he gave us the second Covenant the
[53:12] Grace Covenant that's what that is amen
[53:15] that's not that that's not that now
[53:17] man's supposed to have
[53:19] power and rulership over the woman and
[53:21] treat her like dirt no
[53:23] every time I look at my wife
[53:25] sorry
[53:26] most every time I look at my wife
[53:29] I think of Christ in the church I think
[53:31] of how I'm acting
[53:34] because as she acts toward me the Bible
[53:37] says what
[53:38] Christ is going to treat me like I treat
[53:40] her right
[53:42] now I told you we was going to get kind
[53:44] of we're going to get it man what are
[53:46] you men moving around now for you had
[53:49] your chest back a few minutes ago why
[53:50] are you moving around of course because
[53:51] as God treats you is how you treat your
[53:54] wife exactly but you look at the wife
[53:56] and that's how you honor her
[53:59] as the weaker vessel we're going to read
[54:01] scripture maybe later on we want to go a
[54:04] lot further than this but I want to read
[54:06] this quote number five
[54:08] so we keep we couldn't even keep the
[54:10] first Covenant God give us which would
[54:11] be by the law right
[54:15] then he come in with Abraham Covenant
[54:17] but that was still in the Old Testament
[54:18] but the only time we can live it is
[54:21] when God came in with what the death of
[54:24] the testator or a new testament amen
[54:27] right we had the Old Testament we
[54:29] couldn't live it right right now that we
[54:32] have the New Testament we can live the
[54:34] Old Testament because we got the what
[54:36] death of the testator and that testator
[54:38] now lives in us right all right now look
[54:41] marriage and divorce
[54:43] two Covenants now that closes the
[54:46] beginning of what Jesus said it wasn't
[54:48] so at the beginning we got another
[54:50] Covenant now notice it's another
[54:52] Covenant
[54:53] now there's a covenant for the product
[54:55] and the byproduct right
[54:57] right notice the fall trouble death to
[55:00] every creature of the creation amen
[55:04] and like we said before you go back to
[55:06] Romans
[55:07] eight the whole creation does what
[55:09] groans and travailed right they didn't
[55:12] do this we did so they're groaning
[55:14] looking at us
[55:16] what waiting for the manifestation of
[55:18] the sons of God just like Adam did in
[55:20] the beginning all right now now there is
[55:23] a covenant for the product and the
[55:24] byproduct notice the fall brought
[55:27] trouble
[55:28] death to every creature of the creation
[55:30] making a difference in all nature
[55:34] right
[55:38] now let us notice what Jesus said from
[55:40] the beginning it wasn't so remember they
[55:42] asked him the question
[55:43] now it is not so from
[55:46] it is now it is after the beginning
[55:48] right
[55:50] in other words afterwards
[55:51] now there's a double Covenant
[55:54] first was just the Covenant Adam and Eve
[55:56] was co-equal amen one man one woman now
[56:00] the woman sinned and what does she do
[56:02] that throw them off
[56:04] to death and God had to make a covenant
[56:07] by that another Covenant here it is
[56:09] right here in Genesis 3 16. he made
[56:12] another Covenant man now the world is to
[56:15] be repopulated not by the original
[56:17] creation of God like in the beginning
[56:19] not by the original be creation but my
[56:22] sex desire right now that takes care
[56:26] of the beginning doesn't it in the
[56:28] beginning there was only one man and one
[56:29] woman one male one female but when she
[56:32] crossed that line and brought this sin
[56:34] now the world is to be repopulated again
[56:37] by sex not by creation
[56:39] my sex see where the woman is at now but
[56:42] that's the way the world is populated
[56:44] today through women
[56:45] that's the reason Jesus had to come
[56:48] through the woman to bring it back to
[56:50] its original beginning again without sex
[56:53] desire he's virgin born but Hallelujah
[56:55] there will come a time where it won't be
[56:57] no more sex right but God shall call his
[57:01] children from the dust of the earth
[57:02] why'd you talk about Resurrection
[57:04] back like there was in the original not
[57:07] through any woman but through the
[57:09] molding of the clay of the cosmic line
[57:10] and the petroleum he will create again
[57:13] like he did Adam at the first time Jesus
[57:16] made this possible by God making himself
[57:18] a man and coming into the world so he
[57:20] could die through this woman now it's
[57:23] testing time
[57:25] by sin right all right everybody got
[57:27] that so that's the the two covenants the
[57:30] Covenant now is man is to have river
[57:32] ship over the the woman and she's
[57:35] supposed to now multiply and replenish
[57:37] the Earth by the way we all got here
[57:39] right which was bisexual desire all
[57:42] right now let's go to number six listen
[57:45] to this this is a good one
[57:50] foreign
[57:52] Spokane Washington
[57:55] 1962. listen to this
[57:57] I'm gonna read the whole thing it's your
[57:59] American privilege you say oh yeah if
[58:01] you're a lamb a lamb forfeits is right
[58:03] right he don't have but one thing wool
[58:06] and he forfeits that if you're a lamb
[58:08] you'll forfeit your American rights to
[58:10] serve God
[58:12] say I can dress the way I want to it's
[58:14] none of your business
[58:15] it's not me brother and sister it's the
[58:18] Bible
[58:19] God made a man and made him dress like a
[58:21] man made a woman to dress like a woman
[58:25] made them act different and made two
[58:28] covenants with them and everything else
[58:30] it's always been the LIE has come your
[58:34] Adam might let you get by with it but
[58:37] brother God won't because that's the
[58:39] word now you men sit around and do such
[58:41] things as that aren't you ashamed
[58:43] Brothers deacons men who say they're men
[58:46] of God act like that when that's just
[58:48] the first
[58:49] primer or primary when you go to school
[58:53] you go to what primary school why
[58:55] because you get one plus one equals two
[58:57] all right you get a foundation
[58:59] that's just the first primer lesson of
[59:02] it how can you go into deep things of
[59:04] Discerning the spirit and things like
[59:06] that if you don't even take the first
[59:08] thing now what he's talking about is is
[59:11] you keep going on down through here you
[59:12] got
[59:13] a woman that put on manicure makeup and
[59:16] stuff like that you know all the do's
[59:17] and don'ts of the message
[59:19] what he's saying is
[59:22] if you allow that to go on
[59:25] you're not even at the primary thing
[59:26] yeah
[59:31] everybody awake yeah
[59:35] okay that's the first primer lesson of
[59:38] it
[59:42] listen the most basic primer lesson in
[59:45] these matters is to understand that God
[59:47] has put us under a double Covenant that
[59:49] establishes the role of the male and
[59:51] female
[59:54] right
[59:55] last established male and female have
[59:58] different roles right all right if it
[1:00:01] had not been for the fall they'd had the
[1:00:03] same role they would have both been
[1:00:04] ruler over the Earth both would have
[1:00:06] been ruler over the creation but now
[1:00:09] what happened in the garden
[1:00:13] you say well that's brother Brown said
[1:00:15] see that's just complimentary to think
[1:00:16] God wouldn't know that or God wouldn't
[1:00:18] do that and use it for Redemption
[1:00:20] so that's what he's doing he's using it
[1:00:22] for Redemption all right because the
[1:00:24] only way you and I can get here on the
[1:00:25] earth the earth was cursed remember he
[1:00:28] didn't curse out of me cursed the Earth
[1:00:29] the Earth was cursed so we all had to be
[1:00:32] in the fog to have a savior to save us
[1:00:35] so we had to go down into that crust of
[1:00:38] the earth we are all of our bodies we're
[1:00:40] laying there in Genesis 3 when God said
[1:00:42] Adam cursed is the ground there we are
[1:00:45] this thing's cursed this thing comes
[1:00:48] first right right all right we got to
[1:00:50] live with this this is what this is what
[1:00:52] happened
[1:00:53] but God said through the woman I'll
[1:00:56] bring it back
[1:00:57] so see I don't I don't I do see the man
[1:01:01] and woman in different roles but when we
[1:01:03] get up younger it's not going to be
[1:01:06] Jim go fix me some lunch
[1:01:09] or or where's my life no it's like
[1:01:12] Brother Gary and I were talking you know
[1:01:13] he's he's got sister
[1:01:15] um Rebecca and Sister Margaret brother
[1:01:17] Brown hadn't made remember meeting and
[1:01:20] hope and brother Brown said well now
[1:01:22] Mika said hopeless jealous right you
[1:01:24] remember he said oh there's no jealousy
[1:01:26] over there and he said we'll walk arm
[1:01:28] and arm and never have to worry about
[1:01:30] any of that wine all the f e a r right
[1:01:35] is going to be gone
[1:01:37] that's our problem right now we feel
[1:01:40] that we're not doing the right thing
[1:01:41] which Godly fear is good but we fear
[1:01:44] that we're not doing the right thing we
[1:01:45] fear that our wife will get mad at us
[1:01:47] come on people we fear that we'll do
[1:01:49] something we should be in Godly
[1:01:51] reverence
[1:01:52] and godly fear but not fear like Adam
[1:01:54] was afraid exactly Adam was scared
[1:01:57] Adam was in the old saying says he was
[1:01:59] shaking in his boots if he had any boots
[1:02:01] he was shaking because he knew
[1:02:04] that he didn't when he felt that
[1:02:05] presence coming like he did before it
[1:02:07] felt different
[1:02:08] something felt wrong right something
[1:02:11] didn't feel right there was not a a
[1:02:13] connection
[1:02:15] same way as a sinner set in a
[1:02:17] congregation I've done it before yeah
[1:02:20] I used to be the Christmas and Easter
[1:02:22] guy
[1:02:23] here
[1:02:27] that wasn't a fellowship
[1:02:29] right it was a what a condemnation a
[1:02:33] fear
[1:02:34] right now see we're supposed to come
[1:02:36] boldly Before the Throne of Grace We're
[1:02:38] supposed to come into the sanctuary and
[1:02:39] even though we may be fearful of things
[1:02:41] we're not supposed to have that fear
[1:02:43] right if you got the holy ghost that
[1:02:45] should do away with the fear inside
[1:02:47] because you've got the holy ghost that
[1:02:49] Holy Ghost will lead you to the word
[1:02:51] right so don't have any fear in that
[1:02:53] right right then that fear has got to
[1:02:54] work its way out yeah
[1:02:56] don't worry about our feelings
[1:02:59] all right so now
[1:03:02] Satan has obviously done one thing
[1:03:05] he has deluded this fellowship and this
[1:03:08] honorable uh part of marriage because
[1:03:10] you see what's going on out in the world
[1:03:12] and how the divorce rates and all the
[1:03:14] things are going on because remember
[1:03:18] he's made it cheap
[1:03:20] he's made it easy
[1:03:23] oh I just put her away and give me
[1:03:25] another one yeah or I don't like the way
[1:03:27] she cooked
[1:03:28] or I like the way he cooked
[1:03:31] or I don't like see the fellowship
[1:03:34] now let's talk about our fellowship for
[1:03:36] just a minute and we'll then we'll uh
[1:03:38] get one more point in and then we'll
[1:03:39] stop for this evening because I want to
[1:03:41] stop at certain points because like Jim
[1:03:43] said she said you ought to just preach
[1:03:45] 15 minutes because that's all we're
[1:03:46] going to get
[1:03:49] that's true though you only get 15
[1:03:51] minutes of whatever hour you've got
[1:03:53] you're only going to remember about 15
[1:03:55] minutes unless you go back and listen to
[1:03:56] the thing all right
[1:03:58] so I went over 15 minutes
[1:04:01] but I'm gonna stop in about 15 minutes
[1:04:04] yeah somebody you'll get this 15 minutes
[1:04:07] yeah
[1:04:09] but Satan has polluted it so much to
[1:04:11] where even the fellowship between even
[1:04:13] us and our spouse and those of you that
[1:04:15] don't have a spouse here you know
[1:04:18] we're praying that's all I can say is
[1:04:20] we're praying we're praying we've added
[1:04:22] them to the list and we're praying right
[1:04:24] because you can't be truly one we're
[1:04:25] going to talk this afternoon about the
[1:04:28] relationship you know you always heard
[1:04:30] the story of Three's a crown
[1:04:32] not in the Christian relationship
[1:04:35] nope Free's not a crowd right brother
[1:04:37] Brown said you got to have a man woman
[1:04:39] and God without those three
[1:04:43] won't work sorry no matter how good you
[1:04:46] think your relationship is with your
[1:04:47] wife or your husband that's not here
[1:04:48] without God and that three I'll read
[1:04:51] what brother Brown said he's there's a
[1:04:53] lot there's something strong in there he
[1:04:55] says and I'm gonna read it but I'm just
[1:04:56] gonna let the prophet deal with it you
[1:04:57] deal it with it with him
[1:05:01] he said if you if you sit there and you
[1:05:03] dwell in it
[1:05:04] I'll read it tonight and this afternoon
[1:05:06] he said if you dwell with it
[1:05:08] and you allow it to happen in your home
[1:05:10] he said you're not even a Christian
[1:05:14] I told you I'm gonna find out whether
[1:05:16] you believe you'll profit or not
[1:05:18] okay
[1:05:19] reach it now
[1:05:21] look
[1:05:25] let's go back to Genesis 3 16.
[1:05:30] until the woman he said I will greatly
[1:05:32] multiply thy sorrow on thy conception
[1:05:34] and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth
[1:05:36] children the thy desire shall be to thy
[1:05:38] husband and he shall rule
[1:05:40] over there now pull up court number
[1:05:42] seven
[1:05:46] marriage and divorce
[1:05:48] now notice after the beginning after the
[1:05:50] beginning After Time began right
[1:05:54] time to get a win after the fall
[1:05:56] back in that was eternity is over
[1:06:00] notice after that fall was made by Eve
[1:06:02] after the fall there would need to be
[1:06:04] another covenant made now this is going
[1:06:06] to stumble you but I'm going to give you
[1:06:08] scripture to prove that it's the truth
[1:06:10] now notice after the fall Jesus said God
[1:06:12] at the beginning made one of a kind but
[1:06:14] now after the fall now we're going
[1:06:16] beyond that the Covenant was co-equal
[1:06:19] but now after the fall there's another
[1:06:21] covenant made now she is no longer ruler
[1:06:24] with him
[1:06:26] right each must have a separate Covenant
[1:06:31] now that's we're going to break that out
[1:06:32] when we get finished with the marriage
[1:06:34] part today maybe we're going to break
[1:06:36] that out into the role of the male and
[1:06:38] the role of the female and bring it
[1:06:39] right down through scripture all right
[1:06:41] then we're going to put it back together
[1:06:42] as a family all right now go to First
[1:06:45] Corinthians 11 3.
[1:06:53] but I would have you know that the head
[1:06:55] of every man is Christ
[1:06:57] and the head of the woman is a man
[1:07:00] and the head of Christ is God so there's
[1:07:02] your
[1:07:03] any way you want to put it that's the
[1:07:05] way it's got to come all right
[1:07:07] the head of the woman
[1:07:09] is the man now we're going to cover that
[1:07:12] you say well I'm not going to leave it
[1:07:13] this afternoon we're going to cover all
[1:07:16] the different things about honor and
[1:07:18] respect we're going to talk about
[1:07:20] reverence uh obeying
[1:07:24] see it's not
[1:07:26] a lot of times what we think brother
[1:07:28] Brandon was real hard on the women why
[1:07:31] he was speaking spiritually because he's
[1:07:33] trying to get the bride lined up as long
[1:07:36] as the women getting the women lined up
[1:07:37] in the world or in the Christianity he
[1:07:40] was trying to get the women lined up but
[1:07:42] he was trying to get the bride lined up
[1:07:44] amen that's what he was sent for right
[1:07:46] see brother Dale was sent to preach to
[1:07:48] this congregation to get the women lined
[1:07:51] up the men lined up and to get the bride
[1:07:53] but but he wasn't sent to get all the
[1:07:55] bride lined up amen right that's right
[1:07:58] my brother Brandon was set to get all
[1:07:59] the bride lined up right so see that's
[1:08:02] why he had to preach the way he did he
[1:08:04] was preaching to local congregations but
[1:08:06] he was talking right right brother then
[1:08:08] he was talking to the whole bride right
[1:08:11] the our Prophet talks to everybody right
[1:08:13] but he was trying to get this group
[1:08:16] to see that the woman was still part of
[1:08:20] the man God never said the woman wasn't
[1:08:21] part of the man right he just said this
[1:08:23] is what you've got to do and this is
[1:08:25] what you got to do right he never he
[1:08:27] never took Genesis 1 26 out
[1:08:31] right never said we're not going to be
[1:08:34] one flesh
[1:08:36] but he gave us different covenants to
[1:08:37] live under right but what he's trying to
[1:08:39] do is to see he's trying to get the
[1:08:41] woman of the world lined up because he
[1:08:43] was typing them with the bride
[1:08:46] same way with you and I right in this
[1:08:48] local assembly
[1:08:50] men and women get lined up guess what
[1:08:52] that's for the whole assembly right
[1:08:54] right
[1:08:55] what did I just read you that's your
[1:08:57] prayers right be not him group right
[1:09:00] right that's powerful
[1:09:02] that's powerful
[1:09:04] that if you don't do these certain
[1:09:06] simple primer things
[1:09:11] sisters you know one thing's for sure
[1:09:12] brother Brown said if you cut your hair
[1:09:15] put scissors to your hair God will not
[1:09:19] hear your prayer right except for your
[1:09:22] repentance right that's it so you sit
[1:09:26] there and pray all that that's just like
[1:09:27] that woman
[1:09:28] she had went to psychiatrists she had
[1:09:30] went to doctors she had been prayed for
[1:09:33] she was going crazy and nobody knew how
[1:09:37] brother Brown said I don't care said you
[1:09:39] can pour all over I I think I still got
[1:09:41] it back there he said lady we can pour
[1:09:43] gallons of oil on you
[1:09:46] you can go to the greatest psychiatrist
[1:09:49] in the world which you've been to most
[1:09:50] of them
[1:09:51] she said but that thing went back under
[1:09:54] the Gable part of your soul of what you
[1:09:56] did your husband way back when he was
[1:09:58] off in the war
[1:09:59] he said you have let that thing stay in
[1:10:01] there and said there is nothing he said
[1:10:03] the devil will always
[1:10:04] have a hold on that until you get rid of
[1:10:07] it right said lady we can pour gallons
[1:10:11] of oil on your head and pray until the
[1:10:13] day she died
[1:10:15] and to do her no good right
[1:10:17] you hear how God works God don't go past
[1:10:20] his word God won't go past his word
[1:10:22] right so you sisters you cut any of you
[1:10:24] cutting your hair today I don't care if
[1:10:26] you've got this much or or give me burn
[1:10:29] it off
[1:10:30] you've cut it right amen hello
[1:10:35] then God ain't listening you sit there
[1:10:37] and pray for your family you pray for
[1:10:39] anything you want to pray for God ain't
[1:10:41] listening to it right
[1:10:43] amen God ain't listening to that right
[1:10:47] but when you come back like that lady
[1:10:49] had to do he said lady go get your
[1:10:51] husband
[1:10:52] when you two make it right and they did
[1:10:55] he said they gave their hearts to God
[1:10:58] right there they both knelt down gave
[1:10:59] their heart to God and he lived a
[1:11:01] wonderful Christian Life
[1:11:03] confession right right so cut your hair
[1:11:06] forget about praying
[1:11:08] he said for yourself say God forgive me
[1:11:11] restore me back and then let me pray for
[1:11:13] my children then let me pray for my
[1:11:15] husband they'll let me pray for for
[1:11:16] whoever it is
[1:11:18] but listen
[1:11:20] well we're established here on the Earth
[1:11:22] you notice I got a big tablet
[1:11:25] I couldn't get it all on my little
[1:11:27] tablet I got one big life here
[1:11:33] I wrote myself a note said this this was
[1:11:36] established while we're here on the
[1:11:37] earth and this is just the way it is
[1:11:38] yeah
[1:11:39] and it is right let me read this to you
[1:11:43] a marriage covenant and every one of us
[1:11:46] he got married listen this the marriage
[1:11:48] covenant itself is based on the double
[1:11:49] Covenant God established with man and
[1:11:51] woman it is very clearly established it
[1:11:54] very clearly establishes the roles and
[1:11:57] responsibilities of both husband and
[1:11:59] wife
[1:12:00] look at the portion of this wedding
[1:12:02] ceremony that speaks of these scriptural
[1:12:04] roles and did y'all get it another joke
[1:12:06] with there we go so here's the marriage
[1:12:09] covenant this is what you hear most of
[1:12:11] the time in the wedding I did one where
[1:12:13] it was a little bit different but it was
[1:12:14] basically the same
[1:12:16] without have this woman to be thy wedded
[1:12:18] wife now this is the Bible
[1:12:20] to live together after God's ordinance
[1:12:22] and the holy estate of matrimony
[1:12:25] with that lover comfort her
[1:12:29] honor and keep her
[1:12:32] in sickness and in health
[1:12:35] and wrinkles and then
[1:12:39] sagging faces and no teeth and
[1:12:44] I read a quote last night where brother
[1:12:47] Brown said uh
[1:12:49] he said he said I look at the somebody
[1:12:52] was standing before him I use it on
[1:12:53] Netflix if somebody was standing for him
[1:12:55] getting married he said I thought
[1:12:56] you know Lord and oh he was praying
[1:12:58] afterward he said Lord you know in 30
[1:13:00] years they're not gonna look like this
[1:13:01] in other words that's what he said 30
[1:13:02] years they're not gonna look like that
[1:13:03] yeah he said what are they going to do
[1:13:05] now
[1:13:06] so he had the prayer he said Lord make
[1:13:08] them always
[1:13:10] see each other as the first day they
[1:13:11] were married amen all right will thou
[1:13:13] love her comfort her honor and keep her
[1:13:16] in sickness and in health
[1:13:18] forsaking all others right
[1:13:21] mother-in-laws
[1:13:24] father-in-laws
[1:13:27] sisters
[1:13:29] Brothers
[1:13:30] mommies and daddies even man forsake all
[1:13:34] others
[1:13:36] keep the only unto her as long as you
[1:13:39] both shall live and you're supposed to
[1:13:40] respond yes that's your vow right now
[1:13:43] listen to the woman though lit without
[1:13:45] have this man this come from Brother
[1:13:47] Brown this was from where he was
[1:13:48] marrying somebody well thou have this
[1:13:50] man to be thy wedding husband wedded
[1:13:53] husband to live together after God's
[1:13:55] ordinance in the holiest state of
[1:13:57] matrimony
[1:13:58] see now you didn't put
[1:14:00] obey in his and put on her right but
[1:14:05] you're supposed to honor but wilt thou
[1:14:06] this is scriptural wilt thou obey him
[1:14:09] and serve him
[1:14:11] love honor and keep him in sickness and
[1:14:13] in health and forsaking all others keep
[1:14:16] thee only under him so long as you both
[1:14:19] shall live amen so it's your death do we
[1:14:21] part right
[1:14:22] now let's cover one more thing well
[1:14:24] that's not let's talk right there
[1:14:25] because this afternoon we're going to
[1:14:27] cover being married in his name and then
[1:14:30] bringing the things together the purpose
[1:14:32] for marriage which we'll get back into
[1:14:33] Fellowship but that's exactly what we
[1:14:36] must do look without obey him
[1:14:39] and serve him so we see that the double
[1:14:41] Covenant has come in
[1:14:43] keep your vowel
[1:14:45] your vow comes down into your marriage
[1:14:47] and you're supposed to live together
[1:14:49] just like this and sickness inhale right
[1:14:53] you're supposed to obey your husband and
[1:14:54] serve him
[1:14:55] now when's the only time you're not
[1:14:57] supposed to obey
[1:14:59] when it's not in the Lord when it's not
[1:15:02] in the Lord yeah and brother Brown said
[1:15:04] if your husband says hey go on to church
[1:15:06] or your wife says Hey going to church
[1:15:07] you know that's your life you know the
[1:15:10] Bible says that's good to do that
[1:15:12] because because you living the life in
[1:15:15] front of them
[1:15:16] being salty you'll pull them in all
[1:15:18] right but now if you're not
[1:15:21] my brother my my buddy's coming
[1:15:23] Wednesday night he said if you live a
[1:15:26] hound dog life
[1:15:28] you're a hound dog yeah you're not a
[1:15:31] lamb you're a hound dog so you live a
[1:15:33] hound dog life in front of your family
[1:15:35] like Daddy's always said and I agree hey
[1:15:38] you know I didn't
[1:15:41] I didn't want to act like somebody
[1:15:42] else's father I want to act like my
[1:15:44] father yeah you know I didn't want to
[1:15:46] act like the way some of the other
[1:15:47] people was acting I've told you many
[1:15:48] times before we our actions speak louder
[1:15:51] than our world
[1:15:52] so even the little things that we do at
[1:15:54] home with our husband and wife that are
[1:15:56] not believing
[1:15:57] we still got to believe form but we got
[1:15:59] to be so salty we got to be so reverent
[1:16:03] and even to them I mean they can just I
[1:16:06] mean they can just lash back at you look
[1:16:08] at the illustration of that brother
[1:16:10] Brown gave of that woman that gave her
[1:16:11] heart to the Lord her husband was drunk
[1:16:15] remember when she he'd come home and he
[1:16:16] said hey I want to show you well see he
[1:16:19] knew what she was going to do that man
[1:16:22] knew what that wife was gonna do
[1:16:25] he knew it he just didn't know he was
[1:16:27] going to get caught up in it and get
[1:16:29] saved but he was you know he was telling
[1:16:31] his buddy he said hey my wife she'll
[1:16:33] clean her ah your wife won't do that
[1:16:34] she'll throw you out the door remember
[1:16:36] he goes in and he slaps the eggs on the
[1:16:38] table and slaps him into the floor and
[1:16:40] him and his buddy will act like they
[1:16:41] were drunk and walked back out of the
[1:16:43] house and went back around and looked in
[1:16:45] the window and there she was my she's
[1:16:49] a happy birthday oh man just because
[1:16:51] what she did amen just because what yeah
[1:16:54] she you know what like most of us we
[1:16:57] might have picked it up but we were
[1:16:59] already going home
[1:17:07] now listen your sisters are not supposed
[1:17:10] to be a doormat and put up with stuff
[1:17:11] like that but she did
[1:17:14] and it won her husband and that man to
[1:17:18] Jesus Christ right
[1:17:20] didn't have to have a preacher in that
[1:17:21] she was her own sermon right there all
[1:17:24] right same way with you and I let's say
[1:17:25] Glory each one of us ought to be the
[1:17:27] same way right
[1:17:28] in our walk and our marriage and her
[1:17:30] fellowship with God and our fellowship
[1:17:33] with our wife and her husband
[1:17:35] but you know what if you know
[1:17:40] we need to live in harmony right we need
[1:17:43] to live in no fear
[1:17:48] brother Brown said he didn't
[1:17:50] he didn't uh
[1:17:52] in other words he didn't you know when
[1:17:54] he said his wife you know he'd go off
[1:17:55] somewhere and his wife would he was
[1:17:57] afraid she'd commit adultery or afraid
[1:17:59] that he would commit adultery and he
[1:18:00] said no he said
[1:18:02] he said I just love her amen right I
[1:18:04] just love her so she knows I won't do it
[1:18:06] and I know she won't mess right so same
[1:18:08] way with you and I as as couples we need
[1:18:11] to be able to to have a holy reverence
[1:18:14] for each other
[1:18:15] but don't fear each other if you go home
[1:18:18] fearing your husband or or you want you
[1:18:20] you need to come to the office if you go
[1:18:22] home fearing that your husband or wife
[1:18:24] is going to do something
[1:18:26] um you know to you or to to harm your
[1:18:29] relationship then then that's not the
[1:18:31] third person in this yeah all right you
[1:18:33] need to think you need to get God in
[1:18:35] there first
[1:18:38] vows marriage tonight we're going to
[1:18:40] talk about a little bit more about the
[1:18:42] relationship we'll get into Fellowship
[1:18:44] relationship I like that one
[1:18:47] and we're going to get into obey and
[1:18:49] honor and we we should be able to to get
[1:18:51] through with with the marriage part and
[1:18:54] then maybe start next week on the roll
[1:18:55] of the mail and then the role of the
[1:18:57] female so everybody enjoys it okay man
[1:19:00] you get some things that you really
[1:19:02] enjoy
[1:19:04] but I want to take it by the scripture I
[1:19:06] don't want you to listen to my opinion
[1:19:07] because because see I could sit down and
[1:19:09] say Brother Gary this is how I treat my
[1:19:11] wife
[1:19:11] he said well I don't treat mine that way
[1:19:13] I'll treat mine this way it's not that
[1:19:14] we're wrong
[1:19:16] we're just different but there is a
[1:19:18] basic
[1:19:20] truth that everybody's got to live by
[1:19:22] right amen the double Covenant is not
[1:19:24] that brother
[1:19:26] Richard can let his wife rule over him
[1:19:28] which is not true
[1:19:30] and then I can't no that's the double
[1:19:32] Covenant that we have to live under
[1:19:34] right we have to live under that
[1:19:35] Covenant and we'll read that brother
[1:19:37] Brown said and I read remember I read to
[1:19:39] you guys that when we went to the
[1:19:40] marriage thing
[1:19:41] if a woman gets out of her role what is
[1:19:44] she Antichrist that's an antichrist
[1:19:47] Spirit if a woman gets out of her role
[1:19:49] as being the female in the marriage so
[1:19:53] I told you we're gonna find out whether
[1:19:55] we really believe the prophet or not
[1:19:57] right let's say something 271s of course
[1:20:00] 271 in the fireball yeah
[1:20:04] I'm so glad
[1:20:55] Jesus I
[1:20:57] travel
[1:21:12] all the time
[1:21:13] yeah
[1:21:40] you love the Lord
[1:21:41] be part of the family but you got to
[1:21:43] realize your big family down here right
[1:21:45] gotta be family down here not
[1:21:47] instituting the family and we wouldn't
[1:21:48] have one God instituted the family to
[1:21:51] show what the spiritual family looks
[1:21:53] like glory and for us to live honor
[1:21:55] respect and obey
[1:21:57] our husband us we respect honor and obey
[1:22:00] God right right that's the institution
[1:22:02] coming down
[1:22:03] but we all have
[1:22:06] certain things that we that we're going
[1:22:09] to talk about maybe this afternoon as
[1:22:10] far as as fellowship and things like
[1:22:12] that with your with your with your
[1:22:14] spouse because I think one thing is and
[1:22:18] I know June and I have not done this
[1:22:20] because we don't have a lot of arguments
[1:22:21] we really don't we don't have one
[1:22:23] arguments maybe one or two of them a day
[1:22:25] or
[1:22:28] no probably one or two a month maybe
[1:22:30] maybe
[1:22:32] but she's she's good she's what God gave
[1:22:35] me and I'm happy with it all right
[1:22:38] but there's ways that you can handle
[1:22:40] things and you know I always always
[1:22:42] thought that this was a great thing to
[1:22:45] do and that's if you ever started in an
[1:22:47] argument with your spouse
[1:22:50] it's just bow your head and say let's
[1:22:52] pray that's it
[1:22:54] all that take all the boiling yeah
[1:22:57] that'll take all the what I'm going to
[1:23:00] say to him and what I'm going to say to
[1:23:01] her
[1:23:04] just bow your head and say Lord
[1:23:06] we're about to get into an argument
[1:23:09] and it's just different isn't I mean
[1:23:11] we're different people we're different
[1:23:12] we are different exactly sure and and I
[1:23:15] think I have a quote in here somewhere
[1:23:16] that that brother Brown said that he
[1:23:18] said you may have an opinion and your
[1:23:20] wife may have an opinion but when you
[1:23:21] come together I'm going to tell you pray
[1:23:24] before you do right
[1:23:25] pray before you start in an argument or
[1:23:27] anything you do just bow your head and
[1:23:29] just say honey let's pray about this
[1:23:31] before we start and then afterwards you
[1:23:33] know you want to throw pies at each
[1:23:35] other or plays whatever but but at least
[1:23:37] you that kind of settles it that warms
[1:23:39] it all up you know kind of settles all
[1:23:41] that sharpness we just need to quit
[1:23:43] being sharp with each other just you're
[1:23:45] always going to have differences you
[1:23:47] know we talk about the Dave Ramsey class
[1:23:49] you got you got free spirits and you got
[1:23:52] nerds we're free Spirits like to spend
[1:23:54] money and nerds like to save money well
[1:23:57] you need both of those in a marriage if
[1:23:59] you don't if you're free Spenders that's
[1:24:00] why a lot of you're in the class
[1:24:02] so one of you's got to become a nerd
[1:24:04] that what does the money crunching the
[1:24:07] dose thing you know writing it on the
[1:24:08] paper and accounting for everything but
[1:24:10] you know it's all one thing
[1:24:13] change that's right yeah we got to
[1:24:16] change right right we got to change
[1:24:18] we're not trying to change people to a
[1:24:20] Dave Ramsey mentality you know I'm just
[1:24:22] trying to help us get through life
[1:24:24] that's what this is going to do listen
[1:24:26] if you're not willing to change you're
[1:24:27] not going to it right right somebody
[1:24:29] told me the other day so brother they'll
[1:24:30] preached this several years ago and said
[1:24:31] it ain't done no good I said well you
[1:24:33] know maybe I'll try it one more time
[1:24:34] amen you know people still living the
[1:24:36] way they are well you know what yeah
[1:24:38] the Bible has a word for that
[1:24:40] iniquity it's no one to do good watch
[1:24:43] the first seal you want to know what
[1:24:45] first deal is it's a mystery of your
[1:24:47] iniquity right that's right not somebody
[1:24:49] else's exactly not the Devils God don't
[1:24:52] have any who's left
[1:24:55] iniquity right here is what's keeping me
[1:24:57] here right I mean no one to do better or
[1:25:00] knowing not to do something I go ahead
[1:25:02] and do it anyway that's why I'm still
[1:25:04] here so let's pray and we'll come back
[1:25:06] this afternoon dear heavenly father we
[1:25:08] pray that you just be with us Lord I
[1:25:09] know it's been kind of dry Lord but we
[1:25:12] pray that your spirit would come Among
[1:25:13] Us in a special way that you would touch
[1:25:16] our hearts and Lord it if we need change
[1:25:18] in the Lord just change it you said you
[1:25:20] would change our heart and make it soft
[1:25:22] you take that old Stony Heart Lord it
[1:25:24] doesn't want to change or doesn't want
[1:25:25] to do your will maybe Lord that you
[1:25:28] would just come in and soften that hard
[1:25:30] up father so that you can speak to us
[1:25:31] more Lord even the ones the Lord has
[1:25:33] been in the been filled with the Holy
[1:25:36] Ghost and and had the new birth for 30
[1:25:39] 40 years may still we realize that we
[1:25:41] need help from you father as we go
[1:25:43] through our natural married life the
[1:25:45] changes and the things that go on and
[1:25:47] the children and the life crisis and the
[1:25:50] things that we do Lord kind of does type
[1:25:52] our spiritual life that when we walk
[1:25:54] with you Lord on some days and and it's
[1:25:56] dark and dreary and then some days the
[1:25:58] Sun's shining but Lord you said through
[1:26:00] a little Prophet one time said a gloomy
[1:26:02] day doesn't mean that you're not with us
[1:26:03] and a break day doesn't mean that you're
[1:26:05] with us also we just got to believe like
[1:26:08] Lord before the fall when Adam was
[1:26:11] Fearless when Adam just stood up and and
[1:26:13] you walked up to him and spoke to him
[1:26:15] Lord just lift the ear and just commune
[1:26:17] with him Lord we desire that communion
[1:26:19] to come back together that we cannot be
[1:26:22] be fearful of of of not anything that
[1:26:25] that we're going to do wrong but Lord
[1:26:28] let's not be fearful that to come into
[1:26:30] your presence you said Lord through
[1:26:32] Peter for us to come boldly to the
[1:26:34] throne of grace to come up and and take
[1:26:36] the things that we need and Lord we see
[1:26:38] them in the end time that that we're
[1:26:39] supposed to do that as Sons and
[1:26:41] Daughters of God indeed adoption stage
[1:26:43] is where we're supposed to be able to
[1:26:45] stand Lord and and do his Adam and and
[1:26:48] move the clouds and and move the rain
[1:26:50] and and command this Earth again father
[1:26:52] we know that it's groaning and aching
[1:26:54] every earthquake and every every tidal
[1:26:57] wave is all showing that there's still a
[1:26:59] fall here but that you're trying Lord
[1:27:01] through nature nature is trying to get
[1:27:04] back to that spot where there's no fear
[1:27:07] although we pray that you'd be with the
[1:27:09] people and touch them and heal them give
[1:27:11] them Deliverance Lord and may they come
[1:27:12] go together as brother Brown said
[1:27:14] they're in marriage in divorce sin
[1:27:15] husbands and wives hugging and kissing
[1:27:17] each other Lord and living in the
[1:27:19] admonition of the Lord taking all the
[1:27:21] things away that of the trials and toils
[1:27:24] of life and just let us live Lord for
[1:27:26] the moment let us live for you father
[1:27:28] be with us take care of us Lord as we go
[1:27:31] and come back with you in a couple of
[1:27:33] hours Jesus name we pray amen you're
[1:27:36] dismissed Lord bless you
[1:27:40] if we never really understand
[1:27:59] foreign
[1:28:42] foreign
[1:30:05] oh well
[1:30:07] I will bring
[1:30:19] in the rain
