[0:00] so we thank the Lord for
[0:03] giving us
[0:04] Easter every day that's right because
[0:06] it's a resurrection
[0:09] but we're talking on patience now
[0:12] for a long time now we're going to
[0:14] finish up today we're going to read the
[0:15] scripture and then I'm going to read you
[0:16] some quotes that we have not previously
[0:19] read
[0:20] and everybody understands about patience
[0:22] now patience is long-suffering patience
[0:24] is waiting patience is waiting on God
[0:27] actually
[0:28] patience is one of these different
[0:31] things steadfastness constancy endurance
[0:35] in other words in your Christian
[0:37] experience patience should stabilize
[0:40] that up and down day that you have now
[0:42] we all going to have up and down days
[0:43] because we're human that's right but
[0:46] brother random never said he said he
[0:48] said you know just because there's a
[0:49] cloudy Sky doesn't mean there's not a
[0:51] God right it's because that you're being
[0:53] shined on and God's blessing you that
[0:55] doesn't mean you're a God that's right
[0:57] He blesses look at all these people
[0:59] they're billionaires I mean that don't
[1:01] even don't even believe in God they just
[1:03] do it by their own understanding yes
[1:06] so you and I though have got to see that
[1:08] this patience is not just man's patient
[1:11] it's Godly patient right patience to
[1:14] wait on God that he'd do all these
[1:17] promises that he said in the Bible he's
[1:18] going to have to do it because you and I
[1:20] can't right
[1:21] light winds did not he we can't change
[1:23] our body there's nothing we can do to
[1:25] change our body we were born in this
[1:26] pest house we were born in this sin
[1:28] Trout from Mom and Dad that's right yeah
[1:31] framework's going to stay there but
[1:33] we're going to be changed there's
[1:34] something going on in my body now that's
[1:36] taking me to the Grave right
[1:38] things are breaking down
[1:41] now that's not what God wanted
[1:45] God wants us to stay young he wants us
[1:48] that when one cell uh you know I don't
[1:50] understand how when we get over there
[1:52] because I can't understand it a
[1:53] glorified body that cells are not
[1:56] breaking down because that's why we have
[1:58] heat that's why the Heat's in our body
[1:59] why we have 98.6 degrees in our body
[2:02] because cells are breaking down we're
[2:04] actually a little explosion going on
[2:07] right sales are exploding making new
[2:09] ones breaking off making new sales but
[2:12] over there it's not going to be breaking
[2:14] down we're we're just going to stay the
[2:16] same oh yes we're just going to stay the
[2:18] same it's going to be this body
[2:20] glorified all right this body changed in
[2:22] the atom I'm going to be changed in this
[2:26] okay
[2:29] but we better have patience for it
[2:31] because if we won't have patience for it
[2:33] all ran his race he had patience for his
[2:36] time but Paul ran his race to a point
[2:38] and then he said a crown of life has
[2:40] been laid up for me he knows that even
[2:43] job said in my flesh I'll see God when I
[2:45] joke been dead for thousands of years
[2:48] but in his flesh he's going to see God
[2:51] God's going to bring up a resurrection
[2:53] that's going to
[2:55] it'll baffle the scientists that's for
[2:57] sure right because the scientists won't
[2:59] know anything about it it's nothing that
[3:01] uh you know won't be no doctors in
[3:04] heaven or anything like that it'll just
[3:06] be this body made new like we were
[3:08] talking about Wednesday night I hope
[3:10] everybody enjoyed that it was something
[3:12] that I wanted to bring out you know that
[3:14] was that was pressing on people's heart
[3:17] people say new body
[3:19] well it is going to be new because this
[3:21] one is old right
[3:23] but it's going to be the same framework
[3:24] does everybody understand what I'm
[3:25] saying and we're not going to throw this
[3:26] one away and get a new one like we sell
[3:29] a car and get a new car right now it's
[3:31] going to be the old car magnet that's
[3:33] right okay all right we're not gonna
[3:35] throw this one away this framework's
[3:37] gonna be here this is what I'm going to
[3:39] look like through the Millennium at the
[3:42] in that 20 year old body all right and
[3:44] actually what's inside of us because of
[3:46] the born-again experience is already
[3:49] made new that's right that's why we can
[3:52] say sitting in Heavenly places now this
[3:54] is not sitting in Heavenly places that's
[3:55] right this is in dimension one two three
[3:58] that's right right lifelike matter or to
[4:02] mention is demons we skip all through
[4:04] that jump and our soul is actually
[4:05] living in the sixth Dimension everybody
[4:08] understand that that's right because
[4:10] it's Eternal yes but it has come here we
[4:13] don't have to go get it it's come here
[4:15] to get us right it's the vehicle to get
[4:18] us back to that new body this one made
[4:23] new right the Earth's not going to be
[4:25] destroyed and God created the Earth
[4:27] listen God's finished creating then the
[4:29] bible say that Bennett he's finished
[4:31] he's resting now he's finished his
[4:34] Creations or whatever he's created is
[4:35] going to stay that way all right so he's
[4:37] created the Earth to be inhabited that's
[4:39] what it's going to be and we're going to
[4:40] be in flesh bodies inhabiting this Earth
[4:43] we're not going to be angels
[4:47] we're going to be human that's right
[4:49] because that's what we are now we're
[4:51] humans right we're not Angelic beings
[4:55] we're supernatural beings by the new
[4:57] birth but we're not Angelic beings We're
[4:59] Not Angels right right and angels are
[5:02] not going to have wings that's right
[5:04] they don't need them
[5:07] they don't what do you need wings for
[5:09] that's right and a glorified body Jesus
[5:12] didn't need Wings to get out of here on
[5:14] the resurrection did he or you know 50
[5:15] days after that no he didn't leave that
[5:18] he just stepped over into another
[5:19] dimension
[5:21] which is faster than this one this body
[5:24] can't go through that wall because it's
[5:26] made of Mom and Daddy but when this
[5:27] body's changed in the atoms and it gets
[5:30] faster than these first three dimensions
[5:32] we're just going to go right through the
[5:34] wall right because Jesus proved that
[5:35] when he come through the wall and then
[5:37] he ate flesh he ate fish right he ate
[5:40] fish and it became part of him it didn't
[5:42] go and hit the floor and people laugh
[5:45] about that but that's true I mean if you
[5:47] if you saw somebody walking through the
[5:49] wall you'd think he's like Casper the
[5:50] ghost that he had no form but the people
[5:52] were touching it right but he was solid
[5:55] as I'm solid
[5:56] he was solid he said put your hand in my
[6:00] side well that womb's still there put
[6:03] your hand in my side touch me I'm not a
[6:05] ghost because they thought maybe it was
[6:06] a spoon we would too somebody come
[6:08] walking through the wall and stood right
[6:09] here we'd we'd wonder what kind of body
[6:11] that person had so that's right I was
[6:14] thinking of the people in the graves
[6:16] I mean literally in cemeteries
[6:19] their body's going to have to be
[6:21] glorified to come out of them right so
[6:24] they can because there's you're not
[6:26] going to have any visible notice nope
[6:28] people have risen that's the reason why
[6:30] that's why it's going to be a secret
[6:32] coming this is a secret coming there is
[6:35] not going to be a time when you can go
[6:36] out into the cemetery and see the graves
[6:39] opened up why do they need that
[6:42] don't need it right they're just gonna
[6:45] because you know what they're faster
[6:46] than what's holding them
[6:48] their body's going to become faster
[6:50] because their soul is going to come from
[6:51] another dimension here that's right so
[6:54] what's going to hinder them grabbing
[6:57] this thing
[6:58] glorify it and stand right here Among Us
[7:01] that's right and be trying and there
[7:03] will be chains the ones that are alive
[7:04] and remain we're going to be changed in
[7:05] the morning of an eye while they're
[7:07] standing here they're going to get their
[7:08] change first but it's going to be
[7:10] because of the word that's here on the
[7:12] Earth
[7:13] and it's got to be
[7:15] on
[7:16] this Earth not the Earth the ball it's
[7:19] got to be fulfilled in this earth all
[7:21] right so but we got to have patience
[7:24] we gotta have patience to wait for it we
[7:26] and I think you know the Lord lets us go
[7:29] on sometimes and lets us keep
[7:31] we'll win Lord we'll win 77 Lord or 80
[7:34] or 86 or 1988 or 2000 and people set
[7:39] days but when they do what happens you
[7:41] get discouraged we don't but most people
[7:43] that are
[7:45] I say the mixed multitude they get
[7:47] discouraged because it doesn't happen
[7:49] when they think it's going to happen
[7:52] if it happened when we thought it was
[7:54] going to happen it wouldn't be a secret
[7:55] that's right that's right that's right I
[7:58] mean it wouldn't be a secret because
[8:01] there's one thing for sure if any man
[8:02] says a day specific day or time
[8:05] he's wrong that's right I don't worry
[8:07] about them I don't I don't worry about
[8:09] them people actually that one guy that
[8:10] made a prediction he's already dead so
[8:12] that's right
[8:13] yeah why are you gonna die but
[8:19] um the grades will I mean the taxes will
[8:22] actually be empty correct right so will
[8:25] these people people that have gone on
[8:27] before until they wake up like in their
[8:28] attached it and I know they don't have
[8:30] to break the ground and come out but you
[8:32] know I think really because that's going
[8:34] to be just a travel park
[8:37] uh what she's saying is is are they
[8:40] going to wake up inside their casket no
[8:41] I think they're going to understand that
[8:43] when they get here that they're going to
[8:44] meet that body
[8:47] okay I don't think they have to go down
[8:49] in there and get it but now remember one
[8:51] thing's for sure let's take this by
[8:53] scripture Jesus had to go back to his
[8:55] tomb to get his body
[8:57] now he didn't have to roll that stone
[8:59] away either
[9:01] that was a symbol for us that was for us
[9:05] that stone did not have to be rolled
[9:07] away for him to walk out of that tune
[9:09] that's right he walked right through the
[9:12] wall so them rocks it didn't matter if
[9:13] it was 800 feet thick and weighed 10
[9:15] billion pounds he'd walk right through
[9:17] it so that so that was a symbol that now
[9:19] there is an empty tomb and man can look
[9:21] into that tomb and see nothing all right
[9:23] but see this one's not gonna let me this
[9:25] one's not gonna happen that way
[9:27] the world can't go out there and say
[9:30] look at all these empty tombs see that
[9:31] wouldn't be a secret catching away that
[9:34] wouldn't be a secret catching they're
[9:35] going to walk out there and look and
[9:37] even brother Brown said people are going
[9:38] to keep going to church and think
[9:39] they're getting saved you see what I'm
[9:41] saying so so this great powerful thing
[9:43] is going to happen to the bride is going
[9:45] to be so secret the neighbors are not
[9:46] even going to know about it right
[9:48] they're just going to think you
[9:49] disappeared
[9:51] okay
[9:53] what a great God we have a program says
[9:56] they even eat but sharks are a lions or
[9:58] pipe or whatever you're still going to
[10:00] come I read that quote Wednesday
[10:04] redneck quote Wednesday night lives they
[10:06] eat you over here and
[10:08] deposit you over there
[10:09] what does that matter yeah
[10:12] we're gonna bring them all back together
[10:14] when did I just die when they die and
[10:17] they get from the bodies when do they go
[10:19] to right now because they don't get a
[10:21] new body well right now
[10:23] no they're waiting in glory they've got
[10:26] a glorified theophany so it's not a
[10:29] glorified body it's not a flesh with us
[10:31] well they know they're in the sixth
[10:32] Dimension oh that's where all you know
[10:35] that's where brother Branham went to the
[10:36] sixth Dimension and he saw all the
[10:38] people that was his Converse he hugged
[10:40] them knew they were women because of the
[10:43] field you know of the form
[10:46] and he had his hair back remember he
[10:49] said he reached a penny so I got my hair
[10:51] back you know
[10:52] and then he uh
[10:54] then they said my precious brother my
[10:56] precious brother well they told him he
[10:58] had to go back of course obviously
[11:01] but they couldn't come back it's not
[11:03] time for them to come back yet but they
[11:04] are in a glorified condition but not a
[11:06] glorified body now remember you
[11:09] glorified body
[11:10] is this body
[11:13] made new and here we go back to the new
[11:16] part again Jesus is in a glorified body
[11:19] he's the only one that the Bible says
[11:21] has reached immortality now immortality
[11:25] means you were once immortal
[11:27] and now you're immoral right okay that's
[11:30] right that's why it's immortality that's
[11:32] why Angels can't be Mortals and Angels
[11:34] can't have the immortality
[11:37] they never was Immortal but Jesus the
[11:41] Bible says became lower than the Angels
[11:44] right came down lower than the angels to
[11:47] become us that's right that he could
[11:49] take us back above the angels right
[11:52] right that's a sterling that's a sermon
[11:56] and not just fresh too I didn't get that
[11:59] that was fresh but when he come down
[12:02] here and get us because we can't go up
[12:04] we couldn't go up because remember like
[12:06] I said we're planted in corruption
[12:07] corruption can't see that other
[12:10] dimension
[12:11] brother randleman's body didn't even
[12:13] travel across into the sixth dimension
[12:15] remember he looked back
[12:17] and his body his human body was laying
[12:20] on the on the bed that body didn't come
[12:22] with him God just let him being a
[12:25] prophet
[12:26] being being in the Supernatural realm
[12:28] that's right God could allow that man to
[12:31] lay there but be in this other dimension
[12:33] but his human body was not in that
[12:35] dimension
[12:37] because what happened there this is
[12:40] what's going to happen
[12:42] I'm 54 years old if I die today I go
[12:45] into the sixth Dimension my body stays
[12:47] here you plant it in the ground that's
[12:48] what was you plant it in corruption but
[12:51] see when that comes out and I don't have
[12:54] enough Faith to change this thing or
[12:56] have enough word change this thing I go
[12:59] into another dimension and wait on
[13:00] somebody
[13:02] that has enough word and faith and
[13:06] revelation
[13:07] because if it changes him right
[13:10] it'll change me
[13:13] because we'll have a body like into his
[13:15] glorious body so Jesus is already
[13:16] immortal he was already raised from the
[13:19] dead he's already been mortal now he's
[13:21] Immortal and he's in the seventh
[13:23] Dimension remember when brother Brown
[13:24] went in the sixth dimension
[13:26] We're not gonna finish patience again
[13:28] today
[13:29] we must have patience oh yeah sure
[13:31] patience sure
[13:34] patience but my brother Ryan went into
[13:36] the sixth Dimension he said where's the
[13:38] Lord he said he's higher you can't see
[13:41] him now
[13:42] now this sixth Dimension was
[13:46] eternal this is eternal thoughts of God
[13:49] but Jesus wasn't there because he
[13:51] already picked up his human body
[13:55] so he was in a human mortal form that
[13:58] was made Immortal these people left
[14:01] their mortal body
[14:03] and took their soul or their theophany
[14:05] into that next Dimension sixth Dimension
[14:08] and they're waiting because remember
[14:09] brother Brown said they said well we
[14:11] don't eat or drink here
[14:13] we're waiting in other words we're
[14:16] waiting to get back into our right to be
[14:18] conditioned you think man that would be
[14:19] a right to be conditioned because
[14:20] remember he didn't want to go back into
[14:21] his body
[14:23] but that's not the right to be
[14:24] conditioned they weren't human beings in
[14:26] that dimension
[14:28] they were Supernatural Souls right
[14:32] Supernatural Spirits amen not humans now
[14:36] they had remember when I said Wednesday
[14:38] night you keep the framework they kept
[14:41] that framework when they went there
[14:44] hope he saw hope knew who she was right
[14:47] so she had went and changed into
[14:50] somebody that looked different he knew
[14:51] who that was and he had a reality that
[14:53] he knew who she was
[14:55] right right but remember she hugged his
[14:57] neck and said my precious brother she
[14:59] didn't acknowledge Him as husband
[15:00] because in that Dimension she wasn't but
[15:03] now remember
[15:06] don't forget this key brother Brown had
[15:09] another dream
[15:13] he had another dream
[15:15] where remember he said that rewards were
[15:17] being given out he said they called my
[15:20] name he said I felt something right on
[15:23] this side
[15:24] and I felt something on this side and he
[15:27] said I looked and I was hoping he said I
[15:28] looked and that was me then he said oh I
[15:30] knew he said neither knew that hope was
[15:31] jealous jealous woman jealous of you
[15:35] know other people but said there was no
[15:37] jealousy and he said we walked straight
[15:38] into eternity there had something come
[15:40] about
[15:41] when you come back and connect with your
[15:43] flesh that spirit that you had here
[15:47] is going to be made new
[15:49] and you're going to realize
[15:51] that you lived here and I realized that
[15:53] my mother was my mother
[15:55] but there'll be no other part of that
[15:56] she'll be my sister over there but we'll
[15:59] realize what happened down here because
[16:01] we're going to be back into a human body
[16:05] the one we lived in but changed new
[16:11] it was so beautiful when you pointed out
[16:14] the picture that God took is not of a
[16:16] swim leader no 1920 repair Sears and
[16:19] whatever and to prove that to me it's
[16:23] the picture God saw of us over there at
[16:27] the end time
[16:30] see that's what he's looking at that's
[16:32] what I want you to see wayne tonight
[16:33] he's not looking at this he can't look
[16:36] we sin every day that's right we're
[16:39] Sinners saved by grace and the most even
[16:41] when we get the godliness the more the
[16:43] most Godly we can be we're still in a
[16:46] fallen condition that's right so don't
[16:49] ever forget that because when we start
[16:50] elevating ourselves to a place then
[16:52] you're right there with the devil you
[16:54] need to realize one thing it's an inward
[16:55] work
[16:57] yeah I think what proves that is that
[17:00] Vision that he had of uh the baby baby
[17:04] daughter that died
[17:05] saw her as a young woman didn't
[17:08] recognize them but that's what that's
[17:11] the picture God took well I'm going to
[17:13] bring that out Wednesday night but I
[17:14] didn't want to confuse the younger ones
[17:16] a little bit more but yeah that's true
[17:17] the one the member
[17:20] remember Sharon Rose was a six-month-old
[17:23] baby when she died but when he had the
[17:25] dream about the wagon and all that you
[17:27] know he said well where's Billy Billy's
[17:29] over there she was talking excuse me
[17:31] beautiful 18 to 20 year old girl well
[17:34] she was in her theophany she was in her
[17:36] condition she should have been in had
[17:38] there not been a thought
[17:40] see that's what we gotta look at we
[17:43] gotta look at not
[17:45] the things that we see here on the Earth
[17:49] but we got to realize that there is a 20
[17:51] year old man or woman living in these
[17:54] old bodies
[17:55] and it's wanting to get out
[17:58] and only two things is going to release
[18:00] it and that's death and the change one
[18:02] of the two there's no other way around
[18:04] it we're not going to go under it or
[18:06] over it you're either going to die and
[18:08] wait for somebody to change your body
[18:09] but you know what you got to have first
[18:10] you gotta have a new birth that's right
[18:12] that's right you got to have that
[18:13] Genesis 126 man or woman in you when you
[18:17] die because if you don't that's right
[18:18] you don't get it you go to The Fifth
[18:21] Dimension you go to the center day and
[18:22] you have to be raised up and have to
[18:23] give an account of what you did in his
[18:25] body
[18:27] remember the Bible says you were you
[18:29] were in Revelations 21 I think it says
[18:31] they were they were uh
[18:34] uh they were judged by their works right
[18:36] oh man I don't want to be judged by my
[18:38] words
[18:39] I won't be judged by The Works that
[18:41] Jesus did this morning 2000 years ago
[18:44] that's right that's what I won't be
[18:46] judged by I won't be judged by that now
[18:47] if I'm judged by that now I have the new
[18:49] birth then you know I gotta I always say
[18:52] you got a free ticket well you do have a
[18:53] free ticket but the statue of perfect
[18:55] man still
[18:57] um you got to go through that you gotta
[18:59] show that you're a Christian amen not
[19:02] just say that you're a Christian you got
[19:03] to show it it's got to be an outward
[19:04] appearance of an end would work
[19:06] all right same thing with all these
[19:07] virtues you got to show that you you
[19:09] have Godly patient patience just like
[19:12] God because you know what God's waited
[19:14] for an eternity
[19:16] for us to get back to the right to be
[19:18] conviction he's waited for an eternity
[19:21] for us to get back to a right to be
[19:22] commissioned and he's so patient because
[19:25] he knew the plan Gotta Have It remember
[19:28] it was his plan
[19:29] what an hour it was his plan
[19:32] and to be real honest with you you
[19:35] didn't have nothing no way to get you
[19:37] here
[19:39] but God knew what she was going to look
[19:40] like like I said Wednesday night and
[19:42] what a great God that took this one and
[19:44] met this one back in your great great
[19:46] great great great great grandfather
[19:47] grandmother and here you come all the
[19:50] way down that line that's right because
[19:52] God put those genetics together because
[19:54] he saw you here you've got to see poor
[19:56] knowledge if you don't see poor
[19:57] knowledge like somebody was talking
[19:58] about after service if you don't see
[20:00] foreign knowledge then God did take the
[20:02] tube and say this is the way it's going
[20:05] to be and pull you through it no he
[20:06] looked down through time and saw what
[20:08] you would be and what you would look
[20:10] like
[20:11] that's right because he's the one that
[20:12] had you in the mind first amen
[20:14] and he can't change his mind that's
[20:16] right so not to change his mind he bred
[20:19] this one to this one this one to this
[20:21] one this one this one this to get your
[20:23] nature here oh yes and then he molded
[20:26] with that nature that's right because
[20:28] remember we're molded In His Image not
[20:30] right not him holding an iron we were
[20:33] more than a new image
[20:35] before there was Angels he thought of us
[20:37] so he had us already already there
[20:40] but God has an order he created angels
[20:44] cherubim seraphims
[20:47] angels to do this angels to do that an
[20:49] angel to watch over you and absolutely I
[20:51] believe you did get an angel when you
[20:53] were born
[20:54] because God saw you at a certain age and
[20:57] you know what he can't change his mind
[20:59] that's right right but what we got to do
[21:03] is it's not worry about this have
[21:05] patience
[21:06] that that 20 year old body is not going
[21:09] to come to us
[21:11] that 20 year old body is going to Spring
[21:12] forth from us that's right that's right
[21:14] like the flowers like the things you see
[21:16] now those those flowers didn't come from
[21:18] somewhere and were you know they the
[21:20] flowers sprang up from the plant that
[21:22] they came from that's why the springtime
[21:24] is the resurrection time oh yes because
[21:27] it was all dead we were all dead and sin
[21:29] we were dead and trespassing we were
[21:31] dead to the world we were born dead
[21:34] we were born dead yes yes
[21:38] what what'd the scripture say this um
[21:41] a few days in full of trouble all right
[21:44] life joke said life is a bit of April
[21:48] what if you live 80 years
[21:52] I didn't need my blip on the on the
[21:55] timeline of life
[21:57] right
[21:58] but what about all the people you've
[22:00] outlived that God's took on that that
[22:03] many things have happened to him like
[22:05] Aaron was talking about that Wednesday
[22:06] night after the service week that's why
[22:09] I said we got to understand that that
[22:10] it's not exactly has to be this same
[22:13] flesh that I'm standing in exactly sell
[22:15] myself right because what about the
[22:18] people that like to take Noah because he
[22:21] survived the flood and he died
[22:23] but his body has already deteriorated
[22:26] went back to chemicals those chemicals
[22:28] got in the water an animal drink the
[22:30] water it went into an animal's body it
[22:32] already went into the trees then it went
[22:34] up into the vapor so you know don't
[22:35] let's don't try to wind ourselves into
[22:37] that makes people crazy that's right
[22:39] right it makes craziness to keep
[22:43] thinking back just think just know one
[22:45] thing for sure that God's gonna bring
[22:46] whatever he needs you know all they
[22:48] needed was one cell to get you here
[22:51] oh yes
[22:54] that's all we needed he needed one sperm
[22:57] cell to get you here is all he needed
[22:58] that's right
[23:00] so what does he need he only needs one
[23:02] sale to get you back that's right
[23:04] because he's a Creator he puts a sale on
[23:06] sale you didn't I didn't the doctor
[23:08] didn't
[23:10] I saw a calf we I didn't help them but
[23:13] we were down there in case they needed
[23:14] help pulling a calf out of them out of a
[23:16] cow and that little cap just within
[23:19] seconds
[23:21] was breathing looking around
[23:24] moving
[23:27] and within about 10 minutes it was
[23:29] standing up you know what it did he
[23:31] didn't go over there and start sucking
[23:32] on his mama's leg
[23:33] right
[23:35] it's getting you exactly which he had to
[23:37] go to you understand what I'm saying
[23:38] there's a nature you see God and your
[23:40] boy just makes you sometimes want to cry
[23:42] that that even nature
[23:45] shows God that's right amen and that's
[23:48] life
[23:49] but what about the life you give you
[23:50] though he gave you a life insult
[23:53] he gave you a life yes right and
[23:56] that soul to him is more precious than
[23:58] any life that's on this Earth because if
[24:00] you come from God
[24:04] that's what I want to end on Wednesday
[24:05] but I forgot maybe the Lord didn't want
[24:07] me to say it but I'll say it now if you
[24:08] come if you realize you came from God
[24:10] there's only one place you're going to
[24:11] go
[24:12] you don't go back to God
[24:15] if you realize that you came from God
[24:18] right yeah
[24:19] and you're a genetic makeup of the
[24:21] almighty there's only one thing for you
[24:23] to do let's go back that's right Jesus
[24:26] said that see that's what I mean Jesus
[24:28] said the same thing I go to my God and
[24:30] your God
[24:31] my father and your father yeah but then
[24:33] he said I come from God yeah and I go
[24:35] back to God that's right you know why he
[24:38] was God I see we're not God that way
[24:40] he's the Big G with a little jivo
[24:44] the Big T came to get the Little G's
[24:47] that's right because he wanted us to be
[24:49] him made manifest in another form called
[24:52] his children or his bride that's right
[24:55] um call it what you made children bride
[24:57] I don't care I'm calling Daddy and
[24:59] husband at the same time doesn't matter
[25:01] because we're married to it all of us
[25:04] we're all feminists down here in the
[25:06] body of Christ okay but uh
[25:09] let's not talk about patients anymore
[25:12] I want to read I want to read one quote
[25:16] from these other notes I've been trying
[25:18] to get to for three weeks
[25:22] no wonder Paul could stand in the face
[25:24] of death and say oh death where's your
[25:25] sting Greg where's your bakery sure the
[25:27] tribulations he had learned the love of
[25:29] God suffering brings patience Works
[25:32] tribulation to bring patience of course
[25:33] now patience makes love and trust and
[25:36] when that bull got within about six or
[25:37] eight feet I mean he just threw his feet
[25:39] out and stopped and he looked at me look
[25:40] this way in that way you don't
[25:42] understand that's when the bull
[25:44] that's when the bull uh
[25:47] was charging him
[25:49] and love took over you know what he had
[25:51] to have a lot of patience
[25:54] well let's read this last one everybody
[25:56] kind of okay with this well with
[25:58] patience we we kind of went through it
[26:00] but listen this is going into godliness
