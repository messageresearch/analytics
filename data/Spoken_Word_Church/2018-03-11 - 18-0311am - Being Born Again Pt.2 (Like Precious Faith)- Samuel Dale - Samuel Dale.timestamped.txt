[9:49] I guess you noticed when you came up
[9:51] today that we have red doors now coming
[9:55] up so you know we opened the door to
[9:58] make them read that's when and he's
[10:00] always wanted red doors so we got that
[10:03] done and then and nany and Terrence and
[10:08] Lisa came up yesterday and we've got
[10:10] everything pretty well back together but
[10:12] the whole thing is painted all the
[10:14] starway overhead and the things and it
[10:18] it's you know looking good so that way
[10:20] we we can at least handle that it's been
[10:22] quite a while since it's been painted
[10:23] but we think the Lord for all it's
[10:26] helped and done and you know you doing
[10:30] those thing okay first Peter 1:18 for as
[10:37] much as you know that you were not
[10:40] redeemed with corruptible things as
[10:42] silver and gold from your vain
[10:45] conversation received by tradition from
[10:48] your father's in other words you you
[10:52] there was no redemption under that point
[10:56] that they kept it to that and did not go
[10:59] on to Christ alright but your what now
[11:03] you redeemed but with the precious blood
[11:05] of Christ as of a lamb without blemish
[11:08] and without spot overly was foreordained
[11:11] before the foundation of the world but
[11:14] was manifest in these last times for you
[11:17] who by him to believe in God that raised
[11:20] him up from the dead and gave him glory
[11:24] that your faith and hope might be in God
[11:28] seeing you how purifies your souls and
[11:31] obeying the truth
[11:32] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[11:35] of the Brethren see that you love one
[11:37] another with a pure heart fervently
[11:40] being born again not of corruptible seed
[11:44] but of incorruptible by the Word of God
[11:47] which about us liveth and abideth
[11:50] forever huh yeah trying to get started
[11:55] if we can on to the message of the
[11:58] statue of a perfect man so we'll read
[12:00] from 2nd Peter 1 all right now we're not
[12:06] going to get in through the virtues and
[12:08] the thing we're going to enter it as we
[12:11] have from the other start at the
[12:13] foundation and move upward and go
[12:16] through as we're doing
[12:18] I said Simon Peter servant an apostle of
[12:21] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[12:24] like precious faith with us through the
[12:27] righteousness of God and our Savior
[12:29] Jesus Christ grace and peace be
[12:31] multiplied unto you through the
[12:33] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[12:37] according as his divine power hath given
[12:40] unto all things that pertain unto life
[12:43] and godliness through the knowledge of
[12:46] him that has called us to glory and
[12:49] virtue whereby are given unto us
[12:52] exceeding great and precious promises
[12:55] that by these you might be partakers of
[12:58] the divine nature having escaped the
[13:02] corruption that is in the world through
[13:03] lust and beside this giving all
[13:06] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[13:10] to virtue knowledge you may be seated
[13:13] the Lord that is blessing to the reading
[13:16] of the word now we're going to try to
[13:20] move in we spent a lot of time covering
[13:25] the Old Testament and the people and
[13:28] they're there what took place but always
[13:31] remember one thing that our thought has
[13:34] always been that whatever you start with
[13:38] is what you must end up with further
[13:43] advance yes you know
[13:46] but you you can't start off my whole
[13:49] saying is you you can't start off in
[13:51] Genesis with a white dog and wind up in
[13:54] the Book of Revelations with a black dog
[13:56] even though you still got a dog
[13:58] it won't work it's got to be the same
[14:00] all the way other than just an unfolding
[14:05] our being made manifest what was started
[14:09] you know in the beginning so salvation
[14:12] started as we covered Wednesday night
[14:14] salvation started with the basis of Adam
[14:20] and Eve
[14:21] you know God had them the way he wanted
[14:25] them had they remind and no sin entered
[14:29] the picture then we would have come
[14:32] forth as they were and Adam and Eve had
[14:37] eternal life in their soul they I say it
[14:41] because and a lot of people don't bleed
[14:43] no I don't believe that
[14:44] but according to brother Branham and
[14:45] blasphemous names he said that was what
[14:48] took place when God breathed into their
[14:50] nostrils see there was no sin back there
[14:53] so then he could breathe eternal life
[14:55] into their nostrils because that's the
[14:57] way he started his people all right as
[15:01] us emphasizing Wednesday night as he
[15:04] started it it was the way he wants to
[15:06] end it which it means what so then on
[15:09] the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost
[15:11] came it gave eternal life to the souls
[15:16] of the people there in the upper room
[15:19] all right it did not pay the whole price
[15:23] or do the whole point of redeeming the
[15:25] body or the spirit it was just that soul
[15:28] that was made eternal by the new birth
[15:32] or not then in that he started his
[15:37] church on the day of Pentecost think his
[15:41] people okay same his atom same as he
[15:45] with eternal life and soul the yet body
[15:49] and spirit not finished alright so then
[15:52] as he started out and as I we tried to
[15:55] cover see then Adam and Eve fell from
[15:58] the position
[15:59] that they were first granted they never
[16:03] lost their eternal life in their soul
[16:05] they lost the right of the Tree of Life
[16:09] right they could have went to the Tree
[16:13] of Life and and been made eternal in
[16:16] body and spirit had they stayed with it
[16:18] but the fall took that part into being
[16:21] all right so you start on the day of
[16:24] Pentecost with eternal life into the
[16:29] souls of mankind but then before God
[16:34] could come forth and manifest himself in
[16:38] the way he wanted you see the church
[16:40] falling away until it came down to the
[16:46] position that they they did not lose
[16:48] their eternal life in their soul
[16:50] no but they lost the revelation of God's
[16:55] Word they lost the tree of knowledge I
[16:59] mean the tree of life took of the tree
[17:02] of knowledge and as they did it
[17:04] deteriorated down to were that you come
[17:07] in to one of the dark ages and the
[17:11] things happening all right and then you
[17:14] see the loser starting out Wesley's
[17:16] coming forth then you see Pentecost
[17:19] coming in with justification
[17:22] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[17:24] Ghost bringing them in to eternal life
[17:29] the well I always said because I don't
[17:33] want people to think the wrong thing
[17:35] Martin Luther had eternal life in his
[17:37] soul but he's in the body of Christ and
[17:39] the only way you can get in the body of
[17:41] Christ is to have eternal life you may
[17:44] not have manifested so much as to
[17:47] justification sanctification emphasis on
[17:51] a lot of that but it still you've got to
[17:53] go through it because Martin Luther
[17:55] surely repented of his sins right surely
[18:00] he accepted Jesus Christ
[18:02] all right surely he come to a sanctified
[18:05] state in his life he may have had still
[18:08] a lot of other Riccardi wouldn't the age
[18:09] or the time to bring
[18:11] but he still had it West we had the new
[18:15] birth for their day they had those times
[18:19] all right then we come back to the point
[18:23] of bringing the new birth I mean we come
[18:27] to the point of the new birth at their
[18:28] pinnacle and then in the end time when
[18:30] you're coming back to on Zeus's Street
[18:33] you're coming back to that Holy Ghost
[18:35] coming in to people all right and see
[18:40] then that was still not enough that's
[18:43] where brother I'm told the Pentecostals
[18:45] he said that's where you messed up he
[18:47] said cause you thought you got
[18:49] everything dark and he said no you just
[18:52] got the birth
[18:54] you just got born again you just got
[18:57] into the body we said now you need to
[19:00] progress on so now you will see the
[19:03] stature of a perfect man is that message
[19:05] of growth development as we proceed into
[19:09] it all right but we want to stay now
[19:12] right on that basis of faith because
[19:17] we've covered that in the Old Testament
[19:19] faith was to believe God right in the
[19:24] Old Testament they believed God they
[19:26] accepted God as to what was taking place
[19:29] and believed him and followed it and
[19:32] they had faith in God all right so truly
[19:36] you can see that he's as he started the
[19:39] church on the day of Pentecost you know
[19:42] it would be back to what it was now I've
[19:46] covered this over and over to give just
[19:49] a little bit where it won't get lost the
[19:53] bread around him will say he said I met
[19:57] people that had the baptism of the holy
[19:59] ghost just like the day of Pentecost
[20:03] then he turns around and calls them
[20:05] babies right so then you got to remember
[20:14] on the day of Pentecost you've got a
[20:15] split condition it took place you got a
[20:19] hundred and twenty in the Upper Room
[20:21] that at least
[20:23] a few of them had to work planning
[20:29] that's up to God how many that was in
[20:32] that 120 but that's you know I believe
[20:36] Mary was there don't you
[20:38] I believe a lot of them was down in the
[20:40] upper room to receive that new birth all
[20:43] right now then that put them at a
[20:47] certain position in Christ and made them
[20:50] the forefathers are the beginning are
[20:52] the faith of the fathers as we call it
[20:55] put them in a great position that around
[20:59] center disciples had these virtues but
[21:04] he said they did not have the headstone
[21:06] he said cause it hadn't come yet now we
[21:09] stay playing on that point all right but
[21:12] see they had been tutored and trained
[21:14] for three and a half years and when the
[21:16] Holy Ghost fell it could put them in a
[21:19] greater depth because you're gonna have
[21:22] to have God didn't use novices to write
[21:25] his word or bring the New Testament into
[21:26] being alright so he brought his children
[21:31] grown grown up in the Lord for three and
[21:35] a half years he tutored him but then the
[21:38] 3,000 outside only heard one master and
[21:43] when they heard that one message they
[21:45] were born again it could not put them in
[21:49] the pyramid to where the disciples were
[21:51] but it put him in the pyramid and put
[21:54] him in the body of Christ go that is the
[21:56] pyramid all right see then you can see
[22:00] brother branham's right when he would
[22:01] say he met people with the Holy Ghost
[22:03] just like the day of Pentecost you
[22:07] wouldn't probably necessarily
[22:08] necessarily referring to the Apostles
[22:11] and their doctrine because like I said
[22:13] he turn on call them babies but on the
[22:16] day of Pentecost you had that split
[22:18] condition that's always helped me to
[22:21] understand God in his ways to remember
[22:26] this group for three and a half years
[22:29] this group only heard one message you
[22:33] can't put them on the day of Pentecost
[22:35] through the three thousand you put them
[22:37] at them new
[22:37] arts of faith we'll get to it but you
[22:39] don't bring them wound up in here where
[22:41] the faith of the Father that's where the
[22:43] growth development comes in that's what
[22:45] the statue of a perfect man was written
[22:46] for that's what Peters talking about
[22:51] they're trying to tell people how to
[22:53] come to where he was is that sensible
[22:57] there comes a great Apostle Paul he was
[23:01] standing at that place cuz he didn't
[23:03] have to go with a disciple he went to
[23:06] the backside of desert and God brought
[23:07] him you know remember Paul was a prophet
[23:11] so you got it you got to have those
[23:13] lines but all right now remember that
[23:15] and don't forget it
[23:16] then when we say something don't go well
[23:19] I don't want this gold is enough just
[23:22] remember what I'm sayin the disciples
[23:29] had heard the word and the Holy Ghost
[23:33] can quicken only the word you've hailed
[23:36] as you've received it and that's the
[23:39] scripture says they understood it the
[23:42] parables it says they kept it all right
[23:45] and there's one more something but they
[23:48] held it they kept it they understood it
[23:52] all right they knew those things they
[23:56] knew there was no tourists regards they
[24:01] now know thoughts of two or three guards
[24:03] back there but they did how to teach the
[24:06] others so that's what Peter's we'll get
[24:09] back to it in the message Peter is
[24:11] telling the people then are already born
[24:15] again we'll get to that he's telling
[24:19] them how to come to where he was that
[24:22] and here comes brother on him with a new
[24:25] birth right and then what opens the word
[24:29] and what does he teach the Statue of
[24:32] perfume and to do what to shorten how to
[24:34] get work he was which he was back where
[24:38] the disciples were like I said Paul
[24:41] never went with Peter and them and and
[24:43] learned it from this he went to the
[24:44] backside of the desert with God but a
[24:47] random didn't how Peter them to he had
[24:50] to read
[24:50] the word yes but he didn't have them to
[24:54] teach him as that but he went to the
[24:58] backside of the desert and come out of
[25:00] it with a statue of a perfect man all
[25:02] right but just remember he's the one
[25:05] that said it I did he said it took him
[25:08] 30 some years to be able to preach that
[25:10] one message he said well he knowed all
[25:16] that he said that I just got the other
[25:18] day I learned the woods how this ties in
[25:22] with something like don't preach on all
[25:25] right we'll get to that as we go along
[25:27] okay
[25:28] and try to do and that way don't lose it
[25:31] then cause God ain't gonna put Martin
[25:36] Luther even though he was a messenger to
[25:38] the age God never had him to write no
[25:40] Bible John Wesley was a great man but
[25:47] God didn't have him to write no Bible
[25:49] Zeus's Street were great people great
[25:54] men come down through there great things
[25:56] took place but God never allowed them to
[25:59] write a Bible now he didn't now brother
[26:01] branham to write a Bible but he allowed
[26:03] him to what to give us the understanding
[26:07] of the Bible right they could get a
[26:12] little bit for each age they could get
[26:14] so much for their time but they couldn't
[26:17] get the fullness it had to wait until
[26:20] the Prophet came so we're writing the
[26:22] line of the message right all right but
[26:25] now listen see we've tried to cover so
[26:30] keep that in mind then if you have any
[26:32] problems about it just come back to that
[26:34] thought that you got 120 upper room
[26:43] heard the word live with the word for
[26:48] three and a half years a lot of new but
[26:51] then the others just heard one message
[26:53] so when brother Allen said he met people
[26:55] with all the ghosts just like the damn
[26:58] penny College well you got the two
[27:00] powers from today at Pentecost
[27:03] because you'd say well I don't believe
[27:05] that people got the Holy Ghost like them
[27:07] apostles they don't have to get it like
[27:12] the Apostles all they got to do is get
[27:14] the born-again experience under their
[27:15] Pentecostal faith
[27:17] and they're in the body of Christ
[27:20] because it only one faith one Lord one
[27:23] baptism or all right now how many times
[27:25] we went over this so you can't have see
[27:29] somebody if the Prophet would say being
[27:32] contrary to the word but claim the same
[27:35] Holy Ghost come on then Paul had this
[27:42] constantly get onto those that corrupt
[27:46] it's the Corinthians there's really
[27:49] that's called the book of Corrections
[27:50] and he took him to books not that's what
[27:56] it was was correcting those people well
[28:00] cause there's babies What did he say
[28:01] about it
[28:02] he says you your babies you desire the
[28:05] sincere milk of the word but he said we
[28:10] need to get to a place that we can eat
[28:11] some made he said in other words we need
[28:15] to get to the places if we can eat were
[28:16] the apostles we're eating all right so
[28:21] keep that in your mind now as we go
[28:23] along and you won't get lost in the
[28:25] thought all right now we drop back to
[28:27] the day all right so we've been covering
[28:33] that you must be born again
[28:38] all right we've covered over and over
[28:42] that the born to get experience the new
[28:47] birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[28:51] all one in the same because your mind
[28:57] don't let you think see you can you can
[28:59] look at a bird kind of like and you can
[29:02] can look at a born-again experience but
[29:04] then your your mind goes up into the
[29:06] skies to think of a baptism coming down
[29:09] did it come down learn the Upper Room
[29:14] I thought the liquefier sitting on each
[29:18] one I thought that was the new birth I
[29:22] thought that was God dividing himself I
[29:27] thought that's what the prophet said I
[29:29] thought that's what we were to
[29:31] understand by reading the Bible itself
[29:34] that that liquefier was the part of the
[29:38] pillar fire divided out among the people
[29:43] innocent I believe that's always half so
[29:45] I'll go ahead and say it
[29:46] I believe anybody this ever received a
[29:49] new birth get that lick of fire if you
[29:55] get the new bar you get to lick of fire
[29:58] all right you might not be able to show
[30:02] it too much but you get to lick a fire
[30:04] why because it's a part of God's life
[30:07] right all right now so then by being
[30:11] born again doesn't mean that we do this
[30:14] and then there's something great
[30:16] anointing comes down that's great let
[30:19] God do what he wants to when he does it
[30:26] but just remember what I'm stating when
[30:32] that three thousand outside with it some
[30:36] great big thing that took place why
[30:38] didn't the rest of the world see it
[30:42] 3,000 receive the Holy Ghost why didn't
[30:44] the world see it because they didn't
[30:48] know what was going on sure a sound of a
[30:52] rushing mighty wind your ID would just
[30:56] remember the rushing mighty wind is not
[30:59] always the Holy Ghost itself because
[31:02] remember it can't anoint anointed one
[31:08] and that's not the new birth so the new
[31:14] birth is the birth of the word that's
[31:15] what we've drove I have ever since I've
[31:17] been in this message and heard what
[31:19] brother around him said to me that's the
[31:21] most simple thing that there is it's the
[31:24] birth of the word
[31:26] it's all of what Jesus preached in those
[31:29] parables and all those things through
[31:31] the Gospels and then the Holy Ghost came
[31:34] and made alive
[31:35] what those disciples hail within their
[31:38] heart there's a new birth what is it
[31:44] your birthday you said well brother Dale
[31:49] I believe one starts one leads out to
[31:51] this one goes that go and do what you
[31:53] want to I don't have time to fool with
[31:55] that I'm just gonna stay like it is okay
[32:00] now get what we're talking about then
[32:05] what makes the word alive is for the
[32:09] Holy Ghost to quicken that word that you
[32:13] heard is that true
[32:19] come on is that what the Prophet said
[32:21] that God laid down his word one word
[32:25] original seed and the Holy Ghost
[32:29] irrigated the word all right now are you
[32:35] listening see you heard the word right
[32:43] you go through repentance accepting
[32:46] Jesus Christ you go through
[32:47] sanctification cleanse and setting your
[32:50] side through justification of
[32:52] sanctification and the baptism of the
[32:55] Holy Ghost is the quickening of the word
[32:57] that's within you is that right why do
[33:04] you always want the sound of the rushing
[33:06] mighty wind when the Prophet in the cave
[33:09] wasn't listening to none of that but
[33:12] when that still small voice spoke he
[33:15] came out Nordic ones how that mighty
[33:21] rushing wind
[33:24] come on and now listen so what is the
[33:30] new birth it's the birth of the word
[33:32] that you have held it's what the
[33:34] disciples done they held that word and
[33:37] when the Spirit came down to quicken it
[33:41] so it was inside of them the quickening
[33:46] was inside of them the word was in them
[33:49] is that true
[33:51] so if the word was in them so then the
[33:54] Holy Spirit would be quickening the word
[33:55] it's inside so the whole work is inside
[33:58] of you there's the mystery that your
[34:04] prophet would say receive the baptism
[34:07] when the Holy Ghost without a sensation
[34:10] but he never talked
[34:12] I want you short to me a receiving the
[34:15] baptism when the Holy Ghost without an
[34:16] experience a lot of difference in the
[34:19] word experience and a sensation
[34:23] sensations can deal with anointed ones
[34:26] experience is something you lived
[34:28] through all right now then what did we
[34:34] what was we talking about Wednesday
[34:36] night then from one paragraph 161 of the
[34:42] spoken word original see he said to be
[34:45] born of the word of spirit you could
[34:47] pull that note you want to start that's
[34:49] number two because we'll use it I just
[34:51] want to make sure one thing I don't care
[34:53] for it doesn't bother me to repeat
[34:54] anything that don't bother me at all if
[35:00] you get tired of it if you get tired of
[35:02] hearing the same over same thing over
[35:04] and over you don't have it I've heard
[35:08] water baptism but I ran him explain it
[35:11] hadn't you heard him explaining water
[35:15] baptism over and over and over you know
[35:20] what I still love to hear him explain
[35:23] he's never got all germane didn't if you
[35:30] say well well I bet if this got old to
[35:34] you they something wrong with you
[35:36] if you don't know that listen all of
[35:39] God's sons must be the same yes sir to
[35:45] be born to the word and spirit brings us
[35:47] back to the spoken word again like in
[35:49] John 3 now what's John 3 to Jesus you
[35:53] must be born again right
[35:57] now what to be born to the water and the
[36:01] spirit what does it do
[36:03] then it brings you right back again unto
[36:06] the place of where you should have been
[36:09] at the beginning what was in the
[36:15] beginning the quickening of the word
[36:18] would bring you back to the like in the
[36:20] beginning what was in the beginning Adam
[36:22] with eternal life right body and spirit
[36:28] not eternal would eternal life in his
[36:32] soul so then the word spirit brings you
[36:34] right back to that you realize that new
[36:37] birth put you in the place of where Adam
[36:42] was now here's the only part split the
[36:46] condition again Adam had authority
[36:51] that's the part we need the birth yes we
[36:56] have the birth if you're born again you
[36:58] have the birth that don't mean you how
[37:00] the stature of a perfect man I don't
[37:02] agree with the people that say I got it
[37:04] all when I believe I got it one of those
[37:06] people that believe it I talked with her
[37:07] they said we get all these virtues when
[37:10] we're born again now I don't believe
[37:13] that I believe when your new birth is
[37:16] finality and finished maybe that's what
[37:18] they're talking about but that was
[37:20] certainly not the way they explained it
[37:24] because one brother said they got he got
[37:26] everything when he believed the other
[37:28] one said you ain't got nothing yet and
[37:31] that's what I told him I said you two
[37:32] brothers mind if I stay in between cuz I
[37:36] believe I've got something but ain't got
[37:38] what I need
[37:42] Oh they'd lead what look he brings you
[37:46] right back again to the place where you
[37:48] should have been at the beginning see
[37:50] that's the reason of Christ's death
[37:52] bringing us right back again to work
[37:55] brings right back to work
[37:57] sons of God was not Adam a son of God
[38:01] you see then what we're trying to get in
[38:08] trying to move on with what is the new
[38:12] birth in brother Branham then we that
[38:16] he's he's making it like we could make
[38:19] the question if we was there you know
[38:20] what is the new birth he's stating it
[38:22] like coming from you to him and that's
[38:24] good
[38:25] he said what is the new birth brother
[38:27] branham well what is the new birth it's
[38:30] revelation of Jesus Christ
[38:32] personally to you now that's what I
[38:37] remember I listen yesterday evening to
[38:41] Wednesday night's message I like to
[38:45] listen to see where it's lined it were
[38:47] to start back over in a listen what is
[38:52] the new birth is a revelation of Jesus
[38:53] Christ personally to you well brother
[38:57] Dale when I got the Holy Ghost I didn't
[38:58] get known you I didn't get no revelation
[39:01] hmm see you you you don't listen
[39:11] when you went to the altar
[39:13] why did you go now come on you know what
[39:18] brother Brennan says you know what he's
[39:21] talking about he said don't get them
[39:22] people and drag him to the altar now
[39:25] what did he say he said you get to
[39:26] people and drag them to the altar ah he
[39:28] said you'll make him twofold child of
[39:32] Rome he's had cause it's hard to get him
[39:34] to come the second time he said leave
[39:37] him alone let him come themselves but
[39:40] that's what they done with me my sister
[39:41] come to me my brother and all got killed
[39:44] in a car wreck I was 18 years old and
[39:46] she come to me and she said Sam you need
[39:48] to go the altar since Jesse didn't have
[39:50] a time to repent but you do
[39:53] I miss honestly I can't believe I don't
[40:00] know where the man was from what he was
[40:03] but he was a better man than she was a
[40:05] woman I don't mind saying it to me he
[40:11] was more christian-like than she was but
[40:15] yet she was trying to lead me to the
[40:16] altar see that was a hindrance the
[40:23] hindrance was the Deacons and things
[40:25] that was having problems but yet they
[40:27] wanted to lead you to Christ that was a
[40:30] hindrance okay you never worked well
[40:33] okay but what is it but I never received
[40:39] a revelation so you don't know what
[40:41] you're talking about did not something
[40:47] call you did not something deal with you
[40:54] to come to the altar well then there's
[40:58] your God revealing to you that you need
[41:01] to be saved and then if you did get
[41:06] saved he would be quickening the words
[41:09] you had see this one said you try to
[41:19] preach to people and they're so
[41:21] revelation until I have no common sense
[41:23] or either so no common sense and and got
[41:27] all this willing that claim revelation
[41:30] and no common sense
[41:33] that's how simple it is but yes you can
[41:37] miss it by not being tall you see what
[41:40] brother Branham was saying the Holy
[41:42] Ghost is so this talk see we're taught
[41:46] you got to do this you got to do that
[41:48] speaking tongue shout cry do this do
[41:50] that it's not to have
[41:55] it's accepting Jesus Christ as your
[41:58] Savior and them here then him accepting
[42:01] you there's the key you could go all
[42:06] your life except in him unquote brother
[42:08] branham I'm looking at this morning you
[42:11] can go all your life accepting Christ
[42:13] wind up in the end of it and find out
[42:15] you didn't have him because there was
[42:18] something wrong
[42:19] listen I'm quoting him he said they
[42:21] something wrong with your believing
[42:26] something being wrong with your
[42:28] believing you're sitting there thinking
[42:29] you're right many times about told you
[42:39] I'll tell you one more time I'd rather
[42:42] be all of my life crying out before God
[42:48] asking him to save me and guide me and
[42:51] keep me and get on at the end of the
[42:54] road and find out I've had it all along
[42:56] instead of not crying out for him
[43:00] because I I got it when I believe that's
[43:03] God you can't tell me you tell me I'd
[43:06] say cuz I got what you gonna do to get
[43:09] down the road in the road and then you
[43:11] got it you never find a person I have it
[43:17] I've tried to study the Bible from this
[43:20] rim and brother branham you know
[43:21] watching him him from whatever of the
[43:24] tapes and the things we could follow
[43:27] I've never seen a real Christian it
[43:31] wasn't crying out for God
[43:35] it's in the stature of a perfect man but
[43:37] a Renault said the oldest one here a
[43:40] brother and sister kid he said but what
[43:42] would be the thoughts that they want he
[43:44] said how to serve God
[43:49] the only this blessed God I got this
[43:51] nothing you know that doning encouraged
[43:53] me none so whatsoever what is the new
[44:03] birth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[44:06] personally to you not you join the
[44:10] church you shook a hand you've done
[44:12] something different
[44:13] you said a Creed all of those things
[44:17] goes with it no Gentiles what Gentiles
[44:25] are not supposed to have the basis of
[44:27] laying on hands right because they're
[44:30] supposed to believe the word but did
[44:31] brother Branham take it out or did he
[44:33] say we still lay hands on the sick he
[44:36] said we still do it you know why cause
[44:40] it's part of the word did he ever do
[44:49] away with shouting crying speaking in
[44:51] tongue come on did he ever do away with
[44:56] him thought no he said get born again
[45:00] and then let God do what he wants to he
[45:03] said just remember one time he said
[45:06] remember when you come back down that
[45:09] you can walk a straight line you can get
[45:15] up all into the heavenlies when you come
[45:17] back down what did we cover now
[45:21] Wednesday night what do we cover it over
[45:23] and over the new birth is Christ
[45:27] revealed personally to you in other
[45:32] words the words you've heard has been
[45:34] made alive in your soul there's your new
[45:37] birth okay then what did we cover from
[45:41] Patmos vision we've covered it over and
[45:44] over and over
[45:45] you can only be saved by revelation you
[45:55] can only be saved by revelation you know
[45:59] what I didn't write the book have I
[46:03] become your enemy because I found it in
[46:05] the message let's go down thought I
[46:10] still think that I shout a crying I
[46:11] think that ain't nobody said a word
[46:13] about your shouting and crying as long
[46:16] as an aftereffect
[46:18] the baby comes it will cry after it gets
[46:24] here right come on then now what do we
[46:30] get down talking to you cannot be saved
[46:34] without a revelation you can't be saved
[46:40] without a revelation let's see you're
[46:48] looking at it I keep feeling that point
[46:52] they don't understand the revelation why
[46:55] don't you understand the revelation I
[46:57] tried to make it so simple God speaks to
[47:00] your heart and calls you and tells you
[47:06] you need to come and be saved right and
[47:12] you accept that call and you answer that
[47:15] call and you accept him as your Savior
[47:18] and it gives you the new birth it's that
[47:23] simple
[47:24] I put a whole message or two in the
[47:28] basis of what we've never we we haven't
[47:33] been taught down through time come we
[47:35] didn't come through some of you come to
[47:36] the Pentecostal churches and I and you
[47:39] knew that you had to be justified
[47:40] sanctified filled with all to go less
[47:42] bad just got it all one or bleed what
[47:44] the rest of Ian's do you know ain't no
[47:46] joking about it I'm just telling the
[47:48] truth we were never taught you needed to
[47:51] read to do other than repent and accept
[47:54] Jesus Christ
[47:55] we were never called that's why this
[47:58] message is so strong
[47:59] change we were never called that you
[48:01] need to be justified sanctified before
[48:07] you can be filled with the Holy Ghost
[48:08] that's got it when a blue will see your
[48:11] Baptist because there's not enough there
[48:18] for you to believe all right come on
[48:22] but if revelation faith faith is a
[48:27] revelation to you and if you have
[48:33] received the new birth you've got a
[48:37] revelation in that faith you accepted
[48:46] Jesus Christ he accepted you come on it
[48:54] may take a while for it to go on and you
[49:00] don't want to use the word growth
[49:02] because that'll be for later but it is
[49:03] that too but for you to repent of your
[49:05] sins and then you seek God and keep on
[49:08] seeking God and you come to her power
[49:12] with speaking of a daily sanctification
[49:14] even after you're born again let alone
[49:18] come into it we should never stop
[49:21] seeking God
[49:25] what are these seeking for guiding with
[49:30] that attitude you don't have it that
[49:35] plain enough with that attitude and that
[49:38] response you don't have it because you
[49:43] say like the color lady ain't what it
[49:46] used to be
[49:47] ain't Wonder Woman I ain't what I want
[49:49] to be ought to be but ain't what he used
[49:51] to be around said she come from
[49:53] somewhere huh she'd had an experience
[49:58] yes okay because remember what we got to
[50:04] Wednesday night talking about a
[50:05] revelation you cannot have a revelation
[50:11] without it being faith ice off the
[50:14] rapture faith is something that you've
[50:17] been that's been revealed to you which
[50:23] you can't tell nobody else you can try
[50:26] it explain your salvation to somebody
[50:32] but they didn't experience what you
[50:36] experienced maybe in another way they
[50:38] didn't won't ever understand they didn't
[50:40] experience right that so they're it's
[50:42] not to the image to you all right what
[50:49] did we get to that what we were talking
[50:51] about Wednesday that I want to go over
[50:54] and over that wrote about him on the
[50:57] message how faith in God he says to have
[51:01] an experience it must be a substance
[51:09] gives your salvation a substance or it
[51:13] is a mythology or a thought you know
[51:16] just something you believe or is it real
[51:20] is God real to you now let me ask you
[51:26] this way it's God more real to you after
[51:29] you've heard the message of the Prophet
[51:32] explaining God and how really is but yet
[51:36] how simple it is or do we still have the
[51:40] same thing that we believed in God I
[51:45] believed in God when I was in the
[51:47] Baptist Church and so God move and
[51:50] things happen didn't you before you ever
[51:52] heard of the message we see a distance
[52:01] that winds did not but rather says to
[52:03] have an experience it must be a
[52:06] substance because of substance Hebrews
[52:10] 11:1 is what the substance faith is the
[52:13] substance of things hoped for the
[52:17] evidence of things not seen
[52:20] see it's the substance because it's an
[52:23] evidence and that's what I asked
[52:25] question right is your substance and
[52:31] evidence is that your evidence see then
[52:40] why was all the evidences tongue
[52:42] speaking crying shout and all and what
[52:50] did the Prophet say your evidence of the
[52:52] holy ghost whether or not the spirit in
[52:56] you agrees with the word if it don't
[53:02] agree with it then we're yeah that's
[53:05] that should solve a problem you know
[53:10] what I've always said to you know I
[53:12] always believed it you know how I check
[53:14] a doctrine well I go through the mission
[53:18] well that's good and that's fine
[53:20] I'll go through the bottle but how do
[53:22] you know how do you check a doctrine no
[53:27] we're not two Pentecostals you know look
[53:29] II and I you know I've heard y'all tell
[53:32] about it you know they they try to
[53:33] discern your spirit you know look you in
[53:36] the eye you know to see if I know you
[53:41] know the way I check a doctrine to see
[53:42] if it's right by my own experience but
[53:52] what if your experience is wrong well
[53:53] it's done pretty good so far I've got a
[53:56] decent batting average out of it I mean
[53:58] that's that still don't mean it's right
[54:01] but it's I still take what I believe
[54:04] instead of the others trooper natural
[54:06] SuperDuper great revelations in nine
[54:16] you see if something with inside of me
[54:18] says and then wait a minute that just
[54:23] say in the words you know that to
[54:25] Lourdes
[54:27] what if there's two lords that means
[54:29] these two gods or something this someone
[54:31] says that's not right they just don't
[54:38] you says that ain't right because it
[54:42] won't compare with my experience why
[54:46] can't you do that what are you ii by
[54:52] what do you check a false doctrine bah
[54:56] when I get into the message that's
[54:58] wonderful
[54:59] great cuz you know that's what I do but
[55:06] the first is to look at it and see what
[55:08] it's saying is that bringing forth two
[55:12] gods is the people that are preaching
[55:17] that Jesus wasn't God till the River
[55:19] Jordan is that two God's within you want
[55:24] to say well that ain't right but
[55:28] brethren said that but he also said that
[55:33] he was born God now then where you go
[55:43] you said but you don't understand
[55:45] brother so-and-so I never heard him say
[55:46] you don't listen like you're not
[55:48] listening now you're sitting there
[55:50] trying to figure it out and refute it
[55:54] instead of listening
[55:57] what say it
[56:02] I've read the quotes right here from
[56:04] brother branham then we read around and
[56:06] says Jesus wouldn't God to a river
[56:09] Jordan that's a quote
[56:12] now what's he saying is he saying what
[56:17] you're reading is he's saying what
[56:23] you're reading then we better find us
[56:27] another prophet cuz if he can't keep the
[56:29] Godhead straight so he's not saying what
[56:34] you think he said yeah he wasn't the
[56:37] fullness of God until the River Jordan
[56:40] Helen I can quote - I've quoted these to
[56:43] the in random tree he never became The
[56:46] Anointed Messiah until the River Jordan
[56:49] spread around the word but he was born
[56:53] the Messiah he was born the Anointed One
[56:57] but when it comes to the River Jordan he
[57:00] entered this ministry come on why don't
[57:04] you do it like that thing is your faith
[57:10] and your experience one in the Sun is
[57:19] your faith in your experience one of the
[57:22] Sun you know are of this side which is a
[57:26] revelation of Jesus cry personally to
[57:28] you see if it is then your evidence is a
[57:38] substance then I'll get off of that but
[57:42] just remember one more time speaking in
[57:44] tongues out and crying and all those
[57:45] things we believe in it we believe in
[57:48] that doing that whatever one of them
[57:50] Satan can impersonate he can impersonate
[57:54] everything you put in that room but he
[57:58] cannot impersonate the revealed word
[58:01] because remember what the Prophet said
[58:02] he can't bring it word by word
[58:06] look like that's one thing he could do
[58:08] don't you can't do it word by word knows
[58:12] you'll walk off somewhere all right then
[58:15] what are we getting to then if it's true
[58:28] say that for your point if it's true
[58:33] that you cannot be born again without a
[58:36] faith how's that faith is your
[58:39] born-again experience you can't be saved
[58:44] without faith
[58:46] what's your prophet said all right now
[58:51] we'll pick up I'm starting the message
[58:57] today go to number eight
[58:59] you see we jump a long way this is off
[59:04] the message earnestly contend for the
[59:06] faith that was once delivered to the son
[59:09] why brother it's my faith you're saved
[59:14] it's my faith you're saved
[59:16] is that right listen in accepting of
[59:20] your faith and accepting of your faith
[59:25] God confirms your faith by the baptism
[59:30] of the Holy Ghost if you say you believe
[59:35] and don't get the baptism of the Holy
[59:39] Ghost then you do not what's he saying
[59:44] something wrong your faith isn't
[59:48] accepted it's not accepted right if you
[59:52] don't get the Holy Ghost you say up do
[59:57] you believe and you don't get the
[59:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost in you do not
[1:00:01] know it's dropping it
[1:00:03] your faith isn't accepted in the side of
[1:00:06] God you've got a mental faith in the
[1:00:14] stead of a heart faith that's right
[1:00:18] when you truly believe God gods under
[1:00:21] obligation to pour the Holy Ghost on you
[1:00:24] and then if he does pour the Holy Ghost
[1:00:27] on you you say well I got the Holy Ghost
[1:00:31] well if you do you're bound to believe
[1:00:37] in the supernatural signs and wonders
[1:00:43] because you're added to it that's the
[1:00:48] faith you and your faith becomes one so
[1:00:56] if you say you I believe but I didn't
[1:00:59] get the Holy Ghost well you believe in
[1:01:01] it's not right I didn't say that now you
[1:01:07] could talk to the Prophet okay now
[1:01:11] listen cuz what's our problem
[1:01:17] are you listening now but listen in
[1:01:23] accepting of your faith God confirms
[1:01:27] your faith by the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:30] Ghost if you say you believe and don't
[1:01:36] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost then
[1:01:39] you do not your faith isn't accepted in
[1:01:42] the side of God you've got a mental
[1:01:44] faith instead of a heart faith because
[1:01:50] God's under obligation to keep his word
[1:01:53] now what's wrong with us then go ahead
[1:01:55] to number nine this is taken from
[1:02:00] blasphemous names okay so now listen
[1:02:11] 145 you know come on there you go
[1:02:17] so what does he say paragraph 143 the
[1:02:20] biggest part of our faith is mental
[1:02:23] faith by hearing the word it brings us
[1:02:32] to a mental recognition of God now I
[1:02:39] watch this is one I love but if this
[1:02:44] coming from above
[1:02:46] oh brother if it ever strikes this there
[1:02:53] it is a godly spiritual faith the church
[1:03:03] I've taught this 4050 years they don't
[1:03:08] close because brother mol preached
[1:03:10] statue of perfect plan 19 in 71 and so
[1:03:14] that would come right into there I'm
[1:03:18] just making a point a statement and
[1:03:23] believing that one time when you accept
[1:03:31] Jesus Christ as your Savior he accepts
[1:03:37] your faith he brings you into the body
[1:03:42] across
[1:03:48] now look listen are you listening for a
[1:03:55] second what did he just say this will
[1:04:04] come on over in the statute of perfect
[1:04:05] man once we start through with the
[1:04:07] virtues in time but I'm trying to get
[1:04:09] you to stay right at the point to listen
[1:04:12] What did he say by hearing the word it
[1:04:17] brings us to a mental recognition of God
[1:04:22] so are out there on the internet I'm
[1:04:24] southern so mental it mental to me you
[1:04:28] know but if this our mental faith
[1:04:36] something's got to happen to our mental
[1:04:38] faith in other words God accepts us and
[1:04:45] then he imparts unto us he turned a life
[1:04:50] which is the faith to make the word
[1:04:54] alive that you've heard now listen but
[1:05:00] if this coming from above oh brother
[1:05:11] if it ever strikes this so you got
[1:05:15] something up here you got something
[1:05:17] evidently down here okay if it ever
[1:05:23] strike see if there's you godly faith
[1:05:25] accordingly spiritual faith
[1:05:26] what does that do that faith recognizes
[1:05:31] only the word no matter what anybody
[1:05:32] else says it only recognizes the word
[1:05:34] because in the beginning was the word
[1:05:35] word with garden word was God and the
[1:05:38] word is still God and the Word was made
[1:05:40] flesh and dwelt among us and when the
[1:05:42] word itself is pouring into our faith
[1:05:46] our mental faith becomes a spiritual
[1:05:51] revelation now keep that thought in mind
[1:05:55] because it's going to be ever virtue is
[1:05:58] going to be sealed into the other one
[1:06:02] but I want you to look at the pyramid
[1:06:04] and think about what your prophet just
[1:06:07] say something coming from above that's
[1:06:18] why I've always talked to you I've
[1:06:23] taught it from the beginning I still
[1:06:25] teach it did your soul is your theophany
[1:06:36] no might be out knees up in heaven hey I
[1:06:42] love it there's your positive yours the
[1:06:51] beginning the day you receive the new
[1:06:55] birth butter brown said you heard he
[1:07:00] didn't use the word new birth but he
[1:07:02] says you heard from your theophan the
[1:07:09] day you receive the new birth right here
[1:07:13] that God accepted your faith you started
[1:07:16] a pool upward and it's gonna pull us
[1:07:22] into the headstone don't break that
[1:07:27] connection
[1:07:28] that's why I've always said I know I'm
[1:07:31] carnal but that's alright just don't
[1:07:36] bring that headstone down you can't do
[1:07:40] it it would sit here and you be off
[1:07:45] leave it where it's at and just let that
[1:07:49] Holy Ghost fill in the sides
[1:07:52] [Music]
[1:07:54] let him fill in the sides you don't have
[1:07:57] to bring it down you bring it down it
[1:07:59] won't fit it'd be sitting like this
[1:08:03] leave it works out let it draw you let
[1:08:12] it pull you so you know what you heard
[1:08:16] from the positive of God's mind that he
[1:08:21] had of you before the world that had
[1:08:23] begun it drugs you through justification
[1:08:32] through sanctification and when the
[1:08:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost strikes it
[1:08:37] gives you faith the faith of God it's
[1:08:44] pulling you all the time right in the
[1:08:51] beginning watch them not upon the mental
[1:08:57] conceptions Church join him okay back up
[1:09:01] and upon this foundation I'll build my
[1:09:03] church those found at his church to
[1:09:05] build on faith right see not a
[1:09:08] fundamental conception of Church joining
[1:09:10] mental conception of that wood upon the
[1:09:13] revelation when them streams of grace
[1:09:15] has poured into that mental faith that
[1:09:19] you got did upon this a spiritual
[1:09:22] revelation I'll build my church and the
[1:09:24] gates of Hell can't prevail against it
[1:09:26] see that shows you would be that shows
[1:09:29] they would be against it would it'll
[1:09:31] never prevail oh what a glorious thing
[1:09:33] now see the faith just by strength you
[1:09:37] remember the sister Shepherd we'll get
[1:09:39] back to that in a statue of perfect man
[1:09:42] because this headstone was missing and
[1:09:45] the Holy Spirit the angel was pouring
[1:09:48] the message in and it was running down
[1:09:53] what about it you know we could be a
[1:09:57] little closer than we think
[1:10:06] then that was number one where did we
[1:10:09] get to 145 okay go ahead one more go
[1:10:14] ahead number ten it's in the same
[1:10:16] message and that was number one number
[1:10:19] one coming to you your mental faith
[1:10:22] right here what's that number one coming
[1:10:27] to you your mental faith right here
[1:10:30] comes the Holy Spirit coming down into
[1:10:33] your mental fate making it a spiritual
[1:10:35] faith then the spiritual faith only
[1:10:37] recognizes the word the day you receive
[1:10:45] the new birth there's a pool leading you
[1:10:49] upward right that's the positive of
[1:10:55] God's mind it's drawing us to that place
[1:10:59] listen number two number three then you
[1:11:01] have spiritual you'll have the holy
[1:11:03] spirit and we'll seal all these things
[1:11:06] into you as that Holy Spirit covers it
[1:11:09] from your faith up to the Holy Spirit
[1:11:12] seals you in with Christ and you become
[1:11:15] one we get back on those don't worry
[1:11:18] about it but did you catch what I'm
[1:11:21] saying just a little point when the day
[1:11:31] you got born again someone started
[1:11:35] drawing you now brother branham is the
[1:11:40] one that called it he says a sinner has
[1:11:45] a soul
[1:11:46] everybody has a soul right cuz that's
[1:11:50] the difference that's an animal and even
[1:11:54] if you're lost your soul will carry you
[1:11:58] somewhere when you die because it is
[1:12:01] your theophany
[1:12:03] no you got Itoh no I got the prophets
[1:12:06] message ain't gonna argue you the
[1:12:09] Prophet said
[1:12:11] the sinner has a theophany hey man but
[1:12:14] that's not an eternal body right now
[1:12:16] that's a soul he's on his way to hell
[1:12:18] and that's the way you when I was until
[1:12:22] we got the new Berto and when you get
[1:12:24] the new birth you start your upward pull
[1:12:26] now your soul is your theophany and
[1:12:28] there's the positive of your theophany
[1:12:31] right here this is the partial
[1:12:33] realization or earnest are being born
[1:12:37] again let me get something in a hurry so
[1:12:49] then go to number 11 we'll let's pick up

[1:23:06] all right
[1:23:11] the message of the statue of a perfect
[1:23:14] man is not addressed to the world it's
[1:23:21] not even addressed to try to tell you
[1:23:25] how to become a Christian I'm talking
[1:23:28] about getting born again it's addressed
[1:23:30] to those that are already born again
[1:23:33] then Peter is telling us to how to come
[1:23:35] to work he's at the like precious faith
[1:23:41] that we start with the new birth we all
[1:23:44] start with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:23:46] faith brother Brown says you can't be
[1:23:50] born again without having faith so if
[1:23:56] you read the message of the statue of a
[1:23:58] perfect man I'd ask you go back and read

[1:24:22] brethren says you're born again at faith
[1:24:24] and he says you can't be born again
[1:24:27] without having faith so then remember
[1:24:34] the point he's addressing this to those
[1:24:39] not of the world he said addressing it
[1:24:43] to those that are in Christ Jesus
[1:24:47] those with like precious faith then he
[1:24:52] says and that's why I love it - it is
[1:24:54] then he says add
[1:24:56] to your faith people don't even read
[1:25:03] that add to your faith but it don't say
[1:25:06] add to your virtue it's this add virtual
[1:25:10] add knowledge - Templar the only one
