John 14 now the announcements has already been made of the Easter weekend and the things you know in the Bible study and all like that and it may be cool around Easter so make sure you bring the children a a coat you know and maybe a cap or something but it'll be cool just remember that now remember the Lord willing way will'll be taking to services this weekend maybe the next weekend as every what works out so then that'll be great amen remember these times John 3 and John 14 father we thank you for the day and the hour that we have we thank you for Jesus Christ who come and died for each and every one of us that we might have life and to have life eternal because Lord that's the most important thing that could ever be thought of in a human's life is eternal life people make great preparations and lay aside a lot of the things for their old age and their doings of life and not very much as laid aside for life after this one but we just try to place all of our emphasis Lord upon that that we may know you as life eternal forgive our sins lead us by thine understanding keep us in thy Grace that we may walk in the light of Your Love let the sick among us touch each one Lord and guide us all in Jesus name amen amen John 3 14 and 15 and then we'll go to John 14 and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so even even so must the son of man be lifted up now why does the son of man have to be lifted up yep why is it the son of man has to be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him yeah shall not perish but have eternal life right let's go over to John 14 and we'll read verse 12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father amen you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I told you these this past Wednesday and this service tonight will be kind of a background for later on so I wish you would study and read and at least get familiar with the scripture there and things that you can on the in Revelations 5 because we will be starting uh a point on that our series maybe on it I don't know how it'll work out we just leave it at that I've got some questions questions and answers a couple that I need to cover so what we'll probably cover next is marriage and divorce because it's a question there about it so we will try to Maybe cover that the Lord willing next wednes day if we can but you know I want to get that out of the way but just keep in mind what I'm saying here about these and what we've been talking about now last Wednesday night we spoke about talking about a personal revelation right a personal experience with almighty God have you had Earth this past Sunday excuse me have you had a personal experience right if you hadn't had a personal experience then there is no hoax to talk about anything else right amen because everything is in vain right you know without a personal experience and remember what I was talking about the the most important personal experience it may have been odd to you but we'll get back to it later and you'll maybe understand that see that new birth is the most important thing in your life amen right all right yes because there's nothing else that's worth anything else you say well I had to have my natural birth before I could have a spiritual be well a lot of the world has done that they they've had a natural life they've had a beginning but they don't have a baptism of the Holy Ghost so a personal experience of the new birth to where that nobody can't argue with you about it amen nobody can't take it away right you say well my personal experience was when I first heard the message if you didn't have the new birth or don't have the new birth either way you want to stay it to hear the message is just words that's right see to hear the message doesn't give you eternal life it takes the Holy Spirit to Quicken the word that's what we want to get to tonight to make The Word Alive amen so no matter how much we'd hear it brother BR said without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can hear the word every day of your life you still he'll die and go to hell right amen why because it's not a personal experience to you amen right so now keep that in mind now as we're trying to get going to get to a point of eternal life eternal life we'll get to it in a minute because the title of the message is to know him all right because we must have eternal life all everything in the Christian real is based upon whether or not you're born again amen as I said now you you can argue anything and I ain't going to argue with you about it I'm just telling you what I believe and it's the way I preach it this message is no good without the Holy Ghost to quck it amen cuz it's just words right that's what it's done it's made churches oh my it's made one of the greatest organizational systems of churches that has ever been thought of that's right because if you don't if you don't agree with the people of this message you're you're just out you know y right you don't have any hopes you know the Baptist would at least give the Methodist a little hope maybe the Catholic might give the rest of them a little hope but you differ with the people of this message and they don't give you no hope come on you got to come to them you know so it's made the worst organizational system I call it that way because of of the what it's doing but see eternal life the prophet said the greatest thing in your life is whether or not you're born again now who worries about who the president's going to be and all this that and the other right who worries about the economy and all what it's doing sure we're involved in all of those things but none of that will give you eternal life right and you'll find out when we get through and get back to the part I want to bring is because I started with one thought and then it developed into another and that's why I'm tying it together then into one message instead of preaching two different messages upon the thoughts that came to me now Jesus said John 14 uh John 10 excuse me 27 and 28 Jesus said that he would give eternal life yeah unto his sheep that would follow him right he would give eternal life all right now in doing that he had to have eternal life amen before he could give eternal life he had to have eternal life right very simple statement very simple thought all right you can't give away something you don't have amen that's right right right right then he had to have eternal life all right didn't that ought to do away with lot these doctrines and things that Jesus wasn't Eternal until the River Jordan you know and all this didn't have eternal life and all this that and the other you know cuz there would be no way for him to be able to give eternal life that's right to anyone if he didn't have that eternal life to give amen right all right now so then what was he able to do now listen to the point Jesus was given power according to St John 1777 let's read that verse 1 to3 these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour has come that the son of man that the son Also may be glorified excuse me gor the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee amen all right as thou Hast given him Power Over All Flesh y now what's the connection what is Power Over All Flesh right what would it be any good if you had power over every B of the flesh right what if you had power over everybody in the world what good would it be do we not talking about that form right is thou Hast given him Power Over All Flesh what that he should give eternal life to as many as thou Hast given him right and this is eternal life that they may Know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent now as I said what would it what would it profit us if we could own the world have ever it would be gone nothing here or those things are Eternal but now Jesus Christ had to have eternal life but then by having eternal life he would be able to impart that eternal life or give right amen right but the key is now that he's got to have it right all right before he could impart it he's got to have it amen all right so now in this day there's a lot of quotes that brother around Gils and I'll just paraphrase a couple of them that people say oh the church has power to impart eternal life that's all right if we have it right amen that's the truth yeah but the question is do we have it that's it amen now if imparting eternal life is what people thinks then what good is having eternal life right the impart it or give it you see amen now do you believe that a Son of God can do are in part eternal life right I believe we can amen yeah yes sir but there's a way we got to go by amen see it's not just because that we can say that the church has the power to forgive sins right see that can be taken and has been until it's been from every form in the world a thought of that point but what's it talking about how can can we impart eternal life you know the only way that the Lord Jesus Christ could impart eternal life was to die yep amen that's right he never gave eternal life to anybody while he was alive right now let's don't go to the thief on the cross cuz all right don't go there see and let your mind Wonder because a thief on the cross he said this day you'll be with me in Paradise he didn't give it to him while he's here right right amen whatever he got he got when he went to Paradise he didn't have you here right all right so now get the key of what I'm talking about the only way that Jesus could impart eternal life was to have eternal life amen amen right but then the only way that he could impart that eternal life or release that eternal life that it could come back upon someone else was the fact that he had to die amen all right now eternal life see I had all these quotes lined up to go one way and another way and so they're on my mind so bear with me but eternal life is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's right right right it's not eternal life to just be a believer no amen it's not even eternal life to be justified or Sanctified right amen that's not eternal life you're just believing un TR amen amen you can be given eternal life in a later day white thr on judgment like the foolish virgins Etc but I'm talking about a personal experience of eternal life while you're here right now to lay that down I want you to think about it you know that Jesus Christ now on the internet remember we got the quotes to come along so we stir you up by your thinking okay you know that Jesus Christ could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost now you real quiet right because you're saying well if you go one way on that you got a problem if you go the other way we don't know Jesus Christ could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost why not that he didn't have it no right he had eternal life right right he had the baptism of the Holy Ghost correct amen he was the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but why was it that he could not impart eternal life while he was alive why would he have to die now let's go to John 7 and we'll Pi up our Point John 7 and let's just read why John 7:37 and in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst Let It Come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water oh man now watch y but this spake he of the Holy Spirit Come On which they that believe on him should receive yep for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified that's right right you know that's why we say and try to emphasize because you'd be surprised how many people don't believe it that way but that's right there was nobody in the Old Testament had eternal life right they were Believing on to amen because the eternal life was dwelling in Jesus Christ amen and even while he was here on the earth he could not give that eternal life to anyone now come and show me right I mean that's all I say come and show me he couldn't do it you say well brother D you're limiting God no God limited himself so you are with him that's right amen you know there's no argument between me and you about it God's the one that limited himself he could give the baptism of the Holy Ghost to every person in the world you believe it amen but yet he didn't choose for it to be that way right so then he had to make a way right for that eternal life to come out of him Y and then that eternal life could come back in you and I amen right right all right that was where he would be paying the price all right so now the Holy Ghost is not yet given now I know this needs explaining see Jesus Christ could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost right now I didn't say he didn't talk about it right that's right I didn't say say not in the scriptures where he mentions it talks about it that's right but as an example Martin Luther could only preach what God revealed for him right that's right which was the just shall live by faith all right now I'm not saying that Martin Luther didn't talk about sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost because it's in his wage but his basic thought was that justification was the baptism of the Holy Ghost John Wesley when he came along preaching sanctification he calls the baptism of the Holy Ghost sanctification right now that was all right for the time but Martin Luther couldn't preach sanctification in the true order that's right right right he couldn't preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the true order to follow the scriptures right why because he had no experience of that amen that's right now Jesus Christ then could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost because that Holy Ghost was inside of him amen that's right and the baptism of the Holy Ghost would be relating to you and I right right he he didn't need it right he was he was eternal amen hallelujah but he was making a way that you and I could receive right right okay now you say well I I just don't know about that statement you just made well let's let the prophet make it go ahead brother Anderson pull it up let's just see what brother random had to say then at least you can't argue with him over what he's saying I was talking brother Joe brought a man over the other night I really enjoyed it had a good time sitting there talking with the brother but what kind of confusion he had but anyhow uh you know I enjoyed talking to him and I wouldn't arguing with him or or anything like that but I saw immediately that he was not familiar with the message right so evidently I don't know how long he's been in the message his reading ability is limited and so is most of the people of the message because they only read in the category or real or whatever you want to call it of who their Pastor is or or who they're talking about you know and amen and you just start nailing down that word and then after a while you'll see them beginning to right back off a little and then they'll finally come to their statement and they'll say I I don't know whether brother Brown said that or not you know and you know what we were talking about on one thing was that brother BR said you know that that the baby is is not a living Soul until it's dropped from the mother it's just wiggling muscles and jerking and things you'd be surprised how many people don't know that cuz he said yes said when that life in that blood said that was a soul in that blood I said no sir Adam was standing up a man and God breathed into his nostrils and he become a living soul brother Joe was putting in the points to it but my point is I told the man I said I'm glad your types and your things is fine for us to talk about anybody else what we talk about is fine you know I mean I don't argue with nobody if they say well brother this is the way I think something I'm not going to argue with you about it but I'm going to finalize it by saying did the prophet ever type it like that like brother Al was that time that brother come down there you know and he he typed the roading on and the house numbers and this that and the other typed everything in the world and then said why didn't he type his tag number cuz the tag number on his car was 666 but see he certainly didn't want to type that you know but right I told the brother I said I I don't want to argue nothing I said nothing I said but we got a prophit and what he says you know we can't AR argue with all right so when he makes a statement we believe the statement unless the prophet says the statement was wrong and here's what's right okay all right so now look at it so you might question me is to say that Jesus couldn't preach the baptism and the ghost well let's see if the prophet said this is 1960 1204 revelation of Jesus Christ he that believeth in me said St John 14:7 he that believeth in me the works that I do she do also do the same work and greater than this now we're going to tie these two together in a minute so don't get lost on greater and try to comp this stay with me until we get there all right because Jesus Christ could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost would be greater y right see now if he's right there the preaching of the baptism of the Holy Ghost would be greater now you're going to draw up on me on this one but the preaching of the baptism of the Holy Ghost would be of the same level as the baptism of the Holy Ghost if he's really preaching correctly yes now I know the quotes goes behind the greater when people say we preach the gospel to the world that's the Greater Works brother around said let's see you do the lesser works and then we'll talk about the Greater Works right all right he said I'll give you the pull pit if you want to come up here and do the Greater Works he said even come up here and do the lesser works you know all right but now watch I said don't get tied up till we get tired what was the problem because Jesus could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost would be greater he could not bring it to them because the Holy Ghost had not been given amen see he couldn't bring it as a possession to anyone cuz it had not been given amen it was there inside of him right but when Jesus came and S sacrificed his life and the Holy Ghost returned then they could impart eternal life to the people that's the greater amen now what is the greater now we'll get that out of the way the original ver says more y he said because nobody could do anything greater than what the Lord Jesus Christ done that's right so when it says the Greater Works you shall do it means more works but now he is actually emphasizing of Greater Works tying it to the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the people to preach this the scriptures right now you probably draw up on this but no one can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without first hearing the word amen Jo it to it amen anywhere anybody Brother D I sitting out in the woods well You' been to church I Ain never heard no man you went heard somebody you read the Bible that's somebody amen all right now what's the next one Jehovah Gyra 61312 now if you look that up the old title of that is Abraham U restored or something Abraham something that changed the title of that message okay cuz I was getting a rebound off of that today and I thought well where's that at and I looked it up they changed the title to Jehovah JRA all right so look what he says Jesus could not well let's go back up let's back up above there where's the gods of baam where is your critics say the holy spirit is not right come forth do the same thing you say well Jesus said a greater than this amen you come do the works he done first then we'll talk about the greater and I'll tell you what it is that's going to tell you what the Greater Works is Jesus could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost it hadn't come yet that's the Greater Works we're doing but do the same Works he did he said you would amen all right now so he says now we're preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's the Greater Works I all I you go run Greater Works in the computer you'll find that all kind of quotes like people say we preach the gospel that's the Greater Works that's not what he's talking about there right right because if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can preach the baptism of the Holy right amen if not you're saying what somebody else say right amen but if you have it you can preach it amen and now come on the same Works he did y you'll do now there see you'll frown up I don't see well that's where your blinded eyes amen that's right open up we've seen a lot of things around here yes sir amen that God has done Among Us healings and signs and wonders the word spoken all kind of things oh yes I want to see a whole lot more yes sir that's right but let's don't deny what he's done amen amen we deny what he's done then he'll he don't have to do anything else for us all right but now what getting in the spirit 1961 428 and you say preaching the gospel is Greater Works what I said you go through there and read them you'll find a lot of these all right then you come here and do the lesser works and watch you here's the platform help yourself come up here and go down through this prayer line and let the Holy Spirit move out and to the audience there over you let me see you do them works and then go preach the gospel then you do do of Greater Works what if you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost first yep right Jesus could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost because it did not yet come y That's a Greater Works it certainly is the church is to preach the baptism of the Holy Spirit Jesus said it was coming but the church had it and saying we got it and it's for you see so that was a greater that is true right y see now Jesus had within him don't misunderstand me he was the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it was a fact that he was leaving something for the church to do and there it was not in manifestation right while he was alive and here was inside of him man see then there's no way you could say we could do the Greater Works right unless that same Holy Spirit can come into us right and then by that Holy Spirit coming into us then we can preach the gospel amen that's right the good news mhm because we're talking about what's inside of us now what mama said Daddy said or somebody else said brother Brown said or even Jesus said it's what's personal to youen by the new birth look at the next one now I wish you'd listen to this whole message 19692 that day on Calvary we start at paragraph [Music] 129 I wish you'd listen to this whole message listen now notice the Greater Works was to have the power in the church look not only to heal the Sick by prayer cast out SE Devils by prayer see not only that right that's wonderful that's part of it okay amen but to impart eternal life to Believers the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what Calvary meant now you read the rest of them in between there but jump on down to the next next paragraph let's see I wanted let's just start on 130 pull it back to 130 let's just read it how how much greater is it to say to this sick woman laying here now listen to this man explaining the Greater Works he's just said casting out Devils Healing The Sick is fine but the Greater Works is to preach the gospel right right right all right now watch the reason he said how much greater is it to say to this sick woman laying here I can pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what he was doing then now Jesus would do but said greater than this shall you do I'm going to give you power not only to raise him up for a while yeah come on but to give him eternal life right thank you Lord which will be Eternal forever amen poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see what the greater thing is that's the greatest thing that could ever happen was to to impart eternal life to people right amen amen but everybody when you mention Greater Works they'll immediately quote get up here and do what the Lesser works well God's done the Lesser works here you need testimonies out there of the sick healed the dead raised what do you need right right we've seen it here we can testify of it we can verify here amen right we've seen God do great things but we've also seen him do the greater things amen right because the reason most of you are here tonight was because that God reached down and touched you by what somebody said that's right that's right amen right yes sir what somebody preached that's right right sir okay get it in the right order look what he said what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do that a Son of God can right Jesus said whosoever sends you remit to them they are remitted whosoever sends you reain to them they reain now here's where the Catholic church and many others made their big mistake they go out and say I forgive your sins y that wasn't is that's right right that wasn't it that's that's not it to say I forgive it right you said well we've been given power to forgive sins right come by the word come on how did they get sins forgiven in the Bible MH Peter answered that question on the day of Pentecost they said how can we do what can we do to be saved how can we get this that you you all got yeah saved how can we get this that you all got he laid down the prescription he told them what to do he said repent every one of you towards God and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what far the remission of sins dares the Greater Works is taking the gospel Y and preaching it and people believing it and receiving it whether it be listen whether it be healing or signs or wonders right the Bible says faith cometh by what hearing hearing and hearing by the word of God to whether it be healings or signs or W or whether it be salvation right but you see that's all people wanted in the days that the prophet was on the Earth was the healing signs and wonders that's all you hear people talk about you don't hear him say that one older call and 30,000 converts boy if Billy graem or Roberts and them had 30,000 in one meeting well it'd be great wouldn't it it held on yeah right what are you following me the Greater Works amen heal the bodies then we get sick again deliver the people they'll be in bondage again but to be able to preach the gospel amen now the prophet of God said the seed comes through the what body the body amen how does the natural seed get into a woman what from the male that was in his body right all right now how does the bride receive she receives his word y he makes it alive that's why Faith cometh back here amen like I've always said you know preachers is kind of grin when I say it but the Bible still says it it doesn't say faith comes by preaching right now I know the rest of the scripture how can they preach unless they be sent and all that I know all about it but the Bible says faith comes by hearing somebody's got to preach it yes that's what I'm talking about but faith comes by hearing right show me one time in the Bible anybody ever receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without hearing a sermon first right that's right somebody had to bring the message right amen see because Jesus says my words are life that's right yeah now we're getting back to TI the two points together it's not to know the word that's what he was saying there in the scriptures but to know him is eternal life amen all right we got the quotes Ling here it's not to know the word but to know the author of the word that's right amen yes to how the word Made Alive in you brings eternal life amen not how much you read [Applause] it is how much revealed amen all right do you say well now brother Dale I've seen people that can get up and and preach and people will just weep their way to the altar amen I believe in that because there's gifts I believe in it I'm wonderfully I believe in it right well well you preach and they don't come to the altar I talk the Propet taught us we could receive the Holy Ghost sitting in your seat but now listen whether it be because a gift brings you into a uh condition to be able to believe that a lot of people have that gift and I don't have it I'm honest I just don't don't claim to be I just claim to be a preacher of the Gospel right and I guess it's kind of odd because of my experience that I was 2 years in in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and then a lot of you people are your experiences has been over years that you sat here and listened but if it comes out to the end of it what's the difference in years of listening or one sermon if it reaches the same ultimate end right see I don't have the gift of being able to just contact people and and and children I've seen people that be able to just deal with children and just just get right down with them and just so wonderful and and I'm glad of that amen that's a gift yes sir but now what am I going to do well I guess you just quit preaching well I found out a long time ago what the new birth was I found out that the new birth was the revealed word amen the word Made Alive you agree with that amen that's right the new birth is when the word that the disciples took and they held that word they cherished it the scripture say and when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost then they had eternal life y but what if they didn't hold on to the word right see we want everything on an instantaneous quick thing brother Ram said even like he he said a miracle doesn't bring as much Faith to you as it is if you have to hold on a while that's right and finally receive it y now you need those quotes see we want an instant healing but that doesn't bring Faith to us that's just a Deliverance all at once right but they have to hold on and keep confessing it when everybody is saying different from you and you know every doctors declared wrong you're wrong and all and you just keep saying it y amen that's right that brings Faith but see not to know the letter of the word the prophet said but to know him amen who is the word that's right when he that is the word is Made Alive in you there is a son and daughter of God that's right there's somebody that's got something that will hold them like I've always tried to illustrate it you know people come into the message and they're they're find out organized religion is wrong and boy they're on fire they're just going but I while they just first thing you know right back in same old churches in y or even worse yeah but you see somebody come along and they just fighting like everything and struggling but all that time that word is being planted within them and after a while they just come out of there and they say where can we go right thou H has the words of eternal life amen it's all settled then right amen now which way do you want I want the lasting experience I don't be the right way saying it but best I can come up with I want something that'll hold me amen and see that's when I was looking at that scripture there where it says to know him is life amen to know him not to know about him not to be able to tell you all about him right but to have an experience within your heart of the living Christ amen amen then what you have in your head by knowledge can be made alive I've always said I would to God that I had revealed in my heart what is in my head sir amen right meaning in my head is a good computer that can remember a lot of things the prophet said but then one day it just clicks you know all at once you say well that's what it was so now do you understand time together that to know him is life that's right the only way you can have the new birth is for somebody to bring to you the word amen right that's right whether it be the Bible whether it be a tape you're listening to whether it be whatever mama said it or daddy said it or so and so said it or what somebody helped you somebody brought it to you amen that's right it wasn't something you come up with all at once on your own that's right sir right right but it's when something down inside of you can agree with what's being said now is that not what the prophet called the evidence of the Holy Spirit right he said it's love he said it's fruits of the spirit right he didn't argue about those things cuz that's in the Bible but in his finality of what was he saying about the baptism of the Holy Ghost what did he say the evidence whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word amen agrees means keeps on going right amen not agreed but agrees y see then you think it's not dwelling within the the people's heart or whatever and you say well we need to get that's what a man told me one time he said I had to take my wife to a Pentecostal Church to get her free in the spirit where she could receive the Holy Ghost I'm not know what I'm aggravating and hateful and arrogant but I just told him I said brother you messed up oh he didn't like that even later denied it even said it but he came back before he died and told me he did say it but you see I said you mean to tell me now that a Pentecostal now we're talking about a denominational Pentecostal preacher Pentecostal preacher would know more about the baptism of the Holy Ghost than a born again believer in this message a preacher in this message preaching the gospel see what he was saying was and that's what he didn't like the Pentecostal preacher got her all excited got her emotionally worked up the word that she could believe that something did take place and brother R said that some people shouted and receive it some people shouted and didn't receive right but still irregardless you say but but my children I want to take them to a church that's got a an emotional atmosphere where they can be in the presence of God thank you I didn't know you really didn't think that you know I thought you thought the presence of God was here but see you want to go somewhere to some emotional situation instead of just sitting down and taking that word and believeing and let the Holy Spirit Come to it and make it alive right but brother R said if you if you are truly genuine and you're repentant and you get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said God is HonorBound to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost you need that quote see because you've done what he said right amen you're not depending upon shoutings and different things and brother D believes in all of those things and manifestations of God yes sir we are kind of like brother re said about it the other day he said well brother R talking about you know don't jump too high that you can't walk straight and you come down he said we just don't jump too much yeah I guess it's that's about the truth we don't jump very much but I do know you can blow it all out to whistle and and the train won't move well I'd rather just stick it all in the engine and let the Train move a little bit and then I can blow him a whistle while it's coasting downhill you know right you understand what I'm trying to say what is the Greater Works it's not the denominational way of preaching that's not it we're going cover that I got these quotes all you want of that it's not those things but it's by the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost in your heart soul of your being to tell other people how you got saved amen I thought brother Ram told those Brothers they said what should we do now brother brand should we do this he said just go tell them how the candle got lit that's it right right just tell them how the candle got lit amen just tell them what happened to you y you see that's what makes it a big mockery because what do the people of this men say you believe right around the prophet you don't believe right around the prophet you lost now about am I right yeah well is that how the candle got lit maybe that's why lit their candle you right but you know what and I hope to God you take this correctly I believe in all manifestation of the Holy Spirit shouting speaking in tongues all things emotionalism in all form as long as it's in the Holy Spirit right right I do but listen you can do every B of that and still be lost that's right David shouted before the Ark of the Covenant that's right but yet he didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right think about that he didn't have the new birth see to know him as life y That's The Secret the secret of the whole thing is first to know him amen amen then go out and tell people how you got saved right right well I got saved because the seals was preached to bless him you know that that was part of brother brandom's experience sure that's right that was the part of brother Brown's experience but that's not my experience right because he was the one to preach it just as Jesus couldn't preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost cuz it was inside of him right he had to wait and let it come inside of the people where they could preach it brother ROM actually makes this statement he said John preached justification and Jesus preached sanctification amen you like them he said but the disciples preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost to know him is life not to know the letter of the word but for that word that you hear yeah to just come alive in you amen see then you don't have to worry you mean they could deprogram you with a trinity you know I me they take you in deprogram you yeah you know that's what they were trying to do in the fox's book of martyr right was deprogram those people right right and they gave their lives for what they believe right how close as I tried to express to you how close was it on the first I see in counsil that's right it was not an argument over one God or three Gods it was an argument over whether Jesus was God or another substance how close was it right it is so close if you go back and read it you'll find that even I think it's easis or what his name was was the one that was trying to teach the the the fact that Jesus wasn't the substant and a lot of scriptures he was quoting was greater scriptures than the other man was trying to bring but what about it do you next do you actually know him amen that's right or this just just an argument that we have but do you have eternal life if you have eternal life there's only one way to have it and that's the first he the word right amen and the Holy Spirit can Quicken that word amen right making that Word Alive cuz that's what happened in the book of Acts right they had heard the word they were sitting in the upper room you remember the prophet Illustrated I think we got it some of them said let's get up and go I think we got it one of them was wise enough to say wait a minute now you know yourself you're still scared and I am too that's plain language what they were saying but you know when that Holy Ghost came W afraid of nobody see a Christian don't argue right CU there's no need of arguing amen arguments has never settled any problem right but take the word and just place it into your heart that's it just keep reading it reading it you that are wondering about the baptism of the Holy Ghost whether you have it or not take it and believe yep right right and just hold right on to that word that's right that's right I've told you the way I done you know God has been gracious to his old boy I told you what I done and I laid the Bible down laid the book with the side of it and I told God praying God this man here says there'll be false prophets what if he's one of them you know he never spent 2 hours and a half showing me all of the healings and the signs and the Wonders that's right right all he said was one thing and I asked him a second time later and he said the same thing he said what ises the word say Amen how could I argue when he was saying what does the word say that's right and I'd go back and read what the prophet had to say about what the Bible was saying and I could see it unfold so beautiful and I didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I was doing that Bless but you see I held on and I had everybody praying for me where I went I H on until one day brother Mo made a right statement he said brother Dale I don't know what you're hunting for I said I don't either cuz you know I'm not after signs and wonders he said the Holy Ghost is the alive word to receive the word is to receive life now I'm not talking about reading the word I didn't say that right I said to receive the word is life amen not to just read letters off a page right but to receive the god of the letter amen that's right see then the Greater Works is being done yes the true five-fold Ministry is preaching the gospel amen you notice the words I use they're preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ that the prophet of God handed down to us and depending totally upon the prophet's message for the answer to all questions that's right amen not their own thoughts and their own ideas or own Concepts or what everybody's taught them or something that's right is it just to know him as life amen not to know his word that's the way you find life is to know him not know his book but to know him amen not to know your church but to know him not to thirst to satisfy the pastor but to satisfy the Lord right that's right see we're children of God right amen God wants his children to be strong and sturdy not arrogant and hateful but strong and sturdy in his word amen that ever a little wind of Doctrine won't throw you every which you way you wonder what this is and what that is well that brother so and so said that well so what brother told me there the other night said this man said that brother Brown told him that the beast in the garden was a big black man I said what was he mean yeah well he said brother Brown told him where did Brother Brown say that the brother said they think the curse that was put on Cain was that he was made black he said if that be so it ended at the flood because you only had the descendant of Noah that would eradicated the black man if that's what you're talking about what's the reason I'm not saying brother Brown didn't say that he was a great big huge dark colored man sure because being in an environment they was in they probably be dark but to show you how people get all tied up we got talking about DNA and he said well there's only three types of blood and that's a b and O you know o mix with anything he said well Eve was a Adam was a b was Eve and the Beast was O I said I said according to my understanding Eve was in Adam come on M so that meant E's blood type was a if Adams was a right you see it's always something to try to talize the ears you know about years ago I've heard preachers in this message preach that look at the black man if you want to find the big ball players the big guys coming out of black people well you know I'm kind of glad now they getting all these guys from overseas and I never didn't know how that a Chinese could be 7 foot6 I thought it was little bitty people that's right they're not coming out of Africa now the big ones are not right they're coming out of some of these countries that they're not supposed to even be that way it looks God supposed to be Liv B people I'm not making a joke right I'm just talking about how that we take our mind and we try to comprehend the word right yep that's right let the Holy Spirit tell you what the word says amen then you'll find him saying it says what it said Jesus said the church would be able to do Greater Works yeah righten CU you see all of his preaching he had to die Amen to bring the Holy Spirit upon the people y right but we can preach the gospel and the Holy Spirit can follow the word and give birth to Children amen and lead us into understanding the Greater Works is the preaching of the Gospel amen right because with that then there'll automatically be signs and wonders amen always has been and always will be right amen these signs shall follow them that believe right Amen brother Harris used to say Believers don't follow signs and signs follow believers that's a good one that's right but do you see what I'm talking about don't misc confuse me of what I'm saying now I'm not talking about just preaching I'm talking about what it says about the foolishness of preacher right right now what's the foolishness of preaching I bunch of foolish preachers if that didn't say that that me what the Bible that's right no you tell me how come you believe this message come on all right you explain to me why you believe this message amen will we follow Vindicated Prophet with it well if that's all you can say then that's all you got right but you see I like to tell people about what I know Amen to know him is life amen let me tell you what's in my heart that's right you see that's why I don't have to worry about what anybody else says that's right I just wait on him amen that's a way to talk to anybody that's right can't do it no way you talking to somebody just wait don't be yuy yuy yuy let them talk that's it nine times out of 10 they wind up confus their own self so much they don't know what's going on right let talk right then after a while you say well I want to go now you said and now you saying just time talk that's right and just wait on the one that's inside you amen you know what I wait on I say a lot of times I'll be talking to somebody and I said I remember brother Brown explained that one day how did he say it and you know what that's the answer I give is how he said right that's a good answer right yep but have you had a personal experience right man of eternal life does the person of Christ lives inside of you if he does he got there because somebody preached to you amen you heard the word somewhere and God made it alive now they ended up then that's why the Bible says what ye are what written Epistles known and read of all mankind oh my on Amen now brother Ram explained that right y he said you're not something added to the word he said that's not what it's saying that's right he said really it's saying you are the Epistles that are written and then people can look at it and see what you believe come on church that's why I stay and spent so much time there Sunday morning I wish everybody hope everybody in this church listen to that t amen cuz it was a hard Endeavor in my life to try to preach it see you go out sisters and you cut the ends of your hire and you put a little makeup on you're a hypocrite to the world and ain't going to listen to what you say that's right because your life is speaking so loud you can't hear your words that's that's right but the true sweetness of the Holy Spirit living in you and in you walking in the life you live before others amen that can win people to the word you remember the the man that brother R called it lizard ey Hunter the guy that bur he had talked to him about the Lord cuz later he said but lead me to that God you've talked about right so surely brother random had talked with him but none of that led him surely brother randam had even maybe told him Visions he had and things that were happening and and where the animals were at and whatever this was or that was none of that one birth but when he saw that mother deer put her life on the line for her little one that led him to Jesus Christ that's right she was a book brother randam says amen the book is sealed and you're sealed with the book right where did that book come from it's all I'm going to say and then stop where did that book come from in Revelations 5 we thank God for a prophet we even know where the lamb came from right you're going to find out one of these days brother brother Dale in 1982 in 79 and 82 tried his best to preach something to you and never chosen to try about go back over and I want this time not to take a seal and go through it no but I still believe it that's right you're the book in in the hand of the one sitting on amen that's it yes and you're sealed with the book that's right right you're what's sealed up you're what sealed up what is the opening of the seal oh that an't a Christ that ain't no seal see the Holy Spirit according to Ephesians 4:30 I'm just giving you something to think on I've come back to a place to try to explain something I'm Not Looking Back 2,000 years to an open book I'm not looking back before the foundation of the world to an open book right we're in the time of the book so that's right that's how the Antichrist you can see who he is not but called because you're written Epistles to know him is life and the Greater Works is to preach the gospel to the people that take and take that word and actually have a birth the birth of Jesus Christ right come on Brothers right to know him not to know about that's it but the know him there no argument then about it there's nothing to argue [Music] about but to know him is life amen and to know him then you have within you the life of the man that I hope you listen to that your Prophet said he could not preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost it had not come into manifestation you can't preach something until it's in manifestation right now tie that and just write that little thought down you can't preach something until it comes into manifestation that's the prophet of God could not preach the Lamb of Revelations 5 until it come into manifestation and you'll find out he wasn't talking about a Ram or lamb or right he wouldn't even just talking about Jesus no how many times have you ever heard me make this statement in the Book of Revelation show me Jesus by himself anyone any work come and show me show me Jesus by himself in the Book of Revelation you will never find you said well it yeah where did it come from right see Church we've had a message that's right 46 in the red book 46 in the red book anybody have a need we've had a message of eternal life the man that stood here and talked about eternal life that's what it was to me when I first saw him we used to talk about eternal life when we got up into heaven we're going up y under where eternal life is at and here stood a
