[0:02] [Music]
[0:05] recorder god bless it more efficient
[0:11] more oh really so I'm gonna this morning
[0:18] I'm just going to launch it to try and
[0:19] just kind of a little slow methodical
[0:21] little teacher and we're just going to
[0:23] go through the scriptures and talk about
[0:25] the importance of the word understand
[0:27] commitment about occupation and I took
[0:32] maybe a strange scripture for this maybe
[0:35] off you can see the topic your knowing
[0:37] nothing sometimes we get we misinterpret
[0:41] some of the things that brother Graham
[0:43] saying we can almost get in our head
[0:45] that that is unjust to not even
[0:47] understand anything about the message
[0:49] then it's fine just you got to go along
[0:51] with just a little read some of the
[0:54] quotes a little bit but we'll just kind
[0:57] of talk this morning about the
[0:58] importance of understanding what brother
[1:01] Branham taught that it's important to
[1:04] know what the message is about is not
[1:06] it's not that the end goal here is not
[1:08] just to say well I believe that God sent
[1:11] prophets and I believe that the message
[1:14] is bright and those kind of things but
[1:16] it's important to know what the message
[1:18] is about now maybe this morning we'll
[1:21] talk about a lot of things that we're
[1:23] all familiar with and we've heard before
[1:24] but it kind of I think it comes helpful
[1:27] to kind of review just maybe so that we
[1:30] can see that our and understand the
[1:32] times that we're living in and kind of
[1:34] understand the things that are happening
[1:35] around us as well and maybe also just to
[1:38] have sort of will have an answer when
[1:40] maybe somebody comes and and prevents
[1:44] some things too you'll be able to have a
[1:45] response and this scripture that I found
[1:48] this will first slide it and the list of
[1:50] him to have others
[1:51] any wisdom Israel belies for the back of
[1:55] him that Android of understand my kind
[1:59] of strong you know when we compare that
[2:01] with a child child run around I didn't
[2:03] know I was supposed to say we could used
[2:05] to liquor the job then it's time for
[2:07] spank it so you give a little whooping
[2:10] but so that they'll understand this time
[2:12] we'll the same time in the same way in
[2:15] the Apple accessories something good
[2:17] that Paul told the tires so Titus was
[2:20] set up on the island of Crete and all
[2:22] said look they're silly
[2:24] to begin to teach people and kind of
[2:26] fall down to second couple numerous set
[2:30] up some ministers because bishops you
[2:33] know and that elders in each church so
[2:35] that the people will be able to be
[2:37] educated and these are the simple words
[2:39] that Paul gave to titus instead for
[2:42] there are many unruly and vain talkers
[2:44] and deceivers specially they of the
[2:47] circumcision and he's a special enabled
[2:51] in other words the people that should
[2:53] have been knowing what they were talking
[2:55] about didn't have any understanding they
[2:58] didn't know what they should have known
[3:00] because they were just going based on
[3:03] intellectual conviction and and told
[3:05] policies and very great words here they
[3:07] didn't know what they were talking about
[3:09] and this is his worst to title as he
[3:13] sent him up on the increase and telling
[3:16] it not to approach the ministry to tell
[3:18] them not to approach of teaching people
[3:20] and had to approach his ministry
[3:23] they said whose mouths must be stopped
[3:26] who subvert whole houses teaching things
[3:29] which they ought not for filthy lucre
[3:31] sake
[3:32] in other words for their own personal
[3:34] in it for for the blessing of the people
[3:36] but they're in it just sooner that they
[3:38] can get following and get money and
[3:41] things like that he said one of
[3:43] themselves even a prophet of their own
[3:45] said the cretians are always liars evil
[3:48] beasts slow bellies this witness is
[3:52] truth now see a lot of times we kind of
[3:55] people kind of you know must get to the
[3:58] point where you don't like playing
[3:59] somebody just appreciated what somebody
[4:02] tells it to set it out there on the
[4:04] table where you can see it and you can
[4:06] even disagree with it or three it
[4:08] nepal's is pause is laying out there the
[4:11] accretion don't tell the truth and it's
[4:15] Sunday Monday when you get this from
[4:17] let's go throw this crime real real
[4:19] quick and we'll read the poet the
[4:21] Prophet that he's talking about the
[4:24] minute he was this was the guy's name it
[4:26] he what he wrote this poem about
[4:27] Mizzou's and I'm just kind of quickly
[4:29] flipping over to this whether you have a
[4:31] little bit of context and he wanted to
[4:33] convince the people that deuce was
[4:34] immoral but he said they fashion
[4:36] attorney for the ill holding and I
[4:38] warned the cretins always liars evil
[4:41] beasts idle Bailey's that now are not
[4:44] dead i liveth and abideth forever
[4:45] frenzied we live and move and have our
[4:47] being
[4:48] so F amenities was the profit to the
[4:51] credence try to convince them to instead
[4:54] Zeus was not just somebody who could
[4:56] have died and was immortal and all those
[4:57] things so that's were Paul getting that
[4:59] the cretins always liars evil beasts
[5:01] idle really and he's agreeing with it
[5:05] and so he said wherefore rebuke them
[5:08] sharply that they may be sound in the
[5:10] faith not getting any P to Jewish fables
[5:13] and commandments of men that turn from
[5:15] the truth so that's the whole point of
[5:18] the gospel to raise up people that are
[5:20] swayed by every wind of doctrine that
[5:22] are grounded and rooted in an
[5:24] understanding of what the scripture is
[5:26] what the Scriptures talking about and
[5:29] who Jesus Christ is and then when you
[5:32] begin to see Jesus Christ is you can
[5:34] begin to see your pardon him and so
[5:37] without understanding without knowing
[5:40] what the gospel is about you're using
[5:42] the whole essence of what what this is
[5:48] it proverbs please agree to the prudent
[5:51] man proceed to evil and itís themself
[5:53] but the simple past home and unpunished
[5:56] proverbs 28 5 does equal men understand
[5:59] not judgment but they that seek the Lord
[6:02] understand all things Ephesians 4:17 18
[6:07] says this I say therefore and testify
[6:09] Noah that he gives birth walk not as
[6:11] other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[6:14] their mind having the understanding
[6:16] darkened being alienated from the life
[6:20] of God through the ignorance that is in
[6:22] them they call the deployment of their
[6:25] art and you can see on these scriptures
[6:26] that whatever you get a chance maybe it
[6:29] certain just do a search across the
[6:31] Scriptures a bottle first and find all
[6:33] the little references of ingress and no
[6:37] understanding and blindness and having
[6:40] your mind dot you because that the
[6:44] purpose of the gospel is to enlighten us
[6:47] and to show us these things so that
[6:49] we're not we will be walking around not
[6:51] knowing which way to turn not new you're
[6:53] not knowing what what to do Hosea 4:6
[6:56] says my people are destroyed for lack of
[6:58] knowledge because thou has rejected
[7:00] knowledge I will also reject me - thou
[7:03] shalt be no priest to meet seeing thou
[7:05] has forgotten the law by God I will also
[7:08] forget that children I'm just going to
[7:12] kind of go through so many scriptures
[7:14] talking about it acts 17:30 at the times
[7:19] of this ignorance God winked at but now
[7:21] commandeth all men everywhere to repent
[7:24] so there's a time there's a season where
[7:27] God will wink at your ignorance when you
[7:29] begin to hear about the gospel on the
[7:32] day of Pentecost Peter came out and
[7:33] begin to preach a nice day you know if
[7:35] you asked him what do you believe the
[7:37] people that are sitting out there on the
[7:38] street they would have said I don't know
[7:40] I need somebody to teach me to tell me
[7:43] something
[7:43] they said openly to brother what should
[7:45] we do and Peter was able to tell them
[7:48] he knew he had understanding of what the
[7:50] Scriptures were I'll tell you what you
[7:52] need to hear you repent I think you need
[7:54] to die being baptized at the time of
[7:57] your death the top of your dinner
[7:59] reservation without a lot of dying a
[8:02] type of being dying taking up your cross
[8:05] and dying with Christ and you come up
[8:08] and rest in a reservation a type of
[8:09] communis of life and then you help an
[8:12] insurance is going believing that the
[8:14] whole ego the promises to you and so the
[8:17] people out there that there is a point
[8:19] in your life where you don't you're kind
[8:21] of growing you need somebody to teach
[8:23] you so God weeks is that period at the
[8:26] ingress but there's a time if going
[8:29] along with when we need to come to a
[8:32] place where we begin to other state he
[8:35] had the point of the day in the weeks
[8:37] you will judge the world in
[8:39] righteousness by that man whom he hath
[8:41] ordained whereof he has given assurance
[8:43] unto all men and if you raised him from
[8:45] the dead and literally of this scripture
[8:49] right here for a second Matthew 16:23
[8:52] this is way when when when Peter was
[8:54] kind of fruit it divided he rebuked
[8:57] Jesus and he said that you're not going
[8:59] to die the way that you said during
[9:01] Jesus will say that that you don't have
[9:03] to die so forth and and Peter turning
[9:05] mr. Lord not stone and Jesus turn right
[9:08] you and he said baby turn it instead of
[9:10] the Peter get thee behind these take an
[9:12] hour and a fits unto me but our
[9:14] favorites not the things that real God
[9:16] but those that billion so what does that
[9:20] work favor mean I don't know if you can
[9:22] see that I'm just going to read it
[9:24] that's worth favors and agree in the
[9:27] word throw nail and it means to plead to
[9:31] regard to be minded to save her to be of
[9:35] the same mind down here and read says to
[9:38] have understanding to be wise in other
[9:41] words Peter didn't understand what was
[9:44] happening what was taking place and so
[9:46] when you begin to understand you begin
[9:49] to that number
[9:51] they have allowed to direct one's mind
[9:54] to a thing to seek to strive for when
[9:57] you begin to understand importance of
[9:59] the opening of the word then that will
[10:02] become your objective and that's why
[10:04] we're the eldest of a new birth is to be
[10:06] inward all the way because you
[10:09] continuously strive for that your that's
[10:12] all the did you mind is to get closer to
[10:14] God you just begin to desire a stick and
[10:18] strive for that to get to get more
[10:21] understanding now you know there's two
[10:24] different kinds of understanding there's
[10:26] an understanding from the hand and
[10:27] there's an understanding what they'll
[10:29] drop valley to the heart if you believe
[10:32] it and open the door to faith over the
[10:35] door of faith so they will drop down
[10:38] into the heart then that gives you a
[10:40] spiritual understanding so there's two
[10:43] different kinds of understanding that it
[10:45] can overfill the confusing one up you
[10:47] first you have to have that mental kind
[10:49] of understanding there's gotta be
[10:51] somebody that lay it out for you so that
[10:53] you can be and these kind of have that
[10:55] you know note you know there's such a
[10:57] thing that salvation know that God can
[10:59] do something for you in your life that
[11:02] you need to repair and then those kind
[11:04] of things and you let it drop down in
[11:06] your heart so that it can become a
[11:08] living reality and change your life so
[11:12] that's maybe my for this morning is it
[11:15] it seems like many maybe this almost
[11:18] sounds a little bit critical huh
[11:20] so we're saying that you don't need
[11:22] understanding and you're miss Chloe but
[11:25] rather where you said to just just you
[11:28] don't have to understand just believe
[11:29] well that's true because you start out
[11:31] now not understanding from a spiritual
[11:34] standpoint but you must understand from
[11:36] the head standpoint let's have it lay it
[11:39] out there for you now to look at some of
[11:44] the closer program said and Satan beat
[11:49] I don't think you got it because I've
[11:58] already ordered I'll read it think they
[12:04] were that I don't know it is mistakenly
[12:09] in the 96 poverty today
[12:11] so does ministers and seminaries
[12:13] learning man-made theology it may it be
[12:16] right it may be a good understanding of
[12:18] the thing but it's wrong and may be a
[12:20] good mental understanding and maybe just
[12:23] to put this in a context like life for
[12:25] example Augustine who studied the
[12:28] scriptures and laid them all out and he
[12:31] got in his hand the idea that if the
[12:33] people won't believe that will force
[12:35] them to believe that and then he began
[12:37] to kill the people because he said if
[12:39] you won't believe what I believe that it
[12:42] would be better for me to kill you let's
[12:44] force the people to believe and he had a
[12:46] mental understanding a mental concept of
[12:49] what it was to be a Christian even
[12:50] though he had started it out and had it
[12:53] all in his he and lay it out in his mind
[12:55] and still it was not a correct spiritual
[12:57] understanding so that's what I believe
[13:00] that brother I was speaking over he said
[13:02] we all have to understand it we believe
[13:05] it because God said it's though and that
[13:08] settled it forever and he said oh how
[13:11] evil up stood to have a PhD see how she
[13:13] lost it to be smarter than what you will
[13:17] so let's look at some examples of this
[13:20] where what people try to understand it
[13:24] before God gives them what spiritual
[13:26] revelation or spiritual understanding
[13:28] this is this is what he's talking about
[13:30] Latif where God spoke and justice 1:28
[13:33] he's getting God bless them and God said
[13:35] unto them be fruitful and multiply and
[13:37] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[13:40] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[13:42] and over the fowl of the air over every
[13:43] living thing that moveth
[13:44] on the earth be fruitful and multiply
[13:46] and replenish the earth so it comes
[13:49] along as she's sort of tried to she
[13:51] doesn't know what that is yet she knows
[13:54] that is true because God spoken of
[13:56] course it's true but it's laid out there
[13:58] but she tries to put her own mental
[14:00] content to it and it gets it all twisted
[14:03] up he had tried to figure it out and it
[14:05] produces Cain because she's trying to
[14:07] figure it out with her own life wait
[14:09] until God reveals it to you and then
[14:12] you'll know you have that spiritual
[14:13] understanding because you can't figure
[14:16] it out but when it when it when God
[14:18] comes on the scene then you know and so
[14:21] maybe if I'm jumping ahead a little bit
[14:23] and so my slides if God has revealed it
[14:26] to a man they can hear behind the pulpit
[14:28] and he knows because God has come on the
[14:31] scene and building with the Holy Ghost
[14:33] and he knows what the revelation is and
[14:36] he's presenting it that's that's what
[14:38] the gospel is you can trust you have
[14:41] trust in that man because he's got the
[14:43] word though God had come on the scene
[14:45] and spoken through that man it is
[14:48] revealing his word for that man there's
[14:53] another scripture they are 714 really
[15:01] [Music]
[15:02] really obvious of working that there for
[15:06] the Lord and stuff shall give you a son
[15:08] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[15:10] a son and shall call his name Emmanuel
[15:13] well there's another scripture that
[15:15] people trying to figure out they all
[15:17] know through the ages is it going to be
[15:19] this person or this person who's what
[15:21] kind of person he god I actually do this
[15:23] and even though God has spoken it but
[15:26] when the time change for that baby to be
[15:28] born they'll want to know more figured
[15:31] it out it was the evidence was right
[15:32] there so God
[15:34] purpose is a word when God brought his
[15:36] word and passed and there was no more
[15:38] question they had an understanding of
[15:40] what that was what I was supposed to be
[15:42] Mary knew with that well as you went and
[15:44] be any problem started to Elizabeth and
[15:46] son of the door brother I said as soon
[15:49] as the Lord Jesus was was spoken from
[15:52] her lips then the child Elizabeth woman
[15:56] begins at leap for life because she was
[15:59] speaking of a revelation of the day God
[16:01] had you know there is she was speaking
[16:03] about a revelation because now she knew
[16:05] she had an understanding of what this
[16:07] scripture was and I've replace it
[16:10] because it seemed like when God when God
[16:13] interprets his word there's no more
[16:15] question you have an understanding and
[16:19] then it can be communicated it can be
[16:21] imparted to others so they're saying
[16:23] that we don't have that we don't even
[16:26] know what the message is about that that
[16:28] we don't have to have to understand that
[16:30] there's all of these your message is
[16:32] something that can be probed and
[16:33] questioned and and there's no way to
[16:35] understand the thing to deep things I
[16:38] believe it the reason brother Graham
[16:41] came was to give the bride a message so
[16:44] that we could become one with the word
[16:46] and receive it and a grouse become one
[16:48] with that miss mark 9:31 32 the
[16:53] pre-college disciples of said the son of
[16:55] man is delivered into the hands of me
[16:58] and they shall kill him and after that
[17:00] he is kill he shall rise the third day
[17:03] he plainly told them what what that was
[17:05] you know it's that famous question that
[17:08] he asked Peter who do you say that I was
[17:09] son of man am he even told me to the
[17:11] engine who do you say that I was so
[17:13] demanding and Peter didn't quite have a
[17:16] foreword he had her of the revelation
[17:18] that was a church to be founded on down
[17:20] to the seven churches the revelation of
[17:22] the Son of God he said I know who you
[17:25] are the son of God but that revelation
[17:27] of the Son of Man will be hidden until
[17:29] just of just here the last the last and
[17:33] so he tell them the Son of Man is
[17:35] delivered
[17:35] the hands of men and they shall kill him
[17:37] and after that he is kill he survives
[17:39] the third day but they didn't have a
[17:41] spiritual understanding of what was
[17:43] happening so wait until God and services
[17:46] onward and then you know but my point
[17:50] maybe this morning is when God and
[17:51] purposes murdered then you know and you
[17:54] have an understanding of the day and
[17:56] hour as you're living into what's taking
[17:58] place in this spiritual that this kind
[18:04] of scripture Jesus said the woman at the
[18:06] oil which he began to he begin to tell
[18:08] her about the things that are alive and
[18:10] she asked that famous question well ok
[18:13] well where are we supposed to worship my
[18:15] fathers worshiped in this mountain and
[18:16] you say the Jews saying you're supposed
[18:18] to worship it in Jerusalem and he said
[18:20] I'll take you where I worship you
[18:22] worship in spirit and truth and people
[18:25] are beginning to realize because the
[18:26] world is beginning to open up how I
[18:28] worship and then she begins to realize
[18:31] you know the Bible said I've been taught
[18:34] that the Messiah is going to come so he
[18:37] had been taught that the Messiah was
[18:39] going to come but now the Messiah was
[18:41] staying there in Rome it's right there
[18:43] so the things that she didn't understand
[18:46] before now it was right there right
[18:49] there standing in the front of her she
[18:52] said I know that Messiah cometh Testino
[18:54] - so my hippo burst to make some and
[18:56] destructed her which is called Christ
[18:59] when he has come he will tell us all
[19:01] things and he's offended her I that
[19:03] speak unto the end he and writing as she
[19:07] opened up the door of faith and to see
[19:09] that and it went running down into the
[19:11] village killing everybody and now she
[19:14] knew who the firewood she had heard
[19:17] about it but now she did and see the
[19:22] importance of having understanding of of
[19:25] seeking and savoring the word this
[19:27] little story of Jesus telling the
[19:31] disciples that except to eat the flesh
[19:33] of the Son of Man and drink his blood
[19:35] you have no life now of course they
[19:38] didn't understand that and you know this
[19:40] is when when Jesus begins a
[19:43] the first part of his ministry he cast
[19:46] out Devils you know started off kind of
[19:49] the first the second pull start off slow
[19:51] but then he begin to drop the truth and
[19:53] and that's when people begin you know in
[19:57] the assembly lips then they will fail it
[20:00] up after you begin to say these things
[20:02] he's dropping the waters laying out
[20:04] their truth can you receive it and so
[20:07] many said oh well this is I don't
[20:09] understand it so I I'm going to have to
[20:11] leave it I'm going to have to it's too
[20:13] harsh you know and and so Jesus asked
[20:18] the disciples are you going to leave
[20:20] also and and the Peters famous response
[20:24] Lord to whom shall we go that has the
[20:27] words of eternal life
[20:28] that that's the most important thing of
[20:32] all you know you think of this little
[20:35] span of life where things are hard and
[20:37] sometimes even going to church is hard
[20:38] and it seems like sometimes maybe
[20:40] friends abandon your things and things
[20:44] get rough and there's so many struggles
[20:46] and stuff but think about this little
[20:49] three-panel true when you got all
[20:53] eternity laid out and before here if
[20:55] you'll just accept the word of the lower
[20:58] so that's the most important thing for
[21:01] any of our lives is the word of God and
[21:05] if you can grasp that if you can see why
[21:09] that's so important then you will begin
[21:12] to savor the water you'll be into hunger
[21:15] after it beyond everything if you hungry
[21:19] thirst for the world of the love of
[21:21] world do you the love of God is not in
[21:23] you
[21:25] because you're still hungry after those
[21:27] things and creating anger thirsts for
[21:29] the things of the world it's better for
[21:31] the word that's what John 626 miss
[21:37] Dillon says labor not for the meat which
[21:39] perishes but for that meat which
[21:41] endureth unto everlasting life will a
[21:44] ver it's a labor and that's what Paul
[21:46] offered labor that you might enter into
[21:49] the rest labor and even after you enter
[21:52] into the rest you're resting but you're
[21:54] still labeling your you're hungry you're
[21:57] searching out trying to find the word
[22:00] let me give you a little illustration
[22:03] the Bible says then man in the
[22:06] wilderness was like coriander seed this
[22:09] is coriander seed over land so it was
[22:11] about that size and if every morning
[22:14] when they woke up they would go out and
[22:16] it would be scattered across the ground
[22:18] if you didn't get it by noon that it was
[22:20] dissolved it will be gold so you had to
[22:22] hurry you've got to get everybody got
[22:24] you the homework reach man so that is
[22:26] about the side of court inside of the
[22:28] coriander seed and it looks like valium
[22:31] which is this Robin so it looked like
[22:33] that though this is the description from
[22:36] the Bible so if you can imagine it being
[22:38] about that size and about that
[22:40] appearance that's what the man and the
[22:42] wilderness look like so every morning it
[22:44] would wake up and they would see -
[22:45] scattered out and and I want to name the
[22:50] people as they began to go out I thought
[22:52] it should be easy to get it up off the
[22:54] ground just doesn't go out just look so
[22:57] long and your work is done but if you
[23:00] think about the size of this and just
[23:02] amongst the rocks and things and it
[23:04] takes a little bit of effort to get an
[23:06] overfull for each man which is not about
[23:09] nine and a half cups to get nine and a
[23:12] half cups of this for every man and and
[23:15] then Saturday you got to get done for a
[23:17] person so that you carry over 230 so
[23:21] it's always been an effort
[23:23] it's an effort
[23:25] you know find out the word remember
[23:27] those six dreams that the different
[23:30] people in brother branham's church had
[23:31] and one of them was with the cow going
[23:34] through the brush trying to find the
[23:38] little green plus trying to find that
[23:40] food cutting it out and brother
[23:43] branham's aluminum alone we call it a
[23:45] labor it's an effort to find the word
[23:47] that you have to put it out it's not
[23:51] going to be this late in your lap but if
[23:54] you're savoring the things of God if
[23:56] you're straining the word then it will
[23:58] be a joy to you and get is a word and
[24:00] find those little nuggets where it just
[24:03] begins to open up to you and where first
[24:06] it was all your like throwing in
[24:08] darkness but then the word begins to
[24:11] come together and you can begin to see a
[24:13] picture clearly then you know the word
[24:16] man I know there's a lot of speculation
[24:17] about what that word means but what what
[24:21] one person says debt up the word manna
[24:26] came from this scripture in numbers 11 6
[24:29] but whether the Israelites are kind of
[24:31] complaining and they said now our soul
[24:35] is dried away there's nothing and all
[24:37] beside this man before our eyes their
[24:41] complaint they didn't know they didn't
[24:43] know in other words what it woman and so
[24:46] that's what they strong is number says
[24:48] that the word man it goes from as you
[24:50] can see it right here the meaning of it
[24:52] is what is wood they didn't know what it
[24:56] was and that's maybe my point this boy
[24:59] is do we know what the word is do we
[25:02] know the value of it that is not just
[25:05] something that we have a feel of
[25:06] understanding of then we're just kind of
[25:08] going along trying to try to know more
[25:10] than other people but as to the Word of
[25:13] God will change us this change that's
[25:16] what Elementary's the power of
[25:18] transformation when you receive the word
[25:21] and begin to become the word it takes
[25:24] you out like it took the Israelites out
[25:26] of Egypt and you get to
[25:29] you out of the world and they get to
[25:31] remove you from the world and you begin
[25:34] to eat one day this word that we been
[25:37] feasting on will take us from the world
[25:39] your boat it will change or more funny
[25:46] how we be quicker so we don't need to be
[25:55] saying what is it we should know what it
[25:58] is an importance of it what it what kind
[26:01] of question but God is giving me food
[26:04] and their responses out what is don't
[26:07] know what it is and they begin to be
[26:10] getting grumpy about it and it will wait
[26:12] you know God has made it in this layout
[26:14] of CNAs yes so we have it so easy week
[26:17] we should be able to lean back in our
[26:20] recliners and put the tape in and to put
[26:23] them open the Bible and relax and study
[26:26] the word but we're so relaxed it is we
[26:29] got to the point where we just do it do
[26:32] we really savor the Word of God today
[26:35] and that's worth a whole nother than a
[26:38] scripture from from Hebrews four nine
[26:40] were prompted let us labor therefore to
[26:43] enter into that rest lest any man fall
[26:46] after the same example of unbelief
[26:48] because it is a late your Lavery and
[26:51] struggling and striving even though
[26:54] arrested because it's not your words
[26:57] your horse cries to live in you but you
[27:00] got to bring water to you so that you
[27:03] can open it up and it I have a paradox
[27:06] in the word is in you but you have to
[27:09] bring the word to him then he could so
[27:12] he can open it up problems 12:11 he that
[27:16] killeth his land shall be satisfied with
[27:19] bread he that followeth vain person in
[27:21] void of understanding some if you follow
[27:26] somebody that's just in it for their own
[27:28] game you will be void of understand
[27:33] well then we'll kind of get in it that's
[27:37] my brother instead
[27:38] false teachers will bring false birth
[27:41] true prophet will bring the word the
[27:44] birth of the word of Christ false
[27:46] prophets will bring all birth the birth
[27:49] of churches the birth of preach the
[27:51] birth of denominations and he goes on
[27:54] declared Iowa false teaching is Paul's
[27:56] teaching gets you away from the word
[27:59] being the birth of the word it gets you
[28:01] over looking at evidence evidence being
[28:04] sensations and anything told anything
[28:08] other than the word being born that's
[28:11] the only evidence the evidence for the
[28:13] new birth is to receive the word for
[28:15] your day the evidence of the new birth
[28:17] is to work bring the word Baur
[28:19] the evidence of a new birth is and that
[28:22] you're in the word all wait the word is
[28:25] being over to you and then down to the
[28:27] end the last couple of years but every
[28:29] sense that famous message fate is worse
[28:33] expressed because when the word comes in
[28:36] you begin to believe it it will produce
[28:38] the life of Christ and now you've got
[28:41] the evidence you got the light of Christ
[28:43] expressed in you so so see if if the
[28:48] word of God is come on the scene if does
[28:50] is there then it can be preached it
[28:53] can't enough it's not like the message
[28:55] is some something that we just nobody
[28:57] really understands I just believe that
[28:59] God for the problem because he came so
[29:03] that we would believe what he brought
[29:06] what he taught now I know this was got
[29:09] up this you've got a saint that will
[29:10] ever everybody heard so many times
[29:13] there's been but I'm sure gravity so
[29:20] look look at this another quote that's
[29:23] so many misinterpret and you know this
[29:25] is one of the things that in the message
[29:27] today who can interpret what the ransom
[29:29] note end on Wednesday so and so there's
[29:33] so much confusion there's so much you
[29:35] know kid is it possible to know what
[29:39] more around me at least
[29:41] space he said God need to nobody to
[29:44] interpret his words because his own
[29:46] interpretation by bringing to pass the
[29:49] things that he said he would do we got
[29:51] to him to let there be life there was
[29:54] life that needs no interpretation it's
[29:57] clear a virgin shall conceive and she
[30:01] did the son of man goes up to Jerusalem
[30:04] given advance of sinful man they'll
[30:07] crucify little referred he'll rise again
[30:09] that needs no interpretation you get a
[30:13] little while and the world fiddly little
[30:16] more yet we shall see for our be weave
[30:19] it into the into the age to the
[30:21] consummation he is here it doesn't need
[30:25] any interpretation the worst that I do
[30:29] shall he do also either believeth on me
[30:32] the works that I do shall he do also and
[30:34] we know that that three so it doesn't
[30:38] need a interpretation let's just read
[30:40] this friendly quote God don't need
[30:44] anybody to interpret this word he
[30:47] interprets his own word when he said
[30:49] anything it happens that the
[30:51] interpretation they don't need anyone to
[30:54] say well I believe that means this God I
[30:57] didn't find it by his own interpretation
[30:59] me so that sounds like well it is not
[31:04] appreciated let's just kind of let's
[31:07] just read the Bible around and we'll
[31:10] just like begin in the early the
[31:13] beginning where it says Abram and did
[31:15] according to as I don't like to get out
[31:17] at home whatever he want to be he said
[31:21] the reason that they had this to
[31:23] teachers to my opinion now they had
[31:27] interpreted the word because they all
[31:29] believed in it coming
[31:30] sighs always relieved it may be
[31:33] yesterday but the reason that they
[31:35] didn't recognize him his message wasn't
[31:37] according to their ecclesiastical fear
[31:39] they their interpretation they had of
[31:42] the word the Messiah never manifested
[31:44] himself in the way that they had
[31:46] interpreted that he was do it so God
[31:49] will come on the scene is show the
[31:51] correct interpretation of the word if
[31:54] man tries to interpret it by their own
[31:55] understanding the ecology ah that's what
[31:59] Lauren said mountains the seven churches
[32:00] men the water began to Auckland but man
[32:03] was always probing in it so God had to
[32:05] send a prophet all the same to
[32:07] straighten everything out and this is
[32:12] the quote lay off the interchange of the
[32:14] roads that there are those who say that
[32:15] God's people are going to come together
[32:17] through a collective revelation in other
[32:19] words that there won't be one man a
[32:20] prophet that comes on the scene to
[32:23] straighten everything out but everybody
[32:24] will just kind of have get come to there
[32:26] come to the to the right understanding
[32:29] altogether these are not challenge that
[32:31] paper this is a fault and valid
[32:33] assumption in the face of Revelation ten
[32:35] seven there is one prophet messenger to
[32:38] the Saints and he said he will need to
[32:39] speak for himself of God must be ported
[32:42] by the voice of the son so the Prophet
[32:47] goes on the scene he begins to speak a
[32:49] message to interpret the word the people
[32:51] to get giddy if God is interpreting his
[32:53] word by revelation let's see what it
[32:56] says here in Tennessee in searching he
[32:57] says but thank God of this moment this
[33:00] age is not a room get down to the pole
[33:02] he will speak out and those who receive
[33:05] that prophet in his own name whereas
[33:08] these have been a beneficent effect of
[33:10] that property minister and they that
[33:13] hear him will be blessed and become part
[33:15] of that bride of the last day who are
[33:18] mentioned in revelation 22:17
[33:21] the spirit and the bride say come
[33:24] so now you got the bride speaking where
[33:28] she speaking
[33:29] she's speaking the same thing that she's
[33:31] heard the messenger speak she can't get
[33:34] out under that messenger so the
[33:35] messenger has the correct interpretation
[33:37] of all the things that people probe that
[33:41] doesn't the seven churches but now the
[33:44] true interpretation has been given
[33:46] forward so you can receive it and hear
[33:49] it and become one with it and then you
[33:51] can begin to speaking he says what he
[33:53] says from God the bride will say the
[33:57] spirit and the profit of the bride will
[33:59] be saying the same thing and what they
[34:02] will say well had already been said in
[34:04] the word they are saying it now come out
[34:07] from a monitor now and he snickered
[34:09] they're saying it now is what he did
[34:11] they're saying it right now they're
[34:13] speaking the same thing the cry has go
[34:17] out the cry is going out how long with a
[34:20] voice cry we do not know but one thing
[34:22] we do know it won't be long for this is
[34:25] the last eight and then there's that
[34:27] quote that we're all for me with them
[34:29] I'm running out of time so a rattler
[34:31] it's just just a thing there in the
[34:33] beginning other people in the land who
[34:35] under their messenger will be the final
[34:38] voice to the final eight how is that
[34:41] possible because they're saying well the
[34:43] messenger saying they're not saying oh I
[34:46] believe God to a prophet and I'm not
[34:48] sure what is what he brought I'm not
[34:51] sure what the evidence of a new birth is
[34:54] and what the new birth day is or or how
[34:56] to get or what the cast stone is or even
[34:58] they you have to grow that there is such
[35:01] a thing that the statue of a perfect man
[35:03] or they have to come to adoption to body
[35:05] change or all these things but they they
[35:08] have an understanding of what this
[35:11] message is the bathroom
[35:12] [Applause]
[35:16] let me just get through this these talk
[35:21] about interpreting a message of being
[35:22] able to preach and this is the example
[35:24] that you gave aware how how do we know
[35:27] what to dislike what I will finish them
[35:28] in this life is pillar fire they came
[35:31] down accepting he told and he said then
[35:36] he talked about what that filter fire is
[35:38] about the body said then if you race
[35:39] through the dead here's his picture
[35:41] scientifically they into the same
[35:43] Pierce's works reveal that you the same
[35:46] but the reason you're looking at it and
[35:48] maybe compare that with a Bible to the
[35:51] reason you're looking at the bottom and
[35:53] looking for what the Bible say in their
[35:56] provider quote the reason you're looking
[35:58] at the call from an educated person like
[36:01] myself is bringing your message don't
[36:05] you look at the messages look at the
[36:07] message I'm talking about a man for the
[36:12] message is more than God's and a prophet
[36:14] the message is what's going to take us
[36:17] in Iraq
[36:31] [Music]
[36:36] [Music]
[36:40] that place
