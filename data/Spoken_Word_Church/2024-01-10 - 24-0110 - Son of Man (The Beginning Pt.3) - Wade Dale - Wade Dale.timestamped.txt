[1:58] amen
[2:25] yeah that's good
[2:28] yeah
[2:32] okay they got the Powerpoint projected
[2:33] that's good I don't know if it'll work
[2:34] all right but uh y'all just brothers
[2:36] Advance the slides with the lyrics of
[2:38] course uh we did this last year sometime
[2:41] somebody requested we do it again and
[2:42] sister Johnny asked us this past Sunday
[2:44] to do a special we didn't get to because
[2:46] we don't do specials in the morning she
[2:48] was asking for us to do it in the
[2:49] morning but anyway so this is dedicated
[2:51] to brother Dell and all the Dell family
[2:53] I'll say um from Sister Johnny and uh
[2:57] and this is kind of a testimony song
[2:59] it's U you'll see as as we go through
[3:02] the uh pictures here if they work a
[3:05] picture of YULA at about four years old
[3:07] when she was struggling with seizures
[3:08] and then me with the truck wreck I had
[3:10] around back at that time around 2015 or
[3:13] so uh that I was driving a tractor
[3:15] trailer and somebody pulled out in front
[3:16] of me Point Blank and nobody went to the
[3:19] hospital everybody survived the the lady
[3:21] and the little boy I hit them at 65
[3:22] miles an hour weighed 85,000 lbs and it
[3:26] wound up everybody was okay and that's a
[3:27] miracle uh the the Kentucky tornadoes
[3:30] that we were in up there a few years ago
[3:32] the tree in our yard that we called
[3:34] Goliath cuz it was threatening to fall
[3:35] in our house I spoke to it said fall the
[3:38] other way Gabby confessed it and it fell
[3:41] the other way away from our house and
[3:43] then of course all the testimony around
[3:44] ia's birth um when she was born with
[3:47] underdeveloped lungs and then of course
[3:50] Ava at four years old also with the
[3:52] seizures she was going through during
[3:54] that time so this song is about God
[3:56] delivering you and being with you when
[3:58] you're in those trials and the D family
[4:00] is in a trial God is with

[16:06] widowers and then when they're finished
[16:08] then y'all can get whatever you want

[20:07] John 1 verse one in the beginning was
[20:09] the word where was with God and the Word
[20:10] was God and that same word was in the
[20:13] beginning with God and we were talking
[20:14] about that uh Wednesday and we'll
[20:16] continue on that a little bit more
[20:19] tonight all things were made by this
[20:21] person and without him was not anything
[20:23] made that was made and the Word was made
[20:25] flesh all come down that great funnel
[20:29] all funnel down into that one man named
[20:32] Jesus Christ and then now through that
[20:34] one man Jesus Christ it's going to start
[20:36] going back to the other direction am man
[20:38] it'll be the expansion of God it'll be
[20:40] God that'll looks like The Hourglass
[20:42] coming down and then all of a sudden all
[20:43] the Sand's going to be down here well
[20:45] that Sand's in the bride all right the
[20:47] Holy Ghost is in the bride and the Word
[20:49] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[20:51] beheld his glory the glory the only
[20:52] begotten of the father full of grace and
[20:54] truth you can be
[20:55] seated you know we think sometimes we
[20:58] think well I'd have done it different
[21:01] have you ever said that before i' I I
[21:03] just do that different well you don't
[21:05] have to tell God that cuz he don't he
[21:07] can't even do it different right he did
[21:10] it one way he thought of it one way and
[21:12] he thought of it perfect when he thought
[21:14] of it so he doesn't have to have a
[21:16] second thought right and he don't have
[21:18] another thought
[21:20] coming this is his thought that's
[21:24] right and I like what brother um the Alo
[21:28] was talking about he he and I had
[21:30] preached that sermon down to brother
[21:31] Martin's and he had watched it online
[21:33] from from Honduras and about the U eth
[21:36] day and about us being translated I want
[21:38] to read this in
[21:40] Colossians giving thanks unto the Father
[21:42] which has made us meat to be partakers
[21:44] of the inheritance of the Saints and
[21:45] light who has delivered us from the
[21:48] power of Darkness so he's delivered us
[21:49] from something and hath translated that
[21:52] word translated means to look transfer
[21:54] remove from one place to another all
[21:57] right or of change of situation our
[22:01] place and the Bible tells us in here a
[22:03] few minutes with we where are we sitting
[22:05] tonight if we're born again we're
[22:06] sitting in Heavenly places in Christ
[22:09] Jesus your soul is in another dimension
[22:12] because it's Eternal it's perfect never
[22:14] had a bad day we got to realize that
[22:16] when you receive the new birth that's
[22:18] what you receive you receive God and you
[22:20] become deity just as he is deity but we
[22:24] just get a little portion of it where
[22:25] he's all knowing all powerful the only
[22:27] reason we're not all knowing and all
[22:29] powerful is we have a carnal mind and we
[22:31] have flu and we have that thing called a
[22:33] brain the greatest battle ever fought in
[22:35] what it's in your brain all right it's
[22:37] not your soul unless you're not born
[22:40] again if you're born again that fight's
[22:44] over but we sure have struggle in them
[22:46] other two all right out into our
[22:49] body now listen what Paul says and have
[22:52] translated us into the kingdom now I
[22:55] want to ask you a question is this the
[22:56] kingdom of God
[22:59] at this moment right now is this the
[23:01] kingdom of God no it's the kingdom of
[23:03] the
[23:05] devil this is Satan he's got he's got
[23:07] the he's a squatter he don't have the
[23:09] title but he's a squatter right this is
[23:12] his world to play with started in the
[23:14] Garden of Eden all the way to now amen
[23:17] but we're going to get it back but we're
[23:19] translated out of that as our brother
[23:21] was talking about we we are not in this
[23:25] we are not in this church age now if we
[23:27] were in this church age we'd be blind
[23:29] wretched miserable naked and not know it
[23:32] but since we are a part of the beginning
[23:34] of the creation of God or a continuation
[23:36] of that creation of God we have been
[23:38] translated out of this age all right now
[23:42] listen truly though the seventh Church
[23:44] age the seventh day last all the way to
[23:47] the end of the Millennium now remember
[23:50] that right but eternity has come here
[23:54] now we're not having to wait to Eternity
[23:57] right
[23:58] I listened to several preachers online
[24:00] and not from message preachers but but
[24:02] even the the the brother that was
[24:04] speaking the other Sunday when we went
[24:05] to that uh Baptist Church and and not
[24:08] speaking against them but they can only
[24:10] go so
[24:11] far Jesus is out
[24:14] there Jesus is sure he saved us and sure
[24:17] he John 3:16 us for God shall love the
[24:20] world he gave his only begotten son
[24:21] whosoever believe on him should not
[24:23] perish but have everlasting
[24:24] life but for you but for you to say I am
[24:28] part of Jesus and I am perfect they
[24:32] can't take that they can't take that but
[24:35] you and I it should be a common thing to
[24:37] say that and to be able to believe it
[24:39] not just say it and then what then what
[24:42] do we do the reason
[24:43] that the reason that they show who they
[24:46] are because they don't they still cut
[24:48] their hair they still wear pants they
[24:50] still you know they they good old
[24:52] Baptist he won't drink but he'll chew a
[24:53] little backer and and smoke so Donny
[24:55] knows that but then you got the
[24:57] Presbyterians that Dr so you got all the
[24:59] groups of denominations that there's a
[25:01] part somewhere they can't live the full
[25:03] word of
[25:04] God because they've not been what taught
[25:08] to live the full word of God you and I
[25:10] have been taught to live the full word
[25:12] of God all right and we're struggling
[25:14] and we're heading that way up the statue
[25:15] of perfect man unto Perfection but if
[25:17] you're born again today that thing
[25:19] inside of you is perfect
[25:22] right doesn't have any flaws at all so
[25:25] we got to believe that brother Bob he
[25:27] had translated us he's picked us out of
[25:30] this
[25:31] age because if we stay in this age we
[25:34] get all those damnable things wretched
[25:38] blind miserable naked and don't know it
[25:40] all these different things we've been
[25:42] translated into the kingdom of his dear
[25:45] son to transpose transfer remove from
[25:48] one place to another see the what I see
[25:51] that that the denominations they say
[25:52] well we're going to a place we're going
[25:54] to heaven we're going they don't know
[25:56] the Heaven's come here first that's they
[25:59] don't know that Christ has already come
[26:00] here
[26:01] first he's
[26:04] here in a group of people they can't
[26:07] take that they can take Jesus being
[26:09] their Savior and being on the cross do
[26:10] you understand that and they could be
[26:13] saved fish virsion or or giv eternal
[26:15] life but but to possess eternal life in
[26:18] their soul once you present this message
[26:20] to them they've got to come to it
[26:22] because this message is the soul of God
[26:24] for the end time amen and that's soul of
[26:28] God is transferred into you that way you
[26:29] can say amen back this way cuz there
[26:32] something inside of you Rings true that
[26:34] says that ain't nothing but the truth
[26:35] every service you ought to be like had
[26:37] it right that ain't nothing but the
[26:38] truth that ain't nothing but the truth
[26:40] that ain't nothing but the truth if you
[26:42] hear brother Brandon preach you say that
[26:43] ain't nothing but the
[26:45] truth
[26:47] amen and whom we have Redemption through
[26:49] his blood even the Forgiveness of sins
[26:51] so watch Paul he put us in
[26:54] heaven yeah I like Paul put us in heaven
[26:58] translated us then he brought us back
[27:00] and said we have
[27:03] sin even the Forgiveness of sins who is
[27:07] the image of the invisible God the
[27:09] firstborn of every creature remember God
[27:11] said you can't see my face you can't see
[27:13] me but I'm going to declare myself
[27:16] through this flesh called Jesus Christ
[27:18] for by him were all things created who
[27:21] who what who was a Creator the Son of
[27:22] God the logos they said let there be all
[27:25] right but that same one that said let
[27:27] there be became became a baby and cried
[27:30] in a Manger 2,000 years ago or we got
[27:33] two different
[27:35] people visible and invisible he created
[27:39] everything that we can see and can't
[27:41] see praise God whether they be Thrones
[27:44] dominions principalities or Powers all
[27:47] things were created by Him and for him
[27:49] like I said many times before we're
[27:51] either going to Bow and do obedience
[27:54] every day to God that knowing that he's
[27:57] our creator he's our King he's our
[27:58] sustainer or somebody that's never bowed
[28:01] that never going to Bow a knee uh some
[28:03] of the Great Men of the world that that
[28:05] don't care a thing about
[28:07] God they're going to Bow but they're
[28:09] going to have a look on their face a lot
[28:12] different than the look we have on our
[28:14] face as brother Joe kenned was say we
[28:16] need to let our face up we need to
[28:18] worship even if we have to worship with
[28:19] a bigger smile this year than we have
[28:21] before or live give a a a more
[28:24] resounding nod where he can just hear
[28:26] your neck pot
[28:33] praise the
[28:34] lord we should listen if if we if we're
[28:38] in a
[28:39] position everybody with me if we're in a
[28:42] position that this end time puts us in
[28:44] which is the position of the full word
[28:46] being open to us and us not be be where
[28:49] we go have a moment to say well I don't
[28:51] know what that is I don't know how to
[28:53] live now you should never as a as a
[28:55] Believer you should never have have a
[28:57] thought in your mind to say I wonder how
[29:00] to
[29:02] live don't get quiet you can't say that
[29:06] you've been taught by the message by the
[29:08] preachers of this message and and
[29:10] brother brandom you've been taught
[29:12] there's if you got a problem there's two
[29:14] big books called Condor and Doctrine go
[29:16] read
[29:17] those that'll give you everything you
[29:19] need as far as setting in order as we
[29:21] were talking downstairs about the
[29:22] difference in a bride and a church but a
[29:25] church has to be set up a church has to
[29:26] have a Foundation a church has to have
[29:29] leaders all
[29:32] right and he is before all things and by
[29:35] him all things consist and he is the
[29:37] head of the body of the church which is
[29:38] us the beginning the first who is the
[29:40] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[29:42] going back to Revelations 3:14 the
[29:44] beginning of the creation of God that in
[29:46] all things what he might have the
[29:47] preeminence for it pleased the father
[29:50] that in him should all fullness dwell
[29:53] now we were talking about it downstairs
[29:56] it was a question asked and we we'll
[29:57] cover it one more time that way if
[29:59] there's a question in your mind cu the
[30:01] question was is they couldn't understand
[30:03] how
[30:04] Adam uh in other
[30:07] words if you look at it one way it it
[30:10] looks like Adam you know the body was
[30:13] created and then God just breathed
[30:15] eternal life in
[30:17] him that's not what happened that's
[30:20] right right
[30:21] exactly if not that's the way we'd have
[30:23] to
[30:24] be now now listen Adam didn't have a
[30:29] choice because he was a god of the earth
[30:31] God set him up that
[30:33] way amen that was the first part of him
[30:36] that was his first son that was a Son of
[30:38] God the Bible tells you
[30:40] that
[30:42] amen a many
[30:44] Creator move stuff around right and and
[30:49] he was all over the whole world he
[30:51] wasn't just in one little spot called
[30:53] Eden sure he was in Eden when he got put
[30:55] in flesh but when he was ruling the
[30:57] animals and all it's like brother R said
[30:58] it's like the Holy Spirit he was just
[31:01] everywhere hard to understand but that's
[31:03] exactly the way it was but God wanted
[31:05] him though to go into one spot called a
[31:07] garden cuz guess what that's where me
[31:09] and you are
[31:10] going right remember the circle you got
[31:12] to have a full
[31:15] circle we fell so the circle got to come
[31:18] back around put us back in the Garden
[31:19] Eden in human flesh with Jesus Christ
[31:22] walking around with us seeing us face to
[31:26] face and living with each other
[31:29] for
[31:31] eternity praise
[31:32] God but Adam was not that way at first
[31:35] because remember if you look at Genesis
[31:37] 2:7 and what brother randam talks about
[31:39] and I'll get to it in just a minute
[31:42] where brother Ram talks and he he says
[31:43] talks about animal life well that's what
[31:45] you and I are in this we're animal life
[31:47] and we get a
[31:49] breath all
[31:51] right now remember we're going to talk
[31:53] about born by the Breath of God which is
[31:56] the bride and that's the new birth our
[31:59] eternal life not not not and we suck it
[32:03] down our nostrils no it's just it's just
[32:05] a metaphor right because he had to do
[32:08] something all right to get this Holy
[32:11] Ghost Inside of us he had to do
[32:12] something right Genesis 2:7 said the
[32:15] Lord God formed man of the Dust of the
[32:18] ground and breathe into his nostrils the
[32:20] breath of life now watch it says stop
[32:23] there that semicolon stop and Man became
[32:26] a living soul we'll look at that because
[32:28] that looks like that's what he breathed
[32:30] but no Adam was a living breathing human
[32:32] being before God breathed eternal life
[32:33] into his body we'll see that in just a
[32:37] minute don't get quiet on me brother
[32:39] Dale has been preaching this for 50
[32:40] years if you don't believe it you need
[32:42] to go talk to
[32:43] him John 20: 21 said then said Jesus to
[32:47] them again peace be unto you as my
[32:49] father has sent me even so send I you
[32:53] and when he had said this he breathed on
[32:54] them I want to ask you a question did
[32:56] God breathe the breath of eternal life
[32:57] in you when you was a
[33:03] baby okay then you were breathing human
[33:07] being before you got born again Adam was
[33:11] a breathing human being before he got
[33:13] eternal life put in his
[33:16] soul okay we we'll explain it because
[33:18] brother R really if you look at one word
[33:21] he says you'll see where he separated
[33:23] both of them peace be unto you as my
[33:25] father has sent me so in I you and when
[33:27] he had said this he breathed on them and
[33:30] said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost
[33:32] now now listen they didn't even receive
[33:34] it then they just kept breathing regular
[33:36] human
[33:37] life amen they didn't get the new birth
[33:40] till 50 days later at pent Pentacost
[33:44] then he breathed eternal life into their
[33:46] nostrils he breathed life into their
[33:48] nostrils when they became a baby right
[33:51] but he breathed the breath of eternal
[33:53] life in them when they accepted it on
[33:54] the day of Pentecost right amen amen
[33:57] whosoever sins you remit they are
[33:58] remitted and whosoever sins you retain
[34:02] they are
[34:04] retained Blasphemous names brother Brown
[34:07] says church is the mystical Body of
[34:08] Christ born of the Breath of God now
[34:10] he's talking about a different kind of
[34:11] breath because this is not the breath
[34:13] when everybody gets born as a baby all
[34:14] right everybody with me all right did
[34:17] you get it congregation says amen the
[34:19] Church of God is born of the Breath of
[34:21] God God breathed into the nostrils look
[34:25] spiritually
[34:28] all right so that means he had to have a
[34:29] natural breath to begin
[34:30] with this is a spiritual happening right
[34:33] here watch what brother R said God
[34:36] breathed into the nostrils spiritually
[34:38] of
[34:40] Adam not naturally spiritually of Adam
[34:44] and he became a living Soul did you know
[34:46] the Pentecostals or the true Pentecostal
[34:48] church is born of the Breath of God all
[34:51] right then we talked about the logos
[34:52] what is the logos it is a the definition
[34:55] is to appeal to the audience in other
[34:57] words something that that is a that you
[35:00] can see but you can't see you see what
[35:03] it
[35:04] does everybody with me Loos created
[35:08] everything he God had to come down from
[35:09] all this big funnel he had to go down a
[35:11] little bit to logos where you and you
[35:13] and me can you and me can understand
[35:15] somebody standing out I don't know what
[35:16] he was standing on but he was standing
[35:18] there going let there be a world let
[35:20] there be a moon let there be a star and
[35:22] then he just kept thinking well now he
[35:24] had those thoughts if he was eternal
[35:28] come on if he was
[35:30] eternal they were in his thoughts to
[35:32] begin with I don't know how long ago
[35:34] before he made
[35:35] them but he had to come to logos or
[35:39] speech to speak
[35:42] it right it's way with me and
[35:46] you you don't speak something you you
[35:49] don't we formulate a lot of things in
[35:51] our
[35:52] head and it could be we could pick up
[35:56] the thoughts of
[35:59] God huh but what if we never say a word
[36:03] what now brother Bob he he gets the word
[36:05] of God the word of God comes oh he gets
[36:07] a sermon and he stands up here and
[36:16] goes let's stand and
[36:20] dismiss what' you get you didn't get
[36:23] what he was
[36:25] thinking so we didn't get what God was
[36:27] thinking until he what lust it or spoke
[36:29] it so that we can understand it then I
[36:32] can understand a an eternal God that can
[36:35] bring himself down to a place to where
[36:36] he can say let there be
[36:39] light and then that form be something
[36:42] that even steps a little further as
[36:43] brother R says into a theophany or a
[36:48] body so that we can really understand
[36:50] who he is cuz remember he's our daddy
[36:54] and for him to declare us to be him
[36:56] human beings he had to be
[37:00] one right a puppy dog of course a puppy
[37:03] dog don't have a soul but if puppy dog
[37:05] could look back and see a dog he'd say I
[37:08] look like that so that's my
[37:11] daddy that's the way we do we have but
[37:13] we have a soul so we can look back and
[37:15] say that's my
[37:18] father Adam could look back and say
[37:20] that's my
[37:21] father cuz he was made in His image he
[37:23] was made a human so that theophany is is
[37:27] a manifestation of a deity all right
[37:30] Theo Phan the god uh Phan which is to
[37:34] appear so it's where we can see him
[37:36] there was because remember when he
[37:38] walked in the cool of the day with Adam
[37:40] he appeared he was there he had some
[37:43] sort of substance in him that wasn't
[37:46] like Casper the Friendly Ghost where you
[37:47] can see through him and he just kind of
[37:49] floats over here and he kind of floats
[37:50] over here and this Cloud didn't come
[37:52] down and talk to
[37:54] Adam God came down and talk to
[37:59] Adam face to face cuz there was no sin
[38:03] there was no sin barrier now there's a
[38:06] sin barrier that's why that's why Moses
[38:08] we read the read it last week where
[38:10] Moses he said Moses you can't see my
[38:11] face but now I'll let you see my back
[38:13] part now it wasn't a dog cat or a camel
[38:16] it was a what human back which was a
[38:20] theophany that brother brandham said
[38:22] that was
[38:24] Jesus theophany that became flesh over
[38:27] here all right everybody with
[38:29] me the deity of Jesus Christ
[38:33] look just like this space here then he
[38:35] gathered it up into logos then he came
[38:38] from the logos down to Christ you say
[38:40] brother way why are you backing up
[38:42] listen we've got to this is we're
[38:44] talking about that head
[38:46] guy so we got to really understand that
[38:49] head guy before we Step Into The
[38:50] Headstone cuz remember the whole world
[38:53] rejected
[38:54] him when he was on Earth in human flesh
[38:57] the way he was supposed to be the
[38:59] beginning of the creation of God they
[39:02] hated him yeah they literally hated him
[39:06] so bad they killed him and I'm talking
[39:07] about the religious people I ain't
[39:08] talking about the bums and the
[39:11] murderers cuz the thief looked at him
[39:13] one day and said I know I know that hey
[39:16] hey buddy shut up this guy right here's
[39:18] done no wrong now how do you get that
[39:19] revealed to him he never seen him in his
[39:24] Circle he never seen he saw the other
[39:26] guy Circle cuz they were both thieves
[39:28] but he didn't see Jesus in their Circle
[39:30] he said in other words he down inside he
[39:32] was saying hey shut up I've seen this
[39:34] guy at church more than you've
[39:36] been don't throw
[39:39] things then he came from logos down into
[39:42] Christ it's just God coming down like
[39:44] this to what to the Earth then going
[39:46] right back into God again don't you see
[39:48] what I mean just revolving coming down
[39:50] from space from eternity rolling
[39:52] together coming down into the logos and
[39:55] the logos down into man then returning
[39:57] right back again for one purpose look to
[39:59] redeem that man that had fallen he came
[40:01] down here to picked us
[40:03] up now that's what he came for to be a
[40:05] redeemer and before God could be a
[40:07] redeemer he had to be according to the
[40:09] law a kinsman redeemer he had to be
[40:11] Kinfolk to us that's why MDC was God
[40:15] Almighty but he wasn't our savior right
[40:18] he was the king of Salem the king of
[40:20] Peace he had no beginning and had no
[40:22] ending right no father or
[40:25] mother it was God they just poured a
[40:28] little human flesh on top of him and
[40:30] appeared to Abraham but listen a
[40:32] prefigure to what we're seeing the son
[40:34] of man
[40:36] now where in us that's
[40:40] right excuse me the resurrection of
[40:42] Lazar
[40:44] 1951 now look he might have give a hand
[40:47] like a monkey he's talking about our
[40:48] he's talking about our physical body
[40:50] might give him a face like a chimpanzee
[40:52] might give him a foot like a bear but
[40:53] God put a soul in a man and we were
[40:57] talking if you weren't here last
[40:58] Saturday at Bible study shame on you but
[41:01] we really covered a soul and what it was
[41:04] and what happened and all those things I
[41:06] thought it was really we I got something
[41:08] more out of it just sitting there
[41:09] talking about it but this white cloud
[41:12] deity came down not in the animal in the
[41:15] man and now if you want to go back and
[41:17] dig up some bones let them dig up all
[41:19] the bones they want to that don't have
[41:21] one thing to do with the word of
[41:23] God then here's this man and now the man
[41:26] sinned and when he sinned he fell then
[41:28] that little cloud in there became marred
[41:30] in Black he didn't say he done away with
[41:32] it listen Adam did not lose eternal life
[41:36] in his
[41:37] soul God can't give you eternal life and
[41:39] then take it back away from you remember
[41:41] God don't make a mistake so if he
[41:44] breathe spiritually brother R say
[41:46] spiritually he breathed eternal life
[41:47] into Adam he became a Eternal person
[41:50] with God I'll read that here in just a
[41:51] minute so God couldn't take that away he
[41:54] lost the ability
[41:57] to become Eternal in his
[42:03] body because what are we going back to
[42:05] Eternity in a human
[42:07] body then the L God came down was made
[42:10] flesh and dwelt among us to redeem this
[42:11] man back to the love of the father and
[42:14] he came in by the baptism of the Holy
[42:16] Spirit Chase sin out of the human praise
[42:19] God and brings man back again into
[42:22] fellowship with God questions and
[42:25] answers 1953
[42:27] he what did he make he made a spirit man
[42:28] if you'll notice after he made all the
[42:30] creation created a spirit man now look
[42:32] he created all creation then he created
[42:34] a spirit
[42:35] man theophany uh Genesis 126 man is
[42:39] everybody with me not in flesh yet
[42:43] that's genesis
[42:44] 2:7 created a spirit man the close
[42:46] reading of this now to the one that
[42:47] asked the question we find this that God
[42:50] gave Dominion of the cattle and the fish
[42:51] and everything to that man but in his
[42:54] making up there he made him in his own
[42:57] image to lead the
[42:59] cattle lead the Beast of the field just
[43:01] like the Holy Spirit leads the believer
[43:03] today see he was in other words Adam the
[43:05] first man in the lower creations of God
[43:09] the first creation was God
[43:12] himself what is create create doesn't
[43:15] have to be nothing to something it it
[43:17] means to be formed all
[43:20] right cuz listen you and I when we
[43:23] receive the new birth God does he listen
[43:26] he
[43:30] burns tears
[43:33] out
[43:35] kills
[43:37] nature changes your
[43:40] thought changes your ideas I hope
[43:44] changes the way we are changes the way
[43:47] we dress come on somebody changes the
[43:49] way we where we
[43:50] go and you're still in the same thing
[43:52] you sinned
[43:55] in
[43:56] yeah beer Bible that's what it was this
[44:00] held a beer I didn't have to cut my hand
[44:01] off and put a Bible hand
[44:05] on you can laugh if you want to but
[44:07] that's what God did that's right that's
[44:09] why folks this is a mystery that's why
[44:11] Jesus was a
[44:12] mystery he was a mystery of God revealed
[44:15] and you and I are part of that mystery
[44:17] according to amen Christ is a mystery
[44:20] God revealed he was the mystery of God
[44:22] and you and I are part of that mystery
[44:24] of God how that we walk in this world
[44:27] how that we can talk different act
[44:29] different even our thought processes are
[44:32] different and bur in the same shell
[44:34] though and we have oh oh shoot wait a
[44:37] minute we don't have problems when we
[44:38] get born again
[44:43] right how many of you got to do your
[44:45] taxes in
[44:49] April that'll humanize you as much as
[44:51] anything in the
[44:52] world is having to pay them taxes oh
[44:55] some of you get them back but I like to
[44:57] have mine during the year I don't want
[45:00] the government to keep
[45:01] mine praise the Lord
[45:04] anyhow but what am I saying this is the
[45:07] greatest mystery that ever hit the face
[45:09] of the Earth was that God can live
[45:11] inside of you Eternal person God live
[45:14] inside of you make you an eternal person
[45:16] with God and nobody can see
[45:19] except what you declare that's right now

[50:01] they'll see we really changed by then
[50:04] gray fat ugly yeah
[50:10] hey but that's life and this is life
[50:13] what we're living if you haven't been
[50:14] changed like that listen we have
[50:18] struggles come on that old me wanted to
[50:21] pull out there and dance and wanted to
[50:23] drink I'm just being honest wanted to do
[50:26] that some part of me said
[50:30] hey hey you used to be comfortable doing
[50:33] this what's wrong with you boy I said
[50:37] you ain't my boy no more that's what's
[50:38] wrong with me right and I ain't your boy
[50:41] no
[50:42] more I'm God boy now don't clap for me
[50:47] clap for God cuz like I said before I
[50:49] failed a million times since then but
[50:52] there's one thing for
[50:54] sure if you got the new birth if
[50:56] somebody hadn't seen you in
[50:59] years and they come around and they
[51:02] don't see a difference in you you got a
[51:05] problem you got a problem a real big
[51:09] one because how is the only way God
[51:13] showed who he was through Jesus was his
[51:16] Works
[51:18] am and
[51:21] listen Works can put you in hell but if
[51:25] it's works if it's a mechanics and the
[51:27] Dynamics together that's God we'll read
[51:31] that if we get to it in just a
[51:33] minute okay he wasn't an angel he came
[51:37] on Earth and took the form of a bondsman
[51:39] not an angel came down in the great
[51:42] Jehovah Glory but he came down he didn't
[51:44] he came down as a man to redeem man to
[51:46] die for man to die for as a man he never
[51:49] died as God he died as a man now listen
[51:53] God can't die right Jesus didn't die
[51:56] that's right sure he died for us but
[52:00] what he done was is that that shell of
[52:03] his was the example his soul went to
[52:10] hell that body did Lay cold and dead in
[52:13] the grave there was no life in it at all
[52:16] right but on the third
[52:19] day he picked that body back up
[52:22] quickened it made it alive and turned it
[52:24] back into a young man
[52:25] amen but he died as a man the sin of man
[52:28] was upon the son of man and he had to
[52:30] become a man in order to pay the penalty
[52:33] 1957 this is Brother brand this is his
[52:35] statement this is my statement I believe
[52:37] that Jesus is the son of God I believe
[52:39] in his body he was a man sure he bled he
[52:44] hungered he was born of a woman just
[52:46] like I was but his blood was not of a
[52:49] woman it was of God and Jehovah God the
[52:51] logos who brooded over the Earth in my
[52:53] message this morning brooded the first
[52:55] man Man Out of the Dust of the earth
[52:56] overshadowed Mary rooted over her to
[52:58] fulfill his word and created the blood
[53:01] cell listen we have
[53:03] to we have to have an act to make a
[53:06] blood we have to have an act to put the
[53:07] blood cell where it's supposed to go is
[53:08] everybody with me that didn't happen
[53:10] that's the way he's a creation beginning
[53:12] of the creation of God that's the way it
[53:14] should have been in the Garden of
[53:19] Eden and created the blood cell that
[53:21] brought forth the son of the Living God
[53:22] I believe in a body he was a man I
[53:24] believe in his soul he was God he was
[53:27] God's manifestation here on Earth God
[53:30] was in Christ reconciling him the world
[53:32] to himself I believe that he was not
[53:34] just a mere man though look now watch
[53:36] neither was he a prophet he was God
[53:38] Emmanuel I believe with all my heart
[53:41] that being true I can't prove it if I
[53:43] could then it wouldn't be a
[53:45] faith in the beginning was a spirit and
[53:47] all the P Fountain of goodness and mercy
[53:49] and power and all the good things of God
[53:50] God was the center of that Fountain and
[53:52] then the low God that went out of God in
[53:54] the beginning became what we called a
[53:56] theophany or Supernatural body now we
[53:58] just explained that all right I just
[54:00] want you to know that this brother Brown
[54:02] believed it too God's not just like the
[54:05] air he's in a body now the great mystery
[54:08] is though he can be in me and you right
[54:10] now being in somebody in China and Egypt
[54:13] Honduras right now the same person he
[54:16] can move like that me and you can't
[54:18] because we have what we have been
[54:20] encapsulated in this thing that's why I
[54:22] can't go through that wall but if I were
[54:24] to pass away right now my soul would go
[54:26] right through into another dimension but
[54:28] my body couldn't it' have to stay here
[54:29] because of sin that's why Jesus's body
[54:32] had to stay here he was born in sin but
[54:35] he took on our sin right amen right and
[54:38] we beheld him the only begotten of the
[54:39] father who's that
[54:42] Christ then here he talks to Moses Moses
[54:45] said I want to see you he said I make
[54:47] all my goodness pass before thee and I
[54:49] will proclaim the name of the Lord
[54:50] before thee he said thou can't see my
[54:53] face for there should no man see me and
[54:55] live now remember that same guy looked
[54:57] at the
[54:58] disciples several years
[55:01] later why he come as a
[55:03] redeemer he wasn't coming as a redeemer
[55:06] right
[55:07] here he was the Redeemer it was inside
[55:10] of him but that wasn't human flesh just
[55:12] like MDC MDC was almighty God and it was
[55:16] Jesus inside but it wasn't Jesus the
[55:19] flesh melaz wasn't our
[55:22] brother he just slowed down into this
[55:25] Dimension as Aaron said throw some 16
[55:27] elements and it just kind of molded
[55:28] around him he talked to Abraham and when
[55:31] he walked out of Abraham's sight he
[55:33] disappeared right right just a pile of
[55:36] sand about that high pro probably when
[55:38] he went over into another dimension
[55:40] that's my God he's a Creator why can't
[55:43] he do
[55:44] that and I will take away mine hand and
[55:47] thou shalt see my back part by my face
[55:49] shall not be seen now he never said that
[55:51] to
[55:52] Adam until the fall then he then he went
[55:55] looking for
[55:56] Adam and then there was that Chasm then
[55:59] John 3 I mean Genesis 3 put that Chasm
[56:02] there he said but I'm going to come back
[56:04] right all right John 1 ver8 no man has
[56:07] seen God at any time the only begotten
[56:09] son which is in the bosom of the father
[56:12] he hath declared him all right now watch
[56:15] this word
[56:16] declared to lead out be leader now
[56:19] listen he's talking about Jesus standing
[56:21] in on Earth everybody with me right cuzz
[56:24] that was God right but it was God inside
[56:27] of him all right and he's declaring who
[56:31] he is he said show me where the
[56:33] scriptures I don't fulfill the
[56:35] scriptures show me where I don't do what
[56:37] the Old Testament said I would do show
[56:40] me and they couldn't show him that's we
[56:41] got
[56:42] Moses we got our
[56:47] quotebook watch this right here to
[56:49] unfold a teaching see they he declared
[56:54] God so clear that me and you understand
[56:57] that
[56:57] now they didn't understand it
[57:01] then
[57:04] right look to
[57:07] unfold the things related to God also
[57:11] used in Greek writing of the
[57:12] interpretation of things sacred and
[57:14] divine oracles dreams Etc so what did
[57:17] God do God went into a human body and
[57:20] and then Jesus declared who he
[57:22] was you and I
[57:25] just like I said before you'll declare
[57:27] who's inside of you I'll promise you
[57:29] that cuz the real you is the one you
[57:31] fight all the time all
[57:34] right one way or the
[57:36] other now brother Brandon I just this
[57:40] part is is where he's talking about
[57:41] father son Holy Ghost is hatched out of
[57:44] hell that's why the son of man never
[57:47] taught these things when he was standing
[57:49] on Earth that three and a half years of
[57:51] ministry on Earth he did not make a
[57:53] mistake with his
[58:01] teaching now he might have call Thursday
[58:04] Tuesday like us that do we get
[58:07] older but when he was
[58:10] talking when he was preaching when he
[58:12] was teaching when they wrote it down
[58:14] when the Holy Ghost told them to wrote
[58:16] it write it down because they couple of
[58:18] those weren't there when he was alive I
[58:19] mean when he was with Paul wasn't there
[58:22] Luke wasn't there Luke was with Paul
[58:25] but they have a clear understanding
[58:27] because the Holy Ghost said hey just
[58:29] like brother brandham when brother Bram
[58:30] sat there on spoken word's Original Seed
[58:33] he said he said the holy spirit said
[58:35] pick up your pen and
[58:37] write amen now believe you me whatever
[58:40] he wrote from there to where he finished
[58:42] that was God writing it well I believe
[58:44] he was all the way but I believe that is
[58:46] he was telling us this is what I'm
[58:47] telling you right here cuz I believe on
[58:50] spark word's Original Seed that's where
[58:52] everything
[58:53] turned and he focused stand on that son
[58:55] of
[58:56] man cuz after that come the seals and
[58:59] all the different the great powerful
[59:00] messages they'
[59:02] preached but father son Holy Ghost is
[59:04] hatched Out of Hell trinitarianism
[59:07] hatched Out of Hell three unclean
[59:09] spirits like frogs every false Doctrine
[59:12] did not come from heaven right every
[59:15] false Doctrine come from
[59:18] hell so the son of man as brother Ry
[59:21] many times we'll read it later on but
[59:23] not tonight many times he said the same
[59:26] message that Jesus preached the same
[59:28] message the son of man it was the son
[59:30] this is the son of man now didn't they
[59:32] say brother I made mistakes yeah
[59:35] 4,400 but when he was preaching it was
[59:38] God preaching to
[59:39] us they could not hold it for that past
[59:42] that 50th day cuz that was the day of
[59:44] Jubilee when everything went back to its
[59:46] original beginning the power was God
[59:48] power of God was taken back to its
[59:50] original look what happened on the day
[59:52] of Pentecost see it got took back right
[59:54] that original lion l i o n That Lion
[59:57] spirit that that first combat Beast l i
[1:00:00] o n not lying lion the Bold listen there
[1:00:05] was not a Baptist Church on every
[1:00:07] corner there wasn't a Methodist Church
[1:00:09] on every corner they preached one God
[1:00:13] they preached water baptism in the name
[1:00:14] of the Lord Jesus Christ they preached
[1:00:17] Holiness they preached all these
[1:00:18] different things then when man kept
[1:00:21] coming and getting into it and tearing
[1:00:22] it apart that's what made it into
[1:00:24] denominations so during right there on
[1:00:27] the 50th the original that was the
[1:00:28] Jubilee it set man
[1:00:30] free if they would accept it listen as
[1:00:33] the brother said and I said many times
[1:00:35] before if you don't listen to what God's
[1:00:37] got he's going to bore you through your
[1:00:40] ear amen with an awe amen that's right
[1:00:46] and you might be able to hear that train
[1:00:48] go down that
[1:00:49] track you might be able to hear the
[1:00:52] birds and the Thunder and the lightning
[1:00:56] but you'll never hear the voice of God
[1:00:58] again right cuz you sealed yourself away
[1:01:02] you have turned down the acceptable year
[1:01:05] of the Lord amen that's
[1:01:08] right CU All Things Go
[1:01:11] free Matthew 28:18 Jesus said all power
[1:01:15] is given unto me in heaven and in Earth
[1:01:17] that's when he stepped out of the Tomb
[1:01:18] brother Brown now continue with that
[1:01:20] same quote I kind of stuck that in
[1:01:22] there'll come another Year of Jubilee
[1:01:25] all right remember the Alpha and Omega
[1:01:28] those two
[1:01:30] Brides right all right so that's why
[1:01:32] that there had to be a turning back from
[1:01:35] the from what we're doing now now not
[1:01:37] now but denominationalism back to the
[1:01:40] faith of the
[1:01:41] fathers right and that's what brother R
[1:01:44] did he came to T to Loose Ends he came
[1:01:46] to present what the disciples presented
[1:01:49] in the ad 30 40 50 60 70 80 90
[1:01:55] then when you go to 8300 that's when it
[1:01:57] starts being cut back right the cord
[1:02:00] starts being
[1:02:01] cut well we think it's this well we
[1:02:04] think it's this we think he was a light
[1:02:06] substance of
[1:02:07] God then they come from a what a saying
[1:02:10] to a deed to a Doctrine we'll cover that
[1:02:12] in the seals when we when we get to The
[1:02:14] Headstone up here we're going to have to
[1:02:15] talk about seals cuz that's what it is
[1:02:17] right amen but if you'll notice
[1:02:19] Pentecost has been falling in America
[1:02:21] for about 50 years somewhere on that
[1:02:23] just about 50 years Pentecost began to
[1:02:25] fall now what's happening the church is
[1:02:28] receiving the seven steel book of the
[1:02:30] revelation of Jesus Christ what happened
[1:02:31] is they turned it
[1:02:34] down and not one tenth of them can
[1:02:38] receive
[1:02:41] it he's talking about
[1:02:43] Pentecostal not one tenth of them can
[1:02:45] receive it but when you begin to see the
[1:02:48] Year of
[1:02:50] Jubilee when you amen no know that we
[1:02:54] can go free when we know that we know
[1:02:57] that we know we've heard the trumpet
[1:03:01] sound where we don't have to fuss and
[1:03:04] strain and pull but we're already
[1:03:06] secured in Christ we already have a name
[1:03:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ in baptism
[1:03:10] what's he saying we've writed all the
[1:03:13] wrongs we have all these great Mysteries
[1:03:16] that we're going to bring up in these
[1:03:17] Seven Seals and prove to you that them
[1:03:20] was the seals that were sealed from the
[1:03:22] eyes of the
[1:03:23] people
[1:03:24] that's why they had false Doctrine in
[1:03:26] the second age third age and all the way
[1:03:28] up to now cuz the book wasn't open the
[1:03:30] book was sealed until the time of the
[1:03:33] end it would have opened then but God
[1:03:35] said seal it till the time of the
[1:03:38] end this is the end time God can't go
[1:03:41] past his
[1:03:43] word had to bring all those Church ages
[1:03:45] up had to let them fall had to let them
[1:03:48] you got to name that you're
[1:03:51] dead I hate you because you you take out
[1:03:54] that Jezebel spirit I'm reading in
[1:03:57] Revelations 1 if you don't mind one and
[1:03:59] two because it's the it's what God Said
[1:04:02] to the church ages you've lost your
[1:04:04] first love got a name you're living but
[1:04:07] you're
[1:04:11] dead we have all these great Mysteries
[1:04:14] that we're going to bring up in the
[1:04:14] seals and prove to you that was the
[1:04:16] seals that were sealed from the eyes of
[1:04:17] the people of God being my helper I'll
[1:04:20] prove to you that they could not see
[1:04:22] that by the Bible if they would have
[1:04:24] seen it like brother brandham saw it and
[1:04:27] revealed it to us they' have never had
[1:04:30] they never went to NAA if they' went to
[1:04:32] n they got it
[1:04:35] correct I'll prove to you they could not
[1:04:37] see that by the Bible then sure if the
[1:04:39] Bible said so you'll believe it that
[1:04:42] they could not see nothing but Father
[1:04:44] Son and Holy Ghost until this
[1:04:47] time listen if he didn't then Luther's
[1:04:50] gone Wesley's gone Pentecost is
[1:04:53] gone
[1:04:55] right but God winked at their ignorance
[1:04:57] you know why cuz he waited he had
[1:04:59] patience to wait till me and you got
[1:05:01] here right not just a prophet you and me
[1:05:05] got here if brother brand would Hey
[1:05:07] Brother BR 1100 sermons right we believe
[1:05:11] that was a mind of God talking to us
[1:05:13] right is that right somebody say amen
[1:05:15] amen what if he stood up just like I
[1:05:17] said Bible would
[1:05:21] do let's say only believe and dismiss
[1:05:25] no he gave us 1,00
[1:05:28] sermons that he give us now 60 years to
[1:05:33] get those sermons
[1:05:38] right and only again brother John a
[1:05:41] tenth of the people in this whole nation
[1:05:43] even knows who William brandham is I
[1:05:47] think about all those cities I go
[1:05:48] through now I don't know I'm just saying
[1:05:51] I have looked and tried to find message
[1:05:53] churches on the way like when I go to
[1:05:54] Illinois I go to Chattanooga I don't
[1:05:56] know anyone in
[1:05:58] Chattanooga Nashville biggest city as it
[1:06:00] is uh Brother Joseph Hamed's in Mur in
[1:06:03] Murphy's Boro and brother siler's in um
[1:06:09] Manchester then you go on up to
[1:06:11] Clarksville Tennessee big city now you
[1:06:13] got brother Bor in Hopkinsville but
[1:06:16] Paduka is a great big town great big
[1:06:17] city beautiful city far as I know they
[1:06:21] ain't a Believer there then you go on up
[1:06:23] to my where where I hunt there marry in
[1:06:25] Illinois and I tried to find I I tried
[1:06:27] to find somebody and there's nobody
[1:06:29] there never heard of William
[1:06:32] Brandon never heard of
[1:06:35] him sad right you better know yourself
[1:06:38] as you're
[1:06:40] fortunate that God spoke to you and gave
[1:06:43] you even just an opportunity to press
[1:06:49] play If The Press Play people would do
[1:06:53] that go into a city where brother
[1:06:55] Brown's voice has never been heard and
[1:06:57] stand on the corner and press play I pay
[1:06:59] for
[1:07:01] it but don't come into this church and
[1:07:03] try to do it don't come into a church
[1:07:06] that believes in a five-fold Ministry
[1:07:07] and try to do it don't put that down my
[1:07:10] throat yours either but there is a place
[1:07:13] for
[1:07:15] it everybody all
[1:07:17] right Revelations 3:14 says unto the
[1:07:20] angel the Church of lay out of sins
[1:07:21] that's us these things sayith the amen
[1:07:24] the faithful and true witness the
[1:07:25] beginning of the creation of God now
[1:07:28] remember God was what his first creation
[1:07:30] was God himself which is the Son of God
[1:07:33] the lust which is a lower form of the
[1:07:35] same man so that we can understand him
[1:07:38] no man has seen God at any time I'm
[1:07:40] going to say no man has understood God
[1:07:41] at any time how can you understand
[1:07:43] somebody's never had a beginning how can
[1:07:45] you understand somebody that can be here
[1:07:47] on Mars Venus
[1:07:51] China at the same time
[1:07:57] see there you're
[1:07:59] silent but I know that God and you know
[1:08:02] that God because he's declared himself
[1:08:04] to us that he can be the holy spirit
[1:08:06] inside of me and inside of you and
[1:08:08] inside of the person in China and the
[1:08:09] Philippines and all the different places
[1:08:11] right that is God that can move that
[1:08:14] that moves faster than the speed of
[1:08:18] light now Jesus is the beginning of the
[1:08:21] creation of God Revelations 1 I didn't
[1:08:23] even where brother BR said he's the
[1:08:25] beginning and where the continuation
[1:08:26] we'll get to that in a little bit later
[1:08:28] is that right then when was God created
[1:08:31] he is the beginning of the creation of
[1:08:33] God and God is eternal is that right but
[1:08:35] when God was created when a little baby
[1:08:37] that was conceived in the womb of a
[1:08:38] mother a virgin and she began to develop
[1:08:41] these cells within her to bring forth
[1:08:43] this little baby that was the beginning
[1:08:46] of God's
[1:08:48] creation right for God was made flesh
[1:08:50] and dwelt Among Us and became Emmanuel
[1:08:52] God With Us the beginning of the
[1:08:54] creation of
[1:08:56] God in him dwelt Eternal
[1:09:01] Light all right there was no darkness in
[1:09:03] this man at all all right that's what I
[1:09:07] have to believe I have to believe he is
[1:09:09] the sinless one but he took on my
[1:09:11] sin because you know what God judged
[1:09:17] him if he's in you he can't judge
[1:09:21] you that's why we already been to Hell
[1:09:24] if we got the person who went to hell in
[1:09:25] us that that conquered Hell In The Grave
[1:09:28] we got him in us someday we're going to
[1:09:30] realize that and we're all going to go
[1:09:33] to the
[1:09:35] Grave there were just reflecting the
[1:09:38] light of one Perfect Light and there he
[1:09:39] was the perfect light of God beginning
[1:09:42] of the creation of God God perfecting
[1:09:45] him Church perfecting his church God
[1:09:46] himself came down into a blood cell and
[1:09:49] WRA the blood around him the blood cell
[1:09:50] The Germ of Life Of God himself wrapped
[1:09:52] in this blood cell that brought forth
[1:09:53] the son Christ Jesus now look what he
[1:09:57] did what he did does by that to make you
[1:09:59] perfect and bring you back into
[1:10:00] Fellowship he brings you through that
[1:10:02] blood
[1:10:05] cell into
[1:10:07] himself you get it through the blood
[1:10:09] cell of the Lord Jesus that enveil the
[1:10:12] life of Jehovah and we coming through
[1:10:14] the blood cell becomes a part of that
[1:10:17] life so deity itself lays in the man
[1:10:20] that's received the Holy Spirit you are
[1:10:22] a son I'm a brandom by birth and the
[1:10:24] part of Mr M brandom is in me and if you
[1:10:26] become a son and daughter of God part of
[1:10:28] deity lays inside of
[1:10:34] you now Blasphemous names here's where
[1:10:38] we're going to we'll just piece all this
[1:10:40] together about what happened with Adam
[1:10:42] and what happens with us but here
[1:10:45] Jehovah Witness in their book now
[1:10:47] talking about Jehovah Witness it says
[1:10:49] it's the breath that you breathe is your
[1:10:50] soul now that cannot be right the breath
[1:10:52] that you breathe is not not your soul
[1:10:54] all right so the breath Adam was
[1:10:56] breathing was not his soul he was a
[1:10:58] living be he was a living
[1:11:00] being but his soul didn't breathe in and
[1:11:02] out his soul is a real person that
[1:11:05] individuality and it listen that Soul
[1:11:08] stuck in your body
[1:11:10] right right that Soul was stuck in
[1:11:12] Adam's
[1:11:16] Body no transmigration right can't
[1:11:20] become another Soul somewhere
[1:11:22] else now you're one time you're one kind
[1:11:25] of Soul next time you're somebody else
[1:11:27] that
[1:11:28] means Susan never mind me
[1:11:32] me oh never mind me and somebody
[1:11:35] else I'll just become Sue she'll become
[1:11:39] me boy that would be confusing wouldn't
[1:11:42] it cuz who are you you're schizophrenic
[1:11:44] you may be Brother Gary you may be
[1:11:46] brother Boyd you may be brother Bob you
[1:11:47] may be whoever no you're one person soul
[1:11:50] and that's who you are and you got a
[1:11:52] name all right
[1:11:55] so that makes it more
[1:11:58] simple that oh I can be this but I can
[1:12:00] no you are you you are the one that's
[1:12:04] going to be judged as we read many
[1:12:05] scriptures downstairs Saturday you're
[1:12:07] going that soul is what's going to be
[1:12:10] judged look where you'd be now the
[1:12:12] breath is wind and what the is what you
[1:12:16] breathe into your nostrils it's just
[1:12:18] wind I take the scripture from back and
[1:12:20] God breathed the breath into his
[1:12:21] nostrils and he became a living soul I
[1:12:23] want to ask you something if he was a
[1:12:24] man now look if he was a man what kind
[1:12:26] of breath was he breathing before God
[1:12:28] breathed his breath of life into
[1:12:32] him right see what kind of breath he was
[1:12:36] a breathing living
[1:12:39] man right well then if that be so now
[1:12:41] he's talking about this talking about
[1:12:42] every animal's a living Soul what he's
[1:12:44] saying is Adam's breathing the animals
[1:12:47] are breathing but Adam's different cuz
[1:12:49] God's fixing to give that Soul eternal
[1:12:51] life he's not going to give eternal life
[1:12:52] to these because because they don't have
[1:12:53] a soul everybody with
[1:12:56] me so now I'll read it here then if that
[1:12:58] be so then every animal is a living Soul
[1:13:01] cuz they breathe a human soul and our
[1:13:02] soul and all together he's talking about
[1:13:04] breathing back and
[1:13:06] forth think about that when you cat or
[1:13:09] dog breeze on
[1:13:12] you but look and it makes sense the
[1:13:14] animal sacrifice would have been
[1:13:15] sufficient we wouldn't have had to have
[1:13:17] a man die for
[1:13:19] us if that's true but they don't have a
[1:13:21] soul so that Soul couldn't come back on
[1:13:23] us or into us so brother the argument
[1:13:26] don't stand but what God did he breathed
[1:13:27] the breath of eternal life amen then he
[1:13:30] became a living Soul a soul that can't
[1:13:34] die amen now
[1:13:37] watch we're going to get into honey Plum
[1:13:40] up to your elbows notice breathe the
[1:13:42] breath of eternal life into his nostrils
[1:13:43] and he became an eternal Soul cuz look
[1:13:45] cuz God breathed comma stop listen not
[1:13:48] what nature done right listen we were
[1:13:53] naturally breathing before we got born
[1:13:55] again and right now you're naturally
[1:13:58] breathing
[1:13:59] again am but we have the Breath of Life
[1:14:03] inside of us because we have the new
[1:14:05] birth but it didn't change our
[1:14:09] breathing I wish it would walk a couple
[1:14:12] of miles and see if you're Eternal I
[1:14:15] mean see if your breath
[1:14:17] Eternal I don't even want to go there
[1:14:21] but look cuz God breathed not what
[1:14:23] nature done but what God
[1:14:26] did all right breathe the breath of life
[1:14:29] into his nostrils and he became a living
[1:14:30] Soul then you say uh Adam died brother
[1:14:33] brandom but remember before Adam died he
[1:14:35] had a lamb that redeemed him
[1:14:37] Hallelujah those who he forew he called
[1:14:39] he got a lamb to why did Adam need a
[1:14:42] redeemer if his breath that when he
[1:14:45] became a living person his breath was
[1:14:48] eternal he didn't need a
[1:14:51] sacrifice then the lamb was provided for
[1:14:54] Adam because already in his nostrils he
[1:14:57] had become the breath of Eternal
[1:15:00] God and he became a living Soul he was a
[1:15:03] Son of God not his
[1:15:06] breath Africans call it amoya let's
[1:15:08] continue on go through this but look
[1:15:11] paragraph 190 but God especially upon
[1:15:16] Adam cuz he didn't on us at our
[1:15:19] birth all right is everybody with me but
[1:15:23] I was a full grown Son of
[1:15:25] God God created him that way all right
[1:15:29] breathed the breath of eternal life and
[1:15:31] he became an eternal person with
[1:15:34] God he was a person before he became an
[1:15:36] eternal person with God you were a
[1:15:38] person before now you're an eternal
[1:15:39] person with God if you have the new
[1:15:41] birth he had power like God he was an
[1:15:43] amateur God he was God of the earth not
[1:15:46] God Of Heaven now God of the earth and
[1:15:48] someday the sons of God will again
[1:15:50] become
[1:15:51] Gods blasphemous names continue on the
[1:15:54] church is a mystical Body of Christ born
[1:15:56] of the Breath of God I've already read
[1:15:58] this I read it again did you get it amen
[1:16:00] Church of God is born of the Breath of
[1:16:01] God God breathed breath into the
[1:16:03] nostrils spiritually of Adam not nature
[1:16:07] not what nature done spiritually into
[1:16:10] Adam he became a living Soul do you know
[1:16:12] the Pentecostals or the true Pentecostal
[1:16:13] church is born of the Breath of God then
[1:16:16] he talks about there in St John and see
[1:16:20] whether the church is born by the Breath
[1:16:22] of God or not like Adam was in the
[1:16:24] beginning and then he reads the
[1:16:26] scripture and what do the scripture say
[1:16:27] he breathed on them and said receive ye
[1:16:29] the Holy Ghost Church born of the Breath
[1:16:30] of God when this stature not statue when
[1:16:34] this stature has molded itself up there
[1:16:36] in condition God's breath breathes upon
[1:16:40] them receive the Holy Ghost then you are
[1:16:42] a son of God you can join anything you
[1:16:44] want to but you're born in the Church of
[1:16:46] the Living God born by the Breath of God
[1:16:49] God breathed upon them and said receive
[1:16:51] ye the Holy Ghost ghost oh my there you
[1:16:54] are but when you become a child of God
[1:16:56] you are born by the Breath of God am man
[1:16:57] better leave it alone right there he
[1:16:59] must have got some rebound from his uh
[1:17:02] discernment where somebody was going no
[1:17:04] I don't believe that I'm glad I don't
[1:17:07] have discernment like
[1:17:11] that did you ever notice a little baby
[1:17:13] when it's born his little muscles
[1:17:15] twitching jerking when it comes to the
[1:17:16] Earth it receives a spirit then it
[1:17:18] becomes a living soul and as soon as the
[1:17:21] soul goes back from that little body
[1:17:23] there's another one waiting for it if
[1:17:24] this Earthly T Tabernacle be dissolved
[1:17:26] we have one waiting it's not something
[1:17:28] hanging up in the closet it's inside of
[1:17:30] you because first God makes the Soul and
[1:17:33] Spirit it just goes to the
[1:17:35] bodies and then when we leave here we
[1:17:37] only change Dwelling Places and go to
[1:17:39] another one for this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:17:41] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:17:43] so that's our consolation comforter
[1:17:46] 1961 but as soon as it's born talking
[1:17:49] about a baby you don't see it but
[1:17:50] there's a spirit in the soul hanging
[1:17:52] near that mother to come into that baby
[1:17:55] just as soon as it's born think about
[1:17:57] that next time you witness a birth or or
[1:18:00] God was there something was there it
[1:18:03] wasn't the devil the devil might have
[1:18:05] been there to disrupt everything but but
[1:18:07] when that baby
[1:18:08] goes and starts crying God did
[1:18:13] that God did that and until the age of
[1:18:15] accountability God still did
[1:18:18] that but when you come to the age of
[1:18:20] accountability if I can get to it I'll
[1:18:21] read it real quick brother M says now
[1:18:24] you make a
[1:18:25] choice amen all right look just as soon
[1:18:27] as that baby's born God has created a
[1:18:29] soul and created a spirit to being that
[1:18:31] baby just as soon as it's born into this
[1:18:33] world that little baby becomes now look
[1:18:36] that little baby becomes matured and it
[1:18:38] begins to learn then it becomes a living
[1:18:40] Soul now it wasn't a dead Soul
[1:18:44] before now it's got to make a choice
[1:18:47] life or
[1:18:49] death in your soul then it's got just
[1:18:52] like like Adam and Eve set before a tree
[1:18:54] of right and wrong it makes its Choice
[1:18:56] and then it becomes intelligent it's
[1:18:58] growing all the time in God's Great
[1:19:01] economy now brother Ram just to clear
[1:19:03] this up listen when your soul goes in
[1:19:05] your body as a child as a baby it stays
[1:19:09] there until you die or translated all
[1:19:13] right before I close this subject I know
[1:19:16] there's a question in your mind you will
[1:19:17] want to know if I believe in the
[1:19:18] doctrine of pre-existence now I
[1:19:20] explained that last Wednesday the
[1:19:21] Mormons believe that we all existed
[1:19:23] before we ever come down here we had a
[1:19:26] mind we had intelligence we thought
[1:19:28] about this we had a plan that we wanted
[1:19:30] to make Jesus be the the the F the
[1:19:33] Savior and the father liked his plan
[1:19:35] more than he lik Lucifer's plan and
[1:19:36] Lucifer preached his message to a bunch
[1:19:38] of other people and they came down here
[1:19:40] in human bodies and we got down here in
[1:19:42] human bodies and here we
[1:19:45] are brother Brown they asked him one
[1:19:47] time and I didn't bring it but brother
[1:19:49] Brown what were you before you were born
[1:19:50] he said you were nothing only in the
[1:19:53] mind of God were you
[1:19:55] something remember the
[1:19:58] thought those thoughts stayed
[1:20:01] there until one day you needed a soul
[1:20:03] and a body I mean a soul and the
[1:20:07] spirit right there's not a body that
[1:20:10] ever comes here that don't have a soul
[1:20:12] where it can God's not
[1:20:14] going I didn't know that was going to
[1:20:17] happen no God knew everything had them
[1:20:19] all ready had them all ready to go and
[1:20:22] then that soul that you have by the new
[1:20:24] birth is not exchanged is
[1:20:28] changed CU if it was exchanged that mean
[1:20:30] you just take this one out and put
[1:20:32] another one
[1:20:34] in confusing this is the best way
[1:20:37] because it God thought of it right I
[1:20:39] don't believe in the Mormon doctrine of
[1:20:41] pre-existence of souls any more than I
[1:20:43] believe in reincarnation in other words
[1:20:45] coming back is something else or the
[1:20:47] transmigration as far as the amoya the
[1:20:50] the I can breathe in brother Donnie long
[1:20:51] enough and he'll become me
[1:20:53] me
[1:20:55] Gary he won't even want to get close to
[1:20:57] me
[1:20:58] now be careful here and see this it is
[1:21:01] not the person that comes predestinated
[1:21:04] eternally from God I wish the people
[1:21:05] Seed doctrine people would see that it's
[1:21:08] not the person that comes predestinated
[1:21:10] eternally from God it's the word or seed
[1:21:12] way back there too far back for the
[1:21:14] human mind to grasp the Eternal God look
[1:21:16] with eternal
[1:21:19] thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have
[1:21:22] I loved and Esau have I hated and
[1:21:25] neither was born neither had done good
[1:21:27] or evil but God knew they would by what
[1:21:30] for knowledge so it was the thought and
[1:21:33] then that thought became expressed and
[1:21:36] God b Jacob back bought back Jacob
[1:21:39] because Jacob alone was seed he saw that
[1:21:41] Jacob would take the birthright and Esau
[1:21:43] would not Jacob alone had the seed that
[1:21:45] is why he had respect to the birthright
[1:21:48] and Covenant of God if you are true seed
[1:21:51] you will hear that word the spirit will
[1:21:53] baptize you into the body of Christ
[1:21:55] filling you and empowering you because
[1:21:57] you're not filled or or powerful any
[1:22:00] other
[1:22:01] way the spirit will baptize you into the
[1:22:04] body of Christ filling you and
[1:22:05] empowering you and you will receive the
[1:22:07] word for your day and age
[1:22:12] that's that's what the new birth
[1:22:18] is Ezekiel 18:20 I brought these from
[1:22:22] downstairs
[1:22:23] from
[1:22:24] Saturday the soul that sinth it shall
[1:22:26] die so do you sin in your body no do you
[1:22:30] sin in your second realm every day but
[1:22:34] you ask for
[1:22:36] forgiveness but it's the soul that sinth
[1:22:39] it shall die now look the son shall not
[1:22:41] bear the iniquity of the father so he's
[1:22:44] separating into
[1:22:45] persons just because my daddy was a
[1:22:47] drunk which he was not just because if
[1:22:49] your daddy was a drun or your mama was a
[1:22:51] prostitute that has no bearing on you oh
[1:22:55] yeah it'll bear it'll be bearing on your
[1:22:56] head and your brain but you can't say I
[1:22:59] can't get born again cuz my mama was bad
[1:23:01] I can't get Bo you can't blame your mom
[1:23:03] and daddy for
[1:23:05] it you're going to stand before judgment
[1:23:08] as an
[1:23:10] individual
[1:23:12] amen the son shall not bear the iniquity
[1:23:14] of the father NE shall the father bear
[1:23:15] the iniquity of the son the
[1:23:17] righteousness of the righteous shall be
[1:23:19] upon him and the wickedness of the
[1:23:21] wicked shall be upon him all
[1:23:24] right Matthew 16: 26 Jesus says what is
[1:23:28] it a man that profiteth he shall gain
[1:23:30] the whole world and lose his own
[1:23:33] soul or what shall a man give in
[1:23:36] exchange for his
[1:23:38] soul
[1:23:40] wow so what does your soul do it makes
[1:23:42] you an individual a unique person gives
[1:23:45] you free will and a choice that's
[1:23:47] it right it don't
[1:23:50] migrate it don't die and and God pulls
[1:23:53] that one out and throws it away and
[1:23:55] brings you a new one no he cleans you up
[1:23:59] praise
[1:24:03] God you'd be a different person we are a
[1:24:06] different person you understand we're a
[1:24:08] new creation but we're not a different
[1:24:10] I'm still way Dale you're still whoever
[1:24:13] you were before you were born again you
[1:24:15] just have new thoughts brother Brown
[1:24:17] covers that many many times but now
[1:24:19] watch
[1:24:20] this when that sacrifice is re receiv by
[1:24:22] the fire it goes up like that the smoke
[1:24:24] goes up you rise with your sacrifice now
[1:24:27] watch you rise with your sacrifice we're
[1:24:29] sitting in Heavenly places all right our
[1:24:32] soul has been redeemed so watch you rise
[1:24:35] with your sacrifice into the heavenlies
[1:24:36] and you're sealed away from the things
[1:24:38] of the world then our souls on his
[1:24:41] altar right now listen it's not
[1:24:44] somewhere
[1:24:45] else still inside of you but what it's
[1:24:47] done is you've been translated as we
[1:24:49] read in coloss you've been translated
[1:24:52] right into that that's why your thought
[1:24:54] process is
[1:24:56] different what have you done then after
[1:24:59] you have been after after you have been
[1:25:02] died then what are you to do then you
[1:25:05] are conceived a new he's talking about
[1:25:07] dying out to yourself you are conceived
[1:25:10] a new you was first conceived in
[1:25:13] iniquity now you're conceived in
[1:25:15] something new what is it the Living Word
[1:25:18] not just letters on the page The Living
[1:25:20] Word of God something living out of
[1:25:22] sight out of
[1:25:23] you all that changes it now doesn't it
[1:25:26] now we're through the struggle after
[1:25:27] seeing what you got to do now what
[1:25:29] happens you're conceived in new and the
[1:25:30] Living Word what is it the word becomes
[1:25:33] alive in you you begin to see things
[1:25:35] different where once you couldn't see
[1:25:38] that now you do see it there's something
[1:25:41] different now makes all the scriptures
[1:25:43] come
[1:25:44] together right that makes
[1:25:48] sense the Baptist can read the Bible an
[1:25:50] unconverted person can read the Bible
[1:25:51] and get a total different perspective
[1:25:54] than you
[1:25:55] get they do it every
[1:25:59] Sunday there something different now
[1:26:01] makes all the scriptures come together
[1:26:02] makes everything dovetail just right
[1:26:05] that's why brother Brown said that the
[1:26:07] that the um manifestation of the new
[1:26:09] birth in the end time is receiving what
[1:26:11] not the word for Luther's
[1:26:13] day that's out there in the
[1:26:15] denominations he said you receive the
[1:26:17] word for your day right recognizing what
[1:26:20] your day and it's
[1:26:23] message now something's begin to happen
[1:26:25] now you die to your own thinking now
[1:26:28] you're conceived because we are Washed
[1:26:30] by the Water of the word is that right
[1:26:32] what do you do with a baby as soon as
[1:26:34] it's born you wash
[1:26:36] him as soon as a man has died to himself
[1:26:39] and born of God he's Washed by the Water
[1:26:41] of the
[1:26:42] word that's why I'm telling you I'll
[1:26:44] tell you dad's told me a million times
[1:26:47] he said If somebody walks in this door
[1:26:49] and they sit on the front row and
[1:26:51] they're just abs absolutely on fire with
[1:26:54] God give them about 6 months you'll see
[1:26:56] if it was good or not we've seen it
[1:26:58] happen time and time again but I had
[1:27:01] rather you sit like brother Lis
[1:27:04] did sit and listen take your time right
[1:27:08] process it let God speak to hear not
[1:27:12] here let God speak to your heart that's
[1:27:14] right and let a preacher preach to you
[1:27:18] cuz he's going to what discern the
[1:27:19] thoughts and intents of your heart maybe
[1:27:21] not discern as far as I know what you're
[1:27:23] thinking no but God does and he'll bring
[1:27:26] a word down that'll help you sit
[1:27:31] there and just keep
[1:27:33] listening then if you want to shout
[1:27:35] that's okay if you want to sound on the
[1:27:36] front row that's fine but we've seen way
[1:27:38] too many people like brother Brown said
[1:27:40] what a house on fire windy day burning
[1:27:42] the candle at both ends you put you
[1:27:43] light the candle on both ends and it
[1:27:46] runs out twice as fast amen so settle
[1:27:49] down listen to the word of God
[1:27:54] stay in the word of God cuz listen if
[1:27:56] you stay under the fountain long enough
[1:27:58] you will get wet
[1:28:01] right he's Washed by the war of the word
[1:28:03] if it says Jesus name you say Jesus name
[1:28:06] says You must be born again you say the
[1:28:08] same thing every what God says you're
[1:28:10] washed by that water of the word now
[1:28:13] you're ready now for life you're ready
[1:28:15] to start now you're born a new born in
[1:28:17] the family of God with a new parent yes
[1:28:20] sir your tutors used to be now you got
[1:28:22] tutors that's now you that is now you
[1:28:25] got a new parent you can't be born
[1:28:28] without having a parent well praise God
[1:28:31] so if you're born in the Brotherhood of
[1:28:33] a church that's what you got if you're
[1:28:36] born in a Creed there you are but if
[1:28:39] you're born in God conceived in his word
[1:28:41] you got a new parent that's God ready to
[1:28:44] make his word known Among Us with you
[1:28:47] speak it through you amen speak it
[1:28:51] through through
[1:28:53] you oh a new parent that parent is
[1:28:56] God he's ready to take his word now that
[1:28:59] he's already spoke and lay it in you and
[1:29:02] make it come to
[1:29:03] life now look now he's he's he
[1:29:06] pronounced all
[1:29:08] that and he said see question mark he's
[1:29:11] asking the
[1:29:13] question
[1:29:14] now you have your
[1:29:17] training right go you're born
[1:29:20] again now you have your
[1:29:24] training you're ready to go into
[1:29:27] training now child training that's the
[1:29:30] hard part when you think you ought to do
[1:29:33] this and the word Cuts you around and
[1:29:35] shows you something else everybody who
[1:29:37] who's been there me I have been there
[1:29:40] before while they believe that over that
[1:29:42] don't make any difference what they
[1:29:45] believe here's what God said you must be
[1:29:48] about the father's business now you're
[1:29:50] getting born again now you're getting
[1:29:53] right getting straightened out you have
[1:29:54] a new parent so in order if you're born
[1:29:57] again and got a new parent then you got
[1:29:58] a new nature the old nature is dead now
[1:30:01] you say the old soul the old nature
[1:30:03] that's attached to your soul is dead and
[1:30:06] you got a new nature you once was going
[1:30:08] one way now you're going another way you
[1:30:10] once was going this way down now you're
[1:30:12] going this way up your affections are
[1:30:15] set on things above a new affection you
[1:30:17] don't love the things of the world no
[1:30:19] more your affections of God
[1:30:22] Ephesians 1:3 says blessed be the God
[1:30:24] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:30:26] has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:30:28] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:30:33] according as he has chosen Us in him
[1:30:34] before the foundation of the world that
[1:30:35] we should be holding him without blame
[1:30:36] before him in
[1:30:41] love real quick musicians come on let's
[1:30:44] stand to our
[1:30:50] feet he didn't Clarksville Indiana which
[1:30:53] is not far from
[1:30:54] Jeffersonville he said I see some of the
[1:30:56] Tabernacle folks here I'm going to say
[1:30:59] this about the big
[1:31:01] sister talking about the Tabernacle one
[1:31:04] thing that the Tabernacle needs up there
[1:31:06] at our church at the Tabernacle at
[1:31:08] Jeffersonville now this is where brother
[1:31:11] brandham
[1:31:13] preaches is a rededication and a
[1:31:16] refilling of the Holy Ghost that's right
[1:31:20] everyone to get down to The Altar and
[1:31:22] pray until they get a renewing see
[1:31:25] that's why we're right here
[1:31:28] now a renewing or refilling not get the
[1:31:31] new birth again get a
[1:31:35] refilling of the Holy Ghost that's right
[1:31:38] everyone to get down to the Altar and
[1:31:39] pray until they get a renewing of the
[1:31:40] Holy Ghost the whole church be filled
[1:31:42] with the power of God that's what we
[1:31:44] need not only the Tabernacle but the
[1:31:46] body of Christ Universal it needs a
[1:31:48] refilling I like David said one day
[1:31:50] restore to me the joy of my salvation
[1:31:52] now he had not lost his salvation but
[1:31:55] the joy of it how many of us have think
[1:31:57] maybe we've lost kind of the joy of our
[1:31:59] Salvation amen now he had not lost his
[1:32:02] salvation but the joy of it and when it
[1:32:04] comes to a place that I can't enjoy my
[1:32:09] religion when it comes to a place that I
[1:32:11] can't enjoy my religion oh I'd rather go
[1:32:14] out and eat instead of going to
[1:32:16] church well I got family coming on
[1:32:20] Sunday during church
[1:32:22] time I got my back turned so in case
[1:32:25] anybody will throw anything it hit me in
[1:32:26] the back of the
[1:32:28] head everybody believe brother was a
[1:32:30] prophet I'm going to turn around and see
[1:32:31] if we raise our hand I believe he a
[1:32:33] prophet right he said there's something
[1:32:35] wrong
[1:32:36] somewhere because it's supposed to be
[1:32:39] joy unspeakable and full of
[1:32:42] Glory what shall we do with Jesus 1963
[1:32:45] let me say something this uniting time
[1:32:47] to see churches uniting Nations uniting
[1:32:50] it say uniting time of God and his bride
[1:32:53] too and I say this with reverence and
[1:32:55] respect I believe that the bride of
[1:32:57] Christ is
[1:32:59] called wow that was in
[1:33:02] 1963 I believe she's sealed in the
[1:33:05] kingdom of God I believe the mechanics
[1:33:08] is there now watch what he watch his
[1:33:09] verbiage watch what he says they're
[1:33:11] waiting for the Dynamics that'll take
[1:33:14] her off the earth into glory in the
[1:33:16] Rapture everybody with me I believe it
[1:33:19] with all my heart yes sir we don't know
[1:33:21] how he's going to do it but he shall do
[1:33:23] it I know how he's going to do it
[1:33:24] through the word of God through the
[1:33:25] message of the hour studying read your
[1:33:28] Bible he is the Dynamics now watch watch
[1:33:30] what he says a little bit later and
[1:33:32] we'll we'll stop right here we just
[1:33:34] become members of the machine of his
[1:33:37] body forming oursel into his image and
[1:33:40] see him uniting himself with us in his
[1:33:43] works with his love gifts as he hands
[1:33:47] them to us just before the wedding
[1:33:50] supper remember we get married down
[1:33:53] here we go to if we don't get married
[1:33:55] down here we don't go to a wedding
[1:33:58] supper we get married down here we go
[1:34:00] there we're waiting watching for that
[1:34:02] look their their big churches being to
[1:34:05] be United the Dynamics of this church
[1:34:08] will be a refilling of the holy spirit
[1:34:11] that we have worked in a small measure
[1:34:13] while The Headstone is coming down to
[1:34:14] unite with the body watch what he says
[1:34:17] here but when that head and body unites
[1:34:19] together the full power of the Holy
[1:34:22] Ghost will raise her up just exactly
[1:34:24] like that even the dead that's dead in
[1:34:27] Christ for hundreds of years will raise
[1:34:28] in the beauty of his Holiness to take a
[1:34:30] flight to the skies the Dynamics is the
[1:34:33] holy spirit One More Time Lord listen to
[1:34:36] this I say if we don't take all that
[1:34:38] Steam and know how to direct it
[1:34:40] fundamentally in the word he's talking
[1:34:42] about remember he said the the certain
[1:34:44] group had had PL money in the bank but
[1:34:47] no checks right this one over here had
[1:34:50] plenty of checks but no money in the
[1:34:51] bank
[1:34:52] all right that's what all this just to
[1:34:53] save time I said now if you would just
[1:34:56] take all that Steam and know how to
[1:34:58] direct it fundamentally in the word the
[1:35:00] big regime of God will start moving on
[1:35:02] he talking about the Pentecost there's
[1:35:04] where Satan got in now watch this to
[1:35:06] make it all mechanics and no Dynamics
[1:35:09] now we see
[1:35:11] that but now we see in the message a lot
[1:35:14] of Dynamics and no
[1:35:15] mechanics somebody say
[1:35:18] Amen same people having a shou and good
[1:35:21] time which is fine but where's the word
[1:35:23] of God to grow
[1:35:26] you back all Dynamics and no mechanics
[1:35:28] see we've got to put it together we've
[1:35:31] got the power of the Holy Spirit how
[1:35:33] many believe that we've got the power of
[1:35:34] the Holy Spirit but we've got to come
[1:35:36] back with the word to feed this
[1:35:41] machine to feed the
[1:35:44] machine we can't feed it on Creeds or
[1:35:47] false Doctrine it won't burn it chokes
[1:35:50] up the flu and it will not burn it it
[1:35:53] was made for the word of God man shall
[1:35:56] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:35:57] word not just part of it every word that
[1:35:59] proceeds out of the mouth of God I like
[1:36:03] what he says to feed this machine we got
[1:36:05] to go back to the word of God
[1:36:09] amen amen to feed this machine let's
[1:36:13] sing a song God bless
