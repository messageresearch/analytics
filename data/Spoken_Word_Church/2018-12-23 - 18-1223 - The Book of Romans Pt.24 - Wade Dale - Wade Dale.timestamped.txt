[0:00] I've got several clients all right good
[0:04] main here I don't want to thank y'all
[0:05] for the gifts that were given we
[0:07] appreciate it
[0:08] begin in myself I'm going to yes come on
[0:17] buy me a new murder yeah and that's not
[0:19] a little bitty thing that's one you get
[0:21] in and it turns you upside down yes that
[0:26] it's very good for you back and it's
[0:27] very good for your lamps on how you get
[0:30] in if you strap your legs and your knees
[0:32] in it then you hit the button and it
[0:33] goes back for Jim Carrey where you at
[0:36] that time you get strapped in if she
[0:44] gets upset with you she if you guys
[0:46] upset with me I'll not go near the thing
[0:52] all right let's get start on the other
[0:54] side this is going to cover a little bit
[0:57] about what we're going to talk about
[0:58] stairs v II don't know if y'all watch
[1:02] Wednesday night but you should have and
[1:04] if you hadn't then I'm gonna review it
[1:07] today but still we must see the
[1:13] transgression of Israel so that we can
[1:15] be grafted in and that's the whole point
[1:17] is that Israel committed to Helius sin
[1:24] God didn't kill her he just put her away
[1:28] now that doesn't mean that she can't be
[1:31] the servant just like you know just you
[1:35] look at your marriage and divorce
[1:36] situation just because you have to live
[1:39] in husbands or to limit why that's not
[1:40] going to send you to hell there's a lot
[1:43] of things that you might not get to do
[1:45] but it's not gonna see it's not
[1:48] salvation issue it's a committed
[1:51] somebody changes you if you just want to
[1:53] really get down to the bottom bottom you
[1:55] can't have two husbands you can't -
[1:57] living the wild or to live and husband
[1:58] study if you do then God couldn't do
[2:01] what he did he put Israel away
[2:04] divorced her I read it when Tina he put
[2:08] Israel away but he didn't kill her you
[2:12] don't have a right to kill you why
[2:13] unless you back in the Old Testament you
[2:15] don't have a right to your wife because
[2:16] you commit the daughter but you can't
[2:18] take her back because she's been defiled
[2:20] and you can't receive her back that's
[2:22] why another man can't have reader
[2:24] because it's their defiled and that's in
[2:27] the flesh part of you not in the
[2:30] spiritual part the only one you have
[2:33] that is thinking this other day the only
[2:34] one that you have in a theophany is in
[2:37] your mind you don't have a woman you're
[2:39] you understand what I'm saying we are
[2:42] human as human and human can make but
[2:45] the only your mind is where you receive
[2:47] the Holy Ghost not the womb of your
[2:49] flesh the woman your flesh I said many
[2:52] times before and Paul's covering a lot
[2:54] here the one with your flesh like
[2:58] brother Brown says she can be forgiven
[2:59] but she can't be justified in other
[3:01] words once you leave your virginity
[3:02] let's just be honest once you lose your
[3:04] virginity you can't redo that right okay
[3:07] but you can be forgiven for it yeah
[3:10] that's not a big deal at all you can be
[3:12] forgiven if you're truly honest like
[3:14] that I always think of that poor Rosella
[3:18] and brother branham's meeting you know
[3:20] drunk props up to you and Nene said here
[3:23] she sticks now clean seeing God's eyes
[3:26] she's cleaned now the whole world seen
[3:27] her before there was you up but in God's
[3:29] eyes she's clean
[3:30] yeah alright and and she'd go down
[3:34] testifies and and all that for the Lord
[3:37] the Lord which is wonderful I mean to me
[3:40] that's that's redemption in your soul
[3:44] now we got to work on redeeming the body
[3:47] and realizing that that really you
[3:49] didn't do it is that really is attached
[3:51] in there somewhere
[3:52] that really you didn't do it anyway so
[3:55] to me that's the grace of mention
[3:57] divorce because we were all prostitutes
[4:00] in our spiritual realm we were all
[4:02] prostitute we had a different husband
[4:06] that husband had to die so that we can
[4:09] make Christ problem is as we came
[4:13] divorce
[4:13] Satan came divorcing because he's still
[4:18] alive he's got to be dead in your life
[4:20] and watch what Paul says no we're
[4:22] talking about we'll talk about the fifth
[4:25] seal
[4:26] afternoon but that fifth seal Jew is in
[4:31] the lead group of people set aside but
[4:33] there had to be a min grafting of the
[4:35] Gentiles will look in the dangled 70
[4:37] weeks afternoon but that in grafting of
[4:43] the Gentiles will the church ages come
[4:45] in on that chart
[4:46] that's the engrafting that Paul's fixin
[4:48] to talk about and that Israel was
[4:50] blinded so that you and I could come in
[4:54] so now adjust God came literally wined
[4:58] his people and then destroy him
[5:01] he's putting him in the fifth seal Jew
[5:05] and giving him eternal life
[5:07] so what a great thing great says that's
[5:10] what I said it Wednesday night no way
[5:12] man can come up with grace no way
[5:14] we are not graceful people it's always
[5:18] you did this I did that and you always
[5:20] hold that mark against whoever it is you
[5:22] can't we can't probably we can forgive
[5:26] ourselves you gotta start with forgiving
[5:31] yourself first but if you can't forgive
[5:33] others then that's not gracious alright
[5:38] so look I like to cover that fish still
[5:41] means a lot more to me than just sold
[5:43] under the altar that are Jews being
[5:45] given eternal life for just being the G
[5:48] but watch what Paul says here I may read
[5:51] this afternoon but since y'all are here
[5:52] I'm going to just read it today I say
[5:54] they have God cast away his people all
[5:57] right last Wednesday we read we read it
[6:00] again in Jeremiah Ezekiel God called
[6:02] them he called them horde them he
[6:04] called him a horsewoman he called him a
[6:07] prostitute he called him everything in
[6:09] the book okay but have God cast away his
[6:14] people no because remember I read that
[6:16] in Jeremiah recent how can this a woman
[6:18] with a suckling child forget the job you
[6:22] can't any woman has had a baby never
[6:26] four kids
[6:27] whether she gives her the way when she
[6:29] never forgets you in there baby so God
[6:31] will never forget it
[6:32] ever forget it alright and not forgiving
[6:36] is well he's got to do something with
[6:38] her or for her which is what we're
[6:40] coming in the fifth silver watch here
[6:42] have God cast away his people god forbid
[6:45] now what's Paul fixing to tell us is
[6:46] that now he is an Israelite of the seed
[6:49] of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin so
[6:51] he is a Jew Paul did you Paul is covered
[6:56] in jury j-wro I jury God hath not cast
[7:01] away his people which he foreknew
[7:04] they've killed you 144,000 all those
[7:07] things you me but right here he's
[7:10] talking about the Jews because watch he
[7:12] says watching not what the scripture
[7:14] says of their lives
[7:15] realizing how he maketh intercession to
[7:18] God against Israel saying Lord they have
[7:20] killed thy prophets and digged down
[7:22] thine altar and I am left alone remember
[7:24] when Jezebel pronounced it Elisha she
[7:28] was going to kill Elijah he run into a
[7:29] cave and he did instead Lord there's
[7:35] nobody left but me and they seek my life
[7:38] in other words Jezebel is out to kill me
[7:41] that's my favorite scripture Oh have
[7:47] they left me alone
[7:48] well did God reminds you like you did
[7:51] him while you hang your head down for
[7:54] good God God answered live and told him
[7:58] said I'll buddy I got 7000 right just
[8:01] like you okay so you know do they seek
[8:05] my life but what saith the answer of God
[8:07] into him I have reserved to myself seven
[8:09] thousand men who have not bowed the knee
[8:13] to the image of bale in other words
[8:15] Elijah said I'm the only one gone
[8:16] another one that's message you believe
[8:18] that right God said now I got seven
[8:24] thousand people around the country the
[8:25] bleep same way you did even so then at
[8:28] this present time bringing it up to here
[8:31] there is a remnant according to the
[8:33] election of grace now that we're graced
[8:37] and if by grace then it is no more of
[8:41] works
[8:43] because remember when Christ died on the
[8:45] cross he died once for all so there's no
[8:48] other work involved we just got to
[8:51] believe he did that's our problem we
[8:54] start listing what we got to do yeah
[8:58] laundry list of things we got to do well
[9:01] grace grace never made a list if you
[9:06] make a list it becomes works you just
[9:09] write grace up there somewhere at your
[9:10] house just right grace because that's
[9:13] what it is comes by grace thinning this
[9:15] no more works otherwise grace is no more
[9:18] grace like I just said then but if it be
[9:22] of works then is no more grace
[9:25] otherwise work it's no more work what
[9:29] then
[9:30] he's fix an answer question Israel hath
[9:32] not obtained that which he seeketh for
[9:36] Israel God's people a range of that
[9:42] wings not Israel is God's people he says
[9:45] he was there he said he was married to
[9:47] okay they did all these things now don't
[9:51] you think he knew they were going to
[9:52] absolutely but he left him going and do
[9:54] it but what but the election hath
[9:57] obtained it now be there is all kind of
[10:01] II legs there's a knee legs to go to
[10:04] hell there's no legs go to heaven
[10:07] there's an electic 144,000 there's an
[10:10] elective sealed you and there's an elect
[10:13] given eternal life at one time judgment
[10:17] okay because what is the election that
[10:20] word actually says the elect hath
[10:23] obtained it and the rest were blinded
[10:25] all right so there's a remnant Paul had
[10:30] to bring a remnant in because remember
[10:32] the 120 a Upper Room and probably close
[10:36] to all the Christians in the early
[10:39] church age were Jews all the ones in the
[10:44] upper end were Jews 120 in the upper
[10:46] room now 3,000 they received
[10:48] there were heathens they were they were
[10:50] Gentile many nations and they received
[10:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[10:56] but the 120 epigram were called to take
[10:59] that message out so they were Jews and
[11:01] they started in Jerusalem if you read
[11:04] your Bible they started in Jerusalem and
[11:05] worked their way out all right so that's
[11:08] what he's saying right here
[11:10] Israel have not obtained that which you
[11:12] seek depart now Israel knew they were
[11:14] God's people because I've told him
[11:18] everything but they thought they were
[11:20] married to him they were not once they
[11:23] went prostituting herself out he had two
[11:26] didn't kill them he wrote a variety of
[11:29] divorcement and put them away never for
[11:32] them to be alive again but there is a
[11:34] remnant that hath obtained it now see
[11:37] the 144,000 he's in a whole group by
[11:40] itself but they don't receive the Holy
[11:41] Ghost here
[11:43] all right the fish still Jew didn't
[11:48] receive eternal life here or they would
[11:49] be bribed they're not right they
[11:51] received it in another dimension in
[11:53] another time element the cup of water in
[11:57] my name and the foolish virgin they
[11:58] didn't receive white robes here they
[12:00] will receive white robes it's a white
[12:02] throne judgment okay am i right for that
[12:04] so he's got a lot of different people in
[12:07] a lot of different places but we're
[12:08] talking about Israel the rest were
[12:11] blinded God put his hand over their eyes
[12:14] he blinded them but watch he's
[12:16] interpolating according it is written
[12:18] God had given them the spirit of slumber
[12:20] eyes the tissue of not see and ears that
[12:23] they should not hear unto this day
[12:27] I'm bringing the present unto this day
[12:29] and so today the Jews are over there in
[12:33] Jerusalem looking for my side God
[12:35] literally blinded those people's eyes so
[12:38] that you now can be grafted in now God
[12:42] didn't kill the tree he grafted us in
[12:44] you don't kill the tree watch go didn't
[12:47] tell you I mean spirit slumber I hear so
[12:52] should not hear until the two
[12:54] today right here and David said let
[12:56] their table be made a snare trap and a
[12:58] stumbling block and erect a fence unto
[13:00] them excuse me let their eyes be
[13:03] darkened that they may not see and bow
[13:05] down their back all the way I say then
[13:07] man here's Paul I say then have they
[13:09] stumbled that they should fall god
[13:12] forbid but rather through their fall our
[13:19] transgression our God putting them away
[13:22] are them saying let his blood be on us
[13:25] and our children all that salvation has
[13:28] come to the Gentiles because they do not
[13:31] we'll look at this afternoon but I'll
[13:33] just give you law we've said this before
[13:38] but in the seventy weeks of Daniel
[13:40] seventy weeks are determined between the
[13:43] beginning to wind God restores the Jews
[13:49] back gives full ghosts 144,000 that's
[13:52] the seventy weeks of Daniel without the
[13:54] in gravity of the Gentiles that's the
[13:56] way it would look this is all Jews right
[13:59] when he grafted the Gentiles in this is
[14:02] what he done sixty-nine weeks one week
[14:05] he grafted in two thousand years with
[14:07] Gentile Church age
[14:11] okay which is all Gentile that started
[14:14] out to you here but hardly any to you
[14:16] now so Saul by Gentile Church age so
[14:20] what is this this is the grafted part
[14:23] this is the olive tree this is the olive
[14:28] tree okay didn't heal the tree you just
[14:33] graphed it in a Gentile bride because
[14:39] she can't be the bride anymore because
[14:40] right that's where she turned him down
[14:42] let his blood be on us in our children
[14:44] God even he back here in the Old
[14:46] Testament them away he knew what they
[14:48] were doing now he's going to restore
[14:50] them back here but not to the same
[14:55] position that we're here because he
[14:57] can't divorce a wife make somebody else
[14:59] and then
[15:00] same live over again hey do that why
[15:03] because the Bible says the land that's
[15:05] been polluted right everybody got that
[15:09] my marriage and divorce is really
[15:11] important because it covers everything
[15:12] Daniel 70 which covers all of the seals
[15:15] that's my brother one had to preach it
[15:16] right correct before you got started
[15:19] okay now watch have they stumbled that
[15:24] they should fall god forbid now see you
[15:28] say well they did yeah they fell from a
[15:30] position but they didn't fall completely
[15:32] in other words God didn't like I said
[15:33] God didn't kill the tree right here
[15:37] no you can't kill the tree even the root
[15:40] the very roots are the tree we live off
[15:42] of because the grass did you can grab
[15:46] any branch you won't do in a tree but it
[15:48] lived off the life of the roots that
[15:50] comes up through that tree Sophia would
[15:53] have killed the whole tree that's why
[15:56] our spiritual heritage in Jewish now I
[16:00] don't bear on where we need to be as you
[16:02] know we're not we're dead I don't try to
[16:05] be something the one God ever speaks for
[16:10] them we need to get the spiritual part
[16:13] it compares our spiritual understanding
[16:16] in a whole Old Testament about how God
[16:18] come in and crafted these Gentiles in
[16:23] cuz it tells us in the Old Testament
[16:25] there was a wild olive branch this was
[16:27] the wild olive branch we've allowed you
[16:31] think Israel was wild well they were
[16:34] pretty wild but we were Gentiles
[16:36] we didn't care so through their fall
[16:41] salvation has come to the Gentiles for
[16:45] to provoke them to jealousy right okay
[16:49] because the Jews are jealous of us
[16:51] they're jealous of everything else but
[16:54] now watch now if the fall of them be the
[16:56] riches of the world boy even though and
[16:58] the diminishing of them the riches of
[17:00] the Gentiles how much more their
[17:02] fullness form I speak to you Gentiles in
[17:06] as much as I am the upon
[17:08] the Gentiles I magnify my office the
[17:11] Lord Hill was the door open till the
[17:13] Gentiles
[17:14] Peter open that door God started and
[17:16] then Paul come in and became the church
[17:19] a messenger to the Gentile age called
[17:21] Ephesus the Alpha bride or the output
[17:25] church if by any means I may provoke to
[17:31] emulation or strive then which are my
[17:33] flesh and might save some of them now
[17:37] what's he saying is he said I'm going to
[17:38] the Gentiles but I don't want to make my
[17:41] friends mad I want to bring them into I
[17:44] want to save some of them no where's
[17:47] what's he saying I don't want you know
[17:49] well this were one more no more and I
[17:52] said you know no he he still preach to
[17:55] the Jews remember all he kept going back
[17:56] to Jerusalem he kept going back to this
[17:58] place kept going back to that place
[17:59] crying stable they just kept stone him
[18:01] and throwing him out throwing him over
[18:02] them you know won't be killing him but
[18:04] he kept going back for him to casting
[18:07] away of them be the reconciling of the
[18:09] world but what shall the receiving of
[18:13] them be but life from dead so in other
[18:15] words I'm gonna cast them out if you
[18:18] cast them away you've killed the tree
[18:22] you still gotta live off the tree so but
[18:25] laugh from the dead for you the first
[18:28] fruit be holy
[18:34] go ahead for him to first root be holy
[18:37] the lump also the public and if the Ruth
[18:42] be holy nor the Branson's nobody over
[18:47] that that's what that scripture said and
[18:49] if some of the branches be broken off
[18:51] and thou being a wild olive tree worked
[18:56] grafted in among them and with them for
[19:00] take us of the root and fatness of the
[19:02] olive tree so all this right here this
[19:04] this great tree bribe tree brother
[19:06] Graham talking about it's attached to
[19:08] the roots of the Jews the promises of
[19:13] God okay well we don't have to live
[19:17] think about testing the Old Testament no
[19:19] that's the very root of our Christianity
[19:21] is the ten commandments we just see a
[19:27] higher form of that in the opening the
[19:31] seals and all the word this guy cuz then
[19:35] the ten commandments if you commit
[19:36] adultery you broken one of the
[19:38] commandment Jesus said if you commit
[19:41] adultery up there you've broken one we
[19:43] come out all right boast not against the
[19:46] branch but if that most thou bear it's
[19:51] not the root but the root bear bears
[19:53] thee and that's what happens
[19:56] thou wilt say then the branches are
[19:59] broken off that I might be grafted in
[20:01] well because of unbelief they were
[20:04] broken off so my Jesus and thou standest
[20:08] by faith found no greater faith and is
[20:15] really except what the Gentile be not
[20:19] high-minded but fear no where's he's
[20:21] talking to both sides Gentiles don't you
[20:24] be throwing that now God married us and
[20:26] divorced almond Jews you don't say well
[20:29] we still got people and y'all don't know
[20:31] why talking about because you think this
[20:32] my son
[20:33] already coming and we think he's that
[20:35] guy here yet
[20:36] where if God spared not the natural
[20:38] branch okay take this heed lest he also
[20:41] spare not thee because we didn't when he
[20:45] cut these branches off he couldn't just
[20:47] threw them off and they died you know
[20:50] you can prune branches and throw them
[20:52] over in a pile and eventually you have
[20:53] burning because they died but if you'll
[20:55] take them things and stick them in the
[20:56] ground or put them back into a tree what
[20:59] does it David brings life back again
[21:00] that's what happened
[21:02] because look what happened even this
[21:04] wild olive branch is so wild God's
[21:07] married her but he's not forgot the rest
[21:11] of the branches or the tree he's not
[21:14] forgot that I've got something coming
[21:17] that I want to talk about is the
[21:18] Millennium right see the Millennium is a
[21:21] time for this a Jewish time not I can't
[21:24] town town that's right it's a Jewish
[21:26] time it's just for the Jews they still
[21:29] in the Sabbath church age are of the
[21:32] seventh day so that's a thousand years
[21:36] of Sabbath for the land okay for the
[21:41] land you'll remember we talked about the
[21:44] land when we come back 970 weeks and all
[21:46] those we come up the land well that's
[21:48] why there is has never been a millennium
[21:51] God promised a millennium and yes
[21:54] somebody's going to leave a thousand
[21:56] years but and that's okay that's all
[21:59] right to say that but the millennium is
[22:02] to the Jews for the Jews the son of
[22:04] David is going to sit on the throne with
[22:06] twelve tribes the day that's gonna
[22:09] blossom like a road everything is going
[22:11] to come back to and even like I said
[22:13] even like condition so they won't be
[22:15] eaten until the new city comes but it
[22:18] will be an eden-like condition to where
[22:20] the Jews and the Gentiles are gonna live
[22:23] in harmony for a thousand years on this
[22:25] earth because I'll read it to you and I
[22:27] read it to you Wayne tonight God said
[22:30] I'm gonna disperse you throughout all
[22:33] the nations but one day I'm bringing you
[22:37] back to this lamp wine
[22:38] that little spot over in Jerusalem why
[22:41] that little piece of land because he
[22:43] give it to Abraham he told Abraham
[22:46] wherever the soles of your feet go
[22:48] that's where I'm gonna give you so they
[22:52] all got up in 1949 50 and 60 and 70 and
[22:57] 80 and 90 in two thousand two thousand
[22:59] ten thousand two thousand eighteen the
[23:01] Jews are slowly coming back because the
[23:04] 144,000 has got to be somewhere close
[23:07] they don't have to be sitting around the
[23:09] middle of Jerusalem but they got to be
[23:12] inside that little area they got to give
[23:15] back around now remember anyway I went
[23:17] to Egypt he went to Iraq Iran so I said
[23:25] 144,000 are not just going to beat those
[23:30] Orthodox Jews no it's going to be the
[23:34] children of Israel the children of the
[23:36] 12 tribes Reuben Benjamin dr. Lee and
[23:39] all of all the 12 tribes but because of
[23:43] unbelief they were broken off and thou
[23:46] standest by faith be not high-minded
[23:48] but fear for if God spared not the
[23:50] natural branches take heed lest he also
[23:51] spare not thee behold therefore let me
[23:55] get that off of there alright behold
[24:02] therefore the goodness and severity of
[24:04] God on them which fell severity but
[24:11] toward thee in other words that severity
[24:16] would be severe let's see what after
[24:20] tomia
[24:20] rigor roughness he dell roughly with us
[24:27] because they played the part of the
[24:29] Laurita this afternoon again those of
[24:33] you that were named Wednesday night or
[24:34] didn't watch it we're gonna read it
[24:36] Jenna wins these
[24:37] I mean from wayne's people today and
[24:38] then add a little bit to it but toward
[24:41] thee goodness if thou continue in his
[24:44] goodness otherwise there I also shall be
[24:47] cut off hmm so in other words don't crow
[24:50] over here in the turn changes because
[24:52] you know what the Bible says I'll put
[24:55] you live out brother it's gonna start
[24:59] the church ages the church age instead
[25:01] you've got a little bit of life but if
[25:02] you keep going like you're going I'm
[25:03] gonna snuff your candle out all right so
[25:06] let's don't boast it while we're in this
[25:08] comfort zone
[25:09] okay no we're not a comfort zone no we
[25:13] still got to alive
[25:15] by God's grace and His Word yes yes
[25:29] because you got to remember God didn't
[25:32] ever grab the denomination anywhere yes
[25:35] he grafted his people it was history
[25:38] did he grabbed it from cause remember it
[25:42] reading a Bible there's there's a
[25:44] there's a part of Bible and things in
[25:45] Ezekiel that he's called the branch okay
[25:51] he's the root and offspring of David now
[25:54] he's the root not spring a day but
[25:55] that's where everything comes from
[25:56] yes but what he's gonna do he took the
[26:00] kingdom away over here but he's gonna
[26:02] set David right back up in the
[26:04] Millennium
[26:05] with the twelve tribes you and I are
[26:08] there for nothing else than just a
[26:11] honeymoon where you know go take a week
[26:14] off take a cruise you know in other
[26:17] words what I'm saying
[26:18] think of vacation y'all have fought
[26:21] through 2000 years I got a deal here
[26:24] just a little while with my Jewish
[26:26] friends all right and when it's all over
[26:29] I'm gonna just wipe the whole world all
[26:32] them
[26:32] kill each each other because remember
[26:35] this is not this is atomic fire this is
[26:38] not holy fire this when we come back
[26:40] into millennium this building could
[26:41] still be here it's not gonna wipe
[26:43] everything off now the new city
[26:45] everything's locked up coming back into
[26:48] millennium know we'll still that still
[26:50] be buildings it's just an atomic
[26:52] destruction before they don't it
[26:54] but now when that new heaven new earth
[26:56] comes down God's gonna refigure the
[26:57] whole earth I believe he's going to
[26:59] refigure it back to where the flood
[27:00] before the flood right back to the
[27:03] Garden of Eden
[27:04] okay cuz remember when the new city is
[27:06] gonna push up front it's gonna push up
[27:08] over there in Jerusalem at the very spot
[27:12] where Abraham milk as he took communion
[27:14] plus eight lanes did not Abraham look
[27:17] for that city all his life and it was
[27:20] right under his feet about 200 feet
[27:22] below it that rock pyramid rock sitting
[27:25] right there blundering right now right
[27:27] now I believe what brother NC I believe
[27:31] doc told you must work with that robber
[27:34] Abraham and Melchizedek met and done
[27:37] communion verse 23 and they also if they
[27:43] abide not still in unbelief shall be
[27:45] graffed it in another word unbelievable
[27:48] gets you graphed it out
[27:49] Belial gets you grabs it in God is able
[27:51] to graft them in again yes again yes he
[27:59] cut the tree off him and he's David he
[28:01] grafted in the Gentiles he still got
[28:03] life mm-hmm they're over here the
[28:05] ranchers are coming back in for you were
[28:08] cut out of the olive tree which is wild
[28:10] by nature and weren't grafted contrary
[28:14] to nature into a good olive tree
[28:17] how much more you see you see what he
[28:20] said this was the good on the tree God
[28:23] took the good olive tree took the wild
[28:26] by nature which is us grafted us into
[28:30] that good branch like I said he didn't
[28:34] grabbed it into a dead tree right all
[28:36] right he grabs didn't rot into a good
[28:39] tree right here we're gradually contrary
[28:43] to nature
[28:43] into a good olive tree how much more
[28:47] shall these which be the natural branch
[28:51] look be grafted into their own olive
[28:57] tree there's 144,000 grab the drop back
[29:00] in these over here didn't receive the
[29:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul
[29:05] but God promised these right here he's
[29:07] known when he grasped it back again
[29:08] these are going to receive the Holy
[29:09] Ghost just like you and I they'll
[29:13] receive the new birth they'll be born
[29:15] again all right yeah by right with that
[29:18] so you see what I'm talking about yes
[29:21] sir you're right what a mighty God we
[29:23] search for I would not brethren that you
[29:26] should be ignorant of this mystery
[29:27] what's the mystery that God could take a
[29:30] wild olive branch they didn't care
[29:32] nothing about you make such a wonderful
[29:35] tree out of it but he grafted them into
[29:39] the good tree to start with okay
[29:42] he didn't grass it into a bad dream he
[29:44] grabbed it into a good trip all right
[29:47] well I would not brother that you should
[29:49] be ignorant of this mystery lest you
[29:52] should be wise in your own conceits that
[29:54] blindness in part has happened to Israel
[29:56] until the fullness of the Gentiles be
[30:01] come that's why God graphed it in the
[30:06] Gentile he blinded their eyes at Calvary
[30:09] so that you and I could come in but he's
[30:12] not gonna forget her he's coming right
[30:14] back to 144,000 NT you gotta do prophets
[30:20] and like I said Wednesday night now we
[30:22] got to remember let's don't be so
[30:23] narrow-minded and I've always said
[30:25] there's only going to be 144 thousand
[30:27] nine hundred four thousand to one I may
[30:29] want to change that a little bit but God
[30:30] said 144,000 that's men that's men the
[30:35] women and children that are attached to
[30:37] that could be can make that double but
[30:41] the landings is always with the male
[30:44] not to female this way the signs of Jada
[30:48] not the daughters of Jacob the sons of
[30:50] Jacob are the children of Israel are the
[30:53] children of Jacob when we say children
[30:55] of Israel what do you think of you think
[30:56] of all no it's the 12 children they take
[31:01] a ladder and then God change Jacob's
[31:03] name to wipe his room so it's the
[31:06] children of Israel is those 12 tribes
[31:08] God's never got away from the 12 tribes
[31:10] those 12 tribes because you know what
[31:13] he's gonna put a rock back in order
[31:15] right here remember remember they're out
[31:16] of order even now history right who is
[31:20] it Joseph in somebody else you got put
[31:21] back in got put in because Dan and
[31:24] somebody else got took out reach the
[31:28] steelbook of a region rich book but when
[31:31] you come back to the Bible right here
[31:34] everything's put it right back in order
[31:37] because you've got you twelve tribes
[31:39] three on each side
[31:40] three three three in the city and then
[31:43] you got to leave on us right here so
[31:47] that would be 13 tribes really but it's
[31:49] 12 tribes
[31:50] 3 6 9 12 and to leave us in the middle
[31:53] me and you mean you cuz in a new city
[32:02] who's going to be there the 12 tribes
[32:03] and the brother and we live in here
[32:08] that's true
[32:09] they bring their tithes into the city
[32:11] just like they did to leave us
[32:14] these would go out and do that do
[32:16] whatever and bring their tithes right
[32:17] back in but the 144,000 are not going to
[32:23] be the bride their servant does if
[32:25] you're reading in you City it says three
[32:27] tribes on this side three tribes that's
[32:29] the way it was sent up when the ark was
[32:31] put in the middle right well that Ark is
[32:34] me and you that's where the Holy Ghost
[32:36] fell right so that's what the whole the
[32:42] dosage is now it's in their City
[32:45] so everything's wonderful top if you
[32:48] just kind of look
[32:48] that way okay wonderful top let's finish
[32:53] this up and so all Israel shall be saved
[33:00] now remember pay attention not all the
[33:03] Israel is Israel so you gotta go back to
[33:05] what he said in Chapter nine ten recent
[33:10] on all these rules Israel so when he
[33:12] says all Israel shall be saved
[33:13] anything may ever person is over there
[33:15] in that city of Israel is gonna be safe
[33:17] no only the elect as it is written there
[33:21] shall come out of Zion the deliverer and
[33:23] shall turn away ungodliness from who
[33:25] Israel Jacob for this is my covenant
[33:29] unto them when I shall take away their
[33:33] sins now the only time they're gonna
[33:35] take away that stand is what we're gonna
[33:36] talk about this afternoon the six fold
[33:38] purpose day of seventy weeks takes the
[33:40] sand away from Israel makes an industry
[33:43] erectus Aviation for iniquity back okay
[33:47] so he's restoring them back and that's
[33:50] the covenant will be under live what
[33:53] they deliver and you're going to turn
[33:55] ungodliness from Jacob for this is not
[33:58] coming on them when I shall take the
[33:59] winter sin added according sorry as
[34:02] concerning the gospel they are enemies
[34:04] of God for your sake Israel is an enemy
[34:08] of God for your safe but as touching the
[34:12] election they are beloved for the
[34:14] father's day
[34:15] that's the elect for the gifts and
[34:18] callings of God are without repentance
[34:20] for as he in times past have not
[34:22] believed God yet have now obtained mercy
[34:25] through their unbelief through the youth
[34:28] unbelief you've received mercy right
[34:31] but remember grace is still there grace
[34:36] for the Jews are still there because if
[34:37] not then you start doing your laundry
[34:39] list of work all right even so have
[34:44] these also now not believe that through
[34:47] your mercy
[34:50] coming out to the end of the Gentile
[34:52] dispensation that through your mercy
[34:57] they without us cannot be made perfect
[35:00] today they also may obtain mercy 144,000
[35:05] and the Millennium that's their mercies
[35:07] coming back in for God have concluded
[35:12] them all and unbelief that he might
[35:15] mercy have mercy upon all oh the depth
[35:18] of the riches both of the wisdom and
[35:19] knowledge of God there's grace how
[35:22] unsearchable are his judgments and his
[35:24] ways past finding out because you know
[35:27] what regular world doesn't understand
[35:32] one did you just like what we explained
[35:34] just now if you would have told them
[35:36] tell the world that they would not
[35:37] believe about half of it's me Calise how
[35:40] do you know and all this than that but
[35:41] see we had a prophet to help us put
[35:44] scripture together
[35:45] I said helpless the whole girls are the
[35:47] only one who can put three but he helped
[35:49] us put the scripture together
[35:51] so that we can see that man that wild
[35:53] olive branch was the Gentiles it come
[35:56] from the Jews so God can't forget the
[35:58] Jew there's still life there and then
[36:00] what he's gonna do he's gonna take that
[36:02] wild olive branch and what's he gonna do
[36:03] he's gonna harvest it take it in a
[36:06] rapture leave the tree there for the
[36:10] hundred forty four thousand for the last
[36:12] week of dang Cindy weeks then a
[36:14] millennium that's where you gonna say
[36:16] that tree blossom outta here all right
[36:22] for who have known the mind of the Lord
[36:25] in other words who can figured this out
[36:26] that's right
[36:27] really we wouldn't because we look back
[36:31] at their own dick just like I said
[36:33] Wednesday night there'd be no grace
[36:34] which they kill you know or who has been
[36:38] his counselor in other words God doesn't
[36:41] have to go to a second or third person
[36:42] and go hey what do you think about one
[36:44] of these in today
[36:45] no and God's not that way that's right
[36:48] because he's already saying it you
[36:50] already know you so that's just kind of
[36:52] the way things it's just perfect that
[36:54] one or who has first given to him nobody
[36:58] gives got a suggestion no and it shall
[37:03] be recompense unto him again in other
[37:05] words I gotta redo this thing let me
[37:07] rethink don't rethink that's what's
[37:09] great
[37:11] he don't rethink nothing for of him and
[37:16] through him and to him are all things
[37:18] the case sums it all up to whom for for
[37:22] above him and through him and to him now
[37:28] that covers your home that covers all of
[37:30] them to whom be glory forever amen
[37:36] just watch what he's dis next I'm gonna
[37:39] read this and then we'll go I beseech
[37:40] you therefore brethren by the mercies of
[37:42] God that you present your bodies a
[37:43] living sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[37:45] God which is your reasonable service and
[37:47] be not conformed to this world but be
[37:49] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[37:51] that you may prove what is that good and
[37:53] acceptable and perfect will of God was
[37:55] the will of God his word that's your
[37:58] holy all the will of God is his word you
[38:00] don't know what God's thinking was
[38:01] looking about right all right yes yes
[38:11] he's alive
[38:12] God is the life Israel is not the life
[38:16] of the tree God is the life of the tree
[38:21] they know him as Jehovah we know him as
[38:25] Jesus Christ they won't know him as
[38:27] Jesus Christ when we come back in two
[38:29] millennia
[38:30] there's not gonna be anybody alive do
[38:32] you hear me there's not gonna be anybody
[38:34] alive that's gonna wonder do go to yes
[38:38] don't be no demons they'll be there but
[38:40] they'll brother Ram said there'll be no
[38:42] words you won't be able to work to
[38:43] anybody that's why the millenniums
[38:45] different from the future home the
[38:47] millennium is nothing but man killing
[38:48] each other okay wiping the earth off
[38:51] that's coming back into millennium the
[38:53] demons are still here Satan still alive
[38:55] but when the end of that thousand years
[38:57] comes when judgment comes they're all
[39:00] thrown in the lake of fire where souls
[39:02] will be killed so he'll kill all those
[39:04] imps and and cancer demons and all the
[39:08] things all those things man completely
[39:10] done away with and that's why the future
[39:11] home and the millennium you can use
[39:13] scripture for the same one but there's
[39:15] some time in there you got separated
[39:18] there will be in the millennium not
[39:23] sinners or sin but it'll still be there
[39:26] somewhere because they remember the end
[39:28] of the millennium at the end of the
[39:29] millennium Satan brings his people
[39:32] together and tries to destroy us that's
[39:36] when God destroys those demons so the
[39:39] demons are still there they just have
[39:40] done the work on I mean me and you're
[39:42] standing board by body when they gotta
[39:45] work on it's done been destroyed in you
[39:48] but now it's not being destroyed
[39:49] everybody else there's still questions
[39:52] brother branham can there be with
[39:54] children born in the millennium looks
[39:55] like the can looks like the game so
[40:00] that's what he's it so you know what I'm
[40:04] saying is though and the Millennial
[40:06] there's a lot of things that's gonna go
[40:07] on but in the future home it's pretty
[40:11] cut and dry you see it you'll push up
[40:15] will come down on top of that new city
[40:16] and we'll live there with no all sins
[40:19] don't have things out of here but now in
[40:20] the Millenium you know they might be a
[40:23] little few things that goes on there you
[40:26] know what whatever we gotta get
[40:31] something here first
[40:32] before we can go there so look we're
[40:34] gonna start with chapter 12 not next
[40:39] time you
[40:40] turning sunny so we will be here when
[40:43] you're not going I'll be preaching
