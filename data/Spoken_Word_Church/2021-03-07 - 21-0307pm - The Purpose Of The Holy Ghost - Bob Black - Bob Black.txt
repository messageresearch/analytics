how many enjoyed that service this morning appreciate brother louise pouring his heart out to us i i was telling him earlier it's just amazing how the holy spirit works in continuity because a lot of things that i uh that he mentioned this this morning i i have in my notes and scriptures to read about and everything so it's it's good to know that that god is with us and god's moving and glory to god everything all right okay all right um let's go right into the word john chapter 14. and before we go let's go let's go and and and address the author lord god we thank you god for your grace and mercy to us lord jesus in this hour it looks like things are are getting darker as as the devil seems like he's getting at anger and we want to make the devil angry anything i can do to make the devil upset that's what i want to do lord we we remember your prophet spoke about how that that in this hour it would get darker and darker and darker and we remember him down at telling a little story of in the cave where he said there was that little boy that said there is a man that can turn on the light and lord we're looking for you to turn on the light for us this afternoon lord jesus in this dark hour that we're living in lord come among us now and turn on the light and reveal to us that there's nothing to be afraid of that you're still with us that lord you're still moving among your people and that you've given us you've equipped us in this hour with the equipment to stand against all the all the powers of darkness all that the devil can throw at us you've given us something to withstand and we thank you lord god for all that you've given to us lord jesus and we're grateful for it now lord we pray lord that you'll just feel welcome here to move among us this afternoon lord jesus lord let us not just be a vain gathering together lord jesus but gathering together to worship in you and the power of your resurrection to know you lord in the way that you want us to know your tough lord i believe that you've given us everything to restore our fellowship back with you lord jesus to restore our communion with you now lord and through your word lord let us commune with you this afternoon as your word goes forth we ask lord god that the words that i speak lord will not be my words lord but you will speak words of edification and strength to your people and open up the ears of your people to hear and receive lord we ask these things in your name amen so john chapter 14 verses 14 to 21 says if you shall ask anything in my name i will do it if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because that seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i and you he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved to my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him jesus saith unto him not his carry it lord how is it that thou would manifest ourself unto us and not unto the world and jesus answered and said unto him if a man loved me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which you hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you you may be sitting seated the lord has blessings to reading the word so just to add a little context to the scripture as you as we were reading those words maybe think about how the how it was really another junction time something was about to take place and the disciples thought that uh they had put all their maybe looking at jesus as the fulfillment of of something they didn't quite understand looking at him to bring in another kingdom that they didn't quite understand and then here he was talking about how he was going to go off the scene going to leave him and but yeah he was trying to give him some comfort i i'm leaving you but i'm going to give you a comforter yeah and and they didn't fully understand maybe at that time what what that meant what that comforter was going to do and what the purpose is and i believe maybe in this hour there's many people that don't understand the purpose of what the holy ghost is and so that's what i want to want to bring this afternoon is what was it given for now brother brown preached that series of three messages back back in 1959 or whenever it was what was the holy ghost given for and and how to get it and how did you how to know you got it which was the one that was not recorded and then then the uh questions and answers on the holy ghost and we were actually listening to questions and answers on the holy ghost as we were coming up the road this morning and in that sermon brother branham really lays out what happened on the day of pentecost that he explains he dramatizes a little bit for you and if you go back and listen to that brother bam talks about how they were in the upper room brother jesus told them to go to jerusalem and terry and wait and they waited there for 10 days and they were there in that upper room and then it was like three different things began to take place there they were there in the upper room with all their different opinions and all the different ideas of what was going to take place how long it'll be and we know that peter rose up and said well hold on now we ain't got it yet let's just wait a little bit longer and then they all began to get in one accord and the bible says in acts that they began to pray in one accord and they were there getting in getting their their mind in one accord believing that god was going to give that promise to them that the promise was to them and it was going to it was going to come and and brother brown began to relate that that three first first they saw it was like a like a like a mighty rushing wind moved into the building like a rushing wind and then he said he began to describe that it was like he compared it to that that movie ten commandments cecil b demille's movie the ten commandments where you he said look at that pillar of fire in the movie how they how they put that in that movie and off of that pillar of fire were little licks of fire and he said that's just how it was all for that pillar of fire little licks of fire and he said in that room there in that upper room the little licks of fire began to circle and move and they were sitting there and they began to observe the looks of fire moving them out that room and the licks of fire began to settle on each one now that's number phase number two the licks of fire began to appear now now see how you can begin to you can see something and that's great that you can see something you can feel something that's great but the third thing was the holy ghost the holy ghost went into them the holy ghost to birth them and the holy and then what what happened he said now they were about a block away from the temple where the temple was they were in that upper room and it was at a block away and they were up in that upper room because they were scared they were afraid of of all the people outside that they might kill them and they might string them up and all those things they were afraid but when the holy ghost fell on them it quickened the word that they had been hearing for three and a half years and they weren't afraid anymore and they went out they went out on the street and the holy ghost was so they were so filled with the holy ghost brother graham said that they could not express what was going on with him and he said they were moving a block they were going toward the temple a block walk a block away where all the people from cappadocia and phrygia and all around the world were gathered together to worship there the temple and as they went they began people were asking them what's wrong with what's going on with you and they they begin to share that they tried to express that this is the thing that we've been waiting on this is the promise that was foretold in the book of joel and all those things that brother branham said that they could not express they couldn't quite get it out and and they began to say this they staggered and with stammering lips and other tongues they began to say this is the thing and god changed their words as it came out they with understanding began to speak and he changed their words so that other people could hear what they said now now we know all those things that was how the holy ghost first fell that was the holy ghost first fail and i want to ask you this question what did it do what was the purpose of the holy ghost was the purpose of the holy ghost just so they could preach right there in the temple was the holy ghost just so that they right there in that moment so that they could they could preach good sermons what was the holy ghost for that was a purpose to the holy ghost you see there's a there's a purpose the holy ghost was given to actually accomplish a purpose everything is for a purpose brother abraham said this church is erected for a purpose there's nothing without a purpose and a cause you are here for a purpose the holy ghost was sent for a purpose and if we can get get into the message and identify what our purpose is what our role is what the holy ghost is here for it will give you confidence and power brother said what was the purpose of god sending the holy spirit what's it for if it's such a great thing then why did god send it if you can understand that you must have the holy ghost you've got to have the holy ghost is more important than who you're going to marry it's more important than what job you have is more important than where you live it's more important than any other decision you can have in your life because everything else stems from that thing if that holy thing is living inside of you as the bible calls it that holy thing then everything else will just radiate off of that the sons of god are led by the spirit of god as the bible tells us now now brother jesus said here in john chapter 14 verse 18 i will not leave you comfortless i will not leave your accomplice i will come to you so that kind of proves if jesus is coming to you if that is jesus coming to you with the holy ghost then that proves that christianity is not just a dogma christianity is not just some things that we learn but christianity is actually the person of jesus christ being revealed to you it's a person coming and living inside of you that's what the holy ghost is is that jesus christ himself coming and dwelling inside of you and revealing himself to you and that's why brother adam said god's purpose we find here in sending the holy spirit was one purpose that god himself might dwell in his church that god himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church to continue his plans that one day he was working in jesus christ but now he's working in you and i to continue his plans and you to use your hands and use your feet and use your eyes and so forth that god was in christ continuing his plans through christ and out of christ into the church continuing his work through the church now now again i'm y'all know how i do lately i preach i preach directly from a message so the message that i'm preaching from is what was the holy ghost given for with a little bit of a little bit of lean in on questions and answers on the holy ghost what was the holy ghost given for so if you have any questions about this i always want my ministry to not point back to me don't go listen to what i said over and over again but go listen to what the prophet said go listen to what brother branham said and as you listen to him and dig into what he said then then it's actually pointing back to jesus christ and the revelation begins to unfold not because of what i said but because i'm repeating what he said i'm i'm i'm breaking down the nuggets of what he's already spoken and i hope that maybe gives you confidence what i'm saying this this afternoon now he said now we know what the holy spirit is we find out last night that is god now now brother brown said now when we think of god the father as jesus spoke of here his father god the son is jesus god the holy spirit is what we call it today now that does not mean that there is three individual distinct gods it means that there is one god and three offices now i'm not going to break down the godhead or anything this afternoon but brother brother ram said may we say it like this all that god was he poured into christ because he emptied himself and poured into christ and christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily all that jehovah was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into the church not into one individual but into the entire body so from that we can take the point that god wants to pour himself into you he wants to pour himself into the body he wants to pour himself and what does that mean to pour into it means that he wants to give you the same mind he wants to give you the same power he wants to give you the same works he wants to give you the same life he wants to give you the same qualities he wants to give you the same person the same person that walked on the shores of galilee he wants to put that in you and that's what that means when he poured he poured all of himself into christ and he walked on the shores of galilee fully manifesting every characteristic of god every quality of god all the patience and long-suffering all the joy and everything that goes into being god and he wants to pour all of that into you so if you want the holy ghost if you want all of that to be poured into you you've got to find out how it works because brother branham in this sermon he's talking about how god works according to his law and if you'll follow his law follow his plan for how to get the holy host in you then you can have god will pour all of that into you not into one individual but into his body and of which you are a part of you are a part of that body and god can pour into as he's pouring his spirit into the body he's pouring himself into you now this whole all through the scriptures it talks about god pouring himself and brother uh jesus there in luke 22 as he was having his last supper he said likewise also the cup after supper saying this this cup this cup with the wine in it this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed or poured the original the original greek is poured for you this cup is put my my my life poured there on the cross it was poured out so that it could be poured in you it was blood his life was poured out on the crosses that was shed for you so that he could pour his life into you on the after the day of pentecost and titus it says not by works of righteousness it's not by our works that he pours his life into us which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost which he shed or poured on us abundantly he's pouring it on us abundantly if we'll work in the way that he has designed it out to be to be worked through let me pause like that just for a moment and kind of dwell on that do you know what that means god has a law through which he works just like an electrician if you go to build a house you there might be power running all through the power lines outside but if you can if you can have the correct understanding to know how to wire a house and run the wire from here to there and put everything in place and get everything in the way that will allow the electricity to flow then the electricity will flow through the house and will light all the light bulbs and if you can work according to god's law in that same manner then god's power can flow through you and that's why you've got to hear the preaching of the gospel so you'll know by what law this the holy spirit will flow through you the same way with a plumber if he's plumbing a house the water will flow through that house through the pipes if you work according to the right law and put everything in order and and and don't make no leaks or anything but everything situated in just the right way so it's working according to the law that when the inspector comes he can say everything's built according to the right the right pattern the right plan and when you turn on the valve then the water will flow through it that's the same way the holy ghost is well if you do everything exactly the way that god's word says the power of god will flow through you so that the holy ghost can fully be manifest and that god can feel you feel every fiber of your being that's what this gospel is for to allow the holy spirit to feel people to feel individuals so that you can manifest the word for your age in acts chapter 2 verse 17 and 28 it says and it shall come to pass in the last days as they were testifying of what what had taken place i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh pour out i will pour it out and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my sermons and on my handmaidens i will what i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and in acts chapter 10 verse 45 when when peter was speaking to the to the the house of cornelius it says while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many came with peter because that on the gentiles also was what poured out the gift of the holy ghost now the holy ghost was poured out there in the house of cornelius upon all them that heard the word so there is how you lay the conduit for the water to flow through there is how you get all the electrical wiring laid out so that the power of god can flow through is by the word if the word is preached in the right way and you receive it in the right way with a with a broken and a contrary heart ready to lay down all your old ideas and say i was wrong there and now i believe it this way because it's been vindicated it's been proven i recognize the truth i believe it that something has got to happen now now jesus told this parable of filling up a wine bottle and he said no man put the new wine into old bottles in other words you can't pour you can't pour the holy ghost into an old wine bottle that's all all hardened up and and all got it so just so stubborn that it won't listen to nothing else it's still so stubborn and it won't listen to the truth jesus said no man put us new wine into old bottles that's the new wine just burst the bottles and the wine is spilled and the bottles will be marred but new wine must be put into new bottles you can't put new wine into a bottle that's got so so hardened up and so resistant to the truth that every time you try to tell it's something new that maybe it hadn't hurt before that it just blows up and bust and then the way it was i was talking to somebody about how they were testifying about just sharing some things about what they had seen in the gospel and the person that they were talking to just blew up and said how can you teach me you come to teach me and they begin to blow up and that's that's putting new wine into an old bottle when somebody blows up and you maybe you'll be sitting there in church and you say i ain't listening to that i'm stubborn i'm stubborn god don't want somebody that's stubborn he wants somebody to be pliable like a little green tree like somebody that could just blow with the wind and look god teach me you know i was preaching up there in kentucky and i shared with them up there i said i'm going to share with you one of the greatest mysteries of the bible that if you want to get anything from god you come like a little child come like a little child with an empty bowl saying god teach me and i'm ready to receive i'm ready to do it what if you want me to be baptized over again if you want me to come and whatever you want me to do if it's according to your word i'm going to do it just like a little child you see then then you become a bottle that god can feel then you can become a bottle you're a bottle that's all oiled up and it's pliable and the more you put in it can expand and expand and allow allow itself to be filled an old bottle just just busts in the air every time you try to tell us something you see you see what happens is when you begin to recognize your purpose the holy ghost has a purpose and you have a purpose and your purpose is to be filled with the holy ghost god wants you to be filled up so much that he can use you god's purpose is to be for you to manifest his word and brother branham in this sermon he begins to right there in this in this sermon he begins to go and he begins to relate the story of ruth and about how ruth began to hunger and thirst for her purpose now the bible says that if you hunger and thirst for righteousness you shall be filled you shall be filled it'll be poured out if you're if you're hungering and thirsting for righteousness like ruth was brother brother said and as just as sure as you're hungering tonight for the holy spirit it's something in you pulling you that a purpose of your of god and your life has got to be fulfilled just like it was with ruth remember how ruth said she got to a place that she recognized that the place she was at she needed she needed to return go back to jerusalem she'd go back to israel she needed her purpose was not to stay there in moab but to follow and go by and ruth said and treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest i will go and wither thou largest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god in other words she began to recognize her purpose that the god that she the gods that she had been following there in moab she was changing from that purpose now to follow after this god the true god and she recognized her purpose i believe that's what brother branham was preaching about in desperation when you begin to recognize your purpose recognize what god has called you to do something begins to take hold in your life and you can't rest until you're satisfied i've got to be satisfied and the only thing that will satisfy me is the baptism of the holy ghost god filling me with his own life that's the only thing that's what i need brother said that's when a person's called a vision don't make any difference what our people said you're going over there and becoming a holy roller or something that didn't make any difference to ruth there was a purpose of god to be fulfilled when you can catch that vision and catch the purpose of god calling in your life it doesn't matter what somebody says about you it doesn't matter what somebody thinks about you you're there you're ready to see god's word fulfilled in your life you see god god in life in the life of ruth god was working on hurry on both ends see god god is doing something to make a way for your purpose so ruth was coming back she was coming back to the homeland and their boaz began that something was working in boaz and god's just the same way as just the same way as god god there on the cross performed the rite of redemption he performed everything that was necessary there on the cross since he died for you as god directed all of his anger there on jesus instead of directing it at you he directed every bit of his anger and his wrath on that man hanging on the cross so that you could come to him you say well i wonder if god is angry with me but he's already directed all of his anchor on him he poured it out on him all of his wrath there on the cross as he beat as he was beaten and and mocked and scorned all of that wrath was poured out on him so that you would have a way so that you would have a path to come back to jesus brother brown said that's the way god did he followed his own laws right see god don't expect you to follow his laws and that he not follow god is a man that he follows his own laws god cannot follow give you one law to follow him this is what brother brahma said and in him follow another he follows his own laws you see why it's so important to follow follow these laws to follow the prescription because the prescription is how the wiring in the house is done the prescription is how the pipes are laid and if you follow the law follow the work the way the follow the prescription then everything will work so that the holy ghost can flow through the right channel brother said then god in order to redeem the lost church the lost world the lost creation god who is infinite in spirit to redeem the lost human race god himself become kinfolks a man a son that he created in the womb of mary and then he made an incent or a testimony outside the gates of jerusalem he was lifted up between the heavens and earth and died and redeemed everything and in bleeding he sanctified a church that he himself might live in and fellowship and commune with that lost spot of fellowship from the garden of eden where god came down every evening church time so what was the holy ghost given for what was all of this for to restore you back to fellowship redemption was fellowship restored communion restored living in man again that's the purpose of the holy host the purpose of the holy ghost is restore you back to fellowship to restore you back to communion so that you have an understanding of what god wants so that you know what your purpose is so you recognize the purpose of god living in man brother said it that's the purpose of the holiest it's the father again god the father dwelling in you working out his plans to finish his plan of redemption working through you making you a co-worker with him giving you a place do you realize how magnificent that is that he didn't just come himself and do all the work there on the cross but he wanted you to have a role in saving your brother and sister he wanted you he wanted the ministers to preach the gospel he wanted you to testify at your workplace he wanted you to share it with your friends and he gave you a part in this so that you would be a co-worker with him that's what the holy ghost is given for giving you apart for your fallen lost brother and sister giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the garden of eden and it's there in this message that brother man talks about how there in the garden he began to say adam adam where art thou but now it's his spirit in you saying adam adam where arthur it's the spirit in the church that's what the holy ghost is giving for he's crying out for those lost people through you it's no more god walking through this to the through the evening time in the garden of eden but it's now him walking in you speaking out a message of peace and joy and deliverance to people that are lost that are bound in prison changed come like brother luis was saying this morning to come there's there's something to come to and it's the promise of the holy ghost is it it's the father manifesting himself in you in john chapter 14 verses 8 to 12. philip sayeth unto him lord show us the father and it sufficeth us show us the father i wonder if can we recognize where the father is now brother brown said that when you get the holy ghost you've got father showing the holy ghost living inside of you because it's not three different people it's that one god living inside of you so if you want to see the father show us the father where is the father now where is his tabernacle he's tabernacling in the hearts and lives of his children jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and thou has not known me philip he that has seen me have seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works what is it today when somebody's preaching the gospel and speaking the words of eternal life it's the father speaking if it's not some man's ideas or man's opinion if it comes straight from the word but quickened by the holy scholastic it's not man speaking anymore but it's the father speaking and it's god performing in you his works it's not the man doing the works but it's the father doing the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father and he went to the father to put the father in you to declare the works of the father that's what the holy ghost was given for the holy ghost was given to declare the works of the father it's the father working in you and living in you to declare his great attributes in first john chapter 1 verses 1 to 3 it says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it we have seen the life manifest do you know that's what the holy ghost was given for to manifest the life of god to put it on display not just some dogma not just some good teaching but the life the quickened word made alive resurrected from dead works god himself walking and tabernacling in you for the life was made manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto what's he saying that we're showing unto you that eternal life that same eternal life which was with the father when was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ that's why john chapter 14 says at that day he shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i and you why because now the father is tabernacling himself and you declaring himself through you and then and that gives you reason to know that i am in my father jesus is in the father and you're in him and it's all wrapped up together he's in you by the new birth and you're in him because you're part of that body and he's the manifestation of the father that's why he's in him i and you i am in my father and ye and me and i and you we're all part of this one great mystical body and through that god and manifesting that life that same life that spoke the world into existence through you john chapter 16 verse 26 to 27 at that day ye shall ask in my name and i say unto you that i will pray the father for you i'm not going to pray the father for you in that day for the father himself loveth you because you have loved me and have believed that i came out from god and that day the father will be tabernacling in you it's the father manifesting himself what is the holy ghost given for god filling his church with the same life that was in jesus christ that's what the holy ghost was given for now now brother branham in this message he said after the reformation of 1500 years of dark ages luther was the first reformer to come forth after the round of the apostles and then when luther come forth god tipped up a little bit he's got his just to paint a picture he's got his filling pot he's got his after 1500 years of dark ages 1500 years it's time to get to feeling how does he feel it how does he lay the pipework how does he lay the electrical wires so that the electricity can flow so that the water can flow how does he get it he said and then when luther come forth god tipped up a little bit of the spirit and poured it out upon the church in justification it's time to get to feeling now now see this is what the holy ghost was given for see how seeing why it's so important to listen to what brother graham said so many times we'll get in our head well i already know what the holy ghost was given for but you begin to listen to what he's saying right what is it for anybody he's bringing it up to a culmination in this message he's bringing up to what it's really for now listen he said god tipped up a little bit of the spirit and poured it out upon the church in justification why was he able to pour it out upon the church in justification because out of that dark age out of the out of the darkness came a little bit more of light as luther began to preach that it's not by doing no venus and by paying paying people to be prayed out of purgatory and all those you're not saved by that but you're saved by faith in jesus christ and that is counted for righteousness just the same way as it was to abraham that's what makes you just that's what makes the person feel with the holy ghost just down in your soul you're just because the price has already been paid and god is not looking at you he's looking through he's looking through the smoke of his burning blood he's looking through the smoke of that atoning sacrifice his blood has already paid the price and he's not looking at you he's he's made you just by his sacrifice and and that's what martin luther was preaching and that's what allowed the pot to be tipped up a little bit pour it out a little bit now i'm just dramatizing they're not an actual pot we're not talking about we're talking about the life of god being poured out into the church and he tipped he brother and said god tipped up a little bit of the spirit and poured it out upon the church in justification and then in the days of wesley he poured out a little more of himself into sanctification he poured out a little more of himself why could he pour out a little bit more because there was a little bit more light on the word and the more word you have the more word you believe the more spirit can be poured out and that's what the holy ghost has been taught wrong so many years the more words you have the more spirit can be poured out it's not that you can just go to a cam meeting or somewhere and you don't have a clue about nothing that you don't even have to listen to the word you just sit there and and you feel good or something but you've got to hear the word preached if the word is preached and you receive it then the spirit can be poured out the more word available the more spirit can be poured out that's why he said and then in the days of wesley he poured out a little more of himself a little more of himself into sanctification now you see where he's headed martin luther wesley a little more a little more see where we're supposed to be at now brother and i said look at the lutheran age you read history you read history look at their revival and what they did look how much greater the wesley revival was how much greater the wesley revival was and he said how much more power they had how much more power they had but in the minority and he said as the age has grown onto the end time god has been filling his church just look around and find out if that's truth or not just look around and and we can look inwardly and see look inwardly at the revelation of god that god has been pouring out in your own life that is how you should be able to recognize that god is filling his church in this hour get our mind like brother louise was talking about this morning get our mind if we can get our mind off of what other people are doing and how other people are preaching the message and doing all kinds i can't help that i can't help how people have made the message this and that and those and whatever i can't help that but i know that this message is true i know that there's power in this message i can't help what people are doing out there but i can help what i believe i can help myself i can hardly help myself i know this message is true and i know that there's power in it to change your life and brother brown said that the more word that's given the more spirit will be poured out and the more that's given the more is required but i'm saying now god he said as the light has begun to shine in this last days he's expecting us a great thing from us because where there's much given there's much required so he's going to require much more of us than he did of the lutherans or the methodists but because we walk in a greater light with a greater power with a greater witness than they had now we have a greater witness of the resurrection we have things more firmer more sure than they had a greater witness a greater a greater power what kind of a greater power greater power to be a light to the world to withstand everything every thought that the devil throws at you when the devil says you can't you can't do it we've got a greater witness in us a greater than he is in us than he is in the world it's god and you living it out it's not you it's not by your works but because you have received the word for your day that life is now being manifest in you and you've got a greater power and a greater witness and a greater testimony because god is now living in you in his fullness the fullness of the bride he's poured everything out all of himself is poured out into you the same characteristics the same life the same attributes the same love the same joy the same peace all that sameness that was in him on the shores of galilee is now in you and brother brown talks about how that it began coming forth from luther two shoots and moved on into a tassel and then onto the shook and then onto the corn and he talks about how that now listen we're talking about purpose that there's a purpose with the holy ghost that you have a purpose as an individual and he begins to say that you can't say the corn cannot say to the tassel i don't have no use for you because there's a purpose there's a purpose in every age a purpose to every believer and every age every believer has a purpose and so you can't look at somebody else that maybe doesn't have the capacity to go on as much as you and say there there's no purpose for you every believer i i'm trying to preach grace this afternoon every believer has a purpose don't let nobody tell you you don't have a purpose don't let nobody push you under their thumb and say well i'm greater than you if you can get down and hubble yourself brother i'm saying oh the tassel can't say to the leaf i have no use of you because the same life that was in the leaf made the tassel the same life that was in the tassel made the ear it was a lutheran church that made the wesley church it was the wesley church that made pentecost but pentecost what is it it's the restoration of the same kind of a grain that went into the ground at the beginning so every believer in this body has a purpose everybody has a purpose and they're all part of the plan we so we don't demean a holy ghost believer because for not understanding what you do we're trying to lift one another up we're trying to pull one another up and so we don't push we don't mock somebody because they may be stuck still inside of the eggshell but we're trying to help everybody out we're trying to pull one another out of the eggshell come on you can do a hatch come on it's time to start picking with that beak it's time to start speaking that word and come out of the egg come out of the egg we're not trying to keep you in the egg [Applause] excuse me see now now brother brown said now on this age that we're now live in this age this age is beyond pentecost it's time it's coming forth you are expected to be filled more because you've been given more word and so the holy ghost was given to teach to teach you it's beyond pentecost in other words it's moved on from the lutheran church to the wesleyan church to pentecost and now we're coming back to the ripening of the grain and that is what the holy oast is for the holy ghost is there not not just to give you the holy ghost not just to give you eternal life in your soul but it's actually there to begin transforming you from the inside out to it calls the maturity of the church the maturity of the bride to bring you into a maturity and to a place of maturity why because the holy the purpose of the holy oast the purpose of the holy oath is to eventually bring the dead from the ground that's what brother brown said in this message these are my words it's the holy ghost the purpose of the holy host is god the holy ghost expanding and expanding maturing you up until you come to a place where the holy where the dead will rise from the ground glory he said and i'm kind of jumping around a little bit i'm watching that clock brother abraham said and what was the holy ghost given for the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans they sanctified the methodists that baptized the pentecostals as now setting an order the coming of the lord jesus that same holy ghost is now setting in order the coming of the lord jesus how is it doing that he said when when it it'll be so powerful that body will come into this group of church that body of the lord jesus will come into this church in other words the church will be filled the church will be filled why because she's heard the word the full word the church will be so filled until that body will come into the church that'll draw the rest of them from the grave there'll be a resurrection that's what the holy ghost is for what is the holy ghost without us they cannot be made perfect without us they cannot be made perfect because it's the whole body being manifested and you take one part of that body out and the whole body is imperfect every member of the body is has a purpose every single member in that body is there for a purpose the lutherans were there for a purpose the wesleys were there for a purpose and you're there for a purpose and nobody here is demeaning you or pushing you down but there's a gospel here that if you receive it god can feel you in the same way that others have been filled i want to declare to you that if others have received the holy ghost then that should be a sign for you that you can receive it it's waiting there for you to receive it it's it's there brother i'm saying the skies are filled with they might be filled with the electric power but if you don't get the wiring right it can't be used but if you listen to the word and obey the word then that same power that has been given to others will be made manifest in your life what was the holy ghost given for to set an order the coming of the lord jesus christ to make a way for that body to be fully manifested in his bride the whole body of the word what body of the word the body of the son of man the son of man fully made manifested and a living walking group of people god fulfilling his word and manifesting himself in you the holy ghost was sent to live in you now i think it's so interesting how brother man preaches he preached after that sermon and he got really deep and then he backs off and he says he goes back to john 14 it says verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall we do because i go to my father and he begins to talk about how there's many people that sit in the church and they say i believe i believe and there's a quote in this message where eva says you can say you believe the pastor but that ain't the holy ghost you could even say i believe why do you believe it because the word says so but that's not the holy ghost and all these evidences see you've got to have the holy ghost and the holy ghost is different from the way many people think it is the holy ghost is not just a dogma or not just being able to intellectually in your mind to understand a lot of the things that are preached even but the holy ghost is a person the holy ghost in you will actually give you the correct interpretation of the word the holy ghost in you will mix that letter of the word that killeth with the love of god and it will give you the right interpretation that letter that you can take and chop somebody's head off with it and kill somebody the letter that will kill your family if you don't use it right the letter that could kill a church you mix it with the holy ghost and power the love of god in there and it'll give you the right interpretation you've got to have the holy ghost brother brown said see you see he said yes i believe sure i believe jesus christ is the son of god but the devil believes the same thing the devil believes the same thing so it's not just sitting in church and saying yeah yeah that's good that's a good idea and you go right back into the world and nothing's been changed you don't have the power of god in your life nothing's been changed at all you don't have the life of god being made manifest brother said you are not converted until you've received the holy ghost that's right you are believing unto now the definition of converted converted if you go and look on the internet converted means of a building having been adapted to be suitable for a new purpose in other words you take an old run down building that's good for nothing like you were when you were out in the world and convert it and fix it up so that somebody can come and live in it and that's what god is doing even when he converts you he's made you into a building that he can come and live in he's made it so you can he can live inside of you because that's what the holy ghost is giving for not just so that you can be a good church member and so that you can nod your head and go along yeah i believe it i yes sir i agree with the pastor i love i love the pastor i agree i agree with the word i agree with the word see there's a when the holy ghost comes in you it will make you really agree with the word where you thought that you agreed before the holy ghost will give you the right interpretation of the word why because it is the interpreter of the word the interpretation of the word is the word made alive the word actually living in you when it's there on the page it's dead it's dead letter it can kill it can kill and destroy but when the holy ghost comes it'll raise it from the gray and raise it up just like it raised jesus dead body laying then there in the tomb that body was spoken word body it was a spoken word spoken into the womb of mary and they're laying the tomb but one day at the rising of the sun that life came back into their body and caused it to rise up and brother brown said you're not sealed by believing unto but sealed by the holy ghost ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed until the day of your redemption that seals you when you found favor with god and he shields you by the holy spirit now i don't want to leave loose ends don't you just hate it when a minister preaches stuff like when you found favor with god and he leaves that loose end and you're sitting there thinking well how am i supposed to find favor with god how do you find favor with god through his word you find favor with god by doing the only thing that you can do is believe his word what else can you do but believe his word there's no work that you can do you can't beat yourself on the back with a whip or anything it's not how long you pray or things like that it's not even how much you come to church but that's part of it it's how much you believe god's word and when you believe god's word all of those things begin to become an outward manifestation that's why when you begin to believe god's word and take it at his word that something will be recognizable in you if you're not at the house of god every time the doors are open then that shows something is wrong in your life it shows that you have not identified the purpose of the holy ghost because if you see the vision if you see the purpose of the holy ghost in your life you'll be there every time the chur the word is being preached well i didn't mean to get on there listen first peter chapter one says seeing you have purified your souls you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of uncorruptable corruptable seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever it's the word of god the word of god is how you find favor with god the word of god now now if you actually catch the purpose of god in your life that that is what you're supposed to be doing here on earth is get the holy ghost that it will not matter how mean somebody is to you it will not matter what it speaks behind the pulpit it will not matter how rough somebody is you catch that purpose if you've got that vision you will do whatever it takes to get that holy ghost in your life you will drop everything until the life of god is manifested in you when you catch the purpose of god in your life that that's what god wants to do with you that that promise is laying there for you to get it he promised it and if he promised it then come and get it he promised it oh yeah sometimes you got to be a little jacob it don't matter how mean somebody is some part sometimes you've got it'll be a little shy stress and do whatever it takes to get that word if i have to sneak in before the service starts to get those message books off the front view after if i have to do whatever it takes now listen this might be a little bit hurtful or whatever but you see your eternal life is at stake your eternal life is at stake what does it matter if the preaching gets a little bit hurtful sometimes if it will save your soul and give you eternal life but brother bob that stings it stings when somebody preaches the truth extinct but the truth is what will set you free the truth is what will bring deliverance the truth is what rick causes you to realize that you're still that little eagle in the egg and you've got to come out you're not supposed to be in the egg and when the pre when the gospel is preached it causes you to realize and begin into desperation glory brother brown said it could compare compared to antichrist to answer christ's spirit the antichrist says yeah i believe casting out devils but they can't go all the way on to the holy ghost why they they get caught up in the intellectual mental conception i go to church i kind of understand what the preaching is about not really i don't have i know i don't have a full revelation they're kind of catching on to some things and they get they get satisfied with the mental interpretation their own mental conception now do you all realize hold on now y'all y'all lift up your weary heads wake up just for a second do you realize what the difference between an intellectual believer and a real holy ghost believer is right everybody starts off as an intellectual exactly everybody starts off why because you when you hear the word it goes in your head it goes in your thinking channel and you're thinking about it and you're pondering over it and you're battling it out wondering whether this is true or not wondering what jesus really meant by matthew 28 19 if that what how does that compare with acts 2 38 and you're battling it out and you're wondering you don't understand but then you see that's mental that's a mental conception a middle understanding that's not what saves you but you got to go through that you got to start off with an intellect we don't want to stay at intellectual and be a stand in intellectualism is the danger stay in there staying there is what judas began to get satisfied and he in his intellectual thinking he began to wonder now now john chapter 12 verses 4 to 6 is where judas really had a little turning point he got it all in his head that he knew more than jesus why why would you let that little woman come and pour pour out break that bottle of woman all over your feet which she could have done gone and done a whole lot more with that the bible says that judah said then saith one of his disciples judas his carrot simon's son which should not we should betray him why was not this oint my soul for 300 pence and given to the poor why was not and the bible says this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had to bag and bear what was put therein and he began in his own mind he began to think that he knew better than the preacher he knew better than the pastor he knew better than the ministers on how to get the holy ghost he knew better than somebody else preaching the true word and that's when you get that intellectual the intellectual life you begin to get satisfied don't get satisfied you remember brother brother brown said somebody came up to him and said well what more can i do but believe and brother and i said yeah that's all you can do but there's something else to follow that when god recognizes that you have believed then he will seal you with the baptism of the holy ghost so to be satisfied with an intellectual state is the worst thing right and one of the worst because you'll keep coming to church you'll keep sitting there on the pew being religious in a religious state sitting there thinking that you're right because you have a good mental understand mental conception thinking about what it's right to be a christian i'm a good person i'm a good person i can be a good christian and just go off and live any kind of way live in adultery live in filth and allow my family to live in filth and all that kind of stuff but let the holy ghost come and straighten out the correct interpretation of the word and actually live inside of you and see see what change it will be it will wrought in your life see there's a difference between something you can reason about and something that is alive there's a difference between something that you can reason about and question and ponder over and something that is alive and see that's what the holy ghost was given for to bring the word to life to bring it to life let me stop on this for a second i'm not stopping i just dwell on this now now my brother jesus was talking about when he began to be questioned about marriage and divorce marriage and divorce is one of those like off topic things because it's so it seems so hard as you go back i actually have been spending some more time listening to marriage and divorce and i believe i believe that that message has one of the is one of the greatest grace messages if you'll listen to it and the way that it was really meant somebody was telling me how they went to a church and on the on the ministry's wall back there in the back was a little sign that said don't preach about marriage and divorce and that's the way many people have treated marriage divorce because they're afraid of it but in that sermon do you know the true rev i believe the true revelation of marriage and divorce is as god is trying to fully unite with his bride you can't have a wedding unless the old man is fully dead and brother branham in that message lays out all the reasons why you can't get married if there's still a living if it's still a living partner all those things but now he's coming he's coming to bring grace to prove to you to show to you that the old man is dead and there's no reason why you can't be fully united with the bridegroom no no i didn't mean to get off of that but listen in mark chapter 10 verse 45 and they said moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and to put her away and this is the reason we get in our in our head we understand we understand marriage and divorce by our reasoning and jesus answered and said unto them for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept he wrote he allowed you to write a law of divorcement why because of your hard hearts what was the holy ghost given for the holy ghost was given to take that old stony heart out and make your heart put the love of god in that heart so that then you can interpret the word correctly so then when you have the love of god in your heart and you've got when you and your wife are both filled with the holy ghost and the love of god has preeminence in your home there ain't going to be no writing of divorcement there ain't going to be no writing of divorce but that's why jesus said but from the beginning of the creation god made them male and female for this call shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife why because in the beginning adam had love for his wife it was love and that's what god that's what the holy ghost is giving for to take us back so that we love one another not so that we can read those quotes in marriage and divorce bless god i've got a right to put my wife away because you won't bear me a child but if the holy ghost is in you it will interpret the word correctly so that you will love your wife and do like adam and try to redeem your wife back now it wasn't an attribute adam's attribute to do that to be able to do that but jesus christ could to redeem his wife back and that same attribute by the holy ghost will be and a man or a dog a son or a daughter of god that really has that love to try to redeem his spouse to try to talk to them in love to try to work with them and share the gospel with him am i okay y'all y'all believe what i'm saying even if you don't believe it just just ponder on these things i'm talking about i'm not talking about marriage and divorce someone i'm talking about love i'm talking about that's what the holy ghost was given for to make you love one another to make you love one another to make you love your spouse and that's what the holy ghost brother brown said the holy ghost interprets the word it gives the correct interpretation of the word it manifests the word it makes the dead letter live it brings forth fruits it brings every promise to pass that's what the holy ghost was given for the holy the purpose of the holy ghost is to bring forth a resurrection it's to raise up that's what the purpose was that's why adam abraham back in in the old testament had such confidence that god would raise up if he killed his son isaac that god would raise him up because he had confidence in this power of the resurrection that god that that same spirit that raised christ from the grave that same spirit that's that's an attribute of god the holy oak state raises up from the dead hebrews 11 says of whom it was said that and isaac shall i see be called accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from which also he received him in a figure abraham had confidence that there was resurrection power in that spirit and brother abraham said what is eternal life all that the father has given me will come to me all that comes to me i'll give him the holy ghost and i'll raise him up at the last day i will do it he said not no if and ans about it i will all that comes and i will give eternal life he will have to raise he will have to raise because he's got eternal life he has to come can't die no more than god can die do you see what the holy ghost does when the holy ghost comes into your life it raises the it raises the word to life in your life it actually causes it to live it raises you from the dead works that you do the dead works of of trying to do something for god or trying to just coming to church and trying to do something but it raises you from dead works to actually live serving a living god that god is actually living in you it raises it that's why as i was kind of studying on this i began to think back to that that old song remember i don't know if you've ever heard that song ain't no grave gonna hold me down they clawed eli now they turned it into a old bluegrass song with uh uh rock guitar howling in the background and everything if you're listening to the other day but it was originally originally a song that claude eli was a songwriter he got he got tuberculosis when he was real sick when he was real young about 12 years old and he just began the holy ghost came upon him there when he was dying of tuberculosis in his bed and he rose up from his bed and began to sing that song ain't no grave gonna hold my body down why because that's the power of the holy ghost to raise you up from the grave to raise you up from dead dark cold denominational ideas from rage to raise your up from your old way of thinking to raise you up from sin and despair to raise you up and if you were to die and go down into the grave and that eternal life was living in your soul that ain't no grave gonna hold that body down because that is what the holy ghost is given for the holy ghost was given to raise you up to raise you up that you cannot keep the revealed word in the grave you can't keep it down you can't keep it down you can't keep the revealed word down in about in the heart of a believer the devil can try to put you down and tell you oh it ain't for you don't even bother trying anymore but before long god will begin to raise that spirit up within you because why you can't keep it down that's what the holy ghost was given for that's why i was put into the church to show to prove to god that he loves you to prove that he's there for you he's with you and he said he'll never leave you for sake it doesn't matter how down you get how dark the world gets you cannot keep the word down you see the purpose the purpose is to manifest the same works brotherham said the purpose of sin of the holy ghost was for god to continue through a bunch of people to continually manifest god to the world not by creed not by the nomination but what by by the power of his resurrection that's what the holy ghost has given for the holy ghost is the power of the resurrection that you cannot keep down that the devil keep that king keep down by making his word real by taking his promise and standing on the side of the minority and believing god and watch the black skies move back and the power of god move in and take over that's what he wants brother brown said that's what the holy ghost was sent for that's what purpose he sent it for we know what it is now brother braham said and that's why he sent it doesn't that give you confidence this afternoon that now you know what the holy ghost is given for that should you know what the purpose is it's to manifest himself to continue through you to continue his life in you by the power of his resurrection by the power of that same life that raised up christ from the grave and if that same life lives in you then that same power will raise you up from your dead works it will give you power to withstand everything that the devil throws at you so then it becomes not you doing the work it's christ living in you so many people have made the gospel a book of rules and a book of works but what it is that's god living in you that you don't have to do anything that should liberate and free every believer that you don't have to do anything all you have to do is yield yourself to him to allow him to have full sway in you like brother louise was talking about this morning just fully yield yourself yield yourself as a vessel that he can come and inhabit and live in and how do you do it by surrendering to the word and how do you surrender to the word if you don't know the word get into the word and and and and give him give yourself to it brother i'm saying god came down made a body lived in it shed that blood for the sanctifying of this which absolutely expelled the guilt of sin and shame i'm just kind of going to kind of skip ahead a little bit brother brother said oh my i'm trying to find a place to i'm i'm going i'm going to stop right here we're going to read a few few more little things now the brother brother said the holy ghost the holy ghost to identify whether it's really in you he said the holy ghost will follow god's word to the letter now that don't mean that you know everything all at once but when you are presented with the word there's going to be a desire in you because something's been changed in you that i want to be right i want to follow god's word and you'll do everything you can to follow that word because brother braham said the holy ghost in you will follow god's word to the letter and a preacher behind the pupil that ain't got grace enough to preach it i doubt he's got it well that's what the holy ghost is for that's been one of my biggest grievances through my through my walk as a christian as people ministers that will draw back and won't share the full gospel i won't preach the whole thing but if the gospel is pre if the gospel is there if we've heard it then let's preach it glory brother i said the holy ghost is there to give unction to the preacher it's to set the church in order it's to unite us together with power it's to give holiness to the group the holy ghost is to bring a unity of spirit well what about that the same thing that was given there on on the day of pentecost when it first failed to bring up everyone in one accord to bring a unity of spirit is to unite us together with love brotherly love yeah and brother brown said now people look at me in the face a lot of hands went up you had the holy ghost see sure there was it's examining time it's examining to see whether you have truly received whether you meet the requirements and brother then begin to tell that story of the little fire the little jeffersonville fire truck and the little clarksville fire truck that pulled up at the fire and they began to squirt a little water here and squirt a little water there and then somebody from the big louisville fire company pulled up and he said they jumped off of that truck and they ran toward the fire because they knew what to do they knew how to put it out and they ran toward the fire and it almost sounded like an action scene he said they ran toward the fire and they tossed the axe ahead of them and before they got there the axe went through that window and they were coming to put that fire out because they were coming why they were coming committed they were coming he was coming to put that fire out with a vision he had caught he knew what his purpose was and that's how every believer should be as a musician come on forward and we'll end on this note every believer should that their desire to have the holy ghost should come with that level of commitment that we're not here to just squirt a little water here squirt a little water there but we're here to come to knowing knowing the way that it works knowing the channel that the holy ghost comes in and we're not coming just squirting a little water here and there but we're coming knowing what god has given us amen amen amen god is able aren't you glad that god has sent his holy ghost into the church the holy ghost isn't just something there's just a feeling or something that is the holy ghost is the life of god in you that's coming with a purpose a purpose to manifest himself in you amen everybody feel good everybody let's let's just stand and worship the lord that same spirit the brothers can bring
