[15:35] lesson and then the service this morning
[15:38] and all the musicians aren't aren't you
[15:40] just thankful to have musicians like
[15:42] this
[15:43] [Applause]
[15:48] it almost reminds me you know when when
[15:50] moses was given instruction to build the
[15:52] tabernacle of the
[15:53] of the lord and he began to tell people
[15:55] how to build and it just
[15:56] everybody just began to fall into place
[15:58] and knew exactly what they were supposed
[16:00] to do
[16:01] like a well-oiled machine just thank the
[16:04] lord to be
[16:04] in his house this afternoon this
[16:06] afternoon i want to speak to you from a
[16:07] little a little scripture in psalm
[16:09] chapter 42.
[16:10] if you want to go ahead and turn there
[16:12] and the brothers could pull that up and
[16:14] and just take for a topic thirsty souls
[16:16] because i know we got a lot of thirsty
[16:18] souls here this morning or this
[16:19] afternoon
[16:20] and a lot of people that that are maybe
[16:23] over
[16:24] seeking to overcome something need
[16:25] something in their life
[16:27] and so that's my prayer this afternoon
[16:29] is that something that will
[16:30] be said will help help you to encourage
[16:33] you and give you strength to overcome in
[16:34] this hour
[16:36] so let's just go to the lord in prayer
[16:39] well god we're so thankful lord to be
[16:40] able to gather together around your word
[16:42] lord and to be
[16:43] able to look into these things lord and
[16:44] i pray god that you'll come upon these
[16:47] treasures lord as we read them lord
[16:48] jesus and just quicken them to our
[16:50] hearts and
[16:50] lord we just invite you into the
[16:52] building and lord we know that the
[16:53] invitation will be accepted because
[16:55] we already know that you're here walking
[16:57] among the pews lord jesus
[16:59] we feel your presence lord and we know
[17:01] that you're here with us
[17:02] and lord we we we know that because not
[17:04] just because we feel something but
[17:06] because that we have a promise that we
[17:08] look to
[17:09] that where the twos and threes are
[17:10] gathered together in your name that
[17:11] you'll be in their midst
[17:13] so we know that you're here with us lord
[17:15] and we just ask lord that you'll bring
[17:17] the word
[17:18] that it won't just be some education
[17:19] that we're we're sharing this
[17:21] this afternoon but it'll be the
[17:22] quickened power of your word lord to
[17:24] change people's lives
[17:26] the lord to give them overcoming power
[17:28] in this hour that we're living in
[17:29] we ask lord jesus that you'll just come
[17:31] among us lord and do these things that
[17:33] we pray in the name of the lord jesus
[17:35] christ
[17:35] amen amen so psalm chapter 42 starts
[17:40] like this and verses verses one to four
[17:42] i'm just going to read down to verse
[17:43] four it says to the chief musician
[17:45] mascule for the sons of korra as the
[17:47] heart paneth after the water brooks
[17:49] so panteth my soul after thee o god
[17:53] my soul thirsteth for god for the living
[17:56] god
[17:57] when shall i come and appear before god
[18:00] my tears have been my meat day and night
[18:03] while they continually say unto me where
[18:05] is thy god
[18:07] when i remember these things i poured
[18:09] out my soul in me
[18:11] for i had gone with the multitude i went
[18:14] with them to the house of god
[18:16] with the voice of joy and praise with a
[18:19] multitude that kept holy day
[18:21] you can be seated the lord had his
[18:23] blessing to his word
[18:27] now brother branham really loved this
[18:29] this this chapter of
[18:30] psalm 42 we know that he took a lot of
[18:32] sermons out of this chapter he took
[18:34] deep calleth to the deep out of psalm 42
[18:36] and he took all of the
[18:37] just about all the sermons he preached
[18:38] on thirst out of this chapter psalm 42
[18:42] and when he when he would preach this he
[18:43] would explain that to kind of set the
[18:45] stage that
[18:46] that david was you know he was an
[18:48] anointed king he had been anointed for a
[18:50] purpose and then
[18:52] god god allowed circumstances to kind of
[18:54] take hold and saul ran over ran him out
[18:56] into the wilderness and he was running
[18:58] away from saul and he found a little
[19:00] cave
[19:01] the cave a badulum that he was he was
[19:03] hiding away in and a lot of the a lot of
[19:05] the psalms that he wrote
[19:06] came from that little cave that he was
[19:08] hiding away in and in this particular
[19:11] story brother branham describes that
[19:12] he was down in that cave and he looked
[19:14] down toward bethlehem
[19:15] and he said maybe when he maybe when he
[19:17] wrote that song that
[19:18] it was a hot day and the heat of the day
[19:21] maybe you could look imagine him looking
[19:22] the 15 miles down to bethlehem and the
[19:24] shimmering heat over the desert as he
[19:27] looked down and saw that
[19:28] phil that bethlehem had been taken over
[19:31] by the philistines
[19:32] that they had garrison that place and
[19:34] the thing that he was supposed to be the
[19:36] king of
[19:37] the thing that he was supposed to be
[19:38] ruling over had been taken over by the
[19:41] enemy
[19:42] and he looked and he maybe he thought
[19:44] i'm supposed to be king over that
[19:45] and one day one day i'm going to be a
[19:48] ruler over that but now i'm in this cave
[19:50] and you see god god brings us through
[19:52] situations like that where you
[19:54] if you look through the lives of all
[19:56] these heroes of the faith where they go
[19:58] through hard times and they go through
[19:59] struggles and things
[20:00] i want to maybe put maybe put a little
[20:02] statement in your mind this afternoon
[20:04] that songs are written in caves that
[20:07] maybe this song of your life is going to
[20:08] be written
[20:09] in a cave that you're going through
[20:11] maybe the cave of some kind of struggle
[20:12] and
[20:13] and songs are written and this song was
[20:15] written in a cave
[20:16] a cave of of of torment and
[20:20] and and david wondering what what was
[20:22] going on in his life and you see
[20:24] something something began to well up
[20:26] within him that that all the things that
[20:28] he could see
[20:29] could not quench the thirst that he had
[20:31] but there was a thirst within him a
[20:33] thirst
[20:34] that none of that nothing of this world
[20:36] could quench but there was a thirst for
[20:38] god
[20:39] and you see a lot of times it takes god
[20:41] god's got to put
[20:42] put us into a situation of distress to
[20:44] get us a place
[20:45] to a place where we realize the thing
[20:48] that we're really thirsting after
[20:51] brother brandon said david saul hated
[20:53] him and desired to kill him and
[20:54] and you know you think about all these
[20:56] heroes of the faith that jeremiah was
[20:58] was was buried in that whale was thrown
[21:00] in that well and joseph was hated of his
[21:03] brethren
[21:03] and jesus was crucified of the very
[21:05] people that he was sent to save
[21:07] crucified of them and and you see
[21:10] everybody everybody is dealing with
[21:12] something and down
[21:13] under underneath maybe the things that
[21:14] you see as people are coming in church
[21:17] everybody's got their own personal
[21:18] struggles you're dealing with something
[21:21] you're in other words you're thirsty
[21:22] and so i i want to maybe put that in
[21:24] your mind this afternoon and maybe
[21:26] that'll change the way that we deal with
[21:27] one another a lot of times
[21:29] maybe that'll change the way because
[21:30] every you know you know my
[21:32] my daughter she works at a at a um
[21:35] at a uh department store and you know
[21:38] she'll we'll talk about people come
[21:39] through the register and
[21:41] and they'll be you spiteful and angry
[21:43] and a lot of times hateful and they'll
[21:44] they'll argue be argumentative and
[21:46] things but everybody's dealing something
[21:48] with
[21:48] behind the scenes you don't know whether
[21:50] they're having spousal problems
[21:52] or whether they're dealing with cancer
[21:53] or where they're well you know
[21:55] zach used to work at ingles and this guy
[21:57] would come in every day and he would go
[21:58] back to the milk section and he'd just
[22:00] pour milk out and say i'm not going to
[22:01] buy it and
[22:02] do you don't know what's going now
[22:04] that's a that's a very angry thing to do
[22:06] it's something that you wonder what why
[22:08] would somebody do that but you don't
[22:10] know what is going on behind that
[22:12] person's life what it is it's thirsty
[22:14] souls
[22:15] thirst people are thirsting for
[22:16] something they're thirsting for
[22:18] something and sometimes it takes
[22:19] crossing the path of somebody that knows
[22:21] what you're thirsting for
[22:23] and so this afternoon maybe i want to
[22:25] spend some time to identify the thing
[22:27] that you're thirsting for maybe you
[22:28] haven't realized what that is yet
[22:31] maybe you're going through life
[22:32] wondering what that thing is that you're
[22:34] thirsting for and haven't real
[22:35] haven't recognized that the only thing
[22:38] that can quench that holy thirst that
[22:40] god has given you
[22:41] is god himself
[22:44] now now you know you see everybody
[22:47] everybody's going through work pressures
[22:48] and
[22:49] and unexpected life events and a lot you
[22:51] know sometimes even children children
[22:53] can cause
[22:54] pressures and when you're wondering
[22:56] you're wondering who are your children
[22:58] going to marry
[22:58] are they like isaac and rebecca are they
[23:00] going to marry are your children jacob
[23:02] and he's all going to marry somebody
[23:04] from down in the land somewhere that
[23:05] they don't need to be married
[23:06] you begin to wonder what what are they
[23:08] going to get the baptism in the holy
[23:09] ghost they begin to wonder and you see
[23:11] then
[23:11] all these pressures begin to build up
[23:13] and that's when you need to turn to the
[23:15] one that can quench that thirst
[23:17] instead of worrying about it instead of
[23:19] fretting about it
[23:20] you know maybe i could give you a little
[23:21] bit of life advice the best life advice
[23:24] you could have
[23:24] is when you want to see your children
[23:26] come to the lord and when you want to
[23:27] see something take place
[23:29] in your home is to just take your hands
[23:31] off of it
[23:32] because as long as you've got your hands
[23:34] on it god can't do nothing but if you'll
[23:36] take your hands off of it and let god go
[23:38] to work
[23:39] something will take place
[23:40] [Applause]
[23:44] and you think you think many times well
[23:46] the christian journey is supposed to be
[23:48] a fly a flowery bed of
[23:50] ease where we come to church and
[23:51] everybody's just wonderful with one
[23:53] another and
[23:53] and everything's just just uh just just
[23:56] flowers strewn in front of us and we
[23:58] just walked down a nice
[23:59] carpeted way to glory but that's not the
[24:02] way that god wants it to be
[24:04] you've got to have struggles and strife
[24:06] in your life to mold you into the
[24:08] character of the thing that god wants
[24:09] you to be
[24:10] you know just reading through hebrews
[24:12] chapter 12 verse 2 it says looking unto
[24:15] jesus
[24:15] the author and finisher of our faith who
[24:17] for the joy that was set before him
[24:19] endured the cross he endured the cross
[24:22] so that he would have the joy of
[24:24] seeing you coming to being seeing you
[24:27] manifest one of his attributes being
[24:29] manifested in your life
[24:30] and he went through all that all that
[24:32] struggle and humiliation and nakedness
[24:35] on the cross
[24:35] and bleeding out for you so that you he
[24:38] could have joy with you
[24:39] he said in hebrews 12 despising the
[24:42] shame and has set down at the right hand
[24:44] of the throne of god
[24:45] and also in hebrews chapter 12 it says
[24:47] for whom the lord loveth he chasten us
[24:50] and scourgeth every son whom he
[24:52] receiveth
[24:53] if ye endure chastening god dealeth with
[24:56] you as sons
[24:57] for what son is he whom the father
[24:59] chasteneth not
[25:01] in other words every person every born
[25:03] again believer
[25:04] every child of god is going to be
[25:06] chastened you are
[25:07] going to have rough times you are going
[25:10] to have spots where you wonder
[25:12] if everybody's turning against you you
[25:14] are going to have dry
[25:16] periods where you wonder why your
[25:18] prayers aren't being answered
[25:19] because every son that comes to god has
[25:22] got to be
[25:22] chastened and he said but if you be
[25:24] without chastisement where of all of
[25:26] partakers then are you bastards and not
[25:29] sons
[25:30] how do you know that you're not a
[25:31] bastard because you know where you came
[25:33] from
[25:34] you know why you're going through the
[25:36] things that you're going through because
[25:37] god
[25:38] is molding something within you listen a
[25:40] bastard doesn't know where he come from
[25:42] or what he's doing here
[25:44] he begins to get confused he doesn't
[25:46] know his heritage
[25:47] but somebody that's come from god
[25:49] himself they know
[25:50] but by a revelation that god is speaking
[25:53] to them and dealing with him and molding
[25:55] them into
[25:56] something you know you see why the
[25:57] statue of a perfect man is so important
[26:00] when you begin to understand when the
[26:01] mystery of godliness begins to open up
[26:03] to you you realize
[26:05] how god is dealing with you that he's
[26:07] taken you through trials and troubles
[26:09] he's taking you so he can mold you into
[26:11] something the image of himself
[26:14] you know what chastisement is
[26:17] chastisement is just chasing by the
[26:19] affliction
[26:20] of evils and calamities to chastise with
[26:23] blows to scourge
[26:24] of a pot father punishing his son of a
[26:26] judge ordering one to be
[26:28] scourged and then the dictionary it
[26:30] talks about how the chastisement is to
[26:32] mold your character
[26:34] to mold you to to shape you to shape you
[26:37] and what god wants you to be
[26:39] and when chastisement comes brother
[26:42] brown
[26:42] he's talking about david down in this
[26:44] cave he's talking about david down in
[26:46] this cave
[26:47] enduring things and god the reason why
[26:50] he was enduring things is because god
[26:52] wanted him to not look at the
[26:53] surroundings
[26:54] but to look up and when you go through
[26:56] trials and troubles it's time to look up
[26:58] look up to the one that will quench that
[27:00] holy thirst
[27:01] brother adam said many times god gets us
[27:04] in tight corners where we have to look
[27:05] up
[27:06] sometimes we even have to get on our
[27:08] back in the hospital or a bed somewhere
[27:10] so we can look up to see where the great
[27:12] blessings of god comes from
[27:14] and that's what he said as the heart
[27:15] panettheth after the water books
[27:17] so panteth my soul after the o god
[27:21] like in psalm 119 it says it is good for
[27:24] me
[27:24] it is good for me that i have been
[27:26] afflicted that i might
[27:27] learn thy statutes it's good for you to
[27:30] be afflicted that you might learn
[27:32] what god wants you to know the law of
[27:34] thy mouth is better under me than
[27:36] thousands of gold and silver that's what
[27:39] you'll learn when you come through
[27:40] afflictions
[27:41] and come through trials that god is the
[27:43] only satisfier of the
[27:47] and soul berman said david said my soul
[27:51] thirsteth for god for the living god
[27:54] for the living god when shall i come and
[27:56] a fear before god what he was thirsting
[27:59] for
[27:59] was to see the living god to see god
[28:02] alive
[28:03] where would you see god alive alive and
[28:05] his people
[28:06] a lot that's what we're thirsting for
[28:08] we're wanting to see
[28:09] god alive in us we're wanting to see god
[28:11] take over our members
[28:13] and use our bodies and use our eyes and
[28:15] use our feet and use our hands
[28:17] use us for his purpose to completely
[28:19] take us over
[28:20] now brother adam said not some
[28:22] historical this is what this is what uh
[28:26] this is what david was longing for and
[28:27] thirsting for not some historical or
[28:30] something that happened some years ago
[28:32] or some tale that somebody told but for
[28:34] the living god a god that's ever present
[28:37] isn't that what we're interested in now
[28:39] we've all heard the stories of brother
[28:41] branham we've heard the things that have
[28:43] been told but i want to relate to you
[28:45] this afternoon
[28:46] that those that those are tales of a
[28:48] living god that is still
[28:49] present today he's still a god that's
[28:51] able to heal
[28:52] and save and deliver he's still a god
[28:55] that's able to come on the scene
[28:56] and help you to overcome whatever you're
[28:58] going through
[29:01] if you're down in that little cave like
[29:02] david was if you're down in the cave of
[29:04] life
[29:05] wondering if god ever cares for you i
[29:07] want to declare to you tonight like
[29:09] brother brandon said
[29:10] he cares do you care he does care he
[29:13] cares for you
[29:14] even if you think even if you're down in
[29:16] the cave thinking he doesn't
[29:18] my soul thirsts for the living god
[29:20] brother said see there is something in
[29:22] you
[29:22] something in you that wants to see the
[29:24] moving of god
[29:26] your soul thirsts for it don't stop
[29:28] anything
[29:29] short of that you do you realize that's
[29:31] why we come to church
[29:32] that's why we gather here that's why
[29:34] that's one thing brother said in the
[29:36] sermon thirst
[29:37] that we all have in common is we're all
[29:40] thirsty for something
[29:41] we come from different backgrounds and
[29:43] if you could go maybe through this whole
[29:44] congregation with different
[29:45] different kind of beliefs different kind
[29:47] of ideas about things
[29:49] different kind of ideas about politics
[29:50] and whatever it is but we have all
[29:52] we have one thing in common and that's
[29:54] worth thirsting for something
[29:58] and if you're thirsty for something if
[30:00] you're thirsting for something there's
[30:01] sh
[30:01] that shows there's something to respond
[30:03] to that thirst
[30:04] if you're thirsty for something that
[30:06] shows that there's where there's a deep
[30:08] calling there's a deep to respond
[30:10] if there's something within you
[30:11] hungering and thirsting there's
[30:13] something that's able to feel that
[30:15] thirst now see what thirsty is
[30:19] webster brother brown said brother bram
[30:21] looked it up in the dictionary and he
[30:22] said here's what webster says
[30:24] it's a painful desire a painful when you
[30:26] want something so
[30:27] bad it becomes painful to you i i wonder
[30:30] tonight how many have
[30:31] a desire for god like that so painful
[30:35] that you've got to do something to get
[30:37] to him
[30:37] you've got to do whatever you can to get
[30:39] to church whatever you can to spend
[30:41] along with god in prayer
[30:43] whatever you can to carve out time to
[30:45] listen to the sermons
[30:46] whatever you can because it's a painful
[30:49] desire
[30:50] that's what thirsty is and brother said
[30:52] thirst
[30:53] thirst is a natural thing thirst is
[30:55] something that's
[30:56] natural it's natural to every person
[30:58] here sitting here today it's not
[31:00] something that only a particular group
[31:02] of people get
[31:03] it's not something that's only reserved
[31:05] for like a special class of people
[31:06] but this thirst is something that
[31:08] applies to every single individual on
[31:10] the earth
[31:11] do you remember why christ speak brother
[31:12] roman said that moses had that special
[31:14] that gift that every man has
[31:16] every person on the earth has a desi the
[31:19] ability to make a choice
[31:20] whether they will follow after god or
[31:22] whether they will not whether they will
[31:23] come
[31:24] whether they will look for the quenching
[31:26] of that thirst or not
[31:28] brother said it's just simply something
[31:30] that god
[31:31] has given us to give us a desire for
[31:34] something
[31:34] he gave you that desire he gave you that
[31:37] thirst so that you will know i need
[31:39] something and maybe you don't know what
[31:41] it is you need yet
[31:43] but that's what the ministry is for
[31:45] brotherhood said god put that thirst in
[31:47] you
[31:47] it is natural it is there for a reason
[31:50] it is
[31:50] something you should do it's something
[31:53] you should do and he talked about you
[31:55] know he talked about how that wherever
[31:56] he went in the
[31:57] around the world down in the jungles
[31:59] down in the different parts of
[32:02] native american culture wherever it was
[32:04] that had not heard the gospel yet
[32:06] they were trying to worship in whatever
[32:08] way they could they were trying to
[32:10] worship with their little fires and
[32:11] their smokes and their
[32:12] idols and all the different things
[32:14] because it's something unique
[32:16] something native and natural in man to
[32:18] desire to worship
[32:20] there's something in you that is going
[32:21] to make you worship even if you've never
[32:23] heard the gospel you're going to try to
[32:25] worship your big toe
[32:26] are you going to try to worship a stone
[32:28] are you going to try to worship
[32:29] something that's sitting on a mountain
[32:30] you're going to try to worship an eagle
[32:32] something in you is
[32:34] calling out crying to get to god because
[32:36] you were made to worship
[32:38] listen you and i'm made to sit like a
[32:40] bump on a pickle or something
[32:41] said you were made to worship you were
[32:44] created to worship you're a creator
[32:46] a creature of worship brother brahma
[32:49] said he said he said you say i wish
[32:51] i wish i could live a victorious life i
[32:54] wish i could have that joy i wish
[32:56] i wish all these things when you look at
[32:58] a believer that's living a godly life
[33:00] and you look at them and say i wish i
[33:01] could live a life like that
[33:03] and he said well the reason you are
[33:04] feeling that way it's the thirst
[33:06] in you it's that thirst in you that
[33:09] makes you
[33:10] want to long for that it's just a
[33:12] natural thing
[33:13] it's for every person to thirst for god
[33:16] every person
[33:17] every person that thirsts for god not
[33:19] just a special group of people
[33:21] not just a special little little sect or
[33:24] whatever
[33:24] it's for every single individual the
[33:26] first after god
[33:27] and if you if it's for every individual
[33:30] that thirsts for god that promises to
[33:32] every individual
[33:33] to whosoever will let him come
[33:39] now brother brown said now there is two
[33:41] different kinds of thirst
[33:43] there is the thirst physically and
[33:45] there's a third
[33:46] spiritually there's a thirst physically
[33:48] and there's a third spiritually
[33:50] and the thirst shows you you need
[33:52] something to live
[33:53] it shows that you need that your body is
[33:56] lacking something
[33:57] it shows all these things that brother
[33:59] branham outlines in the message thirst
[34:01] it shows all these things and and the
[34:03] thirst the third the
[34:04] these two thirst physical and spiritual
[34:06] air war went up with one another
[34:08] and they first began to kind of be
[34:10] manifested in that story back in genesis
[34:12] and
[34:12] in eden because you know in eden there
[34:15] was a river that ran through there and
[34:17] the message super sign brother branham
[34:18] identifies the river he compared
[34:20] a symbol of the river of life flowing
[34:23] through eden
[34:24] and man got through their education and
[34:26] intellectual ideas they
[34:27] they they began they they founded that
[34:30] city of babylon that also had a river in
[34:32] it the river euphrates
[34:34] so there you've got the river of life
[34:35] and the river of death
[34:38] the bible says the river went out of
[34:39] eden to water the garden and from this
[34:41] it was parted
[34:42] and became into four heads a symbol a
[34:45] symbol of an eternal river
[34:46] an eternal river that they had access to
[34:48] there in the garden of eden
[34:50] and here comes the serpent to deviate to
[34:53] to get their mind off of quenching that
[34:55] holy thirst
[34:56] that god had given into them he the
[34:59] serpent comes into the picture to get
[35:00] their
[35:01] their mind off of that third quenching
[35:03] that thirst that way
[35:04] and to look at something else you see
[35:07] you see the those two thirsts have been
[35:09] warring ever since the thirst for the
[35:11] physical
[35:12] and the thirst for the spiritual the
[35:14] thirst for the satan's tactic is to
[35:16] offer his alternative
[35:18] to quench that holy thirst and he'll
[35:20] give you his alternative by perverting
[35:22] perverting everything he can he'll
[35:24] pervert church
[35:25] so it looks like something different
[35:27] than the way god wants church to be
[35:30] he'll pervert fellowship so that it's
[35:32] different from the way that the
[35:33] fellowship that god
[35:34] wants you to have he'll pervert
[35:36] everything away from the way that god
[35:38] wants you to approach him
[35:40] brother adam said god created man to
[35:42] thirst for life
[35:43] that thirst that's in you is a creation
[35:45] of god and
[35:46] right and wrong is set before you as a
[35:48] tree of life and death in the garden of
[35:50] eden
[35:51] and god made you to thirst and how dare
[35:54] you take that blessed thirst
[35:55] that god has put in you to thirst after
[35:57] him and try to quench it on the things
[35:59] of the world
[36:00] god has made you to thirst and we're
[36:02] thirsting we're thirsting after a river
[36:05] that will never run dry
[36:06] like in psalm chapter 46 it says there
[36:08] is a river the streams whereof
[36:10] shall make glad the city of god
[36:14] let's meditate let's sit on that
[36:15] scripture for for just a second
[36:17] the streams were of shall make glad the
[36:19] city of god
[36:20] so out of that river are coming streams
[36:22] out of this holy river of eternal life
[36:24] are coming streams
[36:26] and where do those streams go out of
[36:27] that out of that river they go into your
[36:29] church
[36:30] they go into your family they go into
[36:32] your home they go in the individual life
[36:34] and the streams of eternal life are
[36:36] coming out
[36:36] and you're when you tap into that you're
[36:38] tapping into eternity
[36:40] do you see and that's that's how god
[36:42] wants you to quench that holy thirst
[36:44] by by coming and feasting coming and
[36:46] drinking drinking from that
[36:48] fountain of everlasting life until
[36:50] you're full in revelation chapter 22 it
[36:53] says he showed me a pure to john he
[36:55] showed me a pure river of water of life
[36:58] clear as crystal proceeding out of the
[37:00] throne of god and of the lamb
[37:02] and you see what we're on a journey for
[37:04] what we're what we're seeking for
[37:06] is a is to quench our holy thirst with
[37:09] that
[37:09] with that holy river with that river
[37:11] that where jesus said i i
[37:13] am that i am that fountain of life i'm
[37:16] the one that will quench your thirst
[37:20] now as the children of israel journey
[37:22] through the wilderness they got into
[37:23] some dry land
[37:24] they got into some dry times and and god
[37:26] had preparation for them along the way
[37:29] they began to murmur and complain and
[37:31] said we we want to go back
[37:32] we we've had enough we want to go back
[37:34] and so god
[37:36] moses i was reading the chapter where
[37:37] moses moses actually
[37:39] actually began to you talk about getting
[37:41] depressed he went and he told god i wish
[37:42] you'd just kill me
[37:44] how can i deal with these people i wish
[37:45] you just strike me down because how can
[37:47] i deal with these people that
[37:48] now you've delivered them and brought
[37:50] them out and they began to murmur and
[37:51] complain
[37:52] wondering if you were able to take us
[37:54] through and god spoke to moses as he
[37:56] said strike the rock and jo
[37:58] and moses smote the rock and out of that
[38:00] rock came living what came the water
[38:02] came the water that would quit
[38:03] how much water a hundred million liters
[38:06] of water a day is what people say
[38:07] in other words out of that fountain out
[38:10] of that fountain god has
[38:11] everything that you need you they might
[38:13] have wondered i wonder if god is able to
[38:15] take care of us
[38:16] just like maybe now you're wondering if
[38:17] god is able to take care of you
[38:19] but out of that fountain of everlasting
[38:21] life comes everything that you have need
[38:23] of
[38:23] you the baptismal holy ghost for your
[38:26] family the salvation of your home
[38:28] peace in your home i'm talking about
[38:29] peace where you don't have to war with
[38:31] your family
[38:32] all the time a peace where you can sit
[38:34] in the quiet solitude
[38:35] and meditate on the word of god joy joy
[38:38] where you're happy despite everything
[38:40] that's going on in the world
[38:41] that's what comes out of that fountain
[38:43] of everlasting life
[38:44] and you see they begin to murmur they
[38:46] begin to murmur and wonder if god had
[38:48] provision for them and they began to
[38:50] desire to go back
[38:53] you see god is restoring us back to what
[38:56] we
[38:57] lost but to desire to to give all that
[39:00] up and go
[39:01] back why would you ever want a desire to
[39:03] give that up why would you want to go
[39:05] back to egypt
[39:06] why would you want to go back to a
[39:07] fallen condition with all that you have
[39:09] seen
[39:10] when we have the pillar of fire and
[39:12] photographs when we have
[39:13] we have all the problems when the word
[39:15] has been opened up to us
[39:16] today like never before the entire bible
[39:19] has been opened up to us
[39:21] the nominations have pondered at the
[39:22] things that we read about but now it's
[39:24] laid plain before us
[39:26] why would you want to go back why would
[39:28] you want to go back to a fallen
[39:30] condition in eden
[39:31] why would you want to go back to bondage
[39:32] in egypt where you're bound
[39:34] by sin and bound up by by living in an
[39:37] immoral existence
[39:38] by your living in nakedness with bob's
[39:40] hair and shorts on
[39:42] why would you want to go back again to
[39:43] that why would you want to go back to
[39:45] nakedness and fig leaves
[39:47] where you all you have to cover yourself
[39:48] as a religion why would you want to go
[39:50] back to that
[39:51] forgive me for yelling why would you
[39:54] want to go back to the fair sacred
[39:55] pharisaical blindness
[39:57] well they didn't even know what they
[39:58] worshipped the samaritans didn't even
[40:00] know what they worshipped the pharisees
[40:02] why would you want to go back why would
[40:04] you want to go back to a denominational
[40:06] trip
[40:06] pest house well you don't even know what
[40:08] you believe why would you want to go
[40:10] back to a trinitarian idea
[40:12] why would you want to go back to short
[40:14] hair and beer drinking and filthy living
[40:16] and confusion
[40:17] and anything goes idea why would you
[40:20] want to go back when god has set us free
[40:22] that's what the message is for is to set
[40:24] you free to set you free and to give you
[40:26] freedom
[40:30] do you remember when brother brown
[40:31] preached the sermon on the jubilee year
[40:33] and he talked about how the slave
[40:35] when that message would go forth a slave
[40:37] could drop his whole
[40:38] and go free freedom and that's what the
[40:41] message is to give you freedom
[40:42] not to set you in bondage of a
[40:44] legalistic idea but to give you freedom
[40:46] to know who you believe
[40:48] and they know that god will give will do
[40:50] great exploits says the bible says
[40:52] this message has been sent to give us
[40:54] freedom
[40:55] if you'll get into the message and find
[40:57] out what the message really is about
[40:58] you'll be freer than you've ever been
[41:00] you'll be free to worship god in the way
[41:02] that you were meant to worship god
[41:03] you'll be free to serve god and the
[41:05] power and the resurrection
[41:07] you'll be free to serve god and live a
[41:08] godly christian life
[41:10] you'll be free from all that stuff that
[41:12] held you down free that
[41:13] that's what the jubilee year is that's
[41:15] what the jubilee trumpet is when that
[41:17] jubilee trump is sounded
[41:18] it went from ever from the from the
[41:21] highest mountain down from it to every
[41:22] minister
[41:23] ever down to the lower slaves sounding a
[41:26] message of freedom
[41:27] that you were free and you could go free
[41:29] that you didn't have to be bound by
[41:31] change of fear and sin anymore but you
[41:33] could be
[41:34] free that's what this message is this
[41:37] message is not just about a legalistic
[41:39] doctrine
[41:39] it is freedom
[41:48] ah y'all pardon me i i don't want me to
[41:50] scream
[41:52] what would you go back to and jude
[41:55] chapter one he says
[41:56] he says clouds they all without water
[41:58] clouds like what
[42:00] what kind of a cloud without water
[42:01] that's a useless cloud
[42:03] a cloud without water is just something
[42:05] for appearance sake
[42:06] something floating through the air
[42:07] something with nothing behind it
[42:09] no substance just a cloud floating
[42:11] around
[42:12] caring about a winds caring about every
[42:14] time something puffs you you go this way
[42:16] and then you go that way
[42:17] you're just carried about by winds you
[42:20] instead of being steadfast on the rock
[42:22] of salvation you're just carried about
[42:23] by you don't even know what
[42:25] trees whose fruit withereth without
[42:27] fruit a tree with the fruit withering on
[42:30] it
[42:30] and then he just says without fruit
[42:32] there's no fruit
[42:33] somebody that you walk up to and say
[42:35] tell me your doctrine what do you
[42:36] believe
[42:37] what do you stand for what do you
[42:38] believe in holiness that they don't
[42:40] stand for nothing
[42:41] trees without fruit twice dead plucked
[42:44] up by the roots
[42:45] raging waves of the sea foaming out
[42:47] their own shame
[42:48] wandering stars to whom has reserved the
[42:51] blackness of darkness forever
[42:53] why would you go back to that why would
[42:55] you go back to that in luke 9 62 jesus
[42:59] said unto him no man
[43:01] no man having put his hand to the plow
[43:03] and looking back
[43:04] is fit for the kingdom of god no man
[43:06] having started out on his journey
[43:08] having started out with an effort for
[43:10] the kingdom of calm of god
[43:12] and turning back no man turning back is
[43:14] fit for the kingdom of god
[43:16] if you put your hand to the plow put
[43:18] your hand ready to go into the field of
[43:19] harvest
[43:20] ready to go and serve god and you begin
[43:22] to look back you're not fit for the
[43:23] kingdom of god
[43:25] remember lost wife lost wife he was
[43:27] delivered it was set free
[43:29] and she turned back and looked back and
[43:31] turned into a pillar of salt
[43:35] to control towers now we find god gives
[43:37] the control tower to you
[43:39] to give to you the things that you need
[43:41] now the control tower in you is what
[43:43] directs you
[43:44] and this thirst runs in on this control
[43:46] tower and tells you what you have need
[43:48] of
[43:48] spiritually speaking the control tower
[43:50] in the body and in the soul also there
[43:53] was a control tower in the body that
[43:54] tells you the need that's needed in your
[43:56] body
[43:57] and it's brought to you by thirst also
[43:59] there was a control
[44:00] tower in your soul that tells you the
[44:02] spiritual things that you have need of
[44:04] something in your spirit and you by this
[44:06] can tell what kind
[44:08] of a life is controlling you do you
[44:10] realize that you can actually discern
[44:11] within your own being what kind of a
[44:13] life is controlling you
[44:15] how you're being controlled by what kind
[44:17] of a thirst that you have
[44:19] if you don't desire to come to church it
[44:22] throws everything into question
[44:23] what's controlling you if you don't
[44:25] desire to fellowship with god and
[44:28] defeased at the table of life then what
[44:30] is what is controlling you
[44:31] there's a third the thirst determine the
[44:33] thirst shows
[44:34] what is controlling you and you see
[44:36] there's a thirst physical
[44:38] the thirst physical will crave water in
[44:40] the desert the third spiritual will
[44:42] crave eternal life
[44:43] brother said there's a controlled tower
[44:45] in the body that tells you the need
[44:46] that's needed in your body
[44:48] and it's brought to you by thirst also
[44:50] there is a control tower in your soul
[44:52] that tells you the spiritual things
[44:54] that you have need of something in your
[44:56] spirit and you by this can tell what
[44:58] kind of a life is controlling you
[45:00] when you can see what your desires are
[45:02] brother adam said then you can tell by
[45:04] that
[45:05] what kind of something that's in you
[45:07] that's creating this desire that you
[45:09] have
[45:10] when you can see your desire when you
[45:11] can see what kind of desire you can tell
[45:13] what's on the inside
[45:15] he said there is a certain thing that
[45:16] you thirst for and it can tell you
[45:18] and your soul what this desire is by the
[45:21] nature of the thirst that you have
[45:23] in other words if you thirst for the
[45:25] word and you thirst for church and you
[45:27] thirst for fellowship and you thirst for
[45:29] being around unbelievers and you thirst
[45:31] for going to church even when you're on
[45:32] vacation
[45:33] and you thirst for songs and you thirst
[45:35] for praise and you thirst for worship
[45:37] you want to praise god and you want to
[45:39] serve him in the power of his truth
[45:41] you want to you want to you thirst for
[45:43] prayer you thirst for that alone time
[45:45] that that shows what's on the inside but
[45:47] if you thirst for moody movies and you
[45:49] thirst for parties and you thirst for
[45:51] drugs and you thirst for alcohol and you
[45:53] thirst for strife
[45:54] and you thirst for hatefulness and you
[45:56] thirst for enmity that shows what's
[45:58] driving you on the inside
[46:00] the battle between these two thirsts is
[46:02] raging on
[46:04] you see brother said the flesh starts to
[46:07] satisfy the desires that's in the body
[46:09] let me take that off this heavy weight
[46:11] that precepts me
[46:16] and this the flesh thirsts to satisfy
[46:18] the desires that's in the body
[46:20] and the spirit desires for the things
[46:22] that's in the soul
[46:23] desire is and many times these war
[46:26] against
[46:27] one against the other we find there was
[46:29] a great trouble today that too
[46:31] many people try to live between these
[46:34] two desires do you realize what the
[46:35] devil is trying to do
[46:37] let me just kind of put something in
[46:38] your mind here the devil is trying to
[46:39] divert you
[46:40] from the real thirst quencher he's
[46:43] trying to divert you let's see let's see
[46:45] how he does now
[46:46] romans chapter 7 verse 18 to 21 is a
[46:48] scripture we're all well acquainted with
[46:50] and in this scripture paul is talking
[46:52] about the war between these two thirsts
[46:54] and he said for i know that in me and he
[46:56] said that is in my flesh
[46:58] dwelleth no good thing for to will is
[47:00] present with me
[47:01] but how to perform that which is good i
[47:03] find not
[47:04] for the good that i would i do not but
[47:06] the evil which i would not that i do
[47:09] now if i do that i would not it is no
[47:11] more i that do it but sin that dwell
[47:13] offend me
[47:14] i find in a law that when i would do
[47:16] good evil is present with me so that we
[47:18] got a law
[47:19] that when you would do good evil good
[47:20] and evil are always present
[47:22] and brother adam explained this in the
[47:24] message hearing recognizing acting on
[47:26] the word of god
[47:27] that you'll as long as there is good
[47:29] you're always going to have evil
[47:30] alongside it
[47:31] you're going to have good and evil in
[47:32] the church you might have good and evil
[47:34] at work together
[47:35] good and evil even in your own members
[47:37] where i saw one one
[47:38] somebody on the internet kind of
[47:40] paralleled that your soul is the
[47:41] believer the spirit is the make-believer
[47:43] and then your flesh is the unbeliever
[47:45] well maybe that's a really good analogy
[47:46] because then your your members are
[47:48] warring against one another the
[47:49] unbeliever of your flesh is warring
[47:51] against the believer of your soul
[47:53] and they're always in conflict one
[47:54] another and whichever one wins is the
[47:56] one that you feed in them the most
[47:58] whichever one wins is the one that you
[48:00] quench the thirst of the most
[48:02] in other words if you're if you're
[48:03] feeding on movies instead of
[48:05] the word of god then that's the one
[48:06] that's going to begin to take over it's
[48:08] the one
[48:09] be the one that that begins to overpower
[48:13] the brotherhood said that where there is
[48:15] good there is evil where there is right
[48:17] there is wrong and we will never
[48:19] no matter what our environment may be
[48:21] ever be able to shake ourselves
[48:23] from the presence of evil evil the
[48:25] sinner will never be able to shake away
[48:27] from the christian
[48:28] the christian from the center now now
[48:30] let's just let's just dwell on that for
[48:32] a moment because this is something
[48:33] that's so powerful
[48:34] for the young believer to understand in
[48:36] other words for anybody to understand
[48:38] really when you begin to do something
[48:39] for god
[48:40] when you begin to step out in faith
[48:42] watch evil show up
[48:44] when you begin to try to do something
[48:45] for god when when you when you first get
[48:47] the baptism in the holy ghost watch
[48:49] somebody show up and say you ain't got
[48:50] nothing
[48:51] when you first when you first give your
[48:52] life to the lord watch somebody show up
[48:54] and tell you
[48:55] you ain't got nothing nothing happened
[48:56] when you're seeking healing in your body
[48:58] somebody will show up and tell you
[49:00] i i don't know you better go to the
[49:01] doctor and and line up all these reasons
[49:03] for you to take pills and medicines and
[49:05] all these kind of things
[49:06] and i'm not against pills and medicines
[49:08] and brother brown wouldn't but but
[49:09] listen you gotta
[49:10] you gotta keep your eye on the word
[49:12] above all else because when you begin to
[49:14] rely
[49:14] on medicine to function daily even when
[49:16] you begin to rely on coffee and things
[49:18] you're getting the law away from the
[49:20] right thing
[49:23] let me get back to my topic
[49:28] you see you'll never be able to get away
[49:30] from good when good is there
[49:31] evil is always going to be there so
[49:34] that's that's part of being a christian
[49:36] part of being in your cave is when
[49:38] you're going through like when you begin
[49:39] to praise and
[49:40] praise god and shout and maybe run
[49:42] around at a camp meeting or somebody
[49:43] somebody will be there
[49:44] watching in on the internet and saying
[49:46] look at those bunch of holy rollers
[49:48] brother branham actually said that in
[49:49] one of his sermons he said somebody will
[49:51] say
[49:52] you're a bunch of holy rollers somebody
[49:53] will say that and
[49:56] you've got to be able to take the
[49:58] criticism
[50:00] somebody will be there to say you didn't
[50:02] get nothing somebody will be there to
[50:04] say
[50:05] why don't you just go to the doctor and
[50:06] be done with it somebody will be there
[50:09] and say the church was going real smooth
[50:11] until you showed up
[50:12] somebody will be there to say that
[50:14] somebody will say what
[50:16] what are you even doing here somebody
[50:18] will be i don't even
[50:19] i don't even think you got anything real
[50:21] i don't even think i don't even think
[50:22] you know what you're talking about
[50:24] somebody will say you don't you can't do
[50:26] nothing right because
[50:27] it's it's ordained of god it's actually
[50:29] a promise in the bible that there are
[50:31] going to be offenses
[50:32] there's a promise in the bible that
[50:34] they're going to be offenses
[50:35] and what matters what matters is not the
[50:38] offense is when they come
[50:39] but what matters is how you deal with it
[50:42] how you deal with it you can bottle it
[50:44] up and bottle it up and bottle it up
[50:45] until there's an explosion
[50:47] and shrapnel goes loose shrapnel just
[50:49] explodes everywhere or you can do what
[50:50] brother aaron said and let off the
[50:52] pressure
[50:52] let it off by feeding on the word let it
[50:54] off by prayer
[50:55] let it off by coming to jesus let off
[50:58] the pressure by throwing everything on
[50:59] him
[51:00] cast all your cares on him who careth
[51:02] for you
[51:04] now brother brown said that when you're
[51:05] trying to do something that's worthwhile
[51:07] go to make an effort to do something
[51:08] that's good
[51:09] then you find out that there is the
[51:11] devil on every hand
[51:12] just to upset you everything that you
[51:14] and that's one good thing that i'd like
[51:16] to say this
[51:17] that the christians might know that when
[51:18] you are when you are starting to do
[51:20] something
[51:21] and there is something always trying to
[51:23] upset you and doing it
[51:25] do it anyhow that's the devil there
[51:27] trying to keep you from doing what's
[51:29] right now i'm not talking about doing a
[51:31] lot of tommy rod
[51:32] i'm talking about doing something that
[51:33] the word says you should be doing like
[51:36] getting the baptism in the holy ghost if
[51:38] the word says that promise is for you
[51:40] then you can have it
[51:41] it don't matter what all the naysayers
[51:42] and the critics say it don't matter how
[51:45] all the people that say you're just a
[51:46] bunch of holy rollers and all this kind
[51:48] of stuff it doesn't matter what they
[51:49] throw in your face
[51:50] you just look into the word and accept
[51:52] that promise
[51:54] brother and said you let a young convert
[51:56] come tonight do they alter somewhere
[51:58] here in this tabernacle
[51:59] across the nation and just remember just
[52:01] remember tomorrow mother will be more
[52:03] angry
[52:04] than she ever was dad will be all upset
[52:06] and all the school kids
[52:08] and everything just goes wrong because
[52:10] it's satan trying to get you to turn
[52:12] around
[52:13] it's satan trying to get you because why
[52:15] there's a law that where there is good
[52:17] there is going to be evil present
[52:19] as soon as you try to do something good
[52:21] evil is there
[52:22] when they find out they're trying to do
[52:24] something and everything is just
[52:25] blocking it off
[52:26] on both sides they say it might not bend
[52:28] the will of the lord and brother
[52:30] said see don't let the level devil lie
[52:33] to you like that
[52:35] do you see how important it is to be
[52:37] able to recognize when it's the devil
[52:38] talking to you
[52:40] a lot of people can't recognize when
[52:41] it's the devil talking to you
[52:43] now i want to i want to maybe share
[52:44] something that's really perplexing to a
[52:45] lot of people but the devil can speak to
[52:47] you
[52:48] through people at church or people in
[52:49] your family or people your friends
[52:52] the devil can speak and how does he
[52:53] speak he can actually speak
[52:55] now this might choke you a little bit
[52:57] but he can get in the
[52:58] reasoning and the memory of a born-again
[53:00] believer and go to twisting their mind
[53:02] around on the inside and they begin to
[53:04] dwell on it
[53:05] that maybe maybe brother aaron doesn't
[53:07] like me or maybe brother luis doesn't
[53:08] want to go out
[53:09] to eat with me or something or and and
[53:11] maybe i'll get to rolling that around in
[53:13] my head
[53:14] and meditating on it and before long i'm
[53:16] sharing all kinds of nonsense to other
[53:18] people
[53:18] i'm just spreading stuff and you see you
[53:21] see that's the devil
[53:22] that's how the devil works so listen
[53:24] when somebody it doesn't
[53:25] listen it doesn't even matter if i go
[53:27] outside this building and tell you
[53:29] something to contrary to the word of god
[53:31] don't you listen to it you only listen
[53:33] to the word of god keep your eyes
[53:35] steadfast on the word of god
[53:38] now brother bob show me an example of
[53:40] this in the bible now if you could
[53:41] if you would go to read in matthew
[53:43] chapter 16 verse 17
[53:46] they're all sitting around and and they
[53:48] began to jesus begins to pose that
[53:50] question who who do you say that i the
[53:52] son of man am now listen to this how i'm
[53:54] laying out here
[53:55] let's listen just for a second bless and
[53:57] and jesus answered and said unto him
[53:59] blessed art thou he began to ask
[54:01] ask them who do you say that i am and
[54:03] peter had a revelation
[54:04] that jesus said came from the father
[54:07] that he gave him a revelation of who
[54:09] that was and he said blessed art thou
[54:11] simon bar jonah for flesh and blood hath
[54:13] not revealed it unto thee
[54:14] but my father which is in heaven and i
[54:16] say also unto thee that thou art peter
[54:18] and upon this rock i will build my
[54:20] church
[54:20] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[54:22] against the gates of hell will not
[54:24] prevail against the revelation
[54:25] now keep on reading down that down that
[54:27] chapter keep on reading a few more
[54:29] verses
[54:29] and before long you'll come to the place
[54:31] where peter's saying something that he
[54:33] needs to be rebuked for
[54:35] he began jesus began to share right
[54:37] after peter had made that
[54:38] made that statement of faith that
[54:40] statement of his revelation that i know
[54:42] who you are
[54:43] and jesus echoed back that the father
[54:45] has given you this revelation
[54:47] and then then then jesus began to share
[54:50] with them about how he was going to have
[54:51] to die and give his life
[54:52] and peter had a really good idea he had
[54:55] a really good idea in his mind
[54:57] and he shared it he said he said be it
[55:00] far from the lord this shall not be unto
[55:02] thee
[55:03] and jesus turned and said unto peter get
[55:05] thee behind these satan
[55:06] get thee behind me satan thou art an
[55:08] offense unto me
[55:09] why because anything that is contrary to
[55:12] the word that will take you away from
[55:14] the real first quencher is not from god
[55:16] it's eternally not from god
[55:18] anything anything that deviates from the
[55:20] word of god it doesn't matter who it's
[55:22] coming from
[55:23] it's it's not from god and you see
[55:26] you you see now what god is doing
[55:28] through the opening of the seals and
[55:29] the revelation of the statue of a
[55:31] perfect man and he's weeding
[55:33] weeding out all that stuff from you so
[55:35] that you're just speaking what god
[55:37] wants you to see so that you recognize
[55:39] when the devil is coming with some alive
[55:41] he is
[55:42] when he comes with something some fault
[55:44] so trying to take away your blessing
[55:45] or kind of heap something additional on
[55:48] top of the revelation of god
[55:50] he wants to bring you to a place where
[55:52] you know what you believe
[55:54] and you're not going to fall to nothing
[55:56] that the devil throws at you
[55:58] you see now while brother brown said
[56:00] there you can get to a place where the
[56:01] devil can circle you and
[56:03] and throw everything he can at you and
[56:04] he can't he can't get to a real
[56:06] adopted son of god a son of god that's
[56:09] sealed in
[56:10] sealed in with the revelation of who who
[56:12] he is and what god wants him to be
[56:14] amen you see when paul said when i would
[56:18] do good then evil is not
[56:21] and brother see the this is what this is
[56:24] what
[56:25] this is what david was thirsting for as
[56:27] the heart paneth after the water book
[56:29] so panteth my soul after thee he was
[56:31] panning panning for something to quench
[56:33] that thirst
[56:34] panning for something to make it real a
[56:36] living reality
[56:37] and brother adam said he said now that
[56:39] deer knows when when a deer is shot when
[56:41] a deer is wounded
[56:42] like a like a believer or somebody when
[56:44] they're wounded in sin and they know
[56:46] that they're going to die that thirst
[56:48] thirst kicks in to show that deer that
[56:50] he better get to water
[56:52] thirst kicks in with a believer when
[56:53] they're coming to church and they
[56:54] realize there's something lacking in
[56:56] them
[56:56] and they know that they've got to get to
[56:58] something or else they're going to die
[57:00] now brother brown said now that deer
[57:01] knows unless he finds water he's gone he
[57:04] just can't live
[57:05] i've tracked him many times after being
[57:07] wounded when he hits a stream of water
[57:09] he will cross in and get a drink go up
[57:11] over the hill
[57:12] come back down cross get a drink of
[57:14] water and go up and he's he says
[57:16] you'll never catch him as long as he's
[57:17] staying with that stream
[57:19] you the devil can never catch you as
[57:21] long as you stay with the river of life
[57:24] he can never get a hold of you as long
[57:26] as you stay with a satisfying portion
[57:28] he can never get a hold of you and
[57:30] brother said now the deer knows that so
[57:32] he'll stay
[57:33] right with the water where he can get to
[57:35] it right quick
[57:36] now could you imagine a deer with his
[57:38] nose up he has been called out somewhere
[57:40] where there is no water
[57:41] the deer knows because he's that that
[57:43] thirst has kicked in he knows that he
[57:45] needs something
[57:45] and so brother brown said that thirsting
[57:47] you as an alarm it's an alarm that you
[57:50] need something that thirst is an alarm
[57:52] that you're gonna die if you don't get
[57:54] something quick the thirst is an alarm
[57:56] that's going off
[57:57] and it's an alarm with a snooze button
[57:59] and you can keep reaching over and
[58:00] hitting that button and it'll go off and
[58:02] you can every time the alarm goes off in
[58:04] church maybe
[58:04] maybe the preacher is preaching a real
[58:06] inspired message and you realize
[58:08] you can feel that pulse setting down in
[58:10] your heart god is speaking to you
[58:12] god is light he's moving on you and
[58:14] something begins to take place and then
[58:15] you hit that snooze button
[58:17] hit that snooze button and back to sleep
[58:18] you go and after a while
[58:20] just like a real alarm clock you keep
[58:22] hitting that snooze button
[58:23] and after a while it stops going off and
[58:26] it won't go off anymore it gets
[58:28] weaker and weaker and weaker what is the
[58:30] alarm the alarm is
[58:31] is that depression is creeping in on you
[58:34] it's sneaking up on you it's taking over
[58:35] your life
[58:36] but there's something that can quit that
[58:38] thirst they get rid of that depression
[58:40] those sinful acts are killing you but if
[58:42] you'll let that thirst be quenched by
[58:44] the holy spirit of god
[58:45] he'll take care of you brother brown
[58:47] talked about the hounds of hell the
[58:49] hounds of hell are after you
[58:50] that's what that thirsty is the alarm
[58:52] the thirst the alarm thirst
[58:54] that you're about to die and it's time
[58:57] to wake up and do
[58:58] something it's time to wake up like the
[59:00] two leprous people and
[59:01] the bible talks about that when they're
[59:02] sitting there in the gate and they
[59:04] realize they came to their senses we'd
[59:06] better get up and do something
[59:07] and they got up and went and they
[59:09] realized that the battle had already
[59:10] been overcome
[59:11] because god had already fought their
[59:13] battle for them
[59:15] brother graham said in the message
[59:16] thirst he said unless i can find you
[59:18] lord
[59:18] i'll perish i can't go unless i find you
[59:21] and when a man or a woman boy or girl
[59:23] gets that kind of a thirst for god
[59:26] he's going to find something when you
[59:28] get that kind of a thirst for god you're
[59:30] going to find something
[59:31] but look what what does the devil want
[59:32] to do what does the devil want to do
[59:34] with that thirst he wants to desensitize
[59:36] you to the thirst
[59:37] he wants to desensitize you to the alarm
[59:40] maybe
[59:41] maybe all the theology sometimes all the
[59:43] theology begins to heap up
[59:45] and you begin to feel like you can't
[59:46] understand it and it begins to
[59:48] desensitize you to where you don't
[59:50] respond
[59:50] you don't respond anymore you just fail
[59:52] to respond that thirst begins to it gets
[59:55] begins to get
[59:56] you're putting the snooze button on and
[59:58] you begin to say maybe i have need of
[59:59] nothing
[1:00:00] that's echoing back that that that
[1:00:02] layout of seeing spirit i don't need
[1:00:04] nothing i have need of nothing and you
[1:00:06] begin to say maybe because you're not
[1:00:07] responding anymore
[1:00:09] you're not responding to the thirst that
[1:00:10] this is boring this is a whole lot of
[1:00:12] boring stuff that's being preached
[1:00:14] i have need of nothing and i sure don't
[1:00:16] need this and it becomes boring to you
[1:00:18] and and you begin to think that i'm i'm
[1:00:20] beginning not to realize that you're
[1:00:21] poor and rich
[1:00:22] and poor and rich and naked and and fine
[1:00:25] with that
[1:00:26] poor and rich and naked and okay with
[1:00:28] that okay with being in that condition
[1:00:31] you know you can even come to a place
[1:00:33] where you so desensitized to the word
[1:00:35] that maybe you don't even want the
[1:00:36] service to be successful maybe when the
[1:00:39] preacher begins to kind of stutter and
[1:00:40] sputter a little bit
[1:00:41] there's something in you you just want
[1:00:43] the whole service to fall flat
[1:00:44] but you know what a real mature believer
[1:00:46] when sick things begin to kind of
[1:00:48] stutter and whatever
[1:00:49] they want something from god and they'll
[1:00:50] begin to cry out and they'll begin to
[1:00:52] pull on the gift
[1:00:53] they'll begin to say amen preach that
[1:00:55] gospel you know
[1:00:56] i i was talking to a brother that would
[1:00:58] preach over in africa and stuff and he
[1:01:00] said you know those believers in africa
[1:01:02] they believe that when they're coming to
[1:01:03] church they are actually hearing from
[1:01:05] god
[1:01:06] they're not just coming to a lodge
[1:01:07] they're not just coming for the coffee
[1:01:09] they're not just coming for some donuts
[1:01:10] but they're actually coming
[1:01:11] to overcome something in their life
[1:01:13] they're coming to hear from god
[1:01:15] they hadn't put the snooze button on
[1:01:17] they're still they're not desensitized
[1:01:19] to the word but then when the word is
[1:01:21] preached
[1:01:21] something is actually taking place in
[1:01:23] their life and when the minister may
[1:01:25] become begins to stutter and everything
[1:01:27] they start pulling because they
[1:01:28] know that there's a fountain pushing
[1:01:30] behind that minister
[1:01:31] and if they can just pull and draw like
[1:01:33] an old pump something's going to come
[1:01:35] out
[1:01:37] listen that's when you really start
[1:01:38] going to church as when you when you
[1:01:40] know that you're going to get something
[1:01:42] when you want something when you know
[1:01:43] that there's a fountain there a fountain
[1:01:45] to draw from
[1:01:46] there's a gift that you can pull on
[1:01:48] there's something there that you're
[1:01:49] ready to receive
[1:01:50] you're holding your bowl out and you're
[1:01:51] ready to receive and take on something
[1:01:53] take on something that will change your
[1:01:55] life and change your family
[1:01:58] now now just as an exercise i began i
[1:02:00] began
[1:02:01] to run a search in the message of all
[1:02:02] the times all the places
[1:02:04] now y'all gonna laugh at what i searched
[1:02:07] for
[1:02:08] but i searched for wake up
[1:02:11] brother brother bro all the times that
[1:02:15] brother brown
[1:02:15] said it's time to wake up and i'm tying
[1:02:18] that in now
[1:02:19] not because actually everybody's awake
[1:02:21] praise god everybody's waiting
[1:02:22] everybody's doing it
[1:02:27] not because of that because see the
[1:02:29] devil wants you to go to sleep
[1:02:31] that's why there's 10 sleeping there's
[1:02:32] five sleeping versions
[1:02:34] because they go to sleep and they don't
[1:02:36] realize what's taking place
[1:02:37] they go to sleep and the devil wants you
[1:02:39] to go to sleep he wants you to hit that
[1:02:41] snooze button
[1:02:42] he doesn't want you to awaken to the
[1:02:43] truth and so when you
[1:02:45] when you if you run a search for all the
[1:02:47] things that brother brahma said he said
[1:02:48] wake up people to the facts that jesus
[1:02:51] is here
[1:02:52] not me i represent him right through
[1:02:54] here stands that angel can't you see
[1:02:56] that light
[1:02:57] he said you're afraid to take his word
[1:02:59] afraid to trust him if you just only
[1:03:01] know how good he is to you if
[1:03:03] you only wake up to realize god be
[1:03:05] merciful to you wake up where at the end
[1:03:07] time
[1:03:08] here it is the handwriting not on the
[1:03:10] wall but in the sky
[1:03:11] god said it would be and there she is it
[1:03:13] can happen at any time
[1:03:14] he said lord god grant this morning that
[1:03:17] people will wake up
[1:03:19] and see this last sign of the earth i
[1:03:21] pray god that you'll grant something to
[1:03:23] the people
[1:03:23] he said can't you wake up friends to a
[1:03:26] fact that it's a living god that's in
[1:03:28] our midst
[1:03:29] he said my my you need god people you
[1:03:32] need to wake up
[1:03:33] with the end of the road judgment is
[1:03:35] here he said the holy spirit moving
[1:03:38] showing signs and wonders of his coming
[1:03:40] and the church seems
[1:03:41] to set days not noticing oh if we could
[1:03:44] only realize if we could only come to
[1:03:46] ourself
[1:03:47] and wake up that it's the hand of god he
[1:03:50] said oh
[1:03:50] god help us to wake up the day of
[1:03:53] hesitation is here
[1:03:55] you say oh god doesn't send any angels
[1:03:57] anymore the holy spirit is that angel
[1:03:59] the holy spirit is that person the holy
[1:04:02] spirit jesus said he the holy ghost when
[1:04:04] he comes
[1:04:04] he will do the works that he did he'd be
[1:04:06] with us even in us
[1:04:08] and he would bring things to our
[1:04:09] remembrance that he taught
[1:04:11] and would show us things to come the
[1:04:13] works that i do shall he also
[1:04:15] now we're living in that day we're
[1:04:17] living in the time
[1:04:18] we're living in the time to wake up it's
[1:04:20] not time to come to a lodge anymore
[1:04:23] it's not time to come just for the
[1:04:24] coffee it's not time just to come to
[1:04:26] look at one another
[1:04:27] but it's time to wake up to that living
[1:04:30] reality well there's a living god in our
[1:04:32] midst today
[1:04:33] [Applause]
[1:04:37] you know you know that brother brahma he
[1:04:38] began to explain in the message thirst
[1:04:40] in 1965
[1:04:42] he began he went straight from that to
[1:04:44] begin to talk about isaiah
[1:04:46] and how isaiah began to wake up wake up
[1:04:48] from his theology
[1:04:49] wake up from his education where he had
[1:04:51] been schooled and he had it all laid
[1:04:53] down but
[1:04:54] one day he got in the presence of an
[1:04:55] almighty god and he began to see god
[1:04:58] face to face the one that he had heard
[1:05:00] ministers preach about
[1:05:01] the one that he heard people talk about
[1:05:03] then he saw god
[1:05:04] face to face do you realize that's what
[1:05:06] god wants you to do is
[1:05:07] wake up to a living god walking in flesh
[1:05:11] walking in two feet walking and talking
[1:05:13] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:05:15] forever
[1:05:18] brother said isaiah that great thirst
[1:05:20] that he had had
[1:05:21] he perhaps was schooled he probably had
[1:05:23] a good education
[1:05:25] he had a marvelous conception of what
[1:05:26] god ought to be he had heard the priest
[1:05:29] he had been in the temple he had been
[1:05:31] raised to be a believer
[1:05:33] but you see he had never come face to
[1:05:35] face
[1:05:36] with it before he had a desire to do
[1:05:38] right he wanted to be right
[1:05:40] but he just had the educational side he
[1:05:43] had the theological side
[1:05:45] but when he got there in the temple that
[1:05:47] day
[1:05:48] and he's seen those cherubims waving
[1:05:50] these wings back and forth
[1:05:52] and realized that these angels
[1:05:54] ministered to the face of god
[1:05:56] and then my angels didn't even know what
[1:05:57] sin was and to stand in the presence of
[1:05:59] god
[1:06:00] they had to cover their holy faces to
[1:06:02] stand in the presence of god
[1:06:03] then that prophet cried out woe is me
[1:06:06] for i
[1:06:07] am a man of unclean lips all of my
[1:06:09] theology and stuff that i've learned
[1:06:11] all of my marvelous conception that i
[1:06:13] had of god i am
[1:06:14] face to face with it now face to face
[1:06:17] with a thing that he had learned about
[1:06:19] when you come
[1:06:20] you know moses went through that same
[1:06:22] experience his mama told him about a god
[1:06:24] she told him about a purpose in his life
[1:06:26] but one day he came to the burning bush
[1:06:28] and he was face to face with it
[1:06:30] do you realize you've got to come face
[1:06:32] to face with it too
[1:06:33] you've got to come face to face with a
[1:06:35] living reality a living god
[1:06:37] not just something dead a pain in fire
[1:06:39] of painted words on a paint on a page
[1:06:42] laying there in a book laying there in a
[1:06:43] book full of theology but when it comes
[1:06:46] off the page into a living reality
[1:06:48] you've been resurrected from dead works
[1:06:50] to a living
[1:06:51] a living christian experience do you
[1:06:54] realize
[1:06:56] do you realize when isaiah god in the
[1:06:58] presence of a holy god
[1:07:00] that he didn't he wasn't so concerned
[1:07:02] with everybody else
[1:07:03] he was just concerned about himself he
[1:07:05] began to cry whoa
[1:07:06] was me we are a people and unclean
[1:07:09] people
[1:07:09] we need to be cleansed you realize
[1:07:12] that's what brother branham said
[1:07:14] so many times we we look at love as
[1:07:16] being corrective but brother adam said
[1:07:18] also he also said
[1:07:19] that when you get away from divine love
[1:07:22] you can't overlook your brother's faults
[1:07:24] when you get away from divine love
[1:07:26] you're unable to love or look your
[1:07:27] brothers false
[1:07:28] when you when you get into the presence
[1:07:30] of a holy god then you begin to see
[1:07:32] things differently
[1:07:34] everything opens up differently
[1:07:38] we're just we're just about an hour but
[1:07:40] i have a lot more to say
[1:07:47] brother graham said that satan satan's
[1:07:50] objective is to pervert
[1:07:52] his objective is to pervert things to
[1:07:53] pervert that holy thirst
[1:07:55] and he said now how satan tries to
[1:07:57] pervert the satisfying of the soul
[1:07:59] that thirsts for the soul y'all okay for
[1:08:01] a little bit more i'm gonna run through
[1:08:03] how he perverts some of these thirsts
[1:08:05] he tries to give you everything to
[1:08:06] satisfy and he's so deceitful in these
[1:08:08] days of perversion
[1:08:10] this is a perverted world it's a
[1:08:11] perverted array i don't think there's
[1:08:13] anybody here that can question that now
[1:08:15] that you look outside and you see
[1:08:16] hollywood stars that don't know whether
[1:08:18] they're a man or a woman or
[1:08:19] something in between anymore
[1:08:20] everything's perverted when you when you
[1:08:22] ride the subway into atlanta like i did
[1:08:24] a year ago it's been a year since
[1:08:25] i did but you see all kinds of
[1:08:27] perversion even even a christian doesn't
[1:08:29] have to wonder whether
[1:08:30] the whole world is perverted and brother
[1:08:32] i said it's become the most deceitful
[1:08:34] age that any human being ever lived in
[1:08:36] it's more deceitful than it ever was now
[1:08:38] you just
[1:08:39] you just can't imagine of how deceitful
[1:08:41] the nations got
[1:08:43] even with our own brethren like american
[1:08:45] people
[1:08:46] and he began to talk about how that the
[1:08:47] devil will pervert and deceive
[1:08:50] to see it he'll pervert all these
[1:08:51] thirsts to deceive he'll pervert the
[1:08:53] thirst for success
[1:08:55] because you know a young man or a young
[1:08:57] woman will think that they want they
[1:08:58] need to get a good job and all these
[1:09:00] kind of things to be successful in this
[1:09:02] life to be
[1:09:03] but to be successful to really be
[1:09:06] successful
[1:09:06] goes beyond just the things that you do
[1:09:08] in this life it goes beyond getting a
[1:09:10] good job and having a 401k
[1:09:12] plan and saving up and investing in
[1:09:14] stocks but it goes
[1:09:16] further into eternal life all that stuff
[1:09:18] one day you're going to leave behind
[1:09:20] i remember brother danny you remember
[1:09:23] that
[1:09:23] joke brother jerry clower you should
[1:09:24] tell about brother jerry clark
[1:09:27] brother yeah he's our brother
[1:09:31] jerry clower used to tell about how that
[1:09:33] he saw that man being he
[1:09:35] lowered down in his casket with his car
[1:09:38] and and every somebody standing by
[1:09:40] saying
[1:09:40] that's really living as he was lower
[1:09:42] down into his casket
[1:09:44] now you see the paradox there is after
[1:09:46] all that life where you've heaped
[1:09:48] up all these possessions after all that
[1:09:50] then you think you're living but you're
[1:09:51] really not
[1:09:52] you're only really living you're only
[1:09:54] really a success if you're living for
[1:09:56] god
[1:09:56] and you see the devil will try to
[1:09:58] pervert that
[1:10:00] that's great that's wonderful that elon
[1:10:02] musk has all the ma
[1:10:03] great fortune that he's got that's great
[1:10:05] that bill gates has all the money he's
[1:10:07] got
[1:10:07] but what about true success true success
[1:10:10] all that's going to go away when he dies
[1:10:12] when he goes into the grave but true
[1:10:14] success comes from following jesus
[1:10:16] christ
[1:10:20] [Applause]
[1:10:25] excuse me but i've talked about how the
[1:10:28] devil will pervert a thirst for beauty
[1:10:31] and i know that i'm i'm i know i'm this
[1:10:34] might be perceived as metal a little bit
[1:10:36] uh listen listen parents don't ever tell
[1:10:38] your kids that they're not beautiful
[1:10:39] because beauty does not come from from
[1:10:41] the appearance
[1:10:42] this beauty that i'm talking about is
[1:10:44] something else it's something deeper
[1:10:46] real beauty does not come from from what
[1:10:48] what you think a lot of times what we
[1:10:50] think it is
[1:10:50] the reason we get the devil perverts it
[1:10:52] away and you begin to think that you're
[1:10:54] only beautiful because of all the makeup
[1:10:56] and the max factor and stuff or the way
[1:10:58] that you do your hair
[1:10:59] but that's not real beauty that's not
[1:11:01] real you know if you find a real
[1:11:03] godly christian woman that when she
[1:11:05] speaks it's encouraging words
[1:11:06] and she's encouraging you and can it
[1:11:08] kind of encourage a young man to get the
[1:11:10] holy ghost or whatever and out of her
[1:11:12] mouth
[1:11:12] comes a wellspring of living water
[1:11:14] that's real beauty that's the kind of
[1:11:16] beauty that i'm talking about the devil
[1:11:17] wants to pervert that away
[1:11:19] so don't ever tell your kids that you
[1:11:20] don't think they're beautiful or maybe
[1:11:22] they'll
[1:11:22] be one day a man that will want somebody
[1:11:24] that's not beautiful
[1:11:26] maybe one day there will be a man that
[1:11:27] wants real beauty maybe there'll be a
[1:11:29] man that wants real character
[1:11:34] and i'll say it to all the young ladies
[1:11:35] if you want to attract a good man
[1:11:37] you want to attract a good man by
[1:11:39] wearing max factoring
[1:11:40] and wearing high-heeled shoes and
[1:11:42] wearing all the dolling yourself up to
[1:11:44] look like the world
[1:11:45] but if you want to attract a good man
[1:11:47] then adorn yourself with modesty with
[1:11:49] with meek apparel and with with
[1:11:51] shame-faceness and sobriety like brother
[1:11:53] and i said look to first timothy 2 9
[1:11:56] to see what kind of beauty god wants do
[1:11:59] you know what
[1:11:59] do you know do you know what
[1:12:01] shamefaceness is
[1:12:02] shamefaceness is a sense of shame or
[1:12:05] honor something that the world does not
[1:12:06] possess
[1:12:07] the ability to blush the ability the
[1:12:09] ability to realize
[1:12:11] that when you need to pull your dress
[1:12:12] down maybe when you need to go to the
[1:12:14] store and get a little bit longer
[1:12:15] dresses
[1:12:16] because they're shame-facedness you
[1:12:18] realize that what you're putting on
[1:12:19] display is not something for the world
[1:12:21] to gaze at
[1:12:22] but only for your husband to gaze there
[1:12:24] that's shame phase just that's the kind
[1:12:26] of character
[1:12:26] that god wants to see on display the
[1:12:28] kind of beauty that god wants to see on
[1:12:30] this place
[1:12:32] he wants to see modesty and bastefulness
[1:12:35] and reverence
[1:12:36] and regard for others and respect
[1:12:38] somebody a young lady that's not always
[1:12:40] flying up or an old lady that's not
[1:12:42] always flying off the handle
[1:12:44] telling everybody where they can get off
[1:12:45] and what they can do right he wants
[1:12:47] somebody to live in modesty
[1:12:48] and humidity and meekness somebody with
[1:12:51] respect respect to others
[1:12:53] soundness of mind and self-control
[1:12:56] that's what first timothy 2
[1:12:57] 9 is talking about and the devil will
[1:12:59] try to pervert that away and make you
[1:13:01] think that god wants something else
[1:13:03] to he'll treat health they'll try to
[1:13:05] pervert that away and think think
[1:13:07] think that think that lust is pretty
[1:13:09] think that covering up your
[1:13:11] your natural beauty that god gave you is
[1:13:13] pretty
[1:13:14] brother said oh my some of these people
[1:13:16] today out on the streets
[1:13:18] you can't tell a man from the woman i've
[1:13:20] never seen anything like it like human
[1:13:22] beings
[1:13:23] it's beyond human eyes painted way up
[1:13:26] like that
[1:13:27] them funny-looking lizard eyes all them
[1:13:29] funny-looking clothes
[1:13:30] also out of form they don't even look
[1:13:32] like a human being
[1:13:34] hair cut like a man wearing women's
[1:13:36] wearing men's clothes and then he said
[1:13:37] and then men turn around wearing women's
[1:13:39] clothes
[1:13:40] and a haircut like a woman and you see
[1:13:42] god don't want you looking like the
[1:13:43] world
[1:13:44] he wants you to be separated he wants
[1:13:46] you to be pulled apart
[1:13:47] and put a part he wants you to be a holy
[1:13:50] people and he's not making you holy by
[1:13:52] your works trying to do something
[1:13:53] trying to work something up but he's
[1:13:55] making you holy by you
[1:13:56] feasting on the word of god and it's
[1:13:58] changing your desire
[1:14:00] changing your thirst and that's how you
[1:14:01] tell what's on the inside is by your
[1:14:03] thirst
[1:14:04] by what you're thirsting after young
[1:14:06] ladies i would encourage you to thirst
[1:14:08] after beauty
[1:14:09] young men thirst after holiness and
[1:14:11] godliness thirst after sobriety thirst
[1:14:14] after a sense of shame or honor and
[1:14:16] modesty and all those things
[1:14:17] listen that might burn a little bit that
[1:14:19] might scald a little bit but it'll be
[1:14:21] good for you
[1:14:22] it'll be like good medicine that brother
[1:14:23] brown talked about he didn't want to
[1:14:24] take that oil down and his mama gave him
[1:14:26] it kind of made him gag a little bit it
[1:14:28] kind of made him maybe it was a little
[1:14:30] bit bitter but it was good for him in
[1:14:31] the end
[1:14:36] now the true church that a woman should
[1:14:37] have brother i'm sitting in thirst
[1:14:39] would be adorn herself adorn themselves
[1:14:41] in modest apparel
[1:14:42] and to have a christ-like spirit now
[1:14:44] that's the way the woman should thirst
[1:14:46] to be
[1:14:46] now if you want to be pretty that's what
[1:14:48] makes you pretty see that's what makes
[1:14:50] you pretty
[1:14:51] is a christ-like spirit and adorned in
[1:14:53] modest apparel
[1:14:55] i would encourage you to never make that
[1:14:57] confession again that i don't believe
[1:14:58] i'm pretty
[1:14:59] never tell your kids that you don't
[1:15:00] think they're pretty
[1:15:02] in fact you as a parent as a guardian of
[1:15:05] the of your children you should be the
[1:15:06] one to lift them up when they're down
[1:15:08] you should be the one to pick them up
[1:15:09] you should never tell your kids that you
[1:15:11] don't think they're free
[1:15:15] you know you got all the school
[1:15:16] playground to do that you got all that
[1:15:18] all that stuff and many times even at
[1:15:19] church
[1:15:20] people will say hateful horrible things
[1:15:22] and you're going to have that but you as
[1:15:23] their parent when they get back to your
[1:15:25] home
[1:15:25] you're there to build them up and
[1:15:27] encourage them and lift them up and
[1:15:28] show them in the scripture what be it
[1:15:29] what real beauty is about
[1:15:33] and brother brown said they even got the
[1:15:34] churches today the church is hybrid
[1:15:36] hybrid church is not fulfilling the true
[1:15:38] purpose he said that's right they get in
[1:15:40] here they just go to church
[1:15:42] it's a lodge instead of a church now
[1:15:43] let's see what he said about being a
[1:15:45] lodge
[1:15:45] a church is a place where people come
[1:15:47] together and worship god in spirit and
[1:15:50] in truth
[1:15:51] and worship god worship that's what
[1:15:53] you're here for
[1:15:54] your purpose is to worship and that's
[1:15:57] what your thirst is to worship a living
[1:15:59] god
[1:16:00] and he said today it's a lodge we go
[1:16:03] there and have a little time to shake
[1:16:04] hands
[1:16:05] and fellowship and some black coffee in
[1:16:07] the back of the building
[1:16:08] they go home till next week and we've
[1:16:10] done our religious duty so you
[1:16:12] see it's not a lodge because of the
[1:16:14] pastor saying it's a lodge
[1:16:16] or the the organization or whatever it
[1:16:18] is saying it's a large but it's a
[1:16:20] lodge when you make it a lodge when you
[1:16:22] come and that's all you're getting out
[1:16:23] of it
[1:16:24] it's just shaking hands and some coffee
[1:16:26] that's what you make out of it it's a
[1:16:28] lodge
[1:16:28] it's a lodge when that's what you've
[1:16:30] done instead of coming to fulfill that
[1:16:32] thirst to quench that thirst that holy
[1:16:34] thirst that's in you
[1:16:36] you make it a lodge you know i've heard
[1:16:38] so many people through the message say
[1:16:39] that look at all these denominations
[1:16:40] that's just a lodge
[1:16:42] large large laws they're just lodges and
[1:16:44] they could be coming to church and
[1:16:45] treating that church the same way where
[1:16:47] it's just a lodge to them
[1:16:48] nothing more than a place to get some
[1:16:50] fresh coffee
[1:16:55] brother brown said and where is thy
[1:16:56] strength go on sam said he said don't
[1:16:57] let the devil rob that power of the holy
[1:16:59] ghost away from you
[1:17:00] that's the thing that we need that's the
[1:17:02] life of a church take that out
[1:17:04] take out the life take out the life and
[1:17:07] you've got a lodge
[1:17:08] take out the life and you've got a lodge
[1:17:10] take the spirit out of the church you've
[1:17:12] got a lodge
[1:17:13] we don't want a lodge these are brother
[1:17:15] rams words that's for men who wants the
[1:17:17] lodge the lodge is for people that want
[1:17:19] that kind of thing
[1:17:20] but we don't want that we don't want a
[1:17:22] lodge we want to be able to worship
[1:17:23] anyone in spirit and
[1:17:24] truth he said we want a church that's
[1:17:27] filled with the holy ghost and christ is
[1:17:28] the king of it he said i feel religious
[1:17:31] right now because
[1:17:32] god will have one a church born again
[1:17:34] filled washed in the blood
[1:17:36] filled with the spirit all condemnation
[1:17:38] gone
[1:17:39] you see how the devil could even pervert
[1:17:41] fellowship you could begin to think that
[1:17:43] you're just coming to church to get
[1:17:44] around one another
[1:17:45] and that's what fellowship is to
[1:17:47] fellowship with one another to
[1:17:48] fellowship with your family
[1:17:49] but god wants fellowship with you god
[1:17:52] wants you to fellowship with him and the
[1:17:54] quietness of the evening
[1:17:55] at the cool of the garden like adam and
[1:17:57] eve walking in the garden along with him
[1:17:59] brother i said it's natural for a young
[1:18:01] man and young woman to desire love
[1:18:03] it's natural to want to be around other
[1:18:05] young people it's
[1:18:06] natural to want to be around other other
[1:18:08] christians
[1:18:09] but when we come to church it's to
[1:18:12] quench our thirst for him
[1:18:13] we come to church for to quench our
[1:18:15] thirst for him and to fellowship with
[1:18:17] him
[1:18:20] that's why psalm 42 said my soul my soul
[1:18:23] thirsteth for god for the living god
[1:18:26] now you know that david said here
[1:18:28] brother and i said for the living god
[1:18:30] now in the beginning was the word and
[1:18:32] the word was with god and the word was
[1:18:34] god
[1:18:34] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:18:36] among us then there can be no
[1:18:38] satisfaction
[1:18:40] until this word which is god becomes
[1:18:42] alive in you
[1:18:44] then you see god himself fulfilling the
[1:18:46] promises
[1:18:47] that he made in the bible that's what
[1:18:49] we're thirsting for to see
[1:18:51] god's word made manifest in us not just
[1:18:54] to get around one another and say we're
[1:18:55] fellowshipping
[1:18:56] a trade gossip and trade stories about
[1:18:58] one another and
[1:18:59] trade trade enmity and variance and
[1:19:02] strife until like paul said we just
[1:19:04] we're just devouring one another but our
[1:19:06] goal is to have fellowship with god
[1:19:09] brethren said to know him as life the
[1:19:11] person christ himself
[1:19:13] and he said it's a revelation that god
[1:19:15] built his church upon
[1:19:17] this whole thing is built upon the
[1:19:18] revelation and then and unless this is
[1:19:21] revealed to you
[1:19:22] do you see what we're thirsting for
[1:19:23] we're not thirsting just for some
[1:19:24] education
[1:19:25] over some theology but we're thirsting
[1:19:28] for the resurrection of god's word in
[1:19:30] our lives
[1:19:36] i'm trying to find a place to stop here
[1:19:38] and it ain't working
[1:19:40] in john chapter 4 verse 7 this story the
[1:19:44] story there is a story about
[1:19:45] a little woman that had a horrible a
[1:19:47] horrible backstory of all the things
[1:19:49] that she had done in her life
[1:19:50] and she had a thirst and she recognized
[1:19:53] that that
[1:19:53] thirst quencher was there when he began
[1:19:55] to speak to her
[1:19:57] and jesus answered and said unto her if
[1:19:58] thou knewest the gift of god
[1:20:01] and who it is that saith to thee give me
[1:20:02] to drink thou wouldest have asked of him
[1:20:05] and he would have given thee living
[1:20:06] water
[1:20:07] living water why because he's the one
[1:20:09] that is the fountain
[1:20:10] he's the one that was walking in the
[1:20:12] garden of eden with adam and eve
[1:20:14] he's the one that we've been searching
[1:20:16] he's the one that they were looking for
[1:20:17] as they came out of egypt
[1:20:18] the one that that that rock that smitten
[1:20:21] rock type
[1:20:22] typed he's the one and the woman saith
[1:20:25] unto him sir thou that's nothing to draw
[1:20:27] with
[1:20:28] and the well is deep from whence then
[1:20:30] hast thou that
[1:20:31] living water you know his answer is i am
[1:20:34] that living water i'm the one
[1:20:36] and you know you know what's so special
[1:20:38] about this gospel
[1:20:39] is when you come to that fountain and
[1:20:41] drink it transforms you and now that
[1:20:44] water comes
[1:20:45] and it puts itself inside of you until
[1:20:47] you now you
[1:20:48] become that fountain that others can
[1:20:50] drink from
[1:20:55] in john chapter 4 jesus answered and
[1:20:57] said
[1:20:59] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[1:21:01] thirst again
[1:21:03] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[1:21:05] i shall give him
[1:21:06] shall never thirst but the water that i
[1:21:09] shall give him
[1:21:10] the water that i shall give him shall be
[1:21:13] in him a well of water springing up into
[1:21:16] everlasting life
[1:21:17] the woman saith unto me sir give me this
[1:21:20] water that i thirst not neither come
[1:21:21] hither to draw
[1:21:22] and brother brahma said you cannot
[1:21:24] satisfy that by joining church
[1:21:26] you've got to find the person god
[1:21:28] himself which is the word
[1:21:30] and interpretation of himself today the
[1:21:32] promises that he made today
[1:21:34] you know what we're thirsting for we're
[1:21:36] thirsting we're thirsting for all these
[1:21:37] patterns that were laid out for us in
[1:21:39] the old testament
[1:21:40] we're thirsting for elohim we're
[1:21:42] thirsting for el shaddai you know what
[1:21:43] elohim is
[1:21:44] elohim is god along with his attributes
[1:21:46] and many people have pondered what that
[1:21:48] means
[1:21:48] it's a plural word what does that mean a
[1:21:50] plural word does that mean there's three
[1:21:52] gods no
[1:21:53] that means there's one god a god in
[1:21:55] singleness
[1:21:56] but plurality and attributes in other
[1:21:59] words everything that you have need of
[1:22:01] everything that you're thirsting for can
[1:22:02] be found in him everything that you need
[1:22:05] is in that elohim
[1:22:06] the same thing without shadow everything
[1:22:08] that you need is in the great breasted
[1:22:10] one
[1:22:10] and when a child is born brother instead
[1:22:12] of a child is born it
[1:22:14] immediately turns to his mother's breast
[1:22:16] because it was
[1:22:17] under under her heart for nine months
[1:22:19] and when you're born when you're born
[1:22:21] whether it's a denomination wherever it
[1:22:23] is you just immediately start
[1:22:25] looking for this message because you're
[1:22:27] turning you're turning to else yeti eye
[1:22:29] you're looking for real shout out you're
[1:22:31] looking for the one from which you draw
[1:22:33] all your strength else shady eyes where
[1:22:36] you get all your nourishment from
[1:22:38] he is able to give if you can receive
[1:22:42] he is able to give well the
[1:22:43] all-sufficient one do you think
[1:22:45] nobody in your whole life have you ever
[1:22:47] met that could fulfill
[1:22:48] all of your needs your mama and daddy
[1:22:51] could fulfill
[1:22:52] some of your needs your spouse can
[1:22:53] fulfill some of your needs
[1:22:55] the people at work can fulfill some
[1:22:56] needs they give you your paycheck and
[1:22:58] those kind of things
[1:22:59] but he is the only one that can fulfill
[1:23:01] every need
[1:23:02] he's the all-sufficient one he can meet
[1:23:04] every need no matter what it is
[1:23:06] he can meet that need and that's why
[1:23:09] matthew 11 says come unto me
[1:23:11] come unto me all you that labor and are
[1:23:13] heavy laden and i will give you rest
[1:23:15] i'll give you everything that you have
[1:23:16] need of
[1:23:17] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[1:23:19] for i am meek and lowly in heart
[1:23:21] and you shall find rest unto your souls
[1:23:23] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[1:23:25] light
[1:23:29] you know another thing that you find
[1:23:31] when you find jesus
[1:23:34] brother brown talked about how that just
[1:23:36] like david david was just an outcast
[1:23:39] just a little weak a weak little
[1:23:40] individual that even his own daddy
[1:23:42] didn't think he'd make a good king
[1:23:44] when samuel came to anoi everybody
[1:23:46] overlooked him
[1:23:47] and brother adam said that was the same
[1:23:48] thing about him he said i always was a
[1:23:50] black sheep i wanted people to love me
[1:23:52] but then he said one day one day i found
[1:23:55] a friend
[1:23:56] one day i found somebody that i could
[1:23:57] talk to now maybe
[1:23:59] maybe you're in that predicament tonight
[1:24:01] maybe you feel like there ain't even
[1:24:02] nobody in this whole church
[1:24:03] that's a real friend the kind of friend
[1:24:05] that you need nobody a friend
[1:24:07] at school nobody a friend at your work
[1:24:09] that you're all alone and you feel like
[1:24:11] a big old black sheep
[1:24:12] you are a little black sheep you feel
[1:24:15] like
[1:24:15] you feel like an outcast you feel like
[1:24:17] an off scout or somebody that's
[1:24:19] something that's been tossed to the side
[1:24:20] of the road but you remember in
[1:24:22] perfect strength by perfect weakness
[1:24:24] brother brown said that's exactly the
[1:24:26] kind of
[1:24:26] individual that god is looking for he's
[1:24:29] not looking for
[1:24:30] for heroes and sports and popular
[1:24:32] figures necessarily although you can
[1:24:34] you can you can come if you're popular
[1:24:36] and all those kind of things but he's
[1:24:37] looking for somebody that feels like
[1:24:39] like they're a little bit different
[1:24:41] something's not right because you're
[1:24:43] thirsting for something
[1:24:44] you're thirsting for god and brother
[1:24:46] bryan said when i got saved and found
[1:24:48] that something in me that i thirsted for
[1:24:50] a friend
[1:24:51] somebody that would be a buddy to me
[1:24:53] somebody i could trust
[1:24:54] somebody you can set down to and talk
[1:24:57] your troubles
[1:24:58] over with he said i found that real true
[1:25:00] satisfaction when i found jesus christ
[1:25:03] that real true satisfier that takes away
[1:25:05] all quenches all that thirst
[1:25:08] and gives you something that just looks
[1:25:09] like there's just nothing to take his
[1:25:12] place
[1:25:12] and it looks like that because it's true
[1:25:15] there is nothing that can take his place
[1:25:17] there is nothing that can take his place
[1:25:19] and when you when you find that first
[1:25:21] quencher it just bubbles up from an end
[1:25:23] from the inside then you can when it's
[1:25:25] bubbling up see
[1:25:26] you don't have to wait for somebody else
[1:25:27] to amen in church it's bubbling up so
[1:25:30] you can amen you can praise god even if
[1:25:32] nobody else is praising god
[1:25:34] listen you've got peace when it's not
[1:25:36] peaceful you've got joy in the midst of
[1:25:38] sorrow it doesn't matter if everybody
[1:25:39] else is praising god and happy around
[1:25:41] you or not
[1:25:42] because the artesian well is bubbling up
[1:25:44] on the inside
[1:25:45] you don't need somebody to pump you up
[1:25:47] or lift you up because there's
[1:25:49] something on the inside doing the
[1:25:50] lifting
[1:25:52] you see what you're thirsting for is the
[1:25:54] reveal word i'm gonna close up here in
[1:25:56] just a second
[1:25:59] oh my i'm skipping over all kind of
[1:26:00] stuff
[1:26:03] let's go back to this psalm 42 and we'll
[1:26:06] close just here in a minute
[1:26:07] i know y'all getting tired to the chief
[1:26:10] musician
[1:26:11] as the heart panetth after the water
[1:26:13] book so panteth my soul after the o god
[1:26:16] my soul thirsteth for god for the living
[1:26:18] god when shall i come and appear before
[1:26:20] god said david
[1:26:21] david the fugitive david the anointed
[1:26:23] king
[1:26:24] that was striving to come into what god
[1:26:26] had promised him
[1:26:27] david the fugitive down in that cave
[1:26:30] looking over at bethlehem and he began
[1:26:32] to think he began to thirst
[1:26:33] that physical thirst the thirst for that
[1:26:36] whale in
[1:26:37] bethlehem brother baby said he he began
[1:26:39] to remember about how when he was a boy
[1:26:41] that
[1:26:41] he'd play around that well and he'd go
[1:26:43] over and get a nice cool drink out of
[1:26:45] and had
[1:26:45] all those minerals and things in it and
[1:26:47] just tasted so good
[1:26:49] down from the depths of the earth it
[1:26:50] just come up and it questioned his third
[1:26:52] thirst and he began to think oh if i
[1:26:54] could just have
[1:26:55] some of that water from that whale in
[1:26:57] bethlehem you see his physical thirst he
[1:27:00] was craving that with his physical
[1:27:01] thirst
[1:27:02] and these three mighty men rose up and
[1:27:04] they began to battle for 15 miles or 13
[1:27:07] miles or however however long it was
[1:27:08] miles and miles and miles of fighting
[1:27:10] to get to that well just to get a little
[1:27:12] water to bring back
[1:27:13] to bring back to david and when they
[1:27:16] came back
[1:27:17] when they came back david poured it on
[1:27:19] the ground that's right
[1:27:22] brother ram said when they went down and
[1:27:23] got the water and brought it back his
[1:27:25] soul thirst was so greater
[1:27:27] not for bethlehem not for bethlehem
[1:27:29] anymore
[1:27:30] but from jerusalem his soul was so he
[1:27:33] sacrificed the water said i wouldn't
[1:27:35] even drink it he poured it out upon the
[1:27:37] ground
[1:27:37] see his soul was more thirsty for god
[1:27:40] than it was to satisfy the queen's the
[1:27:42] thirst of his body with a good
[1:27:44] cool water he poured it on the ground do
[1:27:46] you realize what that said that's like
[1:27:48] jesus
[1:27:49] pouring his blood out on the ground in
[1:27:50] other words ignoring all the physical
[1:27:52] hardship
[1:27:53] ignoring all the stuff that you got to
[1:27:55] go through to get victory
[1:27:56] ignoring that for the joy that would
[1:27:58] come by overcoming the world
[1:28:01] and see now you you can pour out that
[1:28:03] water but pouring out
[1:28:04] pouring out your desire for anything of
[1:28:06] this world pouring out the desire for
[1:28:08] anything of the physical
[1:28:10] and desiring the spiritual pouring out
[1:28:12] everything because your desire
[1:28:14] is not for the things that you can see
[1:28:15] but you're looking to the unseen
[1:28:18] do you realize you can do that this
[1:28:19] afternoon as the musicians come
[1:28:21] you can you can do that now you can pour
[1:28:24] you can say i've looked at the physical
[1:28:26] long enough
[1:28:26] i've looked at something that can quench
[1:28:28] my physical thirst long enough
[1:28:30] but now it's time to pour that out i
[1:28:32] want something that will satisfy my soul
[1:28:35] i want a living reality brother brown
[1:28:38] said it takes more than joining a thirst
[1:28:40] more than shaking hands with the
[1:28:42] preacher more than living a good
[1:28:44] straight life
[1:28:45] it takes something to satisfy inside of
[1:28:47] you that pours down from god
[1:28:49] into the soul the deep calling to the
[1:28:52] deep but the noise of thy water spouts o
[1:28:54] lord
[1:28:55] the deep calling to the deep i wonder
[1:28:57] this afternoon as they
[1:28:59] say maybe just play something softly if
[1:29:00] you just meditate on that and
[1:29:02] take take stock of your life take
[1:29:04] inventory of your life
[1:29:06] you know at walmart and all these
[1:29:08] department stores they take inventory to
[1:29:10] see what they got
[1:29:11] and now maybe it's time to take
[1:29:12] spiritual inventory of where we are and
[1:29:14] see if there's something lacking in our
[1:29:16] lives
[1:29:16] go through the shells of your life and
[1:29:18] see if there's something that needs to
[1:29:20] be restocked
[1:29:21] go through the shells of your life and
[1:29:22] see if there's something that's out of
[1:29:24] place
[1:29:25] maybe there's something that maybe
[1:29:26] there's something that you need tonight
[1:29:29] if there's something you need and come
[1:29:31] with an empty vessel
[1:29:32] because god's able to feel if you'll
[1:29:35] like
[1:29:35] like he told the prophet to go dig this
[1:29:38] valley full of ditches
[1:29:39] and god filled it when they came and
[1:29:41] came with dug they dug it out
[1:29:43] dug out deep all all the all the stuff
[1:29:46] that
[1:29:46] they wanted to get rid of and god came
