Lord is hearing about you we're not ever learning but never coming to the knowledge of the truth because that's where mankind does but we're ever learning about you and each day is a marvelous experience to be able to to talk about you and fellowship together with brothers and sisters and listen to them Lord talk about you we love you and we thank you we ask you now to bless each one that's

that are not hearing Brother Dean they're preaching for his brother today just have your way with each one have let your love be manifested forgive our sins mainly because we want to stand complete in you as we read your word now you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 and Revelations 20 oh yeah to we have an announcement from the believer's Tabernacle Brother Joseph at Murphy's burough uh on May the 3 which will be a Friday uh they're having a youth banquet and all the information is here on the the little thing we'll keep announcing it and all it was other what is the other we supposed to start today Mak an Ann okay fellowship meeting starting today from now we announce fellowship meeting where everybody know okay Revelation one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he s and signified it by his Angel and to his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he sought blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein why for the time is at hand the time to what time to understand is at hand now Revelations 20:7 and when the thousand years are expired Satan shall be loosed out of his prison and he shall go out to deceive the Nations which are in the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog to gather them together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea and they went upon the breath of the earth and compassed the camp of the Saints about and the below City and fire came down from God out of heaven and divided them you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word that we were all life in this morning the brothers have an excuse if all the mechanical stuff they can blame their mistakes today on the mechanical because you know there did do so much and there is so much in here you wouldn't realize what it would take to uh you know to uh do something like just changing simple and putting in a few cameras and things but Richard has been well acquainted with the attic and anybody that's ever got up in there you don't want to be up in there you're on your belly Carling on shingles on other ceilings but we do we thank everybody for all of the doings and and the things that they've done and I was up here and we pulled I know over 30 cables are pulled back from the front to the back so that meant all them trips making backwards and forth but just remember that now all right now we tried this past Wednesday night we jumped over just a little and and we were at you know back over on the millennial rain there this past uh weekend and then we came over into the white Throne judgment just kind of getting a a line up in the Book of Revelations and uh now we're dropping in to pick up uh you know a point here that we want to cover one more thing and then we'll drop into the the Lord willingness coming Wednesday we will start on Revelations 21 and the the you know the the future we'll get a little bit of it today but not much but I want you to think about these things this past Wednesday I guess it was was when we were covering the white Throne judgment and we believe firmly that the Bride of Jesus Christ does not stand before the white Throne judgment why would you have the new birth and receive eternal life here right you know and then have to go there and be judged right no we judged ourselves guilty amen we judged ourselves to be lost amen we' seen that point and we then repented we asked God to forgive us and he gave us his own Spirit gave us eternal life then that way those with eternal life will not be standing before the white throne but they will be sitting with him on the throne because that we took the Book of Daniel and comparing it and I hope you enjoyed that with kind of into the Book of Revelations about the white throne and how that you can just read one thing a lot of times in the Bible and and it won't give you an overall view all right then you turn over to another scripture that is that same event or point and and and then you'll see Parts there right that maybe won't give you an overall view so then but you put them both together and I hope that was a a understanding to you there taking the Book of Daniel cuz brother randam said The Book of Daniel is actually the Book of Revelations of the Old Testament because what you cover in the Book of Revelations about the Beast and the Rome and the you know the dragon the different thing you just go back and read the book of of Daniel right amen and it'll tell you all about those things and who they are and the mees of Persians and the Greeks and the the things coming down to you know uh give us an understanding of the day and hour hour We're living to me uh just like John going to patmas and was there for two years writing the Book of Revelations well it doesn't say how long Daniel was necessarily in writing but it would take a good bit because he was having a continual dreams or visions or experiences and it would be over a long period of time but when you see the two put together you can see a beautiful picture amen one will say one thing the other will say the other one speak of the both of them speaks of like the the uh books but then one speaks of The Book of Life or the other one does not speak of it well then it's bringing it uh to a position of of understanding you know where we're at and and all that so just take that message and try to study on it but then we wanted to lay in one more thought of speaking about the what we've read here and it says after the thousand years is finished then Satan's loose for a little season amen all right now how long that'll be you can argue the point you can talk about well they can have another world and another people and another group or another things but I I searched as much as I could and I found a couple of places where the Prophet talks about it as it being actually the him loosen together his subjects y now he can't raise the dead but when he sees the dead being raised come to the general Resurrection as we would call it the resurrection at the end time going to the white Throne judgment and when he sees that then immediately he will be loosed himself from the chain of circumstances that's holding him right not a log chain cuz you can't do that with the devil you can't put him in a cubicle and lock him up cuz he's a spirit right all right but you can God chains him with a chain of circumstances there's nobody there he can work through that's right what about a thousand years on Earth of the millennial Reigns without Satan being there amen as I said to you there they have what they call the post millennial they have the premillennial and they have the a millennial you know on the the teachings of the millennial Reign but if you had it back there then where was Satan B right oh of course the Catholic church that has what would be known as the premillennial the Catholic Church believe that Satan was bound cuz they ruled the world for over a thousand years there of the Dark Ages and things that they could just kill and all that I I just don't believe the Millennium has come yet no I'm just honest because my reading of the Bible seems to make it to where that that even the the lamb and the lion would lay down together together and you know a child could put his hand on a on a real deadly Serpent's y Nest or hole or whatever you know and it wouldn't hurt him well I don't think that's happening yet so then I'm looking forward to a millennial rain and we found that it would be to the bride of Christ the honeymoon all right the honeymoon what a time to learn more about him amen I hope you enjoyed those points I was trying to to make about that because that's the way I think about it a honeymoon is where a man and his wife learn each other you know you find out what you want to eat you find out what you want to do or where you want to go or whatever this out there on your honeymoon and that way it'll be a thousand years of learning but you know what then we can take that right back to the people right that are there in the Millenium right and we can tell them about what he is amen be a wonderful time it's not going to be just no you know well we're going to put up there and play Harps we we we we I I ain't no good at playing music right you know and I would be at a disadvantage to you that can play but I don't mind sitting by and listening to somebody play good amen but I hate for somebody to you know it be like brother uh durett and brother uh perky was doing that time when it was brother perky was on the piano and brother durett was on the guitar vice versa and one of them said to the other one play a tune he went he's trying to find it on the piano and he said well give me another cord he said what are you doing he said I'm just frailing it said I I don't know about playing well that's the way I'd be and if you put me in heaven I wouldn't know no more about it I think we're going to have a wonderful time right here on this Earth amen that's right see to where we can have a time of peace with Satan bound amen but then he's loose for a little season the Bible says after the thousand years we just read is expired then he's Loos a little season all right he'll go forth and try to gather and he's going to try one more time to be able to conquer God he comes up around the city and and the the Saints and he won't be able to conquer that's right he'll done be defeated and he'll be destroyed and that's what'll happen here as we get into what is called go and M OG now there's a lot about that that people want to believe that it's this country and that country and we'll read in a minute where that it it basically would deal with Russia but remember Russia is not the whole world you're going to have to get a different idea because Russia's not the doing and what is causing the battle of Armageddon is Satan and is forces trying to come against the word of God and the people of God which is going on right now in a spiritual sense in you and I but then when we leave out of here there'll be a tribulation period as we call it Daniel's troubles for three and a half years and as that's going on the Antichrist is going to come forth and make his Covenant with Israel the natural Nation but he won't make his Covenant with 144,000 cuz they won't have anything to do with it they'll be out of it so it's going to be a a Time coming that Satan can do but then when a thousand years come see he's bound he's removed from the ability to be able to deceive anybody well I don't believe when he's loosed over there at the end after the the Millennium is over with we'll read in a minute the prophet said I don't believe he'll be able to go forth and do much deceiving to me it's just a point that he's he's Gathering his subjects to make one more battle you say well that could take millions of years of time I'm not worried about it because I'm going to be Eternal in uh we're already by then the bride will have lived already through the millennial reain she's done been in glory she's done rode back with him done had a honeymoon we're not going to be worried about it but why are you worried about it is that all you can get what your thoughts can be well you know that could start a whole new world system all over again and all this that and why not just take what the prophet said he gathers his subjects on the second Resurrection we'll read that in a minute that's what he says about it he didn't say go forth and and and bring all this nation to this nation and get what I'm saying it will deal with go and Magog as we're looking at Russia as we call Russia Gog and Magog because of the and that's fine but just remember the whole world is involved in this just as I was saying the battle of Armageddon will be the whole world coming together to fight Israel but see we want to make it to King of the North and it it'll works because that's fine if you want to read Ezekiel 38 and 39 you can really I just reading it this morning looking back at it and that is that battle coming forth of Gog and Magog you know just read it and you'll see but remember read reading it you're reading of what they say back there that there's going to be horses and chariots and and and all no ain't too many armies today needs horses and chariots they need horsepower for running their equipment and and you know and they need chariots which is tanks and Humvees and and jet airplanes and stuff like that so when you're reading the Bible sometimes you got to pick it up from where it is and what it's saying M Ezekiel I believe it was what was it he saw fire falling down out of heaven we see everybody thanks God one of he days he going to run and he will that's fine but what about a nuclear destruction right you realize right now I mean when I was a kid in school they was afraid that they were going to make a hydrogen bomb because they had already fooled with and broke the split the atom and and the things and they were afraid that a hydrogen bomb would set the whole world off mhm you know well they've got bombs way beyond that now you know that's dire just waiting and what would happen if one country just pushes a button a it can't happen it can't happen till the bride gets out of here but after then as you're left at the mercy that's right all right but let's let's get down to it now and think about it this Gog and Magog but I want to I want to get this to an of events I like to do it this way so let's go ahead with number one and if we have trouble throwing things up you forgive us because we're still in the playing stage of the brothers back there to to be able to bring up what we need we look what the prophet of God says questions and answers reel number 4 64830 the evening service paragraph 75 the church age ended and has blacked out the bride is called we have already entered into the tribulation period I've read this one to you many many times because it gives you an order of events you know and I like that to know what's coming next what to expect all right see somebody was asking they thought they'd already enter the tribulation he says no no no we're not in the tribulation right we're not in the Millennium we're not in but that's man in their ideas no no no I wish that I could just have more time on that see the bride now he's going to give you a series of events I I love this quote so it'd be good to write it down stick it in your Bible and keep it with you cuz then if you want to know something brother Rand will be talking he say if I don't see you anymore I'll see at the future home the next thing is the future home well that's not right that's not right you said well are you correcting him no he don't have to be corrected he corrects his own self because he gives you the series of events the future home is not the next thing the next thing from now is the rapture of the church the next thing is not the tribulation we got to get out of here before the tribulation comes cuz the bride don't go through the tribulation she don't sit at the white she don't have to stand before the white Throne judgment she don't have to be judged she don't have to have a tribulation to make her perfect right we're perfect through the blood of Jesus Christ amen not through some purging we have to go through you say yeah but this over well didn't what do you think what do you think about it the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease and the church age don't cease until we get out of here people say today the church age is over I show me where it's at I know the quote you're talking about but see you're taking a quote and you're killing yourself with it to the church a you still here the lady seeing Church a time goes on in the Millennium they have a thousand years of Earthly time right come on lady oia goes into chaos the bride goes to glory and the tribulation period sets in upon the slooping virgins for three and A2 years while Israel is getting its prophecy that's simple just following it through the Book of Revelations then tribulation and sets it upon in upon Israel then comes the battle of Armageddon all right which destroys all things and then the bride returns back with the groom for a thousand years the millennial Reign after that comes the white Throne judgment after that comes the new heavens and the new Earth the new city coming down from God out of Heaven eternity and time Blends together all right now the only thing that he left out of it was the battle of Gog and Magog right so he gave you the order of events so if you ever want to know what's coming next just read the book that's right mainly just think with common sense see if we go out of here in the Rapture right now that's not the end of the world right you got to have your Jews called out see as long as he's dealing here you're not dealing over there you flat don't want to be here when he's dealing with Israel cuz that means you missed it you'd be one of the foolish virgins that they're going to have to be Purge and give their life all right but now think about it Rapture of the Bride tribulation sets in Armageddon comes Millennium [Music] comes all right Satan's looks a little season and Gog and Magog will take place then the future home will come down in chapter 21 right all right so we're going through the Book of Revelations to try to tie it together and and to to get an understanding then I told you and announced it the way ahead that we're going to enter a series after this and a couple of more messages maybe a month from now but we're going to get into a topic called marriage and divorce and we're going to cover what a wedding wedding is what a what a divorce is and the things like that from the scriptures amen and then we'll take that through the series okay but now listen why is Satan looed so go ahead to number two and let's just read what the prophet had to say why is Satan loose for a little season that's after the Millennium now Satan's loose for a little season season why will Satan be loose a little season after the Thousand Years of Revelation 20 and 3 and Revelation 20 and 27 that's really 20 and7 because there is no 27 all right why will he be loosed is to gather up his people on the second Resurrection cuz Satan has to stand the Judgment also he has to be condemned now you say well that automatically throws away what you said the other day when I said Satan don't have to go to the white on judgment cuz he doesn't the Bible tells you he's casting the Lake of Fire before the white Throne judgment because Satan's not a man he's an Angelic being amen right sure he'll be judged we will even judge Angels Paul says they're in Corinthians right but Satan's not a man like we are so he can be throwed in there ahead of time all right now what happens he gathers his people on the second Resurrection that's said there's no way now he's saying that that Satan can raise the dead right now come on but he gathers the people when he sees the people he's loose and when he sees the people beginning together to go the resurrection starts taking place right and brother R said there The Sinner will be judged in the body that he lived in amen right so Resurrection to him is not replacement that's right why would we even say we're going to get a new body when Jesus raised with nail prints in his hands the Bible says why we want to talk about getting a new body of course we smoke and we drink and say well he can't redeem this one well did he redeem your soul amen right it's not the body that's the problem it's the soul right the body is useless without the Soul and Spirit to correct or guide it and Lead it see come on just being sensible amen all right so he's loosed together his people I read you one day the other day where he said that his that his people is in hell so when they come up out of hell when everything comes up in the resurrection and starts up towards the white Throne Satan's going to immediately jump in and say I got it now I got I I just had a few people back under now I got billions of trillions of trillions of people surely I can come God but he won't be able to do that he won't be able to do that all right look at the next one this is questions and answers on the seals 63 324 the morning service paragraph 340 through 341 I think that's right would you explain please explain about Satan being bound a thousand years and being loose for the battle of the battle of Revelations 20 8 which is Armageddon we I mean Gog and Magog we just read all right what relationship does this have with the battle of Armageddon what relationship does Gog and Magog have to do with Armageddon as mentioned in the four seal will Gog and Magog be gathered from the people of the new Earth see he's going well on over who's asking the question well this is alone and I'll just try to hit the spots all right would you please explain how Satan is bound a thousand years and being loosed again for the Battle of Revelation 208 all right this is not the battle of Armageddon Revelations 208 is not the battle of Armageddon all right Armageddon is on this side of the Millennium we're going to read it Gog and Magog is on the other side of the Millennium read your Bible it's in perfect order you don't juggle the books and say this comes before that this comes before that that's what we've tried to do do read it as it comes forth and see what it fits in it it'll stays in perfect order all right see this is not the battle of Armageddon the battle of Armageddon takes place on this side what on this side of the Millennium see all right at the when the tribulation period is ended because that's Armageddon now what relation does this have to do with the Battle of go and bega none What relation does armag get and things how none none one is this thousand years the other one is end of the the end of the Thousand Years one's on one side of the Thousand other's on the other self-explanatory all right says as mentioned see Satan was loosed out of his prison and went together all of the people the wicked to bring them to this place and God Reigns down fire and brimstone out of heaven and they were consumed see two battles all together all right Armageddon is one battle before the Millennium comes Gog and Magog is the battle after the Millennium takes place all right so then you're getting it for the correct order see putting it in order to understand that's the reason I wanted to make sure now in Armageddon it'd be a drastic destruction of the world but we'll get down in just a minute that's what mankind has always looked at the world being annihilated the world's not going to be annihilated right contrary to all the denominationalism teachings that's right amen because John saw the holy city coming down out of Heaven All Right Now where's it going right see we spent all of our time trying to see how we can get up to heaven the Bible tells you that he saw it coming down out of Heaven see this world will never be annihilated amen that's right all right to prove it now I want you to if you will by Wednesday to listen or read as much as you can on the message that is called the future home all right see then that way I won't have to do I'll just skim across the top of it and go on into what I want to say cuz I don't want to cover the future home the prophet has covered it I want to take the scriptures and just go through 21 and 22 all right so if you will read the future home or listen to the tape but now listen Armageddon Satan is bound he can't work right a perfect 1,000 years of peace upon Earth but there's things there that will never be in the future home that's right all right because it's two different events amen the M the Thousand-Year Millennium is not the future home it's right here on Earth right then the future home will come down Revelations 21 and 22 all right now in doing that then what I want you to think about Satan is bound during the you know Armageddon comes forth and he's killing the people doing what he can do working through mankind but then he gets bound all right now he's not destroyed right he's bound and then the Bible says he's loose for a little season so he's not destroyed but see in the Battle of Gog and Magog that's what we want to think about Russia China this and that the other coming around naturally they will be we're sitting there right now if you want something to do go home get your map and just put your finger on Israel and look around it what countries we don't have control of Russia and China and all those country have control of it is that not what the Bible said was it not what Jesus said he said when you see Jerusalem comp passed about on all sides look up your Redemption draw now all right we can see them sitting there now what far allil for number one that's you got to have oil to operate right it's got to right in that area you say well it's not in Israel they found plenty of oil in Israel and Israel is not letting the world know what they're sitting on that's right they don't have to worry about nobody they're sitting on enough y they captured that place and went over there and you to go over there you think of a desert and a dried up Place sure there's places like that but you ride right down beside the Dead Sea which is ain't nothing but salt you can't even sink in the Dead Sea there's so much consistency of minerals and salt that you can literally just lay out on it and won't go underwater now we've seen people doing it you don't have to worry about floating but if it wasn't for the all as I told you the other day many years ago I read that they captured Kuwait the reason they took Kuwait was for 50 years later they could get an oil pipeline to run through there you think we ain't sitting all around over there waiting we got to have it too but in that Dead Sea there's more minerals and things than anywhere in the world in the Dead Sea you know that all of your mud packs are made from Dead Sea mud all of those things see that's where everybody wants it we got to have some connection so we have to cap a country I why did they go after Kuwait when there was no listings come on there was no listings of any of those terrorists coming from Kuwait is that right right they come from Syria but we didn't jump on Syria that was just a a a blowed up thing to make it look like it we wanted that land we wanted our toe holes there and we've done a good job when you see Jerusalem Compass there's Compass now go over just get a map and look and look at the countries we've got and look at the countries they've got my point is what now see you want to lock it in and say Gog and Magog is just Russia no it's all of the world coming against Jerusalem the holy city it's you and I coming after it too that's it's United States being there no no we're over there to protect them if that's what you believe I want to sell you some stock in Brooklyn Bridge after the servic is over with if you're that mentality is that low we're sitting there because we want that stuff we've got to have it to operate right so we're there W to capture it just get a point but now listen what they don't realize Armageddon see it won't it won't destroy the demons and things right it just makes them where they can't work it Chains Them by Chain of circumstances Satan and his demons is it Satan just bound he's the only one Liv Ed but is it just him bound and the rest of them is loose to torment no he can't give no orders nobody can't go do nothing so all the demons are right in the millennial Reign there's no Devils can work there's no demons no little buddies of Satan that can go out and work so then Gog and Magog I want you to think about it not as a Russia coming down as a China coming down is us coming down and bombs are falling sure that will take place but what I want you to think about is what the prophet said about it that's why I want you to read the future home I want you to just go into the future home and read it and read it to not try to figure out how big the city is come on you know what I'm talking about how much preaching have you heard on the future home most of you have heard on the future future home and trying to do the dimensional come on but let's read what he had to say go ahead to number four and it's quite a reading so if I choose to read a little bit and jump over it just forgive me this is taken from the message called a future home preached in 1964 802 it's about paragraph 170 through 175 all right watch what he says Peter says the heavens will pass away with a great noise you remember that in the scripture but now watch in a minute when we get down to that that word pass away is the same word that when the the world is destroyed you know that that word pass away is the same word used for your baptism of the Holy Ghost when you get the new birth you passed away what from one condition to another one from a sinner to a saint from Lost to Eternal Soul not bodies and Spirits we didn't get that that's going to be later watch cause it's got to kill every disease every thistle every Thorn that doesn't happen in Armageddon no but it will happen in go and meog everything there is to be done the first fire will the fire will burn it up and remember it's not allog together just a literal fire it's also a holy fire see that will take away Satan and all of his all of the Devils both Heaven and Earth amen will pass away killing all the germs all the insects all the natural life on the earth even the H2O the water will explode think of it talk about a noise H2O two part hydrogen one part oxygen most deadly explosive there is in the world what did that guy blow up that uh out under oklah Oklahoma with fertilizer right nitrate ammonia nitrate that we put around the corn to get to grow right it's just cing to how you're doing it but what I love is this part about it see that's why when I get into looking at the future home I'm not just looking trying to figure out how big the city is and where it's going to set I love this you know when a man receives a baptism of a holy baptism of the fire you know the Bible says you receive the fire the the fire and the Holy Ghost and we call it holy ghost fire Holy Ghost and Fire but see it's not a baptism and then a fire it's the Holy Ghost itself burning out everything he burns out everything that's in that Soul it don't he don't give you a New Soul he don't destroy the soul that's right and no no where will he destroy this world that's right right amen we this Earth are the center of the universe amen you said no it's all out there and it's just moving us away well this is where God's going to choose to be right we're not going to moon to the moon or the Mars or to Jupiter right this is where God's going to choose for to be at well then this is the center of the universe you say yeah but we're all traveling all this that's okay but now listen there's a lot of noise around when a person receives a baptism and go go us they think that's a shame to hear people scream and shout like the do just wait till this Earth gets her baptism and we'll get the future home so I won't try to go into much of of it other than giving you thoughts we don't have the time see in that future home is going to destroy all demons all insects all germs they'll just be bound right in the Thousand Years but when you come to Gog and Magog it's not going to be just a atomic bombs falling it'll be a fire from God out of heaven right he'll use those atomic bombs because they will Blast away a lot of the things and it's on down through there if you read the future home you'll find it so many feet down in the earth will be annihilated or blow off as far as sinful man has been into the Earth that will be annihilated why because it's sin that's right everywhere we go we set our dirty feet on something when they went to the moon and set their foot up there that doomed that Moon do you understand what I'm saying that made a doom set on that Moon yes why because man polluted it that's right amen anywhere pollution goes God's going to destroy and it's going to destroy all the demons amen not just the germs yes right but all the demons amen right Satan's going to be cast into the Lake of Fire so all the demons are going to be cast in there right right amen and that's why we don't believe that hell is eternal right amen there's no Bible for it I want to see it amen right oh where the worm do not and everlastings and there's Eternal judgment but not eternal hell because as I say over and over if you're going to have an eternal hell you're going to have to have an eternal God living in hell so look what you messed up on well he can give eternal life to you where he can burn Eternal if he give eternal life to you you're born again right I thought that's what the new birth was have I missed it the new birth is God giving you eternal life right and then one day Body Spirit and soul will be totally Eternal and the Bible said have a body like un his glorious body that's right oh do you understand what I'm saying yes see I've got it in here about Russia and all like that where brother s they'll come down in Russia that's fine and they will be literal things happening but as I said read Ezekiel 38-39 they'll go through and burn the instruments of war they bury the bodies they do all kind of things but you don't have to bury no bodies when this thing blasts away but is not annihilated because the same word for your new birth is the same word that's used for this world passing away and you didn't pass away oh brother Dale I died Amen in Soul that's right rest of us is still alive that's where our trouble's at right these bodies these Spirits are not Eternal all right but you see Gog and MOG then is not just R countries coming together that's my whole point I was going to listen really leave this out you know and I thought well I'll go on to the Future home already started writing notes and I thought no there's something we're missing there on Gog and Magog Lord what is it I knew it was to be the destruction of of all germs and and all demons and things will be destroyed not just captured somewhere placed they may burn for millions and billions and billions of years that's where that the word Aon I believe it is or Eon Aon is applied to hell because you got sh goana Hades you got many words to use and Hell cannot be Eternal because you you can't put God in hell that's right am he went there one time for being and you amen that was to pay the price but you see the word Zoe is God's own life zo is eternal life amen all right so eternal life now there is no demon in your soul that's right I've heard preachers in this message try to preach since I got born again I got two Souls here I am and got in here and God and the devil in here living now you can't put that nowhere my Bible says God won't dwell in an unclean vessel now you do what you want to and believe what you want to but the Bible says he want amen so you can't put de the devil and God in you at the same time sure you're looking at the Devil in his works this flesh this being that I am is because of Satan in his works but inside of there is eternal life that there's no such thing as two Natures that's right right it won't work but you see that's man's idea little on organizational teachings of what we had but now listen anywhere that man has been is going to have to be purged anything he's done is going to have to be purged that's right the H2O will explode and we'll get to it later that the Bible says Heaven and Earth has passed away I saw no more sea that doesn't mean there's no more water in the world or it would have said all water no it says see the Mediterranean Sea the Sea of Galilee those are not oceans those are seas and for the city to set down we get later into Jerusalem then you got to get rid of some of that water that's there but don't worry about it got to take care of but it won't do away with the ocean everybody thinks one of the days when it blows up all the water in the world's gone we going to be no no it won't work so that's man's ideas and thoughts but listen to what I'm trying to say I'm trying to get you to look at armag I mean Gog and Magog Armageddon will be literal battles yes but it will still be caused by the word of God to the mouth of two witnesses that's what my Bible says the word will come through their mouth the fire of God will come through their mouth their words that will destroy all right but see this is a spiritual thing happening let alone a literal that's right any demon anything like that is going to be annihilated not captivated and put somewhere annihilated right we just remember then Gog and Magog wouldn't be covering Russia that's only nuclear Wars but if you can see what I'm talking about what I've quoted a couple of times the Bible said when you see Jerusalem comp passed about on all side look up your Redemption draw now go home and look at the map and look where we're all gathered around there we got our countries they got their countries sure they will be literal Nations yes but you know what was so amazing I think when you first read it it was to me when I first read the for seal about Armageddon cuz I was wanting to read that and I had all this figured out we did we taught it there's going to be Russia coming down China coming down this coming down that coming down brother randam never mentioned no country there he said Protestants and Catholics going against the word of God Armageddon will be Protestants and Catholics gathering together don't you ever heard this statement I was looking at this morning brother R said Russia is 1% communist he said then there 99% is on the Christian form you need that quote 1% of Russia is communist he said it had to be God allowing it to take place called how could 1% control a whole nation and see when they come riding down over there in literal happenings you know what'll be in those tanks coming from Russia people that call themselves Christians no no no well did any of you ever go to war I'm pausing I thought somebody might amen my point did you go over there and say I'm a Christian no you went over there and fought and it used to be that the tags was what you were either Protestant or Catholic now they got to have the whatnot of anything else you order to be put on there right or other you getting my point yes World War II you know that there was a lot of Germans and Japanese that was fighting against us that in their country before they were put in the military was Christians that's right see I'm trying to make a point brother BR said Protestants and Catholics coming down what is it going to be we read the Bible here it says come down upon the Beloved City what is the Beloved City Israel so who will it be Protestants and Catholics coming around this to try to destroy but God will destroy them because nuclear war listen Nu nuclear atomic energy does not destroy demons that is demons if you want to be plain nuclear war don't destroy demons that's right it takes God's word to destroy demons all right so when they come up there in the resurrection to go to the white Throne what are they doing you know that a lot of them will go there that Jesus said it he said they'll say one day have not I cast out devils done Mighty wonderful works in your name that he'll say depart from me cuz I never knew you right they never had an experience with God I'm just trying to get you to think Gog and Magog is not going to be just atomic energy pouring down sure that will happen but God is the only one that can destroy demons right germs might be annihilated by nuclear but what does it do it this creates more right some me we don't even know anything about but yet the Holy Fire of God will destroy right to Gog and Magog is going to be not just countries it's going to be God coming down raining fire down out of Heaven from his mouth to destroy all the demons the germs the things are going to be annihilated in Gog and Magog then they can be a future home am you get what I'm saying about the Earth what is it just as far as man is polluted it will be annihilated the rest of it's going to stay here right amen the core of the Earth is going to stay here right amen and then the future home's going to come down right CU what does it say in the future home there let's jump over this can y'all pull up in a hurry Revelations I got it somewhere in here Revelations 21 put it on there brother Anderson let me just say a few words about this cuz this is just a background to say it so you'll have it let's see if I can if you I got it written on one of the notes uh number six okay look what the scripture says in Revelations 21 I saw a new Heaven and new earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more seed that's what the scripture said remember that word passed away is not annihilated it's changing from one form to another and remember there's no more seed not meaning there's not no more water in the world that means around in Jerusalem you'll have to be no more seed to bring the city down cuz it's what 1500 square miles he said and I John saw the holy city Jer coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adoring for a husband and we'll just stop there but I just want the first verse and I saw a new Heaven and new earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth has passed away that's going to be a great Annihilation what is the first heaven then brother Brandon you're the prophet we ask you the question look at number seven Satan's e preaching 1965 829 uh paragraph 167 through 169 in my father's house are many are in my father's economy in my father's plans as many places I'll go to prepare place look how long it is 1500 square miles where where is it at is going to prepare it he's the Creator he creates all that gold and the streets are transparent he is the creator he's making a place over in Revelation 21 he said I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem descended from God out of Heaven there was no more SE the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away what was our first Heaven it's going to pass away are you reading it it was the Millennium your Millennium will be the first heaven cuz that'll be the first time that God will totally be ruling over Earth from the fall in the garden he hasn't ruled over Earth Satan is your big ruler of the earth that's right even offered Jesus the kingdoms of this world and Jesus never said you don't own them he just said get behind me I got to pay the price for it but look what is our first heaven was the Millennium what is the first Earth was this this earth now right this is the first Earth the Millennium will be the first Heaven all right and it'll be right here on the Earth where the city comes down right Amen to rest on and redeemed into our Earth showing an example of it Jesus was standing on the River Jordan you can roll that up if you want to I of where they can keep on reading Jesus was standing on the earth God came down out of heaven right is that in the Bible where he was there at his baptism and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell settled on a redeemed entire Earth John saw the holy city sitting on a redeemed entire Earth Jesus is right now he said I go to prepare place for you if I go to prepare place for you I'll come again to receive you under myself what's he preparing the future home right Amen brother to live right cuz the first heaven and first Earth has passed away right changed in form the world will be renovated Armageddon will put it back like a Garden of Eden amen right Armageddon will put back the world like a Garden of Eden the future home will put it totally beyond the Garden of Eden right amen yes sir cuz remember in the Garden of Eden you had the devil running around hissing right amen he ain't going to be there those snakes and things that will be there won't be harmful right are you following me Gog and MOG then is not just to talk about Russia because you look at it brother around said communism will pass away yep you remember that whoever thought of that when the world talk communism was the Antichrist the mark of the beast and all of the different things and communism passed away when they demanded payment from Russia y now they're Russia but now show me where they done away with any of their bombs and things nope the prophet said it one day and I agree he said they've got a bomb sitting there waiting on the Vatican they're going to stick it down a smoke pipe in the Vatican why because the Vatican is where the world system is tied up to and Russia's also got one with Washington tied on it right he said you mean you think that this United States is going to be destroyed well if you don't you better go back and read your Bible a little I remember talking to my mother-in-law about it me she was honest she told me I'm not throwing off on her I loved her greatest person in the world but she said Sam God's not going to let anybody destroy this Christian Nation I just said there ain't no such thing as a Christian Nation it's Christ in the people do you understand what I'm getting at I'm just getting one point to you yes cuz they'll have to understand the future home as we get to going in Gog and Magog will not only be a literal destroying but it'll destroy all demons all Devils there won't be any devil nowhere after then there won't be no devil because he's even cast in to the Lake of Fire himself the Bible says which is what what is it called the Lake of Fire the second death right right that's right the total Annihilation it won't be no little Mounds pushed up in the future home right it won't be no devil there to hinder all be gone amen first heaven and first Earth is already passed away when that happens Butz we ain't got to this world being pised away yet no but it will we not to we're not to the Millennium yet but we're heading that way the word of God is brought the world and all the things into existence would you agree yes and the word of God will destroy all the things that needs to be destroyed it's so hard to even think about that there'd be a time that even in the Millennium that Satan would be bound cuz you can say all you want to that the devil don't bother you I'm going to agree with you he don't bother you because he's already got you right told you about the man at work one day he said I'm not working on commanding the devil no more said I'm working on commanding the Lord I said so long I never talked to that man again cuz he said I'm commanding God to do things now I thought I'm talking to the head man right now so I'm just going to leave you old booger and I never talk with him again but see he had that idea right cuz the Bible says command ye me I said that does not I told him I said that does not mean commanding God that means you ask God to fulfill his word and he will do it I believe that you're sick you ask God to heal you he'll do it but you can't command him to do it you can't order him to do it but if you believe his word he'll do it right you understand what I'm talking about Gog and Magog let's get it out of our mind that it's a Russia or this kind of all of that we that's in God's economy I mean they're coming around there but it's still Protestants and Catholics amen why do you think countries wants other why do you think the United States wants other countries to toh be under their domain where they can put their doctrines and ideas there right see we want to clear up a country yes we want over there to set these women free that was bound and what do we do we put them in honky ton and made drunks out of them and prostitutes is that true did we make them better than what they were oh we freed them what's happened right you see church I want to see not only Satan bound because I'm thinking you ever heard the prophet say like this he said if you offered a million years to live or either give you eternal life as a Christian which one would you take cuz remember 969 I mean 999 you might live A million or you know like one day but you're going to be destroyed if you have eternal life you can't never be destroyed amen I don't just want Satan bound amen I want him destroyed bind him he gets loose again that's true but if he's destroyed he can't do it see God can annihilate come ahead musician God can annihilate all demons all things all powers all of anything he can totally annihilate it remember the Bible says Don't Fear him that can destroy the body right right it says fear him that can destroy the soul right see Satan can't destroy the soul that's right no matter what he does he can't destroy the soul but God can amen the most you can do with the Devil is resist him that's right right turn him down resist him but God can destroy yes you know one scripture that I'd love to be fulfilled in my life one scripture I've always wanted to be fulfilled in my life you know what that is when Jesus said one day he said Satan cometh and have nothing in me that's Bible Satan cometh or devil cometh and have nothing in me well now did he mean that the the devil couldn't beat him and make him sick and and heartaches and no no no no no no that was happening every day that's right y but he could not get an inroad into him offered him the world offered him everything you realize what he offered him when he offered him the world he offered him the ability to bypass Calvary that he didn't have to die you never thought it like that Satan offered God an opportunity that he didn't have to die he could bypass it right he said ain't going to do it I know what I come for I'm going to pay the price Satan couldn't understand that why a man would want right something like that greater than right the fact of setting him free that he didn't have to kill him I don't want Satan just bound that's a wonderful thing I want him totally annihilated and it'll take Gog and Magog to do that you go back and study it just what I'm saying if you go back and study Ezekiel 3 38 and 39 you'll find Gog and Magog all the way through it and the description of the countries it come from which you'll also find it like Gog is a son of so and so and mag goog is a country but my point today is try to get you to see Gog and Magog is going to be a spiritual more than just a f physical burning but it'll be destroying every devil every disease every germ everything will be annihilated amen what a wonderful day amen let's stand together he said well why do we need a new Heaven because we get to live in the first one the Millen ium and we don't want it to stay that way cuz that's not the fulfilling of God's plan right think on these things and that way we'll get away from just Russia and China and you going be away from that what I'm saying I I keep saying that over and over on that for seal when that Prophet brought down those forces coming around Jerusalem he said Protestants and Catholics and I first thought man who are those people I thought she was going to tell me like one time there was a title of a sermon said invasion of the US you better believe I got that sermon and I was going to see how this United States is going to be invaded boy he told me he said they came over on the mayly and he said they come in here and said we've been taught their doctrines and the United States has been invaded by man's doctrines that came from the old Roman Catholic Church I was really disappointed cuz I wanted to see who was going to be the battling when he said what Armageddon would be Protestant Catholics I was kind of disappointed cuz I was thinking he'd tell how Russia would come down and how this would come down and then and they will but when God looks at it he calls them Protestants and Catholics you said but now you you got plenty of Muslims and and Islams and all like that ain't nothing but Protestants and Catholics nothing in the world with Protestants and Catholic you ever notice the pope don't never fight them islamics and things come on you ought to read a little bit think a little bit what's the difference in the Protestant and the Catholic what's the difference in the Catholic and the Islam in a lot of respects the Islam and things is better because in the Catholic form you have them trying to believe the pope is God at least in the islamics every one of them is they believe that all is God that's right they don't claim none of them to be Allah that's right what's the difference when you get a false doctorine or true doctor I want the truth don't you go ahead
