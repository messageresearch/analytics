========================================
yeah so they finally concluded good morning good morning today I want to talk about the five colors of Elijah my brother talking already preach I told him did you know there were six comments of Elijah and he looked at me like Eli does when I tell him babies don't cry too so when he got through preaching he came back and said guess what there's seven seven he said yeah I got a grandson his name Elijah too so I said well are we in trouble we're trying to start a new doctrine over here okay first game Seventeen one first king 17. now Elijah is going to be our foundation that's where all the spirit goes from each each uh messenger the first I want to read the first seal so just get your bottle ready first game 17-1 he was Elijah himself and next time he come he was Elijah the next time he come he was what John the Baptist the next time they come is for the seventh angel and the fifth time he comes with Moses Over Yonder now five if you know your numerals of the Bible five is a number of laboring race and that's what he's done now watch you want to know what it is was Jesus a labor of Grace j e s u s five l-a-b-o-r direct labor or love for you and if you get to him did you get to him how come faith in labor is that right labor is a number of race he said all right to the Believers the first time Elijah there was him the second Was Elijah the Third for John the fourth with the seven Angel of the last Messenger to the church Ace according to Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 7. now that fifth time he's a messenger to the Jews Jews after that church is gone okay that's far away okay first game 17 one and a larger t-shirt who was in heaven and gilia said unto hey there and as the Lord go to Israel let it behold whom I stand with you there shall not be doing I Reign this year but according to my word he had thus said the Lord he can he can start the rain he can stop the rain okay 1841. First Kings 18 41. and Elijah said that I have a Ahab get me up eat and drink or there's a sound abundance of rain he releases the rain okay first of Second Kings one Second Kings 110. and Elijah Anderson said to the captain of 50. I'll be a man of God then let Fire come down from heaven and consume thee and by 50 and there came down from Far From Heaven and consumed him in his 50. so he he can release the rank he can stop the rain he can send fire from heaven okay let's go to Second Kings two to eleven I remember Elijah does not die and all the rest don't die this is saying things to 11 and he came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold they appear and Chariot of fire horses are fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven so he was taken away so he didn't die okay let's go to Revelations 11. oh no hold on Matthew next time you see Elijah in Matthew 17. Matthew 17. here okay Matthew 17 one two three one two three yeah and Seventeen one two three 's a tug Peter James and John his brothers and bring them up into a high mom apart and was transferred every four of them and his face this shine as the sun and his Ramen was white as the light and behold their appear unto them Moses and Elias talking with him now that's that's the next thing okay let's go to Revelations 11. now I know there's two Jews but I'm tunnel I'm trying to see where each time that Elijah appears Revelations 11 let's start at the third chapter foreign two hundred and three score days clothed in sat cold these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them fire perceive out of their mouth and their power of their enemies what did Elijah do in this manner be killed these have power to shut the heavens that it rained on a days of their prophecy Elijah and that power over the waters to turn them to blood and to Smite the Earth with all the plagues as often as they will Moses and when they shall have tennis their testimony the Beast they'll send us Spirit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them and their bodies and their dead bodies that lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord was crucified and they are the people in Cambridge and tongues and Nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half and shall not suffer the dead virus to be put in Graves and they shall dwell upon the Earth it shall rejoice over them and make mercy and shall send gifts one to another because these two Prophets tormented them they dwell on the earth and after three days and have a spirit of life from God and enter into them and they stood up their feet in a great fearful upon them we saw them and they heard a great voice from Heaven saying unto them come up hither and as they stand up to heaven in a cloud and the enemies beheld him okay and the message that Tim virgin brother and says foreign New Testament and that's wrong that's wrong here's the two witnesses absolutely a return of Moses and Elijah the two witnesses Moses and Elijah come back and preached exactly three and a half years under the anointing other baptism the Holy Ghost for their blessing is still the blessing is taken from that Gentiles and the church is taken up and the co-formal church is hunted like those by the Communists and Roman parties and when they're hunted down and killed they're killed and then these two prophets priests three and a half years and the Bible said that they were killed in the street called spiritually Sodom and Egypt where Lord was crucified now I could I could never get that Moses Moses came back with Elijah because you know he died so I think brother explains it on certain sound now these men are kept Alive by God from their original Ministry for the future service they their service are well just think the spirit of Elijah and ministers five times Moses too what kept what kept alive or further service they were neither one of them dead now don't you believe that they were both seen alive talking to Jesus among Transfiguration the Lord remember they must die right now this is one that uncertain Simon he was revealing himself another fashion what was he in and glorified transfigured condition he's coming the way he's coming and glorify Christ transformed his remake of shining like the son my he stood in the cloud and he's coming in the closing glory Lord Sheriff like love not a little while all these angels with him Hallelujah mind that stuff where he's coming coming in the cloud and we're here's where the question mark had on my heart now notice when they see him stand there and before them I appeared to him Moses and Elijah watch that what did Moses mean Moses represented the one that had died and was sleeping in the grave because Moses died and was buried nobody knew where he was buried at but he represented the ones that were asleep when he comes uh by the way said he was in his glorified body so that the Bible did say that Moses did die and that the only thing that we saw that uh Moses talking about Michael which is Michael which is a the resurrection Angel like I said the Bible said he didn't die so we gotta know okay let's go with Elijah he's got a second Kings too I thought you guys are going to be gone seven Kings two 9-14 and they and it came to pass when they were going over that Elijah said unto Elijah that's what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elijah said I pray thee that a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said that I was asked a hard thing nevertheless without see me when I'm taken from thee he shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be sold and it came to pass that there's still an on top that before pull their chair that fire horses and parted them both asunder Elijah went up by all over and into heaven and Elijah sword and Christ my father my father a chair of Israel and Horseman thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rented them in two pieces he took off also their manner of Elijah they fell from him and went back and stood by the bank by Jordan the spirit of Elijah goes to the next one all right foreign Jordan with Christ we got one portion but when we returned we're coming with two portions we got eternal life restoration from sin now in Richardson with the Holy Ghost and then yeah on the return of Christ we come back with both physical restoration and we already got spiritual Resurrection we have a double portion of it always a type of Christ and the church Elijah and Elijah okay let's go to 17. 13. Second Kings 13 uh 20 to 21. and Elijah died and they buried him and the bands of a mobile and invade the land at the coming of the end of the year and he came to pass that they were bearing a man that behold they aspire to abandonment and they cast the man into Sepulcher of Elijah and when a man was left down and touched the bones of Elijah he revived and stood up on his feet another one that died okay let's go to uh brother Branham Malachi four five to six America four or five to six behold I will send you a lie to the prophet before they come and the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers please that come and smite the Earth with a curse questions and answers brother I said all right remember yeah future now you could not have been the coming of John Deere with the Elijah but it comes five times now Jesus great Jesus Faith Grace five is a number of ways Elijah makes five appearance one time with Elijah as Elijah John Atlanta Magento and over emotion to the Jews everybody I'll read enough programs life story and uh those Rhymes life story says that he said well I started up the lane again I turned to look at this again and when it did a human or it's just as audible as mine has said don't you never drink smoke or defile your body in any way there'll be a work for you to do when you get older why look look to scare me to that you could imagine how a little fellow felt I dropped those buckets you know and home I went just as hard as I could go screaming at the top of my voice oh now he did try smoking and try to drink so you remember that little girlfriend yeah now this little girl when I looked at her my heart just bleed and I thought poor little fella and she said oh you want a cigarette Billy I said no ma'am I said I don't smoke she said now you say you didn't dance they wanted to go to a dance and I won't do it so they said there was a dance on there what they call Sycamore Garden I said no I don't dance she said no you don't dance you don't smoke you don't drink how do you have any fun I said well I like your fish I like to hunt they didn't interest her so she said take this cigarette and I said no man thank you I don't smoke and I was down the offender they had running boards on the old Force you remember and I was standing on Nintendo sitting on the back seats she and I and she said you mean you won't smoke a cigarette set and we girls has gotten more nerve than you have I've said no ma'am I don't believe it I want to do it she said why you big oh my God I wanted to be a big bag of bill so I sure didn't want nothing see I wanted to be a prize fighter and that was my idea of life so I said I couldn't stand that so I said give it to me I know you're numbness responsible for what you think um that just responsible for telling the truth and it started to strike that cigarette just as much determined to smoke it as I am to pick up the Bible see I heard that going I'll try it again I couldn't do it come out and I got crying I threw the thing down they got to laughing at me and I walked home went up through the field sat down and they're crying and it was a terrible life they offered me to uh they offered him the drink too and he said uh I remember one day dad was going down to the river with the boys my brother and I were we had to take a boat and go up down the river hunting bottles to put the whiskey in we got a nickel a dozen boy you get rich for that we picked them up along the river and dad was with me and he had one of those little flat I believe there was a better half half pint bottles and there was a tree had blown down in bed and this man was with me with him Mr darn Bush I had his he had a nice Bowl I wanted to find fail with him because I wanted to use that bowl he had a good Rudder and mine didn't have no Rudder at all we had just old boards and pedal with and he let me use the boat so we done well then and he made the Stills for death so he they throw their leg up across the tree and that reached in his back pocket and pulled out a little flat bottle of whiskey handed it to him and he took a drink and it back to Dad and he'd taken a drink and he said get down on a little supper on the side of the tree and went out and Mr Dawn Bush picked up and said here you are Billy said thank you I don't drink he said Brandon Madonna right everyone died with a boots on nearly and he said that random.com right I said no sir no that said I raised a again because my daddy called me and seriously I said hand me that bottle and pull this stop her out of the top of it they try not to drink it and when I started to turn it up I handed a bottle back and took off done through the field as hard as a good crime did something wouldn't let me do it see I could not say that that was any good I was determined to do it but it's God grace Amazing Grace that kept me from doing those things I wanted to defend myself but you just not let me do it I got so much stuff to do but if we're not going to be able to cover everything so a little bit we're probably not going to get to the two witnesses but a good thing I'd probably look at it page 324 Metro checkbook not only do we see this messenger coming here in Revelation 10 7 where we find that the word speaks of Elijah coming forward Jesus return in Matthew 17 10 and the disciples asked him saying why then say describe that Elijah and my first come and Jesus said Elijah's truly is our first come and restore all things before the coming of Our Lord Elijah must come back for a work a restoration in the church this is Malachi 45 and 60 Hall I will send you Elijah the prophet before they come in at the Grateful day of the Lord we are the Lord he should turn their hearts our fathers to the children the heart of the children to the father at least they come and smite the Earth with a curse there's absolutely no doubt Elijah must return before the coming of Jesus as the Pacific work to accomplish that work is that word is part of Malachi or sick that says he will he will turn a horse at the children to their father the reason that we know this in the specific work to do at this time because he is already accomplished the part that says he should turn the hearts of the father to their children when the Elijah Ministry was here in John that Baptist Luke 1 17 and he shall go before him in a spirit of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children the disobedient to the wisdom or just to make ready people prepare for the Lord and the ministry of John the horse of the father returned to the children we know that because Jesus said so but it does not say that the hearts of the children were turned to the father that is yet to take place the heart of the less they children will be returned back to the Pentecostal father John got the fathers ready for Jesus to welcome the children into the fall novice Prophet upon the spirit of Elijah Paul will prepare the children to welcome back Jesus we don't have time but uh everybody is expecting for brother Robert to come back but just like the Chinese Laundry tickets I looked over and I thank you
